Lord you're so good to us Lord you are Jehovah Gyra Lord you have already met the need before it even arrives Lord You've Got A Plan of provision for each and every one of us Lord so I pray you just be another provider tonight Lord as your word comes forth Lord I pray your grace for my voice I pray Lord for the hearer and the speaker equally tonight Lord that your word would just find its place in our hearts Lord that it' be mixed with Faith Lord to produce what it's supposed to in our lives we ask Lord remembering those that aren't here those that are sick tonight Lord we pray a special touch on them we ask in Jesus J Christ's name amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians chapter 1 amen good to see each one here tonight and I'm going to try and preach tonight my voice was good enough to yell at my youngest to come in the house before church so if I'm good enough to do that I should be good enough to preach for a while as long as I don't get too excited amen so we're just trusting the Lord tonight amen good to see each one good to see brother Chad back in service and he survived another round another battle amen amen it was so good to be in there and just hear him start to to praise the Lord and it's a good thing you know I was reading in the church age book this this afternoon and you know it was uh brother Brown was talking there about how we forgotten the goodness of God and what it means to be free in the spirit and he was talking about the the the the spirit of the nickan what it did was it took everything away from the people and put it into the man behind the pulpit it put it into the officers of the church and these things and what they lost with that was not just the moving and the leadership of the Holy Spirit but they lost the effect of the holy spirit in their Worship in their praise and all these different things and he's pointing out that we're all one in Christ and that means when the holy spirit moves we all move amen we're all caught in it we're all going with it and I think it's a good thing that if we can be free in our worship if we can be free in our praise to express what God's doing and what he's saying and how he's leading us and providing us in our lives so amen it's good to have each one of you here God bless you richly Ephesians 1 very familiar scripture verse three says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're continuing on our series on manifesting time and I want to take a second service on the revealing of the son and last service we focused a great deal on the Eternal part of God and and why we are children of God and how we're coming to a place and why we're coming to a place and I had to kind of Rush at the end because my voice was going very quickly and so I just want to to to just back up just a second and just kind of close that off before we get into our thought this evening amen so I started in Ephesians 1 and I want to just continue there a little bit tonight we're just going to teach by God's grace and it'll be easier on my voice amen but it says in in verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ I think that's a beautiful scripture when it says all spiritual blessings amen I want everything that God has for for me and there's nothing that is held back from the children of God when they step into his plan there's nothing that's held back we preached remember on the the benefits the blessings of being a child of God there is nothing that he has held back from us in this time and in this season everything in his word is for us now remember when they went into Canaan there was nothing held back he says you go in there you take it everything that's in there is for you and God is no different today he's saying everything in here if you can put your name behind those Scriptures it belongs to you it's yours and you can have it amen it's for the children of God by faith just like Abraham had but verse four says according as Heath chosen Us in him in him now I looked at at that and and we say that's in Christ yes that was in Christ and and we came out of his side at Calvary and these different things but when you go back to the original word that word in is the same as a woman who's pregnant where she has a baby in her it literally means that there's a life inside it means that he chose us he carried us inside of him and the inference there is that he's he he put us there with purpose and he's going to bring us to life the same way a woman would bring a baby to life when she has a full pregnancy and everything goes through the way it's supposed to so it says according us as he had chosen Us in him in Christ when when we acted on the word when we finally got our lives together when we we finally started coming to church no before before everything before everything we were chosen in him amen before the foundation of the world and look at the effect of that choosing of being in him not the effect that we make the effect of his choosing now it says the effect of his choosing is that we should be holy like he is that we should be without blame that we would be free of judgment before him in love amen the driving force the the very character the very nature of God is love which means it is for our benefit so everything that he's provided for us is for our benefit it's to make our lives better not worse but our lives are better in his kingdom not in this Kingdom amen the the the the greatness of his life is not expressed here it's really when we go to the other side and then we come back to a new Heaven and a new Earth amen but his his purpose is that we be holy and blame blameless before him in love verse 5 says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to what again our great lives our great actions our great faith our great acceptance no according to the good pleasure of his will now remember when I said that children of God are the only ones that don't get to choose where they go here's your proof of it he has already decided where we're going to be because we were with him in the beginning we have to be with him there in the End Amen we're predestinated and we've got to go back to our origin and that's his will not our will I said before you can go the hard way or you can go the easy way you can go Kicking and Screaming remember like Paul when the when when the pillar of fire knocked him off his horse he says Paul it's hard to kick against the Pricks Paul's conscience was bothering him Saul's conscience was bothering him as he was called at that time and Jesus said it it's easier to just go the the way I've called you to go like why are you fighting so hard against the thing that's inside of you to do I've said this before over the pulpit I've said it to people if I'm wrong in what I believe believe I'm happy where I'm at because there's something in me that identifies with this so whether it's right or wrong I can't change it I'm identified with it amen and it has changed me and it has made me who I am and it's the same for children of God Amen is that there's something in us that responds to the word of God and it's not by our choosing it's not by our intellect it's not by our family bloodline it's not because of the ministry we're under but rather it is the election of God that predestines us to come back to him in his time and in his season it's according to his will not according to my will amen then he says in verse six as we'll continue on says to the praise of the glory of his grace I think Amazing Grace is going to be the theme song in in heaven because it's not going to be anything I did it'll be there because of his predestined grace and favor that I am there that everything I have that everything I've been given that everything I do will be because he put me in himself before the foundation of the world Amen our glory is not in oursel our glory is in his grace amen that has brought us to the place where we are today and where we're going to be in that great time to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted his grace makes up us accepted not my works not my righteousness not my Sanctified life not my my work as a minister or yours as a Believer whatever it might be but it is what his grace that has made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace yet again it's Grace Grace Grace wherein he had oh I love this he has abounded sometimes Jesus said you have not because you ask not ask that your joy may be full he's abounded in us there's an abundance there's an overflowing of what he's willing to give us and the measure that we get is only limited by how much we're willing to take not by how much he's willing to give his grace is endless his mercies are endless his forgiveness is endless it it's all there and all that limits us is our faith to take it and come to him amen as he's he's made us accepted he says he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence why wisdom and Prudence because we need it we need it what is wisdom wisdom is knowledge put properly into action and you know what is we're taught very well but the test is really what will we do when we have to put that into action amen he has all experience he knows all things he's he's the omniscient God he knows everything and so when we have need of something the scripture says if any man lack wisdom let him go to God who abrath not but giveth unto every man as he wants so he's given us all wisdom Prudence means understanding so we can have we can have leadership we can have guidance on what to do and we can have understanding about what's going on behind the scenes as well he's holding nothing back from his church nothing back from his bride nothing back from his his children and we saw what he did with the disciples he says to them it's not given but to you it's given he says they're servants but you're my friends you're my brothers I've opened up the Mysteries to you I'm showing you what God's doing in this time it says and then it says he's he's having made know unto us the mystery of his will the mystery of what why we're here who are we why are we what we are what's our part to play in it why you why me we have all of those answers today in principle but specifically it's going to be for each one of us in our individual walk with God as he shows us his purpose and his plan for each one of us he says having made un note unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure we don't get to pick he's already determine what we should be and how we should live this life according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times this literally means that in the stewardship of the Season where all things are f filled he is the great Steward he's the one that's managing it he's like if you look at Joseph in Pharaoh's Kingdom Joseph was the steward of all things Pharaoh said go do it and he did it he said you don't have to tell me how to do it just do it this is the way Christ is is he's taking care of the entire situation and he's bringing it all together it says that in the fullness dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ so everything that was in him before the foundation of the world has to be with him at the at the ending of the world and when things become new and all these different things he says both which are in heaven those that have gone on the saints that have gone on by way of the grave and which are on earth amen those that are alive and remain at his coming it says even in him so it's all in him it started with him it finished with him we're the product of his pleasure his will his desire and we do not have a part in determining those things it is completely of him and it's the grace of God Amen he chose us before we ever chose him and that gives me great satisfaction because even when I don't feel like serving him even when the feeling's not there when the emotion's not there when you're just not feeling it yet we continue on because he chose us and there's an anchor that ties us and that anchor is the predestination of God that we are as children look at how Jesus chose his disciples when he walked on Earth so you got to realize that some came to Jesus under preaching they heard the word and they came but when Jesus chose the disciples he didn't preach to them what did he do he walked by and he said follow follow me and he walked by another one and he said follow me he chose them he said I have chosen you amen he went out and he called them and he chose them in the condition they were in that's the beauty of it am man I'm reminded of brother Mark he calls himself you know a raw Heathen living under a mushroom and then God speaks to him and it's like and he realizes he's a Son of God in his condition a backsliding Catholic at best no knowing nothing of the true word of God what happens the spirit of God comes his way and says follow me and without it making a lick of sense brother Mark you did it not knowing what you responded to and each one of us has to come to that place where when he calls we answer you look at them they didn't we don't see anything about them saying well let me see we do that we do hear that from the ones that never followed him remember let me go back and bury my father and let me go back and say goodbye those ones never followed him but the ones that followed him were the ones that were called and he goes to Peter and Andrew and they're fishing he says follow me and the scripture says they left their Nets and went right away then he goes to backslid and Matthew the the the the traitor to his people the tax collector and he says follow me and Matthew leaves a great job to go and follow Christ and these were not the Great Men of the time these were not the wonderful Scholars the scripture says that Peter and John were ignorant and unlearned men but he took them where they were how they were because they were his children amen remember John 15:16 Jesus said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you he does not choose us without purpose or without plan he says he's ordained them that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and catch this that your fruit should remain because you can look at Judas and he had fruit for a while but after a while what happened it went away I'm going to start preaching if this keeps up his fruit went away it didn't stay because he was not a child of God Jesus said I've chosen you and one of you is a devil he had to choose him because of his purpose he was ordained to to betray Jesus but the others he said I've chosen you that you would produce fruit and that your fruit would remain then there's a pause remember there's the semicolon or the full colon there I can't tell my eyes aren't so good I'm like screen but then he says and after a while then he says that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you he says there's a time for your fruit and then your fruit to remain and then after that is adoption you're going to ask things in my name and I'll give you whatsoever you ask because you ask according to my will you come into a season where you're mature let's not just look at the men look at the women that followed him you look at Mary the mother of James and Martha the the sister of Lazareth spiritual women good women that followed him that were very obedient to the word then you have Mary Magdalene that was full of sem demons and the one of the first things he did was he delivered her of that but she was as chosen as Mary the mother of James and as Martha the sister of Lazarus look at he goes to that woman at the well one of the most beautiful stories in scripture of the predestination of God and and this woman at the well was overcome with life's problems she has already married and divorced five men she's living common law and she comes and she meets Christ at the well and he's not there by happen stance he goes out of his way to meet this woman the scripture says he must needs go by Samaria in in literal point it means that he had to go to Samaria it was necessary why because there was a child of God that didn't know she was a child of God but when the word of God would flash across her life what would happen she would realize I am a a child of God I'm a daughter of God and it freed her from everything that was holding her back the Revelation that you're a child of God when you truly get it will put aside everything that Satan has against you this evening as soon as she realized who he was and that he had come to her it freed her from everything and she could go back and testify and in an entire city heeded her words and came out and they accepted Christ for who he was what an amazing testimony of what happens when predestinated Sons and Daughters recognize who they are and recognize that God is for them and he's not against them and he's got good thoughts toward them to bring them to an expected end that's why we are here today that's why you're here today that's why I'm here today is that there is something inside of us that he placed inside of us before we ever came on this world Amen it was in the thoughts of God and God came in every day each one of us we have a day where he says you're mine and sometimes we fight like Paul like saled and sometimes we heed right away but there's got to come a day where we say I am a child of God and we start to live like it because he's given us a revelation of who we are brother br will put it this way he says now in the beginning way back way years ago before there was a time began you if you are a born again Christian tonight you were in God then your father that's why when you come into this life here and profess Christianity well everything going wrong you've wondered why this is and all this if you've wondered at it but one day something struck you what was it that life that was down in there from the beginning you can't add it in and you can't take it out it's there or it's not and that sounds hard but it's true there are some that are chosen and then there are some that are just drawn and the chosen are the elect predestinated children of God and that's the mystery that's been hidden all through this time is is what in the dispensation of the fullness of times what happens is the mystery of God's Redemption plan comes into its fullness and we see what it was all about we see who's a part of it we see our part in it we see all the things that God's trying trying to do but within that mystery of redemption we have the mystery of adoption we have the mystery of his coming we have the mystery of his will we have the mystery of his the Resurrection The Rapture and it's all a part great of the great mystery of God that he's trying to reveal in us and through us and to us it's all through us now amen Paul said this in Hebrews he said wherefor seeing we are also compassed about with so greater cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and every and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us I was reading in the Ephesian Church age this morning or this afternoon and and he was focused on on this idea of repentance he says if you've seen the word and you've walked away from it come back do it while there's still repentance available do it while there's still a spirit of God with the mercy there to receive it and do it quickly because there comes a time where there is no more repentance available let's he that's filthy be filthy and let him that's holy be holy still amen there's a time when it's get cut it gets cut off it says and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus oh if we can catch this Revelation the author and the finisher of our faith we sing that song something keeps holding me it is not myself that holds me he is the author and the finisher he is the Alpha and the Omega he is the beginning and the end and everything in between is him and his work we look to him to finish this he started it I I've said it before I didn't want to be a Christian because I didn't think I would like it and I wanted to have freedom to go and become a doctor and and have nice cars and live a nice life and all these different things I didn't want to be a Christian but something in me wanted to be a Christian but I didn't want to be a Christian and I fought it for so long and eventually I gave my heart to the Lord because I was more miserable not being a Christian than potentially the Christian that I thought I didn't want to be and all I found all I found out as soon as I gave my heart to the Lord was I love being a Christian why because I am a Christian I am a Son of God you are a daughter of God you are a son of God you'll find yourself so much happier when you give in to what God has for you amen and there's a fulfillment that comes with it there's a peace there's a rest he says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith he's telling us this for a reason who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God Paul's Paul's telling us look to him as your example look to him as your anchor look to him as your strength because you've got a path that's going to be like his and he did it because he saw what was waiting at the end and you've got to be able to see that there's something at the end of all this trouble at the end of all this trial at the end of this persecution of this hardship that we go with amen that's where I was going last service that's a a grand wrap up of it but I want to talk about Jesus's morning and and his life and his adoption process and how it worked and how he came to a place of adoption and in Luke 2 it says and it came to pass that after 3 days they remember they left Jesus they they they they'd gone there for the feast and they left and they were gone a couple days and they couldn't find him in the Caravan and so they had to come back and find him and they're all mad and upset and worried and it says and they came to pass that after 3 days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors the doctors of the law both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers 12 years old who's 12 here I think Gabe's 12 Gabe would have been astonishing the ministry that's how far Jesus had progressed the 12 years and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said to him son why hast thou thus dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee soring we're worried why'd you do this to us and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me whing not did you not know that I must be about my father's business but if you strip this down we look at the father's business and we get a certain idea that but if you go to the original language Jesus says don't you know that in my father's house it behooves me to be me he says I'm in my father's house I've got to act like my father when I'm in my father's house in other words he saying I'm coming to a place where I've got to display who I really am it's going to come to a place where I've got to let the world know who I am amen and we're at the same place Satan's Children are definitely being revealed nothing's hidden amen the son of preditions been revealed what about God's children if they're being revealed clearly then the children of God ought to be revealed clearly as well but he confounded them here and it says and they understood not the same which he spake unto them and he went down with them he never explained it but he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man without the holy spirit in him this is a child of God this is a Son of God continually growing and maturing gaining favor with the people around him and with God and yet without the Holy Ghost how obedience to the word purely obedience to the word but I want to focus on that phrase the father's business because this is a theme that comes up time and time again with Jesus and we know he was the firstborn of me many Brethren he's the first of many he's the first of the rest of us and so when people come to to godhead people say well Jesus speaks of his father and that's obviously two separate people but you have to remember there is a flesh man there's a flesh man there and that is Jesus the flesh man that was born and that man had a nature and a personality just like you and I he was just like Adam in the garden he had a personality he had a mind he could choose he could do all these things he was born sinless which is why he's called the second Adam and so he wasn't tainted by sin but he was surrounded by sin and he was surrounded by Temptation yet he never gave into it he was as human as you or I but he was not in sinless in sinful flesh he was in sinless flesh amen and up until the Jordan of river experience he was he was a Son of God but he was not the fullness of the godhead bodily cuz God was not yet dwelling in him it was a body prepared it was a body prepared the scripture says we're no different were a body prepared amen a body as th prepared me and then we see a Jordan what happens is the holy spirit comes into him and what is it that's the fullness now of God dwelling in a body he was born the Son of God just as you and I were born the Son of God but he was not placed as the Son of God until Jordan why because the Son of God had to have the spirit of God inside of him that was his placing that was his his recognition in terms of of who he was amen but the same up to that point he was the same as you and I before the new birth he overcame purely by staying with the word he had no Supernatural power or authority granted to him amen and even at the tender age of 12 years old he was confounding the the scholars in the in the church you know it's interesting when when my wife and I or my wife and kids went to California Jonathan was confounding them because he was talk they were talking about the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost and you know that was for that day and Jonathan saidwell what about the Scripture it says it's for you and your children as many as the Lord Our God shall call and they saidwell we just don't believe that it confounds them not because we're great intellectuals but because we have a full word that's been open to us and it is so simple to us it is so simple to us the things that we believe that even a child even a child being well taught by a family at home and by our Sunday school teacher and the ministry here and these different things can go out and can confound the wise of this world with the Simplicity of the doctrine that we believe amen but I thought it was so beautiful that Jesus said I've got to be about the father's business he says I've got to be who I really am and he came up to the place where he was going to show that all that God had made him for you know we've got to find the same place in our own lives we've got to find what's God's will for us and everything that Jesus did was building up to what is the Father's will for me that's all he was focused on and he knew that if he stayed with the word his purpose would come to him his time would come to him the revealing of of the plan of God for him all of these things was being revealed in him as he studied the scriptures and as he stayed with him the word of God started to come to fruition and we've got to we've got to handle it the same way amen we've got to be able to trust that we are where God places us with purpose that we're just not sitting here that we're not just in Newan land we're not just in Newan land we're not just sitting in this church building by happen stance or by our choice but it's because God has placed us where we're supposed to be you know I look back at my own life and there are times and places I thought why am I here or why am I still here cuz it made no sense you know maybe Ministry were have fallen off you most of you know what happened in Texas we had no Pastor for a year and you're sitting there and you're you're trying to keep things together and you don't have a regular Ministry and the church is fracturing and falling apart what's the point of staying in there but I had to get a crash course in Ministry CU I only had 16 years to prepare to come back here and so God gave me a crash course in Ministry in church in Clicks in gifts in in men that got ahead of themselves and men that took too much on themselves youth versus age you know older age all these different things and I had to learn above all else that God's word takes preeminence because I had multiple situations and I had to humble myself and say the reason that this situation could get as far as it did is because I put the person I put the gift I put the ministry I put their feelings I put respect over the word of God and that's a humbling experience especially when your family has to get dragged through something and it's because you me I'm talking about me because I didn't hold the word in its full preeminence and God had to do that to me a number of times just to get me to say all right I get it stay with the word above all else and I have had the privilege of meeting some wonderful men with some wonderful gifts and there's not a single one of them that gets to act above the word of God in my life now and I say that with all all humility and all honor to those men but the word of God takes preeminence and I don't care how great your ministry is I don't care how great your church is I don't care if you can see visions and dreams I don't care if you've got a direct line to the throne of God if it doesn't match up with this it does not matter balam had a direct line to the throne of God and look what happened to him Judas had it too Caiaphas had it at one point as well all false anointed ones amen Jesus spent the first 30 years of his life putting the word of God first and we have no indication what his life looked like we have no idea what that looked like but we know it wasn't easy because he looked 50 by the time he was 33 he had a tough life he had a rough life he had a rough upbringing but look at Philippians 2 it says let this mind being in you which also was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God now that's a mouthful and we're supposed to have the same mindset Paul says he says let this I'm being you he didn't think of robbery to be equal with God he says you shouldn't think the same thing either we'll hit this in another service it take us too long to go through it tonight it says but in that Revelation he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself I guarantee you in those 30 years he learned to Humble himself a great deal it says and he became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross now brother BR would say this he says now watch what God did when his son was born he let him go for 30 years testing him and trying him what was he doing preparing him for his role as the Son of God preparing him for his role as the expressed image of God as the fullness of the godhead bodily preparing for his ministry preparing for him to redeem the world preparing to step into his ordained position but what did those 30 years look like we this scripture is silent specifically but we know that Paul talked to Timothy as a Young Man preparing and Timothy became the bishop he became the pastor in Ephesus as we know and Paul prepared Timothy for his ministry and Paul or Timothy was just a young man but Paul knew God had a plan for Timothy had been revealed to Paul what Timothy was going to do and so he was constantly encouraging Timothy to prepare for what's coming your way and we see in 1 Timothy 4 remember the scriptures given to show us insight into all things and you say we don't know what happened to Jesus but we know what the what the word says that other young men were supposed to do in preparation for Ministry I believe this is insight into what Jesus life looked like and I believe it Bears witness based on the scriptures we've already read Paul told Timothy he says let no man despise thy youth I preached on this many times you know the young people will say you can't look down on me as I'm as a young person the scripture says you can't despise me because of my age but how many of them will repeat the rest of the Scripture it says but be thou an example of the Believers that's why you they are not supposed to look down on your despise your age is because you're an example of the Believers how in word in conversation that means in living in charity in spirit in faith and in Purity so Paul told Timothy he said be an example of a Believer to the Believers that's how you prepare to become a minister is you live the life before you ever take authority behind a Pulpit you've got to prove yourself first respect is earned it's not given you don't take it they have to give it and you have to earn it and how long does Timothy have to do this till I come Paul says give attendence to reading to exhortation and to Doctrine young people don't ever let anybody tell you you don't have to know your Bible that you don't have to know what you believe and why you believe it you need to have an anchor and a foundation in the scriptures that everything you do is according to the word of God absolutely amen and everything that we preach we ought to be able to preach directly from these pages I shouldn't need quotes to preach anything that we believe because it's the word of God revealed amen it's an open word to us now amen like I said before some of our older kids can confound those Selena has had many discussions I know at work and these different things with with co-workers and and the Simplicity of the Gospel we believe staggers people but it's also the Simplicity of how we believe we literally just believe and if you don't like it that's fine if you like it it's fine if you agree disagree that's okay we're not combative about it why because if you don't want it you don't have to have it but we've got it and it's done a work in our lives and so we'll hold on to it amen so I believe this is what Jesus life looked like and we see that because the scripture says he grew in wisdom and stature and in favor with God in Man how he proved himself as a Young Man showed himself to be a real Son of God Amen he was about the father's business business he was getting ready to fully Express what God had for him amen and it was a great mystery in his day and almost everyone missed it can you imagine those that got saved on the day of Pentecost when they realized they missed the opportunity to have a conversation with the word made flesh with their lord and savior their God that he walked amongst them and they crucified him what a shame most miss it most miss it but what Grace do we have what Mercy do we have that if we miss it yet he can still reveal it to True children amen but what a lost opportunity if we don't realize what's going on all around us they had all sorts of signs with Jesus he said look if you don't believe my words at least look at the works I do because they testify of me never a man's done what this man's doing but yet they missed it all but we see even what happened with them at the River Jordan and Mark 1 talks about it says and it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized of John and Jordan and straightway come up out of the water he saw the heavens opened and a spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from Heaven saying Thou Art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and the immediately the spirit driveth him into the Wilderness now I want to focus on verse 11 here quickly because this is a bit of a point of contention for many people including those inside this end time message because the phrasing there says that I am well pleased and we're taught that when God God says he's pleased with you that is the time of adoption but the time of adoption is not when he says he's pleased the time of adoption is when he takes you out for a ceremony because God is pleased with us throughout our lives as we come in alignment with his word as we submit ourselves to his word as we act on his word as we believe on his word that's pleasing to God but there's a time where he says I'm pleased enough I come to a place where I believe you're ready to be adopted amen and it would seem like this is the place of adoption where the father says you've met my requirement I'll adopt you and place you positionally but there's just a problem this is not the only time God says I'm well pleased and he says it later and he adds a phrase to it that shows adoption versus just pleasing God Amen and it's in a completely different circumstance under with a completely different aspect to it so watch how the prophet of God phrases it we we started this quote and I'm reading the next bit and then I'll read the next bit a little bit later he says now watch what God did when his son was born he let him go 30 years testing him trying him he says then he gave him 3 years of hard trial so it was tough for the first 30 but now he he ratchets up the pressure he makes things even more difficult why because he's got to know if that son can hold up to what's coming his way cuz the ultimate test is going to be to lay down your life to lay down your money to lay down your health to lay down your influence lay down whatever it is is that you value most the challenge is will you lay it down or will you rear up and use what God's given you to to preserve yourself amen he was pleased in Jesus enough to dwell in him but Jesus hasn't been fully proven and we know that because verse 12 says immediately the spirit driveth him into the Wilderness that word driveth means cast out expel in other words the spirit of God in Jesus forcibly took out into the desert for 40 days why to test him if the son is adopted why is he still being tested you can't be adopted and tested in that way adoption is after the testing doesn't mean you won't have trials and and difficult times but adoption is after you've proven yourself and here's the thing Jesus now is the fullness of the godhead bodily amen the spirit of God is in him without measure now he's got power the Holy Ghost is power remember Jesus said you had he told them the disciples he says go and wait until you be indued with power the Holy Ghost is power and it's authority Jesus now has been gone stay Stayed faithful to the word for 30 years but he had no Authority he had no power but now the Holy Ghost comes on him without measure now he has power and what has to happen with power character has to be proven amen so what happens God gives him power and what's the test now what are you going to do with it amen and he takes him out in the desert and Jesus has to win not by using his power Jesus overcomes in the in the wilderness by thus saith the Lord it is written it is written it is written no Supernatural power no Supernatural Authority he could have called 10,000 angels He could have done everything that Satan wanted him to do but he couldn't do it he had to completely defeat him by the word of God remember the prophet of God he says the word of God will defeat the enemy anywhere anytime that's it you stay with the word and that'll defeat him but remember what were the Temptations from Satan we're talking about Jesus coming to adoption the first was that he would use his power and authority for carnal needs he says make these stones into bread preserve yourself save your own life what did he come do he came to minister not to be ministered to brother Braham says I can't use my gift on myself it's for you it's not for me he could lay hands on somebody and God would honor the prayer of faith but he couldn't lay hands on himself and heal his own body why the gift was not for him and Jesus knew this gift is not for me and he proved it on the first Temptation then what did Satan try to do he tried to get him to prove who he was prove you're the Son of God if you are the Son of God then throw yourself down off the temple and they'll catch the angels will catch you you won't even stub your toe any of these things right it was to what let your pride respond to the challenge of the enemy that has nothing to do with it prophet of God said God doesn't play around God doesn't play around with his gifts God doesn't play around with his power we're not here to answer Satan's challenge we're here to take back our land if he's on our land we'll use the power and authority of God if he's out in his own kingdom leave him alone when he comes to us that's when we bug him that's when we're a pain in his neck but if he's going to stay out there leave him be that's not our kingdom that's his kingdom and then the third one was what he tried to get him to take the easier path to achieve his Earthly purpose he said if you'll bow and worship me I'll give you all the kingdoms I'll give you all the people in them you can save the world Jesus all you have to do is Bow Down and Worship me and Jesus said get thee behind me Satan defeated him by the word by the word by the word it is written it is written it is also written because remember Satan will use the word but he won't never use the full word because the full word will expose him every single time it'll expose the spirit that's behind him amen but we come back to this phrase of the father's business and Jesus has been preparing for it and now he's ready for it and he's passed his last test and you would say well then obviously he's ready to be adopted he's shown his character no now he's got to go use it according to the father's will he's proven he won't use it for himself but will he use it according to the father's will as he goes out there brother Brown would say this he says we find immediately after his temptation he went straight to the father's business he says what was the business preaching the gospel and Healing The Sick remember the scripture says where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Jesus had to go fulfill Isaiah 61 he had to do that that was part of the father's business but that was not his adopted position that's what a Son of God will do but that is not what the Son of God had to do it was just a portion of his ministry and he comes out of the desert and and and he immediately goes and and he turns the water into wine and then he goes and he heals the the dead boy of the Widow of Na and then he's going around and he goes and and and he goes into complete crowds of sick people and every single one of them are healed and demons are cast out and all these different things and the thing is that we look at that and we say well that's the actions of an adopted son of God no those are the actions of a Son of God see we lost it all Adam had all of that before we ever were here before sin ever came Adam could control control everything on this Earth and all Christ was doing was proving he was the second Adam he was proving who he was but he wasn't in his full position it was just a portion of his ministry he came to fulfill the word that was written about him for that time so he had to fulfill Isaiah 61 amen he had to come and and Free People from from prison he had to come and bind up the Brokenhearted he had to preach to the meek he had to do all these different things because that was a portion of the word written about him but that was not his ultimate goal that was not his ultimate reason and if that is the position of an adopted son then what do we do with the fact that the the the disciples did all of those works as well before the day of Pentecost they went out and they cast out demons and they healed the sick great signs and wonders following them before they were even converted Judas did it so the signs and wonders are not the proof of an adopted son of God it's proof of faith in the word of God and it's that simple because you will see false anointed ones that can operate the word of God by faith and God honors faith God honors Faith it's that simple you may not be a child of God but if you take him at his word he'll honor your faith and we'll see that in scripture but remember what Jesus said in Matthew 7 he says wherefore by their fruits you shall know them remember he told his disciples he says I've ordained you that you will have fruits and they'll remain it's a continuous thing it's a constant thing amen the Holy Ghost doesn't come and go you've got the fruits of the spirit all the time because the holy spirit's in you it's not just in church it's easy to be a Christian here it's a lot harder to be a Christian out there amen he says by their fruits you shall know them and not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven remember he's revealed to his children the mystery of his will it says many will say to me in that day many a lot most Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and he doesn't say no you didn't he just says then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity I loved how brother Andrew did it when he was here and he says there's a difference between meeting somebody and knowing somebody and he talked to brother Chad and he went up to brother Chad he said brother Chad do you know me well he says I met you what's your name Andrew what do you do you're a minister he says what else do I do I don't know how many kids do I have I don't know why cuz you don't know me and I don't know you that's the way it is with Christ see they'll take only the one element that they want and they forget about the entire relationship that's supposed to be coming in behind it and they're about their will their plan their purpose their gain their influence their Kingdom rather than the will of God Jesus says I never knew you I was never intimate with you we never had a relationship you just came and took what you wanted from this Kingdom and you went out and you abused it for your own sake you can put Judas there like I said you can put balam in this scripture you can put Caiaphas the high priest that prophesied accurately prophesied under the spirit and that was because he was in the high priest position a false anointed unsanctified vessel yet truly the spirit of God was on him but not in him remember the rain falls on the just and the unjust we can come in under the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit and there can be signs and wonders and prophecies and tongues and interpretation all of these different different things and that does not make you a Christian what makes you a Christian is that you've got a life that is according to the word of God Amen he continues he says notice him now the first thing he begin when he come out of the Wilderness he began to preach and to pray and heal the sick that's right he began with a great ministry of healing and not just Healing The Sick many people begin to come to him and he would pray and lay hands on them and they get well great things were accomplished in his ministry he came to minister but that was not his adopted position and for three years Jesus does this for three years he focuses on the service part of his ministry because he didn't just come to redeem our souls like I said he came to set the captives free to mend the Brokenhearted to preach Good Tidings to the meek there is all these scriptures that he had to fulfill before he comes into his adopted position but I want you to understand that being about the father's business does not mean you're adopted it means you're ready to be adopted it's a pre cursor to being adopted because you've got to prove yourself in the little things before he can give you the big things and to be in the little things you still have to be about the father's business you've still got to be showing yourself faithful to what he's asked you to do because adoption is placing you into a role of higher authority and higher responsibility but leading up to that you've got places of lower Authority and lower responsibility remember God will give you a little thing to see what you'll do with it and if you're Pro faithful in the little thing then he says he'll give you more adoption is the more but as a child of God he'll give you the little things and if you abuse it he'll just let you go with that and you'll never come to a higher level amen a son in those days could be a helper around the the farm he could be a stable helper a laborer he might even manage a small group of of men or laborers or something like that but to run the whole family business he had to prove himself in a lower role before he got the big role brother BR puts it this way he says but what if the child was a good child what if the child was just about the father's business then oh how gracious the tutor was he'd come he' say oh kind sir your child is just a chip off the old block he's just like you he's just he's only about your business you'll never find a better businessman for your kingdom here than that child and how the father must swell up and say oh that's my boy oh yes he's my son he said that to Jesus he says but how about that holy spirit standing in the presence of God and says this man he is a real son he's about your business he's not adopted but yet he's about your business he says so how do we say we're about his business this is his program preach the word preach means to speak and demonstrate in other words live it don't just talk it amen he says if I be lifted up I draw all men to me how that he must feel great and feel happy so a good son is already working in the father's business before he's adopted why he's proving himself faithful in the little things amen that's where the greatest testing and trying is amen because you remember he's been under tutors and they've been teaching him and giving him all this knowledge but now he's got to put all that knowledge into practice and prove he's got wisdom not just knowledge he's got to have understanding not just facts and data and these different things he's got to be able to take it and put it to use in the father's business now remember what Moses said Deuteronomy 18 Moses said this he says the Lord thy God shall raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy Brethren like unto me and then it has the semicolon there right a period of time and then it says like unto him shall you hearken so he's going to raise up a prophet like unto Moses and it's going to be for a period of time and then you're going to hear him in other words he's the one you're going to have to heed so we take that back to the scripture then we see that Jesus has a three-year Ministry proving he was the Fulfillment of Deuteronomy 18:15 he proved he was a prophet like unto Moses but he wasn't like unto Moses because a greater than Solomon is here a greater than Moses is here Moses as we said last service he failed in the Temptation when his temper got the better of him and he struck the rock twice instead of speaking to it for the water to come out and what did he do he elevated himself into God's position he took glory to himself and Aaron did as well and God says because you didn't glorify me before the people you can't go into the land amen Moses had Authority as a prophet and what did he do he abused it but God would not dishonor his prophet in front of the people but he judged them nonetheless sometimes what happens behind scenes is far worse than what happens out in front in public we see with Elisha he's a prophet he's got twice the anointing of Elijah and those young people come out and 42 children make fun of him and they make fun of his master Elijah that went up in a chariot of fire thou Baldhead thou Baldhead go up and in Anger what happens is he calls out two she bears and they kill them he failed in his authority he abused it his temper got the better of him Christ had to go there and he had to be rejected he had to be completely uh humiliated his family turned him down the ministry turned him down down so many turned him down they loved the the works but when he started to preach the word they all turned away he had to be completely rejected and not lose his temper not use his authority not use his power to what do something that would satisfy his feelings his human nature if I could put it that way Moses Authority was nothing compared to Jesus Authority and and what was the first thing that Satan challenged Jesus to do abuse his authority the first thing he did abuse it because that's how he got Moses and that's how he got so many was he had them abuse their power that's what he did with David David abused his power as king to take another man's wife he did it because he could do it and that's the challenge for every Son of God every daughter of God is what will you do with what God gives you will you use it for yourself will you use it to put people down we use it we can call judgment don't think for a second that we can't call judgment if they did in the old Testament there's no reason we can't do it here but what ought our response to be forgive them Father they know not what they do while there's Mercy let's offer Mercy to every single one amen but Jesus had to walk around for three years of hard trial scorned rejected harassed unappreciated how frustrating must that be the fullness of the godhead bodily and nobody appreciates what you're doing you go and you heal people by the thousands maybe the tens of thousands for all we know and in the end they walk away and then what did God do though he saw that that body was subject to the spirit and it proved itself and it had humbled itself and it had surrendered itself and we see in Mark 9 the response it says and he said unto them Jesus speaking says verily I say unto you that there shall be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death until they have seen the kingdom of God come with power now what is the kingdom of God we've said this before Jesus said to Nicodemus he said the kingdom of God is within you it's the Holy Ghost it's the new birth amen it is literally the life of God producing a life of the word of the hour inside of a human body it is God in surrendered unselfish humble human flesh that's what the kingdom of God is in power and it says after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter James and John and leadth them up unto an high mountain apart by themselves now I'm going to jump over to Matthew 17 because it gives us more detail than the other Gospels it says and he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elias and while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased we've heard that before in the River Jordan When the Spirit came down but now it says hear ye him remember what Moses said he says there's going to be a prophet like unto me unto him will ye hearken here's the Bible saying hearken unto him hear him listen to what he says now amen so adoption is not just receiving the Holy Ghost it can't be else God would have what not held back some Authority from Jesus but we see here he held back some Authority he didn't say hear ye him at Jordan he said hear ye him after three more years of even harder testing and trying and proving and only then did he say he speaks for me that's the only time he could do it why because there was a perfect tested Unity there I and my father are one I do nothing except the father shows me will my meat is to do my father's will he was perfectly surrendered to the spirit of God inside of him amen and what did God say God said he speaks for me whatever he says I'll back it up whatever he says I'll do whatever he says is right whatever he says is the word why because the word was there the word was made flesh and the word could only speak the word we know these things he says I'm in him he's fully surrendered he speaks for me listen up brother B puts it this way he says and when he came to the place of coming of age the father saw the son had progressed progressed amen and he was a worthy boy everything he did was right and he was right up with the father's business he wanted everything just right for the father and he had no selfish motives that's a lot see he's given the Holy Ghost but he's got to prove how is he going to use it so he says he was right with the father's business he wanted everything just right for the father and he had no selfish motives then the father took the son out into a public place and the father took the very son that was born in his family and adopted his own son that's what Ephesians said we're adopted predestinated to the adoption of sons by Christ in other words he adopted him he placed his son positionally how did he do it he says then that son's name on the check was just as good as the fathers because he was in position the father had Vindicated and had placed that son in position he says I hope you're getting this and then that son was an heir of what the father had and we are what God has we're joint airs with Christ if we are sons of God positionally placed in the kingdom and holding our places holding our places I can't be in yours and you can't be in mine but we've got to be in our places he says now watch what God did now he's speaking about what happened on Mount Transfiguration when his son was born he let him go 30 years testing him trying him this is the quote I've read twice but I'm opening it up each time then he gave him three years of hard trial and then at the end of the hard trial when he saw his son was about the father's business Mount Transfiguration The Book of Luke he took Peter James and John three Witnesses and went up on top of the mountain and there God performed the laws of adoption they looked up and they saw Jesus and his clothes shined as white as the lightning and a cloud overshadowed him and a voice come out of the cloud and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him all sit down now and have no more to say what he says is Law and Truth now I'll be honest I've always struggled with the idea of what was jesus' position of adoption because if you look at his actions they look like the actions before this of an adopted son of God today that's what we would expect generally speaking an adopted son of God to do was to go and continue the works of Christ amen we look at those those great signs and wonders he did and we say that's what God is doing that's what God does in our lives that's what adopted sons and gods do but we forget that adoption is about positional placing it is not about signs and wonders it's about being in your position and then whatever he wants you to do that's what you do which includes signs and wonders absolutely 100% but don't confuse the signs and wonders with being in position again Judas had signs and wonders balam had signs and wonders so that is not the proof of it the disciples had signs and wonders and they weren't even converted yet they were without the Holy Ghost and denied Christ so the signs and wonders is not the proof of adoption it can be a part of adoption but just because you got signs and wonders following does not mean that you're a son that you're an adopted child of God Amen it's about Authority it's not about a public show it's not about a public show and you'll see what Jesus does is as he comes into this now he's just talking to the disciples and he pulls them aside and he's telling them all the things that are going to happen he's not telling it to the rest of the world he's only telling it to his children he's only telling it to the elect amen so signs and one ERS can be a a sign of an adopted son and daughter of God but it's not definitive amen we don't want to throw those things out of course we don't we want everything God has for us if I'm in Christ I want everything that Christ has for me in my position but I want to be in my position more than I want to have those things because that's where I can be a blessing that's where I can be of of good to the kingdom of God he says then he takes him out to a certain place the father does and he sets him up in a high place like this and he has a ceremony and they all come around and he said I want everyone to know that this is my child and I adopt my son and I want anyone to know from henceforth that his name I dress him up a special dress on him I want you to know that his name is just as good on any check as my name is he's my child I adopt him into my family although he's been my son since he was born it doesn't change his bloodline but it changes his position since he received the Holy Ghost he's been my son he says but now I'm going to place him positionally in Authority what he fires is fired and what he hires is hired notice he puts a separation between receiving the Holy Ghost and positional placing he says and I'll read this quote probably in the next verice brother brah says you've got the Holy Ghost but I'm talking about adoption he makes it very clear that those two are not necessarily one and the same they can be as we'll see when we go on the scriptures but just because you got the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you're adopted how could it be he goes into a he goes into uh you know Macedonia or these different places he goes into a place where it's raw heathens and they get the Holy Ghost and you're telling me that can be an adopted son of God how can it they haven't been proven to be adopted you've got to be proven you've got to be tested you got to be tried and you can't hear the word one time and that be your proof for testing because many follow Jesus until the real word came and then they fell away it takes a Time adoption requires a time of proving amen but he says what he fires is fired and what he hires is hired you want to know who has auth in a business they're the ones that hire and fire the people that just manage that things and manage people and situation no no no it's the ones that hire and fire those are the ones with real Authority that's where the buck stops is the ones that bring people on and put people out amen so it's not just casting out demons and Healing The Sick amen this is authority to speak and things happen and it's a completely different thing amen Judas never had that but Peter had it John had it and Paul had it why adopted sons of God they went all the way with the word they proved themselves they stayed there until they got power and their character was proven to use that power appropriately amen this isn't just Faith now this is Authority because you know who you are and that you are where you're supposed to be and you're about the father's business perfectly amen his actions are your actions his words are your words his thoughts are your thought his will is your will and so when you speak it's him speaking it's him thinking it's him doing and so what happens things move things change that's what it means to be an adopted son or daughter of God Amen Jesus had all the important elements of of an adopted son early but that's not adoption adoption is when you're placed into position amen it's not just being about the father's business it's about proving yourself in the father's business so he can place you in your real position which is in a place of authority but I had struggled with what is Jesus Authority or what was position of authority what was his positional placing and I had searched the scriptures and it's there in in hindsight it seems so obvious but I searched a message and and brother brand would say time and time again that he adopted him on Mount Transfiguration but adoption is always positional placing and my question was what is the positional place then what was different about Christ after the mount Transfiguration than before what Authority did he have but after that he didn't have before I came across this quote And as far as I know it's the only one where explains this it says but before Peter got through speaking about those three different Tabernacles you notice God wouldn't let a denomination start that's what he stopped there he stopped a denomination that's how quick our unsanctified unconverted thinking does things will start a denomination at the drop of a hat Peter the man that's going to have the keys to the kingdom is trying to start a denomination right here it says but before Peter got through speaking about those three different Tabernacles The Voice spoke out of glory and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him Moses was gone the laws gone the prophets are gone but this is my beloved Son hear ye him no matter where you are hear ye him no matter what anything says what mama says what papa says what the law says what anything else says hear ye him he says he is the Everlasting voice God positionally plac him as your mediator as your father as your God he said this is my beloved Son hear ye him this is the fullness of adoption remember he says this is the kingdom of God coming with power this is Jesus showing us what our full adoption looks like because he's standing up there and what does he have a glorified body remember what Paul says he says we grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the Redemption of the body the fullness of the adoption is a glorified body Jesus is standing there the fullness of the godhead bodily full of the Holy Ghost and what does he have a glorified body what's he showing he's showing us the fruits of the resurrection and the Rapture he's showing us the fullness of the Holy Ghost I spoke of this at sister Ed Brenton's F funeral that what she saw up there remember what what brother braham's wife saw up there and then what he saw when he went there he looked around he saw all these people on the other side of time in glory and he said what is this and the voice said this is the Holy Ghost this is what you preached about this is the fullness of adoption this is the fullness of the Gospel as you back in position in a glorified body restored to full Fellowship that's what this is so Christ is showing this here and he's showing us the the glorified body he's showing us the position that we have amen that when we leave this body whether it's by death or by a rapture we receive that glorified body brother Braham says this as we start to close he says and first thing you know they looked and Jesus was glorified before them what did he do he dressed him in the robe of immortality what the fullness of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the Holy Ghost is a restoration back to your full position in Christ it's eternity it's eternal life it's it's the life of God in you brother BR would would talk about this robe and he'd say he would be robed in the Holy Ghost in the fullness of it see what am I robed in today I'm filled with the Holy Ghost but I'm robed in flesh that's the problem Christ was robed in immortal morality it was a glorified body we're robed in flesh this is the thing that has to give way to an immortal body a glorified body a holy ghost body amen it's a body that's built for eternity and he said his reignment shine like the sun and a cloud overshadowed them and Peter and John and them fell on their face and they looked and there stood Moses and Elijah talking to him and Moses had been dead and buried in an unmarked grave for 800 years and Elijah took a chariot ride to Heaven 500 years before that what were they telling him Church you know the scripture tells us what they talked about it says that they were telling him what was to happen in Jerusalem they were telling him what was going to happen and what it would accomplish his position is mediator his position is now Redeemer he's coming into the Lamb of God that's what he's coming in remember he's going to come back as a lion he's only a lamb as long as there's mercy and he's coming here as the lamb he's coming to give his life he's coming to redeem his lost bride and so what they're doing is they're saying you've got to go to Jerusalem now now is the time and we see after this that the scripture says and Jesus turned his face toward Jerusalem they had told him here's what you're doing you're an adopted son now you got to go do exactly what you were brought here to do and he turns his face towards Jerusalem and that's how he that's how he tells the disciples everything that's going to happen to him in detail is because they've told him now this is exactly what's going to happen but what were they saying they're saying this is the word that's written now you've got to fulfill it but realize there's joy at the end of it he knew the scripture says for the joy that awaited him he did it he got a revelation of exactly what was going to happen and he turned his face to Jerusalem and what did he do he accepted his purpose we read it in the communion scriptures so many times we don't read it but maybe we do but remember Jesus says scripture says and Jesus knowing the father had given all things things into his hands and that he had come from God and went back to God all things he didn't have to go to calary Calvary as in he had a choice but being the word made flesh he had to fulfill the word so he couldn't do it but he surrendered himself to it and if you want to know how hard that struggle was even in the Garden of Gethsemane he says if it's possible don't make me do this and he prays three times and on the third time he says father not my will but thine be done that's the man talking but the god in him was the one that was taking him all the way through amen where we at the robe of immortality it says they were there but few they were still there there where they were talking to him see he had taken up Jesus to see them to see what it was all about this is what we were just talking about to see what was going on it was giving Jesus a preview of what awaited him after this horrible death after this horrible 3 days he was going to go through it says they taken Jesus up to see them to see what it was all about to see there and show him these things and they talk with him and had a conversation with him then as soon as Peter looked back again and the glorification was off of Jesus they saw Jesus only and a voice come from the cloud and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him his name's just as good as mine now hear ye him he says that's it adopted or placed Sons like I said this was the Lamb of God position before this he's that that chain breaking jail busting sin killing disease healing demon removing delivering Son of God but now he's stepping into his ultimate role and it's to lay down his life now his power is found in surrender not in kicking out Satan his power is in now completely yielding himself to the will of the father even to the giving up of his life and having faith in the word that was in him that he would rise again on the third day his overcoming power was to overcome himself at that point in a way that nobody else will do these days it was to use his power and position to pay a penalty for us to restore us back to our position see the confusion with us is that our role is not mediator and so we look at his Works before his adoption and say well that's what I'm going to do as an adopted son that's what I'm going to do as an adopted daughter no no no that's just what sons of gods can do but your role doesn't look like his and so his looks it's far greater and so what he had to go through is is way worse than anything will'll have to because he had to be brought to a place of total surrender where he would lay down his physical life in expectation that if he didn't rise there was going to be problems cuz remember if he died and didn't rise we're still lost cuz the power that's in him has to come into us that's a resurrecting power that's a rapturing power amen and the signs and the Wonders they were all a part of it but let me say it this way if he only did the Miracles we'd still be lost today amen if all he did was come and heal the sick and and make the blind see and make the lame walk we'd still be lost so the signs and wonders are not the signs of an adopted son but it was his Redemptive position that made him an adoptive son and that's what brought us back to our place even today amen we get the Holy Ghost like they did on the day of Pentecost our works tend to look like his before his adoption why cuz we're to continue his work what was it Mark 16 go you into all the world preach the gospel in my name you cast out Devils if you lay if any are sick in you you lay hands on them anoint them with oil and all these different things if any deadly thing bites you or you drink it it won't harm you that's a continuation of the works of Christ but his work was to give his life ours is to take his life and live Amen to continue his Works among each each and every one of us remember we talked last service we said God wants to Express his attributes fully that's what adoption is is the expression of the attribute of God inside you it's the word of God living out in your life specifically according to what he's placed in your life and you're going to look different than I'm going to look and I'm going to look different than the next one and the next one and the next one because we each have positions and places God's a god of variety just like a body is a there ain't nothing the same on this even two legs aren't exactly the same amen everything here is for purpose and it's the same thing for the body of Christ what happened was he was the fullness of the godhead bodily Christ was and on the day of Pentecost he poured that fullness into the church and now we are his body we're continuing his Works amen we're continuing to fulfill the word for our day what is it's the thoughts of God coming into fruition in human flesh and you've got to be able to see the same God in you that you put in Christ you've got to be able to recognize that you're just as much a part of the word as he was and that you've got the same power and authority backing you up backing you up in your position as a son and daughter of God Amen let's stand together if we would what's God waiting for to the time where he can trust us fully where we've got a proven character a surrendered heart a nature that yields to the Holy Spirit that's what he had to prove with Jesus is that he would yield to the Holy Spirit and he never laid a foot wrong we lay our feet wrong we go down paths we get flustered and frustrated sometimes amen but that's what the blood of Christ is there for that covers Us from all these things but God's bringing us to a place we don't have full Authority like Christ did we've got Authority commensurate with our position but our position is to be in the word of God it's to take every word that he gives us and stand on it and say that belongs to me and you got enough power and authority to enforce that anytime anywhere amen amen God bless you this evening let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how beautiful is your word Lord how beautiful are your promises Lord how great is your plan your vision Lord your purpose for it and Lord all we are trying to do is just catch that little part that's meant for each one of us Lord I pray

chose us and Lord when you chose us you placed us you ordained us Lord as Sons and Daughters of God Lord help us to realize it Lord as just every day Lord it seems like things are opening up more and more Lord but things are closing down in this world Lord time is coming to a halt I pray you help us to see the hour we're living in Lord let us be more serious than ever before Lord and even as Paul
