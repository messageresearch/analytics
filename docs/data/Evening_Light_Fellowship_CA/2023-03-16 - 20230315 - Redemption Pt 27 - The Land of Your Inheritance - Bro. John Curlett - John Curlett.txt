thank you for your presence Lord we thank you for your promise that we're two or three are gathered there you be in the midst of us Heavenly Father so Lord we're praying Lord that in this little group tonight Lord in this little message you've given me Lord that you would speak to our hearts and souls Lord that you would encourage us along the way Lord that you would help us to Lord not let Satan deny us of any promise or Lord anything that you've given us in your word heavenly father but that we would step forward in Faith Lord that we would hold that sword of the word in our hands Lord and that we push back everything that would hold us back from what you've given us Lord God while remembering the many needs Lord many sick not able to be here tonight Lord those that are traveling Lord and and leaving potentially tomorrow Lord Brother Joshua and sister Rochelle or we pray your grace especially for them Heavenly Father Lord just Minister and be with us now we pray and in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you if you turn and you would and to Deuteronomy chapter 8. amen certainly appreciate sister Priscilla being instant in season and coming in and playing I don't think the bass guitar is something that generally we want to just have on its own up here on the platform so certainly appreciate that it makes all the difference amen it really does to have that there so we very thankful for that we're very thankful uh I know that we've we've seen the email and most of us know but for those that are listening online maybe don't know that the church purchase has finally been finalized and it is ours as much as it can be until we pay off the mortgage but certainly it's been a tremendous Miracle to get it done as quickly as it did it couldn't happen soon enough for us I think but we're trusting the Lord was in it and as brother Bob has shared that he's removed many barriers and made things happen and given us grace and favor and financing these different things we've had quite a bit of money given to us and and perhaps we'll share some of those details later but not today or myself but we've had so many people that have in churches and pastors and individuals that have just reached out and said we'd like to give and when they heard of the need and they heard of the opportunity they just stepped right up to the plate and there's even probably more coming so we're we're certainly thankful to that that we are part of a body that we're not just isolated here on the East Coast on this this this Rocky island but there's a whole body of Christ out there that's feeding in and and supporting us in this amen so certainly thankful for that and kind of along that note I I did speak to a minister this weekend or this week about coming to visit us and Minister for us in the next month or two so he'll get back to me hopefully in the next week and give me an idea of if he can or when he can and when he does that then then we'll we'll have our first special meetings in this building and I've got to talk to the trustees make sure that we don't interfere with the renovations and the painting and these things but just so you know it's been on our art to have special means for quite some time but with all the things in limbo and the buildings and changes and and whatnot we didn't really feel that we could do that very well so but hopefully in the next month or two we'll have special meetings and and that'll kind of season four so be in prayer for that amen amen Deuteronomy chapter eight I do I don't apologize but I know this has been a common verse I preached on it a couple weeks or a couple Services ago and then brother Gerald used it on on on the last service and and now I'm here using it again but it it ties into to so many things and so I want to just read these these four verses here to start us off this evening Deuteronomy 8 verse 7 says for the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land a land of Brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and Hills a land of Wheat and barley and Vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of oil olive and honey a land wherein Thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack anything in it a land whose Stones our iron and out of whose will whose Hills thou mayest dig brass when the highest eaten and are full then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee amen God bless you you can have your seats may he bless the reading of his word this evening and I I I I I've been dwelling on some things for so long that you almost start to forget what you've preached and what you haven't preached and and this is kind of a service to to maybe look forward to we're not we've spent so much time in the desert and the dreariness and the trials and the struggles and all these things and it's kind of like they you know you're trying to get job off the ash Heap you know and and so the this this evening I want to take a thought of the land of your inheritance and this will be a good service this will be a land where we talk about prophecies and we talk about the promises and the good things of God and whatnot so it's a Wednesday night it's a it's going to be a shorter service so just settle in and relax and get ready to enjoy and and hear about what God has prepared for us amen amen we've uh you know you look back in history and we've had 2 000 years since Christ came and Christ came and he gave the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and we had a lot and then what happened is we lost a lot and we went from from the peak of uh of the Believers and and whatnot and we went down into kind of the Valley of the shadow of death through the the church ages and almost nobody believed and and there was almost nothing happening and and now we're building back to what they had on that first day of Pentecost amen and it's it's not just speaking in tongues and it's not just these things but it's a life lived and it's a relationship with Christ and it's a Oneness that we're being restored back to amen and this time once we get it we'll hold on to it all the way into eternity amen there'll be no losing it after we get it in its fullness amen so we're going to talk about possessions this evening we're going to talk about promises we're going to talk about prophecies we're going to talk about what God has written for you the believer for the child of God for the elect for the predestinated and I want to start with that that first verse there because this is a this is a type and Shadow here and and and we'll do types and shadows mostly today and then maybe the Lord willing on Sunday we'll get into what he has for us specifically in this age but I just want to use this and kind of dig into this a bit and maybe teach a bit tonight on what God has prepared for us the land of our inheritance and verse 7 says for the Lord that God bringeth thee into a good land just right there you could almost preach all service he brings you into a good land what God has in front of you is good though you may not be able to see it or understand it in its fullness it is a good land and he says it's a land of Brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and Hills now to to someone in Newfoundland when you start talking about it's a place full of water we think I would like maybe perhaps a little less water because we don't have the idea of what it means to be in a desert but if you go to somebody maybe from Arizona or California or even areas of Texas and you say I'm going to bring you into a land full of water and Brooks and springs that are springing up and pushing out of the land they'd say hallelujah and praise the Lord and you've got to think that the children of Israel when they heard this that that had an effect on them because they've been walking you know for 40 years in a desert and I don't know if you know this but a desert is dry a desert doesn't have a lot of greenery it doesn't have a lot of crops it's mostly dust and rocks and lizards that's all that's there so when God comes and he says this is a good land full of water I imagine there is a bit of rejoicing there because they've been going through a journey where they had to skimp and they had to scrape and they had to save and they had to ration their water to make sure that they could get through from day to day and he's saying I'm bringing you now to a place where you don't have to scream you don't have to hold back you don't have to ration because as much as you can take as much as you can use as much as you can put inside of you there's always going to be more available to you this isn't a land of survival is what we're talking about you survive a desert but he's talking about a land where they'll Thrive amen where there's more there's an abundance there's above and beyond what they could ask or think available for them amen so I want you to understand that this is what the promises of God look like is that they are not held back they are not rationed to us but it is always an abundance it's exactly what we have need of to meet our needs and then there's some Beyond and above what we can do that amen notice here it says Brooks of water and Brooks are great but we know Brooks are just little thin streams and there's maybe not a lot there but then he says fountains and then he says there's depths that spring out of the valleys and Hills you know what that means that means they're not seasonal means that there isn't a time where there's water and then there's a time where there's not water but it means that there's a source there there's a place where there is an internal pressure that is constantly taking that water and delivering it to where you need it that you always have access to that water because it's not dependent on the ups and the Dows and the ins and the outs but it's available because there is a constant Source that's pushing it towards you and it's throughout the entire land it's not that your brother has it and you don't or your sister has it and you don't but each and every one of us has a land where there is a fountain there's a springing Out of Water that's available for our needs that we have amen it reminds me of the woman that Jesus met at the well outside of that City and she'd had five husbands she was living common law with a man who was not her husband she was a reject to society and when you say a reject to society in a gentile world that's a pretty bad person this is a woman that's of ill repute she's a fallen nature and she's got a life behind her to prove it and she comes to Jesus at the wall and she'd been walking a desert road for a very long time and she was coming to a wall and she was coming there in the middle of the day in the Hop time of the day because she couldn't come in the cooler the morning or the evening because that's when the women that were that were of good reputation would come there and she wasn't allowed to associate with them but you notice what happens when Jesus meets her there and after he talks to her world what does he offer her he offers her water and if you look at the words that he uses you'll see he's pointing back to Deuteronomy 8 when he does it and the bait on the hook for her was a water that would quench her thirst and it says in John 4 14 he says but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I give him shall be in him in him a well of water doing what dribbling out tap on tap off no it says a well of water springing up into everlasting life listen God doesn't say things by circumstance and Jesus is not using those words springing up just Loosely or by coincidence he's pointing us and he's telling this woman he said you may have heard of a land that's full of a well of water that Springs up you may have seen the promise to Moses and the children of Israel but what's standing in front of you is a New Covenant and it's bringing a new water and it's bringing a new source and once you get that you'll never thirst for the things that have destroyed your life thus far it'll take you off this desert road and it'll bring you into a land of fulfillment that's what he promised to her amen what's he saying he's saying don't look for the water that was promised back there recognize the water that's standing in front of you today and it's not just the word of God but it's the person of the word of God standing here and it's here to quench your thirst so that those natural things that have destroyed your life that have held you back that have hindered your relationships that have pulled you away from society he says that will be resolved if you can take care and accept this water that's standing before you today listen Church she didn't know she had the seed of God inside of her she didn't know it she was a fallen woman if there was a woman that was destined for hell looking from the outside it was this woman adultery six times five times over six times over messed up but yet there was something inside of her that when that water came her way she caught a hold of it and she said this is different and when she tasted and she accepted that water it changed her life and she left her water pot behind and she went in and thousands of people in that City got saved because of her testimony and came to receive that water themselves amen listen David opens up the book of Psalms with these wonderful scriptures the first three scriptures of Psalms one and he's talking about what it means to be a child of God somebody that has chosen and he says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sinneth in the seed of the scornful now you don't start like that I want you to recognize as we go through this it says but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night why because he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper notice it doesn't say he just landed there that a man or a woman a son or a daughter a child of God does not just land where they are but they are planted in a place where they will bring forth fruit and it's always by water and we'll see why that is because water we know is a type of the word of God there's many types of the word of God and we'll get into some of them this this evening but the way the the lord always plants his children by a place where they can receive the word of God because that's what gives us our growth that's what keeps us pointed that's the thing that keeps giving us the nutrients that we need but as I was studying this we so often focus on water for thirst but you'll see that water is not just for thirst and to satisfy your body and keep you alive but it's there to wash you it's there to keep you clean it's there to take away the things that would get on you throughout your day and these different things it's there to put you in a state that you're presentable and acceptable as well brother Brandon will talk about this and he talked about the Waters of separation and I love how in Deuteronomy 8 verse 1 God says you can't come to me and say that I can't be separated because the Waters of Separation are always available to you they didn't have to ration they couldn't say well I had to drink it therefore there's no Waters of Separation today but he put him in a land where there's enough water there to keep them clean to keep them separate from the things of the world to take off those things that we get as we're walking through this Earth I talked a bit about my experiences in Vancouver you know and just the filth and the mess that's there are maybe more pronounced in here but the simple fact is if you are a God-fearing man or woman no matter what as you walk through this world you're going to see you're going to hear and you're going to experience things that you're not supposed to see here or experience listen you can't go through a mall you can't go on your phone you can't surf the Internet you can't be around worldly people without something crossing your way and guess what some of it sticks from time to time and you need water of the washing of the word to come in and say don't let that stay in your life and what he promised in Deuteronomy 8 is that he wouldn't just satisfy your thirst but he'd give you water to keep you clean as well the washing of Water by the word God provided them not just a way to live but he provided a way for them to live clean and holy brother Brown would say this he said notice now what was the water of Separation a type of he said the water of Separation was the type of the word of God the word he says now I believe it's over in Ephesians in the fifth chapter it said that he might sanctify and cleanse us with the washing of the Water by the word see washing of the water of Separation by the word and in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and became he said you see it the water of separation we've got to understand what Christ was and I was dwelling on this today and it's not in my notes at all but you've got to recognize that they called him Jesus the Christ why because he was the anointed one and he was anointed for purpose and the thing is if you're in him and you're with him then you've got to be anointed as well and so he says he became the water of Separation he was anointed to separate us from our sin from our nature and you were then taking on that anointing to become what he took in your place he took you so that you could become him and he said Christ became the water of Separation it puts your sin aside from you and then he starts to wash you and change you so that you don't have to deal with what you had all this time in your life he says amen everything that Christ died for and promised in his word is yours as freely as the water runs for if you have a sin apply the word wash it don't run from it sit under the washing of the word he says and apply it it's the water of Separation what is it the blood covers it so that it can't be attributed to us but God's trying to get that sin out of our life the sin nature the sin habit the sin inclination and that happens under the preaching of the word which is the washing of Water by the word now listen to this this is beautiful he says now the water of Separation separates you from sin but look how far he carries it he says if you are weary apply the water of the word this is a powerful Water Church if you are sick apply the water of the word for it separates us from sickness it separates us from sin it separates us from weariness it separates us from every attribute that sin produced he says oh I love it for he has washed us and cleansed us through the washing of the Water by the word and separated us unto himself of believing people that set aside from the world to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ why that he might manifest himself to the outside world through the Holy Spirit operating through this inside of the blood cell Church what ought that to do for us today because we sit there and we say I'm stuck in limbo I I can't seem to get any traction I'm struggling I'm fighting and he's pointing us to a land where the water meets every need that we have that it washes us it cleans us it meets our thirst it does everything to Keep Us Alive and moving forward amen it keeps you every wit clean and ready and presentable for his presence then he continues in verse 8 and he says it's a land of Wheat and barley and Vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of oil olive and honey I notice it always says Royal Olive not olive oil and I'm not sure why it does that but it's consistent throughout the scripture but what is what stands out about this is that everything that you need to live and enjoy life is right here because those days they didn't have grocery stores the way we do and we didn't have airplanes and refrigerated trucks to bring things up from Mexico or from BC or Texas or California throughout the year you had to have something that would last you year round and so certain crops you can't have lettuce and keep lettuce for six months or a year until the next crop grows and these different things but you'll notice that he opens up with wheat and barley and that's for a reason because these are sustenance crops and wheat is the universal food it'll feed people it'll feed animals and if you have wheat and you have water you can survive indefinitely it has a little bit of protein has lots of carbohydrates it has lots of energy if you have wheat which can make bread and you have water then you can live pretty much forever may not be healthy we need our vegetables these different things but this was really considered the the requirements for life was you have bread and you have water and so that's what he opens up with and it was interesting brother Tim Pruitt was sharing with a bunch of us brothers and he's been he preached on it for a while and he was talking about how the wheat is so often attacked by a fungus and I looked up some pictures of what this looks like and it's interesting because when you look in the scriptures Satan is always attacking the wheat remember Jesus preached the parable of of the sower and it was the wheat and what attacks the wheat he's got birds in there and he's got cares of life and he's got rocky ground and there's no depth to the person's relationship with God and these different things and then you look at the parable of of the wheat field and what happens is he sows good seed good wheat seed and then somebody comes in and sows Bad Seed with it why to try and choke out the wheat to kill it so he's always trying to attack what the wheat the food source he's always trying to if he can't kill it he's trying to corrupt it and brother Bradham preached extensively on this fungus because so often we focus on the tares that are next to us but he says you've got to be aware of the fungus that gets in there because the worst of these fungi can kill you if you ingest it and was that a representation of its representation of if we're not preached and receiving the pure word of God it's tainted and it only brings death that's why we're not a denomination because every denomination has put a period behind what they believe about the word but we preach from an Open Bible an open scripture because that's the only way God can work with us and give us a pureness of the word in our lives amen we know that you can take wheat and you can turn it into bread and that again is a type of the word of God and Jesus talked about this in his ministry and it says in John 6 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world you look at his words here and it reminds me of when he was talking to the woman at the well because he says I've got different water than you're used to Jacob dug this well and Moses provided you bread but he says I've got water that Jacob didn't dig for and now he says here there's a bread that Moses couldn't give you either and he says it's a person this bread of life is a person it's not just an idea it's not just something that happened in the past but it's a supernatural bread and it's standing in front of you right now and I think you'll find in these things is that the issue is not does it exist is there water to quench your thirsts is there bread of life to satisfy the question is not does it exist but the question is will you accept it because it was standing in front of them and how many times did Jesus prove that he was the bread of life listen he raised the dead multiple times he healed the sick he delivered and cast people and cast out demons from them he proved over and over and over again that there was a life there was a Wellspring inside of him of Supernatural power and yet he stands in front of them and look at what they say they said unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread give it to us and keep giving it to us is what they said and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst so they said Lord give it to us and then he says I am it and then what did they do walked away like I said the question is not does it exist the question is will you accept it because what happens so often is that we say Lord this is what I need this is what I want and we neglect to take what he has laid right before us the Simplicity of the word the humility of the word simple obedience and we turn it down because we want something of our own making he says if you come to me he says then you'll never hunger and you'll never thirst and you'll be amazed that people can read this Bible and one can read it and they can read it and they can go a week on one scripture and then somebody can sit there and they can read an entire book in there and they walk out the door and they trip up on their own selves and they fall almost immediately why because one ate it and one read it that's the difference is that one took it and made it a part of themselves and the other one just had a mental conception and it got stuck in their mind and it wasn't put into action in their life it didn't sink deep down into their soul and so when the time comes that that the push is on and the pressure's on then they fall because they haven't eaten it it's not a part of them there's nothing to sustain them and in their weakness they fall into temptation or these different things amen but I want you to understand as we go through and these are types and shadows and we're just doing types and shadows this evening we'll get into what it means for us specifically in this age but I want you to see that that God has provided not only for their needs here but he's provided for their wants as well and as we look at the next thing we see that he said that there was Vines there and those Vines were for grapes and we know that the grapes were for wine to drink and we know as we've been taught in this message that wine represents the stimulation of Revelation now we may have some Concepts about what the stimulation of Revelation looks like but the prophet of God tells us that it represents what happens when you truly see what God has been talking about when you when it becomes a reality and it drops down into your soul and it anchors there by the word of faith and it stays there and it cannot be moved no matter what happens that's when you see the stimulation of Revelation brother Brown says this he says you see the wine represents stimulation of Revelation and when the Holy Ghost fell and they seen the fire of God fall upon them my that begin to stimulate them and the first thing you know they got so stimulated till all the people actually thought they were drunk but they were stimulated stimulated by the Revelation he says here it is he says here's what stimulated them God's Vindicated Revelation made plain to them they were happy about it God promised it here it was revealed to them and Vindicated to them amen here was a man standing there saying this is that this is it and he's pointing to to Joel 2 28 where he says I'll pour out my spirit on my sons and daughters and these different things he says this is what stimulated them is when the word of God was happening in their life and they could place it in scripture and they could say praise the lord it's finally happened what he promised is finally coming to pass now listen a revelation from God can strike and it may not come to pass immediately but when it comes from God and you accept it as from God and it anchors into your heart you can praise in that moment that's what the simulation of revelation will do but it'll carry you forward until you see it a reality in your life there's no greater stimulation than when you believed and you confessed and you've stayed impatience and you stayed in obedience and then it happens when you prayed about it and you prayed about it and you've waited and you've trusted and then it happens that gives you stimulation that makes you raise your hand and shout and praise and cry and do all of these things you're reminded of when my sister Atlanta when it struck her that she was healed of cancer she got the stimulation of Revelation and she ran around that church raising her hands and shouting and dancing and praying God why because it struck her that by his stripes I am healed and it's a finished work listen maybe it wasn't at that moment she got healed maybe it was I don't know but in that moment she got the stimulation and that was made real to her and she knew that it is finished at that moment and whether she went to the doctor and got a clean bill of health the next day the next week or the next month that was her moment of Victory because the stimulation of the true revelation of the healing of God had struck her and she knew that it's a finished work amen that's the time where she said this is it this is it this is what it means by his stripes I am healed she had a personal revelation for she had an experience for it amen brother Brian will continue and he says now the power of Revelation brings stimulation to the believer he says for the power of wine natural wine is to stimulate see it's to bring a person that's all slumped down to a stimulation he says well then now there is a power of the revelation of the word that gives stimulation of Joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction to the believer the stimulation that it's Vindicated and it's proved he says so then the first thing you know it had to become a reality he's talking about in the upper room they waited on their Ministry for the word to be Vindicated and when you come to seek the Holy Spirit you do the same wait for it to be Vindicated he said yes you can accept it by faith you have to accept Christ by faith that's exactly right and you accept the Holy Spirit by faith he says but then let the Holy Spirit come and give the circumcision as a witness that he has accepted your faith you see then he points back to the abrahamic Covenant he says and see Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness he says but God gave him the sign of circumcision as a confirmation that he had accepted his faith there was something had to happen in Abraham's life to reflect the promise of God to show that his faith had been accepted and brother Brian says so that's the same thing we must do we must wait on the Holy Spirit until it's done something not necessarily because we spoke in tongues not because we've danced or we got emotional and we shouted he says until we were changed until something actually happened I don't care what form it comes in just so it happened that's the main thing because the danger is is that in the presence of God in the presence of the holy spirit in the atmosphere of a service wherever it might be that you get stimulated by emotion and you have a shouting experience you have a dancing experience you have an expression of some sort and you believe that is your proof that you've been sealed with the Holy Ghost don't reject the emotion that'll kill a Believer if you can't praise God if you can't bask in his presence if you can express yourself to him but those things might be from God but don't stop there is what he's saying don't turn it down don't hold it back let it flow through you express it experience it but he says you accept it by faith but make sure you've actually been changed before you go around claiming you've got the Holy Ghost rest on what a changed life that aligns you with the word of God not a changed Voice or a freedom in the spirit that allows you to shout and dance and do these different things listen we don't we've got no problem with shouting right brother Chad we have no problem with shouting you shout as much as you want you praise you raise your hands you say Amen you do whatever you want we're never going to quench that but when it comes to the Holy Spirit you're looking for a changed life that's going to be the proof and it's a changed life that lines up with the word of God because you can have a changed life where he cleans your life up where you have no guilt over your past sins but that's not a changed life that's just the first two works of Grace but the third one is when he changes your nature when he changes your desires when he changes how you live your life and the things you do from day to day now I'm jumping ahead in the scripture quickly because he says that there's oil olive or olive oil as we would say it and we know that oil is a type of the Holy Spirit but it was a representation of anointing and not just anointing but it was anointing for purpose and anointing for service you aren't anointed just to sit you're anointed so that you'll be put into action and we look at Aaron and the priesthood we're Anointed with oil and what were that what happened after that they were put into action to minister for the people David was anointed with oil and he was put into action to what become the king of Israel and kill Goliath in these different things and it was pointing to the point out of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost when people would be anointed to go do something because he said Terry and wait wait on your ministry wait on your anointing because if you try it before you get anointed for service then your service will be for not but if you get anointed for it then you'll be ready and you'll be in sync with God and his purpose and it'll put you into action and we see as soon as they got Anointed with the Holy Spirit they came out and they started preaching and three thousand Souls were saved that day amen God was promising them a land full of anointing to put them into action to do something and many had Justified them when he he took them out of Egypt and he'd Sanctified them and separated them in the desert but now he's bringing them into a land he says you're going to be anointed to do something and it's to destroy the works of the enemy that's what every believer not just the pastor not just the ministry not just the men not just the fathers not just the husbands but every one of us is Anointed to destroy the works of Satan first in our own lives and then to support the destruction of them in the in the in the body of Christ and the brothers and sisters around us now we know that oil is also for healing but it represents something more than healing and we know the scripture in James 5 but just for completeness I'll read it it says there's any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him now brother bottom takes us and he says something amazing he says why do we anoint the sick with oil he says we anoint the sick with oil because it symbolizes the pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon them so often we tend to look on laying hands and you know maybe I would be her a minister would come here and somebody comes up and we think that when we come and we lay hands on them it's like we're bringing something external from them to them but that's not what we're doing he says it's a representation of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon them amen so what we're doing is symbolic of what's Happening inside of their life and listen when we pray for these people we're believing they've got the holy spirit in them when we had sister Betty come up here I'm pretty sure we believe she's got the holy spirit so we weren't praying to put the Holy Spirit into her we weren't praying to put healing into her but he says you anoint with oil because it represents the pouring out of the Holy Spirit on her within her body it's a representation of what's going on inside of her that the holy spirit is being released that is working to restore the person back to their god-given place and position and rights according to the word of God Amen it's moving you back to what God Said was yours and it takes the Holy Spirit to do that because we wrestle not against flesh and blood and that means we're wrestling against something that requires something beyond the natural and that means the Holy Spirit has to be working on our behalf and I love how if we look at this scripture here it says that not only will you be healed but he says you'll if you've committed any sins they'll be forgiven you as well how many times did Brother Brown say if you come up for prayer he says make sure your life is cleaned up make sure there's nothing there and you'll see how many times did Jesus heal somebody and then he'd say thy sins are forgiven thee as well because he ties healing with forgiveness and when you've got the Holy Ghost then you're under the shed blood of Christ and he can't see your sins and it's separated from you and it never holds you back as long as you've confessed them amen your sins are hidden from God but sometimes it struck me when I was reading this you know about the pouring out of the Holy Spirit and so often we look at that anointing with oil and we think it's for this physical sick and it is and that's where we focus on it we know but when you look at our lives so often our sickness is not of that nature I spent an hour and 15 minutes with a co-worker today talking about some things he's dealing with and most of it's up here and most of it's in his attitude and these different things and listen I can't tell you how many times and this is me being honest just in front of you where I'm dealing with a situation or I'm dealing with a person and I say Lord my attitude is horrible it's horrible I've got an issue with that person I'm grumpy with that person I'm not going in with a loving attitude I'm not getting anywhere in it and even if I think I have the moral High ground it's not doing me any good because we're not making any progress here and it's because my attitude is messed up and I need healing for my mind I need healing for my Approach physically I'm perfectly well but I'm going in and my attitude stinks and I say Lord I need you to heal something up here so that I can be effective out there because if I was to work with the people in the church and have a horrible attitude and to be a you know Elevate myself or or these different things then I get into trouble every time but I've got to be approaching it and looking it through the way that God looks at it and the way that he approaches these things so often my prayer is Lord I know my attitude isn't where it needs to be and I can't move forward until you fix that attitude what am I looking for I'm looking to get his mind in it I'm looking to get his approach his love his patience and if I can get that if I can be healed or restored to that because that's my god-given position is to have the Mind increase Christ to have the fruit of the spirit the love joy peace patience kindness goodness Faith generous self-control all these things that is my right that is my God position that he's given me and so I need to be healed back to that so many times we get tired we get worn out we get stressed these things but once he touches you and once he pours the oil of the Holy Spirit into the situation all of a sudden what do we lose our bitterness our tiredness our frustration our discontent all of these different things listen You'll find somebody that has the Holy Ghost if they've been through things tough in their life guess what they're not bitter about it anymore they can talk about it and say God used it I'm over it I've forgiven that person but somebody that keeps bringing it up what does it show it shows that they're lacking the Holy Ghost not that they don't have it it's that they've lost the fruit and the joy and the peace and the rest in these things and they need a healing touch they need a pouring out of that Holy Spirit on them again I'm not saying you can't be hurt I'm not saying you can't be offended we've all been hurt we've all offended and we've been offended but I'm saying the Holy Ghost won't let you stay there because you've got a land full of oil that will heal you that will anoint you that will bring you out of these things amen it makes you realize what the holy ghost means to a Believer because it can't be a one-time thing it's got to be an everyday thing a Wellspring springing up within you it's got to have a life of its own because our life is very limited our energy is very limited but there's got to be something inside of you we're saying about it brother Bob the songs were perfect for the service today there's a there's a well there's a spring there's a River of Life that's available inside the believer that can keep us going through the tough times amen listen it doesn't mean that Satan's not going to put things on us but if you've got a spring inside of you boy you you can put the biggest rock you want on a spring but that pressure will build up until it throws that thing off and Satan will have to remove out of your life again amen it reminded me as I was reading about the oil and the wine of the Good Samaritan and look what he did when he came across a man that had been beaten broken couldn't help himself just laying helpless what did he do it says a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him sometimes that's where we've got to start not sometime every time you can't pour in the oil in the wine if you don't have compassion he says and he went to him and he bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him we anoint someone with oil to represent the Holy Spirit working on them I can't give you my Holy Ghost remember in the in the in the the the the parable of the the foolish and the wise virgins they said you've got to go get your own oil I can't give you mine I can tell you where to get it I can tell you how to get it but I can't give you mine but you notice here what happens is that sometimes the healing that somebody needs starts with you pouring out what you have and that means humbling yourself sometimes that means you may have the moral High Ground you may be right in and of itself you may be right but sometimes you've got to get off the moral High Ground if I'm right to get down to where they are so you can help them and that's you humbling yourself for the sake of that person that's you pouring in love maybe when they don't really deserve it or Mercy or Grace or patience or these different things and you see what this Samaritan did was he took what he had and he poured it onto him but he didn't just put oil he put in wine as well I'm jumping slightly ahead as I said in the scripture because the scripture always ties the oil and the wine together and Jesus did it brother Branham kept doing it because what happened so often is we say well all I need is the Holy Ghost and you do need the Holy Ghost but what he's saying is with the Holy Ghost comes stimulation if you get the Holy Ghost and nothing changes nothing happens you can't Praise You Can't Worship You Can't Raise Your Hands you can't respond to the word then guess what something's wrong because there's always wine comes with the oil that's what happened the first time remember when they were on the day of Pentecost they got the Holy Ghost but they got plenty of stimulation with it didn't they and so in your own life it's supposed to be the same thing if you've got the oil and nothing's changing then what something's missing and I'd almost say you don't have the oil yet because the oil always brings wine with it amen it's to stimulate you it makes the word live in you it makes The Word Alive remember the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life and when it comes alive it excites you it brings a stimulation it brings those different things now the thing is if you have wine if you have oil without the wine then you're just a dead you're a dead stick you're just sitting there and you're not doing anything but if you have wine without the oil and guess what you're an overcomer in church and then you walk out and you trip home for your shoelaces you're all barking no bite you don't have the victory but you've got lots of stimulation amen and it's usually because it's mental because we're caught up in the in in the doctrine of things rather than than the reality of it in our life stimulation that makes people do stupid things doesn't it I mean we're talking naturally when people go out and they get a lot of stimulation from alcohol they tend to do stupid drinks or they do stupid things because they're drinking and they try and do something that's beyond their capabilities like stop a car with their hand it reminds me of the story maybe you've heard of it if there was a there's a mouse in a house this is many many years ago it's not a true story there's a mouse in a house and they had a cat that was constantly chasing him around and he was always just escaping by the skin of his teeth but he was constantly worried about whether that cat was going to get him but one day somebody knocked over a glass of wine and it dribbled down and it formed a pool inside the mouse's little hole in the wall and he got a taste of that and he said I really like that and he drank and drank and drank until he got stimulated and then he came out of the the little hole in the wall and he said where's that cat that's a stupid Mouse isn't it why because he got stimulated without the reality of what he was trying to do behind him that's what it's like for the believer if you're all bark and no bite then you're going to get bit pretty you're gonna you're gonna get beat up pretty quick amen we don't want to be like a drunk Mouse because that cat's just going to chew us up and spit us out isn't it amen but if you're full of the Holy Ghost you'll be changed listen we don't all have to shout we've got different Natures we've got different personalities in these things we don't all have to shout we don't all have to dance we don't have to do all those things but listen we ought to be able to respond to the word of God we ought to be able to respond to the presence of God in our midst amen and we ought to be able to certainly raise our hands and say thank you Lord Praise You Lord and say Amen to the preaching of the word amen listen Satan can't keep down a Believer that's got the Holy Ghost let's say he can push you and he can press you and he can force you up against the wall and he can try and suppress these things but with that life inside of you he's never going to get the victory because you don't belong to him anymore you've been involved with a price and you've been sealed with it and that seal is proof that you've been bought and he's never going to be able to hold you down they talk about in Revelation 6 it says this is in the third seat he says when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine so you see how in scripture time and time again that the oil and the wine are put together and Christ is saying now in the in the in the third seal he's saying don't touch that oil in the wine and he's putting them as a group he didn't say don't touch the oil he said don't touch the oil and don't touch the wine why because the oil is his and the wine is his because he's the one that gives the Revelation he's the one that gives the stimulation he's the one that gives the Holy Ghost amen and he's saying that's what the oil and the wine they belong to me these are Gods to give these are Gods to hold and so you can't touch them Satan you can't hold them back because they don't belong to you in the first place you can try and suppress it but you can't touch it because it doesn't belong to you in the first place brother Brian would say in wine symbolizes stimulation of Revelation oil and wine in the Bible is associated together always he says I got the concordance and looked and there's a string of them like that where wine and oil goes together all the time he says when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with oil they all get stimulated wine is a stimulation Glory I feel it right now stimulated with joy and shouts see and when it does it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man now most of us probably don't know what that is like but you do silly things you do things that you don't normally do you express things in a way you wouldn't normally Express when you've had a lot to drink I'm told he says because when the Revelation has been given of a truth of God and the True Believer filled with oil and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that he makes him behave himself on normally listen that's not just in church that's not Justin praising and worshiping but it makes you happen different it makes you live differently out there as well talking with this man this co-worker today and talking about the changes that I've made in my life and this decisions I've made with my career and walking away from certain things people Marvel at that because it's unnatural to walk away from money it's unnatural to walk away from promotions that's unnatural to walk away from ease of life and luxury and these different things they don't understand it they don't understand the Simplicity that we seek and the joy we get from the lives that we live it makes you live and do things unnaturally to the to the to the outside world Amen but they work together and they give you and they show you the oil and the wine the the Holy Ghost and the revelation of the word in your life they work together to show you the reality of God and it always has an effect on the believer amen it makes you stimulate he says it makes you happy makes you joyful it makes you worshipful why because it's a revelation of God to you personally personally that's why we don't mimic each other in church because sometimes in the preaching of the word it might be for sister Lydia and guess what brother kingsley's sitting there saying why is Sister Lydia over there shouting and dancing because she got a personal revelation in that and maybe you didn't get it but then brother Kingsley will do it and somebody's looking at him saying what's he talking about what's he so happy about well he's got a personal revelation as well so we don't have to mimic each other we don't want to mimic each other because each of us is stimulated in different ways and with different things based on where we're at in our life and where our needs are on these different things amen but when something strikes you we ought to be able to say Amen praise the Lord thank you Lord help us Lord these different things amen we ought to be able to respond to those things and worship because what we're talking about here is your inheritance your land the good things that God has laid aside for you amen I was reading in Exodus in my devotions the other morning and I was reading about the plans of the Tabernacle and God was so specific with the Tabernacle and you'll find that that types to us because he set up his place of dwelling very specifically and it's the same thing for us and God cares about us and he cares about how we live and how we do things and how we dress and what our lives look like in these different things but we're talking about the oil here and he said in Exodus 27 20 thou shall command the children of Israel that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light to cause the lamb to burn always this is in Exodus way before they're ever going into the land of Canaan and listen when you're in the land when you're in the desert land there's not a lot of olive oil there I don't know if you know that but there's not a lot of olives in the desert and he's saying as part of your worship you've got to continuously continuously bring me pure olive oil to light the lamps so he sets this requirement for them to to to do what to provide something in their worship that he requires another walking around in the desert but he says when you get to that land you're going to have all you need he says I'm sending you to a land full of olives so now you can bring your portion in and you can bring your lamp and you can bring your light into the service and sister Rebecca can do it and sister Selena can do it and brother Bob can do it and sister Brenda and each one of us has a pure oil that he has supplied to us in the land that he's given us and we join together and it's a part of our worship God sets a requirement that you bring pure olive oil that you bring pure oil for his worship and then he says I'll give you a land that will supply the very thing that I'm demanding of you God's not out to trip us up he's not out there to to try and get us to fail but when he makes a requirement he gives us a land that provides us the very thing that he's requiring out of us amen so when God says you ought to have this or you better have that he'll always provide a remedy for it amen so as I look through this and as we start to close we look at the land he's given God have requirements for worship God had a requirements for cleanliness God had a requirement for sacrificing these different things even the pomegranates the pomegranates had to be sown onto the Hem of the high priest skirt they had to have it as part of their worship so that he would be acceptable in the presence of God so God had all these things and he tied what was in the land to their worship to their acceptance to him and he tied it to their everyday needs everything that they had need of and the good things that would make life better for them all of it was provided in there so I say that to say this no matter what your situation is God has a land provided to meet your need now remember when he takes them in there that doesn't mean that you're never going to have a time that you don't have a need he promised the land that was there that had what you need but you've got to get it and that's the that's that that's what we're coming up to is not is it there but will you go get it or will we be denied As we sing well we say I won't be denied I'm going to go in and I'm going to take it and I'm going to grab what God has for me but as we close up on these last two scriptures he says this is what this land is he says a land wherein Thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack anything in it what he has given us there's no lack there's no shortage there's no rationing there's no holding back there's no scrimping and saving everything that you have is gathered in the land that he's given you he said a land whose Stones our iron and out of whose Hills thou mayest dig breast when thou Hast eaten and art full then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee Jesus said that healing is the children's bread and he says in this land he says there's no scarcess of healing there's no shortage of the needs that you have in your body and your soul and your spirit every need that we have is met in the land that he's given us amen like I said he didn't say you won't lack anything that you won't feel a need that you won't feel hunger but he says everything you have need of is already there he says and when you get in there and you take it over he says there's going to be a day when you're full and you can sit back and you can say thank you Lord Praise You Lord there was a fight there was a struggle and there was a time Gap but in the end I got exactly what you said was waiting for me in here and that's the test of our faith is will you hold on until the time that you can say taste and see that the Lord is good I've tasted and I've seen that the Lord is good amen just if we could have the musicians come up as we close amen like I said these are types and parallels we can stand together if we would these are types and parallels and we've already kind of touched on some of these things but next service we want to go into what is our Promised Land what is our inheritance what does it look like when we as Believers two thousand years after Christ has come what is it that he promised us and what is it that we're going to be walking into amen let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord we are so grateful for what you provided Lord that song that says every need supplied and Lord so often we're sitting there and we're saying if every need is supplied why am I hungry we're hungry because there's a battle between us and what you've promised and Lord we want to be soldiers we want to be Warriors we want to be Faithful Servants Lord that'll stick with it and stay in the battle Lord and and tighten up the armor Lord and lift that sword a little higher Lord and let your Holy Spirit be poured out upon us Lord that it would be a spring of life even within us heavenly father that we put your word in our hands Lord and we go to cutting and we go to hacking and we go to pushing back lord those things as Satan throws in front of us Lord help us to praise you Lord help us to worship you help us to thank you Lord for the good things that you've laid out in front of us and the promises that we have Lord we're thankful we're thankful that you've poured your Holy Spirit into our lives but Lord even as we sung before I took the pulpit Lord Lord how we need more of you Lord there are greater victories to be won there are great battles in front of us Lord there's a long road ahead Lord we need Grace and we need strength and we need courage for the road Lord would you just bless us and fill us once again
