read last service that there is an overcomer Lord we're praying that you'll help us to rise Lord to overcoming Faith Lord that we would take you at your word every day Lord that we'd be so confident in what you've given us Lord that we would rest on it we ask Lord just be with us now as we lord we Minister the word Lord may you settle me or may you just speak to your bride here this evening in your name we ask him amen amen God bless you if you'd open the scriptures to First Corinthians chapter 2 First Corinthians 2 amen certainly welcome brother Dale Walsh Leger all the way from from Edmonton is he uh as he sold germs with us and just trusting that God will lead him and guide him but it's certainly good to see you and make it here safely especially without the aid of a GPS or a smartphone so it's good to see you um I did uh brother Paul and Sister Kim let me know they did land safely at around 606 this afternoon or this evening so they are home and I would imagine sleeping soundly in their beds right now had a quite a trip for sure but thankful that the Lord's brought them back then of course to have brother Mark back with us again and uh sister Lily as well in the back so uh I heard she she had a little episode as well so we're glad to have each one here and then just trusting that the Lord will speak this is uh this is Rush tonight I got the call at uh 3 28. 328 that I was preaching tonight and I had nothing I had nothing so uh here goes nothing the same goals amen First Corinthians 2 verse 1 says and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything above among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the power of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God it says how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory but as it is written I Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the Deep things of God Amen God bless you can have your seats this evening this is of course is the the first half of the chapter that we started with last service so I'm kind of working my way backwards here but we want to continue and Lord willing this is the final day the final service for this series so uh we'll see how the Lord would lead but this is all the notes I've got a it's all gone everything's off the pages so if it's not here then I don't have anything else so by God's grace this is probably going to be in it amen but we spoke last service and and remember we're thinking taking this thought of the word is a thought expressed and the overarching theme has been the speaking bride amen and so we're getting into that a little bit but I want to kind of drop into what we we talked about last time we spoke of a mature bride amen and this is what we're looking for in this age is that this is not a little school girl that's running around giggling and getting her Starbucks some pretty shoes and nice dresses and purses but this is a mature bride that's in a relationship with her bridegroom amen and we spoke how if you open the door to him then nobody else is supposed to come in after him and this is not a the the message is not a relationship with us and William Branham that William Branham has no place once we hear that voice when we open the door that only Christ comes in amen William Branham doesn't come in and Jonathan curlette doesn't come in or any Ministry or any any of the five-fold or anything like that it's you in Christ that are there Amen in the relationship that we have is with him directly we have no mediator between us and them amen so we we talked about that amen but I want to break it down a bit as we go into that idea of that relationship and that that Fellowship because we've been speaking in all of this about the expression of God Amen the manifestation of the word of God and and so much of this comes down to fellowship and it comes down to relationship and I want to just cover that a little bit here tonight so I want to first talk about the purpose of fellowship and relationship and we spoke last service about when it comes to Christ that that the new birth is a personal relationship right it's a personal relationship by personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you and in you amen remember that it was the outside the external of God what he is to us he's a savior he's a Healer he's a deliverer and and all of these great things but then there is the expression of Christ through you by the fruits of the spirit and by the manifestation of the word for your day that there are two expressions there's two Revelations of Christ it's to you and then it's through you amen and that relationship is the key to everything that relationship is the key to everything you'll ever face as a Believer you can sit here and you can have the correct doctrines and sit under great Ministries but without that relationship with Christ unless you open the door unless you open the door to your life and you let him come in then you will not see a Rapture because that is the overcomer's path is to let him in and come in and he'll stop with you and you'll stop with him amen amen then we we think about you know we look at brother Brandon perhaps as an Eliezer right and he went and he got the bride of Christ and then he got the bride Rebecca for Isaac and so he goes and he gets her and he says he's waiting for you and he's real and then they have the trip all the way back to where Isaac is and Eleazar is filling her head and filling her ears with all of these things that Isaac is and how great he is and how wonderful he is and and everybody loves him and if you think these gifts are great wait till you see what he's got waiting back at home and and he just can't wait to meet you and you're the one and all these different things but there came a time where she saw where she saw Isaac and she has to get off of her camel and she has to go into the tent with Isaac amen and after that we don't see Eleazar anymore why because he must decrease and the bridegroom must increase you had to step into the tent otherwise it was no good except in eleazar's message because the message was to take you into relationship amen it had to bring you to Isaac it had to bring you to Christ and so the purpose of this message is not just to get us on the camel but it's to get us off the camel and into the tent amen there is a tent Vision if you remember and they'd go into that tent they'd say they come out they go in with a leg missing or limb missing they come out and they'd say and it was all healed and they'd say what happened I don't know amen but something happened in there in his presence that changed them from the way they were to the way they needed to be amen and it's the same thing here you go into that intimate relationship and you'll come out a different person than you went in and you may not be able to explain all the Dynamics and the mechanics of it all you know is that you went in one way and you came out another way amen now this intimate relationship we're talking about remember it's got to be intimacy remember the scripture says in that day they'll come to him and say Lord Lord did we not do all of this in your name and he says yep but I never knew you there was never intimacy there was never a relationship there yes you did those things but there was never through me it was not through me working through you it was not a relationship that we developed and it didn't lead to anything that I called nothing that that I had in my word came forth out of that it was just your dead works that came out of it brother Brown would say this and the message fellowship with God through reconciliation he says wouldn't you love to have lived in that time when the Great Fellowship God had with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to come down in the cool of the evening and talk with them and fellowship with them wouldn't that be marvelous he says we would all like to have that time he says now I Believe by God's word I can prove to you that we can come right back on them terms again with God tonight right straight back to that kind of Fellowship he says and in this meeting I thought of doing this us many people have watched my life in the healing campaigns how that the things would take place and the prophetic gifts and so forth he says I'd just like to tell you how that's done that's done through fellowship with Jesus Christ he says no other way no other plan no trick to it just simply plain Fellowship taking God at his word what he said was truth believing it that just settles it now watch what he says he says then talk to him then love him and thank him for it and that does it so he says it's the relationship it's the communion with Christ that settles all of the issues that we're facing in our life that brings you to the place where the very works of God come through you is because you come into an intimate relationship with him amen and he has to be a God that you know not the god of mom and not the god of dad and not the god of the pastor or grandma or whoever it might be or some great Christian or believer that you know but he has to be your God Amen you have to recognize him as the I am and it can't be through some other person or their relationship brother bam says did you notice God came down in the cool of the day the setting of The Sun there's something about when it starts to get night that people think of church and of God Christians you see the sun setting you realize your son is sitting he says and in the cool of the evening he would come down and commune with them and there he lost that Fellowship because sin would not let him do it and then he was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in order that he could come back again to man to live in man and restore a man to a state of communion with him again and give him back his god-given right so it's communion before it's god-given right amen it's got to be a restoration of communion a fellowship of relationship before everything else follows the first thing that he knocked down was what the ability to come into His presence we know that because the first thing he did as soon as he died was he tore the veil that was the restoration of access to fellowship with God he says that's what he did that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost to bring you into Fellowship he says it's the father again God the Father dwelling in you working out whose plans his plans to finish his Plan of Redemption working through you making you a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you a part for your Fallen lost brother and sister giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the garden of Edom Adam Where Art Thou that's what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman when it strikes into their heart and takes its Abode there's a thirst and a hungering for lost souls that's what's the matter he says with the meanings today there's not enough Spirit touching it to go for the souls of the Lost and the dying it's more to make a name or a church or a building or a denomination instead of a soul-winning program he says how pitiful amen look at us look at us look at the gifts we have look at the Ministries we have look at the doctrines you have he says no it's about winning Souls not about building up a great name for yourself he says God poured himself into Christ and Christ poured himself into the church therefore now watch at that day you'll know that I'm in the father and you're in me and I'm in you at that day you'll know it you'll know it it's not going to be a maybe you'll know it for it's the whole thing is one Plan of Redemption coming down that God coming back to live in and dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions he gets his church to a place that he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship he says then there will come in Eden he'll take his church back to where it left him back at an Eden again there where it fell that's where it made its first start or fall that's where it'll be taken right back with every clean state of redemption bringing them straight back to that place again so the prophet of God is pointing us to a place a time of season he says where the church is in a speaking condition now we want to do we want that that's third pole isn't it that's speak the word that's that's that's what we would maybe consider the epitome or the apex of the bride's Ministries where you have speak the word where you have third pole and that's been laid before us for for decades now and everybody wants to speak seek the word speak the word I'll say it and it'll happen I'll say and it'll happen that's what I'm looking for because that means that I'm right where I need to be and that means I've got rap stream Faith because that's the next step is we'll just speak our way out of here but brother Adam says when she gets in a speaking condition he says what does that look like he says where he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship so we all want to flow himself through part but he says then that looks like love and persuasion and fellowship amen those things require us to be able to stand against opposition to love the unlovable to love when somebody's not loving back listen if you've got to persuade somebody that means that they don't agree with you and you've got to be able to stand there and take the reproach that comes with this message that comes with standing for the word and not get offended why because your soul is sealed to the day of your Redemption and all you care about now is their soul so you'll stay there and you'll do what you need to do and take what you need to take so that you can bring them to the place of a new birth because they are after what lost souls it's not about proving who you are it's about doing the work of the father so you're out for them you're not up for yourself you're not trying to prove who you are you're trying to prove to them who they are you're trying to get them to see that they're the same thing that you are and so you'll stay there and stay there and you'll take the abuse and you'll you'll you'll take these things because you're saying there's a soul in there that's worth far more than any anything else that I could get out of this amen that's ought to be our purpose here not to get this this check mark or this box or this metal that says I'm the best message believer but is your heart the same as his to go and find the lost Jesus said I think I didn't come to say the same I came to save the Lost he went for the sick and the dying and the herd and the offended and all these different ones amen Paul says in second Thessalonians he says wherefore also we pray also for you always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of Faith with power brother Brian would preached a message called our is your life worthy of the Gospel and there's a portion of that that says is your life clean is your life Sanctified are you committed to the things of God and then the second is is are you doing the worthy things that he's called you to do which is to seek for lost souls amen when your relationship is secure then you seek to bring others into the same relationship you are when you believe what you've got is what they need that's when you'll really be effective isn't it he says why that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our God in the good and the Lord Jesus Christ amen so worthiness for the cause of Christ is not the Glamorous thing that people often think it is oh he's counting me worthy and these different things amen but you look at the scripture and the ones that were deemed most worthy had a lonely long road they may have started with a lot but by the time they finished it's usually just them maybe one or two faithful Companions and God and sometimes not even that sometimes it's just you and God Amen and we're blessed to have a church this size we're blessed to have Believers are like Precious Faith but guess what each one of us is called to erode and a purpose and what my life is may not be the same as brother Dales may not be the same as brother Bob's and there's going to come a place where their road is going to be so different than mine that I may not be able to help them and what are they going to have to rely on then they're going to have to rely on relationship with the one that placed them on that road in the first place to keep them going because I all I can do is Pat them on the back and say I'm praying for you brother I'm praying for your sister but this is your road and you've got to be confident that he's leading you and you've got to be able to walk the way that he's leading you right as long as you're in the word I'm going to support you but I can't do anything for you beyond what encourage you right be in Fellowship in that but I may not be able to empathize I may not be able to understand where you're at whether it's because you're a woman and I'm a man because we're at different places in life married unmarried black white yellow it doesn't matter we're all in such different places amen so the thing is you got to be you've got to be settled in that relationship you've got to be settled with him that he's the one that's with you that he's walking beside you all the way amen but when it gets lonely don't get worried because it's lonely because it's a lonely walk there's not many on the on the Highway of Holiness there's not many on the road to heaven today amen but you're surrounded by Believers don't pull away just because they don't understand because we can't understand everything we don't know what everybody's going through you know we I've had a bunch of co-workers in the last couple weeks lose their parents guess what I can't identify with that I can't identify with that so I can give my condolences and and let them know I'm praying for them and trusting that they'll find Comfort but I can only do so much because I haven't been in their shoes yet amen and so we we look at that and sometimes we say well we don't we aren't understood and people don't know where we're at that's okay we don't have to you have one who understands amen that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity said knows what it's like to go through and walk the road alone imagine he's the one that we ought to be looking to Amen brother Brahm says listen I feel that any man that's born of the spirit of God that loves God and loves his word God has a purpose in there he says God had a purpose in turning Paul around did he not say I'm going to show in him his glory god had a purpose when he saved me and I am determined to do his will and not add to it or take away from it Revelations 22 19 said whosoever shall do it his part will be taken from the book of life he says I'm determined to never add one thing of my own opinion to that word I'm determined to read it just the way it is and ask God that I'll open in my heart and receive it not just take it and run with it but Lord open my heart to show me how this applies to me show me what I'm supposed to do with it he says and then what work it through me Lord that others might see may it become salty and something real that others might see because we sit here and we say well I said amen to the word and I believe it and I believe it he says no Lord make it something real in me make it salty that somebody else would desire what I have not because it's me but because it's the word in me being made real amen amen and so we see here in all of these things what's he doing is he's he's going to God and he's saying God bring your life out in mine right and we know that the purpose of relationship is to bring life that's the purpose of relationship we see the very first thing that God said to Adam he says he says what be fruitful and multiply relationship is supposed to bring life amen and so it often feels good and and satisfying and comforting in all those things when you're in a relationship but the ultimate purpose is that life comes forth out of that that the two would come together and that a life would come from it amen amen so you have two groups today you have the nominal world and then you have it and the nominal Christian world and then you have the real true bride of Christ and each one of those is in a relationship and each one of those is going to bring forth life imagine the satanic bride what's she going to bring forth Antichrist right because she's under what a spirit of antichrist she's in a relationship with Antichrist so Antichrist is what she's going to bring forth and so if the bride of Christ is in a relationship with Christ then she's going to bring forth what Christ the word amen so you've got two things going on brother Brandon puts it this way he says we find today that the modern Church of Modern World Church the modern world church and also that the spiritual church are both pregnanted to give birth to Sons one of them a denominational birth is going to give one of these days at the World Council of churches which are produced to the world the Antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth I may not live to see it I believe I will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that that'll finally wind up and that is the mark of the beast when she forms that World Council of churches and she'll give birth to her son her son the Antichrist that's scary that you would go all your life to a church and and maybe in all sincerity believe everything that said over that pulpit and then when it all said and done an antichrist comes out of it we've got no place there that's for sure but don't let it be here either amen why because you're just gonna have what whatever Spirit you're under sitting in this church does not mean you're under the Same Spirit as I am or vice versa for that matter right it has to be in you not just on you he says the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body catches will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride he says the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and woman is one he says and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word brother Adam he says the bride of Christ is not finished yet where did it start it started on the day of Pentecost amen when he came down and he put his own life his own Spirit into sinful human flesh he was starting the multi-member body right then Amen on the day of Pentecost and then after that what does he do he continues it through all the church ages and you say there's nobody with the Holy Ghost here yes there were all the way through he always had a bride never the fullness they fell away from the fullness and were coming back to the fullness but he always had a seed in there you can see there it is all the way through there was always somebody there's always there and what was it he was building up the bride but he says the bride's not done yet why because we're still here when it's done we'll be out of here but he says his bride is still being built up but he's talking about a Oneness and he takes it to of course a man and a woman a husband and a wife and he says how do you know when you've reached that Oneness he says when you are so sold out to him and you have no mind of your own now I said there's a couple Services ago and I mixed up the couples when I did it so we're gonna try it again just to remind those that weren't here but we know that when you get to a certain level in your marriage chances are you kind of know what the other person's thinking without them even saying a word and if you come across a certain situation or something's going on you don't even need to talk to each other do you you know what the other person's thinking and so you're able to react together and move together and there's no big surprises so sister Brenda knows what's going on in brother Bob's head even without him having to say anything why because she's been in relationship with him for 90 years she's been in a relationship with a long time longer for one of you probably and that's why she doesn't need to talk to him all the time doesn't mean she doesn't whether he wants to or not I'm sure she talks to him right but she has come to the place where she doesn't have to go talk to him about everything and guess what she has access to the check checking book she has access to the checking account she has access to the credit cards she has access to the title deed of the home she has access to his power tools she has access to everything that is his maybe with one or two exceptions why because she's in such close relationship with him that she knows what he has and what he does done with it and he's and what is it she doesn't have now a mind of her own when it comes to that relationship I'm lifting you up very high here today sister Brenda right she knows what he wants done with it and so she has access to that anytime she needs it and that's what he's saying is when she is sold out when the bride is so sold out that she's not using her mind she's not coming up with these great ideas but any ideas she comes with up with are through the filter of what her husband wants and it's within that framework and within that vision and within that dream that he has and so that's what she's doing and he's saying the same thing has to happen with the bride where you're not coming up with hey Lord I got a great program for you hey I got a great idea about how we could no no no now you're walking through him and he's saying here's what I want you to go here's where you go here's who you talk to here's where you get your job here's where your church is here's where your pastor is here's what your purpose is in life and you're going to stay right there and you'll have the greatest effect than if you came to me with all these great ideas of yours he'll place you where you need to be and then he'll let you work from there in his purpose amen we speak of the husbands being the head of the marriage and I think so often what happens is we treat the husbands like CEOs and the wives like secretaries but that's not what brother Brown's pointing to here and it's not what the word of God points to when it comes to a marriage right because he says what they are one they are one so he says Christ is the head and we are the body so Christ is the intelligence he's the influence he's the one that tells the body what to do and then the bride the body does it but yet they are not a disparate group they're they're not split apart it is just two rolls of the exact same body and they are equal in that we're coheirs with Christ he says but his role is to lead and ours is to do it's his to give the idea and it's us for us to follow through right so it's not it's not you know one's high and one's low it's just two different roles and the thing is in the world we value the CEO more than we value the Doer but that doesn't mean that one is higher than the other the simple fact is his role is to be the head and ours is to be everything else amen it's an expression of the roles amen but it's not an inequality of persons it's just that he's got the mind he's got the right mind and guess what we're his hands and feet and we've got to be happy with that we've got to be satisfied with it because he's put us where we can be most effective because if we were the mind what would we do we'd end up right where we are today that's where our mind got us so he says you probably don't want to be the mind let me be the mind and you can just follow in my footsteps with what I tell you to do amen we're seeking what a fellowship that restores us to the unity of Oneness with Christ because that's what we lost and when that is fixed everything else falls into place right afterwards what the purpose of God will open up the power of God in your life to do what you have need of he says now in the beginning of man that's what God give him power over everything on Earth now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship his fellowship with the father then he lost that and all his great channels became clogged up and he couldn't get through now what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again this is a massive quote it's like two pages but he takes us through the fall all the way to to full redemption in about eight paragraphs so just stick with me here as we go through it he says Adam never had to be sick he never had to die or being restored to now he never had a heartache he never had fear he just climbed up in the arms of the father just like a child everything was his and whatever he asked why he just got it everything obeyed him because he was God's child and the child is heir of all things now when man fell he lost this so now you have heartache now you have sickness now you have headaches now you have worries now you have fears now what he lost in the fall Christ came as a redeemer did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to the Eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall so what does he start with he doesn't start with with Dominion he starts with fellowship and then relationship right what is the purpose he says of his Redemption to bring us back to Eternal fellowship and relationship he says now the thing of it is he has restored man back to this place man in the fall has lost his conscience of what god of what father put him here on Earth to do in other words all the plumbing as it was in our brain and the outlets of faith has been clogged up with business affairs with home life domestic things it's all become so clogged up that until God can't operate through those channels he made a man for now when God made the human body every little part had its place to play the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose God does everything in there to make it perfect in operation to make the man to live and if God so patterned the man the body of a man how much more has he patterned and said in order the body of Christ the church every single part is needed and it has a particular purpose to do what is intended he says and if God designed man's body he certainly designed the body of his son the church and he's designed us to come together not individually zip up he says to come together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and have these Supernatural workings of God Outlets that's what he says the supernatural workings of God is is Outlets through you so through the gifts of spirits such as prophecy wisdom knowledge the gifts of healing and all these other different gifts is Outlets that God lets out his power and lets out his Revelation to the people and not as an individual so much but as a unit we're all together one great big body of Believers and how do we get into this body the Mystic body of the Lord Jesus he says by one Spirit we're all baptized into this body notice that's the key he says you want to see God move get in unity with the true bride of Christ because it says it's not so much individuals it's us all coming together amen what is it get in line with the word of God for your day and I'll start pulling together right you've got to be in unity you've got to be in unity types the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the unity of the Brethren to the exact same thing so if you've got the anointing of the Holy Spirit you're going to be in unity with somebody I was telling my wife about a brother I use the term loosely that I ran across on Facebook that was calling out these ministers and whatnot and then he he had called out a certain Minister on Doctrine and then he said but he doesn't want to talk to me because I've been married four times and then he says and then the one I'm I'm engaged to so he's married he's about to be married to a fifth person wasn't in the message when I met her you know so this is a guy that can't even manage his his relationships in life but he wants to go around correcting ministers no wonder they don't want to talk to him because he's what blind to everything but his own righteousness and he's convinced himself that he's the spiritual one out of everybody what is it he's out there alone he can't go to church he's been to every Church it seems like he says I never fit in well why because he's righteous in his own eyes what he doesn't get in line with the word he doesn't tie himself into the body of Christ and so he's a lone sheep roaming around there and what has he done he's gotten married five times congratulations right it's not taking him anywhere because he's just a lone wolf right he's a sheep but he's acting like a lone wolf and that doesn't work out well for sheep in case you didn't know he says now Satan by the laws of sin and death makes everything that sin and death brought bought operate to send to cancer for instance he says man recognized it and receives it Satan sends heartaches we recognize it and receive it and if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man how much more god with his power make his laws work in men if Satan can make his laws be sure and US recognize it how much more ought to his children to make his laws be recognized among his people of Divine Healing Revelation power gifts and manifestations of the spirit if you've got we talked about that antenna that receiver last time if your flesh can so quickly receive what Satan sends then why can't your soul receive so quickly what God sends that's what he's saying here is if we're for tuned to receive it then we ought to be receiving it the law of sin and death works in the people and the law of Liberty of Christ has come unto us to set us free from those things he says so I believe this with all my heart I believe that we're nearing the age when people are going to recognize these things listen the age is here he preached us I think in 1955 sometime 50 or 55 55 yes 2022 it's here he says that we've had so much vain philosophy and so forth and teachings that ought not to be until it has set the human mind to a revolution of thinking on matters of this and that and taking it away from the word of God he says as I've said Faith doesn't come by fasting Faith doesn't come by praying reading a book all that's good he says fasting praying and reading a book but faith comes by a settled something that's in the human heart he says that tells you just as sure as you come to this church tonight when you come home you told your wife you'd be home after the service was over you do that unconsciously you just go out and get in your car and go on home now you could not do it unless you have faith you could do it you'd never move from where you're sitting if you didn't have faith you couldn't raise up but you've done it so much and you've just become so accustomed to those laws till it's a natural thing he says what I settled something in the human heart I call that rest right that's a piece that passes all understanding amen I called that sealed to the day of our Redemption right where the same question has been settled forever and so there's no worries or concerns now you're good to go and so then you step into everything else that Redemption has to offer because the big one settled where you're going when this life ends right what is it your new creation in Christ as we talked about and now you're part of his body he says now if we could just throw ourselves completely to God and to his will and be lost to our own thoughts and just let the mind of Christ be in us then same operations of the spirit will work through us just as the Natural Things does just the same thing brother Jonathan I want more in my life from God here you go throw yourself completely to God completely to God and to his will and be lost to your own thoughts that's how you're going to get there he says because we are first created for that purpose to control to rule and to praise God and to live for God now Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be given unto you and if you abide in me and my word abide in you now the father in his word is inseparable because the word is in his son in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God and His word is inseparable you cannot have god without having his word and when you have his word he says you have God and you'll see in denominations and what do they have they believe they have the word the word the word or they believe they're saved they've got God they've got God God they've got the Holy Spirit even and then when you look at what they're believing it doesn't match up with the word of God so what do they have it can't be God because God doesn't change he's not a man that he should LIE there's no variableness neither shadow of turning within him and so if he is different than what his word says then you can't have him it can't be be what you have because he would not deny his word and still be in you it doesn't work that way he says if you want to go back a little further just as far as history you could see the word in the beginning was the word but what is the word he says a word is a thought manifested a thought spoken forth God first he perceived the thought and spoke it and it became a word and the word became material now this is where we were going with all this he says so everything that God has spoken his word received into the right channel will materialize that word for whatever the promise is behind it God will do it he's obligated to it I want to break into that a little bit because he says everything God has spoken that's the word past tense it's already done it's already been said it's already been thought it's already been expressed right now it's time to bring it out he says everything that God has spoken received into the right channel present tense right in the correct time and in the right season in the right channel so guess what you can put the word in the wrong Channel and it won't do what it's supposed to do there are things that I am not supposed to do in this life and there are things that you are supposed to do that I'm not because God has chosen each of us to express his word differently there may be great areas of commonality but I guarantee you there are areas of your life where he's expressing himself in a way that he's not in mind so it's got to be in the right Channel and that's of his choosing not of our choosing it says received into the right channel will will means a hundred percent absolute gonna happen there's no maybes there's no possibilities or it's just potential it will materialize the word for whatever promises behind it you will he says God will do it right it's not you it's not me God will do it you're there to receive you're the channel to receive the word he says and it's just the work of God doing it from start to finish he says then if you abide in me and my word abide in you then you have God the word in you and you believe the word just as you believe God because it is God and it's Inseparable then if you have God's word in you you have God's life in you you have God in you and whatever God's word speaks forth out of you they don't have to come to pass just like it was spoke from God he says whatever God's word speaks out of you there's got to be an influence here and that influence is based on relationship not just based on our ability to read the word and then there's something that speaks out of us amen I spoke on this in the last service we're not looking for a new word we're not looking to add to it and we're not looking to take away from it we're looking to stick with what he said and then we're looking to stick to the plan that he has and when we go into that then what do we have we have Unity of the bride and the groom and then life comes out of it and brother Brown says that looks like what God's word coming forth out of you I mean that's what it's going to look like amen this is the proof that you and here are one is when life comes forth when the word comes forth out of you when it's a real thing Jesus said whatever you ask the father of my name that will I do did you ever realize what that means do you realize if we go before God In The Name of Jesus it's just the same as Jesus himself praying it isn't me praying anymore but that doesn't mean I have carte blanche to just go up and ask him anything I want the expectation is that we pray according to the spirit amen that we have an influence behind our prayers that we're not just like kids going up and I want the latest Shiny Toy or I want the latest gift or I want the latest no no we're going up under an influence under an inspiration because we're in relationship amen we're going up and we're saying I want to use what you have for me but I've caught the mind of Christ and so I'm asking according to the mind of Christ he says if I come in his name and he recognizes his name there's only one way you can come in a man's name and that's if you're married to right listen there's only one woman can come in the name of Jonathan curlette to my bank why Mrs Jonathan curlette that's who she is you've got to have the name of Christ and the only way you get that name is not because you know about him it's because you're married to him amen that you have stepped into an intimate relationship and the only intimate relationship that the Bible sanctions is through marriage so he can only be intimate with you if there's been a marriage that has happened Amen brother Brown preached the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride it's already happening here this is where the marriage is this is the ceremony right here he says whatever you ask the father my name that I do and then I go to the father in Jesus name and it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus it's his Spirit praying through me and then I've got to receive what I asked for because he said it and it's God's Own word it can't do nothing else but produce what it said why because it's not two bodies it's not a CEO and a secretary it is one body it is his mind my lips but we're all in the same body it's just his lips speaking it through what my flesh that's all this is just a microphone really if we want to look at it that way amen we have the same vision we have the same direction we have the same intelligence we have the same mind and so what when the voice speaks it's going to be the same thing as well because you're in line with him because he's the one inspiring it in the first place brother Bob says this is the confidence we have in God that we get what we ask for for he's God and cannot take back his word he's got to stay with his word so then if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it'll be given to you he says isn't it that simple but so often what we skip is what if my words you abide in me and my words abide in you that's relationship that's connection that's beyond Fellowship that's well into relationship and intimacy is that you've got to be with him to get to this place it's not just reading the Bible and then going to God with the scriptures and saying well I want this and I want this and I'm ready for this no no you've got to have the abiding part before you get the asking part he says we were made he says isn't that simple Faith created we was made for that purpose then through the fall why we was taken away from that and then in Redemption we're brought back to it again and the only thing that hinders the human race today from being Superior and controlling like they did in the beginning is because the power lines of the outlet of God made in the human being has been clogged up what did he say it was relationships cares of Life business all these different things he says that's what clogged us up is the busyness of our life and the things that we get so caught up in he says That's What's blocking God from working in our lives the very thing we need him in is the thing that's blocking him so many times now I want to make a transition here because we talked about the purpose of relationship but now we want to talk about the power of relationship because as I said if there's an intimacy in in a relationship then something has to happen something's got to come out of it amen if there's true intimacy then something's going to happen in you and for the believer that power is the Life of Christ in you amen we read earlier Paul where Paul says I didn't come with enticing words but he said I came with power and demonstration of the spirit and that's what it looks like in a believer's life brother Rams starts with this he says let me say something too he says this uniting time to see churches uniting Nations uniting it's a uniting time of God and his bride too and I say this was reverence and respect I believe that the bride of Christ is called I believe she's sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is here they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the earth into glory in the rapture I believe it with all my heart yes sir this is so what shall we do with Jesus called Christ 1963. we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is the Dynamics what boggles my mind sometimes is how many people are sitting there say it's the Mysteries it's the Mysteries it's the Mysteries that's the Dynamics we need brother Brown never said the Mysteries was going to take us off this Earth right he'd say there's rapturing faith lies there and either you know those different things but he says the Dynamics is what Christ how do you prove that by the word what did Peter know about the Seven Seals nothing but he had the Dynamics didn't he they were ignorant and unlearned but it says that they knew they'd been with Jesus amen the Dynamics is the person of Christ in your life you've got to have the word you've got to be right with that because that'll keep you going straight it'll keep you in his will amen but knowing that knowing that's just mechanics that's just knowing how it works that's knowing the way it's supposed to go and the way you're supposed to do things but he says he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper just before the wedding supper brother John do you think there's going to be a massive manifestation for years before we go not according to this seals are open he's saying just before the wedding supper is when you're going to see the Dynamics really break forward because why it's only going to be a quick short work right and then we're out of here the purpose of those Dynamics is just a quick proof of who we are and then we're gone he says we're waiting watching for that their big church is to be United the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies he says the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit we got filled when we had the new birth didn't we that's why we keep seeking a greater and a greater feeling and a refilling and a refilling is because there's absolutely more to be had amen if we can give more that means we can get more you know and I know I can give more so if I can give more than I know that he can give more to fill in what I'm giving away amen you know you think about it Fellowship is static fellowship's wonderful it's like the courtship when you're about to get married amen it's moving you towards relationship but nothing happens in Fellowship it's a warm fuzzy feeling the food's great you bask in the glow of love and all these different things but it's just preparing you for the real thing it's bringing you into what the full expression of love I mean it's bringing you into something that's going to prove that you actually love each other they meant through a union that and it's going to bring forth the life out of these things amen so it has to go past church sermons has to go past message tapes and message books has to go through the the great Ministries that you might have on on your phone and these different things amen it has to come to a place beyond just Fellowship to a place of relationship where it's you and it's him and that's it amen where you can say he's with me and I'm with him and there's nobody else in the room we sing that song into that chamber be free Holy Spirit that's what we're looking for that's what we're looking for and even as these words are coming over the pulpit and whoever might be preaching these different things you're not looking for anything with me you're looking for what the spirit that's hopefully behind it to come in and Quicken those things to you to make it alive to make it real to show you where it works in your life and what it's supposed to do amen the Dynamics for the bride is what the Holy Spirit he says that's the unification of the bridegroom and the bride is the holy spirit that's the thing that ties us into the body that's the unifying proof that's the Seal of our soul is the is the baptism of the holy spirit in your life amen he says now the power of the believing Church we're looking for power he says Christ has all power in heavens and earth you believe it he says now what if he's in you has Christ still got all the power Matthew 28 18 all right he is the seed word in his body and he and US becomes a seed word in us so it's something that has what potential to grow into something else he says what all that God was he poured into Christ all Christ was he poured into the church that's the power the power is Christ in you now watch he says remember God's law of reproduction now remember after its kind we talked about this in the last service where it doesn't matter who a woman's with until she is with someone of the same race of the same not the same race but the same species she cannot bring forth life she has to be with that which she is amen so a human has to be with a human a dog has to be with a dog a horse has to be with a horse and he says what God's law of reproduction now remember it has to produce after its kind he says is that right the seed of Christ the word must come through his body so if you're a part of that body then it can only bring forth what it is which is the word of God in you he says I want to get this in real good I want this to grind down the seed of Christ must m-u-s-t must come through his body not through a denomination but through a born-again seed of the word it must come through now remember what is it Christ see how does my seed come he says through the body how's an apple tree seed come from through the body seed is through the body and the church is the body of Christ that's right he says the Bible Church this birth produces he says the new birth produces himself in his body his church in his word so that the people can do what see the confirmation of Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says you believe it these are not denominational hybrids now this is those that's in the orbit waiting for the countdown you I mean fixing to take a rocket he says Glory these are not denominational hybrids not standing no they're not he says here they're not no sir he says it's the seed he's talking about a bride that's what ready for Rapture that this is what she's looking for that this is what she's preparing preparing for is to get out of here that's the last thing that there is brother Brown says the only thing I see left is the going away the church so what are we looking for everything else we know there's going to be a quick short work but our purpose is to get in the Rapture come hell or high water and we're seeing plenty of that on the earth these days aren't we come hell or high water we want to get out of this place amen and what does that mean he says they're in orbit waiting you know what that means we've cut all the strings we've cut all the ties we've cut all of the influences we've cut everything away from our lives that would hinder us and hold us back remember he said there's these things that are clogging up the channels that God wanted to work through what is it you got to get them unclogged you got to cut the strings you know they talk about cutting the per or the Apron Strings for the for the kids you know and they're holding on Mamas Don't Wear aprons anymore but they used to hold on to the Apron Strings to stand up and and stick with her and hold on they say you got to cut the Apron Strings so that the kids will get out and do their thing right what are you saying you got to cut the Apron Strings to the world you got to get loose you gotta get separated and then you got to get it apart listen we're called out that means we ought to be out you know what I'm saying you know if we're called out then why aren't we out we can't be in it and I you know we're in it but we're not of it we can't be one foot in and one foot out if we're called out let's get out and stay out don't go back in for little things let's get out and stay out can you imagine getting into the ark and just keep running out every day to go in and try and get something oh I really want that fruit and they didn't put it on the boat I'm gonna go get that that's what we're doing when we leave the word and we go off and and try the the smut and the nastiness of this world we're saying I want something that he didn't put in the ark and guess what you'll do that one day in the dark door will shut and you'll say was it worth what I went out looking for why because you got in the habit of being able to get back to safety right guess what he doesn't wink at ignorance anymore we have no ignorance amen the word's fully open we're sitting under a restoring word this is not a time to be jumping in and out jumping in and out have you ever noticed how two Newlyweds all I want to do is spend time with each other that's all they want now yes if your family sister Lily can come over right brother Josh and sister Rochelle yeah Mom yeah Dad sure you can come over that's fine but if you don't come we're fine we're happy why because they're in relationship now they move fast past fellowship and they're into relationship and they're so happy they're so happy to be with each other I trust that you don't need everybody else that's what he's talking about here you're so ready to get out of here the marriage ceremony is done and all you want to do is go home that's it you just want to go home damn there's nothing here that I'm looking for when I leave church there's nothing else I want to go to I'm not saying I can't wait till I get this stupid sermon over so I can go home and do something this is it this is where it's at yeah and if this ain't doing it for you then you're in real trouble you're in real trouble if there's something out there that means more to you than what's here tonight I'm not talking about me I'm talking about the preaching of the word I'm talking about the things of God I mean I'm talking about the power of the Holy Spirit to change our lives amen all we want to do is spend time with what our love this is what he's talking about have you cut all the strings listen sister Rochelle has cut all the strings she really cut all the strings Blanca had to do it Amber had to do it Priscilla had to do it what they've had to cut the strings and why did they do it because he means more in the world than anyone else to her that's why she does it if you haven't cut the strings what does it mean he doesn't quite mean what you think what you're saying he does isn't that true Peter says Lord have we not forsaken all he didn't say we still got a couple things back in the world Lord he says we've forsaken all to follow you that's what he requires of us leave it all behind you fall in love with Jesus you'll see the same thing happen amen Brothers remember the early days when all you could do all you wanted to do was spend time with her right brother Matt now some of us still do some of us still don't I'm not saying who's who but guess what there was a time remember I talked last service what did what was it that caused the problems in the first church age they left their first love and we've got to come back to our first love if we're ever going to get out of here he's got to be our first love amen we've got to recognize that this is a this is a love story that goes way beyond our remembrance amen that he's loved us since before we even came into being and we're just realizing it now he says God ever does the same thing when he gets ready to use anything he says like he got ready to use this old star whatever it was this world he had to separate the light from the darkness when he gets ready to leave to use a group of people he has to separate the light from the darkness when he gets ready to use an individual he separates the light from the darkness see you get separated get away from those influences move past fellowship and into relationship that's when you start to see what life that's when your relationship really starts to grow and Blossom because guess what now there's no secrets nothing's hidden I'm in a mixed crowd but nothing's hidden you see The Good the Bad and the Ugly don't you but it's where the relationship really starts to grow is because it gets tested because of the flaws not because of the perfection right and that's what we've got to get to with God is we've got to have that Honesty to wear what he sees everything right and you're not hiding it you're not pretending it's not there but he sees everything and he's changing into you into the image that he had of you before it ever began amen what's he saying get rid of the cobwebs get rid of the the things that clog up the channels that he's trying to use amen we talked about last service about how if you're only hearing One Voice you're only going to have one relationship and you're only going to have one love and if you've let him in the door shut then why are we listening to other voices right why are we going to open the door to look for somebody else get in and once you're sure he's in shut the door and stay with him and that'll finish the work that you're looking for in your life amen amen listen you're what this world needs and more than the food that they have and the the roof that they have over your head you are literally the living breathing embodiment of Christ for this world that's what they need they need us let's be it let's be it and the only way we can beat is if what we cut the strings get away from it all right brother I've read this quote before he says when God speaks to a man he has Faith he has ambition and he has a purpose when God speaks to a man he gives him a purpose when he speaks to a man he gives him ambition now we look at ambition as well I want to be CEO I want to be a millionaire I want to own a Ferrari I want to have a massive home on the you know whatever it might be no no he says he gives him an ambition what is an ambition a goal to achieve he gives him a goal to achieve that's in line with the word of the purpose of God when God speaks to a man he gives him ambition when God speaks to man he gives him Faith to do it to accomplish or achieve what his purpose in life is what God has called him to do and then he says he's called us to be in the Church of God Amen first thing is he's called to be in the church he's called us to be out first thing he calls us is out amen doubt is the antidote to Faith and so often what we have is a great faith in God and we have zero faith in ourselves and when I say ourselves I don't mean our fallen flesh we have great faith in who God is and his position and his power and his goodness and his greatness and all these things but then when it comes to who we are in him all of a sudden the faith goes to nothing why is that why is it that we have great faith in him but not in ourselves because what we haven't been listening to what he says about us enough we haven't been in relationship with them to where when he says you're beautiful as you're beautiful you're beautiful you're beautiful then guess what you don't need to run out and paint your face with makeup and wear tight tight and short clothes and all these things sisters but Brothers you don't have to have the latest haircut and you don't have to have the fanciest car and the greatest home and the biggest toys and all these different things why because he's the one that you're seeking to what please and he's telling you you're beautiful he's telling you you're good I like you the way you are so instead of what we're doing is we're seeing that we're saying this is what I ought to be rather than going to him and saying Lord how do you want me to be and when he gets there and he starts talking to you and he starts affirming where you're good and changing where you're bad then all of a sudden you can have confidence that hey he's working with me he's talking back to me he's changing my life into what he has as an image for me and that's what's going to please him and so I can have faith so whether he makes me a wife or whether he makes me a husband whether he makes me a single woman or a married woman whether he puts me in a blue-collar job or a white collar job whether I make 300 000 a year whether I make thirty thousand a year it doesn't matter because he has made me and put me in the place that he says is going to be best for me to achieve his purpose right he is the one we're looking to amen we're not here to impress we're here to express and so often what we're doing is we're looking and we're not impressed with ourselves maybe it's just me sometimes we're not impressed with ourselves but that's not what it's about the question is are we in his will and are we in his purpose are we changing into the image that he has for us and if that's the case then we can have faith that whatever he has placed in front of us is his will and we're going to go through it and it's going to be done for our good amen amen and then sometimes what are we looking for we're looking for something bigger and greater and the bigger and greater that we really need is for him to step into what we are right now that's what makes it big and great you know not every not every woman in the message has a natural mothering instinct I know because I've been around them my wife has talked to them not every mother that's out there had a baby and immediately was just overwhelmed with everything she needed to be a mother guess what we still have mothers that struggle with depression we have still have mothers that struggle with weight issues we have women that struggle with staying at home all the time with boredom and all these things guess what that's not what it's about and so they're looking for something bigger and greater but the thing is they are where God has called them to be and so what they need is not something bigger and greater but they need the something bigger and greater to come step into where they are right now so they can see the importance of it so they can see the impact of it in the kingdom of God and not all of a sudden they realize holy cow I am in a very important position I have a congregation I am the Fifth Gospel I have promises I have scriptures written about me that men can't hope to touch what is it all they need is The Great I Am to step into them to realize that hey I am exactly where I'm supposed to be doing exactly what I'm supposed to do and all I need is for him to anoint me so I can realize what it is that I'm doing and that is all for his glory and for his purpose anyways brother Brown says we have faith in our and we have faith in our heart the faith of God in our heart and can see it clear it becomes a faith and then we speak it and it comes into existence the same thing because the mind of Christ is in the man he says that's what makes healings and so forth he says when you get that perfect Revelation just what you're doing you say well this is for a prophet doing great healings and all these no no no he says when you get that perfect Revelation just what you're doing then you know how to walk he says that's it because that's the Christian walk it's not just pastors it's not just prophets it's not just the five-fold ministry but he says when you get a revelation of who you are and what you're supposed to be doing he says that'll lead you down the Christian walk that you're supposed to be living we're not all going to be you know big in the eyes of the world or big in the eyes of the message but the question is are you in your place and purpose and when you're there then that's when all faith is available to you that's when all faith is available to you when you're in his will and purpose and we'll cover a couple of those he says you always have to stand this reproach in order to give your testing to see every man that comes to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained you for and remember he says if you can just keep quiet listen you know the thing that teachers hate the student that won't shut up I had two hands mine and somebody else's praise the Lord what the student that won't shut up three why because you can't learn if you're talking and listen you may know what they're talking about but you may not know where the end goal is you may not know how to apply it the way that they want you to you may not see where they're going but if all you're doing is talking you're not going to get anywhere he says if we can just keep quiet remember if he has called you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening there's not enough devils in torment but what God's word will make manifest you're born for a purpose and nobody can take your place remember we're thinking about the word is a thought expressed so nobody can take your thought and express it the way you can impossible he says God's word will be made manifest you're born for a purpose nobody can take your place you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place he says right God's word will Triumph how am I going to win brother John God's word will try him you the word that is you the expression of God through you that's what's going to try them remember what the scripture says the overcame by what the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony was the word of your testimony it is that who he has called you to be and what he has placed you on this Earth to do that's what you have done my testimony is I'm doing what he's called me to do and you've got to have the exact same one he says God's word will try it cannot fail there is where every Christian ought to stand knowing that and trials will come up and seem every way to you but remember God has a purpose and it will work right we gotta rest there because so often it looks like everything's gone Haywire it's gone hayware but out of the Haywire out of the chaos yet God can bring what life Simplicity peace rest healing all these different things look at Moses we'll go through a couple examples as we start to close he says Moses was very persistent he didn't wait till he formed an army you know sometimes you can get persistent and hear the voice of God it makes you do things ridiculous to the carnal mind you act strange funny you're an odd person look how ridiculous Moses acted the next day we find him with his wife sitting on straddling a mule gershom on her hip an old man with Whiskers hanging down like this the beer blowing a little old 80 year old man with a crooked sticking his hand going down the road hallelujah hallelujah where are you going Moses going down to Egypt to take over a one-man Invasion why he had heard God say Moses wait a minute Sun got too hot there's something wrong with you your mental condition's not right Moses go back he says try to stop him you couldn't do it God had told him he was going to take over and he did it might act funny but he know what he was doing he had the mind of God he knowed the will of God he knew what he was doing and away he went remember we spoke last service about how God brother Brown said Moses was the word and then he said Moses was Christ for his day but Moses was not Christ at all times because he got ahead of the plan of God he got into his own he got into his own vision of what that deliver looked like and he made a mess of it so the word potential was always there but until he came in God's time and had God an experience with God he wasn't the word made flesh but as soon as he stepped into that as soon as he met the I am and he got his marching orders and he obeyed them what happened was he became Christ he became the word for his day he became the anointed one and he says that's what you've got to do any man can get in that can get in that condition know exactly what God's called him to do something's going to happen yes sir I don't care who it is how sick you are what all about it you've got to believe it and then you become persevered there's nothing going to stop you that's right so whether you're a wife or whether you're a CEO whether you're the secretary or the CEO amen whether you're blue collar White Collar male or female doesn't matter he says you get a revelation of what God has called you to do and nothing's going to stop you and he says the first thing he's called you to do is be the Church of God get out get out get out and then let him work through you speaking of Samson he says men of them soldiers standing there can remember seeing him standing with the Jawbone of a mule in his hand and a thousand dead Philistines laying there how could it happen when the Jawbone of a mule hits one of those helmets practically an inch and a half thick of solid brass you strike that Helm with a Jawbone of a mule that mule's jaw is going to fly to a thousands of pieces but Samson what with the power of God upon him beat down a thousand Philistines breaking down their Shields and laying them at his feet I'd imagine one of those Warriors had fled during that time stood back up and remembered is that Samson they remembered seeing the Jawbone in his hand and saying who else wants some of this [Laughter] can you imagine they're coming at You Soldiers they've got their armor they've got their great weapons and they're falling back from a guy who's creeps keeps screaming who wants some of this right he killed the first hundred who wants more guess what they kept coming kept coming kept coming until he killed a thousand of them he had a thousand of them that wanted a piece of him then the rest I guess decided no who else wants some of this he says he was a man who could speak why he was a man who was anointed of God God promised to bless him he was in the strength of Jehovah you know we give Samson a pretty hard time Samson was one of the most flawed people in the scriptures I think because he started out bad right he met a girl and he got into all these troubles but do you know that in the middle of that Samson judged Israel peacefully for 20 years 20 years he did exactly what God wanted him to do then he got off with a woman again Samson's weakness was obviously women but in the end he said Lord just once more just once more I messed it up I know I've messed it up but he says once more and you know why God answered him because Samson was back to doing what he was supposed to do which is kill Philistines he said let me kill Philistines he says I'll die with them I'm okay with that he says but let me kill Philistines and just once more God gave him the strength and he killed more in that day than he killed in his entire life right he put himself back into the purpose that God had put him on the earth for and that's where God met his prayer you've got to stay where God wants you to be I want to close with this idea of resistance by relationship we've talked about adoption we've talked about relationships and marriage between the bride and Christ and the mature bride and like I said we're not a school girl frolicking around and just having a fun time with the boys and these different things but we're talking about a bride that's in a close relationship right and the security that she has is in her relationship with Christ right that is with the word the person of Christ but it is through the word of God that we see the things that he he thinks and wills and he wants and this is what keeps us secure like I said I read there's an overcomer that means there's an overcomer right in this last stage and it tells me there's healing and deliverance and provision and guidance and Direction correction chastisement all of these things are in here and guess what if I see it that gives me confidence that he's God because I don't get away with things I see people in the world get away with things all the time I don't get away with things why because I'm a Child of God that gives me confidence in who I am amen and it's that closeness of relationship where I've taken that as my absolute where I've taken him as my absolute that gives me strength when the trying times come but guess what Satan wants to break up relationships doesn't he we see it in the world right we see it in the brother even within the message five five women you know he's in the business of trying to break up relationships brother Bob's talking about Jesus he says now when he came he said I just do what the father shows me to do that's what I do when he shows me I don't do nothing I can't do nothing till he tells me when he passed by the pool and seen all the people and he healed amen and the Jews questioned him why he said I do nothing but what the father shows me I can't do nothing but whatever he does he shows me and then I go do that he says that's it that's true Saint John 5 19. he says and we notice him he was a kind man a humble man and yet he was a man of power when he spoke he was very humble and gentle I don't know if I remarked on this over the pulpit a while ago but just listening to to brother Branham and he did a 45-minute prayer line and guess what he didn't scream once he didn't shout once he wasn't dancing around he was just speaking very calmly very quietly and it stands out to me when I see that in contrast so often to the yelling and the shouting and the Thundering out and these different things and nothing wrong with that by no means nothing wrong with it but brother Brown points to Christ and he says he was very humble and gentle with all that Authority you know but Satan on the other hand he's looking to make a show isn't he loud flashy glittery get people there but he's always on the prowl trying to trying to break up relationships and brother Brown starts talking about that he says but when it comes time between to separate between truth and error Jesus was very Stern picked up some ropes tied them together kicked over the money Chargers table and beat them out of the temple called the Pharisees those religious people and said well you bunch of Hypocrites you serpents Snakes in the Grass and all these things see he was a man who could speak when it come time to speak he wasn't always gentle he says he was a man who was full of love but he loved his father so much till he stayed in harmony with his father and anything that interfered with that Harmony then Jesus draw the line right so the question is are you willing to draw the line to protect your relationship with Christ because the proof of a of a broken relationship is when you can't talk to him when you can't approach him when you can't spend time with him when there's a barrier between you and him that means that you're not holding that relationship the most sacred thing you've allowed something to come between you and him so the question is what keeps us away from him what holds us back shame guilt iniquity we're doing things we know we know ought to be doing right something we need deliverance from addictions shame offenses hurts pick your poison he said what anything that interfere with that Harmony Jesus draw the line are we Drawing the Line today is there anything holding you back from his word if there is draw the line cut the strings amen then we see how Sly Satan is because he starts to put conditions on your relationship he starts to try and Define your relationship with Christ and we know that because when he came and he tempted Jesus in the desert what did he do if thou be the Christ right he says he challenged his position and our position is in Christ our relationship is through Christ and so he comes to us and he's doing the same thing and he's saying if you're the bride you ought to be able to do this and you ought to be able to do that you ought to be able to go here and this ought to be in your life and this ought to be out of your life and all these things and we've got Satan trying to give us relationship advice trying to get us to prove ourselves to him why would we ever prove anything to Satan we've got nothing to prove we're not wrapped in our righteousness we're wrapped in Christ righteousness amen we don't answer to him we're not in relationship to him I don't answer to anybody else about my relationship with my wife right nobody in this church gets to come in and say now I now now if you're really in love with your wife then you ought to go buy her a new Mercedes-Benz as nice as that would be that has nothing to do with anything in our relationship and it wouldn't do anything for ours that's for sure now if I could buy her a greenhouse that would do it but that's the thing Satan didn't tell me to buy a Mercedes and she'd say why didn't you buy me the greenhouse because I listened to Satan's honey right don't listen to Satan when he's trying to give you relationship advice because he tried to mess Jesus up and he does the same thing to us brother bam says the same old devil lives today go down here and heal that old man so and so on the corner go over here to so-and-so and heal them listen I can tell you as a as a minister don't think that he doesn't come with those sorts of thoughts but he'll change it to whatever it is that you think you ought to be doing because sometimes we think we ought to be doing certain things right we ought to have Victory we ought to have more grace we got to be this we got to be that we ought to be doing this we got to be spending our time no no that's not up to Satan to tell you what to do that's up for God through the word to tell you what to do he says we don't take orders from the devil Jesus said I can do nothing until the father shows me first what to do for he worketh and I work with hithers too and he's the same yesterday today and forever so you hear anybody say anything like that walk away it's the devil we don't take orders from Satan we just come from above when he shows us what to do then we go do it he says if he wants Mr Jones on the corner healed he will tell his servant and he will go over and heal him that's right just by his orders and we see that when when Peter and John went to the temple right they're going through the gay beautiful and that man sitting there and he says he asked for alms and he says Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I had give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk what was it he was told what to do why because that's the way it was with Christ Christ didn't just go around willy-nilly healing people he healed the ones that he was told to heal and that's all the very same thing that happened there it wasn't Satan going around well saying well Peter you ought to have power now you got the keys to the kingdom you should be able to heal this guy no it was the unction of the holy spirit said go to that man and heal him and that's what he did that man didn't even have to have faith he had to have faith to actually try and stand up I guess that's about it but it was what the authority that Peter and John were given that made that man stand up that was God's saying go do it and they did it but guess what like brother Brandon pointed out Jesus went to the pool Salon maybe hundreds maybe thousands of people there and he healed one you know what Satan would say why don't you heal them all if you can heal one why don't you heal them all because it's the Lord's will that want that one be healed and that was it yeah that's all there was to it amen we've been talking about this idea of speak the word and you know what Satan will do he'll put something up in your life and then he'll say speak the word to take it out guess what scripture doesn't say we get to take out things from our life says that he will do it according to his will but we don't go around and this is this is the the prosperity doctrine that you see in the world and what do they say they say speak the word say what the Bible says that you're going to be blessed and you're going to be this and you're going to be that and they got the people believing that the ease of life is the blessing of God not knowing that it's the correction of God and that God is working to get us to a place and that comes through trials and temptations that he's working us through his program to get us to a place of maturity and all they're doing is speaking out of their lives or trying to speaking out everything that God has placed in there to grow them into a son or a daughter of God Amen what is it what's the antidote to this spending time with Christ that's it you got to spend time with him and it's not just reading your Bible you got to be praying you got to be talking to him you've got to be able to give him a chance to step into your life and do these things amen the anti-adult to Satan is always going to be Christ the person of Christ amen if we're acting on discontent fear disappointment hurt feelings that's never going to be the inspiration of the holy spirit because that's not what moves God his word doesn't say if you're disappointed then speak it out of your life has nothing to do with it then you've got to find his will and you've got to find his purpose acting out of emotion or pity isn't why we do things either because at the police alone again pity would have said Jesus would walk around and heal every single woman was there maybe there were others that were in a worse condition and have been there longer we don't know but he only healed the one why because he was in a relationship where he wouldn't move until God told him what to do amen God never promised us a bed of ease quite the contrary quite the contrary right we're going to suffer persecution all of us will suffer persecution we're all going to see difficulties you look I just finished reading through the book of Acts again and I'll tell you they had a rough life they had a rough life you want to write a second book of Acts get ready for that they're not going to take our lives but I guarantee you before this is over they're going to take just about everything else in some form or fashion we're going to lose our jobs at times we're going to lose our finances we're gonna we're gonna face a lot of difficulties and we already are we see what's happened to different message ministers that have been put on the news and and and they've been tattled on and this and that and the other thing and what happens is they go and they get eviscerated guess what it's coming to the place where they'll go and they'll take what they have right why because we're going to suffer persecution it's not just going to be harsh words it's going to be worse and it's going to get worse and that'll make us really want to get out of here I mean that's really going to cut the ties when we start to feel some of those pressures I think amen but what did he do he didn't promise us a bit of ease but he said my grace is sufficient for thee it says I'll not leave you or forsake it to the end of the age he says I'll work everything for your good even the tough stuff even when it looks so dark it looks so Bleak when it seems like nothing's happening he says I'm still going to work it out for your good amen speak the word church doesn't mean go around just quoting scripture it means you get in his presence and you catch the inspiration of the holy spirit for your life for your situation in his time and then you go out and you confess and you say Lord that's what I believe is going to happen that's what speak the word means to us is to be in relationship with him to such a point that he can let us know what he wants us to do and amen God bless you let's Stand Together listen we get a connection with Christ that's like that that's when we can have confidence what we ask in his name he's going to do because we have his name amen we're tied to him we've got the marriage certificate we've got the Seal of the holy spirit in our lives and so we know that he's going to do it because it's him that's influenced us to say it in the first place amen let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord certainly we need to come to a higher place and Lord I speak for myself if only for myself today Lord to say that we need to come to a higher place Lord we need to cut so many strings I feel Lord we need to be more committed Lord we need to be more Sanctified and Lord that's not going to make us better people Lord but it gives you an opportunity to step in and fill us with something that's so much greater than what we have right now Lord I'm praying that even as we bow our heads this evening Lord that our hearts would open up our lives would open up Lord that the the darkest areas of Our Lives Lord the disappointments the hurt the pain or the confusion Lord whatever it might be that's holding us back lord lord if there's strings of the world that are tied to us Lord if it's if it's past relationships Lord whatever it might be Lord may we cut those things tonight may we just Place ourselves Lord as we read earlier Lord may we throw ourselves completely Into You Lord to let you sort these things out May our faith solely rest Lord on the word of God lord and may we seek to find ourselves in it day in and day out we pray Lord just minister to us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen my redeemer is faithful and true 11 34. but Josh I'll turn over to
