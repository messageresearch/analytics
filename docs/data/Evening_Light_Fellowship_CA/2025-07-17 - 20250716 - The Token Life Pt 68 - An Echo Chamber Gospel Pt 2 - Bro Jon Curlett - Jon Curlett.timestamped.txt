[37:50] you're the sweetest name of all.
[37:56] Jesus,
[37:57] hallelujah,
[37:59] always hear me when I call.
[38:04] Jesus,
[38:07] you lift me up each time I fall. You're
[38:12] the sweetest.
[38:15] Hallelujah.
[38:16] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[38:20] Oh Jesus,
[38:24] you're the sweetest name of all. Let's
[38:28] stand. Jesus, praise the Lord. You
[38:33] always hear me when I call
[38:38] Jesus.
[38:40] You lift me up each time I fall. You're
[38:46] the sweetest. Hallelujah. Sweetest name
[38:50] of all. Sing it again. Praise the Lord.
[38:54] And Jesus,
[38:58] you're the sweetest name of all.
[39:01] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; You always hear me when I call.
[39:10] Hallelujah.
[39:12] Jesus,
[39:14] you lift me up each time I fall. You're
[39:20] the sweetest. Praise the Lord.
[39:23] Name of all. Hallelujah. Jesus. Oh
[39:28] Jesus,
[39:31] you are the greatest
[39:34] of all.
[39:37] Jesus,
[39:39] you always hear me when I call.
[39:45] Jesus,
[39:48] you lift me up each time I fall. You're
[39:53] the sweetest,
[39:55] the sweetest name of all.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're thankful your mercies are
[40:05] new every morning.
[40:07] Lord, that under the blood are we're
[40:09] living with a clean slate,
[40:12] Lord. And we're just looking for your
[40:13] will and your way each day in our lives,
[40:15] each one, heavenly father. But Lord,
[40:17] we're thankful this evening for your
[40:19] goodness, for your grace, Lord, your
[40:21] provision, Lord, your many mercies day
[40:24] by day, Lord, for your longsuffering,
[40:27] Lord, for your guiding hand, your
[40:28] correction,
[40:30] Lord, your leadership.
[40:32] And Lord, we're just standing once
[40:33] again, Lord, in expectation, Lord.
[40:35] Trusting you to minister to our lives,
[40:37] Lord, to our situations, to our hearts.
[40:40] Lord, you see all those things we think,
[40:42] Lord. All those things we're dealing
[40:44] with. Lord, you know the hidden desires,
[40:46] Lord, the hidden concerns of the heart.
[40:48] You know our fears and worries. And
[40:50] Lord, we're here to have our faith
[40:52] raised again this evening. Lord, we're
[40:53] here to be set on the right path, Lord,
[40:55] to set our steps according to your word.
[40:58] So Lord, we pray once again that you
[40:59] would just take this service, Lord, that
[41:02] you would come in your word, Lord, and
[41:03] that you would speak to our lives, each
[41:05] one. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[41:07] ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn
[41:10] to second Timothy chapter 4 if you
[41:13] would. 2 Timothy chapter 4. And just a
[41:16] quick announcement to remind everyone to
[41:18] please email Brother Bo, brother Paul
[41:21] confirming that you are going to camp,
[41:24] what days, and how many people. We are
[41:27] extremely full this year. It will be way
[41:29] more than we've ever had before. We need
[41:32] everything determined before Friday. So,
[41:35] by end of day Friday, please email him
[41:38] if you haven't already.
[41:40] Let him know for sure who's going, what
[41:42] days you'll be there, what meals you'll
[41:44] be eating, so that they can manage all
[41:46] that. We're looking at over 90 people
[41:48] this year if everyone goes, closer to
[41:50] 100 if everybody showed up and we were
[41:52] able to fit them all. So, we need to
[41:54] know exactly who's coming because we're
[41:55] going to have to be working out all of
[41:57] the sleeping arrangements and not just
[41:59] the food and whatnot. So, please do that
[42:01] if you can. Amen. God bless you. It's
[42:03] good to be here again this evening.
[42:04] Beautiful day, beautiful weather.
[42:06] Certainly enjoying the summer that's
[42:08] finally among us for the next six weeks
[42:09] or so. And just trusting we'll get the
[42:12] most out of it before the fall hits us
[42:14] in way too soon of a time. Amen. This
[42:16] Paul now speaking to Timothy. He says to
[42:19] Timothy now, he's he's Paul's going off
[42:21] the scene here. And listen to his his
[42:23] instruction to Timothy. He says, "I
[42:25] charge thee therefore before God and the
[42:28] Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the
[42:30] quick and the dead at his appearing and
[42:33] his kingdom. Preach the word, be instant
[42:36] in season, out of season. Reprove,
[42:40] rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering
[42:43] and doctrine." Notice the approach of
[42:45] the preacher here. He says, "You've got
[42:46] to be able to reprove." That means
[42:49] correct.
[42:50] He says you got sorry that means to
[42:52] convict. He says you've got to rebuke.
[42:53] We know what rebuking is. He says and
[42:55] you've got to exhort. You've got to
[42:56] beseech. You got to pull the people. You
[42:58] got to you got to plead with them. And
[43:00] it's all for our good. Amen. We can't
[43:02] just go to a church where it's just one
[43:03] or the other. There's a reason for all
[43:05] the different ways that the messages
[43:07] come and it's for our good. Amen. He
[43:09] says, "For the time will come when they
[43:11] will not endure. They won't tolerate
[43:13] sound doctrine. But after their own lust
[43:16] shall they heap to themselves teachers
[43:18] having itching words. In other words,
[43:20] they're going to create their own echo
[43:21] chamber and they're going to nominate
[43:23] the speaker for their chamber. Amen.
[43:25] It'll be of their own choosing, their
[43:26] own creation. And he says because of
[43:28] that, they shall turn away their ears
[43:30] from the truth and shall be turned unto
[43:33] fables. That word fables is the word we
[43:34] use today, which is myths. So this is a
[43:37] creation of their own desires, not the
[43:39] word of God. And it has no validity.
[43:41] There's no truth to it. Amen. God bless
[43:43] you. You can have your seats. And I want
[43:45] to take another service on this thought
[43:47] of an echo chamber gospel. And I know
[43:49] last service I can speak more freely
[43:51] here. It's just us here tonight. It
[43:54] certainly seemed, excuse me, I think
[43:56] most were thinking that doesn't apply to
[43:58] me. And in truth, it doesn't. In truth,
[44:00] it doesn't. And you know, I had someone
[44:02] say to me, "That's the straightest
[44:03] preaching I've heard over that pulpit
[44:04] about that topic since you've been
[44:06] here." And it is straight. And the thing
[44:08] is, the simple fact is we have people
[44:10] amongst us that don't exactly believe
[44:12] the way we believe. And some of them
[44:13] have never heard it. And we can't be
[44:16] scared to preach what we believe. And at
[44:18] times we, you know, we go very carefully
[44:20] and we want to we want to be gentle and
[44:22] we don't want to to hit people too hard
[44:24] with certain things, but we're getting
[44:26] close to the end, church. At some point,
[44:28] they've got to hear the truth. And so I
[44:29] I know it was straight, but I'm trusting
[44:32] it was also imbalance. And that's what
[44:33] you're trusting when you say these
[44:35] things is that people have been around
[44:36] long enough to stick around and hear
[44:38] everything you're going to say, not just
[44:39] that one service. But I am saying it to
[44:41] say this. There's a foundation being
[44:43] built here to take it to where it comes
[44:46] into our lives and we're not just
[44:47] looking outward. Because if there's one
[44:49] thing I hate, it's a preacher that's
[44:50] preaching to everyone that's not in this
[44:52] church. There's no point in me preaching
[44:54] to people that aren't here. There's no
[44:55] point in me pointing out other people's
[44:57] mistakes, correcting other churches,
[44:59] correcting other ministries, cuz they're
[45:00] not here and they're not listening to
[45:01] me. I'm not famous. I don't have that
[45:03] kind of pull. I don't have that kind of
[45:05] viewership on on YouTube for those that
[45:07] are listening in. I'm here to preach to
[45:09] those that are here. So, when I'm
[45:10] preaching those things, it's because
[45:11] there's people here that need to hear
[45:13] it. And it's not always for the regular
[45:15] the the regular members, those that have
[45:16] accepted this message of this hour. So,
[45:18] I did want to say that that that it
[45:20] wasn't aimed at at us in particular, but
[45:22] it's a foundation for where we're going
[45:24] in that service in in the coming
[45:26] services. Now, we opened in this this
[45:29] scripture where Paul's telling Timothy,
[45:31] there's coming a time where people
[45:33] they'll hear the word of God, but they
[45:34] won't hear the full word of God. They
[45:37] won't hear the true word of God, but
[45:38] they'll hear something that's that's
[45:40] supposed to be the word of God. And if
[45:42] they can't hear it from you, they'll go
[45:44] find somebody else that'll tell them the
[45:46] way they like it. And they'll draw
[45:48] people of like minds and like doctrines
[45:50] and like feelings to that person, and
[45:53] they'll they'll develop themselves an
[45:55] echo chamber gospel. They'll build a
[45:57] church around what they want to hear.
[46:00] Church, you know what the antidote is to
[46:02] that? Go to a church that steps on your
[46:04] toes from time to time. Go to a church
[46:06] where the pastor doesn't mind speaking
[46:08] things that may hurt or may correct. And
[46:11] I say this that if we aren't preaching
[46:13] that, then there's something wrong
[46:14] behind the pulpit. Amen. There's
[46:16] something wrong with the church you've
[46:17] chosen perhaps if we're not getting our
[46:19] toes on stepped on. Amen. Because how
[46:22] can we be changed if we're never
[46:23] corrected? Amen. and I this is not this
[46:26] is not some mythical magical event where
[46:28] we're just going to live our lives any
[46:30] way we want to and then at the end of it
[46:32] all of a sudden we're going to have
[46:33] rapturing faith. We know the rapture is
[46:36] a process and that process is a changing
[46:39] process. We're being changed from glory
[46:41] unto glory. Word upon word here a little
[46:44] there a little. Did you catch that? The
[46:46] word is changing us bit by bit. The
[46:49] thing is church, you're so close to
[46:50] rapturing condition and you may not even
[46:52] know it because it's been so gradual.
[46:55] That's why we come and hear the
[46:56] preaching of the word. That's why we
[46:57] read our Bibles. That's why we listen to
[46:59] a prophet messenger is because it's
[47:01] doing a work whether we realize it or
[47:03] not. And the way we know it's working is
[47:06] we're changing. Even if it's just a
[47:08] little bit. Even if it's just a little
[47:09] bit. How many of us have children and
[47:11] expect them to do exactly what we want
[47:13] the day we start teaching them? Anybody
[47:16] here have kids that just the minute
[47:17] you've told them everything, they just
[47:18] do it? Even the best of our children,
[47:21] I'm seeing some smirks here. I won't say
[47:22] who's doing it. Even the best of the
[47:24] children, they take a while to grow and
[47:26] mature, don't they? And we're no
[47:27] different. So, we're in a perfecting
[47:29] process that's taking out the bad and
[47:32] filling it back up with the good. It's
[47:34] changing us into his glory. Amen. And
[47:36] that means we've got to sit in a church
[47:37] and we've got to sit under a hearing of
[47:39] the word that corrects us day by day.
[47:42] Paul would say it this way. He says,
[47:44] "And ye have forgotten the exhortation
[47:47] which speaketh unto you as unto
[47:48] children. My son, despise not thou the
[47:51] chastening of the Lord, nor faint when
[47:54] thou art rebuked of him. Anybody have a
[47:56] child that if you even think about
[47:58] spanking them, they just break down.
[48:01] We've got one. The minute that he
[48:04] thinks, he's going to get it. He just
[48:05] breaks down. He can't look at you. He
[48:07] just start he he cries worse before than
[48:09] after.
[48:10] Why? Because he he faints under the idea
[48:13] of chastisement. Paul says, "Don't be
[48:15] like that. Man up.
[48:18] Carry yourself like a child of God.
[48:20] Realize it's for your good. He says,
[48:22] "For whom the Lord
[48:25] loveth." He chastenth. That word
[48:27] chasten. See, we look at chasen as a bad
[48:29] thing. But you got to look at chasing as
[48:31] a whole picture. It means to teach, to
[48:34] train, and instruct. And then discipline
[48:38] follows if necessary. So chastening your
[48:41] child is required. We look at it as the
[48:44] heavy-handed part, but it's not.
[48:45] Chastening is the instruction up front
[48:47] with discipline to enforce it. He says
[48:50] so he chastens, he teaches and trains
[48:52] and disciplines and then if that doesn't
[48:54] work then he scourges. That means he
[48:56] whips or he spanks every son whom he
[48:59] receiveth. He says if you endure
[49:01] chastening God dealth with you as sons
[49:03] for what son is he whom the father
[49:05] chasteth not? He doesn't mean if you put
[49:08] up with it. He says if you're going
[49:09] through correction that proves you're a
[49:12] child of God. Whether you want to do it
[49:14] or not, God will do it with you because
[49:16] you're his child. That's one of the
[49:17] greatest proofs of a child of God is God
[49:19] won't let you get away with anything for
[49:21] long. Why? Because he's trying to get
[49:23] you to a certain result. He's trying to
[49:25] get you to an expected end. He says,
[49:27] "But if you be without chastisement,
[49:30] whereof all are partakers, then ye are
[49:32] ye bastards and not sons." So if you're
[49:34] never taught, never instructed, never
[49:37] disciplined, never corrected, you're not
[49:39] a child of God. Why? because God's a
[49:42] good good father. Listen, if I'm a
[49:44] father and I tell my children what to do
[49:47] and they don't hear me, what do I do? Or
[49:50] they don't act like they hear me. That's
[49:51] more the point, isn't it? Then what do I
[49:53] do? I say it a little louder. I look
[49:55] them in the eye. I make sure that we
[49:57] make a connection and I repeat what I'm
[49:59] training or teaching or asking them to
[50:01] do. Now, if they don't do it, then then
[50:02] what happens? They'll get a little flick
[50:05] on the ear, a little pat on the rear
[50:07] end, maybe. Hey, get doing it. And if
[50:09] they don't do it, then then what
[50:10] happens?
[50:13] The big SWAT, doesn't it? But we don't
[50:15] go from I told you to the big SWAT. But
[50:18] there's a chastening involved that
[50:20] elevates the situation based on the
[50:24] child's response. Amen. But I want the
[50:26] you to see the critical element here.
[50:28] You can't be a child of God and not be
[50:30] corrected. It doesn't work that way. It
[50:32] can't be that way. Amen. We've received
[50:34] the spirit of truth. It's the Holy
[50:36] Spirit. He's our tutor and he's taking
[50:38] us from what we were into what we're
[50:40] supposed to be. And that's a day by day
[50:42] instructing, teaching, chastening,
[50:45] disciplining. Amen. He won't let you get
[50:47] away with anything. Quite the opposite,
[50:49] he'll make sure you don't get away with
[50:51] it so that you learn it in the small
[50:53] times so that when the big times come,
[50:54] you don't make the bigger mistakes. He
[50:57] he chasens us on the small things so
[50:58] that we we're well set by the time we
[51:00] get to the big one. Ever had a service
[51:02] or a series of services where the
[51:04] preacher or the minister just won't get
[51:07] off of a certain thing and it's in your
[51:10] life? What is it? We've all been there.
[51:13] We've all been there. And we we can walk
[51:16] away and we can say, "I hate it." But
[51:18] what is it? It's the Holy Spirit trying
[51:20] to get your attention, trying to let you
[51:22] know, I see what you're doing. That man
[51:24] doesn't have a clue what's going on in
[51:26] your life. But I see what you're doing
[51:28] and I'm trying to get your attention
[51:29] before I have to discipline you, before
[51:31] I have to scourge you, before you reap a
[51:34] harvest you really don't want to reap.
[51:36] It's the It's the grace of God coming
[51:38] over the pulpit, speaking through the
[51:40] ministry to get your attention before
[51:42] you can go too far in those things.
[51:44] Amen. What is it? He's trying to get you
[51:46] before the discipline has to kick in.
[51:49] But what's the problem? Too often in
[51:51] professing Christianity, the church has
[51:53] become a place of affirmation rather
[51:56] than correction. And what is it? They're
[51:58] trying to scratch the itch rather than
[52:00] cure the disease. And so people are
[52:02] coming in and all they get is a pat on
[52:03] the back, a hug around and says, "You're
[52:05] good, my son, my daughter. Go out the
[52:08] door. God loves you." No. If he loved
[52:10] you, he'd be correcting you. And if
[52:12] you're a child of his, he'd be
[52:13] correcting you. What's the problem?
[52:15] We're stuck in this flesh body, church,
[52:17] and it's a battle every day to keep it
[52:19] under subjection from the pulpit all the
[52:21] way back. It's always a battle to keep
[52:24] it. Brother Garfield came in and we were
[52:25] talking just briefly before the service.
[52:27] You get in the wrong atmosphere. You get
[52:29] around the wrong person. You get around
[52:30] the wrong music. You get away from from
[52:33] God just for a little moment and the
[52:36] voices start to come, don't they? And
[52:38] guess what? This flesh loves the voices
[52:40] that are not of God every single time.
[52:42] And you wonder what happened just a
[52:44] little moment. We've got to die daily.
[52:47] Amen. Brother Bram says it this way. He
[52:49] says, "We've adopted every kind of an
[52:51] idea,
[52:53] all kinds of schools and theologies and
[52:55] everything when the Holy Ghost ought to
[52:57] be leading us." He says, "Now that's the
[52:59] reason where the church is in the
[53:00] condition it is tonight." Now, let me
[53:02] say this. That's the reason our families
[53:03] are where they are, good or bad. But
[53:06] he's speaking to the nominal church now.
[53:08] He says the reason it's in the condition
[53:10] it's tonight is it's being man- led and
[53:12] not spiritledd. He says sons and
[53:14] daughters quoting Paul sons and
[53:16] daughters of God are led by the spirit
[53:18] of God. The spirit of God is to lead the
[53:20] church. He says now men might say
[53:22] anything but the Holy Spirit will tell
[53:25] the truth on you. Amen. That's what
[53:27] correction is about. Is about showing
[53:28] you the truth of the situation about who
[53:31] you are, about where your weaknesses
[53:33] are, about where your strengths are,
[53:34] about what God's trying to do in your
[53:36] life. And he's not going to pull his
[53:38] punches if we keep resisting. Amen.
[53:40] We've got to be quick to listen. Amen.
[53:42] But I want you to see, God always has a
[53:44] witness available to us. If we will
[53:47] choose to listen. He's always got a
[53:50] still small voice. He's always got a
[53:52] message. He's always got a ministry.
[53:53] He's got people. He's got prophets. He's
[53:56] got whoever it takes to come in. He's
[53:58] got believers of what? In the body of
[54:01] Christ here to help us through our
[54:03] times. Don't ever think I'm the only one
[54:05] that can give you a word from the Lord.
[54:08] We've got Holy Ghost fil men and women,
[54:10] sons and daughters here tonight that can
[54:13] speak as God would inspire them to help
[54:16] us through our situations in life.
[54:17] Absolutely. But we've got to make sure
[54:19] it's of God. But I want to show you how
[54:21] this looks like. And we're going to
[54:22] spend our whole service on just one main
[54:24] thought and one main story this evening
[54:27] because we're talking about the Holy
[54:28] Ghost will tell the truth on you and how
[54:30] we can come under the influence of even
[54:33] those that claim to be of the household
[54:34] of faith. And we know the story of King
[54:37] Ahab. And remember, he wanted that
[54:39] vineyard that was owned by a man named
[54:40] Nabboth. And Nabboth said, "No, it's my
[54:42] family. It's my inheritance.
[54:44] I don't want to sell it. I don't have to
[54:46] sell it." So Ahab went and he sulked for
[54:48] a while and he went to his wife Jezebel.
[54:50] She says, "Hey, what's going on?" "Well,
[54:52] I want that. I really I really want that
[54:54] vineyard." She says, "Don't worry. I'll
[54:56] get it for you." And she cooked up a
[54:58] couple false witnesses. She got Nabal
[54:59] stone. And she says, "Now go take your
[55:01] vineyard and have fun." Watch what
[55:03] happens.
[55:04] Says, "The word of the Lord came to
[55:06] Elijah the Tishbite, saying, arise. Go
[55:08] down to meet Ahab, king of Israel, which
[55:10] is in Samaria. Behold, he's in the
[55:12] vineyard of Nabth, whether he has gone
[55:14] down to possess it. And thou shalt speak
[55:16] unto him, saying, Thus sayeth the Lord,
[55:18] hast thou killed and also taken
[55:20] possession? And thou shalt speak unto
[55:22] him, saying, Thus sayeth the Lord, in
[55:24] the place where dogs lick the blood of
[55:26] Nabth, shall dogs lick thy blood, even
[55:29] thine. He says, as you killed Nabth, so
[55:31] you will die, and the dogs will lick the
[55:32] blood exactly in the exact same spot.
[55:36] He says, "And Ahab said to Elijah." So
[55:38] he comes down and he says that to him
[55:41] or he comes down to meet him. And Ahab
[55:43] said to Elijah, "Hast thou found me, oh
[55:44] mine enemy?" Now was Elijah Ahab's
[55:47] enemy?
[55:49] Elijah is just a microphone, church. I
[55:51] don't know if you know, but a microphone
[55:52] can't be your enemy. Who's Ahab's enemy?
[55:54] God. Why? Because Ahab has made himself
[55:57] an enemy of God. He's disobeyed God
[55:59] willfully. Amen. So really, it's it's
[56:01] Ahab that's the enemy of God, but he's
[56:03] taking it out on Elijah now. And Elijah
[56:06] answered, "I have found thee because
[56:08] thou hast sold thyself to work evil in
[56:10] the sight of the Lord, consciously
[56:12] decided to do things contrary to the
[56:14] word of God for his own benefit." And it
[56:17] goes through some things. I skipped it
[56:18] for the sake of time. Says at the end
[56:20] there, "But there was none like unto
[56:22] Ahab." Now remember, there's there's two
[56:25] people that the scripture says there's
[56:27] none like them. Job and Ahab. You ever
[56:30] notice that Job was a perfect man. Ahab
[56:34] was the son of predition. That's the
[56:37] kind of person he was. He's the man of
[56:39] sin, right? You got two, there is none
[56:41] like them in all the earth. One of
[56:42] them's Ahab and one of them is Job. This
[56:44] ain't a good description. He says,
[56:46] "Which did sell himself to work
[56:48] wickedness in the sight of the Lord whom
[56:51] Jezebel his wife stirred up." Now, if I
[56:53] don't I don't know about you, but if I
[56:54] heard that said about a man, I probably
[56:56] wouldn't spend a whole lot of time
[56:57] around him.
[56:59] a a man that's under a curse from thus
[57:01] sayeth the Lord by the prophet of that
[57:03] time. I don't think I'd spend a whole
[57:05] lot of time around him. But watch this
[57:07] next chapter because I'm going to preach
[57:08] us into these situations now. And we're
[57:11] in these stories whether we realize it
[57:12] or not. The very next chapter says, "And
[57:15] they continued three and they continued
[57:17] three years without war between Syria
[57:20] and Israel. And it came to pass in the
[57:22] third year that Jehoshaphat, the king of
[57:24] Egypt, came down to the king of Israel."
[57:27] know a little bit about Jehoshaphat.
[57:29] He's a real believer. He's a true man of
[57:32] God. He cleaned up Israel or he cleaned
[57:35] up Judah, I should say. The scripture
[57:37] says he did that which was right in the
[57:39] sight of the Lord. Okay? He's a good
[57:42] man. He's a good person. Amen. But now
[57:45] he's coming to Ahab, the backslider, the
[57:47] false pretended brother. Amen. He's
[57:50] under a curse from God. And I would say
[57:52] this, what in the world is that man
[57:53] doing with that other man? What have I
[57:56] to do with thee? ought to be the
[57:57] question. But something's come up here
[57:59] and what is it? Kings hang out with
[58:01] kings. Kings get together. That's a part
[58:04] of their things that they do. So now
[58:06] Jehoshaphat's tied to another man and
[58:09] he's supposedly of the household of
[58:10] Israel and he comes up. But I want you
[58:12] to see what happens when we get under a
[58:14] sense of obligation,
[58:16] a sense of propriety,
[58:19] a sense of it's expected of us to do
[58:21] certain things. Because when we get in
[58:23] those situations, we've got to be able
[58:25] to see the whole picture, not just
[58:26] what's happening in front of us.
[58:29] It says, "And the king of Israel said to
[58:30] his servants," okay, this king of Israel
[58:32] is Ahab, so I'm going to say it that
[58:33] way. "And Ahab said unto his servants,
[58:35] know ye that Reignth in Gilead is ours,
[58:38] and we be still, and take it not out of
[58:40] the hand of the king of Syria." It says,
[58:43] "And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou
[58:46] go with me to battle to Ramothth
[58:47] Gilead?" And Jehoshaphat said to the
[58:50] king of Israel, I am as thou art. My
[58:52] people as thy people, my horses as thy
[58:55] horses. I I want to put this into
[58:57] perspective. And instead of reading a
[58:59] quote, let me do a bit of a drama. But
[59:01] Ahab, we would say got up in the front
[59:03] of the people. He says, "People, we've
[59:05] got a promise. We've got a land that's
[59:08] been given to us. And I can point you to
[59:11] the words of Moses. And I can point you
[59:13] to the deeds of Joshua where he gave us
[59:15] that land and it belonged to us. But
[59:18] children, the enemy has come into our
[59:20] land. And for too long, we've lost the
[59:22] bread that should feed our children's
[59:24] mouths. Our sons have lost their farms
[59:26] and their houses. We've lost the harvest
[59:29] that belongs to us for too many years.
[59:32] Brothers and sisters, it's time we rose
[59:34] up and took back what belonged to ours.
[59:35] And the church of the living God said,
[59:38] "Amen." Good preaching. Brother Ram said
[59:42] these. It's not my sermon. He said this,
[59:43] okay? But I'm just I'm just make it a
[59:46] little easier than reading it out this
[59:47] morning. You know what? Because what did
[59:49] he do? Ahab's looking to start a revival
[59:53] for his benefit.
[59:55] You see what's happening? He's stirring
[59:57] up the people. Now notice, has anything
[59:59] that Ahab said here incorrect by the
[1:00:02] word? Does that line belong to Israel?
[1:00:06] Yes. Is it belonged to those people for
[1:00:09] that day? Yes. Is it their inheritance?
[1:00:11] Yes. Was it given to them by a promise
[1:00:13] of God? Yes. Nothing he has said here is
[1:00:16] incorrect, church. But remember, you
[1:00:18] can't lose a promise of God if you're
[1:00:20] under the word of God. It's impossible.
[1:00:24] So, if he's lost the promise, that means
[1:00:26] he's out from under the word. And so,
[1:00:28] what Ahab isn't saying is the reason we
[1:00:31] lost it is because I've walked away from
[1:00:33] God. Because that doesn't play well in a
[1:00:35] sermon. People don't get behind you when
[1:00:37] you say, "I've walked away from God."
[1:00:39] So, what does he do? He paints the big
[1:00:41] spiritual promise picture because
[1:00:43] otherwise it would require him to humble
[1:00:45] himself and repent. Because there's only
[1:00:47] one way to get land back that you've
[1:00:49] lost, church, and it's to humble
[1:00:50] yourself and go back to where you left
[1:00:52] God. And Ahab wouldn't do it. And so
[1:00:54] what do they do? He preaches this big
[1:00:56] sermon to to get everybody riled up and
[1:00:58] say, "Hey, we got to go back and take
[1:01:00] back our land." But what's happening?
[1:01:02] And Ahab's trying to tie in the real
[1:01:04] believers
[1:01:06] with the fallen believers, with the
[1:01:08] makeel believers, which the with the
[1:01:11] churchgoers.
[1:01:13] Okay? He's trying to tie them in. He's
[1:01:15] out of the will of God. He's lost the
[1:01:17] promise of God. He's lost lost the land
[1:01:19] that God gave him. And what's his plan
[1:01:22] to get it back, church? Get the real
[1:01:23] overcomers involved.
[1:01:26] Because down in Judah, they're not
[1:01:27] having any of these problems. If you
[1:01:29] notice, they've got all their land.
[1:01:31] They're overcoming. They've got the
[1:01:32] victory against all their enemies. They
[1:01:34] own all of their inheritance. And then
[1:01:36] when they come up, he says, "Hey, how
[1:01:37] about you help us get our inheritance?"
[1:01:40] What's Jehoshaphat's response? Amen,
[1:01:43] brother. We're with you. My men are your
[1:01:45] men. My chariots are your chariots. My
[1:01:47] horses are your horses. Consider us as
[1:01:49] one, brother.
[1:01:51] And what did he do, church? He obliged
[1:01:53] himself to that king, to that fallen
[1:01:56] king, to that unbeliever. He obligated
[1:01:59] himself by his own promise.
[1:02:03] But it's so funny. He obligates himself
[1:02:05] and then he says this. Jehoshaphat said
[1:02:07] unto the king of Israel, inquire, I pray
[1:02:10] thee, at the word of the Lord today.
[1:02:13] Church, learn a lesson. Do that before
[1:02:15] you make your promise.
[1:02:19] Jehoshaphat's a good man,
[1:02:21] a sincere man, a god-fearing,
[1:02:25] wordfollowing man. But in the influence
[1:02:28] of a man that has just as much influence
[1:02:31] as he has, he obligates himself to prove
[1:02:35] what kind of a king he is. I'm with you,
[1:02:38] brother. We're all the same.
[1:02:42] But Ram says this. He says no matter how
[1:02:45] sincere and what good motives and what
[1:02:49] good objectives and how people want
[1:02:51] those things and see the need of it. He
[1:02:55] says there is a will of God to be
[1:02:57] carried out in these things. He says
[1:02:59] that's what I want to drive down tight
[1:03:01] for I want to make this so that you have
[1:03:03] to see it if the spirit of God dwells in
[1:03:06] your in you. He says now catch this
[1:03:08] church. No matter how much it's needed,
[1:03:11] how much everybody agrees that it's
[1:03:13] needed, and how much that that is the
[1:03:16] truth, there is yet one thing to find
[1:03:18] out. He says, "Is that the will of God?"
[1:03:22] Because there, if you go and you
[1:03:24] continue reading this, I I I've been
[1:03:26] listening to this this message. And he
[1:03:27] says there's five things required to
[1:03:29] find out if it's to do to do God a
[1:03:31] service. And the first thing he says is,
[1:03:33] "I is it God's will? Is it God's
[1:03:35] season?" And see, we find the will, but
[1:03:38] we don't find the season, the timing of
[1:03:39] it. And he gets into a couple other
[1:03:41] things. We won't go there tonight. But
[1:03:42] as I was listening to this, I just said,
[1:03:44] "Amen." Because that's just the truth.
[1:03:47] Because so often we can see in our
[1:03:49] lives, we can see this person needs
[1:03:52] this. And there's a promise right there
[1:03:54] for them.
[1:03:56] Absolutely. We see people with health
[1:03:58] needs. We see people with relationship
[1:04:00] needs. We see people with financial
[1:04:02] needs. We see people that have things.
[1:04:04] It's very obvious that they need the
[1:04:06] word of God to come down and produce
[1:04:07] itself in that area of their life. And
[1:04:10] he says, "Look, it doesn't matter how
[1:04:12] much it's needed and how much we all
[1:04:14] agree that it's needed. Find out one
[1:04:17] thing. Is it the will of God?" Why,
[1:04:20] church? Because with these little pea
[1:04:23] brains and these natural eyes, we don't
[1:04:25] see the whole picture. We don't see
[1:04:27] everything that's going on in these
[1:04:28] things. Now, Jehoshaphat's making the
[1:04:30] right move here, but he makes it too
[1:04:32] late.
[1:04:34] Now, he has a chance to correct himself,
[1:04:36] and we'll see as we go. But I want you
[1:04:38] to see the power of influence in in a
[1:04:41] setting where you're treating the other
[1:04:43] person as if they're necessarily in the
[1:04:45] same place that you are with God.
[1:04:49] I'm preaching to a church now. We're all
[1:04:51] believers, but that doesn't mean every
[1:04:53] one of us is always in the will of God
[1:04:55] with what we decide to do.
[1:04:58] And it can be easy to fall under the
[1:05:00] influence of somebody that's doing
[1:05:01] something and it appears to be good. It
[1:05:03] appears to be getting results or it
[1:05:05] appears to satisfy a need that the
[1:05:07] scripture says it it will fulfill. And
[1:05:10] we can get suckered into those things
[1:05:13] because of who that person is or because
[1:05:14] we respect them, because we love them,
[1:05:16] because they're our friend, or these
[1:05:17] different things. Amen.
[1:05:21] You're not tied to any believer's
[1:05:23] actions ever. You're not obliged to do
[1:05:26] what another believer says you should
[1:05:28] do. Amen. That's not the way that things
[1:05:31] work. Amen. We don't follow somebody
[1:05:33] else's vision. We don't follow somebody
[1:05:35] else's plan. Even if they're a church
[1:05:36] member, church, we're tied to Christ.
[1:05:39] The word. Christ the word. Amen. And
[1:05:43] that's where our our security is. Amen.
[1:05:46] Never get sucked into a good story, a
[1:05:49] good promise, a good plan. Stay with the
[1:05:52] word. Amen. and stay there until you get
[1:05:54] a good answer, a straight answer from
[1:05:56] God. Watch what happens now. It says,
[1:05:58] "Then the king of Israel,
[1:06:00] Ahab, Ahab gathered the prophets
[1:06:03] together, about 400 men, and said unto
[1:06:06] them, shall I go up against Ramothth
[1:06:07] Gilead to battle, or shall I forebear?"
[1:06:10] And they said, "Go up, for the Lord
[1:06:12] shall deliver it into the hand of the
[1:06:14] king." Now, watch the order of events
[1:06:16] here. Now, there's nothing here that
[1:06:18] says that the pri you know, the prophets
[1:06:20] went to a quiet place. They went down.
[1:06:23] They didn't gather any minstrels. They
[1:06:24] didn't go to a quiet place. They didn't
[1:06:26] go inquire of God. He asked, they
[1:06:28] answered.
[1:06:30] Okay? Amen. What happens here is the
[1:06:33] prophets are responding directly to the
[1:06:36] king's question and in their
[1:06:38] presumption, they speak for God. Okay?
[1:06:42] They did not say, "Thus sayeth the Lord
[1:06:44] here." They just said, "God will give
[1:06:46] you back the land." They presumed to
[1:06:49] know what the answer was instead of
[1:06:51] seeking the answer. Prophet says this
[1:06:53] very very tightly. He says, "So these
[1:06:56] men looked upon it in a natural sense
[1:06:59] and said it belongs to us." He says,
[1:07:01] "But you see, they didn't find the word
[1:07:04] and will of God." Now catch that. It's a
[1:07:06] spiritual promise. They looked at it
[1:07:08] from a natural standpoint and said that
[1:07:10] belongs to us. Therefore, we will go up
[1:07:13] and get it and God will be with us. But
[1:07:15] they didn't look at it through God's
[1:07:16] eyes. They didn't look at how they lost
[1:07:18] it in the first place. They didn't look
[1:07:20] at the symptoms. They just looked at the
[1:07:22] promise and they said, "The promise says
[1:07:24] that land belongs to us." Do you see the
[1:07:26] trap being laid here? They're looking at
[1:07:29] the promise rather than the situation.
[1:07:32] They're not seeing the full picture.
[1:07:33] Amen. Can I bring it to our doorstep
[1:07:35] this evening? Somebody can come up to
[1:07:37] us. A brother or sister come up and say,
[1:07:39] "Brother, sister, I need a better job.
[1:07:42] I'm not able to pay my bills. I'm
[1:07:44] falling behind on my rent or my
[1:07:46] mortgage. My car is breaking down. I've
[1:07:48] got health issues. It seems like every
[1:07:50] time I try and save a dollar, I can't
[1:07:52] get ahead. I need a better job. Will you
[1:07:55] pray with me? And what would we
[1:07:57] generally say? Yes, brother. Yes,
[1:07:59] sister. I'll pray for you.
[1:08:03] Why? Because they're our brother or
[1:08:04] sister.
[1:08:07] But the question is, what's the big
[1:08:09] picture? I've had people talk to me
[1:08:12] about their finances, and they've got a
[1:08:14] phone that's three generations newer
[1:08:15] than mine, wearing a pair of sneakers
[1:08:17] that cost triple what mine does, and
[1:08:19] driving a brand new car.
[1:08:22] So, the question is not, do you need a
[1:08:24] new job, it's do you spend appropriate
[1:08:27] to how you earn? Because if you got more
[1:08:31] and you're not making more, then the
[1:08:34] problem isn't the job. The problem's the
[1:08:35] brother or sister and their habits and
[1:08:37] these things. But our inclination is to
[1:08:40] say yes brother, yes sister, I'll pray
[1:08:41] that you get a new job rather than
[1:08:44] saying brother or sister can we look at
[1:08:46] the situation a little closer. You know
[1:08:48] the first thing I ask people struggling
[1:08:49] with finances do you pay your tithe?
[1:08:55] And you know what I often get back? I
[1:08:57] can't afford to pay my tithe. I use
[1:09:00] brother Matt's response. I can't afford
[1:09:03] not to pay my tithe because I've never
[1:09:06] seen the righteous forsaken nor see
[1:09:07] bacon bread. You want to be blessed
[1:09:09] financially, you give back to God
[1:09:11] because that's the only place where he
[1:09:13] promised that he'd pour out a blessing
[1:09:14] that you can't contain.
[1:09:17] I talked to a business owner this week,
[1:09:20] a believer. He says, "I tithe on my
[1:09:23] gross from my business before expenses."
[1:09:28] Now, if you've ever operated a business
[1:09:30] or managed the bottom line of a
[1:09:32] business, can you imagine that? Can you
[1:09:34] imagine brother Mark do managing an $80
[1:09:36] million division?
[1:09:39] Yeah, I would smile. I would smile.
[1:09:42] Praise the Lord. Business owners.
[1:09:44] Increase your faith. Brother Joe,
[1:09:46] Brother Kingsley, and Brother Chad, who
[1:09:48] are not here conveniently tonight,
[1:09:51] right? Can you imagine? And he said, "He
[1:09:55] has never failed me yet."
[1:09:58] I said, "Brother, I'll give more power
[1:10:01] to you." That's not what God required.
[1:10:02] God said, "Give me a tithe of your
[1:10:04] increase." He says, "I'll give you a
[1:10:06] tithe on everything you bring through my
[1:10:08] door."
[1:10:10] Wow. That's faith.
[1:10:13] But you know what? You can't afford not
[1:10:16] to pay your tithes. I remember being in
[1:10:19] university and my wife and I told that
[1:10:20] story. We were down to 10 cents in the
[1:10:22] bank account and a bill coming out the
[1:10:23] next day and God provided and we got
[1:10:24] Mary Browns and our bill paid. Why?
[1:10:26] Because I've never seen the righteous
[1:10:28] forsaken nor seed begging bread. See,
[1:10:30] too often we want God to give us the
[1:10:32] promise rather than change us. Because
[1:10:35] the real promise is the changing us.
[1:10:37] That's what I'm looking for. I'm looking
[1:10:38] for a change church. I'm not looking for
[1:10:40] a band-aid. And a new job's just a
[1:10:42] band-aid. I remember I was talking to a
[1:10:45] a former pastor of mine. And I had this
[1:10:47] big idea that could have made me really,
[1:10:49] really, really, really rich, I thought.
[1:10:51] And I went to him and I said, I met with
[1:10:53] him and with my wife and I said,
[1:10:55] "Brother, I'm worried that if I get all
[1:10:58] this money, I'm going to change." And
[1:11:00] you know what he did? He started
[1:11:02] laughing at me. He said, "Brother John,"
[1:11:05] he says, "you won't change no matter
[1:11:08] what." He says, "Cuz that's just the way
[1:11:10] you are. The way you are now is the way
[1:11:11] you'd be if you had millions or if you
[1:11:12] had a penny to your name." But the thing
[1:11:14] is, if we need to be changed, it's not
[1:11:17] going to fix us by giving us more money.
[1:11:19] We need to change who we are. We need to
[1:11:21] change the way they do things. But what
[1:11:23] is it is that we'll get suckered into
[1:11:25] it. And yes, that's what we're doing.
[1:11:26] We'll get suckered into the the story,
[1:11:29] the feeling, the emotion, the loss, the
[1:11:31] hardship, rather than stepping back and
[1:11:34] saying, "Where is God in this
[1:11:35] situation?" Because if God is a God of
[1:11:38] his promises and the promises aren't
[1:11:39] hitting you, then there's a problem
[1:11:41] somewhere. There's a problem somewhere.
[1:11:43] Amen. We're being f pulled into the
[1:11:45] feeling of it. Amen. We're getting
[1:11:47] suckered into the situation rather than
[1:11:48] pulled into revelation. And it's the
[1:11:51] influence of that brother or sister
[1:11:52] that's trying to get us involved in
[1:11:54] their in their circumstance. And it's
[1:11:56] okay to get involved. Just make sure
[1:11:57] you're getting involved by being led by
[1:11:59] the spirit, not being led around by the
[1:12:00] nose. Totally different situation. But
[1:12:03] watch now. These these prophets, 400 or
[1:12:06] so of them come in. They say, "God's
[1:12:07] going to give you back the land." And
[1:12:09] Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here a
[1:12:11] prophet of the Lord besides that we
[1:12:14] might inquire of him?" Now watch what's
[1:12:15] ch what watch what's happening here
[1:12:17] church because Jehoshaphat's looking for
[1:12:19] thus sayeth the Lord and he hasn't heard
[1:12:22] thus sayeth the Lord. All he's heard is
[1:12:24] that some people that claim to be
[1:12:26] prophets according to the king said yes
[1:12:28] go up the Lord will give it to you
[1:12:29] church. What is it? This is what a child
[1:12:31] of God does is they're looking for
[1:12:33] shity. They're looking for assurance.
[1:12:36] They're looking for thus sayeth the
[1:12:37] Lord. And so he says hey I understand
[1:12:40] these are prophets but do you have a
[1:12:41] prophet of the Lord?
[1:12:44] somebody that will say speak for the
[1:12:46] Lord and say, "Thus sayeth the Lord."
[1:12:48] Says, "And the king of Israel, Ahab said
[1:12:50] unto Josh, there is yet one man, Micaiah
[1:12:53] the son of Imla, by whom we may inquire
[1:12:55] of the Lord, but I hate him, for he does
[1:12:58] not prophesy good concerning me, but
[1:13:00] evil. Whenever I go to that preacher's
[1:13:02] church, he always preaches at me." He
[1:13:04] says, "And Jehoshaphat said, let not the
[1:13:06] king say so." Joshua said, "Come on,
[1:13:08] Ahab, he can't be that bad. Don't say
[1:13:11] that about a prophet."
[1:13:13] It says, ' Then the king of Israel
[1:13:14] called an officer and said, "Hasten
[1:13:16] hither Micaiah the son of Imla." It
[1:13:18] says, "And the king of Israel,
[1:13:20] Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, sat each
[1:13:21] on his throne, having put on their robes
[1:13:24] in a void place in the entrance of the
[1:13:26] gate of Samaria, and all the prophets
[1:13:28] prophesied before them." Now, notice the
[1:13:31] order of events here because it matters
[1:13:33] later. There's a hard scripture coming
[1:13:34] up, and if we don't see the order of
[1:13:36] events, we'll not understand it. Okay?
[1:13:38] First, the prophets answered the king's
[1:13:41] question out of their own heart.
[1:13:44] They presumed to speak for God. They
[1:13:47] answered in the role of a prophet, but
[1:13:49] without the anointing of a prophet.
[1:13:52] Okay? They answered out of their own
[1:13:53] opinion. In other words, they used the
[1:13:56] the the authority of their prophetic
[1:13:58] office as a platform to support the
[1:14:01] king. Okay? After that, and only after
[1:14:05] that, did they start to prophesy. They
[1:14:08] did not prophesy before. They just said.
[1:14:11] But now it clearly says they prophesied.
[1:14:13] Amen. And now before they weren't under
[1:14:16] a specific anointing. They would be
[1:14:18] under an anointing to prophesy. Before
[1:14:20] they just said yes, go up. But now
[1:14:23] they're prophesying. Amen. Before
[1:14:25] they're in agreement. Now they're in an
[1:14:27] agreement. But now they're in an
[1:14:28] agreement under an anointing.
[1:14:31] Okay.
[1:14:33] They presume to answer through the
[1:14:34] prophetic office. But now they start to
[1:14:37] prophesy. Amen.
[1:14:39] But they're under an anointing. And
[1:14:40] watch what it does. Zedekiah the son of
[1:14:43] Chenana made him horns of iron. Church.
[1:14:46] They must have been there a while.
[1:14:48] Made him horns of iron. And he said,
[1:14:50] "Thus sayeth the Lord, with these shalt
[1:14:52] thou push the Syrians until thou have
[1:14:55] consumed them." Zedekiah never said,
[1:14:57] "Thus sayeth the Lord before this." But
[1:14:58] now he's saying, "Thus saith the Lord."
[1:15:02] And all the prophets prophesied, saying,
[1:15:05] "Go up to Ramothth Gilead and prosper,
[1:15:07] for the Lord shall deliver it into the
[1:15:09] king's hand." They're repeating the same
[1:15:11] thing they said before. Before it was an
[1:15:13] answer. Now it's a prophecy. Okay?
[1:15:16] They're saying the same thing they said
[1:15:19] before. They're in an echo chamber. It
[1:15:22] says, "And the messenger that was gone
[1:15:23] to call Micaiah spake unto them, saying,
[1:15:25] "Behold now, the words of the prophets
[1:15:27] declare good unto the king with one
[1:15:29] mouth. Let thy word, I pray thee, be
[1:15:32] like the word of one of them, and speak
[1:15:34] that which is good. Here's the trap.
[1:15:36] Here's the hook being set. The messenger
[1:15:38] comes to the prophet of the Lord, and he
[1:15:41] says, "Listen, all the other churches
[1:15:43] are saying this. All the other ministers
[1:15:46] are saying this. All the other prophets
[1:15:48] are saying this.
[1:15:51] Say the same thing." We need to be
[1:15:54] united, brother Micah.
[1:15:57] Right? We need to be united. Don't break
[1:16:00] the unity of the fellowship of the
[1:16:01] brothers. Say what they're saying.
[1:16:06] So now Micah is under pressure.
[1:16:10] He's got a choice to make, church.
[1:16:13] Do I say what they say or do I go find
[1:16:16] out what God would say? But he has a
[1:16:18] choice. He has a choice. Amen.
[1:16:22] Now, let me say this. Were those men
[1:16:24] false prophets?
[1:16:29] some unsure faces.
[1:16:31] Were they false prophets? No, these were
[1:16:34] prophets of the Lord. And we'll see as
[1:16:36] we go through. Okay. Were they
[1:16:39] insincere?
[1:16:40] Were they pretended brothers?
[1:16:43] No.
[1:16:45] These were men that have been used
[1:16:47] before to speak for God. Watch what the
[1:16:50] prophet of God says. He says, ' And one
[1:16:52] of them, the chief Zedekiah, he put two
[1:16:54] horns and said, "Thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:16:56] By this," and he says, "Now that man was
[1:16:59] sincere." He says, "By this you will
[1:17:01] push your enemy plum back into their
[1:17:03] lands and take what belongs to God. It's
[1:17:06] given to you." He says, "I don't believe
[1:17:07] he was a hypocrite. I believe he was a
[1:17:10] good man. I believe all those prophets
[1:17:12] were." You see where we can fit, church?
[1:17:16] I trust we're all sincere. I trust we're
[1:17:18] all good men and women, good brothers,
[1:17:20] good sisters.
[1:17:22] He says, "You say prophets." He says,
[1:17:24] "Yes, remember the very man that
[1:17:26] consented to kill Jesus Christ
[1:17:28] prophesied because it was his office. He
[1:17:30] was high priest that year. And being
[1:17:32] that he had that office and held that
[1:17:34] office, the spirit of God came to him."
[1:17:36] He says that didn't mean he was saved or
[1:17:38] anything about it. And he prophesied
[1:17:40] Caiaphas because it was his office that
[1:17:42] did it. And these prophets being
[1:17:44] prophets of the office of prophet
[1:17:46] prophesied and the spirit of God came on
[1:17:49] them men with gifts of the spirit. He's
[1:17:51] not saying they prophesied by the spirit
[1:17:53] of God here. He's saying in the past
[1:17:55] they had prophesied. That's what made
[1:17:56] them prophets. What they had said had
[1:17:58] come to pass. God had used them as
[1:18:01] gifted men. Amen. So they were real
[1:18:03] prophets with real gifts and God would
[1:18:05] use them to speak to the people. Now
[1:18:07] catch this. I I talked about this
[1:18:08] briefly last service. He says, "But man,
[1:18:11] many times a man, God can deal with them
[1:18:14] and give them a gift." He says, "And the
[1:18:16] people will squeeze in on those people,
[1:18:19] and if they're not perfectly called and
[1:18:22] sent of God, they'll cause that man or
[1:18:25] woman to say something that isn't his
[1:18:27] will because the people constrain them
[1:18:30] to do it." He doesn't say those people
[1:18:34] aren't called. He says you weren't
[1:18:36] called to go squeeze them.
[1:18:38] You weren't called to put pressure on
[1:18:40] that brother or on that sister. And
[1:18:42] that's what Ahab was doing was Ahab was
[1:18:44] squeezing, he was constraining those
[1:18:46] prophets. He told them what he was going
[1:18:48] to do. And that put pressure on them to
[1:18:51] confirm him as a brother.
[1:18:54] Okay.
[1:18:57] He says, "Now, I had to catch up with
[1:18:59] our own little pastor here on it." He
[1:19:02] says, "Out here in the woods one morning
[1:19:03] about 3:00 in the morning, it said, "Go
[1:19:05] tell brother Neville." He says, "I come
[1:19:07] to you, didn't I, brother Neville?"
[1:19:08] Everybody was saying, "Brother Neville,
[1:19:10] prophesy over me. Tell me this or that."
[1:19:12] See, he says, "And you'd have him saying
[1:19:14] things then that wouldn't come to pass."
[1:19:17] He says, "They that wait to find out
[1:19:20] what the Lord wants to do." He says,
[1:19:22] "See, you see what I'm talking about?
[1:19:26] You can put pressure on people or people
[1:19:28] can put pressure on you to line up with
[1:19:31] what they're thinking, seeing,
[1:19:32] believing, doing, acting on
[1:19:35] in all sorts of areas of life. And
[1:19:39] they'll say, "Brother, get on board with
[1:19:40] me. Sister, come on. Let's do this." And
[1:19:44] what do they do? They put pressure on
[1:19:45] you to do what they are led to do.
[1:19:49] And here's the thing, church. They're
[1:19:51] the ones that are led. You got to find
[1:19:54] out if you're led the same way. and not
[1:19:56] based on what they're saying to you.
[1:19:57] Amen.
[1:19:59] You know what people do? They'll say,
[1:20:01] "I've prayed about this and this is what
[1:20:03] I feel led to do. Will you join me in
[1:20:06] it?"
[1:20:08] And what does it do? It puts a pressure
[1:20:10] on you. Because they're saying, "Here I
[1:20:12] come, Brother Bob. Brother Bob, I feel
[1:20:16] led to start a church in Hawaii. I
[1:20:18] prayed about this. Now, are you in,
[1:20:20] brother?"
[1:20:22] Now, see, he's under a false anointing.
[1:20:26] because it's an anointing of sunshine
[1:20:29] and constant good weather. But the thing
[1:20:32] is that now he's in a jam because guess
[1:20:36] what? I think he respects me as his
[1:20:38] pastor. Amen.
[1:20:41] And so I can use that influence to say
[1:20:43] now, brother Bob, the Lord has showed me
[1:20:46] something. Are you in or are you out?
[1:20:49] And now if he says I'm in, it can be
[1:20:53] responding to brother John, brother
[1:20:55] John's influence.
[1:20:57] I want a salary,
[1:21:00] whatever it might be. I want to be part
[1:21:02] of something different.
[1:21:04] I can't believe he's the first one. I'm
[1:21:06] the first one that he's asked. But the
[1:21:09] other thing is I put pressure on him to
[1:21:12] not say no.
[1:21:14] Because if he rejects me, he's really
[1:21:17] telling me, "Your vision might not be
[1:21:19] correct." You see how we can do that to
[1:21:22] a person? We can tell them, "I've prayed
[1:21:25] about it, and this is what the Lord has
[1:21:27] showed me." And we make God's will for
[1:21:29] us God's will for them.
[1:21:32] Well, what's the antidote, church?
[1:21:35] What's the antidote, Brother Bob? You
[1:21:37] say, "Brother John, I'm going to go pray
[1:21:39] about it." And that's what I know
[1:21:42] Brother Bob would do. But that's what we
[1:21:44] need to be able to stand up and say is,
[1:21:46] "Brother, sister, let me pray about it."
[1:21:50] And what does that do? It gives you time
[1:21:52] to pull back, get out of the the sphere
[1:21:55] of influence that is natural and get
[1:21:58] under a heavenly influence.
[1:22:00] It gives you time to set back and get
[1:22:03] the bigger picture. Amen.
[1:22:08] Otherwise, what is it? We have an echo
[1:22:10] chamber gospel where personalities and
[1:22:12] influences and this one says this one
[1:22:15] and that one says that one and we got to
[1:22:16] get on board, brother John. And other
[1:22:17] churches are doing this and they're
[1:22:19] singing this and they're going that. No,
[1:22:20] no, no, church. We're sovereign. You're
[1:22:23] sovereign. Not we're sovereign. You're
[1:22:25] sovereign. Each one of us is sovereign
[1:22:27] to God. Amen. And here's the thing. If
[1:22:29] it's not of God, it's going to lead to
[1:22:31] destruction. And your name and your
[1:22:33] reputation are tied to it. We have to be
[1:22:35] so careful we're not led by somebody
[1:22:37] else's vision rather than the leadership
[1:22:38] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:22:41] How do we handle it? Pray and wait. Pray
[1:22:46] and wait and then pray and wait some
[1:22:48] more. Church, there's no hurry. And if
[1:22:51] there's a hurry and you're sincere, God
[1:22:53] will give you an answer in a hurry. But
[1:22:55] otherwise, there is no hurry to these
[1:22:57] things. God will reveal his will, his
[1:22:59] will, and he'll make it sure for you in
[1:23:01] your life. Watch this. Now it says, "And
[1:23:04] Micaiah said, he's a real prophet. As
[1:23:06] the Lord liveth, what the Lord saith
[1:23:07] unto me, that will I speak." Church,
[1:23:09] this is not just a sincere prophet. This
[1:23:11] is a disciplined prophet.
[1:23:14] See, you got to have discipline. Don't
[1:23:16] get caught up in the moment.
[1:23:19] Sometimes it plays to our ego that
[1:23:21] somebody's asking us to do something
[1:23:22] with and for them. Don't let your pride
[1:23:25] get lifted up in this. Amen. Seek the
[1:23:28] Lord. This is what makes him a prophet
[1:23:30] of the Lord is he says I'm going to find
[1:23:32] out what the Lord says and I'm going to
[1:23:33] say that buddy. So he came to the king
[1:23:36] and the king said unto him Micaiah shall
[1:23:38] we go against Ramothgilead to battle or
[1:23:40] shall we forare and he answered him and
[1:23:42] he said go and prosper for the Lord
[1:23:44] shall deliver it into the hand of the
[1:23:46] king and I think he said it just like
[1:23:47] that when I read this church I I
[1:23:49] literally laughed out loud because I
[1:23:51] know the story. You know what he was
[1:23:52] doing here? You know what he was doing,
[1:23:55] brother Paul? He was trolling Ahab.
[1:23:57] That's what we'd say today.
[1:23:59] Cuz remember, he never says anything
[1:24:01] good to Ahab. And he comes up and he
[1:24:03] says the exact same thing everyone else
[1:24:05] says. Watch what Ahab says. The king
[1:24:08] says unto him, "How many times shall I
[1:24:10] adjure thee that thou tell me nothing
[1:24:11] but that which is true in the name of
[1:24:13] the Lord." Now, do you think Ahab
[1:24:14] typically said that?
[1:24:16] No. But he's got to put on a show for
[1:24:19] the brothers.
[1:24:22] He says, "And I said, and he said, I saw
[1:24:25] all Israel scattered up upon the hills
[1:24:28] as sheep that have not a shepherd. And
[1:24:30] the Lord said, "These have no master.
[1:24:32] Let them return every man to his house
[1:24:34] in peace." These have no master. The
[1:24:36] king is dead. Long live the king.
[1:24:39] Ahab, you're dead. And the army gets
[1:24:41] scattered.
[1:24:42] And the king of Israel said unto
[1:24:44] Jehoshaphat, "Did not I tell thee that
[1:24:46] he would prophesy no good concerning me
[1:24:48] but evil?" Church, why does Ahab always
[1:24:50] get an evil report? Cuz Ahab's evil.
[1:24:55] Why is the preacher always preaching at
[1:24:56] me? Because you won't do what the
[1:24:58] preacher keeps telling you to do.
[1:25:01] Come on. Been there, done that from both
[1:25:04] sides of the pulpit. I see the young
[1:25:06] people laughing at me. As young people,
[1:25:08] we get it so bad, don't we? I mean, I'm
[1:25:11] not a young person anymore. I understand
[1:25:12] that. But young people, boy, I got it a
[1:25:15] lot, especially as a young people. Why?
[1:25:17] Because we don't listen so well. And
[1:25:19] we're learning to lean. That's what
[1:25:21] we're doing. We're learning to lean in
[1:25:23] these things. Amen.
[1:25:26] If you're sick of the music,
[1:25:28] change the channel. How do you change
[1:25:31] the channel? Get in the will of God. You
[1:25:34] don't like what the preacher's
[1:25:35] preaching, get him off it by doing what
[1:25:37] he's been telling you to do. That's it.
[1:25:40] Brother Bam, every time he'd come back
[1:25:41] to California, he'd say, "You're worse
[1:25:42] than the last time I was here. I keep
[1:25:44] telling you women not to bob your hair,
[1:25:46] not to do this, and not to do that." He
[1:25:47] says, "And every time there's more and
[1:25:49] more of you doing it." So, guess what?
[1:25:51] He never got to move past clean up your
[1:25:54] lives because that's all they would do.
[1:25:57] Amen. God's not going to stop correcting
[1:25:59] us until we start lining up with his
[1:26:01] word. And Ahab's constant negative
[1:26:03] prophecy against him was just a
[1:26:05] reflection that Ahab would never repent.
[1:26:07] He'd never humble himself.
[1:26:10] Did you know some people will listen to
[1:26:11] a negative service and come out blessed?
[1:26:15] You know why? Because it affirmed them
[1:26:18] in the decisions they made in their
[1:26:20] life.
[1:26:21] And I say a negative service, you know
[1:26:23] what I mean? Hard preaching. And they'll
[1:26:25] come out and they'll say that was a
[1:26:27] wonderful service. Why? Because they've
[1:26:29] already been under the effect of that
[1:26:31] message and they've done what it said.
[1:26:33] So it doesn't hurt. It doesn't bother
[1:26:34] them. It doesn't hurt their conscience.
[1:26:36] But somebody else will come out and
[1:26:37] they'll say, "Oh, I wish he'd move on
[1:26:40] from that.
[1:26:42] Why is he preaching like that?"
[1:26:45] And their attitude tells you because it
[1:26:47] pinned them to the wall and they didn't
[1:26:49] like it.
[1:26:51] Amen.
[1:26:53] They're wanting a different gospel
[1:26:55] instead of a different life.
[1:26:57] And so they won't change. And so the
[1:26:59] channel won't change. And so it says
[1:27:01] Paul said, "They went out from us
[1:27:03] because they're not of us." And
[1:27:04] eventually the word will drive them out
[1:27:05] because they won't stay there. They
[1:27:06] can't sit under that time and time
[1:27:08] again.
[1:27:10] Says, "And he said, hear thou therefore
[1:27:12] the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord."
[1:27:14] He now he's going to explain the whole
[1:27:16] situation. Okay? Remember what the
[1:27:18] prophet said, "The Holy Ghost will tell
[1:27:19] the truth on you." He says, "Hear thou
[1:27:21] therefore the word of the Lord. I saw
[1:27:23] the Lord sitting on his throne and all
[1:27:25] the host of heaven standing by him on
[1:27:28] his right hand and his left." And the
[1:27:29] Lord said, "Who shall persuade Ahab that
[1:27:32] he may go up and fall at Ramothth
[1:27:33] Gilead?" And one said on this manner,
[1:27:36] and another said on that manner. So a
[1:27:37] bunch of different spirits were giving
[1:27:40] advice and saying how they could do
[1:27:42] this. says, ' And there came forth a
[1:27:44] spirit and stood before the Lord and
[1:27:45] said, I'll persuade him. And the Lord
[1:27:48] said unto him, wherewith how you going
[1:27:49] to do it, buddy? How are you going to
[1:27:51] get them to do it? And he said, I will
[1:27:53] go forth and I will be a lying spirit in
[1:27:56] the mouth of all
[1:28:00] his prophets.
[1:28:02] See, now we start to see the big
[1:28:04] picture.
[1:28:05] Were those men sincere? Prophet of God
[1:28:08] told us they were sincere. Church,
[1:28:10] were they gifted? Yep. But what
[1:28:13] happened? They come into an echo chamber
[1:28:16] where the king said and they repeated.
[1:28:22] They're no longer God's prophets.
[1:28:24] They're Ahab's prophets. He's
[1:28:26] constraining them. He's squeezing them.
[1:28:28] He's influencing them to give him
[1:28:30] favorable terms. He says, "And he said,
[1:28:33] God said, thou shalt persuade him and
[1:28:35] prevail also. Go forth and do so." God
[1:28:37] says, "That's perfect. Go do that.
[1:28:39] That'll work." He says, "Now therefore,
[1:28:41] behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit
[1:28:43] in the mouth of all these prophets, and
[1:28:46] the Lord has spoken evil concerning
[1:28:49] thee." Now, remember I said there's a
[1:28:51] hard verse coming up. This is the hard
[1:28:53] verse because he's saying God's looking
[1:28:55] to fulfill his word and he just did it
[1:28:58] through some sincere men
[1:29:01] with a lying spirit, no less.
[1:29:06] Now, how do you break that down? God
[1:29:08] sent a lying spirit to sincere people to
[1:29:12] tell them to prophesy incorrectly.
[1:29:15] How do you how do you how do you line
[1:29:16] that up?
[1:29:19] Remember, when that spirit came down,
[1:29:22] they had already presumed.
[1:29:24] And so therefore, they were a willing
[1:29:27] recipient of that lying spirit because
[1:29:29] they had already spoken the lie out of
[1:29:31] their own heart
[1:29:33] in sincerity.
[1:29:35] And so all that lying spirit did was it
[1:29:37] came down and it confirmed the very
[1:29:39] thing they'd already said. And because
[1:29:41] it was an echo chamber gospel, it
[1:29:44] confirmed what they had already said.
[1:29:46] They said, "That's it." Because
[1:29:48] remember, they didn't have an anointing
[1:29:49] first. They just answered. But when the
[1:29:51] anointing came down, the anointing they
[1:29:53] got matched the thing they'd said. What
[1:29:55] they'd said was a lie. The only
[1:29:56] anointing left was a lying spirit. And
[1:29:59] when that lying spirit came down, it was
[1:30:02] so in tune with them and their spirit in
[1:30:05] that moment that they presumed that that
[1:30:08] was the Holy Spirit.
[1:30:11] You see how close it can be, church?
[1:30:13] Insincerity.
[1:30:15] Insincerity. Amen.
[1:30:18] What was the trap, church? They were
[1:30:20] trying to claim a promise of God without
[1:30:23] going through the word of God. because
[1:30:25] there's only one way to get Ramoth
[1:30:27] Gilead back. Repent and return back to
[1:30:30] the word. But instead, they said, "Let's
[1:30:32] join up together with the overcomers and
[1:30:34] let's go get it." They were trying to go
[1:30:36] around the word of God. We'd say today,
[1:30:38] they were aiding and abetting a
[1:30:39] spiritual criminal.
[1:30:41] They were helping Ahab to continue on
[1:30:43] his bad ways.
[1:30:45] That's all they were doing there. Amen.
[1:30:47] They were being led around by their own
[1:30:49] desire to please the king. And so that
[1:30:52] when that lying spirit came, they
[1:30:55] willingly received it because it matched
[1:30:56] up with what they had been saying all
[1:30:58] along.
[1:31:00] That's an amazing statement, church.
[1:31:01] These were real prophets. They knew what
[1:31:04] it meant to prophesy, thus sayeth the
[1:31:06] Lord. And when this anointing, this
[1:31:08] lying spirit came down, it was so close
[1:31:11] to the real thing that they said that
[1:31:13] was the spirit of God.
[1:31:16] Amen. Remember what the scripture says?
[1:31:19] That that spirit will be so close it
[1:31:21] will deceive the very elect if it were
[1:31:24] possible.
[1:31:25] Church, do you know what makes it
[1:31:27] impossible?
[1:31:29] Because she's a word bride. She takes it
[1:31:32] back to the word. She doesn't take it
[1:31:34] back to the preacher. She doesn't take
[1:31:36] it back to the feelings of the service.
[1:31:38] She doesn't take it back to the
[1:31:39] uncction, the emotion. She doesn't take
[1:31:42] it back to the the the greatness of the
[1:31:44] man that's saying the words. She takes
[1:31:46] it back to the word. The spirit can't
[1:31:48] fool her because she's not led by a
[1:31:50] spirit. She's led by the word itself.
[1:31:52] That's the only way we're going to get
[1:31:53] through. Church,
[1:31:55] what happened here? The Holy Spirit told
[1:31:57] the truth on them. God sent a witness to
[1:32:00] make it all clear. Prophet of God says
[1:32:02] this. He says, "Then Micaiah came down
[1:32:05] and he had a vision. He examined first
[1:32:08] you notice and said, wait, give me
[1:32:10] tonight. Let me find out and tomorrow
[1:32:11] maybe I can answer you." He wasn't right
[1:32:13] quick with thus sayeth the Lord in
[1:32:15] agreement with the other prophets. He
[1:32:16] said I'll only speak what God says. And
[1:32:19] the next day we find out God told him
[1:32:20] what would happen. He says and it was
[1:32:22] absolutely contrary to the others. He
[1:32:25] said the whole school it was contrary.
[1:32:27] Remember they had a school of the
[1:32:28] prophets. He says what he said was
[1:32:30] contrary to the entire school of
[1:32:32] prophets. And even one of them walked up
[1:32:34] and smacked him in the face for it. He
[1:32:36] says but we see he waited. And when he
[1:32:39] did that, he compared his prophecy, his
[1:32:41] vision with the written word, and it was
[1:32:44] right with the word. Why? Because Ahab
[1:32:46] had said, or Elijah had said, Ahab's
[1:32:49] going to die.
[1:32:51] Ahab's going to die. And so when he got
[1:32:54] his message, he compared it with the
[1:32:56] word. Do you know, brother Brandham said
[1:32:58] he did the same thing? Though we or an
[1:33:01] angel preach any other gospel, brother
[1:33:04] Brandham did not rely on the fact that
[1:33:06] an angel spoke to him. He took it back
[1:33:08] to the word. That's an amazing thing
[1:33:12] because I can I be honest? I tend to
[1:33:15] think if I had a supernatural experience
[1:33:17] and an angel came down and told me
[1:33:18] something, I'd say yes, sir. That would
[1:33:20] be the inclination because I'm not used
[1:33:22] to hanging around angels like that.
[1:33:25] But that prophet knew, you take it back
[1:33:27] to the word and were a word bride. And
[1:33:29] believe it or not, I believe I do that
[1:33:30] today
[1:33:33] because there's lying spirits
[1:33:34] everywhere. and they come as angels of
[1:33:37] light and it'll deceive the very elected
[1:33:40] if it were possible. But it's not
[1:33:41] because she has the word. She's got an
[1:33:44] open book. Amen.
[1:33:46] Church,
[1:33:48] we have to know where we stand tonight.
[1:33:51] We've got to know why we walk the way we
[1:33:52] walk, why we talk the way we talk, why
[1:33:54] we do the things we do, why we don't do
[1:33:56] the things we do, why we go where we go,
[1:33:58] why we don't go where we don't go.
[1:34:01] We need to know why we do it by the
[1:34:03] word. Not just because we're in a sphere
[1:34:05] of influence around like-minded
[1:34:07] believers. We need to have like minds,
[1:34:09] but it's got to be the mind of Christ.
[1:34:11] It's got to be the mind of Christ. And
[1:34:12] the mind of Christ only seeks out the
[1:34:14] will of God. And when it finds it, then
[1:34:16] it does it. That's another service all
[1:34:18] in itself. Amen. But we've got to know
[1:34:20] when we're led by the word, when we're
[1:34:22] led by God, and we only know that by the
[1:34:24] word itself. You got a decision to make,
[1:34:26] take it back to the word. Find what the
[1:34:29] word says about it. Amen. If that
[1:34:31] leading takes us away from his church,
[1:34:33] from his fellowship, from a from from
[1:34:36] services, from being with the body, it
[1:34:40] can't be his leading. Can't be. It can't
[1:34:43] be. It
[1:34:45] drawn us all back to himself. Separation
[1:34:47] is the devil's work, not God's work.
[1:34:49] When it comes to the local body of
[1:34:51] believers, he says, "But Zedekiah, the
[1:34:53] son of Chena, went near and smoke in the
[1:34:55] cheek and said, which way went the
[1:34:57] spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto
[1:34:59] thee?
[1:35:01] Church, catch this now. The Holy
[1:35:04] Spirit's told the truth. And they have
[1:35:06] an opportunity. Church, repent and
[1:35:09] humble yourself.
[1:35:11] Back up.
[1:35:13] I missed it. I'm sorry. Dish on me. But
[1:35:18] what did he do, church? He doubled down.
[1:35:20] He said, "Where'd the spirit of God go
[1:35:22] when I when it was on me?"
[1:35:25] He says, "Cuz it didn't speak the same
[1:35:27] thing you did." What was that, church?
[1:35:29] Why did why did Zedekiah do it? Pride.
[1:35:33] Pride rose up. He could not humble
[1:35:35] himself. He had given himself over
[1:35:36] completely to that lying spirit.
[1:35:41] Pride will try and salvage our
[1:35:43] reputation every single time. But we've
[1:35:45] got to lay it down and say, "I was
[1:35:47] wrong. I missed it, church. I've missed
[1:35:50] many things in my life, and I didn't get
[1:35:52] anywhere until I admitted I missed it."
[1:35:54] And go back to where I missed it, and
[1:35:57] then get back on the right track. And
[1:35:59] Micah said, "Behold, thou shalt see in
[1:36:01] that day when thou shalt go into an
[1:36:02] inner chamber to hide thyelves." When
[1:36:04] they've lost the battle, and you go in
[1:36:05] and hide, you'll find out. You'll
[1:36:07] realize now that I have told the truth.
[1:36:09] Says, "And the king of Israel said, take
[1:36:11] Micah, carry him back into Ammon, the
[1:36:13] governor of the city, and to Joash the
[1:36:15] king's son, and say, thus sayeth the
[1:36:17] king, put this fellow in the prison, and
[1:36:19] feed him with the bread of affliction
[1:36:20] and with water of affliction until I
[1:36:22] come in peace." And Micah said, "If thou
[1:36:24] return at all in peace, the Lord hath
[1:36:27] not spoken by me." And he said,
[1:36:28] "Hearken, O people, every one of you."
[1:36:32] Church, you know what's the saddest
[1:36:34] thing here?
[1:36:36] Jehoshaphat said, "Is there yet a
[1:36:38] prophet of the Lord?
[1:36:40] God sends a prophet of the Lord that
[1:36:43] gives him thus saith the Lord." And you
[1:36:47] know what he did? He ignored it. He
[1:36:50] ignored it. Because why? God will always
[1:36:53] give a witness, but we've got to choose
[1:36:55] whether or not we listen to it. Amen.
[1:36:58] God had put a check and balance right in
[1:37:00] his heart. Why? Because he's a son of
[1:37:02] God. But church, there are choices we
[1:37:05] have to make. And he made a conscious
[1:37:08] choice. I'm going to go with Ahab.
[1:37:11] Now, scripture doesn't tell us why. If I
[1:37:13] was to say, I'd say what I said at the
[1:37:15] beginning. He obligated himself and he
[1:37:18] saw a word promise and he put the two
[1:37:20] together and he said, "Listen, I've
[1:37:21] given his word and the word says that
[1:37:23] that belongs to us anyways. Let's go get
[1:37:25] it."
[1:37:26] But you know what happens as soon as
[1:37:27] this goes on? They get ready for battle.
[1:37:30] You know what Ahab says? Ahab says,
[1:37:32] "Hey, Jehoshaphat buddy, I'm not going
[1:37:35] to dress like a king. I'm not going to
[1:37:38] go in my kingly armor. I'm just going to
[1:37:40] go as a regular soldier, but you you go
[1:37:43] in as a king. You be the face of my
[1:37:47] battle."
[1:37:50] You know what's scary? The child of God
[1:37:52] doesn't believe the prophet. And Ahab is
[1:37:55] just a little bit scared inside that
[1:37:56] that prophet might be right. So what's
[1:37:58] he going to do? He's going to duck
[1:38:01] out of the way, not make himself the
[1:38:03] face of it. He's going to throw
[1:38:04] Jehoshaphat under the bus, put all the
[1:38:07] pressure on Jehoshaphat, and then when
[1:38:08] it all works out, he'll take the glory.
[1:38:11] Isn't that the way it usually works out?
[1:38:14] You know the reason why people try and
[1:38:15] suck us into their schemes? Because they
[1:38:17] know your face on it is better than
[1:38:18] theirs.
[1:38:20] That's usually the truth. Because if
[1:38:22] they could do it themselves, they would.
[1:38:24] But they need somebody else beside it.
[1:38:26] And usually it's your reputation that's
[1:38:27] on the line because theirs has already
[1:38:28] been messed up. Be careful. I don't know
[1:38:32] why I'm preaching this tonight, church.
[1:38:33] I'll be honest. Be careful. Be careful
[1:38:35] what you attach yourself to. It's your
[1:38:38] reputation on the line, not theirs.
[1:38:41] In the end, though, Ahab died. In the
[1:38:44] way the scripture puts it says a random
[1:38:46] man took a random shot into the battle
[1:38:50] and that random arrow found the perfect
[1:38:52] spot in Ahab's armor where it linked up
[1:38:55] and it killed him. Why? Because the word
[1:38:57] of God's got to be satisfied,
[1:39:00] church. And we can hide from it all we
[1:39:02] want, but random things will randomly
[1:39:05] correct the situation. And the word of
[1:39:06] God's going to be true in the end.
[1:39:09] Jehoshaphat lost good men that day
[1:39:12] because he got sucked into an
[1:39:13] echochamber gospel. He got under the
[1:39:16] influence of a supposed brother and he
[1:39:18] let himself be led around by the nose
[1:39:20] and they lost good men that day. He was
[1:39:23] a good man. You look at Jehoshaphat,
[1:39:25] he's on the he's on the roles as one of
[1:39:26] the good ones. But even in his
[1:39:29] sincerity, even in his goodness, he fell
[1:39:31] subject to this influence. He was still
[1:39:34] susceptible to being influenced. You
[1:39:37] know, I've done that.
[1:39:39] I've taken what a brother has said, a
[1:39:42] minister, men of great influence, men
[1:39:44] that I really trust, and I've taken what
[1:39:46] they've said and even partially preached
[1:39:47] it over this pulpit. And God had to take
[1:39:50] me back and correct me by his word. And
[1:39:52] I had to admit I preached it wrong.
[1:39:55] You've heard me do that. Remember why?
[1:39:58] Because I took the man's word instead of
[1:40:00] God's word.
[1:40:03] We can all do it. We can all do it.
[1:40:05] Amen. He says, "But Micah knew where he
[1:40:08] was standing. He knew his God. And I
[1:40:10] know many will reject this that I'm
[1:40:12] saying now, but remember, I believe with
[1:40:13] all my heart, I know God." He says, "And
[1:40:16] I believe the age here that we're
[1:40:17] holding so much with this church and
[1:40:19] that church." He says, "And God's not
[1:40:22] pleased with it." We've got to come
[1:40:25] right out of that. We've got to get
[1:40:26] together, our hearts together. He says,
[1:40:28] "That's right." Can I speak it straight
[1:40:30] tonight? I've seen men back up men, not
[1:40:34] the word. I've seen men back up
[1:40:36] friendships, not the word. I've seen men
[1:40:39] back up churches, not the word. Why?
[1:40:43] Because they're bound to each other in
[1:40:46] that area of their life. And what does
[1:40:48] it do, church? It makes a mess and it
[1:40:52] undercuts their ministries. It undercuts
[1:40:54] their influence. It undercuts their
[1:40:56] testimony
[1:40:58] because what? If they'd have gone back
[1:41:00] and asked God what to do about it, he'd
[1:41:02] have told them what to do. And I believe
[1:41:04] more importantly, he'd have told them
[1:41:05] just to stay out of it.
[1:41:07] We're not here to fight each other's
[1:41:08] battles. We're not here to protect each
[1:41:10] other's reputations. Listen, God will
[1:41:12] make sure the truth comes out.
[1:41:14] But we can get so caught up into
[1:41:16] protecting each other, getting suckered
[1:41:18] into these things. Amen. Jehoshaphat got
[1:41:21] into it. He got involved in a fight that
[1:41:23] wasn't his. He got involved in a fight
[1:41:25] that couldn't be won. Cuz the only route
[1:41:27] to win that land back was for Ahab to
[1:41:29] repent. Jehoshaphat could go down there
[1:41:31] all day long and fight all day long. He
[1:41:33] was never going to get that land back
[1:41:34] because they had to come back the word
[1:41:36] way, which was get right with God. It
[1:41:39] wasn't his land. It wasn't his battle.
[1:41:41] Wasn't his loss. Everything was good in
[1:41:43] Judah. Why is he up there fighting a
[1:41:45] battle that doesn't belong to him? Why?
[1:41:47] Because somebody influenced them to come
[1:41:48] up and shake his hand. I'm just like
[1:41:50] you, brother. Let's go get it.
[1:41:53] He got caught up in the idea that
[1:41:54] everyone that says they're a believer is
[1:41:56] a believer. And everyone that is a child
[1:41:59] of God is always led by God. And we're
[1:42:01] not. We have to be so careful. We're
[1:42:04] starting to close.
[1:42:06] Paul would say this. He says, he's
[1:42:08] speaking of his of his his natural
[1:42:10] heritage. He says, "Who are Israelites?
[1:42:12] To whom pertainth the adoption, the
[1:42:13] glory, the covenants, and the giving of
[1:42:15] the law and the service of God and the
[1:42:17] promises whose are the fathers and of
[1:42:19] whom as concerning the flesh Christ
[1:42:21] came, who is over all God bless
[1:42:23] forever." He says the Israelites,
[1:42:24] they're the ones that are really part of
[1:42:25] the promise. Everything that's that's in
[1:42:27] the the the law of Moses, everything in
[1:42:29] the Old Testament, that is all for
[1:42:31] Israel. He says, "Not as though the word
[1:42:34] of God had taken no effect." He says,
[1:42:35] "For they are not all Israel which are
[1:42:38] of Israel." He says, "Neither because th
[1:42:40] they are the seed of Abraham are they
[1:42:42] all children." He says, "But in Isaac
[1:42:45] shall thy seed be called." Remember
[1:42:46] after Sarah died, Abraham had six more
[1:42:49] children, six more sons by Coutura. And
[1:42:52] you know what he did? He gave them a
[1:42:54] small inheritance and even pushed them
[1:42:56] on. Said, "You're on your own." Why?
[1:42:58] Because there's only one child of
[1:42:59] promise. There was only one that was
[1:43:00] going to serve God and that was Isaac.
[1:43:03] There was only one called. And that's
[1:43:04] what that's what Paul's saying here is
[1:43:06] not all that say I'm a I'm a believer
[1:43:09] are believers. Not all that say Lord
[1:43:11] Lord. Not all that go to church. Not all
[1:43:13] that believe in William Brandham. No.
[1:43:16] It's those that have received the spirit
[1:43:17] of God. That's the real believers. And
[1:43:19] it's that simple.
[1:43:21] Amen.
[1:43:24] Like I said, I'm not sure why I'm
[1:43:25] preaching it this way and I'm just
[1:43:28] trusting it's the Lord's leading. It's
[1:43:30] in my heart to do it. Amen. But what I
[1:43:32] want to say is don't presume on the will
[1:43:34] of God. Pray about it. Wait about it.
[1:43:38] Pray about it. Wait about it. Pray about
[1:43:40] it. Wait about it. And when he gives you
[1:43:44] an answer, confirm it with the word. And
[1:43:47] when you've got a word answer, now
[1:43:48] you've got confidence. If you got
[1:43:50] confidence by the word, you'll have
[1:43:51] faith that it's the right thing to do.
[1:43:53] Then your heart won't fail you. Listen
[1:43:55] to this. He says, "What man calls great,
[1:43:58] God calls foolish. And what man calls
[1:44:00] foolish, God calls great. He says, "So
[1:44:02] what we've got to do is get back into
[1:44:05] the program of God and find out after
[1:44:07] all what God wants us to do." He says,
[1:44:10] "And the only way I know to do it is
[1:44:12] prayer." Prayer is the key. That's the
[1:44:15] answer. Prayer changes everything.
[1:44:20] We're each one sovereign to God. He's
[1:44:22] the head. We're the body. We're not here
[1:44:24] to conform each other. We're not here to
[1:44:26] force you to do what I do because it
[1:44:27] worked for me and it worked for my
[1:44:28] family and it worked for this and that
[1:44:30] and the other thing. Church, we can
[1:44:31] share our experiences all day long and
[1:44:33] it's good advice, but we've got to take
[1:44:35] it back and say, "Lord, what's your will
[1:44:36] for me? What's your will for my
[1:44:38] marriage? What's your will for my
[1:44:39] family?" We're here to be led by the
[1:44:41] spirit of God. If we're led by the
[1:44:44] spirit of God, we can have faith to step
[1:44:45] into the will of God. And if we have
[1:44:47] faith in the will of in the working of
[1:44:49] God, we'll get the results of the word
[1:44:51] of God. Amen. led by him, faith of him,
[1:44:55] results of him. That's the way it's
[1:44:57] going to work out. And if the results
[1:44:59] don't match the word, church, you know
[1:45:01] what we have to say?
[1:45:04] It wasn't God leading.
[1:45:06] It isn't God leading. If the results
[1:45:08] don't match the word, and it was
[1:45:09] supposedly the word leading us, then
[1:45:10] something's wrong somewhere. And the
[1:45:12] word's not the problem. We've been led
[1:45:14] astray. He says, "Faith is designed to
[1:45:17] do this. A faith of the church should
[1:45:19] see the same program of God. He says, I
[1:45:23] want you to not miss this. Now, the
[1:45:24] church today that's called of God will
[1:45:27] certainly see the program of God because
[1:45:29] the program of God is written out here.
[1:45:32] He says it's the blueprint and the Holy
[1:45:34] Spirit by faith is the one who reads it
[1:45:38] and sets it together. Amen. God bless
[1:45:42] you. Let's stand together if you would.
[1:45:46] You know there's a big difference
[1:45:47] between saying I'm going and God is with
[1:45:50] me and God saying go and I'll be with
[1:45:53] you.
[1:45:55] You know our purpose is to find the plan
[1:45:57] of God. And when we find it we have
[1:46:01] faith to get into it and that's what
[1:46:03] brings the results. Amen. It's not to
[1:46:04] get consensus. This is not group think.
[1:46:08] This is not my way or the highway. This
[1:46:11] is sovereignty of the leading of the
[1:46:13] spirit in our individual lives to get
[1:46:16] word results. Take it simply. Do we
[1:46:19] raise our kids all the exact same way? I
[1:46:21] don't know about yours, but we don't do
[1:46:22] all of ours the same way. Some of ours
[1:46:24] you can just look at them and they'll
[1:46:25] behave. Others you can beat them till
[1:46:27] they turn blue and they won't behave.
[1:46:29] So, you got to use different methods,
[1:46:31] different ways, different times,
[1:46:33] different tones, different spoons, ones
[1:46:37] that don't break. Sister Brenda,
[1:46:41] I'm speaking from experience.
[1:46:45] That's right.
[1:46:49] God works with us sovereignly. Amen. And
[1:46:53] guess what? His plan for me is not his
[1:46:55] plan for you. The end results the same.
[1:46:58] I trust by God's grace we're all going
[1:47:00] in a rapture together. But he's going to
[1:47:03] get you there a little different than he
[1:47:04] gets me there.
[1:47:06] Why? because I'm a little more stubborn
[1:47:07] than you probably. He's going to have to
[1:47:10] work on me a little bit harder. But
[1:47:11] we're going to get there by faith. But
[1:47:13] you've got to find his will for your
[1:47:14] life and it's got to match up to what
[1:47:16] his word says. That's the only way we
[1:47:18] can do it. You know, can I share an
[1:47:20] example? I was praying about a situation
[1:47:21] recently. It was very uncomfortable for
[1:47:24] me. And and it was it was a situation
[1:47:26] where I could allow something to slide.
[1:47:28] I could in a way forgive or forget or I
[1:47:31] could require the person to do something
[1:47:34] about it. and and this person was a
[1:47:36] believer. Okay? And and I was just stuck
[1:47:38] in it because sometimes we're so stuck
[1:47:40] on being gracious,
[1:47:42] right? You ever deal with that where you
[1:47:44] just want to be kind? But you know what?
[1:47:47] There's a burden to being kind and it's
[1:47:48] not always meant for us to take. But I
[1:47:50] was sitting there and about a day, day
[1:47:52] and a half, I was just trying to wrestle
[1:47:54] with it and and I didn't know what to do
[1:47:55] and I could go one way or the other. And
[1:47:57] they were both, you know, they both had
[1:47:59] their their pros and cons. Okay? pros
[1:48:02] and cons list won't get us into the will
[1:48:03] of God, church. I speak by experience.
[1:48:07] And so I finally remembered, oh yeah,
[1:48:09] I've got a God that can give me
[1:48:10] direction. And I said, Lord, what would
[1:48:12] you have me to do in this situation? And
[1:48:15] I mean, literally in that moment, a
[1:48:16] scripture came to me. And this was a
[1:48:18] very random scripture. And it was
[1:48:21] exactly relevant to the situation I'm
[1:48:24] in. I'm not saying I had to make a leap
[1:48:26] of revelation to understand what he was
[1:48:28] talking about. It specifically said if
[1:48:30] this happens, this is what you do.
[1:48:32] That's what the scripture said. So, you
[1:48:35] know what I said? Praise the Lord. No, I
[1:48:37] didn't. You know what I did? Because
[1:48:39] what he was telling me to do was go to
[1:48:41] that person and say, I need you to make
[1:48:43] this right. And that was uncomfortable
[1:48:46] for me because sometimes it's easier to
[1:48:48] be gracious.
[1:48:50] But he said, "No, part of being a
[1:48:52] Christian and being around Christians is
[1:48:55] that you let them behave the way
[1:48:56] Christians are supposed to behave. And
[1:48:58] so I went to this person. I said,
[1:49:00] "Listen, this is what I this is what I
[1:49:02] I'm going to do about this situation."
[1:49:04] You know what they said? That's fine.
[1:49:06] I'll take care of it. And that was it.
[1:49:08] They did exactly what a Christian's
[1:49:10] supposed to do cuz I held them
[1:49:12] accountable to the word. Now, I didn't
[1:49:13] tell them why I was doing it, but the
[1:49:15] Lord had given me a very specific
[1:49:16] scripture. So, I just went and I said,
[1:49:19] "This is what I would like to do about
[1:49:20] this." And they said, "Perfect. Let's do
[1:49:22] that." And you know what that did? That
[1:49:25] just confirmed in my heart, that's a
[1:49:27] real brother. That's a real sister.
[1:49:30] Because sometimes the proof is that we
[1:49:31] that we're Christians is we are actually
[1:49:33] held accountable to being a Christian.
[1:49:35] And all it was it was I just said,
[1:49:37] "Lord, thank you for that. Thank you for
[1:49:39] giving me a word answer to a real life
[1:49:42] problem today that I wasn't sure about
[1:49:45] what to do." And when I did it, it
[1:49:46] worked out perfectly because why? That's
[1:49:49] how God works things out perfectly for
[1:49:52] our good because we stick according to
[1:49:55] his word. I only wish I'd had gone to
[1:49:57] him straight away instead of spending a
[1:49:58] day and a half wondering which way to
[1:50:00] go. And my wife was saying, "No, you
[1:50:02] need to do this. You need" And in the
[1:50:04] end, she was right. But I had a word
[1:50:06] answer to confirm why she was right.
[1:50:08] That's the kind of God we're serving. If
[1:50:11] you go to him with a need, you go to him
[1:50:13] with a question, he'll give you your
[1:50:15] answer. Amen.
[1:50:17] But you got to take the time, pray,
[1:50:20] wait. And I was so thankful. I was so
[1:50:23] thankful. He gave me the exact exact
[1:50:26] scripture and there's only one in the
[1:50:27] Bible that'll do it. And I happen to
[1:50:29] know it and he brought it to my
[1:50:30] remembrance. I said, "That's perfect.
[1:50:32] That's exactly what I'm going to do."
[1:50:34] And it worked out just fine. That's the
[1:50:36] way his word works. If you'll stick with
[1:50:38] it until he shows it to you, he'll work
[1:50:40] it out for your his glory and for your
[1:50:43] good. Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our
[1:50:45] heads together, Lord Jesus.
[1:50:48] Lord, certainly hard again tonight in
[1:50:50] many ways, Lord, but it's a reminder,
[1:50:52] Lord, to stay close to you, Lord, that
[1:50:55] as much as we love each other, Lord, as
[1:50:57] we love our brothers and sisters,
[1:50:58] professing believers, Lord, our
[1:51:00] closeness has to be filtered through the
[1:51:03] word of God and the leadership of the
[1:51:05] Holy Spirit. So Lord, I pray you take
[1:51:07] what's been said tonight, Lord, that you
[1:51:10] just anchor it down in our hearts as we
[1:51:12] may face situations, Lord. Maybe we're
[1:51:13] in them right now, Lord, that require us
[1:51:16] to to be a certain way or do a certain
[1:51:18] thing, Lord, no matter how hard it might
[1:51:20] be, Lord, how misunderstood we might be,
[1:51:22] how uncomfortable we might be, Lord, I
[1:51:25] pray you give us grace to find a word
[1:51:26] answer to our daily daily problems,
[1:51:29] Lord. grace to us, Lord, that we can
[1:51:32] surrender, submit, Lord, humble
[1:51:35] ourselves to your spirit by your word.
[1:51:38] Lord, we want word results, Lord. I
[1:51:40] don't want my results, Lord, but I want
[1:51:42] your results in my life. And Lord, I
[1:51:45] know these people do as well. So, we're
[1:51:46] praying that you'd just keep us
[1:51:48] sensitive to you, Lord. That you would
[1:51:49] lead us and guide us in your will and
[1:51:51] your way, Lord. And that as we seek it,
[1:51:54] Lord, your scripture says if we knock,
[1:51:56] Lord, it'll be opened unto us. Seek and
[1:51:57] we will find. Lord, that's your promise
[1:52:00] and we're holding you to it this
[1:52:01] evening. Lord, bless us now. Be with
[1:52:03] those that weren't here, Lord. Those
[1:52:05] that have many different needs, Lord, we
[1:52:07] pray your grace and mercy upon them. In
[1:52:09] Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[1:52:14] Teach me, Lord, to wait. 206
[1:52:22] Teach me Lord
[1:52:25] to wait
[1:52:28] down on
[1:52:31] my knees
[1:52:34] till in your own
[1:52:37] good time
[1:52:41] you answer
[1:52:44] my plea. Peace.
[1:52:47] Teach me not
[1:52:50] to rely
[1:52:53] on what others
[1:52:57] do,
[1:52:59] but to wait
[1:53:02] in prayer for
[1:53:05] an answer
[1:53:07] from you.
[1:53:10] And they that wait
[1:53:13] upon the Lord
[1:53:16] shall renew
[1:53:19] their strength.
[1:53:22] They shall mount up
[1:53:26] with wings
[1:53:28] as he goes.
[1:53:34] And they shall run
[1:53:37] and not be weary.
[1:53:40] They shall walk
[1:53:43] and not faint.
[1:53:46] Teach me Lord.
[1:53:49] Teach me Lord
[1:53:52] to wait.
[1:53:58] So teach me Lord
[1:54:01] to wait.
[1:54:04] while hearts
[1:54:07] are a flame.
[1:54:10] And help me hle
[1:54:13] my pride
[1:54:16] and call on your name.
[1:54:21] And keep my faith
[1:54:25] renewed
[1:54:27] and keep my eyes
[1:54:30] on thee. Help
[1:54:34] me be on
[1:54:37] this earth what you want me to be.
[1:54:44] And they that wait
[1:54:47] upon the Lord
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; shall renew
[1:55:00] with wings
[1:55:03] as he goes.
[1:55:08] And they shall run
[1:55:10] and not be weary.
[1:55:14] They shall walk
[1:55:16] and not faint.
[1:55:20] Teach me Lord.
[1:55:23] Teach me Lord
[1:55:26] to wait.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Lead me Lord. I will follow. 792.
[1:55:35] Do we know the uh verses for this or
[1:55:38] just the chorus? Sorry. When they pull
[1:55:39] it up 792,
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; we don't know this, I don't think. Okay,
[1:55:45] we'll just sing the We'll sing the
[1:55:47] chorus. That'll be wonderful. Amen. The
[1:55:49] chorus.
[1:55:51] Lead me, Lord. Lead me, Lord.
[1:55:56] I
[1:55:58] will follow.
[1:56:02] And lead me, Lord.
[1:56:05] I
[1:56:07] will go
[1:56:10] and you have called me
[1:56:15] and I will answer.
[1:56:19] Lead me Lord,
[1:56:22] I
[1:56:24] will go.
[1:56:26] And lead me Lord,
[1:56:31] I
[1:56:33] will follow.
[1:56:37] Lead me Lord,
[1:56:40] I
[1:56:42] will go.
[1:56:45] You have called me
[1:56:49] and I will answer.
[1:56:54] Lead me Lord
[1:56:57] I
[1:56:59] will go
[1:57:01] and lead me Lord

[1:59:11] more
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; with the touch of your hand.
[1:59:18] Stronger each day.

[1:59:32] [Music]
[1:59:34] I stand in awe within the presence of
[1:59:40] the Lord.
[1:59:43] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[1:59:49] lie.
[1:59:51] For whom the raging of the sea
[1:59:57] subides,
[1:59:58] [Music]
[2:00:00] the living sacrifice,
[2:00:04] the only source
[2:00:08] of life,
[2:00:10] my hope.
[2:00:13] is in the Lord
[2:00:17] from this time on
[2:00:22] and ever more.
[2:00:25] Oh
[2:00:27] my hope
[2:00:30] is in the Lord
[2:00:35] forever more.
[2:00:39] His tender mercies come with every
[2:00:44] rising sun
[2:00:47] to meet the sinner in his brokenness
[2:00:56] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[2:01:04] And those who trust in him
[2:01:08] will find their hearts
[2:01:12] at rest.
[2:01:14] My hope
[2:01:17] is in the Lord.
[2:01:21] From this time on
[2:01:26] and ever more.
[2:01:30] Oh, my hope
[2:01:34] is in the Lord
[2:01:38] forever more.
[2:01:43] His tender mercies come with every
[2:01:47] rising sun
[2:01:51] to meet the sinner in his brokenness.
[2:01:59] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[2:02:08] And those who trust in him
[2:02:12] will find their hearts
[2:02:16] at rest
[2:02:21] is in the Lord
[2:02:25] from this time on.
[2:02:29] and ever more.
[2:02:33] Oh,
[2:02:34] my hope
[2:02:38] is in the Lord
[2:02:42] forever more.
[2:02:47] My hope
[2:02:50] is in the Lord
[2:02:54] from this time on.
[2:02:59] and ever more.
[2:03:02] Oh
[2:03:04] my hope
[2:03:07] is in the Lord
[2:03:12] forever more.
[2:03:16] Amen. He won't lead us astray.
[2:03:19] Amen. We're going to sing that song. You
[2:03:21] know that song, In Your Presence, I want
[2:03:23] to go. It's 10:57. We're going to sing
[2:03:26] that as we close tonight.
[2:03:28] Brother Bob, I'm going to ask you to
[2:03:29] close in prayer. That would be okay.
[2:03:32] Amen. Remember the needs that have been
[2:03:33] mentioned. Brother Bob, Sister Joe did
[2:03:35] get home safely a little bit late, but I
[2:03:37] just wanted to thank the church for
[2:03:39] those that helped out with hosting and
[2:03:42] potato soup and and taking them out and
[2:03:44] inviting yourself over so that you could
[2:03:46] entertain them and you know, these
[2:03:48] different things. But in all
[2:03:50] seriousness, I appreciate the
[2:03:51] hospitality they were shown. It was
[2:03:53] quite a long trip and with different
[2:03:55] ones we have people volunteering to take
[2:03:56] them out and travel with them and eat
[2:03:58] with them and those different things and
[2:04:00] allowed us a bit of time to just kind of
[2:04:02] settle back a bit and clean up and and
[2:04:05] uh you know eat craft dinner
[2:04:08] those different things. So I appreciate
[2:04:10] it and my wife appreciates it and it's a
[2:04:13] it's a wonderful testimony. You know
[2:04:14] everyone when they come here they say
[2:04:16] it's a wonderful group of believers.
[2:04:18] It's a wonderful church and that's
[2:04:19] because of you. It's not because of me.
[2:04:22] And uh it's a wonderful testimony that
[2:04:24] when people go, they feel like they were
[2:04:25] home, like they were treated as as
[2:04:27] family and as friends. And so God bless
[2:04:30] you each one for that. Amen. We're going
[2:04:32] to sing this and brother Bob will close
[2:04:34] in prayer.
[2:04:38] And I want to go where the rivers cannot
[2:04:44] overflow me and where my feet are on the
[2:04:50] rock.
[2:04:54] And I want to hide where the cares of
[2:05:00] this world cannot choke me. It's in your
[2:05:05] presence, oh God.
[2:05:09] And in your presence,
[2:05:15] that's where I am strong. In your
[2:05:19] presence,
[2:05:22] oh Lord my God, in your presence,
[2:05:31] that's where I belong.
[2:05:35] seeking your face,
[2:05:39] touching your grace
[2:05:44] in the cliff of the rock.
[2:05:52] It's in your presence, oh God.
[2:05:59] And I want to hide where the flood of
[2:06:04] evil cannot reach me and where I'm
[2:06:09] covered by the blood.
[2:06:15] I want to be where the schemes of
[2:06:20] darkness cannot touch me.
[2:06:24] In your presence, oh God.
[2:06:30] In your presence,
[2:06:35] that's where I am strong.
[2:06:39] In your presence,
[2:06:43] oh Lord my God, in your presence,
[2:06:52] that's where I belong.
[2:06:56] seeking your face,
[2:07:00] touching your grace
[2:07:05] in the cliff of the rock,
[2:07:13] in your presence, oh God.
[2:07:17] [Music]
[2:07:19] Oh, I want to hide where the flood of
[2:07:25] evil cannot reach me.
[2:07:29] Where I'm covered by the blood.
[2:07:36] I want to be where the schemes of
[2:07:41] darkness cannot touch me.
[2:07:45] In your presence, oh God.
[2:07:51] In your presence,
[2:07:56] that's where I am strong. In your
[2:08:00] presence,
[2:08:04] oh Lord my God, in your presence,
[2:08:12] that's where I belong.
[2:08:16] seeking your face,
[2:08:20] touching your grace
[2:08:25] in the cliff of the rock.
[2:08:33] It's in your presence, oh God,
[2:08:39] and in your presence.
[2:08:44] That's where I am strong. In your
[2:08:48] presence,
[2:08:52] oh Lord my God, in your presence,
[2:09:00] that's where I belong.
[2:09:03] [Music]
[2:09:05] Your face
[2:09:08] touching your grace
[2:09:13] in the cl of the rock.
[2:09:20] It's in your presence, oh God,
[2:09:26] and in your presence.
[2:09:32] That's where I am strong. In your
[2:09:37] presence,
[2:09:41] oh Lord my God, in your presence,
[2:09:50] that's where I belong.
[2:09:55] seeking your face.
[2:09:59] Touching your grace
[2:10:04] in the cliff of the rock.
[2:10:12] In your presence, oh God.
[2:10:28] Hallelujah. Heavenly Father,
[2:10:30] Lord, it's the truth. It's our desire
[2:10:34] that that's where we belong, Lord, in
[2:10:36] your presence. And we've heard tonight,
[2:10:38] Lord, about the influences that the
[2:10:40] devil might try and throw at us, Father,
[2:10:43] because he goes around seeking, Lord, to
[2:10:46] devour us. But father, the truth is that
[2:10:50] the more time we spend with you, the
[2:10:53] tougher it is for the devil to get at
[2:10:54] us.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; And Lord, just like your servant Job, he
[2:10:58] was behind a hedge, Lord, that you had
[2:11:00] placed around him. And the devil had to
[2:11:03] get God to drop the hedge in order for
[2:11:06] him to test him. And so, Lord, we just
[2:11:09] want to thank you, Father, for that
[2:11:11] hedge, Lord, that you provided for each
[2:11:13] and every one of us. Lord, that we can
[2:11:16] just hide in the cliff of the rock,
[2:11:18] Lord, with you. And that's where our
[2:11:20] strength is. That's where, Lord, we
[2:11:22] belong. So we just pray, Father, that
[2:11:24] you'd help us as we go back out into
[2:11:27] this world, Lord, that's so evil and so
[2:11:29] full of sin, Father, with the influences
[2:11:32] that are so strong. But help us, Father,
[2:11:34] by grace to be influenced only by the
[2:11:36] Holy Spirit. That Lord, you would lift
[2:11:38] us up, Father, into your presence
[2:11:40] always. That you would guide us and
[2:11:42] strengthen us, Father. and that from the
[2:11:44] crown of our heads to the soles of our
[2:11:46] feet, Lord, we would have the armor of
[2:11:48] God upon us, Lord, that we might turn
[2:11:50] aside those fiery darts of the enemy. So
[2:11:54] Lord, as we go tonight, Lord, we humbly
[2:11:56] ask, Lord, your presence to be with us,
[2:11:58] that you would bless Brother John, Lord,
[2:11:59] and give him, Father, rest, Lord, body,
[2:12:02] soul, and spirit. And that, Father, you
[2:12:05] would just speak to his heart that he
[2:12:06] might bring more of that word, Lord,
[2:12:08] which will give us, Father, that faith
[2:12:10] that we have need of. So Lord, we pray
[2:12:12] Lord for those that weren't here
[2:12:14] tonight. May your presence be with them,
[2:12:16] Lord. You know that there are many
[2:12:17] needs, Lord, in the body. And we're just
[2:12:19] praying, Father, that you would minister
[2:12:21] to each and every one, Father. Because
[2:12:23] Lord, we know, Lord, there's nothing too
[2:12:25] hard from you, from you. So we ask,
[2:12:27] Lord, your grace, Lord, to minister to
[2:12:29] us all. Touch us, Father, by grace. And
[2:12:32] maybe, Lord, before the next service,
[2:12:35] Lord, you will have taken us home.
[2:12:37] Father, for that's the desire of all of
[2:12:39] us, Lord, bring the rapture. we pray.
[2:12:42] And help us, Father, in the meantime to
[2:12:43] love you and to serve you with all of
[2:12:45] our hearts until you take us home in
[2:12:47] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
