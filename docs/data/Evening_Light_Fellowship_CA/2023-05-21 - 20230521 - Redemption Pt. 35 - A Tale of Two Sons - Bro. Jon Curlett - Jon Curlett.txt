Psalms 119 then welcome brother Kingsley back from his long trip overseas and Men welcome our sister our visitor as well amen God bless you trusting you'll feel welcome this morning amen Psalms 119 is beautiful nice to have a beautiful sunny day even with the wind I'll take the Sun hey man it's a nice break from what we've had through the winter and the spring amen Psalms 119 glad to have Selena still with us after her her Airborne episode last night in her car but just trusting God's grace to help us sort that out certainly through the coming days as well but amen he guards us he protects us amen and if there's one thing we know that whatever happens to us he's got his hands in it amen when even when it's a car wreck even when it's sickness even when it's pain even when it's distressed these different things he's in it all amen he's he's the master planner and he knows exactly what to do to get us to the place he wants us amen amen Psalms 119 verse 9 says wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed there too according to Thy Word with my whole heart have I sought thee oh let me not Wander from thy Commandments Thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against thee blessed art thou O Lord teach me thy statutes amen you can have your seats this morning God bless you tomorrow I'm going to take my jacket off right away as we get into this and we're continuing the series on Redemption that we've been speaking on and and I wanted to take a title this morning of a tale of two sons and that maybe sounds a bit odd given how far we are into this series but I was speaking to some brothers after the last service and we had that wonderful service on the chastening and trying of God that Chad and Leah and their family were blessed to miss you know one of those uplifting sermons where we're talking about the hard the hardness that comes with the love of God and the teaching of God and the progression of God in our lives and I said well Brothers now we're going to have an uplifting service on Rebellion next and so this is that service but we're not going to speak on Rebellion perhaps in the way that you think and this is not a you know a pushing down sermon or what are you doing or what are you not doing or whatnot but we want to show you where the root of it is amen and how you get it out of your life and and how it's kind of progressed through through the scriptures and these different things so we want to take it from both sides we want to take it not from just a place of Disobedience but a place of obedience amen and if we want to not show you just what the wrong is but what the right is and how you can get from what one of those sides of to the others and the last service we spoke how God corrects his children and so often we take correction as the spanking but the correction is the showing the right way and you don't get disciplined until you're corrected first until God shows us what is right he does not discipline us for what we do not know God doesn't discipline us for our ignorance but what he disciplines us for is when we reject what he has showed us is right and then the discipline comes behind and it enforces the correction it enforces the right way in our life but we know that even regardless there's going to be tests in our life and even if you say yes Lord I accept your word I believe it it's true now the test comes and you've got to take it and put it into action in your life and we said last time that tests are hard there is no easy test tests are supposed to be hard they're supposed to challenge us they're supposed to get us to dig deep to really see if we truly understand these things but we also want to know that there's a difference between the disciplining of God and the difficulty and the pain that comes with that and the testing of God which is also difficult and painful many times amen but each one of those has come going to come to God's children but we've got to learn that what we do is going to have an effect with how God responds to us as well amen that we have a choice of how this is going to go and we can go the easier way which is God's way easier does not mean easy it just means less difficult and we can go the hard way and Hosea would talk about this he says for they have sown the wind and they shall reap the Whirlwind it had no stock and the bud shall yield no meal and if so be it yield The Strangers will swallow it up and the Amplified it says for they sow the wind and they shall reap the Whirlwind the standing grain has no heads it will yield no meal and if it were to yield strangers and Aliens would eat it up so in other words when you get out of line you sow something that is out of God word that's out of the will of God then what you're going to get is never going to be in the will of God you can't sow outside the will of God and reap the will of God you've got to come back to that place and then step back into his will into his word and then he can bless you and he says listen you sow the wind you're going to reap a whirlwind in other words you sow something lightly it'll come back way worse than what you sowed because it magnifies and it builds itself up and that's what Satan does because Satan is a destroyer so when you sow destruction then he sows more he he gets you to reap even more than you ever anticipated you know we have that song sin will take you further than you ever meant to go That's what Satan is as you saw one bad decision you make one thing that doesn't line up with the word and he'll turn it into 10. because that's what he's there to do he's here to destroy you he's healed to kill you he's here to ruin your family he's here to ruin your life as much as he can so you'd make one bad decision and unless you can quickly come back then he'll magnify that and all of a sudden that one little thing magnifies itself into a massive problem and he says and if if by chance you get something good out of it something good he says you won't even get the blessing of it somebody else will get the blessing if there's any good that comes out of what your decision was that was outside the word of God somebody else is going to get it you won't even get a blessing out of it you've got to come back to where you left to me man you can't sow Disobedience you can't sow self-will and somehow come out of it looking good and you're not going to get anything good out of it it doesn't work that way amen but God is Not unjust I mean God is Not unfair and he has his ways of training us and it seems hard at times but there's a purpose behind it all I spoke earlier of the master planner and he knows how to get us into shape if you ever look at a construction site when they first start building and it looks like it's just a mess of stuff laying around and and they're doing the earth works and it's just water and dirt and piles everywhere that's what our life looks like sometime and it's hard to look at it and you say there's no order to it it doesn't seem to make sense there's nothing coming in but as the master planner progresses then it starts to take shape and you start to understand hey there's something coming out of all of this mess and if we'll just stick with what he says to do rather than trying to form it ourselves it'll produce the building it'll produce the Tabernacle that he was looking to get us into amen but as I said there's a simpler way obedience and there's the hard way and that's Disobedience or rebellion and we see that these things start right in Genesis and and we're not going to go back to Eve because that was certainly the first Disobedience but we're talking about a tale of two sons and we've been talking about the adoption of sons and bringing Sons and Daughters of God into the place where God can truly use them and and trust them in these things but we see that all of these things have Roots both obedience and disobedience in Genesis there's nothing new Under the Sun the scripture says what we're dealing with today the spirits in this world the attitudes the Tendencies the ways we think it's been there since Genesis there's nothing new they're just coming up with it again and thinking they've come up with something new but we go to Genesis 4 and it says and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground so Cain was a farmer and Abel was a shepherd and in the process of time it came to pass that came brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord this is a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing he has done something he's produced something he's tended the fields he's done all his hard work and then he says Lord I want to give you some of what I have nothing wrong with this Hebrews 11 says Cain's sacrifice was excellent to look at it from the outside you would say this is a beautiful perfect sacrifice then it says in Abel he also brought of the first liens of his flock and of the fat thereof so Abel brought what he had available Cain brought what he had produced Abel brought what he had tended and produced and and they were both on the outside looking like it was the same thing different things physically but they both brought of what they had and you think that ought to be enough I'm bringing what I have what more could God ask of me but I want to set a stage here because we spoke in the first service of uh you know we talked about uh preparing for position and we talk about actions and works by faith and then we went into the the trials and the testing and the chastening of God in the second service but now we're coming into Revelation and obedience because Revelation without obedience is not true revelation and obedience without Revelation won't hold you'll get so far and then you'll stop because you've got to have an understanding that God is behind what you're doing in the first place listen to this quote he says it Cain and Abel both came to find favor with God both of them had the exact same purpose in coming amen he says now look Cain was a long ways from being a communist neither was he an atheist but Cain was a Believer he says get on your shockproof vest now Cain was a Believer and a worshiper of God if God only required a Believer came was just as just as Abel was and God would be unjust if he condemned Cain for his faith in him and accepted Abel if Faith was all he required now this sounds like it's almost blasphemy but I read quote after quote to give what he meant in this and I went through and searched it out and what he's saying is that Cain came expecting God to be happy with what he did that was his faith he brought it in expectation that it would be accepted by God that was his faith his faith was not a revelation from God his faith was that this is going to be good enough that's why he brought it if he didn't think I was accepted can accept it he wouldn't have brought it amen but what we have to understand is that we can be sincerely wrong you can be completely sincere you can be doing something that you believe is for God and be flat wrong and it's the best you can do and it's all you've ever been able to do but that doesn't make it right it just makes you sincere and that's what we've got understanders he said Cain is coming in sincere faith believing that what he's doing is the right thing and he says God doesn't judge him for that because he's the same as Abel in that in that regard he says but what all right but Cain came and offered a sacrifice Cain built an altar a church Cain made a sacrifice just the same as Abel did and came worshiped he never came as an unbeliever he came as a Believer he raised up his hands and worshiped God just the same as Abel did he says well if a church membership an altar worship of sacrifices all God requires then Cain was just as just as Abel was if you belong to church and go to church you've got your name on the church book you're a good tide pair a worshiper and insincerity that still isn't it that's right he says I don't want to hurt you but I've got to stand before judgment with you god requires more than that God requires all of that plus so don't say well I don't need to do that no you have to do that that's that's the the just the the basic requirements of being a Believer but he says God requires more than that and Cain was just as just on it as Abel was if that's all God requires now I want you to notice Cain built his big fine Altar and I can imagine him being a tiller of the soil he filled it full of Easter flowers and everything and made it beautiful but he was the nature of Satan today we have Chimes on the churches and plush pews and everything else trying to find favor with God and that's not God's way of finding favor he says but Cain laid his sacrifice down he knelt down on his knees and he raised up his hands and I can hear his beautiful prayer just how he rhymed it out just so in order and everything trying to find favor with Jehovah here is the works that I have brought and laid down I've built this church I've done these things I've worked hard and here's a part of what I've got I lay here I offer to you Jehovah he says can I find favor he wasn't an Infidel he was a fundamentalist he was just as fundamental as the other fellow was and Abel came not nothing beautiful he had a little old lamb of the flock he didn't work up he didn't do something or other he didn't try and make fine big churches he didn't build this that and the other he just went out there and wrapped a grapevine around a lamb's neck and come pulling him picked him up and laid him on the Rock he says I don't guess they had a Lansing that day so they just took a sharp Rock and pulled his little head back and began to beat him in the throat with it he says what a sight the blood began to sprinkle and bathe his little wool over like that and the poor little thing dying and bleeding you've got this beautiful altar of everything that Cain could produce and then Abel comes and he's cutting the throat of a lamb you'd say why would God accept that but he says God looked down from heaven and rewarded him both of them brought of what they had both of them brought what they thought was acceptable but God only rewarded one of these things now watch here we continue in Genesis 4. he says in Abel he also brought to the first lens of his flocking of the fat thereof it says and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering Hebrews 11 says Abel's sacrifice was more excellent Keynes was excellent but Abel's was more excellent why what was the difference by Godly faith Abel brought a sacrifice Cain brought it with faith but it was his faith Abel brought it by a revelation of what was really going on in this situation and he says but what but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Roth and his countenance fell now looking at this carnally from the outside Cain has a right to be angry because Cain's looking at it from his side he's saying he brought what he could bring I brought what I could bring and God you're only recognizing his that's wrong that's not fair how could I have done any differently I don't have any sheep all I have is vegetables and fruit and these different things God I'm giving you the best I can give you why do you not accept it it says and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wrath why are you angry Cain he says and why is thy countenance Fallen why do you have a long face why are you mad why are you sad he says if thou doest well shall thou not be accepted if you do well Cain won't I accept you and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him he says there if thou doest well shall thou not be accepted church if that's not the grace of God I don't know what is because Cain is sitting here he is not a True Believer he's a make-believer he's a physical proof of the original sin he's brought the wrong sacrifice and now he's angry with a God that will come down and speak with him when you're in the presence of God I don't know about you but I don't have a whole lot of words to speak when he comes personally like that I'm not talking a general anointing but when he comes down in a room when he comes down in your devotions when he comes down to sarson it's like he's right there I don't have a whole lot of words to say and Cain is talking back to God in an angry tone that showed there was something wrong on the inside was that God himself the great Jehovah came down to talk to this man that had nothing in him good and God said if you do what can't what Abel does I'll accept you Cain that's how messed up he was amen God is gracious he gives everybody a chance everybody gets one opportunity to accept or reject what God has for them amen listen but I want you to realize after verse 4 happened and Cain Sees God come down and have respect to Abel's offering the scripture isn't doesn't say what it is but if you look through the rest of scripture probably what happened is God consumed it by fire it was an obvious acceptance and as soon as that happens what happens is Cain has the opportunity now to make his sacrifice right he has seen what is acceptable and he has seen what everything else that is not acceptable so Cain has a decision here he can say all right I know what's right I'm gonna go get a lamb from Abel I'm going to trade what I've got for what he's got and bring that and sacrifice it and then God will accept me God doesn't even have to come and talk to Cain he should have been able to see God is has honored that that's what I need to do but Cain had a decision to make and he chose to go a different way that was his decision now that I see the right way will I do the right way or will I complain about it how many times have we done things right in our own eyes with sincerity with good intentions believing that that's what God wants us to do and then we come and find out it wasn't either by the fruits or because we come to a revelation of the word of God how many times does it happen listen I've I've told this many times over the pope but I gave four years of my life supporting a man that was living a pastor that was living a life of hidden sin that absolutely should have kept him out of the pulpit four years I gave to that man and I did it in sincerity as unto God as unto God not as unto that man as unto God and I gave four years of that my life to that man and then you come to find out that it was all on his part Hashem he was a deceiver and that's on him that's his problem but I'm sitting there and I've given four years of my life and you say was it a waste no it wasn't a waste because I learned after that that every man and every woman no matter their position no matter their gift no matter their calling is subject to the word of God and so especially especially Us in the ministry we have to be held accountable to this especially us it's a higher standard than anyone else because we have to handle it and we have to give it from a pure heart and so we have to be held accountable to this but I learned after that I don't care what your gift is I don't care if you see dreams I don't care if you see visions and I know brothers that do I don't care if you've got a gift of healing a gift of faith a gift of Prophecy I do not care if you go off of the word of God I'm going to have a conversation with you about it and if you will not come back to it then we cannot hold that Fellowship the same way as in I cannot give you that position that you're looking for I cannot give you that Authority because the authority we're looking for is the word not the men and I learned that and since then church I've gone through trial and tests after people trying to influence me Time After Time After Time and I don't care anymore I learned that lesson up front and God knew I needed that lesson so that I would be able to handle what was coming my way so it's not wasted but once I realized what was going on the question is what could I do with it and what did I do with it and we'll talk about that a little bit later amen but watch this watch this he's talking about Cain and he says but man never gives the Inside Man a chance to explain what is right so we have our man we have our human nature but he says the Inside Man is what that's the nature of God it's supposed to be the nature of God he says and our problem is as we let the carnal side raise up and we don't let the spiritual side come and show us what's going on and what we're supposed to be doing in the situation he says watch we find if he doesn't do it then what happens or he says he says therefore that's what causes the trouble watch we find if he doesn't do it then what happens we find that's his temper like Cain got up see right quick he was jealous he didn't like God to accept Abel's sacrifice instead of his he wanted to go too that's not a bad thing he wanted to go too but he wanted his own sacrifice he wanted his own way he said I want the results I want the acceptance but I don't want to do it God's way see instead of coming over to Abel and saying oh my brother I'm so happy that God has accepted now we you figured it out but now we've got a way that we know that Jova Jehovah accepts this way because he's proved it by receiving your sacrifice wouldn't that have been the thing to do he says but instead of that he got jealous that was his that was his the the turning point for Cain was when he knew what God would accept and he said no I'm not interested in that that's why it's good to have the older folks amongst us one of the many reasons is because they can show us what God has accepted and they can also show us what God hasn't accepted listen if you sit down and talk with anybody that's over 50 or 60 years old especially they'll say don't do this don't do that and don't go here and don't go there and wait and do all these different things they give us wisdom because they've learned by doing the wrong way what God doesn't accept and they've learned by doing the right things what God does accept and you know what they'll do every time they'll point you back to here because this is where they found the right way it wasn't just in muddling around until they found it but God showed it to them in his word and that's that's what we go back to every single time but this modern tendency and it's not a modern tendency because it's here in Genesis the modern tendency is because I think it's right because I feel it's right because it makes sense to me it is right and it's not this is right scripture says I'm God and I change not I changed not I was talking to a I was I was trying to find a helping brother brother Grant trying to find a car and I went to the the dealership close by and I was talking to a guy and we got to talking about some different things and and um and he was saying you know he said I I don't I don't think that that I've got to go to church to get to heaven he says I think if I do good things I'll make it well if you do good things in God's will according to his word you'll make it because you'll do everything he said in his word but what he was saying is if I do good things that I want to do I'll get to heaven that's what Cain did Cain did good things in his own sight with good intentions in all sincerity and Cain was a child of Perdition just like Judas was just like Esau was good intentions sincerity but off the word of God that can't be the way you're going to get in you're never going to get to heaven off the word of God certainly not as a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ Proverbs 16 says this there is a way that seemeth right unto a man seems right there's no deceiver like the self-deceiver it says there's a way that seems right to a man but the way thereof are the ways of death there is one way there's one road to life Jesus Christ said I am the way the truth and the life and no man comes to the father except through me there's only one way to there's only one way to life but he says you make one wrongness you you take away that you think is right and it's not on the word of God it's not in line with the word of God he says and the that way singular are the ways of death the end of it is ways you make one decision that's wrong and Satan can take you to to death a bazillion ways he's got so many ways to get you off the path because once you're off the path it just branches and branches and branches and he keeps taking you and you can end up dead six ways past Sunday he's got all sorts of options as soon as you get off the word God's got one way Satan has many ways to take you away right Cain's opportunity the prophet of God was saying was that he could praise the Lord and say I was wrong but now I'm right as in now I know the way and if his true desire was to be accepted by God then Cain would have done it if his true desire was to be accepted by God he would have followed What God had shown to be right he had the opportunity but he turned it down and look at what Cain does church he doubles down on his mistake he doubles down on it he says I'm right God and you're wrong in the face of everything in front of him of all evidence pointing to Cain not being right he doubles down he says God I'm going to stick with my way I'm gonna stick with me because I was sincere because I brought what I thought was best and I'm going to stay right here Church he's pouting because he wasn't right that's not the way a child of God acts but when we see that things are right then we step into it and say yes Lord yes Lord I'll do it that way amen what's the problem is the problem can sacrifice not in and of itself because he didn't know any better church God doesn't condemn us for our ignorance he doesn't condemn us for what we don't know but he condemns us when we have been shown the truth and we turn away from it when we turn away from it remember the scripture scripture talks about God winking at our ignorance listen that's what the blood of Christ was there for is to cover our ignorance and it covers Us Even in our iniquity and that's God's grace to us amen but in our ignorance the blood of Jesus covered us through all of those Church ages for two thousand years since he died on the cross but now the word has been opened to us and we have no excuse we have no excuse and to turn it down now is Judgment because we know it we know what to do and we've got a cloud of witnesses around us that have showed us how to do it amen we have no excuse anymore but Kane's pouting because he wasn't right and then when God comes he comes back to him he says and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him so the problem isn't the sacrifice the problem is Cain the root of the problem is not what he did it's what's inside of him that refuses to allow him to to actually come to what God wants him to do what is it it's religious Pride that's all it was flat out church it's religious Pride that he said this is the way I want to worship and God if you don't accept it then I don't care and that's what we have today when we put a period after our worship when we put a period after what we believe because God is progressively revealing himself to us constantly and when we put a period down we become a denomination and God says Ichabod he writes Ichabod over the door the glory of the Lord is departed and he can't deal with us anymore because we've said I stop here I stop here I'm good with where I'm at regardless of what the word says Cain refused to lay his idea down and take God's provided way you know what Kane's error was he thought the sacrifice was about him he thought the sacrifice was about him because he said Abel's bringing the sacrifice and that's for Abel and I'm bringing one about me and then when God accepted Abel's sacrifice and refused Cain Cain said God is refusing me and he attached himself personally to that sacrifice but it wasn't about Cain it was supposed to be a representation for him before God and God said vegetables have no life in them fruit has no life in them it's the blood of the Lamb that has life in it there's a life for a life you've got to have a life that takes yours Cain I'm not turning you down I'm saying that that won't do he's just saying it won't work I'm not turning you down Cain I'm turning your sacrifice down but Cain had so attached himself to his work that he couldn't let it go and he said that's it that's it God I don't want any part of this anymore Abel was no less under the curse of sin than he then came was in the eyes of God they were both Sinners remember in James Wright brother Kingsley says if you offend him one you've offended in all so Cain and Abel were equal in the eyes of God in terms of their sinfulness so that's not the problem the problem is not their sinfulness the problem is did they bring the right thing Cain was ignorant when he gave a sacrifice and now God shows him this the correct way to do it and he says no that's when we show what's really inside of us is When God says here's the way to do it and we say nope I'm going to double down I'm going to be stubborn let me continue this quote we started earlier he says every Easter you go to church and they bid you Merry Christmas because they won't see you till more till Christmas people that come to church once twice three times a year right that's not the way we go to church is it scripture says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together all the more as you see the final day approaching he says he says they won't see you anymore till Christmas come to Easter to show off a new head or a new Bonnet or a new suit of clothes bring up a big arm full of Easter flowers and throw them on the altar he says God doesn't want Easter flowers on the altar he wants you on the altar you're the one that belongs on the altar but see how he got away no matter we can't believe for Divine Healing you got the carp before the horse you got to get the thing running right before you can believe right he's saying you've got to be put in order you got to come to the truth before you can get the results of the truth he says you got to get this right up here and right down here in your heart before you can see right members Jesus said you can't even understand the kingdom of God without the new birth without the Holy Spirit you can't even understand God's intentions for this world you just don't see it brother I'm saying what he's pointing us back he's saying you got to get your mind you got to get the mind of Christ and you got to get the holy spirit in your heart and then you'll see right and you'll be able to push through he says you've got to have something in here to believe with before you can believe what's he saying he's saying Cain refused to lay his ideas Cain refused to lay himself on the Altar and say Lord consume this consume me and when he refused to lay that down then what happened is God had to turn away from him and really Cain turned away from God God stayed there God stayed there and Cain had to walk away from it all Cain said if my way isn't good enough I'm not going to do anything else prophet of God said you will fight your way to hell he says because God keeps putting things in front of you to keep you from going that way and he says he brings you to church he brings songs he brings ministers he brings the word of God he brings all these things he says and you've got to fight your way to get through all of those to get to hell because God is not willing that any should perish but he says so you're fighting your way through and that's what Cain was doing here his religious Pride got up and he refused to move forward he says God interprets his own word by its terms that he spoke in see Cain said I'm religious I'm a lover of my maker I offer to thee this fine altar I offer to you the sacrifice I built all these things up Lord because I love you he said Abel said the same thing now it's the one that's Vindicated the one that's proven God came down and received Abel's sacrifice because by Revelation he had struck the true channel of God that was accepted the only difference between two of them one had a real Revelation the other one didn't same sincerity same good intentions why did God receive Abel and condemn Cain because Abel had recompense unto the reward because he had a spiritual Revelation a spiritual revelation of the will of God in there in that Revelation Abel offered his sacrifice and then we see there coming up in the beginning two Spirits one unable and one on Cain both of them religious both of them at the altar both of them confessing both of them Believing on God he says but one had the vision and the other did not doing the exact same thing and getting completely different results Church except for one thing one brought an acceptable Sacrifice by revelation Hebrews 11 says by faith God comes down to Cain and he says Cain I don't even require you to have a revelation he says I'll give it to you on simple obedience simple obedience Kane just copy what Abel did and I'll accept you that's how gracious God is church that you can just copy what somebody's doing in this case and he'll accept you you're the seed of the serpent you're not a manifested son of God but I'll accept you if you'll do exactly what he says and he refused why because it wasn't in him to Humble himself to God it just wasn't in him he couldn't do it listen if we put it into plain language Cain refused to repent we look at repentance kind of as a as a bad thing so many times and it's not it's our access to God is repentance so first thing Acts 2 38 says they said what can we do what must we do and Peter says repent first thing you got to do is repent then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ from the remission of sins and then you receive the Holy Ghost but the first thing you got to start is with repentance and what happens is our pride Rises up and we can't admit that we were wrong we kind of admitted spiritually we can't admit it mentally we can't admit it physically we can't admit it in our day-to-day lives and something pulls up and that's not the nature of God it's not the nature of God that pulls us up and says I refuse to admit I've been wrong all this time and sometimes we have been wrong for a long time I spent four years being wrong if I could put it that way but we've got to be able to come and admit it and say I am wrong and there is a right way and that's what I'm interested in is the right way not in my what this facade I built up of a reputation or whatever it might be sometimes what it is is our clear conscience in ignorance says I don't need to repent because I did it with the best of intentions repentance is not because you knew you were wrong repentance is because you are wrong and so it repentance does not come with excuses repentance is I am wrong that's it that's it if I do something wrong I don't go to somebody and say I was wrong and here's why I did it I go and I say I was wrong can you forgive me will you forgive me and that's it we leave the excuses out because no excuse will stand before God don't waste your time don't waste his time take your time and make things right but we're looking at two Spirits here we're talking about two sons with completely different spirits on them but listen we can be sincerely but ignorantly wrong but when we come to the knowledge of the truth what we do there is what defines us not that we were wrong it's what did we do after we found out what was right because we were all wrong we're all wrong the scripture says while we were yet sinners Christ died for us and gave his life for us we were all wrong at some point and we're all wrong in some way right now because we're still here the resurrection hasn't happened the Rapture hasn't happened God's still working on us so that means there's more to be had and that means there's more to let go there's areas that aren't completely clear in our life that aren't completely in line with the word so we've got to be able to say I'm wrong Lord Make Me Right show me what's right Cain was not judged because he brought the wrong sacrifice he was judged because he refused to bring the right one when he knew it amen when that truth is laid before us and we realize we're off the word of God we're out of the will of God that's where we show our true colors what will we do now what will we do now I spoke of the supporting that Pastor when it was all said and done the blame could not be on that man the blame had to be on me for my part because I had to go back and see how can a Son of God be fooled we can be fooled Church we can be fooled and how do we get fooled we get off of the word of God in some fortune and all it is is a little bit sometimes and it opens up this big blind spot in our life and what it was was that man that man there were red flags little red flags but red flags nonetheless where it was showing that he wasn't as committed and he wasn't putting the the the the focus on the things of God and different things and he was flighty maybe I could put it that way you can't have a flighty pastor doesn't work he was a pastor and he wasn't acting like a pastor and that in and of itself should have been a red flag but I didn't go to the word and say listen There's issues here and we got to talk about it why because he was my best friend because he had a gift of ministry and we enjoyed his preaching but that wasn't it that's never enough gifts and callings are without the repentance of scripture says we still have to be held to the word and I had to be able to go to that man and and make it right get it right with him I had to do the hard work of getting it right I had to tell my wife I was wrong and I had to tell the church I was wrong because if I can admit I messed up then how's God going to take me forward men with our families we've got to be able to say I led us wrong I let something in that I shouldn't have I put something out that I shouldn't have we've got to be able to Humble ourselves and say I'm wrong and I Repent of it and I'm going to go the right way otherwise how can God deal with us as Sons the the first nature of the laodicean age and we'll get to in a little bit is that of repentance for the True Believer it's an age of repentance for us but the laodicean spirit this final age resists repentance it resists repentance it's a spirit that's tied to the idea of that I am right and I don't need anybody else to tell me I'm wrong I don't want to hear it I can't hear it I'm not willing to hear it I'm right because I'm right I'm right because I'm sincere I'm right because there's nothing in me that says I'm wrong even though this is screaming out and saying you're off but what they do is they put this away and then they say I'm good to go because they won't take it back to the absolute prophet of God is quoting Revelation 3 17 it says I have need of nothing now when anybody says I have need of nothing he could very well be saying I have everything or he could be saying I don't want any more as I am full now you can express this any way you want and it all adds up to the fact that the church is completion complacent she is satisfied with what she has she either figures she has it all or has enough he says and that is exactly what we find today I've got everything I need period I know it all period I'm good to go period I'm content where I'm at period it shows there's something wrong inside of you when you do those sorts of things amen there was the famous Fellowship last year sometime where I said something small and uh and I was wrong and I stood up and I said on video I am wrong and brother Joe Coffey put it on video so that we could enjoy it for the many many decades to come now that's a small thing but do you think that felt good to me as much as a joke as it was and it was a small deal I had to swallow Pride to do that because if I can't do it in the little things how am I going to do it in the big things listen wrong is wrong and we've got to be able to admit it when we get off the path I laughed and I joked about it but it wasn't fun to me as in I did not enjoy it but I could appreciate it because I'm rarely wrong publicly it's said of the curlets that we practice in private so that we're perfect in public and that can be a spirit it's good for us all of us not just us curlets to say we're wrong publicly from time to time especially if we are wrong especially if we are wrong amen listen to this he says when you can see a man that's wrong and proven wrong proven wrong when the evidence is right before us he says then that shows he wants to be a Christian he walks up and says I am wrong that's a real Christian but that guy that'll all blow up and run around to one side and say oh there wasn't nothing to it and like this watch out brother you can see right then that he went out under condemnation because he wasn't of us can't accept correction he says be zealous and repent he says now this false church has Zeal make no mistake about it Zeal is not what makes us a Christian sincerity is not what makes us a Christian being like Christ is what makes us a Christian the word Christian is just bandied around like any word these days and it can mean anything and it means everything and yet it rarely means exactly what it's supposed to which is Christ like he says her Zeal has literally been that of the Jews in John 2 17 the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up drives God nuts annoys him to no end he says but it is a wrong Zeal it is for what the house of their own building it is for their own Creeds their dogmas organizations their own righteousness they have put the word out for their own ideas they depose the Holy Ghost and made men into leaders they have put aside eternal life as a person and make it good works or even Church Conformity rather than good works good works would be one thing there are people that are going to get into into heaven on Good Works but that's not the way you want to get in you want to get in under the blood of the Lamb by the holy spirit that baptizes you into the body of Christ I don't want to fall back on works I want my Works to have nothing to do with it and then that's the way that he's intended for it he said but God is calling for another Zeal it is the Zeal to cry I am wrong now who's going to say that he is wrong what is it that all of these denominations are based upon the claim to originality and that of God my wife and I were talking about this the other day how do we know we're right we all say we're right every single one of us says we're right how do we know it he says the claim that they are right now they all cannot be right in fact not one of them is right they are whiteed sepulchers full of dead men's bones he's quoting Jesus words they have no life they have no Vindication God has never made himself known in any organization now listen to this church they say they are right because they are the ones that are saying it but saying it does not make it so they need the Vindicated thus saith the Lord of God and they don't have it and that's what Cain refused to do he couldn't knuckle down and say I don't have what I thought I had that's the what that is is humility Church and that is access to God when you say Lord my spoken testimony is higher than my lived testimony that's a wonderful place to be if you can recognize it and admit it but if not sin lies at the door because you won't step out and say I'm wrong and I need to be made right I need to come to a higher plane I need to go to another level Lord what happened with Cain after this that's what always happens jealousy and unintended consequences Pride flares up and he goes and he kills his brother and it's the first it's the first murder that's that's that's recorded in in history and it's all on the basis of religious Pride religious Pride came wanted to serve God his own way and that led him to persecuting the true Son of God that was with him listen to this we find out that Abel because God had received him and he did not receive Cain's beautiful big offering he had toiled so hard for Cain worked hard for his no denying his work ethic and Cain was religious and bowed down and worshiped and so forth did everything that Abel did only he didn't have the revelation of what was the truth so we find out that when God accepted Abel's Revelation and his offering it made Cain jealous of Abel and there was the first murder we find out that jealousy become between the herdsmen of Abraham and lot and they had to separate we find out that Moses and Korra had a clash also Jesus and Judas had a clash and as ever it's been the same thing and so it is today the natural church and the spiritual church has a clash when they come together now the natural tries to match the spiritual always with a carnal impersonation but as it was with isan Jacob it will not work God has his church called named set aside and in the age that she lives in he'll reveal himself to her each and every time what a consolation that ought to be for us church that in an age when everybody thinks they have it all they know it all that they have need of nothing God will come and he'll reveal to his true children who and what he is and their part to play in all of this it says just as he said in Romans the eighth chapter that the foreknowledge or predestination of God might stand sure so in other words we don't have to worry about are we going to get to the other side what we have to worry about is are we going to go his way are we going to go our way until we get sick of it and come back to his way I've said it before we're going to come easier we're going to go hard the easy way is the easier way God's way it's not that it's easy but it's easier it's more direct and it has it has it has fruit all the way through it has benefits all the way through our way is sewn with everything else and nothing good can come out of it all he's asking us to do is take it as he gives it you don't have to try and jump ahead just stay faithful to what God has shown you now and when you do that then he opens up the next chapter it's Progressive God progressively reveals himself to his children he progressively grows as and matures us from spiritual children into full-grown adults with him don't don't don't worry if you're not too a full adult worry are you the same as you were last month because he never stops and so that means we don't stop if we stop we're backsliding because the child of God is always moving forward he's always she is here she is always growing we're talking on this tale of two sons and if we look at isan Jacob like he talked about here we see a similar issue but with it's even more in contrast here because unlike Cain and Abel where Cain was obviously the bad one when you look at isan Jacob on the face of it Jacob was the bad one and Esau was the better one Esau was Jacob was the shyster Jacob was the cheater Jacob was the one that was always trying to work the Angles and get the better deal on somebody Jacob was always trying he was always in it for him in every single way and yet he was the elected predestinated Son of God Esau on the other hand stayed home he was faithful to his mama faithful to his daddy and these different things but his attitude towards the things of God proved what he really was but currently speaking we would say that Esau was the better man than Jacob and he saw it when he turned down the blessing when he sold it he had good Logic for and he says if I'm dead what good is the blessing to me I'll give you the blessing I'll give you the the the firstborn blessing for some of that stew so I can live to fight another day he had good reason for it and that showed that his interest was more in the short term rather than the long term did he really think he was going to die if he really stopped to think about it he'd know somebody would have given him food at some point he'd have made it through but he said no I'll give the blessing up for food right now Jacob on the other hand cheated his way through life constantly cheated constantly trying to get the better deal constantly trying to do what the other person didn't anticipate so he could enrich himself time and time again then he goes he runs away because Esau is going to kill him and what does he do he gets a taste of his own medicine doesn't he he goes to Laban and he falls in love with Rachel's with his daughter Rachel and and he tells Laban I'll work for her seven years and he worked seven years and it comes down to the wedding and he gets drunk and Laban puts his other daughter Leah in the bedroom with them instead of Rachel you got to be drunk to realize that you're you're your wife's sister in the room with you he was out of it and he fooled him and so now he's married to Leah and he can't get Rachel and so and so Laban says we'll work another seven years and I'll give you Rachel he works 14 years to get one wife he wanted and one he didn't what was it God was showing him you can sow your way it'll come around but you're going to pay a big price for it Jacob and even after that Jacob was always trying to flip things and God always blessed them that's the amazing thing God always blessed him and you say brother John how does that work because there was going to come a time where God was going to take it all away if he didn't line up and what happens is he heads back home and then he he finds out that Esau is on the way and he's got 400 men with him and he knows that he's going to lose all of his wealth and he's probably going to lose his life and then what does Jacob do Jacob goes and he wrestles and he holds on until he gets a change because what he knows that if he loses his life his wealth is no good to him everything he's fought for everything he's struggled for everything he's he's cheated for is not worth anything and Jacob goes and he holds on until the change happens where in the situation in the circumstance no Jacob holds on until there's a change in here church so often what's happening is we're looking at the situation and we're praying for the circumstances change and what God is waiting for you to do is realize I am wrong and the change needs to happen in here the change has to happen in here and that way when what what whatever comes to life whatever Storms Come whatever Trials come then we stand assured because why the change has been in here like David wrote in Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he's surrounded by soldiers he's surrounded by by Saul's Army he's surrounded by trials and tribulations and in the midst of that he can say the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leads me besides Still Waters deep Waters he restores my soul yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil why because David had something in here that had changed and that's what held him through those times he didn't say God take away the enemy he said God give me peace and then he testified God you gave me peace in the storm that's what the disciples didn't realize when they're in the boat with Jesus and he's there and he's sleeping and they're saying Jesus wake up the storm is going to kill us and he says oh ye of little faith I'm in the boat with you how can you die how can anything happen when I'm in the boat with you get to the place where you say he's with me and then I don't have to worry about circumstances because my life is in his hands then and he's the one that's ordaining everything that comes this way what about Esau Jacob finally got a change and got preserved all of his wealth in that but the changes in the in in Jacob and he walked with a limp after that he showed that he had met God but what about Esau Issa got wealth you got big families he got most of the land he got everything that he'd really wanted except the blessing of God and he could never come to God again when he sold that Birthright he could never come to God that was his turning point and he walked away and the scripture says that he let me put it this way Esau had an itch he couldn't scratch he knew that he was supposed to be doing something and he couldn't do it that's the that's got to be the most horrible thing is to know to do right and not do it no you know that you ought to do it you know that you ought to want to do it and yet the want isn't even there but you know what you're supposed to do and that's what Esau was dealing with in Hebrews Paul talks about he says lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright for one little bit of meat he sold his Birthright he says for you know that how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing so when he realized what he'd done when he realized what he'd given it up he came back wanting that blessing again it says he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears it calls him a profane person if you go to the root word there it means people that are unfit to access or know God because they approach him outside of faith they are Godless and sacrilegious but you say brother John he's seeking God he's seeking repentance and he's tearful because he knows he's missed his opportunity but he can't find a place to actually repent it wasn't true repentance he couldn't come to a place where his repentance was acceptable because he was doing it because he knew he should do it not because it was in him to do it in the first place Esau tried his best to become a Christian and couldn't do it the Bible said he wept bitterly seeking a place to repent and couldn't find it before he was even born God condemned him because he knew he was a rotten shyster in his heart Jacob's name means deceiver shyster and that was Jacob's flesh but Esau was a shyster inside and that's what God was looking at God by foreknowledge knew it he said I love Jacob and I hate Esau and Esau look like the gentleman he stayed home taking care of his old blind daddy fed the cattle and everything he was a good boy and Jacob was a mama's boy little old sisified Storyteller that's what he was you have to admit it the Bible amidst it and brings it he run around doing everything hanging around with Mama but yet Jacob with all of his ups and downs and his sissified ways he still had respect to that Birthright he says that's the Keynote Esau was twice the gentleman of Jacob if we had to judge him today to be a member of our church you take Esau a thousand to one if you didn't know him he says but God took Jacob why Esau couldn't humble himself and he could never find a place to truly repent God's training brings us to repentance always listen if if I were to bring Samuel up and ask him a question he would give me an answer and it would invariably be wrong but he would have full confidence in his answer because he's a three-year-old why would he ever think he's wrong right and when we come to God and we start our schooling we're full of confidence because we know that we're a child of God and what we have to do is we have to say I don't know anything I'm wrong everything I know is wrong and Lord you have to teach me what's right and that's why he chastens us but he brings us to repentance and it's only a true child of God can actually repent God or Esau had the opportunity and he sold it out and then he tried to come back to it and he just couldn't get to that place amen Church the question I ask myself is what are we selling out to today what is it that holds us back what is it that hinders us what is it that refuses us from saying I am wrong the first thing is always going to be Pride always going to be Pride because we don't want to Humble ourselves we don't want to admit that we were wrong Esau had a price I'm not here to condemn you or call you out today I'm asking what is our price what is the thing that holds us back from stepping into what God has for us and leaving everything else behind Cain couldn't get past his religious Pride right Esau couldn't get past his short-term benefits pilate couldn't get past the pressure of the mob and Demas couldn't get past what the wonderful things this world had for him everyone's got a price Maybe what I'm saying is the price is going to be offered Satan's going to put it in front of us and you'll get offers for everything you'll get offers for jobs you'll get offers for influence you'll get offer opportunities to use your gift you'll get opportunities for marriage you'll get opportunities for relationships influence all these different things and Satan will throw it in front of us I'm not saying that's a problem because it's going to happen it always happens Satan will always throw opportunities in front of us but the question is what is it that we latch onto that we're not supposed to scripture says this in Galatians ye did run well who did hinder thee who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth we've got to come back to who's in the mirror always first because in the end I make the decision I don't create the opportunities I don't create the tests I don't put those things in front of Myself by God's grace but I'm the one that makes the decision and when I step out the who that hindered me is not the is not Satan that put it in front of me it's me that decided to go down that route yeah it always comes back to me the buck stops with me Church nobody controls me as in nobody physically no person controls me what happens in my family the buck stops with me because I'm the final arbiter I'm the head of the house I make the decisions so when something goes wrong it comes back to me not the woman that thou gave me Lord not the children that she bore Lord It's Me because I'm the I'm the man of the house I'm the husband I'm the father of the house the buck stops with me and so yes it might be somebody at work that started us on this or it'd be somebody at school or it might be something with our job or something like that but in the end we make the decision we make the decision so the who that hinders us it might be Satan that's trying it but it's us that allows it and so the Buck always has to stop with us in these things and invariably If we're honest we'll Trace what happened back to the decision that we made of our own free will nobody takes our will away from us Church we make it of our own free will and listen it can start with something as simple as missing one service watching one movie listening to One Wrong song being around one wrong person going to one wrong website whatever it is one decision will lead you to all of those things and you say how did I get here there's a a minister I know and he's a Godly Man a wonderful man a wonderful Minister and he had an issue where he was having feelings towards a woman at work and he went and he told his pastor and he says I've got to step out of the pulpit he says because I got to find out where this is coming from and he wasn't saying I got to find out who did this to me he says I gotta find out within me where this is coming from because the Holy Spirit does not make me attractive to a woman I'm not married to I've got a wife and I love my wife he says but I'm having an attraction towards a woman at work and that's got to stop and he willingly pulled himself out of the pulpit until he went and he rooted that out can you imagine how humbling that is as a minister to say I'm having issues with attractions towards a woman that's not my mouth not not my wife but he did it he did it because he was more he was more concerned about being right with God than appearing right to his Pastor right to his right wife write to his church he humbled himself and he pulled himself out of the pulpit until he got that sorted and he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt where it came from and that he had overcome it and that he wouldn't have to deal with it again that's what God's looking for Lord something's wrong is it me where is it in me that's what he's looking for church let it not be said that we willfully enter into something sometimes we do get tricked sometimes it's a moment of weakness and believe me Satan knows when we're weak doesn't he he knows when we're stressed out when our emotions are raw he knows when we're just tired of doing the same old thing we're tired of the battle we're tired of the fight and that's when he brings the opportunity in that's when he brings the Temptation in but let us not go looking for it listen the scripture says a a just man falls seven times but he gets up again we're going to trip we're going to fall but get up again and get back on the path that we talked about the straight path The Narrow Path and get back to it but also let's not put it on somebody else let's say it's on me I made the decision I want to take one more example before we close this morning Leviticus 10 it says these are these are Aaron's sons nadab and abahu the sons of Aaron took either of them his sensor and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered Strange Fire before the Lord which he commanded them not and there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them and they die before the Lord this is a very scary event and I want to say one thing this is under the law not under grace I don't expect this to happen today but God doesn't respond well when we add to what he said or when we take away from it and that's really what I'm trying to get at this morning amen God spent chapter after chapter if you've read Leviticus which I'm still not through it it's chapter after chapter of ceremony after ceremony of sacrifice after sacrifice and you must do this and you must do this and you must do this and you have to do it in the right order and this has to be done and that has to be done and Priests here's what you have to wear and here's your duties day by day and and God Must Have Spent hours and hours maybe days with Moses letting Moses laboriously write this out chapter after chapter for everything that the priesthood was supposed to do and then as soon as it's done as soon as Moses delivers that to the priest here's your here's your book here here's how you operate a service now here's what God requires here's what God has accepted here's what God says you have to do what do nadab and abah who do they go and they say we're going to bring a new ceremony God's given them page after page there's no way that they would have even known it all at that point and so they came in they said we're going to do something new and we're going to bring an offering to God just like Kane we're going to bring an offering to God we're going to worship God in a way that we think is going to be good they had this exhaustive list of ceremonial duties for the priesthood and they and they came in and they brought something different what did they do they did two things they didn't use fire from the Tabernacle to light their incense what happened was that was Holy Fire and the priests weren't allowed to let that fire go out that was the duty they had to keep the oil topped up at all times and that fire had to burn continuously and that was a representation of the holy spirit in our life they didn't use that to light their incense and then they didn't offer incense as part of their standard duties God had said here's how you serve me priests and they went and they did something that he hadn't told them to do in that what they did is they neglected to do what he had told them to do and that's the lesson for us here is that what happens is we come in and we say God I'm going to do this for you and God I'm going to do that for you and Lord here's this offering here's this sacrifice and we do like we've talked about before these grand gestures and God says I just want you to do what's here I've given you 66 books of what to do and you're writing the 67th book because that's the way you think you want to do it and I don't doubt for a second that those young men felt that they were anointed felt that they were inspired they were wanting to do God of service they were doing all of these things but he had told them what to do and they neglected what he told them to do to do something that they thought and that's all it was it was just a thought were they sincere probably were they expecting good results yes no doubt they were seeking to do something for God but they put God out of their worship by what they didn't do what he told them to do God had said here's how you worship me and they said well we're just going to try this way but God had said here's how you worship me this is what is acceptable this is the way to do it and they said we're going to try this way see what happens well they saw what happened for about a split second before they were consumed with fire you can't come into God's house with your own ideas you can't come in with your own thoughts you can't come in with your own plan can't come in with your own opinions that has to die at the door of the Tabernacle and we're not talking a physical building here we're talking you can't come to God with your own ideas he's already given you his and that's what he's concerned with will you do what he says with his he says now Aaron it was his duty to light these lamps and those lamps had to be lit they had to be continually lit hold on to it now look he says look keep Reverend and listen these lamps had to be lit by the fire that God had lit Aaron's sons went in with some strange fire and God slew them in the door that's right it was strange fire he says it should have been the fire that God started it's got to be anointed by the Holy Spirit got to be anointed by it and you can bring Strange Fire in service you can bring Strange Fire in your life where what you're saying Lord this is what I'm going to do for you and God says well what about the things I've asked you to do you haven't done those yet how about we start with what I've asked you to do son or daughter and then maybe we'll talk about that but we'll never talk about it because he'll tell you what he wants you to do sons of God are led by the spirit of God it's that simple and he's and the Holy Spirit will never ever ever take you away from this so God's saying do what I asked you to do and that's where you get the results the result is not the plus God's word plus the results are in God's word stay there that's our boundaries we don't limit God but God has limited himself and said my word is what is absolute stay with that and you're going to be okay it was so severe what they did here that God said to Moses he says you tell Aaron he's not even allowed to mourn his his son's death he says they brought Strange Fire they ought to have known better I gave them every reason of what to do I showed them everything they were supposed to do and they didn't do it he says you can't even mourn them he says take them bury them outside the camp whoever touches them wash themselves and they can come in at the evening time just to touch them made somebody unclean because they have brought Strange Fire they have brought something that God hadn't told them to do they ignored everything he said and then brought something that was on their own making Church we're talking about coming to adoption and when God shows us everything he expects of us and then we say no but I'll do this rebellions in our heart rebellions in our heart and you'll stay there and I don't have the quote here but brother Branham would say he said he says here disobedient children he says and it'll come to the place he says where you'll stay a child and God can't do anything with you because you keep refusing you keep refusing to do what he said and you keep doing what you want to do there's two traps that come with this as we start to close the first is that we seek to take something of ours into God's Kingdom we try and take we we say we go down in death when we go into baptism and whatnot but what happens is we try and take some element of ourself of our ideas our thoughts our Doctrine whatever it would be and we try and take it with us into God's Kingdom and it's not that way it's not that way if you if you look in in the scriptures we see that Abraham left everything and what he did bring caused problems so you can't take anything with you when you come into God's kingdom that's why it's a new birth that's why you're a new creation is that all of that is supposed to be left behind as Cain and Abel came they want to be acceptable to God that's what we as Believers want isn't it we want to be acceptable to God we want God to say Well done thou good and faithful servant enter into the joys that I prepared for you that's what we're wanting in these things but what happens is we try and make ourselves more acceptable by doing something above and beyond what God has told us to do that's not what makes us more acceptable what makes us acceptable to God is obedience to his word simply remember that's what that's what Saul did we spoke of this a while ago Saul comes and he says I I kept some stuff to make an offering to God it was the word of God plus but anytime you add to it what happens is you have to take away someplace else that's what he did and he was in Disobedience and and Samuel the prophet said to Saul he says that's it he says you try to make yourself more acceptable to God and now God is going to take the kingdom away from you because he can't trust you we look at the law and I read the the other day a minister was preaching he said something along the lines of the law was God's response to men trying to make themselves acceptable to God they say God give us something to do and we'll do it and God said all right here you go and they spend thousands of years proving they couldn't do it but that's what we want to do we want to add ourselves into our Salvation we want to add ourselves into this and that's the Trap is that these two sons of Aaron they wanted to add a new way of worship and God said no no no no let's just stick with what I've got for you already I've told you what I want do that and leave the rest behind that has no place in the Kingdom Prophet God said this he says the true bride attracts the attention of God by keeping his word so simple so simple keep his word that's what gets you ready for graduation if I could put it that way we go back in the scriptures and Moses laid out God told Moses how to how to make an altar and how to bring a sacrifice to God listen to this he says the altar an altar of Earth Thou shalt make unto me and shall sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings thy sheep and thine oxen in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee so the standard altar that any man could could use was simple dirt just dirt you built up a mound of dirt and then you sacrificed on top of it and what was it it was showing the sacrifice can't be about your works it's not about what you did it's not about how you prepared it it's not about how you shaped it it's not about how you turn that dirt into something better it's just dirt we're just dirt we're just dirt and he's saying don't bring anything special to it because you're not a part of this it's not about you it's about the sacrifice and then he says if that will make me an altar of stones will you say well I need an altar at my house and and dirt isn't just going to look good so let's do it up in stone like the house he says if you make an altar of stone you shall not build it of hewn Stone in other words he says you can't take those rocks and shape them and make them fit perfectly and look good because you've added to it he says for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou Hast polluted it if you add to the sacrifice you pollute it if you take what is supposed to be about God and a representation of you and add yourself to it there's problems and God says you pollute it I won't accept it it's got to be natural it's got a way to God be the way that God used it the way that God made it amen God had provided the dirt God had provided the stone and he says you make it out of what I provided not what you've shaped because as soon as you touch it you pollute it second trap and this one I think is more subtle so the first was that we seek to bring our things into God's kingdom but listen to this it's that we seek to bring God into our kingdom now you say but John that's exactly what I want I want God in my life no I said God in your kingdom because whoever's Kingdom it is is king or queen so if I bring God into my life I'm the king of my kingdom and he can't be Lord and King because I'm the king because it's my kingdom but I've got to go outside the camp I've got to leave everything like Abraham did and I've got to go to his kingdom because in his kingdom he's the king see what happens is we say Lord here's my life here's my here's my job here's my family here's my relationships here's my finances Lord come in and bless it that's not what God asked us to do he said leave everything you've got and come to me and I'll take care of you because what we do when we do this this is what it looks like is we say God bless my decisions no we're supposed to be hidden in Christ so it's not supposed to be our decision it's supposed to be his decision it's not supposed to be Lord bless my leadership it's supposed to be Lord you're leading me so I'm trusting your blessing see what we're doing is we're asking God to come in and confirm what we've decided rather than saying Lord You're the filter you're the decider you're the order Giver you're the provider so I'm just here and whatever happens is going to be because you made it happen not because I've asked your blessing into my life because what happens otherwise is we're seeking to bring God into our kingdom and he's trying to get us out of ours into his and so we're literally going in opposite directions but we're in all sincerity saying I want Jesus in my life no no he says you can't have him in your life you've got to go into his life you got to lay your life down and you've got to go into his kingdom remember he said to the disciples except a man leave his father and his mother and these different things he can't he can't come into the kingdom they said did we not forsake all he says you have and because of it you'll have a benefit because of it but you've got to forsake all you've got to lay it all down how many times have we preached Lord that that he expects us to die out we die out and that means we come in as a new creation into the kingdom of God that's what he's looking for not saying Lord bless me because I've done this but Lord I'm in your will Lord I'm in your way and I'm trusting the blessing will follow that's what he's looking for amen remember what he said earlier in that quote he said God Wants You on The Altar so rather than saying God come to me scripture says I will call all men unto me so we got to go to him he doesn't come to us he calls us and he Woos us and he does all these things but we got to come to him we got to forsake all and go to him in these things what we're looking for is that hidden life amen where my thoughts my opinions my emotions my desires my preferences they have no place no place I have them but they have no place because why I've taken on the mind of Christ I've taken on the Life of Christ I'm held by the word that he was held by and so the results will come regardless of what it looks like and we'll stay there and so it's not going to be Lord bless what I'm doing saying Lord I'm doing what you told me to do see the twist he's a Twist we're asking him to come into us and he say no your place is in me you're never seeing this you've never seen the scripture where he has to come out of where he is to bring to go to us in that way we come into him we're a part of his body he's not a part of our body they're one we're one I understand those things but we have to leave where we are and go to him and that's where we're going to find what we're looking for amen God bless you let's stand this morning we've talked about Redemption for so long and the Very premise of redemption is that it takes you out of where you are and it takes you into Christ and so for asking him to come into our portion we're actually refusing his Redemption because we're staying where we're at rather than moving on to where he is amen well when we get that straight when we're hidden in him I'm not anointed he's my anointing it's his gift it's his Blessing it's his word it's his action it's all him it's all him it's all him because he's the king and I'm just responding to that and then I don't have to worry about it I don't have to worry about any of it I just trust and I rest because I'm in his kingdom now if I'm in my kingdom that's when I worry when I'm in my thoughts when I'm in my preferences that's when I worry because that's where trouble is that's where Satan can get a hold on me is when I'm in my kingdom but if I can say Lord I want to be in your kingdom Lord I want to be found in your word then that's where my rest is that's where my joy is that's where my peace is is because that's where he is and I've surrendered everything to him amen man we're not inviting him in we're gathered into him already and we're resting in Heavenly places with him as the scripture says amen church I want to be hidden away I want to be so hidden that people won't understand anything I do because it makes no sense in their way of thinking but it makes perfect sense according to the word of God Amen and we've seen it each one of us has seen it as we've made decisions in our life as we we've walked away from opportunities as we've turned things down as as we've taken the the offenses and the hurts and these things that come our way and people say why do you do it why do you do it because it's Christ to me the hope of glory that's the only thing that keeps us doing it if it was my kingdom I'd have walked away but when I'm in him I can't walk away I'm bound to him he's my king he's my Lord he's my savior amen amen I want to be led by the Holy Spirit every single moment of my life amen that's what I desire more than anything Lord Lead Me Guide Me show me your way and then help me to walk in it that's what keeps Rebellion out when we say Lord I know there's nothing good in this flesh nothing good and that means I need you every moment of every day to overcome what's laying in front of me amen let's bow our heads each one Heavenly Father Lord It's a sovereign service this morning I know but Lord I'm not looking at anyone else this morning Lord I'm looking in the mirror but we're not looking to the left or the right oh but I'm looking at you Lord and then I look at my life and I say Lord I know there's more there's more surrender or there's more dying out there's more humbling Lord there's more correction I absolutely need Heavenly Father so Lord I'm raising my hands this morning Lord I'm praying your grace Lord keep us humble Lord keep us seeking your will in your way Lord let us do the harder work of patiently waiting for you Lord not driving forward not bulldozing Lord not insisting on these things but Lord let us rest on you let us trust that you do all things well Heavenly Father Lord You're our great provider you're our healer you're our deliverer Lord You're the ever-present god in our midst and Lord we're trusting that this morning Lord would you touch your people Lord where we're wrong help us to admit it Lord there's none perfect there's none good Lord but through your blood or we're acceptable to you Lord let us humble ourselves this morning Lord forgive me forgive me Lord where I fail where I have failed Lord knowing that the blood is sufficient but Lord may your grace help me to learn or to admit to make a right Lord and to move on in you Lord touch your people we pray now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen consume me Lord 595. consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit consume me Lord and make me more like you and bring me Lord and bless a
