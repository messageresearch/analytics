[40:20] amen and
[40:26] amen for
[41:15] um before we begin I just wanted to give
[41:17] a little testimony um uh the church
[41:20] knows that I've been dealing with a lot
[41:21] of sinus um stuff lately and I've just
[41:23] been very clogged up and uh last night
[41:27] uh
[41:28] I just felt um to pray to God and I said
[41:31] Lord Jesus I'm really stuffed up right
[41:33] now but I've got to sing tomorrow and I
[41:36] would like to be able to give you the
[41:37] utmost as I sing and so we prayed and um
[41:41] throughout the day it it it hadn't
[41:43] changed much but just uh God had kind of
[41:47] given me the phrase I see my enemy dead
[41:51] and so I just kind of clung to that and
[41:54] um as I was sitting in the Pew there um
[41:56] right before I came to sing I just felt
[41:57] it
[41:58] clear and I just want to give glory to
[42:01] God for
[42:11] that Lord you searched me you know
[42:16] me you know when I sit and when I
[42:21] Rise you know when I go out you know
[42:25] when I lay down and at
[42:30] night you're familiar with all of my
[42:34] ways Lord before a word is ever on my
[42:40] tongue you know it completely oh Lord
[42:44] you H me in both behind and

[1:08:19] church this is Brother Cory in the back
[1:08:21] and he introduced himself and he's been
[1:08:23] listening online for months and months
[1:08:25] he's got a history with the message he
[1:08:26] actually went to Saria church back when
[1:08:28] your dad was there so he knows brother
[1:08:31] Paul so he's familiar but he just showed
[1:08:32] up yesterday and he entered right in and
[1:08:35] I had no clue who he was and he
[1:08:36] introduced himself after service so he's
[1:08:37] been listening to us for months we don't
[1:08:40] know who's listening we don't know who's
[1:08:42] being fed but he came all the way so

[1:08:46] from the bottom of my heart for spending
[1:08:48] a vacation and he he may only get two
[1:08:51] Services that's all he might get he's

[1:08:54] be a vacation of sorts but I just wanted
[1:08:56] to welcome him personally from the
[1:08:58] pulpit this evening and he heads back I
[1:09:00] think on Sunday or or Monday and and
[1:09:02] different things but God bless you for
[1:09:04] coming out and taking your vacation
[1:09:06] he'll do over 7,000 kilometers by the
[1:09:09] time he's done to come to some church
[1:09:12] services amen you think he's going to go
[1:09:14] home with a blessing I believe he's

[1:09:43] and he's back with us and he's just sore
[1:09:45] kind of from what he's gone through
[1:09:47] apparently a heart attack's not uh not
[1:09:49] an easy thing to go through dying's not
[1:09:51] an easy thing to go through amen but
[1:09:53] he's back with us he certainly covets
[1:09:55] our prayers he wishes he was here but
[1:09:57] they're going to keep him in the in the
[1:09:58] hospital for a few more days to do some
[1:10:00] testing and confirmation of things let

[1:10:36] message for us and I'm trusting that he
[1:10:38] will speak as the Oracle of God tonight
[1:10:41] that the Holy Spirit would just flow
[1:10:42] through him and that the spirit that's
[1:10:45] going through him will be matched with

[1:16:34] was just wonderful how the songs and
[1:16:35] everything just come together so
[1:16:37] wonderfully and last night was such a
[1:16:39] blessing to my heart especially and we
[1:16:42] appreciate how rich the word is in the
[1:16:44] times we live in and uh we need it and
[1:16:47] we're going to need it more and more the
[1:16:49] power of his word so we're just glad to
[1:16:51] be here tonight and you're in a little
[1:16:53] bit of a tat of a different building
[1:16:55] than what you were be when I was here
[1:16:57] last time just a tad different and uh so
[1:17:02] praise the Lord uh you've been blessed
[1:17:04] by the Lord in such a special way and I
[1:17:07] know we don't put a lot of emphasis on
[1:17:08] buildings but we got one four or five
[1:17:10] years ago here and it is a blessing from
[1:17:13] the Lord God knows our needs and for
[1:17:15] many years there's a need there's a need
[1:17:17] there's a need and then God when he does
[1:17:19] it he does it great and so we should
[1:17:22] enjoy that give the glory to the Lord
[1:17:23] and we know the the Temple of the Lord
[1:17:25] is the people but yet God gives us
[1:17:27] places that we can uh feel free to
[1:17:30] worship and and to be able to enjoy a
[1:17:33] place of our own this way and the space
[1:17:35] and I can only I can only say this God
[1:17:37] gives you a space for a reason and
[1:17:40] that's not so you can spread out it so
[1:17:42] that more souls can come to the kingdom
[1:17:44] of God and I'm praying for that in New
[1:17:47] Finland that if this is providing a
[1:17:49] balanced preaching of the word in the
[1:17:51] message of the last days God will give
[1:17:53] you many many souls to come and hear the
[1:17:56] word of God and look at this brother
[1:17:57] coming from so far it's about hunger and
[1:18:00] people get hungry enough they're going
[1:18:01] to come and hear the word of God so I
[1:18:03] pray he fill these pews with hungry
[1:18:06] souls for the message of the last days
[1:18:09] here in Newland and I just I I make that
[1:18:11] my prayer and before God I believe and
[1:18:14] we're glad to be a part of it my wife

[1:19:55] home and we had fireworks and we had a
[1:19:57] bunch of stuff going on and in between
[1:19:59] time though I was listening to the
[1:20:01] service and wanted to join in and see
[1:20:03] where the Lord was uh how he was
[1:20:05] blessing us up here so we're glad to be
[1:20:07] here got some rest if you wouldn't mind
[1:20:09] turning tonight we're going to go right
[1:20:10] to the word of God and uh we're going to
[1:20:12] turn to John chapter 8 and read the
[1:20:15] Blessed word of God together and we
[1:20:16] trust this will be a blessing to you
[1:20:18] tonight John chapter 8 we want to read
[1:20:20] in the eth chapter of
[1:20:23] John and then uh we're going to
[1:20:26] go to Romans chapter 8 as
[1:20:31] well John chapter 8 and verse
[1:20:37] 30 and he spake these words many
[1:20:40] believed as he spake these words many
[1:20:42] believed on him and then said Jesus to
[1:20:45] those Jews which believed on him if you
[1:20:47] continue in my word then are ye my
[1:20:50] disciples indeed and ye shall know the
[1:20:53] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:20:57] so these are simple um words from Jesus
[1:21:00] that we've expressed for many years but
[1:21:02] we want to recognize the depth of them
[1:21:04] if you continue in my word then are you
[1:21:07] my disciples truly in other words this
[1:21:10] is an unfolding word all the time this
[1:21:12] is something that we keep growing with
[1:21:15] and so you can't bail out you got to
[1:21:16] continue to grow in it and then uh verse
[1:21:19] 32 is also significant statement you
[1:21:22] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:21:24] make you free there's only true freedom
[1:21:27] in truth can you say Amen then answered
[1:21:30] him we we be Abraham's seed and we're
[1:21:33] never in bondage to any man how sayest
[1:21:36] thou ye shall be made free Jesus
[1:21:39] answered them verily verely I say unto
[1:21:40] you whosoever committeth sin is the
[1:21:42] servant of sin sin is unbelief and the
[1:21:45] servant abideth not in the house forever
[1:21:48] but the son abideth ever if the son
[1:21:51] therefore shall make you free ye shall
[1:21:53] be free
[1:21:55] indeed amen Romans chapter 8
[1:22:00] and I believe it would be just one verse
[1:22:02] there verse
[1:22:07] 21 because the creature itself also
[1:22:11] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:22:14] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[1:22:18] the children of God creation is waiting
[1:22:22] for a release relas from bondage and
[1:22:26] that release from bondage happens when
[1:22:30] the Glorious Liberty of the children of
[1:22:32] God takes place our Liberty and our true
[1:22:36] Freedom uh starts the freedom uh from
[1:22:39] bondage from the Earth from creation
[1:22:41] everything it starts with our freedom it
[1:22:44] starts with the children of God and it's
[1:22:45] not just a regular Freedom it is a
[1:22:48] glorious Freedom it is a glorious
[1:22:51] freedom and I'd like to speak about that
[1:22:54] glor glorious Freedom tonight Heavenly
[1:22:56] Father We Trust Lord that you will you
[1:22:59] seen these meetings Lord from the
[1:23:01] foundation of the world and Lord you had
[1:23:03] a word in season for it Lord you knew
[1:23:06] who would be here so Lord we trust Lord
[1:23:09] that you had a word for each one even
[1:23:11] our precious brother who's traveled so
[1:23:13] many miles Lord and some of us coming in
[1:23:15] different places and some locally but
[1:23:17] Lord you had a word in season for this
[1:23:20] weekend for us Lord to be able to enjoy
[1:23:23] to be able to catch on to it and live by
[1:23:25] it Lord and so we pray that you would
[1:23:27] just anoint us Lord help us to get out
[1:23:29] of the way and all of us Lord would just
[1:23:32] turn to you and sit at your feet tonight
[1:23:34] and say Jesus speak to me be personal to
[1:23:37] me Lord give me something for this
[1:23:39] journey Lord I need it father and I pray
[1:23:41] you'll answer back we commit the service
[1:23:44] and all the weekend to you now in this
[1:23:46] dedication of this special place we
[1:23:49] commit it to you in the name of Jesus
[1:23:51] Christ we ask it amen amen God bless you
[1:23:55] you may be
[1:24:02] seated I want to speak on the Glorious
[1:24:05] freedom of the uh the children of God
[1:24:09] and I want to speak about freedom and
[1:24:11] bondage a little bit and incidentally
[1:24:13] the Lord just changed uh my heart just
[1:24:15] about an hour ago for the subject and so
[1:24:18] I just I've learned after this many
[1:24:20] years you got to obey the Lord so I
[1:24:22] don't know who this was for tonight but
[1:24:24] we just want to uh take the direction of
[1:24:26] the Lord and be able to minister and be
[1:24:29] uh just be able to give what the Lord
[1:24:31] has given us here upon our hearts so now
[1:24:33] I just want to speak about freedom and
[1:24:35] bondage and and talk about the many
[1:24:38] forms of bondage that Satan has upon
[1:24:40] people's lives because as you know
[1:24:43] there's there's not just one form of
[1:24:44] bondage there's many forms of bondage
[1:24:47] that Satan has to bind people up and and
[1:24:51] so now uh there's a there's a slavery as
[1:24:54] our brother talked about last night and
[1:24:56] I'll probably be referring quite a bit
[1:24:58] to what he said last night because I I
[1:25:01] just touched my wife in the service and
[1:25:03] I said honey if he keeps going he's not
[1:25:05] going to leave me anything to preach for
[1:25:07] the weekend because he was going right
[1:25:09] down the paths that uh some of the
[1:25:11] things that we wanted to deal with but
[1:25:13] when we talk about the many forms of
[1:25:15] bondage how many know that the Lord is
[1:25:16] able through truth to deliver from all
[1:25:19] forms of bondage all forms of bondage it
[1:25:22] doesn't matter what type it is I
[1:25:24] remember brother Bram saying one time in
[1:25:26] the prayer line he said Lord you're able
[1:25:28] to deliver from any form of disease any
[1:25:30] form of bondage anything that the devil
[1:25:33] has concocted that would be a form to
[1:25:35] bind the human being God has provided a
[1:25:38] freedom that the human being can be
[1:25:40] released from any form of bondage I
[1:25:43] remember the scripture saying that he
[1:25:45] came and he healed all manner of
[1:25:49] disease that pretty much covers it all
[1:25:51] can you say Amen it's just not
[1:25:53] physically that he's trying to heal and
[1:25:55] bring freedom but it's every form of
[1:25:58] bondage it's to set free in every area
[1:26:01] of a human being's life it's a freedom
[1:26:03] that's a glorious Freedom can you say
[1:26:05] amen and it has the power to be able to
[1:26:08] take all disease and all forms and heal
[1:26:11] and be able to set a human being free I
[1:26:13] would say safely that God sends his word
[1:26:16] in every generation for one made purpose
[1:26:19] and that's to set the people free from
[1:26:21] the bondage whether it's religious Bond
[1:26:24] bondage whether it's a bondage from your
[1:26:25] past whether it's smoking and drinking
[1:26:28] and gambling whatever it is even if it's
[1:26:30] a religious background that's got a
[1:26:32] person bound he sets free from
[1:26:35] all he sets free from all and the the
[1:26:38] unconscious slavery in bondage that a
[1:26:41] person can be in uh that's what I want
[1:26:43] to talk about as well because there are
[1:26:46] there are a there's a slavery sometimes
[1:26:48] and there's a bondage that the person
[1:26:51] can be bound by and they don't even know
[1:26:53] that they're in bondage you say brother
[1:26:55] Paul where you get that from well I I
[1:26:57] just read a scripture where Jesus said
[1:27:00] to the Pharisees and Jews you need to be
[1:27:02] set free the truth will set you free and
[1:27:04] they got offensive defensive about it
[1:27:07] and said wait a minute wait a minute
[1:27:09] we're Abraham's seed what are you
[1:27:11] talking about we need we're not in
[1:27:12] bondage to every any man and yet they
[1:27:15] were in bondage can you say Amen they
[1:27:18] were under a bondage but it was a
[1:27:20] different form of bondage oh they
[1:27:22] weren't like the world and lived like
[1:27:24] things of the world but they were under
[1:27:25] the worst bondage a religious spirit
[1:27:28] religion can you say amen and actually
[1:27:31] that religion originated in a word from
[1:27:34] a prophet Moses that they had taken it
[1:27:36] and spliced it up and changed it and
[1:27:39] added to it so much that the very
[1:27:41] message of Moses became bondage to
[1:27:44] them I didn't get as many amens on that
[1:27:47] one but they were the ones who believed
[1:27:50] the very original message of
[1:27:52] Moses and yet now after hundreds of
[1:27:55] years they were in the worst bondage
[1:27:58] that a person could be in
[1:28:01] ex but Jesus comes to set free the word
[1:28:05] comes to set free from any form of
[1:28:08] bondage and I find sometimes there's
[1:28:10] people that don't know they're bound
[1:28:13] they don't know they're under bondage to
[1:28:15] something and uh I I I I I spent quite a
[1:28:18] bit of time talking about this and
[1:28:21] talking and and researching the
[1:28:22] different forms of and there's many of
[1:28:24] these things within the message of the
[1:28:26] hour as well but sometimes it takes you
[1:28:28] to expose it and talk about it and and
[1:28:31] talk about what Satan does because Satan
[1:28:33] is the one that hides things he likes a
[1:28:35] person to hide things he doesn't like
[1:28:37] truth because truth is light truth
[1:28:40] shines light on things that people are
[1:28:42] bound by Truth uh from the prophet
[1:28:45] working in the prayer lines and how he
[1:28:47] be led to expose things that nobody knew
[1:28:49] about to expose the heart to expose the
[1:28:52] conscience the the what was what was not
[1:28:54] conscious there what was laying in the
[1:28:56] heart and truth and light came and it
[1:28:59] exposed it why would he come and expose
[1:29:02] what's laying there that's hidden
[1:29:03] because he wants to set the person
[1:29:08] free and from The Prophet's Ministry
[1:29:10] until today under this word I can tell
[1:29:13] you the end result is to take your life
[1:29:16] and many other lives and to take this
[1:29:18] word and preach truth and when truth is
[1:29:20] preached if that person will respond
[1:29:23] they can really be
[1:29:24] free EX right but it takes the word to
[1:29:28] expose it it takes Christ's presence to
[1:29:31] come through the word and expose it and
[1:29:34] so now bondage many times does not look
[1:29:37] like bondage uh there are some people
[1:29:40] you you do realize that there are some
[1:29:42] people that go to prison for doing
[1:29:43] certain things and then there are some
[1:29:46] people their bondage does not look like
[1:29:48] bonders there's some people that are not
[1:29:50] physically in prison but they are
[1:29:52] prisoners uh
[1:29:54] has anybody ever heard of house
[1:29:57] arrest uh in the states we have it maybe
[1:29:59] you don't have any here but house arrest
[1:30:01] is is a different form of somebody being
[1:30:03] a prisoner and so sometimes people
[1:30:06] they're they're walking they get to go
[1:30:07] home and they get to go to the doctor
[1:30:10] and they're walking around their house
[1:30:11] and they have pretty good freedoms but
[1:30:13] they have an ankle or monitor on or
[1:30:15] something on them and they can go to the
[1:30:17] their job sometimes or to the doctor
[1:30:20] it's restricted but you see they're
[1:30:22] still a prisoner they're still bound and
[1:30:24] and sometimes you can't tell they're in
[1:30:27] bondage by what they look like on the
[1:30:31] outside I said sometimes you can't tell
[1:30:35] if a person is under bondage by looking
[1:30:38] them at the
[1:30:40] outside sometimes you
[1:30:43] can sometimes the expression of what
[1:30:45] they're wearing and what they are and
[1:30:47] they're maybe their face and their
[1:30:49] attitude yeah that person's in bondage
[1:30:51] but sometimes you can't tell if they're
[1:30:53] in bondage
[1:30:55] and so this is where we get into is that
[1:30:57] Satan comes in Hidden form sometimes and
[1:31:00] there's some people under bondage and
[1:31:02] they don't realize it this is the the
[1:31:04] the men that we find in John 8 Jesus is
[1:31:06] telling the religious leaders you need
[1:31:08] to be set free by the truth and they
[1:31:11] said free we're Jews and we're preachers
[1:31:14] to the Jews what gives you a right to
[1:31:17] tell us that we're under bondage and the
[1:31:19] reason they said that they were in
[1:31:21] bondage to something uh that they were
[1:31:23] not aware A Ware of the reason they said
[1:31:25] that is that they did not know the type
[1:31:27] of bondage that they were under they
[1:31:29] only knew bondage in slavery as maybe
[1:31:32] someone being a slave that was a real
[1:31:35] slave that they only knew slavery to be
[1:31:37] that way but under the light of the son
[1:31:39] of man it exposed invisible
[1:31:43] bondage under the light of the son of
[1:31:46] man it exposed invisible bondage it
[1:31:48] exposed all kinds of bondage why why
[1:31:52] does God do this once again to set the
[1:31:55] human being completely
[1:31:58] free I don't know where you're at
[1:32:00] tonight but listen I can safely say that
[1:32:03] when he sends a message when he sends
[1:32:06] his presence with it and when he comes
[1:32:08] in your life even tonight if you're
[1:32:09] sitting here if he comes with his
[1:32:11] presence he's not here to just show off
[1:32:14] he's not here to just do Miracles and
[1:32:16] signs but he's here to set the human
[1:32:19] being completely free by truth and when
[1:32:23] you hear the truth truth and you respond
[1:32:25] to truth let it do its
[1:32:28] work because there's one thing the devil
[1:32:31] wants you to sit there and go out the
[1:32:33] same way that you came but God does not
[1:32:35] want that he wants you to leave
[1:32:37] different than when you came more free
[1:32:39] in your heart more free in your spirit
[1:32:42] that you can lift your hands and leave
[1:32:43] this place the burden has been lifted
[1:32:45] the chains have been broken off
[1:32:48] Hallelujah that's how he wants you to
[1:32:50] leave every church service that you come
[1:32:52] to
[1:32:54] because this is a continual work can you
[1:32:56] say Amen this is a continual work
[1:33:01] Hallelujah blessed be his name I can
[1:33:03] serve a god like that that it's not my
[1:33:06] Works can you say man but I just expose
[1:33:08] myself to his presence and to his light
[1:33:11] and he says ye shall be made
[1:33:13] free I like being
[1:33:16] free better than being under bondage so
[1:33:20] tonight I might get into some things a
[1:33:22] little bit that you may not expect to be
[1:33:24] bondages so I asked you to put your seat
[1:33:27] Bel on they didn't provide seat bels
[1:33:29] with these pews did
[1:33:32] they I would encourage you tonight to
[1:33:35] not to to listen because I may uh just
[1:33:39] list some things and talk about things
[1:33:42] that that the devil doesn't want us to
[1:33:44] talk about that causes the nervousness
[1:33:47] and causes a a person to be even amongst
[1:33:51] Believers sometimes but there's
[1:33:53] something there that's just holding them
[1:33:57] back can I get an
[1:34:00] amen there's something there that's
[1:34:03] holding them back and he wants us to be
[1:34:07] free praise the Lord so these Jews of
[1:34:10] course they were Bound By An unconverted
[1:34:13] nature they had the nature of the
[1:34:15] serpent and we knew the nature of the
[1:34:17] serpent and all of us were born with
[1:34:19] that by the way the nature of the
[1:34:21] serpent was is to have a religion and
[1:34:23] have pride with that religion because
[1:34:27] Cain the the the nature of the serpent
[1:34:30] and then coming from Cain that then we
[1:34:33] realize that he had a religion because
[1:34:35] he worshiped but he wanted to worship
[1:34:37] his own way he worshiped according to
[1:34:40] what the way he wanted to worship God
[1:34:42] has to Deliver Us From The Bondage of
[1:34:44] wanting to worship our own way and come
[1:34:47] without blood and so that was what their
[1:34:48] problem and then they had a religion on
[1:34:51] top of their serpent nature that was
[1:34:53] rebellious to the word they and
[1:34:55] reasoning with the word they had a
[1:34:56] religion that they developed off of the
[1:34:59] word of God and then a pride that went
[1:35:01] with it with that religion that caused
[1:35:03] them to not believe the truth of the
[1:35:05] hour Jesus in flesh that's bondage that
[1:35:09] they could not see what was it that was
[1:35:11] holding them back from giving their full
[1:35:13] heart to this manifestation of God
[1:35:15] before them they were Bound in Chains
[1:35:18] while they were standing there they were
[1:35:20] Bound in Chains of the the nature they
[1:35:22] were of they needed a new birth can you
[1:35:25] say amen and they needed something to
[1:35:27] change them to be able to respond to the
[1:35:29] word the Jews conception of God had them
[1:35:32] under bondage and all these points I'm
[1:35:35] bringing here about the Jews then of
[1:35:37] course would apply them to today the
[1:35:40] Jews conception of God is what had them
[1:35:43] bound it was a wrong conception of
[1:35:46] God they were not bound by worldly
[1:35:48] things the Pharisees were not bound by
[1:35:50] worldly things they were Bound by their
[1:35:53] false conception of God they were Bound
[1:35:55] by denominational ideas that taught them
[1:35:59] to be against believing this God veiled
[1:36:02] in in Christ it can't be God there that
[1:36:05] couldn't be God look at the way he was
[1:36:07] born look at all the circumstances and
[1:36:10] things that were around it their bondage
[1:36:12] was no freedom to just embrace the
[1:36:15] anointed word for that day that was
[1:36:17] standing in front of them that was their
[1:36:20] bondage and they got defensive and said
[1:36:22] we're not bound we're in the lineage of
[1:36:25] Abraham physically we came from him we
[1:36:28] are not bound to any man or Rome or
[1:36:30] anybody else and yet Jesus said I'm
[1:36:33] telling you you're
[1:36:36] bound they could say the same thing
[1:36:39] today we're Christians we tie ourselves
[1:36:42] to Jesus of Nazareth 2,000 years ago but
[1:36:46] if you're not free to believe the
[1:36:48] anointed word in flesh right now you're
[1:36:53] not fully free
[1:36:54] yet you're not completely
[1:36:57] free blessed be his
[1:37:00] name but let me speak of the depth of
[1:37:03] freedom of a human being that they can
[1:37:05] come to and they can experience in
[1:37:07] Christ I would say that we're the ones
[1:37:09] that puts limitations on the freedom and
[1:37:12] being free we only go so far and then we
[1:37:16] still hold to certain things and then
[1:37:19] I'm sure Satan would work over time to
[1:37:21] keep from many of the deeper levels of
[1:37:23] fre Freedom that you could come to that
[1:37:25] someone could enjoy that they could come
[1:37:27] into this glorious freedom and boy it
[1:37:29] was just so wonderful last night to see
[1:37:31] what were coming into and the
[1:37:32] unfulfilled part that brother Jerry
[1:37:35] spoke of that we're under expectation
[1:37:37] for a and and I believe it's coming more
[1:37:39] into that perfect love I believe it's
[1:37:42] but you see now perfect love has to cast
[1:37:44] out the fear
[1:37:46] first fear is bondage and so in order to
[1:37:50] come into something else and come into a
[1:37:52] greater free freedom and unlimited
[1:37:54] freedom in your soul in your spirit in
[1:37:58] your mind in order to come into that
[1:38:01] then we have to realize that perfect
[1:38:03] love has to cast out all things cast out
[1:38:06] that
[1:38:07] fear and then you begin to come into New
[1:38:10] Dimensions of
[1:38:12] freedom I want to be there don't you I
[1:38:15] want to grow in that so I think the
[1:38:17] freedom the sun brings is is uh
[1:38:19] unlimited we're the only ones that
[1:38:22] limited Satan is the one that limits how
[1:38:25] free you can be I just asked how free
[1:38:27] can you
[1:38:29] be how free can you be in Jesus
[1:38:33] Christ I think it's us and Satan that
[1:38:36] puts limitations on it I think there's
[1:38:39] no no no limitations I think it's to
[1:38:42] infinity and beyond I I don't think
[1:38:44] there's any limitations what we or the
[1:38:46] devil can put on it when we when he
[1:38:48] makes you free it's beyond just smoking
[1:38:51] and drinking and the things that fall
[1:38:53] all of the things of the world but it's
[1:38:55] a it's a complete freedom of worship and
[1:38:57] freedom in the heart and freedom of
[1:38:59] everything in your spirit he doesn't
[1:39:02] just stop at smoking and drinking it's
[1:39:04] beyond just habits on the outside it's
[1:39:07] free to be who you are in Christ Jesus
[1:39:11] it's free to be your identity that you
[1:39:14] find in the book of
[1:39:15] life that is our book of identity that
[1:39:18] is what's been re revealed to us and I
[1:39:21] like what the brother said that it's not
[1:39:23] the identity just of others who' have
[1:39:24] gone before or even brother bradam no
[1:39:27] that book revealed all the identities of
[1:39:30] Sons and Daughters of God and you can't
[1:39:33] help but become more free when you begin
[1:39:35] to look at who you really
[1:39:38] are it brings Freedom can you say
[1:39:41] man
[1:39:43] Hallelujah you know I was talking to my
[1:39:45] church the other day about you know how
[1:39:47] sometimes they'll have these reunions of
[1:39:49] of sons and daughters with their fathers
[1:39:51] I've been speaking about fathers a
[1:39:52] little bit
[1:39:53] and uh moving from the fathers even from
[1:39:56] the Old Testament fathers and so then
[1:39:57] we'll see somebody who they're reunited
[1:39:59] on a television show and so they haven't
[1:40:02] they did the research and they found
[1:40:03] their father and now they're going to
[1:40:05] have a big show about it and they're
[1:40:07] going to come together it reminds me
[1:40:08] even of Our Lord who uh was a young boy
[1:40:12] and he probably sometimes would look and
[1:40:14] wonder why he didn't look like Joseph
[1:40:16] he'd look in the mirror and look over to
[1:40:18] his daddy working on the uh cabinets and
[1:40:20] he looked in the mirror he says that I'm
[1:40:22] having trouble understanding here
[1:40:24] because he doesn't look I don't have the
[1:40:26] characteristics of of Joseph here and so
[1:40:29] slowly the Revelation begin to break to
[1:40:31] him and it must have really opened at 12
[1:40:34] years old cuz he said I must be about my
[1:40:36] father's business he recognized who his
[1:40:39] father really is and finally his mom
[1:40:42] telling you that this is your birth this
[1:40:43] is your life Joseph is really not your
[1:40:45] father and he begin to come into the
[1:40:48] same Revelation that you have to come
[1:40:50] into the same one brother bradam came to
[1:40:52] he says I recognize one day I'm not the
[1:40:54] son of Charles and El branam but I'm a
[1:40:57] Son of
[1:40:58] God but when they have them on these
[1:41:01] reunions that come together there's such
[1:41:03] tears and there's such joy and they get
[1:41:06] together and the first time they seen
[1:41:07] their father who the real father is and
[1:41:10] then they get together spend the new
[1:41:12] next few days and I just wonder as they
[1:41:14] begin to watch the characteristics of
[1:41:16] their father then they say Ah that's why
[1:41:19] I act that way that's why that comes out
[1:41:22] in me
[1:41:23] that's why I got a real long
[1:41:26] nose that's why my ears look the way
[1:41:28] they do cuz they look at Daddy and they
[1:41:31] start to see the characteristics and you
[1:41:33] know what it must just bring some sort
[1:41:35] of peace to them that now I know where
[1:41:38] all this comes
[1:41:40] from are you hearing me spiritually now
[1:41:43] I'm starting to get where I come from
[1:41:45] I'm looking at the word and I can't help
[1:41:47] but think that it brings more freedom to
[1:41:50] be who you are in Jesus Christ
[1:41:53] yeah that's Freedom when you're being
[1:41:55] who you are in free from man's opinion
[1:41:58] of you freedom from religion this is a
[1:42:01] freedom that you can never find anywhere
[1:42:04] except in Christ the word how many
[1:42:06] believe that the person of the word
[1:42:08] Christ you can never find this kind of
[1:42:10] freedom in the world in religion this
[1:42:13] message is not religion it's completely
[1:42:15] separate this is a restoration back to
[1:42:18] true Christianity what is this message
[1:42:21] it's a full restoration back to true
[1:42:24] Christianity that's what this message is
[1:42:26] and it brings us back to be free from
[1:42:28] any religion any kind of veils on the
[1:42:31] word you take all the veils off the word
[1:42:34] and you're seeing it properly it just
[1:42:35] brings more freedom to your life we're
[1:42:38] looking at it with no veils praise the
[1:42:40] Lord so you know how many know that the
[1:42:42] world has a miscon misconception of
[1:42:47] Freedom you know do you think a woman
[1:42:49] that's caught up in the Fashions and
[1:42:51] styles and the makeup and looking like a
[1:42:55] phony mannequin looks do you think a
[1:42:58] woman like that is
[1:42:59] free she says she's
[1:43:02] free but no she's not she's not being
[1:43:05] who God made her as a daughter of God
[1:43:08] she's Bound by a certain image on
[1:43:11] Pinterest or wherever it is trying to
[1:43:13] keep up with all that so they're Bound
[1:43:16] by another image of what they see of
[1:43:18] what a woman is to be pretty but if you
[1:43:21] ask her she can freely she's as free as
[1:43:24] anything the world has a misconception
[1:43:26] of Freedom ex right and that's why I say
[1:43:29] the word has come to set us free I'll
[1:43:31] just say this about our fine sisters
[1:43:32] here and our young girls at serving the
[1:43:35] lord and they walk out in the world day
[1:43:37] they look a bit odd to the world
[1:43:38] sometimes quite a bit to the world and
[1:43:40] they get called names they bear a
[1:43:42] reproach I always like to say thank you
[1:43:44] Godly sisters thank you young girls God
[1:43:47] bless you for holding up the image and
[1:43:49] this message the reason you do that is
[1:43:51] not because you're trying to be like
[1:43:53] Mommy and Daddy the word has restored
[1:43:56] the Dignity of what a real woman
[1:43:59] is somebody said the message came to
[1:44:02] bind women what a lie from the enemy the
[1:44:04] message didn't come to bind women it
[1:44:06] come to set women
[1:44:08] free Hallelujah it came to set our
[1:44:11] sisters free to be the blessed wonderful
[1:44:16] image that God has called a woman to be
[1:44:19] it's restored her dignity back again God
[1:44:23] bless you sisters for holding up that
[1:44:25] True Image every day in the world Amen
[1:44:29] you don't get praised enough Brother
[1:44:32] Paul's praising you
[1:44:33] tonight God bless you you remember how
[1:44:37] much God stands behind you in the
[1:44:39] moments of persecution the women's
[1:44:41] Liberation movement claims it freed
[1:44:45] women but later on some of the original
[1:44:48] members of The Liberation woman women's
[1:44:50] Liberation some of them actually come
[1:44:52] out of it and some of of them even
[1:44:53] confessed that what they said was
[1:44:55] freedom for women was actually
[1:44:57] bondage it actually got them out of
[1:44:59] their place and put them into more
[1:45:01] bondage whenever you take the
[1:45:04] world's selling of what freedom
[1:45:08] is it's going to end up in bondage it
[1:45:11] always does can you say Amen praise be
[1:45:14] to God so now there are many forms of it
[1:45:18] let me mention one that you wouldn't
[1:45:20] think but I'm going now and refer
[1:45:22] referring to the book of
[1:45:25] Galatians and uh there was some
[1:45:28] references in the Galatians
[1:45:31] to Paul saying to the men and I don't
[1:45:33] know how he noticed this but when he
[1:45:36] brought them to the Lord into the
[1:45:37] message of the day then they were set
[1:45:40] free by that message and then when he
[1:45:42] visited again something must have
[1:45:44] happened because he wrote them and he
[1:45:45] said why will you be in bondage again
[1:45:49] and he actually uses that bondage three
[1:45:51] or four times and he says bondage again
[1:45:54] yeah right why would you be back in
[1:45:56] bondage again so they were set free by
[1:45:59] the word of the hour but they went back
[1:46:02] into
[1:46:03] bondage and you know who it was precious
[1:46:07] brothers from Jerusalem yeah in the
[1:46:10] message
[1:46:12] exactly I'm going to get in trouble here
[1:46:14] I know
[1:46:15] it there were brothers from Jerusalem
[1:46:17] that come over an influence the new
[1:46:20] converts to put some add-ons to to the
[1:46:23] things they needed to do no no no you're
[1:46:25] not a full Christian yet you haven't
[1:46:27] made it yet you've got to do some of
[1:46:29] these things in order to really be in
[1:46:32] and friends that wasn't unbelievers that
[1:46:34] wasn't Pharisees that was brothers from
[1:46:37] Jerusalem in the
[1:46:40] message and what did they do they
[1:46:43] brought those new converts right under
[1:46:45] bondage
[1:46:46] again right so there are other forms of
[1:46:50] bondage that can come through sources
[1:46:51] that you won't you won't expect
[1:46:54] sometimes and sometimes you got to
[1:46:56] realize is this truth because if it's
[1:46:58] not truth then it brings bondage again
[1:47:02] the influence from another message
[1:47:04] Church in Jerusalem got them confused in
[1:47:06] their experience and they wonder how you
[1:47:09] wonder how Paul detected it that they
[1:47:11] weren't free anymore I don't know the
[1:47:12] Bible doesn't say it but he just
[1:47:13] detected you're not free anymore you're
[1:47:15] not free something's changed did he look
[1:47:18] at their body language did he look at
[1:47:19] their faces uh they didn't have joy
[1:47:22] anymore they they didn't have the
[1:47:23] freedom to worship anymore I don't want
[1:47:26] know what Paul seen but they were under
[1:47:28] condemnation they were under guilt they
[1:47:30] were acting kind of awkward to Paul than
[1:47:33] what they acted before and Paul could
[1:47:36] recognize it and when he probed he
[1:47:38] saying what's going on here why are you
[1:47:41] withdrawn in your spirit why can't you
[1:47:43] worship freely what has happened and
[1:47:45] when he when he peeled back the layers
[1:47:47] and found out the truth he found out
[1:47:49] that it was brothers that influenced
[1:47:51] back to circumcision again right exactly
[1:47:54] right I think that we must be extremely
[1:47:57] careful how us ministers handle this
[1:48:04] message because if you add to it or you
[1:48:07] put quotes together and make something
[1:48:09] new out of it what you'll do is bind the
[1:48:12] Believers up you'll bind every time you
[1:48:15] take something that's not purely the
[1:48:17] truth from this word and tie it back to
[1:48:20] the Bible by the way every time you
[1:48:23] you'll you'll set the people under
[1:48:24] bondage
[1:48:28] again but the truth will make you
[1:48:33] free praise the
[1:48:36] Lord they say that there's there's
[1:48:39] different types of uh bondage and people
[1:48:43] say they have freedom from something
[1:48:44] while really they're in bondage to
[1:48:45] something else I'm free to do what I
[1:48:47] want young people say that I I want to
[1:48:49] be free to do whatever I want but but
[1:48:51] that may be bondage too
[1:48:53] the world's freedom is highly uh cable
[1:48:55] and and Woos us into a so-called Freedom
[1:48:58] only to bring us under bondage again one
[1:49:01] writer said when we use our Liberty as
[1:49:03] an opportunity for our flesh we stick
[1:49:05] our head through the Yoke of bondage all
[1:49:07] over
[1:49:08] again freedom from discipline is a form
[1:49:11] of bondage there's a thing called
[1:49:13] intellectual bondage somebody is bound
[1:49:15] in their thinking intellectual or mental
[1:49:17] bondage results from ignorance of
[1:49:19] spiritual things when people do not H
[1:49:22] understand the purpose purpose of life
[1:49:23] and their ultimate potential they are in
[1:49:25] bondage to ignorance and cannot be saved
[1:49:28] someone can stop being saved purely by
[1:49:31] the blood of Jesus Christ because
[1:49:33] they're bind Bound in their
[1:49:36] intellect they're Bound in their
[1:49:39] thinking never going to look at it any
[1:49:41] different than what their past religion
[1:49:44] has taught
[1:49:45] them praise the
[1:49:47] Lord I believe that we are set
[1:49:50] free when Paul talked about uh this
[1:49:54] Freedom he talked about pressing on to
[1:49:57] the mark of the High Calling of Christ
[1:50:00] but just before that he says forgetting
[1:50:02] those things which are behind I press
[1:50:04] toward the mark so there's no way to
[1:50:07] press toward the mark as our brother was
[1:50:09] preaching about into this into this
[1:50:11] place that God has called to this higher
[1:50:13] place there's no way to press on to it
[1:50:16] if we live in our
[1:50:19] past it's one of my favorite subjects to
[1:50:21] talk about and maybe it's because after
[1:50:23] pastoring pastoring 35 years I realize
[1:50:27] that people can sit there still Bound by
[1:50:29] their
[1:50:31] past the past has a power over a life
[1:50:35] that Satan uses he loves to bind people
[1:50:38] in their past and that past may not be
[1:50:41] just in the world and committing a doy
[1:50:43] that might hang with you I don't know
[1:50:44] you have to accept the Forgiveness of
[1:50:46] the Lord you have to let them to wash
[1:50:48] that away but some of our past Paul's
[1:50:50] past was not in the world Paul's past
[1:50:53] just a few scriptures before he said all
[1:50:56] that I learned as a learning Pharisee
[1:50:58] and all the religion I learned he said I
[1:51:00] had to leave it all and count it all as
[1:51:03] dung that I might come to Christ his
[1:51:06] past was not smoking and drinking it was
[1:51:08] a religious past can I get an
[1:51:12] amen it was a religious past that was a
[1:51:16] wrong form of looking at God a religious
[1:51:20] past and in that religious he said had
[1:51:22] to leave all of that and when he says
[1:51:25] later on he says forgetting those things
[1:51:27] which are behind I press toward the mark
[1:51:31] you have to for
[1:51:32] forgive accept God's forgiveness and
[1:51:35] then you have to forget Lord help me to
[1:51:38] forget Paul in the scripture gives us
[1:51:41] permission to forget our past it's under
[1:51:44] the blood I don't want to think about it
[1:51:46] ever again and when Satan brings it up
[1:51:48] you remind him it's in the sea of
[1:51:50] forgetfulness never to be remembered my
[1:51:53] God doesn't remember it and I don't want
[1:51:56] to remember it it's under the blood of
[1:51:58] Jesus Christ now you're talking
[1:52:01] Freedom now you're talking Freedom now
[1:52:04] you're talking pressing toward the
[1:52:07] mark but you cannot live in both worlds
[1:52:11] cuz there's a power with your past
[1:52:13] there's a power with your
[1:52:15] future look at those people coming up
[1:52:18] the prayer line of brother brandham look
[1:52:19] at them coming up and they'd come and
[1:52:21] sometimes they come up there and he
[1:52:23] saying Vision he said the doctor said a
[1:52:26] month ago to this to you and and and
[1:52:28] sometimes brother Bradon would say now
[1:52:29] he said don't you think the god that
[1:52:31] could show me what happened a year ago
[1:52:34] is the same God that can tell me what's
[1:52:36] in your
[1:52:39] future talk about a power the same God
[1:52:42] who knew your past can forgive you of
[1:52:45] your past can wash it away from you is
[1:52:48] the same God who knows your future and
[1:52:51] there's a power in your fure
[1:52:53] future in fact your future by
[1:52:56] predestination will always be more
[1:52:58] powerful than your
[1:53:03] past somebody ought to shout praise the
[1:53:06] Lord the Lord your future as a
[1:53:09] predestinated Believer will always be
[1:53:12] the Covenant over your life will always
[1:53:14] be more powerful than your
[1:53:16] mistakes it was with Abraham it's with
[1:53:19] every son of Abraham there is no no
[1:53:22] mistake that would ever be too
[1:53:26] big for the
[1:53:28] Covenant he spoke a covenant over ab's
[1:53:31] life he spoke a covenant over your life
[1:53:32] and it covant over your life even when
[1:53:34] you were in the world that God would
[1:53:36] just had to get a hold of you there's a
[1:53:38] covenant over your life as a
[1:53:39] predestinated seat of
[1:53:42] God but you see I I'd like to elaborate
[1:53:45] on this past because it's a
[1:53:47] bondage people live there and Satan
[1:53:50] keeps them right there in something in
[1:53:53] the past and sometimes it's not what you
[1:53:55] did in the world sometimes it's within
[1:53:57] the church somebody Did You Wrong a
[1:54:00] preacher Did You Wrong somebody in the
[1:54:03] church spoke something against you
[1:54:05] somebody said something really bad about
[1:54:06] you somebody tried to ruin your
[1:54:09] reputation I told brother Jerry today
[1:54:11] when he started to talk on that perfect
[1:54:12] love I was on that series on the
[1:54:15] excellent way which is perfect love I
[1:54:17] was on a STS I spent about 6 months
[1:54:19] talking about it sounds like he did too
[1:54:21] and we haven't talked at all but but God
[1:54:23] is bringing things to the bride around
[1:54:26] the world she's taking her to a higher
[1:54:29] place it's into this Inner Room can you
[1:54:32] say Amen it's in this place that no man
[1:54:34] has hardly ever went before because
[1:54:36] God's called The Bride to it but listen
[1:54:38] now God moves you in there and God's
[1:54:41] going to for you have to realize that
[1:54:44] your past it's it's a it's a
[1:54:46] predestination for you to be in there
[1:54:49] and for God to move you into that place
[1:54:51] of perfect love
[1:54:54] and I was saying saying to him that you
[1:54:56] know as as he was preaching I preached
[1:54:58] on that excellent Way series I have
[1:55:01] never been more tested in all my life on
[1:55:04] showing Divine love to
[1:55:07] people I had some things said about me
[1:55:10] that I've never you know I just kind of
[1:55:12] lay low there in the Michigan area and
[1:55:15] just do my thing and for the kingdom and
[1:55:17] and you realize you know the devil won't
[1:55:19] let it alone you know I just want to I
[1:55:21] just want to H just lay low but I tell
[1:55:24] you the devil's he's always trying to
[1:55:26] bring something up and I was so
[1:55:28] challenged and tested and it's because
[1:55:29] our our brother said he said whatever
[1:55:31] the next place is that we're moving into
[1:55:33] is where we'll be tested the most and
[1:55:35] where there'll be so tribulation around
[1:55:37] it cuz God's moving you into something
[1:55:41] else but your past may not be something
[1:55:43] now that is adultery from the past but
[1:55:46] your past may be something that happened
[1:55:48] within this message you know we got a
[1:55:50] lot of history in this message now we
[1:55:53] got 6070 years we've got a lot of
[1:55:55] history Israel had a lot of history a
[1:55:58] lot of things went on in their history
[1:56:01] some good some bad and some
[1:56:06] ugly and we might as well admit it we
[1:56:08] got a lot of the characteristics that
[1:56:10] the children of Israel had 40 years
[1:56:12] wandering around the mountain in bondage
[1:56:16] and I was going to speak a little bit
[1:56:17] about this tonight after 40 years then
[1:56:20] God come down and said to the new
[1:56:21] generation
[1:56:23] you have circled this mountain long
[1:56:26] enough you have cycled all of these
[1:56:28] immaturities long enough and he told the
[1:56:31] new generation he actually said the old
[1:56:33] ones won't go in except Caleb and Joshua
[1:56:36] but all of those will die off but I'm
[1:56:38] promising the new generation you're
[1:56:40] going to come into the
[1:56:43] land Hallelujah but you got to turn
[1:56:46] northward you got to move away from
[1:56:49] these brothers that's holding you back
[1:56:52] so I'm ready to go forward can you say
[1:56:54] Amen what was preached this week and I'm
[1:56:57] ready to move forward and I hope I'm a
[1:56:59] Caleb I know we got some brother Ivan
[1:57:01] such a joy to see him brother Gerald we
[1:57:04] got some calebs
[1:57:06] here that is held to this word and
[1:57:10] they're going in with
[1:57:12] us a lot of preachers that are older
[1:57:14] preachers have messed up went into
[1:57:16] idolatry a lot of things we're not here
[1:57:18] to talk about that but thank God we got
[1:57:20] some Joshua and calebs here tonight
[1:57:22] and they're going they're saying to the
[1:57:24] new generation let's go let's turn
[1:57:27] northward let's get to the final thing
[1:57:29] of this
[1:57:31] message oh they had miracles in their
[1:57:33] past they had good things they had signs
[1:57:36] they shouted they had all of that and
[1:57:38] I'm not against any of it I I was in my
[1:57:41] church Sunday I was jumping around going
[1:57:43] running around the church doing a
[1:57:45] victory walk myself I love to do that
[1:57:47] but I tell you it wasn't the Miracles or
[1:57:49] the shouting that got them into the
[1:57:51] Promised Land exactly right you don't
[1:57:54] shout your way into the promised land no
[1:57:56] it's going to take a
[1:57:58] faith it's going to take getting past
[1:58:00] your fear can you say Amen it's going to
[1:58:02] take freedom to say I'm free to be who I
[1:58:05] am in
[1:58:06] Christ I want to go forward can you say
[1:58:09] that I want to finish this
[1:58:11] work praise the
[1:58:13] Lord I want to go forward I don't know
[1:58:15] if I told this last time but I got a
[1:58:17] precious brother that interprets for me
[1:58:19] in Honduras when I go his brother's Bill
[1:58:21] Sanchez from Lorraine Ohio and he keeps
[1:58:24] me going because when I go on a mission
[1:58:25] trip I'm not a missionary I admit that I
[1:58:28] don't go very often and I especially
[1:58:30] don't go too far from where I can see
[1:58:32] the golden
[1:58:33] arches I am not a
[1:58:36] missionary we have been on some trips
[1:58:38] and they asked us to go out a little bit
[1:58:39] and I'm always leer say Lord are you
[1:58:41] leading me out here because I know
[1:58:42] you'll protect me so we go out but this
[1:58:44] brother is so encouraging because he
[1:58:46] says hey you know what don't worry about
[1:58:49] it I'll get sick on the food and I'm I'm
[1:58:52] hoping for the next city we'll have a
[1:58:54] decent motel and I'm doing he says we go

[1:58:59] forward it's the only thing he gets me
[1:59:00] through we go forward brother Paul and
[1:59:02] no matter what's happening we go
[1:59:05] forward I can hear his voice in my ear
[1:59:08] right now we go forward brother Paul and
[1:59:10] I don't feel like going forward I feel
[1:59:12] like going

[1:59:18] to my wife's cooking close to my
[1:59:21] wife we go forward brother Paul and
[1:59:23] that's the only thing helped me make it
[1:59:24] through and you know we stayed in the
[1:59:27] most poorest place in Nicaragua and he's
[1:59:29] checking out a motel for us I probably
[1:59:31] told this when I was here before but
[1:59:33] it's an example of his you know anyway I
[1:59:36] I said go up and ask and he's trying to
[1:59:38] get our room at this motel and I said
[1:59:40] brother Bill ask them if they got
[1:59:42] roaches and stuff like that and the the
[1:59:44] the owner said through brother Bill I
[1:59:45] said no no no no roaches no we just we
[1:59:48] had the company come and there's no
[1:59:50] roaches no roaches whatsoever I said
[1:59:52] said all right I sat down in the lobby
[1:59:54] brother Bill's up there negotiating the
[1:59:55] price and while I'm sitting there this
[1:59:57] big roach about that big is walking
[2:00:00] across the
[2:00:02] lobby right in front of
[2:00:05] me he has no
[2:00:07] shame it's like he's strutting you
[2:00:10] know and it's like he turns back and
[2:00:12] smiles at me he walks right in front of
[2:00:16] me I said brother Bill brother Bill tell
[2:00:17] the owner look look it here's a roach
[2:00:20] right here and and and the and the owner
[2:00:22] said oh yeah yeah he leaving he leaving
[2:00:25] he
[2:00:27] leaving I said
[2:00:30] bill you know what brother Bill said we
[2:00:32] go forward brother we go
[2:00:36] forward I'm telling you friends if you
[2:00:38] don't hear anything else tonight to the
[2:00:40] Young Generation and to the calebs we go
[2:00:43] forward I want to go forward I don't
[2:00:46] want to go backwards I don't want to go
[2:00:48] to the past and I was telling somebody
[2:00:52] today sometimes when I was a kid I'd go
[2:00:54] to meetings and I'd hear the meetings
[2:00:56] and I I felt like this word was taking
[2:00:58] taking us
[2:00:59] somewhere sometimes I don't feel that as
[2:01:02] much as I used to and I want to feel it
[2:01:04] last night I felt it this word is not
[2:01:07] taking us backwards this word is not
[2:01:09] taking us back to Pentecost can I say it
[2:01:12] again this message is not to take us
[2:01:14] back to Pentecost it's to take us to
[2:01:17] something
[2:01:18] greater we want all of it we want
[2:01:20] Pentecost we want all all the
[2:01:22] restoration but it's to take us into
[2:01:24] something greater rapturing Faith Can
[2:01:27] you say
[2:01:28] Amen we go
[2:01:30] forward we don't want to dwell in the
[2:01:34] past forgetting those things Paul gives
[2:01:37] us permission to forget why because it's
[2:01:40] bondage to live in the past if you're
[2:01:43] living there tonight it's time to pray
[2:01:45] hit this altar pray in your heart say
[2:01:47] God I must forget all of those things
[2:01:50] that are behind
[2:01:53] I must forgive and forget what my
[2:01:54] brother has done to me what the
[2:01:56] preachers have said about me I must
[2:01:58] leave it alone because if I lay awake
[2:02:00] and lose sleep over that then I'm going
[2:02:02] to be bound by
[2:02:03] it I'm not useful for the kingdom when
[2:02:06] I'm sitting losing sleep over what
[2:02:08] somebody said about me forget it and
[2:02:11] move on can I have an amen toight forget
[2:02:14] it and move
[2:02:16] on it's time to move
[2:02:20] on there's such thing is financial
[2:02:23] bondage and people live in debt and
[2:02:26] people are under Financial bondage is
[2:02:28] slavery we know the scripture says that
[2:02:29] Financial bondage occurs when
[2:02:31] selfishness greed and materialism
[2:02:33] sometimes take over sometimes it's not
[2:02:35] that you just get behind and you want to
[2:02:37] do things right and you want to be able
[2:02:38] to but it can bring a bondage to you no
[2:02:41] Financial bondage can can can bring a
[2:02:43] family down and we understand that but
[2:02:46] we have a God that's able to open the
[2:02:49] doors for you to get out of that there's
[2:02:52] such a thing as emotional bondage all
[2:02:54] locked up with bitterness and fear and
[2:02:57] past abuse and past legalistic
[2:03:01] teaching legalistic atmospheres that you
[2:03:04] lived in before that bound you
[2:03:07] emotionally scared you a
[2:03:09] performance-based
[2:03:11] church is everybody listening a
[2:03:14] performance-based church maybe even in
[2:03:16] the message that are judging by the
[2:03:18] performance of how best the people are
[2:03:21] dressed and and so that brings fear upon
[2:03:24] you you never can measure
[2:03:27] up I say preach the word preach the
[2:03:30] clothes preach all of it but when you
[2:03:32] got an atmosphere that brings
[2:03:35] fear brother Jerry said it last night
[2:03:38] that law from the Old Testament that was
[2:03:40] a dispensation of fear this is a
[2:03:43] dispensation of Capstone love that
[2:03:46] doesn't mean water Dow the word can you
[2:03:48] say man it doesn't water down the word
[2:03:50] but there's something greater that we
[2:03:52] have with the word and that's his
[2:03:54] presence that's his love you can't live
[2:03:57] by the bondage of fear fear trying to
[2:03:59] live this message you can't live this
[2:04:02] message under
[2:04:06] fear has to be about
[2:04:08] Christ has to be I'm set free to serve
[2:04:12] him I'm set free to dress this way I've
[2:04:14] been set free to live this way amen so
[2:04:20] you can't have that emotional bondage
[2:04:23] from the past hanging on to you you have
[2:04:25] to come out of that you have to move
[2:04:27] from that you ha you have to come into
[2:04:29] something that is a away from the past
[2:04:33] legalistic teaching praise be to God
[2:04:36] even in Deuteronomy they took the law of
[2:04:39] Moses and they made it they made it a
[2:04:41] law brother Bram said they did the worst
[2:04:44] thing and I believe it was uh Exodus
[2:04:46] there he said that the worst mistake
[2:04:49] Israel made is to choose law instead of
[2:04:51] Grace
[2:04:53] the pure message that was come is to
[2:04:55] come with grace for you to to live it
[2:04:57] because you Delight in him you Delight
[2:05:00] in his law but when it's not a delight
[2:05:02] anymore it becomes bondage in fear the
[2:05:05] very message can become bondage in
[2:05:08] fear we need to come out of all that
[2:05:12] bondages can be in addictions there's so
[2:05:14] much that promises Freedom that is
[2:05:16] actuality brings bondage and addictions
[2:05:19] we live in addicted Society it merely
[2:05:21] transfer it into a different form rather
[2:05:23] than conquers the dependency at its core
[2:05:26] they say while they promise them Liberty
[2:05:28] they themselves are slaves of corruption
[2:05:29] it's in second Peter chapter 2 while
[2:05:31] they promis them Liberty they themselves
[2:05:33] are slaves of corruption by whom a
[2:05:35] person is overcome by him also he is
[2:05:37] brought into bondage when a behavior of
[2:05:40] use of a substance BEC com becomes
[2:05:42] compulsive despite harmful consequences
[2:05:46] it is an addiction in all of its forms
[2:05:48] addiction is ultimately bondage to
[2:05:51] yourself
[2:05:52] your flesh your Cravings addiction is a
[2:05:54] form of slavery in which millions are
[2:05:57] bound by
[2:05:59] today all kinds of addictions but we
[2:06:02] might as well give it the name that the
[2:06:04] word gives it it's
[2:06:07] slavery it's
[2:06:08] slavery rejection is a bondage Bound by
[2:06:11] the lack of faith in yourself in the
[2:06:13] word of God fear rejection complexes are
[2:06:17] bondage we could go on and on and on
[2:06:20] tonight comple is that you're never
[2:06:23] accepted you never measure
[2:06:25] up people you know uh you're always
[2:06:28] worried about what people are thinking
[2:06:29] about
[2:06:30] you you know the first 30 years of my
[2:06:32] life I worried about what people were
[2:06:35] thinking about me and then I spent the
[2:06:37] next 30 Years not caring what people are
[2:06:41] thinking about me and then they say I'm
[2:06:43] going to find out really nobody was
[2:06:45] really thinking about you what a waste
[2:06:48] of
[2:06:49] time we waste so much time in our
[2:06:52] complexes worried about what other
[2:06:53] people are thinking about
[2:06:55] us that's not
[2:06:58] Freedom what matters most is what God
[2:07:00] thinks about us come on
[2:07:03] now his you know his opinion is the one
[2:07:07] I'm most interested in am I pleasing to
[2:07:11] the
[2:07:11] Lord but you can live your life and know
[2:07:14] that about the Lord and still be bound
[2:07:16] by what people think of you you have to
[2:07:19] be set free from that amen is anybody
[2:07:22] getting anything here tonight hey the
[2:07:24] Lord told me to do this this is kind of
[2:07:26] on the Fly tonight but I'm telling you I
[2:07:29] believe this message has come to set us
[2:07:31] free from every form of addiction every
[2:07:35] form of
[2:07:37] disease glory be to God
[2:07:40] hallu Bound by unrealistic expectations
[2:07:43] of life or of
[2:07:47] people Bound by unrealistic expectations
[2:07:50] of life of
[2:07:52] people Bound by too being too busy is
[2:07:55] that a bondage no time for God that was
[2:07:59] them in Egypt Pharaoh increased their
[2:08:01] workload Same Spirit today and sometimes
[2:08:03] you don't have a choice it increases
[2:08:06] your workload working so hard but we
[2:08:08] must be careful that it doesn't C catch
[2:08:11] us in a
[2:08:12] bondage that we have no time for the
[2:08:14] Lord can you say
[2:08:17] Amen praise the Lord so we we realize
[2:08:20] that we you know God is forming us God
[2:08:24] is making us God is longing to set us
[2:08:27] free here tonight and he sent the word
[2:08:30] and I could say more about the Jews
[2:08:31] there but I think you understand and and
[2:08:33] what he said there H uh to the Jews that
[2:08:36] they didn't realize the bondage they
[2:08:38] were in these are the type of things
[2:08:40] that the Lord will show us and will grow
[2:08:42] and he'll form us and sometimes it takes
[2:08:46] many years working on us forming us can
[2:08:50] you say Amen

[2:09:32] me you know she walked right in that
[2:09:34] kitchen went right up to the right cupb
[2:09:36] and got those things down and that was
[2:09:38] it she had it like that smart little
[2:09:40] cookie but she's into this slime thing
[2:09:44] you know everything's about slime I
[2:09:45] don't know why kids like slime she watch
[2:09:48] watches video of people with their
[2:09:50] fingers and all this slime
[2:09:52] and I don't understand any of it but I
[2:09:53] do it cuz she's my
[2:09:55] granddaughter and you know so then she
[2:09:57] had some slime and she wanted to make
[2:09:59] things he said Papa you make this and
[2:10:02] I'll make this over here so I didn't
[2:10:03] know anything else to do so I got real
[2:10:05] spiritual I said I'm going to form a
[2:10:08] pyramid out of this slime and I started
[2:10:10] to form that and form it and I took
[2:10:12] about 15 20 minutes she had went through
[2:10:14] a bunch of characters and done it and
[2:10:16] then she messes it up starts again but I
[2:10:18] was going to take my time in this
[2:10:19] pyramid and really build it and it
[2:10:20] really you know what I I learned
[2:10:22] something in this time with my
[2:10:24] granddaughter with slime I learned
[2:10:27] something the more that I kept forming
[2:10:30] that with my fingers and the more time I
[2:10:34] took with it the closer and closer and
[2:10:37] nicer look like a real nice
[2:10:39] pyramid and I got a spiritual thought of
[2:10:42] it that's the Lord working on this
[2:10:45] bride the more time he has the more we
[2:10:48] yield oursel and he just takes his
[2:10:51] Loving Hands and just forms and forms
[2:10:54] and forms and he and the more time I
[2:10:56] spent on it are you listening friends
[2:10:59] this is your loving Lord this is and and
[2:11:02] if there's any bondage he's going to
[2:11:03] take it out can you say amen and he's
[2:11:05] forming this statue of a perfect man and
[2:11:08] the more I got the more man this is
[2:11:10] really looking good this is really
[2:11:12] looking nice and then Ellie comes over
[2:11:13] and looks I said look look at this
[2:11:15] beautiful pyramid and she goes like that
[2:11:18] it's gone
[2:11:21] so then I got to start all
[2:11:24] over aren't you glad he doesn't Throw
[2:11:26] the Clay
[2:11:27] Away he's the Potter doesn't Throw the
[2:11:30] Clay Away he keeps molding and making
[2:11:33] and forming us now some years ago um I
[2:11:38] read this quote quite a few years ago
[2:11:40] it's always been a help to me I know
[2:11:42] some of you are familiar with it but in
[2:11:44] this subject to challenge us
[2:11:48] tonight why am I not fully free are you
[2:11:51] fully free as a Christian in the Lord
[2:11:54] this freedom in Christ is unlimited so
[2:11:57] if there's restrictions you've got to
[2:12:00] find what the Restriction is before you
[2:12:03] can really be set free you know you can
[2:12:06] pray so hard for someone and this is
[2:12:08] what we learned in this quote you can
[2:12:10] pray so hard for someone but if you
[2:12:13] don't know the cause of their bondage
[2:12:16] and expose it your prayer can only go so
[2:12:20] far
[2:12:21] and that's not me that's from the
[2:12:23] prophet now you can pray and pray and
[2:12:26] pray but if there's a form of bondage
[2:12:28] there it will limit the freedom it will
[2:12:31] limit the answer
[2:12:33] coming and he goes into this and talks
[2:12:36] about it now I'll I'll read this quote
[2:12:39] um I didn't have a chance to give it to
[2:12:40] the brothers so you just have to listen
[2:12:42] close but I'll read this some of you
[2:12:44] have heard it before but it teaches us
[2:12:46] quite a bit and the reason I'm reading
[2:12:47] it is because it uses that scripture uh
[2:12:51] he who the son is set free shall be free
[2:12:53] indeed ye shall know truth and you
[2:12:56] understand tonight it's truth it's
[2:12:58] really only truth that will really set
[2:13:00] us
[2:13:02] free and that's not just Doctrine that's
[2:13:06] right you say truth well the serpent
[2:13:09] seed revealed and the godhead and it's
[2:13:12] not just that you know that has set some
[2:13:14] people free free free from
[2:13:18] trinitarianism free from realizing that
[2:13:20] they're from the serpent but they come
[2:13:21] from God the these truths always set
[2:13:24] people free but it's not just doctrinal
[2:13:27] truths that come to people that set them
[2:13:30] free it's all truth from God so he said
[2:13:33] many times people come to the house
[2:13:35] that's been in my meetings and so forth
[2:13:37] and they failed to get healed they
[2:13:38] wonder why then when they come in maybe
[2:13:40] there's some hidden something back in
[2:13:42] their life that they haven't done or
[2:13:43] should have done and maybe they'd maybe
[2:13:46] they'd forgotten about it maybe that's
[2:13:47] the very cause that the brother laying
[2:13:49] his hands on them or anointing them with
[2:13:51] the oil at the church whatever it is
[2:13:52] they didn't get healed listen friends
[2:13:54] you've got to find the cause before you
[2:13:56] find the Cure absolutely if you went to
[2:13:58] a doctor said Doctor I'm having a
[2:14:00] headache a persistent headache he says
[2:14:03] well take this and he gives you a few
[2:14:04] aspirins he's not a doctor he's trying
[2:14:06] to get rid of you now the only thing is
[2:14:09] that doctor if he's a real doctor he
[2:14:10] would diagnose that case till he find
[2:14:12] out finds out the cause of that headache
[2:14:14] then work from there now if you pray for
[2:14:16] some a person that doesn't get well then
[2:14:19] there's something somewhere causing it
[2:14:21] because God's Sovereign to his word he's
[2:14:23] got to stay with his word Peter said on
[2:14:25] the day of Pentecost repent every one of
[2:14:28] you be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:14:30] Christ for the remission of your sins
[2:14:32] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:14:34] Holy Ghost if a man repents and is
[2:14:36] baptized he is absolutely God is Duty
[2:14:38] bound to give him the Holy Ghost if he's
[2:14:41] repented from his heart why T why wait
[2:14:43] for a long time is because there's
[2:14:45] something here that isn't right
[2:14:47] correctly you say well maybe God just
[2:14:49] don't want to give it to me me oh yes he
[2:14:52] does you take every bit of maybe the
[2:14:54] Holy Ghost is not is only for just so
[2:14:57] many God has got plenty of it for you
[2:14:59] don't worry could you imagine a little
[2:15:01] fish about that long standing out in the
[2:15:03] middle of the ocean swimming around
[2:15:04] saying say I better drink of this water
[2:15:07] kind of sparingly because I might run
[2:15:08] out someday well that's just about like
[2:15:10] thinking God has got enough Holy Spirit
[2:15:12] for you that's right could you imagine a
[2:15:14] little mouse under the Garners of Egypt
[2:15:17] there where they stacked with a billion
[2:15:19] tons and the little mouse says why
[2:15:21] better not eat about one or two grains a
[2:15:23] day because I might run out this winter
[2:15:24] my that's like trying to think that God
[2:15:27] hasn't got Grace enough to save you heal
[2:15:30] you and he's wanting to do it to you
[2:15:32] more than you are ready to receive it
[2:15:34] that's right sure he wants to do it
[2:15:36] could you imagine all the waters in the
[2:15:38] world packed into a a standpipe about
[2:15:41] that big around and it would go a
[2:15:43] thousands and thousands of miles around
[2:15:44] the air and how the pressure of that
[2:15:47] water coming down pressing down trying
[2:15:49] to find one little CP us to get out of
[2:15:52] that's the way the love of God and the
[2:15:54] healing power is trying to pour in this
[2:15:58] meeting tonight trying its best
[2:16:01] everywhere God trying to make his way
[2:16:03] into a heart with that pressure of
[2:16:06] divine love and will and everything
[2:16:08] trying to press his way into the people
[2:16:10] if you just know the right approach you
[2:16:13] could walk right up and just receive it
[2:16:15] it's amazing how he didn't take an
[2:16:18] extreme he's trying to show the love of
[2:16:19] God trying to pour on the people to what
[2:16:22] to do to set them
[2:16:23] free so then he talks about hindrances
[2:16:26] because you got all that love it's not a
[2:16:28] problem with
[2:16:29] God but a person can have something
[2:16:33] that's
[2:16:34] unresolved and it holds back all that he
[2:16:37] says because if God promised anything
[2:16:40] and you don't receive it there's
[2:16:41] something wrong people come sometime I
[2:16:43] haven't got time tonight to go into
[2:16:44] detail I will maybe this week on a
[2:16:47] testimony but how that people come from
[2:16:48] everywhere well I failed to get it
[2:16:50] brother brandom and the lady come not
[2:16:51] Longo saying that something told her
[2:16:53] that she had Seven Devils another person
[2:16:55] told her she had five and she wanted to
[2:16:57] know where the four fourth went poor
[2:16:59] woman Plum gone nearly sat in a room
[2:17:02] taking off her stockings and pulled her
[2:17:04] feet up in the chair said I haven't
[2:17:06] eaten for several days and I'm not going
[2:17:08] to eat any anything till I find out what
[2:17:11] become of those devils and said what are
[2:17:13] they I said I don't know I'd never know
[2:17:15] anything about it said well one Minister
[2:17:17] told me uh notice now ministers
[2:17:21] yeah these were ministers who said
[2:17:23] this one Minister told me I had seven
[2:17:27] devils and the other lady Minister said
[2:17:29] I had only five now there's two of them
[2:17:32] gone somewhere now see and come and stay
[2:17:34] there about two hours in my house until
[2:17:36] God began to
[2:17:39] speak two hours nervous neglecting her
[2:17:43] home and family you've read this
[2:17:46] before what is it it's it's not
[2:17:48] something in the world it's actually
[2:17:50] being in in certain environments that
[2:17:53] gave a word of the Lord that was not
[2:17:57] accurate can I say this we better be
[2:18:01] careful when we give a word of the Lord
[2:18:03] over people and make sure that it's
[2:18:05] right exactly right because you're
[2:18:07] playing with God's
[2:18:11] people and you better be careful that
[2:18:14] you don't label something a demon
[2:18:17] because some situations it's not
[2:18:22] yeah it's easy to just label everything
[2:18:25] where your demon possessed you got
[2:18:27] nervousness so your demon possess that's
[2:18:29] a demon on you you better be careful you
[2:18:31] better make sure what it is we have to
[2:18:34] follow the wisdom of the lord we have to
[2:18:36] pray because you can pronounce something
[2:18:39] on somebody that brings bondage
[2:18:41] sometimes the rest of their
[2:18:43] lives I can't I should be getting more
[2:18:45] amens this is solid teaching from the
[2:18:48] word of God and I'm saying these two
[2:18:50] ministers did not have it accurate and
[2:18:53] they ministers that gave a word of the
[2:18:54] Lord that the was were demons and she's
[2:18:57] taken this lie remember now a lie brings
[2:19:00] you under bondage too somebody tells a
[2:19:02] lie on you the the the lady that come to
[2:19:05] the prayer in deep call to the Deep you
[2:19:07] said they're saying you're a witch
[2:19:08] remember deep call to the Deep film
[2:19:10] they're saying you're a witch that's
[2:19:11] what people are saying and she believed
[2:19:13] that
[2:19:14] lie can you give me a few more minutes
[2:19:16] tonight lies if you believe a lie that's
[2:19:19] told on you it will bring you under
[2:19:22] bondage because there's only freedom in
[2:19:24] the truth Paul said it would be be
[2:19:27] delusion to believe a lie and be damned
[2:19:29] by it in other words there's a delusion
[2:19:31] that goes with a lie that you can't
[2:19:33] freely believe the truth anymore and so
[2:19:36] he prays for this woman all these people
[2:19:38] saying she's a witch and I love it as
[2:19:39] she goes off he says go in go in peace
[2:19:41] now and he says you're not a witch
[2:19:43] you're not a witch because he's telling
[2:19:45] her the truth everything you've said
[2:19:47] they've said by the preachers and the
[2:19:48] people have said about you it's not true
[2:19:50] there's no no truth to it at all but
[2:19:52] when you begin to believe the lies this
[2:19:55] woman was full of physical ailments and
[2:19:57] nervousness because of what not because
[2:20:00] she had demons because she believed some
[2:20:03] preacher's
[2:20:05] lie
[2:20:09] brother and for this lady he said God be
[2:20:13] to speak and I said lady you come from L
[2:20:15] St Louis she said how did you know that
[2:20:18] I said your husband's on the police
[2:20:19] force she said how'd you know that said
[2:20:23] you used to be a lovely housekeeper she
[2:20:24] said that's right I said recently your
[2:20:26] house looks like a hog
[2:20:28] pin said that's right I said your
[2:20:31] daughter's over there now taking care of
[2:20:32] your husband said that's right who told
[2:20:34] you that I just kept talking because I
[2:20:36] was in a vision and I said you went down
[2:20:38] to a little place first you went to a
[2:20:40] doctor he gave you shots yes yes those
[2:20:43] shots was called harmones yes I said you
[2:20:46] went down to a place and they told you
[2:20:48] you had Devils yes because you had a
[2:20:50] real funny feeling yes they sent you to
[2:20:53] California yeah and some man told you
[2:20:56] you had seven dadles yes you went to a
[2:20:59] woman she said you had five Devils yes
[2:21:00] and they told you to come to me yes
[2:21:03] that's right how did you know all that I
[2:21:06] said the holy spirit said so I said lady
[2:21:09] you haven't got any Devils to begin
[2:21:14] with notice how now the truth the truth
[2:21:17] starts to
[2:21:19] come and just because brother braham's
[2:21:21] gone doesn't mean the truth can't come
[2:21:24] to you friends the word is a discerner
[2:21:26] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[2:21:28] we'd all depend and love to have that
[2:21:30] gift but let me tell you something he's
[2:21:31] still here he still knows all things he
[2:21:35] knows all the bondages in our life and
[2:21:37] he can speak peace to
[2:21:40] somebody he's still here even
[2:21:43] tonight this nervousness that she had
[2:21:46] now began to release and he said lady he
[2:21:49] said he said surely you know your mother
[2:21:51] your mother went through menopause it's
[2:21:53] the menopause it's something natural and
[2:21:55] I said what do you know what do you
[2:21:57] think the harmone shots are for she said
[2:21:59] I don't know I said for the change of
[2:22:01] life that's what it is there's no Devils
[2:22:03] at all it's just absolutely it's just
[2:22:05] your condition of life and she began to
[2:22:08] relax my wife was cooking some bacon and
[2:22:11] eggs out there and she began to look
[2:22:12] through the house I said are you a
[2:22:14] little bit hungry are kind of hungry she
[2:22:15] had refused to eat but here now she said
[2:22:19] she went out and ate three eggs a big
[2:22:22] bunch of toast two cups of coffee a lot
[2:22:26] of
[2:22:29] jelly so what he said it's a breakfast
[2:22:32] like I like like this morning's
[2:22:34] brunch but she ate a lot and she was
[2:22:37] just as happy as she could be she said
[2:22:40] brother brandom are you going to pray
[2:22:41] for me and cast it away I said cast what
[2:22:44] away she said the the the
[2:22:47] thing you imagine how much your mind has
[2:22:50] concocted all these things based upon a
[2:22:54] lie that's
[2:22:56] bondage are you going to pray for the
[2:22:58] the thing I said there's nothing to Cast
[2:23:00] Away she said well I never felt so good
[2:23:03] in my life said what am I still do I
[2:23:05] said he said go home straighten up your
[2:23:07] house cook your husband a nice big apple
[2:23:09] pie about that thick and when he comes
[2:23:12] in tonight throw both your arms around
[2:23:14] him kiss him sit down get on his lap
[2:23:18] tell him you love him and live like a
[2:23:20] lady ought
[2:23:21] to that's exactly that's all there is
[2:23:25] you see all the pouring on of oil all
[2:23:28] the Stomping all the kicking all the
[2:23:32] loud hollering wouldn't do a bit of
[2:23:35] good it's the truth that sets you
[2:23:39] free and he uses that scripture in an
[2:23:42] incident like this which is allows us to
[2:23:45] say it's not just doctrine that he sends
[2:23:47] his truth it's all truth to set the
[2:23:50] human being completely free this truth
[2:23:53] is for you tonight this truth is for
[2:23:55] every person sitting here tonight you
[2:23:57] live under our word you say well I'm in
[2:23:59] the message this not about being in the
[2:24:00] message you live under a truth of the
[2:24:02] Lord speaking that can speak life into
[2:24:05] you can speak Freedom into your life can
[2:24:08] you say Amen brothers and sisters true
[2:24:11] freedom freedom to worship freedom to
[2:24:15] dance I have been given a second
[2:24:18] chance it's a song I'm speaking a song
[2:24:20] maybe I'll sing it here in a minute
[2:24:22] freedom to worship freedom to dance I
[2:24:24] have been given a second chance I'm not
[2:24:26] going back to the enemy's Kingdom cuz
[2:24:29] I've tasted
[2:24:30] Freedom glory be to God Amen let me
[2:24:33] finish this you shall know the truth and
[2:24:35] the truth makes you free you shall know
[2:24:37] the truth it'll set you free that's
[2:24:38] right so many times sure in a group
[2:24:40] you'll find lots of people when you
[2:24:41] bring three or 400 people through the
[2:24:43] line there's many clean pure hearts in
[2:24:45] there that comes through and gets healed
[2:24:47] that's right but there's some that we
[2:24:49] have to get back and pick up the
[2:24:50] struggles the strugglings like that that
[2:24:53] fails it now we can only do that as God
[2:24:55] says do now did you know if a man that
[2:24:58] was given power or faith not power not
[2:25:01] himself to do it but faith in God to do
[2:25:03] it to cast out an evil spirit and would
[2:25:05] do it outside of God's will would get
[2:25:08] himself in trouble there's another
[2:25:10] element of Truth there that man can get
[2:25:13] in trouble with God if if if he goes to
[2:25:16] try to cast a spirit out and do
[2:25:18] something outside of the will of God God
[2:25:21] that's why we have to be so
[2:25:24] careful why is he saying that that devil
[2:25:27] has a right to stay right there until
[2:25:29] the truth exposes something hidden or
[2:25:32] unknown or confession comes you cast out
[2:25:35] the devil but the person has not been
[2:25:38] set free
[2:25:41] yet if there is a devil there you cast
[2:25:44] it out but they haven't been set free
[2:25:48] because something else is bonding them
[2:25:49] binding them
[2:25:52] as as we close tonight I want to look at
[2:25:54] Jesus statement a slave or a servant
[2:25:57] will never stay or permanently be a part
[2:26:00] of the family of the house if they stay
[2:26:03] in bondage of any kind any bondage will
[2:26:07] limit you from the full Kingdom and
[2:26:09] that's what Jesus said a slave or a
[2:26:10] servant in a house he doesn't he's not
[2:26:13] going to stay there forever CU he'll
[2:26:14] probably get traded he's going to go to
[2:26:16] another house he's never has the same
[2:26:19] privileges in the house as a son and
[2:26:21] daughter does so a slave is in the house
[2:26:24] but he says if the son if we can just
[2:26:27] maybe read it again the way he says it
[2:26:29] whosoever commit he said verse 35 in
[2:26:31] chapter 8 and we're closing the servant
[2:26:33] abideth not in his house forever but the
[2:26:35] son abideth forever all right so a
[2:26:39] servant doesn't abide in the house
[2:26:40] because he's not a son but then he says
[2:26:43] if the son therefore shall make you free
[2:26:46] ye shall be free
[2:26:48] indeed so now now you may have slavery
[2:26:52] you may have come from slavery you may
[2:26:53] be in bondage as our brother preached
[2:26:55] last night that they had a slavery
[2:26:57] mentality even in the children of Israel
[2:27:00] I thought about last night 400 years of
[2:27:02] bondage that was stuck in their minds no
[2:27:05] wonder after 40 years they still got a
[2:27:07] slavery mentality because it takes a lot
[2:27:09] to burn that out of their mind until
[2:27:11] Joshua and Caleb rise to the cun can you
[2:27:14] say amen and and God's so so
[2:27:16] disappointed in the the confessions that
[2:27:18] are and and you know the Young ation I
[2:27:20] want to say don't be discouraged by all
[2:27:22] sometimes you hear all the stuff and all
[2:27:24] the drama and and that it can discourage
[2:27:27] young people don't get your eyes on all
[2:27:29] that movement and what's going on get
[2:27:31] your eyes on Christ amen because the
[2:27:34] Bible says those young people it
[2:27:36] discouraged their heart when they came
[2:27:37] back with K cadis barnea they said we
[2:27:40] can't do it these were brothers that
[2:27:41] were saying we can't go that far
[2:27:44] thankfully an older brother Rises and
[2:27:45] say wait a minute we're more than able
[2:27:47] to take the land to try to encourage the
[2:27:50] new generation we're more than able to
[2:27:53] go into this third pole we're more than
[2:27:55] able to go into this
[2:27:57] land it takes courage it takes
[2:27:59] statements of Faith confession can you
[2:28:02] say
[2:28:03] amen amen it encourages someone else I'm
[2:28:07] here to do that I'm here in Newan for no
[2:28:09] other reason but to encourage you let's
[2:28:12] go forward can you say Amen we go
[2:28:14] forward praise the lord we don't care
[2:28:17] about the roaches coming across the the
[2:28:19] lobby can you say say Amen we go
[2:28:21] forward but you see now he he said he
[2:28:24] the son who's if you're in that house
[2:28:26] you probably have to go to another house
[2:28:28] but if the son comes to you and says I'm
[2:28:32] the son but I'm going to grant you your
[2:28:34] freedom as soon as he grants that
[2:28:38] freedom you can stay in the house
[2:28:41] forever and that's the only thing that
[2:28:43] changes is when the son makes contact
[2:28:45] with you brings your out out of your
[2:28:47] slavery and says now you've been set
[2:28:50] free by the son so you can stay you're
[2:28:52] in his kingdom you'll never have to go
[2:28:54] again you can stay you can
[2:28:57] stay amen doesn't matter how old you're
[2:29:01] getting you can stay we'll keep
[2:29:04] you we're keeping brother Barry so we're
[2:29:06] keeping you a lot of the older ones were
[2:29:10] keeping he who the
[2:29:12] son is sets free you can try to get it
[2:29:16] any other way but when he the son of man
[2:29:18] sets free you have truly been set free
[2:29:22] you don't have to go back to any
[2:29:24] bondage and I think of those young
[2:29:26] people latching hold of that what Caleb
[2:29:27] said and that new generation said we're
[2:29:29] going to go forward we're going to take
[2:29:31] this thing the whole book of Deuteronomy
[2:29:33] is to the new
[2:29:35] generation I'll speak a little bit more
[2:29:37] about it in the morning you look at this
[2:29:39] transition look what's taking place the
[2:29:41] calebs that are here the Young
[2:29:42] Generation here God's doing something
[2:29:44] special in this church God's doing a
[2:29:47] special transition it's a very
[2:29:49] respectful transition I've watched it
[2:29:52] from a distance I've I've kept in
[2:29:53] contact and watched these things God has
[2:29:55] done something special among you because
[2:29:59] if God terries he's got some young
[2:30:01] people he's raising up and there's a
[2:30:03] connection holding hands with the old to
[2:30:05] the new can you say amen and say we're
[2:30:07] going to take the rest of this land
[2:30:09] we're going to go into our full
[2:30:11] promise and we're going to do it with
[2:30:14] all of us can you say
[2:30:15] amen he who the son sets free ISE free
[2:30:21] indeed can you say amen I tried to get
[2:30:23] my granddaughter out of she was sent to
[2:30:26] the corner she got in
[2:30:28] trouble the other day so she was in the
[2:30:31] corner had to be quiet I don't know if
[2:30:33] you do that but her parents do that
[2:30:35] grandparents don't like it we don't like
[2:30:37] any discipline that you parents are
[2:30:39] doing so she's in the corner and she's
[2:30:42] you know looking real sad and I I went
[2:30:45] over I said you got in trouble and I I
[2:30:48] knew I'd like to get her out of the
[2:30:49] corner but I couldn't so you know I did
[2:30:51] I went and sat in the corner with her
[2:30:54] you know she's she's in bondage so I
[2:30:57] just like
[2:30:58] Jesus I I sat with her till she could
[2:31:02] get out of bondage and I sat down there
[2:31:04] right in the corner this much as I could
[2:31:06] fit in
[2:31:07] there and I said honey you know what can
[2:31:11] we do you're so sad I can't get you out
[2:31:14] but we could do something you want to
[2:31:15] play toys or no I'm just no I don't want
[2:31:17] to do papa no I said do you want want to
[2:31:20] sing Jesus loves the little children all
[2:31:23] the oh papa don't sing that no no don't
[2:31:26] sing that she want to
[2:31:28] sing you want you want to sing I've been
[2:31:32] touched by a fire she sings all these S
[2:31:33] I tried all of them I said how about how
[2:31:36] about the song bright in the corner
[2:31:38] where you
[2:31:40] are I got a song for everything you
[2:31:43] know she didn't know that one but she
[2:31:45] didn't want to sing I thought that was a
[2:31:46] perfect song you kids that's a special
[2:31:49] song you need to learn that for when
[2:31:50] you're in the corner bright in the
[2:31:52] corner where you are brighten someone
[2:31:57] all right
[2:31:59] well hone you just got to stick with it
[2:32:02] stay here I know you're sad but you're
[2:32:04] going to get out of this you're going to
[2:32:05] get out of this I was encouraging her
[2:32:07] and actually because I was there because
[2:32:09] Mommy and Daddy were watching from the
[2:32:11] couch she got out earlier because I was
[2:32:16] there your heavenly father knows the the
[2:32:20] bondage that you're in and he doesn't
[2:32:22] want you to stay there he's here tonight
[2:32:25] to minister to you whatever that you say
[2:32:28] well I I don't even know what it is
[2:32:30] brother Paul I I and and the reason the
[2:32:32] Lord switched this tonight I just I I
[2:32:35] felt today something that just speak
[2:32:38] about nervousness speak about a bit of
[2:32:40] instability God doesn't want you to be
[2:32:43] bound by being
[2:32:47] nervous God has a bomb in Gilead to calm
[2:32:50] your
[2:32:50] nerves there's a lot going on in the
[2:32:53] world but I don't know why the Lord T me
[2:32:55] this direction but I pray it ministers
[2:32:57] to every one of you here tonight he who
[2:33:00] the son sets free he sets free indeed
[2:33:02] truly he knows about the B you say I
[2:33:05] don't even know what it is I talked to a
[2:33:07] sister the other day uh one of our
[2:33:08] ministers wies she's going through her
[2:33:10] hard time she said what is it can we
[2:33:11] talk about I said I'm not a prophet I do
[2:33:13] I don't know but God knows the core the
[2:33:17] cause of it and so we just kept talking
[2:33:19] we talked about things and she begin to
[2:33:21] settle down because if you just keep
[2:33:23] sometimes if you keep talking you keep
[2:33:25] ministering they keep being open
[2:33:27] sometimes the devil gets
[2:33:28] exposed and they starts to feel free in
[2:33:30] their heart but even if you don't know
[2:33:32] tonight you need to rest that God knows
[2:33:35] all
[2:33:37] things he's he's aware of All the
[2:33:39] nervousness he's aware of all the things
[2:33:42] that hold you back but I
[2:33:46] think that ye shall know the truth
[2:33:50] and the truth shall set you free there
[2:33:53] is unlimited Freedom that God gives a
[2:33:57] human being if they'll respond to him

[2:37:15] a van and uh I watched my dad go into
[2:37:19] places and God used them in a certain
[2:37:21] way and uh I think some of those
[2:37:24] churches were so starchy they were
[2:37:26] messes churches but they were like a
[2:37:28] Catholic Church going in there they're
[2:37:29] like a Methodist church and they looked
[2:37:32] like they hadn't worshiped freely for
[2:37:34] years and my dad would go in there and
[2:37:36] start bringing that word and then he'd
[2:37:38] say a little something here say and I

[2:54:20] righteousness she is mine nothing we can
[2:54:24] do can stop it amen you know as he was
[2:54:27] talking about that it struck me that
[2:54:28] song about he's in the house because
[2:54:31] remember what the scripture says it says
[2:54:33] that which maketh manifest is
[2:54:37] light now brother Paul I think you
[2:54:39] probably stepped on some toes at moments
[2:54:41] here
[2:54:42] tonight not
[2:54:44] because so often see Satan hides in
[2:54:47] shame
[2:54:49] he hides in
[2:54:51] Secrets he hides in the idea that I'm
[2:54:53] the only one that's dealing with this
[2:54:55] when I talk to our young people I say do
[2:54:58] you know how many people have already
[2:54:59] suffered with this that are suffering
[2:55:01] with this even today some of us as
[2:55:03] adults amen there is nothing new Under
[2:55:07] the Sun there's nothing you can say that
[2:55:10] God hasn't already delivered from Paul
[2:55:12] said such were some of ye and they had
[2:55:16] filthy dirty nasty
[2:55:19] lives and then he says you know what I
[2:55:22] was worse than all of you cuz I had a
[2:55:24] religious spirit and didn't know it he
[2:55:27] can save you from the right wing he can
[2:55:29] save you from the left wing he can
[2:55:30] deliver you from anything you're under
[2:55:32] tonight and he can bring you into the
[2:55:34] Glorious light of this word
[2:55:38] amen he said you have to find the cause
[2:55:41] before you can find the Cure that takes
[2:55:43] an honest heart before God Amen we can't
[2:55:46] listen to services like this and say oh
[2:55:48] that's for him that's for her no Lord
[2:55:52] where's my blind we where's my blindness
[2:55:54] where's my weakness where's that spot
[2:55:56] that I haven't seen yet you I was
[2:55:58] talking to brother Joe and we were
[2:56:00] talking just as we were going to him
[2:56:01] from Brother Jim's Hospital there his
[2:56:04] room and and we are talking about while
[2:56:06] Jesus was talking to the disciples the
[2:56:09] scripture says they had no understanding
[2:56:11] of what he was talking about he told
[2:56:12] them what was going to happen they
[2:56:13] didn't recognize it it went on they were
[2:56:15] in the presence of the revealed word and
[2:56:17] had no clue it was about and he asked me
[2:56:19] the question he says how much are we
[2:56:23] missing how much are we
[2:56:26] missing message
[2:56:29] Believers that's not what get that's not
[2:56:31] what takes us in is being a message
[2:56:33] believer it's having the light of the
[2:56:35] Living Word In Your Heart by the new
[2:56:38] birth which is the baptism of the Holy
[2:56:40] Spirit and then it makes that word live
[2:56:43] and then what happens is as we're going
[2:56:44] to sing this song when he comes in you
[2:56:47] know we we we have that other song when
[2:56:49] Jesus comes the tempter's power is

[2:56:55] sin and fills the life with
[2:56:58] Glory he makes the difference the Living
[2:57:01] Word in your life personally makes the
[2:57:05] difference church I've had religious
[2:57:07] Spirits I've had demonic spirits and he
[2:57:10] has delivered me from them all you know
[2:57:13] what I may come under certain things in
[2:57:15] my faults and failures but he'll deliver
[2:57:17] me from from them all if I can only by
[2:57:19] the preaching of the word under the
[2:57:21] mirror of the word say it doesn't
[2:57:23] reflect his Perfection so Lord will you
[2:57:25] change me into his Perfection oh it
[2:57:28] takes a heart that says I need him in
