[Applause] [Music] amen praise the lord just think when we've been there 10 000 years well we when we oh praise the lord when we get there will be no time we won't consider years not by any means or days or weeks or months no thank god for that time when when time will be gone that's right we won't have to consider we won't need the clock amen so brother matthew be glad for that amen all these things and won't need no calendars thank god and uh just you can rest in peace sisters because you're you're gonna be young forever amen no i don't think they've been well i don't think there'd be much there in gray hair for sure and uh our brother chad can be encouraged there'll be no ball heads amen praise the lord amen yes amen praise the lord just saying we're we come from that place we're going back to that place amen and what we're seeing is it just testifies a man that fell fell from eternity into time but praise the lord we're going back from time into eternity amen and what we're experiencing in our flesh physically just testifies of the the fall of man amen what happened to me in the beginning right back in the in the book of genesis but thank god oh brother when man fell he didn't fall without hope amen because there was a blessed hope that we're going to come back again oh that's wonderful and brothers ever since just for about 6 000 years now man's been pressing on with that hope amen what for to go back to go from time back to eternity praise the lord and just think man went for 4 000 years when it comes to the jews amen pressing on to eternity but then brother god brought god brought in the gentiles amen and we're pressing on to eternity and just think we're getting closer when we consider the hour we're living in now we consider what god has done yes but when we consider what god's doing then we know we're closer to eternity amen and just think that what god has done and do and and is doing for us that soon that's going to be turned back to the jews amen and when we do praise the lord the gentiles step from time to eternity amen and god is that's the truth god is going back to the jews and we consider that it was in 1948 when the angel of god appeared to the prophet and commissioned him he was ordained to do this he's ordained to do that and so on brother and what for it was to the calling out of that gentile bride by the grace of god but finally everything would go back to the jews amen it would leave the prophet leave the gentiles and go back to the jews when god is finished with you and me god is finished with us and just saying 1948 that's when the angel came down to the prophet it was in 1948 was was that the world was beginning to recognize that the the the jewish nation amen israel oh yes so brothers just show that it was god with the prophet it was god yes god with the gentiles it was god with the jews god with the gentiles he was ordaining a prophet amen to bring forth and restore what god had ordained amen in the scriptures to give us the faith to get out of here amen and also god promised to go back to the jews amen and restore the jews to god be the glory so it's like somebody one time and there was a certain church they belong to denominational church but recognizing my ministry and and some of the things that we were preaching and teaching and he just said brother i just want to ask you a question concerning israel and he said what is god doing with israel and why is this happening to israel why is that happening to israel and so on they said you wanted to understand you know would the jews come to the revelation of jesus come to the revelation of of christianity and so on and i said oh yes i said god's going to close down the gentiles gentiles and he's going back to the jews and brothers 1948 when god ordained a prophet to come to the gentiles with the revealed word to give us the faith we need for the resurrection for the rapture amen at the time brother god was restoring israel back amen to get the world to recognize israel by the grace of god amen so there's things that we could get in there and show you what god was doing in 1948 among some certain jews and show you what god was doing in 1948 among the gentiles amen god was getting to close down the gentile dispensation amen he was getting to renew the jewish dispensation amen praise the name of the lord because hey brother it's all promises here in the word of god well yeah this the bible says god's going to do this god's going to do that brother c this is this wonderful book thank god for the revelation amen of genesis to revelation but in the beginning god started his plan he had a plan he had a purpose and he had a pattern amen it's not just accidental oh well i created man but the devil got in there and oh it caused me in the fall well if i tell you this he the devil wouldn't have done it without god god allowing it amen but god created this great created this but he knew what was going to happen so he permitted it because he wanted to reveal himself amen reveal his nature reveal his character amen and also to bring out your nature and your character amen to really love him for himself amen not to just say oh i want jesus because he uh i was a sinner he saved me no no it's gotta be based on love love is thou me more than these amen so i pray the grace of god amen that's what god's bringing it in your heart considering what god has done for you and is doing for you and what god will do brother what's to do what's it bringing out it's bringing out a relationship of love amen you love him he loves you by the grace of god see god in the genesis when he in the beginning god created this created that he had a purpose he had a pattern he had a plan nothing is accidental just god did it oh that old devil he got in there look what he did look what i got to do now well god knew that before it happened god god god was going to permit it he knew when he when he created man when he created the heaven and the earth and he created even when he created the angels oh yeah in heaven the devil was one of them and god knew what the devil would do because the bible says because satan he said you walked up and down in the coals of fire you walked there you walked there oh yeah he was one of those covering cherubs in glory amen but again he fell and again god permitted it for a reason and now brother that was the beginning but now we're in the end amen and like i said considering the word of god faith comes by hearing the word amen amen by hearing the word of god and i said well look at the faith that the word gave to the devil so what's what kind of faith has it given you we gave the devil faith yeah because the bible says satan has come down with great wrath knowing and i already know it by the word knowing his time is short well brother if he's coming up with great wrath we ought to look up with great love amen knowing that we're we've come to the end of time amen and we're moving on into the resurrection the rapture amen praise the lord brothers and sisters understand this again don't think that oh well all those evil ones are going to be put into the lake of fire and they're going to be there for eternity no they're going to spend their time in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone amen oh yeah so again we were all we were for years we were understood that hell was eternal well no no l is not eternal no there's going to be an end to it and the scriptures there to prove that oh yeah or they'll have their time and their time in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone amen brother so but by the grace of god the seed of god or they're not going there they're going to eternity we could go to revel the book of revelation and bring out those things amen thank god praise the lord brother there when it comes to his sons and his daughters now there's none of them going to be lost no and why because god the bible says god's not willing that any should perish amen it's because god what god give a good man a choice in the beginning god's given us a choice right on down through the ages choose you this day whom you will serve amen i was going to bring some thoughts on leadership so choose this day who will lead you yeah choose this day the anointing that will lead you choose this day concerning the thoughts and the ideas that's going to lead you and control you brother because i tell you there's not one of the earth but amen there's some power there's some anointing there's some thoughts that are that that's that's leading them why are you doing what you do today why are you here today it's a choice and you why you're oh well i made a choice to do this yes but it was leadership amen is either god's leadership or the devil's leadership amen and remember again satan is religious but he's not spiritual amen so we pray the grace of god we're spiritual and following god's leadership amen not satan's leadership but god's leadership amen so the lord bless us as we get into the word and pray the grace of god be with us and give us a greater and greater understanding concerning leadership amen and oh yes let's make our calling and election sure to make your calling election sure you've got to make sure the leadership you're under amen praise the name of the lord so what leadership brought you here oh well i believe god brought me here i hope it was if your motive is right your objective is right god brought you here amen but your motive is not exactly the way it should be and your objectives are not in life and not the way that it should be it's not god it's satan oh just don't because why because i tell you this there's there's three kinds of believers there's the unbeliever the main believer and the believer and the prophet of god said there he said they're in the same church he said it when he said when the doors were open he said that he said they're coming to the church so i pray god we're believers amen not make believers definitely not unbelievers so god help us to be true holy ghost filled believers amen believing the word believing the promise of god believing the oh yes we believe the plan of god the pattern of god and the purpose of god so is god working out his purpose in your life amen now satan oh yeah satan can you he'll bring you to religion and bring religion to you and he'll make you feel that you're you're you're you're good and you're religious and so on no we want to be spiritual we want we want to have a relationship with god amen we want to express our love for god and we want to experience god's love for us by the grace of god amen so the lord help us as we go into the word again today concerning leadership and trusting that we're under god's leadership not satan's leadership because satan can deceive you to the point you think make you believe you're under god's leadership but you're under what well you're under god all right but not the god not not our heavenly father but the god of this world and that's the devil amen why because satan is satan god is influencing the churches satan is influencing government satan is influencing man yes exactly that's why they can go over and they live this and do this oreo and still think they're christians but not consider lining up with the word oh i just believe in god so does the devil oh i believe in jesus so does the devil oh yeah so much said who was the one that met jesus on the mountain it was satan oh yeah he tempted him do this do this do this amen he knew that jesus could do it but he knew it wasn't it wasn't the will of god he was tempting jesus to do something contrary to the will of god and brothers he works on he works on many today amen and he works on you works on me what for they get us to do something that's contrary to the will of god oh yeah we'll still believe we're christian still we believe that oh we're the seed of god and so on but then go over and do this go to do that and it's contrary to god's will god help us brother amen so the lord bless us amen let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible only believe only believe all things are possible oh

possible now i believe amen the lord bless you turn with me to the book of jude just there before the book of revelation amen and we want to read beginning with verse verse 5. maybe we should get start with verse 1 in the book of jude it says jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called amen we're here because we're called and says mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied amen so grace of god to provide mercy peace and love and that it would be multiplied in our lives amen more and more appreciating and recognizing amen salvation in mercy salvation and the peace of god amen and the love of god and verse 3 beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith amen is not a form of godliness or former religion amen but it is our lives and we earnestly contend for the faith so are you here because of an earnest spirit an earnest anointing amen in your life because you want more of god you want more of his word amen praise the lord and you want more faith to please god so that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints not a form of godliness amen not by any means but it is the earnest desire in you to get more faith amen and to get from time to eternity we want to get into eternity not just thinking well well just wait in the lord to do this the lord do that no god has given us the revelation to create in us to hunger and the thirst amen to hunger and thirst for god i'm going to thirst for the things of god and you will be filled amen amen and it says for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ amen religious but yet not spiritual amen we want to be spiritual amen if you've got a religious spirit let's move on till we become more and more spiritual in our relationship with god more and more spiritual in our relationship with one another amen so we're not dealing with religious people we're dealing with spiritual sons and daughters of god and it says turning it says turning the grace of our god into retributiousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ amen this is make believers and he said i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this now that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not amen thinking maybe that god would save them all but brother he brought them out yes and in the wilderness he proved who was sincere he proved he was true seed and who was not true seed amen and after he brought them out he destroyed them that believed not but brother he brought out their unbelief before he destroyed them god's not going to bring you up just just kill you no no no no god's going to bring out what's in you he's going to put you to the test and he's you're you're going to go through this test you're going to go through that test amen in the life that you live praise the lord brother i tell you this when i first came to the to the lord as i said it was in a in a salvation army church in my hometown of gamble and as i said i was i was sitting in in in a pew and there was some sisters behind me and one of them was my mother and uh of course she was a christian and there was also another sister there and i always remember her amen and of course she looked down and she saw me and she and she sensed that i was i was crying a man i was just a young boy and i was crying and and oh just crawling and calling on the lord and i remember now that she just reached down and she touched me on the shoulder and and then i i thought maybe it might have been my mother i turned around it was her and she said gerald i said yes she said son she said go to the altar she said you need to go to the altar i said thank you okay amen i went to the altar amen and i laid down there by the altar and i cried and i prayed and cried and prayed amen oh yeah and and the audience in the congregation everywhere they were singing and singing and singing praising the lord amen until finally i got up and i stood there and with my hands raised and the clergy looked down he said son he said what happened to you he said what did you do i said thank god he said i said brother i said thank god i said i'm saved and he said wonderful he said praise the lord amen and they all began to worship and praise the lord amen so that was many many many years ago i guess it might it might have been maybe uh yes over 60 years ago it was that long i said yes that long amen because at that time we were still living in that in that town of gamble amen it was in 1960 that we moved out and moved in here to st john's the family and so on so by ever since i've been growing and maturing sure i've fallen i've got up again and moved on fall and get up again amen but you're getting closer to the lord amen amen amen amen as it is in natural relationships with children and parents amen well yeah oh yeah if the mom and dad is going to correct you you're going to get closer not further away oh it brings you together amen because mom and dad is concerned and they want you to do this they want you to do that because why they they're concerned they they want you to to be good amen amen and knowing that if you did this did this god bless you amen through god be the glory praise the lord amen so it's a long time ago over 60 years ago but i gave god the glory that i'm still here after all this time that brother journal would be still here and then maybe the i guess i'd assume i'm the oldest here in this assembly hard to believe yeah it is hard to believe because i always thought that that brother over there was the oldest that when i s in central newfoundland oh brother cater he's the oldest no or brother emmanuel they're oh they're just old oh no back then they're only maybe for me they're only in their 40s and 50s amen where am i now brother let's let's look up amen i tell you even it's hard to believe as i said that even that the the ones that i minister to as young boys and girls amen you're getting old now yeah sorry but that's it's a reality you've got to face where's our brother jonathan here like i said when he was two years old sitting on that chair in in the church and i was preaching to him amen or or our brother matthew here and and and oh my just consider the the children here that i dedicated amen my oh my oh my lord i said where's time well let's tell you this we're getting out of time into eternity please in the name of jesus don't take your don't take your age for granted thank god amen thank god that you're here thank god you're believing the word amen thank god that we have these young people here and like i said i bet we've had an uh sometimes a number of visiting ministers they come and minister for us and and they're they were surprised to see these young people here oh yeah and they they reminded me of it this is this is amazing he said to see this many young people in this church said yeah well he said thank the lord he said amen because those preachers have been to many churches and maybe even big churches and and not even not see very many young people amen but thank god for what he's done in their arts and what he's doing in their lives amen to god be the glory that he'll keep working through the ministry that he'll keep working through mom and dad and grandma grandpa amen to god be the glory amen god help us brother that by the grace of god he god as he did when it comes to in israel and egypt he brought him out but destroyed them that believe not brother and i know that over the years there's many as that many started out but went back yeah they went back as i said when i was in a in a church an altar call was made and then there was a lot came up to the church and i noticed this elderly couple there and it was to two sisters and i said oh lord i said i said they need they need the holy ghost they don't have the holy spirit i said lord they don't get the holy spirit i said that they're not to stay with the word and they didn't they went back to the world all at the time they might have been maybe in their 30s or maybe 40s they're not sure how old they were but they did go back to the world so i pray god that we have the holy ghost the holy ghost brings us to the word the holy ghost keeps us in the word and the holy ghost is there to make the make us one with the word amen amen that's why the bible tells us that sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god amen sorry to keep you standing amen but verse 6 and the angels which kept not their first estate amen but left their own habitation he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness under the judgment of the great day amen even as sodom and gomorrah and the cities above them in the in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh and sent forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire amazing likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities or the glorified ones amen grace and yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a rallying accusation but said the lord rebuked thee but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves grace to us amen and woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and ran greedily after the heir of balaam for reward and perished in the gain saying of cora god bless his word you may be seated what is the way of cain the way of cain is religious but not spiritual because remember he offered he offered unto god as well as like abel offered offered us unto god a sacrifice and cain offered sacrifice but abel's was well pleasing to the lord amen but not cain why because abel offered the lamb a bleeding lamb just think but king just offered the fruits of the field the things that he grew so one was based on religion and the other one was based on the holy spirit amen one was based on you know religious ideas intellect whereas the other one was based on spiritual revelation because the bible says it is by faith that abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain amen by faith amen it was revealed to abel why because this is why abel well where did he get to maybe maybe adam and eve when they came out of the garden maybe they just told cain and abel exactly later on as they got older maybe they told them exactly what what what happened they were in the garden and this happened and god put him out of the garden but based on something that that abel had the faith that pleased god and he offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice and it was based on faith amen it was based on a revelation that god gave abel and abel believed it and abel obeyed it but cain well cain had out of faith but exactly he never had the perfect faith oh yeah because they according according to the faith that cain had he went and offered he went and offered the sacrifice of what he had grown in the garden amen and he felt that was an excellent sacrifice but brother when he went over and saw and he saw what abel had offered this is absolutely amazing this is absolutely amazing but not only that abel offered this but god honored it and god respected it amen but he didn't honor and he didn't respect canes and then brother it it caused cain and abel to get into it get into a fuss there and it was really it was cain fussy with abel amen but ava was taking his stand for what he did abel was taking his stand for the for the sacrifice that he made without a doubt he had some revelation there because brother just consider why cain and abel really really got into that argument and really began to frustrate one another as it were and mainly it was maybe cain for fighting the evil not able fighting cain because why because abel offered the right sacrifice and god accepted it amen and god honored it but cain oh he got really upset why in the world would god take this sacrifice of a slain lamb amen and a bleeding lamb there on the altar and here's it here's what cain offered on the altar and maybe you know well just abel just had a small altar with his lamb and here's king with a maybe a larger altar and all that a portion of all that he had grown in the field so why should the lord turn that down but received abel why because amen because one was based on faith and spirit but the other one was based on religion amen it was just based on the anointing oil the the k knew that something happened cain knew that they they were like adam and eve there but outside the garden and and oh well and adam and eve did something in and god put him out of the garden amen and man went from righteousness to unrighteousness and man went from being the holy sons and daughters of god to sinners amen and abel was responding amen responding because he knew that he needed to get back to god amen he knew he knew he needed redemption just think when you consider adam and eve and what god did for adam and eve when how god treated adam and eve and how the the fellowship that god that adam and eve had with god amen the bible says that they would gather together every in the cool of the day every evening and have fellowship with god amen until they sinned amen where was god god came looking for them where were they amen but they would based on their faith and based on on their love for god and the relationship they would god they would go and they they know they knew they knew that they would meet god there they they would have fellowship with god there and so on but amen but after sin that god wasn't there amen and then they realized oh my they realized they were naked they realized that they had sinned and they hid themselves from the lord god come looking for them amen brother god came looking for us through our lord jesus christ praise the name of the lord so brother grace i pray in the name of jesus that we're going to offer the right sacrifice onto the lord amen and brother it's not just religious because cain was religious but abel was spiritual amen abel's able sacrifice was based on a spiritual revelation amen of what god had done what god was doing and what god wanted him to do amen but brother keynes was based on religion oh yes he was religious sure he was he would have been considered a very religious person and no doubt you're going you could go into other churches today and you would think maybe this church or that church oh they're very religious there and they're doing this they're doing that but is it what god requires what about what god has done what about what god is doing amen but cain rejected what god did and what god was doing in abel amen yeah cain rejected that but god rejected cain so brother sister there are those that reject what god is doing in your life and they reject what god is doing in your faith amen that's the truth they'll reject that but brother sister the grace of god to show you this that god's rejecting them god never rejected what i trust by grace god's not rejecting you rejecting me and i'm rejecting our sacrifice amen that we come to offer to god today amen by the grace of almighty god amen but yet there's gonna there's gonna be millions and millions and millions out there amen that they're gathering today in in churches they're gathering in this they're gathering this way in that way amen they want to offer this sacrifice to the lord but god is rejecting it why because it's not according to his word amen is not justifying amen or what god has done what god is doing and what god will do because i tell you what what able offer testified of what god was going to do he would offer a blood sacrifice he would be made flesh and shed blood to redeem yes to redeem able back to redeem us back amen brother sister because all the way down through the old testament and they were offering the sacrifice of sacrifice of lambs and so on amen they were what they were appointing to jesus amen the sacrifice of god to redeem us back not oh yes that was just a covering for sin but what jesus did took sin away amen hallelujah just think what abel did you even that was just a covering for sin amen and what he did what they did all the way down through the jewish faith there and their faith amen their sacrifices covered their sins covered their sins but then jesus came and shedding of his blood took away sin amen hallelujah brother thank god for such a sacrifice amen do you have that sacrifice in your heart in your soul the sacrifice of the life of our lord jesus christ testifying that he laid his life down he picked it up again come back and share that life with you and me amen see now when it comes to the old testament they could lay the life of a lamb down but that the life of that lamb wouldn't come back to you no no god would honor you and respect you amen for what you did amen but giving you more faith to keep pressing on amen because when when god made his sacrifice in our lord jesus christ he amen he shed his blood he laid his life down and he called josiah and he and and he came back to share the life with you hallelujah oh hallelujah see by the holy ghost you you've got and we've got the life of the sacrifice amen he's there to bear witness the price is paid he's there to bear witness the blood was shed amen it was perfect blood it was shed brother and not just to cover our sins take away our sin oh amen take away our sin to the extent that the bible says that god doesn't know anything about it oh glory oh this is tremendous that brother according to your faith that god can look down and the devil will say look they did this they did that god said what i don't see nothing what no i don't see anything not not in that one no he sees you as a perfect son and daughter of god oh god give us that faith please lord increase our faith amen brother sister listen we got to have that faith to get out of time and into eternity we got to have that faith to get back home amen to be with the lord to be with the saints of god amen that are gone on and they're waiting for us amen and again this is why the product of god said he said they are waiting on us and god is waiting on us for the resurrection and the rapture what for to come to that faith oh yeah brother the saints of god all done through the ages as it were and after our lord jesus christ for the last 2000 years brother they laid down their lives believing in the resurrection we're going to lay our life down but praise the lord we're going to he's going to raise us back up and the dead in christ shall rise first amen brother that's what they believe but then there's another generation rising that god has given us to pay for the rapture and the dead in christ are waiting for us to come to that faith the dead in christ are waiting for us what for why because when we get that faith of the resurrection and we get that faith in the rapture amen in the hour that we're living brother as i said back down through the ages as they went through with justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and so on and to finally write it right at the end amen today was the revealed word to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen they had the faith for justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen to finally we're going on to eternity well praise the lord hallelujah say brother see that's why god started with eternity as it were but man sin put us in time god we got we got trapped in time amen but god had provided the plan of redemption amen to get us out of time back to eternity and brother when our lord jesus christ came what was he doing hallelujah he was hallelujah he what what he what he worked out he worked in amen praise the lord and now what he worked in he's working out to return to eternal life praise the lord amen god got a plan god got a purpose god got a pattern so brother through our lord jesus christ he began this to bring us back oh yeah after the fall in the garden oh well we're getting further and further and further away but then jesus came and we're getting closer getting closer back back to god back to the nature of god back from time to eternity oh we know a lot about time but whether it's getting to a place where we we won't even consider time time what time is it no matthew would have to worry there'll be no clocks no no there'll be no clocks like there's time whenever brother matthew would take the clock down yeah when we get visiting preachers here so that pressure don't have to worry about time why because he's preaching the eternal word amen oh yeah sometimes we we oh yeah we're narrowed down and narrowed down and narrowed down oh yeah so finally got to the place you know where they where they got away from the holy spirit oh my and they just had religion and to finally get into into religion and the preacher preached for a few minutes that was it yeah but i tell you every time then god sent a revival he didn't preach for a few minutes oh no he'd go on and on and on and on and on and then the next revival when they got religion and they organized oh yeah they just got down to preaching for a few minutes or half an hour or whatever and that was it but when god sent a revival come on just think that john wesley preached five times a day he did five times yeah this time when he would go to go to the mine where where the where the men were working and brother he'd be outside the mine and he preached to those that would that would that were coming to go into the mine and after after they after he preached to them and they went in then the others came out and then he preached to them oh yeah and i guess i said there's another time when he when he would go to he couldn't go into the church because the church wasn't big enough and as i said recently and what did he do to preach he he go into the he go into the the cemetery and they all gather around in the cemetery and and john wesley would stand upon upon a tombstone and preach well and he will preach for maybe a couple of hours and they all standing there praising the lord amen he did john wesley did that john wesley did it amen oh yes and again even even our even our brother william booth the the founder of the the salvation army when he was preaching and there was a time when they went and picked him up and and then they and he was he was blind physically blind and and somebody wouldn't pick no one says oh he said brother he said and he said where where have i got to go oh he said brother i got to take you over here somewhere and wherever it was and he says you got to preach he said what i got to preach yes he said they want you to minister did he study he was blind he couldn't he couldn't see physically no so they took him and they let him out to where they wanted to preach oh yeah and and he preached and preached and preached and one time he preached and he said oh and he started he started to count and he said 5 10 15 20 25 30. oh 30 30 pieces of silver he said judas sold the lord he said what have you sold them for amen he said what have you sold him for i pray god you're not going to sell jesus preeminence in your life for something that you want to do you got to follow what he wants you to do amen and brother he preached and he had again he was blind and he preached a priest and when he made an altar call like that oh he had he had maybe hundreds and hundreds in in in that building he was in and then then others would look down and say what what what's going on here why because those in the bulb in the in in in the balcony at the back they didn't go down the steps they jumped down why oh yes they just got out of their seat and they just went went to the front part there of the of the balcony and they jumped over and jumped down and ran to the altar yeah such was the conviction of the word in william booth in that hour how many of us are willing to jump down oh yeah i do say grace of god to us i remember what it was like when i was just a young boy in the salvation army oh yeah and i was under the conviction there was a time i was sitting in the front pew ran the front seat of course right right in front of me was the altar and then all of a sudden they were they were in in the the part the final part of the service and they were worshiping and praising the lord oh hallelujah praise the lord then then they begin the jericho march march they did oh yeah they all all those that they first they all gathered around the altar praising the lord their hands i can't see him now and their hands were raised up hallelujah hell yeah even from the youngest to the oldest christians that were there then then all of a sudden something does happen and then they stayed lined up and they started they started to march march oh yeah they started the march oh yeah they went went around they all went across and up up by the wall they went on out into the porch because they the porch was so big they had two two two doors and two or two aisles that you could come in to the church because it was not just these these two here there was three three sets of pews and two altars not two altars but two two aisles that and so they would they would go right down by the window and go on out the door and then go across the porch and come back in the other door and keep on going around and around and around and singing onward christian soldiers and they sing and i remember sitting in the front pew there and i had to pull my legs in what for supposed to give them room to make sure that they were going to go right on around oh yeah i experienced those things you won't find much of that going on today not just out there in those churches but even in message churches just so little amen grace of god to us amen why because the anointing is getting less and less and less amen and the number of believers is getting less and less and less yes straight as the gate narrows the way and few there be that find it god help us brother we need to come under god's leadership not man's leadership we need to come under god's leadership we need to come under holy ghost leadership by the grace of almighty god oh my brother god help us that we're under the anointing of god brother we're not like cain in the way of cain religious but not spiritual not going after the heir of balaam amen human reasoning and doing it our way but not god's way that's the era of balaam the bible says woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain amen religious but not spiritual that's the way of king oh way of cain oh cain was an unbeliever no cain offered a sacrifice but abel abel's sacrifice was more excellent if this was more excellent keynes was excellent amen so brother sister they go it says woe under them for they have gone in the way of cain religious but not spiritual brother they oppose god's way they take their way but they're still spiritual and they're not spiritual we're religious and oh yeah thank you lord you saved me i was a sinner you saved me yeah we're born in sin yeah god help us so brother grace they were going beyond when i came we're not under cain's anointing under the anointing that ablehead the holy spirit anointing amen if you've got the holy spirit anointing you're going to offer the right sacrifice the right spirit and anointing and attitude of worship is it in your heart or in your head too many got it in their head but not to hurt yeah praise the lord says woe to them that have gone in the way of cain they think they're gone in the way of cain are you kane or abel oh well i'm a believer so was king cain believed god not only that cain believed god to the extent that he talked with god amen he talked with him he had fellowship with him and not only that you know he did he said oh lord he said oh you said this you said that they said oh if i go this way now they're going to kill me. and he's afraid of this afraid that the lord said it's all right i'll set a mark on you so that nobody will kill you keep your attitude right keep your spirit right toward them but that don't mean they're saved amen why you're reflecting the right attitude the right spirit but he didn't do it he didn't have the right attitude my spiritual ward abel he killed him i believe abel had a right attitude and right spirit toward kane yeah make sure you're you're right you're in the right path and you're under the right leadership make sure you're under holy spirit leadership not religious leadership because satan is there to lead you yeah see indian even in the garden of eden see god said to adam and eve this this this this and the and the enemy came and like i said the devil was the first evangelist he was oh yes he went into he went there to the garden of eden and he started to preach to adam and eve preach yes what did he say oh he said to eve he says yea as god said amen amen brother make sure you're going to preach the truth because the enemy is going to preach it and he'll head to it yes god said but forget the butts again i'll always remember brother fulcher when brother fulcher preached there and he referred to the butts he said the butts are only for goats he says for goats yeah as god said he said but now he added to the word he added to what god said and he just added one word amen and it caused the fall don't let the enemy add anything to the word that god has revealed to you in your heart amen leave it the way god said it believe it the way god said it amen take your stand for the way that god said it amen don't add to it don't take away from it don't change it just so that you you'll feel religious but you you take away the conviction yeah no no let the word convict you let the word lead you amen so again bear with me well unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and they have ran greedily after the error of balaam human reasoning is the heir of balaam doing doing it your way not god's way yeah god would say this god said that to to balaam and balaam says oh well yes but forget the butts amen what is god's will for your life do what god wants you to do not what you want to do and you can be you can be religious and you can feel well well lord i don't think you'll mind this i don't think you'll mind that do you mind the lord i see it do you mind what god wants to do but the enemy is there if if if you're if you feel physically you don't want to do this or i trust the lord won't want me to do this i trust the lord won't want me to go here go do this i go there not my will thing be done how many i tell you brother how many are going to come to that place jesus came to how many under the stress and the pressure of life are going to humble themselves and say what jesus said amen oh yes just consider the choice that he had to make to lay down his life or to avoid it oh yeah he knew what he had to do when he came in flesh he knew what he had to do to redeem you and me and that's why he went when he prayed and he went back to the disciples they were dozing partly as late and he went back to them again and then finally oh yeah they were asleep he says sleep on take your rest yeah and jesus went back to the garden and he fell down and he said lord not my will thine be done if you get to go to israel sometime i trust you'll get to go up to that mountain where jesus was praying myself sister betty were there we did we go we went up to the mountain and of course there's a there's a fence there and you you're not allowed to go out around those olive trees that jesus preached by are not preached prayed yeah and one of the tour guides highlighted to say see this see these trees there yeah they said they were there when jesus was in the garden praying i said they were there oh yes he said he said they've been they've been looked after he said ever ever since and for years and years and years he said they're constantly keeping them oh yeah it's amazing but you're not allowed to go behind the fence and walk around it you can just stand by the fence and look look at it it's amazing and that's where he humbled himself not my will time be done is that your prayer is that your prayer today will that be your prayer tonight will that be your prayer tomorrow lord for the remainder of this day not my will lord thyme be done for tomorrow lord not my will thine be done amen does not mean he wants the will of god they say again i had to deal with a certain believer back years ago they were really upset concerning certain situations in their life they were only that person was only young and consulted and wanted me to pray and find the will of god i said brother i said maybe this is the will of god i said do you want that no he didn't want it i said maybe you maybe that's the will of god because you don't want it god's testing your faith to see if you humble yourself not my will father thing be done it has something to do with his job and he felt that he wouldn't it wouldn't be as prosperous if he if he could go do this and go do that it'd just be better i said well maybe the lord wants to test you with this i said are you willing to say not my will thing be done no he he didn't want that see we got our ideas but are they god's ideas is it the will of god for your life is it what god wants you to do it's like the brother said one time i maybe got it on tape somewhere where he was preaching some years ago and he said the biggest lies told are told in church by the hymns they sing and he highlighted the song a tent or a cottage why should i care they're building a mansion for me over there he said but they do care he said there's not many want the tent and they want the best they want the best cottage they want the best homes what's the will of god they want the best jobs they want this they want that what's the will of god there's things that i've had to deal with for years because as i have witnessed beginning your walk with god when you're young and regardless of what you what your choice is you you got to walk do this you got to do that what's the will of god i'll tell you there's not many young people consider the will of god when they're growing up they don't consider the will of god for their everyday living lord what is your will for their friendship and for this and for that what is your will lord well i'll thank god for that grace in my life no matter what it was the jobs that i've had lord what is your will and i'll let to be honest i didn't i turned to me i didn't go do this do this i and make this make that no no it was god's will well brother you you were this and you were that and it comes out there in the business world yes but again that wasn't me that was the lord and i started down here but if you if you stay humble he'll raise you up but stay humble you raise you up if you don't he'll put you back down so a tender cottage do you care i tell you this if you're if you're a christian you don't care lord is your will not mine they're building a mansion for me over there you just keep on going that and and god will bless you you say lord i didn't plan this thank you lord i didn't i didn't i didn't do this i didn't do it and there's those that are oh my they're the ones that are making the plans they're the ones that are trying to increase their money during their learning try to increase this increase that oh they want to want the best world and to live best no just take it one day at a time let god lead and god bless you oh yeah not my will thine be done probably god brought that out one time he was talking about certain brethren that they they wanted to do this they wanted to do that you know and uh to some that were real humble and that they just did this and did that and after a while god blessed them they said my how did you do this no i said i didn't do i didn't do it he said the lord did it the lord blessed me and yet though somebody else would start this and they had their plans they wanted to do this to make more money they wanted to do this get more popular and so on oh yeah and it went so far and then everything collapsed why because their motive and objective wasn't right you're more object you got what's your right motive right objective for the glory of god no matter what you experience in life lord i want it for your glory amen amen lord i'm doing this but lord if you want to bless me i thank you for it to god be the glory and again it's like again when i was partly in management in department store and i was assistant manager and the manager came out and he said except me and he said this this this how do you do this well no i said that's not me i said i leave that with the lord what i said yes i just leave with the lord because they figured out that because i want to get higher and higher and higher you know in in in a position that i would do this and i would fight for this i would put this there and do this and so no no i said i just leave that with the lord but they knew that i was there oh yeah they knew that they would trust me and that's why they would get me to do this and get me to do that get me do that i said well i said don't make a difference to me i said it's up to you oh yes he said we know but we want you to do it well i said i don't have to do it if you want to get somebody else to do it and pay them extra that's fine as you don't have to pay me oh yes he said we we want to do it i said well i'll leave it with you i should thank the lord you dealt like that with people that you work with oh yes i did yeah and i won't say that i'll leave that to to the lord grace brother sister let's not go in the way of king being religious but not spiritual let's not go on the error of balaam using human reasoning do it our way but not god's way not giving god the preeminence give god the preeminence in what you do whether it's in your home or in your job no matter what it is where it is give god preeminence see it prove you prove it that it's not me living it's jesus living in me yeah is jesus in control whether it's you in education and again as i said when i went to a school they knew that that i would only do so much and that's why they would only approach me and search certain things to get involved with with the rest of the students for this for this for that they knew that well he's he's religious and he this is what they felt that he won't do this and he won't do that you know until finally as i said one of the teachers that came to me and says excuse me i know you're going to be a pastor i said you do i said i don't know oh yes he said i think you're going to be a pastor a teacher yeah and again one time i went into a classroom and i was a bit late arriving and and the teacher said oh mr lush welcome he said just a reminder he said you're going to be late for the judgment i said i hope so but again he knew my spiritual stand that i took and i was just a student in the school but but he applied everything everything in in whatever i did he sort of applied it in a spiritual way even in school i said well thank the lord so i said i hope so and of course everybody laughed yeah and again another time it was in a religious class and that teacher was talking and talking and he asked the different ideas this idea what do you think of this what do you think of that what do you think and so he said all right i would like mr lush i would like you to what do you feel i was just one of the students there and i explained it oh thank you he said do you know he said that you're going to be a judge oh i don't know oh yes he said you're going to be a judge he said that was excellent thank you because it was a religious religious class and he had a religious question that he wanted an answer for and different and he this one gave an answer that one gave an answer and this one so on to finally i gave an answer now oh he said good thank you if you're going to be a judge to god be the glory so brother again we're exhorted to be on our guard when it comes to leadership so that we're not going to go in the way of cain and be religious but not spiritual and the error of balaam and use human reasoning do it our way but not god's way and the gain saying of korah denying god's absolute authority in the revealed word amen korah denied god's absolute authority in moses and aaron there are those that deny god's absolute authority in the ministry today and in the prophetic ministry of william branham god help us to have his leadership to follow his leadership amen turn with me to there's a number of other scriptures that i had here but i'll try to bring it to a close exodus chapter 13. exodus chapter 13. and beginning to read at verse 17. and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that god led them not through the way of the land of the philistines although that was near for god said lest per adventure the people repent when they see war and they return to egypt but god led the people about through the way of wilderness of the red sea and the children of israel went up earnest out of the land of egypt and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straightly sworn the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones away ants with you and they took their journey amen from success and encamped in etham in the edge of the wilderness and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way amen god's leadership and by night in a pillar of fire he said to give them light to go by day and night and he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people god's leadership by the cloud god's leadership by the pillar of fire amen in which we can identify god's leadership today in the cloud of angels and in the pillar of fire praise the name of the lord the cloud of angels and the pillar of fire as the the prophet said there he is he said looking down at us referring to jesus christ in the cloud amen and the pillar of fire amen and again as the problem god did say he said anybody looks at that picture and he said if you don't if you only see the pillar of fire it's if you don't if you see anything other than the pillow fires you're not you're not seeing the picture right yeah so he said if you look at it and all you see is the bill of fire you're seeing the picture right don't notice he said him william branham but i should see the pillar of fire amen and it was number of years ago now that the man that took this picture right here of the pillar of fire on brother brown's shoulder outside a church door that he contacted me by email requesting a copy of the picture and he said brother he said i took the picture and he said i would appreciate a copy and apparently he had tried to get a copy from other places but they couldn't get him so he said i was just wondering if you could provide it and i did amen there's a gentleman that took the picture amen he said william bannon was preaching and ministering and he said he left and he went out the back door and he said i went out and i went around and he said took his picture when he came out the back door amen and it was the pillar of fire on his shoulder praise the lord praise the name of the lord and of course here is the altar of fire around the prophet and as i said he when it when someone showed the picture he said well he said he said that's not me there he said i'm right here and he is right there praise the lord brother i trust we're going to see god amen let's follow the leadership of god not the leadership of william branham but the leadership of god by the grace of god amen see turn with me to romans chapter 8. romans chapter 8 and it says verse 10 if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by is spirit that dwelleth in you i trust you have the spirit of christ in you i trust jesus is in our young brothers and sisters i trust jesus as in yes even to grandma and grandpa not in your head but in your heart amen so verse 11 again if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now if your if your spirit is not in you he won't quicken you no but if your spirit is in you you'll quicken you unto eternal life therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so are you led by the spirit in what you do today are you led by the spirit and what you did yesterday are you led by the spirit in what you will do tomorrow or the remainder of this day what are your plans for the day is it your plans or god's plans how many of us through the day in all decisions how many of us say lord what's your will i don't care what the choice is i don't care what you're trying to make a decision on you you if you're spiritual if you're a son and daughter of god you you'll be consulting the lord in your heart or most definitely it doesn't make a difference what your choice is what you want to do lord i want i want your leadership amen when you start your day you want god's leadership oh yeah but we we think oh well i don't need to talk to the lord about this i don't need to see what the lord's will is you know this is just normal it makes no difference it's not you that lives is christ living in you and brother this christ in you no matter what you do it's him just think i'll tell you this not many have that consciousness or that awareness of being a christian and it's not just being a christian wednesdays and sundays or in church it's being a christian 24 7. yeah by the grace of god you know and what about when we gather sometimes that brother mark's place sometimes we gather here and then we'll go to brother marks for fellowship and that brother what about is it spiritual it ought to be when we sing and praise the lord we're spiritual yeah it's not just entertainment too often too often certain ones are entertained no spiritual it's just your name if you've got the holy ghost and the christ in you it's just your nature just say praise the lord amen thank you lord and it's not just singing the oh the oh we'll sing this one right here yeah that's just the words no no it's revelation oh yeah it's spiritual hallelujah thank you jesus amen amen so we're singing it as unto the lord see again it's 24 7. not wednesday and sunday not just say lord be with us through the day now lord we watch and go on that's it no no no no sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god amen and it says as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god amen so you you're led by the spirit in your job you're led by the spirit in what you're doing in your home you're led by the spirit of what you do in church led by the spirit of what you're doing in fellowship oh yeah it's god in control by the grace of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father amen and the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god by the grace of god amen all right just one more scripture matthew chapter 15. matthew 15 let's see praise the lord for his word matthew 15 and verse 5 but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honor not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have ye made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition you leave it the way god said it don't add to it don't take from it amen says ye hypocrites well did isaiah the prophet prophesy of you saying this people draw nigh unto me with their mouth honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me amen it's serious so brother sister if you draw nigh to god with your mouth let it be out of your heart and you honor god with your lips let it be out of your heart so that your heart is not far from god but rather god is in your heart and he called or rather verse 9 but in vain they do worship me in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defile of the man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defile of the man and then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the pharisees were offended after they heard this same but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind amen blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch grace that we're not following a blind leader but a leader with perfect vision by the grace of god amen and concerning this message on leadership when william branham preached this in december 1965 he said i have a message i feel from god it's a little odd to some people amen he said i don't mean to be different he said i'm living at a changing time and as long as you're building the wall one straight way he said it's all fine he said the brick layers can go right down the road but when you have to turn a corner brother we've got to turn corners too many take the message and just keep on going down the line building a wall but he said he said we're not building a wall we are building a house so he said these turns as to come either they come in the age of martin luther john wesley the pentecostal age and now it's here again but he said it's hard to turn the corners but he said god even though how rough it's been the people has responded 100 so we're very grateful he said thank each one of you turning the corner by the grace of god amen just okay go ahead he said we've got to channel ourselves into god's provided channel and god's way of doing it no matter how much we think it's right it's got to be according to the word of the lord or it's in vain no matter what you feel it's got to be according to the word amen he said cain worshipped but it wasn't according to the word of the lord abel did and it was according to the word of god the pharisees worship but not according to the word of the lord and he said the word of the lord sometimes you have to put put it in the right place or is not the will of god amen so concerning the word of god that will let's make sure it's in the right place to keep us in the will of god concerning this day and this hour that we're living in and brother concerning this day this hour that we're living in what is the will of god what's god looking for in you and me i tell you what god's looking for in you and me now is resurrection and rapturing faith what was god looking for in the in luther's age justification amen the message of justification amen the faith of justification amen and wesley sanctification and of course under the brotherly kindness the loud to see him pentecostals the gifts of the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit but make sure you got the baptism in your soul not just in your flesh because you can have the gifts in your flesh you can experience it in your flesh and still not be in your soul as i've said you can have the holy ghost in your flesh 24 hours a day and go to hell amen but god works out of your soul amen to change us from creatures of time to creatures of eternity amen so make sure it's in the right place in your soul and make sure it's the will of god not your will not what you want it's what god wants well brother how can i make sure that what i want is the will of god judge it by the word this is the will of god amen what what did they do when god moved in abel praise the lord what was the will of god in that in that time well was cain in the will of god or abel in the will of god it was able not cain yeah so and it all down true see who was in the will of god and he was doing their own will amen god had to deal with the jews then all through eventually god had to deal with the christians and the gentiles amen because the god is there to reveal his will but the enemy is there to get you to do your will human will the devil's will oh yeah still be religious and still think you're christian but just do it this way do it that way because that's what man did all down through the all the way through the ages when when god moved all the devil moved only us why not again i don't have the time to do it to go into the book of revelation to show you that when the spirit of god went and did this god said oh yeah that was good i appreciated your faith but then the enemy got in and influenced him to do this amen whether it's the first age the enemy got in and the and oh yeah they got away from the holy ghost and got under the control of man man's leadership not god's leadership but the anointing would come down come down come down so the anointing came down again luther's age and men man followed god's leadership with the message of justification god's leadership the message of sanctification god's leadership the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen and now it's god's leadership in the revealed word to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen they had the faith to do what god was doing there and believe what god was doing do we have the faith to believe what god is doing now amen oh yes thank god for for for luther and wesley and pentecost thank god for the others but amen do we really appreciate what god has done and what god's doing to give us resurrection right free faith to get out of here how many want to get out really get out as i've said if you were to travel sometimes and you go to a certain place and after a while you say oh i want to go back home again now why because you get lonely and you want to go home well i'll tell you this the bride of christ is lonely now long some also lonesome now i was preaching at a certain church one time and the gentleman that was recording he wanted to know a title to put on the on the sermon and i said lonesome also lonesome and uh he said what what what's that how do you spell that he didn't know what i was referring to i said lonesome also lonesome you don't know no he didn't know what it meant until i got in to preach it because the prophet of god also highlighted that with a with a little bit of a pull a poultry and he said long so for lonesome for that far away southwest where the mountains or the shadows fall the deepest on the mountain crest and so on and uh brother brown was referring to what god was going to do when he went move from the east to the west amen praise in tucson and so on yeah so are we lonesome also launch them for home oh if you were to travel here travel there you get lonesome to come back i got to get we got to get home well brother sister if you really got the baptism of the holy ghost you're born again amen you want to go back to eternity you want to get back to heaven you want to get back to be with jesus by the grace of god so do you feel lonesome to get home i pray god give us a greater anointing of the holy ghost and we'll get more and more lonesome the more of god you experience the more lonesome you'll be you'll want to be with the lord by the grace of god amen he said the word of the lord he says sometimes you had to put it in its right place or it's not the will of the lord it's got to be in the right place at the right time amen he said now when the resurrection comes he said the life that lived in them lutherans and he said the life that lived in the methodists and the life that went lived in the pentecostals will all be raptured out of the ground he said in the body of the bride to be taken up and in before jesus christ he said glory to god hallelujah it's exciting but it's the truth and he said we have turned the corner and we're looking towards heaven watching for the coming amen the camp on the pyramid as we would say is coming back the church must be resurrected soon and we must get ready definitely get ready grace of god let me finish this was this prayer that brother branham prayed near the end of this message on leadership he said god let me go lord don't leave me behind please jesus let me go with you father i don't want to stay here on this earth to watch these tribulations coming on oh brother sister if he wanted to go back then 65 well oh how much hot we want to go home considering the condition of the world now because the world oh it's sick it's insane god help us he said i don't want to stay here in this insanity i don't want to stand here he said the people losing their mind he said we look at man trying to act like beasts look like beasts and the women trying to look like animals with the paints on their face and you've said the mental condition of the people will be completely gone and we see it in the making right now restore us to the same mind of jesus christ our lord amen he said can you see the insanity of this age i can i trust you again the world's insane not normal no more what if our grandparents had to come back or even our parents and consider the uh consider the age that we're living in god help us amen i'll finish with this he said god uses man god doesn't use machinery god help us is this the machinery he's referring to he did say that god ordained the invention of tape recorders well not many are using tape recorders now it's calm and gone but the technology is still there for he said for the message now he said people say i got all faith well he said if you've got all faith what are you standing here for he said your very actions prove that you haven't got it you haven't got what you're talking about if you had faith what you stand in the prayer line for what do you do these things for he said if you had perfect faith he said you'd look right straight to god and believe it and walk away he said you have the need he said you you have the need of coming in a prayer line he said you have no need rather for these things because your faith has done made it amen perfect faith god help us let's have perfect faith for the rapture perfect faith for the resurrection amen because brother that's what god's working on in your life in my life in the bride of christ he's working on our faith to get us to get out of here and into eternity amen because i tell you god wants to wants to bring forth the new heaven and the new earth do we want it as much as god wants it amen are you really hungry and thirsting for it as much as god is hungry and thirsty for the new heaven and the new earth god help us amen the lord bless you let's
