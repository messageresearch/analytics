[34:49] [Music]
[35:19] [Applause]
[35:35] yes
[35:52] praise the Lord
[35:58] they'll and to God be the glory
[36:01] great things he and it might seem small
[36:06] in the eyes of man but in the eyes of
[36:09] God it's great if he finds faith in this
[36:12] assembly amen
[36:14] God's been looking for since the fall of
[36:17] man he's been looking for faith he's
[36:20] looking for those that believe him
[36:23] and not just believe literally smoking
[36:27] words but believe revelation because God
[36:32] deals with us by faith by grace through
[36:34] faith spiritual revelation a man son and
[36:38] he'll do that tonight oh but our brother
[36:41] is going to speak yes but what God
[36:44] reveals will be spiritual in your heart
[36:46] a man that him that Anthony R not here
[36:51] what our brother Stephen is going to
[36:53] minister tonight but let it that has an
[36:56] ear hear what the Spirit is going to say
[36:58] amen and the Spirit is going to speak
[37:01] into your heart and your soul as the
[37:04] brother ministers verbally God is going
[37:07] to minister spiritually he had taken
[37:10] what what is being said and he's going
[37:13] to bring it down to faith revelation
[37:15] understanding maturity in your soul by
[37:19] grace as why it's written B therefore
[37:22] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[37:25] perfect and that's not sinless
[37:27] perfection that is maturity perfect
[37:31] maturity when it comes to the water to
[37:33] believe God to believe the plan and the
[37:36] purpose of God a man so I pray that you
[37:40] have an ear not ears by your ears you
[37:44] will hear our brother Stephen but I
[37:46] trust by the ear of the soul you will
[37:49] hear the Holy Ghost speaking through our
[37:52] brother Stephen a man that's the
[37:55] important thing there are too many that
[37:57] are going by the letter of the word and
[37:59] the literal smokin word but not despair
[38:02] a revelation of the word a man so he
[38:05] trust will get what God is saved through
[38:09] our brother tonight and we thank the
[38:11] Lord for bringing our brother Stephen
[38:12] coffee this way again and I was
[38:16] surprised to learn that it's been over a
[38:19] year since he's been here I believe it
[38:22] was two we're a year over a year here in
[38:24] July of this year a year and I thought
[38:30] it was just a few months ago that he was
[38:32] here but God blessed us through his
[38:35] ministry then so let's believe that God
[38:37] is going to bless us through our
[38:39] brothers ministry again it's a younger
[38:42] generation rising on the scene but again
[38:46] remembering what the prophets said
[38:47] concerning the younger ministers he said
[38:50] take the message on to the coming of the
[38:54] Lord the revelation of the coming the
[38:57] greater understanding of the coming of
[38:59] the Lord Jesus Christ for the bride in
[39:02] the resurrection and in the rapture
[39:05] praise the Lord
[39:06] so let's believe that the ministry that
[39:09] God has brought us tonight is one of
[39:12] those ministries ordained to fill the
[39:15] prophets shoes he said you are deemed to
[39:19] fill my shoes and brother Neville shoes
[39:22] that's a tall order but again if we just
[39:26] let go and and turn ourselves over to
[39:28] the Lord he is able to do it by the
[39:32] grace of God it is not the manifestation
[39:35] of the of the gift of discernment as the
[39:38] prophet of God used it know that God
[39:41] still discerns by his word a man through
[39:45] the preaching and teaching of his word
[39:46] you discern the thoughts and intents of
[39:49] your heart and and and then the
[39:52] anointing will bring for the word a man
[39:55] to collect that that in your heart or to
[39:57] help you in your heart by the grace of
[40:00] God to give you understanding in your
[40:02] soul by the grace of God that's how God
[40:06] works that's how God deals with man by
[40:11] grace through faith spiritual revelation
[40:16] your soul so as the word goes we
[40:20] pray that we'll have spiritual
[40:22] revelation spiritual understanding of
[40:26] what God is saying and what God wants me
[40:29] to know what God wants you to know and
[40:32] we're in goddess is endeavoring to
[40:35] correct you or to correct me and to get
[40:38] us to get us to line up or to do as the
[40:43] Prophet said in the last vision of the
[40:46] bride when he screamed out stay in line
[40:49] a man stay in line because what that was
[40:54] the last vision he had of the right and
[40:56] that was the last message to the bride
[40:59] in the vision screaming stay in line
[41:02] because because I believe that has to be
[41:05] the the essence of any ministry any
[41:08] message today when we see everything
[41:11] getting so out of line
[41:12] we need to minister stay in line
[41:15] amen and to use the whip of the word to
[41:20] align the people up with with the word
[41:22] by grace so god bless our brother
[41:25] Stephen thank God for bringing him and
[41:28] no doubt he has ministered to
[41:29] congregations much larger than this one
[41:33] but again we pray the grace of God that
[41:36] the break family will be able to make it
[41:38] on Saturday and Sunday and our brother
[41:43] Karsan is working tonight and sister
[41:46] Shara and his wife is in central
[41:49] Newfoundland and and others as well so

[41:54] course and his family in the United
[41:57] States but they will be back on Monday
[41:59] so I know brother Macondo is on call in
[42:03] the hospital in Bureau so pray the grace
[42:05] of God to each one that's that's not
[42:09] with us tonight our brother Joshua
[42:10] sister Lily and we pray God grab bless
[42:14] those on line a man oh praise the Lord
[42:20] he was hiding between sister brother
[42:22] sister Macondo and sisters he had
[42:25] brother Joshua a man
[42:28] sitting with our brother David a man

[47:30] wanted to greet you and thank you all
[47:33] for coming this evening and it's a
[47:34] privilege to be here and always exciting
[47:41] to be in Newfoundland
[47:42] be back on the rock but it's a great
[47:46] privilege and honour for me to be
[47:50] invited here I really I really feel that
[47:52] it's a it's a privilege to be here and
[47:54] to be asked to come and to speak that
[47:57] means a lot and I don't consider myself
[47:59] to be a great speaker but if the lord
[48:02] puts something on your heart to do you
[48:03] have to do it so just excited to be here
[48:07] and thankful for the opportunity to come
[48:08] and speak so thank you for the jail for
[48:10] that hope we can be a blessing to
[48:12] somebody in some small way and it's good
[48:15] to see each and every one of you it's a
[48:17] quick trip it's only I got here last
[48:18] night I have to leave Monday morning but
[48:21] hopefully we'll get the fellowship with
[48:23] everybody and get to see you all and
[48:27] looking forward to the services to come
[48:29] it's a given to be in church on Sunday
[48:31] the scripture says forsake not the
[48:33] assembling of yourselves together so you
[48:36] should come to church on Sunday and it's
[48:38] a privilege to be on Church and Saturday
[48:41] and it's it's exciting to be on Church
[48:44] and Friday
[48:45] so happy to be here the tonight and hope
[48:48] everybody's uh come expecting to hear
[48:50] from the Lord and I doubt any of you
[48:55] have come expecting to hear from for the
[48:56] Steve but you've come expecting to hear
[48:58] from the Lord because I know that he can
[49:01] speak to you and I have confidence and
[49:02] his ability to do so I don't come with
[49:05] any any confidence myself whatsoever and
[49:07] you know I speak but the Gerald said
[49:10] speaking to or spoken to bigger
[49:13] congregations who I have
[49:15] but that means diddly-squat to me how
[49:19] big the congregation is it really really
[49:21] means absolutely nothing to me
[49:22] whatsoever I have confidence in the
[49:25] Lord's ability to speak to somebody
[49:27] through me being here because I know
[49:29] that he led me here and I'm not gonna be
[49:31] here you know I had I had the
[49:33] opportunity to be other places this
[49:34] weekend but I felt led to be here and
[49:36] I'm happy to be here and I'm excited and
[49:38] I know because he led me here and we're
[49:42] preaching the Word of God in his name I
[49:44] know that he can speak to somebody and
[49:46] it's not up to me who he speaks to or in
[49:48] what manner or what I could speak on
[49:50] it's up to him then he presses upon my
[49:52] heart what to say and I I say it with
[49:54] all confidence and I know that he'll
[49:56] he'll do the work in the people yeah so
[49:59] I just pray and ask you that you come
[50:01] expecting and to pull on the word of God
[50:03] and to expect to receive something from
[50:07] his presence being here yeah because
[50:09] we're two or three gathered in his name
[50:11] he shall be there so he's here we know
[50:13] he's here but it's the attitude by which
[50:16] you submit yourself into his presence by
[50:18] the Word of God going forth that you can
[50:20] receive from them it's the attitude that
[50:22] you present yourself to him yeah yeah
[50:24] yeah and you know what if I say
[50:25] something wrong I'm just I'm still a
[50:26] human being I can say things wrong you
[50:29] know and it's never an intention to do
[50:31] so but if I do if I say something
[50:32] against what the pastor says and just
[50:34] spit it out like a cherry seed and let's
[50:37] come back on the basis of the word
[50:38] always bring it back to the basis of the
[50:40] word and I just ask that you'd you'd
[50:44] expect and just pray that the Lord would
[50:46] speak to you and speak to your hearts
[50:48] and again itself a privilege to be here
[50:50] I'm very excited and beautiful weather
[50:53] for October and I was bracing myself for
[50:55] the worst but it's beautiful and
[50:58] Newfoundland is the prettiest place on
[51:00] the face of the earth when it's when
[51:02] it's nice so if you would let's stand to
[51:05] our feet and read a scripture just
[51:09] before we begin
[51:12] let's turn to Luke chapter 21
[51:21] Luke chapter 21 and let's start at verse
[51:25] 25 now this this weekend I have a few
[51:30] things on my heart I'm not sure exactly
[51:32] which way the Lord will go with them but
[51:34] this evening I just wanted to lay a
[51:36] little groundwork of what I had what I
[51:38] had in my heart to say in I guess it was
[51:42] March believe it was March I was
[51:46] supposed to come and it just the Lord
[51:49] worked it out to where I couldn't make
[51:51] it and I had an illness there and I just
[51:55] couldn't make it and I felt something on
[51:56] my heart to speak then so I felt
[51:58] directly led to say it and I was just
[52:00] confused as to why the Lord would allow
[52:02] it to work out so that I couldn't go or
[52:04] come here and speak it but it never left
[52:07] me and I and I thought of this subject
[52:11] and it's been on my heart since that
[52:13] time so it's for somebody and in you
[52:16] know I don't say things in for a
[52:18] particular reason to speak into somebody
[52:20] because I think they need to hear I
[52:21] speak what the Lord puts on my heart to
[52:23] say and that's it and I had I've had I
[52:26] have had this on my heart since March or
[52:29] February and March of this year so it's
[52:31] a long time to have the burden on your
[52:33] heart so I hope it's a blessing to you
[52:36] and I just want to lay a little
[52:38] groundwork this evening and we can take
[52:40] it one step further tomorrow night with
[52:42] the Lord's help and then we can summon
[52:45] up on Sunday the good Lord willing Luke
[52:49] chapter 21 and verse 25 and there shall
[52:53] be signs in the Sun and in the moon and
[52:56] in the Stars and upon the earth distress
[53:00] of Nations with perplexity and we know
[53:03] there's a lot of perplexity with the
[53:05] distress of nations we there's a lot of
[53:08] foreign policy that simply is is they
[53:11] don't know how to figure out this
[53:13] perplexity among nations the sea and the
[53:17] waves roaring in 22:26
[53:21] men's hearts failing them for fear
[53:26] and looking after the things which are
[53:28] coming on the earth for the powers of
[53:30] heaven shall be shaken and then shall
[53:32] they see the Son of man coming in a
[53:35] cloud with power and great glory and
[53:37] when these things begin to come to pass
[53:39] then look up and lift up your hands your
[53:42] heads for your Redemption draweth nigh
[53:45] now let's turn one place proverbs
[53:48] chapter 29 proverbs chapter 29 and verse
[53:53] 25
[54:00] the Lord
[54:06] proverbs chapter 29 and verse 25 9 I
[54:09] think it's interesting that the book of
[54:11] Proverbs the wisest the the the the
[54:15] wisdom that we can draw from from the
[54:17] wisest man that ever Dawn the face of
[54:19] the earth and yet he was the man who
[54:21] could never fully conquer himself and he
[54:23] allowed his wives to turn his heart from
[54:25] from the Lord to other things and yet he
[54:28] we draw from the wisdom from a man who
[54:30] could never conquer himself I think
[54:33] that's fascinating that the Lord would
[54:34] show us through that that we're still
[54:37] human beings proverbs chapter 29 verse
[54:41] 25 the fear of man bringeth the snare
[54:45] now according to the wording in the
[54:47] Hebrew that says the fear of man so it's
[54:50] the fear of a man you'd fear a man you
[54:52] could fear what man could do into you
[54:54] the fear of man bringeth a snare but
[54:57] whoso put us put his trust in the Lord
[54:59] shall be safe that's pretty gracious
[55:05] Heavenly Father we thank you so much
[55:06] Lord for this opportunity to come into
[55:08] your house to hear and to speak the Word
[55:12] of God Lord we know that faith coming by
[55:14] the Word of God and hearing the Word of
[55:17] God Lord I pray that you'd speak tonight
[55:19] that you would take control of
[55:22] everything in this building Lord every
[55:25] soul that you just capture them with
[55:28] your presence Lord and that you'd give
[55:31] us something that would take this one
[55:32] step further
[55:33] Lord we never we know that we're just
[55:36] regular human beings that's business
[55:38] there's no one thing that would fix all
[55:40] except it be your presence Lord that we
[55:44] could step into your presence and
[55:45] receive from you Lord and oh all in the
[55:48] way that you could speak to us only in
[55:50] the way that you know that we have need
[55:52] of because you are the only one who
[55:55] genuinely knows what we struggle with
[55:57] this evening what we are going through
[55:59] Lord what we will go through tomorrow
[56:02] you are the only one who knows genuinely
[56:04] what that what that is man so I pray
[56:07] this evening Lord that you that I'd move
[56:09] myself out of the way that you could
[56:11] come and speak to us little granite
[56:13] father that your presence would have
[56:14] preeminence
[56:16] remove every spirit every hindrance to
[56:18] that and in your glorious name do we
[56:21] pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:22] Christ amen
[56:24] you can have your seats which water is
[56:29] mine are they both mine either one I'll
[56:35] take the one I'm all right now we see
[56:42] here just to get directly into the word
[56:46] and I don't intend to be long with this
[56:48] tonight famous first words of a preacher
[56:51] but I'll speak until the Holy Spirit is
[56:56] finished with you so it's not really up
[57:00] to me but uh I'll have mercy upon you
[57:05] and we see here in in proverbs chapter
[57:08] 29 the the Hebrew word is Shara da which
[57:14] means fear anxiety and trembling the
[57:17] fear of man bringeth the snare so it's
[57:21] the fear that you would have towards
[57:23] some something someone that brings a
[57:26] snare around that man but he says but
[57:30] whoso putteth his trust and the Lord
[57:32] shall be safe he'll be safe from the
[57:34] snare so there is a snare and there will
[57:37] be fear that can hinder the man from
[57:39] from falling from trusting the Lord that
[57:42] would allow him to fall into the snare
[57:44] but there's merely a redirecting of your
[57:47] of your of your being into the trust of
[57:50] the Lord and put your trust in the Lord
[57:51] and you'll be safe from the snare it
[57:54] doesn't mean that the snare will not be
[57:55] there or the enemy will not be there to
[57:57] try to put you into the snare this
[57:59] simply means that you will be safe from
[58:01] the snake and then in Luke chapter 21 we
[58:05] see that men's hearts failing them for
[58:11] fear and we know that the heart of a man
[58:13] I'd like to get into this a little bit
[58:14] more tomorrow night the heart of a man
[58:16] is the innermost innermost being it's
[58:19] the the secret intentions of a man it's
[58:23] those things that are that are the most
[58:25] deep within him the secret desires of
[58:28] his heart
[58:29] that's that's the the the the most inner
[58:31] part of a human being is his heart and
[58:36] it said that man's hearts would be
[58:38] failing them they'd simply have no
[58:39] strength they'd have no ability to do
[58:41] anything because they'd be failing
[58:43] because of fear it would be fear that
[58:46] would hold them back
[58:47] and I was thinking just on the way up
[58:50] and on the plane and I had picked up a
[58:53] book that I thought was interesting in
[58:55] the bookstore and it was called the the
[58:57] world order by Henry Kissinger and we
[58:59] know that Kissinger was deeply involved
[59:01] with the Chinese and back in the day it
[59:05] was an American politician and the book
[59:08] said world order and I always flip to
[59:09] the first page and just start reading if
[59:11] it's interesting
[59:11] Abhaya and immediately and in the the
[59:15] the second page he started talking about
[59:17] how Rome fell because there how Rome
[59:20] fell and then how they rose in in church
[59:24] power and that really caught my
[59:26] attention so I bought the book and I was
[59:29] reading it and he was going back over
[59:31] the history of how the the mankind had
[59:34] developed political theories and how
[59:36] political theories had shaped the world
[59:39] that we now live in and he was he was
[59:41] explaining how in in 446 I believe it
[59:45] was the Roman Empire fell and what what
[59:48] happened is is that the the civil
[59:50] disputes between them they simply
[59:52] couldn't operate anymore because of the
[59:56] conflict between people and fear had
[59:58] gotten inside of the people and they
[1:00:00] started to bicker back and forth and
[1:00:01] then it fell and it was the same spirit
[1:00:04] that we know that rose to papal Rome
[1:00:07] so his pagan Rome that fell but it was
[1:00:09] the same spirit that brought back up
[1:00:10] papal Rome and then he began to explain
[1:00:13] that Christianity and Christendom
[1:00:16] offered the people's stability where the
[1:00:19] political regime could not so he said
[1:00:22] they they went to the church simply out
[1:00:24] of fear because of the chaos that was
[1:00:27] ensuing because of no political law so
[1:00:30] he said out of fear people went to the
[1:00:32] church because they offered the
[1:00:34] stability and people needed just to feel
[1:00:36] like they were safe and under some kind
[1:00:38] of law that would keep them from the
[1:00:40] people around them
[1:00:41] now brother branham said in expectation
[1:00:45] in 1961 he says now I want to take the
[1:00:47] subject of expectation now before you
[1:00:50] can have expectation there must be faith
[1:00:53] to accompany the expectation and he says
[1:00:56] there's only two elements in the world
[1:00:58] that controls the world tonight and
[1:01:01] that's fear or faith I find that to be
[1:01:05] fascinating that there's only two two
[1:01:08] things that controls modern the modern
[1:01:10] world so all that you see all the
[1:01:13] industry that you see all the business
[1:01:15] that you conduct all of the things that
[1:01:17] that though that the world has done for
[1:01:19] themselves there's only two things that
[1:01:21] controls that that's faith or fear the
[1:01:24] Paul and I were talking today people
[1:01:28] they understand how they under they have
[1:01:31] the technology to send a drone to see
[1:01:34] Pluto and then retrieve the pictures
[1:01:37] back from it they have the understanding
[1:01:38] of the molecules of the science of the
[1:01:41] physics to send a little hunk of metal
[1:01:44] and wires to take pictures of a planet
[1:01:48] so far away and send it back and yet
[1:01:50] they don't even know how thoughts come
[1:01:52] and go out of their mind
[1:01:54] they don't even know they don't even
[1:01:56] understand what the the heart really is
[1:01:59] they don't understand their their minds
[1:02:01] and how the mind relates to the body and
[1:02:03] how the spiritual matters work they
[1:02:06] don't understand that yet they know
[1:02:08] everything else and they know how to
[1:02:09] build so many things but they can't even
[1:02:12] understand themselves completely and I
[1:02:16] think with that accompanies of fear of
[1:02:18] not being able to understand themselves
[1:02:20] so what they do is they create a culture
[1:02:22] that they can hide themselves in so they
[1:02:26] create divergence from the fear that
[1:02:28] drives them to do what they do
[1:02:29] so they have TV they have entertainment
[1:02:32] they have a beauty things to increase
[1:02:35] the beauty of themselves they have
[1:02:37] fatten a fashion they have all kinds of
[1:02:38] things that diverts the fear that they
[1:02:41] have within themselves because they have
[1:02:43] they don't know they have no order
[1:02:44] within themselves because they don't
[1:02:46] understand themselves it's a fear that
[1:02:48] drives a deep within a man and I think
[1:02:51] what that comes from is that thirst
[1:02:53] that a man was created with because
[1:02:55] everybody in this room is the same
[1:02:57] although we're different we have
[1:02:59] different backgrounds we were raised
[1:03:00] differently in our order in and in our
[1:03:03] creation we are the same we each have a
[1:03:06] body we have a spirit we each have a
[1:03:07] soul so in that we are all driven by
[1:03:12] that thirst that God created in a man
[1:03:14] man to look for something to need a God
[1:03:17] to need something and when they can't
[1:03:20] find that they fear and so men's hearts
[1:03:23] fail them because of that fear
[1:03:25] he says Russia is trying to get
[1:03:28] everybody to fear them they want
[1:03:30] everybody to fear them because they need
[1:03:32] that respect they need that honor they
[1:03:34] need to feel like they are in control
[1:03:37] and we're trying to get everybody to
[1:03:40] have faith in God that's the difference
[1:03:41] the two element controls all nations
[1:03:43] controls all people controls all
[1:03:45] churches controls all individuals is
[1:03:48] either fear faith I think the
[1:03:52] interesting thing is is because that we
[1:03:55] all are the same is because we all are
[1:03:57] we all do have a soul and a spirit and a
[1:03:59] body we are all affected by the enemy in
[1:04:02] the same way so we all have a mind we
[1:04:05] all have a heart and Satan's way into a
[1:04:08] man is through his mind and that never
[1:04:10] changes throughout any walk in a
[1:04:12] believers life so we know that that
[1:04:15] sanctification is is here for a reason
[1:04:18] from the time we were birthed until we
[1:04:20] receive a rapture there's a reason that
[1:04:23] is and the enemy works through us in the
[1:04:26] same way so even though you you are
[1:04:28] birthed into Christ and you have a walk
[1:04:30] with God no matter how old you are how
[1:04:32] young you are or where you are on that
[1:04:34] walk the enemy still has the same Avenue
[1:04:37] into your being so no matter how
[1:04:41] spiritually strong you are or how
[1:04:43] spiritually weak you are how little your
[1:04:46] faith is or how big your faith is Satan
[1:04:48] still has the same Avenue into your
[1:04:50] spirit realm
[1:04:51] a man has a body in the spirit and a
[1:04:54] soul and the soul is either it's it's
[1:04:57] that part of God that was eternal and
[1:04:59] hopefully we can get into that there's
[1:05:01] gonna be a lot that we're gonna get into
[1:05:02] hopefully and I never could understand
[1:05:06] why how a man and a woman could be one
[1:05:09] flesh and how they operate is one flesh
[1:05:12] because they're separate beings and that
[1:05:13] was always a real mystery to me until
[1:05:15] God gives us the revelation that we are
[1:05:18] bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh
[1:05:19] that's why it says this this man and
[1:05:22] this woman are now bone of your bone of
[1:05:24] his bone and flesh of his flesh you're
[1:05:25] one being is because Christ in the
[1:05:28] beginning was that that eternal being
[1:05:31] but the bride just like it was in the
[1:05:34] type in the garden the bride was taken
[1:05:36] from his side he was taken from the very
[1:05:38] bone and flesh of Adam and Eve was
[1:05:41] created within the very molecules and
[1:05:44] material that Adam was created with so
[1:05:47] all of the attributes of God was poured
[1:05:49] into Christ and in Christ is a direct he
[1:05:52] is God and the bride was taken directly
[1:05:56] from him so you are what you are when
[1:05:59] you are birthed into Christ you you are
[1:06:01] what you are because you are flesh of
[1:06:04] his flesh and bone of his bone because
[1:06:06] it's that part of you that was
[1:06:07] foreordained to be in you that's sealed
[1:06:10] into you when you are birthed into
[1:06:11] Christ that is his very nature and that
[1:06:16] is that is either the it's either sealed
[1:06:18] into you or it's not you're either
[1:06:20] birthed or you're not that can never be
[1:06:22] tapped into once you are sealed into
[1:06:24] Christ that seal can never be broken but
[1:06:26] now the Spirit is the nature of the soul
[1:06:29] so we know that the Spirit is a direct
[1:06:32] correspondence to what is in the soul of
[1:06:34] a fruit tree will bear the fruit that is
[1:06:37] in the nature of that seed isn't that
[1:06:39] right this is very familiar to us all so
[1:06:43] if you're if you're an orange you will
[1:06:45] bear an orange for an apple you're
[1:06:46] barren or an apple it can't be either/or
[1:06:49] so that what's in the seed will be
[1:06:52] produced in the fruit and what is in the
[1:06:53] in the seed of the believer it will be
[1:06:55] produced on the outside but the flesh is
[1:06:58] still the same because the flesh is
[1:06:59] never born again
[1:07:01] so the spirit is is is the quickening
[1:07:03] power it's it's um it's the spirit that
[1:07:05] quickeneth and it's the spirit that
[1:07:07] gives life it's the flesh that is dead
[1:07:09] that's John 6:63 so it's the spirit that
[1:07:13] quickens it's that it's the dynamics to
[1:07:15] the mechanics which is the body which is
[1:07:17] the five senses which is how we operate
[1:07:19] in this world but the body cannot
[1:07:21] operate until it has the spirit to
[1:07:23] quicken it but the Spirit is the nature
[1:07:26] of the soul so there is a spirit realm
[1:07:29] that all of us have and it is all the
[1:07:31] same it is simply the nature of the soul
[1:07:33] so it is that part of you that that soul
[1:07:36] that has made a new creature in Christ
[1:07:38] and when you are birthed into Christ it
[1:07:41] is that which bubbles up from the inside
[1:07:43] out not from the outside in now you're
[1:07:45] not simply picking up the the rulebook
[1:07:48] and applying it it comes from the inside
[1:07:50] out and it is Christ who does the work
[1:07:52] in you because you are bone of his bone
[1:07:54] and flesh of his flesh but now Satan has
[1:07:59] a way into a man just like God has a way
[1:08:01] into a man God chose the heart and Satan
[1:08:03] chose the mind so we have the greatest
[1:08:06] battle ever fought is in the mind so the
[1:08:07] mind is where those seeds start the mind
[1:08:10] is where the Satan attacks the most and
[1:08:12] it is in the mind that we dwell the most
[1:08:15] it is the thoughts it's the intentions
[1:08:17] it's it's everything that we go about
[1:08:20] our days through the mind but now
[1:08:23] there's five avenues into the spirit
[1:08:25] realm and that's reason that's
[1:08:26] conscience that's memory it's and all
[1:08:30] the rest of them my memory fails and
[1:08:33] it's memory and it's conscience and if
[1:08:35] you take all five of those and you look
[1:08:37] at those those are the avenues that
[1:08:38] Satan can use into the spirit realm so
[1:08:42] that never changes so you wonder why why
[1:08:45] you're a believer you've been in the
[1:08:46] message for so long and you're
[1:08:47] struggling with things and Joanne why am
[1:08:49] I even struggling with that it's because
[1:08:51] Satan has the same avenue that he did
[1:08:53] when you were first birthed into Christ
[1:08:55] he still has to say it the same way he
[1:08:58] still tries to get you the same way yet
[1:09:00] he learns throughout all of it how to
[1:09:01] get to you and he plans and he prods and
[1:09:04] he under the--under he learns you and he
[1:09:07] probes at you and then he understands
[1:09:10] how to do that but that is only allowed
[1:09:11] by God what he can do to you
[1:09:14] but it's still the same memory that this
[1:09:16] is still the same Avenue so uh you you
[1:09:20] you you know you're a believer in Christ
[1:09:22] and you'reyou're going down the someone
[1:09:25] will struggle with something and someone
[1:09:27] will hurt you and and you have a memory
[1:09:30] of that and it just affects you so much
[1:09:32] and then 30 years later someone will say
[1:09:35] something to you and all of a sudden
[1:09:37] that memory is brought back of what that
[1:09:40] person did and then all of a sudden
[1:09:42] Satan has now has an Avenue into your
[1:09:45] spirit realm and then you begin to
[1:09:47] imagine all kinds of things and you and
[1:09:49] you cook up all these things in your
[1:09:50] mind
[1:09:51] simply because Satan had that Avenue
[1:09:53] that memory that he used into your mind
[1:09:55] but the memory was flesh because you you
[1:10:00] remember what it's like to feel
[1:10:01] something a soldier goes through PTSD a
[1:10:04] post-traumatic distress disorder if it's
[1:10:07] a foggy day and the bombs were going all
[1:10:09] around him and he experienced that
[1:10:11] horrible war scene and it was foggy the
[1:10:14] next time he goes to a place that is
[1:10:16] foggy he'll get really scared and
[1:10:19] fearful and he'll get distressed because
[1:10:21] it was foggy that's memory so that's
[1:10:24] simply the flesh said that that
[1:10:25] engrained into his body but yet it was
[1:10:27] the spirit realm and Satan that went
[1:10:30] into his memory and pulled that out and
[1:10:32] prodded and prodded at him through his
[1:10:33] spirit realm
[1:10:35] so you see Satan has these spirit these
[1:10:38] avenues into your mind that are always
[1:10:40] there and they never leave you and you
[1:10:44] can see that it's the same way in in
[1:10:47] Scripture that David was a man after
[1:10:49] God's own heart and all that he had
[1:10:51] accomplished in Christ all that he had
[1:10:53] accomplished for God and yet at the end
[1:10:56] of his days he was still struggling with
[1:10:57] different things
[1:10:58] because Satan still has the same Avenue
[1:11:01] into you and when you're old is when
[1:11:03] you're young is when you're in the
[1:11:04] middle middle age but brother Branham
[1:11:08] says now he brings it back to 2 there's
[1:11:10] so many things that goes on in the world
[1:11:12] and so many things that we we worry
[1:11:14] about so many things that we think about
[1:11:15] yet brother Branham he brings it back to
[1:11:18] the simplicity of God because God is not
[1:11:21] simple yet he wraps himself in
[1:11:24] simplicity and he hides himself in
[1:11:26] simplicity God is not a simple God he's
[1:11:29] extremely complex far more than we could
[1:11:32] ever understand yet he hides himself and
[1:11:34] wraps himself and simplicity brother
[1:11:37] venom he brings it back to something
[1:11:39] simple and he says it's either fear or
[1:11:42] faith and I think therein lies the
[1:11:44] struggle because it's either fear or
[1:11:46] faith that will drive you and if that be
[1:11:48] so then it is it is the the root of it
[1:11:51] will be fear that Satan will try to get
[1:11:53] you to respond to something a fear of a
[1:11:56] memory happening again fear of an
[1:11:59] imagination that you're cooking up in
[1:12:01] your mind and anxiety a depression from
[1:12:03] something that happened in the past will
[1:12:05] all be the root of faith of fear so I
[1:12:11] guess the you can understand the
[1:12:14] importance of it then if everything is
[1:12:16] ran by either faith or fear then what
[1:12:18] you're going through you must trace it
[1:12:20] back to the very root of it to see what
[1:12:22] is going on is it here is it faith that
[1:12:25] really drives me is it faith and I'm
[1:12:26] operating today or is it fear brother
[1:12:30] Branham said in 1953 in Israel in the
[1:12:33] church part 1 he says now the first
[1:12:36] place we want to find out is why is is
[1:12:38] the greatest thing that I've found among
[1:12:39] Christian people throughout the entire
[1:12:41] world has been a fear the greatest thing
[1:12:46] out of all the people in in and all of
[1:12:48] the world that he went and all of the
[1:12:51] Christians that he spoke to and that he
[1:12:53] dealt with and that he prayed for he
[1:12:54] said the greatest thing among them is
[1:12:56] fear and there you can see the greatest
[1:12:59] trick of the devil is to get fear into
[1:13:01] the people to get them to fear something
[1:13:03] because fear will hold you back and
[1:13:05] withdraw you from something fear it's it
[1:13:09] sterilizers
[1:13:11] courage and Vince in faith and bravery
[1:13:14] to accomplish something for God it keeps
[1:13:17] you and it holds you back he said the
[1:13:19] greatest thing is fear among the
[1:13:21] Christian world they're always afraid
[1:13:23] and with a little sickness strikes
[1:13:26] they're afraid many I wonder sometimes
[1:13:29] and now I'm along with you but now I'm
[1:13:31] trying to do tonight and then this week
[1:13:33] to come is to try to drive that fear
[1:13:35] away he says I can't I can't do anything
[1:13:39] with you until first I Drive the fear
[1:13:41] away so in other words I can't preach to
[1:13:44] your faith I cannot build your faith
[1:13:46] until first fear is driven from you so
[1:13:50] he says you want to grow you want these
[1:13:52] great things you want algebra and I've
[1:13:54] got to drive the fear away and teach you
[1:13:56] the ABCs so that you can add to your
[1:13:59] faith and build from there but first
[1:14:01] I've got to get the fear out I think at
[1:14:04] any point in time Satan tries to get
[1:14:06] fear back into a believer because he
[1:14:08] still has that Avenue imagination reason
[1:14:11] conscience memory he still has those
[1:14:13] avenues that he attacks the believer
[1:14:15] every day and the thing about this this
[1:14:17] is not some grand scheme or anything
[1:14:19] this happened every single day in the
[1:14:21] life of a believer you know what I'm
[1:14:24] speaking about this is not some obscure
[1:14:26] theology this comes down to everyday
[1:14:29] living for the believer that's what
[1:14:32] that's what burdens me the most is to is
[1:14:33] to understand Lord where is my place
[1:14:35] today because you're not promised
[1:14:37] tomorrow sufficient for tomorrow is the
[1:14:39] evil thereof but what do you want me to
[1:14:41] do today what is my job today what could
[1:14:46] you accomplish in me today I don't have
[1:14:50] tomorrow and I can't worry about what
[1:14:53] happened yesterday what do you want me
[1:14:55] to do today and if that be the case then
[1:14:57] wouldn't the enemy try to be there ever
[1:15:00] so much and he try to bring you to a
[1:15:03] place where you're not focused on him
[1:15:04] but your focus on everything that
[1:15:06] everything the busyness the anxiety the
[1:15:09] stress the problems our circumstance
[1:15:13] he says what I'm trying to do is drive
[1:15:15] out all of the fear and then I'm gonna
[1:15:17] bring faith in this word fear in the
[1:15:25] Greek it's full boughs where we get our
[1:15:27] word phobia maybe a fear of all kinds of
[1:15:30] things is a fear of all kinds of things
[1:15:33] I don't have time to get into them the
[1:15:36] word in the Greek it means fear means
[1:15:38] terror but it also means reverence so
[1:15:42] there's a it's the same word in the
[1:15:44] Greek all throughout the scripture in
[1:15:46] many places it talks about the the fear
[1:15:49] of God and then it talks about fear and
[1:15:51] it's many times the same word just use
[1:15:53] in a different context so we'd say we
[1:15:56] use the word fear in the same contact
[1:15:59] the same word in many ways to denote a
[1:16:02] different meaning so we'd say we don't
[1:16:05] really use the word in modern days I
[1:16:07] fear the president in in there in the in
[1:16:10] the way that I would respect the
[1:16:12] president we don't say that we say well
[1:16:13] you have a respect for the president we
[1:16:15] have reverence for the pen the president
[1:16:17] but in the scripture it is the same word
[1:16:20] and it is almost used in the same way
[1:16:22] there's different variances in different
[1:16:24] places and I like the brick an get into
[1:16:26] that but it's the same word that is used
[1:16:29] when it says do not fear as when it says
[1:16:32] fear God in first John 4:18 it says
[1:16:37] there is no fear in love phobos in
[1:16:39] Romans 8:14 15 it says who we have not
[1:16:43] received the bondage again to fear
[1:16:45] terror reverence and fear we haven't
[1:16:49] received the spirit of fear so then we
[1:16:51] know that there is a spirit that
[1:16:52] accompanies fear and we know that there
[1:16:55] in order for it to have life it has to
[1:16:57] have a spirit behind it so there is a
[1:16:59] spirit of fear that will anoint somebody
[1:17:01] and that is the very spirit that tries
[1:17:03] to get through those avenues of the mind
[1:17:06] in second Timothy 1:17 when Paul was
[1:17:10] exhorting Timothy this Adalia is the
[1:17:14] Greek word that means to timidity and
[1:17:16] fear and cowardice this says in 2nd
[1:17:24] Timothy 1 set verse 7
[1:17:26] and says we do not have the spirit of
[1:17:28] fear but we have the spirit of love and
[1:17:30] empower and of a sound mind so we know
[1:17:34] that we're given a spirit not of this
[1:17:36] we're given a spirit of this now when he
[1:17:38] was saying that to Timothy Paul was
[1:17:40] saying to him I have not given you the
[1:17:43] the the spirit the attitude in your
[1:17:47] ministry to fear God has not given you
[1:17:50] that and he says when you preach preach
[1:17:53] with diligent don't be ashamed of your
[1:17:55] testimony just don't let anybody despise
[1:17:57] your youth speak with with all assurance
[1:18:01] and diligence preach just fervently from
[1:18:05] your heart just don't be afraid of it
[1:18:07] and then he didn't say you will not have
[1:18:10] you will not be fearful because Timothy
[1:18:13] would be fearful because he's a regular
[1:18:14] human being because Paul knew what it
[1:18:16] was to be fearful about something he
[1:18:18] lived in a fear and almost a dread in a
[1:18:21] in a an anxiety and a depression all of
[1:18:24] the time for what he did to the to the
[1:18:26] believers you don't think that Satan
[1:18:27] would not have used the same tactic that
[1:18:29] he used today to the Apostle Paul say to
[1:18:32] jump on his shoulder buy an avenue of
[1:18:34] memory in today the spirit round and say
[1:18:37] but look what you did to those people
[1:18:38] back there and he lived with that
[1:18:40] anxiety of what what what could I do for
[1:18:43] the Lord because I did that all that all
[1:18:45] the time he lived with the fear then in
[1:18:48] the depression of that all the time but
[1:18:50] you never hear him speak about it in in
[1:18:52] the in the way that God could never
[1:18:54] deliver him from that so he didn't say
[1:18:57] to Timothy you won't fear you won't
[1:18:59] experience anxiety you won't fear
[1:19:01] depression you won't experience
[1:19:03] depression it's not that you won't
[1:19:05] experience fear but he says God hasn't
[1:19:08] given you the spirit of fear because
[1:19:10] he's giving you this spirit the power of
[1:19:13] love and of a sound mind that word sound
[1:19:16] lines means self-control it's the same
[1:19:19] word that Titus used to say it all of
[1:19:22] your young men live with self-control
[1:19:25] let your let your older women control
[1:19:28] themselves and teach the younger women
[1:19:30] how to live let your young women live in
[1:19:32] self-control you can you can use
[1:19:35] self-control yourself by bringing your
[1:19:37] spirit and your itself subject to the
[1:19:39] Word of God into the
[1:19:40] spirit of God he says he's given us that
[1:19:43] spirit not the spirit of fear
[1:19:44] Phobos it's the same word in the Hebrew
[1:19:50] it's Sharda
[1:19:52] and Yara it means fear and trembling and
[1:19:55] anxiety a fright it also means absolute
[1:19:58] means a reverence that is given to
[1:20:02] something and all those different ways
[1:20:06] of spelling the word the meaning is the
[1:20:09] same you can use it in a sentence
[1:20:11] differently linguistically but it's the
[1:20:13] same word it's the same meaning it's
[1:20:15] fear it's an apprehension it's an
[1:20:18] anxiety
[1:20:19] it's a trembling of something it holds
[1:20:22] you back from something but the venom
[1:20:23] said fear does nothing for you he says
[1:20:27] faith can deliver you fear does nothing
[1:20:29] for you what I'd like to focus on is the
[1:20:34] wrong kind of fear this evening because
[1:20:37] in in in Hebrews what I'd like to bring
[1:20:38] out and focus on tomorrow night is the
[1:20:42] fear of God because Paul said fear bless
[1:20:45] the promise that God has given you would
[1:20:47] be of none effect so he said fear and
[1:20:51] all in all in the Old Testament and in
[1:20:54] the New Testament it said fear God you
[1:20:56] must fear the Lord Solomon the wisest of
[1:20:58] my among men he said here the whole
[1:21:00] conclusion of the matter fear God and
[1:21:03] keep his Commandments it's the same word
[1:21:06] the scripture says that Noah feared the
[1:21:09] Lord and was moved with this fear he was
[1:21:13] moved with fear and by faith he
[1:21:15] accomplished what he did why would the
[1:21:17] Lord tell us not to fear and tell us to
[1:21:20] rid out fear and why would the prophet
[1:21:22] of God say I can bring you no further
[1:21:24] until fear is gone in faith and then the
[1:21:28] Lord tell us fear God
[1:21:32] and Genesis chapter 20 we see the story
[1:21:37] of Abraham when he was going down to
[1:21:40] Egypt and he was not supposed to be
[1:21:42] there and he went he was believed this
[1:21:45] is the same the same circumstance and he
[1:21:47] went down to Egypt and it was it was the
[1:21:50] time when Sarah was turned back to her
[1:21:52] young young age so I'm assuming that he
[1:21:56] was also turned back to a young age
[1:21:58] because he obviously had some jealousy
[1:21:59] going on there because she was obviously
[1:22:01] very pretty because the Pharaoh wanted
[1:22:03] wanted so for his wife so he knew what
[1:22:06] he you know just like every guy
[1:22:08] experienced he's probably a little
[1:22:09] jealous you know because he was
[1:22:11] obviously very pretty lady and he said
[1:22:15] he said he was cooking up things in his
[1:22:18] mind and you know Satan hates the same
[1:22:20] enemy he probably went through the
[1:22:22] spirit realm in some form or fashion
[1:22:23] through imagination and he just was just
[1:22:26] getting down into Abraham because they
[1:22:28] didn't have the Holy Ghost he didn't
[1:22:29] have the Holy Ghost so he had to rely on
[1:22:31] the Holy Spirit Christ to come to him
[1:22:34] and to deliver him from that he didn't
[1:22:36] have that bubbling up from within set
[1:22:38] within it so the Satan problem is
[1:22:42] probably looking down and saying well
[1:22:43] you know what she's a pretty girl man
[1:22:46] you're you know these are Egyptians
[1:22:48] these are crazy guys and you can just
[1:22:51] imagine now what he was thinking and
[1:22:53] what was going on and he said he said to
[1:22:55] Sarah it's telling you my sister and
[1:22:56] then we can just come in and get out we
[1:22:58] can go and visit the pyramids and
[1:23:01] everything and then we can leave and so
[1:23:04] he said that and it doesn't say what was
[1:23:08] driving Abraham to say that it simply
[1:23:10] says Abraham told Sarah tell him you're
[1:23:12] my sister
[1:23:13] so the the Pharaoh obviously you know
[1:23:16] she was a pretty a pretty woman and he
[1:23:19] had nothing hindering them so he said
[1:23:20] well I'd like to marry her so he only
[1:23:22] said can I do this and the Abraham was
[1:23:25] okay with it and everything like that
[1:23:26] then we know the story the Lord comes
[1:23:28] down to the Pharaoh and and says you
[1:23:30] touch her you're a dead man he said Lord
[1:23:32] you know the integrity of your heart in
[1:23:34] it and he said I do know the integrity
[1:23:36] of her heart that's why I've saved you
[1:23:37] from this
[1:23:38] but he says that's my profitable that's
[1:23:40] my profit so I want you to go to him and
[1:23:43] pray for him and have not have him pray
[1:23:45] for you and then given a good dude dude
[1:23:48] just send him on his way but don't touch
[1:23:50] that woman so and it was interesting as
[1:23:53] we were looking today I was looking
[1:23:54] today and he never told Sarah that
[1:23:58] Abraham did this he never went to Sarah
[1:23:59] and said listen I didn't know what was
[1:24:01] going on your husband told me that you
[1:24:03] were his sister I'm sorry he didn't do
[1:24:05] that he went to Sarah and said go back
[1:24:07] to your brother
[1:24:08] he didn't tell her tell Sarah what was
[1:24:10] going on so Sarah was probably
[1:24:11] completely oblivious to what was going
[1:24:13] on because she was probably somewhere
[1:24:14] else being prepared as a bride would be
[1:24:16] in that day so Sarah wasn't even in the
[1:24:18] equation at this point he went back to
[1:24:20] Sarah and said can I give you back to
[1:24:22] your brother and she didn't even know
[1:24:24] what was going on in Abraham he said it
[1:24:26] was out of fear the what you could do to
[1:24:30] me that I did this so you can see that
[1:24:35] it was the fear of man that brings a
[1:24:37] snare and it was that fear that that
[1:24:39] that was coaxing up inside of Abraham
[1:24:41] that Ford that had made him be brought
[1:24:44] into the snare so it was it was a
[1:24:47] perfect example of what can happen when
[1:24:50] you misplace your trust when you
[1:24:53] misplace your your your reverence when
[1:24:55] your fear is misplaced and he placed his
[1:24:58] fear in man and what in that what the
[1:25:00] man could do to him and then by that he
[1:25:03] led himself directly into a snare and
[1:25:05] all of this happened and he was out
[1:25:07] completely out of the will of God in
[1:25:10] doing that but a believer is never out
[1:25:12] of the will of God so he had him praying
[1:25:15] and and we can see now what what what uh
[1:25:18] what what happens when a man fears and I
[1:25:21] know for beyond the shadow of a doubt
[1:25:25] that you could look back in your own
[1:25:26] lives and you could see there was fear
[1:25:29] that I did that by it was fear that I
[1:25:32] did not do that by and you can see in
[1:25:35] your own life how you have been moved by
[1:25:37] fear to do the things that you have done
[1:25:39] or did not do it was either fear that
[1:25:42] held you back from something it was fear
[1:25:44] that made you react to something it's
[1:25:47] either one of the other fear or faith
[1:25:49] that moves a man
[1:25:51] that that constrains him to do what he
[1:25:53] does it either comes to back to one root
[1:25:56] either faith or fear for the random set
[1:26:02] in 1951 he says Jesus always said fear
[1:26:04] not do not fear don't fear don't do that
[1:26:07] if you do then God can't work with you
[1:26:10] if you fear God cannot work with you
[1:26:13] what a horrible place it would be to be
[1:26:17] in a spot where God could not work with
[1:26:18] you it was David's greatest fear to be
[1:26:23] out of the presence of God when all that
[1:26:26] happened with Bathsheba and he went and
[1:26:28] in Psalms 51 he says Lord take not thy
[1:26:32] Holy Spirit from me don't don't don't
[1:26:35] let me out of your presence Lord and he
[1:26:37] feared being out of the presence of God
[1:26:40] you can fear being out of that being
[1:26:42] being out of it and he was he was so
[1:26:44] needful of the presence of God in his
[1:26:46] life as are we and he was fearful to the
[1:26:49] point that he would ever be in a spot
[1:26:51] where he wouldn't be in the presence of
[1:26:53] God it constrained him to do what he did
[1:26:55] and he said brother Branham said yet God
[1:26:57] cannot deal with you if you have fear in
[1:27:01] your life if you are being constrained
[1:27:03] to do something or are being held back
[1:27:05] by a deep deep-seated fear that you just
[1:27:09] can't you can't control you don't know
[1:27:11] where it comes from and you can't
[1:27:13] operate effectively because God cannot
[1:27:16] operate through you because you're being
[1:27:17] held back by fear 19:52 God testifying
[1:27:22] of his gifts he says so don't fear fears
[1:27:24] of the devil everything Jesus would say
[1:27:26] fear not fear not constantly fear not
[1:27:28] fear not always fear not now God don't
[1:27:31] want you to fear he wants you to believe
[1:27:35] so every one of you believe in one
[1:27:37] Accord one Accord every one of you
[1:27:40] believe in one of Accord and do not fear
[1:27:43] you'd see him in the prayer line and he
[1:27:45] he'd be going and he'd stop in person he
[1:27:46] said now don't fear they said don't fear
[1:27:48] go go now and fear not say go believing
[1:27:51] don't fear and the people would come and
[1:27:53] they'd be so scared and they'd even be
[1:27:55] afraid of the presence that was
[1:27:57] anointing brother Branham and they'd be
[1:27:59] scared to get into that presence instead
[1:28:00] don't fear that don't be scared of that
[1:28:02] then one
[1:28:04] so even that even the the the human the
[1:28:08] humanity of these people that were being
[1:28:09] prayed for they were just so caught up
[1:28:12] in a fear within himself that they could
[1:28:15] not go forward but the Branham had to
[1:28:16] address the fear before they could go
[1:28:19] forward and I believe it behold it
[1:28:22] behooves every believer to examine
[1:28:25] themselves and say Lord cast out all the
[1:28:28] fear that is in my life so that I can go
[1:28:31] forward if you feel like you're in a
[1:28:33] point where you can't go forward then
[1:28:34] you have to to get to a place with God
[1:28:36] so that he can move out the fear and
[1:28:39] then place the faith in there because
[1:28:42] there cannot be something sealing the
[1:28:45] soul at the same time there cannot be
[1:28:47] faith and fear at the same time he said
[1:28:50] have you ever seen a completely black
[1:28:51] bird and a completely white bird at the
[1:28:53] same time there's nothing like that
[1:28:55] every resina a drunk sober man there
[1:28:58] can't be faith and fear at the same time
[1:29:00] he says that either one or the other so
[1:29:04] if you are a born-again Holy Ghost
[1:29:05] filled believer and you have been sealed
[1:29:07] into Christ and there was nothing that
[1:29:09] could take you from his hand but it
[1:29:12] could be Satan going through the spirit
[1:29:14] realm
[1:29:14] just imputing fear through a memory
[1:29:17] through an imagination through
[1:29:18] conscience so your reasoning Bible says
[1:29:22] not lean not to your own understanding
[1:29:25] so by the spirit realm Satan tries to
[1:29:28] get into you and he tries to develop a
[1:29:30] fear in your spirit realm that will
[1:29:32] affect every aspect of your life and
[1:29:34] hinder you and drive you to a spot where
[1:29:36] you cannot move forward with God and it
[1:29:40] is only until he gets the fear out of
[1:29:42] you can he begin to build the faith that
[1:29:45] he needs to bring you forward so
[1:29:48] wouldn't it be true then that you cannot
[1:29:50] have the rapturing faith there that you
[1:29:52] need to rapture out of here until the
[1:29:55] faith be removed he said I can't God
[1:29:57] can't do anything with you and if you
[1:29:59] fear you say there's a point there where
[1:30:02] God cannot move you forward you couldn't
[1:30:04] heal you when there was fear there
[1:30:08] like you if you would to turn through
[1:30:10] Matthew chapter 14 I'd like to just
[1:30:18] bring it down into everyday living into
[1:30:23] something you know something that's
[1:30:27] really hits home with a believer because
[1:30:31] it's in here that you you're encouraged
[1:30:32] that you develop the by the hearing of
[1:30:35] the word you develop the armor that you
[1:30:37] need you put on the armor you you you
[1:30:39] receive from God in a way that you can
[1:30:41] be encouraged and strengthened but it's
[1:30:43] out there that you go through the battle
[1:30:44] and it's an everyday living it's in
[1:30:47] everything that you subject yourself to
[1:30:48] it's in the everyday things that you
[1:30:50] feed on that's how you will fight the
[1:30:53] battle that's how you either grow or you
[1:30:55] won't grow Matthew chapter 14
[1:31:06] chapter 20 start at verse 3 and I'd like
[1:31:09] to read this together it's a very
[1:31:10] familiar passage of Scripture but I just
[1:31:13] want you to see what happens
[1:31:17] 23 and when they had sent the multitudes
[1:31:19] away he went up into a mountain apart to
[1:31:22] pray and when the evening was come he
[1:31:24] was there alone Jesus was always trying
[1:31:29] to get alone now speaking the other
[1:31:32] night and just to pause just from this
[1:31:34] for a second God can never fully deal
[1:31:37] with a believer until he's alone he
[1:31:41] never really could get Abraham's
[1:31:44] attention in the way that he needed to
[1:31:45] do it until he was alone and he never
[1:31:47] can really deal with a believer until
[1:31:50] he's alone it's not you being birthed
[1:31:52] into the church are you being birthed
[1:31:54] into the message it's you being birthed
[1:31:57] into Christ it's God looking down and in
[1:32:00] you're his focus and it's you looking
[1:32:02] back up and receiving from him
[1:32:04] individually in crisis mystery of God
[1:32:07] revealed he says he doesn't deal with
[1:32:09] groups of people he deals with the
[1:32:11] individual it's it's you and Christ
[1:32:14] alone that you walk daily it's not you
[1:32:17] and your family are you and this and and
[1:32:20] you and the church that helped you get
[1:32:22] through it's you in Christ that you
[1:32:24] overcome with that's that's the way it's
[1:32:28] got to be and he cannot effectively deal
[1:32:30] with you until you're alone that's why
[1:32:32] you have to get alone with God and Jesus
[1:32:35] was alone and the evening was come but
[1:32:39] the ship was now the ship the disciples
[1:32:41] were fishing and they were off doing
[1:32:45] things at verse 24 but the ship was now
[1:32:47] in the midst of the sea tossed with
[1:32:50] waves for the wind was contrary this is
[1:32:52] a sea of gallilee those of you have been
[1:32:56] to the Sea of Galilee there's no more
[1:32:58] peaceful body of water I've ever seen in
[1:33:01] my life in the Sea of Galilee unless the
[1:33:04] wind comes down from the certain area if
[1:33:06] it cycles through and the wind currents
[1:33:08] come down it comes through the valley
[1:33:10] and the Golan Heights and the other in
[1:33:11] the scene if this comes down it's just
[1:33:13] and just creates a crazy place
[1:33:18] hurricane-force winds
[1:33:20] all of a sudden and this is what
[1:33:21] happened for his 25 and in the fourth
[1:33:24] watch of the night Jesus went unto them
[1:33:26] walking on the sea and when the
[1:33:30] disciples saw him walking on the sea
[1:33:32] they were troubled saying it is a spirit
[1:33:35] and they cried out for fear now that
[1:33:38] word in the fear that the denotation and
[1:33:40] the Greek it doesn't mean that they were
[1:33:43] driven with fear or anything like that
[1:33:45] they just means they they didn't know
[1:33:46] what it was they were timid they were
[1:33:48] they were concerned because they didn't
[1:33:50] understand what that was so he says but
[1:33:54] 27 but straightway Jesus spake unto them
[1:33:57] saying be of good cheer it is I be not
[1:34:00] afraid so just to get to the context of
[1:34:05] the situation this is just an everyday
[1:34:10] event they were going through the storm
[1:34:11] they were there you know they were
[1:34:12] trying to do what they could to get the
[1:34:14] ship from tossing in the waves and and
[1:34:17] being wrecked and and why on earth Jesus
[1:34:22] would come to them walking on water I
[1:34:23] still don't know why would he walk on
[1:34:26] water what's the point and I've always
[1:34:28] wondered did he sway with the waves or
[1:34:30] was it calm where he stood I'm gonna ask
[1:34:32] him that when I get on the other side
[1:34:34] was he swaying there you know and you
[1:34:37] know could they hear him from the waves
[1:34:39] or what was it like you know you can
[1:34:41] imagine how a peculiar this situation is
[1:34:44] in modern in modern time to it to a God
[1:34:47] who defeated death this is nothing
[1:34:50] someone said to me the other day do you
[1:34:51] really I was talking to some unbeliever
[1:34:53] and he said do you really believe that
[1:34:54] you know Jonah was swallowed by a fish I
[1:34:57] said are you kidding me I said to a guy
[1:35:00] who defeated death and it's proven
[1:35:02] historically that there's he was not in
[1:35:04] his grave and you're saying a fish is
[1:35:08] small stuff compared to a man who could
[1:35:11] defeat death and rise again and what a
[1:35:15] peculiar situation this would be and yet
[1:35:18] there is always a particular reason as
[1:35:21] to why something is in Scripture and to
[1:35:23] why something happened in Christ's life
[1:35:24] and here he was and he was calling out
[1:35:26] to the disciples and they were they were
[1:35:28] crying they were Oh
[1:35:30] curious just out of curiosity and
[1:35:33] here oh right what is what is this you
[1:35:35] know what's going on here and you could
[1:35:37] be probably talking and they probably
[1:35:38] weren't saying much on the boat because
[1:35:40] they didn't know what was going on and
[1:35:43] then Jesus says and they hear the
[1:35:45] familiar voice and they understand now
[1:35:48] who it is that's Jesus and he says fear
[1:35:52] be of good cheer it is I be not afraid
[1:35:57] be of good cheer there in a storm and
[1:35:59] there's a man walking on the water which
[1:36:01] has never happened anywhere else in
[1:36:03] history and he says be of good cheer
[1:36:06] what what what do they have to be
[1:36:08] cheerful about but something strikes
[1:36:11] Peter and this is the the important
[1:36:13] thing about it something strikes Peter
[1:36:16] deep down in his heart because there was
[1:36:19] something that was that was inside of
[1:36:20] Peter because he had a lot of problems
[1:36:23] Peter had a lot of issues and he was not
[1:36:26] sealed by the Holy Ghost he was pretty a
[1:36:29] new believer you know at this point in
[1:36:30] time and something just struck him odd
[1:36:34] that Jesus would be walking on water he
[1:36:36] could see it with his own eyes and yet
[1:36:39] there was something that was just unique
[1:36:42] about this situation that was just
[1:36:44] building up inside of him that he just
[1:36:46] it was just strange that this would be
[1:36:49] happening and Peter then cried back out
[1:36:52] to the him once he recognized what was
[1:36:54] happening so he recognized there was
[1:36:58] something happening and he called out to
[1:37:00] Jesus and recognizing who he was he said
[1:37:03] lord if it be thou if it really be you
[1:37:07] bid me to come unto thee on the water
[1:37:11] says the Lord
[1:37:13] if it be you and you got to think what
[1:37:15] faith of a man what courage of a man to
[1:37:18] say Lord if it be you then let me walk
[1:37:21] on the water as well because if you're
[1:37:23] doing that then you can allow me to come
[1:37:26] to you because I know that there's power
[1:37:27] that resides in you so there was just
[1:37:30] something that bubbled up with inside of
[1:37:32] him that where he knew there was
[1:37:34] something peculiar about this situation
[1:37:36] [Applause]
[1:37:40] so he says if it be you then let me come
[1:37:45] unto you and then jesus replied he says
[1:37:48] come and when Peter was come down out of
[1:37:50] the ship he walked on the water to go to
[1:37:53] Jesus now you could imagine I've been
[1:37:59] healed twice of sicknesses in my body
[1:38:01] real bad sickness I had real bad food
[1:38:04] allergies and I was completely healed of
[1:38:06] that and I had Lyme disease and I was
[1:38:07] completely healed of that so I know that
[1:38:09] God can heal so I have no problem
[1:38:13] praying for someone who is sick because
[1:38:15] I know he's done it because he done it
[1:38:16] to me I know he's capable of doing it I
[1:38:20] have no question as to whether he is a
[1:38:23] living God today who can touch us and
[1:38:26] let us feel his presence I have no
[1:38:29] question about that I have no problem
[1:38:31] preaching the Word of God because I know
[1:38:33] he is real because I have experienced
[1:38:35] him I have not seen them what I have
[1:38:40] experienced and I know that he is alive
[1:38:42] and I have confidence in that and Peter
[1:38:46] when he walked on the water when he took
[1:38:48] the first step it was God who gave him
[1:38:50] the ability to do that because Jesus had
[1:38:53] come but when he started to walk on the
[1:38:56] water there was something that was
[1:38:58] obviously reaffirmed in him because he
[1:39:00] began to walk further and he began to
[1:39:02] walk on water and he began to walk so he
[1:39:05] was doing it there was no other man that
[1:39:08] had the ability to walk on water and you
[1:39:10] got to wonder what what kind of presence
[1:39:11] there must have been on the ship that
[1:39:13] day because the storm didn't stop the
[1:39:16] cloud didn't cease the rain didn't cease
[1:39:19] everything was just as it was but this
[1:39:22] man had the ability to walk on the water
[1:39:24] because he knew that Jesus could allow
[1:39:27] him to do it
[1:39:29] it's just such a fascinating scene
[1:39:33] and verse 30 and here's the interesting
[1:39:37] thing but when he saw the wind
[1:39:40] boisterous and we know that the
[1:39:43] everything was the same nothing had
[1:39:44] calmed down nothing had happened it was
[1:39:46] the same Peter began then he was looking
[1:39:49] at the water and you began looking
[1:39:50] around he said I'm actually doing it but
[1:39:52] then when he looked around reality came
[1:39:56] back into play and I'm sure that Satan
[1:39:59] was right there on his shoulder and
[1:40:01] worked through his spirit realm just as
[1:40:03] he does to you and me so he's saying now
[1:40:09] Peter you're walking on water what are
[1:40:11] you doing and and and obviously he was
[1:40:15] working through a reason because he was
[1:40:17] looking at the waves and he was looking
[1:40:19] by what his eyesight was seeing and what
[1:40:22] he was experiencing so he's probably
[1:40:23] swaying I imagine he was probably
[1:40:25] swinging with the waves
[1:40:27] so he was looking at that obviously and
[1:40:29] you can it's it's point-blank what
[1:40:31] happened he was looking around he said
[1:40:33] I'm actually doing it I'm actually
[1:40:34] walking on water and then he began to
[1:40:37] looking around and then you actually
[1:40:38] realized what was happening is that but
[1:40:40] there's nobody else on the planet has
[1:40:41] ever done this and this is completely
[1:40:43] against the laws of physics I'm the
[1:40:44] fisherman I know how water works and
[1:40:45] then all of a sudden he found himself
[1:40:47] waist-deep in water because you see what
[1:40:51] happened
[1:40:51] Satan worked through a reason to get
[1:40:53] into his spirit realm he was just a
[1:40:56] human being like you and my you my you
[1:40:59] and me he had a body a spirit in his
[1:41:01] soul he had a spirit realm he had five
[1:41:04] ways and avenues into his spirit realm
[1:41:07] he was no different than you and I but
[1:41:11] yet he was accomplishing this incredible
[1:41:13] feat and yet when he looked up Satan was
[1:41:16] right there to work through reason
[1:41:19] and you begin to reason with himself and
[1:41:21] then he look down then all of a sudden
[1:41:21] he was in waist-deep verse 31 silver
[1:41:27] it's 30 and he said and he began to sink
[1:41:30] because he was afraid he began to see
[1:41:34] the wind in the water and boisterous and
[1:41:36] he became afraid he was experiencing
[1:41:39] Phobos is what this Greek word is he was
[1:41:44] he was right in the midst of Phobos but
[1:41:47] it was Satan who had worked through the
[1:41:49] spirit realm to develop that fear with
[1:41:51] inside of him that stopped him on the
[1:41:53] spot and made him start sinking he was
[1:41:56] he was accomplishing something that no
[1:41:58] other human being has had had it
[1:42:01] previously or since had done or has done
[1:42:03] and he was accomplishing this and he was
[1:42:07] actually walking if he had walked so far
[1:42:09] you'd think he'd be able to walk the
[1:42:11] rest of the way but he didn't because he
[1:42:13] stopped and looked around and Satan
[1:42:15] quickly used that Avenue of reason and
[1:42:18] got into the spirit realm and all of a
[1:42:20] sudden fear came in fears of the devil
[1:42:23] and faith cannot operate when there is
[1:42:27] fear in operation now the Peter knew who
[1:42:30] Christ was at this point in time because
[1:42:33] he recognized him and he said Lord if
[1:42:34] you can do this then allow me to come
[1:42:37] and do it with you so what faith of a
[1:42:39] man that would allow him to do that
[1:42:41] encouraged to step down off of the boat
[1:42:43] you can imagine what he was thinking
[1:42:45] what the other men were thinking when he
[1:42:47] put his swingers led a leg over the bow
[1:42:49] of the boat and its feet touched the
[1:42:51] water for the first time he could
[1:42:53] imagine what was going through him and
[1:42:54] yet he was walking he had enough faith
[1:42:57] to do that but as soon as he stopped
[1:43:00] singing use that that Avenue into his
[1:43:03] spirit realm and he sank on the spot
[1:43:07] he was no different than you and I he
[1:43:11] knew who was who was standing there
[1:43:13] before him and he was within reaching
[1:43:17] distance of Jesus and he was looking
[1:43:19] around and at that moment he sank
[1:43:22] because he was afraid he was
[1:43:24] experiencing Phobos how simple it is and
[1:43:29] yet how how it caused him to sink after
[1:43:33] after having accomplished something so
[1:43:36] amazing and so incredible in the
[1:43:38] presence of God and yet he was sinking
[1:43:43] verse 30 when he saw the wind boisterous
[1:43:46] he was afraid and beginning to sink he
[1:43:49] cried saying lord save me
[1:43:55] just when David said he said Lord take
[1:43:58] not thy presence for me just like Elijah
[1:44:01] underneath the juniper-tree Lord that
[1:44:04] just let me die let come to me I need
[1:44:06] something I need some help
[1:44:09] it's like brother branham Paul
[1:44:11] throughout his life lord help me I need
[1:44:13] some kind of a help there was obviously
[1:44:15] something happening Satan was trying to
[1:44:17] work for that spirit realm and this
[1:44:18] almost happens daily in the seventh
[1:44:21] church Ange and Laodicea how the enemy
[1:44:22] works ever so harder they get to you and
[1:44:30] I'm bringing it down to a close I said
[1:44:33] it immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[1:44:34] hand and he caught him and here's the
[1:44:39] key and it's simple you know I don't
[1:44:43] have to yell to make a good point
[1:44:45] stronger it's as strong enough as it is
[1:44:49] just by saying it just by reading it and
[1:44:54] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[1:44:56] hand and he caught him and he said unto
[1:44:59] Him o thou of little faith wherefore
[1:45:02] didst thou doubt doubt fear is a part of
[1:45:07] the definition is one of the definitions
[1:45:08] of doubt to doubt is to fear to doubt is
[1:45:12] to have fear he said all you have little
[1:45:15] faith wherefore did you doubt you were
[1:45:18] afraid and the scripture says that he
[1:45:20] was afraid the thing about it is is that
[1:45:24] when we go through the situations in
[1:45:25] life when we go through our situation
[1:45:27] and our trials and we've gone through
[1:45:29] the things that we have we we lose the
[1:45:32] reality of the situation looking back on
[1:45:34] it of how God actually worked through us
[1:45:38] we we we look at the things of scripture
[1:45:42] and we almost in a way cannot relate to
[1:45:44] it to the warfare that David fought his
[1:45:46] battles with hood to the wisdom by which
[1:45:49] Solomon ruled his kingdom turned to the
[1:45:52] perplexity of the time when Jeremiah
[1:45:54] preached and we almost can't relate to
[1:45:57] the great things that they did and we
[1:45:59] fail to see how great a time that we
[1:46:01] live we failed to see the the the the
[1:46:05] reality of our self having the phone
[1:46:07] of the word being a reality that the
[1:46:09] deity of Christ in this age in the last
[1:46:12] time waiting for a rapture to happen we
[1:46:16] failed to see how important we are in
[1:46:18] the eyes of God in this age because we
[1:46:22] are thou fear to make us look at
[1:46:24] ourselves to look at our failures to
[1:46:25] look at this and we failed to realize
[1:46:27] how a mighty a time we live and how
[1:46:32] mighty we are through Christ and that
[1:46:34] the things that we have overcome day by
[1:46:36] day by day doesn't hold a candle to the
[1:46:39] things that that people did maybe one
[1:46:40] time in their life they went through one
[1:46:43] thing in their life and scripture writes
[1:46:44] about it maybe they live peaceful lives
[1:46:47] for the rest of it a lot their lives we
[1:46:49] don't know but yet the believer goes
[1:46:51] through in the latest sea an age
[1:46:53] something every single day you've heard
[1:46:55] ministers say that someone will come up
[1:46:57] to you on the other side and they'll say
[1:46:59] you're from Laodicea how did you do it
[1:47:02] it's every single day the enemy plods
[1:47:05] and prayin and probes at you and tries
[1:47:07] to get you into a place where he can get
[1:47:10] through your spirit realm he can try to
[1:47:12] reach you in a way that you don't even
[1:47:14] know what's going on and who tried to
[1:47:16] impute fear into you then when fear is
[1:47:19] there
[1:47:19] faith has no room to work and God cannot
[1:47:22] move you forward he cannot do anything
[1:47:24] with you when there is fear there Jesus
[1:47:29] he stretched forth his hand and he
[1:47:32] caught him Jesus his hand was
[1:47:35] outstretched Peter he was falling he
[1:47:39] couldn't catch he couldn't even catch
[1:47:40] himself he was water he was seeking
[1:47:43] because he was afraid and Jesus reached
[1:47:46] out his hand and he caught him
[1:47:54] what was happened is that this is fear
[1:47:56] was misplaced and he was looking he was
[1:48:01] looking at the circumstances and for
[1:48:02] that brief moment he allowed something
[1:48:04] to get inside of him and he feared the
[1:48:06] wrong thing
[1:48:07] see because scripture says to fear to
[1:48:10] fear the Lord and and we'll explain that
[1:48:12] further we had the time but what
[1:48:15] happened was is that Peter misplaced his
[1:48:17] fear because the fear of man bringeth a
[1:48:21] snare it says in the last days in this
[1:48:24] time men's hearts would fail them for
[1:48:27] fear the man's innermost intentions his
[1:48:31] desires his innermost being would fail
[1:48:35] him because of being afraid
[1:48:37] but Phobos there's not a day that day
[1:48:40] that goes by that Satan would not try to
[1:48:42] impute fear within you you fear how you
[1:48:45] look you fear what what will happen you
[1:48:48] fear what happens in business in your
[1:48:50] job in your business and your family you
[1:48:52] fear your for your children's lives you
[1:48:55] fear for your own life you fear for your
[1:48:58] future you fear everything that there is
[1:49:00] to fear and there's that little seed in
[1:49:04] there it sets that breeds anxiety and
[1:49:07] the anxiety comes and you're depressed
[1:49:09] by what happened in your in your past
[1:49:11] something happened way back then and
[1:49:13] Satan always through memory tries to
[1:49:15] bring that back into your into your mind
[1:49:17] a young man who will struggle with
[1:49:19] pornography in his life he'll be driving
[1:49:21] down the road and he'll be driving in a
[1:49:23] billboard will be there on the road
[1:49:24] it'll be a morally dressed woman of
[1:49:27] something maybe he dealt with that four
[1:49:29] years of his life and then they're just
[1:49:32] that billboard and he was delivered of
[1:49:33] it by it by God's grace he was delivered
[1:49:35] of it he's a born-again Holy Ghost
[1:49:37] filled believer and then all of a sudden
[1:49:38] the Billboard goes by and then all of a
[1:49:40] sudden through memory he remembers what
[1:49:43] what he saw because they never go away
[1:49:46] and he's just all of a sudden all these
[1:49:50] memories start coming back and by the
[1:49:52] time that young man gets home he's so
[1:49:54] depressed and so far from the presence
[1:49:57] of God he doesn't have strength to get
[1:49:59] down and pray so what he does is he
[1:50:01] turns to something else he turns to a
[1:50:03] movie he turned some music he turns to
[1:50:05] something else and
[1:50:06] drives him farther away from God and
[1:50:09] then the next morning he so he's so
[1:50:11] depressed and downtrodden they so afraid
[1:50:15] of what's going to happen
[1:50:17] it's just that little doubt that little
[1:50:20] thing that Avenue brought that fear into
[1:50:22] him now
[1:50:30] what I want to leave you with this
[1:50:31] evening 1956 and fellowship brother
[1:50:33] branham he said now we have great things
[1:50:35] that we can do in the in the realm of
[1:50:37] faith fakes the faith works great things
[1:50:40] for us and if you brethren here getting
[1:50:42] your and you can't have faith until you
[1:50:46] have love and that's just all there is
[1:50:48] to it you just perfect love casts out
[1:50:52] all fear and you as long as you've got
[1:50:56] fear you can't have faith so you got to
[1:51:00] have love first and it drives out all of
[1:51:03] the fear and then then faith comes in
[1:51:05] and takes the place of fear so when you
[1:51:09] can have that you're coming right along
[1:51:13] he says you've got to have love so you
[1:51:16] see love casts out the wrong kind of
[1:51:19] fear because God is love and if you love
[1:51:23] because God first love you and he is
[1:51:27] agape love and what it was is love it's
[1:51:30] not the the capstone love that we see in
[1:51:33] the pyramid it was not the the ability
[1:51:36] to love everybody and to be like a 1960
[1:51:39] love to all humanity and love and peace
[1:51:41] God is love and it was that projecting
[1:51:45] down and reflecting off of that off of
[1:51:48] his bride
[1:51:49] it was Christ reflecting off of the moon
[1:51:51] the Sun reflecting off of the moon it
[1:51:53] was love being projected from the very
[1:51:55] nature of Christ and then that brought
[1:51:58] something out of the bride and that
[1:52:00] casts all the fear out because if you're
[1:52:04] if you're truly in the presence of the
[1:52:05] Sun then it brings something down that
[1:52:08] you cannot produce in yourself because
[1:52:10] it takes the Sun and the water to
[1:52:12] produce what's in the seed to bring it
[1:52:14] out of the seed so it's merely placing
[1:52:17] yourself in the right atmosphere in the
[1:52:19] right place that simply drives out all
[1:52:21] the fear if you try to drive out all the
[1:52:23] fear then it would be flesh trying to
[1:52:25] get it out and if it's flesh getting you
[1:52:27] out it'll be pledged to get your right
[1:52:29] back in but if you place yourself in the
[1:52:31] right atmosphere if you place yourself
[1:52:34] in the right in the right environment
[1:52:38] then it's the Holy Spirit comes down and
[1:52:41] he is the one who takes the fear away
[1:52:42] and he placed his faith because faith is
[1:52:45] a gift love is a gift of God you cannot
[1:52:48] attain agape love it is given of God
[1:52:51] because God is love and you are the very
[1:52:53] nature the flesh of his bone the the
[1:52:56] flesh of his flesh the bone of his bones
[1:52:58] you are taken from the very nature and
[1:53:01] and being of Christ and that is that
[1:53:03] part of you that is eternal that cannot
[1:53:05] go away and when you'e place that seed
[1:53:09] in the director and in the atmosphere
[1:53:11] that you must it casts out the fear it's
[1:53:15] not you that casts out the fear it is
[1:53:17] God who casts the fear out and then
[1:53:19] gives you faith it's a gift of God faith
[1:53:21] it's a revelation you simply have to you
[1:53:24] have to go to God in the right way you
[1:53:27] have to reach out and grab his hand
[1:53:29] because he's extending it to you and so
[1:53:31] for the Steve that's pretty simple yeah
[1:53:33] it is thanks thanks be to God that it is
[1:53:36] that simple there has to be what I want
[1:53:38] you to understand this evening is that
[1:53:40] there has to be a starting place for you
[1:53:43] to move forward with God you understand
[1:53:46] you you all you want to do with great
[1:53:48] things for God you can't and tell you
[1:53:50] you start somewhere and that starting
[1:53:53] place is to let God do it and to let God
[1:53:58] do it you have to place yourself within
[1:54:00] his ending within his grasp but you
[1:54:03] cannot do that when you're looking to
[1:54:05] everything and then Satan has all these
[1:54:07] avenues to just stop you in your tracks
[1:54:09] and then make you sink on you on the
[1:54:11] spot in order to stop sinking you have
[1:54:15] to allow faith to come in again but in
[1:54:19] order to stop sinking you have to reach
[1:54:20] out and grab the end of Christ you have
[1:54:22] to place yourself in the right
[1:54:24] atmosphere that is the first step you
[1:54:26] fear things you fear this and an anxiety
[1:54:28] and depression is a direct route of fear
[1:54:31] being in your life you suffer with
[1:54:34] anxiety depression and all these things
[1:54:36] is simply because fear has taken ahold
[1:54:39] of it you want to get rid of those
[1:54:41] things you want to start somewhere you
[1:54:43] want to do something for Christ and
[1:54:45] start right
[1:54:47] you have to reach out and allow God to
[1:54:48] do the work you can't do that you have
[1:54:50] to place yourself in the right
[1:54:52] atmosphere miss Charles Spurgeon he said
[1:54:54] before we can do any great things for
[1:54:56] Christ he said there must be a sense of
[1:54:59] weakness and then trust in the promised
[1:55:02] strength and then fear removed from that
[1:55:06] promise
[1:55:08] perfect love casts out all fear if the
[1:55:11] Lord top would like to get in at
[1:55:12] tomorrow night and musicians would come
[1:55:14] let's stand our feet like too close
[1:55:18] there you have to start somewhere these
[1:55:24] things don't just they they don't just
[1:55:26] happen on their own you don't just fear
[1:55:28] if if the song brother Gerald if you'd
[1:55:30] like to come and turn it over to you or
[1:55:33] the song leader you can't the thing that
[1:55:38] the thing that we we too often just
[1:55:40] disregard is the fact that we can't use
[1:55:44] flesh to get out of something because
[1:55:46] it'll be flesh to get us right back into
[1:55:48] something and if it's if it's the flesh
[1:55:50] in the mind that Satan uses to get into
[1:55:53] that spirit realm then then why would
[1:55:56] you try to use flesh to get you out of
[1:55:58] that because Satan still has access to
[1:55:59] it in a different way he simply would
[1:56:02] come in in a different route in the back
[1:56:03] door in the side door in order to
[1:56:06] overcome that in to make the step in the
[1:56:08] right direction you have to cast out all
[1:56:11] of the wrong kind of fear you have to
[1:56:13] cast out the phobos and he redirects
[1:56:15] your fear because all of the all of the
[1:56:19] issues that the anxiety the depression
[1:56:21] the the things that pause you and cause
[1:56:24] you to sink where you stand and in the
[1:56:28] in the in the problems of life in the
[1:56:30] things that we go through and everyday
[1:56:31] situations what causes you to start
[1:56:34] sinking is that little you know little
[1:56:36] root of fear and you misplace your your
[1:56:40] direction your misplaced your focus you
[1:56:42] start sinking on the spot in order to
[1:56:45] start right you have to place yourself
[1:56:47] in his presence
[1:56:49] you have to place yourself in that in
[1:56:51] that projection of love which is the
[1:56:54] capstone and then let him do the work
[1:56:57] and he'll turn able to turn it around
[1:57:00] let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[1:57:05] we love your father so much Lord we
[1:57:09] realize our frailty Lord our
[1:57:13] incapability Lord to get things right
[1:57:15] yes we realize our inability Lord to
[1:57:19] turn to the right thing our inability to
[1:57:22] focus on the right thing and so we turn
[1:57:25] to the to the storm that rages around us
[1:57:27] which will rage until you come we cannot
[1:57:31] escape it we cannot escape the pressure
[1:57:33] of life but Lord I know that there are
[1:57:35] those who are here myself included or
[1:57:40] subject to the fear that the world is
[1:57:42] engrossed with the darkness that that
[1:57:44] pressures the world it's the same
[1:57:46] pressure that pressure is us lord help
[1:57:49] us to to focus on the right thing not to
[1:57:53] be so caught up in ourselves and our
[1:57:55] problems and our anxieties but we cannot
[1:57:57] see clearly what lies before us and that
[1:58:01] is the outstretched hand of Almighty God
[1:58:03] to reach down and grab us where we stand
[1:58:06] this is regardless of where we are in
[1:58:09] our lives however young maybe we may be
[1:58:11] however old we may be whatever spot we
[1:58:14] find ourselves in whatever circumstance
[1:58:17] we find ourselves in Lord we know that
[1:58:19] that's that this truth is the same the
[1:58:23] two are the same yesterday today and
[1:58:24] forever and that your hand is
[1:58:26] outstretched in the same way as it was
[1:58:28] to Peter on that evening at that night
[1:58:30] when he began to sink you reached out
[1:58:33] your hand and you grabbed him and Lord
[1:58:35] we have confidence in the fact that your
[1:58:38] presence is here and capable to do the
[1:58:40] same thing tonight and it's in that

[1:59:11] happen in your presence
[1:59:13] granite farther that your presence would
