[40:43] morning he was talking about prophecy
[40:45] but he said there's a few things the
[40:46] message does and it sets some basic
[40:48] principles and he says it's a first as
[40:50] you you hear the word and you receive it
[40:51] and then you repent and be baptized and
[40:53] then he says you read your Bible and
[40:55] pray he says you feed your EXP
[40:56] experience but then he said there's a
[40:58] post of Duty and he read this quote
[40:59] where brother banham just went on and on
[41:01] about a post of Duty and he says when
[41:02] those Church doors open you have a post
[41:05] of Duty to be there amen he called US
[41:07] soldiers he said soldiers have a post of
[41:09] Duty amen I believe that's what we've
[41:11] got is we've got soldiers here that said
[41:12] it's my post a duty to be there
[41:14] certainly for the preacher it's a big
[41:16] help for the song leader it's a big help
[41:17] amen when you start with 15 and you end
[41:19] with 30 it's it certainly helps a lot so
[41:22] God bless you each one that's come out
[41:23] this evening and I know many are tired
[41:25] and maybe not feeling well but God bless
[41:27] you for being here amen we've seen what
[41:29] happens when people come into the
[41:30] presence of God Amen Mark
[41:33] 10:42 very familiar scripture and it
[41:36] says but Jesus called them to him and
[41:38] saith unto them he's speaking to his
[41:39] disciples ye know that they which are
[41:42] accounted to rule over the Gentiles
[41:44] exercise lordship over them and their
[41:46] great ones exercise Authority upon them
[41:49] so Jesus is setting up a contrast now
[41:51] between the way the world does things
[41:52] and the way the Believers do he says but
[41:55] so shall it not be among you but
[41:57] whomsoever shall be great among you
[42:00] shall be your minister now that word
[42:02] Minister means servant of a king it
[42:04] means a waiter one that serves food and
[42:06] drink but the religious world and the
[42:09] political world has elevated ministers
[42:10] to a place of uh uh of of being served
[42:14] rather than them being servants and it's
[42:16] come to the place where if you're a
[42:17] minister whether it's a political uh
[42:19] role or if it's a ministerial role in a
[42:21] church and we've turned it around to
[42:23] where we think that you ought to serve
[42:25] us and we think that you ought to make
[42:27] our lives easy and you ought to do this
[42:29] for us and you ought to do that for us
[42:30] and it's turned into a coddled position
[42:32] rather than a serving position amen but
[42:35] there's supposed to be a servant's heart
[42:36] in a minister amen that's literally the
[42:38] definition of a a minister is that he's
[42:40] a servant amen yes we're supposed to be
[42:43] respectful we're supposed to to to be
[42:45] appreciative of those men and whatnot
[42:47] but there's got to be a servant's heart
[42:49] inside of a minister otherwise
[42:51] regardless of the gift he'll never be
[42:53] able to do anything good in the kingdom
[42:54] of God because his purpose is is to
[42:56] serve first and foremost amen amen you
[42:59] aren't my master amen I'm your minister
[43:02] but you're not my master I serve you but
[43:04] Christ is my master amen that's the way
[43:07] these things work he says and whosoever
[43:08] of you will be the chiefest who wants to
[43:11] be first he says let he he shall be the
[43:14] servant of all so there's the
[43:15] confirmation Amen to be great in the
[43:17] kingdom of God is to be a servant amen
[43:19] the greatest of Christ's Kingdom will be
[43:22] servants he says for even the son of man
[43:25] came not to be ministered to but to
[43:27] minister and to give his life a ransom
[43:30] for many amen the king of King Lord of
[43:32] lords came to minister he came to serve
[43:34] he came to lay down his life above all
[43:37] those things amen God bless you you can
[43:38] have your seats this evening and we're
[43:40] taking I believe the last service on
[43:43] this attribute of Charity that we've
[43:44] been speaking on from second Peter
[43:46] chapter 1 and I want to take a title
[43:48] this evening of power to serve amen and
[43:51] we've said before that there's word
[43:52] charity in the in second Peter is that
[43:55] word agapo in the Greek and it's the
[43:57] holy spirit it's the very life of God
[43:59] and it's commonly just called love
[44:01] that's what it says elsewhere in the
[44:03] scriptures it'll call it charity it'll
[44:04] call it love but it's only used
[44:06] exclusively in the New Testament because
[44:08] this love wasn't available to reside in
[44:11] a human being until Christ came and gave
[44:13] his life amen it wasn't available God
[44:16] could put his Spirit on someone he could
[44:18] put his Spirit on David on Samuel on
[44:20] Joshua on Moses and many others but they
[44:22] couldn't experience what Peter was
[44:24] talking about in second Peter chapter
[44:26] one because they were under the old
[44:27] Covenant and they were in a covenant
[44:29] where their sins were covered but that
[44:31] was not enough God couldn't come into a
[44:33] vessel whose sins were covered amen and
[44:35] he had to come and he had to shed his
[44:36] blood and that separated us from our
[44:39] sins amen I've got a real Echo up here
[44:41] brother Matt if you can help me out amen
[44:43] but that's the revelation of
[44:44] justification amen when it comes to sin
[44:47] is that it's not as if you never did it
[44:49] amen but it says it's it's that you
[44:51] never did it in the first place brother
[44:52] brandham would say Amen that you didn't
[44:55] do it because your sins have been
[44:56] separated from you there's nothing to
[44:58] tie you to it it's a complete and total
[45:00] separation and this is what it says in
[45:02] the Scripture it says he will turn again
[45:05] he will have compassion upon us he will
[45:07] subdue our iniquities and thou will cast
[45:10] all their sins into the depths of the
[45:12] sea if you want proof of that you can go
[45:15] look at Hebrews 11 because I was talking
[45:17] about this with a brother this week and
[45:19] it was such a revelation to me when a
[45:20] visiting Minister came and and just
[45:22] mentioned this kind of off hand because
[45:24] you look at the Old Testament and it
[45:26] talk tells the stories of the faithful
[45:28] ones it tells the stories of of Abraham
[45:30] and Sarah and Moses and all these
[45:32] different ones and it tells they're good
[45:35] and it tells they're bad in the Old
[45:36] Testament and then we get to see the
[45:38] humanity of those people but then you
[45:40] come to Hebrews 11 and Paul now speaking
[45:42] by the Holy Spirit writing by the Holy
[45:44] Spirit he writes their stories and
[45:46] there's nothing bad there it's all good
[45:49] why because everything they did bad is
[45:51] under the blood Paul's writing it
[45:53] literally through the blood of Jesus
[45:55] Christ and all he sees sees their
[45:56] faithfulness amen and that's why we're
[45:58] the Sons and Daughters of Abraham where
[46:00] the Seed of Abraham is because our
[46:01] righteousness is by faith in Christ not
[46:03] in our works and so in Hebrews 11 you
[46:05] see the effect of their faith and it was
[46:07] that there was going to come a sacrifice
[46:09] a perfect sacrifice that would separate
[46:11] them from their sin and through that
[46:13] they are seen perfect through God's eyes
[46:15] amen that's what the blood of Christ
[46:16] does is it separates us from our sin and
[46:19] Christ literally became our sin
[46:21] scripture says he it was a literal
[46:23] transformation he became us so that we
[46:26] could become him when we got the
[46:27] greatest deal in the history of humanity
[46:29] was when he took our place and we got
[46:31] his place and now we stand here today by
[46:33] faith as the righteousness the very
[46:35] righteousness of God you and I are the
[46:37] very righteousness of God because Christ
[46:39] took our place amen but we know this
[46:41] Divine Love This agapo Love that we've
[46:43] been talking about it's the peak it's
[46:45] the Apex it's a Capstone it's the
[46:47] finishing element of the the Christian
[46:49] it's the highest attribute it's the
[46:50] highest nature that we can get amen but
[46:52] it's not just an attribute see we talked
[46:55] about brother love and we talked about
[46:57] uh faith and we talked about all these
[46:59] different things and those are
[47:00] attributes but when we come to this it's
[47:02] not just an attribute but it's a life
[47:04] amen it's the very Life of Christ inside
[47:06] of us and it's not something we can put
[47:08] on and take off but it's something
[47:09] that's with us all the time amen when he
[47:12] gives you the Holy Spirit when he fills
[47:13] you with the Holy Spirit when he comes
[47:15] and resides in you you cannot separate
[47:17] yourself from him amen nothing can
[47:19] separate us from the love of God what it
[47:21] is it's the Holy Spirit that's inside
[47:23] each one of us now Jesus would tell talk
[47:25] about this in John 14 and he's talking
[47:28] to the disciples about what's going to
[47:29] happen after he leaves and he says I'm
[47:31] going to send another Spirit he says and
[47:33] it's even the spirit of
[47:35] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[47:38] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[47:40] him but ye know him for he dwelleth with
[47:43] you present test tense amen that was
[47:45] Christ he says and shall be with you
[47:47] future tense and that's the holy spirit
[47:50] amen we know it's the same person
[47:51] because when Paul was knocked off his
[47:53] horse by the pillar of fire he said Lord
[47:56] who are you and he said I am Jesus whom
[47:58] thou persecutest what was it Jesus said
[48:00] I come from the father I go back to the
[48:02] father it was Christ himself back in
[48:04] that Pillar of Fire in his original form
[48:07] amen now there's a bunch of misst
[48:09] understanding I think about why the Holy
[48:10] Ghost was given and I'm only going to
[48:12] touch on a portion of it tonight but I
[48:14] want to hit the high point because if
[48:16] you can catch this then it'll help you
[48:18] with everything else that comes along as
[48:20] we come into adoption and it's Lord
[48:22] willing will start on the adoption
[48:24] portion that I've been trying to get to
[48:26] for many months now on Sunday but we've
[48:28] got to get this settled first because if
[48:30] you don't understand what the Holy Ghost
[48:32] is given for then you'll get adoption
[48:34] all wrong and you'll start trying to do
[48:36] things and you'll start trying to be
[48:37] things and you'll be expecting things
[48:39] that are not to be expected in adoption
[48:41] but this is a mindset we've got to come
[48:43] to about why the Holy Ghost was given
[48:45] and the prophet of God would preach a
[48:46] sermon called what was the Holy Ghost
[48:49] given for amen you want to know what it
[48:51] was given for go read the the the
[48:52] service that he preached on it but he
[48:54] read John 14 and he read the same
[48:56] scripture I did but he read a whole
[48:57] bunch more of it and then he would say
[48:59] this he said Jesus said have I been so
[49:02] long with you I've been so long with you
[49:04] Philip and you don't know me when you've
[49:06] seen me you've seen the father and why
[49:09] sayest thou unto me show us the father
[49:12] God was made flesh he says now here it
[49:14] is the father was God over you we saying
[49:17] we've been since Adam God the father was
[49:19] over Moses and the children of fire
[49:21] Israel in a pillar of fire then God was
[49:24] with us in Christ he walked with us
[49:25] talked with us eat with us slept with us
[49:28] God over us God with us then he says now
[49:31] it's God in us he says all God was come
[49:34] into Christ he was the fullness of the
[49:36] godhead bodily in a body it says all
[49:39] Christ was come into the church what is
[49:41] it he says now this is God working in
[49:45] you that's what the Holy Ghost is he
[49:47] says anywhere in the world that he would
[49:49] want to call on you you're right there
[49:52] he says working in you to do his good
[49:55] Good Will working in you to do whose
[49:59] good will his Good Will amen he says how
[50:02] we ought to thank God for that God the
[50:04] holy spirit is sent for the purpose of
[50:07] God living in his church moving through
[50:11] each age working out what his Divine
[50:17] will you know what that tells me my will
[50:20] has no place there my will has to be
[50:23] your will my will needs to be his will
[50:27] and then I can step into his Divine
[50:29] Purpose amen we're talking about this
[50:31] Divine attribute of of Charity of love
[50:33] and it's the very life of God and we see
[50:36] here that the Holy Spirit was meant to
[50:37] step into people to produce the will of
[50:40] God to produce the word of God to do
[50:43] what God wants done in an age and in a
[50:45] season amen and God has always used
[50:47] people he doesn't have to use people we
[50:50] see in scripture many times where God
[50:52] comes sovereignly to choose one but one
[50:55] once he gets that one he uses that one
[50:57] to get everybody else God doesn't just
[51:00] come to another one and another one and
[51:01] another one but what he does is he comes
[51:03] to one and he gets them on fire he puts
[51:06] his life in them he puts his message in
[51:07] them he puts his word in them he lets
[51:09] them see their time and their season and
[51:11] then that one goes and they get one and
[51:13] then those two go and get two and then
[51:15] those two get four and four get eight
[51:17] and you do the math and pretty soon
[51:19] you've got a body of Believers why
[51:21] because God came to one and he used that
[51:23] one to just go through and start to
[51:25] spread the word throughout amen that's
[51:27] how we we seen it in this church look at
[51:30] it we didn't have uh 18 people respond
[51:33] to an ad we had one person respond to an
[51:35] ad and he gets his fire lit and he gets
[51:38] baptized and his life starts to change
[51:40] and then one comes in and then one more
[51:42] comes in and one more comes in and
[51:43] pretty soon what do we have we have a
[51:45] body of Believers God comes to one and
[51:48] even then he didn't he didn't just come
[51:50] sovereignly to him he used another man
[51:52] didn't he God touches one brother bam
[51:54] says you want to Revival get your fire
[51:56] lit and then that'll go from one to the
[51:58] next one and the next one amen he uses
[52:01] people amen and it's it's not again that
[52:03] he's Bound by that God can do whatever
[52:05] he wants but generally speaking he does
[52:07] this he uses a fivefold Ministry
[52:09] Ephesians 4 tells us and there to speak
[52:12] and preach and witness and feed the
[52:14] people on a regular basis but I want you
[52:16] to understand the Holy Ghost is given to
[52:19] minister not just to ministers like we
[52:22] think of behind the pulpit amen it's for
[52:24] each and every one of us listen A Gifted
[52:27] Minister can preach without the Holy
[52:30] Ghost of course they can you can go out
[52:33] to many denominations and gifted gifted
[52:36] men the their ability to speak their
[52:38] ability to weave a sermon together their
[52:41] ability to Captivate the people the
[52:43] Charisma they have they can preach but
[52:46] that's not what preach means preach
[52:48] means to preach the word and demonstrate
[52:51] it as well and that takes the Holy Ghost
[52:53] but a gift to speak that they can
[52:55] absolutely do that without the Holy
[52:57] Ghost but to be effective in the kingdom
[52:59] of God you've got to have the Holy Ghost
[53:01] because otherwise you have no guide you
[53:03] have nobody to lead you have nobody to
[53:05] inspire except yourself and everything
[53:06] we do is death it's destructive it's
[53:08] chaotic amen I was listening to a
[53:10] message Minister the other day this says
[53:12] a color brother overseas there having
[53:14] special meanss and he says there is no
[53:16] man behind this Pulpit he says it's only
[53:18] the Holy
[53:20] Ghost now that's a mouthful isn't it but
[53:23] that's the way it's supposed to be is
[53:24] that there's only a microphone here and
[53:27] it's the Holy Spirit speaking through a
[53:29] man and that's the gift is that the man
[53:31] can speak as he's inspired by the Holy
[53:33] Spirit that's the way it's supposed to
[53:35] work but here's the thing is there's
[53:37] only one of me I said this in British
[53:40] Columbia talking to a church of 150
[53:42] people I said you've only got two
[53:43] ministers here but you got 150 of you
[53:46] here and if you've got the Holy Ghost
[53:48] then that means you've got the ability
[53:50] to minister to serve to be a witness to
[53:53] people amen so don't just just look to
[53:55] me I have my opportunities to witness
[53:58] but you have them as well and if
[54:00] everyone's doing their part then we see
[54:02] a much greater pull from the world than
[54:04] we would have if it was just me or the
[54:05] ministry amen and these things what is
[54:08] it because when we get our fire lit then
[54:10] we want other people to get their fire
[54:11] lit as well when we get joy that that
[54:14] passes all understanding and peace that
[54:15] passes all understanding we see people
[54:17] that need that what do we do we want
[54:19] them to have what we have I I see
[54:21] co-workers and they're they have so much
[54:23] angst and they're just so worried and
[54:25] they're stressed about life and money
[54:27] and all these things what do you want
[54:28] you want them to have the same peace
[54:30] that we have I was talking to a A
[54:32] co-worker that's a
[54:34] Jew and just testifying a bit about the
[54:36] things that God's doing and and he said
[54:38] well how do you guys pay for this church
[54:40] you just got I saidwell we
[54:43] tithe and he said gross or
[54:46] net I said Gross
[54:49] mostly but he said our church brings in
[54:52] $50,000 our synagogue he says I handle
[54:54] that that's my my job we bring in 50,000
[54:57] a church full of
[54:58] Jews right that's
[55:02] nothing but what he's doing is why did
[55:04] he ask gross or net because he's doing
[55:07] the numbers and he's said and he's
[55:08] saying how can somebody live taking 10%
[55:11] off the gross 10% off the net is bad
[55:13] enough but 10% off the gross and you got
[55:15] a church full of people doing that yes
[55:18] why because we believe that I've never
[55:20] seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed
[55:23] begging bread and we see do it over and
[55:26] over and over again amen that's what we
[55:29] believe and we've seen it in action
[55:31] that's a testimony I didn't have to tell
[55:33] him about Christ he's doing the numbers
[55:35] as a Jew and he says there's something
[55:36] Supernatural there I can't do it but he
[55:41] understood it he knew where it came from
[55:43] so it was a witness to him of people
[55:45] that believe in God Amen but I want you
[55:47] to see that there's only one Minister
[55:49] here right now today but there's a whole
[55:51] body of Holy Ghost filled people that
[55:53] have a work to do and and then we're
[55:55] talking about power to serve brother R
[55:57] says we are
[55:59] Pentecostal or are we he says the next
[56:02] thing if we are Pentecostals let's be
[56:04] Pentecostal If the message is right get
[56:07] in it anden if we believe what we say we
[56:10] believe then let's live it amen let's
[56:12] put our everything into it and he says
[56:14] if it isn't get out of it and find where
[56:15] is right sure if God be God serve him
[56:19] but you can't serve God and mmon at the
[56:21] same time let's serve God be convinced
[56:24] and then you be concerned then the
[56:26] church will really go to Growing cuz
[56:28] you'll go out and get everybody you can
[56:31] bring them
[56:32] in he's talking to the congregation now
[56:35] he says but as long as you go around and
[56:38] just say well that's the preacher's job
[56:40] he says it isn't the preacher's job it's
[56:43] everybody's job right every born again
[56:47] Christian has that same spirit in them
[56:51] he says the preacher might be gifted but
[56:53] that's just a gift of of the Holy Ghost
[56:56] it's not the Holy Ghost the Difference
[56:58] Maker is the Holy
[56:59] Ghost amen he says the gift of the Holy
[57:02] Ghost preachers are called prophets and
[57:04] teachers and evangelists and pastors and
[57:06] so forth they receive the Holy Ghost and
[57:09] then a gift to do those things with it
[57:12] that's the true gift is you have the
[57:14] Holy Ghost and then he gives you a gift
[57:16] to let him use
[57:17] you he says but God don't have any
[57:22] little itty bitty children or great big
[57:26] children they're all children to him
[57:29] that means there's no big eyes and
[57:30] there's no little

[57:50] to to be kind to him she's a slave taken
[57:54] from her family and yet she witnessed
[57:56] that there was healing from where she

[58:40] body and you're with Christ right now
[58:42] seated in Heavenly places he says if

[59:53] formed against you can prosper
[59:55] he says why our great conqueror has
[59:58] conquered every sin everything every
[1:00:01] sickness even death itself that's right
[1:00:03] we are more than conquerors in him
[1:00:07] that's our conquering powers that we're
[1:00:08] in him he says the only thing is we're
[1:00:11] seated with him in his throne looking to
[1:00:13] him as he looks over the father that's
[1:00:15] it you sisters you're a walking
[1:00:18] testimony everywhere you go you don't
[1:00:20] even have to open your mouth your long
[1:00:23] hair your modest dress your sober
[1:00:26] appearance your attitude your joy with
[1:00:29] the life that you have now is a witness
[1:00:31] wherever you go before you ever open
[1:00:34] your mouth and if you never even open
[1:00:36] your mouth people know that you're
[1:00:38] different but don't be scared to tell
[1:00:40] them you're happy with your difference
[1:00:43] you're happy with the life that you have
[1:00:45] that you have a joy and a peace and
[1:00:46] being different amen we don't have to
[1:00:48] pull away we don't have to to Sherk away
[1:00:50] from these things let me tell you there
[1:00:52] are people out there that look at us and
[1:00:54] though they don't understand they see
[1:00:56] something that they wish they had they
[1:00:58] wish they had a daughter that wasn't
[1:00:59] flaunting her body everywhere she went
[1:01:01] and showing skin all the time and making
[1:01:03] a fool of herself on social media there
[1:01:06] are young men out there that wish that
[1:01:08] there were girls that hadn't slept with
[1:01:10] 15 people before they get to them you're
[1:01:12] a witness and a testimony of a holy Life
[1:01:15] by the power of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:01:17] what you are out there brother Brown
[1:01:19] would say this he said as long as God
[1:01:21] has got a People God has got a church
[1:01:24] God has got the Holy Ghost marching with
[1:01:27] it that's what God gave the Holy Ghost
[1:01:29] for intellectuals will rise they always
[1:01:31] have but God has got a minority
[1:01:33] somewhere God's got a little church
[1:01:36] that'll move right on with the baptism
[1:01:38] of the Holy Ghost to claiming the light
[1:01:41] and they'll be the ones that through
[1:01:43] their testimony through the life that
[1:01:46] you live through the words that you
[1:01:47] speak through the things that you do day
[1:01:49] in and day out you will judge the world
[1:01:52] didn't the Bible say Jesus said blessed
[1:01:54] are the pure in heart they shall see God
[1:01:57] and doesn't it say that the just the
[1:01:58] Saints shall judge the Earth your
[1:02:01] testimony today will bring judgment
[1:02:03] against this city he says our testimony
[1:02:05] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:02:08] power of God now listen this is power to
[1:02:10] serve he says a holy life will bring
[1:02:13] judgment against the
[1:02:15] city I don't have all the quotes here
[1:02:17] tonight but brother banam would say that
[1:02:19] the Holy Ghost is power to live a holy
[1:02:23] life he said
[1:02:25] every time somebody gets the Holy Ghost
[1:02:27] a Godly life will follow not may follow
[1:02:32] not should follow will follow and that
[1:02:35] is our testimony to the world if we
[1:02:37] never say another word but it was
[1:02:39] interesting when I was in BC with my
[1:02:40] team meeting there and during one of our
[1:02:42] discussions they were talking about the
[1:02:44] state of the educational system and and
[1:02:46] this woman said she said have you heard
[1:02:48] about these people that keep their
[1:02:50] children home and school them
[1:02:52] themselves because they're see because
[1:02:54] remember we're in Hightech and they're
[1:02:57] looking around and and and I made the
[1:02:59] comment I said why is it that the
[1:03:01] brightest minds are not from Canada
[1:03:04] anymore we were talking about a
[1:03:06] particular we met with a particular
[1:03:08] client and they couldn't find their
[1:03:09] expertise in Canada they've had to
[1:03:10] import every literally every employee
[1:03:14] they had they had to import from outside
[1:03:15] of Canada overseas typically I was
[1:03:18] asking this question why is this and we
[1:03:20] had a discussion about and they said
[1:03:21] well well the Ed the state of our
[1:03:23] education system is horrible and the
[1:03:25] things they're pushing in they're
[1:03:26] forgetting the real education they're
[1:03:28] putting all this junk and and this woman
[1:03:30] said well have you heard about these
[1:03:31] people that teach their kids at home and
[1:03:33] I said right here they looked at me I
[1:03:37] said yeah we we we we School our
[1:03:40] children at home and they said how how
[1:03:43] do you do that how do you have time to
[1:03:46] do that I said well I don't I have a
[1:03:47] wife that does it I said but we made a
[1:03:52] choice we made a choice it didn't just
[1:03:55] happen I said we made a choice that she
[1:03:58] would stay home she would raise the
[1:04:00] children she'd educate them to the best
[1:04:02] of her ability and I would make enough
[1:04:05] money so she wouldn't have to work I
[1:04:07] said now we live a simple life but I
[1:04:09] said we feel it's the best thing we can
[1:04:11] do for our family and they had so many
[1:04:13] questions this is a room full of phds
[1:04:15] double phds mbas like I'm the least
[1:04:19] educated amongst all of them if there's
[1:04:20] anybody could teach their children it's
[1:04:22] these people but what is it they haven't
[1:04:24] made a choice to sacrifice for the
[1:04:27] benefit of their children yet yet they
[1:04:31] absolutely could they absolutely could
[1:04:33] any day of the week they wouldn't have
[1:04:34] to amen but they couldn't get over it
[1:04:36] and most people look at us not just with
[1:04:38] homeschooling that that that many of us
[1:04:40] do and what not and they think we're
[1:04:42] weird for it they look at our our young
[1:04:44] women and they say well you're you're
[1:04:45] suppressing them and all these things
[1:04:47] but then our daughters get to marry as
[1:04:49] virgins and we don't have pre teenage
[1:04:51] pregnancies and we have marriages at
[1:04:53] last and we have people who get jobs and
[1:04:55] stick with them and they look at that
[1:04:58] and they see the attributes of our
[1:04:59] choices and they love the attributes but
[1:05:01] they can't grasp how we got there they
[1:05:03] can't say that's what does it they think
[1:05:05] you just have it somehow your kids are
[1:05:07] better than my kids no it's because we
[1:05:10] live a life according to a holy God with
[1:05:13] a holy ghost living inside of us that
[1:05:15] makes us do it you know we don't always
[1:05:18] have to bring up
[1:05:20] Christ brother bah said if a man likes
[1:05:22] to fish talk to him about fishing
[1:05:24] we can bring up the effects of the life
[1:05:27] that we have by the Holy Ghost just in
[1:05:29] talking about day-to-day things with
[1:05:31] people and you talk about it enough and
[1:05:33] they'll say how do you do this why do
[1:05:35] you do this and then you can say it's
[1:05:37] because I'm a Christian it's because I
[1:05:39] believe that God calls us to be separate
[1:05:41] from these things it's because we
[1:05:42] believe that the world is falling apart
[1:05:44] it's because we believe that the
[1:05:46] majority of the world is insane and so
[1:05:47] we've elected to do things ourselves
[1:05:49] because we believe that's better than
[1:05:50] what the world is trying to do amen they
[1:05:53] don't understand it but they often like
[1:05:55] what they see there are still people out
[1:05:57] there that have a shred of sanity left
[1:05:59] and they see people like us and they say
[1:06:01] how do you do it that's our opportunity
[1:06:04] that's our
[1:06:05] opportunity brother Brown would say this
[1:06:07] he says and then he was made flesh and
[1:06:09] dwelt Among Us in order that he could
[1:06:11] come back again to man and live in man
[1:06:15] and restore a man to a state of
[1:06:17] communion with him again and give him
[1:06:19] back as god-given right so you got to
[1:06:21] have communion before you get back to
[1:06:22] the rights you got to be tied with him
[1:06:25] in personal relationship before you
[1:06:27] start going around Swinging The Sword
[1:06:29] amen that's what he did that's the
[1:06:31] purpose of the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:06:33] father again God the Father dwelling in
[1:06:35] you working out his plans to finish his
[1:06:41] Plan of Redemption working through you
[1:06:44] making you a co-worker with him giving
[1:06:48] you a place giving you a part for who
[1:06:52] your Fallen lost brother brother and
[1:06:54] sister giving you his sister his spirit
[1:06:57] and his love to go hunt the lost as he
[1:07:00] did in the Garden of Eden when he said
[1:07:01] Adam Adam Where Art Thou he says that's
[1:07:04] what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a
[1:07:06] woman when it strikes into their heart
[1:07:08] and takes its Abode there's a thirst and
[1:07:11] a hungering for lost
[1:07:14] souls amen can we say Amen this evening
[1:07:18] not just because we're in church but
[1:07:20] amen that yes I'm seeking to witness I'm
[1:07:23] seeking to test ify I'm seeking to bring
[1:07:25] other people to this this message this
[1:07:28] end time message to bring them to a god
[1:07:30] that's alive and well to show them that
[1:07:32] Hebrews 138 is still here amen we're
[1:07:35] talking we're going to be coming to
[1:07:36] adoption and this perception that has
[1:07:39] been around I think for so long perhaps
[1:07:41] still is that when there there there
[1:07:43] that when we come into adoption that
[1:07:45] we're going to be walking around and
[1:07:46] it's just going to be great Miracles all
[1:07:48] the time and it'll be spoken word coming
[1:07:51] from our lips on a daily basis and the
[1:07:53] dead will be raised regularly and all
[1:07:55] these things and it's all about the
[1:07:57] signs and the Wonders and and it would
[1:07:59] never be a people that get sick or in
[1:08:01] need Jesus Promised you're going to be
[1:08:04] persecuted you're going to have hard
[1:08:06] times you're going to have to bear a
[1:08:07] cross they're going to say bad things
[1:08:09] about you you're going to get sick
[1:08:12] Satan's going to try and destroy
[1:08:14] you but then he said greater is he
[1:08:17] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:08:18] world he didn't say it wouldn't be it
[1:08:21] wouldn't be tough but he says you will
[1:08:23] overcome
[1:08:25] and we can get into this thing where we
[1:08:26] think that we're just going to waltz
[1:08:28] through everything no character itself
[1:08:31] is a victory amen the very things we
[1:08:34] have we're soldiers we fight to overcome
[1:08:37] so we face opposition daily you feel it
[1:08:41] from the world in your place of work
[1:08:43] just you listen to anything you read
[1:08:45] anything you go online it's an assault
[1:08:47] on your senses it's an assault on the
[1:08:49] Peace of your
[1:08:50] mind Satan is knowing his time is short
[1:08:54] and he's pressing to hold things back
[1:08:57] amen but Jesus had talked in Mark 10
[1:09:00] about being a servant and we read it at
[1:09:03] the beginning of service and he repeats
[1:09:05] the same story in Luke 22 but he's
[1:09:08] talking to Peter afterwards he's talked
[1:09:09] about being a servant and he says to
[1:09:12] Peter he says and the Lord said unto him
[1:09:15] Simon Simon behold Satan had desired to
[1:09:18] have you that he may sift you as
[1:09:21] wheat Satan wants to do that to us just
[1:09:25] scatter us to the Four
[1:09:27] Winds he says but I have prayed for thee
[1:09:30] that thy faith fail not and when thou
[1:09:33] are converted strengthen thy Brethren
[1:09:36] now before this what happened was
[1:09:38] remember two of the disciples they
[1:09:40] wanted to be big shots and they said
[1:09:42] Lord grant to us that one would sit at
[1:09:44] thy right hand of the throne and one
[1:09:45] would sit at the left hand of the of the
[1:09:47] throne and Jesus said that's not up to
[1:09:49] me to decide here
[1:09:50] today and it wasn't amen but notice the
[1:09:53] the Holy Ghost had not been given yet
[1:09:55] and those men were interested in
[1:09:58] position in power and in
[1:10:02] Authority they hadn't been
[1:10:04] changed they wanted to be big shots in
[1:10:07] the kingdom of God they cast out Devils
[1:10:09] they'd healed the sick theyd preach the
[1:10:11] gospel of repentance but like Peter they
[1:10:13] weren't converted and so it was all
[1:10:15] about me the me monster had come out let
[1:10:19] me be something great in your kingdom
[1:10:21] and Jesus said are you sure you can
[1:10:22] drink of this cup and they said we're
[1:10:24] sure he says then you'll drink of it and
[1:10:27] sure enough they did and they died they
[1:10:30] gave their lives for the gospel later on
[1:10:32] but me they're a witness of sorts sorts
[1:10:34] but just realize that they were limited
[1:10:36] in themselves because they were so
[1:10:38] focused on self they thought that this
[1:10:40] was about them watch what brother Braham
[1:10:43] says here he says Peter said Lord I'm
[1:10:45] willing to go to death and everything
[1:10:46] with you he said Peter after you are
[1:10:49] converted strengthen your brother after
[1:10:51] you're converted well Lord I've been
[1:10:53] baptized by you Jesus Christ baptized
[1:10:56] Peter he baptized the apostles all right
[1:10:58] now he said now I've been baptized I've
[1:11:00] done all these things and I've walked by
[1:11:01] you I've saved I've been saved and you
[1:11:04] gave me power now remember what happened
[1:11:07] was Jesus gave them power over Devils
[1:11:09] over sickness and these different things
[1:11:11] amen but what was that power it was the
[1:11:15] Holy
[1:11:15] Ghost but you got to realize it's always
[1:11:19] the Holy Ghost you and we'll see this in
[1:11:20] scripture in a moment but it was on them
[1:11:23] not in them and there's a huge
[1:11:25] difference between those things amen
[1:11:27] because we know it wasn't in them
[1:11:28] because they didn't get filled until the
[1:11:29] day of Pentecost but they had power on
[1:11:32] them given to them over sickness and and
[1:11:35] and devils and these different things
[1:11:37] amen it's always been available the
[1:11:39] spirit of God has always been available
[1:11:40] in a temporary measure it's always been
[1:11:44] available go back to Samson in judges 15
[1:11:47] it says when he came unto Lehi the
[1:11:49] Philistines shouted against him and the
[1:11:51] spirit of the Lord came mightily upon
[1:11:54] Him woman minut it was there wasn't
[1:11:56] there and then the next it was and as
[1:11:58] soon as it comes on him it says the
[1:12:00] cords that were upon his arms became his
[1:12:02] flax that was burnt with fire and his
[1:12:04] bands loose from off his hands and he
[1:12:06] found a new Jawbone of an ass and put
[1:12:08] forth his hand and took it and slew a
[1:12:10] thousand men therewith so he's walking
[1:12:12] along and he's Bound by ropes and he
[1:12:14] can't do
[1:12:16] anything and then the spirit of God the
[1:12:18] Holy Spirit falls on him and he breaks
[1:12:21] them as if they were wax I don't know if
[1:12:23] you've ever tried to break something
[1:12:25] that's that's wax it says flax that's
[1:12:27] burnt with fire Not wax sorry the minute
[1:12:29] you do that then the strands just part
[1:12:31] they don't
[1:12:33] hold it was like he was he wasn't bound
[1:12:35] at all as soon as the Spirit came on him
[1:12:38] amen Samson could do amazing things when
[1:12:41] the spirit of God Came Upon him and you
[1:12:43] know what you can see this in
[1:12:45] denominations brother B would talk about
[1:12:47] anointed ones at the end times he would
[1:12:48] say it is the holy spirit but it is on
[1:12:51] an unsanctified vessel it's an impure
[1:12:53] vessel and it can do wonderful things
[1:12:55] but then they go out and they can't live
[1:12:56] a Godly life they can't live according
[1:12:58] to the word what it was on them but it's
[1:13:00] not in them and there's no power to
[1:13:02] serve there's just power to do things
[1:13:04] but that's not the power to serve we're
[1:13:05] talking about amen Peter and the the
[1:13:08] rest of the disciples had that power
[1:13:10] before they ever got converted Jesus
[1:13:12] said so that's not the
[1:13:14] conversion but it comes with it amen
[1:13:17] Samson's problem wasn't when the Holy
[1:13:19] Spirit was on him when the spirit of God
[1:13:20] was on him it was when it was off of him
[1:13:23] because Samson kept going back to women
[1:13:25] Samson problem Samson's problem was
[1:13:27] women and without the the spirit of God
[1:13:29] on him he was unable to do what overcome
[1:13:32] himself amen he was unable to yield
[1:13:35] himself completely to the purpose and
[1:13:36] the plan of God Amen and so he kept
[1:13:39] getting tripped up time after time even
[1:13:41] David with a heart after God's Own Heart
[1:13:44] without the Holy Spirit on him gets
[1:13:45] tripped
[1:13:46] up why because it's a temporary thing
[1:13:49] it's not something that's in him amen he
[1:13:51] needed something that would change him
[1:13:52] and secure him for all
[1:13:55] time listen to this he says he that
[1:13:57] heareth my
[1:13:58] words and believeth on the him that sent
[1:14:01] me hath present tense eternal life
[1:14:04] everlasting life and shall not come to
[1:14:06] the Judgment but has passed from Death
[1:14:08] to life he says the holy spirit is an
[1:14:11] experience of being filled and endued
[1:14:14] with power for what
[1:14:18] service that means something in here has
[1:14:21] to change cuz what per willingly says
[1:14:24] I'm going to
[1:14:25] serve we all want to be served carnally
[1:14:28] speaking we want to be the big shot we
[1:14:30] want to be the boss we want to be the
[1:14:32] owner we want to be the manager we want
[1:14:34] to be the CEO we want to be the one that
[1:14:35] people do things for rather than the one
[1:14:37] that does things for people he says but
[1:14:39] confession and receiving Christ is to
[1:14:41] have faith and make your confession and
[1:14:43] feel free that God has forgiven you of
[1:14:45] your sins so it's being endued with
[1:14:47] power for service amen so Peter and the
[1:14:50] disciples had the spirit of God on them
[1:14:52] but it wasn't in them it was working on
[1:14:54] them but it wasn't in their soul and so
[1:14:56] they couldn't bring themselves subject
[1:14:57] to truly do what they needed to do they
[1:15:00] were sincere men they were sons of
[1:15:03] God all along they were sons of God they
[1:15:05] were sincere throughout all of this amen
[1:15:07] they were genuine but they had only come
[1:15:09] to a place of sanctification with the
[1:15:11] power of God resting on them at
[1:15:14] times listen to this brother Brown would
[1:15:16] continue he says you wouldn't expect God
[1:15:18] to put that power in an unclean vessel
[1:15:20] so he had to clean them up and give them
[1:15:22] a life of sincerity anyhow before he let
[1:15:25] them go out and preach the gospel this
[1:15:27] is before the day of Pentecost he cleans
[1:15:29] them up he sanctifies their life he
[1:15:32] pulls them out of the world he draws
[1:15:33] them to himself he teaches them how to
[1:15:35] do things he puts the right Doctrine in
[1:15:37] their in their mouths he shows them
[1:15:39] what's possible in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:15:41] amen they were sincere but they weren't
[1:15:44] converted and that's the most miserable
[1:15:46] place for a Christian is because the
[1:15:48] life is clean but there's nothing
[1:15:49] dwelling in there and so what you end up
[1:15:52] doing is you you live a Romans 7
[1:15:55] life rather than a Romans 8 life Romans
[1:15:58] 7 is uh oh Wretched Man that I am who
[1:16:01] shall deliver me from this body of death
[1:16:03] and Romans 8 says there is therefore now
[1:16:05] no condemnation to them that are in
[1:16:06] Christ what the new creation hasn't
[1:16:09] happened yet you're sincere I mean how
[1:16:11] many people do we see if you look at the
[1:16:13] teachers from the Baptist school and
[1:16:15] these wonderful wonderful Christian
[1:16:17] people sincere sincere is all get out
[1:16:20] but without the Holy Ghost they don't
[1:16:22] even believe in it
[1:16:23] how can you have it if you don't believe
[1:16:24] in
[1:16:25] it but sincere people but can't have the
[1:16:29] victory the way that we have
[1:16:31] it he says and they returned back
[1:16:33] rejoicing said well even the devils are
[1:16:35] subject to us see and why then he said
[1:16:37] now Peter I know all this but you're not
[1:16:39] converted yet see you're not right yet
[1:16:41] Peter you're not converted but after
[1:16:43] thou are converted then strengthen your
[1:16:45] brethren Peter hadn't received the Holy
[1:16:47] Ghost yet see and when the Holy Ghost
[1:16:49] come then Peter was an inspired preacher
[1:16:53] we can compare numbers just to make this
[1:16:55] simple on the day of Pentecost there was
[1:16:57] 120 up in the Upper Room 11 of them were
[1:17:00] disciples so 109 were
[1:17:03] converts even if we give all of those
[1:17:05] converts to Peter it's 109 Peter gets
[1:17:07] the Holy Ghost preaches a 10minute
[1:17:09] sermon and gets 3,000 converts that's
[1:17:11] the difference the Holy Ghost will make
[1:17:14] Peter was an inspired teacher why now he
[1:17:16] was stepping into the purpose and plan
[1:17:18] of God as a Son of God with the Holy
[1:17:21] Ghost now he had power to served now he
[1:17:24] had power to catch the vision Peter had
[1:17:26] the keys to the kingdom given to him
[1:17:27] before he ever had the Holy Ghost but he
[1:17:29] couldn't exercise them until he got the
[1:17:31] Holy Ghost why that was his adopted some
[1:17:33] position was to take those keys and
[1:17:35] start going around amen amen until he F
[1:17:38] he was filled with the Holy Ghost he was
[1:17:40] almost useless he had his moments but he
[1:17:42] could never overcome himself he could
[1:17:45] never stand up for himself he couldn't
[1:17:46] stand up for what he believed amen and
[1:17:48] then as soon as the Holy Spirit falls on
[1:17:50] him and fills him and and seals his soul
[1:17:53] he's changed and he never turns back he
[1:17:55] never runs in fact he gives his life
[1:17:56] willingly and dies upside down on a
[1:17:58] cross just so that he wouldn't be
[1:17:59] compared to Christ considering himself
[1:18:01] not worthy he went from a man that was
[1:18:03] scared of his life to a man that
[1:18:04] willingly gave his life and chose an
[1:18:06] even worse death by dying upside down
[1:18:09] that's what the Holy Ghost will do in a
[1:18:10] man or a woman amen what was it it had
[1:18:13] settled him for life it had sealed him
[1:18:14] it had it had put the guarantee in him
[1:18:17] brother B would say he says that same
[1:18:19] group the disciples had to go to
[1:18:21] Pentecost to be baptized with the Holy
[1:18:23] Ghost he said exactly the Holy Ghost is
[1:18:26] power for service he says and the Holy
[1:18:29] Ghost is you shall receive the new birth
[1:18:31] after this he says what no you shall
[1:18:34] receive power acts 18 after this hly the
[1:18:37] Holy Ghost has come upon you see they
[1:18:39] had already believed to eternal life and
[1:18:41] so forth but they had to have the Holy
[1:18:43] Ghost for power you shall be Witnesses
[1:18:46] unto me after the Holy Ghost has come
[1:18:47] upon you because the Holy Ghost is a
[1:18:50] witness of the resurrection showing that
[1:18:52] you have become an adult in Christ amen
[1:18:57] you've grown up you've been proven
[1:18:59] consider this that this evening that
[1:19:01] without the Holy Ghost we're
[1:19:03] children in the kingdom of God Amen it
[1:19:06] doesn't mean you can't do anything
[1:19:07] useful or good but let's face it you
[1:19:09] can't trust children to do much how many
[1:19:12] of us would have a life or death
[1:19:13] situation and then hand it over to a
[1:19:15] child to manage or to take care of you'd
[1:19:18] have to be desperate it'd have to be
[1:19:19] your only choice to commit it to a child
[1:19:21] why cuz they don't have the strength
[1:19:23] they don't have the speed they don't
[1:19:24] have the discipline they don't have the
[1:19:26] focus to do something that's truly
[1:19:28] critical I mean I can tell my my
[1:19:30] youngest boy to go do something and six
[1:19:32] feet away and he just forgets what he
[1:19:33] was doing forgets what he was supposed
[1:19:35] to do and even as they get older you
[1:19:39] send them out to do something and
[1:19:40] they'll do it halfway or they'll get
[1:19:42] caught up in something they'll get
[1:19:43] distracted by something what you can't
[1:19:45] trust a child that way but when we
[1:19:48] become a man we put away childish things
[1:19:49] now God can trust us and he can use us
[1:19:52] in the Holy Ghost has given now to put
[1:19:53] us in the service of the Kingdom amen
[1:19:56] that's what its purpose is to make us
[1:19:57] useful in the kingdom of God it's not
[1:20:00] just for ourselves it does have a work
[1:20:02] obviously it has a work on on our self
[1:20:04] and on our character and these things
[1:20:06] but it's it's to give us a place where
[1:20:08] he can trust us it's to put us in a
[1:20:10] place where he knows that when he puts
[1:20:12] something in our hands we'll do what he
[1:20:13] asks us to do amen but it's not given
[1:20:15] for a show it's not given to cater to
[1:20:18] people it's not given that you tell me
[1:20:20] what you want me to do with the Holy
[1:20:22] Ghost that's not the way it works amen
[1:20:24] it's got to be inspired to me what to do
[1:20:27] by the word of God Amen its effect is to
[1:20:29] make us a willing partner with God cuz
[1:20:31] we're his hands where're his feet
[1:20:32] where're his voice where his body these
[1:20:34] different things adoption isn't us
[1:20:36] running around willy-nilly trying to
[1:20:37] speak things into existence that's not
[1:20:40] what it's about amen that's a carnal
[1:20:42] impersonation we see that all over the
[1:20:43] religious world today and it's coming
[1:20:45] into the natural world as I said last
[1:20:47] time this new fad of manifestation and
[1:20:49] these different things but we've see
[1:20:51] these people today and you've got you
[1:20:53] know the the the um Prosperity Gospel
[1:20:58] and what do they do they want luxury
[1:21:00] they want money they want big houses
[1:21:01] they want nice cars they want great jobs
[1:21:03] they want ease of living it's the exact
[1:21:06] opposite of what Christ said we were
[1:21:07] going to deal with why because they're
[1:21:10] selfishly motivated what is it they're
[1:21:12] trying to manipulate the word for their
[1:21:15] own gain rather than let themselves be
[1:21:17] manipulated by the word right they're
[1:21:20] trying to use the word for themselves
[1:21:21] rather than be us Us by the word that's
[1:21:24] what the true Christian does Amen
[1:21:25] they're trying to make it work for them
[1:21:27] rather than letting it work through
[1:21:29] them Paul would say this in Romans 8
[1:21:31] very familiar scripture he says for as
[1:21:33] many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:21:35] they are the sons of God not those that
[1:21:37] feel the spirit of God not those that
[1:21:39] dance in the spirit not those that speak
[1:21:41] in tongues in the spirit not those that
[1:21:42] enjoy it those that are led by it that's
[1:21:47] what determines the sons of God that's
[1:21:49] what determines the children of God
[1:21:50] brother Brown would say this he said God
[1:21:52] is is in his church to continue his
[1:21:55] works his Works amen that's why he sent
[1:21:59] the Holy Ghost amen that means we've got
[1:22:01] to be led by the Holy Ghost and our
[1:22:03] motives and objectives have to be
[1:22:04] selfless rather than
[1:22:07] selfish that's what it comes down to
[1:22:09] amen I'm not saying we never benefit it
[1:22:11] from it we benefit from it amen there's
[1:22:13] an effect of the Holy Ghost and it's a
[1:22:15] peace and it's a joy and it's a love and
[1:22:17] it's a rest and it's a guide and it's an
[1:22:19] inspiration it's an assurance it's a
[1:22:21] seal it's a token it's all of these
[1:22:23] things we have great benefit from it but
[1:22:25] it's given to us not just for ourselves
[1:22:27] but as Christ came to serve so we are
[1:22:30] come to serve as well amen but our if
[1:22:33] our application of the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:35] just for
[1:22:36] ourselves if it's just for me then I'm
[1:22:39] sorry but that's not the Holy Ghost
[1:22:41] working in me how can it be because the
[1:22:44] spirit of Christ will do what this what
[1:22:46] Christ did and it's to give our lives
[1:22:47] for others it's to serve others amen if
[1:22:50] you look at Jesus in his first in his in
[1:22:52] the first Temptation he had as soon as
[1:22:54] he got the Holy Ghost Satan takes him
[1:22:56] out and he tempts him and what does he
[1:22:57] do he tries to make him use his power
[1:23:00] and authority for himself he goes 40
[1:23:03] days without food and then Satan says
[1:23:07] hey if you're the Son of God turn this
[1:23:09] turn these stones into bread what you're
[1:23:12] hungry use your power for
[1:23:14] yourself and Jesus said no it's written
[1:23:17] you shall not tempt the Lord thy God
[1:23:19] then he takes him up and he says now now
[1:23:21] now come up on the temple throw yourself
[1:23:23] off and prove to
[1:23:26] me right he's trying to challenge him
[1:23:28] he's trying to say hey you're a
[1:23:29] Christian hey you're a real believer you
[1:23:31] believe in the Holy Ghost you believe
[1:23:33] that Jesus Christ same yesterday today
[1:23:34] and forever come heal my daughter that's
[1:23:37] what it would be today do something to
[1:23:39] prove yourself brother Bram says the
[1:23:42] Holy Ghost doesn't cater to anyone we're
[1:23:45] not here to put on a show we're not here
[1:23:47] to put on a show Jesus walks in to the
[1:23:50] pool of Bethesda and there may have been
[1:23:52] hundreds there he heals one
[1:23:56] one why cuz that's what God told him to
[1:23:58] do that's what he saw to do and that's
[1:24:01] what he did we're not here to play
[1:24:02] around with this and then he says and
[1:24:05] then Satan comes to Jesus he says now
[1:24:07] here here's all the kingdoms of the
[1:24:08] world he says worship me and I'll give
[1:24:10] them all to you what was he doing he was
[1:24:11] giving them an option to bypass the
[1:24:13] cross he says I'll give you what you're
[1:24:15] trying to redeem just worship me save
[1:24:18] yourself some pain use it for your own
[1:24:21] good
[1:24:22] and Jesus said' no I'm not going to do
[1:24:24] it but Satan will try and get us to use
[1:24:26] it to prove ourselves or to do something
[1:24:28] to our benefit that's not what it is
[1:24:30] it's power for service not power for
[1:24:33] personal benefit amen we can't
[1:24:36] serve here it
[1:24:40] says Paul said this you we talk about
[1:24:43] service our service comes later we get
[1:24:45] served in the Millennium we got a
[1:24:47] marriage supper of the land where we're
[1:24:48] going to get served we're going to rule
[1:24:50] and reign with Christ we got a serving
[1:24:51] time where we'll get served this is our
[1:24:53] opportunity to be like him Amen to get
[1:24:55] that but look what Paul said remember he
[1:24:57] was on that ship for 14 days hadn't seen
[1:24:59] the Sun Moon stares nothing just
[1:25:01] horrible conditions and Paul he comes up
[1:25:04] to give them a boost and he says for
[1:25:07] there stood by me this night the angel
[1:25:09] of God who I am and whom I
[1:25:12] serve Paul only had one person that
[1:25:15] mastered him and that was Christ he says
[1:25:17] I belong to him and I serve him and I
[1:25:20] serve him alone remember we read last
[1:25:23] Ser read last service where he said Paul
[1:25:25] didn't just come up and say be a good
[1:25:26] cheer he waited till the angel came and
[1:25:28] said you can tell them be a good cheer
[1:25:30] because here's what's going to happen he
[1:25:31] had to be inspired for these things so
[1:25:34] Paul says I belong to God and I serve
[1:25:36] God so who do we belong to God who do we
[1:25:38] serve God I'm not my own scripture says
[1:25:41] in second 1 Corinthians it says ye are
[1:25:43] bought with a
[1:25:44] price be not ye the Servants of
[1:25:48] men now sometimes we can get caught up
[1:25:50] in that we can get caught up in a boss
[1:25:52] that's asking us to do more and you know
[1:25:54] I remembered even when I was younger and
[1:25:57] I said to to people when I went in for a
[1:25:59] job and I did it in BC multiple times
[1:26:02] they wanted to hire me and you go into
[1:26:03] managerial positions and they expect you
[1:26:05] to work big hours and I said I'm a 40h
[1:26:07] hour a week employee if I can't get it
[1:26:09] done in 40 hours then it's not the job
[1:26:11] for me but I put down a Line in the Sand
[1:26:14] because what I don't want to be the
[1:26:15] servant to a job I don't want to be a
[1:26:17] servant to a man I don't want to be a
[1:26:19] servant to the money I laid a law down
[1:26:22] amen but here's the thing we can say
[1:26:24] well I don't do that brother John but we
[1:26:26] can become a servant to ourselves cuz
[1:26:28] I'm still a man I'm still a part of
[1:26:30] humanity it says that when it says that
[1:26:32] ye be not the Servants of men it means
[1:26:33] be not the Servants of mankind humanity
[1:26:36] and if I'm a servant to myself then I'm
[1:26:38] still in bondage and I'm not going to
[1:26:40] get very far because I'm Bound by this
[1:26:42] thinking that I have and I'm Bound by
[1:26:43] the desires of this body amen we can't
[1:26:46] serve ourselves in God Scripture says
[1:26:48] you can't serve Mammon and God at the
[1:26:50] same time you can't serve two masters
[1:26:52] because you'll love one and hate the
[1:26:53] other and what happens is if I'm in
[1:26:55] control of my life then I'll serve
[1:26:57] me but if I've died out and he's in
[1:26:59] control then I'll serve him he's the
[1:27:01] master amen the two Natures are contrary
[1:27:04] and we'll see as we get into adoption
[1:27:06] that the greatest thing you have to do
[1:27:07] is Surrender Your Will to the will of
[1:27:09] the father amen and that's by the Holy
[1:27:11] Spirit acting in our lives listen to
[1:27:13] this this is one of the most amazing
[1:27:15] quotes I've ever read he says and they
[1:27:17] that are the sons of God are led by the
[1:27:19] spirit of God he says then when the
[1:27:22] human element goes out step number one
[1:27:26] he says and the spirit of God fills that
[1:27:28] vacancy step number two where you empty
[1:27:31] yourself you empty yourself you make a
[1:27:35] choice you make a choice to lay down
[1:27:37] your life you make a choice to lay down
[1:27:39] your thinking you lay down your
[1:27:41] preferences you lay down the way you
[1:27:42] want it to do you lay down your feelings
[1:27:44] you lay down your hurts and offenses he
[1:27:47] says where you empty yourself amen then
[1:27:51] will be when the church in its power of
[1:27:53] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will
[1:27:55] walk in his steps in his power in his
[1:28:01] thoughts in his being in his moving he
[1:28:04] says you see what I mean then your
[1:28:07] thoughts will become words and words
[1:28:10] will become material he says that's when
[1:28:12] the church is in its power why because
[1:28:15] you think what he thinks you are he and
[1:28:19] he is you you've been United with Christ
[1:28:21] your thoughts are his thoughts and so
[1:28:24] all that's coming through you is what
[1:28:26] his thoughts his words his ideas his
[1:28:29] plan his
[1:28:31] purpose it's when we have emptied
[1:28:33] ourselves out and he's filled us that's
[1:28:35] when this
[1:28:36] happens what a place to be
[1:28:39] church that's a higher plane than I have
[1:28:43] found Lord help me set my feet on higher
[1:28:46] ground this evening amen we look at this
[1:28:48] and we say we're waiting on it we're
[1:28:50] wanting it amen are are you wanting it
[1:28:52] this
[1:28:53] evening I want
[1:28:55] it but you look at that and you say I'm
[1:28:57] waiting on God I believe this is why God
[1:29:00] would or brother BR would say God's
[1:29:01] waiting on you because we've got to
[1:29:03] empty ourselves we've got to make that
[1:29:06] decision we've got to lay that down on a
[1:29:08] daily basis on a greater level than we
[1:29:10] ever have before because there's this
[1:29:12] filling up that's
[1:29:14] happening and it only comes As We Lay
[1:29:16] Down and we put aside those things that
[1:29:17] matter to us amen this human mind has to
[1:29:20] let go of its controlling grasp on our
[1:29:22] decisions amen our preferences our ideas
[1:29:25] these things all have to go out and the
[1:29:26] word has to take preeminence in our
[1:29:28] approach to our day-to-day
[1:29:30] lives what is it we've got to fully die
[1:29:32] out we've got to get desperate to get
[1:29:34] out of here I me this world the prophet
[1:29:37] would preach a message called the world
[1:29:39] is falling apart it's falling apart
[1:29:41] church it's so far gone we've got to get
[1:29:44] out of here amen I want to step into a
[1:29:46] place of perfect peace and joy and rest
[1:29:49] where my mind doesn't have to go a
[1:29:50] million miles an hour
[1:29:52] brother BR would say this he says I
[1:29:54] believe it's on the road that when the
[1:29:56] church will be so wrapped in Christ the
[1:29:59] Holy Spirit mankind so away from their
[1:30:02] cells that they don't see themselves
[1:30:05] they don't have no motive but to serve
[1:30:07] God he says and their thoughts move on
[1:30:10] they refuse the things of the world they
[1:30:12] just move in the spirit they live in the
[1:30:15] spirit they move in the spirit they walk
[1:30:17] in the spirit and so fulfill the law of
[1:30:19] Christ then the love of Christ in the
[1:30:22] human heart moving in the Holy Ghost
[1:30:24] that great wonderful church will go
[1:30:26] forth with power and
[1:30:29] deity because deity will be revealed in
[1:30:32] human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing
[1:30:35] to pass the thought of their mind Paul
[1:30:38] said let this mind be in you which was
[1:30:41] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[1:30:43] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:30:47] with God now we're not presuming to be
[1:30:50] equal in that sense but if the the
[1:30:52] spirit of Christ is in us then that
[1:30:53] means there's a portion of God in
[1:30:56] us and so we don't have to put ourselves
[1:31:00] down in ourselves we're little we're
[1:31:03] nothing but with him in us now we're
[1:31:05] something and we're something that he
[1:31:07] can use amen I believe we've tapped into
[1:31:10] it at times absolutely we have I've been
[1:31:13] in in in moments in my life where I just
[1:31:16] knew I knew that I knew that I knew what
[1:31:19] I had to say and what I had to do and
[1:31:21] that it was the will of the Lord and I
[1:31:23] did it and it happened exactly as I
[1:31:25] expected why because I tapped in to what
[1:31:29] that
[1:31:30] inspiration that leadership that
[1:31:33] surrender CU it ain't always
[1:31:36] easy sometimes we got to shut up and
[1:31:38] that's not easy and sometimes we got to
[1:31:40] speak and that's not easy either
[1:31:42] sometimes we got to do sometimes we got
[1:31:43] to hold back I was listening to brother
[1:31:45] L like I said before the service and and
[1:31:48] they were talking about brother Bram
[1:31:50] said you know said he was reading that
[1:31:51] that scripture it says lay aside every
[1:31:53] weight and sin that does eily beset us
[1:31:55] and he said this brother said brother
[1:31:56] Brandon well I don't do anything he says
[1:31:58] that's your
[1:32:00] problem he says it's not what you don't
[1:32:02] what you do it's what you don't do he
[1:32:04] says he that knoweth to do good and
[1:32:05] doeth it not to him it sin you've got to
[1:32:08] be doing what he wants not just holding
[1:32:11] yourself back we can sit in our house
[1:32:14] and be holy as all get out but that's
[1:32:16] not going to do the world a bit of good
[1:32:18] that's not going to do the kingdom of
[1:32:19] God a bit of good why he needs people
[1:32:22] that can be in service that he can trust
[1:32:24] to be out in the filth and muck of this
[1:32:26] world the darkness that's there and
[1:32:28] still hold themselves above it to live a
[1:32:30] holy life he says it would be the Holy
[1:32:33] Spirit bringing to pass the thought of
[1:32:35] their mind why because his thoughts are
[1:32:37] in you now not your thoughts in you then
[1:32:40] he says and now then as soon as he gets
[1:32:43] his church in speaking conditions in
[1:32:45] other words when we he can get our
[1:32:46] thoughts in line with his thoughts our
[1:32:49] will in line with his will our our words
[1:32:52] in line with his words he says he can
[1:32:55] get his church to a place that he can
[1:32:56] flow himself through what is that going
[1:32:59] to look like brother John they will love
[1:33:02] and persuade and fellowship and then
[1:33:06] there will come an Eden not when we can
[1:33:08] just repeat Doctrine back to each other
[1:33:10] perfectly not when we can open up the
[1:33:12] scriptures and expound on any subject
[1:33:14] that anybody wants to amen not when we
[1:33:16] can dance in the spirit and speak in
[1:33:18] tongues these things are all
[1:33:20] good but he says what when Christ can
[1:33:23] flow through us and we can love like he
[1:33:27] loved that takes the holy
[1:33:29] ghost that takes the Holy Ghost he
[1:33:32] remember I read that quote he says and
[1:33:34] maybe it wasn't here maybe it was
[1:33:35] someplace else but he said there's one
[1:33:37] thing the devil can't do and that's
[1:33:39] love cuz this kind of love will lay
[1:33:43] aside what I want and do what's best for
[1:33:45] the other
[1:33:46] person
[1:33:49] amen it's amazing we've got people today
[1:33:51] they that claim they're adopted and they
[1:33:53] can't give Grace to somebody that
[1:33:54] doesn't see things the way they do they
[1:33:57] can't fellowship with somebody that's
[1:33:58] not exactly the way they are they can't
[1:34:00] be around a Believer that's not as
[1:34:02] perfect as they are so you know what it
[1:34:03] means they're
[1:34:05] alone that's what it
[1:34:07] is you've got to be able to love
[1:34:11] persuade and
[1:34:14] fellowship see we
[1:34:17] forget we're not going to heaven
[1:34:20] alone there's people going with us it's
[1:34:23] a body bride it's not just a one man
[1:34:25] show it's not just a one woman show
[1:34:27] there's going to be people go there the
[1:34:28] prophet of God says it's going to
[1:34:29] surprise you who's over there
[1:34:33] amen I think it's going to surprise us
[1:34:35] who isn't as
[1:34:36] well Christ had infinite patience with
[1:34:39] the disciples and I I kind of chuckle
[1:34:42] sometimes when I'm reading the gospels
[1:34:44] because he'll
[1:34:45] say oh ye of little
[1:34:48] faith but he always gave them the answer
[1:34:51] answer they
[1:34:52] needed he always showed them the right
[1:34:56] way he kept teaching and teaching and
[1:34:59] teaching and he had long suffering after
[1:35:02] long suffering after long suffering and
[1:35:04] patience after patience and love after
[1:35:06] love knowing knowing that they would
[1:35:09] forsake him knowing that they would deny
[1:35:12] him knowing that they would leave him to
[1:35:13] him to to the guards and these different
[1:35:15] things knowing all of these things he
[1:35:17] loved them unto the end the scripture
[1:35:19] says it never changed
[1:35:22] that's what the love of God does it has
[1:35:24] nothing to do with how you are and
[1:35:27] everything to do with what that person
[1:35:29] needs amen Peter made a lot of mistakes
[1:35:32] and God and Christ still loved
[1:35:35] him loved him gave him the keys to the
[1:35:38] kingdom Peter made a lot of mistakes but
[1:35:42] Christ looked beyond it I want to close
[1:35:44] with this one thought where're PE
[1:35:45] speaking on power to serve and I want
[1:35:48] you to see that the very attributes of
[1:35:49] the Holy Spirit as we look at those
[1:35:52] are focused on serving rather than being
[1:35:54] served if you look in Galatians 5 it
[1:35:57] says but the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:36:00] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:36:02] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:36:04] against such there is no law is love for
[1:36:08] me the world this is this is how messed
[1:36:11] up the world is is they're focused on
[1:36:13] self-love
[1:36:14] now it's the biggest thing you got to
[1:36:16] love yourself you got to take care of
[1:36:18] yourself but you fall in love with
[1:36:20] yourself and you're good to anybody else
[1:36:23] you're too busy looking in in mirrors
[1:36:25] and and being on social media and
[1:36:27] talking yourself up amen love is for
[1:36:29] somebody
[1:36:30] else love is for somebody else there's
[1:36:34] no love unless there's somebody to
[1:36:35] receive
[1:36:36] it Joy sure that's for me peace is for
[1:36:39] me but I'll tell you this I don't want
[1:36:41] to be around somebody that has no joy or
[1:36:43] peace so while it might come from me and
[1:36:45] I get the benefit of it nobody wants to
[1:36:48] be around me if I don't have some of
[1:36:49] that so it's still for other people
[1:36:52] longsuffering longsuffering ain't for me
[1:36:54] as much as I've got to have it for
[1:36:56] myself long suffering is for the other
[1:36:57] person amen gentleness that's definitely
[1:37:01] for
[1:37:02] others goodness you say well that's for
[1:37:05] yourself well what's Badness for take
[1:37:08] the opposite side Badness affects other
[1:37:09] people so goodness does too our goodness
[1:37:12] is a witness to other people and our
[1:37:13] goodness is for other people remember
[1:37:16] what they said to Jesus I read it just
[1:37:18] this morning in my devotions they said
[1:37:19] what's the greatest commandment he said
[1:37:21] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:37:23] soul mind soul and strength and these
[1:37:24] different things he says and the second
[1:37:25] is like unto it love thy neighbor as
[1:37:27] thyself goodness that's where goodness
[1:37:29] comes in not just love what about faith
[1:37:32] absolutely Faith's for me I've got to
[1:37:34] have faith for my personal walk but
[1:37:35] remember the scripture says the prayer
[1:37:36] of faith shall save the sick that means
[1:37:39] my faith has impact on you and your
[1:37:40] faith has impact on mine faith is not
[1:37:43] just for me Faith for you I got faith
[1:37:45] for the Salvation of my children amen
[1:37:47] I've got faith for the moving of God in
[1:37:48] the assembly I've got faith in all sorts
[1:37:50] of things that that affect other
[1:37:52] people then we go to meekness meekness
[1:37:55] is completely about the other person
[1:37:57] meekness is the power to do something
[1:37:59] and choosing not to do it so that's when
[1:38:01] the other person deserves something and
[1:38:03] you hold back for their sake rather than
[1:38:05] because of your righteousness because of
[1:38:07] your goodness because of anything you're
[1:38:08] doing it for their sake you have power
[1:38:11] to do something and you choose not to
[1:38:13] destroy them you choose not to rip them
[1:38:15] apart you choose not to expose them
[1:38:17] whatever that case might be Temperance
[1:38:20] that's self-control
[1:38:21] that doesn't mean just flying off not
[1:38:23] flying off the handle but it's
[1:38:24] Temperance that keeps my life under
[1:38:27] control and it's primarily focused on
[1:38:29] sensual things and sexual things and
[1:38:30] these things but it's also material
[1:38:32] things the lust of the eyes and these
[1:38:34] different things and yes that benefits
[1:38:35] Me by keeping my life clean but it
[1:38:37] definitely affects my family it affects
[1:38:39] my marriage it affects what I do at work
[1:38:41] it affects the way I spend my money all
[1:38:43] these different things so the point I'm
[1:38:44] making is you look at every one of these
[1:38:46] and at least half of them are completely
[1:38:48] externally facing and the rest of them
[1:38:51] have a major impact on the people around
[1:38:53] us the fruit of the spirit is for other
[1:38:56] people to eat I preached on this before
[1:38:58] remember the tree doesn't eat its own
[1:39:00] fruit the fruit is there for other
[1:39:03] people that tells me that the Holy
[1:39:05] Spirit itself is given for service not
[1:39:08] for
[1:39:09] selfishness amen if people don't eat the
[1:39:12] fruit what happens it rots and it drops
[1:39:15] and it does it regenerates the soil
[1:39:18] underneath the tree so there's a benefit
[1:39:19] to it but it's meant to be eaten it's
[1:39:21] meant to be used and yet somebody comes
[1:39:23] up and they take our patience and what
[1:39:25] do we do get
[1:39:26] mad that's what it's meant for they're
[1:39:28] meant to take it and because we got the
[1:39:30] Holy Ghost we're meant to grow some more
[1:39:32] so that we don't get impatient so that
[1:39:33] we don't get worried and all these
[1:39:35] different things what is it it's power
[1:39:37] to serve it's power to produce a life
[1:39:39] that can benefit the kingdom of God by
[1:39:41] serving other people that's what this is
[1:39:43] all about what in the time and season of
[1:39:45] God's Cho choosing continuing in
[1:39:48] Galatians
[1:39:50] 5
[1:39:52] he says and they that are christs have
[1:39:54] crucified the flesh with the affections
[1:39:56] and lusts so we've surrendered our will
[1:39:58] we've died to our own desires we're
[1:40:00] living by the spirit of God he says if
[1:40:02] we live in the spirit let us also talk
[1:40:04] in the
[1:40:06] spirit is that what it
[1:40:09] says let us walk in the spirit that
[1:40:12] means talk that means think that means
[1:40:15] act that means
[1:40:17] be it's the whole part of living let us
[1:40:21] walk let us live in the spirit the
[1:40:24] Amplified says if by the Holy Spirit we
[1:40:26] have our life in God let us go forward
[1:40:29] walking in line our conduct controlled
[1:40:33] by the spirit you'll find serving gives
[1:40:36] us
[1:40:38] purpose because remember the Holy Ghost
[1:40:40] is given to take you into adoption and
[1:40:42] that's the placing of the child of God
[1:40:44] and when you serve what is it you found
[1:40:46] your place you found your purpose you
[1:40:48] found your reason for being and that's
[1:40:49] what the Holy Ghost has given to you for
[1:40:52] he says in all this let us not be
[1:40:53] desirous of vain Glory provoking one
[1:40:56] another and envying one another the
[1:40:58] Amplified says let us not become vain
[1:40:59] glorious and self-conceited competitive
[1:41:02] and challenging and provoking and
[1:41:04] irritating to one another envying and
[1:41:07] being jealous of one another so the Holy
[1:41:10] Ghost is not given to make us at edge
[1:41:12] with one another that I'm competing for
[1:41:14] your spot and you're competing for my
[1:41:15] spot that you're trying to be better
[1:41:17] than I am in the same thing no the the
[1:41:20] Holy Spirit causes us to work together
[1:41:23] amen every time every time otherwise one
[1:41:26] of us or both of us is out of our
[1:41:28] position but I want to finish with one
[1:41:31] simple quote here and we've been talking
[1:41:32] about why the holy spirit's given and we
[1:41:34] know it's to serve and we know that we
[1:41:36] serve God and he directs us and he leads
[1:41:38] us by the Holy Spirit and he causes us
[1:41:40] to do things that we could never do on
[1:41:42] our own and it causes us to do things we
[1:41:44] never want to do on our own many times
[1:41:47] but a servant's heart is always one to
[1:41:48] help and if you've been given author
[1:41:50] Authority if you've been given orders to
[1:41:52] do something we're not supposed to stand
[1:41:54] off amen we're supposed to get in there
[1:41:55] and we're supposed to do whatever we can
[1:41:58] do to the the ability and the
[1:41:59] responsibility that we've been given but
[1:42:02] listen to this final
[1:42:04] quote see we talk about the
[1:42:08] Supernatural and yet brother Braham says
[1:42:10] we go out and we got a temper to fight a
[1:42:12] buz
[1:42:13] saww see we look at the big
[1:42:17] things but the Simplicity of a
[1:42:19] day-to-day life is escaped so many times
[1:42:22] I want you to listen to this very
[1:42:23] carefully as we start to close he says
[1:42:26] if there's anything we ought to be is
[1:42:28] kind to one
[1:42:31] another when you see a brother or sister
[1:42:34] in fault don't never breathe it to
[1:42:36] nobody keep it to yourself and pray for
[1:42:39] that person be kind to
[1:42:42] them he says and if the spirit of God is
[1:42:46] in you then you will be kind to one
[1:42:48] another Jesus said I come to do thy will
[1:42:51] father and we are about the Master's
[1:42:54] business as he was about the father's
[1:42:55] business and the same spirit that he had
[1:42:58] to begin the works of the father and to
[1:43:01] finish the atonement he says it was to
[1:43:03] make a way that we could carry the
[1:43:05] message and if that spirit's in you
[1:43:08] you'll have the same attitude towards
[1:43:11] people trying to do what you can to help
[1:43:15] them no matter who they are or where
[1:43:18] they are you'll try to help people amen
[1:43:21] he says that's kind of strong but that's
[1:43:24] the truth amen God bless you stand if we
[1:43:27] would the musicians can come then we
[1:43:29] know that he says you can do everything
[1:43:32] you can do to help
[1:43:33] them our help is not the same as worldly
[1:43:36] help our help is what you want is what
[1:43:39] I'll give you because we've got to give
[1:43:41] them a word help and then we've got to
[1:43:44] be able to give them the truth we've got
[1:43:45] to be able to do what's best for them if
[1:43:47] somebody's out there and they're
[1:43:48] spending all their money on on big toys
[1:43:50] and and the latest equipment and
[1:43:52] technology and all these things and they
[1:43:54] got no no time for groceries no money
[1:43:56] for groceries and they say brother John
[1:43:57] I need money for groceries I'm not going
[1:43:59] to give them money for groceries I'm
[1:44:01] going to say sell all the silliness that
[1:44:02] you bought and go buy your own groceries
[1:44:04] amen the help to them is not to give
[1:44:05] them what they want is to give them what
[1:44:07] they need which is sound advice to
[1:44:08] change the way they're living amen so
[1:44:10] when it comes to this help amen we don't
[1:44:13] love people as they want us to we love
[1:44:16] people as they need to that's what Godly
[1:44:17] love does it loves them the way they
[1:44:19] need it not just the way they want it
[1:44:21] now that doesn't mean we can't give them
[1:44:23] what they want somebody needs a hug we
[1:44:24] can give them a hug but they may need
[1:44:26] more than that to come out of where
[1:44:27] they're at a hug may not do the job amen
[1:44:29] and if we've got a servant's heart it's
[1:44:31] going to be for their best interest not
[1:44:33] just what's easy for
[1:44:34] us you know brother John Andy may be
[1:44:38] watching this but you know I I I um when
[1:44:41] I was in BC and we went to Victoria and
[1:44:44] I got up at 5:15 that morning and we
[1:44:46] left the hotel at 5:45 we went all day I
[1:44:49] was driving back and forth and the ferry
[1:44:51] got delayed and we landed late and it
[1:44:53] was just perfect the way it worked out
[1:44:54] because a couple people canel our their
[1:44:56] trip with us the day before and so we
[1:44:59] could fit in one vehicle in the end we
[1:45:00] thought we were going to need two but we
[1:45:01] could fit in one but we brought two so
[1:45:04] when we got to the to the ferry when it
[1:45:06] landed or just before I said can you
[1:45:08] take them back to the hotel and save me
[1:45:09] an hour of driving I want to go down and
[1:45:11] meet somebody in in Washington and he
[1:45:14] said yes absolutely do it but I'll say
[1:45:16] this in my body I did not want to go do
[1:45:19] that I didn't want to go do it I was
[1:45:22] tired not feeling well not sleeping well
[1:45:24] hadn't been eating I didn't want to go
[1:45:26] do it but you know what I want to be in
[1:45:30] Fellowship I want to go encourage other
[1:45:32] people and I'm a minister and a minister
[1:45:36] serves they do what's best for the other
[1:45:39] person not for themselves so I hiked
[1:45:41] myself down there and I went and I got
[1:45:43] the last 15 minutes of the service and
[1:45:45] and got up and said a few words at
[1:45:47] brother John's request and prayed and
[1:45:49] then had some fellowship and went home
[1:45:50] home and what was it it was to serve not
[1:45:53] because I didn't enjoy it but in in all
[1:45:57] honesty I probably would have preferred
[1:45:58] to be laying in my hotel and catching
[1:46:00] some z's cuz I was completely exhausted
[1:46:01] by that point but for their sake I went
[1:46:05] down yes I love them yes they're good
[1:46:07] Brothers yes I like to fellowship with
[1:46:09] them but I get Fellowship a lot but for
[1:46:12] their sake I went down and sure it did
[1:46:15] me some good and I enjoyed it but I did
[1:46:18] it for their sake not for mine and and
[1:46:20] that's what a servant's heart looks like
[1:46:22] is even when you're tired Jesus how many
[1:46:24] times was he tired you know we watch
[1:46:25] that chosen thing and that it's so
[1:46:27] beautiful that scene where they're
[1:46:29] talking about who's going to be the
[1:46:30] greatest in the kingdom and then what
[1:46:31] happens is Jesus comes from left Center
[1:46:33] left stage and he comes in and he's got
[1:46:35] blood on him and he's stumbling and he
[1:46:37] can barely walk because he's worn out
[1:46:40] from working with the people all day
[1:46:44] amen what are we tired about at
[1:46:48] night is it from serving
[1:46:51] others or is it just from serving
[1:46:53] ourselves now listen I look around I see
[1:46:56] this kind of church we're not serving
[1:46:58] ourselves I mean brother Dale came out
[1:47:00] and did all the snow clearing himself
[1:47:01] yesterday right didn't even use a
[1:47:03] snowblower brother Dale right what is it
[1:47:06] a servant's heart right and he he
[1:47:10] doesn't even like me saying this over
[1:47:11] the pop but I know because his face is
[1:47:12] turning
[1:47:14] red but you know what we need to thank
[1:47:16] people for when they do those things but
[1:47:18] it's a servant's heart and our trustees
[1:47:20] and our deacons in that brother Matt and
[1:47:22] of course brother Mark temporarily and
[1:47:24] brother Joe and these things are
[1:47:25] musicians they serve it's a servants
[1:47:28] heart why because they know their place
[1:47:31] they know they've been called to do
[1:47:33] these things and that's what the Holy
[1:47:35] Spirit does is it takes you to a place
[1:47:37] where you know this is what I'm supposed
[1:47:39] to do and sometimes listen a gift of the
[1:47:43] spirit is
[1:47:45] helps and every single one of us can
[1:47:47] help amen it's not just give Gifts of
[1:47:50] healing and Gifts of faith and Gifts of
[1:47:52] tongues and Gifts of ministering and no
[1:47:54] there's a gift of helps as well and it
[1:47:56] is no less a gift of the spirit than
[1:47:58] speaking in tongues then interpretation
[1:48:01] then ministering then healing then Faith
[1:48:04] remember there's no little bitty
[1:48:05] children in the Kingdom we're all one
[1:48:08] we're all the same filled with the same
[1:48:10] spirit in the same body amen amen the
[1:48:14] spirit brother Brandon would say this
[1:48:15] and again for the sake of time I didn't
[1:48:18] bring it tonight but he said there is he
[1:48:20] says the Holy Spirit he says his power
[1:48:22] in prayer its power in speech and its
[1:48:26] power to live a holy life I like that
[1:48:29] that you can go to God and you can be
[1:48:32] inspired by the spirit to pray for his
[1:48:33] will that you can say the right thing
[1:48:36] and that you can live a life that's
[1:48:37] above reproach amen power to do what
[1:48:41] serve him to bring our spirit to bring
[1:48:43] our nature to bring our mind under his
[1:48:46] control for his glory for his purpose
[1:48:48] for what he would have done in this time
[1:48:50] and in this season amen God help us to
[1:48:53] be quick and to it church that we're not
[1:48:55] just living life we're not just walking
