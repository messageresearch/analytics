let's turn to zear Zariah 4 we'll start at verse 6 all right verse six then he answered and he spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zeruel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zuub with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth all right you may be seated all right part three of Nehemiah and again we're still building the foundation okay the journey is hard but the destination is worth it I promise um the more I dig into this the more I am thankful that I am laying this large of a foundation because a lot of this is going to pay dividends when we finally talk about Nehemiah we mentioned Nehemiah once tonight okay we at least mention him one time right so we're getting closer so um let's get started uh so there's going to be a lot of scriptures um so I'm I'm got them all up here so you don't have to go through all them if you want to read it's up to you but uh no pressure okay so let's do a quick review uh last time we had a much smaller crowd I think Joe's family and John's family were were gone last time so um we'll just do a quick review to bring everyone up to speed all right so uh last time we went through essentially from uh the time of Jezebel up until uh the end of the seven years captivity when uh the children of Judah and Benjamin were essentially sent into slavery and were brought to Babylon so things started badly once Solomon fell into idolatry uh through the um causes of his foreign wives to are pagans and he broke the Commandment that Moses made of not multiplying women unto himself and for bringing Pagan wives into Jerusalem and he not only brought them in but he also tolerated it and made allowance for it by building temples for his wives and he started the the process that we see um the children of Israel go through we went through Ahab and how Jezebel essentially was the cause of the worship of Baal to come first into the 10 tribes which are called Israel and because of that you you see uh idolatry being something that was just happened amongst the people to it being mandated by the government and being enforced by the government so you had that combination of the political power with the religious power and when you combine those two it's absolute tyranny and it was death to a lot of Believers okay and that's where we see there came to a point where there was only 7,000 Believers in all of Israel out of all those people so it got to a dark point where the the spirit of Jezebel just had a grip on that entire Kingdom and through joh jehoshaphat's mistake when we go down into the uh children of Judah and Benjamin he started Mak lines with Ahab and that brought those two houses together and there was familiarity between those two houses and due to that they made a strategic decision to marry jeet's son to Jezebel's daughter okay and that's how we see the introduction of Baal come into the children of Judah and Benjamin and we see Judah goes from having good Kings you you see them struggle every so often but you you really don't see you don't see any mention of bail in Judah up until Jezebel and ethia come on the scene when that happens you see Judas just just completely gets sold out to baale and it's just it's a very rapid decline into absolute heathenism paganism and every vile and disgusting thing you can imagine it's just they went from the worship of Jehovah to the absolute pig sty it was just it was insane how you went from uh David to manasse who was offering his own children on on an altar and burning them alive with fire in a very very 200e period very short period of time you see David writing the Psalms to child sacrifice in Jerusalem just an absolute crazy uh decline into sin and that was from the spirit of Jezebel coming into Judah and bringing Baal in so from then on Manasseh was the Apex of of sin in Judah okay up until there was Grace God was sending uh prophets he was sending Isaiah and Jeremiah and this these these Kings would not heed okay and it came to the point where manasse went so far the Bible describes that the the the blood of the innocent ran through the streets of Jerusalem through his actions he was an absolute ruthless idolator absolutely ruthless so from then on in scripture God always describes that Judah is written off due to the sins of this one king manasse okay it was game over it was done no Grace remaining judgment was coming and from then onward you see in scripture you see mention of in Isaiah and Jeremiah that judgment is coming judgment is coming judgment is coming and then Jeremiah when he comes on the scene it's a it's a done deal okay there there's no more grace and Jeremiah is saying you're going to be sold into the land of Babylon for 70 years and I will bring you back unto myself so we see the first attack come against uh against Jerusalem in the year 1607 and that's when we see Daniel and the three Hebrew children and this is when all the prime of of Judah just gets gutted and gets sent to Babylon right and the reason before that is is quite smart from a a natural point of view if you want to completely crush a nation never allow it to rise again you take the Brain Trust you take the prime you take all the smart people all the uh the talented people and you send them away that way you just got a bunch of you know Farmers you got a bunch of people who are not really you know Wise in the ways of politics and and conniver and they won't rise up again so you see with each attack they take away more and more they're just being stripped down to the bone nothing is left so Daniel gets sent off into Babylon after first attack um Nebuchadnezzar comes back with this with a second attack against Jerusalem that's when they take away Ezekiel and bring him um to the land of Babylon not to the city of Babylon but he was outside uh in another city ministering to the Jews there and then finally you see Jerusalem destroyed in the year 1587 and that's where we see um the whole the the city is ripped to shreds all the walls are torn down you see absolute devast station because the the Babylonians essentially starve them to death they set up a Siege around the city and they just let everyone starve to death and that's where jerus um Jeremiah prophesied the whole thing about plague and famine and all these things that that was when it was fulfilled in the city of Jerusalem it was just it was a miserable time you didn't do not want to want to be there during that point it was very reminiscent of what happened when uh Jerusalem fell again to the Romans after Jesus uh rose again that it was the same type of vation you know parents eating their children Etc it was just terrible so the temple gets stripped of all the treasures all the gold is ripped from the walls and then the temple is completely burned and all the treasures that were in the temple go to Babylon and this is where the Ark of the Covenant is just lost to history they they they just don't know what happened to it so finally all these uh uh the the final wave of uh slaves gets sent away to Babylon and that's where we see Jeremiah goes down into Egypt and eventually he dies they say he gets stoned to death at some point and you have the 70-year period where you have Daniel essentially is essentially the main character during these 70 years where he deals with Nebuchadnezzar he deals with Bazar with the the the hand on the wall and then the finally the the fall of Babylon to the Persians and this is where you see Darius the Meade come in and he's dealing with the Persians for that little period and then finally we come to the 70th year 537 which is when Cyrus the Great comes on the scene so this is where we left off and this is where we'll proceed to the next part so when they left Jerusalem the last wave of Jews leaving way this is how they left it this was the last thing they they saw when they left the whole place burning okay and this was a sober period of idolatry in Israel in Judah death famine flame so this was a very Stark reminder to the Jews of this is the end result of sin this is this is you reaping what you have sown and this is what going to happen if you don't obey me this is what happens when you allow these things into your life and you allow them to fester and you tolerate it and you don't burn it out immediately and you allow it to grow and grow this is the end result and it's not a pretty sight so uh the so this is this is a a stark reality and it it was quite depressing because Solomon's Temple was was glorious it was it was the it was one of the wonders of the world and it was they say if they rebuilt it today it would cost between three billion to6 billion dollar that's how much it would cost that that was how much gold was overlaid it was an absolute Masterpiece peoples of the world will come to it it was that amazing that's why you see the Queen of Sheba coming because it was just a marvelous thing and you have Solomon on top of it and then you have this and his Devastation so as we know is this the end no it's not what it is it's an opportunity for I will restore and God is a master at chaos taking chaos and brooding over it allowing life to come forth he it's that that's when the God's light bursts the brightest it's because he can take the impossible and make it live again and it's God's grace because it's just in man sight this is the kingdom is done you look at Nineveh the the the the capital of Assyria it was the greatest nation at that time they ruled for a thousand years and then the Babylonians came in and it becomes a wasteland it becomes buried in hundreds of feet of sand and they only found it recently that's how that without God that's that's what happens to Jerusalem buried in years of sand but you look at today is a thriving place where you know they don't have the temple yet but they will soon have it and it's just this is grace of God so the next phase that we're we're entering now is you you went from idolatry ending in judgment and now they have hit the bottom of the barrel okay there's nothing to go there's no direction to go but up and now this is the time of restoration right so restoration means the action of returning something to our former own Corner place or condition right and this process of restoration would would come through three phases so the there was three waves of the Jews out of Jerusalem and Judah and then three waves back from Babylon into Jerusalem right and he would use three three men all right and those three men were zerubabel Ezra and neamiah and each each phase of Exiles returning from Babylon had a distinct job and purpose because zerubbabel's job was to restore the temple Ezra's job was to restore the law and R applies the token in such a way that is quite um it's quite Stark but when you realize how far the the Israelites went through idolatry you see why Ezra was so so hard with sin and then the finally uh Nehemiah Nehemiah uh his job was to restore the wall okay and this was the three phases of God 's restoration so restoration tends to be a slow process it's not a typically a fast thing it's not like a miracle where you you are from this to to to complete healing it's usually a very line uponline a very slow a very purposeful process right and you look in our lives there there's certain things where God takes it quick and there's certain things that he takes slow right and there's things in our lives that for whatever reason it just takes slower for God to restore them and God's constantly constantly working on every area of your life as you allow him okay because God's a gentleman he's not not going to come in like a tyrant and kick the doors down he is a gentleman right and he's a gentle husband and father and he will ask permission right and it's free will that's where Free Will is still uh has a place because you can brother BR says it God will work with whatever you give him and sansim is probably the the the most clear and distinct example of this where he gave God his gift but he didn't give God his heart right and and there's there's a there's a great degree of blessing that comes with giving God everything you look at someone like Elijah God loves Elijah and you see to the point where there was such an obedience there that God uses that same Spirit five different times because it's so yielded himself to the word of God and to the leading of the Lord whereas you look at someone like Samson when you don't give God everything pain and trial and tribulation follows you okay because if you're seed you'll finally get there and you look at someone like Sam uh Samson he finally got there let me die with my enemies that was when he finally surrendered everything and he finally was of great use not just of some use but of great use so if you want to be a effective if you want to be of use to the kingdom of God you have to yield but there's also Grace for that yielding he doesn't require a total yielding all at once you if you read the the the sermon that brother B does door and doors it's a a great sermon about how God just there's there's there's all these doors and eventually he starts knocking on all them and there's certain things that he he doesn't work on everything all at once because it's it's too much for the human Spirit to handle if he worked on everything all at once we' be all running away as fast as we could because we're human it's just the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak all right and there's Grace for that there is Grace for that and he's patient with you he's a lot more patient with you than you are with yourself and certainly a lot more patient than other people that than with you you know it's just God's grace to us because you know I look at myself like I have no patience for myself like you I'm constantly being myself like why AR am I further ahead but God has perfect time and there's there's reasons for why cuz if at the end of the day there's a certain place where we need to to get at before we go and the bride is not going to be this defeated tail between its legs lackluster weak frail fatigued bride she's going to be without blemish she's going to be glorious she's going going to be Victorious and she'll be shining like the stars and that's going to happen here not over there it's going to happen here and there's a certain process that each and every one of us has that will get us there and Dad's process is not going to be my process because Dad has a different set of issues than I do brother Mark for those listening um so there's certain things that God requires of of brother Mark that he doesn't require of me and vice versa because each and every one of us has a different place and a different purpose zerubbabel's purpose was what restoring the temple if he tried to restore the walls he was out of the will of God and he would have been punished and vice versa if Nehemiah tries to go ahead of God and restore the temple without zuub doing it he would have been out of the plan of God because it doesn't matter if you have the desire for it or if you have the ability for it it doesn't matter what Iota are you the right person at the right time with the right leading with the Holy Ghost inside of you those all those things have to line up in order for you to have purpose and to be effective I can't do brother Joe's job and brother Joe can't do my job and there's Grace for that and you got to respect it and you got to stay in your lane and you can't keep on saying you know why aren't you doing more because God is over everything and Joe answers to God he doesn't answer to me and vice versa so that's why you can't look look at the arm of Flesh that's why you can't I can't look at Joe and and and criticize for where he not where he's at you you know what I mean Joe is a great guy right he's a wonderful boss and brother and friend um so the main thing here is that restoration is a process and it starts the moment you say I surrender and it ends when you either croak or you go in a Rapture that's the bookends there's no there's no breaks there's no as much as we would love it just vacations from the restoration process because he has to get us Rapture Ready okay so you know the the scripture here just kind of summarizes everything we're saying here is that in Isaiah Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here little and their little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest worth you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they will not hear okay so moving on you know the the where it's applicable for us is you know brother Bram says here in the the seven Church age book uh the resume of the Ages which is the summary he says but in the age in which each lived so in each of the the first six Church Ages was not the age of restoration neither was any age but this last age the age of leosa the age of complete blackout in apostasy this is the age of apostasy and this is the age of restoration is the age of the finished cycle with this it is all over all right so we are in the season of restoration we're at the point where everything has been restored in terms of the word and now it's time for us to get into our positional places right and it's just it what and what that requires is a very simple thing brother Rand gives two directions in terms of getting to a place where you'll be ready read your Bible and pray and somehow those two very simple things are the hardest things to do day in day out it should be the simplest thing but it's the hardest thing okay and what and what that does is that that means that you're laying in the presence of the Sun and he's baking out that greenness that immaturity that's inside of you because what gets into the kingdom character that's the only thing you're bringing with you and that's what he's trying to build within you with this restoration process is that gradual growth that line upon line how does a tree grow one ring at a time its only job is to soak up so it can push out and with each time it does that there is another ring of growth that that that is produced and it's a very slow process if you try to watch a a tree grow it's very boring because it's very slow but over time it grows and it not only does it grow out it grows down and that's the most important thing that it grows down and it the roots go down and it clutches the Bedrock because if it grips onto the Bedrock it doesn't matter what happens up top as long as he's grabbing down below nothing's going to hurt it okay so that's what our job is our job is to grow down soak up the word of God and push out the attributes of the spirit okay and there's different seasons there's times where you're not going to have much fruit there because it's a different season okay so that's why you you you got to have Grace for yourself and don't look at yourself based on your own standard because your standard is not the word of God your standard is supposed to be the word of God okay and there is dry seasons and then there's wet Seasons if you have a constant state of wet time of revival time where you're feeling the Holy Spirit fully in your life constantly what happens you're going to drown but you need the dry why do you need the dry the dry forces your roots down it forces you down otherwise you're going to be a shallow tree and we don't want to be shallow Believers okay because the first instance that you have some storm or a period where someone is not nice to you or doesn't shake your hand say God bless you in the right way that you think they should then you're all in a fluster but that's why God has to put you through these dry seasons where you don't feel his presence so much it's because it's forcing you down into the roots it's forcing you down to the Rock and because then you're no more children tossed to and fro you want to be able to handle those Seasons where it's just you don't need much not not that you don't need the present but you don't require God always giving you what you think you need all all the time he wants mature children okay so the end goal of where this restoration for us is you know the purpose of brother br's Ministry was what to to restore the the the faith of the children back to the fathers and what was it the faith of the fathers it was that first church the book of Acts church right and what you saw there was full Liberty those first from 8033 to 8053 you had full word you had full dominion and that's where we got to get at it is Dominion where you have full dominion over your life over your home and you're in charge and the devil knows it and you know it that way you know at that point that you you and your father are one and that's that's really where restoration is has to culminate all right so let's get into it so Cyrus the Great was the was the tool by which um God was going to use to bring restoration to Israel okay so cus the great was the first official Persian king because you got to remember the the when Babylon was was destroyed and King Bethal shazar was killed it the kingdom wasn't just the Persians it was the mes and the Persians right so then that's why the first king was Darius the me and he's the one that you see throws Daniel into the lion's den and all that stuff and there was Grace I believe for Darius you know you see his heart was tender towards Daniel but Cyrus is the first official Persian king all right fully Persian because they eventually defeated the mes so if we uh read in isra one here now in the first year of cus King of Persia that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the seven years of captivity the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying thus saith Cyrus King of Persia the Lord of God of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the Earth and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there among you of all his people his God be with them and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build a house of the Lord God of Israel he is the god uppercase God which is in Jerusalem right so what's what's uh quite interesting about Cyrus is that he was mentioned nearly 200 years before by the prophet Isaiah by name and Isa isah essentially stated that Cyrus was going to be the shepherd upon which Israel would be essentially hered back to Jerusalem so his declaration here is that God is the god and I will I have been commanded by him to build him a house to restore the temple in Jerusalem so that initiates the process of um the Jews are being gathered to go Cyrus gives all the the treasures to the Jews to bring back to Jerusalem so all the treasures that were stolen from the temple by Nebuchadnezzar Cyrus gives all of it back to the Jews to bring back with them to put it in the temple so the leader sorry the the leader of this wave of Exiles was a name called uh was a man called zerubabel and there's two names for zerubu that you'll see here in Ezra the the first one is zerubabel the second one is shes which is a very exotic name but it's interesting how both names coincide because zerubabel means a stranger at Babylon dispersion of confusion so confusion being eradicated is essentially what his name means shesh Bazar means joy and tribulation okay you almost see like one name it's almost like uh God knew exactly what was going to happen to zuub and it plays out exactly so he's he's U given the title of governor of Judah he's named The Leader by Cyrus as they go back into Jerusalem and zuub is is a real key figure because he's if you look in Zechariah he's typed as Christ not only coming in uh the time of Christ but also in the seven Church ages you know there's things where it's you know brother brandham is essentially one of the things that are listed in relation to Z to zerubabel it's quite interesting we don't have time to get into it but it's quite interesting so he was the grandson of uh one of the last kings of Judah so he he's in the line of Christ so he's one of the ancestors of that's listed in the New Testament so their Journey takes them back to Jerusalem and it's nearly 900 miles it takes 4 months for them to Journey from Babylon to Jerusalem so it's a grueling Journey it's uh you know fraught with danger and they make it back okay and when you remember when they when they left everything was in flames and when they come back it's it was a crushing disappointment because this once glorious city and land is essentially in Ruins it's you know riddled by thieves and vagrants and you now have the Samaritans and all these people kind of coming in and they're they they're essentially squatters right correct was everywhere the priesthood was corrupted everything was vile and it's just it's the bottom of the barrel so the the Mandate that zul is given is is to rebuild the Temple that's his one job his job is not to rebuild the walls his job is not to you know eliminate corruption his job is not any of those things his one job that he's given is rebuild the Temple at all costs no matter what happens build the temple so like we alluded to earlier the Solomon's Temple at that time was was an incredible piece of architecture it's it's covered in Gold it's you know like I said it was nearly three to6 billion dollar in value in terms of what they put into it and when it was built the dedication of the of the temple was was an absolute miraculous event all right because when um they brought the Ark of the Covenant into the holy of holies which is in the back in the very back there you can see it on the left there once they put the Ark of the Covenant in the temple the Shan Glory comes down and fills the entire place so the essentially a cloud like the one that was in the when they were leaving Egypt essentially fills the whole Temple completely Solomon does a sacrifice and God answers it from heaven with fire and it burns the entire thing and the shikan glory was so strong that the priests could not Minister anymore they couldn't speak the the the the atmosphere of the Lord was so strong so it was an absolute miraculous event and from then on you know it was there was a daily sacrifice the atonement had to occur there the the temple was an insanely important structure okay why because the the presence of God was in the temple that's where God chose to dwell was in that building in the holy of holies so without that there there was no atonement and what is atonement it is the the the the acceptable sacrifice of sin in God's eyes and without that atonement they're lost so it it it it's it's the number one thing that God is saying you have to do this so the temple is a three-chambered building so you remember there's the outer Court there's the inner court and then the most holy of holies and you know we see how it types back to us and we'll get into it in a second um if you read here in Acts 7 but Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as sayith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot still what house will you build me sayth the Lord or what is the place of my rest and we read here in the seven Church age book Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was man the temple okay so anything that happens to the Jews physically happens to the Gentiles spiritually all right so the the the place of God's dwelling and the place of God's rest in Old Testament times was the temple and after the temple was finally destroyed God is saying through Jesus and the first church is that the the the place of his dwelling at that point was man's heart right we are the temple of God that's where he has chosen to what to dwell not a building not a church man man's heart right all right moving right along so they arrive back in Jerusalem and they all each one of them go goes to their cities they get everything cleaned up and then they gather into Jerusalem to start building the the temple right so Ezra 3:1 and when the seventh month was come and the children of Israel were in the city ities the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem then stood up Joshua the son of josc and his Brethren the priest and zerubabel the son of shiti and his Brethren and builded the altar of the god of Israel to offer burnt offerings thereon as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God and they set the altar upon his bases for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries and they offer burnt offerings thereon to the Lord even burnt offerings morning and evening they kept also also the Feast of the Tabernacles at is as is written and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the custom as the duty of every day required and afterward offered the continual burnt offering both of the new moons and of the set feasts of the Lord that were consecrated and everyone that willingly offered a free will offering unto the Lord from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord but the foundation of the Temple of the Lord was not yet laid so the key phrase there is the one that's underlined for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries and fear was a dominating Factor here of this first wave okay and it gets them in trouble so finally after they get all of these um the altar rebuilt and they start doing the sacrifices again then they finally begin the work of building the foundation of the Lord so you got to remember the temple is totally in Ruins there's not a single Stone left lying upon each other it's not a small job okay it's huge Stones you see them today Mom and Dad saw them and brother Bob and uh C Brenda where you go to the The Wailing Wall the the stones are massive just crazy amount of weight per per Stone so it's not a simple job what they're doing so they begin building the foundation and we see in verse 8 now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God of Jerusalem in the second month began zerubabel the son of shiel and josua the the son of josc and the of their Brethren the priests and the Levites and all they that were come out of the Captivity unto Jerusalem and appointed the Levites from 20 years old and upper to set forward the work of the house of the Lord so let's skip down to verse 10 and when the builders laid the foundation of the Temple of the Lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the Levites the son of Asaf with symbols to praise the Lord after the ordinance of David king of Israel and they sang together by course and praising and giving thanks unto the Lord because he is good for his mercy and endureth forever toward Israel and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the Lord because of the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid so this is a hugely significant moment right because the Cornerstone has been laid the foundation it means that worship is coming back to the to Jerusalem the presence of God and this is why they're they're bringing out the musicians and the symbols and and the timal and all these things but there are those who remember the original Temple and the glory of that original Temple and the glory of the dedication of that Temple and then remember stories about it and how it was this amazing thing and they remember all these things and if we go to verse 12 but many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid Before Their Eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for Joy so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of Joy from the noise of the Weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud short with a loud shout and the noise was heard a far off so this is a this is a Bittersweet moment for the children of Israel right because this second temple was was not as large as solon's Temple wasn't as Grand as Solomon's Temple you didn't have it like the gold and all these things they had the treasures but they didn't have this this um because you remember with with David DAV David uh stored up resources he all the treasure everything he got was going into the temple that rubal did not have that luxury so it was a a much more modest and humble um essentially Temple so as things go any work of God that happens is going to have opposition because Satan does not like restoration he does not like anything good he doesn't like when someone 's life is going well he is he is a Tormentor he he kills Steals and destroys that that's his number one goal and you see here that the work of God is finally happening everyone's excited they're all worshiping you have a revival going on and you have opposition rise up and not only does it rise up it's a it's a powerful resistance that happens here it's no small thing that happens against them and we'll see here how it goes so verse uh yeah chapter 4 verse one now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of cap of the Captivity builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel so let's pause there so the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin are who they are the Samaritans and the Samaritans if you remember were the were the result of the um the 10 tribes of Israel Maring into to the kingdom of Assyria because the king of Assyria the son of sakb sent all these men into the 10 tribes of Israel and married into their women okay and what happened is that they had this this you had the the mother who is a believer of Jehovah you have the father who is a pagan and you have this weird mixture of the worship of Jehovah and also idolatry okay and they did what they were commanded by Moses not to do marry the heathens of the land okay because immediately you see the result of it and the Samaritans from then onor were a thorn in Judah side because they always thought they had a right to Jerusalem because they were they were also half Jewish but they were not willing to let go of their idolatry and you see that zerubabel you see Nehemiah there's no tolerance for it they the they're not willing to have any Fellowship whatsoever with the Samaritans because there are they disobeyed the law of Moses they're not willing to give up their idolatry and they're essentially you can't mix man and God and God cannot accept it he won't accept it he won't tolerate it and the moment that zerubu lets it in you have the exact same thing that happened happening again and you see what the children of Israel there's no tolerance verse two then they came to zerubabel and to the chief of the fathers and said unto him let us build with you for we seek your God as you do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of asah hardan king of Asher or Assyria which brought us up hither so they're saying you know we want to worship with you we want to help build the temple but you see here at the beginning it says the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin so they're coming in sweet they're coming in with the honey but they got drawn swords behind their back they are not for the work of of the temple because you see the moment they're not told an answer they don't like you see their true colors come out so zerubabel answers but zeruel and Joshua and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel said unto them you have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel as king Cyrus the King of Persia hath commanded us because that's the other thing the Samaritans were not given a vision they were not given the King's Command the king said to zerubabel you build the temple he didn't say to the Samaritans you build the temple he said it to zerubabel it was Z zerubbabel's responsibility alone to do it not anyone else he was not given any commandment to bring the Samaritan in okay so how do the Samaritans respond verse four then the PE people of the land we weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in building and hired counselors against them to frustrate the purpose all the days of cus King of Persia even until the reign of Darius King of Persia this is not the Darius that um Daniel dealt with this is Darius the first the first Persian king named Darius and we see all these things culminate finally in the last chapter of um the last verse of um chapter 4 then cease the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem so it cease until the second year of the reign of Darius King of Persia so the opposition that they faced from the Samaritans got to such a degree that it completely halted the work on the temple okay because you see here the Samaritans they are told no and they start conniving they start politicking and they start bribing officials in the Persian Empire to stop the work of the temple and the whole thing halts and not only does it halt for a moment in time it halts for 17 years completely grounds to a halt not a bit of work is done on the temple and what happens is that the Jews get complacent they accept that condition as a reality and they stop working on the temple and they get lazy and they start working on their on their own homes and they start focusing on their on their own lives and things go into a state of disrepair okay but the key thing here is that there is a prophecy given that the temple would be restored the walls would be restored and it had to happen there's a prophecy hanging over their head and it didn't matter what happened it was going to happen God himself was going to do something about this and at that moment the enemies of Israel triumphed they thought they had it and that is the case in a lot of times in our own lives where the devil thinks he got us he thinks he got us in a corner there's no way out there's no way you can move you're done this is your reality now accept it but he doesn't have the the the the shout of the king in the camp he doesn't have the king's prophecy hanging over what we have we have a vision right and that's the purpose of why we come to church we come to strengthen that Vision that there is a Rapture there is a resurrection we will make it that's why we have to stay in the presence of God because it strength strengthens that resolve it strengthens that the the purpose in our heart that not only am I going to make it into the Rapture but I will go into the Rapture thriving not only will I go into the Rapture but my family will go into the Rapture with me my house will be restored etc etc etc so that's the thing is that like that's why at this point Israel had failed and God was going to prove to them that despite their failure he was going to going to be strong on their behalf okay so at this point this is a this is a critical Junction in time this could really go sideways quickly here Israel had had had been sold into slavery they lost the temple and there was this this Mighty work of God happening and then it just suddenly hits a brick wall and for anyone looking on' be like so much for your God so much for the Commandment but God was going to raise up a man right and that man man's name was hegi and hegi was only on the scene for four months but you talk about a candle lit on both ends he comes in burning he comes in shouting and he comes and he leaves screaming he's he you know Scholars talk about him it's just like he is he comes in the most critical time and there was no one more successful than hegi within 24 days of he guys first sermon they're back at it building the Temple after 17 years of lethargy and doing nothing 24 days they're back at it like nothing happen and you see what happens after those 20 days 24 days is incredible so hegi he has the uh second shortest book in the Bible um I think only Obadiah has one chapter and then his obai with with with with two chapters and the first the first chapter is him tearing the hide off the Jews chapter 2 is saying okay I've tore the hide off you now do the work and you're going to do great okay and that's usually how it goes the discipline comes and then here's the encouragement so HEI and it it and it it's actually very beneficial because it literally dates each chapter that he's preaching so you you know exactly when he comes in when he leaves so hegia comes on the scene and he's he's he's like a a Man on Fire so he preaches for 3 months and then you have Zachariah come in in November because it literally you know exactly which month he comes in he comes in November he does the same thing rips the hide off of him and then gives them encouragement and then from then on in December hey guys's off the team forever we don't hear about hey guy ever again so from September to to December hey guys is there and he's gone he does his job and Zachariah takes over and Zachariah his job was to to encourage zerubabel to be a support to him but you see his switch for Zachariah where he he completely changes to prophecy long-term prophecy and he there's so many prophecy I was just talking to that about there's so many Prophecies of Zechariah where it has to do with us he talks about uh the seven eyes of the Lord and brother brandham is one of those seven eyes and he talks about the Millennium and he talks about so many things that are just so applicable to us but we won't be able to get into it incredible incredible amount of Prophecy happens in z um book is kind of second to to Daniel in terms of in terms of that period so if we go to hegi chapter 1 is that small is that readable maybe she turn to heya so it's in the latter um portion of um the Old Testament if you can read it we can just we can just go ahead with it verse one in the second year of Darius the king and the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the Lord by hegi the prophet unes rubbable the son of shiel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of josec the high priest saying thus speaketh the Lord of host saying this people say this the time is not come and the time uh I lost my place sorry let's start over verse to I lost my place thus speaketh the Lord of host saying this people say this time is not come the time that the Lord's House should be built then came the Lord the word of the Lord by heah the prophet saying is it time for you or ye to dwell in your SED houses or panel houses is another word for it and this house lith waste so he's talking about the temple he's the the Jews are saying it's not the time for the for the temple to be restored so you go from them being in in in a place of Revival to saying it's not time for the temple to be restored verse four is it time for ye oh ye to dwell in your side houses in this high this house lie waste now therefore sayith the Lord of hosts consider your ways you have so much and bring in little you eat but you have not enough you drink but are not filled with drink you clothe but there is none warm and he that earnthenecklace ified sayeth the Lord you look for much and low it came to little and when you brought it home I did blow upon it why sayith the Lord of hosts because of mine house that is waste and you run every man unto his own house therefore the heaven over you is stayed from Dew and the Earth is stayed from her fruit and I called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon man and upon cattle and upon the labor of the hands so what happens here they they get complacent they say it's not time for the temple to be built and they focus on building their own houses and what happens is that because they focus on their own Affairs rather than seeking first the kingdom of God essentially HEI is saying to them you have tried to build and it hasn't worked out for you you've tried to put on clothing to stay warm and you're still cold you try to earn money and you put into purses with holes in it it's just falling onto the ground you tried to plan but I've stopped up the Heavens because you're not obeying me I've cursed the land the the the rain everything because you are not seeking me so this is what hegi comes in with with both guns blazing and he is saying to him you have you have faced resistance but you have brought this on your own head you have allowed the situation to drag out because you've gotten complacent and what happens here is that it's you know type in Shadow for us is that if you don't seeking first the kingdom of God you're you're you're you're you're fighting the wind if you don't put God first don't expect to be blessed if you don't tithe don't expect to be blessed I I knew one uh son of a minister in the message at the time he was struggling he was still going to church but he was struggling and he decided um he wasn't going to tithe anymore so he stops tithing and he gets pulled over I think four or five times by the cops and the exact total in tickets that he got total the amount of tithing that he owed the Lord if you're a child of God you get back because it's not your money and don't expect to be blessed if you're not given not only do your money but your time God wants you to give to him first because if you give to him first then he can add all these things shall be added unto you and the requirement is God first he is the foundation of your life you can't build on any other Foundation you're fighting against yourself and you're going to get into trouble and you're going to cause everything around you to get in trouble because yeah you look at aen you know you have someone who's not only does it affect their their their family it affects the church so it we we better take heed in terms of our lives are not bubbles that are just contained to our own home it has a ripple effect to everyone around you all righty so after the essentially the spanking um hegi brings encouragement in verse two of chapter 2 speak now to zerubabel the son of shiel govern of Judah and to Joshua the son of josec the high priest and to the residue of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in her first Glory so that he talking about Solomon's Temple and how do you see it now is not in your in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing so he's saying for those who have seen the Solomon's Temple now that you've seen this Temple it's nothing in your sight verse four yet now be strong o zerubabel sayeth the Lord and be strong oh Joshua son of josec the high priest and be strong all you people of the land sayeth the Lord and work for I'm with you say the Lord of hosts according to the work that I have Covenant with you when you came out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not for thus sayith the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill this house with Glory said the Lord of hosts the silver is mine and the gold is mine said the Lord of hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former said the Lord of hosts and this is the place will I give peace saith the Lord of hosts and what is and who is the day of days Christ that psalmist Temple had the Shan of Glory it had the Ark of the Covenant you had a miracle of the fire coming down but you had the the culmination of the ages you had the the the person of whom all nature was crying for you had the person who all the prophets were proclaiming walking not in Solomon's Temple but in zerubbabel's little humble Temple and the the the latter Glory was greater than the former glory GL why because the culmination of all ages was Walking The Halls teaching preaching and healing in those corridors so that's why he was saying it doesn't matter how small it is the day of days is going to walk in these halls and not only is he will I shake Nations but through him I will bring peace in this Temple so then Zechariah Falls suit and he provides encouragement for zerubu then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto rubul saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit say the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro throughout the whole earth and that that brother Braham says the these are the seven Church AE Messengers they are the eyes they are the eyes running to and fro throughout the whole earth and they they they were rejoicing because of the plummet of Zer and what is a plummet line it's it's the thing that determines if something is plum straight up and down is it accurate and in the hand of zerel is the plum line and he was establishing what is true what is straight and what is correct and they Rejoice because of it and Christ was the one he was he fulfilled the law and he was the one who paid the debt of sin and he was the one who established that through my spirit the church would overcome not by not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord and this is what uh brother Braham is saying is that the seven Church age cry is not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the lord it's not through your own abilities it's not through your own strengths or your tools or your Ambitions your dreams or whatever it's by his Spirit alone because he can't do it yourself you look at the Jews they failed over and over but through his Spirit greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world okay so you see here that the work stop for 17 years and it looks like the Samaritans had won they even to convince the Persians to be on their side it looked impossible so God sent hegi and Zechariah and they they they rebuke him this is where you're this is where you're wrong this is not just all the Samaritans fault you had you have let things slide yourself okay and you got to get back in line and once you're in line now I'll give you the strength that you need to finish the job so you have all these encouragements and you see how zable and the people are going to react then zerubabel the son of shiel and Joshua the son of josec the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the words of hegi the Prophet as the Lord their God has sent him and the people did fear before the Lord then spake hegi the Lord's messenger in the Lord's message unto the people saying I Am with You sayeth the Lord and the Lord stirred up the spirit of zerubu the son of shiel governor of Judah and the spirit of Joshua the son of josec the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the people and they came and did in the house of the Lord of hosts their God so things finally start moving so the Samaritans see this effort so I'm going to start summarizing because we're going to run out of time so they they come up to him and said who who's commanded you to start building the wall in the temple again what authori is and they they start questioning the Jews and then zeruel gives an answer we're doing this because Cyrus the Great commanded us to do this and he's commanded that we build the temple and that's who we answer to so the Samaritans send a letter to Darius the King of Persia essentially saying uh and I'll skip to it the final bit here verse 17 now therefore if it good to the king Let There Be search made in the king's Treasure House which is there at Babylon where there be so that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God of Jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter so they're saying the Jews have said the cus the Great have done this can you check in your in your record house to ensure whether they actually actually are telling the truth or not so at this point the Samaritans have done a a great misdeed to themselves and they have essentially poke the bear without realizing it so by doing this they by essentially saying we don't believe zable that he's actually doing the work of sarus the great we think he's lying so check in in in your records and see if he if he is lying so the thing is if they're wrong it's going to be a bad time and if they're right then the work stops so King Darius essentially he um and let's just read it just clear that way then Darius the king made a decree and search was made in the house of the rolls where the treasures were laid up in Babylon and there was found at aam actha in the palace that is in the province of the mes a role and therein was a record thus written in the first year of sarus the king the same King uh the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem let the house be builded the place where they offer sacrifices and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid the height thereof of three score cubits and the breath thereof three score cubits with three rows of great stones and a row of new Timber let the expenses be given out of the King's house and also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem and brought unto Babylon be restored and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem everyone to his place and place them in the house of God so Darius in a nutshell has said has just has just read okay Zu is right so here darias then writes a letter back to the Samaritans verse six now therefore tanite Governor beyond the river sheth bazai and your companions the aites which are beyond the river be far from then let the work of this house of God alone let the governor of the Jews and the Elder of the Jews build this house of God in his place moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the Elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God that of the king's Goods even of the tribute beyond the river forwith expenses be given unto these men that they be not hindered and that which they have need of both young Bullocks and Rams and Lambs for the burnt offerings of the god of Heaven wheat salt wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail that they may offer sacrifices of sweet Savers unto the god of heaven and pray for the life of the king and of his sons also I have made a decree that whosoever shall alter this word let Timber be pulled down from his house and being set up let him be hanged thereon and let his house be made a dungill for this and the god that had caused his name to dwell there destroy all Kings and people that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem I Darius have made a decree let it be done with speed so this is a doozy okay there a lot to unpack here so Darius is essentially saying okay you are now messing with a Royal Decree of Cyrus so this is what's going to happen Samaritans you you are going to leave them alone you are not going to hinder the work not only are you not going to hinder the work you're going to pay for the construction of this Temple out of your own pockets and out of the treasury and not only will you do that you'll provide cattle and you'll provide sacrifices so they can do their daily sacrifices not only that you're going to provide all the ingredients that they need for that the salt and the wine and the wheat all these things you're going to provide to them every day so they can sacrifice unto their God because I don't want to mess with their God I've heard about their God and you see he said like I whoever Alters this let them be destroyed by their God and the final thing is if you don't do any of this what's going to happen is that in each of your homes the main beam out of the house will be set up and you will be hanged upon it and then your house will be turned into a dung Hill dung is another word for manure okay it will be turned into a house of absolute grossness in the Amplified Bible it it it says the beam of the house will be taken out and you will be impaled upon it so whatever one you want to go with both ends are not nice the ingredients are death and suffering so he's saying here you will obey them you will not mess with them you will pay for everything you will provide everything for them every day and as of they if they need something else you will give it to them if you don't listen to this or alter this order you will be destroyed and your house filled with dung and not only that I have made this decree I'm putting my name behind this not only am I saying obey Cyrus I'm putting my own name behind this the full authority of the Persian Kingdom the greatest Kingdom at the time you will listen to this and you will do it with speed what part in this did Rubble play not my not by might not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord what did zerubabel do he answered to them and said I'm obeying my king that's who I'm listening to that's all he did he witnessed of his purpose and the enemy made a noose for his own neck just like hmon and what's funny is that the the circum sense of hmon happens right after this the next king after Darius was Xerxes and he uh and in uh in the Bible he's his Hebrew name is Aeris and he marries Esther so this whole season is a season of the Jews are just in their position they are just doing what they need to do in order to worship God and Obey him every day and these enemies are coming against them and all all they got to do is witness of who they are witness of their purpose of their vision and God was going to take care of the rest nothing else not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord a total Miracle after 17 years they start they start to get resistance again here we go again but you look at the difference that where zerubabel he's saying to them we're doing the work that sarus told us if you have a problem with that go to the king and they brought destruction their on their own head so you look what happens next then Tatai governor on this side of the river sheth banai and their companions according to that which Darius the king had sent so they did speedily and the Elders of the Jews builded and they prospered through the prophesying of hegi the prophet and Zachariah the son of Ido and they build it and finished it according to the Commandment of the god of Israel and according to the Commandment of Cyrus and Darius and art exes King of Persia and this house was finished on the third day of the month of Dar which is in the sixth year of the reign of darus the king and the children of Israel the priests and Levites and the rest of the children of the Captivity kept the dedication of this house of God with joy the temple was restored atonement was back and God's commandment was fulfilled and they didn't do anything all they did was their job the Commandment that God gave them was to build the temple the Commandment was not fight the Samaritans if they come after you and try to justify yourself to them and no what what was their job build the temple don't focus on anything don't let anything else distract you or pull you away from the job that you've been given because the job that you have given is it's so critical because you look at you know the I forget the the exact verse and how it goes in where Paul talks about how the house of God is fitly put fitly together and each fitly framed together and brother brandom talks about how the Stars influence each other by staying in their place because if you have you look at this at our solar system and you you look at someone like uh like Jupiter Jupiter is just a big ball of gas but it is it is such a critical structure in the solar system because it's Gra is is second to that of the Sun so what happens is is most asteroids that have Earth's name on it are pulled in by Jupiter so you have this big giant mass that's just essentially plain safety for the Earth and if that that planet was out of the way Earth would be pummeled by asteroids and you look at like if if if the moon if the the small the smallest of planets if the moon was moved away by a certain degree there would be floods everywhere so each of these things have an incredible effect on one another and you look at a church the smallest person the most insignificant humble person who may not have a a big position in the church has an influence in a pool on that church and and the person who who may have the biggest job you don't know how many things are they getting hit with that are getting are meant for you you don't realize how how the people going in front of you have have suffered just to such a degree that's why you give honor to the elderly that's why you give honor to the pastor double honor is is is what scripture says it's because you don't know what they go through in order to protect the Sheep you don't know half of it I you don't know half of it so you look at like our positions are so critical a mother how critical is a mother in terms of the the trajectory of a of of a uh of a child or a father all these things have influence upon each other and if you move one out of the way it it it it Causes Chaos in a church in a home anywhere and it goes to show that like no matter the obstacle that that that comes against us our job is not to fight you look at you look at what Moses said to the Egyptians God LED them to a dead end to a to to a red sea and all he said is look at the Egyptians they're going to be no more and what was their job their job was to believe Moses that's it believe it and the thing is is that God is bringing us to these Red Sea moments where it's just you're looking at a big giant wall of water and behind you there's a big army coming in behind you and you're about to get Squat and if they went in any other direction but towards that sea they would have died and you look at these situations that we get ourselves in or it just so happens we may not be putting ourselves in those situations but those Red Sea moments there they're so critical because you know the the Rapture is is is not this this big boom thing the the Rapture is is an event okay it's a process but it's also an event and it's it's a stepping stone and while God what God's doing with each trial that you're going through is a stepping stone towards the Rapture and and that's why we we we kind of pych yourselves out because we we see you know the Rapture is this big thing you know I'm not going to be ready for it but you don't realize that like he says here Zer Rubble he started the building and he'll finish it Christ who started the work in you is going to finish it and the Rapture is just going to be an event another stepping stone another opportunity where God is saying just trust me and that's why these little events in your life are little opportunities for you to get a bit more faith a little bit more Trust because he's going to be testing those areas that you're weak in you know and he's going to be doing it constantly and each opportunity each moment of trust is building that a bit by bit in order for you when you finally get to the precipice you got one step left it's just another moment of saying I trust you and boom you're gone so that's why you thank God for these these these trials and these tribulations because there are opportunities of growth and there's there are opportunities where he can show you I am strong on your behalf you just got to trust me you got you got to stop thinking here and stop thinking of like well it's not possible God does not dwell in the realm of possibility he went from a temple that was was laying dormant for 17 years to a fully funded construction project fully paid for within 24 days God is Not constrained by space time or matter he can open up a wall in front of you and say this is your way out and it can happen in a moment so all we have to do is realize that he is the gentle Shepherd and he gently leads his children along and you you'll have these moments where you're you're afraid and you're frightened but that's where it's just you have to go to him and you you you know it's um God requires the most out of this this age because it's the darkest age it's the furnace has been stoked seven times hotter it's the most deceitful age it's the hardest age it's the most amount of pressure the most amount of deception it it it's um but you look at it and God God has has left the best for last he's left the the the apple of his eye for this moment in time for for such a time as this Esther you have been chosen and prepared for this it's the same thing little bride you have for such a moment as this you have been you've been molded and prepared for this and you look at these moments in our lives and it's just you realize it doesn't happen all the time but you realize it for such a time as the moment that you're in he has prepared you for it and all you got to do all you got to do is take one step at a time that's all he requires your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path a p a lamp a lamp is not like a flashlight where it shines out a lamp shines down so that and you only see a couple steps in front of you and that's the way he's ordained for us we see a couple steps at a time in front of you and you got to trust that wherever you're going is not leading towards a big pit or a bunch of lions or whoever that's where you got to trust the tender hand of Jehovah that no matter where he leads you it's going to be threaded perfectly so as we clue up here in 1957 time tested Memorials of God every time a wind hits a tree and shoves it back and forth and back and forth it only loosens The Roots so it can grow deeper and get a better hold every time sickness strikes your home every time trial strikes your home every time the neighbors say something bad about you it's only shaking you loosening you up so you can get down and get a better hold in the Eternal Rock of God's immovable word that's how God does it he sends those trials to test you and to prove you shake you up and to give you a new hold if the musicians want to come and we can stand we read here in um Psalm 20 the Lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of Jacob defend thee send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of Zion remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice Grant thee according to thine own heart and fulfill all thy counsel we will rejoice in thy salvation in the name of our God we will set up our banners the Lord fulfill all thy petitions now know I that the Lord saves his anointed he will hear from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God they are brought down and Fallen but we are risen and stand upright save Lord let the king hear us when we call finally in 2 Chronicles for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong and the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him so fear not little flock he goes ahead he goes ahead no matter no matter what he has planned for you is for your good he's training you for our ultimate purpose he's building trust in the areas that you you need to build trust in we're all in an area and we we all certainly need his his grace to be able to get through those moments the right way because we don't want to be fleeing we don't want to be relying on the arm of Flesh because what happens there you you create an ishmail for yourself you create problems for yourself and what God go what God's wanting is not for his children to just get on by he wants his children to thrive so let's pray Lord Jesus we just thank you for this day me just be with us Lord as we we finished we just thank you so much Lord for your presence we just allow it Lord just to be just um food and new season Lord and I mean just help us all Lord to learn from it and to to grow in these areas that are weak Lord I mean just help us Lord to um just to trust you Lord just to have faith Lord that in
