the outside but the inside wasn't cleaned up below we want to be clean from the inside Lord working its way out Lord that it would subdue our spirit and flesh Lord Lord that your word would just have the full preeminent sword from the the head of the top of our head to the souls of our feet Lord in word thought indeed we pray Lord help us to surrender Anew this evening Lord and as you open your word to us or may just give us a vision Lord of what you have waiting for us Lord of what you've promised in this time and in this age Lord that what you've come to reveal to us Lord what will take us off this Earth in a Rapture Lord just draw our faith a little higher this evening Lord may we be able to step out into it Lord may it have an effect in our lives Lord not just good words or good thoughts or ideas Lord but may it change us Lord God we pray now Lord Just Have Your Way We ask in Jesus name we pray and God bless you turn the scriptures if you would to Genesis 1 and certainly want to welcome our our Senior League guitarist brother Paul Coffey back with us also sister Kimberly and brother Michael amen it's good to have them back good to have them back and well amen so amen glad to have them amen I've got to say I was expecting more people based on the volume of the singing so praise the Lord that the people are in it you know it does uh does a minister good to come out and everybody's worshiping and it makes a difference you know and and we've only got you know two-thirds of the church here and it sounds like the whole group's here so praise the Lord for that for putting your Heart and souls into it I know he sees it and then it certainly makes makes it a lot easier for me when I get up here as well and then just another quick update Brother David Nash Our missionary that we've been supporting is back in in the United States now but he sent me a few quick picture updates so these are the last few services that they had so as you can see here it's an awning next to a building is the church that's where they meet for their services then just a picture of some of the brothers there on the right side and then uh this is uh two sisters so I think a mother and a daughter that got baptized while they were there so that's six baptisms he's had over the 19 days that he was there so we praise the Lord for that and then he sent me a picture of what your shoes look like when you're doing missionary work so not only are they dirty all around but you have massive clumps of mud on them so it's a it's not a place for for nice clothes you see he typically is just wearing a golf shirt and some pants or just maybe a collared shirt at best and that's it because you just get filthy dirty sweaty you know stung and all these different things that you deal with there but he does it faithfully and he does it willfully and uh I just love to see that I mean six souls for for 18 days 19 days of work I just say praise the Lord from that and guess what that's not just because of him that's because we're there supporting him he couldn't have gone without us amen so it's not just Brother David Nash that's brought those souls to the lord it's this entire church says Faithfully pay their tithes and offerings that allows us to support someone like that to send them out and that's Our obligation amen if we've met our needs here then it's Our obligation to help somebody else that that needs that brother Bram says if he says I just keep the bare minimum he says and I send the rest out there so that the missionaries can go out there and get those lost souls and get the word out to the last one that needs to be in so we say praise the Lord from that Brother David Nash wanted me to thank the church specifically for our support on this trip of course couldn't have gone without us and it just meant the world to him to be able to accept that invitation he gets more invitations than he can accept just with his time and energy but he doesn't always have the money to do it and this time he didn't and we came through for him so thank you for that that's that's you as well as him that's uh that's been able to make this happen and we thank the Lord for blessing it above all those things Amen in Genesis verse chapter 1 verse 26 it says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them amen God bless you can have your seats this evening we want to pick up where we left in in the last service and we're on our Redemption series now and I want to continue with this thought of in the beginning because we talked about the the law of redemption and then we we talked about and we'll dig into that deeper you know as we go because it doesn't mean so much to us when we start talking about land Redemption and those things we don't really deal with that anymore in in the Gentile side of things in in North America and whatnot but we talked about it in Redemption how that was so much tied to the land for the Jews and and it wasn't that that was the original Redemption plan but that's the part of our Redemption that they latched on to and you remember when they came and Jesus came and they said when are you going to restore the kingdom because it was all about what getting them out from under the thumbs of the Romans giving them their land back and letting them going back to worship god without people bothering them amen but they were able to worship all that time and nothing had changed amen so it wasn't the worship was the problem it was that they needed to be redeemed back to something that they didn't have they'd lost the vision they'd lost the purpose of even what the law was supposed to do and it was supposed to drive them to the thought of redemption it was supposed to drive them to the Messiah so that when he came they'd accept him because he was the Fulfillment of the law he didn't come Jesus come said I didn't come to to put the law away but I came to fulfill it to fulfill the requirement of it so that you could come back into a Grace Covenant and then they missed the thought of redemption and certainly as we look at this believers they they missed that Redemption is first and foremost to deliver you from yourself because if you got away from the land if you lost the land if you lost the blessing it was because you stepped away from God not that God stepped away from you it was because you did wrong it was because you messed up and so the Redemption was to get you back to a spot away from yourself it was to get you back to the good place amen so that you you catch the mind and the thought of God through his word and by obedience you'd stay there because guess what if you had the land redeemed back and nothing changed in you what was going to happen in a couple of years you're going to go right back to the way that you used to live before and then all of the people that had taken the land from you before would have a right to come take it again not only a right but God said he'd use them to take your land away from you so if nothing changed on the inside if nothing changed on your in your life and the way you believed in the way you lived then what was going to happen was the land to be redeemed you and then somebody was going to go take it again because you couldn't and wouldn't line up with the word of God you wouldn't be in obedience to the word of God and so the enemy has a right to take it and that's where you sit today is if you won't line up with the word then the enemy has the right to take away what you have right we see that the prophet teaches that very clearly amen but I want to say that Israel's true Redemption was supposed to be open fellowship with God and we know that because as soon as Christ died then he tore the veil right he tore the veil that was a partition and you could only be a high priest and you had to go in with blood and all these different things he broke the veil he tore the veil so that there could be a restoration back to that amen and so the gospel was first given to the Jews he came to his own and his own received him not the scripture says and it was supposed to be a return to the Grace Covenant that's what he was doing he was supposed to be bringing back to the abrahamic Covenant because Abraham walked in in a covenant with God where there was no law there was no law what he had was a sign of obedience which was circumcision but Abraham wasn't living under a law he didn't have to to to sacrifice animals every you know for the different feasts and he didn't have to go here and he didn't have to turn his face to this place to worship God he didn't have to do anything like that Abraham just had the sign of circumcision and then he was in in God's favor that's the only thing that he had to do and the thing is it wasn't a law that you had to be circumcised it was a sign that you want to be in the Covenant it was a sign of your acceptance of what God had required you to do and if you didn't have the circumcision you didn't die right all it was was you didn't get the blessing but he didn't kill you if you didn't do it amen whereas the law if you didn't do it then you died under the under the the witness of two or three people right so Abraham was walking under grace not under the law and if we look back in Genesis 15 it says after these things the word of the Lord came to Abraham and of Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward this is the Grace Covenant it's not Abraham if you do this then I'll do this it's Abraham I am your I am your your exceeding great reward I'm the one that's going to be the blessing to you Abraham he says in Abram said Lord God What wilt thou give me see and I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus Abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine Heir he says you're telling me that's great Lord but you promised me a son and I don't I still don't have a son it says and behold the word of the Lord came to him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowel shall be thine ear and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness because you're seeking righteousness righteousness means to do the will of God to be in favor with God because you're in obedience to his plan his purpose and God's saying to Abraham he's saying don't worry about the promise he says just look to me and as long as you're looking to me then everything else will be okay all fulfill the promise but you've got to focus on me first I'm the one that's the of the greatest interest I'm the great benefit that you're looking for Abraham and as long as you keep that in your mind then you're going to turn out all right now Eva God follows right up behind this this conversation with Abraham a short while later and this is this is an amazing thing he says and this is one year before the promise is about to be fulfilled so three months before Abraham's about to get a body change Sarah's about to get a body change and Isaac's uh you know they're gonna they're gonna get pregnant for Isaac right so this is just before the promise is supposed to be fulfilled so I want you to put yourself here because we've got a promise that's waiting for us don't we we've got a promise of full Redemption amen we have a seal that's going to poke Focus us all the way to that but we've got a promise of a full Redemption of a body change and we go to him to and we meet him in the air and we go to uh uh you know the the bride the the supper the the the the wedding suffering these different things so Genesis 17 says him when Abram was 90 years old and nine so he's 99 years old for those who are struggling with the math he's going to have Isaac at 100 years but he's going to follow him at 99 and a quarter so three months before that the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I am the almighty God Walk me for me and be thou perfect now we think perfect means what flawless sinless but that word perfect means complete whole sound entire healthful entirely in accordance with the truth so this is way different than sinless Perfection what is truth truth is the word for your day for you amen it's got to be for you so what was Abraham's Truth for his day you're gonna have a son and God's coming to Abraham and he's saying Abraham produce a son Abraham's 99 years old up his seat is dried he hasn't had relationship with his wife for for decades and God's coming to him and he's saying Abraham fulfilled the word now and Abraham's probably saying Lord I tried and I tried and I tried and nothing happened we weren't successful and now I can't even do it I can't do anything to produce the word Lord but it's what three months away from the promise starting its path to being fully fulfilled in his life and God's saying walk in my word walk in the truth I've given to you and Abraham's saying they're saying how I've been trying to do it for 24 years and three months and nothing's happened I've been doing exactly what you told me to do faithfully and nothing has happened Lord and God's saying walk in my word produce the results Abraham what do we do what can we do we're in Abraham's same position I can't produce a body change in and of myself amen so what does it look like to walk in truth to to be perfect James writes about and he points back to the scripture we just read he said the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God he believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness in other words his belief was as if he had done it himself right and because of that he was called the friend of God Amen so Abraham did not produce the word but God says Abraham because you have believed and you do believe it is as if you produced it on your own and he says that's why he's called the friend of God is because he believed in amen and Abraham didn't live perfectly he made mistakes he got out of the will of God he got out of the land of Canaan where he was supposed to be he got in with the Philistines he lied about his wife he did all of these things amen he might have been swayed from time to time but when the scripture looks back at through the filter of redemption it says that he believed because he always came back to that point Lord I believe you're going to do it especially especially at 99 years when he obviously could not fulfill the word yet his faith never wavered amen what does it say what is it God in the scripture says I see the faith and not the mistakes and because I see the faith and I see the heart that's there even though maybe he moves from left to right yet the heart is faithful to the word and that's what I'm judging here today is I'm judging that his heart believes that the word of God is true and I'm going to do what I said I was going to do that word impute means to account to add to to give credit for to reckon to to add to one's account to make a judgment in your favor I want him to judge in my favor amen and how is it it is when we believe and he imputes in the face of all the Earth and every tree in the witch is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth to every fowl of the earth to everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is life I've given every green herb for meat and it was so they're vegetarian praise the Lord we've moved on and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening in the morning were the sixth day so God rests here right as soon as the sixth day is over he goes into rest so this is perfection this is the original creation this is your point of perfection but yet we're not manifested the way we are today so while this is perfection this is not a return point this is not what we're looking for yet amen but here you have man in such a form that he can't be tarnished he can't be influenced he can't be drawn away from anything he is perfect right here but then we jump into Genesis 2 and God says in every plant of the earth before it was in the earth and every herb or the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to tell the ground and there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground we spoke of this before how that God knowing that there was going to be a man coming to tell the ground prepare the ground to start to grow in time for him to come on the scene right God always prepares a crop for the man to come on the scene amen when we have a Prophet come in it's what he we had an Azusa Street Revival go before him to prepare a crop remember the rain falls on the just and the unjust it's getting them ready for what the final season the final growth I'm in the ripening in the presence of the Sun and these things he always sends the rain before what the message comes to bring it what to its full fruit he says in the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul so man is still perfect here because he's still male and female inside he's still the image of God he's the image of God now manifested in flesh and we know this is perfect because this is the same way Christ came this is the same way Christ came because remember Christ come down he has us inside because he has to take something out of his side on the cross we're with him there brother Graham says when he died on the cross you died with them right you are a part of him so this is this is still Perfection here right he's a pure reflection of God in flesh now and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed so God makes man puts him in a body and then gives him a work to do he's still in perfection verse 9 says and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil jumping down to verse 15 says the Lord God took the man put him into the Garden of Eden address it and keep it and the Lord God commanded the scene the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die it says and Adam gave names to all the cattle and the fowl the air to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found unhelp meat for him a suitable help for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh thereof now I want to stop here because the scripture points it out that Adam in his original condition is exposed to the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now I want you to think about that because we're in a mixed crowd and we know that the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is of euphemism for something else and we are not going to go into it but the prophet of God said if eating apples cause women to realize they're naked then we better cause they pass the apples again so this was not a literal fruit tree okay and we know this again the adults will know this so if there was a Mr serpent there was a Mrs serpent can I put it that way amen so we know that the the male serpent seduced Eve which meant that there was potential for the female serpent to seduce Adam and yet we know Adam was exposed to the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil rather and he never touched it there was nothing there that tempted him there was nothing there that Drew it because Adam was ordered not to mess around with it he was in constant communion with his creator he had the perfect attributes inside of him he had male and female inside of him he had no need of anything from the outside everything he needed was in him right there so he wasn't drawn away by it there was nothing that tempted Adam in any way and he also knew that it was under his Dominion right that you don't go have conversations with a parent because it's underneath you and I believe Adam probably never had a conversation with the serpents because they had nothing they could give to him it was him to them not them to him amen he knew that he was above it so you have Adam with both the male and female attributes under one mind under one intelligence in one body cannot be tempted or swayed he stays perfect to the word of God it says and the rib which the Lord God had taken for man made he a woman and brought her under the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh so he says what she's me she's come out of me she's a part of me so she is me he says she shall be called woman for she was taken out of men therefore shall a man leave his mother and his father and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh now I want you to catch the son now that's two people two entities two different bodies but he says they shall be singular one flesh what is it that's husband and wife that's man and woman it's Christ and the bride and he says the two are one and the key to them being one is what cleaving it's cleaving that makes them one because they're obviously two we can count one plus one equals two but he says there'll be one flesh but they have to cleave in order to be one flesh here so we have this beautiful scene in in in Eden and this is our state of perfection right here we have two bodies United under the word doing what God has purpose for them fulfilling the word of God and they're perfect they have all the attributes of God inside of them and they're under his will so everything's perfect everything's great everything's hunky-dory and so we can see ourselves here when we look at Redemption this is what we're looking to be restored back to brother Brian puts it this way he says now in the beginning when God made the man to worship Him and live God taking care of him and fed him man had a perfect fellowship with God there was nothing wrong that's what Redemption looks like nothing wrong God came down in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve what a beautiful picture no harm nothing could harm them no sickness could ever come to them they didn't even know what sickness was they didn't know what old age was they didn't know what being hurt was they couldn't be hurt they was in the presence of the omnipotent powers of God which held them in control and guided them by his spirit and there was nothing could harm them catch that thought they're in the presence of the omnipotent powers of God which held them in control and guided them by his Spirit That's why nothing could harm them they were what in perfect relationship imperfect Unity perfect purpose and perfect alignment with the word of God so he says nothing can harm them there as long as they're led by the spirit as long as they're in communion with God they're okay he says now man was born to have Fellowship born for it man in the beginning back in the Garden of Eden he had wonderful Fellowship God come down and fellowship with his company of men and women every evening I want you to catch that every evening in the cool of the evening God will come down under the great palm trees perhaps as sacred light as it was shining down on Adam and Eve in that great cathedral in the open fellowship with God had nothing to worry about as long as they were fellowshipping catch that now because we're looking at what getting back to a place where we don't have to worry about anything and he says where do you get that place when you're fellowshipping with him not with a minister not with a sermon amen not with just Believers of like Precious Faith but with him amen that you've got fellowship with him that's what's keeping you that's what leaves you with nothing to worry about he says I love fellowship with men I like to go out and talk with people who love the Lord and have fellowship with them because we see the same thing our motives are the same our ideals are the same I've Got a Friend sitting right down here that likes to hunt and fish many times we have a lot of Fellowship together just sitting around talking on those things because we like those things but the greatest Fellowship that any man ever had was when he had fellowship with God when God gave himself open to man to Fellowship back and forth with his creature the Creator and his creature now when God was fellowshipping with Adam in the Garden of Eden Adam had nothing to worry about everything was on the smooth and running right how many would like to say my life is on the smooth and running right two on the smooth and Ronnie right he didn't have to worry about his clothes he didn't have to worry about something to eat didn't have to worry about sickness he didn't have to worry about death or sorrow he knew nothing about them just the freedom like a child he had a heavenly father who watched over him and fellowship with him daily he says wouldn't it be marvelous if we could be back like that again he says do you know every redeemed soul today that's living under their privileges of that kind of fellowship with God you believe that God will take care and provide everything that we have need of in this journey and at the end of the close of this old mortar Tabernacle God's promise to give us another one amen so you see here we talked about this idea of cleaving and God's checking in with his family every single day he never lets an evening go and brother Branham keeps pointing back to it's in the evening time it's in the evening time and he point to Zachariah and it'll be a time when it's neither dark nor light and but there's going to be light at the evening time he talks about Rebecca coming to Isaac in the evening time he says there's significance with God's presence in the evening time and he's pointing to what the evening time right our great evening time when it's the end of the day amen and he comes down one last time to carry us away amen but I want us to look at the man and the woman here because we have the still potentially the perfect reflection of God because we have the attributes now in two bodies amen but now you have two parts of a single personality in two bodies so what was originally unbreakable now is potentially breakable because in the beginning they're in one body under one mind and they both have both the both sides of the male and female are there so they're in Perfect Balance if we could put it that way so guess what I don't know if you guys know it but men think differently than women they act differently than women and so what happens is what when you're separated then you have a leaning towards your attributes which makes sense doesn't it but together in one body they're perfectly balanced but you separate them out and now you have the potential for there to be problems but as long as they stay together they balance each other out and they guard each other and they protect each other So Adam and Eve were or Adam as man and woman they could be complete they could be perfect remember what it meant to be perfect complete whole in fullness and healthful what if they stay together so the key to them succeeding the key to their Victory the key to staying in the presence of God is that they stay close together because they balance each other out and we see her in the scripture that that God put a guard over this weakness and somebody asked me I mean it's a bit like closing the Barn Door after the horse has gone out I guess but somebody asked me this a while ago and I didn't have an answer they said where was Adam when Eve got seduced by the serpent how did it get to the point where she could be influenced so completely that she turned against the word where was her husband in all of this I thought it was a great question I didn't have an answer for it amen no I haven't no doubt of one thing Adam was still doing the will of God Adam was still doing the will of God and that he was taking Dominion he was naming things he was he was uh helping the garden to stay you know in good good health and tending it in these different things he was doing what he had been commanded to do amen we know that because Adam didn't fall the way that he felt he wasn't seduced into it he wasn't tricked into it but he did it willfully amen but we see in verse 24 the Scripture it says therefore shall a man well give it to me therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and there'll be one flesh so it's giving us this as a lesson because Adam didn't have a mother and he had a father but not the way we traditionally do so this is literally God looking back and giving us a lesson in this story and to me it gives us insight into what happened because he says the man is supposed to cleave to his wife and they'll be one flesh now that word cleave means to cling to stay close that's you controlling you and then he says keep close that's me controlling her so if she's wandering around stakeholds means I'm going to stay close but keep close means if she tries to go away you grab her and you say no you stay close to me stick to stick with follow closely join two overtake and catch so in other words if she tries to get away you don't let her get away you stay close beside her all the time so if there's one thing I can tell you it's that Adam wasn't present when the serpent seduced Eve so what does that tell you that Adam wasn't cleaving to his wife the way the scripture looking back says that he should have now I'm not here to lay blame on Adam Adam Didn't Know Better perhaps maybe he was just checking in Once a Night the same way that she that Christ was doing with them but the point is that to to stay in perfect Unity they had to stay together and so what happened when they separated into two bodies was that was that Adam keeps the mind but she gets a different mind with her body potentially right he's the son of God he keeps the original mind but he takes her out and he builds her from that body he puts that separate attribute into her and now she can be tempted now she can be moved off of that without intending to because she's got a mind of her own if we can put it that way amen the cleaning is what keeps you as one you're in separate physical body so that sticking close is your reinforcement it's your guard to what's going to happen and otherwise amen because if you don't cleave together somebody can get in there and guess what somebody did right and it was the serpent got in there so let me say this to men and women alike amen I was talking to someone the other day about you know things we deal with in our flesh and I was talking about my marriage and I said I'm a married man and guess what there are going to be times where I run across a woman that is going to be attractive alluring or will have a draw on me in some way in my flesh because I'm a man I'm a red-blooded man amen I have hormones and all these different things that are that are stuck in there amen so I'm gonna see women that potentially attract me but guess what I'm married and so my desire is to be to my wife but guess what I have to actively choose how to respond to that woman when she walks in front of me or when I see her so the question is will I cleave to my wife or will I cleave to this woman because I've got to actively decide who I'm cleaving to that day and there came a point where Eve didn't actively cleave to her husband and that's what got her into problems amen amen I've chosen my wife and she's accepted my choosing and that means that there's only one woman in my life that's supposed to fulfill the needs that I have and that's her and so I'm supposed to cleave to her but the interesting thing about the word cleave is that it's the only word in the English language that has two meanings that are exactly opposite I want you to catch this because it's it's two sides of the same coin because cleave also means to sever or split so that means if I am cleaving then I'm choosing what I'm clinging to and I'm choosing what I'm splitting away from and if I'm cleaving to something then by definition I must be splitting away from something else amen I cannot join two something unless I'm leaving something behind so the question I have for you tonight is what are you cleaving too and what are you cleaving from because the cleaving too is scriptural a cleaving away from is what we want to get you know that's the things that we're keeping away of Our Lives amen and so often the problem is we're cleaving to something that's not the word of God and we're wondering why we're having trouble in our relationship and our finances and our walk with Christ it's because we're not cleaving to the word we're not cleaving to the thing that is supposed to be our spiritual husband amen so if you're cleaving two you're automatically cleaving away You're fulfilling everything of cleaving in the one action make sure you're cleaving to the right thing amen if I'm cleaving to my wife then I'm cleaving every other woman in the world away from me so if you're cleaving to Christ is your spiritual husband then every other husband is going to be what cleaved Away by definition if you're doing the cleaving the way the scripture tells you to amen why do we see problems in marriage because somebody stops cleaving two and they start cleaving away right and you notice here the scripture does not tell the woman to cleave to her husband now I'm not saying women don't cleave to your husband because the scripture says and we'll read it in another service it talks about cleaving to the Lord cleaving to your husband you cleave dear husband sisters but it puts the onus it puts the responsibility of cleaving on the man and he says you leave everything behind and you focus on that woman you focus on that way that is your responsibility and if she gets away it's because you didn't cleave close enough to her so the thing is if she wants to leave what do you do cleave all the more if she's unhappy what do you do cleave all the more because you can only protect her if you're cleaving to her if you're staying closer in these things amen amen that's why the prophet of God calls the woman a pro a byproduct it's not that the woman as an attribute was a byproduct that's not what he's saying but he's saying the body she was placed in was a byproduct and that's what allowed Satan to get in that was the in the armor of perfection was when he placed her in another body and she didn't stay with her husband or her husband didn't stay with her if we want to put the responsibility on him because she was in a byproduct state in that separate body That's what Satan could get into and he says it here he says the man didn't have a wife the wife and the man was the same thing so this is the perfect State he says he had the feminist and the masculine spirit in himself then he says he to Satan he had to separate and take a byproduct after the whole creation was made no female created by God in the original creation can do a thing like that she was made thus to do it he knows she would do it if he didn't he wasn't God so what's he saying he's saying you cannot fall when you're in one body and and it proves it in the scripture Adam never fell as long as he was in one body but as soon as they stepped into two that's when the potential problem happened and that's when the problem did happen amen so the woman's put into a separate body and she falls because her body is a byproduct of the net of the original creation not her attributes the sisters are a perfect expression of God that's been split away we're an expression perfect expression of God as men that's been split away from the other half two of us together are perfect separate we're nothing right so the idea is to get us back together amen that's why the woman's looking for headship if she's Godly it's because she's looking to get back into that state where she joins to that one that guards and protects Us by cleaving to her amen so what did it do as soon as she got into a separate body and she has her own mind what can she do she can choose to leave she can choose who she listens to she can choose who she fellowships with she can choose who she has as theological discussions with including the serpent and brother Bob says that's what he did was he took advantage of that byproduct State and in that he caused her to fall and she gets to the point where she believes that evil was good she got into a theological discussion that got too deep for her and he twisted her and he turned around 180 degrees so that good was bad and bad was good amen so what's our point of redemption we're talking of Christ and the Bride of course and all these things amen is it two separate bodies with independent Minds can't be because that's that that's a that's a a failed model right it's already been tried it doesn't work you can't have two bodies and two minds but remember he says that he was supposed to cleave and in doing so you would be one flesh he says if you'll cleave you'll be one flesh you'll be one body you'll be as one so that's the key to all of this amen we know that Adam yielded to sin and even though he did it out of love for for his wife for for the woman he was still wrong in it but Christ isn't going to do that Christ isn't going to do wrong to try and make things right he's not going to do wrong to get us back he's got to fulfill the payment and the price that that has to be paid for this amen so getting us back in the perfect Fellowship is going to look like what us cleaving to Christ and Christ above all clinging to us amen we can cleave to him all we want but if he doesn't cleave back to us then nothing's going to happen is it right you think of these movie stars or or great athletes and stuff and they they have what they call groupies and they follow them around from game to game concert to concert and they're always around but guess what they're not in relationship they're just they're there and they'll hug on them and they'll do all sorts of things with them but they're not in true relationship with them right it's got to be the same thing with Christ we can't just be groupies of Christ we're supposed to be a bride amen we're supposed to be an intimate relationship because he has called us into the wedding chamber not us trying to break into it of our own things you know in the beginning the scripture tells the man to cleave to the wife that's the key to Redemption is that he's got to come back and cleave to us and that's what they turned down when Christ came they turned down the opportunity to cleave back to him he came there and he gave his life for them he was there to redeem them back into relationship and they turned them down amen listen we talk about the seventh seal we talk about the mysteries of God but why is it quiet under the seventh seal he's talking to some brothers about this earlier why is it quiet under the seventh seal because Christ isn't there why isn't he there because in order to get us back into Oneness he has to cleave and guess what he can't cleave when he's there and we're here what does he do he's got to come down here to cleave right he's got to come down here to woo a bride he's got to draw her to him and she's got to cleave to him and he's got to cleave to her and they've got to be one flesh amen the prophet talks about what the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride that's what's happening is he's come down under that seventh seal which is what the coming of the Lord to come down and do what cleave unto his bride to restore fellowship and unity so that their one body one body under one mind right because the two bodies two mind thing doesn't work anymore never did work prophet of God says this how many Knowles there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ it's two different words now the appearing now's the appearing the coming will be soon he's appeared in the midst of us doing the works that he once did in his church he says now you're a part of that church and by Grace you believe I'm a member of that church now I'm not a preacher you know I'm not I have not the education to do it he says sometimes I feel reluctant standing here by men of God who's called to that office there are Apostles preachers prophets teachers pastors and evangelists not all our Apostles are prophets not all our teachers are evangelists I'm standing here but by Ministries a different Ministry from a pastor or teacher I'm not and if I say things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean to but this is my Ministry C to declare him that he's here why because he's got to cleave to us to restore us back if we're going to come back into Oneness then he's got to be there to cleave to us amen we speak of being a spotless bride and and we are because we're under the blood of Christ amen but that's not what takes us off a planet in a resurrection and a Rapture amen until you are united with the bridegroom you're still separated and you're not going to go you can't do it amen you're still on the outside looking in there's potential but potential isn't enough and then we speak of being predestinated children of God and we are and we praise the Lord for that but being predestinated is not what takes you off of this planet amen it only comes when you're United with him because the life that's in him is the life that's in you and that's resurrection power that's rapturing power he was resurrected and then he was raptured wasn't he we see both manifestations when he came and died on the cross rose again and then he's raptured up into the clouds and that's where we meet him in the same life amen that's what he's doing we can't be fussing and fighting about Unity or not having unity and expect to go with Christ amen we say church is pointing at each other we see ministers pointing at each other we see people judging each other left and right amen we've got to be able to see beyond our own our own lives our own gifts our own colleagues our own Ministries our own churches and see that this is a body that's so much bigger than who we are in this little building in this little Ministry or in any other one you pick the best and the greatest you have to be able to see that there's more to this body than just this body here amen this is a global body amen he's calling us out of every tongue and tribe and nation and guess what they worship different in Africa than we worship here right there they worship different in Florida than we do in here they definitely worship different in Japan than we do here and somebody go and say well they don't worship like we do there's no Spirit there guess what God's got a bride of every type and shape amen there's a lot of flowers in his garden guess what some only flower for a little bit some of them go forever some have a million like it and then some there's only a few plants like it in the world Amen I mean it's up to him to decide who's in the body not up to us but that Unity amen we're never going to have all the answers we're never going to be able to point to one man one Ministry that church and say they've got everything they have all the answers because what does it lead to you got to attend our church now it's never been God's plan he flung them around the globe right he drove them out through persecution to get to all the different places and now we've come back and said there's only one or two or three people in the world that have a real Ministry it's hogwash that's a lie from Satan is what that is I mean I'll call it what it is it's alive from Satan amen because what he promised today that we could come back to full fellowship and that fellowship's going to be in the bride before it's ever going to be something that takes us out of this planet amen if we can't get along together here how are we going to get together up there and then the same Spirits got to be inside of us to draw us together and that's what we've got to recognize is the spirit that's within us not just the gifts and the callings that we see amongst each other Romans 12 says I beseech you therefore Brethren that you by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God what that perfect means the whole body of Truth for your day guess what Adam had it and he lost it Moses had it and he lost it Joseph had it and he lost it David had it and he lost it phenomenal man we have phenomenal women all great Believers in the scriptures and guess what they could never come to a state of perfection but guess what we've been called to be perfect we've been called to be mature we've been called to produce the fullness of the word as a collective body amen what they saw God with all their hearts and they still didn't get there that's not it because what it's not him that willeth for him that runeth but it's God Amen and that's what we're coming back to is our strength is in him and that's why we're cleaving to him rather than running around on our own because our strength is when we're United with him because he's the great balancing act that we need in our life that's the power that's the strength that the authority that we're looking for he says for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think and to think soberly accordingly as God had dealt to every man The Measure of Faith listen not everybody has what we call a hundred a hundredfold faith some are 60 some are 30 but every child of God has faith but we don't look down on those that have less and we don't promote those that have more amen because he says don't think any highly more highly of yourself than you ought to why because it is how God had dealt to you the measure that you have amen he says for us we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we've been many are one body in Christ and everyone remembers one of another God puts it this way in the united time and sign after the seals he says but the church the bride is United by one God under one Spirit the spirit of God in one holy Union of God to be one holy bride to God that's a lot of ones it's a lot of ones that means there can't be a bunch of everybody else's we're all together all one thing that's right all together Unity of the body the body waiting as a bride as it is the Bride As we call ourselves the bride for the uniting time of the Bride the church is so coming together it should just create a love Among Us that we could hardly be away from one another that's right you don't have to beg people to pray you don't have to beg them to worship God you don't have to beg them to do what's right they're so in love with him till there's nothing else that's why it just warms my heart when we're missing a third of the congregation you come out it's as if everybody was here in the worship why because it's not about the numbers it's about him amen it's about your love for him it's about your appreciation and worship for him and we're United in that and all of a sudden God does wonderful things in our midst amen Prophet God takes us and he points us to the great mystery of God and he ties it all into one big Redemption picture or not for us he's talking about the threefold purpose and he says first is to express himself completely God in Christ who's that second Adam and then the second Adam can't fail so he says that's got to be perfect there then second he has to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body so you have the second Adam now he says you are his body singular one not two that he says the bride till he could have preeminence to express himself through them he says and thirdly to restore full Redemption the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to what are their signs and wonders following us where there's great things going on in the service and people are shouting and dancing and screaming wonderful praise the Lord for it don't want to lose it he says restore us back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them and fellowshipped with them amen that's why brother Branham would say this is not a Pentecostal message in the sense of what they had in Azusa Street he says this was calling a bride out right it was to catch her attention it was a gift that Eleazar took to Rebecca but that is not the end goal the angle is to get her on a camel and get her to Isaac that's what he's talking about here catcher catch you get you get you with a vision of who he is right the perfect Christ the second Adam and then now he's got to get you into what relationship so he can have the preeminence and then when he gets the preeminence now you step into full fellowship and the kingdom is is just going to fall right over and we'll go right into a millennium right speaking in Ephesians 4 the fivefold Ministries effect he says it's there how long how long is the fivefold ministry going to be here till we all come in the unity of the faith what is the unity of the faith I've said it before the unity of the faith what is it we're all believing for we only have one belief we want in this age what is it it's a resurrection that leads to a rapture that's the unity of our faith because that's when it separates who really believes and who didn't is when you go in a Rapture and until that day happens nobody knows for sure whether they're truly a Believer we believe it by faith we accept it by faith we act on these things but this is the separating sign is going to be who goes in that Rapture that's for the bride of Christ and the bride of Christ alone so guess what you're going to deal with the five-fold ministry until we come to the unity of the faith as a part of that fivefold Ministry let me say this let's make sure we're contributing to Unity and not disunity I mean let's not be the separation that happens in the church let's not be the cleaving amen by men's thoughts or men's ideas or relationships or friendships or anything like that but let us be here to draw everyone together and let Christ do the separating till we come all in the unity of the faith the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man wholesome the full truth complete mature unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children let me go back how do you get the stature the full stature of a man if we come to here is that the full stature if this is a body if we come to here is that the stature of the fullness what is the stature of the fullness how do you get to the fullness of stature how do you get the highest point on a on a body you gotta add the head so until we are united fully with Christ and the head comes down unites with the body that's how long the fivefold ministry is going to be here because what he's got to be he's got to be the Capstone he's got to be the intelligence he's got to be the Mind remember because that's how Adam couldn't fall was when there was one mind one body joined together that's what he's bringing us back to he says that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of man in cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive window Doctrine guess what when something new is rolling through you know what I do I stand back and I say let's see where this goes that's what Paul told us to do something new comes through sit back and see the fruit of it first and then because sometimes they can be right in the word and wrong in the spirit and that's definitely what you don't want you don't want to be wrong in your spirit because that's where the Pharisees work they were right technically but they were wrong in the way they applied it and they got off the they got off the Mark didn't they you're a lot easier to correct if your spirit's right and your doctrine's wrong he says but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him listen speaking the truth and love that's a fightful ministry's job we're supposed to be speaking the truth in love not to beat you down not to push you down not to dissuade you not to beat you up none of these things but it's also for us to speak to one another that even when it's hard even when it's harsh we're doing it out of love to you right we're doing it for your benefit not for ours love has always got to be the driving force in these things because what cleaving is all about love you can't cleave to somebody you don't love hey man if you think somebody's ugly you think somebody's stinky you think somebody's got a nasty habit you think somebody's just not nice to be around you don't want to cleave to them do you it's love that causes you to cleave listen while we were yet in sin he cleaved to us amen how are we to respond to those that are around us maybe in the same condition at times he says but speaking the truth and love may grow up unto him in all things which is the head even Christ remember grow up into him which is the head the head's waiting and we're just coming up and we'll join up when we reach that full stature he says from home the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part make it increase of the body under the edifying of itself and love I've always said that's the most difficult scripture to read because it seems that there's so much going on but basically it's saying that when you're joined to him the whole body works together and everything supports everything else and it does its job in a way that everybody benefits and nobody hurts that's the kind of body I want to be a part of Amen where it works together seamlessly where we're all pulling in the same direction where we're all looking to achieve it amen so what are we talking about what was Adam in the beginning and then we see Adam as a man and woman single body and then he turns into two and they're cleaving and they're doing the work of God together amen they're in Perfect Harmony and that's where perfectionally that's where the truth lay that's where Victory lay that's where fulfillmently and as long as they were cleaving they were fine and they didn't fall we don't know how long they were in the garden we don't know how long it took for them to get separated to a point but the prophet of God comes with this and Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says it's a revelation it's as Eternal as God's word is eternal look but the threefold purpose of God's great mystery is revealed God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church in order to redeem the Lost Eve back to the original condition in the Garden of Eden he says oh my notice it's eve not Adam the second Adam's already perfect he's already proven himself amen but why because he's the word now he's got to bring the part that was separated from him back into alignment so that they're under the same mind so that she can be made perfect along with him but I want you to catch her Perfection is not in her works because why we're under a Grace Covenant you don't need Grace if your works are perfect Abraham wasn't there by works what was he there by faith and this is a word that is what she has her righteousness by faith this is a believing bride amen this is an age of faith great faith this is an age of rapturing faith and it comes by what her accepting the promise and God coming down and saying to her be thou perfect amen believe it believe it and I'll do it that's all he's looking for amen we're sitting here today and we're looking for the fullness of redemption amen and what are we we're a bunch of bodies separated from God physically I'm talking of course right we're stronger when we're together but unless he's with us then we're still going to fall eventually right we can't hold a great Army still can't hold against Satan without the power of the Lord in their midst amen the shout of the King has to be in the camp amen so where are you if we're going to be back under perfect Redemption one body Unified under one mind under one intelligence and that's got to be Christ the word I mean that's got to be the head the head always has to be the word and if we can align with that let that have its preeminence in all of us then that's what's going to draw us back so we've got to be cleaving to the word we're cleaving To The Head and the head is trying to cleave down to us but guess what he can't move the standard you can't move the word he can't draw it he can't push it away for us amen so he's got to pull us through it to get us back to him how's he doing he does it through the blood amen he pulls us through himself he pulls us through that perfect that perfect Veil that perfect filter so that he can't see anything and that's what allows him to draw us back to us is that he looks at us through the Redemption the righteousness that he gave us at Calvary where he stepped in and he said I'll take theirs and I'll give them mine and that's what allows us to be drawn back to him because he can't see it in the first place amen prophet of God we're closing he says you're going to form what's known to me as a bride you're going to form that means it wasn't formed at that time why because he was calling him out this is 1962 restoration of the Bride tree he says all right I'll go with you and you'll be part of me you'll be my bride my life will be in your body just like a husband and wife as one person you and I are going to be one and at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me and I and you and you and me he says I just love that Satan just gets so angry at that see the Oneness of God all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church he says there you are it makes them all one he talks about that pouring into and it reminds me of if you've ever done a renovation or a restoration in a home or a car what do you do you pour all of your money into it don't you you pour all of your energy all of your spare time everything you got goes into that and why do you do it because you value the end product more than you value the pain that you have to go through and you know living on ramen noodles and craft dinner for months on end to try and pay it off it's no different with Christ he poured all of that into us and he poured everything that he was into us why because he valued the end result more than the pain he went through Agony he died of death that no other man remember I've said before brother Brown said he had a body created to handle the pain that he was going through because no human body no normal human body could handle the agony and the torture that he went through that's what he went through to pay the price for us why because he valued the end product and then he valued the wife that he was going to get out of it he says as our minds tonight search back through the corners of generations back into the Early times what a beautiful Fellowship it must have been when God called his children in the cool of the evening and commune with them then kissing them as it was on their cheeks and laying them down to sleep for a night's rest and the wild beast of the field he bedded down without any disturbance or harm no harm was there no death no sickness and no trouble he says and to awake on a new day to walk in the presence of their creator without fear without sickness he says oh God he says our spirit's groan for that time again for that's what we were made for amen it struck me when brother vaisha was talking about coming into the services here the first time and he said it was different than any other church I've been in you know what I believe it is it's people that are groaning and crying out people that have a desire not just to come in here and put a big face on it and put on a show but we're groaning and we're crying out for that relationship with Christ to be closer to him than we've ever been to be restored back to his presence Amen in a way we've never been able to go into before what is it we want to get back to where we were we want to get back to what he promised us we'd go back to we want to get back to that which he paid the price of redemption for how's he going to do it Holly bring us back to that time John 14 15 says if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you now what is it he's taking us all the way back to Genesis 2 24 and he's saying what a man will leave his mother and his father and will cleave to his wife and he says I'm leaving you but I'm not leaving you I'm leaving you in this form but I'm going to come back in another form because the only way you're going to be restored back is if I keep cleaving to you I've got to stay in constant communion with you so you're not going to see me but you're going to see me I'm not going to be with you but I'm going to be with you because I'm going to come back in a different way and it's going to allow me to be with you day and night 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 and a quarter days a year all the way to the attorney and he says what I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you even till the end of the world what is it he's cleaving to us because that's the requirement for Redemption is you've got to cleave to them to hold them and bring them back amen amen we need our bridegroom to cleave to us when we don't even know that we he's our bridegroom that's the beauty of it is we don't even know who we are and yet he's there and he's wooing us and he's calling us and he's cleaning us and he's doing all these things to us and half the time we don't even realize it didn't realize it I should say he says yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but you see me and because I live you shall live also Deuteronomy 31 8 says and the Lord here it is that God does go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed amen let's stand together if we would I think so often we put so much pressure on ourselves it's because we believe we're back under the law we don't realize it but guess what that's what Catholicism is is it's the login but the law of redemption is not based on our performance our performance got us to where we need Redemption and so when you step into the Redemption Covenant when you step into what he's got planned for you then you realize that it has to be a work of his and the only thing you have to do is submit yourself to it accept it recognize your need and that is up to him to do it what did Boaz do and Ruth he he says I'm going to redeem you he gives her food to carry her through so she doesn't have to work anymore and then he she goes and she rests and she rests and she rests until he walks up and says I've got the title D you're good to go I'm going to marry you and everything's going to be okay and you're never gonna have to work a day in your life what is it as soon as she stepped into the Redemption Covenant all of her stress went away the only word she had is is he really going to do it and Naomi said fear not he'll do it he'll do it he's the kind of man that's going to do it and so often we're sitting there and we're saying because we look at these Redemptive Life scenes and we look at healing and we look at deliverance and we look at at all these different things salvation and we say I've got to do something no no you don't have to do anything his Redemptive work is what's going to do it and the only thing you're trying to do is get back to cleave to him so that you're not getting in his way then you're just letting him do the work it takes all the pressure off amen you look at we talked about pouring everything into it all we have to do is pour everything we got into him that's it that's all it all you're doing is getting him to the place where you're not getting in his way right and then it's his work it's his work you're clothed in his righteousness so your conscience can't bother you anymore Satan's got no weapon against you when it comes to your conscience because your clothing is righteousness under the blood of Christ listen we have no powering of ourselves but on the Redemption path all we're doing is we're looking to the gifts that he gives us to keep us going until he restores us back to that full end then so we once we get on that Land once we get into our property all we do is stay in line with him we stay close to him and that's what takes care of it all that's all we're looking to stay close to him and even as a study the more I've studied over the last year for certain the thing that jumps out of me is stay close to him stay close to him get in relationship with him amen I I feel and I see so often and not so much I I Believe by God's grace in this church but it's not about saying just Amen to the word but it's having a relationship with the word itself amen amen amen where you go to pray and you know that he's listening amen and you know that he's answering and though he tarries yet he's still going to answer amen and you've got faith and I love her brother Noel Johnson said you know he says I've got to the point where he says I pray and I committed to God and I walk away knowing that he's going to meet the need that's what I want to be that's where I want to be amen where I don't have to sit there and worry and worry is he going to do it is he going to do it he's going to do everything well and he's going to do everything in his time and if it's if your name's on the title then whatever Zone that title is going to Belong To You by the end of this amen and whether it takes you a day or whether it takes you three centuries you're never going to live three centuries but you might lay in the grave for three centuries but in the end he's going to do all things well amen and that's what you just have to trust is that he's going to do what he said he would do that's how we live we live by faith this is a walk by faith this is a faith generation amen amen amen if we could only just oh it's a thing that's just driving me these days is give him the time and then don't worry about time you know give them the time to do what he said he would do don't worry don't fret don't get caught up in trying to make it happen that's the worst thing is if Abraham he he told Abraham be perfect produce the word and Abraham every time he tried to produce the word messed it up why because he tried to do it his way and that's our problem is we try and produce it our way rather than saying Lord have your way have your way sister morning would you play that song have your way I don't know it I don't know the the thing but we're going to pray even as she she plays that and then we'll sing have your way turn it over brother Bob my voice is going here amen I want a closer relationship with him amen I don't just want church services I don't just watch church sermons I don't just want to study for intellectual knowledge I'm in but I want to know the word and then the person of the word in a greater way than I've ever had it before amen amen let's just bow our heads Lord God [Music] Lord how our hearts Lord they just desire to be closer Lord for a purity of relationship Lord a purity of commitment Lord where we cleave to you and we cleave away every other thing Lord God and Lord if we can't do that what hope do we have and yet Lord we mean to us Lord and you cut away those bonds that hold us Lord you cut away those things that are holding back the very life within us Lord and you draw us to yourself and your blood covers us and it cleans us Lord and sometimes you give us a spanking because of it but Lord You're always cleaving Lord when we run you're reaching out to overtake us and catch up Lord when we walk away you just step right over to us and say not today Lord we know you can't leave your word but you've got a long arm Lord and you've got a gracious nature that reaches out to pull us back every single time and so Lord we're praying tonight nor that sometimes we've sealed so far away Lord it seems like a Rapture is so far in the distance but we look at the times and we say it's close but maybe we don't feel it's close in our bodies Lord in this Fallen nature we have but Lord I'm praying you lift us higher tonight Lord that you would cut away those strings Lord that you would cleave us away from it Lord that willfully we'd step closer to you this evening Lord that we would say Lord have your way in our lives Lord we've tried it our way Lord we want to have more of your way tonight lawful we know that perfect Redemption only comes when we let you have your way for grant us Grace this evening we pray Lord even through the rest of the week more that we be drawn Closer to You Lord in true relationship Lord True Fellowship Lord one to the other Lord back and forth not a one-way Street Lord but you talking to us and us talking to you nor where we can open up our lives and let you in and have your way with us we pray grant us Grace Lord
