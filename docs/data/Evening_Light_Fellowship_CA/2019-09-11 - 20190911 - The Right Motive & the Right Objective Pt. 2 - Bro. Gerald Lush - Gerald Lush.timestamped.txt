[41:10] [Music]
[41:26] Amen praise the Lord may the grace of
[41:29] God to cover us they met matt'll
[41:33] we need the covering by the grace of God
[41:36] so the Lord bless you
[41:38] I bring greetings from our brother Doug
[41:44] and sister Berta Gayle
[41:46] amen amen they again in western
[41:50] Newfoundland of course his brother
[41:52] Doug's sister Beverly and also our
[41:54] sister and Edna gay brother clods wife
[41:56] in the home there and she's doing well
[42:00] even that even at her age and she's
[42:03] always been an active person amen and
[42:06] alerting the might so we break out there
[42:09] sir but in talking to sister Beverly
[42:12] today I was advised that a gentleman
[42:17] that some of us know but not all that's
[42:19] a brother George he HEA th and the heath
[42:25] family some full force from said western
[42:29] Newfoundland and I've ministered to them
[42:31] many years ago in where was it Hampton
[42:38] yeah in brother at the time it was
[42:42] brother Bruce Parsons Church of course
[42:44] that church is not there now but I did
[42:47] minister to many in the in the Heath
[42:49] family most of them now of course are
[42:52] moved to the mainland and gone but I was
[42:56] advised that one of the heat members has
[43:01] moved back or her I guess it's a late
[43:05] lady and her husband but she also had to
[43:08] bring back her brother and that was uh
[43:11] that was brother George brother George
[43:16] Heath and of course he was in a home
[43:19] in New Brunswick but now they've bought
[43:22] him back and he's in the same home that
[43:24] sister Edna is in in dearly and of
[43:27] course we understand that it's not
[43:29] because of his age but it's because of
[43:31] his problem
[43:34] mentally and so on so we pray the grace
[43:38] of God to him in the home in Deer Lake a
[43:40] man and also we prayed the grace of God
[43:43] to a Pentecostal brother that maybe
[43:51] won't mention his name but I understand
[43:53] that he's restricted now from ministry
[43:57] in in the seniors on there because of
[44:02] course he's taken such a strong stand
[44:04] for the Christian walk in the Christian
[44:08] life so I pray God bless Lester brother
[44:11] and I'm sure that if I mention his name
[44:16] you would know him because he assisted
[44:19] us with brother clouds funeral he sang
[44:24] specials there and so on and he cuz he
[44:27] does sing and he does play music so we
[44:31] appreciate his help there and he there
[44:33] was just a right spirit a right attitude
[44:36] he was there and him when we had the
[44:39] funeral service and he traveled with us
[44:41] all the way from dearly to Bishop Falls
[44:43] and was there a man as we committed our
[44:47] brother body back to the back to the
[44:50] earth
[44:50] so we pray God bless him as he continues
[44:53] to take his stand for the Lord
[44:55] a man so and I think it's because he's
[44:59] so strong in
[45:02] even what he says and how he says that
[45:04] this is why I think they just don't want
[45:07] that a man this it's the world in
[45:10] general that's looking for looking for
[45:13] the ministry to compromise looking for
[45:16] the ministry not not to be so hard but
[45:18] just just just preach basic Christianity
[45:23] you know and that you know and basic
[45:25] Christianity is just all just talk about
[45:27] Jesus what he did and you got to receive
[45:30] him and so on but you're not allowed to
[45:33] put the emphasis on the life a man to go
[45:36] and live live the life take your stand
[45:38] for the gospel take your stand for the
[45:39] truth take your stand for the Lord and
[45:42] so on so brother sister cousin oh yeah
[45:45] it's going to get to the place where we
[45:46] won't be allowed to preach those things
[45:48] and even even though it's online right
[45:51] now and on the internet we won't be
[45:57] allowed to say this won't be allowed to

[57:54] Amen praise the Lord God bless you turn
[57:59] with me to first chronicles chapter 13
[58:10] first chronicles chapter 13 you can
[58:20] remember again of course brother Karsan
[58:22] sister Sharon in prayer because our
[58:25] brothers will be moving from where he is
[58:27] presently in Ontario and he's got work
[58:32] in another part of Ontario and so I've
[58:35] been moving from brother John Simon's
[58:37] Church to another church and I
[58:40] understand he said he was to move two
[58:42] and a half hours away from where he is
[58:44] right now
[58:45] so we pray the grace of God to be with
[58:48] him and of course he's having fellowship
[58:51] I think maybe in near that church he's
[58:55] having fellowship with sister Vera
[58:58] Moulton and originally she's from pure
[59:02] Newfoundland and of course her husband
[59:05] it was was died some many years ago and
[59:09] he was buried there in in in Buren area
[59:12] in Newfoundland and well of course
[59:14] myself sister Betty visit it is his
[59:16] grave you grieve a number of times and
[59:19] but sister Vera she was in the message
[59:23] and she moved to New Brunswick first
[59:27] with her son Marie and but now of course
[59:30] she's in Ontario and in a home in
[59:33] Ontario as far as I know so we pray God
[59:35] bless sister Vera and brother Carson did
[59:38] take a picture of her on Monday well and
[59:40] while he was fellowshiping with her and
[59:43] another sister there and and sent us so
[59:47] and of course she's still an active
[59:49] sister even in her old age so god bless
[59:52] sister Vera a man and God blessed a
[59:55] fellowship that she laughs with our
[59:57] brother Carson and sister Sharon amen
[1:00:00] so keep these issues in prayer
[1:00:03] by the grace of God and of course to to
[1:00:06] keep remembering our brother Alec in
[1:00:08] prayer and grace of God to him a man
[1:00:11] together we certainly miss his
[1:00:12] fellowship and he in st. our verse
[1:00:16] chronicles rather and chapter 13 and
[1:00:20] beginning to read at verse 1 and the
[1:00:27] issue the thoughts that we've been
[1:00:29] discussing as is a right motive and a
[1:00:33] right attitude a right objective rather
[1:00:36] right motive and a right objective is
[1:00:38] doing things the way that God wants us
[1:00:41] to do it where when a now God wants us
[1:00:44] to do it is having the right motive and
[1:00:46] the right objective and it's and the
[1:00:48] right mode basically and the right
[1:00:50] objective is all for the glory of God a
[1:00:52] man is so that is God in control of your
[1:00:56] life is God in control of of what what
[1:00:58] he wants you to do what he where he
[1:01:00] wants you to do it and how he wants you
[1:01:02] to do it
[1:01:02] amen so it's not my real father that I
[1:01:06] can be done that's a big statement to
[1:01:07] make because it just does not apply just
[1:01:10] to our spiritual lives in a sense it
[1:01:12] does because what God wants us to do it
[1:01:15] brother in the in the natural part it's
[1:01:18] going to affect our spiritual lives and
[1:01:20] our spiritual walk with the Lord and our
[1:01:22] spiritual you know experience with him
[1:01:26] relationship with him is again not my
[1:01:29] will then be done so that so that why so
[1:01:32] that I'm not doing what I want to do I'm
[1:01:34] doing what God wants me to do and I'm
[1:01:36] not doing it where I want to do it I
[1:01:39] want to do it when I want to do it I'm
[1:01:41] doing it exactly the way he wants you to
[1:01:43] do it where when and how a man it's a
[1:01:47] tremendous statement is a tremendous
[1:01:49] experience to have to be in the perfect
[1:01:53] will of God
[1:01:54] a man sir brother I pray the grace of
[1:01:57] God that we are that we have the desire
[1:02:00] we have that hunger that thirst to be in
[1:02:03] the perfect will of God so that I'm not
[1:02:05] out of the will of God I'm in the will
[1:02:07] of God whether it's a whether it's doing
[1:02:09] this or doing that whether it's saying
[1:02:11] this and saying that whether there's my
[1:02:13] association with this one on that one
[1:02:15] door regardless that is the
[1:02:17] of God so that it so that I'm not led by
[1:02:19] my my feelings and I live by my senses
[1:02:22] I'm led by the Holy Ghost sons and
[1:02:24] daughters of God are led by the Spirit
[1:02:27] of God a mayor and brother were and if
[1:02:29] you're led by the Spirit of God it is a
[1:02:31] token it is a proof that you do your
[1:02:34] living in the spirit and you're walking
[1:02:36] in the spirit a man by the grace of
[1:02:39] Almighty God and brother it takes it
[1:02:41] takes that kind of a life it takes that
[1:02:43] kind of a walk to go you know in a right
[1:02:47] motive and a right objective so God help
[1:02:49] us is my prayer and brother if there's
[1:02:52] anything that the bride needs in this
[1:02:54] hour is there a motivator right
[1:02:56] objective that's the only way that we're
[1:02:58] going to we're going to go from time to
[1:03:00] eternity that's the only way that we're
[1:03:02] going to we're going to get into the
[1:03:03] resurrection and into the rapture
[1:03:05] whether we've got to have the right
[1:03:07] motive and the right objective in what
[1:03:09] we're doing and how we do it and when we
[1:03:12] do it and where we do it amen although
[1:03:14] we do and I know they're there there are
[1:03:16] those that don't believe that they feel
[1:03:18] they know God's going to God's going to
[1:03:20] forgive us of this God will ignore this
[1:03:21] and God will ignore that brother we're
[1:03:23] not in Luther's age we're not in
[1:03:25] Wesley's age we're not even in the
[1:03:27] Pentecostal age a man we are in a bright
[1:03:30] age look what God is looking for in the
[1:03:33] age of the bridegroom and in the Alpha
[1:03:35] ministry what is God looking for in the
[1:03:38] Omega ministry a man brother this is not
[1:03:41] Luther this is not Wesley all of that is
[1:03:43] in between but whether there is a
[1:03:45] beginning and there is an end God God
[1:03:48] there was a perfection that God was
[1:03:50] manifested in the beginning and there's
[1:03:52] a perfection that God is looking for in
[1:03:54] the end a man brother it takes something
[1:03:57] there brother that although the rest
[1:04:00] never had they never experienced with
[1:04:02] the bride is the brightest periences
[1:04:04] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:04:07] of the Holy Ghost a man and then in
[1:04:10] going from that into the revealed Word
[1:04:12] the mystery the revelation of the
[1:04:13] mystery of God a man and we're going
[1:04:15] from the Alpha right into the Omega a
[1:04:18] man and his truth God requires something
[1:04:21] of us when the part of God said that the
[1:04:24] fullness of the Godhead bodily he said
[1:04:26] is now in the bright brother the
[1:04:29] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:04:30] the bride and I claim to be the break
[1:04:32] what does God require of me what is God
[1:04:35] expecting of me what is God expecting of
[1:04:37] you a man
[1:04:38] but look what God will he got to look
[1:04:40] for and wanted to do and manifest in the
[1:04:43] Alpha ministry and brother now it is
[1:04:45] real mega ministry he started this a man
[1:04:48] he laid his life down he picked it up
[1:04:50] again and he come and he put it into the
[1:04:52] body ain't man and little by little by
[1:04:55] little even he was pouring himself into
[1:04:57] the body under the fullness of the
[1:04:59] Godhead bodily is now in the bride a man
[1:05:02] he was pouring into the profits the
[1:05:04] progress the progress two prophets tell
[1:05:06] it was the God prophet a man the
[1:05:08] fullness of the Godhead bodily in the
[1:05:10] end the god prophet even our Lord Jesus
[1:05:13] Christ now it is in the in the braid a
[1:05:15] man brother you talk about perfection I
[1:05:18] pray God we're not going to listen to
[1:05:20] the devil to give us excuse us and to
[1:05:22] give and use this for you know just to
[1:05:25] get out of our way from the
[1:05:27] responsibility
[1:05:28] I love the revealed word amen the thing
[1:05:31] oh well our God don't require this God
[1:05:33] will require that brother that's the
[1:05:35] devil amen as it was in the Garden of
[1:05:38] Eden so it is now a man he's trying to
[1:05:41] undermine that what God requires he's
[1:05:43] trained doesn't you know what to make it
[1:05:44] a little smaller to change a little
[1:05:46] little here just and again understand
[1:05:49] this
[1:05:49] he'll give you just one word a man so
[1:05:53] brother's going to take it's going to
[1:05:54] take the whole truth nothing but the
[1:05:56] truth because the fullness of the
[1:05:58] Godhead bodily is in the bride and
[1:06:01] brother even if the fullness is in the
[1:06:03] bride what is God looking for in the
[1:06:06] bride when is God requiring in the bride
[1:06:08] and again all mine no wonder the prophet
[1:06:10] of God again said and he said God is
[1:06:13] waiting on us
[1:06:14] a man what for the rapture and the dead
[1:06:17] in Christ are waiting on us from the
[1:06:19] resurrection because Jesus said I am the
[1:06:21] resurrection of life but now that same
[1:06:24] guy that same Jesus is in the bride a
[1:06:27] man and it was me that was the break
[1:06:29] room now and now it's the bride and his
[1:06:32] missus Jesus Christ
[1:06:33] praise the name of the Lord and brother
[1:06:36] a he said I am the resurrection and the
[1:06:38] life and if he is in the brain now the
[1:06:41] right is the resurrection and the life
[1:06:43] and that
[1:06:44] like ah that's why God is waiting on us
[1:06:46] amen brother and that's why God in this
[1:06:50] hour he gave us the example and he
[1:06:53] manifested what resurrection amen five
[1:06:56] times the Father God spoke and the Dead
[1:07:00] was resurrected amen
[1:07:02] five times brother and brother now God
[1:07:05] maybe if God did that brother what is
[1:07:08] God expecting in you and me if we
[1:07:10] believe the word we believe the a and
[1:07:12] the probably believe that the Prophet
[1:07:13] did this the probably did that a million
[1:07:15] what a regard to him to do we did it a
[1:07:17] man
[1:07:18] I pray grace that what God is expecting
[1:07:20] of us and what God is who wants us to do
[1:07:23] and we got a right motive and a right
[1:07:25] objective for the glory of God and for
[1:07:28] the resurrection and the mother rapture
[1:07:29] and brother were ARR mode of an
[1:07:31] objective is for their sake amen not
[1:07:35] just ours but they're theirs as well and
[1:07:37] for the aim for the sake of the gospel
[1:07:40] so god help us rather than I tell you
[1:07:42] this you talk about a.m. or mine the the
[1:07:49] the the right motive and a red object to
[1:07:51] that that Martin Luther had and that
[1:07:53] Wesleyan and the Pentecostals had God
[1:07:55] God bless them God honor their faith a
[1:07:57] man because they had a right motive and
[1:08:00] a right objector they've been what God
[1:08:02] revealed they believed a man and they
[1:08:05] and brother many laid down their lives
[1:08:07] for it they lay down their life they
[1:08:10] took their stand for it did it didn't
[1:08:12] matter to them they weren't going to
[1:08:13] change ER they believed it a man it's
[1:08:15] thus sayeth the Lord
[1:08:16] a man so I am do we believe as much as
[1:08:20] they believe in the sixty-eight million
[1:08:22] down through the church agents laid down
[1:08:24] their lives amen brother are we gonna
[1:08:28] lay down our lives brother who know the
[1:08:30] father God said we won't go on to death
[1:08:32] and be killed no no but before before
[1:08:35] that happens we're going to be
[1:08:36] resurrected
[1:08:37] we're gonna be raptured will we cut out
[1:08:39] of time and into eternity by the grace
[1:08:41] of God my brother it's gonna be those
[1:08:43] they got that faith a man and brother we
[1:08:47] if we got that faith we got a right
[1:08:49] motive and a right objective it's not
[1:08:51] just as our brother George Smith was
[1:08:53] bringing out it's not just doctor and
[1:08:54] doctor and doctrine doctrine no no
[1:08:56] brother
[1:08:57] it's it's eternal life a million
[1:09:00] it goes beyond doctrine to eternal life
[1:09:02] by the grace of God and Jesus proved it
[1:09:06] in the Alpha now he's proved it in the
[1:09:09] Omega amen brother you got a tremendous
[1:09:13] responsibility God requiring it of you
[1:09:17] don't think God just Oh Lord I believe
[1:09:20] the message yeah so there's the devil
[1:09:22] but the devil can talk it and the devil
[1:09:25] can tell you this and tell you that by
[1:09:27] the letter of the word but not the
[1:09:29] mechanics not the dynamics the mechanics
[1:09:32] but not the dynamics a man there's too
[1:09:35] many in the mechanics of it but they
[1:09:38] don't have the dynamics of it grace of
[1:09:41] God amen and in first chronicles chapter
[1:09:50] story chapter 13 and David consulted
[1:09:58] with the captains of thousands and
[1:10:00] hundreds and with every leader and David
[1:10:05] said unto all the congregation of Israel
[1:10:08] if it seemed good unto you that it be of
[1:10:13] the Lord our God let us send abroad unto
[1:10:19] our brethren everywhere that are left in
[1:10:22] all the land of Israel and with him also
[1:10:26] to the priests and Levites which are in
[1:10:28] the cities and suburbs that they may
[1:10:31] gather themselves unto us and let us
[1:10:35] bring again the ark of our God to us for
[1:10:40] we enquire not at edit in the days of
[1:10:44] Saul and all the congregation said that
[1:10:48] they would do so for the thing was right
[1:10:51] in the eyes of all the people but was it
[1:10:55] right in the eyes of God a man and how
[1:10:59] they were going to do it and the way
[1:11:01] they were going to do it was it right in
[1:11:03] the eyes of God and the subject here is
[1:11:06] our brother party said it is doing a
[1:11:08] right thing in the wrong way
[1:11:10] a man and this is what this is what
[1:11:13] David was going to discover that he was
[1:11:15] doing he was doing the right thing but
[1:11:17] he wasn't doing it the right way a man
[1:11:20] stood brother/sister again you have a
[1:11:23] right motive and a right objective but
[1:11:25] yet if you don't do it in the right way
[1:11:27] and with the right motives and again
[1:11:30] right motors objectives in your heart
[1:11:32] then brother is not pleasing to God amen
[1:11:38] but yet we'll see why David what David
[1:11:43] did wrong was that he did wrong it was
[1:11:46] right in that he wanted to get the Ark
[1:11:48] of the Covenant back to Jerusalem that's
[1:11:50] right but how how did God wanted him to
[1:11:54] do it he didn't do it the way God wanted
[1:11:57] him to do it Amen so he said in verse 3
[1:12:02] let us bring again the ark of our God to
[1:12:05] us for we we inquired of our God -
[1:12:08] inquired not at all in the days of Saul
[1:12:10] and all the congregation said they would
[1:12:14] do so for the thing was right in the
[1:12:16] eyes of all the people a man and a
[1:12:19] preacher can preach and everything is
[1:12:21] right in the eyes of the people that's
[1:12:23] right but what is it right in the eyes
[1:12:24] of God a man so David gathered all
[1:12:30] Israel together from shyer of Egypt even
[1:12:33] under the entering of emeth to bring the
[1:12:37] Ark of God from cursor serum and David
[1:12:42] went up in all Israel - Bela that is -
[1:12:47] kershaw serum which belonged to Judah
[1:12:50] and he said to bring up thence the Ark
[1:12:53] of God he said the Lord that dwelleth
[1:12:56] between the cherubims whose name is
[1:12:59] called on it and they carried the Ark of
[1:13:03] God in a new cart out of the house of
[1:13:07] abinadab aza and Eyal drave the cart and
[1:13:14] David and all Israel played before God
[1:13:17] with all their might and with sing and
[1:13:21] with harps and with psalteries
[1:13:24] with timbrels and with symbols and with
[1:13:27] trumpets a man and when they came under
[1:13:32] the threshing floor of shaitan as a put
[1:13:36] forth his hand to hold the earth for the
[1:13:38] oxen stumbled and the anger of the Lord
[1:13:42] was kindled against aza and he smote him
[1:13:46] because he put his hand to the ark and
[1:13:49] there he died before God and David was
[1:13:54] displeased because the Lord had made a
[1:13:56] breach upon aza where for that place is
[1:14:02] called Paris aza to this day and David
[1:14:07] was afraid of God that day saying how
[1:14:10] shall I bring the Ark of God home to me
[1:14:15] and so David brought not the ark home to
[1:14:19] himself to the City of David but carried
[1:14:22] it aside into the house of a medium or
[1:14:25] better a bit Adam to get light a man and
[1:14:30] the Ark of God remained with the family
[1:14:33] will bid Adam in the is house three
[1:14:36] months and the Lord blessed the house of
[1:14:40] a bit of them and all that he had god
[1:14:43] bless his words you may be seated
[1:14:49] we'll get to more of it in in hopefully
[1:14:53] if the Lord would late leads us but
[1:14:56] again David was doing something right
[1:14:58] but he was doing it wrong and we can be
[1:15:03] doing something right but do it wrong if
[1:15:05] we're not led by the spirit if it is not
[1:15:08] the spirit in control if it is not the
[1:15:10] spirit governing us and the spirit
[1:15:13] giving us the revelation that we need to
[1:15:15] do it the way that God wants us to do it
[1:15:18] a man to do what God is requiring of us
[1:15:21] so brother sister listen is considered
[1:15:24] again more seriously concerning their
[1:15:27] the motives and the objectives that
[1:15:29] govern our lives the motive and the
[1:15:31] objections that govern my life the
[1:15:33] motive and the objections that is
[1:15:34] governing your life is it right in the
[1:15:37] eye
[1:15:37] of God a man is it God in control or in
[1:15:41] Satan in control what was the motives
[1:15:44] from the objections that govern Adam and
[1:15:46] Eve in the garden a man there was a
[1:15:49] motive and there was an objective that
[1:15:50] God had revealed but yet when and when
[1:15:53] he went outside the garden to the tree
[1:15:55] of knowledge not an outside the garden
[1:15:57] but she left her husband and what does
[1:15:59] she do she went over to the tree of
[1:16:01] knowledge of good and evil
[1:16:03] she went out from it under her husband's
[1:16:05] spirit and her husband's authority and
[1:16:07] she went under another anointing and
[1:16:09] another spirit a man and she met the
[1:16:12] serpent a man and the devil was at work
[1:16:16] we're going to take the serpent and the
[1:16:18] devil was been using the serpent a man
[1:16:20] to influence Eve through the tree of
[1:16:23] knowledge of good and evil a man and
[1:16:26] brother as it was then so it is now that
[1:16:29] Satan used the tree of knowledge of good
[1:16:31] and evil as Satan is using the tree of
[1:16:33] knowledge of good and evil now a man so
[1:16:36] we got to be on our guard to make sure
[1:16:38] that brother we're going to stay under
[1:16:40] under the control of our bridegroom amen
[1:16:43] we're not going to come out from under
[1:16:44] the control of the second Adam as he
[1:16:46] came in from under control of their
[1:16:48] first Adam a man and she come under
[1:16:51] another influence we come under another
[1:16:53] power another anointing and it was the
[1:16:55] devil in the serpent a man and it was
[1:16:58] through the tree of knowledge of good
[1:17:01] and evil and we're living in a world
[1:17:03] that is now become a becoming more and
[1:17:06] more controlled by the tree of knowledge
[1:17:08] of good and evil amen and understand
[1:17:11] this in the tree of knowledge of good
[1:17:13] and evil
[1:17:14] Gabe relation of the word and it was 99%
[1:17:19] the truth amen but he he had added that
[1:17:23] he had added another word and he had
[1:17:25] changed what God had said God said who
[1:17:28] take of the tree of knowledge of good
[1:17:29] and evil and he said you shall surely
[1:17:32] die he-man but again the devil came and
[1:17:36] said you shall not surely die a man he
[1:17:41] was putting maybe a little little doubt
[1:17:43] in her inner mind a little thought in
[1:17:46] her mind to get her to get her to think
[1:17:48] old well not surely to
[1:17:51] oh well maybe maybe everything will be
[1:17:53] all right you know and and so this this
[1:17:56] won't bother the Lord and as the devil
[1:17:58] said oh and she believed the devil the
[1:18:01] devil city so you shall be as God's
[1:18:03] knowing good and evil a man he was
[1:18:08] justifying what he had so lead
[1:18:10] he was justifying his reasoning and
[1:18:14] train getting her to take of the tree of
[1:18:16] knowledge of good and evil
[1:18:17] oh I'm not saying there can be as the
[1:18:19] devil but you're going to be as God a
[1:18:21] man Oh fine so that was that was the CBD
[1:18:26] brother and if the devil is deceiving
[1:18:29] the bride and saying oh if you if you
[1:18:32] take of this well you're still going to
[1:18:34] be the bride a man and you're gonna be
[1:18:36] you're gonna be ordained and pray for
[1:18:38] the resurrection and for the rapture
[1:18:40] brother as the devil was doing then to
[1:18:43] Eve the devil is doing now ain't man
[1:18:46] there was a first Adam there was a
[1:18:48] second Adam and there was the first even
[1:18:51] there is a second Eve hey man I trust
[1:18:54] were not the second either we're not
[1:18:55] going to be to see a man but yet there's
[1:18:58] going to be there's many that that
[1:19:00] profess we believers but there they have
[1:19:03] the same anointing they're the same
[1:19:04] spirit as he did a man and the enemy and
[1:19:08] the enemy is a man is deceiving them
[1:19:11] into taking whether other part of God
[1:19:13] said and he'll had this or do you take
[1:19:16] away that a man as I say there are
[1:19:18] people that take a message book or the
[1:19:21] Bible in the end just oh and I wondered
[1:19:24] I said Lord there are those are there
[1:19:26] that's reading the Bible every day and I
[1:19:28] said how in the world can they live the
[1:19:29] life they live and do what they're doing
[1:19:32] I said have to reading the Bible but the
[1:19:34] thing of it is just reading the the
[1:19:36] mechanics of it but they're not into the
[1:19:39] dynamics of it a main issue it's just
[1:19:42] like reading a fairy tale amen oh yeah
[1:19:45] the Bible said did the Bible say that
[1:19:46] but they don't take it serious
[1:19:48] as man think they're not thinking well
[1:19:51] you know that God requires this of us
[1:19:53] God required that of them and much more
[1:19:56] than God require of us
[1:19:58] a man but the enemy is there to say yeah
[1:20:01] but yeh and God said yes God said but
[1:20:05] God don't require that of you that's the
[1:20:06] Old Testament hey oh yeah and that's
[1:20:09] what God told them that's what God told
[1:20:11] them but that God don't require that of
[1:20:13] you because of Jesus a man and you're
[1:20:16] pointing to Jesus you put on the Calvary
[1:20:18] now he said Jesus did it all so you
[1:20:20] don't have to do anything
[1:20:22] amen because you believe what Jesus did
[1:20:24] you believe he died you believe he laid
[1:20:26] his life down you believe that he picked
[1:20:28] it up again oh yes I do
[1:20:30] well he redeemed you hey man that's
[1:20:33] where the enemy is telling the so-called
[1:20:36] Christians today they believe the devil
[1:20:38] and brother he is persuader them that's
[1:20:41] all you need to believe us all you've
[1:20:43] got to believe is that hey man you don't
[1:20:45] have to believe this you don't have to
[1:20:46] do this you don't have to do that just
[1:20:48] believe what Jesus did and leave it a
[1:20:51] man no no if you're going to believe
[1:20:53] what Jesus did it ended or wonders with
[1:20:55] Jesus amen God is going to require more
[1:20:58] of us than he did of others amen
[1:21:01] because now Christ is in me and
[1:21:04] Chryslers revealing the word to me but
[1:21:06] the enemy is there amen they get us just
[1:21:08] just to read it but not to take it
[1:21:11] serious a million neither thing they got
[1:21:15] well Lord you Oh David did that they
[1:21:17] don't take it serious just read Ian and
[1:21:20] it is history
[1:21:21] oh it's just what happened in the Old
[1:21:23] Testament that's just what happened you
[1:21:25] know in the days of David that's just
[1:21:27] what happened back back in that age and
[1:21:30] so on but they don't take it serious and
[1:21:32] consider the fact that that those
[1:21:34] spirits are around the people today
[1:21:37] those spirits are enclosing the people
[1:21:39] today hey man we're dealing with the
[1:21:42] same devil a man brother listen overly
[1:21:47] guarded the devil never never never
[1:21:49] deceived
[1:21:50] David brother he did he would he was
[1:21:54] influencing day Davis thoughts hey man
[1:21:57] he was controlling David's arts and and
[1:22:00] listen he know he recognizes it oh he
[1:22:02] knows that God is going to do this and
[1:22:04] God is going to do this and and this one
[1:22:07] got this idea that one got this idea
[1:22:09] and the enemy to go over here let's see
[1:22:11] listen see the devil is there he see God
[1:22:14] God is there and the devil is there
[1:22:16] Jesus is here and then shows the devil
[1:22:19] and some part of the gosset he's the
[1:22:21] first one in church a man yeah well what
[1:22:25] about Jesus would he come with you a man
[1:22:29] but the devil was here before you got
[1:22:31] here hey man sir brother we go we got
[1:22:34] the enemy to deal with and David had the
[1:22:36] enemy to deal with the same devil you
[1:22:38] and I are dealing with David dealt with
[1:22:39] a man and when David got this idea in
[1:22:42] his mind oh I'm going where to go get
[1:22:45] the Ark of the Covenant I want to bring
[1:22:46] it back to Jerusalem and I wants to what
[1:22:50] he wanted to do this he wanted to do
[1:22:51] that but brother he had to do it God's
[1:22:53] Way hey man when it comes to the Ark of
[1:22:57] the comment you got to do it God's Way
[1:22:59] you just can't do it your way and think
[1:23:01] well well Lord
[1:23:02] my thoughts are right my motive is right
[1:23:05] my objectives are right and so on so
[1:23:07] Lord yeah but you got to do it God's Way
[1:23:09] if your motive is right and your
[1:23:12] objective is right make sure that you're
[1:23:15] going to be led by the spirit amen and
[1:23:17] David was oh yeah I want to get the Ark
[1:23:20] of the Covenant I want to bring it back
[1:23:21] to Jerusalem and so that we're going to
[1:23:24] worship God and God is going to be in
[1:23:25] our presence God is going to be in our
[1:23:28] vets because God is between the
[1:23:30] cherubims in the Ark of the Covenant
[1:23:31] amen so brother's sister what David was
[1:23:35] was endeavoring to do a man he was doing
[1:23:38] the right thing but he was doing it the
[1:23:40] wrong way
[1:23:41] amen brother if you're going to do the
[1:23:44] right thing do it the right way a man is
[1:23:48] not your ideas not your thought don't
[1:23:50] get the devil is anointing to do it make
[1:23:52] sure you get the Holy Ghost and I need
[1:23:54] to do it ain't man sons and daughters of
[1:23:56] God are led by the Spirit of God they're
[1:23:59] controlled by the Spirit of God amen
[1:24:02] brother because they're impersonators
[1:24:04] and they're led by the night the Spirit
[1:24:05] of God they're led by the spirit of the
[1:24:07] devil amen that's what control II would
[1:24:11] say with a satanic spirit and this is a
[1:24:13] spirit at all when the enemy saw David
[1:24:15] and David oh yeah the Bible says right
[1:24:18] here that David consulted with captains
[1:24:20] of thousands and
[1:24:22] and with every leader a man my brother
[1:24:28] whatever the priesthood whatever the
[1:24:31] profit amen
[1:24:33] did he consult the Prophet no amen
[1:24:38] so the enemy the enemy knew what David
[1:24:41] was doing because he had consulted so
[1:24:43] many and brother it wasn't a secret
[1:24:45] thing because he had consulted with the
[1:24:48] captains of thousands and hundreds and
[1:24:51] with every leader so brother I tell you
[1:24:54] this if anybody knew what he was doing
[1:24:55] it was the devil and God knew what he
[1:24:58] was doing but God let him go on justice
[1:25:00] just to bring out these things just to
[1:25:03] teach us make sure your motive is right
[1:25:05] your objective is right make sure it's
[1:25:08] under the anointing of God Amen so that
[1:25:13] your motive is controlled by God your
[1:25:15] your objective is controlled by God
[1:25:18] your you're led by the Spirit amen
[1:25:20] praise the name of the Lord so this for
[1:25:24] that David right here brother he was the
[1:25:26] way it was right but yet he didn't he
[1:25:29] didn't do it get the way that God wanted
[1:25:31] to do it Amen now brother he should have
[1:25:34] known better because David David I ought
[1:25:37] to have known better because he knew the
[1:25:39] way they got it ordained at Amen when he
[1:25:42] brought for the Ark of the Covenant in
[1:25:44] the first amen
[1:25:46] he knew where he knew the way that God
[1:25:48] said you got to do this you got to do
[1:25:49] that you got to do that and brother he
[1:25:51] knew call yeah he had a revelation of
[1:25:55] the word even back then a man but he
[1:25:58] thought you know I'm the king I'm the
[1:26:01] leader of Israel and so you know I want
[1:26:06] to do this and I wanted that and the
[1:26:07] enemy no doubt as I say in in his
[1:26:10] conversation with the others the enemy
[1:26:12] the enemy was influencing David amen oh
[1:26:15] listen David's going down to bring the
[1:26:18] Ark of the Covenant back to Israel amen
[1:26:20] what is it brother he's gonna bring in a
[1:26:22] revival in Israel Oh the Israel is
[1:26:27] getting back to the Lord again listen go
[1:26:31] down and tell David to do this good
[1:26:34] and influence David to do that oh yeah
[1:26:39] that's right we'll see if we can
[1:26:42] influence him we'll say if he's gonna
[1:26:44] listen to us and that he okay
[1:26:47] he won't concern you won't consult the
[1:26:49] Prophet but you consult the the leaders
[1:26:52] of the people no brother you got to
[1:26:55] consult the Prophet amen it's not
[1:26:58] consulting the even then when it comes
[1:26:59] through the this ministry or that
[1:27:01] Minister another ministry make sure you
[1:27:03] go back to the Prophet amen there's a
[1:27:07] final ministry but make sure it's
[1:27:09] according to what the Prophet said amen
[1:27:11] they got to line it up with dust saith
[1:27:14] the Lord amen but the enemy got David to
[1:27:18] consult this one and this one in this
[1:27:19] one amen and that wasn't according to
[1:27:22] the way that God had ordained it amen
[1:27:25] his motive was good and it is objective
[1:27:28] but brother if it's for the glory of God
[1:27:31] yeah but you got to do it God's Way no
[1:27:35] matter what you what you're gonna do
[1:27:37] what you feel all I want to do this and
[1:27:39] I want to do that yeah that's good but
[1:27:40] isn't you and you feel it's to the will
[1:27:42] of the Lord a man boy feels the will of
[1:27:44] the Lord wow you're gonna do it now
[1:27:46] you're gonna do it God's Way your your
[1:27:48] way brother the ministry has got to be
[1:27:51] in God's control
[1:27:52] oh yeah the prophet of God was in God's
[1:27:57] control amen brother with if he got it
[1:28:00] alone the Lord went down and brought him
[1:28:03] back in line again and he would repent
[1:28:04] oh he did probably God would repent if
[1:28:08] God God said no you're doing this you
[1:28:10] shouldn't do this you shouldn't do that
[1:28:11] he said oh I'm sorry
[1:28:12] and lo any any line up with with with

[1:28:19] the Word of God and the will of God amen
[1:28:22] brother so we're going to do it God's
[1:28:24] Way but there's many administering
[1:28:26] brother today
[1:28:27] it's not doing it God's Way there's many
[1:28:30] administering brother today is not under
[1:28:32] the influence of the Holy Spirit but the
[1:28:34] Holy Spirit amen
[1:28:36] there's many a ministry brother brother
[1:28:39] that's under the influence of a false
[1:28:40] spirit a man as the enemy was
[1:28:42] influencing David as the enemy
[1:28:44] influenced prophets a man oh yeah
[1:28:48] Balaam the Prophet when when they they
[1:28:51] wanted him to come and curse Israel oh
[1:28:53] yeah and they say if you do we'll give
[1:28:56] you money how hardly shall they that are
[1:29:01] rich get into the kingdom listen I tell
[1:29:06] you this if money katrinka controls you
[1:29:10] are you put too much emphasis on money
[1:29:17] then where were the ones that Jesus
[1:29:19] spoke about how hardly shall it shall
[1:29:23] the rich enter the kingdom and they said
[1:29:28] you mean to tell me that that the rich
[1:29:29] want can't be saved won't be in oh yes
[1:29:32] but he said all things are possible with
[1:29:33] God but again that that person got to
[1:29:38] humble themselves to God and will see
[1:29:40] the rich man wouldn't do it a man God
[1:29:47] challenges your love for riches God
[1:29:51] challenges your love for possessions to
[1:29:56] see if you're going to give up this and
[1:29:58] give up that he knew he knew the rich
[1:30:00] what what was in the heart of the rich
[1:30:02] man not only that Jesus loved him
[1:30:04] because he did every whether the room a
[1:30:07] number of the Saints thank you for it
[1:30:11] expressed appreciation for the thoughts
[1:30:13] we've ministered on on Sunday and
[1:30:16] brother Matthew came with with and he
[1:30:19] said yes brother that's right any any
[1:30:21] expressive thoughts there and he
[1:30:23] concerning the rich man amen and Ananias
[1:30:27] and Sapphira that's right what was the
[1:30:32] problem
[1:30:32] it was either a right motive wrong
[1:30:35] objective or a wrong objective or right
[1:30:37] matter objective in the wrong motive and
[1:30:40] yet they were professing Christians but
[1:30:43] God dealt with
[1:30:45] God dealt with David God dealt with that
[1:30:49] with Balaam God dealt deals with the
[1:30:50] prophets God dealt with Israel a man
[1:30:53] when they wanted to do what was right in
[1:30:55] their own eyes and do it their way and
[1:30:57] not God's Way a man and going god can
[1:31:02] judge david and did this and did this he
[1:31:05] said now he said David he see well I'm

[1:32:03] motive what was the problem with their
[1:32:06] objectives that Anna
[1:32:10] that Ananias died right at the beat of
[1:32:15] Peter oh they are you because why the
[1:32:21] spirit that was on and the influence

[1:32:53] it all to the Lord
[1:32:55] you lead the impression that you're
[1:32:57] giving all to God

[1:47:46] their faith amen but yet they believed
[1:47:49] and they trusted God what about the
[1:47:52] three Hebrew children just thing the

[1:51:39] you you know you got they wanted to
[1:51:42] worship the king because the king was
[1:51:43] their God and then you know and they

[1:51:53] prayed he opened it up the drape he
[1:51:57] opened it up to look towards Jerusalem
[1:51:59] he wasn't going to hide it and he prayed
[1:52:04] unto the God of Abraham and they went
[1:52:08] reported him to Daniel to the king oh

[1:52:41] from Daniel ain't ma'am he was afraid of
[1:52:44] Daniel Daniel wasn't afraid of him amen
[1:52:47] so brother sister no matter what God
[1:52:50] allows us to come into your life while
[1:52:52] our lives
[1:52:53] know what we got to be tested by him
[1:52:55] tried by Hema we're not afraid of that
[1:52:58] if anybody's gonna be afraid let the
[1:53:00] devil be afraid of you a man but we are
[1:53:04] more than conquerors through our Lord
[1:53:06] Jesus Christ amen
[1:53:08] you got the victory so brother sister I
[1:53:11] pray the grace of God that we're going
[1:53:13] to manifest the right motive and the
[1:53:16] right objective we're gonna manifest the
[1:53:20] life of Christ by the grace of God let's
[1:53:24] not do the right thing the wrong way
[1:53:26] let's do it the right way regardless of
[1:53:28] the price we have the pain grace brother
[1:53:35] it was rather matter that I lighted the
[1:53:37] rich young ruler a right motive but a
[1:53:40] wrong objective Israel his objective was
[1:53:43] selfish a man because he wanted treasure
[1:53:47] on earth not in heaven
[1:53:51] exactly so brother a right motive but a
[1:53:57] wrong objective he wanted to get more
[1:54:01] treasure on earth and so on because he
[1:54:05] was seeking eternal life what must I do
[1:54:08] to inherit eternal life he's more
[1:54:13] interested in narrating money popularity
[1:54:17] oh yeah a good name and Jesus said you
[1:54:24] wonder jesus knew his art Jesus knew his
[1:54:27] spirit jesus knew his attitude Jesus
[1:54:30] said well you know the commandments he
[1:54:31] said this this and this he said all of
[1:54:33] them have I kept from my youth oh I
[1:54:36] don't mean I don't think is anybody here
[1:54:38] to say that all of those commands he
[1:54:42] said if I kept from my youth up yet
[1:54:47] Jesus said there's one thing thou
[1:54:49] lackest one thing what's that he said
[1:54:55] sell all you have and give to the poor
[1:55:00] come
[1:55:02] follow me oh it struck you so hard I
[1:55:11] couldn't take it he couldn't take it no
[1:55:18] not by any means and he turned and
[1:55:23] walked away yet now listen Jesus loved
[1:55:29] him well God loves me so I won't be lost
[1:55:34] oh yes God loves you and God reveals
[1:55:38] himself to you now he's looking for the
[1:55:41] right motive and objective in your life
[1:55:43] for for the glory of God to give
[1:55:45] preeminence to God and the Word of God
[1:55:47] and you know that you give preeminence
[1:55:49] to walk to you to your brothers and
[1:55:51] sisters in the faith because you're
[1:55:54] living you're living for them
[1:55:56] well I'm didn't forgot but if you're
[1:55:58] living for God you live for your your
[1:56:00] brothers sisters in the faith you're
[1:56:02] living for your sons and daughters of
[1:56:03] God one time they did as I thought said
[1:56:12] about that that brother in in France
[1:56:15] when they were killing the people there
[1:56:18] and he saw them be aiding that woman and
[1:56:22] he took her place the man went over said
[1:56:26] no don't do that to her he said let me
[1:56:28] take her place do it to me just said
[1:56:32] what wait a minute he wasn't home but
[1:56:41] yet his heart went out to that woman and
[1:56:43] he said I'll take her place and they
[1:56:49] took the woman up let her go
[1:56:51] they took him put him down and be edited
[1:56:56] God rest his soul how many of us are
[1:57:01] willing to lay down our lives for one
[1:57:03] another how many of us are willing to
[1:57:07] sacrifice your life for your brothers
[1:57:12] and sisters in the faith hey man they
[1:57:18] were doing it in the day in in the first
[1:57:21] church age but Ananias and Sapphira
[1:57:23] wouldn't go all the way oh they went so
[1:57:27] far but they wouldn't go all the way
[1:57:30] they wouldn't they wouldn't give all to
[1:57:33] the body of Christ
[1:57:34] no no they wanted to keep some for
[1:57:36] themselves they owe and they would go
[1:57:40] off and say where the Lord blessed me oh
[1:57:42] yea the Lord prospered me knowing you
[1:57:45] didn't he didn't if the Lord prospered
[1:57:49] them you know what they would do they
[1:57:50] would give all and take nothing that's
[1:57:55] right yeah but the thing was they gave
[1:57:59] so much but they kept the rest for
[1:58:00] themselves and they would go around and
[1:58:03] say god bless to me God did this God did
[1:58:05] that listen sometimes it's the devil oh
[1:58:10] yeah though the devil yes the devil well
[1:58:15] look what he told Jesus on the on the
[1:58:16] Mount of Transfiguration or not did not
[1:58:19] train for liberation but on the Mount of
[1:58:21] temptation he said I'll give you this
[1:58:23] and I'll give you that what oh yeah he
[1:58:27] can prosper you because the devil he
[1:58:32] controls the things of the world so he
[1:58:34] certainly can prosper you sometimes God
[1:58:38] will bless you yeah right
[1:58:41] but again got a bless those those that
[1:58:46] can leave like your fun money
[1:58:47] god bless those that are able to that
[1:58:50] able to handle it but if you're not able
[1:58:53] to handle it you won't give it to you
[1:58:55] those that are so that they control it
[1:58:58] it don't control them but we're living
[1:59:01] in a world where prosperity controls the
[1:59:03] people
[1:59:04] grace to us brother it shows that our
[1:59:08] motives and objectives are wrong so god
[1:59:11] help us
[1:59:13] that by the grace of God will have a
[1:59:16] right attitude and a right spirit
[1:59:18] now take the spear of the rich young
[1:59:19] ruler no let me just bear with me and
[1:59:44] it's in Luke 18 he said a certain ruler
[1:59:49] asked him saying good master what shall
[1:59:52] I do to inherit eternal life
[1:59:55] what if you were told what to do would
[2:00:00] you do it he wouldn't do it
[2:00:04] what eternal life that's what we're
[2:00:07] going to that's what we're looking for
[2:00:10] that's what we're believing for well we
[2:00:14] got to lay everything down we got we got
[2:00:18] to come to that place and live that life
[2:00:20] that anointing in our lives where
[2:00:22] nothing controls us only God nothing
[2:00:26] controls us honey the Holy Spirit we
[2:00:28] follow his leadership amen the Antonio
[2:00:30] do you know you're crave is not me that
[2:00:32] lives against Christ liveth in me now if
[2:00:35] it's Christ living in you well look at
[2:00:36] what he lived 2,000 years ago and he
[2:00:38] lived that same kind of life now what he
[2:00:42] did then he'll do now in you and in me
[2:00:44] and I had how he did it
[2:00:46] you'll do it now oh yeah yes brother God
[2:00:52] granted we need it
[2:00:55] praise the Lord and it says what shall I
[2:01:00] do to inherit eternal life and you get
[2:01:03] an answer and walk away from it this is
[2:01:07] amazing
[2:01:08] and
[2:01:11] just said unto him why call us now me
[2:01:13] good none as good save one and that is
[2:01:16] God and thou knowest the commandments do
[2:01:19] not commit adultery do not kill do not
[2:01:21] steal do not bear false witness honor
[2:01:24] thy father and thy mother and he said
[2:01:28] all these have I kept from my youth up
[2:01:32] we haven't but he did thank God for the
[2:01:36] grace in our lives and when Jesus heard
[2:01:40] these things he said unto Him yet lack
[2:01:44] us now one thing you only like one thing
[2:01:47] what do we like yes amen the challenge
[2:01:55] and he said sell all that thou hast and
[2:02:00] distribute on to the poor and thou shalt
[2:02:04] have treasure in heaven and come follow
[2:02:07] me
[2:02:08] well if you recognize Jesus you honored
[2:02:13] him as Lord you'd think you'd be instant
[2:02:19] to obey what he said
[2:02:21] oh okay master that's what I'll do and I
[2:02:26] trust you amen
[2:02:28] I'll sell all I got and I'll give it to
[2:02:30] the poor as I said I don't believe Jesus
[2:02:33] meant that he did he had to dead that he
[2:02:35] had to heal just to make his family poor
[2:02:37] or whatever he would allow him to have
[2:02:39] enough there to look after his family
[2:02:42] and provide for his family a man that's
[2:02:45] right but Jesus knew what his art was on
[2:02:51] what he was living for and what he what
[2:02:54] he would oh I know God has blessed me
[2:02:57] because of this we judge we judge the
[2:03:00] the grace of God by what we possess we
[2:03:04] judge the grace of God by what we have
[2:03:06] that's right
[2:03:08] sometimes it's the grace of God for what
[2:03:10] we have not
[2:03:13] his grace that took this from us took
[2:03:15] that from us why because we're putting
[2:03:17] too much emphasis on it our faith was
[2:03:20] more in that than in God amen and he
[2:03:26] said thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[2:03:27] come follow me and when he heard this he
[2:03:31] was very sorrowful for he was very rich
[2:03:36] see again like one of the brother batten
[2:03:40] brought out
[2:03:41] I have every but now I see concerning
[2:03:44] the oil well then he told those those
[2:03:47] brothers about a man God was gonna bless
[2:03:52] him with it but they didn't do it God's
[2:03:55] time they didn't do it God's Way andhe
[2:03:59] finally they did they came up with
[2:04:01] brother Brown says the commercial ideas
[2:04:03] or we'll do this we'll do that what do
[2:04:05] something else God said no he just he
[2:04:07] just did this for them personally not a
[2:04:10] commercial not a business but to bless
[2:04:12] them personally that's all everyday
[2:04:15] living but no they wanted to build it
[2:04:18] big and make this and do that and do
[2:04:20] something what the world would do and so
[2:04:22] what God do God allowed those of the
[2:04:25] world to come in and get it before they
[2:04:26] got it
[2:04:27] why because their motives and their
[2:04:30] objectives in it was wrong what what
[2:04:35] they wanted to do and how they wanted to
[2:04:37] do it wasn't the way God wanted them to
[2:04:38] do it you don't do things the way the
[2:04:42] world does it you do things the way
[2:04:45] Jesus did it amen how would Jesus do
[2:04:49] this I would Jesus do that but it's in
[2:04:53] the word and when Jesus saw thee he was
[2:05:01] very sorrowful and he said Ardley show
[2:05:05] they that I riches enter into the
[2:05:06] kingdom of God for it is easier for a
[2:05:09] camel to go through a needles eye than
[2:05:11] for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
[2:05:13] of God and again again there was the
[2:05:18] family doctor many years ago that that I
[2:05:22] told you about and he also asked
[2:05:26] me all he said Jerome what is that
[2:05:29] what's the needles eye that the camel
[2:05:31] going to go through he thought was the
[2:05:34] Iver
[2:05:34] a needle that you saw with no I said
[2:05:40] that's not the eye of the needle I said
[2:05:44] a needles eye I said is the small door
[2:05:50] in the gate of the city I said they only
[2:05:55] opened the gates I said when there's a
[2:05:57] crowd going in or when the camels are
[2:05:59] going in whatever but I said the gates
[2:06:03] are closed for security and I said but
[2:06:07] in the gate I said they have a small
[2:06:09] door and I said you opened that small
[2:06:12] door to go in as an individual into the
[2:06:15] city that's the acid that's the eye of
[2:06:17] the needle and it's easier for a camel
[2:06:20] to go through the eye of the needle the
[2:06:22] hell he said then for a rich man to
[2:06:27] enter into the kingdom of God there's no
[2:06:29] way a camel could go through it you as
[2:06:31] an individual human being can go through
[2:06:33] it but not a camel no no but it is
[2:06:36] easier for a camel to go through that
[2:06:38] then for a rich man to enter the kingdom
[2:06:40] of God sir brother god help us to be on
[2:06:43] our guard god help us to be led by the
[2:06:46] spirit controlled by the Holy Ghost amen
[2:06:49] so that were what were heaven bound and
[2:06:55] it says and they that heard it said who
[2:06:59] then can be saved and he said the things
[2:07:02] which are impossible with men are
[2:07:03] possible with God
[2:07:05] a man grace of God so brother
[2:07:11] I pray that will not have the spirit of
[2:07:15] the rich young ruler no we're not at the
[2:07:18] spirit of Ananias and Sapphira with
[2:07:24] wrong motives right objectives or right
[2:07:26] motives and wrong objectives no no let's
[2:07:29] have the right motive and right
[2:07:30] objective giving God the preeminence in
[2:07:36] what we do how we do it when we do it
[2:07:39] where we do it all
[2:07:40] the glory of God a man so brother grace
[2:07:49] that we're going to do it God's Way your
[2:07:54] life my life we're going to do it God's
[2:07:56] Way do what God wants us to do how God
[2:07:59] wants to do it when he wants it to do
[2:08:01] where he wants us to do it is not my
[2:08:03] will Father thine be done
[2:08:05] amen so brother God give us the right
[2:08:11] motive right objective the right reason
[2:08:15] for what we're doing all for the glory
[2:08:18] of God amen I had a scripture here let's
[2:08:24] see mark now we had this we'll finish
[2:08:29] with this for tonight mark chapter 7
[2:08:37] mark 7 and verse 7 oh I didn't realize
[2:08:54] well thank God for giving me the voice
[2:09:01] in mark 7 and verse verse 1 then came
[2:09:07] together unto him the Pharisees and
[2:09:09] certain of the scribes which came from
[2:09:11] Jerusalem and when they saw some of his
[2:09:13] disciples eat bread with defiled with
[2:09:16] defiled that is to say with on washing
[2:09:22] hands they found fault for the Pharisees
[2:09:27] and all the Jews except they wash their
[2:09:30] hands often ate not only the trajector
[2:09:36] tradition of the elders and when they
[2:09:40] come from the market except they wash
[2:09:42] they eat not and many other things there
[2:09:45] be which they have received to hold as
[2:09:48] the washing of cups and pots brazen
[2:09:52] vessels enough table
[2:09:53] then the Pharisees and the scribes asked
[2:09:56] him why walk not thy disciples according
[2:10:01] to the tradition of the elders but he
[2:10:03] bred with on Washington's he answered
[2:10:06] and said unto them well as Isaiah
[2:10:09] prophesied of you hypocrites as it is
[2:10:14] written the people honor me with their
[2:10:16] lips but their heart is far from me so
[2:10:22] I'll be it in vain do they worship Me
[2:10:24] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[2:10:27] of men in vain do many a believer
[2:10:31] worship God why because they have the
[2:10:37] mechanics of the word but not the
[2:10:39] dynamics and the prophet of God did say
[2:10:42] himself he said that's the problem
[2:10:44] he said we're putting too much emphasis
[2:10:46] on the mechanics and he said not the
[2:10:50] dynamics
[2:10:51] he said brothers and sisters what we
[2:10:53] need is the dynamics what is the
[2:10:56] dynamics it is the life of the word
[2:10:59] because you can have to have the letter
[2:11:01] of the word and no life but we need the
[2:11:06] dynamics of it amen they got the
[2:11:09] dynamics make the mechanics live amen
[2:11:13] it'll make the mechanics flesh in you
[2:11:17] manifested in your flesh not in your
[2:11:21] head and your tongue but in your
[2:11:23] everyday living amen
[2:11:27] and the message doing God a service
[2:11:31] without his will
[2:11:34] the Prophet said we are in the end time
[2:11:37] and he said I get started on that and
[2:11:40] forget about time he said we're going to
[2:11:43] fade pretty quickly into eternity so he
[2:11:51] said I want to read Matthew Mark 7 and 7
[2:11:55] in vain do they worship Me teaching for
[2:11:57] doctrines the commandments of men so he
[2:12:02] said God is sovereign
[2:12:06] and we see here what David done in the
[2:12:09] scriptures and chronicles Eddie said he
[2:12:11] was and his intentions was good but he
[2:12:15] said God does not give us merits on good
[2:12:18] intentions he said there's only one way
[2:12:23] to serve God and that's by doing his
[2:12:26] will at his command and he said God
[2:12:30] being sovereign there's no one to tell
[2:12:33] him what to do or how to do it he does
[2:12:36] it his way he knows the right way to do
[2:12:39] it and that makes me feel good and it
[2:12:43] ought to make us all feel good he said
[2:12:47] I'm sure it does for one would have it
[2:12:49] coming in this way one would have it
[2:12:51] going that way or not on the other way
[2:12:53] but one great thing again about God he's
[2:12:57] not left us without knowing what's the
[2:13:00] truth and how to do it amen he said he
[2:13:06] wouldn't be just to punish up for us for
[2:13:08] doing something and he said that we
[2:13:11] didn't know how it was going to be done
[2:13:13] and then let us stumble into something
[2:13:16] he's not that kind of a god he's a God
[2:13:19] that speaks a word and expects his
[2:13:22] children to believe it and therefore he
[2:13:25] knows what's best and he knows when to
[2:13:29] do it and he knows how to do it he said
[2:13:33] we have our ideas of it but God knows
[2:13:38] amen
[2:13:40] so it's doing it God's Way brother a
[2:13:44] right mode and right objective
[2:13:45] it's got to be God's Way it's got to be
[2:13:48] a motive it's got to be motivated by God
[2:13:52] by the grace of God amen
[2:13:55] to give us the right objective it says
[2:14:00] God regulates the Sun he regulates
[2:14:05] nature to meet his word he regulates the
[2:14:08] church the predestinated the bride to
[2:14:12] meet the season that they are living in
[2:14:14] amen praise the name of the Lord yes
[2:14:17] indeed
[2:14:18] by the grace of God now I say don't miss
[2:14:25] this they failed to get it because they
[2:14:29] hadn't consulted by and by doing that by
[2:14:32] going to the priest by going to
[2:14:34] theologians by going to military forces
[2:14:37] but he said not considering their God
[2:14:40] sent messenger of the hour Nathan they
[2:14:43] did it wrong what referring to the
[2:14:47] scripture that we read in Chronicles
[2:14:50] where they went to do what was right but
[2:14:54] they did it wrong why because they say
[2:14:57] they never consulted God's messenger he
[2:15:02] said they he went and he talked to these
[2:15:04] these thousands rather and these these
[2:15:08] leaders and so on but he said they never
[2:15:11] consulted the Prophet to get his
[2:15:12] thoughts he meant and just look what it
[2:15:18] cost it was a blessing to one man
[2:15:25] because where they had to leave the Ark
[2:15:28] of the Covenant they left it in his own
[2:15:32] her brother's somewhere is that it you
[2:15:35] must have been right his spirit must
[2:15:37] been right because God blessed him for
[2:15:40] three months while the Ark of the
[2:15:42] Covenant was in his own he was blessed
[2:15:44] oh yeah
[2:15:46] the power the anointing the the presence
[2:15:49] of God was there
[2:15:50] Oh mind the love of God was there and
[2:15:52] all he was richly blessed amen the peace
[2:15:56] of God but why the God dealt with David
[2:16:04] in another way God dealt with Israel in
[2:16:06] another way because they never consulted
[2:16:08] his prophet he said they went and they
[2:16:12] picked up the ark and they put it on a
[2:16:14] new cart they put it upon he said a new
[2:16:16] cart or a new denomination is going to
[2:16:20] start up and not upon the God given
[2:16:23] ordained way to pack it it was supposed
[2:16:25] to be packed on the shoulders of Levites
[2:16:27] not a cart
[2:16:31] and when you start wrong you'll keep on
[2:16:35] going wrong so come back to the word
[2:16:39] brother and let's start right there's
[2:16:48] got to be a right motive right objective
[2:16:50] not for the glory of man but for the
[2:16:53] glory of God
[2:16:55] David was wanted to do this one do that
[2:16:58] oh yes because we want want the
[2:17:00] blessings of God we want the you know
[2:17:02] the presence of God with us and so on
[2:17:04] yeah but you got to do it God's Way and
[2:17:07] it was supposed to be on the shoulders
[2:17:09] of the Levites not on a cart that's
[2:17:12] right and when the when the when the
[2:17:14] animals begin to tremble and the cart
[2:17:17] begin to shake and that brother that was
[2:17:20] there all due respect to that brother
[2:17:22] not saying that he was lost no not by
[2:17:26] any means but his heart went out because
[2:17:29] he was afraid that the ark was going to
[2:17:30] fall off the cart and he went out to
[2:17:32] hold the current and when he did he died
[2:17:37] before the Lord so he's not lost but he
[2:17:40] died before the Lord yeah
[2:17:42] and why because only the priesthood
[2:17:46] could do that he couldn't do it see you
[2:17:50] got to do it God's Way so brother
[2:17:54] there's many a man and woman around the
[2:17:56] world word and run the message today
[2:17:58] they're dead spiritually oh yeah because
[2:18:02] they're doing this and they're doing
[2:18:03] that and they're doing something else
[2:18:04] but I'm not doing it God's Way they're
[2:18:07] doing it their way what they think what
[2:18:09] they feel no no you gotta be led by the
[2:18:11] spirit always her brother listen what
[2:18:17] time we are living in what's the age
[2:18:20] what's the hour that we are living in
[2:18:22] it's not time for these things that they
[2:18:24] are talking about that's passed judgment
[2:18:27] is on end now and you can see it
[2:18:30] breaking you remember the rock upon the
[2:18:34] mountain judgment hour you remember the
[2:18:37] revelation or the vision of the bride
[2:18:39] just keep her in step don't better get
[2:18:42] a step that was the last vision that the
[2:18:47] Prophet had of the bright he saw this
[2:18:51] group and that group going down and
[2:18:54] singing onward Christian soldiers and
[2:18:58] the one group went on down and the other
[2:19:02] group began to go up and as that group
[2:19:05] began to go up he noticed that near the
[2:19:09] end they were getting out of line and
[2:19:11] they were focusing on one another but
[2:19:15] you had to focus on Christ and follow
[2:19:17] him in the rapture and they were just
[2:19:21] you know distracted and the prophet of
[2:19:26] God in the vision he screamed stay in
[2:19:30] line stay in line never getting out of
[2:19:32] line he says stay in line
[2:19:34] amen and that was his last warning to
[2:19:39] the Bride of Christ stay in line
[2:19:42] not with this brother of that brother
[2:19:44] stay in line with the Lord stay in line
[2:19:47] with the revelation of of our Lord Jesus
[2:19:50] Christ
[2:19:50] he has come for the bride a man he has
[2:19:53] come for the right a man God gave us the
[2:19:56] revelation the understanding we need a
[2:19:59] man to stay in line with the reveal word
[2:20:04] stay in line with the revelation of the
[2:20:07] Resurrection the revelation of the
[2:20:09] rapture amen look up our Redemption
[2:20:12] draws nigh this keep our edit our
[2:20:15] motives rate our objectives right
[2:20:18] brother what is the rate Motors read
[2:20:21] objectives for the bride not the natural
[2:20:24] things of life the spiritual amen if you
[2:20:28] cost you on that on the spiritual God
[2:20:30] broke down to look after your natural
[2:20:32] God look after this God look after that
[2:20:35] so just just keep focusing on the
[2:20:37] spiritual amen and then that the natural
[2:20:40] will fall in line by the grace of God
