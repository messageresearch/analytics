Exodus chapter 16 amen we certainly are welcoming those that are with us online tonight it's been a couple of weeks since the the folks in Newfoundland in particular have been able to join a service so we want to welcome them and say God bless you it's good to have you with us and the different ones that are are online now as well from different places for sure amen we want to remember a couple prayer requests Blanca will be flying home with Samuel on Saturday getting here about 2 A.M on Sunday morning so praying God's grace to her vaishal is flying as we speak to India so praying that God will be with him and then kingsley's flying home this weekend as well from uh Nigeria so just praying God's grace to them we know that travel is hectic at the best of times and these days it seems worse than ever so praying God's grace to them and then we also have a birthday today I believe it's brother Mark's birthday today yes I believe he is 76 no 67 67 amen so happy birthday to you brother Mark amen good to have you with us always amen Exodus chapter 16 and verse 1. it says and they took their Journey from elim and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the Wilderness of sin which is between Elam and Sinai on the 15th day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt and the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness and the children of Israel said unto them would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this Wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger then said the Lord unto Moses behold I will reign bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and then we want to continue our series on Redemption and we want to take a thought tonight again of of no turning back in the second part I'm sorry my clicker's not working up here if you can hit the next slide we'll see if it picks up as we go through remember we're going to take a a a second portion of of no turning back amen and we talked last time about how pharaoh and the armies came up against Israel and God had led them supernaturally into a place where they had walls on both sides and they had the desert in front of them and they had the water behind them the Red Sea behind them and then after that God had had lured the Egyptians down the same path he had miraculously opened the Red Sea and when he did that then the Israelites crossed safely and then pharaoh and his army tried to follow through and we learned that if you're not supernaturally meant to follow with God then you'll fall off the path it'll be to your ruin every single time but we wanted to understand how that the supernatural leadership of God will take us to places where we think we're in danger and it'll take us to places of trial and it'll take us to places maybe where we're feeling tempted in these different things and is God bringing us to those places for our good and for our deliverance and for the destruction of Satan's kingdom amen and so the lesson we were supposed to learn there is that when the walls close in and when things look bad and things look poor then don't get worried don't get frantic don't start to panic don't start to complain because if God has led you there then God has a purpose in that amen and we saw after that and we won't read it for the sake of time but Exodus 15 is a song of praise and worship and victory and we see there that Moses sings his song of Victory there and he talks about how the Lord has has destroyed the Chariots and he's brought the sea crashing down and he's destroyed their enemies and and they're free and all these different things and then Miriam gets up and she takes a a timbrel she takes a tambourine and she leads all the sisters in the Jericho March before there even was a Jericho merch and they're running around the camp and they're shouting and praising and dancing and having all of these just this wonderful time in the Lord it was an amazing scene to see the wreckage maybe and the dead bodies of your enemies floating up and you're having a Revival service immediately after this and then we jump to verse to Exodus 16 which we just read and God is supernaturally leading them just as he did before the Red Sea the same leadership that was before the trial is now leading them after the trial and the the scripture tells us that they've been going for days they've been going for 45 days under the protection and the leadership of the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud nothing has changed it's still Supernatural Moses being be at the head of the line but he's following a cloud he's following the Holy Spirit he's following the presence of God and there are about a third of the way to Canaan if you look at the map they're about a third of the way if you calculate out what they've got there they're about a third of their way to the promised land when we get to Exodus chapter 16 and then we see that they get into trouble again so if we look here at Exodus 16 thank you brother Matt Exodus 16 verse 1 which we just read it says they took their Journey from Elam all the congregation of the children of Israel came into the Wilderness of sin to me it's always interesting that they entered the Wilderness of sin because that's what it became for them was a place of unbelief it was a place of death which is between Elam and Sinai on the 15th day of the second month after they're departing out of the land of Egypt 45 days in the presence of God visibly we know how wonderful it is to be in church and to feel the presence of God and yet we don't even get to see him most times I can only think of one time in my life that have ever seen a pillar of cloud in my life just once that's it in my entire life and they're sitting there for 40. they're walking for 45 days with a visible presence of God above them and with them day in and day out what that ought to have done for them what that ought to have done for them to see the visible presence the proof that God is with them day in and day out the unchanging all-powerful delivering Victorious God leading the way through the desert they're there and they're they're they're they're rich they're free they're taken care of they're delivered everything that we want as believers they have right there in that Wilderness as they're walking through not only that each and every one of them is in marching health I was reading through Exodus 16 because I knew it was in the Bible and I couldn't find it so I had to go searching and it was in Psalms 105. he said he brought them forth also with silver and gold we say that's wonderful I'd love that but he said but there was not one feeble person among their tribes not one feeble person now the scripture tells us that there were six hundred thousand men that walked out of Egypt on that on that Exodus morning so women and children they estimate they had at least two million people women children young old walking out you'd think as slaves they would have some some broken bones they'd have some some sore muscles they'd have something that would have held them back but it says on that day there was not one feeble person that walked out of that Exodus that day of God's Deliverance that day of God's the start of his Redemption not a single one was being held back by their physical ailments so we're 45 days in with the visible presence of God and they still have their health they still have the victory they still have everything that they've started out with and it's the entire thing is Supernatural they've got a sea full of dead Egyptians and sunken chariots because cherries don't float very well behind them in the Red Sea and they're walking and everything's great and the praise in the God and they're shouting and they're dancing until all of a sudden they aren't and we see how they go throughout this that every time they come up against any little trial any little struggle any other time where God didn't do something just the way they wanted in the way that they wanted and how they felt they needed it then they started to complain and all of a sudden they lost the Revelation they lost the benefit of the presence of God in their midst time and time again they start to complain and we see here in verse two it says the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness and the children of Israel said unto them word to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt notice that it says we wish God had killed us in Egypt God rather than saving us God rather than delivering us God rather than redeeming us God rather than healing us and bringing to this little hardship we're facing we wish you to just left us where we were in our slavery and in our misery and you killed us if your Redemption could have been death that would have been better for us than what we're going through right now 45 days of the supernatural presence and all they're saying all of a sudden they're saying God you should have killed us why they said when we sat by the flesh parts and when we did eat bread to the full for you have brought us forth unto this Wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger their belly's got a little tight their faces got a little pinch they lost maybe that little bit of fat they might have had in in the good eating after leaving Egypt and not having to slave and work the way they did but as soon as they did it as soon as they came to a place where God didn't give them everything they felt they needed they started to complain and what were they they were ungrateful they were ungrateful God had done so much for them and then he held back did he hold back because he couldn't do a church he held back to see where their hearts were he was testing them to see what they would do what the nature what the heart what the attitude of the people was going to be as they moved into this towards this land of Canaan amen and you can notice an ungrateful person every single time an unbeliever is what they are because what happens is they look to the past as a greater blessing than the present even if God has been leading them to where they are today we can get that way sometimes where we forget all of the things that God has done for us because we're so caught up in the circumstances of this moment that's what caught up with the children of Israel time and time again and you'll see those people and I'm not saying it's not me I'm saying you'll see people that they are grateful until something bad goes wrong and then they forget everything and what they do is they take and they take and they take and they take and then the minute they can't take anymore they get ungrateful they're never giving they're always taking and so when they don't get what they want they have nothing to offer except complaints and it drives division into things amen they forget what God has done they forget that God is with them and he's trying to do something with them right now because they're so focused on how they're feeling what they're missing what's hurt them what's causing them some sort of discomfort and they've forgotten that God has led you to this point and he's got you here for a reason right now the prophet of God will put it this way he said ungrateful we've got that kind of people in the world today you don't realize that the bread you eat and the Very air you breathe comes from God I want to ask us this evening are we grateful for everything that we have from the small things to the big things because what I found is if you're not grateful then God will usually pull it away for a little bit just to let you see how blessed you truly are it's God's grace that we have what we have today it's God grace God's grace we have a roof over our head that we have food on our tables that we have money in the bank that we have our health that we have a church building to gather in brother Joe was just over in Tanzania and when you see the lives that they live in the houses they live in and the fact that they have to walk for hours many times just to get to church you say I'm blessed to be where we are today but let's not turn it into a curse by taking it for granted let's not take it for granted that we need all these things because let me tell you we can live with a whole lot less I've been down in third world countries I've been down maybe even worse than third world countries where they have nothing and yet God is with them and they feel that they are blessed we have much to be thankful for amen do our lives reflect that gratefulness so often we're looking for the next best thing instead of realizing that we're perfectly okay right where God has us right now that we can deal with what we've got for quite a while longer before we truly have a need before we're truly hungry listen you see those pictures that the National Geographic used to have them uh you know of over in Ethiopia when they had that famine and they had war and all these things and they had babies that had a belly that just came out like this not because they were so full but because they were so hungry that it distended their belly that's how that's how little they had to eat and we worry if we we don't maybe make the bills for one month or maybe we have to eat a little different because inflation's killing us in these different things amen let's not be ungrateful he's met our needs and he continues to provide our needs amen but brother Brown would say this he says now the question is for us tonight do you care he cares but now do you care if you don't care then he can't help you but if you care enough or care about yourself I've heard people make this insane remark I Don't Care What Becomes Of Me oh my I sure Care What Becomes of me and I believe any person in their right mind cares I want to know what's going to happen to me and I know if he loved me there's no one else could love like that he cares for you he says he cares for you so if you know that he loves you if you know that he's called you if you know that he's filled you with the Holy Spirit you have to know that he cares for you and whatever situation you're in is because he cares for you no matter how hard it looks no matter how difficult it is he cares for you but listen how he puts us he says no matter how little you are how insignificant you are how poor how indifferent he says how many times you've tried and failed he still cares his love still knocks at your heart's door he says but are we ungrateful for that sometimes they're so caught up in the moment with its trials and its problems and we forget we've only even survived and made it to this point because of the grace of God that he's kept us through so many other things through many dangers toys and snares I have already come but it's his grace that's brought me this far and as it's his grace it's going to take me all the way home amen so whether we're standing on a Mountaintop in clear air and in clear air on top of the big mountain sometimes you can see for a hundred miles and you're up there and you're full of Victory and praise that's a wonderful thing and you say God is with me but he's as much with you down in the valley where he's placed you into battle where you're struggling and striving day in and day out as you are on the Mountaintop you had to go through the valley to get to the Mountaintop and it was his grace in the valley as much as it was his grace to get you to the Mountaintop amen we're there because he cares listen sons of God Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God and so where we are today in our life as long as we are led by the Holy Ghost as long as we're in accordance with the word of God is because he wants us to be exactly where we are you might not like where you're at today trials are rarely easy or fun nor do we nor do we volunteer for them but we're there because he wants us to be there because he's got something for us out of that situation amen how many of us would say I'm grateful for this trial one person I don't I don't ever say it while I'm going through it but when you look back afterwards and you see what is done in your life and you see the benefits of it you can usually say praise the Lord for what I've gone through amen I always bring it back to the gym and working out because I exercise regularly I went on Monday I was operating about 80 percent I had slept poorly and Mondays are leg day leg day is the worst day it's the hardest days the heaviest day you move the most weight your whole body is tired out and I went there and so often I just feel old quite frankly in the gym and you go there and you exert and you sweat and you get stars in your eyes and you wonder why you're here but if you look back into what it has done for you throughout your life to where you can stand today and you can be healthy and you can be fit for service and God can use you and you don't get sick easy and you don't tire out as much you say that's why I keep going here that's why I'm sweating it out that's why I'm flushed that's why I'm so worn out here is because I know in the end this is better for me than if I didn't do it at all that's why we exercise that's how we eat that's why we eat well isn't it some of you have the benefit of liking to eat vegetables I don't I don't like most vegetables but the reason I eat them is because they're good for me I don't enjoy vegetables but I enjoy the benefits of vegetables I much prefer sugar and donuts and chips but that doesn't do any good for me and so sometimes I've got to eat something I don't really like so I can get what I really want and that is a healthy body that's so that I don't fall over when I'm 55. of a heart attack or or have to go on on some sort of medication that that is debilitating for me or keeps me down we do we have to do things we don't like because they're good for us and God knows that sometimes we've got to be forced into doing the things we don't like to get to the good things that he has for us in these situations amen we have to learn as Believers to embrace the challenge to embrace the trial to embrace the situation and say as long as my conscience is clear according to the word of God because it has to be clear according to the word of God not just clear because sometimes our consciences are seared and just because you don't feel anything doesn't mean there's nothing wrong it's got to be clear according to the word but if our conscience is clear by the word of God then we know that where we are today where we are tonight is because he wants us there it's not a we're not in a hardship of our own making remember Paul says listen if you do wrong and people give you a hard time about it he says there's no glory in that he says it's only Glory if you do right and people persecute you but if you do wrong and people call you out for it he says you deserve that because you did wrong so don't make sure that if you're in a tough time that you're not there of a decision of your own making of a path of your own choosing rather than one that's according to the word of God but if we know that we're there by the word of God then we can have faith that God's going to take us through it and it'll be to our benefit every time now First Peter 1 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope a Living Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not a way reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time verse 6 says wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be Ye Ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations did you catch what he said there I highlighted it to to make sure you catch it because he said Rejoice that you are kept by the power of God even if now because it's needed because it's necessary you're going through many Temptations you're going through many trials you're going through many difficulties amen we go through as a Believer many Temptations or trials because they are needed Peter says they have a purpose amen they are doing something to us and I believe that one of the things that they do is they separate us from the world and the influence of the world because you give in to a Temptation one time you'll see the fruit of that Temptation and you won't like it and next time that Temptation comes around hopefully you can turn it down and say I don't like what that did last time I'm not going to do it this time he teaches us sometimes our our will gets in the way and so he has to say all right you go down that path for a little while you do that for a little bit see where it takes you and then come back to me and let me know how you want to move with the rest of your life do you want to go there do you want to come back to where I am amen when it comes to Temptation This just dropped him while I was studying it's kind of off the topic but what is Temptation because we beat ourselves up as Christians sometimes because we're tempted what is Temptation temptation is simply a choice will you follow the word of God or will you follow something else now the classic case is when Jesus was the the in one in one book it says that the Holy Spirit led him into the Wilderness the other one says it drove him into the Wilderness to be tempted to be tried to be proven amen and Temptation if we see it is Satan whispering in your ear Satan whispering in your mind Satan trying to influence Satan trying to inject something into you that wasn't there to start with I want you to catch that because so often and I'll say this especially as a young man when I would be tempted by something what would happen is Satan would twist that scripture where Jesus said if you do it in your head it's as if you did it for for real you know he was talking about lusting after women but it goes through many things and I take that insane with twist and he'd say listen you just thought about it and you dwelt on it and therefore you're at fault as if you did it and guess what that's not true what he's trying to say is that thought originated from you that desire originated from you and then he'd try and get me to do it because I committed the sin of thinking about it in the first place when he's the one that put the thought in my mind in the first place because I've got God sitting here and I've got Satan sitting here and they're both trying to influence me and we're creatures that can be influenced because our mind our spirit can catch the thoughts of the spirit Realm we are receivers and so we can receive what the holy spirit's saying or we can receive what Satan and his kingdom are saying and so Satan will sit there and he'll say because you are tempted that is within you but it's not it's just Satan whispering in your ear but if he can get you to think it's something coming out of you he's got half the battle one because then you think you're already in sin and then it's easier to just continue further down the road amen it's Satan that's putting those mind those things in your mind and that Satan trying to awaken something that God has already defeated in your life I've said it before I remember when I went to the gym with Brother John I think it was his brother John Andrews or me it was Joe Adams and they were playing a song and I said that's the kind of music I used to like but guess what it didn't have any effect on me why because I've been delivered of that but let me tell you if I sat around that long enough Satan would start coming in there and he'd start reminding me remember how much you like that hey remember that other song that was on a tape because it was a tape that I listened to way back then right and he'd start to bring those memories to my mind and he'd start to try and build it into me thinking that I had a desire for that but yet I know when I walked in and listened to that I could identify it as something from my past I could identify it as something I defeated but I also knew it was familiar and if I stick around with something familiar Satan will try and put it back on me so I don't stick around with things that are familiar but don't get dragged down into thinking that because you're tempted to something in your past or something that that appeals to your nature your your human body that that is coming from you that is Satan trying to get you to do something that the holy spirit inside you is fighting and that's the reason that it doesn't happen easily is because you've got something inside you that's fighting for against it and saying I don't want to do this I mean this there's that saying that says you can you can you can't stop a bird from flying over your head but you can stop it from building the nest listen you can't stop Satan from firing darts at you you can't stop Satan from trying to attack you you can't stop Satan from trying to influence you but you can change your thoughts you can focus on something different you can turn on different music you can read a different book you can read a different Bible you can be in Fellowship you can change your friendship you can change your situation you don't have to sit there and listen to it but when you sit there and do nothing then Satan will occupy your time every single time listen Satan's got lots of time to talk he's got lots of patience to wait for an opening amen so we've got to backfill those things with the things of God and the good things of God and the victories of God and what he's done in our lives so that Satan knows we're not sitting there and listening and going back to what he thinks that he wants us to do amen brother Brown would say this he said some of you young people that has wasted your living the hours that mother spent in prayer for you and Dad all the teaching that's been done to you and yet you've turned it aside to listen to what the whisper of the devil now you're Desiring the music of the world you aren't Desiring it before he says but you listen to the whisper and now you're Desiring it Satan tries to tell you that desire was in you no no he built that desire into you because you kept listening to what his whisper now you're Desiring the music of the world the things of the world he says but you're coming to yourself like the prodigal in the pig pen he says would you raise your hand sister brother and say God remember me bring me to myself this morning and let me come to Father's house it doesn't cost you one thing he's expecting you no matter what you've done he says though your sins be a Scarlet they shall be white like snow red like Crimson they'll be white like wool check your thoughts church and put a filter on them and realize that if it's coming from the opposite side of where you're living then Satan is trying to influence you so you just put a filter on it and if it is contrary to the word then you just stop that and you start to read what the word says about the situation rather than listening to him try and tell you what's inside of you because the scripture says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world remember brother Bradham said in the quote he said to overcome means to recognize Satan in every one of his tricks so you recognize who's talking to you as Satan but that's not the end of the quote because he says and to realize that he that is within you is greater than he that is in the world you've got to have him on the inside and you've got to turn that conversation around and say I've got something living in me that's not going to allow me to go down that path that doesn't desire that and you're a liar Satan because that's what he is anything Satan says is a lie everything he cannot tell the truth he's a liar he's a liar church so if he's telling you a lie that means there must be truth in the word of God to offset what he's saying go find that and start reading it out to him you'll find he doesn't like it very much scripture says resist him and he'll flee and you resist him with the word it's not by strength it's not by discipline it's by the word of God that you're going to overcome amen Peter would finish and say that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ the effect of your trials he says it's more precious than even gold that's tried with fire the most pure gold he says isn't as valuable as what these trials produce in you because he says when Christ comes it will be honor and glory and praise unto him remember the scripture says they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony this is the word of your testimony that you came through and he tried you and you came through tried his gold you're pure amen you're proven you've got the very character and nature of Christ if we understood this if we accepted it how different would our attitudes be when we go through tough times when we don't get the answer we want when we want it in the way we want it how different would it be look what happened with them in in Exodus says then the Lord said unto Moses behold I will reign bread from heaven for you what a God you think he's maybe just supernaturally make the bread last that they had he said no I'm going to Reign it out of heaven for you I'm going to do something that's never been done before supernaturally to meet your complaining and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no I was reading this and something said stop catch that dig into it he said I'm going to prove them whether they'll walk in my law or not he says I'm going to feed my people in the way that I feed them the way that they gather it up is going to decide whether or not they are True Believers or not how they gather the food is going to determine who's going to walk in my law or not and this is a test right where they live folks this is right down this is home cooking he didn't ask them to go start a new ministry he didn't ask him to go give all their money away he didn't ask them to to give all their wealth away he didn't ask them to sacrifice all their cattle he asked them to do one little thing he asked him to do one little thing and he says this is going to prove Who You Are it reminded me as I was reading it of of the the parable of the talents in Matthew 25 and it said so he that have received five talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord thou deliverest unto me five talents behold I've gained beside them five talents more and as lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou Hast been Faithful over a few things I will make the ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord I believe God has gifts and blessings and Supernatural events for every single person in this congregation every single one of us but you'll notice so often that before you get the big things you have to be faithful in the small things and God will put a little test in front of you we say I wanna I wanna be blessed in the kingdom of God I want to do great things for the kingdom of God I have so much to offer and God says well I put something little in front of you do that because you've got to prove yourself faithful in the little things before you get into the big things amen if I want to do something for God I've got to use what he's given me now and when I proved myself faithful in that and if I stay humble then he'll add to it and if I stay humble in that then he'll add to it again and I'll go as far in the kingdom of God as I can humble myself that's the only requirement use what he's given and stay humble you do that and God will put you at the Pinnacle of his kingdom that's all he's looking for amen but it takes time and it takes proving amen and it's God putting me in it's God putting you through the ringer testing you to make sure that you're going to stay humble and that you're going to stay true to what he's asked you to do no matter the circumstances we don't jump to the top of the pyramid in God's economy you have to be proven listen he prophesied what Joseph was going to be and then he put Joseph through 17 years of hell he told David he was going to rule as King David having never asked for it and then he put David through 15 years of running before Saul he put Joseph or he put Moses through 40 years in the desert to mold him and break him down so that God could finally come and use him listen even Jesus had to be proved Jesus wasn't just born and immediately was blessed with the Holy Spirit and the way he was in the baptism of John but he was forced to go into the desert and he was forced to be tried and tempted and when he passed that then he had to go to a mount Transfiguration and there God gave him his full adoption so if Christ had to be proven if Christ had to be put through trials and Moses and Joseph and David then don't think that we're going to do any different we've got to be proven amen you see sometimes you you get maybe these young men in particular and they go to a great school they go to Harvard they go to Yale and they come out and they have this wonderful degree and they think that because I have a degree from a great University I should be put into a position of great responsibility at a company and they think they should be the CEO they think they should be a big shot they think they should be a manager right out of school and what happens is they go in and because they have no character but they have an education they can't even hold that job down much less be a CEO amen that's why a strong work ethic will get you further than a nice piece of paper every single time I never worried too much about what school I went to for my engineering degree listen I could go to to the best university in Canada and in the end if I can't come out and apply it and I can't have the right work ethic I'm not going to be a good engineer no matter what but if you come out thinking that because you got something that you're going to be something then you're severely going to be very sad you're going to be very disappointed in these things amen how many of us have worked in a job maybe the older ones amongst us and somebody comes in and thinks they're so great and they're so smart and guess what they can't even last a month because it takes a work ethic it takes Integrity it takes consistency it takes dependency it takes somebody that really is committed to their job to go through the proving time to get to the good times because what do you do with a with a new employee first thing you do is you give them a simple task and you say go do it and if they can't humble themselves to the simple test they're never going to get to the next thing or the next thing if they can't do the basics you're never going to give them any more responsibility amen and so what God's saying is here is he says I'm going to give them a little law and it's going to be a test to see if they can keep that little one whether they'll obey me when we get down the road to the big stuff because if you can't obey me in a little law what are you going to do when we get to Canaan you've got to follow my leadership as we take over that if you can't do what I say here in the wilderness when nobody's bothering you and there's no pressure on you then how's it going to work when we get to when we get to Jericho if you can't if you can't obey me here you'll never obey me when we get to Jericho because I've got very specific instructions waiting for you so we're going to give you a little instructions to see if you follow that and if you can't do that then you're not going to make it to the land what are our little test Church it's always the basics and yet that's so often where we trip up what are the basics dress right live right listen to the right music be faithful in devotions faithful and church attendance faithful and ties and offerings faithful to help when there's a need faithful in Fellowship these are just basics of the Christian walk and God says if you can't do that you'll never be anything in this Kingdom because if you can't do the little things how am I going to trust you with the big things we're sitting there so often we say I have so much to offer and God's saying yeah just do the little things first prove yourself in the little things and then we'll get to the big things I'm not going to go into details I'm going to I'm going to tell on myself for a little bit but I've been preaching on something recently and it was very direct it's very specific and I knew why it was I knew who it was for and I finished that service and the next day the Lord said he says that was a great sermon when are you going to do it yeah now let me tell you it's not that I wasn't doing it it's that what I was doing was 80 percent and he wanted a hundred percent okay sometimes we think oh I'm doing it but are you doing it the way he wants you to do it are you doing it with all your body Soul might and strength amen and so he said your city you're standing there and you're preaching and you know who that's for he says but you're only at 80 in that area yourself he says are you going to give that up are you going to let me have full control in that area of your life church I might be up here saying the words but he still holds me accountable the same way and so I had to do that and I had to humble myself and I had to say Lord you're right I've been trying to control that I've been trying to hold that too much I'll give that to you a hundred percent and as soon as I did within two weeks he had completely met the thing that I was trying to fight back the thing that I was trying to hold the thing that I was trying to control he had met the need he had taken control of the situation completely and above and beyond whatever I could ask or think it was pressed down shaken a measure flowing out into my life the need that I had that I was trying to control by holding back on God just the little things sometimes that are holding us back I'm less stressed now having given it up and given it back to him than I was trying to control it that's what I'm trying to let you hear give them the little things give them the little things and they'll watch the big things roll in after it amen look at this little test that God gives them he says and it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare what they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily so he said they're good they're supposed to gather a certain amount every day based on how much they eat he said but on the Friday they're supposed to gather twice as much he didn't explain it he just said do it he didn't say here's why you need to gather twice as much on Friday as you do any other day of the week he said just do it no explanation and so Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel and even then you shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt and in the morning ye shall see the glory of the Lord for that he heareth your murmurines against the Lord and what are we that ye murmur against us Moses reminding them that they're complaining against God but they're speaking to the ministry listen Ministry make mistakes sometimes we deserve the complaining but in this case they were complaining against the Lord God Almighty that was leading them and guiding them Moses said why are you coming to us with this he's the one that's LED you he's a great provider he's Jehovah Jireh why are you yelling at us and the Lord spake unto Moses saying I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel so speak unto them saying that even ye shall eat flesh and in the morning you shall be filled with bread and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God watch this now because he's going to use his provision to prove who's really a believer he says it came to pass that at even the quails came and covered the camp and in the morning the Doula round about the host and when the Dew that lay was gone up behold upon the face of the Wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the frost on the ground and when the children of Israel saw it they said one to another it is manna for they whis not what it was and Moses said unto them this is the bread which the Lord had given you to eat do you know what Manna means Manna means what is it the definition of God's provision was what is this it's the weirdest name I've ever heard of it's a question it's defined by a question I don't know what God's provision is sometimes we don't realize what God's provision is when it's standing in front of us staring us straight in the face and we're saying what is it I don't know I don't recognize it it's new to me I've never seen this before if you understand that you don't have to recognize it to benefit from it you'll go a lot further in life and your walk with God because sometimes what he brings in front of you doesn't look like the answer until you get into the situation and you realize this was God all along now I'm going to read this story and it's a familiar story but I want you to catch this idea because remember the children of Israel are hungry and sometimes we get to the point where we've given a lot and then what happens is we think that's all God requires us for us to give a lot but then God comes behind and he says give it all empty it out give me everything you've got and then Watch What Happens and brother Branham tells a story of the widow woman with the little child that came and had to had to give the meal and the oil to the prophet and make him a cake but I want to read this through just to kind of set this and we're going to be closing shortly it's a long set of quotes but I tried to cut it down and I said this is too good not to share the whole thing so just stick with me as we go amen because remember we're looking at something that God asked them to do without explaining it and sometimes that's the way it is with God is that you'll get an unction you'll get a leadership you'll get a conviction to do something and you don't understand why it's so extreme you don't understand why you have to give so much you don't understand why God's asking you when the person next to you could do it so much better that has way more energy way more time way more money way more gift whatever it is and God comes to you and he lays it on your lap and he says I need this from you listen to this program says this woman was a widow woman the drought was in the land and she'd started out after death of her husband she had a little baby to raise she was struggling to try and make a living for the little fellow and finally the bread began to cease and it come to a place one day when she went in to look at her little fellow she's seen his little sleeves out torn she might have looked at herself in the mirror and seen how she'd left the table with something on it for the baby and her own cheekbones was sticking out and her little frail looking arms she didn't mind it for herself but the little boy she was trying she didn't want to see him die so finally one day she went to the meal barrel and there was just one handful of meal left she goes over to the cruise to see how much oil and just about a good tablespoonful that stood between her and death I suppose that night there was an all-night prayer meeting he says isn't it strange how God lets us get right down to the end of the road the question is at the end of the road do we turn to complaining or do we turn to an all-night prayer meeting he says no doubt but she checked up said Lord God I've served you I've done all that I know how to do I've met your requirements and here I've got one handful of meal and a spoonful of oil between death for Child by child and myself he says all night long she must have prayed and the woman as she's seen that crucial hour coming no doubt she checked up and said Lord I've done all that I know how to do listen if you're at that place have faith have faith having done all to stare and stand as we said last service when you've done everything that you know how to do and met every requirement that God has required that's where Faith takes hold that's where faith comes in if you've met every requirement that God required you to do then sometimes God tests your faith to see what kind of a reaction you'll have on your action he said oh he's good at that it just proves whether you really believe what you think you believe you know he does that many times she was certain she'd walked up right before God and God proved it by inviting his Prophet to live with her she has nothing and now she's bringing God's bringing another mouth to feed see he says God confirms things so the morning was breaking the birds were beginning to sing as Dom began to break she looked at that little fellow again she patted him she knelt down and said Lord God he will be getting up in a few minutes I'll go and prepare the last thing I got and give it to who him and then I'll take him in my arms and we'll die together so she went and got the handful of meal he says now meal was a me it was now meal was a meal offering which means Christ the word she went to the last bit of the word that she could have she tried all of it she'd used it all up she's down to her last scripture she's down to her last thread of Hope and when they ground the meal offering in the days of the Bible they used a certain Burr that ground every little bit bit of meal just exactly the same there was no difference in it no difference in size he says well that types this the same means that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever when God ground his life out of him at Calvary he gave it to the church that he'd be the same yesterday today and forever amen then she goes and gets the oil the oil represents the spirit that's why we anoint with oil it represents the spirit and she put the oil and the meal together and begin to prepare it now catch this he says and when the spirit and the word gets together something's going to take place the word on its own isn't going to do it because the letter killeth but you put the cricketing power of the Holy Spirit to you that it is yours that it belongs to you that the promises of God are yelling amen for my life not just yours now something's going to happen he says she was at the end so she got the word and the spirit and began to mix it together now she he said it's ready for baking she goes out in the yard to pick up two sticks did you notice the Bible said two sticks you take two sticks and cross them and you put the fire right in the middle and as the sticks burn you push them in if you're out camping at night it keeps the fire going all night long pushing it in if the fire was in the middle he says if you notice those two sticks represented the cross he says self sacrifice he says now she'd mix the word and the spirit together and was ready to put it on the fire and she goes to pick up those sticks and perhaps she got the last one in her hand and was starting back in the house and she looked at the gate she's got everything she needs to prepare her last meal before she dies there was a gentle looking old man perhaps bald-headed Whiskers hanging down standing leaning across the gate he said would you fetch me just a little drink of water she looked at him and thought well I've got just about half a gallon in the house but the poor old fella looks so thirsty I'd be willing to divide it with him and she might have said yes kind sir I'll get you a little of the water because the Springs have dried up and everything all Waters has dried up and she started in to get the water it says and he knew listen to what brother Brown says now he says you see God answers on both ends of the line see so often we're sitting there we're saying I've got a need I've got a need I've got a need Lord help me Lord help me and he says God answers your need by sending you somebody with a need because you're going to be the answer to their need and they're going to be the answer to your need but you're going to have to give up what you have so you can get what they have he says about two hours before that the brook had dried up on top of the mountain where Elijah was he said Elijah go down to the city and keep walking until you find a woman with two sticks in her hand she's going to feed you he says God does things real this isn't just Theory this isn't just spirituality we don't walk around in a in a world of of clouds of ease and fairy tales it's real real struggles real pain real trials real hardships real loss real disappointment but he says God does things real and sometimes to get real he's got to strip us down to nothing to get us down to the bare Bedrock of our foundation with God so he can come in and build on that and give us a blessing that we can't we can't we can't contain he said I've sent you down there and she's going to feed you she hasn't got nothing in the house but I'm going to feed you and he walked down the street till he saw that woman packing those two sticks and that must be her so he had to catch your attention he said would you fetch me a little water she said I will now catch this now because she's got lots of water compared to the meal in the oil he asks her for something that is rare but that she has enough to share and she says I will listen to this next bit it said and as she turned and started he said and the and is the Killer every time give me what you're willing to share and then give me what you can't afford to share and God doesn't want what we're willing to give he wants to get he wants what we don't want to give that we can't afford to give that's too much the and was the killer here the and is her test it says and just bring me a little morsel of bread in your hand that's such a small thing to ask sometimes but when that's the last thing that that person has when you're asking for their last little bit of patience their last little bit of love their last little bit of consideration the last little bit of time [Music] when it's asked of us what do we do remember you've probably seen the picture it's been around a long time it says I've got one nerve left and you're getting on it what do you do when God says somebody needs that last nerve now that last shred of patience that last bit of composure that last bit of time that last night that you had free that last day in your week that you thought you could relax and now somebody has need what are you going to do now he says Elijah seen that Vision already knew what the condition was he knew what he was asking of her and she said as the Lord liveth Elijah knew she was a Christian then a Believer as the Lord liveth I've only got a handful of meal and a spoonful of oil that I've already prepared I've dressed it got it ready and I'm going to take these two sticks to make a little cake for my son and I we're going to eat it and die now you think as the prophet he would say I understand that's really heartbreaking I shouldn't ask this of you but listen when somebody has a need they have a need and us being on our last nerve doesn't mean that the need is going to go away the need is the need and the need has to be met and so he doesn't back away and say that's okay I'll go ask somebody else he says see now here comes a great lesson Elijah said bake me one first heartless old Prophet crotchety old man selfish take the bread out of a child's mouth we talk about stealing the candy out of a baby he was stealing candy from a baby he was stealing the last bit of food from a baby's mouth and a young Widow but he did it brother Brown says by vision knowing what would happen if she did it he says oh what is it there what lesson do we learn seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness bake me one first and she looks she said I wonder who that is there's something about that man that seems to be different and he said make me one first and bring it now listen to this it says and she started in to do what he said then it wasn't until she agreed to do it that she heard what she needed to hear then and only then she heard that comforting word that always comforts he said for thus saith the Lord the barrel will not be empty nor the crews run dry until the day that God sends rain on the Earth what was it he says that very dark crucial moment come but God's always on the scene if you're sure that it's God if you've repented of your sins if you've met God's requirement then be sure that God will keep his promise who he says if men and women could only realize that God is obligated to his promise and if you've met his requirements if you confessed your sins and you've made your rungs right and you've done everything God has required then hold on to God you've got to see daylight he's got to bring it through just be certain that it's God and he will take care of the rest of it if you're sure that it's God Church let's not miss the answer to our prayers because it's asking us to give everything we have in order to gain everything that we need let's not miss that sometimes we need to sacrifice that last little bit before God pours out the blessing that we're looking for it's the little things so often that he's asking for it's just the little things amen God's saying and what he told him what he was telling the children of Israel just do what I ask and Trust you don't always have to understand you don't always have to know you don't always have to see the end game The End Road you don't always have to see what I'm doing but you have to be instant in season so that when the holy spirit moves with it when God starts talking when God starts leading you can drop right into his will regardless of what he's asking you to do amen the answer is on the way and sometimes even though you feel you've given your all yet God says there's more to give but in the end of it you're going to be happy you did it back to the children of Israel in Exodus 16 says it came to pass it on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses so many obeyed and he said unto them this is that which the Lord said so he says here's why God told you to do it tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord Becky what you will bake today and seethe what you will see and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning now remember Moses tells him why they had to gather it but I want you to realize that these people were now experienced with manna by the time the sixth day rolled around they had seen what happened to men if you kept it overnight what happened it got wormy it rotted it stank so they've had six five days of do of experience with the supernatural and then God says yeah but gather twice as much and so people were there sitting and said I know better than God I've got experience with the things of God I'm not going to do it because it's just gonna stink and get rotted but God had told them to do it but they didn't do it because they thought they knew better than God now watch this it says and they laid it up till the morning as Moses bade and it did not stink neither was there any worm therein so somehow supernaturally God baked the Manna a little different on that Friday so that on Saturday morning it was still good to eat but everyone that thought they knew better was sitting there with nothing and they went hungry that first Sabbath it says and Moses said eat that today for today is the Sabbath unto the Lord today you shall not find it in the field six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day which is the Sabbath in it there shall be none verse 27 says and it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day four to gather and they found none God had told him to do it he didn't tell him why and then when it was too late he said here's why you're supposed to do it and this is going to carry you over through the Sabbath so you don't have to do any work you don't have to do any Gathering and I'll keep the food that I've given you and they went hungry because they refused to obey the word of God because they didn't understand it God doesn't tell us to understand you'll never find anywhere where he says you've got to understand it he says just believe it and Obey it that's it that's it the only requirement of the of the believer is to obey in faith amen and then God rolls he finishes it up he says and the Lord said unto Moses how long refuse ye to keep my Commandments and my laws God said if you can't do this how are we going to be friends how are we going to take over Canaan how are we going to push out the hivites and the parasites and the jebusites and all these different ones if you can't even obey me in terms of how to gather your food how are we going to make this work you're sitting here thinking we should be better off in in Egypt and we should have died back there and then when I give you a provision you won't even listen to me about how to use what I've given you what kind of faithless people are you I don't know if God gets disheartened because he doesn't have the emotions we do but I'm sure he wasn't happy this is not a happy statement how long refuse you to keep my Commandments and my laws it's only giving them two the Passover and this and circumcision that's it he says you can't even keep the little one sometimes what we're missing is we've got all the little things that are just not quite where they need to be and that's the only thing holding God back I'm a testimony that's literally in the last month the last month the little things if you do it then God will come in and he'll do the big things in your life listen to this brother Graham says if you will believe just be faithful with the little things God will show you great things believe him and God will do it amen let's Stand Together I mean I'm determined to not let the little things hold me back it's the little things it's it's amazing when you get into a relationship and those of you that are married know this is that you can't go through a marriage with big Grand demonstrations every month you do one good thing a month and then you ignore your spouse for the rest of the time you can't do that it's that day by day thing it's the little things that build into a great relationship it's that constant caring it's that constant love it's that constant consideration it's that constant sacrifice it's that constant molding and humbling that draws a couple together and it's no different than with the things of God that he calls us to do the little things and when he can trusts us with those little things now he says all right now we can build this into the bigger things now I can trust you nor now we can move into a higher sphere of responsibility now we can take you to a different Ministry now we can take you to a different role in the church now we can give you a spouse now we can let you go to university whatever the case may be but he's wanting to see those little things just the basics just the basics if we can take care of those amen we've been speaking on no turning back and that's maybe a bit of a weird topic but I want you to understand that when you don't take care of the little things and you say I'm better off doing the other things that's turning back when we refuse to obey the things that God's called us to do that's turning back and sometimes like I said it's because we don't understand and he hasn't told us to understand he's just told us to do it and the results will come and maybe later on you'll understand it that song says we'll understand it better by and by and I find that's the way it works is the further you go with God the more he reveals but he's not going to give you the whole story up front because otherwise why do you need faith because he's trying to build us up into a faith that'll take us off of this Earth amen we don't want to go back to the old way the old way of haphazard here a little there little in and out up and down and then we want to be consistent we want to be tight on the little things and trust that God will take us all the way through amen let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord we don't want anything to turn us back Lord I don't want to go back to Leading my own life Lord I don't want to go back to my own leadership I don't want to go back to my own thoughts or lower my isms my ideas my theologies but Lord I want to step out by faith into the power of the holy spirit in my own life Heavenly Father Lord and I believe each one that's gathered here tonight wants that but Lord we've got a flesh that doesn't Lord we've got a body that's lord it's it's doomed lord it's a body of death as Paul called it Lord and it fights us every day and Satan uses our mind and he tries to inject himself heavenly father to break us up over those little things Lord would you give us strength Lord would you grant us Grace day by day Lord to be concerned about the things that you care about Lord and we know you care about him because you told them to us and you gave them to us and you've called us to do them Heavenly Father Lord we don't want to be legalistic Lord we're not doing it because we're legalistic we're doing it because we love you and because we trust you Heavenly Father Lord help us to take care of those little things Lord to be faithful in those and trusting that if we do Lord you'll bring us into greater and bigger things in our lives Lord grant us Grace to Humble ourselves to your word Lord and minister to us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask him amen this is my desire to honor you 10 19.
