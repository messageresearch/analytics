[35:50] that your word will be made born in our
[35:52] lives Lord Lord not as white as
[35:55] sepulchers Lord as those priests and
[35:57] Lord that look good on the outside but
[35:59] the inside wasn't cleaned up below we
[36:02] want to be clean from the inside Lord
[36:03] working its way out Lord that it would
[36:05] subdue our spirit and flesh Lord Lord
[36:08] that your word would just have the full
[36:09] preeminent sword from the the head of
[36:11] the top of our head to the souls of our
[36:13] feet Lord in word thought indeed we pray
[36:16] Lord help us to surrender Anew this
[36:18] evening
[36:19] Lord and as you open your word to us or
[36:22] may just give us a vision Lord of what
[36:23] you have waiting for us Lord of what
[36:26] you've promised in this time and in this
[36:27] age Lord that what you've come to reveal
[36:30] to us Lord what will take us off this
[36:31] Earth in a Rapture Lord just draw our
[36:34] faith a little higher this evening Lord
[36:35] may we be able to step out into it Lord
[36:37] may it have an effect in our lives Lord
[36:39] not just good words or good thoughts or
[36:42] ideas Lord but may it change us Lord God
[36:44] we pray now Lord Just Have Your Way We
[36:47] ask in Jesus name we pray
[36:50] and God bless you
[36:52] turn the scriptures if you would to
[36:53] Genesis 1 and certainly want to welcome
[36:56] our our Senior League guitarist brother
[36:58] Paul Coffey back with us
[37:00] also sister Kimberly and brother Michael
[37:02] amen it's good to have them back good to
[37:04] have them back and well amen so
[37:08] amen glad to have them amen I've got to
[37:10] say I was expecting more people based on
[37:12] the volume of the singing so praise the
[37:15] Lord that the people are in it you know
[37:16] it does uh does a minister good to come
[37:18] out and everybody's worshiping and it
[37:20] makes a difference you know and and
[37:22] we've only got you know two-thirds of
[37:23] the church here and it sounds like the
[37:25] whole group's here so praise the Lord
[37:26] for that for putting your Heart and
[37:28] souls into it I know he sees it and then
[37:30] it certainly makes makes it a lot easier
[37:31] for me when I get up here as well and
[37:33] then just another quick update Brother
[37:35] David Nash Our missionary that we've
[37:37] been supporting is back in in the United
[37:39] States now but he sent me a few quick
[37:41] picture updates so these are the last
[37:43] few services that they had so as you can
[37:45] see here it's an awning next to a
[37:48] building is the church that's where they
[37:49] meet for their services then just a
[37:51] picture of some of the brothers there on
[37:53] the right side and then uh this is uh
[37:56] two sisters so I think a mother and a
[37:58] daughter that got baptized while they
[38:00] were there so that's six baptisms he's
[38:02] had over the 19 days that he was there
[38:04] so we praise the Lord for that and then
[38:06] he sent me a picture of what your shoes
[38:07] look like when you're doing missionary
[38:09] work so not only are they dirty all
[38:11] around but you have massive clumps of
[38:12] mud on them so it's a it's not a place
[38:15] for for nice clothes you see he
[38:17] typically is just wearing a golf shirt
[38:19] and some pants or just maybe a collared
[38:21] shirt at best and that's it because you
[38:23] just get filthy dirty sweaty you know
[38:26] stung and all these different things
[38:27] that you deal with there but he does it
[38:30] faithfully and he does it willfully and
[38:32] uh I just love to see that I mean six
[38:34] souls for for 18 days 19 days of work I
[38:37] just say praise the Lord from that and
[38:38] guess what that's not just because of
[38:40] him that's because we're there
[38:41] supporting him he couldn't have gone
[38:42] without us amen so it's not just Brother
[38:44] David Nash that's brought those souls to
[38:46] the lord it's this entire church says
[38:48] Faithfully pay their tithes and
[38:49] offerings that allows us to support
[38:51] someone like that to send them out and
[38:52] that's Our obligation amen if we've met
[38:54] our needs here then it's Our obligation
[38:56] to help somebody else that that needs
[38:58] that brother Bram says if he says I just
[39:00] keep the bare minimum he says and I send
[39:01] the rest out there so that the
[39:02] missionaries can go out there and get
[39:04] those lost souls and get the word out to
[39:06] the last one that needs to be in so we
[39:08] say praise the Lord from that Brother
[39:09] David Nash wanted me to thank the church
[39:11] specifically for our support on this
[39:13] trip of course couldn't have gone
[39:14] without us and it just meant the world
[39:16] to him to be able to accept that
[39:18] invitation he gets more invitations than
[39:19] he can accept just with his time and
[39:21] energy but he doesn't always have the
[39:23] money to do it and this time he didn't
[39:24] and we came through for him so thank you
[39:26] for that that's that's you as well as
[39:28] him that's uh that's been able to make
[39:30] this happen and we thank the Lord for
[39:31] blessing it above all those things Amen
[39:34] in Genesis verse chapter 1 verse 26
[39:39] it says and God said let us make man in
[39:42] our image after our likeness and let
[39:45] them have dominion over the fish of the
[39:47] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[39:49] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[39:50] and over every creeping thing that
[39:52] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[39:55] man in his own image in the image of God
[39:57] created he him male and female created
[40:01] he them amen God bless you can have your
[40:04] seats this evening we want to pick up
[40:06] where we left in in the last service and
[40:08] we're on our Redemption series now and I
[40:10] want to continue with this thought of in
[40:11] the beginning because we talked about
[40:13] the the law of redemption and then we we
[40:16] talked about and we'll dig into that
[40:18] deeper you know as we go because it
[40:20] doesn't mean so much to us when we start
[40:21] talking about land Redemption and those
[40:23] things we don't really deal with that
[40:25] anymore in in the Gentile side of things
[40:27] in in North America and whatnot but we
[40:30] talked about it in Redemption how that
[40:32] was so much tied to the land for the
[40:34] Jews and and it wasn't that that was the
[40:36] original Redemption plan but that's the
[40:38] part of our Redemption that they latched
[40:40] on to and you remember when they came
[40:42] and Jesus came and they said when are
[40:43] you going to restore the kingdom because
[40:45] it was all about what getting them out
[40:46] from under the thumbs of the Romans
[40:48] giving them their land back and letting
[40:49] them going back to worship god without
[40:51] people bothering them amen but they were
[40:53] able to worship all that time and
[40:55] nothing had changed amen so it wasn't
[40:57] the worship was the problem it was that
[40:59] they needed to be redeemed back to
[41:00] something that they didn't have they'd
[41:02] lost the vision they'd lost the purpose
[41:03] of even what the law was supposed to do
[41:05] and it was supposed to drive them to the
[41:07] thought of redemption it was supposed to
[41:09] drive them to the Messiah so that when
[41:11] he came they'd accept him because he was
[41:12] the Fulfillment of the law he didn't
[41:14] come Jesus come said I didn't come to to
[41:16] put the law away but I came to fulfill
[41:18] it to fulfill the requirement of it so
[41:20] that you could come back into a Grace
[41:21] Covenant and then they missed the
[41:23] thought of redemption and certainly as
[41:25] we look at this believers they they
[41:27] missed that Redemption is first and
[41:28] foremost to deliver you from yourself
[41:30] because if you got away from the land if
[41:32] you lost the land if you lost the
[41:34] blessing it was because you stepped away
[41:35] from God not that God stepped away from
[41:37] you it was because you did wrong it was
[41:39] because you messed up and so the
[41:41] Redemption was to get you back to a spot
[41:43] away from yourself it was to get you
[41:45] back to the good place amen so that you
[41:47] you catch the mind and the thought of
[41:49] God through his word and by obedience
[41:51] you'd stay there because guess what if
[41:53] you had the land redeemed back and
[41:55] nothing changed in you what was going to
[41:56] happen in a couple of years you're going
[41:58] to go right back to the way that you
[41:59] used to live before and then all of the
[42:01] people that had taken the land from you
[42:03] before would have a right to come take
[42:04] it again not only a right but God said
[42:07] he'd use them to take your land away
[42:08] from you so if nothing changed on the
[42:10] inside if nothing changed on your in
[42:12] your life and the way you believed in
[42:13] the way you lived then what was going to
[42:15] happen was the land to be redeemed you
[42:16] and then somebody was going to go take
[42:17] it again because you couldn't and
[42:19] wouldn't line up with the word of God
[42:20] you wouldn't be in obedience to the word
[42:22] of God and so the enemy has a right to
[42:24] take it and that's where you sit today
[42:26] is if you won't line up with the word
[42:27] then the enemy has the right to take
[42:28] away what you have right we see that the
[42:31] prophet teaches that very clearly amen
[42:33] but I want to say that Israel's true
[42:35] Redemption was supposed to be open
[42:36] fellowship with God and we know that
[42:38] because as soon as Christ died then he
[42:40] tore the veil right he tore the veil
[42:42] that was a partition and you could only
[42:43] be a high priest and you had to go in
[42:45] with blood and all these different
[42:46] things he broke the veil he tore the
[42:48] veil so that there could be a
[42:50] restoration back to that amen and so the
[42:52] gospel was first given to the Jews he
[42:54] came to his own and his own received him
[42:56] not the scripture says and it was
[42:58] supposed to be a return to the Grace
[42:59] Covenant that's what he was doing he was
[43:01] supposed to be bringing back to the
[43:02] abrahamic Covenant because Abraham
[43:04] walked in in a covenant with God where
[43:06] there was no law there was no law what
[43:08] he had was a sign of obedience which was
[43:10] circumcision but Abraham wasn't living
[43:12] under a law he didn't have to to to
[43:14] sacrifice animals every you know for the
[43:17] different feasts and he didn't have to
[43:18] go here and he didn't have to turn his
[43:20] face to this place to worship God he
[43:21] didn't have to do anything like that
[43:23] Abraham just had the sign of
[43:25] circumcision and then he was in in God's
[43:27] favor
[43:28] that's the only thing that he had to do
[43:29] and the thing is it wasn't a law that
[43:32] you had to be circumcised it was a sign
[43:33] that you want to be in the Covenant it
[43:35] was a sign of your acceptance of what
[43:37] God had required you to do and if you
[43:39] didn't have the circumcision you didn't
[43:40] die right all it was was you didn't get
[43:43] the blessing but he didn't kill you if
[43:45] you didn't do it amen whereas the law if
[43:47] you didn't do it then you died under the
[43:49] under the the witness of two or three
[43:50] people right so Abraham was walking
[43:53] under grace not under the law and if we
[43:55] look back in Genesis 15 it says after
[43:57] these things the word of the Lord came
[43:59] to Abraham and of Abram in a vision
[44:01] saying fear not Abram I am thy shield
[44:04] and thy exceeding great reward this is
[44:06] the Grace Covenant it's not Abraham if
[44:08] you do this then I'll do this
[44:09] it's Abraham I am your I am your your
[44:12] exceeding great reward I'm the one
[44:15] that's going to be the blessing to you
[44:16] Abraham
[44:17] he says in Abram said Lord God What wilt
[44:19] thou give me see and I go childless and
[44:22] the steward of my house is this Eliezer
[44:23] of Damascus Abram said behold to me thou
[44:27] has given no seed and lo one born in my
[44:29] house is mine Heir he says you're
[44:31] telling me that's great Lord but you
[44:33] promised me a son and I don't I still
[44:35] don't have a son
[44:37] it says and behold the word of the Lord
[44:39] came to him saying this shall not be
[44:41] thine Heir but he that shall come forth
[44:43] out of thine own bowel shall be thine
[44:44] ear
[44:45] and he brought him forth abroad and said
[44:47] look now toward heaven and tell the
[44:49] Stars if thou be able to number them and
[44:51] he said unto him so shall thy seed be
[44:53] and he believed in the Lord and he
[44:56] counted it to him for righteousness
[44:58] because you're seeking righteousness
[45:00] righteousness means to do the will of
[45:01] God to be in favor with God because
[45:03] you're in obedience to his plan his
[45:05] purpose and God's saying to Abraham he's
[45:07] saying don't worry about the promise he
[45:09] says just look to me and as long as
[45:11] you're looking to me then everything
[45:12] else will be okay all fulfill the
[45:14] promise but you've got to focus on me
[45:15] first I'm the one that's the of the
[45:18] greatest interest I'm the great benefit
[45:19] that you're looking for Abraham and as
[45:21] long as you keep that in your mind then
[45:23] you're going to turn out all right now
[45:25] Eva God follows right up behind this
[45:27] this conversation with Abraham a short
[45:29] while later and this is this is an
[45:31] amazing thing he says and this is one
[45:33] year before the promise is about to be
[45:35] fulfilled so three months before
[45:37] Abraham's about to get a body change
[45:38] Sarah's about to get a body change and
[45:41] Isaac's uh you know they're gonna
[45:42] they're gonna get pregnant for Isaac
[45:43] right so this is just before the promise
[45:46] is supposed to be fulfilled so I want
[45:47] you to put yourself here because we've
[45:49] got a promise that's waiting for us
[45:51] don't we we've got a promise of full
[45:52] Redemption amen we have a seal that's
[45:55] going to poke Focus us all the way to
[45:56] that but we've got a promise of a full
[45:58] Redemption of a body change and we go to
[46:00] him to and we meet him in the air and we
[46:02] go to uh uh you know the the bride the
[46:05] the supper the the the the wedding
[46:07] suffering these different things so
[46:09] Genesis 17 says him when Abram was 90
[46:11] years old and nine so he's 99 years old
[46:14] for those who are struggling with the
[46:15] math he's going to have Isaac at 100
[46:17] years
[46:18] but he's going to follow him at 99 and a
[46:20] quarter
[46:21] so three months before that the Lord
[46:23] appeared to Abraham and said unto him I
[46:25] am the almighty God Walk me for me and
[46:29] be thou perfect
[46:30] now we think perfect means what flawless
[46:34] sinless
[46:35] but that word perfect means complete
[46:39] whole sound entire
[46:43] healthful
[46:44] entirely in accordance with the truth
[46:49] so this is way different than sinless
[46:51] Perfection what is truth truth is the
[46:54] word for your day for you
[46:57] amen
[46:58] it's got to be for you so what was
[47:00] Abraham's Truth for his day you're gonna
[47:03] have a son
[47:04] and God's coming to Abraham and he's
[47:06] saying Abraham
[47:08] produce a son
[47:11] Abraham's 99 years old up his seat is
[47:13] dried he hasn't had relationship with
[47:15] his wife for for decades
[47:18] and God's coming to him and he's saying
[47:19] Abraham fulfilled the word now
[47:23] and Abraham's probably saying Lord I
[47:25] tried and I tried and I tried and
[47:27] nothing happened we weren't successful
[47:29] and now I can't even do it
[47:31] I can't do anything to produce the word
[47:34] Lord
[47:36] but it's what three months away from the
[47:38] promise starting its path to being fully
[47:41] fulfilled in his life and God's saying
[47:43] walk in my word walk in the truth I've
[47:45] given to you
[47:47] and Abraham's saying they're saying how
[47:48] I've been trying to do it for 24 years
[47:51] and three months and nothing's happened
[47:53] I've been doing exactly what you told me
[47:55] to do faithfully and nothing has
[47:58] happened Lord
[47:59] and God's saying walk in my word produce
[48:02] the results Abraham
[48:06] what do we do
[48:08] what can we do we're in Abraham's same
[48:10] position
[48:11] I can't produce a body change in and of
[48:13] myself amen
[48:14] so what does it look like to walk in
[48:16] truth to to be perfect
[48:20] James writes about and he points back to
[48:22] the scripture we just read he said the
[48:23] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[48:25] Abraham believed God
[48:28] he believed God and it was imputed to
[48:30] him for righteousness in other words his
[48:33] belief was as if he had done it himself
[48:35] right and because of that he was called
[48:38] the friend of God Amen so Abraham did
[48:41] not produce the word but God says
[48:44] Abraham because you have believed and
[48:46] you do believe it is as if you produced
[48:49] it on your own
[48:51] and he says that's why he's called the
[48:53] friend of God is because he believed in
[48:55] amen and Abraham didn't live perfectly
[48:57] he made mistakes he got out of the will
[49:00] of God he got out of the land of Canaan
[49:02] where he was supposed to be he got in
[49:03] with the Philistines he lied about his
[49:05] wife he did all of these things amen he
[49:08] might have been swayed from time to time
[49:09] but when the scripture looks back at
[49:11] through the filter of redemption it says
[49:14] that he believed because he always came
[49:16] back to that point Lord I believe you're
[49:18] going to do it
[49:20] especially especially at 99 years when
[49:24] he obviously could not fulfill the word
[49:27] yet his faith never wavered amen what
[49:30] does it say what is it God in the
[49:32] scripture says I see the faith and not
[49:34] the mistakes
[49:35] and because I see the faith and I see
[49:38] the heart that's there even though maybe
[49:40] he moves from left to right yet the
[49:43] heart is faithful to the word and that's
[49:44] what I'm judging here today is I'm
[49:46] judging that his heart believes that the
[49:48] word of God is true and I'm going to do
[49:50] what I said I was going to do
[49:52] that word impute means to account to add
[49:55] to to give credit for to reckon to to
[49:58] add to one's account to make a judgment
[50:00] in your favor I want him to judge in my
[50:03] favor amen and how is it it is when we
[50:05] believe and he imputes in the face of
[50:08] all the Earth and every tree in the
[50:10] witch is the fruit of a tree yielding
[50:12] seed to you it shall be for meat and to
[50:14] every beast of the earth to every fowl
[50:16] of the earth to everything that creepeth
[50:18] upon the Earth wherein there is life
[50:20] I've given every green herb for meat and
[50:22] it was so they're vegetarian praise the
[50:24] Lord we've moved on and God saw
[50:27] everything that he had made and behold
[50:28] it was very good and the evening in the
[50:31] morning were the sixth day so God rests
[50:33] here
[50:34] right as soon as the sixth day is over
[50:36] he goes into rest
[50:38] so this is perfection
[50:40] this is the original creation this is
[50:42] your point of perfection
[50:45] but yet we're not manifested the way we
[50:47] are today
[50:48] so while this is perfection this is not
[50:50] a return point this is not what we're
[50:52] looking for yet amen but here you have
[50:54] man in such a form that he can't be
[50:56] tarnished he can't be influenced he
[50:58] can't be drawn away from anything he is
[51:00] perfect right here but then we jump into
[51:01] Genesis 2 and God says in every plant of
[51:04] the earth before it was in the earth and
[51:06] every herb or the field before it grew
[51:07] for the Lord God had not caused it to
[51:09] rain upon the Earth and there was not a
[51:11] man to tell the ground and there went up
[51:13] a mist from the earth and watered the
[51:15] whole face of the ground we spoke of
[51:16] this before how that God knowing that
[51:18] there was going to be a man coming to
[51:19] tell the ground prepare the ground to
[51:21] start to grow in time for him to come on
[51:23] the scene right God always prepares a
[51:25] crop for the man to come on the scene
[51:27] amen when we have a Prophet come in it's
[51:29] what he we had an Azusa Street Revival
[51:31] go before him to prepare a crop remember
[51:34] the rain falls on the just and the
[51:35] unjust it's getting them ready for what
[51:37] the final season the final growth I'm in
[51:40] the ripening in the presence of the Sun
[51:41] and these things he always sends the
[51:43] rain before what the message comes to
[51:45] bring it what to its full fruit
[51:48] he says in the Lord God formed man of
[51:50] the Dust of the ground and breathed into
[51:52] his nostrils the breath of life and Man
[51:53] became a living Soul so man is still
[51:56] perfect here because he's still male and
[51:58] female inside he's still the image of
[52:00] God he's the image of God now manifested
[52:03] in flesh and we know this is perfect
[52:05] because this is the same way Christ came
[52:08] this is the same way Christ came because
[52:10] remember Christ come down he has us
[52:11] inside because he has to take something
[52:13] out of his side on the cross we're with
[52:15] him there brother Graham says when he
[52:16] died on the cross you died with them
[52:17] right you are a part of him so this is
[52:20] this is still Perfection here right he's
[52:23] a pure reflection of God in flesh now
[52:27] and the Lord God planted a garden
[52:28] Eastward in Eden and there he put the
[52:30] man whom he had formed so God makes man
[52:32] puts him in a body and then gives him a
[52:34] work to do he's still in perfection
[52:37] verse 9 says and out of the ground made
[52:39] the Lord God to grow every tree that is
[52:41] Pleasant to the sight and good for food
[52:42] and the tree of life also in the midst
[52:44] of the garden and the tree of knowledge
[52:46] of Good and Evil jumping down to verse
[52:48] 15 says the Lord God took the man put
[52:50] him into the Garden of Eden address it
[52:52] and keep it and the Lord God commanded
[52:54] the scene the man saying of every tree
[52:56] of the garden thou mayest freely eat but
[52:58] of the tree of knowledge of good and
[53:00] evil evil thou shall not eat of it for
[53:03] in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou
[53:04] shalt surely die
[53:06] it says and Adam gave names to all the
[53:08] cattle and the fowl the air to every
[53:10] beast of the field but for Adam there
[53:12] was not found unhelp meat for him a
[53:14] suitable help for him and the Lord God
[53:16] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[53:18] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[53:21] and closed up the flesh thereof
[53:24] now I want to stop here because the
[53:25] scripture points it out that Adam in his
[53:28] original condition is exposed to the
[53:30] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[53:33] now I want you to think about that
[53:34] because we're in a mixed crowd and we
[53:37] know that the tree of knowledge of Good
[53:38] and Evil is of euphemism for something
[53:39] else and we are not going to go into it
[53:41] but the prophet of God said if eating
[53:43] apples cause women to realize they're
[53:45] naked then we better cause they pass the
[53:47] apples again so this was not a literal
[53:49] fruit tree okay and we know this again
[53:51] the adults will know this so if there
[53:53] was a Mr serpent
[53:55] there was a Mrs serpent can I put it
[53:57] that way amen so we know that the the
[54:00] male serpent seduced Eve which meant
[54:02] that there was potential for the female
[54:03] serpent to seduce Adam and yet we know
[54:06] Adam was exposed to the tree of life and
[54:08] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[54:09] rather and he never touched it there was
[54:12] nothing there that tempted him there was
[54:13] nothing there that Drew it because Adam
[54:15] was ordered not to mess around with it
[54:17] he was in constant communion with his
[54:19] creator he had the perfect
[54:21] attributes inside of him he had male and
[54:23] female inside of him he had no need of
[54:25] anything from the outside everything he
[54:27] needed was in him right there so he
[54:29] wasn't drawn away by it there was
[54:31] nothing that tempted Adam in any way and
[54:33] he also knew that it was under his
[54:34] Dominion right that you don't go have
[54:37] conversations with a parent because it's
[54:39] underneath you and I believe Adam
[54:40] probably never had a conversation with
[54:42] the serpents because they had nothing
[54:43] they could give to him it was him to
[54:45] them not them to him amen he knew that
[54:47] he was above it so you have Adam with
[54:48] both the male and female attributes
[54:50] under one mind under one intelligence in
[54:53] one body cannot be tempted or swayed he
[54:55] stays perfect to the word of God
[54:58] it says and the rib which the Lord God
[55:00] had taken for man made he a woman and
[55:02] brought her under the man and Adam said
[55:04] this is now bone of my bones and Flesh
[55:07] of My Flesh so he says what she's me
[55:09] she's come out of me she's a part of me
[55:10] so she is me
[55:13] he says she shall be called woman for
[55:15] she was taken out of men therefore shall
[55:17] a man leave his mother and his father
[55:19] and shall cleave unto his wife and they
[55:22] shall be one flesh now I want you to
[55:24] catch the son now that's two people two
[55:27] entities two different bodies but he
[55:30] says they shall be singular one flesh
[55:33] what is it that's husband and wife
[55:35] that's man and woman it's Christ and the
[55:37] bride and he says the two are one and
[55:40] the key to them being one is what
[55:42] cleaving it's cleaving that makes them
[55:45] one because they're obviously two we can
[55:47] count one plus one equals two
[55:50] but he says there'll be one flesh but
[55:53] they have to cleave in order to be one
[55:54] flesh here so we have this beautiful
[55:56] scene in in in Eden and this is our
[55:59] state of perfection right here we have
[56:01] two bodies United under the word doing
[56:05] what God has purpose for them fulfilling
[56:07] the word of God and they're perfect they
[56:09] have all the attributes of God inside of
[56:11] them and they're under his will so
[56:14] everything's perfect everything's great
[56:16] everything's hunky-dory and so we can
[56:18] see ourselves here when we look at
[56:19] Redemption this is what we're looking to
[56:20] be restored back to
[56:22] brother Brian puts it this way he says
[56:23] now in the beginning when God made the
[56:25] man to worship Him and live God taking
[56:27] care of him and fed him man had a
[56:30] perfect fellowship with God there was
[56:32] nothing wrong
[56:33] that's what Redemption looks like
[56:34] nothing wrong
[56:36] God came down in the evening and talked
[56:37] to Adam and Eve what a beautiful picture
[56:39] no harm nothing could harm them no
[56:42] sickness could ever come to them they
[56:44] didn't even know what sickness was they
[56:47] didn't know what old age was they didn't
[56:48] know what being hurt was they couldn't
[56:50] be hurt they was in the presence of the
[56:53] omnipotent powers of God which held them
[56:56] in control and guided them by his spirit
[56:59] and there was nothing could harm them
[57:00] catch that thought they're in the
[57:03] presence of the omnipotent powers of God
[57:05] which held them in control and guided
[57:08] them by his Spirit That's why nothing
[57:10] could harm them they were what in
[57:12] perfect relationship imperfect Unity
[57:14] perfect purpose and perfect alignment
[57:17] with the word of God
[57:18] so he says nothing can harm them there
[57:19] as long as they're led by the spirit as
[57:21] long as they're in communion with God
[57:23] they're okay
[57:25] he says now man was born to have
[57:27] Fellowship
[57:28] born for it man in the beginning back in
[57:31] the Garden of Eden he had wonderful
[57:33] Fellowship God come down and fellowship
[57:35] with his company of men and women every
[57:37] evening I want you to catch that every
[57:39] evening in the cool of the evening God
[57:42] will come down under the great palm
[57:43] trees perhaps as sacred light as it was
[57:45] shining down on Adam and Eve in that
[57:47] great cathedral in the open fellowship
[57:50] with God had nothing to worry about as
[57:53] long as they were fellowshipping catch
[57:55] that now because we're looking at what
[57:57] getting back to a place where we don't
[57:59] have to worry about anything and he says
[58:01] where do you get that place when you're
[58:03] fellowshipping with him
[58:06] not with a minister not with a sermon
[58:08] amen not with just Believers of like
[58:11] Precious Faith but with him amen that
[58:13] you've got fellowship with him that's
[58:15] what's keeping you that's what leaves
[58:17] you with nothing to worry about he says
[58:19] I love fellowship with men I like to go
[58:20] out and talk with people who love the
[58:22] Lord and have fellowship with them
[58:23] because we see the same thing our
[58:25] motives are the same our ideals are the
[58:26] same I've Got a Friend sitting right
[58:28] down here that likes to hunt and fish
[58:30] many times we have a lot of Fellowship
[58:32] together just sitting around talking on
[58:34] those things because we like those
[58:35] things but the greatest Fellowship that
[58:38] any man ever had was when he had
[58:40] fellowship with God when God gave
[58:42] himself open to man to Fellowship back
[58:45] and forth with his creature the Creator
[58:47] and his creature
[58:50] now when God was fellowshipping with
[58:52] Adam in the Garden of Eden Adam had
[58:54] nothing to worry about everything was on
[58:56] the smooth and running right
[58:59] how many would like to say my life is on
[59:01] the smooth and running right
[59:04] two
[59:05] on the smooth and Ronnie right he didn't
[59:08] have to worry about his clothes he
[59:09] didn't have to worry about something to
[59:11] eat didn't have to worry about sickness
[59:13] he didn't have to worry about death or
[59:15] sorrow he knew nothing about them just
[59:17] the freedom like a child he had a
[59:20] heavenly father who watched over him and
[59:22] fellowship with him daily he says
[59:24] wouldn't it be marvelous if we could be
[59:26] back like that again
[59:28] he says do you know every redeemed soul
[59:31] today that's living under their
[59:33] privileges of that kind of fellowship
[59:35] with God you believe that God will take
[59:38] care and provide everything that we have
[59:41] need of in this journey and at the end
[59:44] of the close of this old mortar
[59:46] Tabernacle God's promise to give us
[59:49] another one amen
[59:50] so you see here we talked about this
[59:52] idea of cleaving and God's checking in
[59:55] with his family every single day he
[59:57] never lets an evening go and brother
[59:58] Branham keeps pointing back to it's in
[59:59] the evening time it's in the evening
[1:00:01] time and he point to Zachariah and it'll
[1:00:04] be a time when it's neither dark nor
[1:00:05] light and but there's going to be light
[1:00:07] at the evening time he talks about
[1:00:08] Rebecca coming to Isaac in the evening
[1:00:11] time he says there's significance with
[1:00:13] God's presence in the evening time and
[1:00:15] he's pointing to what the evening time
[1:00:17] right our great evening time when it's
[1:00:19] the end of the day amen and he comes
[1:00:21] down one last time to carry us away
[1:00:24] amen but I want us to look at the man
[1:00:26] and the woman here because we have the
[1:00:28] still potentially the perfect reflection
[1:00:30] of God because we have the attributes
[1:00:32] now in two bodies amen but now you have
[1:00:35] two parts of a single personality in two
[1:00:38] bodies
[1:00:39] so what was originally unbreakable now
[1:00:41] is potentially breakable
[1:00:44] because in the beginning they're in one
[1:00:45] body under one mind and they both have
[1:00:48] both the both sides of the male and
[1:00:50] female are there so they're in Perfect
[1:00:52] Balance if we could put it that way so
[1:00:55] guess what I don't know if you guys know
[1:00:57] it but men think differently than women
[1:00:59] they act differently than women
[1:01:01] and so what happens is what when you're
[1:01:03] separated then you have a leaning
[1:01:05] towards your attributes which makes
[1:01:07] sense doesn't it but together in one
[1:01:10] body they're perfectly balanced but you
[1:01:11] separate them out and now you have the
[1:01:13] potential for there to be problems but
[1:01:16] as long as they stay together they
[1:01:18] balance each other out and they guard
[1:01:20] each other and they protect each other
[1:01:22] So Adam and Eve were or Adam as man and
[1:01:26] woman they could be complete they could
[1:01:28] be perfect
[1:01:30] remember what it meant to be perfect
[1:01:31] complete whole in fullness and healthful
[1:01:34] what if they stay together so the key to
[1:01:37] them succeeding the key to their Victory
[1:01:39] the key to staying in the presence of
[1:01:41] God is that they stay close together
[1:01:43] because they balance each other out
[1:01:45] and we see her in the scripture that
[1:01:47] that God put a guard over this weakness
[1:01:49] and somebody asked me I mean it's a bit
[1:01:52] like closing the Barn Door after the
[1:01:53] horse has gone out I guess but somebody
[1:01:55] asked me this a while ago and I didn't
[1:01:56] have an answer they said where was Adam
[1:01:58] when Eve got seduced by the serpent
[1:02:00] how did it get to the point where she
[1:02:02] could be influenced so completely that
[1:02:04] she turned against the word where was
[1:02:06] her husband in all of this I thought it
[1:02:08] was a great question I didn't have an
[1:02:10] answer for it amen no I haven't no doubt
[1:02:12] of one thing Adam was still doing the
[1:02:14] will of God
[1:02:15] Adam was still doing the will of God and
[1:02:16] that he was taking Dominion he was
[1:02:19] naming things he was he was uh helping
[1:02:21] the garden to stay you know in good good
[1:02:23] health and tending it in these different
[1:02:25] things he was doing what he had been
[1:02:26] commanded to do amen we know that
[1:02:28] because Adam didn't fall the way that he
[1:02:30] felt he wasn't seduced into it he wasn't
[1:02:32] tricked into it but he did it willfully
[1:02:34] amen but we see in verse 24 the
[1:02:37] Scripture it says therefore shall a man
[1:02:40] well give it to me therefore shall a man
[1:02:43] leave his father and his mother and
[1:02:45] shall cleave unto his wife and there'll
[1:02:47] be one flesh so it's giving us this as a
[1:02:49] lesson because Adam didn't have a mother
[1:02:51] and he had a father but not the way we
[1:02:52] traditionally do so this is literally
[1:02:54] God looking back and giving us a lesson
[1:02:58] in this story and to me it gives us
[1:03:00] insight into what happened because he
[1:03:01] says the man is supposed to cleave to
[1:03:04] his wife and they'll be one flesh now
[1:03:07] that word cleave means to cling to stay
[1:03:10] close
[1:03:11] that's you controlling you
[1:03:14] and then he says keep close that's me
[1:03:16] controlling her
[1:03:17] so if she's wandering around stakeholds
[1:03:19] means I'm going to stay close but keep
[1:03:21] close means if she tries to go away you
[1:03:23] grab her and you say no you stay close
[1:03:24] to me
[1:03:26] stick to stick with
[1:03:29] follow closely join two overtake and
[1:03:33] catch so in other words if she tries to
[1:03:35] get away you don't let her get away you
[1:03:37] stay close beside her all the time
[1:03:40] so if there's one thing I can tell you
[1:03:41] it's that Adam wasn't present when the
[1:03:43] serpent seduced Eve
[1:03:45] so what does that tell you that Adam
[1:03:46] wasn't cleaving to his wife the way the
[1:03:49] scripture looking back says that he
[1:03:50] should have
[1:03:51] now I'm not here to lay blame on Adam
[1:03:53] Adam Didn't Know Better perhaps maybe he
[1:03:55] was just checking in Once a Night the
[1:03:57] same way that she that Christ was doing
[1:03:58] with them but the point is that to to
[1:04:00] stay in perfect Unity they had to stay
[1:04:03] together
[1:04:04] and so what happened when they separated
[1:04:06] into two bodies was that was that Adam
[1:04:09] keeps the mind
[1:04:11] but she gets a different mind with her
[1:04:14] body potentially
[1:04:15] right he's the son of God he keeps the
[1:04:18] original mind but he takes her out and
[1:04:19] he builds her from that body he puts
[1:04:21] that separate attribute into her and now
[1:04:23] she can be tempted now she can be moved
[1:04:25] off of that without intending to because
[1:04:27] she's got a mind of her own if we can
[1:04:29] put it that way amen the cleaning is
[1:04:31] what keeps you as one you're in separate
[1:04:33] physical body so that sticking close is
[1:04:35] your reinforcement it's your guard to
[1:04:37] what's going to happen and otherwise
[1:04:39] amen because if you don't cleave
[1:04:41] together somebody can get in there and
[1:04:43] guess what somebody did
[1:04:44] right and it was the serpent got in
[1:04:46] there so let me say this to men and
[1:04:48] women alike amen I was talking to
[1:04:50] someone the other day about you know
[1:04:51] things we deal with in our flesh and I
[1:04:53] was talking about my marriage and I said
[1:04:54] I'm a married man and guess what there
[1:04:57] are going to be times where I run across
[1:04:58] a woman that is going to be attractive
[1:05:00] alluring or will have a draw on me in
[1:05:03] some way in my flesh
[1:05:05] because I'm a man I'm a red-blooded man
[1:05:08] amen I have hormones and all these
[1:05:09] different things that are that are stuck
[1:05:11] in there amen so I'm gonna see women
[1:05:13] that potentially attract me
[1:05:15] but guess what I'm married
[1:05:17] and so my desire is to be to my wife
[1:05:20] but guess what I have to actively choose
[1:05:23] how to respond to that woman when she
[1:05:25] walks in front of me or when I see her
[1:05:27] so the question is will I cleave to my
[1:05:30] wife
[1:05:30] or will I cleave to this woman
[1:05:33] because I've got to actively decide who
[1:05:36] I'm cleaving to that day and there came
[1:05:38] a point where Eve didn't actively cleave
[1:05:40] to her husband and that's what got her
[1:05:42] into problems amen amen I've chosen my
[1:05:45] wife and she's accepted my choosing and
[1:05:47] that means that there's only one woman
[1:05:49] in my life that's supposed to fulfill
[1:05:50] the needs that I have and that's her and
[1:05:52] so I'm supposed to cleave to her but the
[1:05:55] interesting thing about the word cleave
[1:05:56] is that it's the only word in the
[1:05:58] English language that has two meanings
[1:06:00] that are exactly opposite
[1:06:03] I want you to catch this because it's
[1:06:05] it's two sides of the same coin because
[1:06:07] cleave also means to sever or split so
[1:06:11] that means if I am cleaving then I'm
[1:06:13] choosing what I'm clinging to and I'm
[1:06:15] choosing what I'm splitting away from
[1:06:17] and if I'm cleaving to something then by
[1:06:20] definition I must be splitting away from
[1:06:22] something else amen I cannot join two
[1:06:25] something unless I'm leaving something
[1:06:26] behind so the question I have for you
[1:06:28] tonight is what are you cleaving too and
[1:06:31] what are you cleaving from because the
[1:06:33] cleaving too is scriptural a cleaving
[1:06:35] away from is what we want to get you
[1:06:37] know that's the things that we're
[1:06:38] keeping away of Our Lives amen and so
[1:06:40] often the problem is we're cleaving to
[1:06:41] something that's not the word of God and
[1:06:43] we're wondering why we're having trouble
[1:06:44] in our relationship and our finances and
[1:06:46] our walk with Christ it's because we're
[1:06:48] not cleaving to the word we're not
[1:06:49] cleaving to the thing that is supposed
[1:06:51] to be our spiritual husband amen
[1:06:54] so if you're cleaving two you're
[1:06:56] automatically cleaving away You're
[1:06:57] fulfilling everything of cleaving in the
[1:07:00] one action make sure you're cleaving to
[1:07:02] the right thing amen if I'm cleaving to
[1:07:04] my wife then I'm cleaving every other
[1:07:06] woman in the world away from me so if
[1:07:08] you're cleaving to Christ is your
[1:07:09] spiritual husband then every other
[1:07:11] husband is going to be what cleaved Away
[1:07:13] by definition if you're doing the
[1:07:15] cleaving the way the scripture tells you
[1:07:17] to amen why do we see problems in
[1:07:19] marriage because somebody stops cleaving
[1:07:21] two and they start cleaving away
[1:07:24] right
[1:07:26] and you notice here the scripture does
[1:07:27] not tell the woman to cleave to her
[1:07:29] husband
[1:07:31] now I'm not saying women don't cleave to
[1:07:32] your husband because the scripture says
[1:07:34] and we'll read it in another service it
[1:07:36] talks about cleaving to the Lord
[1:07:37] cleaving to your husband you cleave dear
[1:07:39] husband sisters but it puts the onus it
[1:07:41] puts the responsibility of cleaving on
[1:07:43] the man and he says you leave everything
[1:07:45] behind and you focus on that woman you
[1:07:48] focus on that way that is your
[1:07:49] responsibility and if she gets away it's
[1:07:52] because you didn't cleave close enough
[1:07:53] to her
[1:07:55] so the thing is if she wants to leave
[1:07:56] what do you do cleave all the more if
[1:07:58] she's unhappy what do you do cleave all
[1:08:00] the more because you can only protect
[1:08:02] her if you're cleaving to her if you're
[1:08:04] staying closer in these things amen amen
[1:08:06] that's why the prophet of God calls the
[1:08:08] woman a pro a byproduct it's not that
[1:08:11] the woman as an attribute was a
[1:08:13] byproduct that's not what he's saying
[1:08:15] but he's saying the body she was placed
[1:08:17] in was a byproduct and that's what
[1:08:19] allowed Satan to get in that was the
[1:08:21] in the armor of perfection was
[1:08:23] when he placed her in another body and
[1:08:25] she didn't stay with her husband or her
[1:08:27] husband didn't stay with her if we want
[1:08:29] to put the responsibility on him
[1:08:31] because she was in a byproduct state in
[1:08:34] that separate body That's what Satan
[1:08:36] could get into and he says it here he
[1:08:37] says the man didn't have a wife the wife
[1:08:40] and the man was the same thing
[1:08:43] so this is the perfect State he says he
[1:08:45] had the feminist and the masculine
[1:08:47] spirit in himself
[1:08:48] then he says he to Satan he had to
[1:08:52] separate and take a byproduct after the
[1:08:55] whole creation was made no female
[1:08:57] created by God in the original creation
[1:08:59] can do a thing like that she was made
[1:09:01] thus to do it he knows she would do it
[1:09:03] if he didn't he wasn't God so what's he
[1:09:05] saying he's saying you cannot fall when
[1:09:07] you're in one body
[1:09:09] and and it proves it in the scripture
[1:09:11] Adam never fell as long as he was in one
[1:09:13] body
[1:09:14] but as soon as they stepped into two
[1:09:16] that's when the potential problem
[1:09:17] happened and that's when the problem did
[1:09:18] happen amen so the woman's put into a
[1:09:21] separate body and she falls because her
[1:09:23] body is a byproduct of the net of the
[1:09:25] original creation not her attributes
[1:09:28] the sisters are a perfect expression of
[1:09:30] God that's been split away
[1:09:32] we're an expression perfect expression
[1:09:34] of God as men that's been split away
[1:09:36] from the other half two of us together
[1:09:37] are perfect separate we're nothing
[1:09:40] right so the idea is to get us back
[1:09:42] together amen that's why the woman's
[1:09:44] looking for headship if she's Godly it's
[1:09:46] because she's looking to get back into
[1:09:47] that state where she joins to that one
[1:09:49] that guards and protects Us by cleaving
[1:09:51] to her amen so what did it do as soon as
[1:09:53] she got into a separate body and she has
[1:09:55] her own mind what can she do she can
[1:09:57] choose to leave she can choose who she
[1:09:59] listens to she can choose who she
[1:10:01] fellowships with she can choose who she
[1:10:03] has as theological discussions with
[1:10:04] including the serpent and brother Bob
[1:10:07] says that's what he did was he took
[1:10:08] advantage of that byproduct State and in
[1:10:11] that he caused her to fall and she gets
[1:10:13] to the point where she believes that
[1:10:14] evil was good
[1:10:16] she got into a theological discussion
[1:10:18] that got too deep for her and he twisted
[1:10:20] her and he turned around 180 degrees so
[1:10:22] that good was bad and bad was good amen
[1:10:25] so what's our point of redemption we're
[1:10:27] talking of Christ and the Bride of
[1:10:28] course and all these things amen is it
[1:10:30] two separate bodies with independent
[1:10:32] Minds
[1:10:33] can't be because that's that that's a
[1:10:35] that's a a failed model
[1:10:37] right it's already been tried it doesn't
[1:10:39] work you can't have two bodies and two
[1:10:41] minds but remember he says that he was
[1:10:44] supposed to cleave and in doing so you
[1:10:46] would be one flesh he says if you'll
[1:10:48] cleave you'll be one flesh you'll be one
[1:10:50] body you'll be as one
[1:10:52] so that's the key to all of this amen we
[1:10:55] know that Adam yielded to sin and even
[1:10:57] though he did it out of love for for his
[1:10:59] wife for for the woman he was still
[1:11:01] wrong in it but Christ isn't going to do
[1:11:04] that Christ isn't going to do wrong to
[1:11:06] try and make things right he's not going
[1:11:07] to do wrong to get us back he's got to
[1:11:09] fulfill the payment and the price that
[1:11:11] that has to be paid for this amen
[1:11:13] so getting us back in the perfect
[1:11:15] Fellowship is going to look like what us
[1:11:17] cleaving to Christ and Christ above all
[1:11:20] clinging to us amen we can cleave to him
[1:11:23] all we want but if he doesn't cleave
[1:11:25] back to us then nothing's going to
[1:11:26] happen is it right you think of these
[1:11:28] movie stars or or great athletes and
[1:11:30] stuff and they they have what they call
[1:11:31] groupies and they follow them around
[1:11:33] from game to game concert to concert and
[1:11:35] they're always around but guess what
[1:11:36] they're not in relationship
[1:11:38] they're just they're there and they'll
[1:11:40] hug on them and they'll do all sorts of
[1:11:42] things with them but they're not in true
[1:11:43] relationship with them
[1:11:44] right it's got to be the same thing with
[1:11:46] Christ we can't just be groupies of
[1:11:47] Christ we're supposed to be a bride amen
[1:11:49] we're supposed to be an intimate
[1:11:51] relationship because he has called us
[1:11:52] into the wedding chamber not us trying
[1:11:54] to break into it of our own things you
[1:11:56] know
[1:11:59] in the beginning the scripture tells the
[1:12:00] man to cleave to the wife that's the key
[1:12:03] to Redemption is that he's got to come
[1:12:04] back and cleave to us and that's what
[1:12:06] they turned down when Christ came they
[1:12:08] turned down the opportunity to cleave
[1:12:10] back to him he came there and he gave
[1:12:12] his life for them he was there to redeem
[1:12:13] them back into relationship and they
[1:12:15] turned them down amen
[1:12:18] listen we talk about the seventh seal we
[1:12:20] talk about the mysteries of God but why
[1:12:22] is it quiet under the seventh seal he's
[1:12:24] talking to some brothers about this
[1:12:26] earlier why is it quiet under the
[1:12:27] seventh seal because Christ isn't there
[1:12:30] why isn't he there
[1:12:31] because in order to get us back into
[1:12:33] Oneness he has to cleave and guess what
[1:12:36] he can't cleave when he's there and
[1:12:37] we're here what does he do he's got to
[1:12:39] come down here to cleave
[1:12:40] right he's got to come down here to woo
[1:12:42] a bride he's got to draw her to him and
[1:12:44] she's got to cleave to him and he's got
[1:12:46] to cleave to her and they've got to be
[1:12:47] one flesh amen the prophet talks about
[1:12:49] what the invisible Union of the Heavenly
[1:12:51] bridegroom and the Earthly bride that's
[1:12:53] what's happening is he's come down under
[1:12:55] that seventh seal which is what the
[1:12:57] coming of the Lord to come down and do
[1:12:59] what cleave unto his bride to restore
[1:13:01] fellowship and unity so that their one
[1:13:04] body one body under one mind
[1:13:07] right because the two bodies two mind
[1:13:10] thing doesn't work anymore never did
[1:13:12] work
[1:13:12] prophet of God says this how many
[1:13:14] Knowles there's a difference between the
[1:13:15] appearing of Christ and the coming of
[1:13:17] Christ it's two different words now the
[1:13:19] appearing now's the appearing the coming
[1:13:21] will be soon he's appeared in the midst
[1:13:23] of us doing the works that he once did
[1:13:25] in his church he says now you're a part
[1:13:27] of that church and by Grace you believe
[1:13:29] I'm a member of that church now I'm not
[1:13:31] a preacher you know I'm not I have not
[1:13:33] the education to do it he says sometimes
[1:13:35] I feel reluctant standing here by men of
[1:13:37] God who's called to that office
[1:13:38] there are Apostles preachers prophets
[1:13:41] teachers pastors and evangelists not all
[1:13:43] our Apostles are prophets not all our
[1:13:45] teachers are evangelists I'm standing
[1:13:47] here but by Ministries a different
[1:13:49] Ministry from a pastor or teacher I'm
[1:13:51] not and if I say things wrong Brethren
[1:13:53] forgive me I don't mean to but this is
[1:13:56] my Ministry C to declare him that he's
[1:13:59] here why because he's got to cleave to
[1:14:02] us to restore us back if we're going to
[1:14:04] come back into Oneness then he's got to
[1:14:06] be there to cleave to us amen we speak
[1:14:08] of being a spotless bride and and we are
[1:14:11] because we're under the blood of Christ
[1:14:12] amen but that's not what takes us off a
[1:14:15] planet in a resurrection and a Rapture
[1:14:17] amen until you are united with the
[1:14:19] bridegroom you're still separated and
[1:14:20] you're not going to go
[1:14:21] you can't do it amen you're still on the
[1:14:24] outside looking in there's potential but
[1:14:25] potential isn't enough
[1:14:27] and then we speak of being predestinated
[1:14:29] children of God and we are and we praise
[1:14:31] the Lord for that but being
[1:14:32] predestinated is not what takes you off
[1:14:34] of this planet amen it only comes when
[1:14:36] you're United with him because the life
[1:14:38] that's in him is the life that's in you
[1:14:39] and that's resurrection power that's
[1:14:41] rapturing power he was resurrected and
[1:14:44] then he was raptured wasn't he we see
[1:14:46] both manifestations when he came and
[1:14:47] died on the cross rose again and then
[1:14:49] he's raptured up into the clouds and
[1:14:50] that's where we meet him in the same
[1:14:52] life
[1:14:52] amen that's what he's doing we can't be
[1:14:55] fussing and fighting about Unity or not
[1:14:57] having unity and expect to go with
[1:14:59] Christ amen we say church is pointing at
[1:15:01] each other we see ministers pointing at
[1:15:03] each other we see people judging each
[1:15:05] other left and right amen we've got to
[1:15:07] be able to see beyond our own our own
[1:15:09] lives our own gifts our own colleagues
[1:15:11] our own Ministries our own churches and
[1:15:13] see that this is a body that's so much
[1:15:15] bigger than who we are in this little
[1:15:17] building in this little Ministry or in
[1:15:19] any other one you pick the best and the
[1:15:20] greatest you have to be able to see that
[1:15:22] there's more to this body than just this
[1:15:23] body here amen this is a global body
[1:15:26] amen he's calling us out of every tongue
[1:15:28] and tribe and nation and guess what they
[1:15:30] worship different in Africa than we
[1:15:31] worship here
[1:15:33] right there they worship different in
[1:15:35] Florida than we do in here they
[1:15:36] definitely worship different in Japan
[1:15:38] than we do here
[1:15:40] and somebody go and say well they don't
[1:15:41] worship like we do there's no Spirit
[1:15:42] there guess what God's got a bride of
[1:15:45] every type and shape amen there's a lot
[1:15:46] of flowers in his garden guess what some
[1:15:49] only flower for a little bit some of
[1:15:50] them go forever some have a million like
[1:15:53] it and then some there's only a few
[1:15:54] plants like it in the world Amen I mean
[1:15:56] it's up to him to decide who's in the
[1:15:58] body not up to us but that Unity amen
[1:16:01] we're never going to have all the
[1:16:02] answers we're never going to be able to
[1:16:03] point to one man one Ministry that
[1:16:05] church and say they've got everything
[1:16:07] they have all the answers because what
[1:16:10] does it lead to you got to attend our
[1:16:11] church now
[1:16:13] it's never been God's plan
[1:16:15] he flung them around the globe right he
[1:16:18] drove them out through persecution to
[1:16:19] get to all the different places and now
[1:16:20] we've come back and said there's only
[1:16:22] one or two or three people in the world
[1:16:23] that have a real Ministry it's hogwash
[1:16:26] that's a lie from Satan is what that is
[1:16:28] I mean I'll call it what it is it's
[1:16:29] alive from Satan amen because what he
[1:16:32] promised today that we could come back
[1:16:33] to full fellowship and that fellowship's
[1:16:35] going to be in the bride before it's
[1:16:36] ever going to be something that takes us
[1:16:37] out of this planet amen if we can't get
[1:16:39] along together here how are we going to
[1:16:40] get together up there and then the same
[1:16:42] Spirits got to be inside of us to draw
[1:16:44] us together and that's what we've got to
[1:16:45] recognize is the spirit that's within us
[1:16:47] not just the gifts and the callings that
[1:16:49] we see amongst each other
[1:16:50] Romans 12 says I beseech you therefore
[1:16:52] Brethren that you by the mercies of God
[1:16:55] that you present your bodies a Living
[1:16:57] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[1:17:00] is your reasonable service and be not
[1:17:02] conformed to this world but be
[1:17:04] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:17:06] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:17:09] acceptable and perfect will of God what
[1:17:11] that perfect means the whole body of
[1:17:13] Truth for your day guess what Adam had
[1:17:17] it and he lost it
[1:17:18] Moses had it and he lost it Joseph had
[1:17:22] it and he lost it David had it and he
[1:17:24] lost it phenomenal man we have
[1:17:26] phenomenal women all great Believers in
[1:17:28] the scriptures and guess what they could
[1:17:30] never come to a state of perfection
[1:17:32] but guess what we've been called to be
[1:17:34] perfect
[1:17:35] we've been called to be mature we've
[1:17:37] been called to produce the fullness of
[1:17:40] the word as a collective body amen
[1:17:43] what they saw God with all their hearts
[1:17:45] and they still didn't get there
[1:17:47] that's not it
[1:17:48] because what it's not him that willeth
[1:17:50] for him that runeth but it's God Amen
[1:17:53] and that's what we're coming back to is
[1:17:54] our strength is in him and that's why
[1:17:56] we're cleaving to him rather than
[1:17:57] running around on our own because our
[1:17:59] strength is when we're United with him
[1:18:00] because he's the great balancing act
[1:18:02] that we need in our life that's the
[1:18:04] power that's the strength that the
[1:18:05] authority that we're looking for he says
[1:18:08] for I say through the grace given unto
[1:18:09] me to every man that is among you not to
[1:18:11] think of himself more highly than he
[1:18:13] ought to think
[1:18:14] and to think soberly accordingly as God
[1:18:17] had dealt to every man The Measure of
[1:18:19] Faith listen not everybody has what we
[1:18:21] call a hundred a hundredfold faith
[1:18:24] some are 60 some are 30 but every child
[1:18:26] of God has faith but we don't look down
[1:18:28] on those that have less
[1:18:30] and we don't promote those that have
[1:18:31] more amen because he says don't think
[1:18:33] any highly more highly of yourself than
[1:18:35] you ought to why because it is how God
[1:18:37] had dealt to you the measure that you
[1:18:39] have amen he says for us we have many
[1:18:42] members in one body and all members have
[1:18:44] not the same office
[1:18:46] so we've been many are one body in
[1:18:49] Christ and everyone remembers one of
[1:18:51] another
[1:18:52] God puts it this way in the united time
[1:18:54] and sign after the seals he says but the
[1:18:57] church the bride is United by one God
[1:19:00] under one Spirit the spirit of God in
[1:19:03] one holy Union of God to be one holy
[1:19:06] bride to God that's a lot of ones
[1:19:09] it's a lot of ones that means there
[1:19:10] can't be a bunch of everybody else's
[1:19:11] we're all together all one thing
[1:19:14] that's right all together Unity of the
[1:19:17] body the body waiting as a bride as it
[1:19:21] is the Bride As we call ourselves the
[1:19:23] bride for the uniting time of the Bride
[1:19:25] the church is so coming together
[1:19:29] it should just create a love Among Us
[1:19:32] that we could hardly be away from one
[1:19:34] another that's right you don't have to
[1:19:36] beg people to pray you don't have to beg
[1:19:39] them to worship God you don't have to
[1:19:40] beg them to do what's right they're so
[1:19:42] in love with him till there's nothing
[1:19:45] else that's why it just warms my heart
[1:19:47] when we're missing a third of the
[1:19:49] congregation you come out it's as if
[1:19:50] everybody was here in the worship why
[1:19:52] because it's not about the numbers it's
[1:19:54] about him amen it's about your love for
[1:19:57] him it's about your appreciation and
[1:19:58] worship for him and we're United in that
[1:20:01] and all of a sudden God does wonderful
[1:20:02] things in our midst amen
[1:20:04] Prophet God takes us and he points us to
[1:20:06] the great mystery of God and he ties it
[1:20:08] all into one big Redemption picture or
[1:20:10] not for us he's talking about the
[1:20:12] threefold purpose and he says first is
[1:20:14] to express himself completely God in
[1:20:17] Christ who's that second Adam
[1:20:20] and then the second Adam can't fail
[1:20:22] so he says that's got to be perfect
[1:20:24] there then second he has to have the
[1:20:26] preeminence by this in his church which
[1:20:30] is his body
[1:20:31] so you have the second Adam now he says
[1:20:33] you are his body singular one not two
[1:20:37] that he says the bride till he could
[1:20:40] have preeminence to express himself
[1:20:42] through them
[1:20:44] he says and thirdly to restore full
[1:20:47] Redemption the kingdom to its rightly
[1:20:49] position that fell by sin by the first
[1:20:52] Adam back to what
[1:20:54] are their signs and wonders following us
[1:20:57] where there's great things going on in
[1:20:58] the service and people are shouting and
[1:21:00] dancing and screaming
[1:21:02] wonderful praise the Lord for it don't
[1:21:04] want to lose it he says restore us back
[1:21:06] to where he walked in the cool of the
[1:21:09] evening with his people talked with them
[1:21:11] and fellowshipped with them amen that's
[1:21:14] why brother Branham would say this is
[1:21:16] not a Pentecostal message in the sense
[1:21:18] of what they had in Azusa Street he says
[1:21:20] this was calling a bride out
[1:21:22] right it was to catch her attention it
[1:21:25] was a gift that Eleazar took to Rebecca
[1:21:27] but that is not the end goal the angle
[1:21:29] is to get her on a camel and get her to
[1:21:31] Isaac that's what he's talking about
[1:21:33] here catcher catch you
[1:21:35] get you get you with a vision of who he
[1:21:38] is
[1:21:38] right the perfect Christ the second Adam
[1:21:41] and then now he's got to get you into
[1:21:43] what relationship so he can have the
[1:21:44] preeminence and then when he gets the
[1:21:46] preeminence now you step into full
[1:21:47] fellowship and the kingdom is is just
[1:21:49] going to fall right over and we'll go
[1:21:51] right into a millennium right
[1:21:53] speaking in Ephesians 4 the fivefold
[1:21:55] Ministries effect he says it's there how
[1:21:58] long how long is the fivefold ministry
[1:22:00] going to be here
[1:22:01] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:22:03] faith
[1:22:04] what is the unity of the faith I've said
[1:22:06] it before the unity of the faith what is
[1:22:08] it we're all believing for
[1:22:10] we only have one belief we want in this
[1:22:12] age what is it it's a resurrection that
[1:22:15] leads to a rapture
[1:22:17] that's the unity of our faith because
[1:22:19] that's when it separates who really
[1:22:20] believes and who didn't
[1:22:21] is when you go in a Rapture and until
[1:22:23] that day happens nobody knows for sure
[1:22:25] whether they're truly a Believer we
[1:22:27] believe it by faith we accept it by
[1:22:29] faith we act on these things but this is
[1:22:31] the separating sign is going to be who
[1:22:32] goes in that Rapture that's for the
[1:22:34] bride of Christ and the bride of Christ
[1:22:35] alone so guess what you're going to deal
[1:22:37] with the five-fold ministry until we
[1:22:38] come to the unity of the faith as a part
[1:22:40] of that fivefold Ministry let me say
[1:22:42] this let's make sure we're contributing
[1:22:44] to Unity and not disunity I mean let's
[1:22:46] not be the separation that happens in
[1:22:48] the church let's not be the cleaving
[1:22:49] amen by men's thoughts or men's ideas or
[1:22:52] relationships or friendships or anything
[1:22:54] like that but let us be here to draw
[1:22:56] everyone together and let Christ do the
[1:22:57] separating
[1:22:59] till we come all in the unity of the
[1:23:00] faith the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:23:02] unto a perfect man
[1:23:05] wholesome the full truth complete mature
[1:23:09] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:23:12] fullness of Christ that we henceforth be
[1:23:15] no more children let me go back how do
[1:23:18] you get the stature the full stature of
[1:23:19] a man
[1:23:22] if we come to here
[1:23:24] is that the full stature
[1:23:26] if this is a body
[1:23:29] if we come to here is that the stature
[1:23:30] of the fullness
[1:23:31] what is the stature of the fullness how
[1:23:33] do you get to the fullness of stature
[1:23:34] how do you get the highest point on a on
[1:23:36] a body
[1:23:37] you gotta add the head
[1:23:39] so until we are united fully with Christ
[1:23:42] and the head comes down unites with the
[1:23:43] body that's how long the fivefold
[1:23:45] ministry is going to be here because
[1:23:46] what he's got to be he's got to be the
[1:23:49] Capstone he's got to be the intelligence
[1:23:50] he's got to be the Mind remember because
[1:23:52] that's how Adam couldn't fall was when
[1:23:54] there was one mind one body joined
[1:23:56] together that's what he's bringing us
[1:23:57] back to he says that we henceforth be no
[1:24:00] more children tossed to and fro carried
[1:24:02] about every wind of Doctrine by the
[1:24:04] Slate of man in cunning craftiness
[1:24:05] whereby they lie and wait to deceive
[1:24:07] window Doctrine guess what when
[1:24:09] something new is rolling through you
[1:24:11] know what I do I stand back and I say
[1:24:13] let's see where this goes
[1:24:16] that's what Paul told us to do
[1:24:18] something new comes through sit back and
[1:24:20] see the fruit of it first
[1:24:21] and then because sometimes they can be
[1:24:24] right in the word and wrong in the
[1:24:25] spirit and that's definitely what you
[1:24:27] don't want
[1:24:28] you don't want to be wrong in your
[1:24:29] spirit because that's where the
[1:24:30] Pharisees work they were right
[1:24:32] technically but they were wrong in the
[1:24:33] way they applied it and they got off the
[1:24:35] they got off the Mark didn't they
[1:24:37] you're a lot easier to correct if your
[1:24:38] spirit's right and your doctrine's wrong
[1:24:42] he says but speaking the truth in love
[1:24:44] may grow up into him
[1:24:47] listen speaking the truth and love
[1:24:48] that's a fightful ministry's job we're
[1:24:50] supposed to be speaking the truth in
[1:24:52] love not to beat you down not to push
[1:24:54] you down not to dissuade you not to beat
[1:24:57] you up none of these things but it's
[1:24:58] also for us to speak to one another that
[1:25:01] even when it's hard even when it's harsh
[1:25:02] we're doing it out of love to you
[1:25:05] right we're doing it for your benefit
[1:25:06] not for ours love has always got to be
[1:25:08] the driving force in these things
[1:25:09] because what cleaving is all about love
[1:25:12] you can't cleave to somebody you don't
[1:25:14] love
[1:25:15] hey man if you think somebody's ugly you
[1:25:17] think somebody's stinky you think
[1:25:19] somebody's got a nasty habit you think
[1:25:21] somebody's just not nice to be around
[1:25:23] you don't want to cleave to them do you
[1:25:25] it's love that causes you to cleave
[1:25:28] listen while we were yet in sin he
[1:25:30] cleaved to us amen
[1:25:33] how are we to respond to those that are
[1:25:35] around us maybe in the same condition at
[1:25:37] times
[1:25:38] he says but speaking the truth and love
[1:25:40] may grow up unto him in all things which
[1:25:42] is the head even Christ remember grow up
[1:25:44] into him
[1:25:46] which is the head the head's waiting and
[1:25:48] we're just coming up and we'll join up
[1:25:50] when we reach that full stature
[1:25:52] he says from home the whole body fitly
[1:25:55] joined together and compacted by that
[1:25:57] which every joint supplyeth according to
[1:26:00] the effectual working and the measure of
[1:26:01] every part make it increase of the body
[1:26:03] under the edifying of itself and love
[1:26:05] I've always said that's the most
[1:26:06] difficult
[1:26:07] scripture to read because it seems that
[1:26:09] there's so much going on but basically
[1:26:11] it's saying that when you're joined to
[1:26:12] him the whole body works together and
[1:26:14] everything supports everything else and
[1:26:16] it does its job in a way that everybody
[1:26:18] benefits and nobody hurts
[1:26:21] that's the kind of body I want to be a
[1:26:22] part of Amen where it works together
[1:26:24] seamlessly where we're all pulling in
[1:26:26] the same direction where we're all
[1:26:27] looking to achieve it amen
[1:26:29] so what are we talking about what was
[1:26:31] Adam in the beginning and then we see
[1:26:33] Adam as a man and woman single body and
[1:26:35] then he turns into two and they're
[1:26:36] cleaving and they're doing the work of
[1:26:38] God together amen they're in Perfect
[1:26:40] Harmony and that's where perfectionally
[1:26:41] that's where the truth lay that's where
[1:26:43] Victory lay that's where fulfillmently
[1:26:44] and as long as they were cleaving they
[1:26:46] were fine and they didn't fall we don't
[1:26:48] know how long they were in the garden we
[1:26:50] don't know how long it took for them to
[1:26:51] get separated to a point
[1:26:53] but the prophet of God comes with this
[1:26:54] and Christ is the mystery of God
[1:26:55] revealed he says it's a revelation it's
[1:26:59] as Eternal as God's word is eternal look
[1:27:01] but the threefold purpose of God's great
[1:27:03] mystery is revealed God manifested in
[1:27:06] Christ Christ manifested in the church
[1:27:08] in order to redeem the Lost Eve back to
[1:27:12] the original condition in the Garden of
[1:27:13] Eden he says oh my notice it's eve not
[1:27:15] Adam the second Adam's already perfect
[1:27:17] he's already proven himself
[1:27:20] amen but why because he's the word now
[1:27:23] he's got to bring the part that was
[1:27:24] separated from him back into alignment
[1:27:27] so that they're under the same mind so
[1:27:29] that she can be made perfect along with
[1:27:31] him but I want you to catch her
[1:27:33] Perfection is not in her works
[1:27:35] because why we're under a Grace Covenant
[1:27:37] you don't need Grace if your works are
[1:27:39] perfect
[1:27:40] Abraham wasn't there by works what was
[1:27:42] he there by faith and this is a word
[1:27:45] that is what she has her righteousness
[1:27:46] by faith this is a believing bride amen
[1:27:50] this is an age of faith
[1:27:52] great faith this is an age of rapturing
[1:27:54] faith and it comes by what her accepting
[1:27:57] the promise and God coming down and
[1:27:58] saying to her be thou perfect amen
[1:28:01] believe it believe it and I'll do it
[1:28:03] that's all he's looking for amen we're
[1:28:06] sitting here today and we're looking for
[1:28:07] the fullness of redemption amen and what
[1:28:09] are we we're a bunch of bodies separated
[1:28:11] from God physically I'm talking of
[1:28:13] course right we're stronger when we're
[1:28:15] together but unless he's with us then
[1:28:18] we're still going to fall eventually
[1:28:19] right we can't hold a great Army still
[1:28:22] can't hold against Satan without the
[1:28:24] power of the Lord in their midst amen
[1:28:25] the shout of the King has to be in the
[1:28:27] camp amen
[1:28:28] so where are you if we're going to be
[1:28:30] back under perfect Redemption one body
[1:28:32] Unified
[1:28:34] under one mind
[1:28:36] under one intelligence and that's got to
[1:28:38] be Christ the word I mean that's got to
[1:28:40] be the head the head always has to be
[1:28:42] the word and if we can align with that
[1:28:43] let that have its preeminence in all of
[1:28:45] us then that's what's going to draw us
[1:28:47] back
[1:28:48] so we've got to be cleaving to the word
[1:28:49] we're cleaving To The Head and the head
[1:28:52] is trying to cleave down to us but guess
[1:28:54] what he can't move the standard you
[1:28:57] can't move the word
[1:28:58] he can't draw it he can't push it away
[1:29:01] for us amen so he's got to pull us
[1:29:03] through it to get us back to him how's
[1:29:04] he doing he does it through the blood
[1:29:06] amen he pulls us through himself he
[1:29:08] pulls us through that perfect that
[1:29:10] perfect Veil that perfect filter so that
[1:29:12] he can't see anything and that's what
[1:29:13] allows him to draw us back to us is that
[1:29:15] he looks at us through the Redemption
[1:29:16] the righteousness that he gave us at
[1:29:18] Calvary where he stepped in and he said
[1:29:20] I'll take theirs and I'll give them mine
[1:29:22] and that's what allows us to be drawn
[1:29:23] back to him because he can't see it in
[1:29:24] the first place amen
[1:29:26] prophet of God we're closing he says
[1:29:28] you're going to form what's known to me
[1:29:30] as a bride you're going to form that
[1:29:32] means it wasn't formed at that time why
[1:29:34] because he was calling him out this is
[1:29:36] 1962 restoration of the Bride tree he
[1:29:38] says all right I'll go with you
[1:29:41] and you'll be part of me you'll be my
[1:29:44] bride my life will be in your body just
[1:29:47] like a husband and wife as one person
[1:29:49] you and I are going to be one and at
[1:29:52] that day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:29:53] Father the father and me and I and you
[1:29:55] and you and me he says I just love that
[1:29:58] Satan just gets so angry at that see the
[1:30:01] Oneness of God all that God was he
[1:30:04] poured into Christ and all Christ was he
[1:30:06] poured into the church he says there you
[1:30:08] are it makes them all one
[1:30:10] he talks about that pouring into and it
[1:30:11] reminds me of if you've ever done a
[1:30:13] renovation or a restoration in a home or
[1:30:15] a car what do you do you pour all of
[1:30:17] your money into it don't you you pour
[1:30:19] all of your energy all of your spare
[1:30:21] time everything you got goes into that
[1:30:23] and why do you do it because you value
[1:30:25] the end product more than you value the
[1:30:27] pain that you have to go through and you
[1:30:30] know living on ramen noodles and craft
[1:30:31] dinner for months on end to try and pay
[1:30:33] it off
[1:30:34] it's no different with Christ he poured
[1:30:36] all of that into us and he poured
[1:30:37] everything that he was into us why
[1:30:39] because he valued the end result more
[1:30:41] than the pain he went through Agony he
[1:30:43] died of death that no other man remember
[1:30:45] I've said before brother Brown said he
[1:30:46] had a body created to handle the pain
[1:30:49] that he was going through because no
[1:30:50] human body no normal human body could
[1:30:52] handle the agony and the torture that he
[1:30:54] went through that's what he went through
[1:30:55] to pay the price for us why because he
[1:30:57] valued the end product and then he
[1:31:00] valued the wife that he was going to get
[1:31:01] out of it
[1:31:03] he says as our minds tonight search back
[1:31:05] through the corners of generations back
[1:31:07] into the Early times what a beautiful
[1:31:09] Fellowship it must have been when God
[1:31:11] called his children in the cool of the
[1:31:13] evening and commune with them then
[1:31:14] kissing them as it was on their cheeks
[1:31:16] and laying them down to sleep for a
[1:31:18] night's rest and the wild beast of the
[1:31:20] field he bedded down without any
[1:31:21] disturbance or harm no harm was there no
[1:31:24] death no sickness and no trouble he says
[1:31:27] and to awake on a new day to walk in the
[1:31:30] presence of their creator without fear
[1:31:32] without sickness
[1:31:34] he says oh God he says our spirit's
[1:31:36] groan for that time again for that's
[1:31:39] what we were made for
[1:31:41] amen it struck me when brother vaisha
[1:31:44] was talking about coming into the
[1:31:45] services here the first time and he said
[1:31:48] it was different than any other church
[1:31:49] I've been in you know what I believe it
[1:31:51] is it's people that are groaning and
[1:31:53] crying out people that have a desire not
[1:31:55] just to come in here and put a big face
[1:31:57] on it and put on a show but we're
[1:31:59] groaning and we're crying out for that
[1:32:01] relationship with Christ to be closer to
[1:32:03] him than we've ever been to be restored
[1:32:05] back to his presence Amen in a way we've
[1:32:07] never been able to go into before what
[1:32:10] is it we want to get back to where we
[1:32:12] were
[1:32:13] we want to get back to what he promised
[1:32:14] us we'd go back to we want to get back
[1:32:16] to that which he paid the price of
[1:32:18] redemption for
[1:32:19] how's he going to do it
[1:32:22] Holly bring us back to that time
[1:32:24] John 14 15 says if you love me keep my
[1:32:27] Commandments and I will pray the father
[1:32:29] and he will give you another comforter
[1:32:31] that he may abide with you forever even
[1:32:33] the spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:32:35] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:32:37] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[1:32:39] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:32:43] he says I will not leave you comfortless
[1:32:45] I will come to you now what is it he's
[1:32:48] taking us all the way back to Genesis 2
[1:32:50] 24 and he's saying what a man will leave
[1:32:53] his mother and his father and will
[1:32:55] cleave to his wife and he says I'm
[1:32:58] leaving you but I'm not leaving you I'm
[1:33:01] leaving you in this form but I'm going
[1:33:02] to come back in another form because the
[1:33:04] only way you're going to be restored
[1:33:06] back is if I keep cleaving to you I've
[1:33:08] got to stay in constant communion with
[1:33:10] you so you're not going to see me but
[1:33:12] you're going to see me I'm not going to
[1:33:13] be with you but I'm going to be with you
[1:33:15] because I'm going to come back in a
[1:33:16] different way and it's going to allow me
[1:33:17] to be with you day and night 24 hours a
[1:33:20] day seven days a week 365 and a quarter
[1:33:23] days a year all the way to the attorney
[1:33:25] and he says what I'll never leave you
[1:33:27] I'll never forsake you even till the end
[1:33:29] of the world what is it he's cleaving to
[1:33:31] us because that's the requirement for
[1:33:33] Redemption is you've got to cleave to
[1:33:35] them to hold them and bring them back
[1:33:36] amen
[1:33:39] amen we need our bridegroom to cleave to
[1:33:40] us when we don't even know that we he's
[1:33:42] our bridegroom that's the beauty of it
[1:33:44] is we don't even know who we are and yet
[1:33:46] he's there and he's wooing us and he's
[1:33:48] calling us and he's cleaning us and he's
[1:33:49] doing all these things to us and half
[1:33:51] the time we don't even realize it didn't
[1:33:53] realize it I should say
[1:33:54] he says yet a little while in the world
[1:33:56] seeth me no more but you see me and
[1:33:58] because I live you shall live also
[1:34:03] Deuteronomy 31 8 says and the Lord
[1:34:05] here it is that God does go before thee
[1:34:08] he will be with thee he will not fail
[1:34:11] thee neither forsake thee fear not
[1:34:13] neither be dismayed amen
[1:34:17] let's stand together if we would
[1:34:21] I think so often we put so much pressure
[1:34:23] on ourselves
[1:34:26] it's because we believe we're back under
[1:34:28] the law
[1:34:29] we don't realize it but guess what
[1:34:30] that's what Catholicism is is it's the
[1:34:32] login
[1:34:34] but the law of redemption is not based
[1:34:37] on our performance
[1:34:39] our performance got us to where we need
[1:34:40] Redemption
[1:34:41] and so when you step into the Redemption
[1:34:43] Covenant when you step into what he's
[1:34:45] got planned for you then you realize
[1:34:47] that it has to be a work of his and the
[1:34:48] only thing you have to do is submit
[1:34:50] yourself to it accept it recognize your
[1:34:53] need
[1:34:54] and that is up to him to do it what did
[1:34:56] Boaz do and Ruth
[1:34:59] he he says I'm going to redeem you he
[1:35:01] gives her food to carry her through so
[1:35:03] she doesn't have to work anymore and
[1:35:05] then he she goes and she rests and she
[1:35:07] rests and she rests until he walks up
[1:35:10] and says I've got the title D you're
[1:35:12] good to go I'm going to marry you and
[1:35:15] everything's going to be okay and you're
[1:35:16] never gonna have to work a day in your
[1:35:17] life
[1:35:18] what is it as soon as she stepped into
[1:35:20] the Redemption Covenant all of her
[1:35:22] stress went away the only word she had
[1:35:24] is is he really going to do it
[1:35:25] and Naomi said fear not he'll do it
[1:35:28] he'll do it he's the kind of man that's
[1:35:30] going to do it and so often we're
[1:35:31] sitting there and we're saying because
[1:35:33] we look at these Redemptive Life scenes
[1:35:35] and we look at healing and we look at
[1:35:36] deliverance and we look at at all these
[1:35:38] different things salvation and we say
[1:35:40] I've got to do something no no you don't
[1:35:43] have to do anything his Redemptive work
[1:35:45] is what's going to do it and the only
[1:35:47] thing you're trying to do is get back to
[1:35:48] cleave to him so that you're not getting
[1:35:49] in his way then you're just letting him
[1:35:51] do the work it takes all the pressure
[1:35:53] off amen you look at we talked about
[1:35:56] pouring everything into it
[1:35:58] all we have to do is pour everything we
[1:36:00] got into him
[1:36:01] that's it
[1:36:03] that's all it all you're doing is
[1:36:04] getting him to the place where you're
[1:36:06] not getting in his way right and then
[1:36:08] it's his work
[1:36:10] it's his work you're clothed in his
[1:36:11] righteousness
[1:36:12] so your conscience can't bother you
[1:36:14] anymore Satan's got no weapon against
[1:36:16] you when it comes to your conscience
[1:36:17] because your clothing is righteousness
[1:36:18] under the blood of Christ
[1:36:20] listen we have no powering of ourselves
[1:36:23] but on the Redemption path all we're
[1:36:24] doing is we're looking to the gifts that
[1:36:26] he gives us to keep us going until he
[1:36:28] restores us back to that full end then
[1:36:30] so we once we get on that Land once we
[1:36:31] get into our property all we do is stay
[1:36:33] in line with him we stay close to him
[1:36:35] and that's what takes care of it all
[1:36:36] that's all we're looking to stay close
[1:36:38] to him and even as a study the more I've
[1:36:41] studied over the last year for certain
[1:36:42] the thing that jumps out of me is stay
[1:36:44] close to him
[1:36:45] stay close to him get in relationship
[1:36:47] with him amen I I feel and I see so
[1:36:51] often and not so much I I Believe by
[1:36:53] God's grace in this church but it's not
[1:36:55] about saying just Amen to the word but
[1:36:57] it's having a relationship with the word
[1:36:59] itself amen amen amen where you go to
[1:37:01] pray and you know that he's listening
[1:37:04] amen and you know that he's answering
[1:37:06] and though he tarries yet he's still
[1:37:08] going to answer amen and you've got
[1:37:10] faith and I love her brother Noel
[1:37:12] Johnson said you know he says I've got
[1:37:13] to the point where he says I pray and I
[1:37:15] committed to God and I walk away knowing
[1:37:17] that he's going to meet the need
[1:37:19] that's what I want to be that's where I
[1:37:21] want to be amen where I don't have to
[1:37:23] sit there and worry and worry is he
[1:37:25] going to do it is he going to do it he's
[1:37:26] going to do everything well and he's
[1:37:28] going to do everything in his time and
[1:37:30] if it's if your name's on the title then
[1:37:32] whatever Zone that title is going to
[1:37:34] Belong To You by the end of this amen
[1:37:35] and whether it takes you a day or
[1:37:38] whether it takes you three centuries
[1:37:41] you're never going to live three
[1:37:42] centuries
[1:37:43] but you might lay in the grave for three
[1:37:45] centuries but in the end he's going to
[1:37:47] do all things well amen and that's what
[1:37:49] you just have to trust is that he's
[1:37:50] going to do what he said he would do
[1:37:52] that's how we live we live by faith this
[1:37:54] is a walk by faith this is a faith
[1:37:56] generation amen amen amen if we could
[1:37:59] only just oh it's a thing that's just
[1:38:02] driving me these days is give him the
[1:38:04] time
[1:38:05] and then don't worry about time
[1:38:08] you know give them the time to do what
[1:38:10] he said he would do don't worry don't
[1:38:12] fret
[1:38:13] don't get caught up in trying to make it
[1:38:15] happen
[1:38:16] that's the worst thing is if Abraham he
[1:38:19] he told Abraham be perfect produce the
[1:38:21] word and Abraham every time he tried to
[1:38:23] produce the word messed it up why
[1:38:25] because he tried to do it his way
[1:38:27] and that's our problem is we try and
[1:38:29] produce it our way rather than saying
[1:38:31] Lord have your way
[1:38:33] have your way sister morning would you
[1:38:34] play that song have your way I don't
[1:38:36] know it I don't know the the thing but
[1:38:38] we're going to pray even as she she
[1:38:39] plays that and then we'll sing have your
[1:38:41] way turn it over brother Bob my voice is
[1:38:43] going here
[1:38:45] amen I want a closer relationship with
[1:38:47] him
[1:38:48] amen I don't just want church services I
[1:38:50] don't just watch church sermons I don't
[1:38:52] just want to study for intellectual
[1:38:54] knowledge I'm in but I want to know the
[1:38:55] word and then the person of the word in
[1:38:58] a greater way than I've ever had it
[1:38:59] before amen
[1:39:01] amen let's just bow our heads Lord God
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:08] Lord how our hearts
[1:39:12] Lord they just desire to be closer
[1:39:16] Lord for a purity of relationship
[1:39:19] Lord a purity of commitment
[1:39:22] Lord where we cleave to you and we
[1:39:24] cleave away every other thing Lord God
[1:39:27] and Lord if we can't do that
[1:39:32] what hope do we have
[1:39:34] and yet Lord we
[1:39:39] mean to us Lord and you cut away those
[1:39:41] bonds that hold us
[1:39:43] Lord you cut away those things that are
[1:39:45] holding back the very life within us
[1:39:47] Lord and you draw us to yourself and
[1:39:50] your blood covers us and it cleans us
[1:39:53] Lord and sometimes you give us a
[1:39:54] spanking because of it but Lord You're
[1:39:56] always cleaving Lord when we run you're
[1:39:59] reaching out to overtake us and catch up
[1:40:01] Lord when we walk away you just step
[1:40:03] right over to us and say not today
[1:40:06] Lord we know you can't leave your word
[1:40:08] but you've got a long arm
[1:40:10] Lord and you've got a gracious nature
[1:40:12] that reaches out to pull us back every
[1:40:14] single time
[1:40:16] and so Lord we're praying tonight
[1:40:18] nor that sometimes we've sealed so far
[1:40:21] away
[1:40:22] Lord it seems like a Rapture is so far
[1:40:24] in the distance
[1:40:26] but we look at the times and we say it's
[1:40:28] close but maybe we don't feel it's close
[1:40:30] in our bodies Lord in this Fallen nature
[1:40:32] we have but Lord I'm praying you lift us
[1:40:34] higher tonight Lord that you would cut
[1:40:36] away those strings Lord that you would
[1:40:38] cleave us away from it Lord that
[1:40:40] willfully we'd step closer to you this
[1:40:43] evening Lord that we would say Lord have
[1:40:45] your way in our lives
[1:40:47] Lord we've tried it our way
[1:40:49] Lord we want to have more of your way
[1:40:51] tonight lawful we know that perfect
[1:40:53] Redemption only comes when we let you
[1:40:55] have your way
[1:40:56] for grant us Grace this evening we pray
[1:40:58] Lord even through the rest of the week
[1:41:00] more that we be drawn Closer to You Lord
[1:41:03] in true relationship Lord True
[1:41:05] Fellowship
[1:41:06] Lord one to the other Lord back and
[1:41:09] forth not a one-way Street Lord but you
[1:41:11] talking to us and us talking to you nor
[1:41:14] where we can open up our lives and let
[1:41:16] you in and have your way with us we pray
[1:41:19] grant us Grace Lord God we ask now in
[1:41:21] Jesus Christ's name we pray
