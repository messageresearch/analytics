[Applause] [Music] [Music] Amen praise the Lord God bless you janae the Lord willing if our brother John always there okay he's hiding behind the computers but by the grace of God will call on our brother to give his testimony thank God for the grace of God that brought us together as brothers a man we thank God for the grace of God in our brother Michael's wife chose life a man and the grace of God in our lives the grace of God in our brother John's life a man it's amazing I've leave it His grace that proving that not just to us but to those in India grace of God to those in in Africa the grace of God to those around the world there's some thoughts so I want to share with you eventually on grace because it's certain things that have struck me concerning grace that I have seen not just in the New Testament but in the Old Testament concerning the grace of God a man so brother sister listen let's humble ourselves to the grace of God let's appreciate the grace of God we're here tonight because of grace we're here in fellowship with our brother Joshua here we're in fellowship with our brother Rachel and our brother John it's the grace of God a man were in fellowship again as well and we mentioned this with our brother Alec and it's the grace of God a man since there's been many many many years since I first had fellowship with him many many years since I last that fellowship with him but God brought us together again amen oh praise the name of the Lord see God see what God's doing he's bringing his bride together and his the caller calling of the bride through the ministry that he sent to in these last days he-man see again everything is according to God's plan and God's purpose and God's pattern as I mentioned I believe in the last service here that most do not consider the planned purpose and pattern that is revealed in the world no no they just think this is God's Bible and this is god's 'you know word and and god said this and god did this and so on but they don't recognize the plan and many don't recognize the pattern that god is using and they don't they don't realize that that he's got a purpose a man because you know for you for years maybe that i was raised to believe you know that god did this and god did that but then you know the devil k the devil come in and then trick gone well there's no tricking of god no indeed hey man you don't surprise god with anything got to surprise us but but we don't surprise him and god surprised the devil but the devil won't surprise god he made a God knew that when he created the devil he knew what was going to happen he knew what he was going to do and God God / it's the permissive will of God hey there's a perfect will and there's a permissive will amen so we want the perfect will of God and down through the ages god of course the elect of god the sons and daughters of god they get they get the revelation of the perfect will of God for their age amen and they walk in it a man they hung with themselves to it as we since you don't just come into the light you walk in the light you don't just get into the spirit you walk in the spirit he made by the grace of God so we thank God for he made the revelation of his plan we thank God for bringing and bringing into the the purpose to our attention amen and then the way that God is doing it a man the pattern brother sister that's why we recognize God in that age got in God in this age and what God's going to do tomorrow amen because we recognize the planned purpose and pattern so thank God somewhere in the pattern of God some when the plan of God was this his will for our brother Alec to be here tonight with his will for her brother Joshua to be here and his will for brother Faisal to be here and our brother John a man we would never dream of this may be fifty years ago we would think maybe that before all of this could happen that the bride be gone in the rapture but God is God is bringing the bride e to the progression of the rapture amen until it reaches the climax just think he man and God is bringing assaulted with his red yellow black her white makes no difference in the in God's eyes it's his CSEC it's his sons and daughters and he see all just approved the body of Christ to prove it he's bringing us all together he's sending some over there but he's bringing says though some in Africa India China and and different parts of the world bringing them here they made a million that's God why because the bride is going to be made up of all all of these different creations of God so we thank God for our brothers and sisters amen it's been our it's been a man it's been the grace of God amen so we pray the grace of God to our brother John as he comes to give his testimony tonight hey man and we thank God for the gifts that God has given him when it comes to playing the guitar or the piano and singing and writing hymns a man god bless him say it's been a blessing to us God reveal himself in this way a man through our brother John and and I believe God's in it that well the Matthew following God's leadership in and getting our brother to to about with the recording of our services a man so thank the Lord for that CE o my you're not here to do nothing you're here to serve God we're here to serve one another a man by the grace of God and before our brother John comes just to bring greetings from brother Don Snell he called last night and he sends his greetings to the Saints and he's thanking us for our prayers for the fellowship in central Newfoundland so we pray the grace of God to our brother Don and under we understand - of course that sister Donna did ever her arm bro he said her arm was broken her shoulder when she fell that time and by the grace of God she's she's in recovery amen so god bless her we anything that's where our prayers for sister Donna his wife and also brother it's no I don't know I gave this before but our brother had called and thanked us for praying for him and he said he's in recovery himself and he's now he's to the place where he's going back to the services on Sunday and eventually soon he'll be going back to the services on Wednesday so god bless our brother aid snow a man and he appreciated our prayers and and the Saints that visited him when he was there in the hospital having his heart surgery and but he said he's feeling good now amen so we thank the Lord for that so god bless brother Don god bless brother head and also again another greeting and that's from brother Ron snow a man I am reminded you of before concerning what our brother will be doing and he reminded me and confirmed it in the phone call and that he will be going out to catch smells so he said he said I'll be catching smells well I said I hope so and I hope you catch enough I said for for the Saints in here oh yes he's today he's his intention usually him and his brother will go out and and try to catch some smells and of course we know that it's it's just their nature and they'll go out even if it's cold even if if the ice is broke is is frozen I've known the time when they were caught and did just break a hole in the ice and they just have a chair or something to sit on and just drop their lines down in the hole to catch the smelts so he sends his greetings and he said and he said I will be getting smelts and he's not also he said as it comes as the season comes it's going to be picking berries for the some of the Saints here amen so our brother on sends his greetings and thanks us for he praying for him and he needs prayer we thank the Lord that the pray the pain has gone from his arm he was having pain in him one of his arms and that's gone so we thank the Lord for that and he's thinking God for it but he is still experiencing pain in his neck so we pray the grace of God a man that he'll fulfill the promise in our brother Ron that with His stripes brother on is healed by the grace of God amen so the Lord bless you this saying and as saying I love him because he first loved me and we're going to turn to our brother John being prayer for our brother as he comes to give his testimony a man of them and listen with us our brother Faisal whether it's our brother Alec whether it's you mean with her brother John it's a testimony of the grace of God amen no matter what we have experienced it's the grace of God a man that brings us into the light to walk in the light that brings us into the spirit to walk in the spirit amen so the grace of God be with our brother John as he comes to share with us his faith amen I love him because he first loved me [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] may Allah bless you are we hoping our Bible we can read just one of us they take revelation 12 verse 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their life untii unto death may God had some blessings on his words we can have our city thank you so much pastor for giving me this privilege to stand here again and God bless you was the pure great man I know I am saying that because the zone as I wrote last time was based on his preachings was based on how he was showing us the grace of the Lord from time to eternity he brought us back it was built in Korea so first you are very source of inspiration for me and God also bless you for for everything that you have done for me going just to have some something here about my testimony and about surprise last last Wednesday when the person told me about giving a testimony whose wow this was strange to me but before that something came up two weeks ago I dream about myself standing on a certain place like this and I do you know like what was that exactly and last time when you first told me about giving our testimonials Wow this is surprise for me but God showed me standing in front of a church for the first time okay I'm just going to to have some something throughout my life and and we may sage how I believe that bowing in a message family and how we used to see things as a kid first thing I would like to talk about just the testimony how powerful is a testimony because in the revelation the Bible say they hope I came him by the blood of the Lamb and every reward of their testimony so I was just reading about okay a testimony how powerful it is how can I test money or fight a devil because the Bible say they overcame him so I was reading too much about that last week and just to find out why testimony is powerful also I found out in the Psalms of David sums 11 9 that he was saying that I will also speak of your testimony before kings and I will not be ashamed I was well now we are testimony and be ashamed so why that and I was reading a Bible if I found out where Paul say don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord so I was nothing okay a testimony and be a shame why people should be ashamed of the testimony whatever must walk in a certain way you have to be a shame of giving out why God has done for you because he knew a testimony is a part of to overcome him that it's written in our Bible here in Revelation 12 they who became him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony so from dinner for here as for the first time that testimony is powerful for a Christian even if it it it's some changes too small but is a testimony like Devi before he goes out and fight eight giant you had so many testimony in your brochure God had me in fighting I don't know a lie on or something like that it was having that with him he was like a train having away God's our testimony is like having wagons you have a train and you have so many testimony is like wagons once you first the devil you fight now you say no when I will seek God hit me when I was hungry he gave me food when I was doing this God did something for me those are like our our our welcomes that we have now is a become part of our faith now firmly we can fight it therefore I mean so I was just reading about that and why the devil doesn't like the tune of guy give the testimony because he know the world what testimony is to overcome him when you are testifying about God the devil don't like that you know because he knew something will happen by testifying what God has done for you in your life is like display how the devil was attacking you this big hall hall is tastic you know Hollis his movement strategy you are displaying that to her people and they therefore don't like that and Jesus also say something before I start my testimony say whoever therefore shall confess me before men we confess him before my father in heaven so I was okay now for God to confess hearts before for Jesus to confess her before God we must confess him before men and kings we must this Phi who his dance firmly no God will dispose of us he will convince us that this to turn stood up for me he he kept us standing for me where he was on the world when he was at charge or somewhere else that's why I came also to confess him before my lord hello I like that so that's why from dieting like artists when it's so powerful for a Christian and every of style that we are facing become our testimony we cannot be sick in God he has is a great testimony you had cancer and God here is a testimony you're having this strawberry God gave you science and and gave you solution is a testimony here we all stuck that we face today we become a testimony we need to put that in our wagons and next time when we will face the devil will not be afraid anymore because we knew God did something for us in the past it has become part of our experience I mean so my testimony I was thinking what am I going to start what am I going to start I was born you know in a message you know I don't know exactly but I found out something I will just say that in three options there is a world computation I had a world computation also a doctrine of computation and God's experience those I don't know if I can say that my this money but those are where God brought like God lead me to out from the world computation I was born a message you know family men said we have random Jesus Christ yeah you know we were born a message you know that was something good but in a house what was auras first yeah if you Oh God in my heart was there but the thing that was coming first was the fear of the parents now yeah that was the fasting the first thing you are fearing if gods that see who's doing this or if that seems you like doing such things he will be mad at you those are the things that we grab that you know in a house of the message the finger was there but was not first in my life what was coming first was my parents you know they are serving God a my father is a pastor so I don't have to do this I drafted yeah and God also was there but it was not when I I went out of my parents house now the view of God came first and if you of my apartment was was not anymore there he was out there my father was not there my opponent were there I was alone now I was studying having a leadership now and if you of God came fast anyhow I remember growing up and my dad was 10 years you know as we don't watch TV you know so yeah we don't wish to be a new professor we don't watch TV yeah but now when you're outside your parents on order now you must defend while your parent was telling you why we don't watch TV that was the world computation I had so many things why you guys don't drink you know us you know we know we don't drink because he's icy now someone will come and say okay he's had seen how you call Jesus turn our water to wine so you and you are telling me he's a sin so tell me how do the reward computation out of my parents house that was something that I was now facing it like every day with friends why doing this is bad why doing this is bad why doing this is bad god is love so why you can't go out and take a girlfriend you know god is love you know those are the things now you have to face against the world I had so many things and now I was a porno I was defending myself but I was no daddy enough strong to defend myself I was support to go back in reading the Bible to build up a faith where I was still alone to create a few of God in my heart not a few of parents or a few of brothers or sisters as a sort of a person or to create a fear of God now I cannot do this because I'm fearing God and you've ever say who's fearing God we have wisdom those are the things I was facing and they were a lot also they are they are things here I wrote down just I can remember and living amongst sinners and you know sometimes you are doing you are discussing about the Bible and they they don't want to believe the Bible but they just want to believe you I was like why you you just want to believe me but not not a but not you know the Bible has so many thoughts inside you know so many mistakes I say okay if it's a like so many mystic but it's God's Word and except the Bible I cannot be like I not a book in my life it's a no no no Joel but we believe you because your way of living is a it's just quite strange you know you don't drink you don't do that but yeah it's also good you know to not drink you know just taking water so I was having those kind of frame because I'm not stay away from them you know we used to go in same school and living outs so there were just my neighbors all the time and I was now studying defending the Word of God without my parent beside me without my brother and my sisters I was starting defend God's Word I were not supposed to get something by a boy and surely but in the beginning it was not like that I was trying to defend myself and I rest the case no okay tell us why God turn hi Warren to uh to a wine you see you're just listen yes II know you know it's a sin okay okay is that situations why why stop doing this is a sin well stop doing that is a sin so now after going through the Word of God I was having a way of defending his world I was now standing on the Word of God like Peter say like we don't have to be afraid of of confessing our faith we don't have to be afraid of that yeah we don't have to be afraid of that whatever the case we need to confess our faith by confessing our face because the devil knows by confessing you are creating in Sutton's people's mind when it arrived like in a time where they are drinking your so thing cannot also drink but now they are telling you John is a Christian menorah you know John cannot drink and it's a mizuhara no I can also drink you know those are the kind of thing that was happy you know we like you creatine in people's mind that you are a man of God without hypocracy you create that it's going to help you I because in doing sometimes things that they want to do and you want to pass fit they're gonna tell you that hey John but you you don't drink you know you know you know you don't do this oh yeah yeah I don't do this yeah you know it's good by confessing our faith and that was the world competition it was something out of my parent home I was supposed to face that I was supposed to to be a faith I was supposed to go to the readings I was supposed to defame the message I was supposed to defend Vera Branagh and and Terry damn that we have a prophet now in every day it was not that easy but after you you build that that that faith if you are if you are standing upon that state you will not be shaking anymore you can start defending are the Word of God show you them this show them that I remember in high school I remember ah no that was a in secretary school yet someone was asking okay so you are saying that God seen as a prophet but we know you know the time of the prophets in the Bible as person oh no even Paul was a prophet you know that no you said no Sunni day Malachi for show need a look 17:30 show you them how God still doing things as his promise because God say hey God can never do anything without sending a prophet God can ever do that God without a man he cannot do anything he need a man for him to walk through it as jesus for him to work through does were a Clara body to walk through the body and at this time now we must have a prophet before message from God I would all starting explain it to them like step by step by step step by step some was sustained okay now we have many profit John you know that as yeah and you've ever said so that Ravi in a certain time we we have so many fast profit as we have a fast ten dollars we also have original ten dollars so it doesn't mean that God doesn't have his profit among the first profits I was all starting showing them because the way the world see Christianity is now something funny something funny oh we have so many false prophets false preachers just running after money and you also a Christian now you must tell them that yeah we know that but in those kind of stuff God has Alec are chosen people inside so I was trying to explain to them over and over and over and I I praise God because God helped me out to convert eight the world out of my parents house and it was not that easy things it was hard up and down waiter but still standing on the Word of God and God will never never let you down God will never never let you down also there is something I doubt you know computation now now when you are in a message the devil so is there any message coming out fast doctrines now that was hard very hard because they are telling you go back and read that in a certain message you will see that go back and read this you see this now what was happening was you must know face first doctrine out of your parents house away from your your childhood charge away now you must face them you must face how to defend know how to to to create a standing against polygamy you must not create that you must define that saying that is not in God's Word that was not something easy in the message no no you know the Bible say like you know Davy if he was having so many wife you know now you have to create a standing in a tall tree now that was not something easy also facing a lot of dead tree in with our brothers discussing reading the Bible searching in some tree that was the time where I I knew now my standing on this message now I knew that even in this message we have swear people who are caught out there are so many even in this message but only few that are chosen to hit in a broad age some there may be in a loud addition age carry the Bible Petrey day goes by that we are preaching but only chosen go we go in a bread age I was now starting first in it we see that carry them know in the beginning it was not like that in a beginning it was not like that those three came out after the fall of RA and Eve but in the beginning it's not like that and you ever say even the professor that we are going back as it was in the beginning so why you want to create a stand after the beginning you create a doctrine where you just want to stay there I said no the Bible say like what was written a man who's supposed to get marry for one wife Kosmos why do you ever say that was the only murder that God or Nurik yeah cut only only that Mirage where Adam and Eve so that was in the beginning no sin were there now you are telling me that now is not a see is part of the world I was not trying to face to defend the Word of God not by myself but by God's grace by God's grace my parents are waiting for me you know just away you just alone if you by body message you have to define it also there are some people who who say that we are already in a million you like we already in a million you we are already like in heaven I was like people say we already like in heaven so many things even those who used to say what a phenom is God now those that you want you should get get away from them why because they have a seat a serpent seed inside them after like having a conversation okay I remember I had a friend a friend of mine she was in a in Paris you know she was also born message she read in Paris operate in Como change religion they started out believing in the Prophet being their God so now they were sending the quotation to their daughter you know in France no take this read and understand take this video and this so now that's kind of manuals have you know travel you would know my parents they are just sending me things here you know some quotations you know and telling me that something strange you know and I if you remember one question also she gave me that where it's rotating that as God has changed his name to the ages it was a question that was asked to do the perfect I remember like don't need a disposition as God as change his name and the professor yeah God has changed his name but all those name was referred to one single name the Lord Jesus Christ so now that part was not sent to their daughter just a question does God as change his name do need a disposition and the answer was yes God has chain name and that spot was referred to them no now God is happy and a name calling the Prophet but down which don't wear the professor all those name which of a jury and with your father vanished he was referred to one person the Lord Jesus Christ now you have to bring that out explain to someone but very slowly because that plane also fell in that's Daughtry why because it was something from the parrot and I don't know if she could be that strong to to stand against something that came out in your house that was something hard but if you have a stand on God if you have your faith on the Word of God wherever where any daughter he comes out you must check that with the world with the Bible so those are like the Daughtry in competition I faced and I read a lot a lot that period end is knowing that period I wrote I read a lot of the messages and I found out know God is working to the Prophet with our honor also know their part for the experience now those know was a time I guess that was 2000 16 or 15 I guess that was 16 I was praying too much not too much just praying a lot I was praying a lot in a certain way that I was so consecrate to God very very consecrated to God and I was like having so many dreams happening like every day he's were like something you know strange and it's a mechanic's normal for me so that was just God like he wanted to relive to reveal himself to me and I went out read about how the Prophet was doing about the vision on it and I found out God can show a dream first of all - oh no secondly to show his is mighty you know his greatness to you and totally just to show you maybe someone else just to warm someone else so those are the type of of dreams that I had during that time and it was something like strange for me and like the Prophet was saying that a dream from God was not surprised like to be ten minutes something like one second or two second but you you you get the full meaning that was a few strange after read from the Prophet in I had a dream just for two second and I remember every single step in that dream so those are the things that's happened to me I can call as God experienced the first dream I dream I dream first of all in my dream that was I don't know June 2016 and I was in a class if our friends and our lecturer who was supposed to who passed two by two so it got me in a dream I was me with a late no John you still referred a lady you to to to to to that's what just a dreaming and also a place where we used to go and do our laboratory staff of you know coding it and stuff like that then after 2 or 3 days in that class with the same lecture it was now something I have to wait now to to be like he will know to me and after just after the lesson yes or no I'm going to group you to to to I was ok here we are so let me wait and see if my dream come true and then he got me with a man I was that dream was just like that - Dennis - no no no no no John go with that lady I will be I was like wow wow this is a major me that's again and it was something happening in reality now just showing you just got water to show you how great he hates how great he can do things to you and it's also one dream that that gum was warning me about something about something you know in a school we used to send up our computer before you go in and out so it was something like you know so lazy to grandson I carry your computer it's yours and I was not signing something I was just I go back I was just coming out going and I hope God was seeing me and God didn't like that I had a dream now where someone from the security guard catching hey John did you sign your computer you know in that dream I felt affairs so horrible afraid so a shame of me my gosh I should have signed my computer but I didn't so you would know what challenge then one day also I will just do the same thing the next day same thing and one day the same guy from the security guard got me John see your signature here did you say your computer I feel so bad God warned me but I didn't want to listen and I was cautious no you shall son you computer here is no as I was in my first by the same way I fell imagine so that was paying me up like God can sure things just to warn you just to warn you to know doing that oh oh this will happen and I didn't like her for that way of my dream so from there I was now standing careful of what I was dreaming now I was now taking care of every single thing because like in a Bible say in Joette 228 no God will pour out his Spirit upon the young man upon the hard path on the we have vision they were Satan dreams and and those things those thing must come out like they must happening like now why because we need to go in a certain age in a bread age where we need to habitat pool and what is the third pole now is having our testimony happening living a testimony now I remember is a brother from France a friend of mine saw he was having some some bad situation he didn't have cash to to pay his rent and stuff and after church he went up to his past I guess not to just to pray for him okay if I just pray for him that were went home and it was pretty pretty pretty good I just need to get out of this situation I just want to get out of this situation and if you like some other store you not to get a half log and write the rates and put on his table they were just did a trench in an empty envelope and put out on his table he were about to sleep in the morning he will cut in front gosh some cash in that envelope can you imagine it's something that was like it's it has happened I was not seen oh god it's working now the third pole is starting working instead of us it just want us to get ready now to do something to say something I was wow wow really yeah he took some cash in that empty envelope he just wrote a range and you saw 900 euros something like that I was WOW God is working now we are close to to do something we are close to the rapture no they are certainty does must happen we must now get ready to to have that faith that we will bring us to do the the miracles the third port we have to do this before the rapture and the only time we can do it see when we are life now that's the only time it can do this does the only term that God can help us to to like to have something that we will share with brothers who went before us we cannot just go in heaven and having a fee to share no we need to share something with the angel telling them how God was working with you I remember her knock will have a great testimony say how he was working with God and God took him in heaven he we testified we also need to test fighter what God is doing in our life every day is a testimony for a Christian if you have never even have a book of writing at this minute buy a book right so you can remember and and see how blessed singer is how great God is we must have something to testify in heaven testify here before men not just in church even at work in school we must destroy that this ferret and that's the only way we can overcome the devil he doesn't like you this funny goes word because he knew he will be defeated by that word Amen that's why he creates something in our schooling being a shame of this fine because he knew that that's what Paul says something I will not be ashamed even they will say I will not be ashamed this is not by mistake they say that because there is something close to a testimony called being ashamed like you must be shy to not say what God did to you now the devil will be happy okay he cannot say that is you know he is a shame you know it no you can't say that that's the devil but once you open all your mouth and you say something God's Word through your testimony the devil is defeated he's defeated also there is a dream I dreamed that was just in school I remember I was supposed to see someone and he might dream that person was wearing a white shirt and I was supposed to go to talk to him about something and he also suffered supposed to reply to me something that was where I dreams actually now I was waiting for that day to go ahead and see that person I was waiting the day I was passing I see red shades Anna is not today I was working and I see green tissue as you know is not a day that I'm going to talk to him I'm going to talk to me the day he will be on a white shirt yeah I was very for that time and that time I was also having some you know some troubles and I was not supposed to go in talk to him and then I show me an owner why should i Walker this could be the day I went there he was closing his office I was okay like you know I don't know if this really fair or not but then it will like you he was having like a line with some people trying to so that the issue with just the I would seek a human I will seek and I was having a friend so John let's just go you know even tomorrow you can't pass this you know I cannot go back to it is today I'm going to see him I waited I waited I waited for solo then I saw him I approached him he told me the exact thing he's saying in my dream so that was the things that God will show you me in the past God was showing me this thing it was rough dreams happening it was something strange to me I was supposed like like like every day I was having dreams one day I had a dream of a friend he will come and get his computer to my friends neighbours place here and the day the guy came and asked for his computer I was just the quiet you know it was something beautiful and strange if you are experiencing something we've got God will reveal himself to you why God was he really accept me because I was so consecrated to him I was even going like on a brush with my guitar just singing a praying go away from my place singing a praying in a broach singing a brain I went home just another atmosphere God atmosphere tapes playing everything was just good that time and it was something that I will never never forget and I remember this song that I was singing every day with those away it's upon the Lord shall renew their strength the ceremony we like a hero I was think that every day because I want a god to relieve like to reveal himself to me I was ready to have a personal experience we've got not something for my parents not something from outside but something personal something partial where you can stand no one will shake you that yeah no one will show you that something can happen here I don't know I keep taking just play if one we see but for you is a personal testimony right but all of us we saw the guitar playing itself but to you it's something personal you can stand if any what you saw what you believe not know you know is that this me well all of us we saw that note to you is passion God what do you special it's not something you know all of us wish to believe this you know no to you is something direct it's personal to you that's how God's Word it just it has to become such a personal to in a certain way even if the devil come you must say it because you believe God did something to you not thinking but you knew that God we also defend the next obstacle in your life and it has to become another testimony you put out in your train like I've said before it is like a wagon you are driving with now if you can't stop you know because your word of your testimony is so powerful also there is something here just some going close they also something here we had a fellowship when I was in school in a university with our brothers from you know Jessie in a message we need to like we used to listen to the Prophet it's Friday it's Friday we must have a place I don't know someone's house we play the Prophet this you know we sang we pray we were having at each Friday since 2015 we start until 2018 it's ready when the world like on Friday weekend they must go out having parties I was on Friday was a blessing day where we can play music sing listen to the Prophet having great time it's also the only way to to to fight the devil when you are so near by good people who can lead you also true God that's where now I started like a writing songs singing praying going up in my foresters I remember anything twice I only sing twice that was since 2000 I don't know 10 sat in a diet yeah 10 or something like 10 or 12 or even only twice one was 10 here and when I was playing if you're dancing only twice but now when my father I dunno you are seeing how you can repeat ah how you know they never knew me in that way God Himself to me in a strange way now when they heard me like pitching in school if some friends is preaching because great how did he know anything about who I will become but God knew that and he put me in a certain position on world we have to defend God's Word where I need to stand against the fast dog train that was not so easy someone within your reach in this cottage in this quotation didn't understand I was no no I'm going to read the all message I just want to get that part and put in my head this part put put put in my head and you be you know I just get confused at all then but um you know it's God you see here I'm not your brother you said yeah now he's God you say no no the whole message understand what was happening exactly he will say no sometimes you know I'm Joshua I hear he's God no working here is God's presence here is the same yesterday and forever now you have to defend that you must now be careful against all the doctrines that that's the thing happening in Africa we have so many many doctrines but only few people stay know God's Word I remember my father when he came in Kenya last year he was telling me son you know what we are in a broad gauge age we are on a brandade if you are still the same age sorry for you I was how now he was that they explained to me that we are somewhere else we are not where we used to be like missing here God still moves to the edges from Paul to William brother God is moving now from wheeler Burnham is up to the rapture God we still moving we're gonna just stop somewhere no we cannot stop girls move it was Timmy you know now we are on a brad hitch and our soul is already ruptured I was okay like now it's yeah you say I since the foundation we were sealed before the foundation our so was robbed before the foundation we are just like in a mood where God is watching you what he did God is just watching us you know moving like what we are doing now it has happened no time ago before the foundation and God knew it he said no son we are on abroad 8 now and when I came here the process of switching that and last week was watching a preaching from someone Kenya he was saying that we are not blood a choice you know now some people they are you know now they are they became too close to the truth now they are now starting preaching that everywhere we are now brat eh yeah God has his people everywhere now we are connected through the spirit of god I've never knew that but uh our posture here we preach that one day I would never do that I came in and he said I was well that's true and I would some or some way pastor was preaching that we are on abroad hate soon we are going to get raptured see now yeah something is happening but there are some people does this sleepy there's this sleeping in the world sleeping and fighting I get that they don't change or stuff but God's Word is moving and the rapture will be something like nothing will happen like in a war you know it's just been no more just normal thing no me and the church will still be hoping people we still go to church career a viable preachy also the gospel but rapture has already take place that was all I passed through through through my life and he brought me in a certain place where I cannot be shaken anymore you cannot be shaking anymore and you you you cannot get blind anymore because you have your promises here no one we will tell you something out of this Bible if there is something out of this bubble so it's not kind of a chemical for the Bible put that away those are not the connecting I I face I was studying facing them now telling the truth about a message leave another message standing on a message now preaching to them them what they're doing is a scene yeah and those are the thing I face on my life and I remember one day also I was not screeching you know because we we wish to have a place where I used to exhort so many times in school I was calling them we will make so many religion it was having that's heart of tell them the truth today they what they are doing is known the truth being a Catholic will not save you being a producer will not save you is God who save now you must know God's path pathway now you must know know God's pathway now you would be Bible say God has never done anything without saying something to the Prophet I will study them now we must find out who's the Prophet now who is the prophet listen no we know the Prophet program you know he was a great teacher but I said bad word but no he in profit of nation yes a yeah a perfect of the nation I say yeah you must say that showing them in a Bible Malachi 4:5 6 has already happened yeah there is nothing out to wait if they don't believe just bring grace to them you move don't stay there for see them to see them no just say one word and move and that one will be taken to the judgment yes everyone must be judged because of what is a heart like what as heart before a car if someone came and and like on a judgment throne and that person has has never heard God's word God cannot judge him he will be judged based on what God's Word that's why there they must hear this word everywhere if they don't believe that it's okay just progressed to they may move on here's what I did with my friends I I all of them but I just progressed to their main path I had one friend one day I was at my place midnight came Jojo John you know wait for me man okay for life no smoking man no smoking I don't know why like smoking in my life become something like no more you my life every day I was just looking at EMC I don't I don't know there's nothing there they just like hair just smoke but I don't know where I'm so addicted to this end I was just there looking at you know just pray you know just pray but I just pretty much just pretty good help you out use if you try like pushing yourself to do that you will fail again I really I was not pushed to care for him no I was not pushed to pray for him you know sometimes you must worry God's Spirit you know Sammy just came in Tina I know you start seeing have your hands on him no I just know you know just pray I will pray for you I just be I was just thinking and when he went back oh no big I was high he said no it was already was high you see no he doesn't even know what he was saying and you must not know why the guy is saying this and last time I told him so no John I stopped smoking okay that does good and last week I asked me oh man I forget I'm smoking again you see now there are things people are so bound to that and they cannot even get away from them I had a friend who who were drink a very drinker and sometimes he came at John I don't know why am i drinking man it's just you say uh last night I I had I don't know five Botero ford racing I drove the way I was just asking myself why am i drinking and I had two days without drinking now today I went I can't buy some drinks and I don't understand there are people who they are captive but as God as the river has to see the truth now now we must stand on the truth we must you know what God's God's Word now until we go to the rapture there is nothing left for us there's nothing left for us what we just need to do came to keep our stand on God's Word not to be shaking anymore keep our stand to the world and we will go one day we will go one day heaven is for real now happy is free sometimes like imagination you know after death no ever is real is real why is it we because our profile window and came back and tourists that is Israel one day we were so good I mean god bless you for this thank you so much have you say the time does I guess I know MA they also one dream I remember that that was on no this one that's happy right now like I'm saying to the first eyes his is coming here I saw this on a dream that's was two weeks ago that's standing somewhere and I told the pastor you know yesterday you know it's good way were God's way of showing you that you know and I saw this happen like for me is a big kiss to me it's something that just dreamed but now I can see that in a real time now and I really think I forgot thank you so much may God bless you amen I didn't time him but again I can't comment on all he said no more than I could comment on all that brother Weiser said we think it would take me another couple of hours and I don't think we would need that right now or want it serviced are that not at seven but did you say that we take God for our brothers testimony of the grace of God it is Grace every one of us if we ever get up and testify we testify of grace a man is not me is not you is thinking that we're we're smart or anything like that no no it's the grace of God what I know I know by grace what I can do I do by the grace of God amen amen the life you live you you you live by the grace of God because there's our brother brought it we do it we do have an enemy and that's the devil now and he's there and I would like to comment on some some of the things I've rather mentioned first of all I as our brother was standing here I said is this brother John and because I said who is it and I don't know if this other Saints here knew it or not but he looks like brother Macondo Sun died you know I see my eyes them as soon died I said where's John - so they of course hakuna tai-kun dies from africa - but not put not from kenya not from congo so we thank the Lord for our brothers testimony of grace brother and it was as the finish dear tonight it was fulfilling his dream that he had that he dreamed that he was standing in a pulpit and he wasn't sure exactly what pulpit it was but then he ends up in this pulpit right here so this the grace of God not necessarily warning our brother but just informing our brother what was to come and now God fulfilled it and and he made some thoughts there and I made these notes regarding we overcome Satan or there was tremendous the scripture that he read it was it was a blessing and he read revelation 11 or 12 rather and verse 11 but just let me read just as verses before that and it says and there was war in heaven a man thank God for our brothers testimony bringing us back to the word and bringing us back to what God is doing as done and what God is doing amen and there was a war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels brothers he that they had they got a war there we got a war here amen just understand don't don't think because you're a Christian that you're that you don't have anything to do with the devil he's going to be on your heels a lot more a man now that now that you're you're going in a different direction a man and it says and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that all serpent a man thank God for the victory that our brother John got over the enemy because they were Satan Satan was there to try to influence his life as it was there to influence your life and mine a man but God gives the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ we've really got to come into that relationship with Christ we got to come into that experience a man where Jesus becomes the lord of our lives a man and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and it says and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ amen grace in our Lord Jesus Christ the god brother God at grace God has Grace and it's all revealed through the Lord Jesus Christ amen if he's a testimony God was made flesh in Jesus to testify of his grace to manifest His grace to reveal His grace in you and in me amen now has come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of is Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night Alleluia we got the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ over the devil amen praise the Lord and they overcame him this was the verse that our brother read and they overcame him that I want you to notice this praise the Lord just let it be a revelation of hearts brother a reality and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb don't stop there it's right don't stop there as I said they say say with my great were saved don't stop there but many do they say we're saved by grace weird no no we're saved by grace through faith a mayor so it's not just grace grace brings us a faith of Revelation and were challenged to believe it or not to believe it a man God wants us to believe it the devil is there to make us not believe it but it's by grace through faith and notice right here this verse 11 again that our brother John highlighted and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb that's all no a man it goes further than that and by the word of their testimony hallelujah you got a you got a testimony of faith in the finished work of Calvary you got a testimony of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ that he is our Lord is our Savior a man again as I said before I was testifying to a Pentecostal brother and I said listen I said they want to know Jesus as their Savior but they don't want to miss their Lord always I never heard that before but he said that's right and that's the truth they'll acknowledge what Jesus is my Savior Jesus is my Savior but give them the word as I as our brother was challenged they even in his testimony to give the witness to others a man it was challenging them to to see if he was going to be Lord of their lives he was becoming Lord of our brother John's life a man not just to believe but now to now to let him control then let him em add the leadership in his life the control in his life the lordship of his life by the grace of God a man this is our brothers testimony being the son of a pastor and so on you're going from from just just you know just intellectually believing this intellectually identifying with the message and they'll actually identifying with Jesus and the word - to a personal relationship with Jesus a personal relationship with the word to worry because not just your savior he's your Lord a man is not now just believing now all Jesus did this for me thank you Jesus and go on no no now you accept them as your Lord and Savior a man not just as your Savior but come on does it easy your Lord are you doing what you do today and what you do we'll do tomorrow and it's not you but it's Christ in you a man it your your going forth in a life that's that's revealing the lordship of God a man that is Christ in you the hope of glory it's Christ in control it's crazy eating you it's Christ and in control of what you do what you do when you do where you do it this is this is good I noticed this one after our brother read it I said Lord I said it's not just the blood of the Lamb but it is the word of their testimony a man and what is the word of the testimony it's a confession of your faith it's an acknowledgment of faith praise the Lord because without faith you really wouldn't have a real testimony a man but if you got faith you got a real testimony amen I've saved by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen this believe it this confess it this quote and live it I like he brought that out too it's walking in it it's not coming into the light it's walking in the light a man as I said not getting in the spirit is walking in the spirit by the grace of God many King as the prophet of God who warned us he said you can you can have the anointing on you 24 hours a day said go to hell that's right but he see if is not in your heart it's got to be in your heart in your soul the Lord of your life a man and this is our brothers testimony is is God dealing with our brother to bring him to that place where Christ becomes the Lord of his life amen as a witness to his fat his family his friends and his neighbors praise the Lord and it says by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death praise the Lord so they laid down their lives and they died to themselves is not dying just naturally but as duh is dying to yourself spiritually amen so it's not you that lives this Christ that liveth in you it's not brother John that's living hallelujah and singing and play the guitar and the piano ready the hymns is Christ in him praise the name of the Lord hallelujah thank God brother so we overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of your testimony because you're going to test it your testimony is faith in God faith in the finished work of Calvary get thee behind me Satan a man for I I have I have power over all the power of the enemy Jesus gave his power over all the power of the devil a man god help us to have that faith that testimony and brother our brother brought out concerning his you know just his parents especially as as the son of a pastor and so on he's just going along with your parents and brother with sometimes you can fight but God would find that you were compromised but he went from the fear of his parents to the fear of God I trust you cut that a man so it wasn't just well I'm all right because my daddy is a pastor I'm all white all right because because I met a Christian family no you got to have a Christian experience a man and God we're dealing with our brother John and he brought our brother John to that place hallelujah and that's why he has the testimony that he had tonight hallelujah thank God I was raised in a Christian home oh yeah we as if is a big family nine children but I tell you this every Sunday we were in church we went to church Sunday morning we come home at our dinner we went to went back for Sunday school in the afternoon then we come back and at our suburb and went to church again for Sunday night amen and brother as I said the services were and went on to eleven twelve o'clock at night what yeah that was that was the old-fashioned Salvation Army and was even the old-fashioned Pentecost oh yeah praise the Lord to get into the spirit and and you that's one thing you didn't notice with the clock of course they never had clocks in a church back then no no no we were out of time and into eternity by the grace of God yeah and we sing and praise the Lord and they get up around the altar oh yeah if maybe sinners would come up and then then you'll find Christians coming up and standing around the altar singing right over there hands raised praise the Lord hallelujah saying same thing and of course sometimes whether it's our salvation army or Pentecost they would have those Jericho marches in the church yeah elevational off they never jury film artistic and they sing in the SA and march around the building oh yeah because they would go down the seats on the end there go back to go to enter the vestibule or the porch and they come in on the other side keep on going singing and praising the Lord oh yeah experience that in Hindi are the old fashioned Salvation Army and in Pentecost brother we come under the fear of God and the love of God by the grace of God through Christ everybody just it you you it's just the anointing of the Holy Ghost in you and you want to praise the Lord yeah but now we know that the Holy Ghost the Spirit is leaving it smooth it's moving away in more and more and more from the world but brother that's the rapture that is as our brother John broto concerning the rapture and the bride age because the anointing this the anointing is has moved away from the church ages and now it's in the bride to get them right out of here by grace god help us brother amen so our brother went from as it were just a fear of his parents and just going by what they wanted him to do tell he entered into an experience with God and now it wasn't what his parents was telling him it was what God was telling him he was following the leadership of the Holy Ghost in his heart and soul praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and our brother I I thought I said lord I see he's not testifying he's preacher yes Alleluia a man so and the grace of God to help us to good and he said confess your faith by the life you live that's true it's not just going to taught you can talk to people but what about living it go to live it because they can hear you say one thing and becae you live another so the grace of God that that we're going to go and live our testimony we're going to walk the talk by the grace of God amen and I like what he brought out concerning God created man and God works through me that's good amen that's that's a revelation as the tested us of absolutely amazing isn't it it's a revelation all right yeah because God God created man and then ever since he created man God's been working through me amen thank God for that and he also brought Oh concerning the devil identifying with the message well there's a scripture that I was going to read and I didn't but I will and it's in Ezekiel chapter 17 and it concerns two Eagles there's the there's the godly eagle and there's the devil's eagle a male there's the true eagle and there's a false one a male one is going to be a blessing to us and the other one accursed so we better make sure that we have focused on God's Eagle a man because Ezekiel is speaking about the planning of this of the plenty of that and his and his towards God's Eagle and it is to grow up and grow up and grow up to this to this eagle but it says it turned to the other eagle and it withered and died it's amazing all we we we thank God for oh yeah the revelation of Eagles Eagles Eagles there's a there's a radial and is it just a wrong eagle that's the truth so brother god help us he's my prayer turn with me to Ezekiel chapter 17 and with exec you're 17 and verse one appreciate what our brother emphasized concerning God bringing us into the bride age and that's the age of the spoken word brother bound preach the message called why cry speak speak the word it's not you and your parents it's not you and your friends it's not you and other believers it's you and Jesus it comes down to that personal relationship with him and that brings you into a right relationship with your parents a right relationship with your friends a right relationship with other believers but you've got to start with Jesus amen and that's what God was dealing with in our brother John's life amen to bring him into that personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ in Ezekiel chapter 17 he speaks of the parable of the great eagle and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man put forth a riddle and speak a parable unto the house of Israel and say thus saith the Lord God a great Eagle with great wings long winged full of feathers which had divers colors came unto Lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar and he cropped off the top of his young twigs and carried it into a land of traffic and he said it in a city of merchants and he took also of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful he planted he placed it by great waters and said it as the willow tree and it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature whose branches turned toward him turned toward the great eagle and the roots thereof were under him so it became a vine and brought forth branches and shot forth Springs a man it was bringing forth what God intended for it to bring forth but verse seven says there was also another great eel with great wings and many feathers and be old his vine did bender roots to ward him and shot for their branches toward him that he might water it by the force of her plantation it was planted in a good soil by great waters that it might bring forth branches that it might bear fruit that it might be a goodly vine say though the Slayer of the Lord God shall it prosper because it changed its direction shall he not pull up the roots thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that it wither it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring even without great power so many people to pluck it up by the roots there all may be all being planet shall it prosper shall it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it it shall wither in the furrows where it grew we better make sure that we're facing the great Eagle of God a man not the devil we want God and God is looking for what we're looking for us to grow and mature and bring forth the bright bring forth the leaves and bring forth the fruit there are remain and this this is also confirmed by the by the parables that Jesus brought forth a man in Matthew 13 he brings four parables that type every church age amen and he talks about the planning of this and the plenty of that and he said and one brought forth note and they didn't bring forth no fruit why because it was plucked up it was changed and there are stairs believers today that are not bringing forth the fruit of the bright the the seed of the bride they're not bringing forth they did the likeness of the bride why because they're under under a false anointing see that brother God's in the word God's in the message but the Devils there too brother God was in the Garden of Eden but so was the devil amen all down true the man has had to deal with with with the Lord and he's also had to deal with the devil and it's been by the permissive will of God God has permitted it for a reason to bring out the true seed and the false seed they mean I trust by the grace of God that even in this assembly there's there's God and there's the devil amen oh yeah the first as the prophet of God has said and others have said the first one in church is the devil oh yeah he's here to distract us he's here to - it to interpret the word to us but God let let us let us recognize the devil rebuke him plead the blood against blood of Jesus against the devil amen let's stay with the Lord so we're going to have the right revelation of the word by the grace of God amen so I pray the grace of God that our brother John's testimony was a blessing to us a man and encouragement to us a man that that we have we we've been we've learned something God has taught us amen to be on our guard by the grace of God amen so brother our brothers on his guard even though he's the son of a pastor that makes no difference you could and like it like a lot of those like those here today that were so-called born in the message but was the message born in you there's many born in the message raised in the message but you have to add to the experience of the message being born in you is you got to let it have control to bring you to the new birth and that's why God had to do with our brother John because he was maybe born in the message born in in in under the ministry of a pastor and so on but he had he had to come to the place where the message had to be born in him and he had to be born by the Word of God amen and be and go forth him and bring forth email yeah grow up produce branches produce leaves but then you got to go on and produce fruit you got to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit the fruit of the revealed word for this hour and for this age amen God's God God's grace to us Lord bless you amen this make sure again we're under the right eagle in the message the indictment 1963 July the prophet of God says see what this nation is done that's what this people has done that's what these churches has done he said they have turned it down and they have crucified the message they have crucified the truth to the people and how did they do Jesus they put him to shame yeah they put Jesus to shame yeah they stripped his clothes off him on the cross he was naked they stripped his clothes off him and they hung him upon a cross and nailed him up there the prince of life and he said the same thing they've done today with their Creed's they'd done the same thing they've stripped the things and he said the goodness and the clothing of the gospel by trying to place it somewhere else and they've owned him on a cross and he said what did they do he said today he said man he said walk ignorant Lee and they don't know that's the truth they think it's some kind of ism and he said they don't dig down deep enough he said to get into the spirit of Revelation a man God's grace that we are into the Spirit of the revelation of what our brother John was ministering on and has said they don't pray enough they don't call upon God he know a man our brother was talking about it that he he was praying a lot a man but the prophet of God said in this hour that they don't pray enough and they don't call upon God enough and he said they just lately take it oh well I believe it's God sure the devil believes the same thing the devil believes it more than some people claim to believe it and he said the devil believes it and trembles but he said people just believe it and go on but he said the devil trembles knowing his judgment is coming amen that's why the enemy has against the true believers amen yet they're taking they're staying our brother John bought that out - taking their stand for the truth for the Word of God a man because the devil knows you're going to judge him amen and the people just believe it today so they go on but the devil trembles knowing his judgment is coming and the people believe it and don't pay no attention to the judgment that is coming god Elvis is my prayer grace brother sister that we're going to keep the right attitude and the right spirit and we're going to keep diggin into the word amen I believe our brother Visal testimony our brother John's testimony is helping us to dig more more into the truth of what God has done and what God is doing it this is the end it is the end of all things and really truly honestly we have gone out of the church ages into the bright age we are brothers sister I pray that we're not going to miss it as our brother was emphasizing we're not going to miss the revelation of the rapture don't let this the the things of this world and of this of your natural life get up get us away from the revelation of the rapture what God is doing in us by his word a man but the world today most today and even a lot of believers today are so caught up with the natural things of life that they're they're not as conscious as they should be of the spiritual right rather I pray that grace by grace we're looking to the resurrection in the rapture every day that every day were conscious this is the end that every day I trust that way that we're going to be praying Lord don't leave me behind we don't want as brother John warned again we don't want to be among those that that will be looking for a rapture and it's past where the scripture says it's already happened and you didn't know it didn't know it it's because they ignored it but God brother has already confirmed us through the opening of the word through what he has done in these last days it's a confirmation of the end it's a confirmation of the bride age it's a confirmation that the rapture is on amen oh yeah the redemption of our souls was already in progress in the Ministry of Jesus oh yeah so now the redemption of our bodies is already in progress amen sure the Ministry of Christ and the bride god help us that we're not going to ignore it and just oh just that's it that's just God it's just a prophet it's just wooden Branum brother that's all past that's history but we got to get into the present tense revelation on what God is doing Amen god bless you listening amen let's sing Jesus Saves we have heard the joyful sound Jesus Saves amen spread the tidings all around Jesus Saves bear the news to every land claim
