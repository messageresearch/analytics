[16:36] requests and those
[16:37] those prayer requests are genuine
[16:39] very genuine and very important to each
[16:41] one of us
[16:43] i just think it's time to stop asking
[16:44] god to do something we should be
[16:46] thanking him for having done something
[16:48] and that is he's he's after meeting
[16:50] those needs right we sing it's already
[16:53] done
[16:54] and in the thoughts of god
[16:56] uh and in the plan of god the healing is
[16:58] already done brother brandon said all
[17:00] you do is accept it
[17:02] so let's start thanking god i mean i
[17:03] remember you know i reminded what
[17:05] brother random told the story about the
[17:07] man that was blind and
[17:09] and brother branham pronounced him here
[17:11] it took him three weeks
[17:13] before he jumped out of that barber's
[17:15] chair and ran down the street thanking
[17:16] god but he thanked god all through that
[17:18] period of time right and he confessed it
[17:21] that's what we start need to start doing
[17:23] right
[17:24] i mean you know
[17:25] i was just talking to the musicians and
[17:27] you know we were talking about sister
[17:28] laura collins right it was purpose for
[17:31] everything but we believe in the
[17:33] supernatural
[17:35] don't we i mean we're believers right
[17:37] we're god's children we believe in the
[17:38] supernatural
[17:40] i mean if he's here the supernatural is
[17:42] here
[17:43] let's start believing like that let's
[17:44] start giving thanks
[17:46] so we give thanks for

[1:03:03] the sea
[1:03:04] and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:03:07] but shall believe that those things
[1:03:09] which he saith shall come to pass
[1:03:12] amen he shall have
[1:03:15] whatsoever

[1:04:24] amen
[1:04:26] he shall have
[1:04:28] whatsoever he saith amen amen just think
[1:04:32] the fig tree that jesus cursed it did it
[1:04:35] amen
[1:04:37] it was destroyed the life was gone out
[1:04:39] of it even though amen if the straight

[1:05:40] and by the word we're condemned
[1:05:43] the bible says that that's right yeah

[1:05:51] complete belief amen amen no question no
[1:05:54] doubt because we believe god amen amen
[1:05:57] the lord help us is my prayer amen but

[1:06:30] promise amen whatever you believe that's
[1:06:32] it i'll do it amen by the grace of god

[1:07:26] is grace for that man oh yes most
[1:07:28] definitely

[1:07:37] looking at this person going down there
[1:07:38] and the way they were dressed and how
[1:07:39] they were doing this and that and and
[1:07:41] the and the lord said don't you do that

[1:07:48] i'll tell you this they're going to be
[1:07:50] outside the city

[1:08:07] amen we're going to call them to the
[1:08:09] word
[1:08:10] by the grace of god amen
[1:08:13] so he said when you stand praying
[1:08:15] forgive
[1:08:16] and if you have ought against any
[1:08:19] and it says that your father also which
[1:08:21] is in heaven may forgive you
[1:08:23] your trespasses
[1:08:26] amen verse 26
[1:08:28] but if you do not forgive
[1:08:31] neither will your father which is in
[1:08:32] heaven forgive your trespasses
[1:08:35] god bless this word you may be seated
[1:08:37] this is a tremendous
[1:08:40] testimony
[1:08:42] father brother but i'll tell you this if

[1:08:58] praying praying that god do it for that
[1:09:00] person that brother that sister amen
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:03] it might be family might be friends
[1:09:05] might be neighbors we leave it with god
[1:09:07] oh we're going to judge them we'll judge
[1:09:08] them later
[1:09:09] oh yeah but we leave it with the lord
[1:09:12] we'll judge them in another dimension by
[1:09:14] the grace of god so god help us brother
[1:09:16] say with the word
[1:09:18] and have the faith that comes by hearing
[1:09:21] the word
[1:09:22] amen faith oh it's a revelation oh
[1:09:25] brothers is greater than that
[1:09:27] because i believe that let me share some
[1:09:29] of this thought with you when it comes
[1:09:30] to faith
[1:09:31] oh it's a revelation all right oh yeah
[1:09:34] oh it's a revelation of the word
[1:09:36] what yeah but it's a revelation that
[1:09:38] controls
[1:09:40] it's a revelation that controls
[1:09:43] your thoughts
[1:09:44] it's a revelation that controls your
[1:09:46] words it's a revelation that controls
[1:09:48] your deeds
[1:09:50] amen it's basically it's a revelation
[1:09:52] that's controlling your actions and your
[1:09:54] reactions
[1:09:56] amen if you got that true genuine faith
[1:09:59] that pleases god you got that amen it's
[1:10:02] a faith that you have has got these
[1:10:04] characteristics the faith that you have
[1:10:07] has got you got these addi this attitude
[1:10:09] oh yes my brother because that faith is
[1:10:11] not there just to look down at somebody
[1:10:13] and condemn somebody no there goes you
[1:10:16] but for the grace of god

[1:11:24] neighbors and he was there with us and
[1:11:26] shoveling and there's no air snow there

[1:11:49] brother david was driving along to him
[1:11:51] amen but again i i just leave that with
[1:11:54] the lord because maybe the lord

[1:11:57] will bring up the witness that brother
[1:11:59] david was going to be
[1:12:00] amen to that gentleman
[1:12:02] so the grace of god be with us brother

[1:12:32] in your home in your church or at your
[1:12:34] job brother whatever it is it will con
[1:12:36] there he's going to control your
[1:12:38] thoughts your words and your dates and
[1:12:40] it's not you that lives is christ living
[1:12:42] in you amen

[1:12:55] and they were going around looking for
[1:12:56] this looking for that where is it where
[1:12:58] is this where is that and i remember
[1:12:59] that that one time one of the management

[1:13:02] where i was in in in that vehicle in
[1:13:04] that store there and i was sort of a
[1:13:08] management of a certain number of
[1:13:10] departments and he said

[1:13:20] you you you'll lead us to it
[1:13:23] oh
[1:13:25] they took it lately and i said don't
[1:13:26] worry about it move on okay
[1:13:29] and so just not just a few minutes after
[1:13:31] that they found it
[1:13:33] why i said right there
[1:13:35] oh he said there yeah check there and
[1:13:38] they said oh he said that's right you're
[1:13:40] right i said i told you

[1:14:10] grace of god i said he said amen and and
[1:14:13] then after that and number of times
[1:14:15] anything going on they would come and
[1:14:16] ask well what do you think of this what

[1:14:20] they sense that i was christian
[1:14:22] i was giving preeminence to god amen
[1:14:25] even in my job
[1:14:26] by the grace of almighty god amen so

[1:14:42] relationship with god into a
[1:14:44] relationship with christ amen brother i

[1:15:25] words of jesus and and the deeds of
[1:15:27] jesus the way jesus would do it amen so
[1:15:31] and again there are those that think

[1:15:34] jesus no you don't you got to live jesus
[1:15:37] amen he's not talking to you you can
[1:15:38] talk him but what about walking

[1:15:44] like the fact that you've got to walk
[1:15:45] jesus you're going to walk your
[1:15:47] christian life amen and it's not talking
[1:15:49] it it's walking it and amen and they'll
[1:15:53] see you acting this way they'll see you
[1:15:54] reacting this way that way they'll know
[1:15:57] what that person is different what makes
[1:15:59] them different
[1:16:00] amen
[1:16:02] oh yeah well they they
[1:16:05] as i said in where i worked there at
[1:16:07] those times and they go ask somebody
[1:16:09] else oh why is he so different well he's
[1:16:11] a christian he's a christian
[1:16:14] oh he's a christian
[1:16:16] they've wondered that why because they
[1:16:18] met many christians that weren't like it
[1:16:20] they met many so-called christians amen
[1:16:23] that didn't reflect jesus that way
[1:16:26] amen they're religious but not spiritual
[1:16:29] amen they're reflecting you know
[1:16:31] doctrines and theology reflecting this
[1:16:33] church and that church amen but that
[1:16:35] many is reflecting jesus
[1:16:37] not the bible believers association but
[1:16:39] jesus
[1:16:40] amen brother we're here to worship jesus
[1:16:43] we're here not to promote the bible
[1:16:45] believers association we're not here to
[1:16:47] promote this church or that church amen
[1:16:49] we're here to promote jesus
[1:16:51] amen praise the name of the lord brother
[1:16:54] all down through right from the
[1:16:55] beginning whether there is abel brother
[1:16:58] in genesis right down through
[1:17:00] to the end time believers brother what
[1:17:02] are we reflecting jesus
[1:17:04] by the grace of almighty god
[1:17:06] brother even in revelations oh my praise
[1:17:09] the lord the the emphasis is on jesus
[1:17:12] the emphasis is on god the emphasis on
[1:17:14] what god has done what god is doing amen
[1:17:17] and and and
[1:17:18] the effect that he's having in you and
[1:17:20] in me amen as he said right there in the
[1:17:23] book of revelation this is amazing he
[1:17:25] was testifying these things say surely i
[1:17:27] come quickly
[1:17:29] amen jesus
[1:17:31] and it says even so come lord jesus
[1:17:35] amen praise the name of the lord brother
[1:17:38] it begins with god giving the giving
[1:17:40] premise of god and it ends with god
[1:17:42] because why because brother in genesis
[1:17:44] man comes from eternity into time
[1:17:47] amen and now in revelation we're going
[1:17:50] from time back into eternity
[1:17:53] praise the name of the lord
[1:17:55] hallelujah because
[1:17:56] again this is where we come from no
[1:17:58] manners has ended up but he that came
[1:18:00] down even the son of man who is in
[1:18:02] heaven and brother he came down to
[1:18:04] redeem those others who are in heaven
[1:18:06] that your your theophanies are there
[1:18:08] amen you're amen yes your theologies are
[1:18:12] in heaven he came down to redeem every
[1:18:13] one of us amen so we're going to enter
[1:18:15] into a oneness with our theophany into a
[1:18:17] glorified condition
[1:18:19] amen exactly like jesus did amen he laid
[1:18:23] the body down he raised it up in a
[1:18:25] glorified condition
[1:18:26] amen and he said oh yeah he said and he
[1:18:30] ascended and we he promised the same
[1:18:31] thing to you and me
[1:18:33] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:18:36] and brother again not just a spiritual
[1:18:38] body but a real real real body
[1:18:41] oh yeah because when he appeared to the
[1:18:43] disciples and oh
[1:18:45] it's jesus yes he said
[1:18:47] and and of course judas or the other
[1:18:49] brother
[1:18:51] didn't believe it
[1:18:52] jesus jesus yes he said touch touch my
[1:18:54] hands
[1:18:56] the wounds in his hand touch my side
[1:18:59] where they put the sword in his side and
[1:19:00] so on and oh
[1:19:03] and he rolls up
[1:19:04] praise the name of the lord
[1:19:06] amen so brother sister god of us to have
[1:19:08] faith god help us to believe brother god
[1:19:11] he required it then if there's anything
[1:19:13] jesus was looking for when he came back
[1:19:14] from the dead it was faith
[1:19:17] brother it was faith before he went
[1:19:19] faith after he come back amen and his
[1:19:21] faith brother that he's looking for now
[1:19:23] but it's a real genuine holy ghost faith
[1:19:26] amen
[1:19:27] oh well and too often there's too many
[1:19:30] believers now they think oh the what is
[1:19:32] faith oh it's a revelation
[1:19:34] a revelation oh yeah
[1:19:38] god revealed this to us god revealed
[1:19:39] that to us and and that's what we
[1:19:41] believe that so that's our faith
[1:19:43] yeah but no it's it's life
[1:19:46] no no it's more than just revealing the
[1:19:48] word it's it's the person of the word

[1:20:04] faith amen
[1:20:06] that is the word made flesh

[1:20:14] this i believe that that's your faith
[1:20:15] that's my faith

[1:20:18] that controls your thoughts your words
[1:20:20] and your deeds

[1:20:25] inside of the inside brother that's

[1:22:48] definitely just too often you know with
[1:22:50] people there's believers that allow
[1:22:52] family or friends or neighbors to
[1:22:54] influence what they do and what they
[1:22:55] don't do you know and
[1:22:57] they're they're afraid to do this and no

[1:23:15] this christ living in me
[1:23:19] and it's christ's in you amen not just
[1:23:21] here in the church but brother out there
[1:23:24] outside the church is still christ

[1:23:28] christ is in our homes christ in us and
[1:23:30] are in our jobs amen
[1:23:33] brother in in in fellowshipping with
[1:23:35] family friends or neighbors amen it's
[1:23:38] still christ
[1:23:39] amen
[1:23:41] jesus wasn't going to be one thing to
[1:23:42] this one another thing to that one amen
[1:23:45] what he was to that one he was to them
[1:23:48] he was the word he was the word he was
[1:23:50] the word amen his attitude is spirit his
[1:23:52] motives objectives was the same
[1:23:55] amen what they saw this one scene
[1:23:58] well this one's seen they saw
[1:24:01] jesus
[1:24:02] who is he
[1:24:03] always he's to a lot of the people back
[1:24:05] in that day no doubt jesus well he's
[1:24:07] he's
[1:24:08] he's really religious
[1:24:10] no he was spiritual
[1:24:12] but if the colonel might think he's just
[1:24:14] religious
[1:24:15] no no
[1:24:16] but there are those that would recognize
[1:24:17] his spirituality
[1:24:19] he was spiritual with a right motive
[1:24:22] right objective
[1:24:23] amen he had right thoughts right words
[1:24:26] his action was right his reaction was
[1:24:28] right amen amen and brother is not just
[1:24:31] put on by religion
[1:24:34] just come out of his heart
[1:24:36] if his religion comes out of your head
[1:24:38] amen but it amen but if it's spiritual
[1:24:41] coming out of your heart brother
[1:24:43] you don't have to force it you don't
[1:24:44] have to say i got to do this no no no
[1:24:46] you just it's just nate not your nature
[1:24:48] now
[1:24:50] as i said when you're born naturally you
[1:24:53] go and do this gluten do that why
[1:24:55] because you're
[1:24:56] got the nature of your mother your
[1:24:57] father your grandmother grandfather all
[1:24:59] done through the ages god the nature of
[1:25:01] that person
[1:25:02] yeah
[1:25:04] but when you're born again you got a new
[1:25:06] nature
[1:25:07] and it controls from the heart not the
[1:25:09] head
[1:25:10] amen
[1:25:12] and brother branham one time when they
[1:25:14] brought a young boy or or child into the
[1:25:17] prayer line
[1:25:19] and they were wondering about this
[1:25:20] wondering about this this problem with
[1:25:22] the job this problem and the father god

[1:25:32] referring to her the mother or the
[1:25:34] father no no he said this came from
[1:25:37] grandparents
[1:25:39] and he went back he said it's the
[1:25:40] grandparents and he told who it was and
[1:25:43] so on and he said they passed that on
[1:25:45] the way down and she and i think she was

[1:32:26] and his attitude and so on and they felt
[1:32:28] that he

[1:40:58] pharaoh said who is the lord that i
[1:41:00] should obey his voice
[1:41:02] to let israel go yeah
[1:41:05] but by the time that god was finished
[1:41:06] with egypt pharaoh wished he had obeyed
[1:41:09] god
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:12] and by the time that god is finished
[1:41:14] with this world today they will wish
[1:41:16] that they had obeyed god
[1:41:18] but no
[1:41:20] they don't believe god
[1:41:22] know that god is now
[1:41:24] if you want to believe god that's fine
[1:41:25] but the world doesn't take it serious
[1:41:29] most in the world today is not really
[1:41:30] serious when it comes to their faith
[1:41:32] not serious when it comes to god
[1:41:35] no no
[1:41:36] they feel
[1:41:37] more more in general today they just
[1:41:39] feel all i got to do is believe in god
[1:41:42] you know no
[1:41:43] believe god
[1:41:44] and he believed what he says believe
[1:41:46] what he reveals
[1:41:48] in this day and in this hour
[1:41:50] why you got to believe what he's doing
[1:41:52] in your day
[1:41:53] because he's going to give you the you
[1:41:54] know it'll give you the faith that he
[1:41:56] wants you to have today
[1:42:00] amen not just the faith that they had in
[1:42:02] previous ages or they believe this they
[1:42:04] believe this is oh they believe god they
[1:42:06] believe god yeah

[1:42:09] faith in god what are you doing proving
[1:42:11] your faith in god what kind of life are
[1:42:13] you living proving your faith in god
[1:42:20] and sometimes the faith of god in you is
[1:42:22] going to make you do things that's
[1:42:23] totally contrary to religion
[1:42:27] and what the churches teach
[1:42:29] oh yeah

[1:42:34] so brother sister
[1:42:38] grace
[1:42:40] this world is believing god less and
[1:42:42] less and less and they're becoming less
[1:42:45] and less tolerant
[1:42:47] of christians
[1:42:49] and the christian life
[1:42:50] and that's why jesus said
[1:42:52] when the son of man comes will he find
[1:42:56] faith
[1:42:58] on the earth
[1:43:01] because
[1:43:03] the more and more powerful the world
[1:43:04] gets
[1:43:05] and the more and more influence the
[1:43:07] world has got on the people the less
[1:43:08] that they
[1:43:09] they're going to confess regarding jesus
[1:43:12] regarding the lord regarding the word
[1:43:15] no no
[1:43:17] they don't mind you being religious and
[1:43:18] going to a church
[1:43:21] but that's it when you leave the church
[1:43:23] you leave your religion there
[1:43:25] you know
[1:43:27] but the world is not impressed
[1:43:29] with everyday
[1:43:34] experience with god
[1:43:35] no
[1:43:38] they think they think it's something
[1:43:39] that you only
[1:43:41] exercise on a sunday or on a wednesday
[1:43:43] or when the church is doing this church
[1:43:45] you're doing that maybe on a christmas
[1:43:46] or an easter that's it
[1:43:48] amen
[1:43:49] god help us
[1:43:52] that we're going to be jesus every day
[1:43:57] reflect jesus every day
[1:44:01] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:44:05] so you're going to be the christian
[1:44:07] today the christian tomorrow the
[1:44:08] christian next day amen
[1:44:10] you're going to reflect jesus love jesus
[1:44:12] amen live the life of jesus
[1:44:15] every day
[1:44:17] give jesus preeminence
[1:44:19] every day
[1:44:21] this is the faith that pleases god
[1:44:24] amen
[1:44:28] brother
[1:44:31] i've thought about i said lord
[1:44:34] when is this going to be
[1:44:37] when the son of man comes
[1:44:39] well we believe he has come
[1:44:40] and he's revealed to the bride
[1:44:42] and there's an invisible union of the
[1:44:44] heavenly bridegroom in the earthly bride
[1:44:46] yes sir yeah amen and says will he find
[1:44:50] faith
[1:44:55] well true believers are experiencing
[1:44:57] less and less
[1:44:58] faith
[1:45:00] as
[1:45:01] more we go on
[1:45:03] the less faith we're seeing
[1:45:06] people are getting more and more yeah
[1:45:07] they can get more and more religious
[1:45:09] eating around the message
[1:45:11] but where's faith
[1:45:19] the bible says be all i set before you
[1:45:21] this day a blessing and a curse a
[1:45:23] blessing if you obey god's the
[1:45:25] commandment of the lord
[1:45:27] yes which i command you this day amen
[1:45:30] and a curse
[1:45:32] if you will not obey the commandments of
[1:45:34] the lord your god but turn aside out of
[1:45:36] the way which i command you this day go
[1:45:38] after other gods which ye have not known
[1:45:42] god help us
[1:45:45] faith without works
[1:45:50] is dead
[1:45:52] amen
[1:45:53] faith
[1:45:54] works only
[1:45:56] when the individual possesses a for
[1:45:59] forgiving spirit
[1:46:01] a right attitude and a right spirit
[1:46:03] amen
[1:46:05] faith
[1:46:06] is in action
[1:46:08] but if you don't have a forgiving spirit
[1:46:10] a forgiving attitude no
[1:46:13] you've got a dead faith
[1:46:15] because if you've got a living faith
[1:46:17] you've got a forgiving spirit
[1:46:19] you've got a living faith
[1:46:21] it's jesus christ in you
[1:46:25] and the attitude that he had you laugh
[1:46:28] amazing
[1:46:32] so do you have jesus attitude toward
[1:46:34] your brothers and sisters
[1:46:36] do you have jesus attitude
[1:46:40] the woman at the well
[1:46:42] oh
[1:46:44] the disciples never had the same
[1:46:45] attitude
[1:46:47] not until they got the holy ghost
[1:46:49] christ in them
[1:46:51] oh jesus went up to the well and and
[1:46:54] there was a time when when those women
[1:46:56] would go to the well and and that's
[1:46:58] that's the time when others the ordinary
[1:47:00] people wouldn't wouldn't go to the well
[1:47:01] they would wait till after another
[1:47:03] another time of the day
[1:47:05] or they look at you know what time is it
[1:47:08] oh we can't go to the well
[1:47:11] because
[1:47:12] the prostitutes are going to go there at
[1:47:13] this hour
[1:47:15] yeah they wouldn't go
[1:47:16] but jesus did
[1:47:18] amen
[1:47:20] oh the disciples didn't like it because
[1:47:21] he was talking to
[1:47:22] this woman
[1:47:24] praise the lord but oh hallelujah
[1:47:27] we just think
[1:47:30] she went and she she
[1:47:32] give her testimony she said come see a
[1:47:34] man
[1:47:35] who told me all i've done
[1:47:37] she said is not this the very messiah
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:42] so somewhere she must have been a
[1:47:44] predestinated seed
[1:47:45] jesus knew her amen and the other would
[1:47:48] have nothing to do with her so brother
[1:47:50] let's keep our attitude right in our
[1:47:51] spirit right
[1:47:53] yeah the disciples say oh lord what are
[1:47:55] you going over and talking with her for
[1:47:57] amen
[1:47:58] but thank god for the testimony she gave
[1:48:01] praise the name of the lord
[1:48:03] oh yeah the disciples would wouldn't do
[1:48:05] this wouldn't do that but jesus
[1:48:08] with the right attitude and right spirit
[1:48:10] he was he was encouraging him yes keep
[1:48:11] your attitude right amen that's right
[1:48:13] sister
[1:48:15] keep your attitude right
[1:48:18] do you have a right attitude
[1:48:21] do you have the right spirit
[1:48:26] toward your brothers and sisters
[1:48:29] in the faith
[1:48:31] family friends neighbors oh yeah
[1:48:34] keep your attitude right
[1:48:36] keep your spirit right
[1:48:38] even towards those that you're working
[1:48:39] with you go to school with
[1:48:42] yeah
[1:48:43] grace of god
[1:48:47] they'll recognize it
[1:48:52] and it's for the glory of god that i
[1:48:53] would give you the testimony of the
[1:48:55] experience that i had in attending
[1:48:57] school
[1:49:00] now
[1:49:03] again as i said
[1:49:04] one time in questions and the teacher
[1:49:06] was asking questions
[1:49:08] and
[1:49:09] what's your thoughts what's your
[1:49:11] thoughts what's your thoughts that he

[1:49:21] mr lush she said do you know he said
[1:49:23] you're going to be a judge
[1:49:26] i said
[1:49:27] no i said i don't know
[1:49:29] oh yes he said i think you'll be a judge
[1:49:32] because of the because how i
[1:49:34] answered the question
[1:49:36] and how i explained it
[1:49:38] and again at the same time
[1:49:40] when as i said and i can see it
[1:49:42] now in that school there and i and i can
[1:49:46] see that position see that time see the
[1:49:48] other students and see this the teacher
[1:49:50] that was there
[1:49:52] and he said to me he said excuse me mr
[1:49:54] lush
[1:49:56] he said do you know
[1:49:57] he said that you are going to be a
[1:49:59] pastor
[1:50:01] i said me
[1:50:03] yes
[1:50:04] yes i believe you're going to be a
[1:50:06] pastor oh i said i don't know
[1:50:08] i said well will the lord be done well
[1:50:10] he said good he said but i believe it
[1:50:13] i said okay
[1:50:14] and as i've said let me say it again but
[1:50:17] it was many many years later
[1:50:20] maybe 30 years later
[1:50:22] that i met him in the mall
[1:50:25] you know he came to me
[1:50:28] yeah
[1:50:30] i wanted to know
[1:50:31] what i was doing and i told him always
[1:50:33] that i knew i knew that he said
[1:50:36] yeah
[1:50:37] oh yeah and he's from a certain
[1:50:39] denominational church
[1:50:41] and again i was a witness to him then
[1:50:43] and even my witness struck him
[1:50:46] it really struck him because i could see
[1:50:49] that his countenance changed
[1:50:52] amen
[1:50:54] god knows
[1:50:56] grace
[1:51:00] brother
[1:51:01] the faith we begin with is the faith we
[1:51:03] end with
[1:51:06] the only thing is is the faith the faith
[1:51:08] matures and grows and gets stronger and
[1:51:10] stronger and stronger
[1:51:12] amen and with the more and more faith
[1:51:15] got what's god doing god's revealing
[1:51:17] more and more of the word
[1:51:18] he's giving you more and more revelation
[1:51:20] more and more understanding amen amen
[1:51:23] hallelujah and the more he gives you the
[1:51:25] more he can use you
[1:51:30] so i pray god
[1:51:32] that we're there for him to use us
[1:51:35] and again even our young brothers and
[1:51:37] sisters
[1:51:38] oh lord that you you will be a witness
[1:51:40] in school even as i was a witness in
[1:51:42] school
[1:51:45] oh yeah and not not talking a lot
[1:51:49] no no i didn't talk a lot not by any
[1:51:50] means
[1:51:52] no by any means
[1:51:54] as they approached me one time they were
[1:51:56] doing this doing this doing that and
[1:51:57] they said
[1:51:59] other students they said oh
[1:52:01] gerald
[1:52:02] they said
[1:52:03] you don't do very much and you're not
[1:52:05] involved in much but
[1:52:07] would you mind getting involved in this
[1:52:08] would you mind helping us with this they
[1:52:10] said we think we you should it should
[1:52:12] help us here
[1:52:14] because many times they would they would
[1:52:16] just leave because they knew that maybe
[1:52:18] in my faith i wouldn't do this wouldn't
[1:52:20] do that
[1:52:21] but there's things that they still
[1:52:22] believe that even though i had this
[1:52:24] faith they still believed i would help
[1:52:25] them
[1:52:26] i said okay amen
[1:52:29] yeah
[1:52:30] praise the lord
[1:52:33] i pray god make you that kind of a
[1:52:34] witness
[1:52:36] in school
[1:52:37] in your job
[1:52:39] you know in university whatever making
[1:52:42] that kind of a witness
[1:52:43] reflecting jesus
[1:52:45] amen
[1:52:46] so that they're going to not concede
[1:52:47] your nature your attitude your actions
[1:52:50] your reactions his jesus
[1:52:53] well they may not recognize it as jesus
[1:52:55] but they know you're different
[1:53:02] amen
[1:53:05] again
[1:53:06] understand the true faith of god that
[1:53:08] pleases god is a faith that possesses a
[1:53:10] forgiving spirit
[1:53:12] amen
[1:53:14] he forgave you and you forgive them
[1:53:18] oh yes
[1:53:20] as i've said
[1:53:22] to somebody on the phone i don't know
[1:53:23] who was
[1:53:25] my brother ed cater was talking to her
[1:53:27] some other brother here
[1:53:29] and i was saying brother
[1:53:31] i said when it comes to
[1:53:33] others

[1:53:37] that i said lord i said you forgive me
[1:53:39] you forgive them

[1:53:43] trust you'll give them
[1:53:45] amen and the grace is there to save me i
[1:53:48] said lord save that that that that
[1:53:50] person there

[1:53:56] criticize them and condemn them
[1:53:59] no just pray grace to them
[1:54:02] say again this is why the angel came to
[1:54:04] the prophet of god and said don't you
[1:54:06] have that attitude toward that person he
[1:54:08] said because he said some of them are my
[1:54:09] children
[1:54:10] and he said there goes you but for the
[1:54:12] grace of god

[1:56:07] a blessing if you obey the commandments
[1:56:10] of the lord

[1:56:19] amen and you turn aside to go after
[1:56:22] other gods well
[1:56:27] what are the other gods
[1:56:30] it could be your education
[1:56:32] it could be your job it could be your
[1:56:34] family it could be friends
[1:56:37] they become gods
[1:56:38] oh yeah
[1:56:43] i know situations even among believers
[1:56:46] we're unbelieving
[1:56:48] members of family
[1:56:50] are their gods
[1:56:52] they're more cut out with the
[1:56:53] unbelieving
[1:56:54] family members than they are with the
[1:56:56] believer believers
[1:57:00] they are
[1:57:02] there's many a believer out there like
[1:57:03] that
[1:57:04] oh i've met them many many many over the
[1:57:06] years
[1:57:09] but the true believers that i have had
[1:57:11] fellowship with over the years real true
[1:57:13] believers
[1:57:14] oh yeah they're just they're interested
[1:57:16] only in the family of god
[1:57:18] brothers and sisters in the faith
[1:57:20] oh they live for it the whole mind
[1:57:22] morning noon and night and you know
[1:57:24] that's they wanted to fellowship with
[1:57:25] them morning noon and night yeah family
[1:57:27] believers believers believers oh yes
[1:57:30] but now it's getting to the place where
[1:57:32] there's a lot of believers but they're
[1:57:33] just caught up with oh well we'll see
[1:57:35] you sunday or wednesday yeah and but
[1:57:39] in the meantime they're caught up with
[1:57:40] their natural family who are unbelievers
[1:57:45] and they're trying to justify
[1:57:49] natural family who are sinners
[1:57:54] i was shocked when a certain believer
[1:57:56] was
[1:57:58] i was talking to about certain issues
[1:58:00] and he oh he said brother he said i
[1:58:02] don't believe that's a sin anymore he
[1:58:04] says this is not saying that's not sin
[1:58:06] although his family
[1:58:09] many and his family were guilty of it
[1:58:11] but he said no no that's not sin he said
[1:58:13] because he said this isn't the bible
[1:58:14] doesn't it but but he's misinterpreting
[1:58:17] it to justify himself
[1:58:19] and to justify his family
[1:58:24] it's sick
[1:58:26] you see
[1:58:28] brother
[1:58:31] your spiritual family is more important
[1:58:32] than your natural
[1:58:34] amen
[1:58:35] oh yeah
[1:58:36] why because we come from eternity
[1:58:40] we now oh we get fellowship in time oh
[1:58:42] wonderful praise the lord
[1:58:45] we know them from eternity and we're
[1:58:46] going back to eternity
[1:58:49] the natural it's not the natural family
[1:58:52] no no no no
[1:58:55] not by any means come on let's get into
[1:58:57] the word and find the right attitude
[1:58:59] right spirit regarding your natural
[1:59:00] family
[1:59:02] you're there you're there to help them
[1:59:04] there to encourage them and there to be
[1:59:05] a witness for them amen
[1:59:07] the god that saved you saved will save
[1:59:09] them if they're predestinated
[1:59:12] but other than that
[1:59:14] well
[1:59:15] you treat them right treat them good and
[1:59:16] so on
[1:59:17] and but again give preemies to the
[1:59:19] spiritual not the natural
[1:59:22] grace
[1:59:25] grace
[1:59:29] as believers we are moved by faith we're
[1:59:32] controlled by faith
[1:59:34] not by sight or feelings or emotions not
[1:59:37] by any means
[1:59:38] we're controlled by spiritual
[1:59:40] revelations
[1:59:42] and as believers our actions and
[1:59:44] reactions are based on faith not sight
[1:59:47] feelings or emotions
[1:59:49] amen
[1:59:52] the bible says as thou faith
[1:59:55] have it to thyself before god
[1:59:58] happy is he that condemneth not himself
[2:00:01] in that e which
[2:00:02] in that thing which ye allow
[2:00:05] oh yeah
[2:00:07] and they're allowing a lot of things
[2:00:08] among natural families today
[2:00:11] you're gonna take your stand against it
[2:00:13] keep your attitude right in your spirit
[2:00:14] right but still let them know
[2:00:16] that you know we don't agree with this
[2:00:17] we don't agree with that and that we
[2:00:19] believe this is sin according to the
[2:00:20] bible but you leave the choice is theirs
[2:00:24] but you've got a choice too
[2:00:28] amen definitely
[2:00:31] so as he that doubteth is damn defeat
[2:00:34] because he is not of faith for
[2:00:36] whatsoever is not of faith is sin
[2:00:40] amazing
[2:00:45] whatever you do let it be according to
[2:00:47] the faith of the revelation of god or
[2:00:49] christ in you the hope of glory
[2:00:52] let's live
[2:00:53] we live by faith
[2:00:55] walk by faith if you're not going to
[2:00:57] live by faith
[2:00:59] you're living by sin
[2:01:01] unbelief
[2:01:02] doubt
[2:01:03] god help us
[2:01:07] remember that the outside man is
[2:01:09] controlled by
[2:01:10] its instincts of survival naturally
[2:01:14] feelings reasoning
[2:01:17] rationale
[2:01:19] and waits until it senses and declares
[2:01:21] this and then it moves and acts and
[2:01:23] reacts according to its feelings
[2:01:28] but if you're a christian you remove and
[2:01:29] act and react according to your faith
[2:01:32] amen faith controls you
[2:01:34] yeah

[2:01:42] as one time i said i met some natural
[2:01:44] family and one of them got really nasty
[2:01:47] with me
[2:01:49] because i spent so much time with
[2:01:51] certain ones there in the same town
[2:01:54] but they were believers
[2:01:56] and i would only just drop by natural
[2:01:58] family say hello to them and so on

[2:02:03] the
[2:02:05] individuals of the family natural got

[2:02:30] is this he does this and he's right in
[2:02:33] his attitude he's right in his spirit

[2:02:56] i pray that you you'll grant them the
[2:02:58] same anointing you gave me and lord it's

[2:03:25] according to what's revealed to us in
[2:03:27] our hearts
[2:03:28] living from the inside out and remember
[2:03:32] when it comes to what's on the inside of
[2:03:33] the inside and it's going to control
[2:03:35] your
[2:03:36] your actions and reactions it's not that
[2:03:38] you've got to force yourself to do it
[2:03:40] it's just
[2:03:41] it's just the nature
[2:03:43] but you've got the power and the
[2:03:44] anointing of the holy ghost there that's
[2:03:46] your nature now
[2:03:47] it's not the nature of mom and dad the
[2:03:49] old nature and the old anointing the old
[2:03:51] spirit no no that's that's gone
[2:03:53] and and the new nature's got control the
[2:03:55] holy ghost has got control now and so

[2:04:00] to god don't have to force you to do it
[2:04:02] it's just there
[2:04:04] you've been born again
[2:04:06] amen that's that's why god predestinated
[2:04:10] the new birth to be born again why
[2:04:13] why to overcome and control the old
[2:04:16] birth
[2:04:17] there's too many still governed by the
[2:04:20] nature of the the old birth
[2:04:22] i pray grace that the new birth takes
[2:04:24] control
[2:04:26] amen
[2:04:29] amen
[2:04:31] i could do some drawings here on the
[2:04:34] board i won't do that i've done
[2:04:36] before to show you the
[2:04:40] the nature of a man
[2:04:43] the old nature the new nature
[2:04:45] amen
[2:04:47] and to determine what's controlling you
[2:04:52] what nature is controlling you
[2:04:55] now
[2:04:57] what nature controls you when you go out
[2:04:59] of here
[2:05:00] what nature will control you tomorrow or
[2:05:02] at your job
[2:05:06] just the old family nature
[2:05:08] or the new nature of god
[2:05:11] the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:05:14] oh my
[2:05:16] are we
[2:05:17] born again
[2:05:22] if you're born again you're your new
[2:05:24] creature in christ
[2:05:26] you're born again
[2:05:29] oh yeah you're totally different
[2:05:32] in your thoughts your words and your
[2:05:33] deeds
[2:05:34] yeah
[2:05:36] oh yeah
[2:05:38] this
[2:05:41] brother you don't compare with the
[2:05:42] sinner no more
[2:05:45] no no sinners are going that's the way
[2:05:46] they were born naturally so they're
[2:05:48] going to go and live naturally
[2:05:50] but you're born spiritually
[2:05:53] and with the spiritual nature
[2:05:55] you know you're different now
[2:05:57] it's like one time the man went into the
[2:05:59] church
[2:06:00] and they made an altar call
[2:06:04] and there was this gentleman there
[2:06:07] on the on one side and on the other side
[2:06:08] was a sister
[2:06:10] and she was
[2:06:11] she had her hands raised and she was
[2:06:12] praising the lord
[2:06:14] and he knew her what she used to be
[2:06:17] but she was a new creature
[2:06:21] and he said lord
[2:06:23] he said would you make me like like her
[2:06:26] he said i want that new nature
[2:06:28] he said i want that new attitude a new
[2:06:30] spirit
[2:06:32] because she was totally different
[2:06:34] yeah
[2:06:38] and he got out of his when he made the
[2:06:40] altar go he went up
[2:06:41] to the altar praying lord i need that
[2:06:44] new nature
[2:06:46] change me
[2:06:48] amen brother sister so that when when
[2:06:51] when the life goes out of this body
[2:06:54] the nature's got to go into another body
[2:06:58] it's right there
[2:07:00] if you're born again
[2:07:02] you come in contact with your theophany
[2:07:03] body and as i've said the prophet said
[2:07:06] he said it's not 12 feet from you at any
[2:07:08] given time
[2:07:10] yeah
[2:07:11] and he said in times of you know you're
[2:07:13] you're you're tired and weary and warm
[2:07:15] and so on you see your theophany will
[2:07:16] draw near you to give you strength
[2:07:19] and encourage you
[2:07:21] amazing
[2:07:23] yeah
[2:07:23] oh that's the holy ghost yeah but again
[2:07:25] it's
[2:07:26] it's it's your it's your part of you
[2:07:28] that's in eternity
[2:07:30] amen and we're gonna and oh yeah during
[2:07:32] the resurrection he said the prophet
[2:07:34] said the dead and christ are going to
[2:07:35] rise first and the glorified bodies and
[2:07:38] they're going to appear to the living
[2:07:40] saints
[2:07:41] amen and he said then the living saints
[2:07:43] are going to come in contact with their
[2:07:44] theophany bodies and he said enter into
[2:07:46] a glorified body
[2:07:48] amen because he said in our theophany
[2:07:50] bodies he said we we can see each other
[2:07:52] we know each other we recognize each
[2:07:54] other but he said
[2:07:55] but we we can't touch one another
[2:07:58] he said because it's only a theophany
[2:07:59] bodies
[2:08:01] spirit bodies and so on he said we can
[2:08:04] fellowship
[2:08:05] and talk but not not touch but now he
[2:08:08] said in the resurrection we move into
[2:08:10] glorified bodies he said now we can
[2:08:12] shake hands
[2:08:13] and touch one another oh yeah
[2:08:16] so brother i pray the grace of god that
[2:08:18] you're the only body is not dwell feed
[2:08:20] from you now
[2:08:21] amen amen amen and it's waiting for you
[2:08:24] the prophet of god said when when the
[2:08:26] dead in christ rise and he's entering
[2:08:28] two glorified bodies then he said our
[2:08:29] theophany bodies comes and we enter into
[2:08:31] a glorified body
[2:08:33] we enter into that theophany into and is
[2:08:35] glorified by the grace of god and he
[2:08:37] said then oh yeah and we have fellowship
[2:08:41] he said we're going to fellowship he
[2:08:42] said oh yeah i think he mentioned it
[2:08:44] somewhere in 30 to 40 days when you're
[2:08:46] referring to time he just want to let
[2:08:48] you know that there's going to be a
[2:08:50] space there that we're going to
[2:08:52] fellowship with one another yeah and he
[2:08:54] said then we look up
[2:08:55] oh
[2:08:56] he said there's jesus
[2:08:58] amen we're going to go into this body
[2:09:01] and jesus is going to go into that
[2:09:03] that body as i said he's that gut next
[2:09:04] to the throne
[2:09:06] amen but he's down here in the form of
[2:09:08] the holy ghost in you in me in all of
[2:09:10] his seed gathering us together unto
[2:09:12] himself again and then he said during
[2:09:14] that time he'll go back and get that
[2:09:16] body again and come down there he is
[2:09:21] that's what the other prophet said that
[2:09:23] yeah and we look up he said there he is
[2:09:25] praise the lord and he said in glory
[2:09:27] right now he said all the saints that
[2:09:29] are going on
[2:09:31] they're not we're not going to
[2:09:32] fellowship with those in previous ages
[2:09:34] he said he said they're going to
[2:09:35] fellowship with with all the believers
[2:09:37] in in that age they're over there
[2:09:38] they're over there they're there the
[2:09:40] lutherans the methodists and this one
[2:09:42] and this group and so on but he said
[2:09:44] when we in in the resurrection rapture
[2:09:46] he said we're all going to come together
[2:09:48] by the grace of god
[2:09:51] god help us
[2:09:55] amen
[2:09:58] praise the lord
[2:10:00] listen
[2:10:01] god helps to believe in the resurrection
[2:10:04] god help us to believe in the rapture
[2:10:06] god of us to believe in
[2:10:09] yes in glorified bodies
[2:10:13] amen god allows us to believe that we're
[2:10:15] getting closer and closer and closer to
[2:10:18] those bodies
[2:10:22] amen
[2:10:25] god's grace
[2:10:27] many things there could say on faith
[2:10:29] we'll see
[2:10:37] i mentioned that abraham
[2:10:40] his actions and his reactions wasn't
[2:10:41] based on sight
[2:10:43] it wasn't based on feelings or reasoning
[2:10:46] it was based on faith
[2:10:48] what god had revealed
[2:10:50] amen
[2:10:51] and faith told him
[2:10:53] that out there somewhere there was a
[2:10:55] city whose builder and maker was god
[2:10:58] and he believed it he went looking for
[2:11:01] the city
[2:11:03] amen
[2:11:05] it's one thing to say i believe it but
[2:11:07] it's another thing to allow it to
[2:11:08] control
[2:11:11] your actions and your reactions
[2:11:15] it's another thing to allow it to
[2:11:16] control your relationship with the
[2:11:18] people around you
[2:11:22] but abraham in his faith-based actions
[2:11:24] and reactions he showed that he believed
[2:11:27] there was such a city that god had
[2:11:29] promised
[2:11:31] he was so in union and so one with god
[2:11:34] and what god revealed to him that he
[2:11:36] obeyed
[2:11:37] even though it meant leaving the land of
[2:11:40] his birth and total separation from his
[2:11:43] kindred
[2:11:45] the problem today is that people choose
[2:11:47] not to walk the talk
[2:11:50] there is a lack of the life
[2:11:52] of the holy ghost that motivates the
[2:11:54] walk
[2:11:56] indicating a great lack of faith
[2:12:00] where there is a lack of faith there is
[2:12:01] a lack of union and oneness with the
[2:12:03] bridegroom
[2:12:06] because the food the drink the pleasure
[2:12:08] weddings and social life that
[2:12:10] preoccupied those in the noah's day
[2:12:13] also pre occupied this generation
[2:12:16] no you don't know as they they got
[2:12:18] caught up with the natural part of life
[2:12:20] the natural things in life
[2:12:22] not the spiritual
[2:12:24] but brother i pray we're getting more
[2:12:25] and more caught up with the spiritual
[2:12:27] and less with the natural
[2:12:28] amen
[2:12:33] grace
[2:12:40] yeah what are we looking for
[2:12:42] grace
[2:12:43] i pray that brother
[2:12:46] there are thoughts and motives and
[2:12:48] objectives is more and more and more on
[2:12:49] the resurrection and the rapture
[2:12:53] our faith is concentrating more and more
[2:12:56] on the resurrection and the rapture
[2:12:58] whether whatever god has done and what
[2:13:00] god is doing is to increase our faith
[2:13:03] regarding the resurrection and the
[2:13:04] rapture
[2:13:07] amen
[2:13:09] he got
[2:13:10] all done previous ages he got him to
[2:13:12] focus on on the revelation of what he
[2:13:15] want what he was revealing whether it's
[2:13:16] justification sanctification baptism of
[2:13:19] the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit
[2:13:21] well
[2:13:22] now he's getting us to focus on the
[2:13:24] resurrection and the rapture
[2:13:28] yeah
[2:13:29] god help us
[2:13:34] if we are in perfect union and oneness
[2:13:37] the word
[2:13:38] bride body
[2:13:40] with the word bridegroom
[2:13:42] we will manifest a pilgrim's actions and
[2:13:44] reactions we will walk the talk
[2:13:48] a pilgrim is not a resident
[2:13:50] he's just passing through
[2:13:52] and that's why he doesn't become
[2:13:54] preoccupied with the natural things of
[2:13:56] life he never settles down in this world
[2:14:00] amen grace of god
[2:14:04] and there's a lot more quotes regarding
[2:14:06] the rapture and
[2:14:07] faith
[2:14:09] amen
[2:14:13] god help us
[2:14:14] 1953
[2:14:17] he said well
[2:14:18] if we can't have enough faith enough for
[2:14:20] divine healing how are we going to have
[2:14:22] a rapturing faith that's right
[2:14:25] oh i believe there's a great call coming
[2:14:28] forth
[2:14:29] amen
[2:14:31] i truly believe
[2:14:32] before the church can have the rapture
[2:14:34] it's got to have a rapturing faith
[2:14:37] and we can't even have faith for divine
[2:14:39] healing let alone rapturing faith
[2:14:43] god or rather we've got to have a faith
[2:14:46] that'll change
[2:14:47] and quicken this body and be taken away
[2:14:50] by the grace of god
[2:14:54] believe there's a church on this road
[2:14:55] tonight
[2:14:56] a power of the living god that men will
[2:14:58] speak the word here and there and it'll
[2:15:01] flash like lightning
[2:15:02] amen brother speak the word that's right
[2:15:05] and a church is coming out not a
[2:15:07] psychological psychologist not some of
[2:15:09] this put on make believe but a real true
[2:15:12] genuine anointed holy ghost
[2:15:14] called
[2:15:15] out church amen amen
[2:15:19] amen
[2:15:21] rather what a
[2:15:22] tremendous hour we're living
[2:15:24] i pray grace lord elvis let go let god
[2:15:26] have his way
[2:15:27] lord help us to let go father of the
[2:15:30] natural things of life let us get into
[2:15:31] the spiritual
[2:15:33] amen lord that we're going not by sight
[2:15:35] but by faith
[2:15:38] is faith controlling you
[2:15:41] amen
[2:15:44] listen god's grace
[2:15:48] he said to now he said we're moving
[2:15:51] right on into another great age
[2:15:53] coming for the rapture of the church
[2:15:56] amen
[2:15:57] and in this he said we're living in the
[2:15:59] time he's of the restoration of the
[2:16:01] gifts
[2:16:02] and he said it stumbled many of the big
[2:16:04] fine churches
[2:16:06] it sent nazarene backwards it made
[2:16:09] fanatics out of a lot of pentecost but
[2:16:11] just the same god's moving right on and
[2:16:14] bringing in the rapturing faith for his
[2:16:16] church
[2:16:17] amen
[2:16:18] so tonight i
[2:16:20] represent that faith
[2:16:22] amen
[2:16:24] that was once delivered to the saints
[2:16:27] amen grace
[2:16:30] brother god sent the prophet with the
[2:16:32] word with the message to give us
[2:16:34] rapturing faith
[2:16:36] amen
[2:16:42] after you have trusted him
[2:16:45] watched him
[2:16:48] do so many things till becomes like just
[2:16:50] a regular routine
[2:16:52] and that's the condition i think the
[2:16:54] church will be in just before the coming
[2:16:56] of the lord so the rapture will just go
[2:16:59] right on that way
[2:17:00] it'll just be a regular routine of
[2:17:02] following the scriptures and the plans
[2:17:05] of god
[2:17:06] amen
[2:17:09] for that's what god wants us to do is to
[2:17:11] recognize one another as brothers and
[2:17:14] sisters
[2:17:15] and rallying around this great gift of
[2:17:17] god which is the holy ghost
[2:17:20] we'd all be one in one great bundle of
[2:17:23] godly love
[2:17:24] he said that's what it's going to take
[2:17:26] for the church to go in the rapture
[2:17:29] amen
[2:17:31] that we be one great bundle of godly
[2:17:33] love
[2:17:34] praise the lord amen

[2:17:52] please she pleased the holy spirit and
[2:17:56] the holy spirit spoke back and said

[2:18:02] and whatever you got you want and you
[2:18:04] want find out whether this is real or
[2:18:07] not

[2:18:13] don't come and give it to you right now
[2:18:16] then i'm a false prophet

[2:18:46] twinkling of an eye to go out or will
[2:18:49] not go
[2:18:50] but don't worry it'll be there
[2:18:53] yeah because god has given the word to
[2:18:55] give us that faith
[2:18:57] by grace

[2:19:05] anything but back to acts again
[2:19:08] right when he said before the day comes
[2:19:11] they'll burn the earth like an oven and
[2:19:13] the righteous will walk it up on the
[2:19:15] ashes
[2:19:16] amen oh brother we are looking for a
[2:19:18] light to come it's here
[2:19:21] amen the light is here
[2:19:24] glory and remember when elijah comes
[2:19:26] that's the messenger to the laodicean
[2:19:28] church age elijah was the one that went
[2:19:31] up on a chariot
[2:19:33] never tasted death
[2:19:35] and he said the message of this great
[2:19:37] messenger that'll come in this closing
[2:19:39] day
[2:19:40] amen in the laodicean church age the
[2:19:43] pentecostal age will be the one that
[2:19:45] will take the church to rapture
[2:19:48] he was raptured himself and he will come
[2:19:50] with the church to the rapture
[2:19:52] the ministry of elijah yes sir amen
[2:19:57] praise the name of the lord
[2:20:00] hallelujah
[2:20:03] praise the lord
[2:20:07] he said i believe the churches begin to
[2:20:09] hear the message and begin to understand
[2:20:12] but friends listen
[2:20:13] we have got to lay in the presence of
[2:20:15] the sun
[2:20:16] we have got to be ripened
[2:20:19] our faith isn't ripe
[2:20:22] intellectually we're hearing the message
[2:20:24] that god has given us and seeing the
[2:20:26] signs that he showed us and proving it
[2:20:28] by the bible and he said but all he said
[2:20:31] out of the church needs to lay in his
[2:20:32] presence till it tenders up
[2:20:35] and he said you know gets
[2:20:37] sweet in the spirit
[2:20:39] amen
[2:20:41] and he says sometimes in speaking the
[2:20:43] message you get harsh and have to break
[2:20:45] it in like that because you've got to
[2:20:47] clench the nail to make it hold
[2:20:51] amen yeah you just don't drive the nail
[2:20:53] in turn it over and clinch it
[2:20:56] amen
[2:20:57] clenching the nails
[2:20:59] oh yes i've seen that done for years and
[2:21:01] years and years and years to see what
[2:21:03] the the the old folks you know building
[2:21:05] this building that and they're using the
[2:21:07] nails and then they turn it over and
[2:21:08] bend the nail
[2:21:10] to make sure the nail's not going to
[2:21:11] fall out
[2:21:13] yeah so we got we got to drive the nails
[2:21:15] in
[2:21:16] and
[2:21:17] then we got to clench them
[2:21:20] and a lot of
[2:21:20] so-called believers don't want you to do
[2:21:22] the clutching
[2:21:25] the collection gets a little bit more
[2:21:26] rough
[2:21:28] yeah god help us
[2:21:30] we got to clench the nails we got to
[2:21:32] clench amen
[2:21:33] the faith that god has given us
[2:21:36] amen
[2:21:42] listen
[2:21:52] grace
[2:21:55] brother this third pool rapturing faith
[2:21:57] is to be used only for the purpose of
[2:21:59] fulfilling the promise for this age
[2:22:03] and the promise for this age is
[2:22:04] resurrection and
[2:22:06] rapture but again he said our faith
[2:22:09] isn't ripe
[2:22:10] amen
[2:22:14] grace of god
[2:22:16] amen amen
[2:22:20] and it was the rapture of message 1965
[2:22:23] and he said to the church the bride the
[2:22:25] rapture is a revelation to her
[2:22:30] oh yeah we got the message and we think
[2:22:32] the rapture the message is the revel
[2:22:34] this revelation that revelation this
[2:22:35] revelation that revelation
[2:22:38] but do you have the revelation of the
[2:22:39] rapture
[2:22:42] because that's what god's doing
[2:22:46] there was justification sanctification
[2:22:48] baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of
[2:22:49] the spirit but don't put the emphasis on
[2:22:51] that now we thank god for it move on
[2:22:54] because the emphasis now is the rapture
[2:22:57] resurrection amen
[2:23:03] and he said the true bride of christ
[2:23:05] will be waiting for that revelation of
[2:23:07] the rapture amen
[2:23:09] and it is a revelation for revelation is
[2:23:12] faith
[2:23:13] and you cannot have a revelation without
[2:23:15] it being faith faith is a revelation
[2:23:18] because it's something that's revealed
[2:23:19] to you
[2:23:21] and faith is something that's been
[2:23:23] revealed to you like it was to abraham
[2:23:25] and that could call anything contrary to
[2:23:27] what had been revealed to him as though
[2:23:30] it wasn't so god alphas
[2:23:33] amen
[2:23:36] it says in joel
[2:23:39] god is going to restore
[2:23:41] the lutheran age did not restore the
[2:23:43] church it started a reformation
[2:23:46] the western age did not restore
[2:23:50] he said the pentecostal age did not
[2:23:52] restore
[2:23:54] but he said god has to restore for he
[2:23:56] cannot deny his word
[2:23:58] and that poor little root and stalk is
[2:24:00] going to be restored god isn't going to
[2:24:03] plant a new church he is going to bring
[2:24:05] his original planting back to the
[2:24:07] original seed
[2:24:09] amen and he is going to
[2:24:11] he is doing it as stated in verse 23
[2:24:15] by teaching
[2:24:16] or former rain
[2:24:18] next will come the harvest rain
[2:24:21] the teaching rain right
[2:24:23] brother you got it
[2:24:25] rightering faith
[2:24:27] amen
[2:24:28] so he said he's doing it as stated in
[2:24:30] verse 23 by the teaching or former rain
[2:24:34] next will come the harvest rain
[2:24:36] teaching rain or rapturing faith that's
[2:24:39] right
[2:24:41] anything that god has given us and is
[2:24:42] giving us in these last days is wrap is
[2:24:44] to give us rapturing faith by the grace
[2:24:47] of god
[2:24:48] amen and amen and amen
[2:24:52] praise the lord
[2:24:55] to god be the glory
[2:24:57] there's many many other quotes so we'll
[2:24:59] leave that by the grace of god
[2:25:01] brother
[2:25:03] to encourage you
[2:25:05] to understand and believe that what god
[2:25:07] has done
[2:25:08] has been predestinated to give us
[2:25:10] the faith that we need in these last
[2:25:13] days
[2:25:14] and it's not just to say i believe in
[2:25:16] god but it's to believe god concerning
[2:25:18] the resurrection and the rapture
[2:25:22] are we ready for the resurrection
[2:25:24] are we ready for the rapture and again
[2:25:27] bear in mind and remember as the prophet
[2:25:30] said that the dead in christ are waiting
[2:25:33] on us amen
[2:25:35] and he said and god is waiting on us
[2:25:39] amen for the rapture
[2:25:41] for rapturing faith
[2:25:44] but there's too many and i know it just
[2:25:46] too many so-called believers are waiting
[2:25:48] on god
[2:25:49] no we wait on god for we want god for
[2:25:52] the resurrection well he's he's already
[2:25:54] done this he gave us the the revelation
[2:25:56] of it he'd give us for to give us the
[2:25:58] faith of it and so on for the
[2:26:00] resurrection and the rapture do you
[2:26:02] believe let's go
[2:26:04] let's go into resurrection
[2:26:06] let's go in the rapture come on
[2:26:09] look up
[2:26:10] praise the lord
[2:26:12] god help us my prayer
[2:26:14] brother i trust by the grace of god that
[2:26:17] it's striking us right
[2:26:23] again the prophet of god said in 1965
[2:26:26] november the 27th
[2:26:29] just before the lord took him home
[2:26:32] he preached the message i have heard
[2:26:35] but now i see amen
[2:26:39] he said we see him meeting after meeting
[2:26:42] and sometimes we sit just as cold and
[2:26:45] indifferent
[2:26:46] yes i know the scripture says it oh i
[2:26:49] have seen it done
[2:26:50] but he said we have no enthusiasm and it
[2:26:54] doesn't seem to strike us right
[2:26:58] well
[2:26:59] it's trump luther right
[2:27:01] struck wesley they struck the
[2:27:03] pentecostals
[2:27:04] when they went around the world
[2:27:06] preaching the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:27:07] the gifts of the spirit and so on oh
[2:27:10] yeah
[2:27:11] what about the message of the hour to
[2:27:13] give us rapturing faith is that striking
[2:27:14] is right if it strikes us right it's
[2:27:17] going to give us rapturing faith amen
[2:27:20] we're not going to it ought to have
[2:27:22] given us rapturing faith now look up
[2:27:26] your redemption draws near
[2:27:28] look up how many are looking up and
[2:27:31] especially considering what's going on
[2:27:33] in the world right now
[2:27:35] in russia yeah
[2:27:37] that's right
[2:27:39] in america
[2:27:40] around the world
[2:27:43] remember the prophet of god said that
[2:27:46] oh
[2:27:48] if this is recorded i bet be careful
[2:27:53] that there was a certain country you
[2:27:55] know
[2:27:56] he said they got a bomb and he's got our
[2:27:58] name on it
[2:27:59] what name the name of america
[2:28:08] be on your guard
[2:28:11] it's serious
[2:28:13] and if brother if there's anything that
[2:28:15] ought to help us look up more and more
[2:28:17] and more with what's going on in the
[2:28:19] world now

[2:28:36] what's going on
[2:28:37] in russia what's going on with america
[2:28:39] and russia and other other nations
[2:28:42] and so on it is serious
[2:28:45] and surely
[2:28:46] after all that we've heard the prophet
[2:28:47] say
[2:28:48] it ought to put us more on our toes more
[2:28:50] on our
[2:28:52] guard yeah

[2:29:08] see this see this see this this is going
[2:29:10] to happen that's going to happen and
[2:29:12] finally they're going to say oh i

[2:29:17] know it
[2:29:19] didn't know
