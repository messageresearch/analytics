Oh Jesus blessed blessed Redeemer a man shan't heart of God man all of us yes a man yes [Music] praise the name of the Lord amen grace of God to us as we go from the singing to the hearing a man the tongue would say one thing but very we pray it's going to hear the word of God praise the name of the Lord so to God be the glory as we go into his words a man that we're going to say what God wants us to say you're going to hear it what God wants you to hear amen not what you want to hear how you want to hear it when and where but it's what God wants us to hear amen and it says thy word have I hid in my heart a man so we got we got to have the word in US with us and around us but it's so significant so important and again when we say word we're not just we're not referring to this this no no in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us so brother we want this in flesh in the flesh of Jesus and now in the flesh of his bride in the flesh of flesh of his sons and daughters a man those who are in the revelation those who are reflecting the revelation and those who are in the will of God a man well they were in the revelation reflecting of the way God wants it done were in the will of God so god help us brother that we're going to be in his will and do him a service with his will not country to his will or without it and there's many down through the ages brother they've tried to serve God but not according to his will they tried to serve God according to their will what they want how they want it when and where they wanted no no not my real father thine be done amen we show you the significance of the will of God amen Jesus I lighted the significance of the will of God so brother so I pray the grace of God that we're going to recognize the significance of of being in the will of God a man praise the name of the Lord it's just now saying I believe this and I believe that I'm in the message are we in the will of God or the will of God is the message right but again when it comes to God applying that message to your life applying it to my life somebody else is like brother what God is going to do and use one thing but he doesn't somebody else is another what God uses you for one thing what he uses somebody else is another a man we got to have that leadership and that anointing in our lives by the grace of God amen so being prayer as we go more and more into the word concerning I have heard but now I see I've got a right motive and right objective and doing God a service with his will not without his will a man I was surprised to discover that in the first message that we were considering I have heard but now I see that the problem of God highlights the will of God two or three times a man so I want to show you with you scriptures concerning the will of God and to share with you some thoughts through the messenger and the messenger of the hour concerning the will of God a man brother to those that are acceptable in God's presence in sight brother we got to be in the will of God amen because if not God's going to challenge us as a challenge game if thou do as well what they'll also be accepted amen but to do well do you have to do it according to the will of God amen by the grace of God amen so just to remind you that there is a couple of sheets of some quotes the Lord laid on my heart and there be copies out there for you and it's referencing God's love gift to our Lord Jesus Christ amen so you can pick that up on your way out so basically we wonder what is God's love gift to our Lord Jesus Christ amen I trust you can identify with what the Prophet is revealing a man you can say Amen brother branham I believe it by the grace of God amen let's stay in this thing only believe all things are possible only believe alleluia Oh baby Oh all things are possible [Music] Oh baby Oh all things are possible [Music] only Jesus Lee let's believe that Jesus is here amen let's believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen and that we know here in the power of his resurrection amen and in the Fellowship of his suffering Alleluia to God be the glory valerian a man Jesus yes Jesus is here [Music] and that's why that all things are possible the resurrection direction because she's and sincerely man hallelujah Lord I hate man hallelujah Lord I believe amen help our unbelief Lord oh Jesus as other preeminence Lord in our say halleloo amen amen things are possible Lord [Music] hallelujah Lord thou knowest the heart Lord we are all judged by what's in our heart you see what's in our heart or you know father the desires of art you know what we want you know Lord what we're seeking so lord I pray grace that is acceptable in your sight I pray grace Lord that you're recognizing in us and in our hearts you're recognizing the will of God nor you're recognizing the attitude and the spirit that not my will but thine be done father that we're there and we're ready and willing to say surrender all to you Lord that we're willing Lord I surrender all and accept the will of God and when were unwilling Lord to make the sacrifices that you want us to make father lay aside every weight and every sin that easily besets us and run with patience the race that has said before us father knowing that we have to run according to the will of God Alleluia we have to do what you want us to do according to your will not my will father thine be done hallelujah so that grace in my life that grace in my brother's life that grace and my sister's like nor that we are not in our will we are in the will of God hallelujah amen to the extent Lord that we want to do what you want us to do nor that we want our will to surrender to your will Alleluia and to God be the glory Alleluia praise the name of the Lord his tremendous Lord to live in this our Lord and still believe God that we're living in this hour we're still believe in the finish work of Calvary we're living in this hour and still claiming the victory Lord of the finished work of Calvary Lord in our souls and O Lord over the world and over the flesh and over the devil o Lord Alveston see of us to understand that we have to have victory over the world that we have they have victory over the flesh and father and victory over the devil himself so that we are more than conquerors in our Lord Jesus Christ so the grace of your presence to be with us in US and around us the grace of your presence in their going forth of your word the grace of your presence revealing your word the grace of your presence in our Lord hallelujah to receive your word with understanding with revelation a man to receive it according to the will of God amen to give glory and honor and praise to the will of God so your grace I pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to be with us in the going forth of your word and Lord your will your will to be with us in the receiving of your word a man again or not our will of your will we see what you want us to receive do what you want us to do hallelujah to God be the glory so Lord into your hands we commit all the needs father of the body father the needs that are here in our souls in our spirits father in our in our bodies in all circumstances in all situations lord have mercy on us help us to be conscious of you lord amen father ain't my and grace again O Lord that is not us that's doing it is God that's doing it amen that we have to put our trust and our faith and our confidence in you and believe a man that you do all things well a man and that we have the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen we have the anointing of our Lord Jesus Christ the power father of the life of your blood in us with us and around us to God be the glory a man elmo's to be sincere Lord absolutely sincere father sincerely right for the glory of God and in the will of God grace in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the name of the Lord alleluia alleluia alleluia thank you Jesus amen praise the Lord hallelujah now I believe [Music] amen how I believe now a man yesterday yes Lord tomorrow the Lord grace to believe now this day this tower praise the name of the Lord all things are possible now I believe amen embrace the name of the Lord god bless you turn with me to st. Luke's Gospel you see no I'm sorry it's st. Matthew chapter 6 it's in Matthew's Gospel chapter 6 the grace of God to us as we go into the word hey man take it serious the our living is serious brothers sister so much so that Jesus said if he didn't shorten time there be no flesh saved but thank God for the elects sake he shortens time a man we know that it's just almost six thousand years in the Jewish calendar we know we've gone over in the Roman one but that's not that better that calendar is not correct so we're gonna stick to the Jewish calendar and and recognize what God is doing with us and recognize what God is doing with them a man because they are also a sign a man to us by the grace of God and in Matthew chapter 6 and verse 7 but he said when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking not of leavers like that but it says be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before you ask him after this manner therefore pray notice the instructions that he gives in the Lord's Prayer our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name is recognizing our father and his name amen thy kingdom come notice the kingdom come Thy will be done amen the will of God be done in earth as it is in heaven amen no wonder said not my will then be done it's not what I will is what God wills a man is what God has predestinated from the foundation of the world a man we wonder as it is the will of God in heaven we want that will of God on earth a man in his sons and daughters in Israel and in the Gentile bright so thy kingdom come they will be done in earth is his will in you is his will in me as it is in heaven this is tremendous because what God purposed in heaven God is making flesh on the earth praise the Lord so give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors amen that's having the right spirit in this world for sure amen and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil again reminding you of the time when I was working at a house on a ladder inside and this gentleman came in and he looked at me and he said Jarrell I got a Bible question I said okay I'll see what the Lord will me and he referenced the Lord's Prayer and he said it says lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil he said why would we say that does God tempt us does God delivered but bring us into temptation and does God bring us into evil I should know I said you're asking God and praying God to deliver us from the influence of the tempter that's the devil a man to deliver us from the influence of Satan a man so I said lead us not into temptation taking away Shane's influence from your life a man from your soul and deliver us from evil a man deliver us from the influence of the devil amen all he said brother oh that's wonderful he said that makes a lot of sense he was I was wondering about God and what God was like and and how a leader we would do this now I would do that thank you brother he said I'll never forget it of course he I trust my grace he's wrestling with the Lord he's gone on for a number of years now a man so lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil deliver us from Satan's influence a man not just this deed or that deed is the one that's causing that and that is the devil a man trying to re understand that when you read the Lord's Prayer or when you say the Lord's Prayer again for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen god bless his words you may be seated we're going to some other scriptures in a moment but these are notes that brother and brother Matthew I believe used on Wednesday when he when I was gone and he was talking I believe about sacrifices and there was a section there saying things to sacrifice and it says invent Peter he says he also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood a man to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so is not looking at the physical sacrifice but the spiritual we can sacrifice that spirit physically and we can do this physically a man as the Bible says you you can leave and lay down your life you can know this and know that but you're not going to make spiritual sacrifices then it's all in vain yeah it is absolutely tremendous when it comes to Corinthians first Corinthians chapter 13 Paul was encouraging you know the believers to understand this to do this to do this to do that and so on but then he comes down with this with this warning concerning that the gifts must be governed by love amen and again there's no matter what you do for God it's got to be governed by love a man it's the love of God in you the love of God in me now brother is the love of God in me going back to God a man responding to his word so all the revelation all that God has given us the the faith to do it's got to be it's got to be governed by divine love not natural off it's got to be difficult governed by divine law God have mercy on us and God help us that we're not just putting the emphasis on the letter of the word but we're going to put the emphasis on the spirit of the word a man because it's the spirit of the word that's life not the letter the letter are killed but the Spirit is going to give us eternal life by the grace of God a man as if if if it's governed by divine love that I've had that experience with God I bet a that experience with Jesus to the extent any man that I have is loving me and it's not me it's Christ to live within me a mayor and brother I gotta have Christ in me to have the love of Christ I gotta have Christ in me do to reflect the love of Christ amen to manifest the love of Christ pour em and for one another so brother I pray the grace of God help us that we're going to love one another as we love him we're going to love one another as the evidence that we love him that's it brother sister there are those that say they love God but they don't love their brothers and sisters in Christ a man they looked down their noses and this one day instead of respecting them and then God says listen he said they're they're weak and there's the strong there are those that are up here there are those that I down here and he's nei God God requires that the ones that are up here he's going to look after the ones that are down here a man they're going to support and encourage the ones that are that are weak they're going to support and encourage the ones they don't have the revelation maybe they they got maybe because they some got greater revelation greater revelation greater revelation but brother whether they're strong or weak they but they still have faith a man in what they see and what they know whether they were they were they understand they a gives them the faith that pleases God amen because God God requires this of one person but he's not expecting it from the other a man God's acknowledging that person and that person's nature a man of course he's there to help them but again brother he God has permitted that person to be there God has permitted the other person to be there those that are weak those that are strong amen because the weak ones are going to bring out was in the strong ones oh brother and again God's ways are not our ways and neither is his thoughts are thoughts a man because as I as the heaven is above the earth so is God's ways and God's thoughts above ours a man so brother a constantly requiring the water is reminding us that we've got we've got to humble ourselves amen brother and there's anything your experience with Jesus has done it's humbled you you're gonna give the glory to God you're gonna give the glory to Jesus you're gonna give the glory to others but you're not going to glorify yourself amen brother as the scripture says here though those that want to do this - what for to highlight themselves they want to do this and I light themselves and make you look and make themselves look good in the eyes of the others no no brother listen listen to make them sure that we're good in the eyes of God amen and if you're good in the eyes of God brother you don't consider yourself very good and yeah in your own eyes amen brother if there's anything that Hong but will humble us and anything that keeps us humble is the revelation that I am a sinner saved by grace amen and that you are a sinner saved by grace see God concluded all under sin that he might have mercy on all a man so that there's not ever going to be claim this and claim this and so on oh I'm better than this when I'm better than that we'll see what God is doing it's the grace of God ain't man and whether you're whether you're you're just a simple humble testimony of the Lord or whether you're a prophet a man prayers God's concerned your sinners saved by grace amen so brother sister help us to have the revelation that pleases God help us they have the attitude that pleases God help us that find us Lord God you'll find us in the will of God amen brother game the will of God os in the message a man o course it's in the message but whether it's in the message or in this you're doing this or you got this ministry this ministry that ministry but again we're all sinners saved by grace and so father God said even he said the pastor he said when he gets out of the pulpit he said when I get a II got at the pulpit he said I'm just another brother like you Amen praise the name of the Lord Alleluia thank God that that the power of God had such humility the prophet of God has such a revelation a man mother he didn't want to exalt himself above you not by any means he wanted to exalt Jesus he want to give Jesus the glory he wanted to get your attention to Jesus a man and he and again he referred to his ministry and the success of his ministry what have I got to do he said he says work for God to do this regard to do that and he said to refer for the anointing to be upon the sick and he saw I got I got a choice and I just stand there and and tell them this and tell them that no no no he said I got to get into their shoes amen he said because that could be my brother that could be my mother could be my father a man so he said I got to get into their shoes white girl it could be him a man and he said I'm going to identify so with their sickness praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and he was going to call on the Lord a man out of a head of a pure heart a man because his heart was going out to that brother his heart was going out to that person maybe that child ain't man Alleluia brother he wasn't there to magnify himself he wasn't there to glorify himself with this sign of that sign and this gift and that gift no brother I tell you this it was motivated by divine love though he was called to be a prophet and he was given these signs yet it was controlled and motivated by his love for God and his love for God is reflected by his love for the the sons and daughters of God a man though old mine praise the name of the Lord I tell you this there's many a preacher that had that had never had the signs and wonders that William Branham hat but brother what they did have the old they went out and pray for the sick and they were healed by the grace of God and what do they do oh they they put themselves up they elevated themselves they they all mind you know they I got a great ministry I got this no brother it's not our ministry is God's ministry amen whether whether issue as a deacon as an elder as a no matter what you are as a pastor but whatever it is is it's God we're not great god is great a man it is and God maybe takes the worst so he can use it and use them this way a man oh my god is not going to go there or take somebody that's I and lift it up in their minds no he's going to take somebody else down in their minds a man somebody that recognizes who they are what they need a man sinners saved by grace needing the Savior by the grace of Almighty God a man so brother I Elvis got Elvis to stay humble stay sincere amen they're the ones that's going in the resurrection they're the ones that's going in the rapture man and not those that think they're big and I got all I got all this revelation this revelation and I understand this and I understand that we understand nothing but for the grace of God amen I know this only by the grace of God I see this when the grass grace in your life a man we're every reverence race we respect grace we recognize race amen amen and we and we give God the glory for His grace and when you do amen that brings God on the scene we do more for you amen for they that humble themselves shall be exalted a man those that those that exalt themselves to part down a man but those that over themselves are lifted up by the grace of Almighty God amen so brother as lively stones and we are built up a spiritual house and a holy priesthood just consider not just say oh I'm called to be a believer I'm called to believe this message I got to believe these doctrines no no we are who God has dealing with lively stones guy hey wow that's built up a spiritual house a man praise the name of the Lord and you were all worth of Bride of Christ but we're a spiritual house wherein he comes to live where he comes to dwell a man by the grace of God and he said we're and a holy priesthood praise the name of the Lord hallelujah milk it milk as a decayed ass makes us the holy priesthood by the grace of God and to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ amen God Elvis brothers sister then this is not oh I'm a sinner so God come down to save me thank you lord hallelujah I'm going on so I'm gonna go to heaven anyhow no indeed not I'm not but not with that attitude not with that spirit no no it's recognizing your need of a savior recognizing the Savior they come omit the need a man and you humble yourselves to him not my real father thine be done now what do you want me to do I have come to the revelation of Jesus as my Lord as Savior now Lord what he wanted to do I did my own will but now I gonna do yours father I lay I live for myself and I live for this when I live for that one but now I'm gonna live you so Lord is not my will anymore I don't care about my will I don't care what my flesh wants but what do you want nor that's the important thing right now is what do you want help me Lord by the grace of God amen - and our brother was ministering on sacrifice and if we're good we're going to come in into Christ Christ into us whether we got to sacrifice everything a man as pretending to our our human nature as pertaining to our flesh we have the sacrifice everything a man so brother we're going to only take and line up and lay it lay in with the Word of God a man with what God has revealed and with what God is revealing in my day and in your day a man all God Elvis brother or I I believe the message of the Prophet and so on but again like I said so does the devil but brother the devil is not going to believe it to the extent that it's going to control him no no but what believers believe it to the extent that it controls you amen that it controls us so we're there oh this is as oh yeah I a certain certain believer was highlighting Christmas and and it was sent practically you know around the world and when I when I received this saying that they're writing and I just went to the phone right away I never waited I went to the phone right away and I dialed him and I said look do you know what you've done what do you mean I say we I said you you've I said you've all mine you've oh yea increase the sale I sell Christmas trees I said it's going to be increased increase increase increase I suggest because of what you said and how you said it I said why in the world didn't you include some quotes by the Prophet a mayor and I just say this and I just say that no no no I said but I said don't just say leave him with this impression that impression all the power of God you know he had a Christmas tree for his son Joseph yeah he say but Joseph was only a little boy then a man and only that I said hey the Christmas tree there was a wire one that he that he went out and bought in a store somewhere a man but I said you should have also included the quotes I see where the prophet of God said how in the world can you call yourself a Christian and he shouldn't have those things and he talked about the decorations in a house there you decorate your windows you decorate your your ceiling and maybe have a Christmas tree here and there so on so a brother I said don't never do that again I said the power of God and I and I put it online of course and I friend of the book I said I want to show you whether prophet of God said what he believed and what he and what he spoke concerning Christmas and so on and I said no where are we justified I sit in having a Christmas decorations nor be justified in even having a Christmas tree a man brother what is the will of God let's find the will of God in the revealed Word of God in this hour the problem might have done this but he said this so brother we're going to judge by what he said not by what he did but what he said a man from the grace of God that we're going to stay with the Word of God stay with the message of God stay with the revealed Word a man and I know that he Eve and believers can criticize and condemn me for for the for the booklet that I put out and they said all you never read that right there when the end where it speaks of it in internal Maya and so on I said brother I said we can apply it to idolatry and as we can apply through this and apply it to that but I said Christmas is idolatry amen so by the grace of God that with divine love we stay with the word with divine love we're going to we're going to become one with the word amen that we love God and if we love God we love his word we love God we love his sons and daughters if we love God we love the body of Christ a man by the grace of God so he said that in there when it comes with the gifts everything got to be governed by love amen she said oh I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity divine love I am become as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal amen see he says he's explaining to us that it and when the prophet of God has brought out in hearing it the way God wants you to hear it see the way God wants you to see it the right motive and objective because if we don't then it's all in vain a man it is all in vain and in doing God a service without his will he said it's all in vain it is if it's not according to his will a man if your life is not according to his will if what you're doing in your life is not according to the will of God for you whether you're your spiritual if there's any spiritual there is all in vain or your religion is becoming vain Amen because if it's God if it's serving God if it's relieving God it's got to be according to his will we got to do it the way that God wants us to do it and we got to do it our God wants to do it when God wants to do it it's not a God's not leaving us to our own ideas no no he's bringing us why he brings us to the word thy word have I hid in my heart a man that I might not sin against a what is it the word because we're what everything you were coming back to the word the word is going to go into govern you the word is going to control you a man so that we're not going to be controlled and governed by by the world and the things of the world like a it was Wonder Brothers brought up to me just recently a better sermon I preached some years ago and it was called ten shekels and a shirt what yeah a Jew in the priesthood years ago a man oh there was another Jew and his mother that had this home but they had idolatry in the home oh yeah but I assume maybe his mother felt old we should have God here - you know Elohim and so on and we should we should not only you never have a priesthood for the Guardian and for idolatry we need a priesthood for God so her son went out any man he met this this rabbi and he and he said always said would you come he said and burnt and then could serve us you know anything anything worshiping God and so on and he said I'll tell you what I'll do he said I'll give you ten shekels and a shirt hey ten shekels other shirt you see if you'll come and live with me live with us amen so here I do three on one side of his house on the other side he had this displaced Jewish priesthood eight-man but he was there he was compromising brother if he wasn't compromising he will put the idol out he was if he wasn't compromising he wouldn't it went into that house until that until they put of that a man then he would - he would come in and say son all right I'll come representing the true God I'll come representing Redemption I'll come representing this a man no he compromised for ten shekels and a shirt so how mature is this generation of believers compromising for oh they're compromising believes - compromising with that they're going to have this they're going to do this and do that a man where it was the time brother when we first came to the message there was absolute total separation a man from the world and the things of the world we were not influenced by the world and the things of the world God had the greater influence a male and the divine love of God and the greater influence a man we were living for God we were living for the word we're living for the message we're oh yeah we live for it to be a witness and a testimony of what God was doing in our day a man so but again believers today is becoming a form of godliness is becoming tradition is becoming denomination a man when it comes to I believe this oh yeah this is their Creed oh yeah this dis message right here and this is a message this message oh just Creed's yeah I believe this I believe that yeah so does the devil but go out and live it a man go out and walk in the will of God oh this is the will of God right here this doctrine this doctrine y'all but God wants to make it flesh a man God God promised the word to be made pledged to redeem man and I said and they look to this prophet they look to that prophet of that prophet but when they died they they were they put their bodies from the grade-a man but they were looking for one that would come back again a man but I said they were what they were needed was a God prophet until finally the God probably come a man and he lay down his life and he picked it up again and he experienced the resurrection it's me to rapture a man for the redemption of Israel a copy of each of his write for the redemption of the seed of God by the grace of God amen praise the name of the Lord to give us salvation a man and brother he did and again it was the god prophet then and God's Son of God fathered in this hour because there was this evangelist an evangelist this preacher that breacher and this apostle that parcel yeah but where's Jesus where is God a man brother a God in flesh the word in flesh oh yeah well I got it right here oh that's right there no no no yesterday that's that's good but is it in your flesh is there controlling your life it's a controlling the way you think and the way you act and the way that you're living a man is it taking you out of your will and bringing you more and more into the will of God a man so that you're living less and less and less for yourself you're living less and less and less for this world and you're living more and more and more for God you're living more and more for Jesus you're living more and more for the resurrection of the rapture a man but I tell you this if we get caught up in what God is doing brother we're going to get less and less conscious of the world oh yeah we'll get more conscious of God more conscious of the Resurrection more kinds of the rapture but I tell you that not many believers are conscious of what God is doing they're not conscious of the will of God and not by any means because they haven't made the sacrifices they need to make amen if they come into into a relationship with Jesus in an experience with Jesus a man in their souls not in their heads not in their flesh but in their souls if you've got an experience with Jesus you're gonna make the sacrifices a man that God is looking for a man and again again that I brother brought out and he said these are things that you have to sacrifice and then the more you're getting to the word the more the word controls you the more the message control show amen everything is the word the word the message the message God said this God is doing this God is doing that oh it's o'mine you're so caught up with the revelation the resurrection of the rapture hey man yo oh yeah they're not interested in you no no family is not interested in you their friends are not interested in you no no oh they're there to spiritual oh they're just really just you know they don't maybe consider your spiritual because that are your religious and they're all just cut out where you know with this cut up with that and brother there that was that was the persecution that believers experienced over the years then only as you don't experience much of that now because we're not living for the will of God and living out the will of God like they did back then because they're contracted too much cut out with the natural things of life a man oh yeah I believe this but I got want me to do this government me to do that sure they're saying that God want you do but now it had the expense of sacrificing the word amen brother aye brother Matthew brother he said things to sacrifice is ideas a man brother we got to sacrifice her own ideas because we're now God has brought us into his ideas a man and God has revealed his ideas to ass in this day and in this hour again going beyond Martin Luther going beyond wesley going beyond all the others amen going beyond Pentecost amen now we're in the bride age a man by the grace of God and again those that are children of the night are not going to recognize it but the children of the day are going to recognize it a man the true none tonight are going to oh they're going to try and justify their or their own will their God where God wants me to do this God want me to do that no no you got you got a maybe it's just what you want to do because you you got a religious spirit doing God a service without is will a man it's not according to the will of God it's not when God wants you to do it now how God wants you to do it where God wants you to do it ain't mad see you no wonder Jesus his sons and daughters of God and led by the Spirit of God because the Spirit of God keeps us in the will of God the spirit of God reveals the will of God the Spirit of God is going to live out the will of God amen and again a brother goes beyond just believing the letter of the message a man brother of the Spirit of God is going to make the message flesh in you he's going to make the message live itself out in you yes brother God was living himself out in Jesus and then Jesus came back to live himself out in the disciples a man they knew that here they had been with Jesus amen when they were brought into the council and brought in and tried for this and tried for that and they said now don't Doughboy and teach in the name of Jesus see they knew the Bible says they knew that they had been with Jesus a man is not just being religious but they've been with Jesus because now the Jesus that was in flesh now in the spirit he was revealing himself in them and what he was doing in his flesh is doing in them what he was what he was preaching in flesh he was preaching in them right praise the Lord a man a man oh there to them they were they were dealing with Jesus because they were with Jesus now oh yeah this is why they're acting like Jesus and they're talking like Jesus and living like Jesus amen during their doing what Jesus did amen signs and wonders and miracles and all these things amen but Christ wasn't gone Christ was in them now amen and Christ was not gone crisis in the bride now so we're gonna work and I just say I believe this and I believe that we're gonna live it amen God is going to get in you and he's going to live out the word he's going to live out the message amen they they want me I really have to read a book and see what is the message they look at you and then all the message a man because we're going to see the message in you amen it's going to be reflected in you it's going to be it's going to be in control of you and you're going to live it out morning noon and night your spirit your attitude your your thoughts your your your feelings ain't man it's going to be a man it's going to be the word in you a man and that's why they're gonna recognize oh they're religious and you know they're all alike and then they all got this idea they think this they believe this they believe that amen brother is that they is that the witness that we're giving is raised that what family and friends and neighbors are saying today oh they believe this they believe that oh yeah are they saying oh they're just religious people they go to church yeah but is your life different to the extent that they recognize that you're not the same as the others that go to church amen you're not the same as those religious people over that denomination that denomination other denominator no you're different anybody see they did Jesus was different Jesus was different no wonder that Jesus coming at the ministry that he had no wondering when he preached what he preached and he did what he did under finally he laid his life down picked it up well praise the Lord oh yeah well he was God in flesh yeah but he was the word in flesh a man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us no the word is made flesh again in the right praise the Lord brother we ought to be as as different and out of the ordinary as Jesus was 2,000 years ago amen because they were the same in the first stage the second age a man Luther became the same Wesley became the same and this other Sharon became the same but only when they started out not when they're where they are now no they don't have the anointing that way that they had back they had not buy any mates and they don't have the anointing around the masteries that they had back fifty years ago or even 30 40 years ago not by any means a man because they're too caught up with the world and the things of the world the devil is up there brother to get us caught up with this cut up with it oh my he's attractive what to eat to attract your attention oh and brother I tell you he's done it and he's doing it with all the inventions no wonder God the Bible says that man when he got away from God he sought out many inventions and God says he was going to do this and do this he said I'm going to destroy their inventions amen what is it again going back to the Garden of Eden tree of knowledge of good and evil it is it is knowledge of good and evil amen and the world is full of it and it's all around the world as I said that's where that's why that he in certain countries and Muslim countries in Arab countries they're trying to trying to stop the young generation from getting these cell phones stopped the young generation were made from getting computers and all that well because they see the influence in the younger generation they see the influence among those younger Muslims and they're getting more and more and more like the Western world amen and brother again as a servant of God as a minister of the word of God I said I could see the influence of the obvious the influence of this the influence of that a man among believers a man and again as the days out there in in thank God for this this assembly and what he's done air brothers let's keep our hearts rate a man because and as it is out there any in those denominational churches so there's many many many message churches they don't have young people anymore but thank God for it for our young sisters here and young brothers that are being raised up in Oh mind please raise up in the knowledge of the Lord the crane and teach them the things of God by the grace of teacher the fear of God a man by the grace of God bringing them to our to the attention of the Word of God amen so brother again it's a testimony for you and me it's a witness to you and me look up amen but look up and lift up your heads of understanding don't look up without understanding look up with understanding amen what car should look up why are you looking out brother you got a I got a Waco what I saw there tell me that this is going to be here amen so I got to look up for the resurrection I go look up with a rapture I go look up with their coming in the Lord a man by the grace of Almighty God that we're living for the resurrection living for the rapture living for the coming of the Lord amen we're not living within the inlet anything else as I said the Lutheran the Lutheran's and when they got where they had all day just morning noon and night they were just praising the Lord and fellowship being around the revelation of justification aim for three generations and the same with Wesley same with the Salvation Army and same with the Pentecostals a minute and they fellowshipped around the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit morning noon and night amen they weren't living with the world they were living for them for glory living for God a man probably Bray's the name of the Lord amen so they were cut up and I got to do this and I got to do this and I got no no no oh you got to do anything it's only for the body it's if you're gonna do for Christ you do for the body of Christ amen by the grace of God we're going to sacrifice all the things of the world we're going to sacrifice the things that appeal to the flesh amen those things that are of the world the flesh and the devil's influence sacrifice it amen and again we sacrifice these things that we would offer up spiritual sacrifices that are pleasing to God amen because brother got to be pleased we even this if we're going to sacrifice a puddle and put it away amen so that we're gonna walk in the light we're gonna walk in the spirit not walk with the light not walk with the spirit the Block in the Spirit so that the Spirit is in me and I'm in the spirit so that the liars in May and I'm in the light by the grace of Almighty God so again as her brother was emphasizing that we have to sacrifice our ideas yeah you want an idea go pray amen listen to the Holy Ghost you'll give you God's ideas and God's ideas reveals the will of God for your life oh yeah well I'll make this decision no no God got to make that decision if you're born again God got to make that decision by grace no I don't care what is it I say education work whatever it is God got it God's gonna make the choice amen as I said concerning God bless that brother that left as he used a director of a large Hospital and he left it and he and he moved to Alberta so he could get his family into a church there yeah oh my get his family into a church get his children into a church and he quit that job yes he quit it he sacrificed it for the Lord and you know what he become a janitor a janitor most livery wouldn't even consider that why could they they got themselves puffed oh no I'm not gonna do that by the grace of God I was a janitor oh yeah by the grace of God oh yeah one time I even went out in those department stores there I used to go out into the parking lot and just pick up those those ready call shopping carts that's cars shopping carts I quote and pick all the shopping carts up bring him back into the store you know you did that I said yeah I did it it's like I have one brother one time he was an engineer and he said I don't know what to do he said I can't get a job I said can't get a job he said no they don't need no engineers I said well I said have you tried to go to the council see if they need a janitor he didn't want that what is the will of God amen well God would make family John you see would Oh most definitely oh they want this they want that no no whatever God wants you know and sometimes you got a sacrifice for the glory of God you got a sacrifice to give preeminence to his relationship with you and your relationship with him amen but a lot of you they just they just think about it physically naturally oh I want to do this I need this I need that and you know that's where a lot of believers move away from churches that's not the will of God that's the will of the devil brother he says forsake not the exclaiming yourselves assembling of yourselves together much more as you see the Day approaching Oh most definitely and they'll compromise on that and they'll sacrifice that that that there oh well the Lord don't really door don't mind me if I do this if I do oh yes he will what's more important to us the natural life or spiritual unfortunately it's the natural life is more important in the spiritual we want to secure the natural life we want to build up the natural life we want to all make sure this make sure that so I won't have to do this I wanted to worry about this what brother what about work what about our spiritual words okay we don't worry over think spiritually as much as they do naturally brother the grace of God to us amen sure I've done this and I've done that why I'm dare to serve I'm dare to serve that's like I said that's what we lived our lives for you know when we did there to serve one another serve one another as you know even back years ago even when I was young man we just lived our lives or this one that when we go here we go there help help this one help that brother help that sister in the Lord and so on oh yeah we spent our lives now they're gone but we live by the grace of God we live for them we did we live for this brother and sister for that brothers sister for this family for that family we were constantly there to help morning noon and night oh yeah and when it comes to oh yeah holidays Oh as I told brother Billy Paul when we were down there with three years ago and I said brother I said he said oh brother thank you for what you've done I said brother to God be the glory and I said brother we've done everything for the Lord I said we lived our lives so that I said we look forward to a holiday or a long weekend what for so we could go down I said help this brother and sister help that brother and sister help this family of that family oh yeah I said that's all we live for and we were delighted I just said that we had to come back to go to work I said because we want to stay with the Saint a man praise the Lord oh my and now as I said they're practically all gone on and I remember that before the Lord took this sister she called me on the phone she said brother Journal she said I want you to pray for me she said I need a scouring out that was sister burns I said sister I'll pray for you god bless you and God and the Lord encouraged her even when he took her a man and then not long after that maybe I don't know how long then a brother called me pastor Manuel and he said all brothers Earl he said please he said pray for me he said I just need I just need the anointing I need the Lord more and more and more brother please pray for me to help me be more and more victorious I need his help I said okay brother I'll pray for your God bless you a man oh my but how many are recognizing that now how many are saying old brother I want you to bring me please I'm dealing with the devil oh yeah occasionally you will meet that person but how many are going to give their lives over to the will of God see well the manuals looking more and more for the will of God in his life sister Burns was looking more and more for the will of God in her life yeah not my will dying be done I trust the Lord gave her her scouring out by the grace of God all brother see is the Holy Ghost in brother sister burns out there and the other sisters and brothers and brothers sister Manuel there and but the Holy Ghost in in the Saints in where we lived in Buren at the time oh yeah or maybe say John's grace of God lord help us to find your will and stay in your will because we when it comes to our will it's based on our thoughts it's based on our reasoning it's based on our feelings yeah but you got to cast it down not my real father don't be done amen and then you're going to make the sacrifice that Jesus made yeah what he was fighting in the flesh not my will dying be done he could have called ten thousand angels to destroy the world and set him free yeah just a sister under my computer there she sings that song oh yeah and she's she was young then but she's 85 years old now she's very young she said he died alone for you and me but he said not my will he yielded to the will of God he added to the will of the father and brother as believers we yield to the will of God we're here we got to make this choice we make this decision that decision what's the will of God in it Yoga is giving I'll tell you in the will of God you give God preeminence amen if it's hearing and seeing things the way that God wants you to see it you're going to give God the preeminence gave Christ a preeminence amen if you've got a right motive and a right objective a meant for the glory of God amen you're giving God preeminence you're giving Jesus preeminence amen praise the name of the Lord and that's not doing a service without his will but according to his will and it's giving is will the preeminence Amen because if you're not giving his will the preeminence then is your it's not true that it's Christ that lives in in you it's not me that lives as Christ lives in me why because I'm not doing my will I'm doing his will that's the evidence that Christ is in me oh I do this I do that I talk this way I act this way amen I react this way react that way oh boy it's not me that's the way Jesus acts that's the way Jesus reacts that's the way Jesus talks and knowing that we're putting the emphasis on the same things that Jesus put his emphasis on and emphasis was on eternity going back to where he come from and the evidence and here when it comes to the the bright brother where the emphasis is on eternity oh damn what do you want time for what do you want stay any longer here for brother when you see all this going on and you experience this you experience that and like I said Lord all praise the Lord I said Lord thank you well I said we're on our way Lord to to the kingdom of God and I said there's nothing negative that there's nothing dark everything is positive I said oh my lord there won't be no evidence of of the sin that was on the earth it'll all be gone nice - thank you Lord I said oh I'm longing for it Lord it'll be gone like negative thoughts negative feelings oh no it'll all be gone if everything will be positive how did oh yeah we're just gonna be Oh hallelujah Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord Amen praise our God praise our God worship worship worship love love law oh yeah as I said brother David I love that place because your travel as a thought now just speak the word Amen now we don't have the travel as a thought and now I'd add we don't even have to speak you just think as you're thinking your heart sorry Amen hallelujah praise the Lord oh and I like that we will talk but we can communicate without talking amen because we all know each other thoughts and yeah yeah that's right brother yeah that's right sister Amen oh that's amazing there be no problems there because there's gonna be no negative thoughts there no sin can you have you considered why the worlds can be like with no sin any bad if you considered the dimension we're going into and there's no sin there's not one iota of sin all gone thank God for such redemption god Elvis I pray our Lord oh my lord that had become more and more real to us but the problem of God has warned us that it's getting to that but at that time and getting to that place in the last days that your faith in God will be challenged and it is being challenged people don't want no real true love it living faith in God just the form of godliness or religion they'll do this too and there's gas getting less and less and less because more and more churches are closing no wonder Jesus said there be no flesh saved that's our bad skin god help us amen God don't let that it doesn't that bit of the world come on you let's stay under the Spirit of Christ under the Spirit of Jesus under the under the Holy Ghost in in this revealed word of this hour a mayor says not let her not dynamic not mechanics but dynamics time yeah back back in 63 and 65 the proud of God recognized said that most of the believers were putting the emphasis on the mechanics and not the dynamics he said considering what God has done he said it ought to put us in the rapture oh yeah man's gonna be without excuse for their lack of faith will he find faith when he comes and only that even back there in the Alpha ministry he said oh ye of little faith and then in the Omega ministry we're saying where is faith and what is faith a faith is the Holy Ghost revelation of God through his word in your heart and and not just the word for yesterday but the word for today what God is doing now amen this is the faith that pleases God you can read Hebrews 11 by faith able to do this by faith he did that it was it was for that day that hour that hour and right on down through but what is the faith that God looking for in you and me grace brother the will of God the will of God is governed by faith controlled by faith amen it is Christ in control and brother if he is in control and if the Holy Ghost is in control if Jesus is in control I'll turn to this brother where we are sacrificing our ideas constantly oh yeah it's an ongoing thing because the enemy is there to bring up your ideas well this this and this and you got a sacrifice amen oh but this appeals to the flesh it appeals to your feelings it appeals to this oh yeah no you got to sacrifice it anything that's appealing to your flesh brother is sin it's gonna take away from our faith you know why because in this our gals looking for absolute perfect thing and he said why you should we need perfect faith for the rapture a man so that it's not your ideas gonna interfere with it your feelings going to interfere with it what you want to do so on naturally no no you're going to give preeminence to the faith of the resurrection the faith of the rapture and again but not many are looking for it not many are living for it not many are praying for it now many are calling for it and brother to get it you've got a call for it you want the resurrection cohort you want the rapture call for not just say well I believe that the seals who gives us the perfect faith for the rapture yeah but is it is it active in you now if it's a perfect faith never dies for a faith will never it will never cease pure faith will be constantly active in your life and in your soul in your spirit amen amen because that's what you're living for praise the Lord it's like I said back to when the revivals were on when they greeted one another was all the lord the lord the lord and i remember being in in church went and went and when I first come to the message I go to the church out there and after church on mine well what about dinner this is why did it matter they never in coming to thoughts although they greet him one another on their way out of the church and then when they got out of the church oh there was there was there's there's somebody there so many there's somebody there somebody there and then we're talking about the word praising the Lord and praying for one another and so on oh it was amazing yeah and that went on for a number of years it did oh yeah I did they praise God they worship God and they were there I said they'd love to see one another old god bless you brother wonderful that you made it god bless your sister wonderful that you made it Amen so on praise the Lord oh I'm glad I'm glad thank the Lord Amen see praise the Lord it's like I told him when they're with me when I preached that first time and you know when he asked for the burns to pray and we all know those that lost that no brother burns nobody it was a quiet brother and a reserved brother but he was spiritual oh yes he was spiritual and he was a wonderful brother and they said oh brother Burns would you pray before we go in just watch the film by brother cater and so on and so brother Browns got off he said well praise the Lord first I said I want to thank the Lord he said for what he's done he said he opened up the way he said for me to get in here tonight because at the time brother Browns was working and he was so many miles but it almost novice hours drive from the church and he said buddy he said I'll have to say it he said but he said was the Lord that opened the way he said if it wasn't the Lord he said wouldn't have been able to make it he said but I thank the Lord and that's when of course the brother started to speak in tongues and that's unusual for him I can assure you that was and then our brother be legen most with seven notes for brother bill for sure and of course he got on and he got up interpreted and it confirmed what I said yeah it says yay that was heard my word my word they God went on and confirmed it confirmed it confirmed a man we were in the spirit everybody was in the spirit we've been into the film praising the Lord a man after the service I said we got his side and still fellowship fellowship fellowship fellowship did met at the time no didn't matter the time not by any means no why because we were anointed with eternity we had the eternal anointing on us it's time meant nothing to us no no not by any means but now here and more more caught up with time than eternity no more conscious of time than eternity oh yeah but the bride is caught up with eternity the eternal revelation of the resurrection rapture so brother he says the prophet said again he said we're putting too much emphasis on the mechanics of the doctrine and the revealed word but not enough he said on the dynamics because he said considering what God has done he said ought to bring the rapture amen so brother god help us to get more and more into the faith that pleases God and brother the more and more we get into faith the more and more that we're sacrificing in our natural lives we're sacrificing our ideas we're sacrificing our opinions a man what for because we want the will of God not our will amen we're sacrificing pride stubbornness oh yes stubbornness we're sacrificing our will for the will of God we're sacrificing our ambitions is not what we want is what God wants Oh humanly we have this ambition I want to do this I want to do they wanted it listen leave it with the Lord listen let's have God's ambitions Amen what is God's ambition right now amen where is God and what is God's ambitions what's what's on God's heart and mind it's all spirit what he wants to do this he wants to do that and I'll tell you this it's nothing out there you know that when he was here in flesh now he saw him no more in the world I'll tell your brother if we have come to that place we are no more in the world and were more conscious of eternity than then time and Jesus was was more conscious of eternity they knew that to brought the Bible highlights that because they knew there was a change in Jesus well when he went from the to the third pull of his ministry he was totally changed and the third pole bought a more and more conscious of eternity not time the kingdom of God not the king of man yeah and that's when he said I am no more in the world then we type of faith hey I am no more in the world are we coming to that thing well I no more in the world what do you mean well I'm more I'm more conscious of spiritual now I'm more conscious of the Lord and with the Lord and the saints of God and and the elect of God not not of this world oh how do you do that how'd you get that well it's Christ in me amen it's the will of God in control a man the will of God in control bringing us to that place to sacrifice our human ambitions what do you love do you love this stuff more than you love God you love this whole world mourn you love the kingdom of God you love the atmosphere here more than you love the atmosphere in the kingdom of God know the saints of God hate this but they love that like God said he said Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated and I check that to go back to the original and I said Lord does that mean Heat and I checked it and it did it did it meant hate why because Esau never had the hunger thirst for the things of God than Jacob did that it did dare Jacob did oh the things of God he just wanted he just wanted the inheritance yes but you know what the inheritance included not just his might his father and mother's wealth and possessions no no but it included a spiritual relationship with God he wrestled with the angel after when he was on his way back and the angel changed his name hallelujah thank God he changed irony huh her mrs. Jesus Christ amen so brother God hated that unbelief we hate unbelief we hate the things that are caught up with this world not the person but the spirit dishonor by the grace of God god help us Lord that we're going to sacrifice possessions and he highlighted for you for you I think the rich young ruler he was caught up with his worldly possessions and I did a lot of believers don't want to make the sacrifice no the more they got the more the better they feel when it comes to worldly possessions especially money yeah and there's heirs Jesus he had nowhere to lay his head amazing and I thought sure it was her - preacher preaching about John the Baptist's he said just think John the Baptist's never had no mansion he had no home you didn't have this he said I guess he said he washed his clothes when they when they turn a different color where he wore them so long so he just grew down into the water and wash them yeah do you just consider the sons and daughters of God and the way they went rather the prophets what they endured what are we enduring amen the stand they took well stand are we taken the attitude they had in the day after the day of Pentecost and down to the church ages oh my brother my brother my brother how many would have this attitude to that sister when they told her that tree she didn't recant they were going to kill her daughter and she said kill her she said we'll meet in glory not many would do that they would try to figure out something to compromise oh I'll do this and I'll do that no she said that's all right you can kill her and she said we'll meet a lot of Revelation of heaven water revelation of eternity hey what faith did that sister hand she said oh I'll meet her in joy and they killed the child and they killed a mother and again also there was a ship coming from England to here I believe and doers into a storm and they didn't know what to do you know and they said to this woman well one person that was on it oh yes the cat remember his name now but he just came here to minister to the Indians in in North America in it and went back home but it was a big storm and he was very nervous he was frightened to death but he said he went down in lower partnership and here was this group of people they're singing and pray and praising the Lord and hey oh what faith and he was praying to God that he would have that pain why they weren't worried they said we were leading them with the Lord amen oh he said wonderful wonderful yeah praise the Lord hallelujah brother god Whitney faith faith not knowledge not ideas faith and faith is in our hearts that's where God is looking for it in our heart not in your head do you have faith in your heart a man so let's sacrifice the time that we need for ourselves let's give it to the Lord we gotta sacrifice ourselves and our past regrets sacrifices you're not going to feel bad about sacrificing these things for the Lord you're gonna feel good because God is gonna bless you with his presence and his anointing because the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart O God thou wilt not despise a man and again as I did with brother marks notes I might print them and give you good copies of them so grace so brother the will of God is what counts in our lives the will of God is the most important thing in our lives by the grace of God there with me number scriptures oh there came then is brethren yeah pay attention to the word there came then is brethren and his mother and standing without sent unto him calling him and the multitude said about him and they said unto Him behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee and he answered them saying who is my mother or my brethren and he looked around about them well who's your mother who's your brothers and sisters Jesus looked around about on them which said about him and said Behold my mother and my brethren amen hallelujah praise the Lord listen for oh so ever shall do the will of God the same is my brother and my sister and my mother hallelujah oh yeah I know some sometimes parents will be it if they're not believers might be Christian with not believers they get jealous yes I had that experience why they said oh you you want to fellowship with you want to go and stay with they call them mr. and mrs. we call them brother and sister burns because they're in the same town and we go out there and that's where we always go where's brother sister Berthe that's where we stayed there's once I do understand we stayed with my natural mother and father but not there wasn't what we just drop him for a visit go on and so on oh yeah and there was jealousy but thank God that as they were nearing the end their their lives they express more and more respect for the ministry I thank the Lord for that amen so I pray God rest their souls but we were going all the time we had the past my natural family went on down to brother sister burns we couldn't wait to get there we loved it amen and and even our daughter Sharon I always look forward to the fellowship at brother sister Burns's Amen so brother whosoever shall do the will of God if his Jesus brother sister and mother it's my brother sister and mother amen those that do the will of God well what about the your natural parents I just committed them to the Lord I prayed for them sure thank God for the expression of their faith as they neared the end of their journey amen so leave that with the Lord all that all that come you know all that the father's give me welcome to me he said I will lose no not them amen praise the Lord just turn with me to Romans chapter 8 they're with me Fuu just for a few moments Romans chapter 8 verse 26 a man likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit of self making intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the hearts known what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God amen so when you pray get in the spirit and rather than then he's going to pray according to the will of God for your life and for other brothers and sisters amen so he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are the called according to his purpose now your purpose God's purpose not my will Lord time be done amen praise the name of the Lord go to Romans chapter 12 hallelujah caught up in the odd took and led Esther praise the Lord verse 1 I beseech you brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God a living sacrifice which is your reasonable amazing reasonable service don't think you're doing something great you're doing what's reasonable which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be he transformed by the renewing of your mind praise the Lord under the control of the Holy Ghost that he may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God alleluia alleluia for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think a man know indeed we're all in the eyes of God we're all sinners saved by grace amen but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith praise the Lord God has dealt to us to measure faith God Elvis that we are surrendered to what he's revealed to us a man and if we surrender we'll come under the will of God a man the leadership of the will of God in our lives again turn with me to Ephesians chapter six there are many many scriptures concerning the will of God showing the importance and the significance of the will of God in our lives in Ephesians six verse five servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto Christ see you're not doing it as unto this one or that one you're doing it unto the Lord right brother Brown see if you're working for the government you're working for the devil that's right no offense to the brothers here but the work you do you do it as unto the Lord and not to the devil a man he said not with eyeservice as men pleasers but as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart amen so are you doing the will of God from your heart a my by the grace of God with good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men again giving the preeminence to God by the grace of God go to 1st Thessalonians chapter 5 first Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 16 said rejoice evermore pray without ceasing and everything give thanks in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you amen and quench not the spirit despise not prophecies prove all things all fast to that which is good and abstain from all appearance of evil and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole heart and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ amen faithful is he that call of you who also will do it a man submitting to the will of God you'll bring it to pass in our lives for the glory of God go to first John chapter 2 a man a man and a man and verse 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever amen eternal life lays in the will of God praise the Lord that grace that we're doing the will of God by the grace of God amen thank the Lord you don't have to turn to it you have need of patience that after yes you're hearing brother journal you need patience thank the Lord you have needed patience that after he have done the will of God he might receive the promise after you've done the will of God that's Hebrews 10 36 thank God grace amen that we did we are doing the will of God amen praise the Lord one more scripture to see yeah where the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God amen by the going forth of the word and he said if at first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear amazing wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as on to a faithful creator you suffer according to the will of God commit everything to the Lord a man and he'll bless you and he'll encourage you it was in the message I have heard but now I see he said see we don't use the gift of God for commercial he could tell me where it was at but I don't have any need of it I wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him if I had a need of it I believe if I'd asked him he'd tell me but first see your motives and objectives as to being right you have to have reasons for this God don't give you those things just because you ask and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that what is the objective he said to be in the will of God a man that's it brother sister regardless of what you ask God for is it the will of God yes it's going to put you more and more in the will of God well we ask God for what we want is to be more and more and more in the will of God and the bride will be mourn the will of God the closer we get to the change of course we get to the rapture if you want to be well what do you want to be well for if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed this is amazing he said you got to have a right motive right objector to be healed what's the right motive right objective for the glory of God he said not because you want to get better no no is you can be healed and go to hell yeah but if your motive is right your objectives right it's for the glory of God amen and he said what do you want to do with your life when you get healed do you want to serve God more give more to God not there not not the natural life no no you wanting you want to change it to a spiritual life and live for the Lord give premise to him there he said you've got to have a motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of God your motive and objective got to be according to the will of God by the grace of God he said how about the Alaskan earthquake watch Hollywood fall into the sea brother David was mentioning something about an earthquake or something in California and not an earthquake but they're doing something there because of the land of sinking what is it it's the warning to the people you talk about the grace of God he prophesied it prophesied it and when the prophet prophesied it in 1965 I believe or 63 a number of believers left California and moved to Tucson but still there are professing believers in California amazing but we know that California is going down California is going under and it's going to be something like five hundred miles one way 1,500 miles off yeah so I believe it's going to affect even even British Columbia yeah so brother even people that live in California now there's some that live close to the water and they they're putting up brick walls because they feel that the water is rising and they want to keep the water out of their property well the water is not rising the land is going down oh yeah we studied that I brought some of those things out a number of years ago what's going on in California now probably God they take challenge so what the Prophet said to Billy Paul and he said he says you'll be young man he said you you you you see this happen well Billy Paul's in his 80s but they say well he's not a young man I said oh yes he is I said it's the off and he's young I see only about 20 years old in his theophany body and he might be we don't know he might be in his theophany leave his physical body go to the theophany when california goes under that's right brother round saw a young man in division so he might have seen him in another dimension we don't know but again even a young brother Joel Brandt he's going on now for sure that he saw when he was in hospital and he had the dreams even before brother Branham prophesied it he saw California go under he saw the cars going here he saw them going up north to Canada and so on and going to to eastern United States why because he saw that he saw the disaster he said this is going to happen this is going to he saw this this and this and this but when he saw it you and I are witnessing what he saw in the in the natural world the way people are dressing and the way they're acting he was shocked at it because that was on Adam back in his day when he had that dream you know cuz men were men boys were boys girls were girls and women were women you know but what he saw in division he said what's that where's this you know as I said he saw those those uh follows there and and one of the men earrings in and he said earrings because that was on Earl of back then nothing like that and he saw another fella dressed this way then he saw the girls dressed this way then he saw the cars not like the cars that he that he saw in his day Lonnie said what's that and then he said something but the President of the United States and he went over to the newspaper on by a drugstore there and looked at it to prison United States and he looked at the picture he said that's not president he said who in the world is that it could be the president that's there now oh yeah so but when he saw it in the paper back then that's years and years and years ago I got I got a copy a printed copy of his of his testimony but what he saw of course he's gone on now yeah brother Perry green gave me the printed copy of brother Joe Brandt's dreams yeah and it was way back he may be in the 1920s now brother as I said I'm going to go to consider scripture consider prophecy and to see if we can I like how close we are to the end how close we are to the rapture and the resurrection Satan is the god of this world definitely so brother how about the Alaskan earthquake watch all he would fall into the sea he said watch and see if it doesn't he's never told me anything wrong yet and just watch and see if we're not living in closing hours of history no man knows what hour is coming and he said I believe in my present condition if I'm in my right mind if I wasn't a Christian I sure want to be a real Bible Christian not a denominational don't rely upon because you shouted we heard that this morning proved it by the Word of God it's altogether out of the will of God and didn't do a thing but cause death but don't be in the stock be in the life have faith in God a man the Prophet explained about planting a seed well that's good it's planted then it comes on up to stalk but that's good just name wrong with that thank God for the stock then it's leaves well thank God for the leaves and it goes right are not right on up to finally got a got a breakout into seed just like the seed that was planted it's got to come forth at the top and that's where we are now amen what he planted is coming forth amen he said don't rely upon cuz this we heard that this morning but proved it by the word it's all together out of the will of God he said didn't do a thing but caused death so don't be in the stock being the life of faith in God that is the message I have heard but now I see Whitley gone through amen when it comes to the will of God has mentioned many many many times in the scripture and we'll finish with these the prophet of God I lighted the will of God in 1947 a man 72 years ago he said notice that when he said that said he could only speak what God put in his mouth and God told him to send them back Balaam like a lot of Ireland prophets now for money he come back and again and ask him the second time and he went to God again now look there is a perfect will of God and there is a permissive will of God and God permitted His Prophet to go on yet it wasn't his perfect will it was his permissive will and I feel this afternoon is the same thing on working these these miracle lines it is God's maybe permissive will but it's not his perfect will he said you're supposed to take me at my word Amen so brother God brought us to his perfect will in the third pole the old me of the word to give us perfect faith a man he said friends I've got something to say along them after a bit no matter how much faith you have it'll never change the predestinated will of God amen and he talks about Balaam again the Ireland prophet came down to stop Israel and he said we'll get into that and he said out of that fellow a dumb mule had to speak and rebuked Balaam they didn't see the angel but the mule he was writing on did and the mule heard the angel the mule was avoiding the angel three times the angel spoke and Balaam was mad with the be mule and he and he slapped the mule three times under finally the angel went down in the narrow path and stood so the mule certainly couldn't go through and he went up against the wall and he struck Balaam's legs on the wall Balin got vicious and they're finally the mule spoke talk to dr. Beeler amazing just thing God was dealing with this way just stop Balaam but if mule recognize it the animals recognize it but the man didn't a man and the animal was was was in fear of the angel and feared God a man till finally the angel spoke and Balaam song and he was rebuked for for slapping the the donkey he's away have you done this to that donkey he heard my voice and he saw me any any any feared God and so on but he said you never heard me and you never saw me and you didn't fear God and he still didn't fear God a man and he said the a preacher out of the will of God and his mind on money and a mule had to rebuke him brother sister let's get let's get into will of God don't wait for the mule and he said had to rebuke him down there a dumb mule and if God could speak through a dumb mule surely he could talk through a man yes sir amen brother we got to be in the spirit and in the will of God to recognize it in 1955 he said that's what you need a calling back to God and if the Holy Ghost condemned it in the beginning it's the same only goes tonight he doesn't change and the Pentecostal church has let down the burrs and got to start see now he said what we need is an old-fashioned calling back to the presence of God again and you know that's right and he said used to be a long time ago it was different but what's happened he said the reason your cooling off and he said the reason you're getting out of the will of God that's why your cooling off getting out of the will of God he says that's the reason you can't cooperate with one another he said you're putting more attention on your organization then you are to your Lord he says that's exactly right he said I would rather go and have a church with 50 people in the will of God than to go and have 5000 out of the will of God that's right and we've had people lead this church because they preferred bigger churches a man and they've gone and made a number of years ago they left so they could go to a bigger Church why so they could hide among the trees of the garden now they didn't like a ministry that was getting too personal as you know the brother and he's in Alberta now and I trust someday we'll see him again soon but he he's into the church for a number of years and he's a brother that said all he said after brother duro finishes preach and he said the seats are filled with blood because he felt that brother Gerald preached so hard he said everybody was bleeding he's Superman when I finished oh yeah so I prayed the grace of God that that brother come back most of us here knowing anybody is but he's his son will be ministering for us next month amen so the grace of God to him okay I'd rather have a church for 50 people in the will of God than 5000 out of the will of God he said remember he is stumbling and staggering like a shooting in the dark but when a man is really in the will of God and knows his calling he will abide there came was such a person that he was very religious indeed he was just as religious and sincere as abel he worshiped God he had a church he built an altar he made a sacrifice he prayed he worshiped but he was rejected why because it was out of the will of God he refused the will of God religion that Satan's business not to kill the whole thing but to contaminate it so he said notice he said Cain came to worship but he had the wrong seed in him serpent seed the hiss of the serpent at east over him for he was the seed of the woman and he knew the perfect will of God but he refused to do it God's grace that will do the will of God not your will his will he said did you know that Satan knows the will of God but just refuses to do it and notice he had seen God vindicate Abel's message Abel's correct message that God vindicated to be the truth are you drawing now Abel's message had been received and Cain saw it and knew that God had vindicated that message right but he just couldn't do it his pride kept him from it that's right his pride kept him from it he's seen God vindicate the message amen god help us get in the will of God stay in the will of God in all circumstances in all situations seek the will of God by the grace of God not my will father dying be done we thank Jesus for what he said we pray grace to give us the same anointing amen in our circumstance and in our situation we're going to seek the will of God amen
