[33:36] moment of time and a mortal will stand

[33:44] god i trust brother god is giving us
[33:46] that faith and increasing that faith
[33:49] more and more and more if there's
[33:51] anything brother the ministry of the
[33:52] word it's not just to let us know it's
[33:54] the end it does not let us know god did
[33:56] this god did that but what is god doing
[33:59] amen and what does god want you to do
[34:01] what does god want want you to think on
[34:04] him and meditate on oh my and and oh
[34:06] yeah to govern you in these last days
[34:10] brothers not just come to church because
[34:11] oh i'm in the message i'm trying to go
[34:13] into church no no
[34:14] not by any means brother it is a
[34:17] spiritual responsibility that we have
[34:20] brother praise the lord it is not just
[34:22] going to church it's getting ready for
[34:24] the resurrection it is getting ready for
[34:27] the rapture and we what are we going to
[34:29] church for is to hear the word and get a
[34:31] greater and a greater faith for the
[34:33] resurrection a greater and a greater
[34:36] faith for the rapture amen so the old
[34:38] brother with that it'll come to the
[34:40] place where we won't be able to get away
[34:42] from it
[34:42] no no morning noon and night it'll be
[34:45] with us and in us and we'll be
[34:46] constantly looking up looking up amen
[34:49] for the resurrection for the rapture
[34:51] looking for the change amen and brother
[34:54] the more we see going on in the world
[34:56] such as this covenant 19 issue it's not
[34:58] it's just not
[34:59] we don't think about that the way the
[35:01] world thinks about it no but we think
[35:03] about it the way the bible warns us amen
[35:06] concerning these things that are going
[35:07] to come up on the earth oh brother oh my
[35:10] and and just think it's not just
[35:12] newfoundland it's not just canada it's
[35:14] the whole world
[35:15] that's influenced by what is going on in
[35:17] college 19. so brother sister don't take
[35:20] it lightly i i don't think oh that'll be
[35:22] all right that come and it'll it'll go
[35:25] well i'll tell you that if it goes
[35:26] something else is going to follow it
[35:28] and i'll tell you this it's going to get
[35:29] even more serious
[35:31] so brother i i trust as the world gets
[35:33] more and more serious facing what's
[35:35] going on in the world i trust that we're
[35:37] going to get more serious when it comes
[35:39] to the revelation of the word when it
[35:41] comes to what god has reminded us
[35:44] concerning the resurrection and rapture
[35:46] and again the power of god has
[35:47] highlighted the fact concerning the
[35:49] opening of the seven seals the mystery
[35:51] of god he said what is it why has god
[35:53] done all that and why is he doing all
[35:55] this it is he said it is for rapturing
[35:58] faith amen and one of the last messages
[36:00] that the prophet preached he highlighted
[36:02] again concerning what god had done and
[36:04] what god was doing and he said the whole
[36:07] thing is to give us rapturing faith so
[36:09] brothers i trust by the hearing of the
[36:12] word by the ministry of the word that
[36:14] that we're going that the rapture is
[36:16] going to get even more and more and more
[36:18] real to us we just won't be able to
[36:20] shake it we won't be able to get away
[36:22] from it if oh you're a seed of god
[36:24] oh most definitely
[36:26] you won't be able to just go on and
[36:27] think this and think that and just be
[36:29] religious no you're spiritual and if
[36:32] you're spiritual you're caught up with
[36:33] what god is doing
[36:35] or religious or that's what god did and
[36:38] what god will do but brother we need to
[36:40] be spiritual so we identify with what
[36:42] he's doing
[36:43] amen and there's too many as i said
[36:45] around the message now oh yeah oh yeah
[36:48] they're just worshiping now god what god
[36:49] did what god did he said the prophet he
[36:51] did this he did that yeah but what is it
[36:53] accomplishing in you and me
[36:55] amen praise the name of the lord what
[36:58] does it really mean to you and me what
[36:59] effect and what influence is it having
[37:01] on the bride
[37:02] oh brother if if if the brightest has
[37:05] caught it the bride believes it
[37:07] i'll tell you they're bright just
[37:09] looking to get out of here
[37:10] oh yeah
[37:12] well as i said just pray for your family
[37:14] pray for your friends pray for your
[37:15] neighbors leave them with the lord and
[37:17] move on amen because if we're going to
[37:19] say oh i've got to wait for this i got
[37:21] to wait for that no if we're going to
[37:23] take that attitude we'll never get out
[37:25] of here
[37:25] there'll never be a resurrection
[37:27] there'll never be a rapture if we're
[37:29] just thinking oh i'm going to wait i
[37:31] want the lord to wait till this one
[37:33] my son sees this my daughter sees this
[37:35] husband sees this wife sees that you
[37:37] leave it with the lord amen god has
[37:40] given us through the word the ministry
[37:42] of the word and the mystery of god he
[37:44] has given us the responsibility
[37:46] of the resurrection
[37:48] he's given us the responsibility
[37:50] of the rapture and again this confirms
[37:53] what the prophet warned us he said god
[37:55] is waiting on us
[37:57] and the dead in christ are waiting on us
[38:00] and waiting
[38:02] by the grace of god amen
[38:04] so i pray the grace of god brother oh
[38:06] don't let him wait any longer lord we
[38:07] want to get out of here
[38:10] amen and we're longing lord now to get
[38:12] into your presence
[38:13] we've we worship you and we and we've
[38:16] heard about you and we heard the
[38:18] revelation the words you gave us in
[38:20] these last days what you've done in
[38:21] these last days and again lord i pray
[38:23] grace as the prophet challenged us to
[38:26] see the other angel
[38:28] amen
[38:29] oh that people see this angel that angel
[38:31] this one that one william branham but
[38:33] brother who's seeing jesus
[38:35] amen who is seeing jesus i tell you this
[38:38] if there's anyone that is revealed in
[38:41] what god has done through the ministry
[38:43] of a prophet it's jesus
[38:45] amen because even even pentecostals and
[38:48] even others who don't believe this
[38:50] message that they they feel the same
[38:52] thing concerning william brown's
[38:53] ministry they said my
[38:55] even though they disagree with his
[38:57] teachings yet he says when it comes to
[38:59] his ministry and he and his life and the
[39:02] anointing upon him he said oh my he said
[39:04] it's just exactly he said like jesus
[39:07] christ
[39:08] amen oh is it to say the same thing he
[39:11] said that they experienced 2 000 years
[39:12] ago when the word was made flesh and
[39:14] amen to redeem us
[39:16] spiritually amen so the exact same thing
[39:20] brother god did in this hour please i
[39:22] pray grace we're not going to visit
[39:24] i pray grace we haven't missed it
[39:26] amen but brother grace now to the extent
[39:29] that god what god did what god's doing
[39:32] god god will do is revealed in you and
[39:35] me
[39:35] amen and you and me are reflecting it by
[39:38] the grace of god oh yeah that's why the
[39:41] people look at you and our brother
[39:43] jonathan was bringing it out concerning

[39:47] amen
[39:48] because why you're going to live christ

[39:53] reflect like what christ is doing
[39:55] amen and what he will do
[39:57] oh yeah oh praise the name of the lord
[40:00] you go right on back to
[40:01] moses and coming out of egypt and so on
[40:04] what was god doing he had to get
[40:05] involved in that praise the lord he did
[40:08] this he did that amen brother we got to
[40:10] identify with god in the present tense
[40:14] yeah
[40:15] so that all we are so that he he can
[40:17] expect us by grace
[40:20] by grace expect us
[40:22] to be there to do what he's ordained
[40:24] what he's prophesied
[40:25] amen so brother again don't don't let
[40:29] god wait any longer for the resurrection
[40:32] don't let god wait any longer for the
[40:33] rapture i pray grace that's through the
[40:36] ministry of our brother jonathan's word
[40:38] the ministry of the word through our
[40:40] brother jonathan's ministry is going to
[40:42] give us more and more and more
[40:44] resurrection and rapturing faith a
[40:47] greater and a greater revelation of the
[40:49] resurrection a greater revelation of the
[40:51] rapture amen so that now god is making

[44:51] the intellectual letter but you're going

[45:05] no you want to preach what god wants you
[45:06] to preach
[45:07] you want to preach concerning what god
[45:09] is doing so let let god in the present
[45:12] tense of the ministry of our brother
[45:14] jonathan let god in the present tense
[45:17] of the revelation in your heart and in
[45:18] your soul amen
[45:20] praise the lord you're here not because
[45:22] of what he did not because of what he's
[45:24] going to do you're here because of what
[45:25] he's doing
[45:27] you want to identify more and more with
[45:28] what he's doing we are on our way home
[45:32] by the grace of god amen and i'll tell
[45:35] you this i pray grace that we're that we
[45:37] got that attitude jesus said
[45:39] amen
[45:41] concerning getting back

[45:44] he said i want to leave here he said i
[45:46] can't i can't stay here any longer
[45:48] he means that i'm go i'm going
[45:50] and he said no man is ascended up but he
[45:53] that came down even the son of man who
[45:55] is
[45:56] in heaven
[45:57] amen praise the lord i'm sure most
[46:00] didn't understand what he was talking
[46:02] about
[46:03] what son of man who is in heaven
[46:06] you you did they believe he was the son
[46:09] of man amen so brother but he was going
[46:12] by faith and i tell you that dimension
[46:15] was more real to him than this
[46:18] that's why he said i want to get out of
[46:20] here
[46:21] amen he wanted to
[46:23] and brother sister
[46:25] well brother our lord was in in the
[46:27] flesh for 33 years and he gets got to
[46:30] the place after he's in his ministry and
[46:32] he's seen this and he's seen that and he
[46:33] knew what he had to do knew what he had
[46:34] to do let's go do it
[46:36] oh peter tried to stop him
[46:38] oh yeah
[46:40] jesus
[46:41] said well he didn't cut him off he just
[46:43] said get there behind me satan
[46:45] why he wasn't all together rebuking
[46:47] peter it was the spirit on peter
[46:50] it was a spirit you oh i pray grace well
[46:53] we're not going to let that spirit get
[46:54] on us
[46:55] so we're going we're going to watch the
[46:56] emphasis on the negative
[46:58] no let's put emphasis on the positive
[47:00] amen so brother until finally
[47:03] the lord did get peter we just think
[47:06] after all the negative things he dealt
[47:08] with in peter in his ministry but yet
[47:11] when he when he laid down his life
[47:13] picked it up again praise the lord and
[47:15] he came back to fulfill the promise to
[47:17] give us the power the anointing of the
[47:19] life of his blood the baptism of the
[47:20] holy ghost who
[47:22] who was the messenger it was peter
[47:26] would you choose peter
[47:28] i said not many would that god did
[47:31] amen see
[47:34] it's not who you choose who god chooses
[47:36] yes oh we choose this we choose it no no
[47:39] what does god choose
[47:41] amen so we got to cast down
[47:43] our feelings and our thoughts and let's
[47:45] accept the will of god
[47:48] and believe god we'll be ministering
[47:50] tonight through our brother jonathan not
[47:52] not brother jonathan it's the lord
[47:55] using our brother
[47:57] it's the lord ministering to our brother
[47:59] so i pray grace we're going to hear
[48:01] it's just not near brother jonathan
[48:03] let's hear the lord
[48:05] amen and well to hear the lord you have
[48:08] to believe that the lord is ministering
[48:10] through our brother
[48:11] for the amen so just think this keep it
[48:14] in mind
[48:15] because why because we're at the end and
[48:18] what god's going to minister is to give
[48:19] us more and more faith to get us out of
[48:21] here
[48:22] amen
[48:24] he's looking for that generation
[48:26] to get out
[48:27] amen so that he can make a new heaven
[48:30] and a new earth by the grace of
[48:32] god so the lord bless us and again just
[48:35] to say we welcome our sister

[49:02] so oh i got this gray hair but again uh
[49:06] how do you respect to those that would
[49:07] would diet but still the reality is

[49:15] well god doesn't seem to die god sees
[49:17] you god sees you who you are and so on

[49:32] god wants us to be as sons and daughters
[49:35] of god and we're just saying and we'll
[49:37] be brothers and sisters
[49:39] oh yeah
[49:40] brother don't let on the natural
[49:42] relationships
[49:43] overtake your spiritual one
[49:45] no not by any means it's just that the
[49:48] prophet of god said concerning his
[49:49] natural family his natural brothers and
[49:52] sisters and and when they came back to
[49:54] see and see the mother
[49:56] and eventually when the lord took her
[49:58] off the scene and they all came for the
[50:00] funeral oh he said he said we're not
[50:01] going to see each other much more now he
[50:03] said
[50:04] oh yeah may not see them on each other
[50:05] no more
[50:06] why is it because now she's gone and he
[50:09] said we didn't come back for this this
[50:11] we just came back and to see mom and he
[50:14] said we fellowship with each other we
[50:15] met each other oh yeah
[50:17] that was the end of his relationship
[50:19] with his natural family amen and he went
[50:22] and he let go and he got more and more
[50:24] to a greater relationship with his
[50:26] spiritual
[50:27] sons and daughters of god
[50:29] and brothers i know i pray grace don't
[50:32] let the enemy
[50:34] influence us to concentrate more on the
[50:36] natural natural natural no you're
[50:38] leaving with the lord when the enemy
[50:40] says this the enemy says that you say
[50:42] satan get behind me i leave in my my
[50:44] family my sons and daughters husbands
[50:46] wives brothers sisters i'm leaving with
[50:48] the lord and he'll do all things well
[50:51] trust god
[50:53] trust god
[50:54] not trusting them he's trusting god
[50:56] amen
[50:58] brother he knows
[50:59] he's not willing then any should perish
[51:01] so brother if that's god's attitude
[51:03] that's god's spirit we we just say lord
[51:06] i'll leave you with you oh you will love
[51:08] that why because now you're going to

[56:28] that may listen to the recording lord
[56:30] online later
[56:31] lord we pray that lord the seed of your
[56:33] word would find ready ground
[56:36] or prepared ground
[56:38] lord open ground that's ready to bring
[56:40] you forth heavenly father
[56:42] lord set me as aside aside this evening
[56:44] lord just settle me down lord i pray
[56:47] lord may all it's said lord be according
[56:50] to your will to your way lord amen lord
[56:53] may not just be truth but may there be
[56:54] spirit with it lord to quicken it to our
[56:56] lives we pray lord we ask your grace now
[56:59] for this service in jesus christ's name
[57:01] amen amen
[57:03] amen god bless you if you turn the
[57:04] scriptures to galatians chapter four
[57:07] i'm in galatians chapter four
[57:09] i did talk with brother carson earlier
[57:12] this week and he was released to go back
[57:14] to work so he's uh he's doing better for
[57:16] sure sister sharon is still a little
[57:18] under the weather so we want to remember
[57:20] them in prayer amen but if he's back to
[57:22] work that's certainly a good sign and
[57:24] then i think brother bob also mentioned
[57:26] brother jason demars is doing well he
[57:28] sent us a selfie from his hospital bed
[57:30] so if a man does that he's either out of
[57:32] his head or feeling very good so
[57:34] i'm glad glad to hear that certainly the
[57:36] report was not so good a few days ago
[57:38] and the lord has definitely touched him
[57:40] so we're very thankful
[57:41] for that amen galatians chapter 4 verse
[57:44] 1 says now i say that the heir
[57:46] as long as he is a child different
[57:49] nothing from a servant though he be lord
[57:51] of all but is under tutors and governors
[57:54] until the time appointed of the father
[57:57] amen may the lord have a blessing to the
[57:59] reading of his word you may be seated
[58:01] amen we want to continue with our series
[58:02] on thy kingdom come
[58:04] we want to take a title of christ-like
[58:06] young men
[58:07] this is a directed sermon that uh it's
[58:09] kind of hard to to say it's for anybody
[58:11] else but it is for everybody actually in
[58:13] these things and you'll see as we go
[58:15] into this that that while we're talking
[58:16] to the young men today amen we are
[58:19] when we start talking about being
[58:20] christ-like then the principles apply to
[58:22] all of us maybe not exactly in the ex in
[58:25] the same way as they might to the men if
[58:26] you're a woman if you're a young lady if
[58:28] you're an older woman it may not be the
[58:30] exact same way but christ-like is
[58:31] christ-like amen so as we go through
[58:33] this certainly don't just just look to
[58:35] the young men or the the young men to be
[58:37] in the church but look to your own self
[58:38] and see what would apply to you amen
[58:41] but we've we've talked so much about the
[58:44] separation of the roles but we want to
[58:45] look at what the growth of those work
[58:47] looks like what the the the the training
[58:49] of those roles looks like amen you don't
[58:51] just you know because you're a man you
[58:53] become a leader um and it's automatic
[58:55] amen just because you're a man does not
[58:57] mean that you are a great leader that
[58:58] you are a capable leader that you are
[59:00] able to handle authority that you're
[59:02] able to handle the responsibility
[59:04] it's something that has to be trained up
[59:05] into you and then you don't
[59:07] instinctively have it god didn't
[59:08] instinctively give us what we need to
[59:10] help lead our households to help support
[59:12] our wives to help support the local
[59:14] church body it's something that he has
[59:15] to put in you and be quickened by the
[59:17] holy spirit amen jesus said that the
[59:19] holy spirit would lead us into all truth
[59:21] it was something that we were brought
[59:23] into it's not something that is
[59:24] instilled in us instinctively but it's
[59:26] something that has to be grown in our
[59:27] lives amen so as we go through this i
[59:30] want to say this that we are at a time
[59:31] of decision and then we are at a very
[59:33] late time in the time where we have to
[59:35] decide as jesus as joshua said choose
[59:38] you this day whom you will serve and
[59:40] then when we talk to young men that
[59:41] decision has to be made very early
[59:43] otherwise they face quite a few
[59:45] struggles in life everyone does if they
[59:46] don't make the choice early but if if as
[59:48] parents
[59:49] as mothers and fathers if we can make
[59:51] the choice for them to train them up in
[59:53] it and then if they when they come to
[59:55] that age of accountability can make the
[59:56] choice to continue in that training and
[59:58] to submit themselves to the word of god
[1:00:00] and to let the holy spirit lead in their
[1:00:02] lives then we know that they're going to
[1:00:04] be successful amen that they're going to
[1:00:05] be able to do what god has called them
[1:00:07] to do they'll be able to step into their
[1:00:09] their role in the body and in their
[1:00:11] families in these different things
[1:00:13] and then last service we talked about
[1:00:14] the requirement for a man to keep his
[1:00:16] household under the blood and we saw
[1:00:18] that that transitioned after christ that
[1:00:20] he had to have not only the blood keep
[1:00:22] them under the blood of christ but he
[1:00:23] had to have the life token of that blood
[1:00:25] which was the holy spirit amen you
[1:00:26] cannot be a christ you cannot be a
[1:00:28] christian which is christ-like you
[1:00:30] cannot be a christian without christ and
[1:00:32] then you have to have the life of the
[1:00:33] blood in you and that's the holy spirit
[1:00:35] so in order to be a proper leader in
[1:00:37] order to be an authority under the
[1:00:38] scriptures you need to have the holy
[1:00:41] spirit to do it the way god wants you to
[1:00:43] do it amen but the big question is what
[1:00:45] does that look like
[1:00:46] we've got a lot of different opinions
[1:00:47] about what it looks like to have the
[1:00:49] holy ghost we've got a lot of opinions
[1:00:51] about what it means to be going in a
[1:00:53] rapture to be bride ready to be rapture
[1:00:55] ready but we want to look today at maybe
[1:00:57] where some of the rubber meets the road
[1:00:59] things because like i said before we can
[1:01:00] sit here and we can say i know this
[1:01:02] doctrine and that doctrine and i can i
[1:01:04] can i can give you all the truths all
[1:01:06] the mystery truths of the scripture but
[1:01:08] if you can't live it then it doesn't do
[1:01:10] you much good amen so we're talking a
[1:01:12] bit more about living today rather than
[1:01:15] than just something that might be in our
[1:01:16] head remember this growth we're looking
[1:01:18] for is that growth in their leadership
[1:01:21] and again this is very much rubber meets
[1:01:23] the road preaching and you say why do we
[1:01:25] need this we've got the seals are opened
[1:01:27] you know the the book has been opened
[1:01:29] why are we preaching on our rolls well
[1:01:31] here's this enoch before he was raptured
[1:01:33] had one revelation
[1:01:35] what was the revelation that enoch had
[1:01:37] it was that he pleased god and how do
[1:01:39] you please god you please god by being
[1:01:41] in obedience to his word i mean that's
[1:01:44] how we know where we're going to please
[1:01:45] him and so when we look at these things
[1:01:47] in the scripture we don't just want to
[1:01:49] know about god we don't just want to
[1:01:50] know about the mysteries but we want to
[1:01:52] be a mystery we want to be a part of the
[1:01:54] mystery and that is going to be
[1:01:55] expressed in your life and if you can't
[1:01:57] live what you're reading about if you
[1:01:59] can't live what you're you're you're
[1:02:00] being taught then what's the point of it
[1:02:02] amen all it's going to do is is build
[1:02:05] you up in your head is going to give you
[1:02:06] a religious spirit and you're going to
[1:02:07] be of no use to anybody amen but like i
[1:02:10] said last time we want to we don't just
[1:02:12] want to to to have a revelation we want
[1:02:14] to be a revelation and this is a
[1:02:15] revelation of what it looks like to be a
[1:02:17] young man in christ we'll get into the
[1:02:19] young sisters and these different things
[1:02:20] as we go through but the purpose that we
[1:02:22] talk about when it goes through training
[1:02:24] is to do what it's to set a foundation
[1:02:27] it's to set a basis for how you're going
[1:02:29] to live your life it's going to set a
[1:02:30] foundation for what means the most to
[1:02:32] you and to eliminate everything else
[1:02:34] that doesn't and then to stick with the
[1:02:36] things that matter most to stick with
[1:02:37] the things that have been tried and true
[1:02:39] things that have been proven in your
[1:02:40] life and push everything else to the
[1:02:41] side so that you're not building on
[1:02:43] shifting sands but you're building on a
[1:02:45] firm foundation amen
[1:02:46] so that what when satan does come your
[1:02:48] way and he is going to come your way and
[1:02:51] he throws an offer at you when he throws
[1:02:53] a conversation at you because it always
[1:02:54] starts with a conversation doesn't it he
[1:02:56] started a conversation with eve had not
[1:02:59] god said
[1:03:00] right he's going to have conversations
[1:03:02] with you so when he does that you've got
[1:03:04] to be able to throw that right back at
[1:03:05] him and say we're not having this
[1:03:06] conversation i know the road that this
[1:03:08] is going down and we're not even going
[1:03:10] to talk about it i'm going to turn
[1:03:11] around and walk away and you can talk to
[1:03:13] the door i just shut your face amen
[1:03:15] that's what we're looking for is to stop
[1:03:17] him before he can ever get started why
[1:03:19] because the thing that satan comes into
[1:03:21] and this is where we have to watch out
[1:03:22] is that he comes in as an angel of light
[1:03:24] i mean it's not the big bold things i've
[1:03:26] said that we have to look out for it's
[1:03:27] when he comes in and he's posing as
[1:03:29] something that is godly he's posing as
[1:03:31] something that would come from the word
[1:03:33] and then we look in second corinthians
[1:03:35] 11 and paul says this for such are false
[1:03:38] apostles deceitful workers transforming
[1:03:41] themselves into the apostles of christ
[1:03:43] these are people that are making
[1:03:45] themselves to look like they are like
[1:03:46] christ he says and no marvel for satan
[1:03:49] himself is transformed into an angel of
[1:03:53] light therefore it is no great thing if
[1:03:56] his ministers also be transformed as the
[1:03:58] ministers of righteousness whose end
[1:04:01] shall be according to their works amen i
[1:04:03] appreciate what brother ed cater said
[1:04:05] the other night where he said your bible
[1:04:07] he says it ought to be falling apart you
[1:04:09] ought to be taping things back in there
[1:04:11] because you know that bible from front
[1:04:12] to back because if you don't know your
[1:04:14] bible then he's going to have a heyday
[1:04:16] with you satan's going to have a heyday
[1:04:17] with you you say i know all the messages
[1:04:19] guess what if you know the messages but
[1:04:21] you don't know the bible that it draw us
[1:04:23] back to then you're going to get into
[1:04:24] problems as well because how many
[1:04:26] offshoots have we seen in the message
[1:04:28] because people started reading the
[1:04:29] message books and they didn't stick with
[1:04:30] their bible and then they didn't take it
[1:04:32] back from genesis to revelation when
[1:04:34] satan comes to jesus what did he test
[1:04:36] him with
[1:04:37] he tested him with the word he brought
[1:04:39] the word what did he say to eve had not
[1:04:41] god said he comes with the word and what
[1:04:43] we're looking for is to rightly divide
[1:04:45] by what the full word not just the
[1:04:47] partial word because satan's
[1:04:49] conversations are usually snippets of
[1:04:51] scripture without context and he never
[1:04:53] reads the full verse he never reads the
[1:04:55] full chapter and he never takes it all
[1:04:56] the way from genesis to revelation so
[1:04:58] you've got to realize what satan looks
[1:05:00] like when he comes in and as we start
[1:05:02] talking to the young men tonight they've
[1:05:03] got to see where the traps are laid
[1:05:05] they've got to see what it's going to
[1:05:06] look like when he's offering them
[1:05:07] something and if satan offers it he's
[1:05:09] going to make it if that's a good young
[1:05:11] man if that's a godly young man if
[1:05:12] that's a man of the holy ghost he's
[1:05:13] going to try and base it on scripture
[1:05:15] but it's going to be out of context it's
[1:05:16] not going to be the fullness of it amen
[1:05:18] amen the most deceitful thing that i
[1:05:20] know is a religious spirit because it
[1:05:22] gives you the appearance of god without
[1:05:24] the power and the life of god and so it
[1:05:26] always fails and never brings forth
[1:05:27] fruit but it'll keep you chasing fruit
[1:05:29] for years and years and years until you
[1:05:30] recognize that that wasn't god that was
[1:05:32] satan trying to trick you amen
[1:05:35] brother braham said this he said and the
[1:05:37] antichrist spirit is a religious spirit
[1:05:39] don't forget that dear people and how
[1:05:42] blessed are your eyes that do see and
[1:05:44] hear and understand for you cannot
[1:05:47] understand unless god reveals it to you
[1:05:49] amen we've got to have god on the inside
[1:05:50] to do this because otherwise we can't
[1:05:52] even see the kingdom of heaven jesus
[1:05:53] said
[1:05:54] he said the antichrist spirit is
[1:05:56] religious jesus said it'd be so close
[1:05:59] it'd deceive the very elect if possible
[1:06:02] amen amen
[1:06:05] remember satan is working within the
[1:06:06] very framework of the church
[1:06:09] amen we do not look outside to see
[1:06:10] satan's moving we look to see him moving
[1:06:12] in here because that's what that's what
[1:06:14] we've been warned about is that he's
[1:06:15] moving within the framework and we even
[1:06:17] see that satan sits within the church
[1:06:19] being worshipped as god
[1:06:21] amen now that means that could happen
[1:06:23] literally in this church doesn't matter
[1:06:24] how good the ministry is and how
[1:06:25] straight they are you can put a man in
[1:06:27] the position of god and then you end up
[1:06:29] worshiping satan or you can ignore the
[1:06:31] word coming forth and now you're
[1:06:32] worshiping satan again because you've
[1:06:33] rejected the word and there's only one
[1:06:35] thing left and that's antichrist amen
[1:06:37] it's anti-word every time
[1:06:38] so the discernment is always with what
[1:06:40] the full word you've got to take the
[1:06:42] full word and if you only take a portion
[1:06:44] of it you're always going to fail you
[1:06:45] need all of the points from genesis to
[1:06:47] revelation to get through it amen
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:53] now brother ed cater mentioned the
[1:06:55] threefold purpose of god was in having
[1:06:57] the preeminence in his bride and i want
[1:06:59] to read a quote to you because this is
[1:07:01] where we're talking about the the thy
[1:07:03] kingdom come
[1:07:04] and we want to see that these things are
[1:07:06] based on scripture amen not just quotes
[1:07:08] but this is a good it's a good quote to
[1:07:10] set us up and he said he's talking about
[1:07:12] the threefold purpose he says first it
[1:07:13] was to express himself completely god in
[1:07:15] christ second to have the preeminences
[1:07:18] by this in his church which is his body
[1:07:21] the bride till he could have the
[1:07:23] preeminence to express himself through
[1:07:26] them the preeminence to the point where
[1:07:28] he could express himself through us
[1:07:30] so when we talk about christ like men
[1:07:32] when we talk about christ like women
[1:07:34] that's going to look like christ
[1:07:35] expressing himself through us it's not
[1:07:37] just going to look like it it's going to
[1:07:38] be it amen is christ expressing himself
[1:07:41] through us he says all right and thirdly
[1:07:43] to restore the kingdom to its rightly
[1:07:46] position that fell by sin by the first
[1:07:48] adam back to where he walked in the cool
[1:07:50] of the evening with his people and
[1:07:52] talked with them and fellowship with
[1:07:54] them amen we're preaching on thy kingdom
[1:07:56] come and he's saying before the kingdom
[1:07:58] can come before the kingdom can be
[1:08:00] restored something's got to happen and
[1:08:02] that's that the preeminence has to be
[1:08:04] given to god in our lives the
[1:08:05] preeminence of the word has to be above
[1:08:07] everything else in our lives amen so
[1:08:10] what does the preeminence look like if
[1:08:12] you say i've got the preeminence of the
[1:08:13] word in my life if the holy spirit has
[1:08:15] the preeminence in my life how do we
[1:08:16] know it how do we know that it's true
[1:08:19] how can we confirm to ourselves that
[1:08:20] it's true i'm not so worried so much
[1:08:22] about proving it to you but i need to
[1:08:24] prove it to myself tonight amen i want
[1:08:26] to know that the word has a preeminence
[1:08:27] in us amen and it's has preeminence when
[1:08:30] that's how we live our life when our
[1:08:32] decisions are made by it when our
[1:08:34] thinking is according to it and the way
[1:08:36] that we make our decisions it follows
[1:08:37] all the way through with the word amen
[1:08:39] that we don't just say it but we do it i
[1:08:41] was listening to the god has only one
[1:08:44] way provided for anything where brother
[1:08:45] brahm says he says you can read the
[1:08:47] bottle
[1:08:48] you can read the the instructions and
[1:08:50] the details on the pill bottle he says
[1:08:52] but if you don't take it it doesn't do
[1:08:53] you any good right you can't have the
[1:08:55] preeminence just by reading it and
[1:08:57] saying i believe it he says you've got
[1:08:59] to put it in you and then if you're just
[1:09:01] reading it it's not doing you any good
[1:09:03] you know all about what it can do but
[1:09:05] until it has the preeminence until it's
[1:09:07] a part of you it can't do you any good
[1:09:09] you've got to take the pill amen and
[1:09:10] that's how you know it has the
[1:09:11] preeminence is when you take the pill of
[1:09:13] the word and you put it in your life and
[1:09:15] you say i won't take anything else but
[1:09:16] this i'm feeding on the body word of the
[1:09:18] son of man as brother branham said amen
[1:09:22] so we're talking about men and women and
[1:09:23] that covers the full spectrum spectrum
[1:09:25] of god's family amen you have men and
[1:09:27] you have women and when we go into this
[1:09:29] we want to see that the preeminence is
[1:09:31] there and we want to see what it means
[1:09:32] for men and we want to see what it means
[1:09:34] for a woman amen now some of this may
[1:09:36] sound legalistic
[1:09:38] and guess what where the scriptures are
[1:09:40] black and white we want to be legalistic
[1:09:42] why there is no variance there amen if
[1:09:44] you look at marriage and divorce there's
[1:09:46] only a few things that allow you to be
[1:09:47] divorced and everything outside of that
[1:09:49] you're not supposed to do it amen and
[1:09:51] there's lots of things in the scripture
[1:09:52] that are black and white and so we want
[1:09:53] to say where it's black let it be black
[1:09:55] and where it's white let it be white but
[1:09:57] let's not make it gray because it makes
[1:09:59] us uncomfortable amen let's not make it
[1:10:01] gray because it's easier if we don't do
[1:10:03] that amen but let's look at ourselves in
[1:10:04] the word and say if the word says it
[1:10:06] then be it unto me according to thy word
[1:10:08] and trust that god will back it up if
[1:10:10] we'll only line up with it amen
[1:10:12] and this is going to help us moving
[1:10:14] forward because guess what it's not
[1:10:15] going to get easier and then it's going
[1:10:17] to get harder it's going to get tougher
[1:10:19] and the young men are going to have to
[1:10:21] lead the way and then the young men are
[1:10:23] going to have to be able to stand on the
[1:10:24] word and know that no matter what the
[1:10:26] world says the word is always going to
[1:10:29] be true and every other word is going to
[1:10:30] be a lie amen they've got to know that
[1:10:32] god is real in their lives amen
[1:10:36] let's take it back to the idea of
[1:10:37] training proverbs 22 6 says train up a
[1:10:40] child in the way he should go and when
[1:10:42] he is old he will not depart from it now
[1:10:45] we use this scripture as one for all of
[1:10:47] children but it actually when it says he
[1:10:49] and when it says child it's speaking of
[1:10:50] a young boy it's speaking of a lad it is
[1:10:52] actually speaking of the young men i
[1:10:54] mean it's teaching about the males here
[1:10:56] and it's not that the women don't matter
[1:10:58] but the idea is that if you don't get
[1:11:00] the leadership right then everything
[1:11:01] under that authority of that leadership
[1:11:03] is going to fail so he's saying focus on
[1:11:05] the met young men here make sure they're
[1:11:07] raised right and then they'll
[1:11:08] disseminate that down through the ranks
[1:11:10] of their authority amen so we ought to
[1:11:12] be training our young men we ought to be
[1:11:13] training our young boys from the
[1:11:16] earliest age what it means to be a true
[1:11:18] man of god and then we ought to be
[1:11:20] teaching them by not just word but also
[1:11:22] by our example by letting them in on the
[1:11:24] decisions we make by sharing the things
[1:11:26] we go through right by letting them see
[1:11:28] that this is what is in front of us and
[1:11:31] this is how we're making the decision
[1:11:32] and it's not because it's easier but
[1:11:34] it's because that's what god tells us to
[1:11:35] do amen and if we can show them first by
[1:11:38] example what we do and then follow it up
[1:11:40] with thus saith the word then they'll
[1:11:42] put the two together and then when they
[1:11:44] see the word being vindicated in your
[1:11:45] life then they'll start to realize hey
[1:11:48] there's something to this this isn't
[1:11:49] just a religion this isn't just a way of
[1:11:51] life but this is life itself and that's
[1:11:54] what we need to have in our lives amen
[1:11:56] we want to have something that is
[1:11:57] anchored that is steadfast and sure and
[1:11:59] if they can see it in our lives first
[1:12:01] and then our word second then we know
[1:12:02] that they're gonna have a good chance to
[1:12:04] come up and be what they're supposed to
[1:12:05] be amen
[1:12:07] but then after that they've got this
[1:12:08] transition point and as they come into
[1:12:10] their late teens and their early 20s for
[1:12:12] certain as they start to finish school
[1:12:14] as they start to get a job as they start
[1:12:16] to buy a car as they supposed to have
[1:12:17] their own their own free time maybe they
[1:12:19] move out and get their own place what
[1:12:21] they've got to start making decisions
[1:12:22] for themselves they've got to be able to
[1:12:24] say this is how i'm going to spend my
[1:12:26] time this is the sort of entertainment
[1:12:27] i'm going to allow these are the sort of
[1:12:29] electronics i'm going to have in my life
[1:12:30] these are the sort of friends i'm going
[1:12:32] to have these are the hobbies i'm going
[1:12:33] to have am i going to attend church
[1:12:35] regularly or am i not what kind of girls
[1:12:37] am i going to see what am i going to
[1:12:39] prioritize in my life right now and as
[1:12:41] we come into that transition point we
[1:12:43] want them to be transitioning into what
[1:12:45] true sons of god and may we want them to
[1:12:47] transition into a role that fulfills
[1:12:50] not only themselves but it helps out the
[1:12:52] local body and in time perhaps would
[1:12:54] even help their own family as they would
[1:12:55] start one of their own amen why they are
[1:12:58] part of the church and the church means
[1:13:00] called out ones god doesn't call us out
[1:13:02] for no reason but he calls us out for a
[1:13:04] purpose and because of that purpose he
[1:13:06] requires a training time amen and so
[1:13:08] that's what we see with the young men is
[1:13:09] that they have to go through a training
[1:13:11] time before they can ever be of any real
[1:13:13] use in the local body
[1:13:15] now the greatest example of this i think
[1:13:16] is found in timothy i mean you can see
[1:13:18] it through the lives of people you can
[1:13:20] see it through joseph god certainly went
[1:13:22] put him through a set of trials we see
[1:13:24] it through david the testing that he
[1:13:25] went to but if we come into the new
[1:13:27] testament we've got a new order because
[1:13:29] and we'll see this more as we get into
[1:13:31] the sisters in the old testament the
[1:13:33] sisters didn't have quite the role that
[1:13:34] they have in the new testament but in
[1:13:36] the the males have kind of had the same
[1:13:38] role all the way through and so we can
[1:13:39] look at the old testament the new
[1:13:40] testament and it's fairly simple but
[1:13:42] paul gives us a lot of instruction on
[1:13:44] how it's supposed to be amen in the in
[1:13:46] the old testament we see the types and
[1:13:48] shadows in the new testament we see the
[1:13:49] words that confirm how they got to where
[1:13:51] they are amen so let's look at first
[1:13:53] timothy verse four
[1:13:56] first timothy verse four or first
[1:13:58] timothy 4 verse 1 says now the spirit
[1:14:00] speeches speaketh expressly
[1:14:03] this is not a random thing this is this
[1:14:06] is a specific message that in the latter
[1:14:09] times some shall depart from the faith
[1:14:11] so it's talking about the end time now
[1:14:13] now paul's talking to timothy for his
[1:14:14] life right now but this is also a
[1:14:16] message to us today because what we're
[1:14:19] in the latter times right we're in the
[1:14:21] end now so this is where this scripture
[1:14:23] is being fulfilled in its greatest in
[1:14:25] its greatest portion that in the latter
[1:14:27] times some shall depart from the faith
[1:14:29] giving heed to seducing spirits a
[1:14:32] seducing spirit is one that says what
[1:14:33] you want to hear
[1:14:35] and doctrines of devils and that's the
[1:14:37] men's ideas amen it's not anointing it's
[1:14:39] not the anointing of the holy spirit but
[1:14:41] it is the anointing of satan upon them
[1:14:43] amen the doctrines of devils notice like
[1:14:45] we said before the antichrist spirit is
[1:14:48] religious
[1:14:49] amen it is not political it is religious
[1:14:53] it says speaking lies in hypocrisy that
[1:14:55] means they're telling you a lie
[1:14:57] willfully they know it's not true but
[1:14:59] they're saying it's true because it
[1:15:01] benefits them not you
[1:15:03] having their conscience seared with a
[1:15:04] hot iron in other words when they go to
[1:15:07] this point the word doesn't have an
[1:15:08] effect on them and because they've
[1:15:10] rejected it now they actually get to the
[1:15:12] point where they start to believe what
[1:15:13] they say and they preach it as if it is
[1:15:16] the truth they get to the point where
[1:15:18] they believe their own lies amen they
[1:15:20] are self-deceived
[1:15:22] and then paul continues in a few
[1:15:24] different things but if we drop down to
[1:15:25] verse 12 he says this amazing thing he
[1:15:28] says timothy let no man despise thy
[1:15:31] youth
[1:15:32] now i have heard this scripture quoted a
[1:15:34] bazillion times by young people and they
[1:15:37] say hey don't despise my youth i might
[1:15:39] be young but paul says that we've got a
[1:15:41] purpose and we've got something that we
[1:15:43] can offer and you shouldn't look down
[1:15:45] upon us
[1:15:46] now that's a great idea but let's read
[1:15:48] the rest of the scripture
[1:15:49] amen he says let no man despise thy
[1:15:52] youth
[1:15:53] because what we want to be on the front
[1:15:54] lines we know so much we've been raised
[1:15:57] right we've been under great ministries
[1:15:58] we've got great parents we've got
[1:16:00] something to offer we've got passion
[1:16:01] we've got energy young people have
[1:16:03] energy don't they and they have passion
[1:16:06] you know what they don't have
[1:16:09] well
[1:16:11] they're usually right here
[1:16:13] amen amen
[1:16:14] i i speak as an experienced young person
[1:16:17] amen right here you usually don't have
[1:16:20] that
[1:16:21] what you have is
[1:16:24] worldly knowledge
[1:16:25] and you have word knowledge that hasn't
[1:16:28] been proven through faith yet and so
[1:16:30] you've got lots of ideas and you've got
[1:16:32] all this energy and you think you're
[1:16:34] ready to go to here but you've got to go
[1:16:36] through the stature of a perfect man
[1:16:37] you've got to be built up into this the
[1:16:39] way everyone else does and i i think i
[1:16:41] can conclusively say that almost every
[1:16:43] young person thinks they know more than
[1:16:45] they do and they think they know how to
[1:16:47] apply it better than they do and i say
[1:16:48] that because that's what i thought
[1:16:51] that's what i thought
[1:16:52] and it only takes you some time to get
[1:16:54] into a situation where you have to apply
[1:16:56] it and all of a sudden you realize whoa
[1:16:58] i have no clue
[1:17:00] what's going on here and why isn't this
[1:17:02] going the way i thought it was going to
[1:17:03] go and it's because you don't have any
[1:17:05] wisdom to go with your knowledge i mean
[1:17:07] you haven't been trained yet but you're
[1:17:09] thinking you can apply it's like a young
[1:17:10] engineer going in and he wants to be the
[1:17:12] chief engineer of the firm he can't do
[1:17:13] it because he has all of the knowledge
[1:17:15] the chief engineer might have in many
[1:17:17] ways but he lacks the experience to
[1:17:19] apply what he's learned in a way that
[1:17:20] will achieve the results that they want
[1:17:22] amen
[1:17:23] so paul says let no man despise their
[1:17:25] youth thy youth but he says but be thou
[1:17:30] an example of the believers in word in
[1:17:34] conversation in charity in spirit in
[1:17:37] faith and impurity now the amplified
[1:17:40] says let no one despise or think less of
[1:17:42] you because of your youth and all the
[1:17:44] young people said praise the lord and
[1:17:45] then he says but be an example a pattern
[1:17:49] for the believers in speech in conduct
[1:17:53] in love in faith and impurity so in
[1:17:57] other words let your life contradict
[1:18:00] your youth
[1:18:01] let the life that you live let the words
[1:18:04] that you speak let the way that you do
[1:18:06] things contradict the fact that you're a
[1:18:08] young person let your maturity be there
[1:18:11] that they would see that and in that
[1:18:12] maturity in that consistency and that
[1:18:15] stability then they would say this is
[1:18:18] somebody that actually has maybe a bit
[1:18:20] of what they're talking about he's
[1:18:22] saying don't let them look down on you
[1:18:24] and don't let them do it by showing them
[1:18:26] that your life is different than a
[1:18:27] typical young person that you aren't so
[1:18:30] caught up in yourself but rather that
[1:18:32] you are proving yourself by the life
[1:18:34] that you live that you're not just a
[1:18:36] head full of words but rather that
[1:18:38] you've got the holy spirit inside you
[1:18:39] that is making those words live
[1:18:42] amen now he's speaking to timothy but by
[1:18:44] no means is this only for timothy now
[1:18:46] timothy we know is a minister as well
[1:18:48] this isn't just for ministers it's not
[1:18:49] just for young men but it's for every
[1:18:51] young person is let yourself be an
[1:18:53] example for the believers in your life
[1:18:56] and let that be something that says hey
[1:18:59] that young person can be of you of use
[1:19:01] amen contradict your youth with your
[1:19:04] life
[1:19:05] and show that you've got the maturity
[1:19:06] that they're looking for amen because
[1:19:08] why the scriptural principle is that
[1:19:10] you've got to be proven before you can
[1:19:13] be trusted with responsibility you have
[1:19:15] to be proven that you've got what's
[1:19:17] required before you can get the job
[1:19:19] now the problem is this is that guess
[1:19:21] what we don't have to wait on god to get
[1:19:24] married do we i could you know somebody
[1:19:26] can go get a wife tomorrow and get
[1:19:28] married that doesn't mean god says
[1:19:29] they're ready that means they wanted to
[1:19:31] get married and they got married but if
[1:19:32] you wait on god's time then god will
[1:19:34] prepare you for marriage and when you're
[1:19:36] ready then he'll give you a wife or
[1:19:38] he'll give you a husband but if you go
[1:19:40] ahead and do it yourself now you're in
[1:19:41] the school of hard knocks because you've
[1:19:42] jumped ahead of his time and you've
[1:19:44] jumped into a responsibility for which
[1:19:46] you don't have the experience amen you
[1:19:48] don't have the proof in your life
[1:19:50] amen you can have every great spiritual
[1:19:52] gift you could be a prophet ordain from
[1:19:54] before the foundation of the world but
[1:19:55] until you get the proof in your life
[1:19:57] until you get the character and the
[1:19:58] experience to show that god is working
[1:20:00] in you you can be of no use to the local
[1:20:01] body or to anybody
[1:20:03] if we can put it that way amen
[1:20:05] so this is what he says to timothy says
[1:20:08] timothy let no man despise our youth but
[1:20:10] do this be an example in your life to
[1:20:13] all of the believers
[1:20:15] all of the believers amen not just to
[1:20:17] the young people your age not just just
[1:20:18] the ones below you but be an example to
[1:20:20] the ones above show your consistency and
[1:20:22] let them see it and timothy is no doubt
[1:20:24] saying how long how long do i do this
[1:20:26] for paul
[1:20:27] he says
[1:20:29] till i come
[1:20:31] give attendance to reading to
[1:20:34] exhortation and to doctrine
[1:20:37] neglect not the gift that is in thee
[1:20:39] which was given thee by prophecy with
[1:20:41] the laying on of the hands of the
[1:20:42] presbytery so he's acknowledging that
[1:20:44] there's a gift and a call in timothy's
[1:20:46] life but he says timothy don't you dare
[1:20:49] use it
[1:20:50] you
[1:20:51] what prove yourselves go read your word
[1:20:54] get into the word get your doctrine
[1:20:57] sound listen be taught now he says you
[1:21:00] can exhort we ought to be able to exhort
[1:21:02] a man that's got the holy ghost should
[1:21:03] be able to exhort he should be able to
[1:21:04] witness to somebody of what god's doing
[1:21:06] in his life but he doesn't say timothy
[1:21:08] get up there and preach buddy
[1:21:10] he laid hands on him he laid hands on
[1:21:12] him he ordained timothy himself this is
[1:21:14] this is paul's protege here but yet he
[1:21:17] says wait till i come
[1:21:19] don't you dare start down this path even
[1:21:21] though i've ordained you don't you start
[1:21:23] preaching just yet but you need to sit
[1:21:25] down for a while and prove yourself to
[1:21:27] the people so that when you do get up
[1:21:29] they'll receive what you say
[1:21:30] amen
[1:21:32] he says meditate upon these things give
[1:21:36] thyself holy to them
[1:21:39] give everything you've got to this
[1:21:40] timothy let this be your focus for the
[1:21:42] next little while is these things that
[1:21:44] i'm telling you about and don't focus on
[1:21:46] anything else but focus on living the
[1:21:48] life and getting into the word amen and
[1:21:51] that's the only thing that he wanted him
[1:21:52] to do
[1:21:53] meditate upon these things give thyself
[1:21:54] holy to them why
[1:21:56] that thy profiting may
[1:21:58] appear to all so that everyone can see
[1:22:02] what's happening in your life so that
[1:22:04] everyone can see that there's been a
[1:22:05] change in timothy
[1:22:07] that timothy is acting different that
[1:22:09] timothy's living different that
[1:22:10] timothy's talking different that
[1:22:12] timothy's got a different attitude and
[1:22:14] an approach and hey that's a good young
[1:22:16] man now amen
[1:22:18] it reminds me of when they when jesus
[1:22:20] said to them he says go and tarry in
[1:22:22] jerusalem
[1:22:23] what do you tell him to do terry wait
[1:22:25] wait timothy what are you going to do
[1:22:27] i'm going to wait i'm going to tarry
[1:22:29] paul until you come and tell me that i'm
[1:22:31] ready to go
[1:22:32] amen i'll respect what you see what
[1:22:34] you've said to me amen the same thing we
[1:22:37] see that uh that moses told to joshua
[1:22:39] that joshua told the young told the
[1:22:41] children of israel was what meditate on
[1:22:43] the law of moses meditate on the word
[1:22:45] get into it and keep it on your lips
[1:22:47] keep it in your mouth amen eat it drink
[1:22:49] it live it sleep it let it be every part
[1:22:52] of you and when that's there then what
[1:22:55] the propheting appears to all when you
[1:22:57] give everything holy over to the word to
[1:22:59] the instruction of god it's going to
[1:23:01] have an effect in your life amen there's
[1:23:02] going to be fruit that's coming forth
[1:23:04] and people are going gonna say he ain't
[1:23:06] the way he used to be she ain't the way
[1:23:08] she used to be praise the lord he's
[1:23:10] moving amen now we've got another young
[1:23:12] person that we can come up and can be a
[1:23:13] pillar in the church and can raise a
[1:23:15] good family and we can trust to get up
[1:23:17] behind the pulpit and preacher can lead
[1:23:19] songs or can help with the young people
[1:23:21] or we can trust them to to marry our
[1:23:23] daughters or marry our sons in these
[1:23:24] different things amen what that we can
[1:23:26] see that the character of christ is
[1:23:28] being molded through and into them and
[1:23:30] it's appearing to all and we say wow god
[1:23:33] is really moving in that young person's
[1:23:34] life
[1:23:35] amen
[1:23:38] amen why you've got to be able to see
[1:23:40] that take what you believe is true apply
[1:23:42] it in your life and pull it all the way
[1:23:44] through and see if it bears the fruit
[1:23:45] that you thought it was going to bear
[1:23:46] because if it doesn't bear the fruit of
[1:23:48] the holy spirit it wasn't the holy
[1:23:49] spirit that you were feeding on it
[1:23:50] wasn't the true word that you're feeding
[1:23:52] on and something's injected itself in
[1:23:54] there amen
[1:23:55] there's a reason why a young man isn't
[1:23:57] allowed to be a pastor you remember why
[1:23:59] because he gets caught up in himself
[1:24:01] right
[1:24:02] amen
[1:24:03] starts thinking of something because he
[1:24:05] has a position
[1:24:06] can't do it brother braham says this he
[1:24:08] says god has a hard time trying to get
[1:24:10] somebody that he can deal with that'll
[1:24:12] stay humble
[1:24:14] and meek and stay in the place until god
[1:24:17] calls him to do something a man that god
[1:24:20] can bless and he'll still keep himself a
[1:24:23] man not be an angel or a god and that
[1:24:26] can be hard not only for the man but
[1:24:28] those that are around that man you see
[1:24:30] great gifts within the ministries and
[1:24:31] all of a sudden people are just latched
[1:24:33] on to them aren't they that's real hard
[1:24:35] it's real hard for a man to keep himself
[1:24:37] from getting prideful in those
[1:24:38] situations amen but if he if he's
[1:24:40] truthful and he's honest he'll say this
[1:24:42] isn't me it's god anyways what do i have
[1:24:43] anything to be proud of
[1:24:45] as soon as man gets blessed and has a
[1:24:47] little something given to him he wants
[1:24:49] to become a god he wants to become an
[1:24:52] angel he wants to become some great
[1:24:54] person what i do what me and me and mine
[1:24:57] all that that's the wrong attitude god's
[1:25:00] hunting for somebody who he could bless
[1:25:02] and pour out the blessings and the more
[1:25:05] he blessed the literal the the littler
[1:25:08] the man will become amen can we say lord
[1:25:11] may that be us amen i saw something
[1:25:13] where brother braham says you don't need
[1:25:15] more gifts he says you've had enough
[1:25:17] gifts he says you need to humble
[1:25:18] yourself and what let the giver come
[1:25:20] into you amen let god express himself
[1:25:22] through you throw the gifts away and get
[1:25:24] the giver inside of you amen and then
[1:25:26] the gifts will be put in their place if
[1:25:27] you need them
[1:25:29] he says and you'll never get more of god
[1:25:31] until you become nothing you've got to
[1:25:34] belittle yourself belittle yourself you
[1:25:36] know what that means i am nothing i am
[1:25:40] nothing i have nothing of worth and it's
[1:25:43] only his grace and his anointing that'll
[1:25:45] make anything that i do to be worthwhile
[1:25:48] in the kingdom of god amen you've got to
[1:25:50] belittle yourself he that will exalt
[1:25:52] himself god will bring a base he that
[1:25:55] will humble himself god will exalt
[1:25:57] you've got to get little before you can
[1:25:59] get big and you'll never be big in your
[1:26:02] own self you'll only be as big as god
[1:26:05] will be big in you
[1:26:08] hallelujah if we could get to the point
[1:26:10] that we are so small that god could be
[1:26:12] magnified in us amen if we could make
[1:26:14] our thinking if we could make our
[1:26:16] education if we could make our opinions
[1:26:18] even our gifts itself and say this is
[1:26:20] nothing without you lord may you take us
[1:26:23] and may you use us amen amen amen what
[1:26:26] is it you've got to prove that you've
[1:26:27] got the goods in your own life before
[1:26:29] you try and get somebody else get the
[1:26:30] goods in their life and then you can't
[1:26:32] offer somebody something that you don't
[1:26:34] have already and then it's got to be
[1:26:36] proven by application and by experience
[1:26:38] amen i can talk a good talk and i can
[1:26:40] preach a good sermon but if i can't
[1:26:42] leave it live it why would anybody
[1:26:43] listen to me amen why would i be up here
[1:26:46] if at least somebody here didn't think
[1:26:47] that i was a true christian
[1:26:49] why because i'd have no effect
[1:26:51] and then when i fall and when i
[1:26:53] disappoint that's the strong that's the
[1:26:54] hardest part for the people is because
[1:26:56] all of a sudden they realize hey he's
[1:26:58] still he's still human
[1:27:00] i don't think anybody was worried that i
[1:27:01] wasn't human by any means but what it's
[1:27:03] the humanity bleeds through sometimes
[1:27:05] isn't it amen god's grace to you and
[1:27:07] god's grace to me when those things
[1:27:08] happen
[1:27:09] amen that i would humble myself amen
[1:27:12] what is it we've got this idea of an
[1:27:14] influencer today
[1:27:15] and now the old people older older
[1:27:18] people probably don't know much about
[1:27:19] this but the young people know all about
[1:27:20] tick tock they know all about instagram
[1:27:23] and they know all about facebook and
[1:27:24] what do they have on those platforms
[1:27:26] they have influencers don't they they
[1:27:28] have people that present something to
[1:27:30] everybody else and the intent is to make
[1:27:32] money off of them get them to buy
[1:27:34] something somehow build up their
[1:27:37] reputation build up their business build
[1:27:39] up their persona build up whatever it is
[1:27:42] they're offering at the expense of you
[1:27:44] and anybody can be an influencer today
[1:27:47] you don't actually have to be rich to
[1:27:48] pretend you're rich on there they
[1:27:50] actually have sets that they rent out by
[1:27:52] the hour that looks like the inside of
[1:27:54] private jets of mansions they have fancy
[1:27:58] cars that you can pose next to all that
[1:28:00] fake champagne bottles that cause you
[1:28:02] know the real things cost a hundred
[1:28:03] thousand dollars and they'll give you
[1:28:05] two fake ones to break and pretend that
[1:28:06] you don't that you that money means
[1:28:08] nothing to you everything is available
[1:28:10] out there if you want to influence today
[1:28:11] amen
[1:28:12] but it doesn't require anything real i
[1:28:14] mean you can be whatever you want it
[1:28:16] doesn't require character and it doesn't
[1:28:18] require any proof it just requires an
[1:28:19] image that you portray online amen
[1:28:23] what is it it's a bunch of liars telling
[1:28:24] other liars that they're awesome
[1:28:26] right and if a liar tells you tells you
[1:28:28] that you're awesome are you awesome
[1:28:30] no because he's a liar
[1:28:32] amen there's nothing to be found there
[1:28:33] what is it they're trying to make
[1:28:35] themselves feel good and they're trying
[1:28:36] to build up something that they don't
[1:28:38] have in their lives in the first place
[1:28:40] now there are some that are genuinely
[1:28:41] rich
[1:28:42] but the vast majority are nothing and
[1:28:44] what they do is they're they're putting
[1:28:45] things on there to try and make it make
[1:28:48] themselves important is really what it
[1:28:50] is and i can't tell you how many of them
[1:28:52] have been caught out where people saw
[1:28:53] them in real life where people saw them
[1:28:56] doing things and they're like hey i saw
[1:28:58] you on there i saw you on there
[1:29:00] why are you driving an old you know 1972
[1:29:03] corolla you know you you're supposed to
[1:29:06] have a lamborghini you have a learjet
[1:29:07] you live in a mansion and and people
[1:29:10] find out who these people are and all of
[1:29:11] a sudden they're like wow that wasn't
[1:29:12] real
[1:29:13] what is it social media is not where we
[1:29:15] go for our influence i mean it's not a
[1:29:17] place to gain it or a place to give it
[1:29:19] why because there is no cri requirement
[1:29:21] for character or experience on these
[1:29:23] platforms and then you can be anything
[1:29:25] you want on there and how many of us
[1:29:26] have seen people that tried to be
[1:29:27] something on their and all
[1:29:29] eventually they fall flat amen
[1:29:32] what is it social media is set up to
[1:29:34] hide your flaws and promote your
[1:29:35] strengths amen and you know what that is
[1:29:38] that's antichrist
[1:29:39] now i'm not saying don't be on social
[1:29:41] media i'm on social media amen but don't
[1:29:43] use it as a platform for influence and
[1:29:45] don't use it as a platform to build your
[1:29:46] reputation your reputation is always
[1:29:49] built first and foremost with the local
[1:29:50] body with your own family and then once
[1:29:53] you get the influence here you can do
[1:29:54] whatever you want with it elsewhere amen
[1:29:56] but if you cannot have influence here
[1:29:57] then why would you be out there trying
[1:29:59] to have influence why because here is
[1:30:01] where you have to have character before
[1:30:02] you can have influence here's where you
[1:30:04] have to have character before you can
[1:30:05] have a position here's where you have to
[1:30:07] have character before you're allowed to
[1:30:08] take on responsibilities why because
[1:30:10] we're subject to the word social media
[1:30:11] is not subject to anything it's subject
[1:30:13] that anything goes is what it is amen
[1:30:16] amen god's coming for a real bride can i
[1:30:18] say that he's not coming for a digital
[1:30:20] bride he's not coming for what we put
[1:30:22] online he's coming for what we have in
[1:30:23] our hearts and how we live our
[1:30:24] day-to-day lives amen
[1:30:26] amen i've seen brothers and they only
[1:30:28] teach and preach on social media why is
[1:30:30] that because the local congregation
[1:30:32] won't allow behind the pulpit why
[1:30:34] because they don't have the trust
[1:30:35] because they don't have the respect
[1:30:36] because they haven't proven themselves
[1:30:38] to be able to do it and so what do they
[1:30:40] do they go online because they they may
[1:30:41] have a gift amen but they've got to go
[1:30:43] through the process like timothy did to
[1:30:45] get what the proof in their life the
[1:30:47] profiting that everyone would see before
[1:30:48] they can get behind the pulpit and what
[1:30:50] happens is they bypass that and they try
[1:30:52] and go online and they gather themselves
[1:30:54] an online reputation they gather
[1:30:55] themselves in online ministry and guess
[1:30:57] what it's a bunch of rebels just like
[1:30:59] them
[1:30:59] amen why because the local body is
[1:31:02] always going to have the preeminence in
[1:31:03] people's lives you've got a local pastor
[1:31:04] you've got a local group of elders
[1:31:06] you've got a local group of families and
[1:31:08] these are the ones that we're supposed
[1:31:09] to be working for amen
[1:31:10] the thing is that social media has
[1:31:12] allowed us to bypass so much the
[1:31:14] telephone has allowed us to do that
[1:31:15] television videos all these different
[1:31:17] things has allowed us to bypass the
[1:31:19] entire process of being what subject to
[1:31:21] one another and then improving ourselves
[1:31:24] here to the people that are here and
[1:31:26] paul's day you can write letters to
[1:31:27] everybody right you couldn't send out a
[1:31:29] video to everybody and have this
[1:31:30] influence you had to go in person and
[1:31:32] either they would receive you or they
[1:31:33] wouldn't but it was always done in
[1:31:35] person and you had to have that proof of
[1:31:36] a personal character you had to have the
[1:31:38] characteristics of christ in order to be
[1:31:40] accepted amen but now we don't have to
[1:31:42] do that now we can just plop ourselves
[1:31:44] in front of our phone put out a video
[1:31:45] and all of a sudden we've got influence
[1:31:47] but is it godly influence is a
[1:31:49] christ-like influence amen
[1:31:51] amen
[1:31:54] we read the scripture in a previous
[1:31:56] service it's first corinthians 8 2 and
[1:31:57] it says if any man that's if any person
[1:32:01] if any person think that he knoweth
[1:32:03] anything he knoweth nothing as yet he
[1:32:05] ought to know amen
[1:32:07] that character is what's going to prove
[1:32:08] that what you have is real
[1:32:12] and until it's proven
[1:32:13] we shouldn't be sharing it with others
[1:32:15] amen
[1:32:16] now paul writes a second letter to
[1:32:17] timothy and to us we'll see because he
[1:32:20] says this know also second timothy three
[1:32:22] verse one that in the last days perilous
[1:32:24] times shall come so remember last time
[1:32:26] he spoke about the latter days now he's
[1:32:28] saying the last days the the the the the
[1:32:30] drama hasn't changed here
[1:32:32] right he's still talking to us at the
[1:32:34] last times but he's talking to timothy
[1:32:36] because the struggle is still the same
[1:32:38] he says that in the last days perilous
[1:32:40] times shall come
[1:32:41] for men that's mankind shall be lovers
[1:32:44] of their own selves
[1:32:45] amen you'll be your own greatest fan
[1:32:48] that's what that means you think you're
[1:32:50] awesome
[1:32:51] he says that's
[1:32:53] what a characteristic of the last day
[1:32:55] person now this is not the
[1:32:57] characteristic of the last day christian
[1:32:59] this is what mankind in general
[1:33:02] covetous this is funny you think you're
[1:33:05] awesome but now you're covetous it's a
[1:33:06] paradox isn't it if you are so awesome
[1:33:09] then why would you be coveting
[1:33:11] right
[1:33:13] boasters
[1:33:14] that means you're outwardly expressing
[1:33:16] how awesome you are so not only do you
[1:33:18] think it but you talk about it
[1:33:20] right
[1:33:21] proud
[1:33:22] blasphemers disobedient to parents now
[1:33:24] this one's a great one and this is
[1:33:26] speaking of humanity and you say well
[1:33:27] that's i'm talking to kids but he's
[1:33:29] talking to timothy he's talking to a
[1:33:31] young man
[1:33:32] right and so if you're raised right to
[1:33:35] do right and as an adult you're doing
[1:33:37] wrong then who are you disobedient to
[1:33:39] you're still disobedient to your parents
[1:33:40] you might be out of the house you might
[1:33:42] be 50 years old but if you're going
[1:33:44] against what your parents taught to to
[1:33:45] you you're still disobedient to your
[1:33:47] parents i mean this is not limited by
[1:33:49] age if you've been taught right and you
[1:33:50] don't do it you're still disobedient
[1:33:52] amen
[1:33:53] what unthankful
[1:33:55] unholy without natural affection truce
[1:33:57] breakers false accusers incontinent
[1:34:00] fierce
[1:34:01] always fighting or always looking for a
[1:34:03] fight
[1:34:04] now if that isn't social media today
[1:34:06] then i don't know what i'm talking about
[1:34:08] because everybody's looking for a fight
[1:34:10] on social media everybody's got an ax to
[1:34:12] grind everybody's looking to jump on
[1:34:13] somebody's little dot or uncrossed t to
[1:34:17] point out how wrong they are and how
[1:34:19] right i am right
[1:34:22] brother mark doesn't know the rest of us
[1:34:23] know amen
[1:34:25] what is it everybody's got something and
[1:34:27] they're always looking for somebody when
[1:34:29] we're coming home there was somebody
[1:34:30] driving 80 in the left lane that's the
[1:34:32] fast lane right and so i stayed behind
[1:34:34] them for a while i flashed my lights
[1:34:36] once or twice to let them know that they
[1:34:37] needed to move over and they didn't so i
[1:34:38] ripped around and i told my mom i said
[1:34:40] i'm not angry i'm just educating them
[1:34:43] right
[1:34:44] because i i did lean on the horn as i
[1:34:46] went by but i genuinely wasn't angry
[1:34:49] i could say that i wasn't angry
[1:34:51] but a little annoyed for sure
[1:34:53] right
[1:34:54] and and then we came up on another
[1:34:56] person that needed to be educated right
[1:34:59] but i didn't beep but then i just went
[1:35:00] around them you know
[1:35:02] but what everybody's looking for a fight
[1:35:05] everyone's got to prove they've got
[1:35:06] something that i'm right you're wrong
[1:35:08] and guess what we're almost exactly on
[1:35:10] the same page but you're still wrong
[1:35:13] and i'm going to tell you all about it
[1:35:14] right fierce always looking for a fight
[1:35:18] amen
[1:35:20] they're not at rest
[1:35:22] that's what it is folks they're not at
[1:35:24] rest they're fighting because they lack
[1:35:26] rest and so what do they want to do they
[1:35:27] want to take away your rest so you know
[1:35:29] how you get away
[1:35:31] get away
[1:35:32] right you don't want to be around fierce
[1:35:34] people get away from where the fierce
[1:35:35] people are my wife had an incident she
[1:35:37] was on the newfoundland home growers
[1:35:39] page or something like that and somebody
[1:35:41] did something silly and you know what
[1:35:42] she did she just left right they wanted
[1:35:45] to fight she just left apologized and
[1:35:46] left and what she won't go back again
[1:35:49] why
[1:35:49] because it's just going to upset her and
[1:35:51] it's just going to feed their fire of
[1:35:52] fierceness so walk away from it amen
[1:35:56] despisers of those that are good that's
[1:35:58] definitely the truth isn't it they're
[1:35:59] out there looking to pin us down they're
[1:36:02] looking for something that'll tell them
[1:36:04] that we're not what we say we are so
[1:36:06] that it'll make them feel good about
[1:36:07] being nothing
[1:36:09] right and i mean nothing by nothing by
[1:36:11] the word of god amen
[1:36:13] traitors that's betrayers backstabbers
[1:36:15] doing or speaking badly to those that
[1:36:17] help them that's what a traitor is
[1:36:19] you don't you're not a traitor to the
[1:36:21] enemy you're a traitor to your family
[1:36:22] you're a traitor to your country you're
[1:36:23] a traitor to those that are around you
[1:36:25] amen
[1:36:27] heady you know what hedy means this
[1:36:29] isn't pride this is recklessness
[1:36:32] plunging bravely in without any clue
[1:36:36] about what's waiting for you brother
[1:36:37] brown put this way walking with
[1:36:38] hobnailed shoes where angels fear to
[1:36:40] tread and then you have no what you have
[1:36:42] no idea of a holy god and then you just
[1:36:45] push through because you think you know
[1:36:46] better highminded now this is arrogance
[1:36:49] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:36:51] god having a form of godliness but
[1:36:53] denying the power thereof this is the
[1:36:55] religious spirit that we talked about
[1:36:56] this is the antichrist spirit why
[1:36:58] because the word of god always comes
[1:37:00] with transforming power and if you're
[1:37:02] not being transformed then the word of
[1:37:04] god is not active in your life and then
[1:37:06] the holy spirit hasn't had an effect he
[1:37:08] says from such turn away for this sort
[1:37:11] are they which creep into houses and
[1:37:13] lead captive silly women now this is
[1:37:16] talking about literal women and then
[1:37:17] it's talking about churches right
[1:37:19] brother brown talked about this woman is
[1:37:20] always representing the church in the
[1:37:22] scriptures so what they're leading in
[1:37:24] what churches that want the things that
[1:37:27] they're talking about
[1:37:28] and they lead them captive and they bind
[1:37:30] them to themselves and you see these
[1:37:31] great ministries come out of it and all
[1:37:33] it is is them telling people what they
[1:37:34] want to hear
[1:37:36] amen and then you look maybe make bring
[1:37:38] it a little closer to home look at the
[1:37:40] churches that left the message you look
[1:37:42] at brother jeff jenkins
[1:37:44] is he still a brother who knows you look
[1:37:46] at jeff jenkins i've seen videos of his
[1:37:47] church and you know what it is 70 women
[1:37:50] 80 women
[1:37:52] what kind of women it says laden with
[1:37:55] sins led away with divers lusts that
[1:37:58] doesn't mean physically or anything
[1:38:00] weird like that but it means that they
[1:38:01] had a desire for something else than
[1:38:03] what was being served over the pulpit
[1:38:05] right and they willingly followed the
[1:38:06] man that offered it to him that word
[1:38:08] laden with sins laden means heaped up
[1:38:10] and overwhelmed with unbelief
[1:38:12] that's the kind of people that get led
[1:38:14] away by these men
[1:38:15] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:38:17] the knowledge of the truth amen seekers
[1:38:19] but never able to find because they've
[1:38:21] already defined in their head what truth
[1:38:22] will look like they are looking for a
[1:38:24] truth that they believe rather than
[1:38:26] looking for truth as an absolute amen
[1:38:28] they're looking for something that is
[1:38:30] within their expectation rather than
[1:38:32] just saying i want whatever is true amen
[1:38:34] they're only open to their expectations
[1:38:38] and then paul ends his his admonition to
[1:38:39] timothy now we're going back to the
[1:38:40] first
[1:38:41] one
[1:38:43] he says take heed unto thyself so this
[1:38:45] is his first series with timothy says
[1:38:47] take heed unto thyself and unto the
[1:38:49] doctrine continue in them for in doing
[1:38:53] this thou shalt both save thyself and
[1:38:56] them that hear thee
[1:38:58] he's saying you got to stick with it bud
[1:39:00] because if you don't stick with it
[1:39:02] then it's not going to have the effect
[1:39:03] you're looking for but not only that it
[1:39:04] won't have the effect on those that are
[1:39:06] around you but if you can stay with it
[1:39:08] it'll bleed out because you won't be
[1:39:09] able to help it right when the life of
[1:39:11] god's in you it's going to bleed out
[1:39:12] isn't it we're going to see fruits from
[1:39:13] it and that'll do what that'll help and
[1:39:16] save those that are around you now
[1:39:17] you'll actually have influence timothy
[1:39:19] but it'll be influenced to save them not
[1:39:21] influenced to draw them to you but it'll
[1:39:23] draw them to the god that drew you to
[1:39:24] him
[1:39:25] amen that's what we're looking for amen
[1:39:28] he says look out for yourself and then
[1:39:29] the rest will come amen now in second
[1:39:32] timothy 2 so this is the follow-up to
[1:39:34] his first letter so timothy has done
[1:39:36] what he said and then he follows up he
[1:39:37] says thou therefore my son be strong in
[1:39:40] the grace that is in christ jesus
[1:39:43] remember we've always said you've got to
[1:39:44] remember that this is a grace work from
[1:39:46] start to finish timothy remember that
[1:39:48] this is christ's grace in you that's
[1:39:50] working in this that the growth that
[1:39:52] you're seeing that the ministry you're
[1:39:54] embarking on that the influence that
[1:39:56] you're about to have or that you are
[1:39:57] having with people is what it's his
[1:39:59] grace to you this has nothing to do with
[1:40:02] you and everything to do with him
[1:40:04] he says and the things that thou has
[1:40:06] heard of me among many witnesses the
[1:40:09] same commit thou to faithful men who
[1:40:11] shall be able to teach others also
[1:40:14] what's he doing he's saying timothy time
[1:40:15] for you to go out time for you to go
[1:40:17] teach other men time for you to pass on
[1:40:20] what you've learned since i last taught
[1:40:21] you time since you've been spending time
[1:40:24] in the word since you've meditated on
[1:40:26] these things since you've committed
[1:40:27] yourself holy to it now that the proof
[1:40:29] is there now go and commit the same
[1:40:31] thing to other men let them see how the
[1:40:33] effect it's had in you teach them what
[1:40:35] i've taught you and then they'll go and
[1:40:36] they'll expand it out to somebody else
[1:40:38] and pretty soon we'll have the growth of
[1:40:39] the great church
[1:40:41] what is it take the proof that you've
[1:40:43] got and go show other people the proof
[1:40:45] and let them get it in their life as
[1:40:46] well
[1:40:47] what is it he's stepping into his active
[1:40:49] ministry now paul is saying you're
[1:40:50] trusted now timothy now it's time for
[1:40:53] you to start working with other people
[1:40:55] he says thou therefore endure hardness
[1:40:58] as a good soldier of jesus christ things
[1:41:00] are about to get tough timothy
[1:41:02] and he calls him a soldier now
[1:41:04] right now he before he was a son
[1:41:07] before he was a youth now what is he
[1:41:09] he's a soldier
[1:41:10] he's been proven he's got something to
[1:41:12] fight with now he's been trained
[1:41:15] right the proof that you're ready for
[1:41:17] battle is that you get what put into
[1:41:19] battle that you pass the training that
[1:41:21] you pass the course and that they've
[1:41:23] they've decided that you're good enough
[1:41:24] to go
[1:41:26] why he's about to battle for the gospel
[1:41:28] of jesus christ and in those days that
[1:41:30] was a killing thing they killed you for
[1:41:33] that in those days right they didn't
[1:41:34] just make fun of you they just just
[1:41:36] didn't take your job
[1:41:37] they took your head
[1:41:39] right he's got to endure the real deal
[1:41:41] now
[1:41:42] he says no man that wareth entangleth
[1:41:45] himself with the affairs of this life
[1:41:48] what he's got one focus
[1:41:50] battle for the gospel why that he may
[1:41:52] please him who had chosen him to be a
[1:41:54] soldier and then if the general tells
[1:41:56] you to do something and you go do
[1:41:58] something else and you say well i got
[1:41:59] distracted by this or distracted by that
[1:42:01] does that please the general or the
[1:42:03] captain
[1:42:04] or the lieutenant or the colonel no when
[1:42:06] he asks you to do something he wants you
[1:42:08] to do it he's saying timothy you've been
[1:42:10] loosed now you're ready to go you're
[1:42:12] ready to battle go battle and let your
[1:42:14] focus be solely on what i've taught you
[1:42:16] to do
[1:42:16] he says and if a man also strive for
[1:42:19] masteries yet is he not crowned except
[1:42:22] he strive lawfully in other words you
[1:42:25] don't get a medal if you don't do the
[1:42:26] work and then you don't get position
[1:42:28] without proving yourself and you don't
[1:42:30] get authority unless you've proven that
[1:42:32] you can share that responsibility
[1:42:34] amen what is it leadership proves
[1:42:37] cheaters really really quickly why
[1:42:39] because the first thing that's tested as
[1:42:41] a leader is what
[1:42:43] character
[1:42:44] it's always character and brother brown
[1:42:46] said character is what a victory so if
[1:42:49] you have presumed that you have
[1:42:50] character rather than you have character
[1:42:52] because you've had it proven in battle
[1:42:55] then the first thing that's going to
[1:42:56] happen is you're going to fail in
[1:42:57] leadership because you lack the
[1:42:59] character by experience and by proof
[1:43:02] right what's the first thing that's
[1:43:03] going to be tested will you give
[1:43:04] preeminence to the word or to you
[1:43:07] or will you put it above your own
[1:43:08] comfort and reputation
[1:43:11] right
[1:43:12] character will put reputation aside to
[1:43:14] make things right
[1:43:16] every time
[1:43:17] and then the buck stops with leadership
[1:43:19] the buck stops with leadership so if
[1:43:20] leadership can't humble themselves to
[1:43:22] the word what's the point of them
[1:43:23] leading
[1:43:24] right
[1:43:26] one will you pump or two will you humble
[1:43:28] yourself to the word personally even if
[1:43:31] it hurts you
[1:43:34] that's a tough one for us men isn't it
[1:43:36] pride flares up pride flares up every
[1:43:39] time and i don't want to no no no no
[1:43:42] let's just smooth this over
[1:43:44] right
[1:43:45] let's just point out their flaws so that
[1:43:47] mine slip away
[1:43:49] no no no no we've got to put ourselves
[1:43:51] under the microscope right we've got to
[1:43:53] be willing to do the same thing that we
[1:43:54] expect of them amen and what the third
[1:43:56] thing is will you be influenced away
[1:43:58] from the word by personal relationships
[1:44:00] or gifts especially those with a greater
[1:44:02] ministry or a higher level of
[1:44:03] responsibility because guess what the
[1:44:05] greater your gift the greater your
[1:44:07] ministry the greater the people you
[1:44:08] start to rub shoulders with and guess
[1:44:10] what they ain't all angels of light
[1:44:12] right some of them are trying to draw
[1:44:14] people to them they're trying to get
[1:44:15] financial support they're trying to get
[1:44:17] ministerial support they're trying to
[1:44:18] make a name for themselves and you can
[1:44:21] get drawn into that amen like a moth is
[1:44:23] drawn to light if you don't have
[1:44:24] character to say no the word applies to
[1:44:27] every one of us amen amen
[1:44:30] he continues he says the husbandman that
[1:44:32] laboreth must be first partaker of the
[1:44:35] fruits now this is a weird scripture
[1:44:38] because we think he's the first partaker
[1:44:40] because he's the one that's done the
[1:44:42] work
[1:44:43] but what he's also saying here is look
[1:44:45] if you've planted
[1:44:46] and you've got fruit coming out you need
[1:44:49] to try the fruit first because if you've
[1:44:50] done a good job the fruit will be good
[1:44:52] if you've done the right things then the
[1:44:54] fruit will be right but if you've done
[1:44:56] it wrong you taste it first so that if
[1:44:57] it's not good you don't try and feed
[1:44:59] what you've just done to somebody else
[1:45:01] and then prove
[1:45:02] the fruit that you've got coming out
[1:45:04] taste and see that it's good and if it's
[1:45:06] good then let other people know this is
[1:45:07] the way it works but if you taste it and
[1:45:09] you say there's some bitterness in there
[1:45:11] it's not quite the way i expected it to
[1:45:13] taste and you got strawberries and
[1:45:14] they're sour you did something wrong
[1:45:16] didn't you
[1:45:17] right the fruit has to be the way that
[1:45:19] it's supposed to be and if you taste it
[1:45:21] and see that's not then you know not to
[1:45:22] try and feed it to somebody else
[1:45:24] then paul says consider what i say and
[1:45:27] the lord give thee understanding in all
[1:45:29] things dropping down to the 14th verse
[1:45:31] he says of these things put them in
[1:45:33] remembrance charging them before the
[1:45:35] lord that they strive not about words to
[1:45:37] no prophet but to the subverting of the
[1:45:39] hearers he says don't get caught up in
[1:45:41] petty conversations and ideas it only
[1:45:44] undermines the faith of the people that
[1:45:46] get drawn into it as well
[1:45:47] don't be one of those people that get
[1:45:49] sucked into the little things amen
[1:45:51] this is a huge scripture for today
[1:45:52] because why we're in laodicea
[1:45:55] everybody's got their rights and not
[1:45:57] only that everybody's got an opinion and
[1:45:59] everybody thinks their opinion is right
[1:46:01] now i don't think that's exclusive to
[1:46:02] laodicea what they do have today is they
[1:46:04] have everyone a platform to express
[1:46:06] their opinions
[1:46:08] one of them social media the other thing
[1:46:09] is in the workplace the other thing is
[1:46:11] out wherever people are talking about
[1:46:13] anything and everything and they feel
[1:46:15] that because they have an opinion that
[1:46:16] they should be expressing the opinion
[1:46:18] did you know that's not scripture
[1:46:22] everybody doesn't get to talk all the
[1:46:23] time in scripture there's an order for
[1:46:25] who talks when they talk and who listens
[1:46:28] amen amen and if you haven't proven
[1:46:30] yourself by your conduct guess what
[1:46:32] nobody's going to listen to you and
[1:46:33] you're not even going to be given a
[1:46:35] chance to speak
[1:46:36] right there's an order to all these
[1:46:38] things and for the young men they've got
[1:46:40] to realize that just because you have
[1:46:41] something to say doesn't mean it's
[1:46:43] always it always needs to be said amen
[1:46:45] again
[1:46:47] i'm still
[1:46:48] learning that lesson right and i have
[1:46:50] learned it many many times right
[1:46:52] sometimes just because you think you
[1:46:54] have something to say doesn't mean you
[1:46:55] should say it one thing i learned from
[1:46:56] brother phil mcwugby over in alberta
[1:46:59] he's a manager senior manager
[1:47:01] he said whenever i have a meeting at
[1:47:03] work he says i speak last
[1:47:05] you know why
[1:47:06] he says one because if i speak first and
[1:47:08] people have a differing opinion they
[1:47:10] don't want to say it but he said two
[1:47:12] there's lots of experience in the room
[1:47:14] he says and i'll take the best things
[1:47:15] that they say and add it to what i had
[1:47:17] and even modify it and i'll speak last
[1:47:19] and wrap the team up together right
[1:47:23] there's a time to speak and there's a
[1:47:24] time not too amen
[1:47:26] look at what we have we have what a 14
[1:47:28] 15 year old activist from sweden greta
[1:47:31] tunberg trying to tell the world how to
[1:47:32] fix their problems
[1:47:34] listen she doesn't even know she what
[1:47:36] does she know she knows nothing but she
[1:47:38] has a voice and she has an opinion and
[1:47:39] somehow she thinks that makes her worthy
[1:47:41] of listening and guess what the world
[1:47:42] has told her you're worthy of listening
[1:47:44] what kind of message does that give to
[1:47:46] every other 14 or 15 year old
[1:47:48] that they should get on tv and they
[1:47:49] should tell things of which they have no
[1:47:50] knowledge or experience
[1:47:52] no practical knowledge or experience
[1:47:54] that's for sure amen
[1:47:56] thing is we all have opinions but how
[1:47:57] many of us have word opinions
[1:48:00] how many of us can say it is written
[1:48:02] amen not i think right or i believe but
[1:48:06] it is written amen
[1:48:08] amen that's who i want to speak is
[1:48:11] somebody that knows what they're talking
[1:48:12] about amen
[1:48:14] i don't want to listen to just anybody
[1:48:15] with an opinion it can be fun
[1:48:17] it can be interesting sometimes but i
[1:48:19] want to listen to somebody that knows
[1:48:20] what they're actually talking about
[1:48:22] amen
[1:48:24] when we surround ourselves with people
[1:48:25] like ourselves and when we base our
[1:48:27] rightness or spirituality on those that
[1:48:28] are like us rather than those that have
[1:48:30] a proven track record of experience we
[1:48:33] are hearing what scripture calls the
[1:48:34] song of fools
[1:48:36] the song of fools why because we're
[1:48:38] surrounding ourselves with yes people
[1:48:40] people that affirm us where we are
[1:48:41] rather than hold us accountable to the
[1:48:43] word and how do you hold somebody
[1:48:45] accountable to the word it's by the
[1:48:46] experience of the word not just by the
[1:48:48] letter of the word you've got to know
[1:48:50] what you're talking about and then we've
[1:48:51] got a beautiful example of this it's not
[1:48:53] so beautiful but it's it's beautiful for
[1:48:55] us to learn by amen this is first kings
[1:48:57] 12. this is what happens when we what
[1:49:00] when we look to our immediate peers
[1:49:02] those that are in our own age group
[1:49:04] amen and this is what we tend to do as
[1:49:06] young people again i'm speaking from
[1:49:07] experience i'm not making this up what
[1:49:10] do us young people tend to do we talk to
[1:49:12] other young people right am i not right
[1:49:15] am i not great am i not educated am i
[1:49:18] not knowledgeable about this do i not
[1:49:19] have a gift and all of the people around
[1:49:21] us say yes yes yes why because they want
[1:49:23] you to say the same thing about them
[1:49:24] when they get up and talk or when they
[1:49:25] have something they want to do or
[1:49:26] something they want to say we surround
[1:49:28] ourselves with people that will affirm
[1:49:30] rather than people that will align us
[1:49:31] with the word and that's the that's the
[1:49:33] natural that that's that's human nature
[1:49:35] is to make our life easy and so we
[1:49:37] surround ourselves with people that will
[1:49:38] affirm us
[1:49:39] first kings 12 1 says andrea rehoboam
[1:49:41] this is solomon's son this is the sun
[1:49:44] that follows the millennium
[1:49:46] right that was the millennium kingdom
[1:49:48] with solomon it was it was the
[1:49:49] representation of the millennium it was
[1:49:51] all peace no fighting and a wise king
[1:49:54] and rio bone went to shechem for all
[1:49:56] israel will come to shechem to make him
[1:49:58] king
[1:49:59] and it came to pass when jeroboam the
[1:50:00] son of nebat who was yet in egypt heard
[1:50:02] of it for he was fled from the presence
[1:50:04] of king solomon and jeroboam dwelt in
[1:50:06] egypt that they sent and called him and
[1:50:08] jeroboam and all the congregation of
[1:50:10] israel came and spake unto rehoboam
[1:50:12] saint so remember jeroboam can take
[1:50:14] israel they're considering jeroboam as
[1:50:17] king but they go to rehoboam and say
[1:50:18] okay we got something to talk to you
[1:50:20] about jeroboam you come back just in
[1:50:21] case because we got two choices here
[1:50:24] so they came to rehoboam and they said
[1:50:26] thy father made our yoke grievous now
[1:50:28] therefore make thou the grievous service
[1:50:30] of thy father and his heavy oak which he
[1:50:32] put upon us lighter and we will serve
[1:50:35] thee and he said unto them depart ye
[1:50:37] depart yet for three days and then come
[1:50:39] again to me and the people departed
[1:50:42] and king rehoboam consulted with the
[1:50:45] old men
[1:50:46] that stood before solomon his father
[1:50:48] while he yet lived and said how do you
[1:50:51] advise that i may answer this people
[1:50:53] catch that why does solomon need anybody
[1:50:55] to advise him
[1:50:57] these are the old men that what advised
[1:50:59] solomon solomon that has the greatest
[1:51:01] wisdom known to mankind
[1:51:04] for a non-holy ghost-filled man
[1:51:07] this is a man that astonished the entire
[1:51:09] world with his knowledge and wisdom and
[1:51:11] yet he had who to advise him
[1:51:14] old men
[1:51:15] because why solomon wasn't a fool
[1:51:18] right he knew there was value in
[1:51:20] experience so he so rehoboam his son now
[1:51:23] goes to the men that consulted solomon
[1:51:25] it says and they spake unto him saying
[1:51:27] if thou wilt be a servant
[1:51:30] unto this people this day and will serve
[1:51:32] them and answer them and speak good
[1:51:34] words to them then they will be thy
[1:51:36] servants forever
[1:51:37] but he sorry
[1:51:39] and he said unto them
[1:51:42] sorry then they will be thy servants
[1:51:43] forever but he forsook the counsel of
[1:51:45] the old man which they had given him and
[1:51:47] consulted with the young men that were
[1:51:49] grown up with him and which stood before
[1:51:52] him in other words he talked to the
[1:51:53] people close to him his friends his
[1:51:56] buddies the ones that were raised in the
[1:51:57] palace what all the ones that had
[1:51:59] something to gain by his influence
[1:52:02] and those are the ones that he went and
[1:52:03] talked to
[1:52:04] right
[1:52:06] he didn't ask in or add in anyone that
[1:52:08] wasn't affiliated with him
[1:52:10] and that wasn't known to him
[1:52:11] what'd he do he gathered the yes men
[1:52:14] and he said unto them what counsel give
[1:52:16] ye that we may answer this people who
[1:52:17] have spoken to me say make the yoke
[1:52:19] which thy father then put upon us later
[1:52:22] and the young men that were grown up
[1:52:23] with him spake unto him saying thus
[1:52:25] shalt thou speak unto this people that
[1:52:26] spake unto thee saying thy father made
[1:52:29] our yoke heavy and thou shalt and make
[1:52:31] thou lighter unto us thou shalt say unto
[1:52:33] them my little finger shall be thicker
[1:52:35] than my father's loins and now whereas
[1:52:38] my father delayed you with a heavy yoke
[1:52:40] i will add to your yoke my father has
[1:52:43] chastised you with whips but i will
[1:52:45] chastise you with scorpions
[1:52:47] what'd they say flex your power show
[1:52:49] them who's boss
[1:52:51] let them know that you're the king and
[1:52:53] you can do whatever you want
[1:52:55] make it tougher just to prove a point to
[1:52:57] them
[1:52:59] make a point to prove to them that
[1:53:00] you've got the power to do whatever you
[1:53:02] want
[1:53:03] so jeroboam and all the people came to
[1:53:05] rehoboam the third day as the king had
[1:53:06] appointed saying come to me again the
[1:53:08] third day
[1:53:09] and the king answered the people roughly
[1:53:11] and forsook the old man's counsel that
[1:53:13] they gave him and spake to them after
[1:53:15] the council of the young man saying my
[1:53:17] father made your yoke heavy and i will
[1:53:18] add to your yoke my father also chastise
[1:53:21] you with whips but i will chastise you
[1:53:23] with scorpions
[1:53:25] wherefore
[1:53:26] the king heart cannot unto the people
[1:53:28] for the cause was from the lord that he
[1:53:31] might perform his saying which the lord
[1:53:32] spake by
[1:53:33] ahijah the shiloh knight unto jeroboam
[1:53:35] the son of nebat so when all israel saw
[1:53:38] that the king hearkened not unto them
[1:53:39] the people answered the king saying what
[1:53:42] portion have we in david neither have we
[1:53:44] inheritance in the son of jesse to your
[1:53:46] tents o israel now see to thine house
[1:53:49] own house david so israel departed under
[1:53:51] their tents what'd he do he lost all of
[1:53:53] israel
[1:53:54] why he listened to people of his own age
[1:53:57] amen
[1:54:00] paid a heavy price he lost the majority
[1:54:01] of his kingdom
[1:54:02] and it devolved into what civil war
[1:54:05] so let me ask you young brothers and
[1:54:07] young sisters who's giving you your
[1:54:09] advice
[1:54:11] amen is it somebody that's grown up with
[1:54:12] you is it your own peer group or is it
[1:54:15] somebody that is above you an experience
[1:54:17] in age that has the proof of the life
[1:54:20] and the decisions that you're trying to
[1:54:21] make and have
[1:54:23] amen if we're talking to people that are
[1:54:25] at our own level what could they ever
[1:54:26] hope to offer
[1:54:28] right they have nothing that we don't
[1:54:29] already have in most cases what do we do
[1:54:31] we always look above to learn
[1:54:34] before we can ever hope to teach those
[1:54:35] that are around us amen amen
[1:54:38] amen listen
[1:54:40] if we're asking it's because we don't
[1:54:41] know so why would we ask other people
[1:54:43] that don't know as well
[1:54:45] right it's head knowledge to us
[1:54:47] amen we can all read the word and we do
[1:54:49] right but you've got to know how to
[1:54:51] rightly divide it and you've got to know
[1:54:52] how to rightly apply it and that comes
[1:54:54] with experience and we're we're foolish
[1:54:56] if we're not talking to the older people
[1:54:58] and then if we're not looking to those
[1:54:59] that have a track record that says they
[1:55:01] know how to make a good decision and
[1:55:03] they know how to how to lead themselves
[1:55:05] they know how to lead themselves and
[1:55:06] their families amen
[1:55:09] ecclesiastes 7 5 says it is better to
[1:55:11] hear the rebuke of the wise than for a
[1:55:14] man to hear the song of fools guess what
[1:55:19] whenever i talk to somebody that's older
[1:55:22] than me and i have i have
[1:55:24] three men in my life
[1:55:26] four maybe that i go to
[1:55:28] when i'm wondering about something
[1:55:31] and i asked them and guess what
[1:55:34] my expectation is not that they will
[1:55:36] affirm what i think my expectation is
[1:55:38] that they'll be honest with me and let
[1:55:40] me know if i'm off track and let me know
[1:55:42] how to make it right or let me how know
[1:55:44] how to do it better or let me know what
[1:55:46] the right decision is straight up if
[1:55:48] there's a word answer i want a word
[1:55:50] answer amen and sometimes sometimes
[1:55:52] we're ignorant ignorant because we don't
[1:55:54] know not ignorant willfully but other
[1:55:56] times we're ignorant willfully because
[1:55:57] we want something to go a certain way
[1:55:59] and if you've got a friend if you've got
[1:56:01] somebody above you that can help you and
[1:56:02] tell you it's straight that's the best
[1:56:04] friend you're ever going to have because
[1:56:06] they're looking out for your good rather
[1:56:07] than trying to make you into something
[1:56:09] you're not amen
[1:56:14] proverbs 13 verse 20 says he that
[1:56:16] walketh with wise men shall be wise
[1:56:19] guess what wise means more than you've
[1:56:21] got usually right you're looking to go
[1:56:23] with somebody that's ahead of you not
[1:56:24] somebody that's with you and definitely
[1:56:26] not somebody that's behind you on their
[1:56:28] christian walk wise people are going to
[1:56:29] be the ones ahead of you fools are going
[1:56:31] to be the ones with you or behind you
[1:56:33] when it comes to future decisions or
[1:56:34] decisions that are going to take you in
[1:56:36] a particular path a critical path moving
[1:56:39] forward amen
[1:56:40] amen if we as young people are affirming
[1:56:43] our own spirituality with each other
[1:56:45] then we miss the boat somewhere and then
[1:56:47] affirmation of that type comes from
[1:56:48] above not from below and not even at our
[1:56:51] own level
[1:56:52] first peter 5 says likewise ye younger
[1:56:55] submit yourselves unto the elder
[1:56:57] yea all of you be subject one to another
[1:56:59] and be clothed with humility so he
[1:57:01] points us to the ones that are above us
[1:57:03] but he says listen we all still answer
[1:57:06] to each other amen
[1:57:08] i think we could all say those of us
[1:57:09] that have children we've been corrected
[1:57:11] by our children haven't we
[1:57:13] right they've said things
[1:57:14] and they've said
[1:57:16] i remember a brother told me something
[1:57:18] and they had to do something on a on a
[1:57:20] church night and and his young son piped
[1:57:22] up and he said
[1:57:23] dad we're supposed to be at church
[1:57:25] tonight
[1:57:26] and he said he just went
[1:57:28] because he said he was right
[1:57:30] we should be at church tonight but
[1:57:32] instead we're doing something else that
[1:57:33] we deem to be more critical
[1:57:36] but his son was saying dad you've always
[1:57:37] said church is critical so why is this
[1:57:40] more critical
[1:57:41] right he said i couldn't answer
[1:57:44] because why
[1:57:45] what he had to humble himself to even
[1:57:47] that little kid it's not that we can't
[1:57:49] teach somebody that is above us right
[1:57:52] but it's not our position to do it amen
[1:57:55] but our kids definitely can teach us
[1:57:57] amen so the quick principle if we were
[1:57:59] to look at this is what you do not teach
[1:58:01] upwards you only teach downwards you
[1:58:04] don't teach at your level you teach to
[1:58:05] those that are below you and you are
[1:58:07] taught by those that are above you
[1:58:08] that's the scriptural principle and
[1:58:10] we'll actually see this we see it here
[1:58:12] and this is this is in general this is
[1:58:13] to men and women but it actually is most
[1:58:15] focused on the the young women if you
[1:58:16] look into the scriptures that they are
[1:58:18] to learn from the older to from the age
[1:58:19] of women but says likewise you're
[1:58:21] younger submit yourselves unto the elder
[1:58:23] yea all of you be subject one to another
[1:58:25] and be clothed with humility if you're
[1:58:27] teaching the lesson be humble and if
[1:58:29] you're receiving the lesson be humble
[1:58:31] amen for god resisted the proud and
[1:58:34] giveth grace to the humble
[1:58:37] humility i i mean i just listened to the
[1:58:39] message humbled myself and it wasn't
[1:58:40] really a message it was just brother
[1:58:42] brad i'm getting up and talking but he
[1:58:43] said so much in those 25 minutes i think
[1:58:45] that
[1:58:46] it was a worthy sermon you know and when
[1:58:48] he talks about humility is what gives us
[1:58:51] power with god amen humility is what
[1:58:53] gives us power with the people that are
[1:58:55] around us amen god help us
[1:58:58] humble yourselves therefore under the
[1:58:59] mighty hand of god that he may exalt you
[1:59:02] in due time let me put it this way
[1:59:04] humility looks a lot like listening
[1:59:07] and not a lot like talking that's what
[1:59:09] humility is is there's a lot less
[1:59:10] talking and there's a whole lot more
[1:59:12] listening if i can put it this way we
[1:59:14] have two ears and one mouth i would take
[1:59:16] that to mean we should listen twice as
[1:59:17] much as we talk
[1:59:19] amen
[1:59:21] so he says what you younger submit
[1:59:23] yourselves to the older so we have
[1:59:24] younger and we have older
[1:59:26] now that's that's a varied spread
[1:59:28] because guess what jensen is younger
[1:59:31] compared to brother paul but brother
[1:59:33] paul is younger compared to brother mark
[1:59:36] and i'm younger compared to brother
[1:59:38] gerald so there's a spectrum of younger
[1:59:40] and older all the way through
[1:59:42] so jensen can't teach brother paul but
[1:59:44] brother paul can teach brother jensen
[1:59:46] brother paul should not necessarily be
[1:59:48] teaching brother mark but brother mark
[1:59:49] should be teaching brother paul and i
[1:59:51] should not be teaching brother gerald
[1:59:52] but brother gerald should be teaching me
[1:59:54] because we submit ourselves to the elder
[1:59:56] they are the ones that teach us amen but
[1:59:57] there's a sliding scale there so each
[1:59:59] one of us has a sphere of influence we
[2:00:01] have a range that we can we can actually
[2:00:03] teach in and that others would be
[2:00:05] subject to us but we're also subject to
[2:00:07] somebody else and it's only when you get
[2:00:08] to the high end that basically the
[2:00:10] oldest person in the room has nobody
[2:00:11] answered to except for god
[2:00:14] so whoever that is brother gerald i
[2:00:16] think
[2:00:16] right but that's the way it is is the
[2:00:18] elders what they teach the younger in
[2:00:20] these things
[2:00:22] so what can brother gerald learn
[2:00:23] something from me
[2:00:25] absolutely but it is not my position to
[2:00:27] teach him
[2:00:28] right he can learn from me but is not my
[2:00:31] position to take authority over him in
[2:00:33] any way
[2:00:34] amen
[2:00:35] we listen we teach downwards but we
[2:00:37] listen upwards
[2:00:39] and then when we start trying to teach
[2:00:40] even at our own level we're playing with
[2:00:42] fire because again we're sitting around
[2:00:44] with people that don't know anything
[2:00:45] more than us and so what do we have to
[2:00:48] teach them
[2:00:49] we don't read a book and somehow no more
[2:00:51] that's not what we're talking about
[2:00:52] you've got to have experience above and
[2:00:54] beyond them and for most of us we have
[2:00:56] more or less the same experience as
[2:00:57] people our own age amen now that's a
[2:00:59] tricky thing sometimes because
[2:01:01] i'm sure somebody has noticed the
[2:01:03] paradox here you're saying brother john
[2:01:04] you're not allowed to teach upwards and
[2:01:06] yet who's behind the pulpit tonight
[2:01:09] i'm teaching a bunch of elders
[2:01:11] and i'm teaching some people at my age
[2:01:13] roughly and then i'm teaching younger
[2:01:16] but did i take this pulpit
[2:01:19] did i come in and say i want the pulpit
[2:01:22] no what happened the elders of the
[2:01:24] church the pastor of the church has
[2:01:26] given me the authority
[2:01:29] to teach
[2:01:30] and by recognition of the gift they will
[2:01:33] accept what i say is the word of god as
[2:01:35] long as it stays with the word of god
[2:01:38] amen but they are still sitting and
[2:01:40] don't think they aren't they are still
[2:01:41] sitting here and they are judging what i
[2:01:43] say by the word and you know what
[2:01:45] happens if brother jonathan gets off the
[2:01:46] word
[2:01:51] a vote
[2:01:52] no vote brother gerald's going to pull
[2:01:54] me aside and what's he going to do he's
[2:01:55] going to say brother john
[2:01:57] you're off the word brother
[2:01:59] right
[2:02:00] and if i persist what's he going to do
[2:02:02] is he's going to pull brother bob and
[2:02:03] brother mark in there and the three of
[2:02:05] them are going to sit down with me and
[2:02:06] say now brother john you're off the word
[2:02:08] and if i insist on holding the pulpit
[2:02:10] still what are they going to do they're
[2:02:12] going to sit me down in the pew until i
[2:02:14] can humble myself to the word aren't
[2:02:15] they because even though they have
[2:02:17] delegated that authority even though
[2:02:19] they've given me that authority to teach
[2:02:22] i cannot presume to have it it is given
[2:02:24] every service that i get up here they
[2:02:26] are giving me that anew every single
[2:02:28] time
[2:02:29] right
[2:02:30] so i can't take it and i can't presume i
[2:02:32] have it it is given every day that i get
[2:02:34] up here they are giving me the right to
[2:02:36] teach
[2:02:37] amen but let me tell you if my life gets
[2:02:39] out of order i'm going to get pulled out
[2:02:41] of the pulpit really quick
[2:02:42] why because if i can't live it i can't
[2:02:44] preach it amen and that's the god that's
[2:02:47] the word standard is if you can't live
[2:02:48] it then you can't preach it and that
[2:02:50] doesn't that's not just behind the
[2:02:52] pulpit that's in whatever you do and say
[2:02:54] amen if you you can't preach above your
[2:02:56] life if i can put it that way what did
[2:02:58] brother brahms say your life is speaking
[2:02:59] so loudly i can't hear what you're
[2:03:01] saying
[2:03:02] right that's where we're at today is
[2:03:03] we've got people that are speaking so
[2:03:05] loudly and not living right the young
[2:03:08] men what is it brothers
[2:03:10] speak less live more amen i've got
[2:03:13] tremendous respect for young men that
[2:03:14] don't talk a lot
[2:03:16] i was a big talker by the way
[2:03:18] i was a big talker i'm not putting
[2:03:19] myself up i was a big talker but i
[2:03:21] learned to shut up real quick
[2:03:23] when god gets a hold of you and he
[2:03:24] starts working he shuts you up for a
[2:03:25] while because you got to listen because
[2:03:27] what you're being taught
[2:03:29] and you can't speak while you're being
[2:03:31] taught you have to listen amen
[2:03:34] amen
[2:03:35] but the other thing is when i get
[2:03:36] outside the church
[2:03:38] do i go around and tell brother bob and
[2:03:39] brother joe and brother mark what to do
[2:03:41] yeah good luck
[2:03:43] i can't do it what do i do i defer to
[2:03:46] age because why they're the elders of
[2:03:48] the church they're the guardians of the
[2:03:49] church that's the pastor of the church
[2:03:51] and as much as brother gerald allows me
[2:03:52] my freedom up here out there i cannot
[2:03:54] presume to tell him what to do i have to
[2:03:57] defer to the authority that god has
[2:03:58] placed in his life defer to the
[2:04:00] authority of the elders in here amen if
[2:04:02] i want to do something i ask them if i
[2:04:04] want to do something that's going to
[2:04:05] impact them i ask them for permission i
[2:04:07] don't go up and say i'm the i'm the
[2:04:09] assistant pastor i'm a minister
[2:04:10] therefore we're going to do this no no
[2:04:12] i've got to ask them because they have
[2:04:13] authority over me as the elders amen
[2:04:18] if you look in the book of job
[2:04:20] what do we see we see jobs comforters
[2:04:22] that weren't very good at comforting
[2:04:23] right have you ever noticed who was the
[2:04:25] one that set them right
[2:04:27] was it the old guy or the young guy
[2:04:29] it was the young guy
[2:04:31] okay so it's again it's not that you
[2:04:33] can't help it's not that you can't teach
[2:04:35] somebody something in that you can't
[2:04:37] bring them to the word but if you look
[2:04:39] at elijah when he's there did he start
[2:04:41] or did he finish
[2:04:43] he finished he led all of those that
[2:04:46] were older
[2:04:47] more experienced he let them go on and
[2:04:49] on for what 30 35 chapters that's a long
[2:04:52] conversation
[2:04:53] and he sat there and he waited and he
[2:04:55] waited and then the scripture says he
[2:04:56] waited after they stopped for a while
[2:04:58] just in case they had anything more to
[2:05:00] add and then he spoke amen
[2:05:04] and he wasn't doing it in a formal role
[2:05:05] he was there as a friend speaking to
[2:05:07] them
[2:05:08] so again it's not that the young can't
[2:05:09] ever teach the old something as i said
[2:05:12] i'm pretty sure we can all say our
[2:05:13] children have taught us something so
[2:05:14] that means anybody can teach us anything
[2:05:16] listen a worldly person teaches us
[2:05:17] things at times if balaam's donkey can
[2:05:19] teach then just about anybody can amen
[2:05:22] i'm sure we've all been humbled in that
[2:05:23] way but rather our intent is not to go
[2:05:26] in and teach if it's somebody that's
[2:05:27] older than us our intent is to listen
[2:05:30] amen
[2:05:32] you're out of your position when you do
[2:05:34] that we're supposed to be listening to
[2:05:35] the elders not teaching the elders
[2:05:38] titus 2 says young men likewise exhort
[2:05:40] to be sober minded in all things showing
[2:05:44] thyself a pattern of good works
[2:05:47] good words
[2:05:49] good works
[2:05:50] live it don't talk it
[2:05:52] in doctrine showing on corruptness
[2:05:55] gravity and sincerity sound speech that
[2:05:58] cannot be condemned
[2:06:00] you know how you get sound speech that
[2:06:01] can't be condemned
[2:06:03] think before you speak and speak very
[2:06:05] little
[2:06:06] that's how you do it is when you measure
[2:06:08] your words against the word and you only
[2:06:10] speak what the word says amen too often
[2:06:13] we're waiting just for the other person
[2:06:14] to be quiet that's not what we're
[2:06:16] looking for we're looking to add to to
[2:06:18] edify or to stay silent amen this is the
[2:06:21] pattern for young men
[2:06:22] now goes for young women too but for
[2:06:24] young men this is how you build up a
[2:06:26] reputation this is how you prove
[2:06:28] yourself in training is you listen and
[2:06:30] you learn more than you talk and show
[2:06:33] amen
[2:06:36] sound speech that cannot be condemned
[2:06:38] that he that is of the contrary part may
[2:06:40] be ashamed having no evil thing to say
[2:06:42] of you can we say that
[2:06:47] i i would love it if my reputation was
[2:06:49] that is that when people said something
[2:06:51] bad about me then they would be ashamed
[2:06:54] because they know it's a lie
[2:06:56] that brother john isn't like that he
[2:06:57] would never do that
[2:06:59] but i'm not there yet amen but what what
[2:07:01] a reputation that would be that that
[2:07:03] even people that are contrary to your
[2:07:05] position contrary to what you say or
[2:07:07] believe would say but he's still
[2:07:09] a real man of god
[2:07:11] that i have nothing to lay at his feet
[2:07:13] that would say that he's a si a secret
[2:07:15] sinner you know or that he's a hypocrite
[2:07:17] or those things amen may god help us to
[2:07:20] be in that position amen that they would
[2:07:22] have no evil thing to save us
[2:07:24] listen
[2:07:25] as we wrap this up
[2:07:28] you know we've got a lot of scripture
[2:07:30] here
[2:07:31] but let's take it back to the god man
[2:07:34] can i do that just to wrap it up let's
[2:07:36] take it back to the god man and see how
[2:07:37] jesus dealt with this
[2:07:39] right jesus leaves the temple at the age
[2:07:42] of 12 having taught who
[2:07:45] the priests
[2:07:46] he went in there and he astonished them
[2:07:48] with what he knew
[2:07:50] okay so it is not a knowledge issue
[2:07:52] but he knew so much more and he
[2:07:55] astonished them they couldn't answer him
[2:07:57] jesus knew the word why because he was
[2:08:00] the word
[2:08:01] but watch what happens here amen
[2:08:04] he teaches all of those priests
[2:08:07] and then what happens is mary comes back
[2:08:08] to him and says we've been so worried
[2:08:10] about you and what were you doing he
[2:08:11] said know you not that i must be about
[2:08:13] my father's business
[2:08:15] right
[2:08:16] and then what does he do
[2:08:18] and he went down with them and came to
[2:08:21] nazareth and was subject to them
[2:08:25] this is the fullness of the godhead
[2:08:27] bodily
[2:08:29] at the age of 12 expounding on the
[2:08:31] scriptures in a way that the priests
[2:08:33] could not answer him
[2:08:35] and yet he goes down
[2:08:38] back to nazareth and is subject to who
[2:08:41] the dad that's not his dad
[2:08:43] and the mama that's not his mama
[2:08:46] for how long
[2:08:47] 18 more years
[2:08:50] he was subject to his parents until he
[2:08:52] was 30 years old god in flesh went back
[2:08:56] to nazareth until he was 30 and was
[2:08:58] subject to his parents
[2:09:00] amen
[2:09:02] but his mother kept all these sayings in
[2:09:03] her heart now listen to verse 52
[2:09:06] and jesus remember he is subject to his
[2:09:09] mother and father fleshly speaking
[2:09:12] he increased in wisdom
[2:09:14] and stature
[2:09:15] and in favor
[2:09:17] with god and man
[2:09:20] in what subjection
[2:09:23] in subjection he grew in stature and
[2:09:26] favor with god amen you want influence
[2:09:29] here's here you go this is this is the
[2:09:32] perfect picture of the perfect man of
[2:09:34] the god man and he subjects himself to
[2:09:37] those that god has put in authority and
[2:09:38] he grew in wisdom and stature glory amen
[2:09:41] what this is not just a man filled with
[2:09:43] the holy ghost this is the holy ghost in
[2:09:45] flesh
[2:09:46] and yet god used those that were in
[2:09:49] authority over him to help him grow in
[2:09:52] wisdom and in stature and jesus took it
[2:09:54] until he was 30. listen guys i know when
[2:09:57] we're 20 we're busting to get out aren't
[2:09:59] we we're busting it out we know
[2:10:01] so much we have great plans great ideas
[2:10:05] jesus stayed till he was 30 for a three
[2:10:06] and a half year ministry
[2:10:09] that's what we're looking at i'm not
[2:10:10] saying stay home until you're 30. all
[2:10:12] the parents are shooting daggers at me
[2:10:14] right now right no they're not they're
[2:10:15] not
[2:10:18] but i want you to see the pattern here
[2:10:20] paul didn't just make this stuff up amen
[2:10:23] paul didn't just come up with some good
[2:10:25] ideas for young men he's even pointing
[2:10:27] right back to the very one that showed
[2:10:28] us the great example and said even he
[2:10:31] was subject amen even he was under
[2:10:33] authority even he went back to those
[2:10:35] that god had placed in his life amen
[2:10:38] and how did he learn
[2:10:39] scripture says he learned by the things
[2:10:42] that he suffered
[2:10:44] why it was a struggle it was a trial you
[2:10:46] go into the military i've never been
[2:10:48] seen lots of videos is it a struggle
[2:10:51] is it easy you want to be on seal team
[2:10:53] six is it gonna be a joke
[2:10:55] no no no no the elite warrior requires
[2:10:57] elite training and the further you want
[2:10:59] to go the higher you want to be the
[2:11:00] better you want to be the harder you got
[2:11:02] to be you got to be trained brother
[2:11:04] brahm talks about you got to go back on
[2:11:05] those sands
[2:11:06] and then what did paul do
[2:11:08] when he got the holy ghost what did he
[2:11:10] what happened god took him out to arabia
[2:11:12] on the back side of the desert and he
[2:11:14] trained his prophet out of man out of
[2:11:17] everything he drilled everything out of
[2:11:18] him that he'd ever had and filled it
[2:11:20] back with something with a message that
[2:11:21] would come and take those people into a
[2:11:22] rapture amen
[2:11:24] final portion of timothy as we close
[2:11:27] he says to timothy study to show thyself
[2:11:30] approved unto god compare your life to
[2:11:32] what the word says
[2:11:34] a workman that needeth not be ashamed
[2:11:37] when is a workman ashamed
[2:11:40] when the owner or when the boss tells
[2:11:41] him to do something he does what he
[2:11:44] thinks he wants to do and then he comes
[2:11:45] back and he says that's either wrong or
[2:11:47] it's not as good as i expected of you
[2:11:49] that's the ashamed workman is somebody
[2:11:51] that's done something but it doesn't
[2:11:53] meet the standard that was required
[2:11:55] amen
[2:11:56] what is it rightly dividing the word of
[2:11:58] truth not just having it you got to
[2:12:00] rightly divide it you got to be able to
[2:12:02] apply it the right way but shun profane
[2:12:05] and vain babblings vain idol and useless
[2:12:08] talk for they will increase unto more
[2:12:11] ungodliness they're ungodly to start
[2:12:13] with and they'll lead you and others
[2:12:15] into more ungodliness
[2:12:17] and their word will eat as dutha canker
[2:12:19] in other words there's when i look that
[2:12:21] up in in
[2:12:23] the aramaic it says that they're like a
[2:12:24] cancer or gangrene
[2:12:27] what does cancer do
[2:12:29] does it just stay in one spot
[2:12:31] no it feathers out doesn't it you'll
[2:12:33] either get a tumor or you'll get
[2:12:34] something that just branches out through
[2:12:36] everything you know you get it in your
[2:12:37] lungs and it starts here and you go a
[2:12:38] week later and it's down to here and
[2:12:40] then a month later it's all the way
[2:12:41] through your lungs what it branches out
[2:12:43] and it envelops everything that's around
[2:12:45] it until what you can't cut it out
[2:12:47] because it's so tied into everything in
[2:12:48] your systems
[2:12:49] he says there were we'll eat as the
[2:12:51] other canker
[2:12:52] of whom is hymenus and philetus there
[2:12:54] was two men that were doing this and he
[2:12:56] names them he says look at them for an
[2:12:58] example this is what happens when you
[2:12:59] talk this way when you live this way
[2:13:01] when you don't compare yourself to the
[2:13:02] word but you lift yourself up on a
[2:13:04] platform amen
[2:13:06] what's he saying there's a lot of
[2:13:08] talking going on
[2:13:09] right there's a lot of talking going on
[2:13:11] he says
[2:13:12] watch what you're saying
[2:13:13] because it may lead you in the path of
[2:13:15] these two men that fell amen
[2:13:18] this is challenging
[2:13:19] amen brothers and sisters this is
[2:13:21] challenging i i know i'm speaking to the
[2:13:22] young men but if if we as as men and
[2:13:25] women of any age take this
[2:13:28] it's a challenge to us amen and say
[2:13:31] is he happy with
[2:13:33] the way i'm living
[2:13:34] is he happy with the way i'm developing
[2:13:36] my reputation is he happy with the
[2:13:38] decisions i'm making
[2:13:40] and then could we say that we're rapture
[2:13:42] ready
[2:13:43] that we please god
[2:13:44] and then when we look at this i mean
[2:13:46] this is rubber meets the road there's
[2:13:47] nothing there's no
[2:13:49] high revelation here and i know that
[2:13:52] amen but we've got to be able to take
[2:13:54] the word that we're we're hearing and
[2:13:56] we've got to be able to apply it we've
[2:13:57] got to be able to live a christian life
[2:13:59] and not just talk a christian life we've
[2:14:00] got to be able to live a christian life
[2:14:03] amen
[2:14:04] amen god bless you let's just stand this
[2:14:06] evening
[2:14:08] amen
[2:14:10] what is a young man we want to set a
[2:14:12] foundation that god can build up line
[2:14:14] upon line word upon word precept a
[2:14:17] prompt precept and then when that when
[2:14:19] that foundation is set then god's got
[2:14:21] something he can work on him and that's
[2:14:22] something he can trust is when you're
[2:14:24] built on that foundation but when you
[2:14:25] get that sand underneath and it moves
[2:14:27] underneath that stone will shift won't
[2:14:29] it every single time you've got to set
[2:14:31] it on a solid rock and that's what we're
[2:14:32] talking about here is when you make
[2:14:34] those decisions in life as you move
[2:14:35] forward as you look to be a part of the
[2:14:37] local bodies you look to find your place
[2:14:40] what paul's saying is be quiet before
[2:14:42] you get loud
[2:14:43] amen find your place get trained up and
[2:14:46] then when you're trained up then it'll
[2:14:48] it'll happen organically isn't that what
[2:14:50] they talk about today organic growth and
[2:14:52] a company will want to grow organically
[2:14:54] what is it we don't want to bring in
[2:14:55] some big outside we just want it to
[2:14:57] naturally develop into something that's
[2:14:59] what paul's talk about do the organic
[2:15:01] growth thing because that's what will
[2:15:02] last if you come in with boosters and
[2:15:04] injectors and and hot sauce and this and
[2:15:07] that and the other thing what's going to
[2:15:08] happen is you're going to have this
[2:15:09] quick burst but then you can't sustain
[2:15:10] it
[2:15:11] right
[2:15:12] why because it wasn't god to start with
[2:15:14] but if you can just take that slow the
[2:15:16] harder path amen that's what we're
[2:15:18] talking about here is the harder path if
[2:15:19] you can take the harder path then
[2:15:21] nothing will do it you'll be like a tree
[2:15:22] that's planted by the rivers of water
[2:15:24] amen that's what we're looking for is
[2:15:26] something that's just pushing taking in
[2:15:28] god pushing it out taking in god pushing
[2:15:31] it out and then you grow into that
[2:15:32] stature of a perfect man or a perfect
[2:15:34] woman
[2:15:35] in christ amen let's bow our heads
[2:15:38] heavenly father
[2:15:40] lord once again i know a challenging
[2:15:42] sermon
[2:15:43] lord for my own self if i was only
[2:15:45] preaching to myself lord i'd say there
[2:15:47] are many areas here where i don't match
[2:15:48] up lord maybe where pride lifts up
[2:15:52] lord ignorance at times
[2:15:55] lord maybe just an unwillingness to do
[2:15:57] the harder work
[2:15:58] but lord we know the reward comes when
[2:16:00] we'll submit ourselves to you amen lord
[2:16:03] when we'll knock down anything that
[2:16:04] we've built up
[2:16:05] lord and let you be the master builder
[2:16:07] of our lives lord god
[2:16:09] lord we want to lift our young brothers
[2:16:10] up this morning lord no matter their age
[2:16:13] no matter where they're at in life lord
[2:16:15] we want to lift them up before you and
[2:16:16] ask you to grant them grace lord to
[2:16:19] humble themselves to your word lord not
[2:16:21] only the brothers lord but each one's
[2:16:23] here lord that we would be able to look
[2:16:25] into the mirror of your word and where
[2:16:26] there is a disparity lord where we don't
[2:16:28] match up we'd say lord would you tear it
[2:16:31] down to bear rock and build it up in
[2:16:32] your way
[2:16:34] lord we pray your grace to each one of
[2:16:35] us lord just minister to hearts and
[2:16:37] souls lord you know my heart it's not
[2:16:39] directed to any one person lord i see
[2:16:42] myself in so many of these things lord i
[2:16:44] ask your grace for me lord i ask your
[2:16:46] forgiveness for me i ask your strength
[2:16:48] for me lord that i would grow in the way
[2:16:50] that you will want me to grow lord so
[2:16:52] that i can help those that are around me
[2:16:54] to grow as well lord lord may we not be
[2:16:56] stuffed shirts
[2:16:57] lord but may we be full of experience
[2:16:59] lord in the love and power of the holy
[2:17:01] ghost in our lives lord that others will
[2:17:03] benefit we pray right in jesus christ's
[2:17:05] name we ask it amen

[2:19:50] amen well that took i'm sure to take it
[2:19:53] took the holy ghost to deliver that
[2:19:56] but it takes the holy ghost to receive
[2:19:57] it too amen amen may god give us the
[2:20:01] from the youngest to the oldest to be
[2:20:03] able to take it and apply it
[2:20:07] let's sing 490.
[2:20:10] it is just as i am
[2:20:14] i said just as i am without one plea we
[2:20:17] don't have anything to offer god
[2:20:21] god showed me that recently
[2:20:24] [Music]
[2:20:25] not to get into a long long diatribe
[2:20:28] here but just to say that
[2:20:30] [Music]
[2:20:32] i realized that after all those years
[2:20:35] you know you sit back and think i was
[2:20:36] thinking about song services and things
[2:20:39] and
[2:20:41] realized that
[2:20:43] you know i don't really have anything
[2:20:45] it's only
[2:20:46] what god wants from me he wants from all
[2:20:48] of us is an obedient heart
[2:20:51] he wants a willingness he wants
[2:20:52] willingness to be subject to him
[2:20:55] and
[2:20:56] by the time god got through talking to
[2:20:58] me when i was out for a walk recently he
[2:21:00] said you know i i was i said i got
[2:21:02] nothing
[2:21:04] i got nothing and then when i got home
[2:21:06] and i opened up a message that i was
[2:21:08] reading god and simplicity and
[2:21:10] brother branham said you think you've
[2:21:12] got this or that you think you've got
[2:21:13] this talent he said you got nothing and
[2:21:16] what god was doing there was confirming
[2:21:18] that for me
[2:21:19] right and and
[2:21:21] that's for me that's where the rubber
[2:21:23] hit the road now it took me 41 years to
[2:21:26] come to that
[2:21:27] but
[2:21:28] you know i didn't realize before i
[2:21:30] didn't have very much but god just
[2:21:31] showed me that
[2:21:32] it's him from the beginning
[2:21:35] right to the end it's he is the genesis
[2:21:38] he's the revelation he's all in all and
[2:21:41] everything that he's done
[2:21:43] everything that he's done
[2:21:44] in our lives is to bring glory to him
[2:21:48] amen okay
[2:21:49] that's what i've come to
[2:21:51] and that's why i said there a couple of
[2:21:52] weeks ago when john preached the first
[2:21:55] the first sermon in this series
[2:21:57] that this i see it as god taking me out
[2:22:01] of all of this
[2:22:03] right he's taking me out and he's
[2:22:04] putting more of him in
[2:22:06] right that's
[2:22:08] that's where i believe god wants us to
[2:22:10] be totally subject
[2:22:12] to his will
[2:22:14] yes god whatever you want is what i want
[2:22:17] amen
[2:22:19] let's see you first
[2:22:23] just as
[2:22:25] i
[2:22:26] am
[2:22:27] [Music]
[2:22:28] without

[2:33:30] amen
[2:33:32] praise the lord it's one thing to sing
[2:33:33] it it's another thing to mean it
[2:33:35] actually take our lives and completely
[2:33:37] surrender it to him
[2:33:39] that he might have his way with us
[2:33:43] as we go let's sing i was born to be a
[2:33:45] dwelling place
[2:33:46] i believe that's appropriate
[2:33:49] and other people will be able to see
[2:33:50] christ dwelling in us
[2:33:52] as brother brown said for a lot of
[2:33:54] people that's all they will see of god
[2:33:56] it's what they see in us right
[2:33:58] so
[2:34:00] it's like i always say that
[2:34:03] that every every action
[2:34:05] that
[2:34:06] we go through that we present everything
[2:34:08] we say everything we do not not only
[2:34:10] here not here but outside
[2:34:13] is a reflection on christ it's a
[2:34:15] reflection on the body it's everything
[2:34:17] we do and say
[2:34:18] we're in a way we're under a microscope
[2:34:20] are we you know ministry feels that
[2:34:22] they're under a microscope and probably
[2:34:24] rightfully so you feel like you're a
[2:34:26] microscope for sure
[2:34:28] but believers are too because people are
[2:34:31] watching us right so how we conduct
[2:34:34] ourselves how we live how we talk
[2:34:36] and how we present ourselves is
[2:34:38] absolutely
[2:34:39] critical right
[2:34:41] it could mean the difference between
[2:34:42] heaven and hell for somebody
[2:34:45] amen what a responsibility
[2:34:48] so let's sing this tonight
[2:34:50] especially david become a close in
[2:34:52] prayer
[2:34:53] and pray one for another as we
[2:34:55] continue to
[2:34:57] soldier soldier on until the rapture
[2:34:59] takes place
[2:35:01] amen
[2:35:02] this time of pressure that's that's upon
[2:35:04] us and more to come
[2:35:06] we need each other more we need christ
[2:35:08] more
[2:35:10] amen so let's draw close to him and
[2:35:12] closer to each other as we go for the
[2:35:14] next few days and being prayerful by
[2:35:16] john as he brings you preaching sunday

[2:35:35] dwelling place
