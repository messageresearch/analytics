[47:36] amen said by faith abel offered unto god
[47:40] a more excellent sacrifice than cain
[47:44] amen
[47:45] and abel obtained a witness
[47:48] oh yeah
[47:49] praise the lord and it says by which he
[47:52] obtained witness that he was
[47:57] he was
[47:59] righteous

[48:08] the lord look what he did
[48:10] oh he had to write more the right
[48:11] objective lord look what he did
[48:13] yes but it it is by his intellect not
[48:16] his not not the spirit amen no doubt oh
[48:20] yeah but abel was there to give him a
[48:21] witness and what did he do he killed
[48:23] abel
[48:25] he didn't respect what abel did
[48:27] amen
[48:29] and he said lord he said and god said
[48:31] he's king where's evil
[48:33] god knew but he wanted able to see if
[48:35] cain would or he knew he wouldn't but

[48:51] humbled yourself to acknowledge what he
[48:53] what he has revealed to you
[48:56] by the grace of god
[48:58] amen and so it is it says that he
[49:00] offered under god a more excellent
[49:02] sacrifice than cain are we offering unto
[49:05] god more excellent sacrifice than what
[49:07] the kings in this hour is doing
[49:11] me cain
[49:13] what else
[49:15] it's king's in this hour too and not
[49:17] only that when it comes to even around

[49:22] lot of judases
[49:25] theirs yes

[49:34] pretended brothers he said that are
[49:37] there to betray you amen god help us

[50:18] he never had no bibles
[50:20] no it's just i i would say all that he
[50:23] had was the testimony of adam and eve
[50:25] that's right that's all what they what
[50:27] they let them know what happened in the
[50:29] garden and let them know this live and
[50:30] all that amen and then it struck abel
[50:33] that now we're outside

[51:24] excellent sacrifice

[51:28] excellent amen

[51:31] and it says by a wit by which he
[51:33] obtained witness
[51:35] he said that he was righteous

[1:08:37] under the right anointing amen so that
[1:08:40] brother on that day of pentecost he had

[1:08:44] brother said the holy ghost would would
[1:08:46] anoint peter and he would say this and
[1:08:47] he would say that amen he wasn't going
[1:08:49] to question it it wasn't going to be his
[1:08:51] intellect no it was going to be the
[1:08:52] spiritual revelation of the holy ghost

[1:23:18] amen oh yeah and he sort of made light
[1:23:21] of it and
[1:23:23] joked about it and and and
[1:23:26] to to his church and trying to say that
[1:23:28] i was wrong in in in giving them this
[1:23:31] quote it was a quote of the prophet in
[1:23:33] 1954 concerning the german warfare
[1:23:36] he said there's coming a german warfare
[1:23:39] amen and this and this and this and so
[1:23:42] on oh
[1:23:43] he said that's just to the jews that got
[1:23:45] nothing to do with us
[1:23:46] oh well i'll tell you this brother
[1:23:48] they're going to be surprised
[1:23:50] amen because the problem of god did say
[1:23:52] it's coming even to the gentiles

[1:43:24] praise the lord
[1:43:29] and verse 8
[1:43:33] and i john saw these things and heard
[1:43:35] them
[1:43:38] and when i had heard and seen i fell
[1:43:41] down to worship before the feet of the
[1:43:43] angel
[1:43:44] which showed me these things
[1:43:47] and then saith he unto me see thou do it
[1:43:49] not
[1:43:50] for i am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:43:53] brethren the prophets and of them which
[1:43:55] keep the sayings of this book worship
[1:43:57] god
[1:43:58] some have indicated that this was
[1:44:00] brother branham
[1:44:02] in in the ministry
[1:44:04] of that angel that that prophet for the
[1:44:07] last days
[1:44:08] amen
[1:44:10] to introduce jesus
[1:44:12] to the bridegroom
[1:44:14] that's right
[1:44:15] and that that's that's entire i'm not
[1:44:17] going to doubt it or say no it's not
[1:44:20] but they say this is this is
[1:44:22] this was william branham
[1:44:24] that angel represented william branham
[1:44:26] and he said he
[1:44:28] oh yeah because he was the one that
[1:44:30] revealed these things we're showing john
[1:44:32] these things showing this showing this
[1:44:34] and well he was the prophet to whom the
[1:44:36] mystery of god was revealed
[1:44:38] yeah amen
[1:44:41] and then saith thee unto me see thou do
[1:44:43] it not because john was going to worship
[1:44:44] him
[1:44:45] oh yeah
[1:44:47] yeah and there's there's many today that
[1:44:49] still worship william branham
[1:44:51] there are certain countries i could
[1:44:52] mention where we we've had the deal
[1:44:55] with brethren in those countries over
[1:44:57] the years we had to deal with brethren
[1:44:59] that are worshiping william branham
[1:45:02] yeah and there was one one of those
[1:45:04] countries that
[1:45:05] someone took pictures there and and
[1:45:07] there was believers marching oh yeah and
[1:45:10] they had big
[1:45:12] big
[1:45:13] pictures
[1:45:14] and and
[1:45:15] they were marching with those
[1:45:17] holding them up william branham is lord
[1:45:21] yeah
[1:45:22] william brown is jesus
[1:45:25] oh yeah
[1:45:26] yeah that's what they felt
[1:45:29] but he wasn't he was the prophet
[1:45:32] introducing jesus
[1:45:34] amen
[1:45:36] so he said and then john was going to
[1:45:38] worship worshiping right here
[1:45:41] and he said no no no don't worship me
[1:45:43] he said i'm just one of your brethren
[1:45:44] the prophets
[1:45:46] amen
[1:45:47] he said said unto me see thou do it not
[1:45:51] for i am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:45:53] brethren the prophets and of them which
[1:45:55] keep the sayings of this book worship
[1:45:57] god
[1:45:58] and i've had to deal with those brethren
[1:46:00] i've had to deal with those spirits
[1:46:02] trying to encourage them no no no
[1:46:05] that he was not god
[1:46:06] god was in him god was with him but
[1:46:08] revealing himself to us amen so i said
[1:46:11] he was just a prophet
[1:46:14] so the grace of god brother
[1:46:15] oh yeah and that's maybe one of the
[1:46:17] reasons why the lord had to take him
[1:46:21] as soon as he did at such a young age
[1:46:24] yeah
[1:46:27] oh yeah
[1:46:28] because there are people no not only in
[1:46:30] those those overseas countries there's
[1:46:32] also people even in america and canada
[1:46:34] that worship brother brown
[1:46:36] they did
[1:46:38] we've had to deal with that over the
[1:46:39] years
[1:46:40] grace to us
[1:46:43] well
[1:46:44] again the scripture
[1:46:46] because john was going to worship him
[1:46:48] the prophet
[1:46:50] amen
[1:46:51] because of what he was showing john
[1:46:53] because of what he was doing this this
[1:46:55] and this and john i guess he felt that
[1:46:57] he really was it was a deity of some
[1:47:00] there with the lord amen
[1:47:03] and he said unto me seal not the sayings
[1:47:06] of the prophecy of this book for the
[1:47:08] time is at end and he that is unjust let
[1:47:11] him be unjust still and he which is
[1:47:13] filthy lit and be filthy still and he
[1:47:16] that is righteous let him be righteous
[1:47:18] still what an hour we're living
[1:47:21] please let's stay with the word
[1:47:24] amen
[1:47:25] brother let's become more and more

[1:47:43] and he said let him be righteous and he
[1:47:45] that is holy let him be holy still and
[1:47:48] behold i come quickly and my reward is
[1:47:50] with me to give every man according as
[1:47:52] his work shall be
[1:47:54] again i am alpha and omega
[1:47:58] it is the revelation of god
[1:48:01] in redemption
[1:48:02] the beginning
[1:48:05] amen praise the lord
[1:48:08] god
[1:48:09] stepping down from eternity into time
[1:48:13] it is the eternal god
[1:48:15] revealing himself
[1:48:17] as the alpha of redemption and the omega
[1:48:21] he began it he finished it
[1:48:23] amen
