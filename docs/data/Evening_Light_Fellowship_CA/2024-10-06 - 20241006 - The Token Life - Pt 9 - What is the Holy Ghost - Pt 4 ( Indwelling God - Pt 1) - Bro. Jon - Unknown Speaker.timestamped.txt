[44:15] opportunities to witness and to talk to
[44:17] people and your heart gets full when you
[44:20] do that your heart's not full when you
[44:21] make a bunch of money your heart's not
[44:23] full when you get your new house or your
[44:25] nice car your heart's full when you find
[44:27] yourself walking in the will of God and
[44:30] he can use you that's the most
[44:31] fulfilling thing that you can have as a
[44:33] Believer is to do what God wants you to
[44:35] do and everything else just kind of
[44:36] Fades away when you do that and troubles
[44:38] and trials and concerns and these
[44:40] different things when we can say I'm
[44:42] about the father's business then
[44:44] everything else just kind of it just
[44:45] goes out of view doesn't it it goes out
[44:47] of focus and you're able to just you're
[44:49] content with life amen you're content
[44:51] with life and that so my heart's very
[44:52] full this morning very thankful to God
[44:55] for his grace amen John John chap 14
[44:57] and: 16 this is Jesus speaking to the
[45:00] disciples this is the night of the
[45:02] Passover he's in the The Upper Room at
[45:04] the Last
[45:06] Supper he says to the disciples and I
[45:08] will pray the father and he shall give
[45:10] you another comforter that he may abide
[45:13] with you forever even the spirit of
[45:16] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[45:18] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[45:20] him but ye know him for he dwelleth with
[45:23] you and shall be in you I will not leave
[45:26] you comfortless
[45:27] I will come to you he says yet a little
[45:29] while and the world seeth me no more but
[45:32] ye see me because I live ye shall live
[45:35] also at that day ye shall know that I am
[45:38] in my father and you in me and I in you
[45:42] amen God bless you can have your seats
[45:43] this morning we're continuing our series
[45:45] on the Holy Ghost and I want to we've
[45:47] been speaking on what is the Holy Ghost
[45:49] and I'm going to take a thought this
[45:50] morning there's no way we'll get through
[45:52] it in a single service and I'm trying to
[45:54] be a bit time conscious because we have
[45:55] communion and foot washing I know but I
[45:57] want to speak on indwelling God the
[45:59] indwelling god this morning and I know
[46:01] we're speaking on what is the Holy Ghost
[46:03] but really what we're talking about this
[46:04] morning is who is the Holy Ghost it is
[46:06] not a thing amen it is a person amen and
[46:09] it's important to answer this question
[46:11] because there's so many people are
[46:12] thinking there are many different things
[46:14] and I trust by God's grace not maybe not
[46:16] here this morning but we have to see
[46:18] what it is that that and who it is that
[46:20] that is dwelling in our lives this
[46:22] morning and you know we go back to the
[46:24] Old Testament and we see that the people
[46:26] were separated from God by a sin barrier
[46:28] God could come to us by his Sovereign
[46:30] will and he could cross over that
[46:32] barrier but we could not go to him amen
[46:35] there was no way we could go to him but
[46:37] God made a way that we could approach
[46:39] him and it was by the shed blood of an
[46:41] innocent animal and we were sinful the
[46:43] animal with sinless and he says I'll
[46:45] take the substitute I'll take the blood
[46:47] of that animal and that will allow you
[46:48] to approach me but only one man once a
[46:51] year could approach the presence of God
[46:53] where he dwelt in the temple of God and
[46:55] the holy of holies and so that man came
[46:57] in and he always had to come in with
[46:58] blood for himself and then he had to
[46:59] come in with blood if God accepted that
[47:01] then he came in with blood for the whole
[47:03] group and and and then after that then
[47:05] they could make their sacrifices and
[47:07] they could approach God in these
[47:08] different things but only once a year
[47:09] could somebody come in the presence of
[47:11] God that's all they had that's all they
[47:13] had and it was only everyone was left
[47:15] outside and really they were trusting
[47:16] the experience of that one man to let
[47:18] them know God's still alive God still
[47:20] cares God's present still with us in
[47:22] these different things but as brother
[47:23] Mark preached on a couple Wednesdays ago
[47:26] there was a way that was made amen and
[47:28] God Made A Way and it was through a
[47:29] kinsman redeemer and Christ came down
[47:31] and he was born a man he was born human
[47:33] he was just like you and I were except
[47:35] he was sinless and because he was human
[47:37] he could be a kinsman redeemer amen he
[47:40] could be a a price for us he could pay
[47:43] by his life and pay off that sin debt
[47:45] and it cleared our sin debt and it
[47:47] didn't just clear sin up to that point
[47:50] it cleared sin forever it's cleared sin
[47:52] in the past it cleared sin in the
[47:53] present and anything and everything we
[47:55] would do in the future it paid that sin
[47:57] debt for eternity amen when he came down
[48:00] that's the purpose of Christ coming to
[48:02] Earth the first time was to pay the
[48:04] price so that we could now come back
[48:06] into fellowship and relationship with
[48:08] God personally so we can become truly a
[48:10] part of the family of God like we were
[48:12] intended to from the very beginning now
[48:14] listen to this quotes he says when Jesus
[48:16] died at Calvary he settled the sin
[48:19] question
[48:20] forever forever before the father you
[48:23] know what that means Church it means
[48:24] when Satan comes to you and you have
[48:27] given your life to Christ and you've
[48:29] received what's at Calvary he cannot say
[48:31] you are sinful this morning that's the
[48:34] freedom we have this morning I'm not
[48:36] saying I didn't do it I'm saying he says
[48:38] I didn't do it and that's the one that
[48:40] counts is what God says not what I say
[48:42] so when Satan comes and he tries to
[48:44] convict me of things if I have repented
[48:47] if I have placed it under the blood of
[48:48] Jesus Christ it doesn't belong to me
[48:50] anymore it doesn't exist anymore it's
[48:53] not on the books he can't see it and
[48:56] Satan's let there stuttering in the
[48:57] presence of God trying to accuse me
[48:59] because there's nothing there to accuse
[49:01] he's saying I know I've got it somewhere
[49:02] I took it on my iPhone I saw what he did
[49:04] and then he goes to his iPhone and the
[49:06] video is not there it's erased by the
[49:07] blood of Christ the sin question is
[49:09] settled forever so don't let Satan put
[49:12] sin on you that you put under the blood
[49:14] of Jesus Christ insincere repentance he
[49:17] says he settled the sin question forever
[49:19] before the father because he was a
[49:21] perfect sacrifice for our sin he was our
[49:24] kinsman redeemer now Jesus didn't come
[49:27] down and die just for me or die just for
[49:29] you rather he settled the sing question
[49:32] but it'll never do us any good until we
[49:35] accept it it's your accepting of him as
[49:38] your personal savior it's by faith that
[49:41] you receive it and believe it he says
[49:44] now in Hebrews 3:1 the Bible said that
[49:46] he's the high priest of our confession
[49:48] now he's sitting at the right hand of
[49:50] the father to make intercessions for us
[49:53] Upon Our confession Church doesn't
[49:55] matter what you say it matters what you
[49:57] say it matters what you confess it
[49:59] matters what you speak before the
[50:00] presence of God he says now remember it
[50:04] isn't how much you cry it isn't how much
[50:07] you repent it isn't how loud you can cry
[50:10] to God it isn't how sincere you can be
[50:14] it's how much Faith you have when you
[50:17] come to him he doesn't save you on the
[50:19] merits of your prayer he doesn't save
[50:22] you upon the merits of your
[50:23] righteousness he saves you upon the
[50:25] merits of your faith it's by faith you
[50:29] are saved he says and that's through
[50:31] Grace scripture says by faith through
[50:33] Grace are you saved and that not of
[50:34] yourself it is the gift of God it's
[50:37] something that comes from God in the
[50:38] first place but we can get to this place
[50:40] even in our prayer life where we think
[50:42] we have to say something in such a
[50:44] flowery flowery or eloquent
[50:47] way and all God wants is a sincere and
[50:51] honest heart before him that's all he's
[50:53] asking you to do you don't you know some
[50:55] some people pray and it's intimidating
[50:57] when they pray because they just seem to
[50:59] be able to string it together and it
[51:00] sounds beautiful and you're like God
[51:02] just loves that doesn't he it's so
[51:04] wonderful God doesn't give a flip about
[51:07] how you say it he cares about whether
[51:09] there's sincerity of heart behind what
[51:11] you're saying and all you have to say
[51:14] you know there's things I pray about and
[51:16] I say Lord You've you've heard me
[51:18] thinking about this you see what's In My
[51:20] Heart Lord can you deal with it I don't
[51:23] even have to spell it out because
[51:24] sometimes I can't even spell out what's
[51:26] going on in my life sometimes but I just
[51:28] take it to him and I say Lord you see my
[51:31] life you see my thoughts you see what's
[51:33] going on Lord will you take it and will
[51:35] you move in my life and will you change
[51:37] me and will you help me to do what I'm
[51:39] supposed to do I don't have to come up
[51:41] with some great THS and thises and no no
[51:44] no just a simple conversation in simple
[51:48] humility before him and say Lord you see
[51:50] what's going on here I am do your work
[51:54] in my life that's all he's looking to do
[51:56] but our faith is always shown by our
[51:59] works it's what James said he says he he
[52:02] says you got to show me your faith by
[52:03] your works and so if we come and we say
[52:05] we've accepted Christ as our Savior by
[52:08] faith and we keep on living the way we
[52:10] did before then there's a problem with
[52:12] our faith because the blood of Calvary
[52:14] is not just to to justify us to to take
[52:17] away our sin but it's to cleanse us it's
[52:19] to take away the desires of this flesh
[52:22] it's to bring these things into
[52:23] subjection and so if we say we've
[52:25] accepted Christ by by faith and nothing
[52:27] has happened in our life to change us
[52:29] then our faith is not valid we've got to
[52:32] keep going we've got to keep pressing
[52:33] we've got to keep believing we've got to
[52:35] go get something until something really
[52:36] happens inside of our life because a
[52:39] changed life always follows a faithful
[52:41] and true acceptance of Christ always we
[52:44] have to be changed how can you accept
[52:46] something that you didn't have before
[52:47] and your life not be changed it has to
[52:49] be a changing that goes on but we can
[52:52] look in the Old Testament at men and
[52:54] women that had the spirit of God upon
[52:57] them amen and it's true that they didn't
[53:01] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[53:03] they had the spirit of the Lord upon
[53:04] them what is the spirit of the lord it's
[53:06] the holy spirit it's the Holy Ghost they
[53:08] had no less of the spirit on them but it
[53:12] was not a sealing of their soul like we
[53:14] have today but it was an anointing upon
[53:16] their body upon their flesh even upon
[53:19] their mind but it wasn't necessarily
[53:21] permanent and it wasn't necessarily
[53:23] life-changing but yet it had power and
[53:25] authority with it amen I'm just going to
[53:27] read a couple scriptures to show you
[53:29] what I'm talking about to set a pattern
[53:30] in the scripture because that's where we
[53:32] ought to get our patterns from and
[53:33] speaking of Gideon it says but the
[53:35] spirit of the Lord Came Upon Gideon and
[53:38] he blew a trumpet and a beeser was
[53:40] gathered after him so God sends down his
[53:43] own Spirit upon Gideon and what does it
[53:44] do it takes Gideon from a place uh uh
[53:47] being a wimp from being a coward to
[53:49] being a warrior to being able to act
[53:52] upon what God wants him to do doesn't
[53:55] change Gideon's life forever but it
[53:56] gives him
[53:57] courage amen then we come down to Samson
[54:01] it says then Samson went down and his
[54:03] father and his father and mother to
[54:05] Timnath and came to The Vineyards of
[54:07] tinth and behold a young lion roared
[54:09] against him and what happened the spirit
[54:12] of the Lord came mightily upon him this
[54:15] is a mighty anointing this is a powerful
[54:17] anointing and he rent he tore as he
[54:20] would have torn a kid as a as a baby
[54:23] goat and he had nothing in his hands he
[54:25] literally ripped that lying in two with
[54:27] his bare hands so the spirit of the Lord
[54:30] on Samson makes him supernaturally
[54:33] strong he didn't have that power without
[54:36] the spirit of the Lord he was as if you
[54:37] were
[54:38] I we see that because remember when the
[54:41] spirit of the Lord leaves him he
[54:42] literally becomes as you or I he says
[54:44] that's what happened if you'll cut my
[54:45] hair I'll become as weak as other men
[54:48] and he was but when the spirit of the
[54:50] Lord is upon him when the need was there
[54:52] an anointing from the Lord would come
[54:54] upon him and he would become super
[54:56] naturally strong then we have Saul
[55:00] talking to or Samuel speaking to Saul
[55:03] and it says and the spirit of the Lord
[55:05] he's he's he's prophesying over Saul he
[55:07] says the spirit of the Lord will come
[55:08] upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with
[55:11] them and shalt be turned into another
[55:13] man and Saul goes to the school of the
[55:15] prophets and as he comes in there the
[55:17] spirit of the Lord falls upon him and he
[55:19] starts to prophesy have never done it
[55:22] before and then the people said is Saul
[55:23] also one of the prophets but it wasn't
[55:26] SA was a prophet rather the spirit of
[55:28] the Lord came upon him and it caused the
[55:30] supernatural to happen in Saul's life
[55:32] amen he'd never done that before he does
[55:35] it one more time in the future but he
[55:37] doesn't have a changed life he just has
[55:41] an anointing on him and it does
[55:43] something that God does Amen that God
[55:45] does in a person the scripture even says
[55:47] God gave Saul a new heart did you know
[55:50] that it says go God gave Saul a new
[55:52] heart in preparation for the kingdom but
[55:54] it took the anointing on him to achieve
[55:56] anything that shows good intentions are
[55:59] not enough people will go to hell with
[56:01] good intentions because they don't have
[56:03] the power to act on them I never meant
[56:06] to or I wanted to I always tried but I
[56:08] could never do it that's not going to be
[56:09] enough it's going to take something
[56:11] greater than that then we see we go into
[56:13] a little further in first Samuel and now
[56:15] Samuel's before David it says then
[56:17] Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed
[56:19] him in the midst of his Brethren and the
[56:21] spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from
[56:24] that day forward so s DAV David receives
[56:27] the spirit of God upon him as an
[56:28] anointing that's the king anointing amen
[56:32] and David had that anointing on him all
[56:34] the days of his life
[56:37] amen we see the spirit of God what it
[56:40] was on these men and even in somebody as
[56:42] as as Fallen as Samson and Saul got to
[56:45] their life in their lives yet we see
[56:47] what a glorious thing it was when the
[56:48] spirit of God comes upon a person it
[56:50] does wonderful things amen but you'll
[56:53] see that an anointing upon you is for
[56:55] action
[56:56] rather than for
[56:58] change anyone can literally have the
[57:01] spirit of the Lord upon them and they
[57:02] can do Mighty things under that
[57:04] Supernatural anointing and so it is an
[57:06] anointing for works but it is not
[57:08] life-changing and it is not the working
[57:10] of a soul God would send his Spirit on
[57:12] people to do something that needed to be
[57:14] done he would bring Deliverance he would
[57:16] bring change he would bring judgment he
[57:17] would do all these sorts of things but
[57:19] those people were not changed eternally
[57:21] or completely under that anointing amen
[57:25] it was an anointing of on them but it
[57:27] wasn't in them and we would maybe treat
[57:28] it like a coat or a jacket where the
[57:30] anointing of God would come on them and
[57:31] so it's like if this was a super jacket
[57:34] and as soon as I put it on I get super
[57:36] strength and so I put it on and all of a
[57:38] sudden I can go down and I can lift up
[57:40] these pews without anybody's help and
[57:42] that's God coming down because the Pew
[57:44] needs to be moved and then that
[57:45] anointing goes away and I go to try lift
[57:47] that Pew and what happens
[57:50] nothing why there's no anointing to do
[57:52] it there's no anointing to do it God
[57:53] would send down anointing on people with
[57:56] purpose amen but we see that David under
[57:59] this anointing had an affair with a
[58:01] married woman and then went and killed
[58:03] her husband and nearly killed nabal amen
[58:08] we can look at Samson Samson goes down
[58:11] and visits a
[58:13] prostitute and then walks to the gates
[58:16] of the city and Picks Them Up by
[58:17] Supernatural strength the anointing had
[58:20] nothing to do with his soul had nothing
[58:23] to do with his good heart it was God had
[58:26] anointed him for purpose and that was to
[58:27] judge the children of Israel and to
[58:29] bring uh deliverance from the
[58:31] Philistines but that's not where we're
[58:33] at today that's not where we're at today
[58:36] amen I preached it before the anointing
[58:38] on King Saul was the spirit of the Lord
[58:40] and the the the anointing on King David
[58:41] was the spirit of the Lord it was the
[58:43] exact same anointing and it had
[58:45] completely different results Saul had
[58:47] victories the anointing gave him
[58:49] victories but it did not change his life
[58:52] and even with his new heart Saul could
[58:54] never come around to the place where D
[58:56] was where it was about the people and
[58:58] serving people and deliverance rather
[59:00] than self-image and preservation and
[59:02] pride and all these different things the
[59:04] exact same anointing why because they
[59:05] had different motives in their lives
[59:07] David's anointing David's motive was to
[59:10] what Serve the People and serve God and
[59:12] Saul just wanted to promote himself and
[59:14] that's what that's what led to his
[59:15] downfall amen but many wonderful Works
[59:18] done by people with an anointing on them
[59:20] and yet no Heart Change no soul change
[59:23] no life change none of these different
[59:24] things amen and so what happened is as
[59:27] they even these people these great
[59:28] Heroes of the faith when their lives
[59:30] came to an end they could not go into
[59:32] the presence of God and so they went to
[59:35] a waiting place they went to paradise
[59:37] and they waited there until Christ died
[59:39] and then as soon as Christ died
[59:41] scripture says that the graves were open
[59:43] there was a
[59:44] resurrection and they came forth out of
[59:46] it it talks about it in Matthew 27 and
[59:49] they went and they they they walked
[59:50] among the people for a while and then
[59:52] they were caught up into the presence of
[59:54] God it took the blood of of Christ even
[59:57] with people that had a wonderful
[59:58] anointing of the spirit on them to bring
[1:00:00] them into the presence of God Amen why
[1:00:02] am I saying this church I'm saying this
[1:00:04] because people will go on and on about
[1:00:06] the presence of the holy spirit in
[1:00:08] church and in their lives and the
[1:00:10] anointing of the Holy Spirit on your
[1:00:12] flesh will not take you into heaven it
[1:00:15] won't do it it won't do it it can't do
[1:00:17] it we see it in the Old Testament we see
[1:00:19] it in the New Testament I was talking
[1:00:21] with a friend last night at our house
[1:00:23] and he said and he reminded me he says
[1:00:25] Caiaphas the one that condemned Christ
[1:00:28] prophesied under a true anointing of the
[1:00:30] Holy
[1:00:32] Spirit and that man went to hell he
[1:00:36] crucified Christ he called the word as
[1:00:39] something of
[1:00:40] Satan but yet under that anointing he
[1:00:42] could prophesy and he prophesied 100%
[1:00:45] correct under that anointing amen like I
[1:00:48] said Samson's the greatest example of
[1:00:49] this that a man that could go and visit
[1:00:52] prostitute after prostitute and yet he
[1:00:53] could have the spirit of the Lord upon
[1:00:55] him for Supernatural strengths and
[1:00:57] Feats but yet completely flawed
[1:01:01] completely flawed and yet God was with
[1:01:03] him amen so we see that an anointing
[1:01:06] upon you is to put you into action
[1:01:08] whereas an anointing in you is to change
[1:01:10] you so that you can be trustfully used
[1:01:13] for action in the future amen one is to
[1:01:16] do with character the inside is
[1:01:17] developing that character and changing
[1:01:19] the will and desire the one upon you is
[1:01:21] God just needs something done so he puts
[1:01:22] it on whoever he will and that's his
[1:01:24] choosing that's the sovereignty of God
[1:01:25] God that he would do those things but
[1:01:27] I'm saying that because today we can sit
[1:01:29] and we can have a great church service
[1:01:31] and we can have shouting and we can feel
[1:01:33] the presence of God and we can have
[1:01:34] worship and all of these wonderful
[1:01:36] things and we love it don't we we love
[1:01:38] it when we can genuinely feel literally
[1:01:41] feel the presence and the anointing of
[1:01:43] God here and then what happens is we can
[1:01:45] walk right out that door and do things
[1:01:46] that Christians should never do why
[1:01:48] because it was something on us not in US
[1:01:51] amen it didn't go out the church door
[1:01:53] with us it didn't get into our car with
[1:01:54] us it didn't go into our homes with us
[1:01:56] rather that presence was here because
[1:01:58] God was fulfilling his word where two or
[1:02:00] three are gathered in my name I'll be
[1:02:01] there but when we go out the door
[1:02:03] there's got to be something in us not
[1:02:04] something on us if we're going to hold
[1:02:05] ourselves throughout the week that's the
[1:02:07] only thing that's going to do it amen we
[1:02:09] can have an anointing on us today you
[1:02:12] can come into church and you can be
[1:02:14] somebody who is not a prophet but an
[1:02:16] anointing can come on you this very day
[1:02:18] and you can
[1:02:19] prophesy you're not a prophet has
[1:02:22] nothing to do with your soul but the
[1:02:24] anointing of the Lord can come on you
[1:02:25] and you can prophesy you can speak in
[1:02:27] tongues you can go lay hands on somebody
[1:02:30] and they will be healed by your prayer
[1:02:31] just an anointing it's an unction it's a
[1:02:33] moving of God in the congregation for
[1:02:35] the edifying of the body but that has
[1:02:37] not one thing to do with your soul
[1:02:40] that's just your somebody that made
[1:02:41] himself available and so God can come
[1:02:44] down and do that that's it and guess
[1:02:46] what there's lots of people available
[1:02:47] for power cuz we love the power we love
[1:02:51] the anointing we love those things when
[1:02:52] they come but how many people want the
[1:02:54] surrender cuz that's where you have him
[1:02:57] in cuz he can only come in by surrender
[1:03:00] you can't just put on a jacket of God
[1:03:01] and walk out and Conquer everything you
[1:03:03] need him on the inside because the first
[1:03:04] one he's got to conquer is me not what's
[1:03:07] out there amen so God was using his his
[1:03:11] children with to do great things you
[1:03:13] look at Moses Moses maybe the most
[1:03:15] phenomenal man in the Old Testament the
[1:03:18] signs and wonders and and the
[1:03:20] relationship he had with God God spoke
[1:03:22] lip to ear with him God revealed himself
[1:03:24] to Moses as he did know other man in the
[1:03:27] Old Testament it wasn't until Paul came
[1:03:29] that God would reveal himself maybe in a
[1:03:30] similar way in fact Moses was the
[1:03:33] pattern for
[1:03:34] Christ that's how amazing Moses was and
[1:03:38] yet he did not have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:41] Inside but he could do wonderful things
[1:03:43] with these things and so what happens is
[1:03:45] there was an anointing on people but
[1:03:47] under the law they were in a holding
[1:03:49] pattern they had come out of something
[1:03:52] but they couldn't progress because they
[1:03:53] had this sin barrier there and so
[1:03:55] they're in a holding pattern of works
[1:03:57] works works works and it never held them
[1:03:59] the anointing on them never held they'd
[1:04:01] have judges come in and the judges would
[1:04:03] get things right and then the judges
[1:04:04] would die and the people would go right
[1:04:05] back into their sins the law never held
[1:04:07] them amen sin was a barrier they
[1:04:09] couldn't cross and they were in that
[1:04:11] place where they couldn't go back cuz
[1:04:12] they've been called out and they
[1:04:13] couldn't go forward because they
[1:04:14] couldn't cross the barrier they couldn't
[1:04:15] cross the Gap into the presence of God
[1:04:17] so they had this wonderful place of
[1:04:18] obedience without a life-changing
[1:04:20] experience that's a rough place to live
[1:04:22] church that's a rough place to live but
[1:04:24] that's what a religious EXP experience
[1:04:26] is is it's obedience without the
[1:04:27] Fulfillment of what you've been
[1:04:28] believing amen it's by your discipline
[1:04:31] rather than that but God said there's
[1:04:32] going to come a day where I'm going to
[1:04:33] cross that barrier I'm going to I'm
[1:04:35] going to take and I'm going to make a
[1:04:37] way across that Gap there's going to be
[1:04:39] a door open and you're going to be able
[1:04:40] to live the way you've been trying to
[1:04:42] live all this time amen and it was a
[1:04:44] time where he would dwell in his people
[1:04:46] rather than just rest upon them or be
[1:04:48] above them even as the case was you'll
[1:04:50] notice the presence of the of the pillar
[1:04:52] of fire never made the people serve God
[1:04:55] they still had their whinings their
[1:04:57] complainings they had their idolatry
[1:04:58] they had all these things all these
[1:05:00] things and the pillar fire right there
[1:05:02] the presence of God in their midst why
[1:05:04] because it takes them in here to really
[1:05:06] do the change now we read this before
[1:05:08] and so I'm going to I'm going to go
[1:05:09] through it quickly this morning but it's
[1:05:10] part of the foundation here and it's in
[1:05:13] Ezekiel 36 again and and and it's God
[1:05:15] speaking to the children of Israel but
[1:05:17] this is speaking to the to the spiritual
[1:05:20] seed not just the natural seed amen it's
[1:05:22] to the spiritual children he says then
[1:05:25] when I will I sprinkle clean water upon
[1:05:27] you and you shall be clean from all your
[1:05:29] filthiness and from all your Idols will
[1:05:30] I cleanse you this is preparation it's
[1:05:32] not the finished work but it's preparing
[1:05:34] for the thing that's coming he says a
[1:05:36] new art also will I give you and a new
[1:05:38] spirit will I put within you and I'll
[1:05:40] take away the Stony heart out of your
[1:05:42] flesh and I'll give you a heart of Flesh
[1:05:44] so notice now that they've been cleaned
[1:05:46] they need an attitude change they need a
[1:05:47] mindset change they need a desire change
[1:05:50] and they need to be open to what's
[1:05:51] coming at the end of this so God is
[1:05:53] making them amenable to him he's making
[1:05:56] them friendly towards them him he's
[1:05:58] making them open towards him amen so
[1:06:00] that they could get along with God in a
[1:06:02] way they never could before so it's
[1:06:03] preparation but it's not the finished
[1:06:05] work yet but then in verse 27 he says
[1:06:08] and I will put my spirit personal
[1:06:10] pronoun my spirit within you and cause
[1:06:13] you to walk in my statutes and you shall
[1:06:16] keep my judgments and you shall do them
[1:06:19] see before they were doing works but
[1:06:21] they couldn't keep the law they couldn't
[1:06:22] fulfill the word but he says when I put
[1:06:24] it within you it will cause you you
[1:06:26] won't be able to help it when you have
[1:06:28] my spirit within you then you can't help
[1:06:30] but identify with the word you can't
[1:06:32] help but obey the word because his word
[1:06:34] is written in your heart it's living in
[1:06:36] your heart now and you can't get away
[1:06:38] from it your conscience won't let you
[1:06:39] get away with it you're the most unhappy
[1:06:42] person in the world when you know you're
[1:06:43] outside of the word of God it was it it
[1:06:46] was interesting talking to again this
[1:06:48] friend last night and he was saying you
[1:06:49] know there was a I was struggling in my
[1:06:51] life with with I had a desire to do
[1:06:53] right and I wasn't doing it and and it
[1:06:55] seemed like I do the things I didn't
[1:06:56] want to do much like Paul in Romans 7
[1:06:58] and he says and I was talking to another
[1:07:00] another coworker and he says you know
[1:07:03] what do you do with that you know when
[1:07:04] when you want to do something but you
[1:07:06] know you shouldn't do it and the guy
[1:07:07] said what are you talking
[1:07:10] about he said and that's when I realized
[1:07:13] not everyone has something inside of
[1:07:16] them that checks them not everyone has a
[1:07:18] conscience the way a Believer does not
[1:07:20] everyone has something on the inside
[1:07:22] that says
[1:07:23] whoa hold on a second
[1:07:26] here do you really think you ought to be
[1:07:28] doing this and he said it was just a a
[1:07:31] mindblowing moment that there are people
[1:07:33] out there with no checks and balances in
[1:07:34] their life how blessed we are this
[1:07:36] morning we have checks and balances
[1:07:38] church amen but that's what that's what
[1:07:41] happens to a child of God is that God
[1:07:43] has put something in us that says hold
[1:07:44] on a second and not everybody has that
[1:07:48] the tears don't have that the weeds
[1:07:50] don't have that only the wheat has that
[1:07:52] amen it's the children of God that have
[1:07:54] that you always see scripture after
[1:07:56] scripture like we read the spirit of God
[1:07:57] Came Upon so and so and it was temporary
[1:08:00] and it was not an internal work but it
[1:08:02] was an external Force bringing them to
[1:08:04] do a great work and they could do those
[1:08:05] extraordinary things but their heart
[1:08:07] wasn't changed their life wasn't changed
[1:08:09] and that but you'll see this yet that
[1:08:12] never stopped the anointing of
[1:08:14] God their flawed personality their
[1:08:16] flawed human traits their their
[1:08:18] weaknesses and those things church God
[1:08:20] is Not held back by our failures and our
[1:08:23] faults and our weaknesses
[1:08:25] in fact his strength is made perfect in
[1:08:27] them amen but here's the thing neither
[1:08:30] is his strength made any Greater by our
[1:08:33] strengths amen it works both ways we add
[1:08:36] Nothing by our negativity and we add
[1:08:38] Nothing by our positivity it's God and
[1:08:41] God alone that's doing the work inside
[1:08:42] of our Lives amen that's sometimes the
[1:08:44] hardest thing is when we think we've got
[1:08:46] something to add and God's like are you
[1:08:48] kidding me compared to me what you have
[1:08:50] is nothing the greatest thing you have
[1:08:52] is nothing compared to the wisdom the
[1:08:54] knowledge the strength the the power the
[1:08:56] understanding of
[1:08:57] God but if we can surrender it now God
[1:09:00] can work through it and God can expand
[1:09:02] it
[1:09:03] amen but whatever God needed those men
[1:09:06] and women to do when that anointing came
[1:09:08] on them they could do it and Samson
[1:09:10] would go and he would tear a lion in
[1:09:11] half can you imagine tearing an animal
[1:09:14] in half a four or 500 lb Lion in half
[1:09:17] with your bare hands you can't do it
[1:09:19] those of you that hunt the Moose just
[1:09:21] trying to get into a hide with a knife
[1:09:23] is hard enough and he took that line and
[1:09:25] he just
[1:09:27] went then he goes and he kills a
[1:09:29] thousand Philistines with a Jawbone of a
[1:09:32] donkey against swords against heavy
[1:09:35] armor shamgar the spirit of the Lord
[1:09:37] comes upon him and he kills 600 people
[1:09:39] by himself 600 train Philistines with an
[1:09:42] ox goat a prod a piece of wood a staff
[1:09:45] of wood with a brass or an iron tip on
[1:09:47] it and he kills 600 Philistines with it
[1:09:50] when the spirit of God comes on
[1:09:52] them and man Gideon with 300 men
[1:09:54] destroys
[1:09:57] 120,000 enemy
[1:09:59] soldiers that's what the spirit of God
[1:10:01] on you can do and most of us would stop
[1:10:04] there and say praise the Lord I've got
[1:10:06] it and all they had was something that
[1:10:10] left it left and they were left with
[1:10:12] their own hearts and with their own
[1:10:14] desires and their own faults and their
[1:10:15] own failures and these different things
[1:10:17] but remember God came into all of this
[1:10:19] and he's got this Plan of Redemption
[1:10:21] that's the key through scripture I will
[1:10:24] restore I will bring you back I'll bring
[1:10:26] you back to your place I'll bring you
[1:10:28] back to your position I'll bring you
[1:10:29] back to your inheritance I'll bring you
[1:10:31] back to me I'll restore the unity that
[1:10:34] we had before this all began and so God
[1:10:36] comes behind and that's what Ezekiel 36
[1:10:38] is amen is that it's God restoring his
[1:10:41] people back and what is he doing he's
[1:10:43] bringing Gods back to God we've said
[1:10:45] this before dogs produce dogs cats
[1:10:47] produce cats what do gods produce God
[1:10:50] produces other gods they're his children
[1:10:52] they are not the fullness they are not
[1:10:54] the all in all but nonetheless the
[1:10:56] scripture says that we are
[1:10:58] Gods right here right now we are not
[1:11:01] because we're in a time of character
[1:11:03] development but our inheritance is that
[1:11:05] we rule and Reign and we sit in the
[1:11:06] throne with him we sit in the throne
[1:11:09] with God ruling and reigning that's our
[1:11:12] original position amen why because Sons
[1:11:14] and Daughters of God have the nature of
[1:11:16] God in them and that's what he's
[1:11:17] bringing out it's the character the
[1:11:19] nature of God he's tying us to the word
[1:11:21] of God in this life so that we may move
[1:11:23] on to the next one when we go into the
[1:11:24] millenni and then we we live for
[1:11:27] eternity after that what do we see we
[1:11:29] have the character to do that because
[1:11:31] we've been made one with the word we
[1:11:32] don't see all that reality now but when
[1:11:35] we go to be with him that's when we
[1:11:36] receive the full elements of of our of
[1:11:39] our inheritance as Sons and Daughters of
[1:11:40] God and church it's going to take more
[1:11:42] than a church experience to do that amen
[1:11:45] a church experience will not return you
[1:11:46] to your position in Christ it'll make
[1:11:49] you feel good it'll make you feel safe
[1:11:50] it'll make you feel warm and fuzzy but
[1:11:52] it will not change you it will not
[1:11:55] listen we don't like character
[1:11:56] development anybody here like character
[1:11:58] development no good we're we're in an
[1:12:00] honest mood this morning it's good
[1:12:03] nobody likes character development
[1:12:05] because it's trials and tribulations but
[1:12:07] when we come out on the other side we
[1:12:09] love it we love it when we see that
[1:12:11] there's an element of God inside of us
[1:12:13] but what did it take to bring it out
[1:12:15] trials and
[1:12:16] tribulations we hate the work but we
[1:12:18] love the effect amen again speaking with
[1:12:22] this friend and he says I think it was
[1:12:24] Peter that talks about he says we go
[1:12:26] through these things and if we're
[1:12:27] exercised by them we get the benefit in
[1:12:30] other words if we realize what's going
[1:12:31] on and we embrace them rather than try
[1:12:34] and speak them out of existence rather
[1:12:36] than try and Escape them if we can
[1:12:38] Embrace what we're going through then it
[1:12:39] can do the work that is needed and we
[1:12:41] can get out of that trial and
[1:12:42] tribulation that test whatever those
[1:12:44] things are going through amen but it
[1:12:46] takes more than a church experience it
[1:12:47] takes more than the law it takes more
[1:12:49] than an anointing in the building the
[1:12:50] anointing in the building will bring you
[1:12:52] to a New Birth but it is not the new
[1:12:53] birth itself amen it'll take more than
[1:12:56] just an anointing Upon Us it'll take a
[1:12:58] greater experience than Moses had Moses
[1:13:00] got to see the back of
[1:13:03] God he was in the very presence of God
[1:13:06] God came down and spoke into Moses ear
[1:13:10] that's how close he was and yet that
[1:13:12] wasn't enough Moses was a Son of
[1:13:14] God but he needed the Holy Ghost he
[1:13:17] needed a covering of his sin before he
[1:13:19] could come into the presence of God what
[1:13:21] will it take Church it'll take verse 27
[1:13:24] that's the only way we're we're going to
[1:13:25] get back we've got to have his Spirit
[1:13:27] within us to change us from the inside
[1:13:30] out and that'll produce the word in our
[1:13:32] lives amen see when we have an anointing
[1:13:34] upon us the anointing is not there
[1:13:36] trying to change us it's just trying to
[1:13:38] get us to do something that's all the
[1:13:41] anointing on you is to just put you into
[1:13:43] action amen and you can't change a
[1:13:44] person from the outside in can you
[1:13:46] brother Mark we were talking about this
[1:13:47] the other day that's what people are
[1:13:48] trying to do is they're trying to force
[1:13:50] it in by theology by Doctrine by a
[1:13:52] church experience by outward signs and
[1:13:55] wonders whatever it might be they're
[1:13:56] trying to get people to be something but
[1:13:59] you can't be what you're not you can't
[1:14:02] be what you're not and we can wrap it up
[1:14:04] in a cloak of religion we can wrap it up
[1:14:06] in a in a cloak of the presence of the
[1:14:07] Holy Spirit we can wrap it in a cloak of
[1:14:09] signs and wonders whatever it might be
[1:14:11] but in the end that doesn't change your
[1:14:14] heart it doesn't change your life and
[1:14:16] none of those things will will happen as
[1:14:18] needed remember what David said he says
[1:14:20] Thy word have I hid in my heart that I
[1:14:23] might not sin against the remember they
[1:14:24] have those what are they uh
[1:14:30] uh it
[1:14:32] start I don't want to say the other word
[1:14:34] because it means something completely
[1:14:35] different but remember they put the Jews
[1:14:36] would put it on their arms and on their
[1:14:38] foreheads they'd have a little box there
[1:14:39] and they put the word of God in there
[1:14:42] that won't change you carrying your
[1:14:44] Bible around won't change you they were
[1:14:46] what they were doing an outward work
[1:14:48] trying to represent the righteousness
[1:14:50] that they couldn't achieve on their own
[1:14:51] they didn't have it but they wanted to
[1:14:53] look good and so we can do all the these
[1:14:55] things amen but what would David say he
[1:14:57] says I've got to get your word in my
[1:14:58] heart and that'll get me to walk right
[1:15:01] that'll get me to live right that's
[1:15:02] what's really going to have a lasting
[1:15:04] effect is not on what I can say and do
[1:15:05] but if I can get the change in here it
[1:15:07] will force its way out because what you
[1:15:09] are is what you will be and if it's on
[1:15:12] the inside then that's what's going to
[1:15:13] come out amen you know let me stop here
[1:15:15] for a second I don't know your thoughts
[1:15:17] this morning I don't know what you've
[1:15:19] dealt with this week I don't know your
[1:15:20] mindset I might know your attitude a bit
[1:15:22] by having some interaction with you amen
[1:15:24] but we go through life it when you're
[1:15:26] born again those things will change and
[1:15:29] you will know it I won't know it for a
[1:15:32] little bit of time because it takes a
[1:15:34] while for the inside to come out out on
[1:15:36] the outside but what you will know is
[1:15:38] you know when your thoughts change you
[1:15:40] know when your desires change you know
[1:15:42] when your attitude changes and then that
[1:15:44] comes out in Works
[1:15:46] later but you know it so you say brother
[1:15:49] John how do I know when I've got the
[1:15:50] Holy Ghost I'll tell you one thing
[1:15:52] you'll notice a change on the inside
[1:15:55] your mindset your approach your desires
[1:15:57] will be completely changed because now
[1:16:00] it's Christ on the inside not you not
[1:16:02] the old man not the old woman that was
[1:16:04] inside of there and so you can sit here
[1:16:06] and I can sit here all day long and say
[1:16:07] I've got the Holy Ghost but in the on
[1:16:09] the inside of insights I know what I am
[1:16:11] and I know what I'm
[1:16:12] not and that's where my rest is is that
[1:16:15] I've had a personal experience
[1:16:17] regardless of what you might think about
[1:16:18] me now it matters what you think about
[1:16:20] me amen we're supposed to be able to see
[1:16:23] that we're Believers that we're
[1:16:24] Christians by the lives that we live but
[1:16:26] sometimes there's a lag between who we
[1:16:28] are and the change we've had and what it
[1:16:29] comes out cuz there's an undoing of all
[1:16:31] the mess that we've been stuck under all
[1:16:33] the mud that's piled up in our life it
[1:16:35] takes a while to dig out of that
[1:16:36] sometimes but then what comes through is
[1:16:38] life and we say oh my goodness wow wow
[1:16:41] what happened to her what happened to
[1:16:43] him what is it it's the Holy Ghost
[1:16:45] Inside of them changing their lives
[1:16:47] what's on the inside has to come out
[1:16:49] same thing if you're not converted if
[1:16:51] you're not born again we can wrap
[1:16:52] ourselves in religion all we want to but
[1:16:54] in the and your temper is going to snap
[1:16:56] your words are going to come out your
[1:16:57] response is going to be the way it's not
[1:16:59] supposed to be and people will say whoa
[1:17:00] what happened not that we never lose our
[1:17:03] temper not that we never make mistakes
[1:17:05] that's not what I'm saying but the
[1:17:06] general trajectory of our life is
[1:17:09] Christlike with the occasional wind
[1:17:11] going to
[1:17:12] humanity sometimes more than we want
[1:17:15] to but I'm saying that to say this if
[1:17:18] you want to see a change in your life
[1:17:21] don't seek the fruits don't seek the
[1:17:24] gifts
[1:17:25] don't seek the effects seek the
[1:17:29] change seek the change on the inside
[1:17:32] everything else will follow after that
[1:17:34] if you change what's in here everything
[1:17:36] has to change amen it'll change our
[1:17:38] heart it'll change our mind our thoughts
[1:17:40] our approach nature everything sometimes
[1:17:43] the biggest change that's needed in
[1:17:44] circumstances is me not the
[1:17:47] circumstance speaking with my wife as we
[1:17:49] were walking the other day and just
[1:17:51] talking about a certain situation I said
[1:17:53] when we approach these things the first
[1:17:54] first thing we have to do is say Lord
[1:17:56] what is it in me that needs to
[1:17:59] change not the circumstance not the
[1:18:02] person not my finances not my health
[1:18:06] Lord let's take a look at me first let's
[1:18:08] put me under the microscope in honesty
[1:18:10] and humility and insincerity and say
[1:18:12] Lord where's the work here cuz so many
[1:18:15] times church if he can change me he
[1:18:17] doesn't even have to touch the other
[1:18:18] person
[1:18:20] right that's where I'm at Lord start
[1:18:24] with me
[1:18:25] we sang that song Today send a Revival
[1:18:27] start the work of me first thing that
[1:18:29] starts Revival church is repentance and
[1:18:31] humility and you say I'm not where I
[1:18:33] ought to be take me there and that's
[1:18:35] what Revival is is it brings it to life
[1:18:36] in your life amen Jesus said in Matthew
[1:18:39] 12 he says wherefor I say unto you all
[1:18:42] manner of sin and blasphemy shall shall
[1:18:44] be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy
[1:18:47] against the Holy Ghost shall not be
[1:18:48] forgiven unto men this is the only sin
[1:18:51] that can't be forgiven and what is it
[1:18:52] it's when you call something that is of
[1:18:54] god and say that's of that's of Satan
[1:18:57] you say something is of God and you and
[1:18:59] then you say no no no that's not of God
[1:19:02] Amen there's a Grace for ignorance and
[1:19:04] Christ comes here amen and he's talking
[1:19:06] to the priests and they're saying Jesus
[1:19:07] cast out Devils by the spirit of Satan
[1:19:10] Jesus said that that that can't work a
[1:19:12] kingdom divided against itself can can't
[1:19:14] can't can't stand if I'm fighting in my
[1:19:17] own household how is my household going
[1:19:18] to stand he says I'd be destroying my
[1:19:20] own kingdom if I did that but he didn't
[1:19:22] come with judgment he says and whosoever
[1:19:25] speaketh a word against the son of man
[1:19:27] it shall be forgiven him Jesus is here
[1:19:29] as son of man that's always a prophetic
[1:19:30] Ministry so Jesus is here as a prophet
[1:19:33] and church what always happens to
[1:19:34] prophets they're rejected so prophets
[1:19:38] can't judge you for rejecting them
[1:19:40] because that's the way it goes the word
[1:19:42] they bring is what judges you but that
[1:19:43] man does not judge you cuz they know
[1:19:46] they're going to be rejected by 99.9% of
[1:19:48] the people so Christ is there as a
[1:19:50] prophet and he's there and with
[1:19:52] forgiveness and even to the point of his
[1:19:54] his last breath he says father forgive
[1:19:57] them they don't know what they're doing
[1:19:58] cuz prophets are always rejected and
[1:20:00] he's there he wasn't there to judge he
[1:20:02] was there to forgive he was there with
[1:20:04] Mercy amen he says but whosoever
[1:20:07] speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall
[1:20:08] not be forgiven him neither in this
[1:20:10] world neither in the world to come you
[1:20:12] start speaking against things of God
[1:20:14] you're on very very very dangerous
[1:20:17] ground amen sometimes that's why we need
[1:20:20] to shut up when we're speaking with
[1:20:22] people and if there is a resistance to
[1:20:24] what we're speaking what do we do Church
[1:20:27] stop do not push because what happens is
[1:20:31] in their ignorance or anger or whatever
[1:20:34] it might be defensiveness they may speak
[1:20:37] out against that and God would have to
[1:20:39] judge them if you ever feel them pushing
[1:20:42] back stop just stop and say that's okay
[1:20:46] brother that's okay sister let's just
[1:20:48] leave it there for now cuz you don't
[1:20:50] want to judge them the bride is under a
[1:20:53] mercy anointing not a judge judgement
[1:20:54] anointing the Judgment comes later the
[1:20:57] bride is always under grace and mercy
[1:20:58] there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat
[1:21:00] there's still Blood on the Judgment seat
[1:21:01] that makes it a mercy seat amen so
[1:21:04] that's our anointing it's not to judge
[1:21:05] it's not to destroy it's not to do all
[1:21:07] these things rather it's to draw people
[1:21:08] unto
[1:21:09] him amen but Jesus says this because
[1:21:13] he's he's saying you guys you're not
[1:21:14] making sense he says either either make
[1:21:16] the tree good and his fruit good or else
[1:21:18] make the tree corrupt and his fruit
[1:21:19] corrupt for the tree is known by his
[1:21:21] fruit he says guys make up your mind you
[1:21:23] say Nicodemus come says we know you're
[1:21:25] of God cuz only a uh God man can only do
[1:21:27] this if God's with them and he says you
[1:21:29] guys I know what you're saying in the
[1:21:31] back rooms you're saying God is with
[1:21:32] them but then you come out and you say
[1:21:33] but God wasn't with them here and God
[1:21:35] wasn't with them here he says make up
[1:21:36] your minds either make me good or make
[1:21:38] me bad but I can't be good and bad
[1:21:40] simultaneously you don't get two kinds
[1:21:42] of fruit out of one
[1:21:44] tree that that's not the way it works
[1:21:46] amen he says I can't be of God and I
[1:21:48] can't be of Satan at the same time it's
[1:21:50] got to be one or the other it can't work
[1:21:51] that way he says oh Generation of Vipers
[1:21:54] how can you being evil speak good things
[1:21:57] now he's putting it back on them he's
[1:21:58] saying now you think you're so good but
[1:22:00] you're a
[1:22:01] snake so how can what comes out of your
[1:22:04] mouth actually be good if you're a snake
[1:22:05] nothing good comes out of snakes he says
[1:22:08] for out of the abundance of the heart
[1:22:11] the mouth speaketh he says you're
[1:22:14] talking like this but you're going to
[1:22:15] find in the end that what comes out of
[1:22:17] your what comes out of your mouth is
[1:22:18] what's in your heart and what was it it
[1:22:20] was condemnation it was judgment for
[1:22:22] Christ it was denial of who and what he
[1:22:24] was
[1:22:25] and that's when their true hearts showed
[1:22:28] through in that they're calling him
[1:22:29] they're saying you're not of God he's
[1:22:30] saying see that's what's in your heart
[1:22:31] is that you can't recognize it when you
[1:22:33] see it he says a good man out of the
[1:22:36] good Treasure of the heart bringeth
[1:22:39] forth good things and an evil man out of
[1:22:40] the evil treasure bringeth forth things
[1:22:42] now he's talking this in a similar way
[1:22:43] in Luke 6 and I just want to get to the
[1:22:45] end of this because he goes through all
[1:22:47] of this but I want you to see something
[1:22:49] he says for a good tree bringeth forth
[1:22:51] not forth corrupt fruit neither do a
[1:22:53] corrupt fruit bring forth good fruit
[1:22:55] what is it that makes fruit good what's
[1:22:57] on the inside of the
[1:22:59] tree that's it it's already determined
[1:23:02] before the fruit comes out whether it's
[1:23:03] going to be good or bad you can't spray
[1:23:05] a thorn with some sort of special
[1:23:07] concoction and turn it into an apple
[1:23:08] tree doesn't work that way you can't
[1:23:11] move on the outside to change what's on
[1:23:13] the inside in other words right you
[1:23:14] can't let me put it in in the words
[1:23:16] we've been using you can't put the
[1:23:18] spirit of the Lord upon a thorn and turn
[1:23:20] it into an apple tree it's still a thorn
[1:23:24] he says for every tree is known by one
[1:23:27] thing his own fruit for of thorns men do
[1:23:30] not gather figs nor of a Bramble Bush
[1:23:32] gather they grapes you never go to
[1:23:33] thorns and say where are the grapes it's
[1:23:35] a it's it's brambles it's Thorns he says
[1:23:37] a good man out of the good Treasure of
[1:23:38] his heart bringeth forth that which is
[1:23:40] good an evil man out of the evil
[1:23:42] Treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[1:23:43] that which is evil for of the abundance
[1:23:45] of the heart his mouth speaketh and then
[1:23:46] he says these words and why call ye me
[1:23:49] Lord and do not the things which I
[1:23:52] say here we get to the Crux of the
[1:23:55] matter and Jesus says you acknowledge
[1:23:56] aspects of my Ministry you see the power
[1:23:58] of God you see the signs and wonders you
[1:23:59] see the feeding of the 5,000 you see the
[1:24:01] feeding of the 4,000 you see the raising
[1:24:03] of the Dead all these things you
[1:24:04] recognize it you see all the creative
[1:24:07] works that are going on some of you have
[1:24:09] seen me walk on water all these
[1:24:12] different things he says and then you
[1:24:13] call me Lord and then you don't do what
[1:24:15] I'm telling you you recognize the works
[1:24:18] that I do but when the word comes behind
[1:24:21] you've got no place for it and you won't
[1:24:23] do what I say and that's the problem
[1:24:25] that God has even today and it's always
[1:24:27] been the problem is that people will say
[1:24:29] all sorts of wonderful things about God
[1:24:31] about Jesus about their savior about
[1:24:33] Calvary and then when it comes time to
[1:24:35] put the word into action they say no
[1:24:38] thanks not interested I have
[1:24:40] enough and that's just the way they go
[1:24:43] amen they will accept him as Savior but
[1:24:45] they won't accept him as
[1:24:46] Lord they won't do what the word says
[1:24:49] they'll live by their feelings they'll
[1:24:50] live by their Church's interpretation
[1:24:52] they'll put a filter on the word through
[1:24:53] through the the social and normal
[1:24:55] practices of today and they won't go
[1:24:57] back to the word itself and Jesus speaks
[1:24:59] of them and and he he points them back
[1:25:01] to this he says wherefore the Lord said
[1:25:03] for as much as this people draw near me
[1:25:05] with their mouth and with their lips to
[1:25:07] honor me they talk a good talk he says
[1:25:09] but they have remove their heart far
[1:25:11] from me and their fear toward me is
[1:25:13] taught by the precept of man in other
[1:25:15] words they fear God because they've been
[1:25:17] taught to
[1:25:18] fear not not godly respect they've been
[1:25:20] taught to fear and what are they trying
[1:25:22] to do they're trying to save their soul
[1:25:24] from Hellfire but there's nothing in
[1:25:26] them that actually wants to serve God
[1:25:28] all they want to do is save themselves
[1:25:30] but there's no desire to serve or obey
[1:25:32] God Amen they obey be because they feel
[1:25:35] that they have to not because they want
[1:25:37] to and it's a spirit of fear not the
[1:25:39] spirit of Liberty which is the holy
[1:25:41] spirit amen and you'll find that a
[1:25:43] spirit of fear never holds you because a
[1:25:46] spirit of fear takes you to
[1:25:47] self-preservation every single time and
[1:25:51] self-preservation remember what Jesus
[1:25:52] said if a man save his soul he'll lose
[1:25:54] it you give up your life you'll gain it
[1:25:56] you you lose it that's when you'll keep
[1:25:58] it and when we try and self-preserving
[1:26:00] in situations or circumstances in life
[1:26:02] you know what happens we take a step
[1:26:04] back because God's not in it amen we
[1:26:07] always default back to self-preservation
[1:26:09] and that's what God dealt with God dealt
[1:26:11] with this for thousands and thousands of
[1:26:13] years with Israel that they would talk a
[1:26:15] good talk they would come to church they
[1:26:16] would do the sacrifices they would show
[1:26:18] up for the high Feast they would do all
[1:26:20] of these things but then they'd go home
[1:26:21] and they'd live a completely separate
[1:26:22] life that had nothing to do with with
[1:26:24] God and they were relying on the blood
[1:26:26] to keep them in good standing and the
[1:26:29] problem is is when you do
[1:26:30] wrong that the strength of the law is
[1:26:33] Judgment right when you do wrong God has
[1:26:36] to put them into a cycle of judgment
[1:26:37] because he has to fulfill his law
[1:26:39] otherwise it's no law if there's no
[1:26:40] repercussions if there's no consequences
[1:26:43] and so God couldn't change that and so
[1:26:44] they're in this cycle of judgment Mercy
[1:26:47] judgment Mercy judgment's Mercy around
[1:26:49] and around the same old mountain time
[1:26:51] and time again in their lives never
[1:26:53] getting to move forward amen but in
[1:26:55] Ezekiel 36 as we read what's he trying
[1:26:57] to do take them out of the spirit of
[1:26:58] fear and now bring them into the spirit
[1:27:00] of Liberty and he says I'm going to do
[1:27:02] it in a way that you can't even stop
[1:27:04] it your own Hang-Ups your own problems
[1:27:07] your own issues your own intellect your
[1:27:08] own raising your family your DNA your
[1:27:11] family traits and traditions whatever it
[1:27:13] is he says none of that will stop me
[1:27:14] when I get in your heart when I put my
[1:27:16] spirit within you that's going to be the
[1:27:17] Difference
[1:27:21] Maker Luke 4 says this Jesus this is at
[1:27:24] the very start of his ministry it says
[1:27:26] Jesus returned in the power of the
[1:27:28] spirit into Galilee and there went out a
[1:27:31] Fame of him through all the region about
[1:27:32] him now notice Jesus receives the Holy
[1:27:35] Spirit at Jordan at that point he was
[1:27:37] the son of God he was all human but he
[1:27:41] was not yet the fullness because it
[1:27:43] takes God in him to make him the
[1:27:44] fullness amen so up to that point he was
[1:27:48] just as Adam or Eve were he was just as
[1:27:50] you and I were except sinless he was all
[1:27:53] flesh all human it was all there but as
[1:27:56] soon as the spirit dropped on him he
[1:28:00] became
[1:28:01] fullness because God was in him the
[1:28:04] fullness of the godhead bodily in script
[1:28:07] in a man God dwelt in flesh God robed in
[1:28:09] flesh God hidden in flesh amen and so
[1:28:13] after Jordan This is now God in human
[1:28:16] flesh that's it you're looking for God
[1:28:18] he was walking down the road down the
[1:28:19] road with a pair of sandals and and a
[1:28:21] Rob on and long hair not very attractive
[1:28:25] probably short nothing about him that
[1:28:28] would draw you to Him scripture says
[1:28:30] there's no cless to him there's no
[1:28:32] handsomeness there wasn't you know this
[1:28:33] rugged nature no no no he was a nobody
[1:28:37] and it was God in
[1:28:39] flesh the anointed one Christ
[1:28:43] amen but that's a key thing to realize
[1:28:45] because if you can see who he is you'll
[1:28:47] see who you are cuz it's the same
[1:28:49] process and it's the same spirit that
[1:28:51] has to be in you and I and if that's
[1:28:53] what it does to him then what does it do
[1:28:54] to
[1:28:56] us if that was God in flesh then what
[1:28:58] does it do when we get the Same
[1:29:00] Spirit it may not be the fullness but
[1:29:03] it's no less God in flesh amen it says
[1:29:06] and he taught in their synagogues being
[1:29:08] glorified of all and he came to Nazareth
[1:29:10] where he had been brought up and as his
[1:29:11] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[1:29:13] the Sabbath day and stood up for to read
[1:29:16] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:29:17] book of the prophet Isaiah and when he
[1:29:19] had opened the book he found the place
[1:29:20] where it was written the spirit of the
[1:29:22] Lord is upon me because he had anointed
[1:29:25] me to preach the gospel to the poor so
[1:29:27] he has an indwelling but there is an
[1:29:29] anointing on him to do if I could put it
[1:29:32] that way he's got it on the inside but
[1:29:34] there is now a something that is driving
[1:29:37] him to do
[1:29:38] something God doesn't give us his spirit
[1:29:41] so we can sit on couches he gives it to
[1:29:44] do it's supposed to put us into action
[1:29:47] when we're finally changed he's wanting
[1:29:49] to put us into action he's wanting to
[1:29:51] put us into the work for the kingdom he
[1:29:53] says the the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:29:55] me because he had anointed me to preach
[1:29:57] the gospel to the
[1:29:58] poor oh preaching wonderful no no no and
[1:30:02] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:30:05] that's to deal with emotions that's to
[1:30:06] deal with pain and suffering that's to
[1:30:08] deal with with hurts that you've
[1:30:10] experienced in your life he says to
[1:30:13] preach Deliverance to the captives there
[1:30:15] are all sorts of things that bind us
[1:30:19] they can be mental they can be
[1:30:21] intellectual they can be Financial they
[1:30:24] can be religious they can be the the the
[1:30:27] health of our body they can be
[1:30:30] relational he says I'm here to free you
[1:30:32] from every single thing that holds you
[1:30:35] everything he says and recovering of
[1:30:38] sight to the Blind and to set at Liberty
[1:30:41] them that are bruised I look at that
[1:30:42] that them that are bruised that's people
[1:30:43] that have had a rough
[1:30:45] life he says I'm here to set you
[1:30:48] free what a beautiful thing I'm here to
[1:30:51] set you free from the effects of
[1:30:53] everything that's bound you to this
[1:30:55] point it says and he closed the book and
[1:30:57] he gave it again to the minister and I
[1:31:00] love he sat down that does me so
[1:31:04] good that he could sit down under the
[1:31:06] greatest anointing there ever was and
[1:31:08] preach a service like that and the eyes
[1:31:11] of all them that were in the synagogue
[1:31:12] were fastened on him and he began to say
[1:31:14] unto them this sorry let me go back I
[1:31:18] miss something I missed something I ver
[1:31:20] Miss verse 19 he says to set at Liberty
[1:31:23] them that are bruised and then he says
[1:31:24] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:31:27] Lord now you got to remember Isaiah had
[1:31:29] said this 7 written this 700 years ago
[1:31:32] the anointing the Holy Spirit comes upon
[1:31:34] Isaiah and 700 years ago he writes down
[1:31:37] the acceptable year of the Lord what's
[1:31:38] the acceptable year of the lord it's the
[1:31:41] time that God determines for this to
[1:31:44] happen so everything that's written in
[1:31:46] this word there's a time appointed
[1:31:48] there's an acceptable year there's a
[1:31:50] time when it has to happen and so he
[1:31:52] says I'm here to preach
[1:31:54] when that time is oh this is wonderful
[1:31:57] when is it going to be Jesus and then he
[1:31:59] sits down and at the end he says this
[1:32:01] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[1:32:04] ears in other words he says today is the
[1:32:06] acceptable day this is the acceptable
[1:32:08] year this is the acceptable time if you
[1:32:10] need healing this is the time if you
[1:32:12] need Deliverance this is the time if you
[1:32:13] need chains broken this is the time if
[1:32:15] you need to see here it is it's all
[1:32:19] available now now is the day for this to
[1:32:22] be fulfilled and he sitting down in a
[1:32:25] robe and
[1:32:28] sandals what an
[1:32:30] anointing and they try and kill him
[1:32:33] after this church you make too much of
[1:32:35] yourself Church we're going to have to
[1:32:37] do something that gets us to see we're
[1:32:39] more than what people think we are not
[1:32:41] out of Pride not out of Pride but
[1:32:44] because we're anointed in our souls to
[1:32:47] be and do something for the kingdom of
[1:32:49] God Amen
[1:32:52] Hallelujah all all we have to do find
[1:32:56] our place and stick with it that's it
[1:32:59] find your place in the word and stick
[1:33:01] with it and don't move and while that
[1:33:04] happens then is that anointing is there
[1:33:05] to say now is the acceptable
[1:33:08] time and you just stay there until it
[1:33:10] happens that's all you have to do amen
[1:33:13] Jesus says we're in the season of
[1:33:14] setting people free and they tried to
[1:33:17] kill
[1:33:18] them he could have completely set them
[1:33:20] Free Church and instead they said that's
[1:33:22] too much for us to take we know who you
[1:33:24] are we know who your family is we know
[1:33:26] where you come from we know the stories
[1:33:27] that surround you yeah no that's too
[1:33:30] much they went to kill him and what
[1:33:32] happened is he walked right through them
[1:33:33] because it wasn't his time to die
[1:33:36] amen he's talking about all these things
[1:33:40] and he says whatever binds you
[1:33:42] whatever's held you back I'm here to set
[1:33:45] you free from it man not just natural
[1:33:47] blindness but spiritual blindness anden
[1:33:50] the Liberty he wasn't offering was it
[1:33:52] wasn't just signs and wonders
[1:33:55] it wasn't just the big axe but it was
[1:33:57] when he would go to marry ma to to to
[1:34:00] Mary she had seven
[1:34:02] demons he set her free from things that
[1:34:04] had bound her that way yes he goes and
[1:34:07] he heals the blind and he raises the
[1:34:09] dead but you notice church that for 99%
[1:34:12] of those people it never changed their
[1:34:15] life yeah it changed how easily they
[1:34:18] walked through it but it never converted
[1:34:20] them thousands upon thousands were there
[1:34:23] for the breaking of the fish and the
[1:34:25] Loaves and the multiplication of it and
[1:34:28] we don't see him on the day of Pentecost
[1:34:30] do we 10 lepers are healed miraculously
[1:34:34] one comes
[1:34:35] back he goes over to the
[1:34:38] gines and heals a
[1:34:41] demoniac and they say can you please
[1:34:43] leave you're causing too many
[1:34:45] issues you caused this financial room
[1:34:48] but a man got
[1:34:49] saved and he went and he spread the
[1:34:51] gospel all throughout his area the signs
[1:34:54] and wonders never convert people they
[1:34:57] never save people they never hold People
[1:34:59] Israel had the supernatural every day in
[1:35:01] the wilderness for 40 years and two came
[1:35:03] out of that original group it doesn't
[1:35:06] save us amen they are there for the
[1:35:08] benefits but they could not receive his
[1:35:11] word we know that in all of it God has
[1:35:13] an elect group but it's always a little
[1:35:15] group it's always a tiny group even in
[1:35:18] his own disciples we preached on this
[1:35:20] last service or two he had the 82 he had
[1:35:23] the 12 that he chose and then he had the
[1:35:25] 70 that came to him and yes they healed
[1:35:27] the sick and raised the dead and cast
[1:35:29] out demons and preached effectively and
[1:35:30] all these things but when it came to The
[1:35:33] Showdown what did they turn down see
[1:35:35] they love Christ the Healer Christ the
[1:35:37] provider Christ the
[1:35:40] powerful but when Christ the word came
[1:35:42] their way what happened not interested
[1:35:45] and what they didn't realize is that the
[1:35:47] power was in Christ the word they turned
[1:35:49] down the very thing and what happened
[1:35:51] Church they lost their Ministries they
[1:35:54] had to go back to what they had left
[1:35:56] because that's all that was left for
[1:35:57] them they're a Jew if you didn't accept
[1:35:59] Christ then you had to go back to what
[1:36:01] Judaism they went back to dead
[1:36:03] sacrifices they went back to a temple
[1:36:05] where the shik of Glory
[1:36:06] left nothing they had nothing and they
[1:36:09] lost it all because not because they
[1:36:11] turned down the signs and wonders
[1:36:12] because they turned down Christ the
[1:36:14] word God's grace that we realize the
[1:36:18] word's what matters more than anything
[1:36:21] amen but Jesus comes down at the very
[1:36:23] end of his ministry and he's preached
[1:36:24] these hard services and and then he
[1:36:26] comes up to the last supper and it's
[1:36:28] like we're at today he's at the
[1:36:30] communion and the foot washing and he's
[1:36:31] sharing about what's going to happen to
[1:36:33] him and he says I'm going to have to go
[1:36:35] away and they're going to kill me and
[1:36:37] and by the way Peter you're going to
[1:36:39] fall and oh everybody else you're going
[1:36:41] to leave me
[1:36:42] too and and and they're kind of in a
[1:36:44] depression we're going to lose him we're
[1:36:46] not going to do so well and then he
[1:36:49] comes to John 14 John 13 he's giving
[1:36:51] them all the bad news but we come out to
[1:36:53] John 14 and and this is where we sort of
[1:36:55] started this this morning and Jesus says
[1:36:59] let not your heart be
[1:37:01] troubled Peter saying Jesus you told me
[1:37:04] I'm going to
[1:37:05] fail he says don't worry about
[1:37:08] it Jesus we're going to go through hard
[1:37:11] times you're going to die you're going
[1:37:12] to be crucified they're going to beat
[1:37:14] you to a pulp and Jesus says don't be
[1:37:16] worried about
[1:37:18] it Church we're in rough times we're at
[1:37:21] the worst of times we're at a time time
[1:37:23] where Satan is in the synagogue of God
[1:37:26] being worshiped as
[1:37:27] God there is no light in the natural
[1:37:30] Church Christ is outside the church
[1:37:33] knocking on the door we're at the worst
[1:37:35] of times in the previous six ages he
[1:37:37] could still deal with them in the
[1:37:39] seventh age he is completely out we're
[1:37:41] in the worst it will ever get and the
[1:37:44] only thing coming after this is Judgment
[1:37:45] because this is the worst it can
[1:37:47] get and what's he saying Shalom fear not
[1:37:53] have peace there's difficult times
[1:37:55] coming but I've made a way
[1:37:57] through he says ye believe in God
[1:37:59] believe also in me he says in my
[1:38:03] father's house are many mansions if it
[1:38:05] were not so I would have told you I go
[1:38:07] to prepare a place for you and if I go
[1:38:10] and prepare a place for you I will come
[1:38:12] again and receive you unto myself he's
[1:38:14] not going to do all that work and then
[1:38:15] not have somebody there to take it he
[1:38:18] says that where I am there ye may be
[1:38:21] also he's saying the whole purpose of
[1:38:23] this is Redemption is to restore you
[1:38:26] back to where you were and this is him
[1:38:28] speaking now of the second coming of
[1:38:30] Christ of for his bride it's the
[1:38:31] resurrection it's the Rapture of the
[1:38:33] elect of God he says now whether I go
[1:38:36] where I go you know and the way you know
[1:38:38] he says you know where I'm going and you
[1:38:39] know how to get there and all the Deep
[1:38:43] spiritual men at the table said amen
[1:38:46] Jesus except for Thomas Thomas said Lord
[1:38:49] we know where you're we don't know where
[1:38:51] you're going and we don't know the way
[1:38:54] I like Thomas for his honesty he was
[1:38:56] honest about his doubt and he was honest
[1:38:58] about what he didn't know he says Jesus
[1:39:01] what are you talking about we don't have
[1:39:02] a clue where you're going and we
[1:39:04] definitely don't have a clue how to get
[1:39:07] there and Jesus said unto him I personal
[1:39:11] pronoun I am the way the truth and the
[1:39:16] life no man cometh unto the father but
[1:39:19] by me so there's the way
[1:39:23] he does not say the father is the way he
[1:39:27] does not say the holy spirit is the life
[1:39:30] he says I
[1:39:31] am it's all in Christ Church it's all in
[1:39:35] Christ there is no third person of the
[1:39:36] Trinity there is no first person of the
[1:39:38] Trinity he says it's all through me
[1:39:41] everything that's happening it's through
[1:39:42] me the whole walk the path the doorway
[1:39:45] it's all Christ it's Christ from start
[1:39:46] to finish he says if you had known me
[1:39:50] you should have known my father also you
[1:39:53] words he says if you truly know who I am
[1:39:55] you'll know who the father is he says
[1:39:57] and from henceforth you know him and
[1:39:59] have seen him he says from now on I'm
[1:40:00] showing you who he is and you'll know it
[1:40:02] and you'll continue to know it he says
[1:40:05] if you really realize who I am then
[1:40:06] you'd realize it but now I'm about to
[1:40:07] show you who it is and now Philip has
[1:40:10] maybe caught some courage from Thomas
[1:40:11] and he says Lord show us the father and
[1:40:14] it suffice sufficeth th in other words
[1:40:16] he's saying if you just show us the
[1:40:19] father that'll be enough for us that's
[1:40:21] all we need to see you don't have to
[1:40:22] show us who you are just show us the
[1:40:23] father father and not watch now what
[1:40:25] Jesus says he says and Jesus saith unto
[1:40:28] him have I personal pronoun been so long
[1:40:32] time with you and yet thou Hast not
[1:40:34] known me Phillip he says he that has
[1:40:37] seen me has seen the father and how
[1:40:40] sayest thou then show me the father he
[1:40:42] says Philip if you've seen me you've
[1:40:44] seen God the father so why are you
[1:40:46] saying show us the father now we're not
[1:40:48] preaching on godhead this morning but
[1:40:50] you really cannot touch on it a little
[1:40:52] bit and Jesus says when you see me
[1:40:54] you're seeing the father and you can
[1:40:55] take that back to Colossians 1:15 where
[1:40:57] it says that he is the image of the
[1:41:00] invisible God but then we can go back to
[1:41:03] Isaiah let's take the wings of Old
[1:41:05] Testament and New Testament where it
[1:41:07] says that Jesus is the Mighty God and
[1:41:11] the
[1:41:12] Everlasting father you've got a son
[1:41:15] who's the father now how do you explain
[1:41:17] that through the Trinity you can't do it
[1:41:19] that's a real tough scripture but Christ
[1:41:22] is God made flesh it's God made visible
[1:41:24] it's God in a body it's God indwelling
[1:41:26] human flesh that's who he
[1:41:29] is he says believest not thou that I'm
[1:41:32] the father that I am in the father and
[1:41:34] the father in
[1:41:36] me he says the words that I speak unto
[1:41:38] you I don't speak them of myself but the
[1:41:40] father that dwells in me he doeth the
[1:41:42] works that's a really tough one for a
[1:41:44] trinitarian when you say let's do it
[1:41:47] like a glove okay Christ is the glove or
[1:41:49] Christ is the the hand and God is the
[1:41:51] glove he says I'm in the father
[1:41:55] and then he says but now the father's in
[1:41:57] me well how do you put a glove inside a
[1:41:59] hand you can only have one inside the
[1:42:02] other if they're two separate
[1:42:04] things that's the only way it works but
[1:42:06] now he says I'm in the father and the
[1:42:08] father's in me so now you have a hand
[1:42:09] and a glove and a
[1:42:11] hand how does that work doesn't work
[1:42:13] physically it doesn't work logically it
[1:42:15] doesn't work amen you've got these two
[1:42:18] separations of things and it doesn't
[1:42:19] work and Jesus is saying listen it's not
[1:42:21] me thinking and it's not me speaking
[1:42:23] it's the father that's in me amen and we
[1:42:25] see now that Christ is the perfect
[1:42:27] expression of the indwelling God he is
[1:42:30] the exact picture that we need to
[1:42:32] understand godhead it's right there in
[1:42:33] front of them amen and that's where the
[1:42:35] inspiration for this service comes this
[1:42:37] morning it's God indwelling human flesh
[1:42:39] he says believe me that I'm in the
[1:42:41] father and the father in me or else
[1:42:43] believe me for the very work's sake he's
[1:42:44] saying if you can't wrap your head
[1:42:46] around how this works then just believe
[1:42:47] my
[1:42:48] works because I can't be doing those
[1:42:50] works and be lying to you about who and
[1:42:51] what I am so just take it really what
[1:42:55] he's saying is if you can't grasp it lay
[1:42:56] it on the shelf and just keep believing
[1:42:59] and in due time you'll
[1:43:01] understand but he doesn't stop there oh
[1:43:04] I love
[1:43:05] this he says believe me and if you
[1:43:08] believe me what happens is verse 12 he
[1:43:10] says verily verily I say unto you in
[1:43:11] other words he's saying I'm not lying
[1:43:13] this is really true he that believeth on
[1:43:15] me the works that I do shall he do also
[1:43:20] whoa wow what Jesus did you're going to
[1:43:24] do
[1:43:25] Phillip he says not only that and
[1:43:28] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:43:30] because I go to my father now that word
[1:43:31] greater doesn't mean you're going to do
[1:43:33] more than he did in terms of the the
[1:43:35] might or the Majesty or the power it
[1:43:37] means you're going to do more by number
[1:43:39] why because there's 12 of them well
[1:43:41] really 11 and there's one of him and
[1:43:43] they're going to go in all the world
[1:43:44] they're not going to be limited by three
[1:43:46] and a half years of ministry some of
[1:43:48] them are going to live for decades some
[1:43:49] of them aren't but he says you're going
[1:43:50] to do more because there's a bunch of
[1:43:52] you now with the same thing inside of me
[1:43:55] see we talk about people that say well I
[1:43:57] believe on Jesus here's the scripture we
[1:43:59] ought to point them back to if you
[1:44:00] believe on him then you'll do the works
[1:44:02] that he does you'll live the life that
[1:44:03] he lives you'll have the words that he
[1:44:05] has and you'll have the inspiration for
[1:44:07] what you do and speak the same that he
[1:44:09] did that's those that believe on him is
[1:44:11] that they have the Life of Christ that's
[1:44:13] the proof amen so let's take the whole
[1:44:16] scripture rather than the cherry-picking
[1:44:17] one that says if you believe on him
[1:44:18] you'll be saved if you believe on him
[1:44:20] it'll have an effect he says and what
[1:44:23] whatever you shall ask in my name that
[1:44:24] will I do that the father may be
[1:44:26] glorified in the
[1:44:28] son what about that
[1:44:31] one you believe on Jesus Christ then
[1:44:33] when you speak nothing happens when you
[1:44:35] pray nothing happens there's a problem
[1:44:38] why because you don't have the mind of
[1:44:39] Christ yet you don't have the holy
[1:44:41] spirit
[1:44:42] inside why because if we believe on
[1:44:44] Christ then we believe the word that he
[1:44:46] is and brings then we speak by his will
[1:44:48] by the word and God backs it
[1:44:50] up and he says and if you shall ask ask
[1:44:53] anything in my name I will do it
[1:44:55] Hallelujah now John would come later in
[1:44:58] 1 John 5:14 and say if we ask anything
[1:45:01] according to his will oh see we got to
[1:45:04] take the whole scripture again otherwise
[1:45:06] we' run around and I'd be speaking brand
[1:45:08] new cars and no problems with Newland
[1:45:11] power and and filling the pews with Holy
[1:45:13] Ghost filled
[1:45:15] people right I'd be speaking Roma into
[1:45:18] Newan
[1:45:20] land I'd be speaking my my sister back
[1:45:23] into the
[1:45:24] message but that's not the way it works
[1:45:27] we've got to have the mind of Christ and
[1:45:29] speak according to that not according to
[1:45:31] my will and that's what Jesus said I
[1:45:33] don't do this by my will I do it by his
[1:45:35] will amen but he says if you ask it in
[1:45:38] his name how do you ask it in his name
[1:45:39] Church you ask it because he's in you
[1:45:42] you have his name by
[1:45:44] marriage my wife can ask anything in my
[1:45:47] name and get it as long as the bank
[1:45:48] account's there for
[1:45:49] it she's got a right to it she's missing
[1:45:53] Jonathan klette she can't go into the
[1:45:55] bank and they say I'm sorry Blanca neis
[1:45:58] no they say h Mrs Jonathan klet you have
[1:46:01] full access you can take it can't stop
[1:46:05] her that's the same thing for us we're
[1:46:08] United by marriage really we're in the
[1:46:10] same Unity that Christ has that's really
[1:46:12] what we're getting to this morning and
[1:46:15] then he says now if you love me keep my
[1:46:19] Commandments oh I love Jesus what are
[1:46:21] you doing how you living
[1:46:24] remember what Jesus said he talks about
[1:46:25] the parable of the two sons and the
[1:46:26] father says hey go work in the fields
[1:46:28] one guy says no I'm not going to do it
[1:46:30] but then he went and does
[1:46:32] it and then the other one says sure Dad
[1:46:34] I'll do it and then he doesn't go do the
[1:46:36] work and Jesus said which one really
[1:46:38] love the Father the one that initially
[1:46:40] said no and then did it or the one that
[1:46:42] said I'll do it and then didn't do it
[1:46:44] and they all said the one that did it
[1:46:46] yeah but he was disrespectful he was
[1:46:47] rude doesn't matter he did it he loved
[1:46:49] his father he respected his father and
[1:46:51] he ended up doing what he was supposed
[1:46:52] to to do same thing with us we can't say
[1:46:54] we love God and then disobey his word he
[1:46:57] says I will pray the father and he shall
[1:46:59] give you another comforter that he may
[1:47:01] abide with you forever now listen Jesus
[1:47:03] is their comforter right there he's the
[1:47:05] one saying let not your heart be
[1:47:06] troubled he's their current comforter
[1:47:09] he's trying to set their hearts at ease
[1:47:11] he's trying to show them and he's saying
[1:47:12] don't be troubled I know hard times are
[1:47:14] coming and all these things now he says
[1:47:15] now he's going to send you another
[1:47:16] comforter oh now we've got a second
[1:47:18] person of the godhead here there's
[1:47:20] somebody else coming besides me
[1:47:23] who is it he says it's the spirit of
[1:47:28] Truth a comforter and the spirit of
[1:47:32] Truth you know what there's a real
[1:47:34] freedom in truth scripture says the
[1:47:36] truth will set you
[1:47:38] free because it cuts through the fog it

[1:47:42] the the Wonder and the worry and it lets
[1:47:44] you st oh it lets you walk on a sure
[1:47:48] Foundation it lets you see that your

[1:47:56] your soul it'll set your mind at ease
[1:47:59] it'll give you freedom and peace in a
[1:48:01] time when all around you is falling
[1:48:02] apart because you know that the truth
[1:48:05] cannot fail amen he says the comforter
[1:48:09] you'll know him because he brings you
[1:48:12] truth see we want the the fuzzy the the
[1:48:15] hugs the warmth he says the truth is
[1:48:18] what will make you feel good it'll set
[1:48:21] you free he says whom the world cannot
[1:48:24] receive because it seeth him not neither
[1:48:26] knoweth him catch that Jesus is saying
[1:48:28] the comforter is here right now the
[1:48:31] spirit of Truth is here right now but
[1:48:32] the world can't have him the world can't
[1:48:34] receive him because they can't even see
[1:48:36] him they can't recognize him they don't
[1:48:37] know who he is so in other words the one
[1:48:40] that's coming is already there in their
[1:48:42] midst right there
[1:48:44] amen and he confirms it he says but ye
[1:48:47] know him for he dwelleth with you
[1:48:52] in other words he's right here in the
[1:48:54] room now is what he's saying he says you
[1:48:56] see him you know him and he's with you
[1:48:58] who is it it's Christ himself amen but
[1:49:01] now he says and he shall be where in you
[1:49:06] not upon you that's already happened he
[1:49:10] says now he's going to be in
[1:49:14] you they've all had this ministry
[1:49:17] they've had this comforter they've had
[1:49:18] this Spirit of Truth all the time and
[1:49:19] who is it it's Jesus Christ
[1:49:22] and then he says he he he leaves no
[1:49:25] doubt church he does not say he will
[1:49:28] come to you he says I will come to you
[1:49:32] who's the spirit of Truth Jesus Christ
[1:49:34] who's the comforter Jesus Christ he says
[1:49:37] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:49:40] come to you personal pronoun not a third
[1:49:43] person of the Trinity it is Jesus Christ
[1:49:46] himself amen there's a spirit of Truth
[1:49:49] coming there's a comforter coming it's
[1:49:51] the same thing it's the same person
[1:49:53] Jesus says it's not something different
[1:49:55] why he says you're going to recognize it
[1:49:57] when it comes because you'll see it's
[1:49:58] just like me it's not just like me it is
[1:50:00] me that's how you'll recognize it now
[1:50:03] some people would look at that scripture
[1:50:05] and say well yeah he's pointing to the
[1:50:06] long future where he comes back in a
[1:50:09] second coming and there's a resurrection
[1:50:11] and a Rapture but Jesus doesn't put it
[1:50:13] that way he puts in verse 19 he says yet
[1:50:14] a little while and another words shortly
[1:50:17] cuz why within 24 hours he's
[1:50:19] dead yes he's going to rise again but
[1:50:22] after that they've only got the 40 days
[1:50:23] or 37 days and then he's gone
[1:50:27] again he says let a yet a little while
[1:50:29] and the world sees me no more but ye see
[1:50:32] me now he says because I live ye shall
[1:50:36] live
[1:50:38] also in other words How I Live is how
[1:50:40] you're going to live the reason I can
[1:50:42] live is the reason you're going to live
[1:50:43] the way I can do this is the way you're
[1:50:45] going to do that there's no difference
[1:50:47] listen to this quote we're almost done
[1:50:50] I'm going a little longer than I
[1:50:51] expected this morning but that's it's
[1:50:52] okay it says and then God became
[1:50:55] material in a man called Jesus Christ
[1:50:57] which was his son became
[1:51:01] material now watch
[1:51:04] Hallelujah this son gave his life that
[1:51:07] he might bring what other sons that God
[1:51:13] might
[1:51:15] become
[1:51:16] tangible working all in
[1:51:21] all when you you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:51:24] Church it is God being tangible to this
[1:51:28] Fallen
[1:51:30] word
[1:51:35] listen God's
[1:51:37] tangible Hallelujah God's tangible God's
[1:51:42] tangible sister brother Dale God's
[1:51:44] tangible this
[1:51:46] morning it is not some foreign entity
[1:51:50] something that's so spiritual and high
[1:51:52] above us that we cannot reach it but God
[1:51:54] comes down and he comes to a little girl
[1:51:59] he comes to a little girl and people can
[1:52:02] shake her hand and they're shaking the
[1:52:04] hand of Jesus Christ no difference no
[1:52:07] difference except it's a portion instead
[1:52:09] of the fullness but then when we get us
[1:52:12] all in a group here what happens it's
[1:52:14] more of the fullness it's a greater part
[1:52:17] of the fullness coming together and
[1:52:19] people can come into our presence and
[1:52:23] it's not me it's Christ that's living in
[1:52:25] me and they can lay hold of eternal life
[1:52:29] by the life that we live in the witness
[1:52:31] that we give through our day-to-day
[1:52:32] words and actions that's where we're at
[1:52:34] this morning the tangible God
[1:52:37] now not in
[1:52:40] three in hundreds in thousands maybe in
[1:52:45] millions only he knows the tangible God
[1:52:48] we're speaking on the indwelling god
[1:52:50] this morning don't look out there church
[1:52:52] Church look in the mirror look in the
[1:52:55] mirror of the word and then say God let
[1:52:57] me see it in the mirror of my bathroom
[1:52:59] in the mirror of the door when I check
[1:53:01] myself to go out into public Lord let
[1:53:03] them see the Christ in me that that's
[1:53:05] the hope of glory amen and he says this
[1:53:09] because he said it yet a little
[1:53:11] while what is it he's pointing to a
[1:53:13] little while in the future he says and
[1:53:15] at that day you shall know that I am in
[1:53:20] the father and ye in me
[1:53:23] oh he's adding and I in
[1:53:27] you what is it on the day of Pentecost
[1:53:30] he says there's going to be a little
[1:53:32] time and then in a single day in a
[1:53:34] single moment you're going to have a
[1:53:35] realization of what I was talking about
[1:53:37] here what is it their theology will
[1:53:39] become reality that's really what it is
[1:53:41] you'll have the experience of what the
[1:53:43] godhead is you'll have an experience of
[1:53:45] what it means to be
[1:53:49] one for whatever reason in the last
[1:53:51] couple weeks I've had a lot of
[1:53:53] discussions with people and on the
[1:53:55] Trinity and these different things and
[1:53:56] people sending over things and whatnot
[1:53:59] and I want to stop here because there's
[1:54:00] a there's so much more to unpack here
[1:54:02] but Jesus is throwing a wrench in the
[1:54:06] godhead because we look at this and he's
[1:54:09] saying he's not just putting three in
[1:54:11] the godhead now if you see this if we're
[1:54:13] going to read it the way it says it he's
[1:54:14] not just putting three cuz he starts out
[1:54:16] and he says I and my father are one so
[1:54:18] there's a Oneness so a a a equals B okay
[1:54:22] then he says now myself and the Holy
[1:54:23] Spirit the comforter are one so now a
[1:54:26] equals b and b equals c okay we remember
[1:54:29] our math so then he's got two Oneness
[1:54:32] there so at most you got two people
[1:54:34] right but if a equals b and b equals c
[1:54:36] then a equals c so now you've got the
[1:54:38] three of them are the same so now you
[1:54:40] have a Oneness amen of Christ in the
[1:54:44] father Christ in the spirit and them in
[1:54:45] him and then he comes and he gives us
[1:54:47] John 14:20 and he says by the way you're
[1:54:49] in this as well so it's no longer a
[1:54:52] trinity
[1:54:53] if it's just brother Mark we've got a
[1:54:55] quaternity if nothing else but here's
[1:54:57] the thing on the day of Pentecost they
[1:54:59] added 120 to this so you've got three
[1:55:03] plus 120 and then 3,000 are added that
[1:55:06] day and then he goes to the house of
[1:55:08] Cornelius and then he goes to Samaria
[1:55:10] and every single one of them get the
[1:55:12] exact same revelation of Christ in their
[1:55:15] life so if you do all the math you got
[1:55:17] 3,500 people now added into the Oneness
[1:55:20] of the godhead
[1:55:23] I'm not preaching heresy I'm saying if
[1:55:25] you believe that it's three individuals
[1:55:26] now you've got more than
[1:55:29] 3,000 you doesn't work that way you've
[1:55:31] got to understand Oneness a different
[1:55:33] way and the thing is you got to be able
[1:55:35] to see what it is for real because if
[1:55:37] you can't see that you won't see you you
[1:55:40] can't do it cuz the new birth reveals
[1:55:42] the exact same thing that Christ was in
[1:55:44] your personal life that's where we're
[1:55:46] sitting this morning two quotes and
[1:55:47] we'll close I promise
[1:55:52] see when he came descending from Heaven
[1:55:54] not another three people way up yonder
[1:55:56] talking but they saw the spirit of God
[1:55:58] like a dove that's who the spirit was
[1:56:00] not the third person talking it's not
[1:56:02] three Gods he says there's three offices
[1:56:04] of the same God God the father and the
[1:56:06] pillar of fire god the son in human
[1:56:08] flesh he says God the Holy Ghost in you
[1:56:12] the same god wow he said Jesus said that
[1:56:17] day you'll know that I'm in the Father
[1:56:18] the father in me and I in you and you
[1:56:20] and me God trying to get back of
[1:56:22] fellowship with his create with his
[1:56:24] creature that he created in the Garden
[1:56:27] of Eden that's how he's going to do it
[1:56:30] not by might not by power but by my
[1:56:34] spirit it's how God does it he says I'm
[1:56:37] talking about the identification of the
[1:56:39] token Jesus Christ raised and where in
[1:56:43] us now identifying who himself to
[1:56:49] revindicate his promised word of this
[1:56:51] day amen he says then you and Christ are
[1:56:54] one God and Christ are one that day
[1:56:56] you'll know that I'm in the Father the
[1:56:58] father in me I in you and you and me he
[1:57:01] says there is God made manifest in human
[1:57:04] flesh showing himself alive after
[1:57:08] 2,000 years he says that's the token
[1:57:13] amen God bless you let's Stand Together
[1:57:15] the musicians could come the deacons
[1:57:16] will start to prepare for the communion
[1:57:18] and the foot
[1:57:20] washing my I love church I love this
[1:57:23] when you can see it's not just something
[1:57:25] outside of you it's something in you
[1:57:28] amen that you're a part of it you're not
[1:57:29] external to it you always were a part of
[1:57:31] it like Jesus said I come from God I go
[1:57:33] to God we come from God and we go back
[1:57:35] to God and we have that same origin we
[1:57:38] have that same source and we're going
[1:57:39] back and we're being restored to that
[1:57:41] amen what is it it's just God revealing
[1:57:44] it's just God revealing himself over and
[1:57:47] over and over again God revealed himself
[1:57:49] through Moses god revealed himself
[1:57:52] through through Samuel through David he
[1:57:53] even revealed himself through Samson he
[1:57:55] revealed himself through prophets he
[1:57:57] revealed himself through Mary John the
[1:57:59] Baptist he Paul the apostles all these
[1:58:01] different ones it was Christ it was God
[1:58:03] revealing himself through anointed Sons
[1:58:06] and Daughters of God Christ was just the
[1:58:08] first of many Brethren he says and
[1:58:10] there's a bunch more coming behind it
[1:58:12] that are going to produce the same life
[1:58:14] amen you know I was thinking on this
[1:58:15] that God is the only thing the only one
[1:58:18] that can divide himself and not be
[1:58:21] diminished
[1:58:22] when God divided himself remember what
[1:58:25] we know it says God pour all that God
[1:58:27] was he poured himself into Christ and
[1:58:28] then what all that Christ was he poured
[1:58:30] himself into the church but his power is
[1:58:32] not diminished God does not become less
[1:58:34] of a God because brother Paul has a
[1:58:36] portion of him or brother Bob has a
[1:58:37] portion of him or sister Justine has a
[1:58:39] portion of him he's still God he stands
[1:58:41] outside of space he's outside of time
[1:58:43] he's outside of matter he is not bound
[1:58:46] by the laws that we look at he's God
[1:58:48] he's everywhere he's everything and so
[1:58:50] when he gives himself to somebody he is
[1:58:52] in no way diminished and yet he's
[1:58:54] missing a part of himself it's a paradox
[1:58:57] that he he's missing something and yet
[1:58:59] he hasn't lost anything and that's what
[1:59:01] we're going through is in these things
[1:59:03] amen it's the Simplicity of God being
[1:59:05] revealed in you and I in humility it's
[1:59:08] an indwelling God in flesh All Over
[1:59:11] Again by the Holy Spirit that's where
[1:59:13] we're sitting that's where we're sitting
[1:59:15] this morning and this is a spirit that's
[1:59:17] going to take us into character it's
[1:59:19] going to take us all the way into a
[1:59:20] resurrection and a rapture
[1:59:22] you've got eternal life dwelling in you
[1:59:24] the very life of God inside of you this
[1:59:27] morning if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:59:28] what a wonderful place we are and it's
[1:59:30] all because of what he did that day at
[1:59:32] Calvary and so when we come here this SE
[1:59:35] this morning to to eat the
[1:59:37] bread a and to drink the wine what are
[1:59:39] we saying we're saying thank you we
[1:59:42] recognize the price that he paid the
[1:59:46] horrible disfiguration the pain The
[1:59:48] Suffering The Agony that he went through
[1:59:50] so that you and I could stand in and sit
[1:59:52] here this morning and say I'm a child of
[1:59:54] God and he has confirmed it in my life
[1:59:57] by the indwelling presence of his own
[1:59:59] spirit amen hallelujah amen God bless
[2:00:02] you this morning let's bow our heads

[2:00:18] Nails driven into your arms and your
[2:00:21] feet Lord and your side was pierced and
[2:00:23] you you stayed on a cross Lord naked of
[2:00:26] your own free will and died and gave
