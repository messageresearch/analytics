front of the computer and we're talking at a distance and what more but yet so thankful to the Lord to have the opportunity to be in these meetings and as I was quoting yesterday just mentioning that when the Lord Jesus said we're two and three are gathered that he would be in the midst he never said where that gathering was he just told us that if we were gathered together so whether it's in a catacomb whether it's in a cave or whether we're gathered together virtually like this we are indeed gathered in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so thank you again to brother Gerald and the church body for receiving us in here tonight and thank you for taking time out of your Saturday to come in and worship the Lord together and to come and be in service for the service of the Lord so

Word of God for just a little while amen I I know this might be a little strange y'all looking at me up here and be looking at y'all out there but what I love is the Word of God is the same everywhere you go brother I made the statement like this he said the Word of God will defeat the devil any place any time under any circumstances and under these circumstances we can sir say amen to that and and I believe that with all of my heart now I want to say quickly before we turn in the Bible how much I enjoyed all that singing and Priscilla and a virgin and all y'all just gonna really enjoy the songs and enjoy listening I I turned my camera off and my mic off kindly almost to put myself in the back room in a way of looking at things but I've sure enjoyed the service thus far looking forward to what the Lord will speak to us here tonight hey man let's turn in the Bible if you got your Bible now let's go to Galatians chapter 4 and I want to pick up verse 1 through 6 now was everybody listening online last night everybody get to hear the message last night all right wonderful well then we're gonna pick up a little bit on what we talked about last night and I want to use tonight for a subject and this is really kindly a part 2 or a follow-up to what I was bringing last night but I want to talk about sons of God with full power tonight and I want to talk about how all of this comes together now for a title I want to try to use if we can what is the Sun what is a Sun what is these Sun and we know that there is a V son who has brought forth many sons of God and we want to talk about that for a little while and bring together a little bit of understanding about what a son of God is now as I mentioned to you last night we're going to pick up in the book of Galatians so let's look now in Galatians chapter 4 verse 1 now let's read down through verse 6 if we can't just catch them 6 verses and then pray and ask the Lord to help us and then get right into the message quickly as we can hear now I say that at the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father now once you really notice that until the time appointed of the Father even so we now watch now when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come now you remember that last night in Ephesians chapter 1 that he said in the fullness of time God said forth a son all right not just a son but the son of course and then God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and now here's the main thing we were driving that last night I want to pick it up again tonight and because she our sons all right God has made you sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father in that wonderful let's let's pray over the word for just a moment if we can Heavenly Father we thank you now for the reading of the Bible we thank you for the saints of God in attendance Lord may you bless each one of them now that have come and gathered here over the Internet they've gathered at the church house different ones swapping out taking turns no doubt giving each one an opportunity to be in the house of the Lord gather there in the place where brother brems said angels of God dwell in those places and walk up down the aisles and one more and Lord we know sitting here whether we're in our living rooms or in our offices or wherever we might be we know that the presence of the Lord is here with us because you promised that you'd be here gathered around your word and around your children and even the angels of God are encamped about those that fear them so we don't have to worry Lord about whether we're in a church or out of a church you promised you'd be here and here you are now lord I pray you take your word so and that you would anoint me to speak that which you'd want to be delivered to the children of God tonight and that you'd open up every heart that they'd be able to receive that which was spoken unto them tonight and all the things that you'll say to us we want to commit this service and all the remainder of it I want to thank you for what's been accomplished thus far and thank you for what you've done amen in the singing and all the other little parts Lord that we are so grateful to you about we pray the Holy Spirit will come tonight now and anoint this word that we can receive it as we commit it to your Lord both speaker and listener in the name of Jesus Christ and all the saints of God said amen amen hallelujah glory to God praise the Lord and thank you Jesus amen if you can get all that in good for you amen god bless you you could be seated amen greetings to the invisible audience tonight those that are hooked up by the way of the stream and greetings to the Saints I'm looking at several of you now and I'm going to have to be careful with this son's preaching I'm looking at a lot of daughters sitting in that room right there tonight and thankful for the daughters of God and I want you to remember that when we talk about sons we're also preaching about the daughters of God as well but now the Bible always has a tendency to address sons as we know the male is always identified first in the way that he puts it because Adam of course is the head over the woman so a lot of times the Bible to adjust the male but that doesn't exclude the female but it just just God's way of addressing the church he always speaks to the leaders of the church and then the leaders are to communicate that vision on down amen to the family to the wives to the sisters and want more so this puts you right in there with us sis on this whole thing that we're talking about here tonight now I've got a lot of hay on the fork and I'm not going to get no hurry tonight and you're settled in with me and I got books and things laying here all over my little office desk and chair and all this around here and I'm just thankful to God in one way that I'm not there tonight because I guarantee you ain't got enough room for me to preach up here with all I got with all this here amen right there tonight but I've made myself a little Pentecostal shopping room here tonight so I'm a little less crampin when I was last night and ready to go so we're thankful for that now and reading this in Galatians now I want you to kind of get a picture in your mind if you can about what Paul is trying to describe to us because now remember Paul is the messenger that is going to take the Old Testament he's going to take all of the laws and the washing of the pots and the pans that we talked about last night and now he's going to try to bridge the gap between this old and this new and being that he's the first messenger of God for the Gentile people now he's going to try to take all of those good things that God wants to remain from the past and bring them and position them over here now there's going to be certain things that's gonna come to it's expiration date and there's gonna be certain things it's going to go so far and then God's gonna cut it off for example the sacrifice will be cut off once and once and for all in the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ and now that the Lord Jesus has been crucified the blood has run out of his body and separated his earthly life now death burial and resurrection now there is no more need for a lamb or a bullock or a ram or any of these other things as a matter of fact when Israel receives their atonement coming up here in a little while they will not receive the atonement by the red heifer or by the blood sacrifices of animals but the true hundred and forty-four thousand will realize that the true atonement was the death of the Lord Jesus Christ remember what he said in Zechariah he'll present himself to them and they'll ask where did you get them scars in the house of my friends then they'll realize after Moses and Elijah preached it to them for a little while about what took place and what the real true sacrifice is now we know what they're going to do they're going to set up a temple and they're going to do all these other things and have the red heifer and all of that but the heifer is not their true atonement the Lord Jesus is their true atonement and when they recognize that then they will recognize what it means to be then a born-again Christian and remember they'll be sealed in one hour now Paul is trying to get all of this over from the old end of the New Testament and it's going to take about 2,000 years or more to be able to get the entire Gentile body position to get every Son of God in their rightful place to get the entire Gentile mystery expressed in the opening of the seven seals and then the as we'd say the icing on the cake with Israel coming into their position at the end so Paul has a very important job and that job is to establish for the people of God what that is going to look like what a son is supposed to look like all right now if you got your Bible there let's let's go back now and I just want to look at first Corinthians chapter three let's pick up verse 21 and I just want to read just backtrack just a little tiny itty-bitty bit just to catch a word or two of some of the things we left off with last night and and brother Matt just checking in we're doing all right with sound and everything correct everything looking all right all right just I've got my phone here if you need to contact me holler at me right real quickly and we'll make sure that we get everything just exactly where you can hear the message because that's the main thing even if this camera shuts off and and and you don't see me no more amen if it went completely black hear the message don't look at the messenger of anyway that's not the main thing look at the message alright first Corinthians chapter 3 verse 21 now 21 22 23 now remember what we read last night that God wants to put all things into the hands of sons members sister I'm talking to y'all as well amen he said therefore let no man glory in men for all things hour yours see hour yours whether Paul Apollo's Cephas or the world or life of death of things present or things to come all are yours and ye are Christ's and Christ is God's now he's identifying that the sons and the daughters as well now but the sons are in full possession of everything God is now let's use a little remark it brother Branham made to bring that in a little bit clearer remember the prophets said all that God was he poured it into Christ and all that Christ was huh then he poured it into the church so everything God was everything God had was then poured into the body of Jesus Christ who was the fullness of the Godhead bodily and now all of that is being poured into you and I now if we are then to come into full possession of everything that God wants for us then all right what's the process how are we supposed to get there Here I am at point a and I need to be at point B well how am I supposed to get there all right now Paul begins to identify for us there in Galatians again that he said we are as a pair if you look in there Galatians 4:1 that as an air as long as he is a child now watch this now he differs nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all now why is that because the Apostle Paul is telling us that there's gonna have to be some training involved in order for this son to be able to take it all he has to prove himself to be of the right kind of seed all that understand that say Amen one time even you and the invisible audience you you say Amen as well sitting there in your living room everywhere you are amen and and allow yourself to just kind of absorb that thought for just a moment so in order for him to prove he's the seed it's going to take some time anybody ever plant a garden put your seeds in the ground take a look at those seeds laying in there and and say well praise the Lord I got tomatoes potentially you do praise the Lord I got carrots coming potentially you do but you really don't know what they are until it's some time has passed and they've grown up and now they're beginning to express what they are for those of you that are Facebook buddies with me I I we planted some carrots last year they never come up and would you know at the beginning of the growing season this year you probably saw the picture of it that we got great big old bunches of purple carrots that had come up right at the growing season and those carrots had laid in that ground all through summer last year all through fall all through winter through almost the beginning of the of spring nearly and all of a sudden we went out there to pull weeds and when we got out there to pull the weeds there was a big bunch of carrot heads sticking right out of the carrot top sticking right out of the ground now that seed took some time to prove what it was so we say that were sons of God we say that were daughters of God but remember my friends it takes time to prove what it is it's laying inside of you hey man stay with me just a little while and let's look at a couple of things now watch your again he said though he'd be a child he differs nothing from a servant in other words he's got to prove exactly what is all about he is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father now we all aware of what brother bream said and how he said that when it come to these type of things like this he talked about how that a tutor would be set over that son remember the adoption when he started talking about the behavior of that boy and he'd say how would he act and how would he do and and if he did right then he was a chip off the old block and if he didn't the father would hang his head and disappointment and hang his head in shame well now we find the same thing taking place for you and I as children of God now we say were bribed we say were the elect we say were mrs. Jesus Christ but I want you to listen to me church it's gonna take some time to prove that that don't come right away when you first get saved and you first give your heart to the Lord you got to give it some time to let the seed begin to develop a little bit to produce exactly what it's supposed to produce to show what it's all about now I want to read to you from spoken words original seed here and I'm picking up page 23 here now listen what brother Branham said and I I like this I don't usually get to pack my books around with me when I travel but I'm getting a read out of a book tonight this is old fashioned young people you may not this is called a book I don't know if you ever seen one before but a mint they used to be popular how to hook you hallelujah you can't swipe him now and they don't swipe it you got to turn the page and everything but anyhow that's how that goes now watch her brother been sitting on the most start page 22 and then come over a little bit brother BAM said Jesus now watch Jesus is the word made manifest he and the word is one in the same this is paragraph 144 if you'd like to look at later and that's why it was so manifest in him so perfectly now that's the reason God manifested so perfectly in Jesus because he was the seed word the germ were itself oh I like that they meant the German word itself the germ that's inside the seed the life that's in the seed who said you get it he said he was the germ word of God and the germ is the spirit the germ is the water and Jesus had to be broken open there in order for that seed to let forth its life the water other seed that was coming oh my don't you see it the congregation said a man he said even other sheep that's not of this fold I have jesus said they're gonna see that see they're gonna get that word and stay right with it I hope that's what me and you were doing right now we're making this quote live I hope and believe in trust that we're getting it we're getting that word and staying right with it he said I'm sending forth the spirit to water it and it will produce just exactly watch now it'll produce miracles it'll produce the power of God it'll produce and it will not deny anything because it's a kindred seed with the sea amen so then we see that Jesus was the seed of God made manifest and made reference to Galatians again last night where Paul said that Jesus was the seed remember talking about the bond woman she had a son and Ishmael which was a wild man a bush man and just even today the Arabs over there you can't tame them you can't do nothing with them amen and then you have Isaac's line which was not the true seed promised of God but it was the natural seed promised remember neither one shall be heir to the other but then the spiritual seed of Abraham remember there were three sons Ishmael Isaac and Jesus Jesus was the spiritual son that was promised to Abraham not of seeds plural Paul said but a sea in other words he was the true German word see now we hear people talking about the seed of God inside of them and I'm born with a seed and all this now I believe in that to an extent but what we have to be careful of is we have to be sure that when we're saying such things that were not saying it incorrectly I do believe that God plays a germ of life inside every believer that will come to eternal life that but that seed now watch now was not placed in your flesh it was not placed in your bloodstream it was not placed in your genetics or your DNA or your genetic code but that seed was in Jesus Christ laying there dormant waiting for manifestation until you took the breath of life and came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and received the baptism of the holy ghost that seed word was in Christ will you say he dropped it into me might have done it I won't disagree that when you was a baby crawling on the floor that there was a life hiding in there somewhere but remember that seed what in your flesh because if it was in flesh if it come by the genetic code if it come by passing of grandfathers and grandmothers and all that amen now we're talking about a natural seed line but remember Christ was not after the natural line but after the spiritual line I'll ask you a question who was the father of the Lord Jesus Christ God was his father amen and God is a spirit and we must worship Him in spirit and truth somebody running around saying glory to god i'm predestinated the seat of gods placed in me yeah but what they're talking about is they're talking about something inside their flesh that makes them superior to somebody else I Got News for You friends this old tabernacle that you live in this whole body that you live in it is just as sinful as every other person walking on the face of this planet that's not the thing that makes you predestinated this is why brother Branham said that it isn't the person that comes predestinated by God but it is that life or that seed or that germ that is in Jesus Christ that is predestinated to be what it is amen am i preaching that faster you listen in that slow which one is it Amen all right now now I'm gonna pack it all in and don't forget you know when we bring these things in you can understand why the Bible taught us that it was one Sun bringing many sons into repentance all right let me just let me just stop right there for just a moment one Sun bringing many sons and repentance all right look here at a good type of this when you pick this up in First Samuel chapter 16 verse 11 if you want to write this down it's 11 12 and 13 so first same as 16 11 through 13 Samuel said to Jesse and here are all my children of course he's looking for David to come don't know he's looking for David but he's looking for David he said there remains the youngest and he keeps the Sheep and Samuel said to Jesse fetch you alright he said when he brought him in he was ruddy and with a love a beauty count countenance and goodly to look at in other words he was handsome amen and and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel takes the Horn of oil and he anoints David in the midst of his brethren now watch the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forth now watch how brother Brandon types this anointing upon David this is the message called the great warrior David in 1955 he said now what does the oil represent in the Bible the Holy Spirit he said when he poured that oil upon him he baptized him with the Holy Spirit in semble form he said oh I hope you get that that come fresh he poured the oil upon him and it went all over him the whole Horn of oil full of it not sparingly he said that's the way God pours the Holy Spirit on man not sparingly just baptizes him into it anointing him with the spirit he said notice he right then when that anointing struck him he was positionally placed as a king alright don't fail that now you are / you are placed positionally in Christ Jesus as kings and priests he says that right the moment you receive the Holy Spirit God places you in the kingdom and air what a beautiful picture there you are see God placed you in the kingdom as an heir that's right remember if you pick up Psalm chapter 1 now and you go to look at what he said about that tree planted by the rivers of living water remember that seed was positionally placed by the rivers of living water but in order for that seed to become a full heir of everything that laid inside of it it took time it took time for it to grow it took time for it to develop so then Paul tells us we are placed under tutors under governors those that can train us those that can teach us those that can instruct us glory to God until can come into the full inheritance of the sons of God oh it's the perfect you got your shouting shoes on tonight I hope so because well we getting in some deep water here and you may need to shout a little bit amen amen to wait on through it alright now if he was positionally placed then as the king remember at the very moment that that anointing oil falls on David remember he is not the king of Israel at that moment but as far as God is concerned all of the potentials is laying right there and David right at that very moment oh it's just as perfect as it can be alright now watch it again in adoption where the man said now little David he said what did he do he took that slingshot he said grab that little lion now the lion's mouth he said think of it went after that lion and got the lamb he said who in the world would do that tell me a man in here that would do that raise up your hand East I'll tell you quick your home is they didn't see me put mine up he said I wouldn't he said I wouldn't go after him with a 36 army but he went after him with the slingshot little piece of leather like at two strings around it winding around he said because when it come time for Goliath to make his boast he went after Goliath he said the God of heaven has let me deliver out of the mouth of the lion out of the mouth of the bear all right it was the power of God that went with him amen are you catching that it was the power of God that went with him all right let's refer to last night just a moment why was the anointing on David why was the anointing oil on him in the first place as a king because he was a son oh don't miss that church don't miss that little bride because he was a son a chosen son he the anointing could fall upon him to produce these powerful acts of God because he was the son why do you think healing and miracles and all these great things accompanied the people of God it is because they are the bride of Jesus Christ and because they are the bride then it can accompany their walk with God see and that's what we see today we God's got some David sticking around he said yes sir this feed and father's sheep once in awhile or two a cancer something will Chuck plum out of the hands of the doctor that won't stop that David he'll go right out there after that big fellow with a slingshot ask me anything in my name it would be given I don't care you said doctors can laugh everybody else could make fun him he'll go after him anyhow bringing that sheet back to the fold yes sir it's God's child take your hand off of it he said that's right knock this line down line rows up he grabbed you by the beard and killed him a little bit you're ready boy probably paid weighed rather 80 or 90 pounds just a little bitty old fella but why did these things happen why were they taking place what was the purpose of it because David was an anointed son don't miss that out there amen and you that are listening online out there in this submissive alliance I want you to make you a note write it down each one of you write it down the reason God is gonna bless me is because I am his son the reason the anointing of the hour follows me is because I am his child you ought to write that down and read that to yourself every morning afternoon and night at least 3 or 400 times a day the reason I can be a concur the reason I'll have victory glory is because I am a child of God oh I hope that lays right in your lap naplan how could you say bad things happen sure they're gonna happen this David was anointed but he still had lions in his life and depending on how deep south you get that line kind of sounds like a lion ly ing you still got some of them kind of things in your life sure you will lion bandes well we just say I've been waiting all this time sure but keep on waiting you're an anointed child you're an anointed child how do you know these things aren't given for a purpose behind oh you sets a good cop-out yes I know yes I know it's easy to say well troubles gonna come it comes to the center that's true but the difference between a child of God going through problems and a sinner going through problems is the center is not anointed to overcoming they're not anoint the Whippet and you don't always have to necessarily be free from it to overcome it I want you to think about something just a moment whatever David sat there in that pasture out there watching his father's sheep he might have killed one line but there was hundreds of them that was roaming around all the time the threat was constantly looming over faith responsibility he was constantly dealing with an issue constantly dealing with the problem he had to be on his toes and wide-awake every hour of his life but how do we know David was anointed to fight to win because every time something showed up in his pathway no matter how difficult a hard it was he just pressed right on through that trial and that trouble in that battle he press right on through it until he was able to come out on the other side with his hands raised saying thank God Almighty he brought me through another another hard time another trial another battle none of this none of that friend don't be deceived some people are putting a gun in their mouth some people are walking off and committing suicide and and and leaving their families and leaving God and leaving Church and given up on life and living their life out of a bottle and at the other end of a of a marijuana cigarette or shooting some kind of a dope in their vein or some that they've given up on life because there's no anointing hallelujah to keep him in the battle let me tell you what a fighter looks like a fighter is a fighter when he's in a fight oh yeah that should have got a real big hallelujah day man out there you don't call him a fighter if he's sitting in the corner twiddle his thumbs anybody ever seen a boxing match anybody put your hand up you ever seen a boxing match I didn't ask if you wanted to but I asking if you saw it you see them boys out there with their gloves on their hands and they're throwing and swinging and sweating and going back and forth like that but you look after and say wonder what they're doing you identify what they're doing they're fighting they're in a fight that's why they call them fighters amen if they were sleepers they had to look a whole lot different than that wasn't it they'd be laying in the van right Eider is known by his behavior no matter how much anointing lays on the bride well listen she is in order to overcome even though the fight may come every single day you wake up every afternoon every night throughout the middle and it's sunup sundown there's a fight somewhere and the fights coming but how do you know you are a child of God you're anointed to take the fight that's right and you win you will win oh you said I don't feel like I'm winning too much no maybe not but there's there's a winning side all of that if you're not getting up you're still winning and now they right he said the doctors can say anything they want to say but it doesn't matter he said he goes right on out there and fights anyhow alright now watch down Psalm one that was verse 3 blessed is the man that walketh not the counsel of the ungodly stanways sinners see the scornful so and so forth he shall be like a tree planted so he's persistently placed in Jesus Christ but you said oh brother man we're talking about adoption so we are and how is the bride going to get to adoption how are we going to get to a place of adoption if in that place of adoption there's no growth remember when you get born again you don't become an adopted son of God right at that exact moment your positionally placed in Jesus Christ as a seed as a seed and say watch down restoration the bride see brother Brent said David saw this tree he said a long time ago what tree was a Tom at you you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you knew the bride tree that's what David saw he said in the writing of the songs for something joyful he said he saw this tree planted by the rivers of living water God's tree amen that's what you are whoo Laurie planted where by the rivers plural see the rivers of water plural the water singular seeing again putting on the whole armor of God it shall be light in the evening time Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the bride tree it come up at Pentecost there's a tree that David saw planted by the rivers of water one river the Holy Spirit and all these waters flowing into it give spiritual gifts flowing into it it's leaves cat with her it'll bring forth its fruit he says right remember it'll bring forth its fruit in its season why the germ the life the water the seed all of it was inside that seed whenever it was planted in the ground and then remembered Paul said but you differ nothing from a servant until when after a period of time under tutors and governors you begin to put forth that you are a son you think like a son you speak like a son you behave like a son your action is son like are you with me see now watch here and got this people brought them said the bloom don't come out of the air the bloom don't come up through the ground the bloom is already in the tree what's that bloom doing in there anyways huh he said the apples already in it what's that Apple doing that inside of it because that's what kind of seed it is he said how do I know I'm an overcomer what kind of seeds in you how do I know I'm a conqueror what kind of seeds in there if the seed word is on the inside because you are a son everything is already planted in you at the baptism of the Holy Ghost you said all it has to do is drink drink more than its portion it'll spread out and then it'll bring these elements now I want to read to you just a little bit now from another place here I want to grab the invisible Union the Bride of a camp for just a moment I want to reach is something else here brother Brandon talked about on this thing of the seed and I want you to listen to this what brother brems said talking about this branch and he said the bridegroom talked about the bride and the bridegroom he said you were deceived by your first marriage time not when you come out through mother Eve now he said of course he said you said a real born-again Christian a real servant of God to hear that word he said he'll come right out through every denomination to that real fertile ground by the word the bedding ground he'll just do it I don't know how he does it God has ordained it to be done that's right he said Noah was vindicated for the word of his day he said his message won't work today Moses was vindicated he said but his message won't work for today John was vindicated said you believe that but it wouldn't work in the days of Jesus he said certainly not the law and the prophets were until John he said since then the kingdom of heaven but the Apostles them who set forth the Bible Luther come out the Reformation his words and his church that won't work today Wesley and Pentecost had worked in their day but it's another day he said this is the opening of the seven seals all right now watch he said I know it sounds strange to you but God has vindicated it so perfectly amen he said I had scattering that to the local assembly here I'm speaking to the people out across the nation see do what you wish to said but now notice the anointed word of his day of which you are a part by predestination you immediately like knew when you heard you knew right quick that she was an eagle you also realize she wasn't a denominational chicken to begin with you know there's something wrong in there something wrong he said that's right you were trapped into it at the beginning but then he said he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of God's forgiveness by washing it with the water of the word and the blood of life alleluia alleluia how did you know that you was an eagle the seed declared it what was on the inside of you declared something is greater than what I'm sitting here like this yeah something see Luther's message won't work for today a certain individual that left the message number years ago so well I'm a little depressed a'f occasion justification won't work for today that won't work some other fella said well the problem in the message is we need to get everybody's sanctified sanctification alone Walt that's not the message it'll bring you in and some preachers are stuck in that every time they come to church they they looking at the sisters and try to see how long has their hair or how short is the dress or how high is the healer yeah I believe in holiness you all know I do but sanctification alone won't bring you to the fullness of what you're supposed to be that message alone won't work our couple justification was sanctification now you get a little somewhere now tie those two in with the restoration of these spiritual gifts of God now you're getting down the road a little bit all right what about the restoration of malachi 4 where the word and the power has to be restored well if the word and the power has to be restored and the son was the word then don't the son have to be restored right with that word I hope you're getting it out there you see it if the word has to be restored so does that Sun because the Sun is a part of that word right you said that anointed said now this today is the opening of the seven seals now I don't mean no harm in this but dancing across the front of the pulpit and kicking your shoe around and jumping up and down and Hollow where the bride and we got power and glory to God we're on the way out of here interruption all that that's good preaching that'll make you holler amen and praise the Lord but it don't establish you as a son look I believe in emotion I believe we need it I believe we need to worship God I believe in tongues I believe in gifts I believe in prophecies I believe in all of that I'm not by no means what I want to leave you with the impression that I don't believe in supernatural acts of God nor do I want you to think that it's all just of what we say quote unquote the word because the letter kills but the Spirit gives it life so some of these folks that are quote unquote in the word there's dead as midnight I wouldn't know what shouting looks like slapped him on the back of the head hello somebody can you see me you could holler a man and it gonna hurt you though huh right all the glory to God we're in the word all right well notify your face cuz your face don't look like it's in anything but misery you understand and yet in the opening of the word the opening of these seven seals when the greatest power is supposed to position the bride yet these two schools of thought are laying right there before the church all the time you got the one group over there that's trying to pull them right back into these old ways look friends I believe in altar calls but an altar call is nothing more than a traditional thing yes Sunday School Dwight moody started that as traditions we do it we believe in those things they help our young people some of the great lessons I learned about God was sitting in a Sunday school some old mother reading me out of the Bible or something like that I'm not against these things but what I'm trying to tell you is that if we're going to get positioned as a son we got to have the right food the right vitamins the right message to get us in that right position and just walking around preaching we got a message we got a message we got a message to me that's just as bad as some people 20 years ago 30 years ago walk around how we got a prophet we got a property we got a prophet and until some of you brethren might remember but the Martin but the Gerald and some of you brother might remember when they used to do this stuff years ago we got a prophet brother brems a prophet we got a prophet malachi for amount of cardboard and somebody finally stood up and said hey what do you say well my question denied to us is the elect of God is yes we've got a message but what does the message do for us come on somebody it should position us hallelujah to show us what we are to identify what kind of power lays inside of us don't you get tired of wandering around with your head in the clouds not knowing what tomorrow holds come on just be honest with me don't you don't you get tired of one around wandering around wonder wonder wonder wonder wonder are we ever going to come to the spot to where we take possession of what God promised us and say you know what today is my day as of right now I'm gonna take possession of what God promised me and I'm not gonna wonder a guess or be clueless anymore I'm gonna put my feet on this word and I'm gonna walk forward into God whatever you want me to do I'm stepping right into that vision no matter what anybody else says about it they don't that sound nice well in order to get there then you're gonna have to follow the right message of what it needs to be understand every time you come to church now this is some few years back I come to the church I preached on the Holy Ghost and we had some people give their hearts to God Jenna and some of them give their hearts to the Lord and Abby and some of them you know and and and and how wonderful it was to see that but brother I'm gonna tell you something if every time I showed up in Newfoundland whether on this camera or whether in physical presence if all I had to preach you is get born again get born again get born again get the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost to me if it look like brother bin you need to get into the message the church has to progress from where they start after they've been positionally placed then the church has to grow beyond where that initial way was remember I quoted to you Hebrews 6 last night where Paul said this will do if God permit but let us go on to perfection 1 to maturity all right so what am I trying to say I'm trying to say that if the seed word is laying inside of you look at brother brems trying to say this he said is the message of the hour the opening of the seven seals do you understand not probably 10 people understood what that prophet was even trying to say and I'm being very generous they probably had no idea what brother branham was trying to tell them he got people sitting there from every denominational walk of life Pentecostals and everything and he's trying to tell them about the opening of the seven seals and there's they're sitting there looking at him about like something y'all looking at me right now Oh what is it supposed to mean well that that's that's what we're gonna drive a little bit tonight all right now notice he said this is another day it's the opening of the seven seals now what did the seals bring to you and I night-night now get it out of your mind that the only thing them seven seals done was told us who them horse riders was get out of your mind that all it did was position Israel and tell us what was laying underneath that fish seal that the seals was a whole lot more than that that was the part that was written when you read that school book and you understand who the first horse rider is understand that was the part that was written because remember when you looked at the seal there was a written part on that seal remember let's let's catch it just a moment just because I'm gonna go into the explanation of this just briefly but pick it up revelation five I got my Bible right here let me just pull it open all right now see I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne see a book written that's revelation 5:1 a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals now there was a mystery in that in that seal and there was a written part on the backside it was sealed with a seal so when you looked at it say why horse rider but once the seal broke there was a mystery underneath that all right now once you listen the mystery of God if you can understand it the mystery of God behind that first horse rider was Satan's whole scheme of hiding in religion what that white horse rider is now if all the seal is to you and I as well just the white horse rider well praise the Lord that's wonderful you got that much of it but you got to look deeper than that if Satan is hiding in religion where is the devil hiding today people he's hiding right here in the message of the hour people packing these books quoting these quotes set in our pews that's where the devil is hiding today and I'm awed and say something I hope you're ready for it but standing in the pulpit to don't thank everything that walks behind that sacred desk out yonder has got the baptism of the Holy Ghost not every one of them had the right seat on the inside of them so the seal declares to us that there's a white horse rider that's the written part that's the part we can read right here in the Bible but what is the mystery of it all right so then what is the revelation of the seven seals to us the potential of everything you are was hiding underneath those seven seals you see when the angel of the Lord comes and that book has been opened up in his hand remember he takes that book gives it to the seventh angel the seventh angel breaks that mystery to the people and then John says now give me that book because once the mystery is declared now John says give it to me who's that type out that types out the bride of Jesus Christ standing there waiting on the revelation to come from Christ down to her about what that she's a son as she's a daughter and all the potentials that lay in her as a son and daughter now if you watch this in the adoption brother brems said now what is a seal a seal the first thing it shows is the work has been completed so them seven seals they declare to us that the work has already been completed see in your mind you might think well I'm gonna get there one day in God's mind it's already done yes sir he just waiting on you to match the vision of what he prophesied in his own mind right another thing he said it shows ownership the next thing it shows security they talked about the Boxcar he said they went through and got everything set just right and said once they had everything put in there he'd make an inspection over it and then they'd put a seal on the outside it shows a completed work it shows ownership and it shows security so here's brother branham telling us we are living in the time of the breaking of them seven seals the revelation of them seals shows what to you and I ownership security and a completed work oh praise the Lord and hallelujah and amen don't you realize you can't be some little googoo gah-gah baby down playing around on the floor and your son I don't know if I'll make it today and tomorrow I'm still not sure and the next day I'm really I'm not with it no no if you're a son there's a completed work in there there's a security that lays in there you see folks running around I don't even know if I'm saved well I'm sure they don't know but if they come on up into the time of the opening of the word if they step into the position of the opening of the word no more justification meaning that every time you come to church you're not running to the altar trying to get saved again not now I'm gonna say something please don't think I'm thrown off on camps but that's one of my biggest pet peeves about youth camps and it seemed like every time they get to be young people there they want to run them into the altar get them saved anything wrong with that no but what about them ones that are sitting there that's already give their heart to the Lord five camps in a row huh why is it we call it young people's meetings but what we mean is get him the altar and let him cry and holler and snot and carry on meetings see those kind of things is just as dangerous as going into a place and just preaching holiness holiness holiness all and watch your dress watch your hair what this watch of that watch watch watch watch watch watch don't wear a watch while you're at it watch much much it doesn't produce anything self-made holiness like that produces zero guru sake nothing nada now if that's the message and that's what we're supposed to do let me ask you how can we ever come into our full position if those are the things that we feed on you understand this is why preachers have got to be diligent to feed to us the Word of God of where we're at now if it's a seal of righteousness as Paul makes reference in Romans chapter 4 verse 11 he calls it the seal of righteousness of that of faith then that seal of righteousness is also Matthew 21 42 it is the stone which the builders rejected so that stone then seals together all of God's potentials on the inside of you alright I'm seeing twinkles in your eyes I'm getting I'm getting the deer in the headlight look I'm I'm getting a little deep for some of you I'm sure but that's all right stay with me just a moment I'm taking you somewhere but I I'm taking it slow because I don't want to just jump right into this thing and because you get too far down and certain things and you start missing the point of it and then what good does that do you if you don't understand it so my Walker does say boy he was deep yes did you understand a word he said not a word he said but it was deep sure hallelujah Amen don't do you no good that way all right now if you'll notice the bridegroom then the bridegroom is bringing in a pure unadulterated bride word that he washes with the water of his own blood see that she might become flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and then brother Branham said like this whatever you are this is page 36 invisible Union you are servants of God whatever God wants you to do where your place is God placed in the church some apostles prophets teachers pastors he placed that by the virtue of his own predestination and you were that to begin with but like I'm looking tonight at amber Priscilla all right did you all know when you as a little girl you'd be married two coffees you probably drank a lot of coffee but you'd know you'd be married to a coffee shorter but the potential was that you was already a bride when he was playing with baby dolls wherever whatever he was doing you know how girls do I got three of them and they put ribbons in your hair and all kinds of stuff I keep trying to remind my girls I am NOT a girl I'm a boy I've had enough perfume and ribbons in my hair last me a lifetime I love you but all of that was laying inside of you the potential was there whatever you was preacher housewife actor worker whatever you was see now watch he said we all know the modern church in his present state is in no condition to finish up the Great Commission that God gave the church for this day he said now how many Pentecostal can say amen to that he said oneness Tunas three just any other fuss and fight one this one that in the other everyone I'm afraid to face the word right down to the test you tell them about this I can't help but I can't believe that he said see it shows what your what mammy and Pappy you have you might be a state president or someday you might be this or that you better be a son of God now we know that the church could not the Pentecostal church could by no means carry out the last day message but it's going to be the elected people that's elected for it all right what is the last day message be careful be careful because other ministry in this truth will lead you to believe that to carry out the last day message is to learn how to be a parent and say brother brems said brother Branham said brother Branham said brother Branham said brother BAM said brother bream soon that just proves you got the ability to read but what is the last day message that's what I'm asking you tonight I want you think about it dis minute what is the last day message all right he comes on down see not aftershock and he said to vindicate Luke 1730 vindicate Malachi 4 vindicate Luke 17 revelation 10 C to vindicate all of these promises now what does that mean to vindicate in other words when we say vindicate what we're talking about is make it live manifest all right now how many of you tonight in your own mind would say to yourself well brother bit I'm pretty far off now I'm nowhere near where I need to be how many feels that way yeah all right I figured as much but I'm gonna take this the last little bit of my time here because we've been going right now this just over two hours the whole thing from start to finish from that half hour of silence to right now than going a couple hours but if in your mind you think well I'm not too close all right I'm gonna I'm gonna challenge you tonight to think what are you looking for if the final inspection if when the inspector comes by to look and see what qualities is on the inside of you if he does the final inspection what is he looking for all right now be careful when you think of this the last day truth what does that mean well glory to God it means I can explain the seven thunders it means I can explain you know going beyond the cab I can explain marriage and divorce that just proves you can read but I'm asking you what is he looking for is he looking for someone that can raise the dead be careful huh is he looking for someone that inspection that he's gonna do on us is he looking for someone that can manifest all nine spiritual gifts be careful now be careful how you answer I'm just giving you a little heads-up not at all as a matter of fact when he puts the seal on he's not looking for one gift he's not looking for one supernatural act he's not looking for one supernatural manifestation none of that is in consideration to whether or not you were a son or a daughter now you can look back there on that board right there and you see that that pyramid there within virtues on it now when you look at faith virtue knowledge temperance patience all that do you see speaking squirrels in that I mean it's connected to it but I mean when you read the word virtue power of God what do I see in that well you say power of God that's creating squirrels okay but can't anybody with faith believing the Word of God can't they go out there and do supernatural acts of God mmm sure faith will do all kinds of things but does that mean when the in final inspection comes that God will see that in them and say ah chip off the old block what is real power I got one for you being able to turn your cheek to your enemy being able to love those that hate you now if the master is going to do is final inspection to see if this son is in a position to where you can inherit all things what's he looking for I mean does it matter if the son is good-looking [Laughter] remember sisters it's just as easy to say Amen to a rich one as it is to an ugly one to whatever you'd be handsome or ugly whichever one you can say man to boat but is that the criteria think about it now what's he looking for if he's inspecting us you say but I've never raised the dead sister she carrion was said for the bream I fasted and prayed fasted and prayed fasted and prayed to cast out Devils and I still can't cast out Devils he said you wouldn't call to cast out Devils you recall to pray for those who can that's a supernatural act of God wouldn't you agree but is that what he's looking for now in our minds when we think oh I'm farther I'm so far away from what I really need to be are you look at your love for God look at your love for your enemy do you want I'm sure ya make a few little mistakes but how long does it last it not long you get angry at somebody you might struggle for a few weeks maybe even a couple years or some kind of thing but it's not a struggle like what the world has as you pray through it you're constantly praying about it you're praying and asking the Lord to help you in it and on and on and on so when he's doing the inspection inside of your heart don't forget he's not looking for some great supernatural speak the word control control storms and do supernatural things see we look at brother Brennan when we say brother Branham had those qualities in him ergo I must be like brother branham wrong wrong wrong wrong brother Branham was given a ministry to catch the attention of the entire world and the supernatural glory that shone through brother branham's ministry that was given for a purpose Alleluia and praise the Lord some 65 years later that even the critics can't shut up about him they built websites and everything talking about him that's the kind of influence he had on he had to demonstrate powers of God so great that it would catch the attention of the entire world so is that what the inspector is looking for if you're a son a daughter is he looking down inside of your life and saying all right all right I want to see that spoken word creative power where is he looking for sincerity submission humility a desire to be right how many desires to be right like you're 3/4 of the way down the road you just didn't realize you are see what we've done is we've taken these terms message of the our last a truth and we've spun them in a direction of believing that in order for us to be last day bribed people that when we walk into Walley world down there and we step into the front as brother Carl always said looking for a rubber dinky a man I found out that's a rubber boat it took me a long while to figure out what that rubber dinky was all about but I got her down when I step in the Walmart lightning bolt does not beam in lightning does not need to be shooting from my eye sockets to be spiritual all right thank now the group that has that opinion are the ones that meets Jesus at judgment and says I preached I prophesied have done great things and he says I didn't even know you so if in our mind I remember brother Brown was like the wave sheep and God exampled life to him that's true but what kind of man was brother Brennan I'd take away all the miracles take away all the supernatural I'm talking about discernment of spirit and taking the hand and take away all of that from brother Branham what kind of man was brother Branham hang on everybody and don't Matthew don't let nobody touch that X button over there and X me out you keep me on for at least 10 more seconds here and don't you miss this what kinda man was brother Renan he liked to laugh brother Brennan got discouraged after the greatest movement of his life seven seals come open God catches him up in a constellation sends him back to Jeffersonville to open up some truths that brother brems waited on his entire life and not more than six months after that he has to drive through the parking lot and look at all of the different license plates trying to find encouragement because he thought nobody wanted to hear his message anymore just a few months after the opening of the seals anybody ever been there how many in here would I would believe that brother Branham was a manifested son of God put your hand up come on come on put him up oh you're kind of slow to raise them hands you know where I'm heading you're not too far away then are you take away all the miracles now take away being on the hunting trip the reason you asked me that brother McHugh's is because your mother pulled back her socks she's got tumors on her feet and your eyes are going bad you're going blind thus saith the Lord take all that away what kind of man was brother branham bank now Church he was a man who loved God he's a man that got discouraged he's a man that had to pray up I've I've been teaching Chinese children over overseas in China been teaching them English online and you don't see because I pulled it down but I got a little thing that hangs down it's a schoolroom back here behind me and when I want him to answer I speak like this and then I go like that so I'm just gonna train you let my Chinese kiss tonight when I want you to holler Amen I'm just gonna give it one of these right here brother Brennan was a man that did not understand everything that God did look at him and his shame to him standing right there we're gonna have to get the elders together get a ballpark together leather there's a vision of the Lord concerning this he's still trying to manifest the tenth vision he don't even understand how the things been fulfilled himself [Applause] look at him and ashamed to him that very message y'all ready for this am I ready holler a minute whoo Laurie I'm preaching now he has a dream and in this dream he was working for the gas company again but instead of going door-to-door and doing his job he's down by the river fishing and he thought to himself why I shouldn't be doing this I'm ratting around he called it that his old southern Express from Enid being lazy playing hooky I'm ratting around on the job he said he'd come out of it and woke up that morning and got to praying after he was troubled and he said to the Lord it's not that job I've been ratting around on it's your job I've been ratting around on anybody want to do the math on how long it was before God took the man's life how many believes brother Brown was a manifested son of God and yet here he is struggling and fighting with himself take away all the miracles take away all the supernatural take away all the discernments before the doctor touches you me t that tumor thus saith the Lord of go away no tumor found take away every bit of that what kind of man was brother branham do you believe he's a benefits the son of God sure was standing up there on the mountains sword comes into his hand this is the sword of the king he was trained the been positioned placed all of the expression of God was coming out of that prophet as being a son of God I mean his character not the fullness of course but the character God was in brother Branham he's standing there and standing in the gap and he's telling them pray for me I built up a complex and I'm gonna have to leave the field for a little while because I'm in an awful fix and I got to get myself right all right here we go anybody ever felt that way recently anybody ever felt that way and yet you believe Milgram was a manifested son of God what I'm trying to tell you children of God we're not as far away as we think we are because when we look at what the manifestation of the seed is remember the seed will produce all kinds of supernatural things short will but that's not what the inspector is looking for that's just a comfort immense that come to this it's those are things that accompany our salvation and I'm seeing a few heads go this way so I'm getting I'm beginning to break daylight a little bit huh all but brother Ben I'm so far what do you mean when you say that because you look at some of these things and you think if I am the seed Word of God if I am planted in Jesus Christ in other words I'm not supposed to have no trouble let me ask you again did David have his troubles was he an anointed king so he was the Horn of the anointed all had been pulled right on him allowed to fight lions he still had to fight bears he still had to fight Goliath all right here comes I'm gonna I'm gonna unload all of it on you right now this is the Whammy but if I'm a manifested son of God that means I will overcome everything there is to overcome overcome yes but fight is an entirely different thing than overcoming it doesn't mean that you won't fight you'll wake up in the morning and perhaps looking in the mirror you might be hurting so bad you can't even always stand up your eyes might be giving your problems your back might be giving you issues you might have grief in your heart you might be battling depression the day of the sir then you get up looking a mirror at your medicine cabinet you pulled him back to cabinet so you can get your pills for the day for your heart wherever what it might be manifested son of God manifested daughter of God all but if I'm a manifested son there won't be no sickness in my body where did he say it I want quote verse chapter line page verse I'll just go ahead and save you the trouble I've done the quote search myself it ain't there the boy when we get ahold of this third pull missing limbs are gonna be restored yes but how many we don't know God could do it one time in a body that could make up ten thousand he could do it one time just to prove that there's spoken word power amongst the body of Jesus Christ manifest the Son of God brother Branham was a seed of God he manifested the promise of God he manifested the Word of God just like he said there the message is coming open to you and I now what is that message a seal a completed work security ownership it see looking for what is the inspector looking for in our lives I'm closing here in just a minute I'm right at the very last of this what is he looking for brother brems said here the Holy Ghost is the inspector they maybe might shake you a little bit you might rattle you believe all the Word of God somebody I don't believe all that Jesus name stuff is you said condemns it I don't believe in divine healing or no such thing he said that rattle take him out you said when you rattle kick it out it ain't ready yet that's right cuz everything's got to be stacked up where it won't rattle and shake and carry on it's got to be packed just right have you received the Holy Ghost a man has everything being completed a man then what does the inspector do everything is packed in good and tight full of the gospel and every word of God is good everything is perfect I believe every word of God you believe that God still heals amen you believe Jesus save me a saying for every man you believe the Holy Ghost as real as ever was a man you believe the same spirit though fell on Paul fell on us and a man you believe he does the same things he did on us that he did them and said AHA hey man I was she's getting tight nice like getting tight ready to close the door that's I'm asking you what's he looking for now if in our mind we've got this idea that to be a manifested son of God means that every time we set our feet on our bedside the devil starts going oh be careful that ain't your flesh the devil's afraid of Church what he's afraid of is a surrendered life and if there's any fear in the devil at all it's not because of you and this right here it's because of that promise word and because of what material is on the inside of you love joy peace longsuffering let me ask you a question has anybody ever been sad on the outside but been happy on the inside I'm gonna put my hand out you ever been crying but yet on the inside had peace you ever been so angry you feel like biting a head off a chicken or some kind of thing but yet there's something on the inside of you and I forgive them Lord I forgive them I'd like to kill them but I forgive them now I'm just being honest that's flesh stuff but that's something on the inside that's the material that the inspectors focusing on so if we are a seed of God then then the seed has nothing to do with whether we got great manifestations in our life again scale back everything that brother Adam did in the supernatural what kind of man was brother Brennan I got news for these bergen's and Collins's and the rest of these criticizers and the ones that throw off on brother brand websites and all that that little prophet of God could teach some of them bullheads a little bit about being a gentleman because take back all the miracles and scale back every good thing brother Branham ever did in the way of preaching brother Branham was a gentleman you know how to talk to people he knew how to treat people well they got me here about two or three months ago I ended up on their website I got my street cred now so I'm you know my ten minutes of fame Amen or whatever it was it took they had to agree with me a little bit so we understand what the minister's trying to say I said praise God we must be finally making progress with them but that's the way a goat does but-but-but-but-but sheep say a man goats just but at the word but what's he looking for friends you see I'm convinced that in our mind when we think manifested sons we identify the sonship part with some great manifestation of supernatural out there and let me tell you something friends no greater supernatural can be demonstrated in your life then bringing your life subject to the Lord Jesus Christ every single day of your life fighting your temper fighting your impatience making yourself pray all of them characteristics is what Christ positioned in you when you receive the Holy Ghost so I'm here to tell you you're not as far off as you think you are now how many feels like you're a little further down the road than what you did for a generation and the first time that's right you see and brother I'm not trying to be critical my friends I'm not trying to sound ugly about brother Branham and none of these things that other brothers have preached but we have gotten into a fantastical type way of preaching this message there has been such a can I say neglect when it comes to preaching the practicality of this message brother Branham was a practical human being did you that if brother branham couldn't take the gospel truth and fix it in his heart and fix it up in his heart where he could love somebody that hated him too brother branham it was worthless if he couldn't take the truth and the things that God showed him and fix it in his heart where he could absolutely project a love and so much that bees and bulls and everything else could normally get after him brother Branham looked for the practical application of how to live in Jesus Christ now sister you sitting there with your children all like that let's face facts you're probably never gonna speak to Arizona storms or Colorado storms or Ohio storms or any other storm for that matter but maybe your storm would be knowing how to go in when your kids are fussing and to be able to go right in the middle of that tornado and if you got young uns and they're going at it at all you know what I'm talking about the step right in the middle of that whirlwind and know how to handle that situation with such love in such grace that rather than ignite it like throwing gasoline on a burning fire already you can go in there with such love in such discipline and such steadfastness that you go right in the middle of a bunch of fussing kids and settle every one of them down and find peace in the situation that is more effective than being able to speak a storm out of existence so what are we looking for what's the inspector looking for now let's tie this together with Jesus who was the son what was God his father looking for in Jesus all right was it the lame leap like a heart was that the blinded eyes come open know all them things was just a fulfillment of the supernatural part that came with his ministry but scale all of that back and he did at Calvary when it comes to Calvary there's no healing there's no salvation there's no blinded eyes there's no resurrection none of that has taken place except for Jesus hanging on Calvary his own character manifested out of him when they're pulling his beard out of his face and hitting him and saying tell us who struck you and what more like that Father forgive them and that's what God his father was looking for in the character of Jesus Christ because don't forget God is a supernatural God supernatural follows God 100% faith will do supernatural things but what is the inspector looking for he's looking to see are we positioned in Christ and then after some time that these elements and that's why I preached this this way to try to show you these things were talking about that we feel like we're so far away from it's just gonna take some time for the tree to grow up a little bit for these things to manifest out of us so if you find in your life that you're still battling your temper well that's all right just keep drinking because eventually you'll push out and grow until you'll get over coming power over them things yes sir it takes us a little time just a little time but we're not too far off after all are we are we not as bad as we thought we was hey man now let me read you one more little place and we're gonna quit all right now this is Christ as the mystery page 44 I'm in the old book here and that probably matters when you come to the new one there are a few pages off there listen brother Brian talked about like this he said he said their organizations and scruples proved that it's not their time at the word the words never been correctly vindicated just only in its strength seeds denominations and they make they make denomination they put old gypsum weed seeds in with a genuine wheat and it dies right out he said briars and nettles and everything you said she went right back on died out he said but they planted some real seeds and some of them come out and that what he called gypsum seed in other words just old tear it choked out that real life but God's the last days he'd bring a people washed in the blood that were predestinated to be there in other words as a people coming that can't be choked out if you can understand what brother Bram is saying here and every age they planted seed but it got choked out by denomination but in the last hour in the message of the hour in the time of the revelation of the seals there's coming a seed that can't get choked out I'm gonna let you know something friends if you can continue marching on no matter what lays in front of you no matter what battle lays in front of you no matter what trial is laying in front of you if you can get up the next day and keep putting one foot in front of another and you refuse to be choked out that is proof that's your farther down the road than what you think you are hallelujah well god bless you here we are two hours 37 minutes and 19 seconds and counting but I think you understand what we're talking about now take these things and really like Mary ponder them in your hearts you know and say to yourself tell yourself I'm not as far as I think I am because in our mind we see the supernatural we see the great powers of God I think that's where we make our gravest mistake if I don't see that power living out of my life you may never do it you may be nothing more than a spiritual doormat mmm thank of it David said he wanted he said I'd be a doormat at the house of God have you ever seen a doormat doing anything supernatural have you ever seen a doormat do anything extraordinary the doormat spends its entire life semi wiping its dirty feet on them but they serve a purpose I'm not saying you're doormats now but I want you to think it in your mind when we say manifestation of the sons of God what are we looking for because when we say manifestation we're thinking supernatural but look at your love look at your patience look at what you used to be before you got saved look how you get mad at the drop of a hat well you say that's just aged by the bend you just grow out of them thanks Oh No I've counseled men in their 80s that are just like some twelve-year-old kid that ain't never been whipped yet just in the right way age ain't got nothing to do with it look at your character of what you used to be and where you are now how you progressed how you love how you're more patient how you've grown in wisdom and grace of God oh you said well that's just age and learning oh don't be naive the Bible said all good things come from the Father of lights in whom there is no variableness that's right so when the inspector comes he's looking for this pureness inside of your heart that's what he's looking for now if the supernatural comes along this will do if God permit sure if God permits it hey sickness gets in our way trouble getting our way Satan take your hand off it shore line comes up get away whatever whatever it is we'll let the Holy Spirit do what he wants to do this will do if God permit but that's not the thing because remember friends when we are changed and our bodies are changed and we're walking streets of gold remember you will have no need to speak to storms or heal the sick or raise the dead those are things that are given to us on this side but once this life is over and we cross this divide and come right back here to this earth to celebrate for eternity the total victory of the elect of God you won't have one need to cast out a devil once that new city sets on this earth so all those that cast out Devils praise God for them but that alone will come to a place that will cease didn't Paul say that where there's tongues will cease prophecy they'll cease this will cease that it will cease they said I've got love well that's a capstone ownership security and a completed work so you're not as far off as you think you are amen god bless you all right let's stand together let's have a word of Prayer and if you'd like to come to the piano sis you do I assume and does I think you're the only missus it moves this in there tonight aren't you
