[46:16] let's bow our heads our dear gracious
[46:20] Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank
[46:22] you for the gift of your presence here
[46:24] this day father Lord as we've spent our
[46:27] time worshipping and thanking the Lord
[46:29] and as we change the order of the
[46:31] service father I pray Lord that you just
[46:34] continue to bless us each and every one
[46:36] yes Lord may you just be with me around
[46:38] me I'd just be a willing vessel father
[46:40] this is not of me Lord not to puff
[46:42] myself up Lord but this is to praise
[46:45] your name father to give glory unto you
[46:48] Lord and I pray father that you would
[46:50] just speak Lord we want to hear from you
[46:53] each and every one of us has a need here
[46:55] father Lord whether it's our brother and
[46:57] sister from all the way the other side
[46:59] of Canada or us here Lord you can speak
[47:02] father you're not limited by time or
[47:04] location and we thank you for that Lord
[47:07] father pray that you just be with us now
[47:09] father may just open up the scriptures
[47:11] to us live and may we just look to your
[47:15] father pull on you father we thank you
[47:18] for your grace may just take anything to
[47:20] stands between us Lord I remove it Lord
[47:22] Jesus Christ's name I pray amen amen
[47:29] if we could take our Bibles and just
[47:31] turn to Matthew 26
[47:41] I just wanted to thank especially a
[47:45] better mark for the song service even
[47:48] though Bear Bob isn't here he's
[47:50] definitely is a good backup and him for
[47:54] being sensitive leading is a wonderful
[47:56] service a song server sorry so hey man
[48:00] so we can just Matthew 26 and verse 41
[48:03] he says watch and pray that you enter
[48:08] not into temptation the spirit indeed is
[48:10] willing but the flesh is weak and man
[48:14] god bless is reading you can be seated
[48:17] while you still got your Bibles if you
[48:20] turn over to mark 13
[48:33] and we'll start with verse 32 down to 37
[48:41] but of that day in that hour knoweth no
[48:44] man no not the angels which are in
[48:46] heaven neither the son but the father
[48:49] take heed watch and pray for ye know not
[48:54] when the time is for the son of man is
[48:57] as a man taking a far journey who left
[48:59] his house and gave authority to his
[49:01] servants and to every man his work and
[49:03] commanded the porter to watch watch he
[49:06] therefore for ye know not when the
[49:08] master of the house cometh and even or
[49:10] at midnight or at the cock-crowing or in
[49:13] the morning lest coming suddenly he find
[49:15] you sleeping and while I say unto you I
[49:19] say unto all watch
[49:24] so if you feel to take a little topic
[49:27] here on watch and pray the Scriptures
[49:31] especially in the Old Testament tends to
[49:35] refer to more as a watchman so first
[49:39] let's just find out what watch really
[49:41] means in Webster's dictionary it defines
[49:44] the word watches the act of watching the
[49:46] forbearance of sleep a vigil to be
[49:49] wakeful vigilant or constantly observant
[49:52] attention close observation to be on
[49:56] guard preventive or preservative
[49:59] vigilance formerly are watching or
[50:02] guarding by night so if we go back to
[50:06] the Old Testament the watch was
[50:09] considered to be during the night it was
[50:11] a four hour span and you switch out your
[50:13] guard for hours switch out your guard
[50:15] just so that they would stay observant
[50:18] and they wouldn't fall asleep so the
[50:21] prime example of this one here if you
[50:22] want turn to Nehemiah four and just to
[50:26] set a bit of a background there's
[50:28] Nehemiah he and the Jews have been in
[50:31] captive in captivity and Nehemiah he
[50:36] went before the king
[50:38] and he said to King Awad I'd like to go
[50:41] back to Jerusalem and rebuild it this is
[50:42] the the place of my people and so we got
[50:46] permission to go and while they were
[50:48] building this but they got word that
[50:50] there was people that were going wanting
[50:53] to stop them they had settled in the
[50:55] land and they considered they were
[50:56] squatters and they didn't like the idea
[50:59] of people reclaiming what was theirs so
[51:02] Nehemiah for person seven he said it
[51:08] came to pass that one Sanballat and
[51:10] Tobiah and the Arabians and the
[51:13] ammonites and the ash tonight's heard
[51:15] that the walls of jerusalem were made up
[51:17] and that the breaches began to be
[51:20] stopped then they were very wroth and
[51:23] conspired all of them together to come
[51:26] and fight against Jerusalem until
[51:27] hindereth but nevertheless we made our
[51:32] prayer unto our God and he said a watch
[51:35] against them day and night because of
[51:37] them and Judah said the strength of the
[51:40] Bears of the burden is decayed and there
[51:43] is much rubbish so that we are not able
[51:45] to build a wall so here because they're
[51:48] so busy guarding they couldn't continue
[51:51] the work on the city so they're being
[51:53] hindered in a way looking out for these
[51:55] enemies so then our adversary said they
[52:00] shall not know neither see till we come
[52:03] and amidst among them and slay them and
[52:05] cause the work to cease and it came to
[52:08] pass that when the Jews which dwelt by
[52:10] them came and they said unto us 10 times
[52:12] from all places when shall you return
[52:14] unto us they will be upon you therefore
[52:18] set I in the lower places behind the
[52:20] wall and on the higher places I even set
[52:23] the people after their families with
[52:25] their swords their spears and their
[52:28] bowls so they're really arming up here
[52:30] to keep her this enemy away from their
[52:32] work and I looked and rose up and said
[52:36] to the nobles and rulers and to the rest
[52:37] of the people be not afraid of them
[52:39] remember the Lord which is great and
[52:42] terrible fight for your brethren your
[52:45] sons and your daughters your wives and
[52:47] your houses and it came to pass when our
[52:50] enemies heard that it was known unto us
[52:52] and God had brought their counsel to
[52:54] naught then we returned all of us to the
[52:57] wall every one until his work they
[53:00] didn't even have the fight all they had
[53:02] to do was stand they had to get their
[53:05] weapons and stand on the watch and
[53:07] that's all it took to defeat the enemy
[53:10] in this instance God moved in and they
[53:12] realized there was a one-year force
[53:14] there than what they reckoned reckoned
[53:15] with and 16 says and it came to pass
[53:19] from that time forth that the half of my
[53:22] servants brought in the work and the
[53:24] other half held both the spears the
[53:27] shields the bowls and the heart and the
[53:30] Hobart Ian's now I looked up that word
[53:32] and that word is an old English word
[53:34] which means breastplate so you take that
[53:38] back to the armor the breastplate of
[53:40] righteousness so they have their sword
[53:43] which we know is the word and they're
[53:47] already girded with the breastplate and
[53:49] they have their shields so now half a
[53:53] mile walking after their brothers as
[53:54] they're working so now they're starting
[53:57] to work in unison here and the rulers
[54:00] were behind all the house of Judah
[54:02] everyone is coming together here they
[54:05] which build it on the wall and data bear
[54:07] burdens with those that they did every
[54:10] one of them had his hand brought in to
[54:12] work and was the other hand held a
[54:14] weapon for the builders everyone had his
[54:18] sword guarded by his side and so build
[54:20] it and he the sound of the trumpet was
[54:23] by me so now even in this instance they
[54:28] weren't hiding their swords or laying
[54:29] their swords aside they girded on their
[54:31] side did war even though it might have
[54:33] been in their way the warder sword they
[54:36] kept their word with them day in day out
[54:38] and it continued in their daily work
[54:40] they didn't just wear it occasionally
[54:43] for special occasions they took it with
[54:45] him to work we're not brothers or if
[54:48] even if sisters drawn today you take the
[54:50] word with you don't heart is behind
[54:53] something keep it out in plain sight and
[54:56] this is what helps keep the enemy back
[54:57] away from you
[54:59] we're not to keep it hidden in the
[55:02] market Abby's butter brown says you call
[55:06] it fanaticism well that's true
[55:08] I'll admit they got a lot of it but
[55:10] buzzer there's a real one there too
[55:12] that's right
[55:13] a real one there the devil throws every
[55:16] counterfeit he can right in the way to
[55:18] confuse you but if you don't think no
[55:20] more of God then get down read your
[55:22] Bible and pray and ask God then it goes
[55:24] to show you're not very interested in
[55:25] your soul move right on out there and
[55:28] say God I don't care how many old crow
[55:31] baits you would put out there I see your
[55:33] Bible says it and I'm determined that's
[55:35] right you promised it to me the seed of
[55:38] Abraham so that's what the watch is in
[55:43] the Old Testament but what is prayer I'm
[55:48] saying this now cuz we got some younger
[55:49] people here maybe this is for them most
[55:52] of basic definition I could think of
[55:54] prayer is talking to God it is not a as
[55:58] the world puts like as a meditation like
[56:00] a lot of people go to yoga or things
[56:02] that new should go to meditate
[56:03] there's the monks of Shaolin monks and
[56:06] all that they meditate
[56:07] when I talk about this type of
[56:09] meditation or state of mind or passive
[56:12] reflection like this is God Watauga he
[56:15] created us it's a direct address to God
[56:17] but it's not a one-way address it's also
[56:20] him talking back prayer is our primary
[56:26] way of communicating with God and in
[56:32] I'll just read this real quick to Barona
[56:34] her back up to one he said I will stand
[56:37] upon my watch and set me upon the tower
[56:39] and will watch to see what he will say
[56:42] unto me and what I shall answer when I
[56:45] am reproved there's a couple things
[56:48] about this one is first off let's go
[56:50] would reproved his kind of sounds of a
[56:52] harsh harsh word but it means to scold
[56:55] or correct usually gently or with kindly
[56:58] intent isn't that our God he kind of the
[57:02] master mold us into the His image we
[57:06] might think that is harsh but according
[57:08] to Scripture he's usually gently or
[57:11] to bring us in line with his perfect
[57:13] world we thank the Lord for that so it
[57:16] says here I will stand upon my watch and
[57:18] set me upon the tower if you check in
[57:21] Matthew Henry he refers this is he got
[57:24] in prayer so he in the first chapter if
[57:28] you understand this it said a bit of
[57:30] background in the time of Habakkuk the
[57:33] Chaldeans were really oppressing them
[57:36] they were taken over the country and
[57:38] there was no justice even in the first
[57:41] chapter Rachel was in torment he says
[57:45] therefore the laws slacked and judgment
[57:47] does never go forth for the wicked death
[57:50] can pass about the righteous therefore
[57:53] wrong judgment proceedeth so he's intent
[57:58] today judgment is not what it used to be
[58:01] used to be based on the scripture and
[58:03] morals that is all gone so he was
[58:08] burdened for the condition of the age
[58:10] there's a lot of violence and lack of
[58:13] godly justice but he also here he's
[58:17] signed and crime which takes us back to
[58:20] Ezekiel and God said mark those that
[58:22] sigh and cry so we want to thank God for
[58:27] for this leadership here
[58:30] get this backed off of it but Habakkuk
[58:36] was also very much aware of the hour he
[58:39] lived in he was looking at the signs
[58:41] that were present now he didn't
[58:43] necessarily make a doctrine office but
[58:46] he was aware of what was going on a lot
[58:48] of people today will also get caught up
[58:50] with the Pope Israel Russia we take note
[58:55] of these things and we thank God for
[58:56] them even the prophesied Israel's his
[58:59] timepiece but we don't make make it our
[59:02] sole purpose in watching we're supposed
[59:05] to watch dig into the word yes between
[59:10] the scriptures and in the revealed word
[59:12] this is what we watch this is will be
[59:14] truly find out where we are where we
[59:17] stand with God
[59:20] in catching and getting caught up with
[59:23] the era we live in we can get caught up
[59:26] with a lot of the attitudes of the world
[59:28] and get caught up in bitterness and
[59:30] resentment and what these things
[59:32] creeping it cuts off our communion with
[59:35] God and then you lose that comfort that
[59:38] joy and that assurance
[59:43] did I walk with God and you get caught
[59:45] up and then you have to go God has to
[59:47] correct you to drive these things out so
[59:50] you can come back in communion with him
[59:53] to have that comfort of communion with
[59:56] him every day it is a joy and a pleasure
[59:59] there are many things that are each and
[1:00:03] every one here can attest to that God
[1:00:04] has walked with them and they feel that
[1:00:07] absence when he draws away so when there
[1:00:17] he's talked about when he talks about
[1:00:18] here I will see what he will say unto me
[1:00:22] basic he he's prayed and if you read his
[1:00:26] prayer in Habakkuk 1 really he's
[1:00:29] complaining he sees all this stuff and
[1:00:32] he's just complaining the God God I'm
[1:00:34] seeing this like what time to go here
[1:00:37] but he been - he said he's just praying
[1:00:40] so now I'll wait and see what God says
[1:00:42] back to me he said and if he corrects me
[1:00:46] I'm gonna wait for that - he had a
[1:00:49] wonderful attitude there so he was
[1:00:53] paying attention to the word that he had
[1:00:55] for his day and he was still waiting for
[1:00:58] that still small voice and as a
[1:01:00] scripture says he sat upon his watch
[1:01:02] which means he fixed his thoughts on God
[1:01:05] he turned all of his attention on God he
[1:01:08] put it aside two things of world because
[1:01:10] he went off into the watchtower so he
[1:01:12] wasn't down in the city he was set aside
[1:01:15] the scripture talks about your prayer
[1:01:17] Plaza as your watchtower this is go and
[1:01:21] watch don't get satisfied your time
[1:01:24] study the Scriptures in the several
[1:01:28] places even in sobs David says he said I
[1:01:32] will bring the remembrance to songs that
[1:01:34] I saw he's looking back as past
[1:01:37] experiences and trying to find a word
[1:01:40] like it off he was searching trying to
[1:01:43] find out work where have I gone wrong
[1:01:46] why I've got why is God step back from
[1:01:48] me and as you know David had a lot of
[1:01:50] experiences to draw but we can't
[1:01:54] discredit our own experiences God has
[1:01:56] given me experiences that you guys might
[1:01:59] not go through and vice versa there's
[1:02:02] things that bother ayer keroh I believe
[1:02:04] his name is he's gone through that I
[1:02:05] won't have to face but that stuff God
[1:02:08] gives us to draw on when we have needeth
[1:02:14] but you also you also consult our
[1:02:17] experiences but there's also those that
[1:02:19] have gone before us that are among us
[1:02:21] older brothers that have got experiences
[1:02:24] brother Chad when you went to the
[1:02:27] emergency with his high blood pressure
[1:02:31] the experienced brother mark went with
[1:02:34] onlin stayed with them that's what it's
[1:02:36] about
[1:02:37] there's an experience natural types of
[1:02:39] spirit spiritual there's also brothers
[1:02:41] and sisters elders here that can direct
[1:02:44] us and help us in our time of need and
[1:02:46] as but what product last week about the
[1:02:50] shield the shield of faith in Roman
[1:02:53] formations is they held their shield
[1:02:56] over themselves or she loved faith but
[1:02:58] also those over in front of them this is
[1:03:00] not just for ourselves this is for our
[1:03:03] brothers and sisters right we're in this
[1:03:06] together if we think that we can get to
[1:03:10] heaven by ourselves or were deceived and
[1:03:12] the devil would like to keep us in that
[1:03:14] position to think that we got it all
[1:03:16] figured out a solider by himself don't
[1:03:20] know where to put that shield I'll put
[1:03:21] it in front to right left up down they
[1:03:25] don't have a clue but with the group
[1:03:27] they can fully cover themselves they can
[1:03:30] hold their shields over their daughter
[1:03:31] and their sister
[1:03:34] also another thing about the matthew
[1:03:39] henry says here about de scripture he
[1:03:42] says what perha ba-cock is basically
[1:03:44] saying he said I will look up I will
[1:03:47] look around to the left and right and
[1:03:49] down and I will look with him and watch
[1:03:52] and see what he will say unto me and
[1:03:54] we'll listen attentively to the words of
[1:03:56] his mouth and carefully observe the
[1:03:59] steps of his Providence so as a watchman
[1:04:04] the idea you would guess he would look
[1:04:07] forward to believe as high as part of a
[1:04:09] city and you would look forward to see
[1:04:12] if anything comin but there's also
[1:04:14] because there are walls they might come
[1:04:15] from the left or the right so we have to
[1:04:17] pay attention to our right hand to our
[1:04:18] left hand but they had looked down these
[1:04:21] are all pretty self-explanatory but one
[1:04:24] I thought was interesting when he said
[1:04:26] he said look within a lot of stuff in
[1:04:31] the Old Testament is tapped and take
[1:04:32] naturally so to look was thena attacked
[1:04:35] from within
[1:04:36] we're in Scripture and was there attacks
[1:04:39] from within the city there were two
[1:04:42] cities one was Babylon and that was June
[1:04:47] I do believe Nebuchadnezzar or Darius I
[1:04:51] forget the name sorry where they were
[1:04:53] besieged by the enemy and what the enemy
[1:04:56] did is behind the hills they cut off the
[1:04:58] water source while they were partying
[1:05:00] and they marched under the wall and
[1:05:02] attacked it from the thing that there
[1:05:05] was a failure of the watchman's notice
[1:05:07] that that's a pretty big change on
[1:05:09] sunland River stops there's a big
[1:05:12] warning book but they weren't attentive
[1:05:15] there are more paying attention to the
[1:05:17] party going on inside and they weren't
[1:05:20] doing their due diligence and standing
[1:05:23] on their watch and as you know Babylon
[1:05:26] fell greatly the other city died fell
[1:05:28] from attack with him was Jerusalem
[1:05:31] Jerusalem was when David attacked us and
[1:05:36] they had its sieged and don't could get
[1:05:39] in around but there was a river that
[1:05:41] went into it and Joab he went into the
[1:05:45] river he didn't
[1:05:46] they didn't divert you just smoking by
[1:05:48] night in the river and up to well and
[1:05:50] then he opened up the gates again if the
[1:05:54] watchman had been paying attention he
[1:05:56] monocot that but it was very subtle dat
[1:05:59] attack and that's what the devil try to
[1:06:01] do in the scripture so close have
[1:06:04] deceived very elect he slipped in with
[1:06:07] the water source which is a type of the
[1:06:08] work very small thing slippin and that
[1:06:13] city fell so he must be very careful and
[1:06:16] very vigilant in what we feed ourselves
[1:06:18] with entertainment why are we
[1:06:21] entertaining ourselves is there a small
[1:06:23] cedar discrepancy there even some
[1:06:26] message we might be listened to online
[1:06:27] is there something that's just a little
[1:06:29] off to Dell is trying to slip something
[1:06:30] in you must keep prayed up keep on
[1:06:33] watching it for ourselves
[1:06:35] but even as Nehemiah was saying for our
[1:06:38] wives and for our children for our
[1:06:39] houses the devil do anything you can to
[1:06:42] disrupt a church you disrupt your lives
[1:06:47] could be something small but you must
[1:06:50] must keep watch also he Matthew he Matt
[1:06:59] Matt you handle Aikens prayer - shooting
[1:07:01] shooting arrows but they were to use but
[1:07:03] I'll bring it forward into this time and
[1:07:05] users shooting a gun we know but a Bram
[1:07:07] talks about how the site's got to beyond
[1:07:11] but when you when you pray on something
[1:07:14] it's not just out of matter if you shoot
[1:07:16] and walk away you shoot and you keep
[1:07:19] looking at your target did you hit the
[1:07:21] target
[1:07:22] did you fatally wound it if you didn't
[1:07:25] readjust shoot again and keep watching
[1:07:29] until you hit that fatal ball prime
[1:07:33] example was a few years ago I was out
[1:07:35] moose hunting I had a moose there's only
[1:07:37] about 60 70 feet away clear shot I shot
[1:07:41] it knocked it down blew it off his feet
[1:07:44] immediately I kept guy went toward it
[1:07:46] and I lost sight of us when I got to
[1:07:49] where the Moose was a moose was gone if
[1:07:51] I had stayed back where I was I would
[1:07:54] have seen moose got off and been able to
[1:07:56] deliver another blow I would have got a
[1:07:57] nice
[1:07:58] as well I lost it and that's cuz I
[1:08:02] didn't stay and watch were and wait the
[1:08:05] time wait to see the result of my shot
[1:08:08] say it was prayer will you fire wait see
[1:08:12] what comes back if you don't pray again
[1:08:17] wait and see what comes back make sure
[1:08:20] you hit the mark and repeat you stay and
[1:08:23] observe as he as Habakkuk says to watch
[1:08:26] and see what happens the thing with also
[1:08:31] what's Habakkuk is and there goes over
[1:08:33] to Ezekiel is he was really growing than
[1:08:36] sign and God really puts us in a place
[1:08:40] and he will change our our circumstance
[1:08:44] to cause us to get into a point where we
[1:08:47] are growing and sign we're getting
[1:08:49] desperate
[1:08:50] and a good example of this if you if you
[1:08:54] want to turn us over to Jonah chapter 2
[1:09:10] in Jonah chapter 2 and we'll start with
[1:09:13] first wall then Jonah prayed unto the
[1:09:21] Lord his God out of the fish's belly and
[1:09:24] he said I cried by reason of mine
[1:09:27] unflinching unto the Lord he was in a
[1:09:32] pretty bad pickle as they would say he
[1:09:34] had nowhere else to go and he says by
[1:09:38] reason of mine affliction unto the Lord
[1:09:40] God put him in that place and he heard
[1:09:43] me out of the belly of Hell cried I and
[1:09:46] thou hurts my voice for thou has cast me
[1:09:50] into the deep into the midst of the Seas
[1:09:53] and the floods come past me about and
[1:09:55] all our bills and thy waves passed over
[1:09:58] me he really got desperate he really
[1:10:03] learned how to pray down in the belly of
[1:10:05] the whale that was me are you we get
[1:10:08] desperate ooh not a very pleasant
[1:10:11] picture to be catching yourself II see
[1:10:15] one drop down to verse 7 he said when my
[1:10:18] soul fainted with him yea I remembered
[1:10:20] the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee
[1:10:23] into thy holy temple they did observed
[1:10:27] lying vanities forsake their own mercy I
[1:10:30] really like this when your verse 9 he
[1:10:32] said but I will sacrifice unto thee with
[1:10:35] the voice of Thanksgiving
[1:10:37] who knew that Thanksgiving was a
[1:10:39] sacrifice he said and I will pray fact
[1:10:43] that I have vowed salvation is of the
[1:10:46] Lord that there really is really
[1:10:50] striking he had to save my team because
[1:10:53] the next verse says and the Lord spake
[1:10:54] unto the fish and environment amount he
[1:10:58] had to say I will make a sacrifice of
[1:11:00] Thanksgiving and I will pay that which I
[1:11:04] have vowed so he must have had some vows
[1:11:05] that he hadn't paid scripture is very
[1:11:07] clear if you vow something to God you
[1:11:10] better keep it
[1:11:12] so obviously from this one he hadn't he
[1:11:15] had some things left undone
[1:11:17] sometimes he wasn't sure about but God
[1:11:20] put him in a place where he he knew he
[1:11:22] had messed up and he'd better get it
[1:11:24] back on track we also go but if you go
[1:11:28] back on turn to it but if you also go
[1:11:30] back to the children of Israel in Egypt
[1:11:32] when they were in slavery they were also
[1:11:35] very comfortable in their situation but
[1:11:38] God changed their circumstance to the
[1:11:40] point where he could say to Moses I have
[1:11:42] heard their cries and I am calm down but
[1:11:46] he he couldn't calm down until he heard
[1:11:48] their cries it wasn't just one cry he
[1:11:51] had to hear all their cries he put the
[1:11:54] whole nation into a place where they all
[1:11:57] get desperate as a church they got
[1:11:59] desperate I said Lord we why we we
[1:12:02] remember our prep the promise you gave
[1:12:04] Moses we want to go to our promised land
[1:12:06] then he brought Moses on the scene got
[1:12:10] him prepared and then he went in and
[1:12:12] saved him also as butter Paul mentioned
[1:12:15] her when he was here about Hannah you
[1:12:18] know she was also God shut up her room
[1:12:20] she couldn't have a baby
[1:12:22] so her persecution was because of God
[1:12:24] but she had come to a point where she
[1:12:27] could sigh and groan was in her spirit
[1:12:30] and then she got her answer sometimes if
[1:12:34] it looks like your brother or sister is
[1:12:36] going through something well maybe God's
[1:12:38] putting them in a place where they can
[1:12:39] pray the right thing it's not a thing
[1:12:42] just to say a prayer
[1:12:43] you had to pray right what is it that
[1:12:47] God wants me to say then he can say all
[1:12:49] thank and that's right now you can get
[1:12:52] your answer Jesus in the garden there's
[1:12:56] also another one he also prayed to the
[1:12:59] point where he was in such agony as
[1:13:02] scripture says he was shedding as it
[1:13:03] were great drops of blood I don't know
[1:13:06] be you but I've never gone to that level
[1:13:08] of groaning or anguish of spirit but a
[1:13:11] must months pretty terrible but for him
[1:13:14] to say and the repeat his prayer because
[1:13:15] scripture says and he repeated it not my
[1:13:18] will but thine be done
[1:13:20] I prayed a debt you know that's our
[1:13:23] hearts cry no matter what it is we do
[1:13:26] even if it seems strange and unusual
[1:13:29] God's pretty good at the strange and
[1:13:31] unusual desperate us I think he's a
[1:13:34] perfectionist when it comes to that and
[1:13:38] it brings results for the kingdom of God
[1:13:41] so my prayer is that you're not my book
[1:13:44] may we be willing vessels there's many
[1:13:47] times reason when we hold back well God
[1:13:50] would have a blessing for someone down
[1:13:52] the road because of that one thing in Ex
[1:13:58] expectations Irv Bertram's said
[1:14:00] clergymen could you mark on your hands
[1:14:03] ten people tonight in this city that's
[1:14:05] sign and crying day and night for the
[1:14:08] wickedness and things that's done in the
[1:14:09] city does anybody in this audience know
[1:14:12] where you could put your fingers on five
[1:14:14] people there Sian cried day and night
[1:14:17] for the sins and things in the city
[1:14:19] well the Bible well now the Bible said
[1:14:22] set a mark upon those who sigh and cry
[1:14:24] for the abominations done in the city
[1:14:26] that's right no more burden for lost
[1:14:29] souls it's all gone we've joined church
[1:14:32] and settle down that's all that's
[1:14:33] necessary that's how we get sin is so
[1:14:36] sneaky it sneaks right up on you before
[1:14:39] you know it see that's the way it does
[1:14:41] it just grabs you like the old toboggan
[1:14:43] slide you used to be and it's got you
[1:14:45] the devil does that now brother let's
[1:14:48] get plumb back off his territory let's
[1:14:51] get back into God come right back to the
[1:14:54] altar rebuild the altar that's been torn
[1:14:55] down build up your home take them
[1:14:58] carrots off the table and old magazines
[1:15:00] and open up the Bible read the Bible and
[1:15:04] pray and just don't get down and say
[1:15:07] that's my family Mary and Joe and John
[1:15:10] and all of them get in bed no sir
[1:15:12] stay there with God you know that sound
[1:15:15] they used to sing there are times I'd
[1:15:17] like to be all along with Christ my lord
[1:15:19] I can tell them all my troubles all
[1:15:21] along that's what we need again that's
[1:15:24] them kind of meetings that's the kind of
[1:15:26] church that prays down the blessings of
[1:15:28] God I'm sure your pastor would
[1:15:30] appreciate every member become like that
[1:15:33] how would be if the church would just be
[1:15:35] like that and that's the beauty of a
[1:15:39] church it's a group where we got to be
[1:15:44] in harmony we had to be in yours
[1:15:46] there's things I do that some of you
[1:15:49] might not understand there's things you
[1:15:51] do but I don't I scratch my head but
[1:15:54] that's the beauty of it
[1:15:55] God didn't make me like you he made me a
[1:15:58] certain way to handle the things that I
[1:16:00] got to deal with but we still had to
[1:16:04] pray for each other I even though I
[1:16:08] don't have I don't have to understand
[1:16:09] all I know is God understands and you
[1:16:15] have to hold and because of this group
[1:16:17] in harmony whether it's here or in BC or
[1:16:20] India anywhere we still have to hold the
[1:16:23] shield or each other it's the same Holy
[1:16:25] Ghost scripture says in the unity of the
[1:16:29] faith we had to be in unity we have to
[1:16:33] be warm old young sisters brothers
[1:16:36] there's a reason we're here together
[1:16:38] there's a reason there sister Carol Rose
[1:16:40] went to the experiences she went through
[1:16:43] to help the body in the way she has I
[1:16:45] was really blessed by your testimonies
[1:16:47] sister there's one let you know is
[1:16:49] there's a little blessing to bring a
[1:16:54] little example last year I went to a bit
[1:16:59] of a I heard Todd there last year with
[1:17:05] my job there I knew I had to change jobs
[1:17:07] I had maxed out and so last main that
[1:17:09] got atomically you're gonna be getting a
[1:17:11] new job told me type of personality okay
[1:17:14] let's go I want it now and because I
[1:17:18] became discontent in my present
[1:17:20] circumstance and that created its own
[1:17:23] problems peace and contentment is a
[1:17:26] wonderful thing and so as I go through
[1:17:30] the year getting interviews with jobs I
[1:17:35] haven't got a sweet clue and they want
[1:17:36] me y'all to sell insurance to people I
[1:17:38] haven't got a clue better Jones I'm a
[1:17:41] machinist by trade I deal with metal I
[1:17:43] don't deal with insurance
[1:17:45] so as that was going on I was working a
[1:17:50] lot and as always once a year at least I
[1:17:53] burn in both ends and I get sick well I
[1:17:55] got sick in July and it was like a
[1:17:58] respiratory infection and to the point
[1:18:01] where they were doing chest x-rays I was
[1:18:03] on medication and paupers and last year
[1:18:08] around August time when we had to camp
[1:18:11] around that time it got really bad to
[1:18:14] the point were in the middle of the
[1:18:15] night I would wake up unable to breathe
[1:18:17] I couldn't breathe to use the puffer and
[1:18:21] I talking 20 seconds I'm talking over
[1:18:24] it's to two minutes so you're out of bed
[1:18:26] get out of the room so you can try to
[1:18:30] deal with this contort your body to try
[1:18:32] to force air into your lungs this was
[1:18:35] happened night after night and
[1:18:37] especially around the camp
[1:18:39] I'd be out on the picnic tables in
[1:18:41] kitchen trying to suck here it was a
[1:18:45] wonderful thing and so you really learn
[1:18:51] how to pray what do you feel like you're
[1:18:54] on death's door you're minutes away
[1:18:56] are you really pregnant all the
[1:18:59] frivolous things to complaints and you
[1:19:02] really get down to where you live and so
[1:19:09] God really dealt with me a lot there and
[1:19:11] over time like it wasn't a instant
[1:19:14] miracle but over time it slowly start to
[1:19:17] be able to breathe you know when you get
[1:19:19] to the point we were seeing stars you're
[1:19:22] pretty close to blacking out it's not a
[1:19:24] pleasant thing because then you get a
[1:19:25] fear of going to sleep because you know
[1:19:27] this is calm so you fight novice and the
[1:19:30] devil is really there to poke that and
[1:19:33] so you struggle to this and so by God's
[1:19:40] grace there over the next week or so
[1:19:42] you know this slowly started getting
[1:19:44] better I'm living waking up and it's
[1:19:45] only just a cough take the power for
[1:19:48] impact Abednego but it was only getting
[1:19:50] maybe three four hours sleep nights so I
[1:19:52] was getting really burnt out
[1:19:55] and in the middle of all this I'm
[1:19:57] looking for a job and pressure work was
[1:20:00] just wasn't good and then it's about the
[1:20:04] time and butterly okay I don't know what
[1:20:08] was said I wouldn't be able to tell you
[1:20:10] specifically one later what scripture or
[1:20:14] what he said but I came out of the
[1:20:16] medium with peace and contentment and it
[1:20:19] was just like a waterfall just falling
[1:20:21] over you a week or two later I get a
[1:20:24] call from my current boss
[1:20:26] looking for machinist okay well we'll
[1:20:30] talk about in a month you know you just
[1:20:32] do things kept get pushed back push back
[1:20:33] but I'll get over that infection in
[1:20:38] October with moose hunting this better
[1:20:42] Joe and when I go moose hunting I 1520
[1:20:48] Commodore walk in a daze nothing to me
[1:20:50] and I did that for three days and I
[1:20:53] think with Wednesday I bought I was
[1:20:56] brought up standing or your 1520
[1:20:59] climbers one day the next it's like
[1:21:01] flippers which I trouble go on 50 feet I
[1:21:04] hand him a license to put a joggers
[1:21:06] cherry license and I said you take it
[1:21:10] and I was like that for the rest of the
[1:21:12] week I had trouble come across the cabin
[1:21:13] and I developed some kind of skin
[1:21:16] infection
[1:21:18] so I couldn't walk got back got the
[1:21:22] doctor here's the medication you have to
[1:21:26] keep on keep on this so I did that so
[1:21:30] from November hoping to the beginning
[1:21:32] January I was on medication and all that
[1:21:35] for disinfection it would end the way
[1:21:38] there's added maintainable level but it
[1:21:40] never went away and then around
[1:21:43] Christmastime a few things happened and
[1:21:47] Lord brought a few things out and anyway
[1:21:52] I went to a communion and previous years
[1:21:56] are I ain't no meaning my wife we have
[1:21:57] received it received healing that's real
[1:21:59] communion purposes there's a blessing or
[1:22:01] a curse well I choose a blessing
[1:22:04] and I just enters another butter that
[1:22:08] pray for me that God had done something
[1:22:10] in his life and changed his outlook
[1:22:13] towards towards me and in that prayer I
[1:22:18] wouldn't pray desperate and this was
[1:22:21] hindering me I couldn't do my job right
[1:22:23] and all that went through communion God
[1:22:25] put so the two was prayed for each other
[1:22:27] and I went home and I told my wife I
[1:22:30] said I claimed it and from that day
[1:22:34] forward I I never touched any medication
[1:22:38] I wouldn't be at eight words to but just
[1:22:59] to find out later and the puzzle prayed
[1:23:01] for me because he had to change the
[1:23:04] attitude he felt his the first time you
[1:23:07] guys should pray for me with nothing
[1:23:10] between he was all appreciate over me
[1:23:24] when I was weak I used to be to her
[1:23:35] I used to be allergic to dogs I'm not
[1:23:48] allergic anymore all as a result of that
[1:23:51] prayer everything that I really fought
[1:23:57] with net has gone just like that but
[1:24:02] it's because of my brother how's this
[1:24:04] nurse does what this mean in harmony in
[1:24:11] unity
[1:24:18] that's probably gotta come to RM says
[1:24:29] hearing not question answer while
[1:24:32] happiness shadow
[1:24:33] he's not don't you like to have a real
[1:24:35] Bible Church a real Church where all the
[1:24:38] spiritual gifts were set in order
[1:24:40] everything making manifest just exactly
[1:24:43] should wouldn't that be wonderful now
[1:24:47] you're going to have to sacrifice not
[1:24:50] money you're gonna have to sacrifice
[1:24:52] while some of your own ideas you're
[1:24:56] gonna have to sacrifice some time in
[1:25:00] prayer yeah you're gonna have to
[1:25:02] sacrifice maybe a stubborn will to break
[1:25:07] down in humility the whole Christian
[1:25:12] move is sacrificial he that will follow
[1:25:20] me let him deny himself take up his
[1:25:23] cross and follow me daily isn't that
[1:25:27] right how often do you have to sacrifice
[1:25:31] every day Paul said he died daily every
[1:25:36] day he died that's everything if there's
[1:25:43] anything Dartmouth
[1:25:51] [Applause]
[1:25:56] yeah too many times we think that we got
[1:26:02] a little sick or something oh wow
[1:26:04] I'll just take the medication I no need
[1:26:07] to bother God about that
[1:26:08] and her one brother says it what are you
[1:26:10] saving up your prayers for when you get
[1:26:12] cancer or something
[1:26:18] but it's true bring everything to God
[1:26:22] everything you start training but the
[1:26:25] little things so what you do get hit by
[1:26:27] big day
[1:26:28] you're already trained you know how to
[1:26:30] handle it over in Philippians Africa
[1:26:34] turn to Philippians 4

[1:27:35] not fret or have any anxiety about
[1:27:38] anything but in every but in every
[1:27:41] circumstance in it everything by prayer

[1:27:58] peace shall be yours that tranquil state
[1:28:02] of a soul assured of its salvation
[1:28:05] through Christ and so fearing nothing
[1:28:08] from God and being content with its
[1:28:11] earthly lot of whatever sort that is
[1:28:14] that peace which transcends all
[1:28:17] understanding shall garrison and mount
[1:28:21] guard over your hearts and minds in
[1:28:24] Jesus Christ hallelujah thank the Lord
[1:28:29] for that that peace shall be yours and

[1:28:45] Christ Jesus and lucas' blessed are
[1:28:48] those servants whom the Lord who when he
[1:28:50] cometh shall find watching verily I say
[1:28:53] unto you that he shall gird himself and
[1:28:56] make them to sit down to meet and will
[1:28:59] come forth
[1:29:00] and serve them so for watching God's
[1:29:03] gonna come and draw a nice draw near to
[1:29:05] us and sustain us and pick us up and
[1:29:09] encourage us keep fighting you know this
[1:29:12] is not a cakewalk
[1:29:13] no this is this is a battle at the end
[1:29:16] of the day our armory is gonna be beat
[1:29:19] up we're every day but you got
[1:29:24] to keep it prepared stay in prayer stay
[1:29:28] watching dig in
[1:29:31] in victory day but Bram says you say I
[1:29:34] have had so many trials brother branham
[1:29:37] I've just been drugged from pillar to
[1:29:39] post haven't I just told you that that's
[1:29:43] God to drag you from pillar to post
[1:29:45] because he trusted you you won't fail
[1:29:49] him will you you might have fell you
[1:29:52] might have made a mistake but you won't
[1:29:53] fail him will you
[1:29:54] you're raised up again like a real
[1:29:56] soldier grip the sword and come forward
[1:29:59] again remember a complete victor and
[1:30:03] single your focus on Jesus Christ he's
[1:30:06] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:30:08] someday with your eye single looking not
[1:30:12] distracted single focused on Christ
[1:30:15] he'll come from the sky with a shout the
[1:30:18] voice of the Archangel the dead in
[1:30:20] Christ shall rise and these mortal
[1:30:22] bodies shall take on a more more
[1:30:23] immortality and we shall be with them
[1:30:26] forever till then watch and pray but
[1:30:32] pretty simple
[1:30:34] there's nothing complex about it all
[1:30:36] pretty simple watch and pray the
[1:30:41] scripture says and these you have the
[1:30:43] words of eternal life that's eternal so
[1:30:47] just watch and pray God will take care
[1:30:49] of the rest if you need changing as you
[1:30:51] watch and pray he will create that
[1:30:53] change he'll put you in a situation
[1:30:55] where you're forced to if you if you're
[1:30:57] doing if I'm willingly I pray that we
[1:30:59] are willing vessels it's not a pleasant
[1:31:02] thing to go through it stubbornly
[1:31:03] even scripture talks about stubbornness
[1:31:06] has been idolatry and God don't like
[1:31:09] idolatry
[1:31:10] I'd rather not be accumulative that
[1:31:12] y'all even as he says about the Potter
[1:31:15] you know clay isn't saying as a part of
[1:31:17] why have you made me thus God has a
[1:31:20] reason he made you one way and he made
[1:31:24] you another he said over and God keeps
[1:31:31] his word
[1:31:32] he's a butter we laid to pass the
[1:31:34] borders of mercy until there's nothing
[1:31:36] left but judgment but the righteous
[1:31:39] bilasa had to be punished with the
[1:31:41] unrighteous God will come and Jesus will
[1:31:43] redeem his church and will go up in the
[1:31:45] air to meet him and it'll be far beyond
[1:31:47] any bombs or troubles and will be
[1:31:49] protected during that time so children
[1:31:52] back to your God quickly don't tangle
[1:31:55] with the world for anything stay out of
[1:31:58] this modern world stay out of these
[1:32:00] modern theologies just look to the Lamb
[1:32:03] of God read your Bible and pray all the
[1:32:06] time
[1:32:07] don't be weary be rejoicing happy for
[1:32:11] the redemption of the church is drawing
[1:32:13] nigh when we shall see him who died for
[1:32:16] us I'm looking forward to that day I
[1:32:21] pray that each and every one of us are
[1:32:23] to that we're willing to die to anything
[1:32:25] that stands between us and that moment I
[1:32:29] hate to miss it
[1:32:30] just because I wouldn't die to something
[1:32:32] I hate to get lessened reward because I
[1:32:35] was too stubborn to give up something so
[1:32:41] as we know watching is reading the Bible
[1:32:44] the message message points us back to
[1:32:47] this just dig in no matter how big or
[1:32:52] small of Revelation might be matter was
[1:32:55] on the same level as the parable of the
[1:32:57] talents
[1:32:57] just somebody gave 10 some 5 and someone
[1:33:00] I just prayed it whatever talent God
[1:33:02] gives me that put it to his use for the
[1:33:05] kingdom of God yeah I did it we'll get a
[1:33:07] root on increase by his glory that's all
[1:33:11] I ask is it whatever God's purpose is
[1:33:13] for me waiting for my family that is
[1:33:17] used for his glory
[1:33:18] hey even even the little child can
[1:33:22] correct something and the child can
[1:33:24] change a situation to a word fitly
[1:33:26] spoken and not even realize that they're
[1:33:28] in the perfect will of God you know I've
[1:33:31] seen to what children can do but around
[1:33:33] McConnell was testified when his
[1:33:35] daughter corrected him and a visitor
[1:33:37] when you're visiting young God's in
[1:33:39] control we're gonna be sensitive to
[1:33:42] these things and how do we do that we
[1:33:45] take him to answer to every one of our
[1:33:47] problems even sister Priscilla with her
[1:33:50] with her problem and the rest of us we
[1:33:52] get our different situations so I'm just
[1:33:54] getting old the answer to what
[1:33:56] everything is here everything there's
[1:34:00] nothing that you can get from a
[1:34:02] psychologist or from theology in about
[1:34:04] in the world it's all right here
[1:34:07] everything as David said I will check
[1:34:11] with those experiences and those that
[1:34:13] are experienced the reason God got a
[1:34:16] shepherd or there's a reason why elders
[1:34:19] hold an important place in the body they
[1:34:23] have those experiences that can help us
[1:34:25] you know even the young or you know do
[1:34:28] y'all can teach something they go
[1:34:31] through things my kids are going through
[1:34:33] things now that I didn't go through when
[1:34:34] I was a kid you know there's that many
[1:34:37] electronics today then I didn't have
[1:34:38] when I was young and I'm not that old
[1:34:42] technology's moving very fast
[1:34:46] getting up there so as we whine down
[1:34:53] here if you just turn to psalms 32
[1:35:16] zombi to verse five he says I
[1:35:21] acknowledged my sin unto thee and mine
[1:35:23] iniquity have I not hid I said I will
[1:35:27] confess my transgressions unto the Lord
[1:35:29] and thou forgave us the iniquity of my
[1:35:32] sin for this shall everyone that is
[1:35:35] godly pray unto thee in a time when thou
[1:35:37] mayst be found whose me may s be found
[1:35:41] surely in the floods of Great Waters
[1:35:43] they shall not come nigh unto thee thou
[1:35:46] art my hiding place thou shalt preserve
[1:35:48] me from trouble
[1:35:49] thou shall compass me about with songs
[1:35:52] of deliverance I prayed it as our desire
[1:35:56] today if we would just be on watch and
[1:35:59] pray that God will become our hiding
[1:36:03] place he will preserve us from trouble
[1:36:06] God's not a grandfather he's just not
[1:36:09] gonna give it without us doing something
[1:36:11] me it seems pretty simple to read your
[1:36:14] father and pray and from there you'll
[1:36:17] get the revelation what your next step
[1:36:18] is and then what the next step is as it
[1:36:22] says your footsteps is possession well
[1:36:24] let's start stepping you know when
[1:36:28] you've done everything you can maybe
[1:36:30] your brother has a prayer all your
[1:36:31] sister has a prayer to help you make
[1:36:32] that next time it is not all about me or
[1:36:36] you this is about Christ and everything
[1:36:39] give him thanks it says in Luke 21 he
[1:36:44] says watch you therefore and pray always
[1:36:45] that ye may be accounted worthy to
[1:36:48] escape all these things that shall come
[1:36:51] to pass and to stand before the Son of
[1:36:53] man I pray that that would be every one
[1:36:57] of us here today that we will be able to
[1:36:59] stand before the Son of man
[1:37:02] Amen I want to thank the Lord for his
[1:37:04] presence here that's all that I have
[1:37:07] there for today so that's put a mark any
[1:37:10] musicians if they could come
[1:37:12] I just pray to God would just take this
[1:37:15] and bless us towards her listen to our
[1:37:17] hearts and maybe spoke to someone today
