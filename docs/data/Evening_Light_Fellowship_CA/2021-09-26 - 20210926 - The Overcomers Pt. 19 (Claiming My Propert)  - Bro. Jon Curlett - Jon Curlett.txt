restoration and lord we want to bow ourselves before your word this morning lord we want to claim the shed blood of calvary for our sins lord that you have forgive us our shortcomings lord where we've done what we ought not to and where we've not done what we ought to lord we pray forgiveness lord give us another chance help us to do your will lord to not only do your will but do it your way lord we pray your grace for your people now grace to me lord set me aside speak lord to your bride this morning lord not only in this service lord but in each place lord where the bride will gather this morning lord we pray that your presence will be there to saturate thirsting souls we pray grace to us now heavenly father in your name we ask it amen amen thank you musicians that'll be it this morning if you turn your scriptures to joshua chapter 14 this morning i'm in joshua chapter 14. i pray for my voice is still a little bit rough from wednesday night but trust in the lord's grace this morning amen and good to see each one here in service this morning brother mcnell good to have him back with us amen and the different ones and then trusting that it'll be a blessing just before we start i want to say thank you to brother matt for last service we had some technical issues and sometimes it could be frustrating for us on the user's end but imagine how much more frustrating it is when you've got to sit there and work through it while the minister's preaching and you want to be listening to the word and you're not able to do it amen i've been on i've been where he's been and you can walk away and things are exactly as you left them and yet somehow they're not working this morning or this evening so i just appreciate that brother matt and men appreciate the sacrifice and the time that you put into it not just in service but certainly outside of it as well and then joshua chapter 14 and verse 6 says then the children of judah came unto joshua in gilgal and caleb the son of jefuna the canozite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and thee in kadesh barnea forty years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadesh barnea to spy out the land and i brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god and moses swear on that day saying surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou hast holy followed the lord my god amen may god bless bless the reading of his word you may be seated this morning amen we're coming down to the final stretch on the series on the overcomers and as far as i've been led this will be the last i want you to hear the land wherein to he went and his seed shall possess it so the difference in caleb and joshua is not who their mommy and daddy was it was not who their ministry was it was not on the signs and miracles they saw but the scripture says they had another spirit within them now the holy spirit wasn't given yet the holy spirit wasn't given but yet there was something inside of them that latched on to the word of god and said we are more than able to take the country amen if god is for us who can be against us there was something in them as i spoke of last service that was tuned in to hear the word of god and that it would light a fire inside of them and bring courage and faith to their bodies into their lips so that they would speak what the word said and move forward to make it manifest amen they were tuned to a frequency that nobody else was tuned to without the holy spirit and it goes to show the predestination of god in those men's lives that they could hear the word and move to put it into action when everybody else fell back and then hundreds of thousands of people maybe millions of people step back and only two went forward in the promise of the word amen brother braham says this he says speaking he says they are like the children of israel who came out of egypt and stopped short of the promised land now those children of israel left egypt about 2 million strong they all journeyed together they all saw the same miracles of god they all partook of the same manna and water from the smitten rock they all followed the same cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night but only two reached the promised land only two were true or real believers that's serious that's serious only two he says out of a million two million strong were true believers he says that is correct because the world tells us that the rest died because of unbelief unbelief means they didn't believe that's why he says joshua and caleb were the only true believers is because they believe believers believe if you don't believe you're not a believer that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter in then since that is so and only two entered then the rest were not true believers what made the difference he says two stayed with the word and when the hearts of the ten spies failed at kiddish barnea joshua and caleb did not stagger for they believed the word and said we are more than able to take the land they knew they could why because god said i have given you the land that's the only basis they have was god had said i have given you the land after all those israelites saw of the power and goodness and deliverance of god they did not enter into rest which is a type of the holy ghost so you can see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the work the spirit of god the spirit be around it be affiliated be in the presence of it and yet never receive the spirit that's doing the very things that you're cert that you're enjoying in the in the presence in the services amen you can be around it but not have it and he says there's only two out of a million that went all the way into the promised land of that generation amen there was something inside those two men that identified with the word and no matter how fantastic no matter how illogical no matter how supernatural it seemed they were more than happy to step out and say we'll lead the charge we can take the land come with us and we'll get this done amen they were built to receive it and not only that they were built to live it out amen not just built to receive it we can sit here all day long and we can listen to the preaching of the word you can go home you can turn on the tapes you can open your bible and you can say i'm receiving i'm receiving i'm receiving but that what it comes in must come out at some point amen we cannot just sit here and receive receive receive anything that receives something that's going to have an effect on it it's going to grow it's going to expand or it's going to put it out in the end amen amen we're not built to just here we're not built to just listen we are built to express the word of god amen that's the thing that we're looking for we're in the time of the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god amen numbers 13 says and he's speaking now of the spies and what they did and where they went and it says and they ascended by the south and came into hebron where ahman and sheshai and talmide the children of anak were now hebron was built seven years before zone in egypt so the children of anak are giants and they are the giants in the land these are the big boys these are the bad boys these are the ones you don't mess with when they're coming down the road you walk to the other side and then you don't mess with the sons of anak amen they're the best of the best they're the biggest they're the fearsome group of warriors in canaan they're the family that nobody wants to touch nobody wants anything to do with the sons of anec it says now the spies they came into the brook of eshkol and cut down so the brook of eshkol is just by hebron and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bare it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs and then so the ten spies are walking through hebron and they come to this brook and they see these amazing grapes there and this bunch of grapes this cluster of grapes is so big that they have to tie it by the vine onto a large stick and put it between two men now i've never seen a bunch of grapes that big there's something special about a bunch of grapes that's so big that it takes two men to carry you know we go and we take a bunch of grapes from costco or something and it's about this big okay i can carry 10 or 15 of those no problem these grapes are so big it takes two men to carry them amen and i don't think it's by by happenstance that they find them by a brook by a place of clear running water where the word is flowing amen where something is planted and the word is bringing it forth in a way that causes supernatural growth that this is the land of milk and honey that this is showing the promises of god it's by a brook but it's also in a place that is surrounded by great giants and i know i've said it before amen that the greatest promises of god are surrounded by what the greatest demons that satan has because he doesn't want you to get the victory and the greater the promise the greater the barrier that he's put in front of you amen so nothing's going to be easy you say i want something big from god get ready for the big battle and then get ready to be putting it up putting on the armor of god and getting into battle and this is not going to be the battle of a moment this is not going to be no now i lay me down to sleep and you wake up in the morning and you've got the victory amen but this is going to be a long torn out drawn-out affair because the greatest weapons that satan has are going to be put up against you to try and keep you from taking the land amen the biggest grapes are surrounded by the biggest men in this case amen but speaking of being by that brook and this is something brother brahm said it just caught my attention he says we are planted in christ jesus the inexhaustible fountain of life and we just drink and push and drink and let me continue and push and drink and push and drink and push and drink until what we are growing bigger than anything else that is around us amen where we show forth the fruits of the life that's come inside of us we show forth what's inside of us in the first place and it's bringing now the evidence of what we've been feeding on amen drink and push drink and push everything that we need when we're filled with the holy spirit every healing everything that we have need of in life's journey is given to us right then but just drink and push drink and push he says it's all your personal property just drink that's all look and live that's all can you imagine those grapes saying i'm by the water but i'm unsure if the the waters are going to continue so i'm going to hold back now and just keep just going to take the little bit i want for today in case that it's going to be gone later we don't want to use too much today and then he says this is the inexhaustible fountain of life drink and push drink and push pretend like this is the only day you've got to drink and drink and drink and drink amen don't look to tomorrow don't worry about tomorrow drink for today until something's pushing out of your life amen amen amen when we look at the things that we're facing we see these big giants around us know that whatever you're going through on the other side whatever's on the other side is well worth the battle amen every scar every pain every humbling every sacrifice every tear you shed every difficulty we go through the thing on the other side the reward is far better than the than the difficulties we go through amen as the song says it will be worth it all right when we see jesus life's trials will seem so small amen when we're looking to the word and we're fighting we're and we're trusting god and we're wondering where he's at just know he's there and then he's there but we've got to push him and we've got to take over what he has given to us each one amen caleb speaking now in joshua 14 again he says 40 years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadesh barnea to spy out the land and i brought him word again as it was in my heart what was in caleb's heart what was in caleb's heart was the word of god amen and the word of god said this was a land flowing with milk and honey it did not say it was a land full of giants it did not say it was a land that was difficult to take it said it was a land flowing of milk and honey and i've given it to you so when he walks into the land his eyes he has rose tinted glasses but they're not rose tinted their word tinted and so when he goes in he's saying i'm looking for the proof that matches the promise and everything else i won't see so when he goes in what is he looking at he's saying i'm seeing a land flowing with milk and honey i'm seeing it full of fruits and i'm seeing exactly the promise of god and though he sees the giants he dismisses him because they do not line up with the word of god all he's talking about is how this lines up with the word of god and he puts everything else to the side the other people were going in with the eyes of flesh and saying this is going to be difficult because the word wasn't in their heart but if the words in our heart then we call everything that lines up with the word as evidence and everything else as if it does not exist amen we know it's there but we say it doesn't matter amen we do not have blinders on our eyes to the things that we're facing amen we're facing great trials we're facing great great demons in our lives we're facing great influences of satan it is not that they don't exist it is not that we say they aren't existing it is not that we're saying they're not big but we're looking to the word of god that says you are more than conquerors amen that i have given you the land and that's what we are keeping our eyes focused on and that's what our confession is is what he has put in our hearts which is the word of god quickened by the holy spirit amen luke 6 45 says a good man remember they said to jesus good master he says there's none good only god okay you've got to have god in you to be a good man and a good woman amen let's not leave the sisters out of it a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good so let me put it this way a godly man out of the godly treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is godly can i say it that way because if it's good it's of god which means it's godly amen but what an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh as well you can't you can say all day long on this or i'm that or i believe this or i believe that but if you want to know what's on the inside of you look at the words you're saying amen and if you look at the words you're speaking do they line up with the word do they reflect the word or let me make it easy are they the word amen if you speak the word now you can have confidence otherwise you have to run it through the filter of the word on a regular basis but if you can speak the word in the things that you're doing then you know that that's the holy spirit working inside of you because out of the inside of your heart if the word's in there that's what's going to come out every time continuing with caleb he says nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed my god and god acknowledged that and moses swear on that day saying surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou hast holy followed the lord my god. what did he do he kept the word in front of him at all times and he says that's what i'm going to confess is the word of god every time he didn't deviate to the to the right he didn't deviate to the left he said i'm sticking with the word of god and my evidence will be based on what the word of god says about what i'm seeing and what i'm going through amen he says but now the lord hath kept me alive as he said these 40 and five years so he's 85 years old now it's been 40 years since god gave him the promise it's been 40 years since he walked through hebron it's been 40 years since he cut down the biggest cluster of grapes the world has ever known he says even since the lord spake this word unto moses while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day four score and five years old yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now remember when we spoke about david they went in before the lord and then they came out and led the people he says i can still go in before god get his will and come out and lead the people to victory and nothing has changed since i was 40 until i'm 85. age doesn't matter here it's according to faith amen david was perhaps 15 years old when he defeated goliath and now we've got caleb at 85 years old defeating the giants that came before him amen age doesn't matter in this it's according to your faith amen that's what's giving him strength here now god has given him physical strength to do it he's still got to be able to wield a sword and hold up his shield in these different things but it is according to faith that caleb's standing here and saying i'm ready to go get my promise and nothing has left my body's as good as it was can you imagine from 40 to 85 years old and you're still as strong that's a man that's a man that has not aged amen now we look at those scriptures and these but i'm just little old me i'm not caleb i'm not david and some of us are some of us aren't amen sometimes we say i'm just a regular christian listen this is what a regular christian looks like amen it is by faith it is not by strength it is not might it's not by intellect it's not by education but it is by faith in the word of god that we overcome this is what a regular christian looks like amen and you say well i'm not someone they could write scripture about listen scripture has been written about us we can look in the word of god and we can see what it says about the end time believer so you're in there the question is will you believe what it says about you brother brown says this he says when you accept god's promise being your personal property then you'll lean on his bosom and you're nursing every day strength now he's talking about a baby here this is a baby in christ so you say well i'm just a baby in christ let's listen to what he says about a baby in christ when the cancer once eats you up where tb has withered you away where the affliction has caught you satan's been into your house and crippled you and left you that way from a fever or something but each day you're leaning on his everlasting arms with your head upon his bosom nursing from the word nursing from the word and notice not only that but the baby who's fretting and upset things are not good the baby's sick your mothers will know about this when the baby's sick while it's nursing way before it's well it's satisfied while it's nursing you mothers will know this anyone that's had a child will know when it nurses it settles down doesn't it as soon as it latches on to the mother it's where it's supposed to be and it's getting strength it's getting healing it's getting deliverance from whatever it is that's holding it back and it settles in because it's in the comfort and it's receiving the strength that it has need of he says and every believer every believer strong weak doesn't matter every believer every man that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those who diligently seek him and every believer coming to god when he accepts god's provided weigh his sacrifice as he leans upon the bosom of god to trust for his healing salvation whatever it might be he's satisfied he don't jump about from pillar to post not tossed about by every wind of doctrine but he's satisfied god gave the promise i've accepted it that settles it so i'm satisfied just right here amen can we say amen to that i'm satisfied just right here that god said it i believe it and i'm trusting it to come to pass amen but let's walk away from the great heroes of the faith for a second let's go to the weaker heroes of the faith yet a hero still let's look at sarah in hebrews 11 11 it says through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised where is sarah's strength she has none she needs strength she has no strength but it says by faith like i said your faith is what determines the outcome not your strength not your skill not your gift it is your faith in the word of god amen and in your weakness in your body yet great faith can bring great results amen sarah by faith received strength she didn't even have strength she couldn't even have a child when she was young it's not just that she was barren it's that she lacked the strength to bring it to full term sarah's body was not built to have a child that's how deep this miracle is she wasn't built to have a child she didn't have it in her to have a child whatever it was her body wouldn't produce a child and so when she comes here and she needs a body change sarah needs a body change she doesn't just need strength to have a child at 90 years old at the tender age of 90. amen but she needs a body change just to have this child and she receives it in her flesh so much so that when her husband forsakes the word of god and goes into another land the king looks at her as a 90 year old and says i want her for my wife over all the 21 year olds that's the kind of body change sarah got yeah by faith by faith by faith amen sarah made lots of mistakes on her path but yet by faith amen and god gave it to her in the end amen if that's our what's our excuse after that what's our excuse she couldn't have children starting to finish she needed a body change and yet she she had faith and she believed it and at 90 years old she got the promise amen what's our excuse brothers branham says and now from all the redemptive blessings that jesus died for is everyone your personal property you believers it's only for believers the only thing you have to do is just believe it accept it and call it yours like i said this is the selfish part mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine yours too but mine mine mine mine it is mine this priceless treasure amen when a man is born again of the spirit of god god gives him a checkbook that'll last him through all through life's journey there's no limit on this one and at the bottom of each check has got jesus name signed to it and you just fill it out for any redemptive blessing it's yours all ready paid for he says now surely you're not afraid that it won't be cashed if you're afraid you just hold the book in your pocket now in those days it was a checkbook today we'd have a debit card a debit card attached to an account now if somebody gave me a debit card and said whatever you need you can put on this card what is it that will keep me from using it i guarantee you if i believe that person i'm going to use that card for everything everything that i face every need that i have if he says it's for my needs i'll use it for my needs and i know he'll never reject it then if i believe him i'll use that card every time but the only thing that would stop me from doing it is if i don't want to go through the embarrassment of having that card rejected that i'm in the store and i run up a thousand dollar costco bill and i go to tap it or swipe it and that gets rejected that's the only reason i do it is if i didn't believe that there was money waiting behind that account to satisfy the needs that i'm putting on it it's the only thing that would do it amen if i was more worried about my humiliation my embarrassment of having to say i'm sorry i can't pay for all of this now that's the only thing that would hold me back and that's what brother i'm saying the only thing keeping you back from claiming the redemptive blessings of god is because you're afraid and that's why you keep the book in your pocket amen take us back to the scripture first john 4 says there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear had torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us amen if there is fear then god is not in operation amen brother joe shared this with me this week and it really struck me and he said and this is again brother branham he says and no matter what you say the days of miracles pass god don't do this and god don't do that you might as well just save your breath if that's what's in your mind if that's what's in your mouth don't even come to god what's the point you don't believe him he says i love him and i believe him and i take him at his word catch that love him believe him take him at his word now you can say i love him and i believe him but will you take him at his word that's really the question we ask so that settles it that's all god said so and if you can get to a place where you love him it'll cast out the fear that you have that he won't keep his word amen fear is never of god there is a godly fear and that is a respect amen that when you come into the presence of god that you bow your head that you are humble that you are submitted to the word amen we don't walk into the presence of god cocky and arrogant do we but we walk in because he has invited us to come in amen and there is a respect that comes there but we do not walk in fearful of our lives fearful of rejection fearful of what defeat amen if those are the things that are going through your mind then you need a greater revelation of god's love in your life amen why because defeat is not of god right depression is not of god right loss is not of god right there is no variance there's there's no variableness there's no shadow of turning in god god is solid god is continuous he is consistent he doesn't change and so he's not going to be one way one day and one day and then the next day he's different amen he stays the same throughout so with that variance is satan working satan's trying to get you to look at him a different way to think that something you've done has changed god nothing changes god the only thing that changes is you and your relationship with him but he doesn't change it's you that's having to do the changing here amen but the brahm says it's a finished work but you've got to accept it as your own personal property it's a love gift a love gift that's why we tie it back to love is because if you know that god loves you and the reason you know he loves you is because he's put his life inside of you because that's what a husband does to a wife that he loves as he puts what himself inside of her right he consummates the marriage that's the expression of love physically so it is with god there is a love gift that god has given you but he would still be the same in his power to manifest himself god working through him he works through his church just like he did through his son he works through his church just like he did his son he says now our kinsmen redeemer has handed the seven seal book of redemption from the original owner when we lost it at the garden of eden through adam it went back to the original owner but there's been a poacher on the land a squatter and that satan he's come over he's a poacher the earth doesn't belong to him it belongs to god but he's a poacher and a squatter he says it's the title deed of our redemption that's what he's saying was opened under those seven seals this seven seal book it's the title deed he says you wait until we get into those seals he breaks the seals and reveals now listen to this he says gives us his inheritance gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsmen redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it to himself he gives it back to the people that's his love for us as he takes what is his alone and he says no i've got a bride and i'm going to share it with her that she is a part of me and because of that we are what joint heirs with christ amen everything that he has redeemed he says i've given back to my bride amen and so we do not dwell with god and then dwell in gloom and darkness and shame and fear and despair why because we are a coheir with him by his choosing not by ours and he's placed us in a position of faith and light and love and so if we're in the presence of god if we're feeding on the word then we should have that we should have that clarity of purpose and direction in our life because where god is there is light and light always makes manifest it always shows us it always reveals things to us and so we've got this constance of god working in our life to do what show more of him express more of him in our lives amen and then what happens is he drops in and he opens a light in a portion of your life and he gives you a revelation he says this is for you my son this is for you my daughter specifically this is a love gift for you now somebody else could get healing but there's going to be a day where he drops into your heart the revelation that i've healed you as well he's going to say this is for you it's not just a generic scripture that by his stripes we are healed it's by his stripes i am healed and that's the revelation that he drops into our hearts amen brother braham says now what is divine healing does it mean that now that we have to wait till tomorrow night to be healed no sir do i have to come to the church do you have to come to the church to be prayed for do you have to come to the church to have something cast out of you do you have to come to church for deliverance no there's a spirit here to do that amen and that's the holy spirit working in believers but you don't have to he says no sir the moment you believe god and accept it as your personal property it's finished right then now you can come in and you can be prayed for you can say lord give me faith give me strength that has nothing to do with it but he says the moment you accepted it as your personal property it's finished right then that's right when was i healed brother branham i was saved last week i was saved the night before last 10 years ago no you were saved 1900 years ago when jesus died for you at calvary and every redemptive blessing that god has for you jesus said at the cross it is finished everything is done paid for that's why you don't have to march up all cocky and tough and demanding but rather to just walk in and start writing the check and saying lord i have need of healing lord i have need of deliverance lord i have need of wisdom lord i have need of direction lord i have need of discernment lord i have need of strength lord i have need of patience lord i have need of joy amen and what it's coming from the inexhaustible fountain of life that's planted right that you're planted right next to and you just remember drink and push yes write it out drink it push it drink it push it and let him work in it amen amen you don't have to march up like that but you do have to believe you do have to believe you have to go up with a heart of faith with a mouth of faith and say lord i believe look at that little woman amen that said if i can only touch the hem of his garment lots of people touched jesus that day peter said to him lord lots of people have touched you but he says no somebody touched me let's look at the scripture in matthew 9 he says and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him and touched him and touched the hem of his garment for she said within herself she came with purpose you ever see i know nobody has a tv and nobody looks at things online but did you ever see a celebrity or royalty coming through now you'd never touch royalty these days they'd shoot you down but you see a celebrity somewhere and you see people and what are they doing leaning over the barriers they just want to say i touched tom cruise right i touched tom cruise everybody's doing that they're thronging around them right i touched jesus now that guy everybody's talking about i touched him yesterday that's not what we're here for we're not here for celebrity amen but she comes with a different purpose she says if i may but touch his garment i shall be whole but jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and the woman was made whole from that hour a man like sarah she had a work done in her body that had been constant something had to change in one touch of his garment and she was changed for the rest of her life she had burned all her money on doctors and physicians she tried every healer that came along and nobody could do it and she touched the hem of his garment she didn't even touch his body she just touched the clothing he was wearing and she was healed instantly what healed her luke 8 says then jesus said somebody had touched me for i perceive that virtue has gone out of me what's virtue virtue is strength he says i got weak we saw that in the in the ministry of our prophet and then when god was working through him and a gift was operating what happened was he got weak strength went out of him amen what is it it's something from god you're touching god then you're not touching a man you're touching god is what happens brother braham says this he says now look at here i'm trying to tell you that when that quickening power comes into you it's jesus christ it's jesus christ it's not a man it's not a ministry it's not an idea it's not a theology it's not a doctrine it is christ himself he says when jesus laid his hands on the sick they got well when jesus had quickening power to quicken him as a man he could look out and tell the thoughts that was upon the people tell them what they were thinking about and what they had done have his back turned to them tell them the same thing why do you reason in your hearts the woman touched his garment and he said who touched me he looked around and found her he found her because she'd shrunk back she touched him and then she backed away but he found her and said i perceive virtue has gone out of me your faith has made you whole he says that's jesus christ that proves that where the church is and what the real quickening of power of god does to the human being i'm weak brother john i have no strength i can't fight i'm done i'm finished if you can but touch the hem of his garment what comes in it's not just strength it's christ himself comes in quickening power inside of you to make you do what you've never been able to do for that before amen listen caleb and david did not defeat the giants on their own strength anyways right they were no match they were no match we look at them we say well david had skill with the sleep listen perfect shot one time only if he misses that he's a he's a dead turkey he's only got one shot to kill him and he does it and he fits it through the slot this the stone is sized just right to find the weakness in his armor and that's it he's got one shot to do it he rattles that off his helmet goliath's on top of him and he's toast right yeah and caleb the 85 year old taking on giants that are bigger faster stronger meaner better weapon right caleb didn't beat them by his own strength amen he beat them by what christ inside of him i love the attitude of caleb we don't know much about caleb they say he was a gentile did you know that it's never been confirmed but he doesn't have a lineage that we can trace back caleb's a mystery inside the scripture joshua we know where he comes from caleb we don't know where he comes from he says now therefore give me this mountain hallelujah the promise was given yes sir now i'm taking the promise now therefore give me this mountain where of the lord spake in that day the lord spake yesterday but today is the day that we take it and then there's often a span of time between the promise and the possession but he says today is when i want to go in and possess for thou heardst in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced he says this is a big job he says i want to go in today and take care of it if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said now he's just said i'm as strong as i was the day god gave it to me but he doesn't say i'm going to drive them out because i'm strong he says if the lord's with me i'll drive them out and then he still understands that his strength is in the lord amen that it's by his spirit he's putting them out it's not by the arm of flesh amen amen caleb's holding god to what the promise that he gave and the land that he's claiming is the land that he has walked in caleb doesn't want some other portion of land that he hasn't seen caleb wants the original land he wants to go to the land where the original blessing was the original proof was he wants to go to the original source that the land is flowing with milk and honey he says that's the only place i want and i want it because god promised it to me but he says i've been there i know what that land is i know what it can do i know what it produces and i'm not satisfied don't put me off on some other piece of land i know it's going to be tough to take it but he says that's where the original is and i won't be satisfied with anything less than the original let everyone take the other land i want to go back to where the proof is and then what do we have a prophet do in this day he took us back to the original wasn't it he restored us back and said go back to the original go back to the faith of the original fathers go back to the truly revealed word and there you know you're going to get what you need to go amen if you can go back to where the proof was taken before then you'll get the same proof today you'll get the same results you'll get the same blessings you'll get the same manifestation that they had in those days amen you'll also have the same battle they had in those days amen caleb wasn't satisfied to go someplace else he said i want to go where god gave me the original revelation amen now he's not blind to the challenges i love that about caleb remember he speaks his speaking is of what the word says but he recognizes there's a battle ahead he says this is the land of the anakims this is the big guys and they've got big cities that are great and fence this is not going to be a cakewalk it's not going to be a walk in the park but yet i'm going to take them because the lord is going to be with me amen we aren't blind to what we're going through we cannot sit there and say i don't have a problem we can't sit there and say i don't have an issue i don't have a weakness that i don't need help that i don't need to change that i don't need strength that is not what we do but we go to the original source and say that's where i need to go and i'll fight for anything that's at the original source amen if i can find it in the word of god if i can find the promise of god there i know i'll be okay amen we've got to go back to where we know the proof is and then what we don't pretend we're not facing something sometimes we do that and we say well i'm speaking in faith brother no you've got to recognize brother brahm said you got to recognize that satan is there and he's real amen and you've got to be able to recognize what you're facing and if you recognize what you're facing is big that's when we step back and say okay lord we really need some help and sometimes we've got to go to another brother or sister we got to go to the church and say i need more i need you to pray for me i need you to to bind with me in faith and let's push this through and i need somebody to be accountable to or i need somebody to keep up with me and i need to to have more fellowship will you help these sorts of things right we look to the body for those things to help us out brother braham says this he says now that's how we come we are abraham's seed and we call the things the symptoms our afflictions our diseases as though they were not because we are obeying what the holy spirit said through the prophet the seer has said to be the truth he doesn't say you don't have symptoms that you don't say you don't have symptoms but he says we speak as though they are not we do not dwell on them we do not rest on them we do not focus on them we can say the symptom says this but the word says that and i'm going to say what the word says from here on amen it's no problem to tell somebody again brother ron i keep up with them he'll say i've had a bad week he's got no problem saying i've had a bad week but then he says but i'm here in service still amen i'm still in service i'm still fighting the battle i'm still preaching i'm still doing my part i'm still putting my shoulder to the will i'm still using my gift his confession and his energy is to produce the word regardless of what the symptoms are saying and that's what we want to do is we want to confess we want to act on what the word says and push everything else to the side you can say it's there it's no problem no problem say somebody i got a headache today but say i'm doing what i need to do regardless of the headache you know or whatever the situation might be he says and all men through the ages accepted it and has come out right every time he says now we are calling these things right and accepting them as our personal property and wooing back to the holy spirit your word is true i'll refuse any other symptom anything else i believe that you'll make me well because thy word lord says the prayer of faith shall save the sick and god shall raise them up that's all that's the truth but what's the difference here he says what accepting them as our personal property we read about the seven seal he said that when that book's open what is it it's the title deed guess what a title deeds no good without a name on it you've got a description of the property but there has to be an owner's name written there and the difference here is will you say my name is on the title deed will you accept that your name is written on the title deed it is if you can only accept it because as soon as you know that you've got a title deed to it then you know that you can put off anything that's on your property amen caleb says my name's on the title deed that day 45 years ago god wrote my name on the title deed for hebron now i want it because i want to go in and get it amen my name's on the deed i'm going in to get it today amen that's what we're here for we're here for what god said was ours nothing else but what god said i mean that's where our energy that's where our focus has to be is what god said was ours because he's the one that's going to make sure the bank account's full for the things that he said are ours right if god said the bank accounts for your needs and i want to go buy a ferrari guess what it's not there for that that'll bounce amen we don't use the word to go get things that we want we go to get what he said is in the word in the first place amen brother brown says people come to christ today lovely people and accept the lord jesus and say i love you lord jesus and go back and think that's all of it why you just entered the door to a great big compartment store and arcade you know if i inherited anything if somebody gave me a home i'd sure look it all through i'd go upstairs downstairs in the pantry all around the house i'd see what i owned he says but the trouble is of it is is today people just get saved and say well this is all of it he says oh my you've got every redemptive blessing jesus died for as your personal property amen he says get up and look around and see what you own and then we spoke last service about how do we lose the holy spirit we confess the word of god amen this is not some prosperity gospel when you look at them that's what they say speak the word speak the word that is not what we are doing here amen we're not doing it according to the lust of the flesh we're not here to build a kingdom on this earth we're not here to make big dollars and have big homes and all these different things but we speak the word according to the inspiration of the spirit so that we are not presuming and we're not pretending and so we can have expectation that what we say will happen let me tell you everyone sitting under joel olsteen or chris lowe dollars ministry does not become a millionaire and yet they're all speaking the word to become millionaires why is that because the word's not there to support it amen they're speaking out of the lust of their own hearts amen but we are basing what we speak on our faith on the unchanging word of god that he will do what he said he will do abraham says we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life bringing what does that look like bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and god was won that's the high standard that's the bar is what god united in man and women amen and the word and god is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as adam and eve in the beginning in the garden of eden what is it the word and flesh becoming one what was caleb talking about he said the word needs to become flesh today amen the word that i was given needs to be manifested today he said so let's go get it done amen he says i was given the promise and now he's coming to joshua now catch this joshua's a type of what the holy spirit so the believer comes to the holy spirit and says you promised it i'm ready can i go take it amen he's coming to the holy spirit he's asking permission he's saying you're the one that gives me the unction this is what i feel in my heart to do can i do it and what does joshua do it says and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of jafuna hebron for an inheritance holy spirit said yes i give it to you i said it before now i'm giving it to you hebron therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of jefuna the kennezite unto this day because that he wholly followed the lord god of israel he never backslid he never deviated right or left he never moved off the word he never moved off support of the proper ministry but he stayed right in the channel of god's will all the way up until he got his and then he never went off of it again he never went off at the start he got the promise and then he didn't just say well i got what i want and then walk away from god no he stayed true to the word of god until his death amen he held it nobody took it from caleb after that now you can look at caleb and guess what caleb's relatives aren't so good remember um the one that david almost tried almost killed remember and his wife came and saved him naboth no no no nabel nabel's a child nabel's a relative of caleb okay the apple does occasionally fall far from the tree right but caleb that land was given to him and his generations forever the scripture says because he stayed holy with the word of god and he took the word of god and put it into action and went and claimed it and god was with him amen now that's great you say that's caleb what about us let's go to revelation 10. amen revelation 10. we can probably quote the scripture by memory 10 1 says and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and then he's coming now with dominion amen right he was a lamb originally now he's coming as a lion he's coming as a king he's coming as a judge he's coming with dominion because his feet are on land and sea the entire earth is under his feet amen and cried but i notice here he had a little book open you look in revelation 5 books not open that's right but when he comes down now the book is open he says in crime with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which is seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the scene upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things that therein that there should be time no longer now who is this it says it swear by the what it swear by him that liveth forever and ever we're not allowed to swear by god but remember god swore by himself this is god himself this is christ standing here with the open book in his hand because he took it and then the land lamb came from behind the throne right bloody as it had been slain he came out and he takes the book and now it's open in revelation 10. he's coming down with an open book and he roars as a lion he comes down as a king now and he's coming with the open book and he says there should be time no longer what does that mean was the mean time she'll be no longer amen it means this is under the opening of the seventh seal and it means that to the believer there's an ending of our time on earth there's an ending of time in general because this stretches all the way from the opening of the seals all the way through to the end of the millennium this is a long time it's a long time but for the believer for the gentile bride this is the ending of our time on earth right when he comes down and he opens he has an open book what's he doing with the book he starts calling names right we start reading title deeds and all of a sudden we have a possession we have a claim that's here we take that and then we get off the earth and we go and rule and reign with him amen but what is it when he says there should be time no longer to the believer that means there will be an end to all of satan's influences there'll be an end to all of satan's twisting and manipulating and there will be an end to all our all of our trials and struggles what's it saying the end of time for us is rest and then we go into a marriage supper we go with him and he wipes away every tear from our eyes and then there'll be no remembering the things that are behind us amen what do we have we just have eternity ahead of us with our god with our husband with our savior amen and then what happens is we have a quick short work before they're going away yes amen and that's what we're talking about here before that end of time he comes down he has a quick short work in his bride and there's a manifestation there that hasn't happened since the book of acts and inside of that time is when we have what the full possession of what he's given us here on earth amen what is it it's the world be the word being revealed again alpha and omega god was in flesh god's back in flesh through all of it he's been working to restore it but now he comes back in he steps into flesh one more time it's the fullness of god in his people amen he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel are we in the days of the voice of the seventh angel he's already sounded he's already sounded so we're right here we are right here when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and then we know the mystery of god's threefold god above us god with us and god in us so if it's going to be finished we've already had god above us we've always already had jesus christ on earth god with us so all that's left is god in us amen the same fullness it's always a fullness so we have now the same fullness of god with us amen it's all the word it's all the same god but three different ways and three different manifestations amen amen so now we come to the caleb portion all through there all of our first seven that's god's grace that's god's work that's the lamb's work that's christ's work that's him him him but now look at verse eight it says and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth what pushes john forward here nobody was worthy to take it before i john wept because nobody was worthy to take it but now somebody says to john go and take the book so if john can go and take the book john must now be worthy right john must have had something happen to him to make him worthy because before he's crying and the whole earth is crying because he's not worthy but now john steps forward because a voice from heaven says to step forward there's a voice from heaven speaking that this is the time john for you to take the book you've got something to do with the book now it wasn't just the lamb now somebody else is stepping forward somebody else has been made worthy and it's not because he's a prophet that he's worthy it's because heaven says you're worthy now's the time to take the book amen what is it it's the holy spirit quickening us to tell us take the book this isn't just for a prophet this isn't just for the lamb this is for the bride of christ amen amen the holy spirit isn't didn't just speak through brother branham but the holy spirit is speaking to us because the prophet came and said what every redemptive blessing in the bible belongs to you everything that christ died for belongs to you and he died to restore us back to our eating condition so everything is contained within that yes everything to restore you back to your original condition amen it's not that it didn't belong to the people before but they weren't quick into it he says now is the time of quickening now is the time for reading the title deed what's he saying rise take up the land today is the day except for the brahms said it's been it's been what 50 60 70 years since he started telling people every promise in the book is yours every promise in the book is yours he says if thou can't believe all things are possible only believe right only believe glory what did john do did john shrink back and say no no no i'm not worthy i know i'm not worthy i know i'm not worthy but i'm not taking it because i'm worthy i'm taking it because he said to take it and so john in obedience now says and i went to the angel and said unto him give me the little book give me the little book and he said to me it's a warning take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey amen any experienced believer will tell you the promises are great in your mouth but it's a whole different animal when it gets down to your belly isn't it and then the sweet taste of victory you say i'm going in knowing i've got the victory but you got to go through the battle before the victory becomes a reality in you and the battle is never fun if our battles are easy if our battles are simple then we didn't have a battle at all right it's not a battle if there's no struggle amen we are up against an enemy that has been uh fortifying himself as building up his his categories of weapons and the tactics for 7 000 years on humanity it's a battle when you're fighting satan amen there is a battle there and even the children of israel went through and they had to have their battles even christ had his battles amen he did not come through the 40 days of temptation in the wilderness fresh as a daisy he came through and he needed to be sustained by angels when he was done by it amen amen find people you know that have come through the greatest struggles and they don't say yeah it was easy bud no problem i'll do it again tomorrow it'll be no big deal satan's got nothing on me no they'll say it was brutal it was a struggle it was exhausting there were days i didn't know if i could make it through there were days i didn't want to get out of bed there were days i wasn't sure if i was a christian there were days i didn't know if i had the holy ghost you say how did you make it through you just keep striking with the sword of the spirit you take what the word of god says about you and you say it doesn't matter what the symptoms say doesn't say what i see matters what he said about me in the word and you keep striking and striking and striking until a hole appears in the enemy amen yes sir john says he said give it to me it says and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter as soon as i had eaten it you say i'm going to claim the promise and it's going to be easy as soon as you've eaten it truly eating it the battle starts amen and it's bitter in your belly it's difficult to digest and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings did john ever do that he got off and he talked to a few people but he didn't do that that's not his portion that's the bride's portion amen because a caleb comes again a john comes again a bride comes again and says what this is my book too and then the holy spirit quickens that we had a prophet come a malachi 4 prophet that came and said the title deed has been opened up and it's time for you to now be restored back to what you had not on the day of pentecost but in the garden of eden amen we're going all the way back to the beginning now because that's where the title deed takes us amen brother braham says this he says for they are worthy do you realize who is saying this this is on the in the sardisian church age he says it is jesus the worthy one himself this is the only one who is accounted worthy to take the book out of the hand of him who sits on the throne and now this worthy one is saying to all of his saints you are worthy here is this one the only one qualified to judge and indeed all judgment is committed unto him and he says you are worthy these words are as astounding as they are words in romans 8 33 that says god says i am righteous there in the white light of god's righteousness hear the sweet voice of jesus as he says these are mine they are righteous they are worthy they shall walk with me in white amen are you worthy i am because he said not because i am but because he said amen that he has made me worthy amen in christ we are accepted amen what's written in this book what is it it's the title deed it's the lamb's book of life we can call it two things we can say it's a separate book or we can say it's a chapter within the book of life amen but it is the portion that cannot be edited it is written and it cannot be changed it cannot be added to it cannot be taken from it is the lamb's book of life and your name cannot be taken out of that god doesn't add to it and god doesn't take it away from it because it is the word it is his representation in flesh and god is unchanging so how can he change the book that has his word written in it as well amen so within there you have a place that there can be no removing of names once your name is on the title deed and it always was on the title deed there's no taking it off amen nothing you do or say good or bad can never make a change to that amen but within that book i written every redemptive promise that christ died for on the on the cross of calvary and that means that that's a part of your title deed no matter what within within the land of canaan everybody had a different portion some lived on the sea some lived up in the mountains some lived in the valley some lived in the plains we've all got a portion and there's different giants on it there's different things facing us we've got different style trials and struggles look around look around you'll see that that the front row has different things in the next row than the next row we don't all deal with the same things we don't all have the same giants we have a portion that's just for us and that portion is to what bring out the word that god put in us as well and we need those giants to bring out those portions and when if we shrink away if we pull away then god can't be manifested but we've got to commit ourselves to the battle we've got to commit ourselves to taking what's in that title deed and saying lord it is mine you said it's mine and i want to take it amen but abraham says now remember we died in our own name was buried and raised in his see we're no more of our own of which that great name of jesus christ which the bible said over here in ephesians 1 21 that both families in heaven and earth is named after that name that's where god put his name that's the family name in heaven and that's the family's name on earth and we're in jesus christ by spiritual baptism not by water by spirit we're baptized into one body which is christ the worshipping place then being in there we are being on this ground it's like the abstract deed you say i bought a piece of ground it isn't yours yet until you've got an abstract now we don't deal with this the same way they do in the u.s their title system is way different down there way more complex but if you've got an he says if you've got an abstract it shows that everything was ever against that piece of ground has been stricken off because a piece of land can have people that have rights for minerals they can have rights of access they can have liens against it for work that was done for debts that road and so in the states it's a big deal for title in canada we don't actually own the property it's still crown land i don't know if you know that we get the right to live on it but we don't own the land but in the united states you own the land if you have a title to it you own everything above it and below it to a certain depth that's yours okay and nobody can take it away but you have to have an abstract deed otherwise somebody else has a right to do something on your property and he says when you're baptized in he says you've got an abstract deed every price was paid at calvary there's nothing that can be charged against the elect it's all been paid so the title deed is free and clear it's now an abstract title deed and there is nothing that has a right to keep you from your property he says and then when you become a christian and accept christ as your savior then when god sends down the abstract it shows no matter what your father did your mother did good or bad when ellie what anybody else did your mother daddy might have been drunkards prostitutes whatever it was every sin is stricken off you've got an abstract title and there's nothing can put you off of it and look everything that's on that ground belongs to you amen and when you're in christ jesus by the baptism of the holy ghost every gift of god belongs in the church but it's by the holy ghost it's not by sitting in a message church it's not by sitting under a revealed word it's by the holy ghost that you get this he says amen it's an abstract title deed you it's yours it belongs to you let me put it this way me it's mine it belongs to me me it's mine it belongs to me it quickens your mortal bodies he says oh my if we think about it amen we talk about quickening power did you know you've experienced quickening power we often don't realize what quickening power is quickening power is what takes the word out of your mind and puts it into your life and then it takes it off the pages of your bible it takes it out of the messages that you hear and list and and read in these things and it takes it and it makes it live out of you because quickening means to make alive amen so it's not that it drops it into your head with great understanding but it drops it into your life with great effect and then that's what we're looking for is a quickening power it's a super charging effect that takes it out of your head and puts it into a way that you can live it out in your life amen and it's such a reality when it happens that you'll ever wonder how did i live before this how did i ever sit there and think that i was something great before this because you don't know what you don't have until you get something else we don't know what we're missing until we get something that we didn't realize we didn't have right there's something that happens with this and it supercharges the word and all of a sudden you've got something inside of you and it's pushing it out amen you can drink it in but you've got to have the holy spirit to help push it out in your life amen but the biggest thing that quickening power is here to do is to give the word preeminence in our life because of its quickening power it's got to be christ that lives within me not me it's not i that liveth but christ that live within me the scripture says that's what cleaning power is is when christ is living so perfectly through you amen almost done brother braham says we should realize that in us has been given we who believe jesus christ have been born of his spirit and filled with that quickening power that power that's in you by laying on hands on the others like the disciples did and down through the age it absolutely healed the sick raised the dead it showed visions and prophecies and that very same spirit that lived amongst the early apostles is living in the church today working the very same things now that's hard to believe sometimes since the prophet left because you had so much in that one ministry that one man and you're looking for that but it wasn't only meant to be like that it was supposed to be little portions in everyone and so it's so much harder to see the word working maybe in somebody when you're expecting to see you know that the the discernment and great visions and great healings and whatnot but guess what really when you look at the original church it says to one is given this and another that and another this and another that what you had in a prophet was you had almost the whole package there and so we're looking to be like the prophet we're saying well it's supposed to be like the prophet no it's supposed to be like it was in the book of acts which is everybody had something amen so that's what we're looking for is the same spirit that lived among those early apostles living within the framework of the church everybody brothers and sisters alike amen each in their position and each in their place he says and as quick as we can recognize that see no matter how much it's working you've got to recognize that and believe it it won't do you one bit of good until you believe it but the moment you believe it your troubles are ended the moment you believe it you really believe it the moment it's a revelation to you that god has given this to me and it is his will for my life he says that's when your troubles are ended that's true amen if we could only believe god help us believe all that the prophet was told if you can get the people to believe nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer right what is it believe jesus said if thou canst believe all things are possible all things according to the word that's for sure amen look at this in mark 9 this is the father of the boy that had an epilep that had epilepsy remember and jesus said to the father he said to him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord i believe by love is honesty there he said help my unbelief this is a great thing you're asking of me god lord i believe i'm confessing i believe but lord if there's anything within me that's not help me help me to put that out help me to press forward amen in faith amen we're in a special place brothers and sisters we're in a special time we're not called to shrink away from the challenges that we face in life we're not called to shrink away from the promises of the word but rather we're called to press forward in faith under the inspiration of the holy spirit to take the promises of a word into our individual lives amen hebrews 11's the faith chapter and here this is after speaking of all the great heroes of the faith okay all the ones that did the great things that we read about in scripture and we say i only want to be like them yeah if only i could have their faith listen to this it says and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing for who god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect he's given us a better thing than all of those have they didn't have the baptism of the holy spirit they could not it wasn't given they were under the the blood of lambs and goats right they were just kicking the sink can down the road every year but christ comes and he erases the sin dead and all of a sudden he makes it possible for god to now dwell in a man and he says what he's provided some better thing for us so they did it without the holy ghost what can you do with the holy ghost what can you do with the very life of god inside of you quickening you giving you what he's promised laying it before you showing you what's for you what is there that can stop us what is there that can hold us back he says you've got what a better thing than they ever had so what is there that can hold us back what held them back nothing held them back when they had faith nothing held them back that's the same thing for us when we step out in faith amen when we step out with this better thing that he's given us there's nothing that can hold us back amen god has placed his very life his very mind his very character his very desires his very wisdom inside of us david david faced all this frustration because he'd say i've got a desire but i lack something to keep me tight to it you know he lost the joy of his salvation then he he cheats with bathsheba and then he kills her husband and then he does this and he does that and he's like ah we don't have to do ah because we've got what he didn't have we've got what he was seeking right within our lives let's stand together if we would i want you to think of that idea god has placed his very life inside of me his very power his very quickening power inside of my inside of me now there's a battle you face with the flesh every day and we know that amen but the power that he has placed within us by his spirit is there to restore us back to that eden condition amen to give us every promise every redemptive blessing in the book amen sister maureen can you just play that song jehovah jireh my provider as we we start to pray here but i want you to think today let's bow every head if we would i want you to think i want you to look to your own life every head bowed i want you to say lord what's mine fathers and mothers you've got children you might have lost loved ones we may have things in our body we may have sickness that needs healing we may have issues we may have complexes amen we may have besetting sins all of these are there to try and keep you away from the promise that's written in your title deed [Music] amen but there's a holy spirit that's been given to push these things out of your life amen there's a holy spirit that's been given to give you victory over everything that satan would throw in your path amen there is nothing can stand before the name of jesus christ if thou canst believe amen brother braham said this he said now you've got strength enough to yield a sword now that you've got understanding enough in god's word to claim it to be your personal property who can pick up the word of god now in your hand hold it out in the hand of faith and say i take my side with the lord i'll be oneness with my god from this time on i'll yield this sword of the spirit in this word and i'll cut the devil to every promise that god promised me if you believe with all your heart this is still brother branham he says i ask you sincerely with all my heart in the name of jesus christ stand to your feet and accept it now you're standing here but he says do you mean it are you sincere is the word in your hand is your hand your faith he says raise your physical hand to god and say god by this by my uplifted hand i pledge all my life i pledge my soul i pledge my thinking i pledge everything to the word of god he said let the holy spirit take faith now and give me the thing cut away every doubt for me and by faith i receive the promise that i ask for this moment amen we're going to sing that song jehovah jireh my provider and i want you to tell him [Music] lord you are the provider you've made a way and where there seems to be no way yet you've still made a way and lord i'm accepting it here today i want you to confess today that he is your provider that he is your god he is your savior he is your deliverer he has forgiven you he has raised you in newness of life and he wants you to step into the position into the place that he has called you to be in this life amen let's just
