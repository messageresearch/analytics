Lord we worship Him and him only amen he is the Lord of our lives he is our leadership by the grace of God our Lord Jesus Christ I trust my grace we still feel toward him as they did 2,000 years ago the disciples did or if they did it fifty years ago and a hundred years ago that we still feel that that love for the Lord Jesus Christ a man is getting to a place in the world there's more and more emphasis on the natural and less than the spiritual a man brother our faith in Jesus is being challenged and the power of God to say it's going to go on to that amen due to your faith in God not just Jesus but God do you believe God do you believe in God and so on so we're living in a world that doesn't we're living in a world that's under the control of another God and that was the sermon that I want to do but some messages on but we don't want someone once started not today and it is the god of this evil age and brother it is it is tremendous I pray God help us to catch the revelation of what we're facing in this hour we're not going to get caught up with the God of this evil aids just get caught up with the god of righteousness a man with the God as it is in the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God a man and the Word was made flesh amen to redeem us but brother we're hearing more less than less and less about Jesus that's right because the god of this world is getting the attention of the world amen and the things of the world so god help us is my prayer amen so the Lord willing instead of ministering on these these thoughts here and God your God of this evil age and also another message after this was Satan's Eden so are we really aware of what's going on in the world today not just saying I believe the message but are you aware what's going on over there and the deceit that's going on and knowing that it's also affecting many so-called believers that under that spirit they're under the anointing of the God on this evil age there is Satan see not Godsey a man so I pray the grace of God to be able to be on our guard by grace amen and again like I said there's tremendous and it struck me when I was going through it yesterday again on the message godless evil age Oh Laurie oh my I still don't help me the things that the public was saying and what he was correcting the people and and again it is in his own church but I'm tired when I get he's laying it in laying it in laid it in and judging thin amen so brother I pray God that we're going to judge ourselves by the word not not religion not in our hate somebody in our hearts and he brings that out in this message and he's remember he said the outside man is physical and he's in the inside man is spiritual a man but he said let's not lean you on the physical things but listen let's focus on the spiritual Germany are still caught up with the natural things of life and really their only living for this world they're just living for themselves deliver for family deliver who's living for Jesus who is living for God who is living for for the world to come who's living for the rapture and who's looking for the resurrection a man oh well brother Brown said you know if I knew he was coming in the morning I go and I got a glutton do finally not go out and do it yes but you work with the with the consciousness that the raptures and the resurrection is that he or you can never believe you got the Holy Ghost you won't forget it you got the Holy Ghost and keep your mindful of it oh yeah no way are you are easy gonna let you go a day without thinking about the resurrection without thinking about the rapture no no he's gonna be constantly bringing you the revelation of the word a man to make us more and more conscious of the resurrection you got listen if you want it you've got to be conscious of it it's not just where they waited your own way through this this happens that happens then all of a sudden God's going to do this yes he is but it's going to it's going to affect and influence those there are conscious of it amen they're walking in the spirit living in the spirit and rather they can't go a day without thinking about the rapture they can't go a day without thinking about the resurrection why because they want to get out of here and you're happy here you're contending this world something wrong brother you're not part of the bride revival a man so as I said I was going to preach on something on revival and the Father God talked about the ride revival he's just not like any of the others no no definitely not it's going more serious more sobering amen and we've been instructed that way if we are children of the day none of the night we got to be sober and we will be we are sober that shows that we're children of the day and we see what's going on hey man so God have mercy and be with us and help us a man to be more and more serious and to be more and more sincere amen that we truly become fanatics yes you will want to call us for an anxious fine Jesus want evil appreciate praise the Lord so I want you know just express appreciation for sisters sister Priscilla special draw me nearer amen anything that you're hungry for thirsty for praying for is a closer walk with Jesus amen so God God blesses and draws nearer and also to ask you to continue to remember Jessie Noseworthy in prayer [Music] we're at the hospital to visit her yesterday afternoon she knew us she knew me she knew Betty but she doesn't know everything that's going on hey man so we just said some little fellowship with her not much because she's not able to communicate with family or friends she suggests her mind is not with it and that she has expressed to her daughter that she wants to die so maybe she will because she is suffering from pneumonia cancer and a broken hip and that's why she ended up in the hospitals now he's because last week she fell down and broke her hip or either that as they as we've been informed that many people don't fall and break their hip when it comes to senior citizens they break their hip and fall a man it's just just the nature of the body at the time of age and so Jessie she fell and she broke her hip and I appreciate the fact that what she's done for us over the years she's appreciate she's respected us respected our faith and she she's helped so many people but it's amazing grace that's right she's experienced the death of so many family members it's absolutely amazing none of us had that experience that she experienced when it comes to the death not just of her mother but some of her brothers sisters sons daughters or she's experienced death she's dealt with it for many years I pray god bless her amen and she's looked after her daughter for a number of years the daughter that has suffered a stroke and a funny and when she was in her early 40s the daughter died yeah she looked after sister Betty's Aunt Betty amen for many years so I pray God bless her and reward her a man so be in prayer for Jessie Noseworthy we'll be in touch again with her with her daughter's at the hospital and also to pray God's blessing of course on our sister Kimberly brother Paul and brother Michael a man it's new to him I guess the other brothers and sisters that that that got children you can counsel amen what to expect amen and God bless our sister Kimberly and also of course the good news that sister Blanca gave birth to a baby boy a brother Samuel well I think he was much bigger than Michael yeah so so god bless brother Jonathan sister Blanca and Samuel amen so let's being prayerful iñaki brother again in the end time if you got the Holy Ghost you're very conscious of the needs of the vow of the body you're conscious of the needs of your brothers and sisters in Christ amen your heart goes out to them you're there to identify with it bless the Lord amen praise the Lord so god bless just turn with me to Acts chapter 14 Acts chapter 14 thank our sister and brothers for the music brother Chad not with us oh okay okay god bless brother Chad amen and acts 14 and reading from verse 19 forward and there came there are certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned Paul they stoned him they stone us verbally oh yeah they stoned believers verbally one day may be of the Lord tarries the castanos naturally physically again you said no that won't happen oh yes well we consider what's going on in the world even in so-called you know democratic countries in America in Canada in other countries in an England well this is happening that's happening oh one time I said it back years ago every 10 20 years you might hear about something like that but now those things are going on almost every day a man you hear the news every day but somebody would have gone somebody killed this one somebody killed that one or somebody did this or that because the world is insane it is grace of God her brother and we take our stand the more we take our stand the more they're going to oppose this grace and having stone Paul they drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and the next day a man he didn't go home he kept on going in the gospel a man and it says he went into the city and next day he departed with Barnabas and derbe and when they had preached the gospel in that city and had taught many they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and Antioch confirming the souls of the disciples a mayor and exhorting them to continue in the faith so Paul kept on preaching with the other Brethren encouraged him to stay with it don't let what happened to him discourage you don't let what happened to William Branham discourage us there's not think old because they rejected him well maybe the the word is not true the word is true as I say that they they even did it online the Internet and they said how can we reconcile William Branham signs and wonders and miracles with the what he's preaching and what he's teaching yeah they couldn't reconcile that what do you think have you seen what they saw and it was not a man it was God in the man doing it and hearing what they heard you think if the signs and wonders was God the Word was God a man there's pressure the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ but they turned it down many a breacher and just ignored it because why got there well first aid they wanted william branham william branham widow brown because of his signs and wonders but when he began to put more and more emphasis on the word they began to withdraw from Windham Bridal yeah even certain preachers that I could mention and they're gone on now and they were they wanted to go brother round there but after they didn't want we didn't brand him no no because of what he was teaching that was the other evangelist and brother branham of course highlighted the fact that there's coming false prophets he still show sighing great signs and wonders and he said to deceive the people they see the very elect if possible but they want to seed the elect but they are to see and have deceived a lot of people so the grace of God to the bride to stay with the word amen but it's just the disciples here including Paul was confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God amen or you can choose it or not you can say yes I'm going to continue with the word knowing that it's going to what it's going to bring to you knowing the opposition you're going to get a man but we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom by the grace of God a man so brother that we're going to take our stain for the truth we're gonna take our stain for the word in this day and in this hour brother regardless of the opposition that will face and again as the power of God I warned us he said the hour is coming he said when you we won't be allowed to preach this and he's you won't be allowed easy to even pray for the sick no well yeah cool that's on us now god help us we're seeing so little spiritual moves there's a lot of religious a lot of religion but not much spiritual that's why I don't feel the anointing like I did back in the days of our cottage meetings yeah no it's not there why because the spirited was drawing from the earth and if he's worth drawing I trust we're withdrawing amen if he's if he's going out we're going out praise the Lord that's that's the evidence we're on our way out not not just settle here and well we're not going yet we're not going yes well we're going we're on our way that's why we're here pressing on by the grace of God the upward way amen so it is tremendous so I pray grace that we'll have the same faith that they did here in the first stage the same faith in Luther had Wesley had the pentacle early Pentecostals a man there regardless of opposition regardless of persecution we're gonna stay with it exactly oh yeah I mean you're going to pass the test yeah just think of it you won't be allowed to do this you won't be allowed to do that and now a that that did those that don't exactly believe what you believe they're gonna be challenged don't you get involved with that brother or that sister this person or that person because of what they really oh yeah you may have people there now oh yeah that's good they they show me a favor yeah but the diet the day is coming when they won't be allowed to show your favor amen as it was in the days of Jesus as it was in the days of Paul they weren't allowed to express their public agreement with Paul a public agreement with with Peter no no no they got to the place where they said we're concerning the disciples they said don't preach in the name of Jesus yeah don't you do that don't mention Jesus don't do this when when Peter and and all the other disciples were arrested and and brought before the government and the council and so on and brothers same things going to happen ear don't preach this don't preach that don't go mentioning those things you can preach just basic Christianity oh Jesus Jesus died for us yeah that's it yeah you could take it or leave it no there's more to it than that so that it's the the ministry went to confirm the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith how many are continuing into the faith of the revealed Word not many they settled into an organized religion it's a denomination to them but how many are continuing in it so that it controls you more and more you're a prisoner to the word amen not many because few are going to find it few are going into rapture the prophet of God warned us and just saying well it might be 500 well that's a that's that's not many there could be even 2,000 around the world and where'd they all come from brother as we go into this film concerning the the true story of our believers who suffer persecution and the threat of death in the country of Iran he said but they escaped God brought him out I've been thinking about believers I've been praying for believers in Iran I said lord I said I don't know what's going on I said but I said you do so I pray your grace brother we think we think what are we suffering compared to what others are suffering in Iran in those in some European countries some Asian countries and so on whether God have mercy on us if we go going for Nadia and and not to consider our brothers and sisters in other countries amen there are brothers and sisters that are risking their lives yeah they can't they can't have education they can't do work they can't do this they can't do that why because their stand for the word God Elfa grace so brother we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God amen turn with me to second Timothy chapter 2 we try not to be too long because of the business part that we want at the end of the services amen but I can go as long as the business meeting I guess let me see how long our brother Mark will take 2nd Timothy 3 and this concerns the day of the hour that we're living in this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come and there here for men shall be lovers of their own selves and they are covetous very covetous world and they are boasters they're proud they're blasphemers their disobedient to parents unthankful unholy we're living in that world god help us to be spiritual without natural affection that natural love of men is wax cold is that that care and concern for one another is not there anymore not like it used to be no no one-time believers live for believers oh yeah don't mean living for the living brother they're brothers sisters in Christ and the Bible tells us that in the book of Acts Oh after after the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and God will started that revival oh the Saints just went from house to house to house to house house believers yeah they're there to help believers they're there to bless believers they're there to encourage believers there to pray for believers but now the world is without natural affection and they are trucebreakers they are false accusers and they are incontinent fierce and despisers of those that are good that's the truth even believers got that attitude some professing believers they displace those that are good those are really there with the right attitude and the right spirit all right you look down at him ah don't bother them well Christ bother crisis with them and brothers not them it's Christ in them amen they're despisers of those that are good the religious people are despising those that are spiritual and it says traitors Eddie I minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God that's the truth there were two give more time to the pleasures of this world than they are to God and to worship this Wright brothers getting less and less and less you talk about a form of godliness that's what it leads to and it says mothers are pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof see brothers come down to the word not feelings but it's the faith the revelation of the word what drawled what pulled a lot of people back years ago was feeling the anointing was there they wanted this they wanted that but it's all moving away a man and now it's just just the word now feelings is the word faith without faith it is impossible to please him grace having a form of godliness yeah even around the message but denying the power thereof from such turn away a greater and a greater separation is coming for this are they which crypt into houses and led captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth there ever learning the message but they're not coming to the truth the rapture the resurrection the coming of the Lord the marriage supper of the Lamb now as Janice and Jambres withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth and you're under the anointing of the God of this evil age amazing God help us to be on our guard thank God for the revelation has given us a man that he's restored our sight spiritually their men are corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was but there was fully known my doctrine man of light purpose faith long-suffering charity patience a man so do we understand one another's manner of life purpose understand one another's faith long-suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and Iconium at Lystra which persecutions I endured god help us to endure when the pressure increases will endure but out of them all the Lord delivered me God's with you to bring you through it yay and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution if you're not living godly in christ you won't experience it if you're living godly in Christ Jesus you will suffer persecution that's the word evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being to see what a wall will live in in but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them and that from a child there has known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus amen god bless our hearts his word amen as we go in to consider what believers in other countries are enduring what they have suffered oh my I get the email on a regular basis from those that are that are considering believers around the world paying a price for their faith brothers not so much in Canada not so much in America not yet but it will come it'll come on our doorstep it definitely will but brother this persecution for other believers in other countries and I'm not surprised of course none of us surprised regarding Iran and what's going on there but again it's in a number of Asian countries and European countries a man that this persecution of believers is going on and it says that this is the story of God's supernatural work and it says bringing Iranian Muslims to the faith in Christ praise the name of the Lord all the father's give me will come he won't lose none amen so here the message of the hour now thrives in the country of Turkey where these refugees live and serve the Lord persecution beatings captivity are only a few of the many orders those Christians have faced amen we haven't faced it but they are they have and they are and there's other believers around the world now in that I've noted too that there's even teenagers have laid down their life for Jesus what to our young people to identify with that to know that that they got freedom here do you can do this you can do that but there are other teenagers in other parts of the world that have recently been killed you know mothers fathers sons and daughters have been killed what for because they're they're staying for the gospel in certain countries oh no that's not going on oh yes it's good it's going on the grace of God be with us amen and the grace of God will be with them well what faith that they got to lay down their lives what faith that they got to endure this endure that a man be persecuted not allowed to have a were ever job not allowed to do this not allowed to do that yeah but they're more than willing to endure that persecution and that tribulation and they're more than willing to become a martyr for Jesus even in these last days there are believers that are laying down their lives physically for Jesus god help us we'll make greater and greater sacrifices for the Lord amen he said God will judge you by what kind of a spirit you got in you and he should not judge you by your body but by your spirit the inner main or you can be like look like a believer but in a certain thing exactly a believer but what about the spirit does in you your action and reaction to in these issues in this issue and that issue amen what are your thoughts what are your actions what are your reactions what what is your attitude brother that's all determined by the spirit that's in you see God and it looks on the heart man looks and sees what's go outside but man looks what's that God looks and sees what's inside he really knows your heart hey man so I pray the grace of God then in our hearts we have a right spirit a right attitude even the Holy Spirit amen god bless you and again this is 35 minutes the fit to film and again it was edited by Steven coffee I appreciated that fact that our brother edited being prayer for brother Steven because he is taking over ministry responsibilities at brother fortress Church in fact this one reason why he wasn't able to come here during Easter I did ask him and he said oh I'm sorry brother and maybe he might have tried to include us briefly and but he said right now he said he said I'm taking over ministerial responsibilities he said that brother Folgers assembly so we pray the grace of God be with brother Steven he meant it's a tremendous responsibility and I told you the responsibility of getting greater and greater and greater and we get near the end of all things we get near the resurrection of the rapture god help us God help us to be in prayer and brave if you're gonna pray for him on pray for the ministry because they're gonna be under tremendous burden to stay with the word tremendous burden not to compromise God Elvis amen Heavenly Father we pray the grace of your presence with us as we go in Lord to witness what our brothers and sisters in Christ have experienced Lord I pray that our hearts will go out to them Lord relieving Lord that will receive your response Lord all depending on our response to Lord what they are experiencing while they are going through Nord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ Lord their grace to them your grace to strengthen them your grace to encourage them oh my lord my lord your grace to reward them for the stand that they are taking and lord grace for those who are laying down their lives Lord that it would not in vain but I pray that they lay it down father based on the love of God based on their love for God nor they they love you with all their hearts their soul their spirit for the glory of God be with us and be with them Lord our brothers and sisters young and old oh my lord god bless them for taking the stand their taking God bless them Lord for risking yes even their natural lives all believing in the resurrection they believe in the rapture they believe in eternity so grace in the name of Jesus Christ to all the saints around the world for the glory of God in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ lord I pray make it a great revelation to our hearts amen Lord it'll produce a tremendous response a prayer for those Sates god bless them Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen and amen god bless our brother SEZ day amen oh I want to say thanks to sister but I know for making us aware of this this DVD amen so god bless us now if the spirit of Elijah upon John would make John act like Elijah the Spirit of God upon you will make you act like Jesus now there's where you find the Holy Spirit that's what the Holy Spirit does it makes unique makes you humble makes you forgiving could they pull whiskers from your face if you had been there jerk him out and spit in your face when you had the power to call the legions of angels could you do that for the love of the people that was spitting in your face could you do it if somebody just walked up to you said hey John one side of the face could you pray for their forgiveness that's where it trust us that's where he got the holy spirit when somebody says something evil against someone sometimes it claims I have to always burn how I get even with her if it takes me my last day now there's where you check about your whole sphere [Music] blessed are you when man shall say all manner of evil against she falls it for my namesake but you go get even with him I'll rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so persecuted they the prophets which were before [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] unlike what people think is not living in deserts and riding camels that's for sure here gives a modern country if you go to Tehran you will see many luxury commerce industry like variety is no Maseratis is it's not strange to see that especially noir terror and that's a kind of life salt onions half [Music] but being a Christian living in Iran is quite different when you're a Christian and government finds out about your belief and faith your earmarked so you have to always look over your shoulder they will mark you you cannot get a job any government related agencies work for God on a roll that's for sure and even when you apply for business certificate or any kind of permission and they will give me a hard time and they'll make make your life miserable as much as they can in my experience working in Turkey with Iranian refugees I've come to the understanding that there's not many nations in the world that are more hostile to the gospel than the nation of Iran believers there are facing constant persecution and they're in constant danger because of their faith both danger from the government and from regular citizens throughout Society [Music] Iran historically speaking was a sour Austrian country they followed that religion they had their own priestly class they had their own scriptures called Avista and you know it's about love and doing good works and don't those kind of things and it's belief in one God but they have many idolatrous act actions within that but historically they were Zoroastrian acero Austrians and then as time went on the gospel actually went to Iran with the Apostles and it spread greatly there around the Year 500 there was a huge persecution that took place in Iran because those are Austrians were being overcome by the Christian faith and so five hundred thousand Iranian Christians were persecuted and killed during that time period and so it wasn't more than 150 years later that Islam came and went through and conquered the the lands of Persia a would would have been the sassanid empire that would have covered Mesopotamia Persia into India Afghanistan Pakistan and so forth so these countries were eventually conquered by the Arab Muslims and Persia fell with a great persecution I mean literally they had lines of people lined up to come forward and say will you convert to Islam and if the answer is no they behead them right there and so this was a this is the way that they forced Iran ian's to become Muslims and there's a resentment between Persians and Arabs to this day you know we think well aren't aren't they all Arabs do not ever say an Iranian is an Arab the Iranians hate Arabs Arabs hate Iranians we see this in the world today with our president going to the Middle East and he's gathering all the Arabs together and and they're all speaking terrible about how bad ear on is and if you want to talk if you want to unite the Arabs together just talk about how bad Iran is [Music] [Music] nooooo midoriko shook adam batata vada pav venetie venetie revolver Navasota for neva Eva gon be blessed oh good

reading ever so it was beautiful it's not like cancer it's just history here what the country is is a wise man that's it I came across New Testament [Music] apostasy means leaving the faith so in in in Islam someone who is born as a Muslim or converts to Islam if they choose to leave Islam for for no religion or for another religion they say they're in a pot they've committed apostasy and so if they if they were born a Muslim were converted to Islam and they leave Islam they're an apostate and it says apostates are worthy of the death penalty [Music] the first day that I went to the church as a newcomer was a day it was a Friday then I remembered the night before we were already errors at my pastor and it was a harassment wave around around the country brother Xiang he was a resident Petrus was arrested and many other people were arrested by the time that was the first day that I go to the church as a Christian and the webblock Asians were standing outside the door taking pictures who comes up with those so it was my first experience in church so years after that I knew what's going on I was a close friend of my pastor we used to walk together so I knew things that other people didn't know what's going on what pressure of Ibaka's Brina to the church so another thing that they did before my pastor goes to report to their to the office in Shiraz he asked us to disappear if he got arrested and said nobody will judge you just disappear and it's important for you guys to be out and minister to people I don't want you to imprison and so forth and he was arrested and we knew that we're gonna be next so I had a meeting in one place was me and two other brothers I said no this is what the pastor said but it's honestly like no matter where we go here in this country and we gonna arrest I'll be in the church and you're more than welcome to leave and there's no hard feeling nobody would judge you and I'll take full responsibility [Music] so have really came to agreement

they're hacking into your computer they're hacking into your phone they're listening they're recording they know what's going on believers can't freely pop in the telephone about their faith about

question you give it an answer they don't like they'll beat you across the back of the head so they'll make you stand up against the wall and push your head against the wall [Music] so this is what

says the Iranian judiciary has approved a million dollar bail for freedom deal the attorney says he will go to Tehran seven prison to begin procedures for their release with Holland Bauer and a third companion Sarah Shourd were arrested along the iran-iraq border in July 2009 short was freed last year on bail fatale and Bauer were sentenced to eight years in prison myself was right next to the shower and the cell right on my left side I could hear them they were calling they were hikers American hikers who were arrested a couple months before I was arrested push a button or call the guard to open the door and go down default user Washington and come back then I could hear them they were pressing the button no one was answering and they were calling the guards and nobody could speak English with this and they wanted to take him to the shower again nobody could speak English and there was only one girl who could speak English and that they were he was on leave and he wasn't there it was on duty so they had to wait for him to come to speak to them and take them to the shower and make you know provide with the bees that he had that's how I knew I was writing to the writers during the iteration they bring your paper and they asked me to sign it and I sided and asked and what it was oh no big deal your execution paper you're gonna hang you but you can imagine what I've been through right and the I followed me they handcuffed me and chain on my face and that's all I'm following them down the corridor assembly hall point down sirs let's take a right there is this moment of truth neither one can't your faith we die right here [Music] now we have no problem with that because we are doing commandments of God we'll have a good night's sleep tonight okay and I just do it inside like this I was scared I cannot deny that our school when I was there a noose around my neck and they were putting pressure on me just you either guy here you walk and so forth this came to my mind and I said okay you're asking me to deny my faith in order to save my life what if I died in a car accident and see Lord Jesus and he just shows his hat to me one day I have to say they'd rather die right here how am I scared of course I am a human being but I know what I'm going is that for me after actually they started to play good-cop bad-cop the good cup you know this is not very fighting to judge yet and we can't do it later bringing down taking back to so and it will be back to yourself [Music] [Music] you [Music] we grow up in a society that believes in freedom of religion and so culturally that's ingrained within within our our minds and our hearts that's what we see all around us so we don't we don't believe in cursive cutey is looking for for their faith even if we strongly disagree with them we believe that they should have the right to practice their religion the First Amendment gives us the right to freedom of speech we have the right to freedom of religion these are things that are just as conservative the Christians we just we live and breathe them so it's we don't think of it that way just let me draw you a picture you see a person who's in Christ for years and when you talk to him you want to give a scriptural reference to him you'll see he is staring at you and you ask him why doesn't he have his Bible on him and he says I never had one it breaks your heart before walking we got without having Bible so how can they search the scripture how can they verify and recognize through the front line but if they don't have a Bible in it if they don't have a New Testament read for themselves if they don't have brother branham's material printed in their hands in your own language so they can read what the Prophet is generation brought for us and just not take my word for that [Music] Jesus told us in Matthew 24 that this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all nations and then the end shall come so we know that we've got to bring this message to every nation and so that means all the nations of the Middle East it's been our vision from the beginning that these believers here from Iran that have been persecuted that fled the country can also reach to the other nations throughout the Middle East who better to reach Muslims than former Muslims they know they know the background they know the history the culture when I left the country came to Turkey I had a scripture that says whatever I send you you would go out whatever I put in your mouth you will tell so that's my vision following the same thing wherever God sends me wherever God wants me to be I'll be there and whatever he puts in my mouth I will tell but specifically about Turkey and ministering to fail all Iranians my vision is to provide them with more broad materials of Branum as much as possible provide them with Bibles New Testaments and audio translations with the doctrines and with the materials so I can put them in their hands so they can read for themselves they can search the scripture they can search for a brand those messages to see if for a ministry in according to what for an upset so that's my vision to be able first make sure that I still have the leading of the Lord for here and be humble to their leading be obedience to his will the field as much as I can and do the best I can do assume them I trusted is the Sabre than that fall other brothers that's funny alright three two one [Music] you you amen pray the grace of God to the 1500 believers in Iran oh I've wondered about it many times that wonder not how many believers are there I thought there might be a few with 1500 we pray the grace of God to them as they take their stand for the truth if they take their stand for the message a man so we thank the Lord for the witness of our brother and of course our brother Stephen coffee as well concerning believers in those countries please that we're not going to vote here ignorant of what's going on among the Brethren the brothers and sisters in Turkey we're not going to go out and be ignorant of what's going on with the brothers and sisters in Iran and there's other countries as well so brother I pray the grace of God to them amen so do what we can for them is to is to pray for them that the Lord would Lord is there to meet their needs and as that was highlighted there concerning certain things in Iran that if you took your stand for the word to curse and for the message you took your stand for Christ that you're not allowed to get a job they're not allowed to do this you're not allowed to do that on others in that country are not allowed to do anything for you to help you so you're really in you're really going by faith really taking God at His Word you're really going to trust the Lord and brother you know do we have that faith to trust God you know you know oh my we're in a world that's very prosperous yes we are yeah Newfoundland is prosperous Canada's prosperous the Americas prosperous or the people wouldn't be living like they're living and have what they have you know but again they're not sort of not so prosperous in those countries and they are brothers and sisters really truly in need you know they really truly have needs so does our hearts go out to them have we praying for them not just casually saying a prayer but really hungry in a thirsting in our hearts Lord please Lord for brothers and sisters in Iran for our brothers citrus and Turkey for our brothers and sisters in in in some of these other countries Lord that opposed Christianity that opposed the word that opposed a message in the name of Jesus have mercy on Lord please whatever you want me to do Lord to encourage that help me to do it so Lord as they as they are laying down their lives for the word yeah they're taking they're taking the data that that opportunity there to preach the word but under under the condition that they might be arrested on the condition that they might end up in jail amen well as I said what's going on there be on our doorstep one day please in the name of Jesus let's take it serious amen because it's concerning the end he mentioned their mountain in Matthew chapter 24 concerning what's going to go on in the last days and live well it's gonna get so bad in the last days he said it'd be no flesh saved if he did in short in time now I wonder brethren did highlight the fact that not we're not talking about no souls saved but no flesh saved it's going to get that bad for those that are going to take their stand for what's right so I pray great grace that we're going to keep on moving forward let them in let their faith encourage us in our faith as they take their stand and having to maybe suffer this and suffer that that by the grace of God Lord we'll take our stand here for sure a man so and pray for them so the grace of God to them the grace of God to us we know as to brother Branham when it comes to I think a brother Jack more mention it when it comes to the giving them financial help and so on financially in each spiritual help more than the financial help but and who is the brother that gave brother Branham that $500 check you know for for for this the levers are for Christians in a certain country there I want to say what the country was and brother Brown tore the check out and yeah I think it was more than $500 he tore it off and the brother was shocked no custody what why would he do that you know tear that check up and brother Brown he said brother he said just take it to a forgot knows your brother their faith is tested one way and our faith is tested another way that's true but again as we pray for them we pray grace that they're praying for us just think what they're enduring what they're going through that they still have they got the Holy Ghost Debbie praying for us oh yeah where they're taking their stand for this take their stand for that oh my they're really their faith is really being tested and they got to pray for the pray for those into more prosperous countries oh yeah well we need to pray for them because oh they got to maybe lay down their physical lives yes for the gospel but again maybe they're concerned over the believers here in these countries that are better caught up with prosperity they're caught up with this and kind of with the Oh Lord help help our brothers and sisters in America how about brothers and sisters in Canada Lord don't let them get caught up with the natural things of life Lord Lord that they'll they'll be more than willing to lay down their lives as we are here amen see so I pray the grace of God for them that the Lord gave them more strength and encouragement to keep on preaching keep on taking understand for the word and they know when they go to church that they might be arrested and especially if they're gonna preach they might be arrested they'll end up in jail and so on so but they amen if they got the Holy Ghost maybe they're considering us and saying Lord oh we think they need prayer more than us maybe they feel that we need prayer more than them why because of what we're tested by what we're tempted by especially as an engineer 2nd Timothy chapter 3 you know what's going to happen maybe you'll see less and less of that among believers in those countries but you see more and more and more of it among believers in the in so-called free countries oh yeah so we need to be on our guard to there they're laid out of their lives so yeah Lord if we've got a died for you will die for you we're gonna die for the word we'll die for the word amen because why because they're going to go into eternal life but lord we pray for our brothers and sisters in America we pray for our brothers sisters in Canada Lord they might get deceived so don't Lord don't let him get to see don't then we turned our life over to this turned their life over that let him stay with the word Amen God hidden and God revealed and simplicity Amen thank the Lord for that revelation to God be the glory a man so bleep please in the name of the Lord let listen let's be on our guards - oh yeah alright god bless them in Iran god bless them in Turkey no other countries and yes lord have mercy on us in in these countries a man because sometimes natural freedom oh yeah you can take away and make us make us a little bit to relax when it comes to spiritually Oh most definitely oh yeah I don't have to worry about this I read word with that the brother where's over there God is trying and testing their faith in every area of their lives here oh well I don't have to trust the Lord for this don't need that sorry Lord you've done this you've done that you've done that I got this I got that yeah and we put less and less faith in God for it because we take it for granted amen so God be with us and God help us is my prayer brother again that will as the Bible says that was holding on my doctrine manner of life purpose faith long-suffering charity patience and persecutions afflictions which came unto me and so on he said and he said what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me yeah because he was enduring it he wasn't going to compromise so he had less persecution he wasn't gonna compromise so they have less afflictions and so on no no he kept on going even after he was stoned someday was dead he got up and kept on going just thinking what he endured he experienced it they thought he was dead he was stoned to that extent a man but when he kept when he came back and he got his health and strength again he just kept on going in the name of the Lord he wasn't going to slow down he wasn't gonna stop no hope all your gonna keep doing this yes well it's just my just my nature it was his only ghost nature to keep on doing it a man he just went on and on and on and on by the grace of Almighty God a man and he endured as I said much affliction and he endured much persecution a man and brother and we take our stand and more and more and more emphasis on the gospel Ananda on the word brother the hours coming would I trust my grace that we're going to endure when they come to try to put but put us to an end because listen as I said before there's thousands and thousands and thousands of nonprofit charter organizations in Canada and they want to cut that back they do they want to cut it back and that's why eventually they're going to force you to try it unite with with with this larger organization this larger group this larger group yeah and we'll lose our registration and so on many believing churches were losing as I know that some have already lost it in Canada why it's because of what their faith because of what they preached yeah but the thing of it is as I've a certain church was their deacons was advised to consult me this they were wondering what to do how to do it and so on comes to comes to their what they believed and the church registered with the government so a brother said contact brother Gerald in Newfoundland and he said he'll give you the advice so I gave him the advice and and I told him what they should not do and he said brother you're right they said they said we're aware that just just recently a church lost his for registration and they now now they had no more rights as a nonprofit organization with the with the federal government why because of a certain thing they did they shouldn't have done it that way third thing they said they shouldn't have said it that way and so I expressed it again to another church their eyes to make sure if you say it the right way I said don't don't be too bold with it I said just do it this way this way this way and okay so do we understand so that so there's there's a number of churches that have lost their registration why because of what they said when they said how they said it and so on see it's like the in a certain country in Europe and her brother was preaching and he got up he read a scripture here at a certain scripture now he didn't say anything he just read the scripture and went on to preach the word and but there was somebody in the audience that heard and read a certain scripture about a certain thing in condemning this and condemning that it was Scripture and that person went out and reported it and that pastor ended up in jail for six months for highlighting that Scripture he did yeah he did that wasn't that long ago and I'm not sure exactly what country it was but is it serious it is serious so it we got to take a serious and God wants us to take it serious by grace so that we truly take our stand for the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth amen so god bless us and god bless to our hearts the what we have seen may we not forget it but maybe keep constantly keep them in prayer not only in Iran just think fifteen hundred believers I never thought that God bless him and God be with him and may the Lord continue to strengthen them and encourage them and give them what they need a man was they need you just need stronger stronger stronger faith they keep standing for the truth we need stronger stronger faith to stay with the word don't compromise it's a devilís the god of this age the god of this evil age is doing anything he's trying to deceive the people to get him to compromise compromise a little hair compromise it over there no don't compromise stay with the truth God's grace to us amen nor bless your listing amen I want to turn it over to our brothers for the business part amen we're going to sing onward Christian soldiers marching as to war amen it's 209 in the melodies of praise and get it online they're a man yes praise the Lord to God be the glory brother a man and a man a man may the Lord increase our brothers and sisters faith in in Iran in Turkey and in other countries to God be the glory thus sing it and while have deterred to our brother mark [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen no but she may be seated just so I'm gonna just cover it just as an annual thing the annual report for 2019 and just a forward view of 2020 and what the numbers are for that and then after this and it's not gonna be long and then the Joseph is going to come up and conduct the just ease of voting for the officers of the church he's just going to talk about that and then we'll have the voting in the countin and they'll be it'll be it's for today you'll be dismissed so it's a annual thing that we have to do so you know according under the registration and things but something we should do anyway just to take a bit of time to talk about the other side is that's the most important side well it's just something that you know we have responsibility to do and be responsible for you know the money we take in and the money we spend so in so we've already had a meeting here in January with the brothers and they have the information on all of this so I'm just gonna flick through this today and then because we've already gone into detail and I'm gonna just talk about certain things and then I'll send this out to all those on the list here in the PDF file so you can just review in more detail if you want because there is some detail on the slides here and you got any questions you can just just respond back to me on the email or anything or if you have one that goes through the whole thing I'll sit down with you and go through the whole thing but I don't think you'll find it it's pretty basic money and money out you know what have we said what have we wanted what did we plan to do did we do that and what did we do was there anything else was that it and you know how it all turned on me and you know so all of this you know it's it's uh you know basically the money that comes in we use it for the things that you know the church you know is is forum to do whatever it is you know the government to look at it and they say what is it you're here for and if you're we're here for church or her or you know whatever that's what we that's what we spent the money on if we don't spend it on that then dead they'll ask a question and say well what you spent on this form you know so and they were looking for those things so so we just want to make sure that while we're here for and the money would collect from the people and that we spend it on the things that were where we said we're gonna spend it up okay so I got a I got a Geiger I do just okay so I just everyone should be see that so this is the you know some people care about it some people it's up to you how much you want to know about this the best part completing your money or your tides that you're offering to that that's someone else have a look you know take care of it so in 2019 the first thing in the morning we did pay off that we doing for me next time so in terms of visiting ministers you see what happened six visits to both of them and came through this year so we see over here that the offerings that were collected for the ministers so every time a minister comes I was not a note to say if you want to you know put an offering in and that amounted to $12,000 and change and it was 63 percent of the total cost which was 19 thousand points of me for the minister's mo says travel travel expenses and stress you with us and then in the tides it was seven to nine seven thirty seven percent which makes of the hundred percent so so that's how the ministers are funded and this year was new which is the tuition expense in use you see for the Baptist school also for a home school and how much was the contribution breakdown sort of church the from the tides offering really it was four thousand six hundred fifty eight and upstream donated five thousand and the balance was from the offerings that was just a make up to told house to fourteen thousand five hundred fifty six that's what the total cost was and then brother Matt and brother Chad had a portion to pay and the church paid their portion which amounted to ten thousand so church pay ten thousand they told us fourteen thousand and the balance there four thousand and some was paid by the two brothers the two families okay and that's going to continue this year so these are some of the things that we did that we support during the year so you know what there are things like church equipment and missions and church to website was developed by Pope Paul and people this year didn't one soul at that you know was a cost to those things and there's some coordination and planning and execution to do those things Sunday school programs which carried on the youth events the church picnic the camping trip all is it was funds from the treasury camping trip to fellowships the tuition program the church address changed and the notification sent out for that I was a post office box changed deacons and trustees positions fully established full implementation of the treasurer position they will come for building funds donation slips or were issued an honorarium tax forms to be and there also to be issued W issued this week so if you did get if you did get some money from the church we're required to send out a t4a or a t-4 and iron form to the US so this but just come to if you say buy something and you give it an invoice and you get money to do so tax obligation for that but say for a minister coming in say if you give them $1,500 let's call an honorarium and then you're given a slip so they have to put it on their income tax and they should anyway they don't need us but as you put it on anyway it's other angle so that's what that is about just some tax things on that we have to look after this is the money page so you know when I send it out you can have a look at this so here's here's a breakdown of all of the costs in categories here and you see the percentage of those things you know like the pastor expenses all the expenses is probably half the money that comes in and here's the other things busying ministers Mormon Church church operations and things here's the money that does come in here here's the bank balances at the end of the year these are the expenses that what the money was spent on and this was just some of the larger disbursements through the year like paying off the mortgage for the visiting ministers at tuition and the building pumps is just big globs you can see I just added him so you can look at that and it's just a note there was a six thousand dollar loan that was ahead for to pay off the mortgage just a little bit early just to finish it off so we did that in the first part of 19 so that's 19 so this is this now we're into to 2020 so 2020 you'll see this is the tuition program again we're gonna carry it out it crosses over 20 and 21 so there's no money really goes out now until September 4 and basically we're at this point we're just gonna do basically the same thing so you see is the same same amounts as last year's this year and we have to wait to see what what the cost will be coming from the back to school if they increase our costs for decrease or say someone low to kindergarten grade one is more money and all that so there would be some change to that which we can adapt to but basically what we're saying in the plan today and voting on and signing off is that we will go ahead with the tuition program like we did last year which i think was a good thing it was a this is the building program now and I'm just I I go circle back to 2012 and 2013 when it when we decided to buy this building and there was there was five phases at the time phase 1 and 2 was the to get the to actually acquire the building that all had to be done with permits and surveys and assessments and appraisals and all of that and that we had to do and it was a cost of that of three thousand nine hundred seventy eight dollars that we had to pay just for different things to get it set up so that we could buy it and start working on it phase three was the actual construction we had to change the building to a church that's what we did and basically and buy the building so the only money we borrow was really the mortgage and it amounted to around a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars which we paid off in five and a half years which was good praise God for that and to do the construction cost us forty four thousand six hundred and sixty one dollars rounded off and there was no loan for that or anything it was just our own money that we collected there was two people that donated money to us you know from other churches and that's that's how that was paid for the construction it was mostly labor free we spent very little on labor it was mostly the church people and most of that was equipment you know things we had to purchase like you know with building materials and also like he pumping air conditioners and heaters and whatever we had to buy that that included in that forty four thousand six hundred and sixty one dollars rounded up so then we had phase five this will react today now never suggest background so phase five phase 4 I should say faith for there were some things that we were going to do once the church was built which was we had the old pulpit first you remember we were gonna get a new pulpit and was your one of the altar and at the end I think I got there there was pews brother Joseph ended up finding two pews and we brought him back in from Nova Scotia which was good and pulpit the bathroom right there the third bathroom the cross outside now it's an old rugged cross and now and a piano we wanted to get a new piano this morning into paying for it and anyway and we were going to get this to deciding outside which we didn't do we never that's the only thing we didn't do and that was six thousand dollars so that we said we'd we didn't have to do that right away and once we were in the church then we spent the money on those things and it was just our own money again so it was good it was as planned we didn't need it at the time we just everything was tight so we wanted to make sure that we just waited till that the other stuff was paid for and everything and then we could do that so that was good and so now we're into that was all done in in in 12 and 13 and now in 2020 we're here again now at phase 5 that we were going to do because we you know the foyer there was tight and we kind of knew that you know especially in the winter because she couldn't stand out so everyone was tight there and we wanted to do something with that the pastor's office was small we wanted to do something with that and have a bathroom joined with it especially especially got busy ministers from something they got a quote side and stuff outside to go to the bathroom and thank you then the nursery you know small but and also whatever about the sanctuary but and also there was programs going on like Sunday school programs but the nursery was needed at the time because she had new babies now coming and you know you the mothers with babies can't go into nursery after Sunday school going on in there and the only he got those poems so we have a tight on space is only 800 some square feet in all of this so we know Enders functional areas that you need so that's that was the plan back then that we we're gonna have to deal with that and we said we deal with it when the mortgage was paid we would deal with that in otherwise we just you know go along and do it right so so I could say just here this is just the church funded this this amount is fifty four thousand five hundred fifty one for phase one two and the construction and four and then there was a loan there so okay that's just a little background so in it so this year's billing program the goal was to provide adequate space for the connotation the office do tell these two parking the stories programs a nursery so we just anything to anything that was needed for the conducting the church programs and services you know service that's what we needed to make sure that we had in the building program so the issues we had now was you know the things driving the drivers day I say issues the drivers you know having more people is not an issue the drivers would be the growth of the assembly percent see growth with that so you just need more room especially around the functional rooms that I mentioned the Sunday school space and also storage you know just having that adequate you know to do what we need to do and then faith five was the issue that a toy a which is small we'd like to expand it the pastor's office bathroom so what we're thinking about is you know doing just looking at in another building program at this time and we've talked about it opinion especially both Paul has done some work with the town Town Council and talking back or what we can do first so we looked at the options of heaven extending out to the sides to extend in the front extend that partner you know just take away the bank and go out there that way we could go to the back but we know we need a land that was but that we could get you know at some point from the Curly's there if we could get that to expand up that way which would be the best option or we could extend up and put another story on or purchase another building or do nothing you know that was the options that we have right so extending up this way was was not option at all and then we found out we couldn't extend out this way because right now we we're not back from the road as far as we should be anyway so they're not going to let you go this way towards it and so that that's not an option extend up you know that's easy in some ways but it would be definitely disruptive here you know we don't to be happy an extension too disruptive where you have to stop services I can't use this building and find another place so we do this is best one thing we'd have to look at purchaser billing you know that was that was an option of a van or a mortgage in that if we wanted to write do things I got a and had to sell this building in and you know selling it's just I really see these days so so the first thing was the best thing was to go to an extension in the back we'd had to figure out if they would sell us the land if too careless they said she said to me you know that you know with if she was gonna sell a house she would give us first crack so on someone lost the land part the the back part of our property did squares off with this property if the Curie's all in all that it's at one time they only this house that land that they owned you know this part and all that so so we were trying to find trust trying to catch her at the top on the scene if maybe you're not gonna sell on but maybe you you sell off that land now before we make a decision on which way we would go with the extension and going out that way would be a really good way of doing it you know that would be the best best option for sure it the easiest and fits right into the council side of it and that land there you know it's you know it's not gonna they're not gonna sell it to anyone else because there's no access to it weird only ones have access to it sorry indeed the in the end after if we didn't get that option it would be to move it would be to extend out this side so you leave this wall here and you extend out that side and then have a have a Fourier of it that way you know and then you would dig down on that side and put in a couple of rooms for Sunday school or night and then extend out here the bathrooms in the nursery a little more so that you'd have more room and the pastor's office would go on the extension on this corner Daniel would take down this this these rooms and this room and make it for platform I moved to piano up here and the exit would be on through the pastor's office so you'd have bigger area here for the musicians and things and then you know so to be more room that way and you can have a little more room if you did expand up here with some more pews you know so it'll give you some time you know and that you wouldn't have to wait and then when the land came you would then go go start thinking about you know putting a building in there and maybe making this part of fellowship hall that would connect this would be a nice nice size for a fellowship hall is gonna be here right because this is 24 by 24 right here in this breaking if we'd all here 24 by 24 and if you look at our place is 18 by 18 our house our extension so 24 by 24 would be nice for our church you know me being a nice size right then you have a look at probably a little kitchen a little kitchen in there I need so had the bathrooms and that and then to be a hall going out then to the church here with a door and you could just carry on into the church if you had to write them to be them the day's seven so so here's the review of the things really consult with CBS engineers and we're pretty clear Paul spend a good a time on the due diligence of that so we're pretty good to go and do it do that side extension and just make just work on the foyer entrance and dig down the big part is to dig down deep and to make that so we can go out there's 13 feet and then we go down a full eight feet on the other side it's just a little Gaby little careful just going down where the building is just on the post right but it's not not undoable and then not real expensive you know we could we could get by on a building fund doing it right so then we would look at look at these things immediately the front of the building needs repair to shoot around the front of the building down the sign is off Thank You Matthew and that's Dallin and we had to clean up this cedar that's on the frontier that was there in the beginning we had put some on there but it's it's so wearing fast that basement cleanup and a new vacuum for the church and that's already done of course that's there now so we were really on the start of the due diligence so I didn't know was any questions or anything and that but you get to ask later or whatever but we've kind of gone through gone through it a bit before with the brothers so and we're still working through some of the details but that's the high level plan there that's the drivers I see options so we just got a language we want to go right and the visiting administers this was last year this is just some of the names we threw up when week to a Karen Mills of course brother general has announced already for April so there was some of the other names and your Glover came up but I put butter Macondo there I was talking on the phone I said would be coming down maybe over summer if you did you know be nice to have him preach you know it'll be good wait a couple years ago anything and if sister mercy came down last year but he didn't come back and I may see brother Matthew Watkins but a George Schmitt mentioned that he would like to come again and I think Andre had me I think he was catered for bishops anyway road this year I thought that we were talking to sis China and she thought he was supposed to be come they're still funding him she said so you know support them they're in the mission so you know so those are what we put out there and we'll continue support these programs that we did last year you know the youth events and the picnics and the camping I guess and doing those things again this year which everyone enjoyed and this is the budget just you know the high level budget for to 2020 so you can you can have a look at that I'll send it up to father everybody and the summary to church building project which be a big one this year to start in on that proceed with the church to school tuition funding the visiting ministers implement the building changes we're going to 2020 election today to that and an agree in sign off on a proposed 2020 budget programs who would just sign off on this plan for this year so for the government more than me you know so they take you say okay you did this here's what you said you were gonna do here's your money okay where did you spend it did you spend it on what you said you were gonna do okay you know that's what we go through with that and and I think that's it unless there's any questions I'll pass it over to get this up to everyone today on the mailing list and I don't know if I got I think I got everyone just add one thing to what Dad said correct me if I'm wrong but my understanding is that with the due diligence and the funding and the planning and so forth the plan is to put all that together and then bring that to the church to explain that the options of how we would do that and that would be voted on yea or nay yes there's still a pending pending project so real quick just just to go over what we're about to do next we've done I think is our third vote now we've done so every one I think is pretty pretty used to the process and so I was asked just to quickly go over it again and just to remind everyone of the process so the the vote is is it's part of our bylaws is to have an annual vote and all of these positions pastor right on down are all elected by the church and all those positions are are intended to be positions of service we're here to serve the body and so the church ultimately you know by the parameter that is the in a sense the Holy Ghost you know the church boat and the decisions that are made through those votes these the leadership of the Lord we believe that so each year there's an opportunity for each of us to have a say in you know who the different positions are and who fills them we're not voting on the pastor alright we just done 40 years so we we trust him by now yeah it's got tenure so once you put 40 years in a position you're you're taking off the ballot so you got a ways to go so we won't be voting on the pastor but we will be voting on the trustee and the Deacons Sunday School Superintendent Sunday school teachers and there are there is a criteria for voting and real quick it's you have to been regularly attending this church for a minimum of six months okay so you started coming three months ago you know you have to wait till next year about you you meet the other requirements so we're not going that we haven't you know we don't have a list here if we're gonna get a ballot - we're just gonna hand them down the aisles and you'll have to do your own assessment of whether or not you're qualified to vote another requirement is that you have to be paying tithes to be an active tithe payer to this church and the two exceptions are if you're a stay-at-home mother and your spouse works and of course you you just fall on their owner Neath him and of course the sisters are allowed to vote if you're a student do not have a job that pays a salary then you would also be able to vote as long as you meet the rest of the requirements you have to be 18 years of age today or older and you have to be baptized in the name the Lord Jesus Christ so those are the those are the four requirements so again just you have to do your own assessment and if if you don't meet one or more all of those I'm sorry if you don't meet all of those criteria then just just don't think about this is a silent vote so nobody's needs to know what you voted so try to do that privately it's best you can just make it fill out each of the the the squares that are there for each of the positions each ballot has yes and no just put a checkmark in the box yes if you want that person to stay in that position there's no new people being nominated here is everybody is an incumbent and then check know if if you do not agree and do not want that particular person to serve in that in that role and if nothing is checked if there's a box that's left empty then it'll be treated as as an abstain vote and not count brother David and the mark will be counting the votes after it's done and last by the mark just to let us know what the results are please fill out your ballot completely just to make that straightforward if you don't want to vote which is also an option just just hand your your ballot back or don't take one to begin with so that's that's that there any questions about that okay just a quick quote here as from the key to the door 1962 well the brown said the church is sovereign and what the church says that's that's what or where that's that you could say trustees or nobody else the trustees each one is one vote capacitor is just one vote it's the church it's a democracy of the church to sovereignty the church the church in whole speaks and that's all and we like that because we have no bishops or hierarchies or overseers and so forth to tell us this or that or the other there's no headquarters you know except above it's the Holy Spirit in the church does the speaking and by the brand said I like that rule and it's very fine so with that I guess so the brothers will hand out the ballots and vote okay well the accounting has taken place that's this is the interlude against you know realness we'll just have a song here what we're saying I have been blessed times we stand for a change of position it's 1229 up there so that's just saying that you might note on this that I've inserted an extra verse which was given to me by brother Faisal and it was a blessing so I will get into the third position and you'll see it but we've got a lot to be thankful for [Music] you know and it really strikes home when we see that it was on a video you know we've been blessed beyond measure in better general would put earlier we're rich and we're blessed and we need to demonstrate our thanks to God for what he's done for us but you know sometimes a question who's the most blessed us or them oh that are being persecuted let's just think about it but give God the glory for what he's doing for us when he wants so much all that he does [Music] even not so good to me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

the Lord Amen we've truly been blessed amen if you know look around you look like God has done for all of us as the body you know a 40 year pastor another 40 years to go maybe he's rolling his eyes in case you can't see but what God has done for us a revelation that we that God has given us he meets our needs he's given us a church you know we saw the report and grace that we can move ahead and expand you know just a lot of things I think we take for granted but I don't think we should seventeen people voted the results are in and all the names around the ballots on the ballot were voted in for 2020 so we thank the firm of coffee and sharp for taking care of the votes and doing the counting so before we go let's let's just sing because he lives I can face tomorrow 103 I think and but
