[38:42] your grace for this service Lord that
[38:43] you would encourage us and strengthen us
[38:45] this evening Lord for those that aren't
[38:47] here Lord I pray your grace to them each
[38:49] one in Jesus Christ's name we ask and
[38:51] pray amen then God bless you turn if you
[38:55] would to Genesis chapter 1 again Genesis
[38:58] 1 and one and good to be here again this
[39:00] evening Blanc and the boys got back just
[39:03] a couple hours ago so they're mostly
[39:06] sleeping I would imagine but uh we're
[39:08] thankful that they had a good trip and
[39:09] they came back safely I know brother
[39:11] Grant's got multiple exams this week so
[39:13] we want to remember him in prayer as
[39:15] well I I still remember those days even
[39:18] though it was 20 years ago 20 odd years
[39:20] ago amen it's never easy to go through
[39:23] exams in University and these things so
[39:25] we trust God will be with them and
[39:27] continue to bring him through amen
[39:29] Genesis chapter 1 says in the beginning
[39:32] God created the Heaven and the Earth and
[39:35] the Earth was without form and void and
[39:37] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[39:40] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[39:42] face of the waters amen God bless you
[39:45] you can have your seats this evening
[39:47] we're taking or continuing our series on
[39:49] the Holy Ghost but I want to start a
[39:51] another subtopic if you will on when the
[39:53] spirit moves and I'm sorry that I keep
[39:56] reusing so many script rures I feel like
[39:58] we've worn out John chap 1 already and
[40:00] now we're wearing out Genesis 1 but I
[40:02] believe that God's word just keeps
[40:04] opening up and it keeps opening up and
[40:06] you can read one portion it it means one
[40:09] thing and then you go focus on another
[40:10] portion it opens up another area and so
[40:12] I haven't been able to leave this and so
[40:14] until I can I'll I'll stay here amen but
[40:16] the word of God is Rich amen the word of
[40:18] God is Rich and so I believe we can keep
[40:20] coming to those things amen but you know
[40:23] I as I was studying in in Genesis 1 it
[40:25] always struck me how that this thought
[40:28] of how God moves into position when God
[40:30] gets ready to move it was in chaos it
[40:33] was in disorder it was in darkness it
[40:35] was when nothing was happening or moving
[40:38] and that's usually when God starts to
[40:39] move is when things look a little rough
[40:41] you know we can see that in the
[40:43] scripture so many times that God will
[40:44] let things get down to the very last
[40:47] moment to the very last day to the very
[40:50] last minute to the very last person and
[40:53] then he moves you I was talking with
[40:55] brother Ron Spencer this week and and he
[40:57] went on a 10-day hunting trip and he got
[41:00] his deer in the last 30 minutes of the
[41:02] last day that's kind of the way God
[41:05] tends to work in my case he didn't give
[41:07] me
[41:08] anything maybe he'll give me something
[41:10] later but isn't that just the way God
[41:13] moves God likes to wait until it looks
[41:16] like nothing can go the way he said it
[41:19] looks like nothing's lined up it looks
[41:21] like nothing's moving nothing's shaping
[41:23] nothing's molding nothing's changing and
[41:25] it's been that way for far too to Long
[41:28] everything is grafted it's grounded it's
[41:30] tied down nothing's going to change and
[41:32] then God steps on the scene and what
[41:34] happens is things change and and you
[41:37] know what he's doing amen God has this
[41:39] principle that he waits until it's
[41:41] obvious that there's nothing we can do
[41:44] and then he says now I'm here and so we
[41:46] can see that it's God that's doing the
[41:48] work not us that's doing the work amen
[41:50] and if we look at you know we would call
[41:52] that perhaps the trial of our faith but
[41:55] in the original in the origin of
[41:57] creation there was nobody to have faith
[42:00] there was no not nothing there was no
[42:02] person there was just
[42:04] stuff and so there was nothing to have
[42:06] faith and so whatever came out of that
[42:08] had to be the faith of God it had to be
[42:10] the work of God because they couldn't do
[42:12] anything for themselves and so God
[42:14] literally created the Earth for human
[42:16] life and if you look at verse two it
[42:18] doesn't even look remotely what God
[42:20] intended it to be it says God created
[42:22] the Heaven and the Earth and his
[42:24] intentions were for that Earth to
[42:26] produce life life to sustain life so
[42:29] that Humanity could be there and enjoy
[42:31] it but what God created is not reflected
[42:34] in what's there when you look at the
[42:36] Earth and you look at the heavens it
[42:38] does not look like what God intends it
[42:40] to be God's created way of bringing it
[42:42] into being in no way is what he intends
[42:45] it to be when he's finished with it
[42:47] that's not the way that God works amen
[42:49] and so it comes into existence and it's
[42:50] not in its final shape or condition God
[42:53] created it out of order in darkness and
[42:56] in chaos and without life why so that he
[42:59] could have a reason and purpose of being
[43:02] did you know that because God's not just
[43:04] a Creator but he's there to produce
[43:06] something he's there to to change it
[43:08] into something of his own thinking and
[43:10] of his own making and what was it that
[43:12] changed it it was the moving of the
[43:14] spirit on the face of the waters now we
[43:16] know that Waters always represents
[43:18] people so when you see this don't just
[43:20] think about the Earth but think about
[43:22] the way he works with us but what
[43:23] happens is that spirit of God moved on
[43:26] and it changed the atmosphere and then
[43:28] after that the word of God came forth we
[43:30] can see amen it came forth as a thought
[43:33] then it was spoken and it became the
[43:35] spoken word and then from there it
[43:37] became the reality of the word in
[43:39] creation amen but I I I touched on this
[43:41] last service and I want to reemphasize
[43:43] this I was joking a bit with the deacons
[43:46] did you did you catch last service that
[43:47] God is all about processes everything's
[43:50] a process and that's what I'm trying to
[43:52] really anchor down is that God does not
[43:54] look at time and God does not look at
[43:55] situations the way that we do we get in
[43:58] a hurry God's not in a hurry God's Got A
[44:01] Plan God's got a word he thinks it he
[44:04] speaks it and then he sits back and the
[44:06] Holy Spirit makes it happen God goes to
[44:08] work the power of God is behind his word
[44:11] but it's a process of time almost always
[44:14] now the actual event that we're looking
[44:16] for may happen in a split second but it
[44:18] takes a time and God allows it to be a
[44:20] time of waiting and a time of faith and
[44:22] these different things so that we grow
[44:24] and mature as we're going through this
[44:25] life amen but God had a work to do and
[44:28] that was part of his purpose and part of
[44:30] the reason for being in that beginning
[44:33] and now we'd think perhaps if we were
[44:34] God and we had all power and authority
[44:36] now this is just me maybe you'd be
[44:38] different but if we saw that Earth in
[44:40] its chaotic dark condition we wouldn't
[44:43] sit there and do a work of a thousand
[44:45] years we'd do a magical work of an
[44:47] immediate landscape plan that just went
[44:50] and Bam the Earth would be exactly the
[44:52] way we want we wanted it and the fiords
[44:54] would be there in Norway and we'd have
[44:56] the rugged coastline we'd have the
[44:57] beautiful Plains and everything and we
[44:59] just say we boom we'd speak it into
[45:00] existence that way we want it to happen
[45:02] immediately but God doesn't work that
[45:05] way amen maybe we we we go and we just
[45:08] snap our fingers and the animals would
[45:09] all come into existence but that's not
[45:12] the way that God said that he did it
[45:13] amen watch how God does it because God
[45:16] does it in a very particular process as
[45:19] the spirit of God moves it starts to
[45:21] show the process of how God works with
[45:23] us and with his people and we'll see
[45:25] that it happens all time and time time
[45:27] again through the Bible and so it ought
[45:28] to be the way that he's working in our
[45:30] day and I believe we can see that but
[45:32] the first thing that happens is the
[45:34] spirit of God moves and it moves over
[45:36] the waters that covered the Earth and
[45:38] then Watch What
[45:40] Happens it says God said let there be
[45:43] light so the spirit moves and then after
[45:46] the spirit moves the spoken word comes
[45:48] forth amen that's what happens now
[45:51] there's no declaration here when he says
[45:53] let there be light that light just went
[45:56] poof and came in into existence in fact
[45:58] quite the contrary there's a full hole
[46:00] in there that means there's a period
[46:02] there's a pause there's a time that's
[46:05] there where nothing happened or where
[46:08] things were happening but the effect
[46:10] wasn't completed immediately amen it
[46:14] says and then there was light so God
[46:17] says it we have a period of time and
[46:20] then there was light and I talked about
[46:22] this last service how when that light
[46:23] came into being and everything was dark
[46:25] in the universe there was no light and
[46:28] there was nothing and yet out of that
[46:30] there came just this one little spark
[46:33] and when that one spark came out
[46:35] Darkness lost the victory it only took a
[46:38] little spark to defeat Darkness it only
[46:40] took a a little spark to erase Darkness
[46:43] at least in that little bit but it
[46:45] started to whirl and it started to
[46:47] collect and it became the fullness of
[46:49] God it became the pillar of fire The
[46:52] Dwelling Place of God but it started
[46:54] with just that little tiny spark now the
[46:56] prop of God talks about this and I I
[46:58] want to just read this this evening he
[47:00] says now notice now he's look talking
[47:02] about in the beginning there's nothing
[47:05] there's just space there's no light
[47:07] there's no dark there's no nothing it
[47:10] just seems nothing but in there is a
[47:13] great supernatural being Jehovah God who
[47:17] covered all of space of all places at
[47:19] all times he was from Everlasting from
[47:22] Everlasting he's the beginning of
[47:23] creation that's God but he says you
[47:26] can't he see nothing you can hear
[47:28] nothing there's not a move of an atom in
[47:30] the air not nothing not no air no
[47:33] nothing but yet God was there he says
[47:37] that was God no man had seen that now
[47:39] that's father that's the father that's
[47:41] God the father but he says then after a
[47:45] while I begin to see a little sacred
[47:48] light begin to form there's a waiting
[47:52] and then there's a process of forming he
[47:54] says like a little Halo or something but
[47:57] you could only see it by spiritual eyes
[48:00] but look now while we're looking the
[48:02] whole church now we're standing on a
[48:04] great big banister watching what God's
[48:06] doing now no one has seen God and now
[48:09] the next thing we begin to see by eyes
[48:11] of Supernatural looking that's what
[48:14] matters Supernatural IE not naturalize
[48:17] Supernatural IE this is not the light
[48:19] that caused everything to come to life
[48:21] by sunlight this is the supernatural
[48:23] light of God you got to see it through a
[48:25] different set of eyes he see a we he
[48:28] says we see a little white light forming
[48:31] out there what is that he says that's
[48:33] called by Bible readers the logos or the
[48:36] anointed or the anointing the part of
[48:38] God begin to develop catch this phrase
[48:42] begin to develop it's just starting it's
[48:45] like a baby if you want to call that
[48:47] it's starting to form he says into
[48:50] something so human beings could have
[48:52] some type of an idea what it was it was
[48:55] a little light moving
[48:57] that was the word of God so a light
[48:59] begins to form it doesn't just bam and
[49:02] all of a sudden there's a pillar of fire
[49:03] is there that's not the way he says it
[49:05] happened it doesn't Thunder its way into
[49:07] reality it just after a period of time
[49:10] starts to happen and it happens as a
[49:13] process one minute there's nothing then
[49:15] the next minute there's a little bit of
[49:17] something but it's not the full thing
[49:18] yet and it just continues to slowly
[49:21] build and build and build into this Halo
[49:24] into this Pillar of Fire forming it self
[49:27] up the way that God had intended in his
[49:29] mind just one spark at a time one
[49:31] element of a time one piece at a time
[49:34] forming up into the picture that God saw
[49:37] then brother Bram says this he says God
[49:39] said over this dark and gloomy dismal
[49:42] Mossy world that stood here without
[49:44] light he said let there be light he said
[49:47] and it wasn't light until that word was
[49:51] manifested then it was light now in
[49:53] other words God said let there be light
[49:56] and maybe again we don't know maybe a
[49:58] lot of other things happened maybe there
[50:00] was this Supernatural wind that started
[50:02] to blow maybe there was great surges of
[50:05] electricity that that started to flow
[50:07] maybe there were loud
[50:09] booms but that wasn't
[50:12] light we might have thought that's light
[50:15] because light to this point hadn't
[50:16] existed if we were there in our humanity
[50:19] and we'd hear and see those things
[50:20] moving or or feel something we might say
[50:23] well that must be what he's talking
[50:24] about cuz there's an effect that's going
[50:26] dumb but that's not light what's light
[50:29] is when there is light and only God
[50:32] knows what light is because he's the one
[50:34] that had it in his mind and then he
[50:36] spoke it so when light comes he's the
[50:39] only one that can declare this is light
[50:42] he's the only one that gets to do that
[50:44] if I told you this evening to build me a
[50:47] multiphase bifurcated induction loop
[50:50] with a harmonic balancer for dynamic
[50:52] thermal load
[50:55] control you wouldn't know what that
[50:58] means to be fair I don't because I made
[51:00] it up that's why I had to read it
[51:02] off but I have something in my mind and
[51:05] even brother Matt with all his skill I
[51:07] could say brother Matt go build me that
[51:09] thing in your machine shelf and brother
[51:11] Matt would take everything he knows
[51:13] about all of those words I just put
[51:15] together and he might come out and then
[51:17] he would lay something on here and he'd
[51:18] say brother John there you go there it
[51:20] is but guess what he doesn't get to say
[51:23] that that's a multi face B for yeah
[51:26] whatever I said I get to say it because
[51:29] it's in my mind not in his mind I'm the
[51:32] one that defines what that thing is amen
[51:34] he might present me with his
[51:37] interpretation but that's not the
[51:40] truth I am the only one that knows what
[51:42] it is so when God said God's the same
[51:45] way God's like
[51:47] me no that's not what I'm saying but
[51:50] that's the way God is amen God saw in
[51:53] his mind what light was and what his
[51:56] interpret
[51:57] interpretation of what light is and he
[51:59] declared when light came actual light
[52:01] came he says there it is that's light
[52:04] and from that moment on that's what
[52:06] defin light we don't get to sit here and
[52:08] say no that's light or that's light or
[52:10] that's light God determined what's light
[52:12] and we have it today though we have this
[52:14] problem where people are determining who
[52:16] God is what God is what Christianity is
[52:18] what the word is what the word says and
[52:20] brother Bron would say God interprets
[52:22] his word how by bringing it to pass so
[52:26] that's the interpretation the
[52:27] interpretation is not what I think by
[52:30] all of my study and all of my prayer the
[52:32] interpretation is what God vindicates by
[52:34] bringing it to pass so when he said
[52:37] there was light that was God saying
[52:40] there's it that's exactly what I was
[52:42] talking about the scripture says that
[52:45] God saw the light that it was good and
[52:47] God divided the light from the darkness
[52:49] so God puts his creation into work now
[52:51] and it's to separate light from darkness
[52:54] and God called the day the light day and
[52:56] the Darkness he called night and the
[52:58] evening and the morning were the first
[52:59] day one day done and all God's done all
[53:03] God's done has created a supernatural
[53:05] body for himself to live in brother
[53:07] Braham says it might have taken a
[53:08] thousand years he says might have taken
[53:09] 800 years for that first Spark to come
[53:11] in remember the scripture says a day is
[53:14] as a thousand years and a thousand years
[53:15] as a day we don't know the actual span
[53:17] of time for this amen we don't know when
[53:20] that little light started to form but
[53:22] when it Formed it was formed perfectly
[53:24] and it was exactly as God has intended
[53:27] that's the way it happened amen but it's
[53:29] all a progression of God's plan amen God
[53:31] said that's good and then he got ready
[53:33] for day two and it was a progression of
[53:35] his plan he's just going one step at a
[53:37] time he's got a picture in his mind he's
[53:40] speaking it to produce the reality and
[53:43] then the brooding of the Holy Spirit now
[53:45] brings the reality of the word into the
[53:48] spoken word amen everything he does is
[53:50] with purpose it's according to a plan
[53:52] God doesn't just talk we've talked about
[53:54] this before God doesn't chitchat God God
[53:56] speaks with care and with wi wi with
[53:59] specific intent because everything he
[54:01] says is the word and it's got power
[54:03] behind it so whatever he says is going
[54:05] to happen brother Brown would say this
[54:07] he's talking about the the Reason God
[54:09] does things he says the spirit of God
[54:11] moved upon that water and said let there
[54:13] be lights God had a reason to do that
[54:15] for he's talking about lights now not
[54:17] the light the supernatural light now
[54:18] he's talking the sun moon and stars God
[54:21] had a reason to do that why because down
[54:24] beneath that water there were seeds that
[54:26] he had planted and it had to have that
[54:29] sunlight to make it live see God's not
[54:31] just making light for the sake of light
[54:33] God's making light because there's a
[54:35] need for the light for the rest of
[54:37] creation he says the first light that
[54:39] was ever given in the Earth was God's
[54:41] spoken word he says the first light that
[54:44] ever struck the Earth was God's spoken
[54:46] word he said let there be light and
[54:47] there was light and that turned Darkness
[54:49] into light in order to bring forth the
[54:51] creation of joy and life upon the Earth
[54:55] God's word is given and the spirit
[54:57] follows to bring creative
[55:00] power he says then the spirit of God as
[55:03] it moved with love and
[55:05] compassion he says at that great day the
[55:08] first day of the dawn of creation upon
[55:10] the Earth the Sun Rose and swept AC
[55:12] cross its rays and dried up the waters
[55:15] from the earth and made an atmosphere
[55:17] above and for the first time it was to
[55:20] bring joy and life to the Earth by a
[55:23] seed he says that was a great hour
[55:26] now this concept of seeds is critical to
[55:29] understand the word of God and brother
[55:30] Brandon preaches on this so many times
[55:33] amen he say he talk about the spoken
[55:35] word is the Original Seed and things
[55:37] like that but when you understand why a
[55:40] seed is critical to thinking it's
[55:42] because the seed is something that has
[55:44] potential that's all a seed is it's
[55:46] something that has potential when you
[55:48] have a seed you have nothing and yet you
[55:51] have everything when you have a seed
[55:53] amen You' take a little sunflower seed
[55:56] and there's a bunch of them in a
[55:57] person's hand maybe 10 or 12 sunflower
[55:59] seeds there and they're little tiny
[56:00] things little striped things but the
[56:02] potential for that seed is huge anybody
[56:06] here ever been to a sunflower plant
[56:08] farm no they had them in BC we've seen
[56:10] them when you look at what that
[56:12] sunflower can be it's huge they could be
[56:16] 12 14t tall and it starts with just that
[56:20] little tiny seed in your hand the seed
[56:23] is all about the potential amen but if
[56:25] you know what you have Hallelujah if you
[56:28] know what you have in your hands then
[56:31] you know that's all that's required for
[56:33] that potential to come out is for it to
[56:35] be placed in the right
[56:38] conditions that's all you know but if
[56:40] you can know what that is and you know
[56:42] what those conditions are you can have
[56:44] joy with the seed before the plant ever
[56:47] comes forward because you know that you
[56:49] know what the conditions are going to be
[56:51] and therefore you know the seed that you
[56:52] have will come to life amen there you
[56:55] can have great expectation you can have
[56:57] great joy you can have anticipation you
[56:59] can talk it up you can tell the kids
[57:01] wait till you see what this is going to
[57:03] be this is going to be as tall as our
[57:05] house and they say Ain't No Way mama
[57:06] ain't no way Daddy no believe me this is
[57:09] just a tiny sea but wait till you see
[57:11] what happens when it fully matures when
[57:12] it's put in the right conditions bam
[57:15] says this he says when God speaks
[57:16] anything he means it then there'll be so
[57:19] many things and such things and it was
[57:22] God said let there be light and light
[57:24] sprang from somewhere from the Creator
[57:26] God said let there be this and it was
[57:28] this let there be that and it was that
[57:30] he says what God Said is seeds and he
[57:32] says God's in his word now natural seeds
[57:36] have potential but it's a maybe or it's
[57:38] a maybe not I don't know if you've ever
[57:40] bought seeds from Dollarama they're
[57:42] definitely maybe or maybe not we planted
[57:44] a bunch of them but only some of them
[57:46] came out there's no guarantee they might
[57:48] have given you bad seeds but he saying
[57:50] God's seeds are different the word of
[57:52] God is different because they're not
[57:53] just potential they're certain they will
[57:57] come to life they will produce what God
[57:59] has said they'll produce the words can
[58:01] never fail they're yay and amen amen
[58:03] he's saying that God's in his word God's
[58:05] words are seeds that means those seeds
[58:08] cannot fail and we see what happens as
[58:10] we go through creation that there's this
[58:12] progression and on the second day he
[58:14] rolls back the waters and he creates an
[58:16] atmosphere to protect the Earth and
[58:18] that's so that when the sun rays come in
[58:20] then the heat can stay inside and the
[58:22] oxygen is there and it makes it stable
[58:24] and life sustaining without an
[58:26] atmosphere this world would be
[58:27] incredibly unstable but that atmosphere
[58:30] that's there now helps to lock in what's
[58:32] needed here and everything is in stages
[58:35] properly to sustain life God as he does
[58:38] one part it's for the next part and as
[58:40] he does the next part it's for the next
[58:42] part and he's doing it all because once
[58:44] God does something he doesn't tend to
[58:46] kill it or undo it it's there to produce
[58:49] a particular effect amen and as he
[58:51] creates things the moving of the Spirit
[58:53] by the word of God brings each stage
[58:56] managed Le to or it stag perfectly to
[58:59] its intended place and position and then
[59:02] God can move forward day after day after
[59:04] day what is it it's the spirit of God
[59:06] moving by his word that's what he's
[59:08] doing to produce the thought to produce
[59:11] the reality to produce the image that's
[59:13] in God's mind that's the purpose of the
[59:15] holy spirit it's the power it's the
[59:17] enforcer it's the creation of God that's
[59:21] what it's there to do it's to produce
[59:23] what the word says you ought to know why
[59:25] you have the Holy GH this evening is to
[59:27] produce what the word says yeah there's
[59:29] lots of benefits there's lots of gifts
[59:31] there's lots of U moves there's lots of
[59:33] emotion and all those things but the
[59:35] purpose of the holy spirit is to change
[59:38] things it's to mold things it's to grow
[59:40] things it's to mature things it's to
[59:41] shape things to bring them into what God
[59:44] has declared it takes the picture from
[59:46] God's mind and it produces it down here
[59:49] that's what the Holy Spirit does so when
[59:50] you have the Holy Spirit what's it
[59:52] trying to do trying to get you to catch
[59:54] the thought and the image of God by his
[59:56] word so that it can produce it in your
[59:58] life that's what he's supposed to be
[1:00:00] doing he's supposed to be bringing the
[1:00:02] reality of the word now the scripture
[1:00:04] says the spirit of God moved on the face
[1:00:06] of the waters and we talked about that
[1:00:08] word move a couple Services ago and it
[1:00:10] means to relax to brood to grow soft and
[1:00:14] to hover and that word move has the same
[1:00:17] meaning as that word overshadow of when
[1:00:20] the Holy Spirit overshadow Mary to
[1:00:22] produce Jesus Christ in her womb now
[1:00:24] when the Holy Spirit overshadow Mary
[1:00:27] what did it produce did it produce a
[1:00:30] man did it produce
[1:00:32] a a 9-month-old baby said it could be
[1:00:35] born immediately no what did it produce
[1:00:38] It produced a word seed and It produced
[1:00:41] a fertilized egg and it took it and it
[1:00:43] placed it inside of Mary but notice when
[1:00:46] it did it the scripture says when the
[1:00:48] fullness of time in other words when God
[1:00:51] decided Now's the Time that's when it
[1:00:53] happened and until the fullness of time
[1:00:56] the Holy Spirit did not move there were
[1:00:58] lots of virgins around there was lots of
[1:01:00] Israelites around there was lots of good
[1:01:02] girls around but the Holy Spirit wasn't
[1:01:04] brooding because the word was not ready
[1:01:06] to go yet but as soon as God said it's
[1:01:08] time to go he sends forth his Spirit now
[1:01:11] and what does it do it goes and it
[1:01:13] starts brooding over the Earth and it
[1:01:15] finds a ground for that seed to be
[1:01:17] placed in
[1:01:20] amen and it doesn't create it like I
[1:01:22] said as a full grown man rather it it
[1:01:25] goes and does exactly what the word said
[1:01:27] what did the word say a virgin shall
[1:01:29] conceive so what does the Holy Spirit go
[1:01:32] and do it goes and looks for a virgin so
[1:01:35] there has to be a virgin there right the
[1:01:37] God says it's time the holy spirit says
[1:01:39] okay it starts to brood over the Earth
[1:01:41] because it's looking to produce the word
[1:01:42] of God in human flesh and so it goes
[1:01:44] looking for human flesh that's ready for
[1:01:46] the word to be produced in it now I want
[1:01:49] you to notice something cuz Mary is
[1:01:51] everything the word said she would be
[1:01:54] what did the word say she would be
[1:01:56] it would be a she it would be a virgin
[1:02:00] and it would be a woman of
[1:02:02] Israel okay that was a requirement so
[1:02:05] everything the word declared of Mary was
[1:02:08] in Mary she had never been intimate with
[1:02:10] a man she was not yet fully married amen
[1:02:13] and so she has the potential by her
[1:02:16] characteristics to produce the word
[1:02:19] everything the word needs is in Mary
[1:02:22] except that seed amen but until the
[1:02:25] spirit of God God moves on her she
[1:02:27] cannot produce a messiah she is no less
[1:02:31] qualified the day before as it was the
[1:02:33] day of and she's no more qualified the
[1:02:36] day after it happened than the day that
[1:02:38] it happened she was the same all the way
[1:02:41] through the potential was there but it
[1:02:43] took the moving of the spirit for her to
[1:02:45] be the Virgin that shall
[1:02:48] conceive everything was in her amen her
[1:02:50] attitude was right she was exactly what
[1:02:52] the word required her attitude was right
[1:02:54] her spirit was right her body was right
[1:02:57] her life was right her Doctrine was
[1:03:00] right everything about her was perfect
[1:03:02] to produce the word but no matter her
[1:03:05] sincerity no matter how much she read
[1:03:07] the Torah no matter how much she went to
[1:03:09] church no matter how hard she prayed she
[1:03:12] could not produce the Messiah until the
[1:03:15] spirit
[1:03:16] moved are you catching the message this
[1:03:19] evening everything can be in place but
[1:03:22] it takes the moving of the spirit of God
[1:03:24] to produce the word
[1:03:27] amen but all she was doing yes she read
[1:03:30] the Torah yes she went to the synagogue
[1:03:32] yes she kept her life clean but what was
[1:03:34] that doing it was getting her in a
[1:03:37] condition and then maintaining her in a
[1:03:39] condition to receive the word when the
[1:03:41] spirit of God moved that's what was
[1:03:43] happening amen and when the spirit of
[1:03:45] God moved in her It produced the word in
[1:03:48] her flesh she had made herself ready but
[1:03:51] that was just preparing for it amen that
[1:03:53] wasn't the Dynamics
[1:03:55] that's not the Dynamics amen this is not
[1:03:58] the Dynamics necessarily we're setting
[1:04:01] things in order we're getting ready when
[1:04:05] we read our Bible when we pray when we
[1:04:07] go to church when we're under the
[1:04:08] hearing of the word yes the Holy Spirit
[1:04:10] can be moving but the Dynamics is the
[1:04:12] life of it not the letter of it amen so
[1:04:16] all that she was doing was getting
[1:04:18] herself in a place where she could
[1:04:20] receive what the word had for her amen
[1:04:23] that's what we're trying to do we're
[1:04:24] trying to get ourselves in position so
[1:04:26] that when God moves in our midst we can
[1:04:29] believe it we can receive it we can
[1:04:31] accept it we can act on it we can let it
[1:04:34] change us because it's trying to produce
[1:04:36] the word in our life amen we can look at
[1:04:38] the creation story and it's a wonderful
[1:04:41] thing but in the end of it God wanted a
[1:04:43] man to be a part of
[1:04:45] it remember Adam was in spirit form he
[1:04:49] was outside of it but God after that
[1:04:52] seventh day came down and he created a
[1:04:54] body for that man so could have a part
[1:04:56] in the reality of creation and then God
[1:04:59] said go down there take Dominion take
[1:05:01] control you're made in my image you're
[1:05:03] meant to rule this Earth and he made man
[1:05:05] a God on this Earth but man fell from
[1:05:08] that and if there's one thing we can see
[1:05:10] today after 6,000 years it's the
[1:05:12] depravity of men we have completely
[1:05:14] Fallen mankind has fallen completely
[1:05:17] from those things and we have so many
[1:05:18] dreams and hopes and good intentions and
[1:05:21] all of these things but no matter how
[1:05:22] much we're thinking we're getting ahead
[1:05:24] we're always shooting ourselves in the
[1:05:25] foot
[1:05:26] that's just the way it seems to work
[1:05:27] amen listen you want to look at at Good
[1:05:30] Intentions look at Israel Israel is the
[1:05:33] epitome of Good Intentions in sinful
[1:05:36] flesh good intentions don't get us
[1:05:38] anywhere
[1:05:39] Church why cuz it's mechanics it's not
[1:05:42] Dynamics amen you want to see the
[1:05:44] realities of human nature look at Israel
[1:05:46] they were a chosen people a chosen
[1:05:49] lineage came from a man chosen by God
[1:05:52] grew through the families God said that
[1:05:54] you are you have been chosen to serve me
[1:05:57] I've picked you I love you I'll protect
[1:06:00] you I'll give you a land where you can
[1:06:02] worship me I'll give you Victory I'll
[1:06:04] give you healing I'll keep all of these
[1:06:07] things that everyone else suffers with
[1:06:08] away from your door if you'll just stay
[1:06:11] with me and you know what they did
[1:06:14] everything but what God told them to do
[1:06:16] with all of the Good Intentions they
[1:06:18] just went to hell in a hand basket
[1:06:20] because what they started looking around
[1:06:22] at what what everybody else had they
[1:06:24] started looking at other religion other
[1:06:26] gods other political systems other
[1:06:27] entertainments other ways of worship
[1:06:30] they went looking for something that was
[1:06:32] more fun that was more sensual was more
[1:06:34] pleasing to their mind more pleasing to
[1:06:36] their body and all it did was it took
[1:06:38] them completely out of the will and the
[1:06:39] word of God and they lost every single
[1:06:42] blessing that they had you know it was
[1:06:44] amazing I was listening I don't know why
[1:06:47] I do this I've been listening to some of
[1:06:49] these cessationist preachers and they
[1:06:52] said it's clear as you look through
[1:06:55] history that the Holy Spirit backed away
[1:06:58] from the
[1:06:59] church and what they do is they say
[1:07:01] that's because God didn't want it to
[1:07:06] continue can you believe that that's
[1:07:08] like going and looking at Israel and
[1:07:10] saying they lost the blessings because
[1:07:12] God didn't want them to continue God
[1:07:15] gives all the blessings on the day of
[1:07:17] Pentecost he gives his very life to the
[1:07:19] church his power his authority his
[1:07:21] leadership and they say God didn't want
[1:07:24] that because all they're looking at is
[1:07:25] the signs and wonders and they forget
[1:07:28] how those signs and wonders came it was
[1:07:30] by the leadership of the holy spirit in
[1:07:32] the local
[1:07:34] congregation and so they look and they
[1:07:35] say it's clear by history that God
[1:07:37] pulled away but they say that's the will
[1:07:40] of God rather than looking in the word
[1:07:42] and saying what does the word say
[1:07:45] happened because you can go in
[1:07:46] Revelation 2 and it says they left their
[1:07:49] first love that wolves have come in in
[1:07:52] sheep's clothing that they have put the
[1:07:54] Holy Spirit out of the church and
[1:07:57] because they put him out he could do no
[1:07:59] Works in their midst but that doesn't
[1:08:02] mean he didn't have a work and it
[1:08:04] doesn't mean signs and wonders weren't
[1:08:06] there it was just in such small portion
[1:08:07] that they can't see it but God always
[1:08:09] had a witness God always had somebody
[1:08:11] full of the Holy Ghost but they can go
[1:08:13] and they can see in Revelation 2 and
[1:08:15] Revelation three why God pulled back
[1:08:17] from the church and why those signs and
[1:08:19] wonders weren't there why cuz they
[1:08:20] booted him out and so today they sit
[1:08:23] there and they say absolutely it is not
[1:08:25] there anymore why because Christ is
[1:08:27] completely outside of the church
[1:08:29] knocking trying to get back in but all
[1:08:31] they can say is that's the will of God
[1:08:33] rather than saying how did we lose what
[1:08:34] God gave
[1:08:36] freely they can't see it but they could
[1:08:39] look at Israel and they can say well
[1:08:40] Israel they lost it because they walked
[1:08:42] away from the word but they come to
[1:08:44] their lives and their denominations and
[1:08:46] they say no no we haven't walked away
[1:08:47] from the word therefore it's God's
[1:08:49] choosing to pull away his Spirit from us
[1:08:51] what nonsense what nonsense amen
[1:08:56] they had forgotten how good they had it
[1:08:59] can you imagine they came into the land
[1:09:02] of Canaan and they say it took about 10
[1:09:04] seven or 10 years to wipe out the whole
[1:09:06] thing and then there was peace in the
[1:09:07] land and all they had to do was keep
[1:09:10] doing what they were doing that's all
[1:09:12] God said keep doing what you're doing
[1:09:15] follow my word and you'll you'll have
[1:09:17] the land forever and they just wouldn't
[1:09:20] do it and we can look in the Book of
[1:09:22] Ezekiel and we can see God showing his
[1:09:24] Prophet the condition of the people
[1:09:26] through his eyes I was studying this I
[1:09:28] thought you know it's good for us to see
[1:09:29] things through God's eyes
[1:09:31] sometimes sometimes we need to lift our
[1:09:32] eyes a little higher Amen to see the big
[1:09:35] picture sometimes we need to be
[1:09:37] humbled sometimes we need to be humbled
[1:09:40] we need to step back and say okay I'm
[1:09:42] going to be me and I'm going to let God
[1:09:43] be God because we're so dialed into
[1:09:46] things that we think we're going to make
[1:09:47] it happen but we need to step back and
[1:09:50] see it the way that God does humility
[1:09:51] gets us a lot further with God than our
[1:09:53] big visions and ideas that's for sure
[1:09:55] but in Ezekiel 37 remember Ezekiel 36 is
[1:09:58] where he saysi give you a new heart I'll
[1:10:00] give you a new spirit and I'll place my
[1:10:01] spirit within you he gives those that
[1:10:04] that wonderful promise and then look at
[1:10:06] what he shows the prophet Ezekiel he
[1:10:09] shows him the true condition of the
[1:10:11] people and it says the hand of the Lord
[1:10:13] was upon me this is Ezekiel the prophet
[1:10:15] and it carried me out in the spirit of
[1:10:17] the Lord so the spirit of the Lord moves
[1:10:19] on the Prophet The Prophet doesn't move
[1:10:21] himself he can't make this happen but it
[1:10:23] takes the spirit moving for this to
[1:10:25] happen he says and he set me down in the
[1:10:28] midst of the valley which was full of
[1:10:30] Bones and caused me to pass by them
[1:10:33] round about and behold there were very
[1:10:36] many in the open Valley and lo they were
[1:10:38] very dry very many very dry and he tells
[1:10:42] Ezekiel go walk in them so we get this
[1:10:44] this wonderful picture of Ezekiel in the
[1:10:47] valley of dry bones now if we're looking
[1:10:49] at that picture Church where's the
[1:10:52] Hope where's the life
[1:10:57] there's none we're not talking about
[1:10:59] people that are starving people that are
[1:11:02] thirsty people that are weak we're
[1:11:04] talking about people that are not just
[1:11:06] dead they've dead they've been
[1:11:08] completely decayed and their bones are
[1:11:11] scattered they're all mixed up they're
[1:11:14] all jumbled up there's no Discerning
[1:11:16] what bones belong to which person
[1:11:18] anymore they're dead and there's a lot
[1:11:20] of them there's very many of them and
[1:11:21] they're very dry they've been in that
[1:11:23] condition for a really long time
[1:11:26] no hope
[1:11:28] amen and yet these people have a promise
[1:11:31] of God being their God of being his
[1:11:34] chosen elect people with a land where he
[1:11:36] would show them that he was their God
[1:11:39] and look at their
[1:11:40] condition do you see a
[1:11:44] disconnect no
[1:11:46] hope these aren't people that are
[1:11:48] sleeping these aren't people that are
[1:11:50] sick these aren't people that are dying
[1:11:52] these are people that are dead and
[1:11:53] they've been dead for a a long time no
[1:11:57] hope amen they're in a completely
[1:12:00] lifeless hopeless condition and they're
[1:12:03] the opposite condition of what God told
[1:12:05] them they should be they're also the
[1:12:07] opposite of what God said they would
[1:12:09] be now Watch What Happens watch how this
[1:12:12] unfolds cuz what hope do they have
[1:12:15] church none there is no hope in their
[1:12:18] condition they're lost and it seems
[1:12:20] there's no coming back but God said unto
[1:12:23] him son of man can these bones
[1:12:26] live and I answered oh Lord God thou
[1:12:30] knowest that's the right answer God you
[1:12:32] know I can't tell you Church how many
[1:12:34] things I've prayed about and I'm praying
[1:12:36] about and I know for a fact that I don't
[1:12:38] have the facts I don't know the root of
[1:12:41] the issues I don't know what's going on
[1:12:42] in people's lives and in the end I have
[1:12:44] to just back away and say God you're the
[1:12:46] one that knows cuz I'm not looking to
[1:12:49] change the situation I'm looking to find
[1:12:51] the will of God because when I can find
[1:12:54] the will of God I can have peace and
[1:12:56] rest no matter which way it goes amen
[1:12:59] I'm not here to try and change the mind
[1:13:00] of God I'm trying to catch the mind of
[1:13:02] God and sometimes that starts with me
[1:13:04] saying I don't have a clue I have I can
[1:13:08] I can honestly say I've prayed at times
[1:13:09] I've said Lord here's what I see here's
[1:13:12] what I think but I have no clue if this
[1:13:14] is right so I said Lord would you show
[1:13:17] me what's going on show me what you want
[1:13:19] me to do show me how this is supposed to
[1:13:21] play out and guess what he works he
[1:13:24] works when I say I don't know I think I
[1:13:27] do I think I might but I don't really
[1:13:29] know but now Ezekiel he's smart enough
[1:13:32] here he says listen God I have no clue
[1:13:34] you
[1:13:36] know again he said unto me prophesy upon
[1:13:39] these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry
[1:13:42] Bones hear the word of the Lord Church
[1:13:45] they don't have any
[1:13:47] ears they don't have ears they don't
[1:13:49] have a brain to receive it I don't care
[1:13:51] how great that Bell tones heing AIDS are
[1:13:53] it won't work on Bones
[1:13:55] but yet he says bones hear it
[1:13:58] anyways why cuz God's looking at this a
[1:14:01] different way than we do he's not
[1:14:03] relying on their ears he's relying on
[1:14:05] something Supernatural to happen when he
[1:14:06] speaks amen but watch what happens when
[1:14:09] the spirit of God moves what does it do
[1:14:12] it brings the word of the Lord somebody
[1:14:15] can come in and they'll say the God is
[1:14:18] has given me a gift that God has told me
[1:14:20] to do something let me tell you this
[1:14:22] when God sends a person he sends them
[1:14:24] with his word
[1:14:26] he always sends a message he doesn't
[1:14:28] send Just A Sign he sends a message with
[1:14:30] the sign amen we know that's the way go
[1:14:32] that God works amen but it's there to
[1:14:35] make the word a reality amen it's
[1:14:37] bringing the word of God in power now
[1:14:40] there are benefits and gifts that come
[1:14:42] with this but that is not
[1:14:45] life that is not life amen if all we
[1:14:48] want from the holy spirit is signs and
[1:14:50] wonders and dancing and tongues and
[1:14:52] emotion we're missing out on the main
[1:14:54] event
[1:14:55] because what he's come to do is bring
[1:14:57] life
[1:14:58] abundantly right not just noise not just
[1:15:01] benefits not just gifts amen Paul said
[1:15:04] signs or tongues will end he said
[1:15:07] prophecy will end he said gifts will
[1:15:09] fail he says but there's only one thing
[1:15:12] that won't fail and that's the word of
[1:15:13] God that's what the spirit of God always
[1:15:15] comes with is the word of God because
[1:15:17] it's the only thing that can't fail and
[1:15:20] he says thus sayeth the Lord God unto
[1:15:22] these bones behold I will cause breath
[1:15:25] to enter into you and you shall live who
[1:15:27] are we going to believe tonight
[1:15:30] church if we look at this picture that's
[1:15:33] what our eyes are going to tell us when
[1:15:35] our kids leave the church when our
[1:15:37] spouse is struggling when our health is
[1:15:39] failing when our finances are rough when
[1:15:41] our job isn't working
[1:15:43] out we can look and we can see dry
[1:15:47] bones but that's not what God's looking
[1:15:50] at we got to see it through his eyes
[1:15:52] we've got to see it through the seed
[1:15:54] potential of the word of God not through
[1:15:57] what we see visually
[1:16:00] amen he says I I will come cause breath
[1:16:03] to enter to you and you shall live how
[1:16:07] is God going to do this he says I'm
[1:16:10] going to make you live I'm going to put
[1:16:11] my breath but watch what he says I'm
[1:16:13] going to do it through a
[1:16:15] process I'm not going to just snap my
[1:16:17] fingers and it's going to happen I'm
[1:16:18] going to do this in stages see the
[1:16:21] problem we have so many times is we know
[1:16:23] what's coming at the end but we wanted
[1:16:25] at the
[1:16:27] beginning that's not the way God works
[1:16:29] amen God works to build to edify to
[1:16:33] mature to establish and that's to make
[1:16:35] sure that when we get to the end and the
[1:16:38] life is there we've got the character
[1:16:40] that's required to use that character or
[1:16:42] to use that power we cannot jump to the
[1:16:45] front of the line that's why a pastor
[1:16:48] can't be a novice that's why we don't
[1:16:50] put people into positions of authority
[1:16:52] with no
[1:16:53] experience they're trying to do it today
[1:16:55] with all these initiatives at work in
[1:16:57] that and all it does is destroys a group
[1:16:59] it destroys a company it destroys an
[1:17:01] organization cuz you got to be proven
[1:17:03] before you can get there God's trying to
[1:17:05] do a work amen God wants us to get to
[1:17:08] the end and have a sure foundation with
[1:17:10] a proven character and a faith that
[1:17:12] trusts his word that's what he's trying
[1:17:14] to do amen otherwise you can walk in
[1:17:16] with a natural desire for the things of
[1:17:18] God Cain had a natural desire for the
[1:17:20] things of God and guess where he got
[1:17:23] nowhere it takes a work of faith that
[1:17:25] takes God to come into our lives amen
[1:17:28] and watch this process he says yes I'm
[1:17:30] going to put breath in you but I will
[1:17:31] lay Senus upon you and will bring flesh
[1:17:34] upon you and cover you with skin and put
[1:17:37] breath in you and you shall live and ye
[1:17:39] shall know that I am the Lord why
[1:17:41] because when we started out we couldn't
[1:17:43] do anything and in the end we're a
[1:17:45] living breathing epitome of the word of
[1:17:47] God and we know it's his work not mine
[1:17:49] cuz when he started I didn't have life I
[1:17:51] didn't have breath I didn't have skin I
[1:17:53] didn't have flesh I didn't have muscles
[1:17:55] I didn't have organs I was nothing when
[1:17:57] he started with me and now I'm something
[1:18:00] I'm alive why it's his work I know that
[1:18:02] he's the
[1:18:05] Lord Ezekiel says so I prophesied as I
[1:18:08] was commanded and as I prophesied there
[1:18:11] was a noise and behold a shaking and the
[1:18:14] bones came together bone to his bone
[1:18:17] church that's a miracle that's a miracle
[1:18:19] when the bones come to his bones not
[1:18:22] just to the right one but to the right
[1:18:24] place
[1:18:25] this whole valley of Bones is being put
[1:18:27] into order now what's the skeleton of a
[1:18:30] Believer it's always
[1:18:32] Doctrine amen Doctrine is the foundation
[1:18:35] it's the structure of a Believer amen
[1:18:37] that's what keeps us in line it's the
[1:18:39] truth and letter form but remember the
[1:18:41] skeleton is not life nor is it a body
[1:18:44] it's just something that keeps
[1:18:46] everything together Doctrine doesn't
[1:18:47] make us a
[1:18:49] Christian doesn't make us a Christian
[1:18:51] but it sets us in order
[1:18:54] it puts us in line with the word of God
[1:18:56] Amen now notice the moving of the spirit
[1:19:00] is not life notice when the spirit moves
[1:19:04] here there is a noise and a
[1:19:06] shaking lots of things are happening
[1:19:09] when the spirit moves but that's not
[1:19:12] life I was just listening this this uh
[1:19:15] this morning to brother bradam on on the
[1:19:17] Mighty God unveiled and he's telling
[1:19:19] that story about that Lutheran Minister
[1:19:21] maybe it wasn't in that it might have
[1:19:22] been something else I was
[1:19:23] studying either way and that Lutheran
[1:19:26] Minister comes to him and he's pointing
[1:19:27] at the Pentecostals and and they're
[1:19:29] hooping and they're hollering and
[1:19:30] they're dancing they're running up and
[1:19:31] down the aisles and that and he says
[1:19:33] brother Bram do you believe that's the
[1:19:35] real Holy Ghost and brother Bram said
[1:19:37] yes he said cuz when the bones come
[1:19:39] together there's a noise and there's a
[1:19:41] shaking he says that doesn't mean that
[1:19:43] all of it is but there's always a noise
[1:19:46] when he
[1:19:47] moves don't throw out the noise don't
[1:19:50] get cold and starchy and
[1:19:52] formal amen we ought to rejoice when the
[1:19:55] spirit of God moves but that is not life
[1:19:58] it's just evidence of his presence
[1:20:00] potentially potentially
[1:20:04] amen so we have this wonderful thing and
[1:20:07] what happens is the church is coming
[1:20:08] into order the word is being restored
[1:20:12] but they're just
[1:20:13] skeletons it's a it's in a way better
[1:20:16] condition than it was but it's not alive
[1:20:18] yet it says and when I beheld lo the
[1:20:21] Senus and flesh Came Upon them and the
[1:20:23] skin covered them above so now these
[1:20:25] skeletons have become bodies they've got
[1:20:27] Senus they've got muscles they've got
[1:20:29] skin they've got organs now these things
[1:20:32] look like bodies they look like real
[1:20:34] people they've been restored to their
[1:20:36] original condition they've got hair and
[1:20:38] skin and all of these things
[1:20:40] everything's in order everything's in
[1:20:42] place these are men and women and
[1:20:44] children and there's potential there for
[1:20:46] life but they are not yet alive and yet
[1:20:48] the spirit is
[1:20:50] moving this is absolutely a work of a
[1:20:53] spirit amen there's set and they're
[1:20:55] ready to be quickened to life it's a
[1:20:58] sanctification process we could say
[1:21:00] they're ready to go but being set in
[1:21:02] order is not life it just means you're
[1:21:06] ready for
[1:21:07] life it says then he said unto me
[1:21:10] prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of
[1:21:13] man and say to the wind thus sayeth the
[1:21:15] Lord God come from the Four Winds o
[1:21:17] breath and breathe upon these slain that
[1:21:20] they may left that they may live now
[1:21:22] watch how the word is coming now does
[1:21:24] Ezekiel have anything here of his own
[1:21:28] when life comes it has nothing to do
[1:21:30] with Ezekiel his thoughts aren't present
[1:21:32] his opinions aren't present all that he
[1:21:34] is is a microphone for what the spirit
[1:21:36] of God is saying he repeats it exactly
[1:21:39] as he is told to do it amen he is fully
[1:21:42] surrendered to what God tells him the
[1:21:45] spirit's moving and he's repeating it
[1:21:47] and notice even as these things start
[1:21:49] happening he knows what's going to
[1:21:51] happen but he never jumps ahead of the
[1:21:53] spirit
[1:21:55] he stays right in line with it time and
[1:21:57] time again there's three
[1:21:59] phases amen there's three poles and he
[1:22:03] never gets ahead he stays with the
[1:22:06] spirit every single time amen he staying
[1:22:10] with God's timing he's not trying to get
[1:22:12] ahead even though he knows what has to
[1:22:14] happen he doesn't get ahead it says so I
[1:22:17] prophesied as he commanded me he says
[1:22:21] and the breath came into them and they
[1:22:23] lived and stood up up upon their feet an
[1:22:26] exceeding great Army then he said unto
[1:22:28] me son of man these bones are the whole
[1:22:30] house of Israel behold they
[1:22:35] say these are our words
[1:22:38] Church our bones are dried and our hope
[1:22:41] is lost and we are caught cut off for
[1:22:44] our
[1:22:45] parts isn't that our testimony
[1:22:48] sometimes when we look at the situation
[1:22:51] and we say it's
[1:22:52] hopeless it ain't happened yet it's not
[1:22:55] going to happen nothing's changing in
[1:22:58] fact I'm getting more dry my bones are
[1:23:00] getting more
[1:23:01] scattered it seems like nothing's
[1:23:04] happening that was their testimony but
[1:23:07] that was not God's
[1:23:08] word he said therefore prophesy and say
[1:23:11] unto them thus sayeth the Lord remember
[1:23:14] there's what we say and there was what
[1:23:16] he says Church what holds the power here
[1:23:19] the power is not in what I think about
[1:23:21] myself the power is not in my condition
[1:23:23] the power is not in my failures and
[1:23:25] faults the power is in thus saith the
[1:23:29] Lord he says thus sayith the Lord God
[1:23:32] behold oh my people oh my people and
[1:23:35] they're scattered they're dead their
[1:23:37] bones are spread all over the place
[1:23:39] there's no life in them he says they're
[1:23:41] still my people they were his people
[1:23:43] when they were in their fallen condition
[1:23:45] and they're his people when they're in
[1:23:46] their living condition they were his
[1:23:48] people all along he says oh my people I
[1:23:51] will open your Graves and cause you to
[1:23:53] come out of your Graves and bring you
[1:23:54] into the land of Israel and ye shall
[1:23:56] know that I am the Lord when I have
[1:23:58] opened your Graves oh my people and
[1:24:00] brought you up out of your Graves and I
[1:24:03] shall and shall put my spirit in you and
[1:24:06] you shall live and I shall place you in
[1:24:08] your own land then ye shall know that
[1:24:11] the Lord have I the Lord have spoken it
[1:24:13] and performed it sayeth the Lord now we
[1:24:16] look at that story and we say that's for
[1:24:17] Israel and it is for Israel amen but we
[1:24:20] also know it hasn't happened yet this
[1:24:23] has not been fulfilled in isra and then
[1:24:25] we know that on the day of Pentecost a
[1:24:26] select few of the Israelites of the Jews
[1:24:29] got the promise of this because the
[1:24:31] promise of this is really the Holy Ghost
[1:24:33] that's the spirit of God Amen that's
[1:24:35] what it was intended for but they have
[1:24:36] not had that mass acceptance they do not
[1:24:38] have a great Army yet that's going to
[1:24:41] happen in the
[1:24:42] tribulation that's going to happen in
[1:24:44] the Millennium that's when they're going
[1:24:45] to have this this grand time they don't
[1:24:49] have it yet we're the ones that have
[1:24:51] this because remember we are Abraham's
[1:24:53] seed by faith
[1:24:55] and so the thing is what they are to
[1:24:57] receive we are to receive but if that
[1:24:59] means that we also must be in the
[1:25:01] condition they are in in order to
[1:25:02] receive the promise that there's to
[1:25:04] receive because we have to start out the
[1:25:06] same way that they did amen if we are
[1:25:08] going to receive the same promise we
[1:25:09] must be in the same condition if they
[1:25:11] need this to happen then we need this to
[1:25:13] happen if I can put it that way amen we
[1:25:15] might not need it now but we needed it
[1:25:17] at some point amen they were dead dried
[1:25:20] out scattered lost completely unable to
[1:25:22] change their situation and guess what we
[1:25:24] are the exactly the same way Paul would
[1:25:26] say in Ephesians 2 he says and you hath
[1:25:28] he quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:25:30] and sin now we got to get past this idea
[1:25:33] of life means having breath that is not
[1:25:36] what this means it doesn't say who are
[1:25:39] who are who are not breathing because of
[1:25:41] trespasses and sins amen you can be
[1:25:43] alive and dead at the same time listen
[1:25:46] before the New Birth we are alive but
[1:25:50] we're dead and after the New Birth we're
[1:25:53] dead but alive you can unpack that later
[1:25:55] when you have some time right now if
[1:25:57] we're unsaved then we are alive but dead
[1:26:00] and then after the New Birth we're dead
[1:26:02] but we're
[1:26:03] alive amen but what's Paul saying here
[1:26:06] he's saying every single one of us are
[1:26:08] born under conditions that are not
[1:26:10] conducive to life not a single one of us
[1:26:14] not a single one of us amen doesn't
[1:26:15] matter how religious amen we are it
[1:26:18] doesn't make a difference this is our
[1:26:20] without form and void condition just
[1:26:22] like the world was there's nothing there
[1:26:24] that's alive amen it was like the Earth
[1:26:26] in the beginning everything that needs
[1:26:28] to be there is there but there's no life
[1:26:30] yet the conditions aren't right he says
[1:26:33] wherein in time pass ye walked according
[1:26:35] to the course of this world according to
[1:26:37] the prince of the power of the air the
[1:26:39] spirit that now worketh in the children
[1:26:40] of Disobedience I remember as a young
[1:26:42] man before I gave my heart to the Lord I
[1:26:44] was sneaking at things and I was
[1:26:46] listening to things and I was watching
[1:26:47] things I shouldn't hey I was a good
[1:26:49] little Christian boy but I was still a
[1:26:52] child of Disobedience Church and don't
[1:26:55] believe me I understand with my children
[1:26:57] and you ought to understand with yours
[1:26:58] until they receive the Holy Ghost
[1:27:00] they're
[1:27:01] here so don't fool yourself into
[1:27:04] thinking your kids are good kids they
[1:27:06] are under a spirit of Disobedience to
[1:27:09] the word of God I know that by
[1:27:11] experience it takes the Holy Ghost to
[1:27:13] change that amen he says among whom also
[1:27:17] we all that means there's no exceptions
[1:27:20] no it doesn't matter how religious we
[1:27:21] are it doesn't matter how Holy Ghost
[1:27:23] filled our parents are we all had our
[1:27:25] conversation we all had our way of life
[1:27:27] in Times past in the lust of our flesh
[1:27:30] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[1:27:32] of the Mind notice there's a twin there
[1:27:35] the Flesh and the mind amen the desires
[1:27:37] of this flesh our body craves certain
[1:27:39] things you get a taste of sugar you get
[1:27:41] a taste of chocolate sometime guess what
[1:27:44] it wants it I love my Donuts I love my
[1:27:47] chips I love my cookies I love my cake I
[1:27:49] love my
[1:27:50] icing why I got one taste of it and I
[1:27:53] love it
[1:27:57] that's just the way the body works but
[1:27:59] he says you got to watch out for your
[1:28:00] mind because your mind works the same
[1:28:01] way you get a taste of something your
[1:28:04] mind likes and what does it do you dwell
[1:28:06] on it and you dwell on it until you get
[1:28:08] this body to produce it for you don't
[1:28:11] ever forget we've got to protect this as
[1:28:12] much as we've got to protect what goes
[1:28:14] in here amen our mind is the battlefield
[1:28:18] it's where the greatest battle ever
[1:28:19] fought is he says and we were by Nature
[1:28:21] the children of Wrath even as others but
[1:28:24] God who is rich in Mercy for his great
[1:28:27] love wherewith he loved us remember
[1:28:28] brother Bram said he moved with love and
[1:28:30] compassion on the world when the spirit
[1:28:32] of God
[1:28:33] moved he says for his great love
[1:28:35] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[1:28:38] dead in sins that's our value of dry
[1:28:39] bones experience dead in sins no hope he
[1:28:43] has quickened us together with Christ by
[1:28:45] grace are you saved how was Christ
[1:28:48] quickened that body laid in the ground
[1:28:50] for three days how was it quickened the
[1:28:52] Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit dropped back
[1:28:55] down into that body and it raised it up
[1:28:57] again that's the same thing that he does
[1:28:59] to us he does it by the holy spirit amen
[1:29:02] he says and he has raised us up together
[1:29:04] and made us sit together in Heavenly
[1:29:06] places in Christ Jesus Israel gets a
[1:29:08] physical land what do we get we get an A
[1:29:11] Spiritual inheritance we're with Christ
[1:29:15] today that's where we are we're the
[1:29:17] fullness of the open word is that's it
[1:29:19] today later on we get a new Heaven and a
[1:29:21] new Earth and we will get a physical
[1:29:23] land as well
[1:29:24] amen but we are HS of him according to
[1:29:26] eternal life to rule and reign with him
[1:29:28] that's our promise we're coair with
[1:29:31] Christ but watch this verse 7 it says
[1:29:33] that in the ages to come uhoh time
[1:29:38] process patience
[1:29:41] faith not going to happen overnight
[1:29:43] there's a process of this church being
[1:29:45] built up there's a timeline for a bride
[1:29:47] to be prepared he says that in the ages
[1:29:49] to come he might show the exceeding
[1:29:51] Riches of his grace in his kindness
[1:29:54] toward us through Christ Jesus for by
[1:29:56] grace are ye saved through faith and
[1:29:58] that not of yourselves it is the gift of
[1:30:01] God not of any works not of Works rather
[1:30:05] lest any man should
[1:30:07] boast remember that valley of dry bones
[1:30:10] had no Works in their restoration to
[1:30:13] life it was completely a work of God the
[1:30:16] Amplified says here for this verse it
[1:30:17] says it is not the result of what anyone
[1:30:20] can possibly do so no one can Pride him
[1:30:24] himself in it or take glory to himself
[1:30:27] in other words it's a work of God from
[1:30:29] start to finish it's his plan it's his
[1:30:32] word it's his life it's his breath it's
[1:30:34] his power it's his choosing it's his
[1:30:38] timeline it's all him from start to
[1:30:40] finish amen he says for we are his
[1:30:44] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:30:47] good works which God had before ordained
[1:30:50] that we should walk in them what's it
[1:30:52] going to take
[1:30:54] it's going to take what it did to Christ
[1:30:56] it's going to take a moving of the
[1:30:58] spirit amen it's going to take the holy
[1:31:00] spirit in your life it's going to take
[1:31:02] the holy spirit in my life not in a
[1:31:03] moving in the church there's lots of
[1:31:06] movings in the church that's not what's
[1:31:07] going to do it it's got to be in our
[1:31:09] inividual lives it's does it does us no
[1:31:12] good if you're ready and I'm not or and
[1:31:15] does you no good if I'm ready and you're
[1:31:16] not and it does us no good if we can
[1:31:18] live the life in here but we can't live
[1:31:20] the life out there amen it's got to be
[1:31:22] something that's in us when we leave the
[1:31:24] church not just something that's with us
[1:31:25] when we're in the church absolutely amen
[1:31:28] Bram says this and we're starting to
[1:31:29] close he says now when he said let there
[1:31:31] be light there may have been hundreds of
[1:31:33] years maybe 800 years before there ever
[1:31:36] was a light but it came to pass because
[1:31:38] God said so remember he says God's words
[1:31:41] are seeds and God is going to have a
[1:31:45] church I don't care how many Dark Ages
[1:31:47] we go through and whatever more he's
[1:31:49] going to have a church without spot or
[1:31:51] wrinkle whether we are part of it or not
[1:31:54] because he has already said it was going
[1:31:57] to happen it's going to be there
[1:31:59] hallelujah what a place we're sitting in
[1:32:01] this evening he has declared it the seed
[1:32:04] has been sown the spirit is brooding and
[1:32:06] when he comes to the fullness of time
[1:32:08] he'll make it
[1:32:09] happen it's happening all along but
[1:32:12] it'll happen and we'll see the full
[1:32:14] evidence of it amen we read that
[1:32:17] scripture I think last service of the
[1:32:18] service before in Zechariah 14:7 where
[1:32:21] it promised a day that was gloomy it was
[1:32:23] dark it was neither day nor night it was
[1:32:25] gray but he said in the evening time it
[1:32:28] shall be light what is light it's always
[1:32:31] the word of God with the presence of God
[1:32:33] to go with it that's what it is amen so
[1:32:36] how is God going to do this great work
[1:32:37] how is God going to take a people that
[1:32:39] are dead that are lost that are bound
[1:32:41] and bring them into Heavenly places in
[1:32:43] Christ Jesus he's going to do it the
[1:32:44] same way he did it with Christ's own
[1:32:46] body by the spirit amen he's going to do
[1:32:49] it by his word and then the spirit goes
[1:32:51] to produce what the word says I was just
[1:32:53] watching a bit of a certain brother's
[1:32:55] sermon this last week or two ago I'm not
[1:32:57] sure when it was and his title was only
[1:33:00] God can move a
[1:33:01] mountain you know there's there's this
[1:33:03] pressure that can come because we
[1:33:05] believe in the spoken word we believe in
[1:33:07] Bride Authority and these different
[1:33:09] things but he was reminding only God can
[1:33:12] move the mountain we can do the speaking
[1:33:15] but we can't do the
[1:33:16] doing Ezekiel spoke but Ezekiel did not
[1:33:19] make the life go into the bones he
[1:33:21] didn't bring them together but he spoke
[1:33:23] the word and what happened is the spirit
[1:33:25] moved and it caused that to happen and
[1:33:27] he was reminding the greatest Mountain
[1:33:28] we have is our own sin that's the
[1:33:31] greatest Mountain God has to move we
[1:33:32] have mountains in our life we have
[1:33:34] mountains in our jobs mountains in our
[1:33:35] families and these things but it's going
[1:33:37] to take God to move the mountain because
[1:33:38] I can't do it and you can't do it
[1:33:40] physically we can't do it we have no
[1:33:42] power to do it and we know so much today
[1:33:45] we know so much today I believe we know
[1:33:47] the beginning to the end by the word of
[1:33:50] God we've had a Prophet come he's
[1:33:51] comeing he's opened the word he show us
[1:33:54] a message for our day amen by the grace
[1:33:56] of God and that in itself was a working
[1:33:58] of the holy spirit that was a moving of
[1:34:00] the Holy Spirit to bring the word to us
[1:34:03] but what happens after the word is given
[1:34:05] the spirit moves to make it a reality
[1:34:08] and that's what's going on now God is
[1:34:10] called out a bride and now he's
[1:34:12] preparing a bride that's without spot or
[1:34:15] wrinkle can you make it happen can I
[1:34:19] make it
[1:34:20] happen brother M can you make it happen
[1:34:22] this evening no
[1:34:24] I can't make it happen I can preach to
[1:34:27] on blue in the face listen church I will
[1:34:28] preach the power of God from this Pulpit
[1:34:31] I will preach every bit of the word of
[1:34:33] God I will preach on signs and wonders I
[1:34:35] will preach on healing I will preach on
[1:34:36] the greatness of God I will preach on
[1:34:38] all of the good things that God has for
[1:34:40] us but I can't produce
[1:34:43] it I can't do it it takes the spirit to
[1:34:47] produce it the fruit of the spirit is of
[1:34:50] him not of me the life of the spirit is
[1:34:54] of him not of me the truth of the word
[1:34:57] is him it's not me it's got to be him
[1:34:59] from start to finish
[1:35:02] amen I long for the
[1:35:04] day where he could move so powerfully
[1:35:07] that I wouldn't even have to
[1:35:09] speak but yet I know he's ordained the
[1:35:12] five-fold ministry to speak but if I
[1:35:14] speak of my own accord that's going to
[1:35:16] do us no good it takes him to speak it
[1:35:19] takes him to discern it takes him to go
[1:35:21] into our lives to do those things
[1:35:22] otherwise I'm wasting my time up here
[1:35:24] I'm putting on a show and not much of
[1:35:27] one that's just the way it is
[1:35:31] amen but we know that after the word has
[1:35:33] gone forth what happens the spirit moves
[1:35:37] isn't that what happens at the end of a
[1:35:39] service that's why we don't sing a song
[1:35:40] in close because after the word has gone
[1:35:44] forth what happens is the spirit goes
[1:35:46] behind the word to make it have an
[1:35:49] effect that's why we linger it might be
[1:35:52] a Wednesday night we might be tired the
[1:35:54] kids might have to get up in the morning
[1:35:55] we might have to get up in the morning
[1:35:56] but we linger to let the spirit of God
[1:35:59] have an effect on the word that's been
[1:36:01] given amen because I don't know what's
[1:36:04] going on in your life I don't know what
[1:36:06] you need in in specifics I don't know
[1:36:09] you know I preached something the other
[1:36:11] day and on the way home my wife said but
[1:36:13] John she said I just appreciate that so
[1:36:15] much but she told she told me what God
[1:36:17] had been dealing with her on and it was
[1:36:19] completely different from what I had
[1:36:22] said but what it did was it got her into
[1:36:25] a place where God could move in her life
[1:36:27] in a particular
[1:36:28] way and so she started telling me I said
[1:36:31] that's wonderful I wish I would have
[1:36:32] preached it that way but all it did was
[1:36:35] it took the word to go forth and the
[1:36:37] spirit to come behind it and all of a
[1:36:39] sudden he's working in her life in a way
[1:36:41] that I don't know about that's why we do
[1:36:43] it because it's going to take the spirit
[1:36:46] I can't make it happen you can't make it
[1:36:49] happen I want to go home not not my
[1:36:52] literal home
[1:36:55] I want to go
[1:36:56] home that is my heart's cry this world
[1:37:00] is so dark it's tiring it's
[1:37:04] wearing this is the only good time I'm
[1:37:07] having these days I can't even get a
[1:37:08] moose
[1:37:11] anymore when I'm with Believers that's
[1:37:13] my
[1:37:14] joy everything out there it's it's it's
[1:37:17] so a total waste it's a worry it's a
[1:37:21] stress there's nothing that adds to me
[1:37:24] anymore and it never added a whole lot
[1:37:26] but this this world is absolutely not my
[1:37:29] home and I want to get out of here but
[1:37:31] guess what I can't make it happen but
[1:37:34] you know what I can do and you know what
[1:37:37] you can do sister Lydia you can make
[1:37:39] yourself ready to go that's one thing
[1:37:41] the scripture says the bride has made
[1:37:45] herself ready why we've got an open word
[1:37:50] we've got a message that tells us where
[1:37:52] we need to look what we need to do and
[1:37:54] how we need to do it we can dress
[1:37:56] ourselves in his Robes of righteousness
[1:37:59] we can find ourselves in obedience to
[1:38:01] his word we can listen to his message we
[1:38:03] can read his Bible amen we can keep our
[1:38:05] lives clean we can prepare ourselves
[1:38:08] like Mary for the word to come forth in
[1:38:10] its reality that's what we can do we can
[1:38:13] get ready that's all Mary could
[1:38:16] do get herself ready but it's just
[1:38:19] preparation it's not Dynamics it's not
[1:38:22] Dynamics brother Brown would put it this
[1:38:24] way he says friends only by the brooding
[1:38:28] or the cing of the Holy Spirit can you
[1:38:30] ever do it he says will God ever promise
[1:38:33] to raise you up as you listen to his
[1:38:35] voice that still Small Voice that speaks
[1:38:39] in the depths of your soul but until he
[1:38:42] speaks until he
[1:38:44] moves I can't do a thing all I can do is
[1:38:47] get ready be prepared
[1:38:55] scripture says that in the fullness of
[1:38:57] time God sends forth his son made of a
[1:39:00] woman and until it's the fullness of
[1:39:02] time for this bride I can't make it
[1:39:05] happen but I can get
[1:39:07] ready that's my part be
[1:39:11] ready scripture says those that are what
[1:39:16] looking
[1:39:18] looking the only reason you're looking
[1:39:20] is two things you want it and you expect
[1:39:23] it remember brother Ram tells a story of
[1:39:26] that that that young woman that was at
[1:39:28] that ranch and the that that rich uh
[1:39:30] young man went there looking for a wife
[1:39:32] and she was a dishwasher and he saw her
[1:39:34] and he watched her and he'd seen all
[1:39:36] these rich girls parading around and all
[1:39:37] their gowns and plating themselves and
[1:39:39] everything but he noticed her and he
[1:39:41] liked her character and he promised her
[1:39:43] he says a year from today I'll come
[1:39:45] back and so she went and she told
[1:39:48] everybody she says I'm going to be his
[1:39:49] bride he chose me and they said are you
[1:39:51] kidding me you have nothing you're
[1:39:56] nobody she said but he
[1:39:58] promised I know what he told me and he
[1:40:01] promised and on the day that he said he
[1:40:03] would come what was she doing she was
[1:40:05] dressed in her wedding dress she was
[1:40:08] standing on the porch and she was
[1:40:10] waiting for him to
[1:40:11] come why the bride had made herself
[1:40:15] ready and just about before the sun went
[1:40:18] down they said they heard the
[1:40:21] sound of him coming
[1:40:24] and he drove up she got in the car or
[1:40:26] the wagon and off they went everybody
[1:40:29] sat there and said are you kidding
[1:40:30] me she knew that's why she made herself
[1:40:34] ready want to know if you're really
[1:40:37] believing what you believe are you
[1:40:39] getting ready to go are you getting
[1:40:41] ready to
[1:40:42] go one more quote before we call
[1:40:45] close says this see how perfect the
[1:40:48] scripture is a day that won't be called
[1:40:50] night day or night fruit cannot ripen
[1:40:53] unless the sun ripens it no matter how
[1:40:56] much you preach whatever you do it
[1:40:57] cannot be ripened it cannot be
[1:40:59] manifested it cannot be Vindicated only
[1:41:02] by him who said I am the light of the
[1:41:05] world the word he says so there has to
[1:41:08] come forth a power the Holy Spirit
[1:41:11] himself to ripen or to vindicate or to
[1:41:15] prove or to make manifested that what
[1:41:18] he's predicted would happen in this day
[1:41:20] he says the evening light produces that
[1:41:23] what a Time amen God bless you let's
[1:41:26] stand I say tonight let's stay in the
[1:41:29] light amen that's how we get ready we
[1:41:32] stay in the
[1:41:33] light all that happens at the end of
[1:41:36] that season that growing season when it
[1:41:39] comes to the light then it comes to
[1:41:41] maturing there's no more growth it's
[1:41:44] just seasoning it's just maturing
[1:41:47] everything that's in it's there the corn
[1:41:50] the wheat whatever it is it's all there
[1:41:52] it's not pulling up up anymore it's just
[1:41:54] staying in the presence of the Sun and
[1:41:56] it's becoming what it always was that's
[1:41:58] all he's asking us to do stay in the
[1:42:00] light stay in the word stick with it let
[1:42:03] it ripen us amen that's the work it's
[1:42:05] supposed to be doing and that's the work
[1:42:07] of the holy spirit is to mature a bride
[1:42:09] that stayed with the
[1:42:12] word I wonder how's it going to happen I
[1:42:15] wonder how are we going to take a
[1:42:18] Rapture you think about it you think
[1:42:20] about that sister Brenda that just one
[1:42:23] day we may be sitting in this service
[1:42:26] you know we're we're the start of the E
[1:42:27] Eastern Seaboard it's got to start with
[1:42:29] us right it's a process we may be
[1:42:32] sitting together in this
[1:42:33] church and all of a
[1:42:37] sudden brother Chad will give the
[1:42:39] loudest shout he's
[1:42:42] ever and he'll fire up through that
[1:42:45] roof how's it going to happen I don't
[1:42:48] know but brother bradam said that we
[1:42:51] will call the saint
[1:42:53] out of their
[1:42:55] grave man we've lost some precious

[1:43:08] he that's filthy be filthy and let he
[1:43:09] that's holy be holy still but whatever

[1:43:14] fellowship and we'll sit there and all
[1:43:16] of a sudden we'll look each other and
[1:43:17] we'll say it's time to
[1:43:22] go and we'll
[1:43:24] know not cuz I said it because the
[1:43:28] spirit that's in you and

[1:43:35] says it's time to go it'll say it's time
