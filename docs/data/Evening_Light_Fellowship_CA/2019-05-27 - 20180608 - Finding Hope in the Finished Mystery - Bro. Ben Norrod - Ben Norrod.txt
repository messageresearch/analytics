thank god for the grace of his presence amen the grace of salvation but the grace that he continues with us that he promised he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age well thank god if there's if there's anything that that believers have a revelation up and are conscious of is grace amen it's what keeps us brother sister every step of the way every mile of the way every second is the grace of god oh when we consider him and his righteousness amen and consider us who were born in sin you know shaped in iniquity and come to the world speaking lies and consider what he did for us thank god amen to god be the glory amen so we thank god for his grace in saving us and gathering us into his word under his word and we thank god for the grace of bringing our brother ben norad and sister samantha with us amen to god be the glory we enjoyed his uh his ministry when he was here before i'm sure that we're going to enjoy the ministry again and not just a ministry of the going forth of the word but of our brother and sister in their singing amen so we trust that they still have the plans to sing amen because i believe that god is going to minister to us through the preaching of the word but god ministers to us as well through the specials the singing as we as as we have heard here tonight amen god is what they're singing revelation amen and and again it's not something that means much to to the world out there but it means a lot to the to the bride of christ it means a lot to the believers to god be the glory as he will minister to us tonight to our our brother and our sister again so to we're going to turn it over to our brother ben and and well i'm going to ask you to stand and we're going to sing the chorus i love him because he first loved me and purchased my salvation on calvary's tree and just let's be thankful that god has brought our brother back amen the second time the third time it'd be perfection and i've reminded someone about something they were going through and experience i said well they said they had experienced it three times i said well i said five is grace and they thought that was good but i said seven is completion oh you mean to tell me i've got to go through it until it's seven amen you may experience it seven times and our brother this is his second time here to minister to us and uh the lord willing maybe down the road it'll be a third time or another and a fifth and maybe a seventh but god knows amen so may the lord continue to bless us and to bless our brother ben and and our and our sister tonight amen so let's be in prayer as our brother comes to minister the word let's be in prayer as they would minister to us ain't soft to god be the glory amen so let's sing it from our hearts express us from our hearts i love him because he first loved me and purchased my salvation on calvary's tree i love him because he has returned our brother with his ministry to minister the word to us again amen we need it by the grace of god amen so let's be in prayer that god will be in control and god god's going to get our brother out of the way amen he's going to step down and just move him aside and he'll take control so if you hear whatever you hear tonight let's believe that it's the lord amen if you if there's anything that you feel is going to be hard tonight don't blame our brother it's not here it's the anointing of the holy ghost amen is god speaking to us as individuals praise the lord god bless you let's sing i love him because he first loved me [Music] [Music] me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] on [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the lord amen love him hallelujah with all your heart with your soul your spirit hallelujah

[Applause] [Music] amen good to be in the house of the lord tonight you can be seated for just a minute if you'd like i'm going to ask my wife to come if she will and we're going to sing a little bit and then get right into the preaching of the word of the lord everybody happy tonight amen certainly want to say how much we do appreciate the opportunity to come back again and i um certainly always look forward to this time of year when we get a chance to come and i want to say thank you to brother gerald and the church body for receiving us again and we had a little fellowship today with some of the brothers and sisters and we um looking forward to more of that as the weekend progresses and it's good to see everybody here tonight so happy to be back amen in newfoundland my home away from home amen that's right i uh i live off these meetings and i've looked forward to this for an entire year now coming no we're going to try to come back this way i've really been looking forward to it and so um i did something this time around that i wasn't able to do last time around and i brought our cds with us and uh i don't have with us tonight i left them in the room running out in the haste just trying to get things going and all that but uh if you'd like to get a copy of the cd after church or whatever how you'd like to arrange it i don't know exactly how you brothers handle those things but if you'd like to have a copy of our music we've got the cd available my wife is going to be collecting all of the monies and all that kind of thing you see how that works she gets all the money for it amen and we don't make anything off of it what we get goes right back into the making of the cd and we take it and either pay off what we've got on the first one or put it to the second one which is coming in just a little while we've got about maybe oh three or four months something like that and they're finishing up all of the little particulars to it we'll have a another one done the lord helping us and the lord willing we've sold almost a thousand of these first cds and they went very very quick and went very very fast because we've made people wait for years before they could ever take us home by the way of cd and uh the lord really blessed it and was a blessing to a lot of people and so we want to make that available to you this time around i packed them in a bag on my shoulder and protected them like i had a baby in my arms all the way up here just i tried to watch over them best i could and it's hard to travel with those little cases they're like eggs they crack so easy and stuff like that but then i found out it was twice the twice as much trying to ship them to canada it's a lot so i thought well i can buy you a case for about 30 cents but you know the ship is way much more than that so anyhow i thought maybe it'd be a blessing to you now i'm not sales pitching you but i just want you to know that they're available this week and um be sure to get you get you a good copy and put it in your cd players shout and clap your hands and rejoice and amen and be blessed by it because that's the purpose of why we make them is for the blessing of the lord and so i'm happy to have my wife with me and uh we're gonna we're gonna turn her loose the little girl with a big voice which one brother math [Music] out on the water a storm raging high the waters around them were troubled that night fear filled their hearts they felt that they would die they failed to remember the master was nigh he spoke the word and the winds all stood still even the waters they obeyed his will he calmed their storm just like he will do mine if i'll just remember that he lives deep inside why should i worry why should i fear when the very same jesus stays always near he lives in my heart and he hears when i cry i'll call on his name till the storm passes by we read in the bible how he walked with them he brought light to their darkness when their way grew so dim how great it would be to have his step leading mine to walk with the master all of the time so when troubles come and death seems so nice and my body is in pain all i have to do is call on your name why should i worry why should i fear when the very same jesus he saves always near he lives in my heart and he hears when i cry god i'll call on his name and why should i worry why should i fear when the very same jesus he stays always near he lives in my heart and he hears when i cry i'll call on his name i'll call on his name [Music] or call on his name i'll call on his name until the storm passes [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] praise the lord jesus amen and why should i worry why should i fear can you say amen to that i love this little song here we picked this up about maybe i guess it's been a year ago now something like that one of the sisters in the church said to us uh brother ben you all ought to sing this song well i went and listened to it and i don't know when i've had a song affect me as much as this particular song has affected me and that's a very simple song just simply says i can pray do you believe god hears your prayers tonight [Music] you say i'm not able i'm too young or i'm too old take your time and i can't sing or preach no titles do i hold what can i do for i want to do my part i want to help the hurting with all of my heart i can pray until the walls come down till there's healing all around that's something i can do i can pray in my secret place calling on your name that's something i can do i can pray [Music] my family shows no interest my child has gone so far and though i try my best to reach them their hearts just seem so hard what can i do to help bring them back to you for my family's lost and dying and my words they don't get through i can pray until the walls come down [Music] [Applause] that's something i can do oh i can pray in my secret place placement calling on your name that's something i can do i can't now my friend you may not be a singer you may not be a preacher you may not be recognized as somebody great in your local community you may not be known around the world you may not have a spotlight from hollywood but if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost there's one thing that each and every one of us can do we can call on the lovely on the mighty and on the holy name of jesus yes sir as the bride of christ we can pray and his bible said he would hear from heaven if you believe it say man i can pray until the walls come down [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in my secret place calling on your name that's something i can do i can't pray when the bills are due [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] i can't [Applause] [Music] praise the lord amen can you say amen to that thank god for that amen one more song i want to sing to you this evening and i like this one right here i i think it's uh one of the most beautiful songs i think i've heard in a long time and it's an old anybody know charles johnson the revivers anybody ever heard that name this is an old charles johnson tune so if you like them at all it's uh it's a good one but it just simply says ahead kg brothers this road i walk is straight and narrow and it leads to a better home it was laid by christ one day at calvary while he suffered all alone now this road may lead over many high mountains and valleys dark and low but i walk each day with sweet assurance that i'll safely reach my goals [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] peace [Music] [Music] [Music] can you say amen is them on this road i get so weary and often my feet will stray but a gentle hand leads me onward and helps me to find my way as i climb each hill and across each valley [Music] ahead [Music] [Applause] [Music] do you believe it tonight [Music] [Applause] jesus where tears will never be shed though so often this hero is rough and rocky still i know what lies ahead listen now while on this road i get so weary and often my feet will stray but a gentle hand yes it leads me onward and helps me to find my way as i climb [Music] keep on [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes i'll [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] i know [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] praise the lord amen can you say praise the lord you know what lies ahead hallelujah let's stand together this evening amen let's turn to first thessalonians chapter four first thessalonians chapter 4. don't you love the lord tonight amen i'm so glad i know what lies ahead praise the lord first thessalonians chapter four i'm going to speak to you this evening the lord helping us upon finding hope in the finished mystery finding hope in the finished mystery praise the lord amen everything christ has ever done with us and done for us he's always left hope for the people of god i believe the bible even tells us that we have a hope we have a shore hope an anchor amen for our weary soul as the song said and i thank god for that hope tonight but it's a greater hope than just having hope of you know something new coming along or something greater coming along or oh my one of these days it'll be better or greater or some you know this marketing people are always time pushing bigger and greater and faster and all of that but for us the finishing of the mystery of god provides a hope for us in this way that we're not looking for something greater we're just looking for something to take us higher you understand the difference nothing greater can be done than what's already been done for us as a people of god we've got eternal life it doesn't get much greater than that but for us let's just take a little bit higher turns into revelation of god amen let's read together now first thessalonians chapter 4 and let's look at verse 15. amen for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain shall not prevent which means to hinder them which are asleep but the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout now watch us now the lord himself for this we say unto you by the word of the lord the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout so we're not looking for the returning of a prophet we're looking for the lord himself amen there's a big difference between just the returning of god's servant and the lord himself now watch he comes with a shout with a voice and with the trump of god the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall arise first everybody say first then then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds i want you to notice the order of the resurrection the dead in christ shall rise first then afterwards after they have risen then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord verse 18 wherefore comfort one another with these words can i put it in my language find hope in what's been said here find hope in what's been said here amen let's let's let's pray over the word while your heads are bowed this evening if you just like to be remembered in prayer would you just let it be known by the lifting of your hand this evening god bless you my my hands are raised with you lord jesus we so thank you this evening father for the graciousness and the mercy and the outpouring of thy holy spirit father from the moment we have stepped on this property we felt the holy ghost already encircling this little place for lord the expectation of your people and your children for these revival weekends lord they they pull you out of heaven lord that you'll come with angels of god and ministry of god that we can hear from your presence tonight and from your throne and i like lord what brother gerald said a moment ago that i would be the one getting out of the way that you could come and do the talking lord jesus i might be just a vehicle but lord allow me to bring you to the destination allow me to bring you on the scene by getting out of the way this evening my father that you could come and use my mouth and my thoughts and my body and actions and what more that be all for the glory of god to the edifying of the body of christ then lord i pray that you will not only speak through me but you will listen and hear through your children here tonight may all those gather here this evening lord may they be receptive to hear all that you would speak to us as we commit this service and every uplifted hand around this building tonight into your precious hands o lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we committed amen and amen i bless you may be seated amen so thank the lord for his mercy tonight amen you love him with all of your heart amen he loves you one thing i love about the lord jesus is that he's not prejudiced and he doesn't look at somebody's age or any of those type of things to dictate his love or to measure how much he loves us or how much he cares for us but almighty god he has a feeling toward his bride a feeling in which that you and i will never really be able to explain it we'll fail words to try to describe what that's really about i mean to us we could take scripture after scripture and quote after quote and try to frame together a thought that way but the truth of the matter is is that even in the eighth day when eternity has gone on for millions of years we'll still be trying to describe how the how in the world could god could have loved somebody like me that he could have cared for us and he could have looked upon us with uh potential and saw potential in our lives it's amazing when you go to thinking about what god has done for us in his mind before the foundation of the world he saw us as being what we are and i don't mean that god part but i mean this human part and yet it didn't stop him it didn't stumble him it didn't stagger him from going forth with all of the eternal plan of god to bring you and i to the position of where we are right here tonight and i i'm convinced brother sister that if god saw all of this down through the stream of time and he still carried on his great plan and still went forth with all of his desires i don't think anything we're going to do today or tomorrow or next week is going to stop him from loving us just the same as he loved us all the way back then as a matter of fact i believe he's a cheerleader for the bride he's pulling us on and egging us on and a great cloud of witnesses inclusive is standing around us to bring us into a greater revelation of who he is a deeper understanding of christ and his word and we know that all of these great things that we hear in the message of the last day they they are things that we feel privileged to hear i mean don't you think when you open up the message and you start reading some of these things from brother branham and then you look in the bible and see how they tied together don't you think to yourself how privileged i am to hear and see what god has done in this generation and yet to think of the multitudes around the world that will look maybe at the same bible and and maybe come in contact with brother brahms message and still it doesn't register with them the way that it registers with you and i and you look right here in this little church here this little tiny body of people and we're tiny compared to the joel osteen's of the world and the john hagees of the world and all of the great campaigns of of charismatic men and all this type of thing they they they've got thousands upon thousands upon thousands carrying their bibles to church and my standing there and hearing sermons and listening at things read from the bible but yet in all of their multitudes they'll never hear what god has privileged us right here in this little place to hear from almighty god we are a blessed people not just because god sent brother branham to the earth but because the lord himself took his word through that little prophet and began to manifest and express to us all that he had hiding in his mind what a privileged people we are and yet with all of our privileges and all of the graces that god has shown to us we are living in one of the most difficult times there is to live it doesn't get any more treacherous or any more deceptive or any more hard as far as with the hardships of life than the lady you'll see in church age and yet this is the age that god chose to reserve all of the unfoldings of his mystery and to this time of the hour we're living and you hear brother bannon say that if god could have asked him of any time he would have wanted to live he said i believe i would have chosen this age because he said this is the most glorious age out of them all amen and yet the most wicked out of all of them i mean you think about that a moment friend and god looking down to the stream of time he saw all of the confusion he saw all of the churchianity he saw all of the nonsense he saw all of the make-believers and the was nots and the holy touch me nod said he saw saints down through that stream of time and yet somehow god chose in his mind this hour amen to manifest the promise of his word that he would not only restore everything that had been taken down through them dark ages but it would unfold the very mystery of himself right down here on this last time oh my it's a powerful thing and we understand the hour we're living in is the finishing of the mystery of god amen all of it's supposed to be completed as we go out of here in a rapture resurrection there should be no question for you and i and why did god choose all of these attributes and all of these little isms and ups and downs to culminate and come together in their finality here in this age because this is the age that god knew the bride would need more hope than any other age and she would need a hope that would be resting beyond the veil and beyond this flesh veil she'd have to have a hope inside of her heart by the baptism of the holy ghost amen and god wanted to secure god wanted to establish his word for the bride that in a day of just of religious deception in a time of deception when everybody goes to church and everybody believes in god he wanted you and i to have a hope that was beyond church entity that was beyond just religion and coming to church and occupying a pew he'd want us to have a hope that if every bible was destroyed tonight we would still know what thus saith the lord is amen if we never got another tape or never was able to push play again in our life yet we have a hope here tonight brother bob we have a whole payment of what lays beyond us as the people of god now this is wonderful how paul begins to open this up now i want to take you on a small little journey back into this time period in this first century when paul begins dealing with this and i want to just take your minds for a moment into what some of the people sitting there in the church maybe you think of in a way of preaching like here tonight if paul was to stand up and say church i've got a new revelation from god i want to share with you and maybe the apostle would start reading this text to the bible or something and then he would come to these words this we say by the word of the lord now i i hope you understand that what paul is bringing here in this fourth chapter of thessalonians is things that has never been heard before it has never been identified at any time down through the old testament moses and naham and habakkuk and micah and ezekiel jeremiah none of these prophets have dealt with this rapture resurrection in the way that paul is getting ready to deal with it it's quite a statement he makes here and really solidify for us as the people of god what it is that he's getting ready to tell us he uses these words in verse 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the lord amen he wanted the people to know this is not paul this is not my idea this is not my thoughts or what i'm about to tell you but this is thus saith the lord this we say unto you by the word of the lord now you realize when paul is beginning to establish this this doctrine of the second coming of the lord jesus he's taking a mixture of different scriptures and thoughts down through the old testament he's going back into things that moses would say into things that the lord jesus himself would say that if i go away i will prepare a place for you and bring you again quickly now now we know that most of the old testament the majority of it is upon the first coming of the lord jesus christ we know that to be right and we know that whenever jesus first arrived on the scene that many of the pharisees sadducees essenes herodians all these different groups of people were looking by the old testament for the coming of the messiah and we know what brother benham told us that whenever they they they set their foundation of how he was going to come up it would be something to the effect of maybe that he would appear to caiaphasis and he would say hey here i am i'm the great messiah he would come with an angel band he would come with great glory shining out of heaven but when he showed up he came in a manure pile and many of them missed him all together 100 who jesus really was think of it them smart educated men in the message of that hour and yet looking at the fulfillment of everything they studied and still they were blinded and could not see who he was it was quite an hour and all of the scriptures in the old testament had pointed to this very moment and john was the man that was gathering up all of that divine energy and he was pointing to this messiah in the river this is the one of i spoke to you that was whose shoes i'm not worthy to even lace up this man is the one that the anointing had pulled to the prophet of god said john saw the holy spirit descend upon the lord jesus as the dove would lay upon the lamb he said he identified who jesus was even by the way of flesh or by natural looking amen they were cousins long-distance cousin if you understand the word long distance amen amen they were they were family in a lot of ways no doubt john was associated with jesus in certain ways but when he saw the pillar of fire rest upon the lamb of god he had scriptural identity of who he was and them sadducees standing on the on the riverbank still could not see who this man really was he points to the rocks and said if these hold their peace these stones will cry out in other words what's the matter with you bunch of men don't you see what's going on around you you know it's a strange thing how that god can perform great things right in front of people's eyes and yet they're so blinded to it they still can't see what's happening amen amen it's amazing to me i see people that even in this day we're living in they study the message all of their life they're in and out of message churches all of their life and yet just the other day on facebook there's a man i've known him for many many years publicly declares he believed brother bam was an antichrist and the message false doctrine i think and here he is a preacher and that's not just the one but i i know 10 or 12 more in my my last four or five years of traveling men i'd preach for men that i shook their hand hugged their neck and yet now they're on the other side of the fence oh brother bam's message is a bunch of hogwash and nonsense and you think to yourself how can people look right at the message and look right at the manifestation of christ in this last day and not see who was inside that humble little prophet well you see god has an answer for them things and the answer is if you're not called to it something will shake you out of it amen and only the bride will have a hope before she goes out of this world of what this message is all about amen sister lily and i did an interview last year and my god the devil's come out of the woodwork after we did this interview i i've been like a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs i've i have i have bombarded lily to death we've got to change this got to fix that got to say this different why because people are so blinded to where we're at they're so critical of the hour that we're living in and friends the truth is laying right there before their eyes many times and they don't want to accept it you'd be surprised sister lily how many sisters have come to me after the interview about women being underestimated i had a woman grip my hands the other day with tears in her eyes and said i was delivered by the holy ghost of a dominating spirit after i heard that interview she said it's true men bully women in the message and they believe that that's exactly what they do they bully this and bully that and ramrod this and ramrod that what is it it's the devil in the last day trying to take hope out of everybody that names the name of jesus christ amen but we as the bride of christ tonight we have a hope that lays within this truth amen the mysteries are being revealed i'm getting to that in just a moment but i'm going to take my time on this long runway i got a big plane to get up here friends amen that's right i don't want to hurry these things along we got all wicked anyhow praise the lord that's right now watch this we say by the word of the lord and you realize friends that when paul is introducing these ideas to these people it is something so different from what they have always heard that they don't understand maybe even where paul is coming from peter himself said you know paul says some things we just don't understand it hear peter walk with jesus talk with jesus fish with jesus hunted with jesus preach with jesus in and out of campaigns with the lord jesus and yet here paul is introducing a concept that i mean even the disciples were probably scratching their head what in the world is he talking about but god was going to reveal to this man oh i love this he was going to reveal to this man the the structure if you will in which jesus will return to the bride in the last day now you realize this man is preaching to old testament people taste not touch not handle not all they've ever known their entire existence is if you do god will bless you if you don't he'll send you to hell and now this man is preaching on the second coming of the lord jesus well isn't it good enough just to quote the words of jesus if i go away i'll come again isn't that good enough no it had to be deeper than that there had to be something more for the people of god because paul maybe not realizing himself this text of scripture is going to be read for 2 000 years after his departure and he's going to go through a time of dark ages and you realize these people that was fed the lions and sawn asunder and on and on and on you realize even the bible had been taken away from many of these men and women that they would have no understanding until that seed began restoration work under martin luther and it started coming back up through them ages there was no hope laying out there before the people of god but god said i won't leave him in the dark ages i'm going to restore my truth so that there'll be a hope for the people of god brother brahm said god watched over his word do you believe that he watched over this bible somebody said to me the other day it's the words of a man i said i'm glad you got that now let's get the other side of the coin i said it was god speaking through a man amen amen it was the words of men men pinned these things down men use english men use arabic ever what it was but it was god's voice god's mouth speaking through those men as they penned the words down there amen don't forget man is god's agent that makes me feel happy for it man is god's microphone he's the one god talks through oh somebody said well i can just listen to a tape and push play and that's all but god uses man not mechanical devices amen you got microphones here you got little screens to watch scriptures and songs and you got electrical equipment all over this building hey it's used for the glory of god but that's not man's god's agent man is god's agent the microphone just helps man get his song over amen or get his sermon out it's only an a the tape recorder only helps get the voice out the cd player and the radio only helps get the voice out but god has always used man that's always been his plan and listen he'll never stop doing that i don't care where he's at or who his name is or what part of the world it's in god will always use man i know sometimes it looks very bleak it looks very dark and you wonder where in the world is the next one going to come from that's really got real revelation and all that but listen god's got people somewhere we may not know where they're at but god's got men somewhere that are anointed by the pillar of fire to preach thus saith the lord because i hear brother batman say this bride will have thus saith the lord or shall hold still so somewhere she's got to get it amen maybe not over in these cold parts of the world where we've our revival fires are almost went completely out until they're nothing but a bunch of smoldering ashes amen over here in the in north america where it seemed like that you have to almost work everybody into a frenzy just to get five minutes revival out of them i mean they ain't hardly uh enough enthusiasm to want a musket shotgun come on somebody hey man they're just they're just dwindling out but god's got somebody if he's got to go to the pygmies in africa and raise him up a pygmy he'll preach thus saith the lord if he's got to go to alaska to the eskimos there'll be an eskimo somewhere that'll have thus saith the lord the message has got to live on somehow god will make a way for the bride amen the prophet of god said satan thought he squashed out that group in the dark ages he said but what he didn't realize is that the going down of the seed this is seed not earth to shove the going down of the seed he said brought the restoration of the entire thing amen amen because once it would come through luther and the life would go into wesley and then travel to pentecost and then come out on the last day through the shock and to the seed it would be the finishing of all the mysteries of god and the completing of the works of god in the last day amen so paul bringing it in this we say to you by the word of the lord he wanted to give the people hope because at this time taste not touched not handle not all they had by the mark was the idea if i live right i'll make it if i don't i ain't gonna make it do you know there's a little bit different side to that in this day and age i know that a lot of people think well it's my living right it's going to get me into heaven do you realize that ain't even in the bible much less the message now i don't say that a christian won't live right oh no don't you go out here saying i believe that no i believe you're a christian you'll live right but your living right don't get you to heaven if your living right could get you to heaven that makes you your own redeemer and your own savior [Applause] if you could do anything at all to bring yourself into a holy state of god then you are your own private redeemer god i wish somebody helped me preach right now praise the lord somebody we're not our own personal savior i cannot be my own private redeemer come on now it took christ to save me and hear these in the old testament all they had was their works moses said do it moses said don't do it moses said do this moses said don't do that you break that word and you'll be stoned without it without any mercy or any grace stone taken out of the camp and stoned in front of witnesses that you broke that word until of course when jesus comes along and he realizes that they're not only manipulating the word to fit their own means but they were they were doing a whole lot of things that moses said not to do although they were not they wasn't letting people know it themselves remember when the woman got caught in adultery where was the man at because excuse this expression but last i heard it takes two to tango forgive me but it's the truth they caught her and if they caught her in the act of adultery she wasn't there with herself she was there with somebody hallelujah somebody she was there with somebody where was he at when they brought him up you see it might have been one of their fellow pharisees might have been some great member in society that paid him a lot of money underneath the table don't you see how deceiving the devil can be and all of that was supposed to be in the auspices of the message hey i imagine if he was in the message day that day you'd start pointing out all the little flaws and all the little problems and all that too because why man has always been the same it doesn't matter if it was pre facebook or post facebook man has always been man he'll always do the things that he's done especially if he's got evil in his heart come on somebody preach to me he'll always do the things that's contrary to the word of god until he's born again amen amen and then if he does something contrary the holy ghost will make him straighten up that's right that's what the bible said all of this time man would go down to the grave without a hope if i live by the word if i live the best of my knowledge and my ability christ will have mercy on me you understand even in the first general resurrection of them old testament saints they had to be buried geographically in a certain spot in order for them to even receive receive resurrection that's why joseph said don't leave my bones in egypt bring me out of egypt and put me over there in the promised land all of those that geographically was outside of this little spot it was the spot there where abraham and the cave of mack pilar you remember the story or buys it so much of a price and there is where that god was going to use that little piece of ground to bring forth the general resurrection and in that that specific time period that was the only hope they had live by the sacrifice live by the light of the candlesticks live by the show breath and when the smoke would enter up and the pre or the would enter up into heaven rather than the priests would look out there on the people and say god has received our sacrifice that's the only hope they had they had no personal hope themselves they were just playing guesswork that they they were they were close enough that god might accept them down the road amen no wonder the israelites probably got frustrated after a period of time all right listen to me god never desired for them to have the law did you know that it wasn't god that wanted them to have the law man wanted the law amen about the same way today that's the way people are they want to make their own laws their own rules their own regulations and they want you to live by their measuring sticks and what they say and what they don't say the same guy is preaching against facebook are the same ones preaching against the telephone same one preaching against the telephone was probably preaching against the carrier pigeon at one time come on somebody hey come on now man is always man he has always tried to make holiness of his own self but again if he can be his own savior if it can be his own redeemer god will accept your works and my works but that's the thing god didn't look at me in you and say okay bob you're 80 good 20 bad come on i can use you he didn't look over here and say all right paul 70 30 boy we've got a little work to do with you [Laughter] god didn't look at that and say all right so much good so much bad when he looked at us he realized we were a hundred percent bad [Music] that's what the bible said there was no good works in any of us that we could boast in any way we were a hundred percent bad that's why we needed a savior come on now that's exactly right all but you say brother being i'm a good person goodness don't make it the spirit of god's what makes it amen does no matter how good you are or how much good you might think think in your mind you might be you're not even close to what them israelites was back in their time because i guarantee they lived a whole much stricter standard than what you and i do or unless you checked i imagine you haven't looked at the tag in your clothes in a long time but you got a little mixture of clothing in there you don't wear 100 wool or whatever it might be you got a little polyester here and a little this here and a little that there how many of you all like pork i shouldn't even ask that question that's 100 amen i don't think there's any vegetarian job got both hands in the air he said hallelujah glory to god amen amen i don't know i've ever seen you shout as loud as that right terrible amen amen amen but but us we we don't live by the dietary laws and we don't live by the structures and the standard that they live by and when a man would die he had his only confidence in a god that he didn't even know was even really listening to him sometimes he had faith sure he did but read the bible read how many of them prophets would get underneath underneath a juniper tree we've all been there but listen these people lived in a different manner than what you and i live they lived on a standard that they didn't have the close relationship with god that you and i have got right here today sure them prophets they would go into a presence of god and god would talk to them sure i know that but look at them after they got out underneath the anointing but it ain't that way with you and i because even when we're out from underneath the anointing the holy spirit still deals with your heart still blesses you and still does great things in your life amen we may have our juniper trees but there's a blessing that comes with the infilling of the holy ghost what are you trying to say brother ben we've got hope amen we've got a hope that the world knows nothing about and it's a hope that will keep on going even after i lose hope when i get hopeless that hope will still go because it's from god now notice again paul's saying that all of this is the word of the lord unto you now watch him as he comes into this second coming of the lord now let me let me read this just a little bit before we get into verse 16. and the message out thy word lord don't think of money don't think of homes and land think of christ who is coming there's nobody can put hopes in anything else but christ now that's right everything our whole future is on the coming of the lord he said that's right that's the hope of those who are asleep and of we who are alive now you realize that when brother branham frames together the words of the hope of the church he always and every place talking about the hope of the bride the hope of the church is that is the coming of the lord jesus there is no one in any one place any political realm any economical realm that we can put our trust or our confidence in the devil controls this entire world and brother sister there is nothing that we can put our confidence in hey bad dictators and bad prime ministers and bad this and bad presidents and what more they're going to come along whether we like it or not it doesn't matter the devil rules this world we're not putting our confidence in trump or trudeau or any other dog rey me or whoever forgive me or anybody else we're not putting our confidence in none of that our confidence is in the lord jesus christ and notice when paul is introducing the hope to the church what does he say the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout so this is not a prophet we got confidence in not an apostle we got confidence in but the lord himself oh friends you understand this is the only hope that we've got right here tonight we were talking about it this this morning this afternoon uh this kate spade and and anthony bourdain great chef i mean all kinds of money rolling in left and right kate spade's got them little handbags you sisters like here the woman on her on her deathbed almost we'd say she's a multi-multi-multi-millionaire and so was anthony bourdain both of them commit suicide just a few days within each other and we were talking about it today brother bob made this remark to me and he didn't realize i was getting ready to preach on this tonight but i almost done a jig right there amen amen but the remark was like this the reason people do it is because they just don't have any hope anymore i thought that's exactly right because you can't put confidence in a million dollars in a bank account you can't put confidence in a successful business you can't put confidence in none of that let one bad facebook report come back and your business is gone hey come on somebody let one thief get a hold of your bank account and you're busted amen nothing we can hope in but one hope that's jesus christ that's right so don't think of money don't think of homes and land oh i tell you if i could get this certain certain certain thing if i could climb to the pinnacle to the ladders of success you can do every bit of that and still wind up a miserable popper by the end of the day spiritually i mean you could be a multi-billionaire without christ you have absolutely nothing amen amen i wish somebody helped me preach right now amen amen amen amen that's right because with christ amen we have all the hope in the world glory oh yes sir nothing we can fear for christ who is tomorrow is in tomorrow before tomorrow arrives amen we can put our confidence in god because he is there before tomorrow arrives oh my thank you jesus now notice this how that in verse 16 paul says the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout now we know what a shout is a shout is a message amen we know that when the old testament speaks about shouting tells the people in jericho shout blow your trumpets and all these different types of things it's a message and paul identifies that at the trumpet gives an uncertain sound you know the scriptures and height talks about the voice has to be plain in order to prepare yourself for what the next steps in life may be i'll just say it that way or what the next stage of your walk might be you have to know how to prepare yourself now here we are in the ladies and age and there's 900 and some different denominations while elijah's on the earth a friend of mine told me the other day said brother ben have you looked at that registry lately i said no sir he said let's just say it this way it's went from 900 to 90 000. he said there's so many denominations and organizations in the world he said it's hard to keep up with them and a lot of them they're made of as splinters of another church of a church of a church of church hey friends listen message churches aren't the only ones that has church blitz amen man has been split in church since cain and abel got into it in the garden of eden come on somebody amen and that's something that's a normal part of everything that goes on with churches because people you get one man he's got an idea get another man he's got an idea and one always thinks his idea is better than the other one and there's always some sheeple that always go along with it amen amen come on somebody amen they always go right along with the thing yes that's exactly what it needs to be i agree with you brother all that guy over he don't know what he's talking about but you you've got the message now we know that when the lord himself is descending with a shout we know this did not take place in 1962 1956 1948 but this took place at the opening of the seven seals when the lord himself appeared in arizona amen this is where god came down in a visible image before the entire world that they could see that the mystery was getting ready to be finished now we know that when the shout comes you could say it in this manner that if i stood up here tonight and i just i just shout and say hey well everybody would just look well what the world's he talking about you still wouldn't understand it but maybe if i do it this way what if i'd come down here instead of shouting just in general what if i looked over and said hey carson well now there's a message in that and that shout's calling somebody's name getting their attention brother branham said when them seven seals came open the mighty angel took the book of god which was the book of redemption he said that book of redemption was sealed with seven seals man's potential god's potential and everything that we would ever be was sealed inside of that book that's the reason when john saw it and saw it was still sealed up and nobody was worthy to take it everything in the earth heard him crying and screaming and weeping before god oh god and john was looked at all the prophets was looked at nobody was found worthy to take that book until the lion prevailed to take his own book just like paul said the lord himself all these different denominations and organizations it was a bunch of noise there was shouting going around everybody but nobody understood the message didn't know how many gods they believed in that no matter how to baptize didn't understand what holiness supposed to look like the churches certainly wasn't in order amen i told somebody the other day they said i got a problem with tongues interpretations and prophecies that people do use them wrong i said they may do it but we've got a standard in this message we've got two tables of stone like moses called conduct order and doctrine that tells us how to put it in this place that's our two tablets of stone and last day the cod book lets us know i said as believers in the last day that ain't nobody could speak in tongues interpret or prophesy incorrectly but what we couldn't pull the book on them come on somebody we've got a message laying there that tells us what the right is we don't have to play guesswork with it amen if you want to know if it's right just go look in the tablets of stone there see what see what our moses said about it thou shalt not do it while the preacher is preaching and so forth like that amen it doesn't mean you can't get blessed and speak in an online language while i'm preaching but don't you interrupt me because you're out of order if i have to wait on you you're out of order amen if i got to wait on you that ain't no problem amen amen if you've got to wait on me rather that ain't no problem you just let me keep on preaching right i'm the one under the anointing up here i'm the one that's got the voice of god for the message tonight is that what he said he said don't you interrupt with prophecy or these type of things we have a message that made it plain to us what it's supposed to look like and how it's supposed to be in order come on now there's no confusion in these things we've got the books and the tapes amen and amen and amen amen that's exactly right and here we're standing in the last day when that seventh seal had to be broken for the people of god so that christ himself could unfold all that he was hiding underneath that seven seal mystery so the lion remember the prophet of god said and in the bible there in revelation 10 when he comes the lion roars remember that brother baby said when the lion roars he said it's because there's a lot of chatter going on in the jungle everybody's got a voice everybody's got something to say when he roars seven thunders utter their voices oh god you're getting scared to death but i'm gonna solve this seven thunder thing in 30 seconds don't get nervous amen amen people take seven years to try to explain it with seven different men in seven different parts of the world i'm going to solve it for you in 30 seconds the mystery of god was contained all down through the bible you believe that genesis to revelation held the mystery of god everybody had their interpretation of what that scripture was supposed to say including martin luther martin luther took his message that just shall live by faith he preached the just shall live by faith and when he preached the just shall live by faith he got it right out of the same bible that the catholics got their doctrines out of amen and he had his own interpretation to what he believed all that was supposed to be about so in other words there were loose ends left in every message amen hey listen the church age book brother brown talks about it how they smoked a pipe drank beer brother told me the other day and said you know that's not authentic history i said i don't know it's in the church book that's authentic enough for me amen and then we know that martin luther was against the the jews calling the antichrist wrote book after book about him being the antichrist but his message on the just shall live by faith was absolutely out of paul's message it was absolutely thus saith the lord for the hour and when the spirit spoke it the people who heard it they were placed into the body of christ but there was a loose end left in it even when paul preached his message he didn't finish the entire mystery of god he couldn't have he wasn't called to finish it the alpha only had the the foundational message to lay the foundation for the people of god but them seven seals were still shut up tight when paul went to nero's chopping block and now the line is going to roar when he roars seven thunders utter their voices remember he said whenever the the lamb would open up one of the seals he said there'd be a clap one clap of thunder come from heaven he said but look here when revelation 10 opens up he said them seven seals open up and then thunder sound he said it's seven continuous one two three four five six seven like that he said now what is that that's the voices of god he said gathering up all them loose ends down through the church ages and tying them all together to do what give us hope in a denominational age in an organizational age when man didn't know how to baptize or how many gods he served hallelujah or whether a woman was alive in the pulpit or not the lion came down he was the king of the jungle he was the original lion king oh hallelujah and when the lion rot out amen everything in the jungle had to shut up he said i'm tired of all the chatter i'm tired of my people not knowing what's up and down and now he rise out and everything goes quiet the lion said shut up i don't want to hear no more shall happen with your denomination everybody be quiet i've got something i want to say oh gloria what was it the lord himself [Applause] the lord himself now all of these mysteries of god down through the ages what did them seven thunders do he said each angel each night came into the room and talked to me that's what brother brahman said each angel each night in other words the mystery of god that was left undone justification the just shall live by faith but there was a loose end there because you see justification true justification is not just believing on the lord for salvation no it's not it's more than that now we know that when a man comes to christ he's justified that's true absolutely could i take that out of the bible or have the message no it's in there but that's not true justification because a man could be justified and still be lost amen amen come on now church he could be sanctified and still be lost justification is believing on the lord but true justification when the mighty angel ties that loose end up he said true justification is as though you never did it in the first place you don't have to be saved from something you've never done hey he said i said brother brethren i forgive you for getting drunk he said how can you forgive me for something i never did i said i never did get drunk he said i never went out there and went drinking he said that's what true justification is not just being saved but being self-forgiven by god it's as though it never took place in the beginning amen that was what happened when the loose end was tied together then it comes to john wesley's hour and john was his hour is what you did for god how you dressed how you thought how you talked what you did what you didn't do that was that was sanctification in wesley's day but when the lion took the book and tied the loose in together we found out sanctification had nothing to do with what i did for god but it's what he done for me that's what brought the sanctification it's not whether your hair is so long or whether you do certain things or don't do certain things amen even john wesley was so hard against predestination because he said it made the people loose and lazy and live any way he said god dwells in true sanctification amen he had the right message for his hour but there was a loose end left in it but when the lion the lord himself took his book hallelujah and tie that loose in together i realize i can't even sanctify myself oh my it took him to do the sanctification one of the biggest misconceptions we've got around ranks this message is people think they can save themselves that's true friends they've got it in their mind that they don't need help from god but we need it more now we've ever needed it why did god solve this mystery because he didn't want his people trying to get ready for the rapture thinking it's what they did to get them in the rapture i want to tell you something it doesn't matter what i do or don't do if i'm going to make the rapture god's going to make everything line up just like it needs to line up it ain't about whether or not i'm holy enough or not whole enough or righteous enough or not righteous we don't have any righteousness of ourself at all but christ himself will make my body come subject to the word of god amen and subject to christ and then i'll live a life that'll be worthy to go in the rapture amen you can't do it on your own that's the mystery and sanctification is that christ has to be the one to come take the desire out of your heart hey listen you can't take it out of your heart you can pray every day of your life study every message there is listen to every tape go to every church function live stream every preacher in the message and you'll still have that thing in your heart until god takes it out of there that's what true sanctification is hey listen we've got young people sitting here and i and i preach to the young people like i do the older ones i think i preach the older ones more than i do the little ones because the older ones are hard headed they've been in the message for many years they don't need no help they got everything figured out but we're the ones that need it the most come on now amen because there never should be a point in our life that we ever stop needing him to do something for our life we should always be dependent upon god 100 of the time the prophet said don't never be self-sufficient always rely upon him is the reason why that you and i are sitting in these pews tonight not because i've got the leg power or the stamina or whatever to get me out of the pew or out of the out of the bed or the car whatever walk me into the pew no but because christ by his grace saw fit to let me suck win long enough to sit in these pews amen that's right exactly right is his grace for many many years brother brown thought 1906 was the restoration of the holy ghost when the seals come open and that loose sin was left in there he realized it was not the restoration of the holy ghost it was the restoration of gifts because he tells us the holy ghost could not be revealed and restored until the end time that didn't mean that they didn't have the holy ghost down through seven church ages they did there's not two holy ghosts there's only one holy ghost but they didn't understand what they had they had the power of god they had the holy ghost but they didn't understand the fulbright or the full manifestation of what it is oh come on somebody amen but he said in the evening time when the token would come to the last day he said what would it do restore to us the transparent understanding of what the holy ghost really was that's why this is the hour for the manifestation of the sons of god because now you know what it's supposed to look like now you know how it's supposed to be in now you know what christ expects now we know that we're an invincible army with thus saith the lord we know it now why because the lamb the lion rather got tired of all the chatter amen oh praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord that's right he got tired of all the denominational this and that i'm going to say something everybody hang on but some man some renowned man in this message some about oh i guess december last year said when jesus returns he's looking for a tape church he said i said hogwash he's not even looking for a message church [Music] jesus isn't looking for people he's looking for a bride a bride that is washed and ready and sealed and on her way in the rapture he's not looking for a building this building will be left sitting here when you go amen when the rapture resurrection comes all of this will be left set in here and mama can have it the catholics can have it amen i ain't going to need it no more hallelujah amen they can have all that's whole world the lamb the life has roared and give us hope that's what them thunders was simple ain't it it isn't seven men with deeper revelations this way in that way it's the tying up of the loose ends of god all of these loose sins that were laying in the message all these things land in the bible that needed to be solved that's what them seven thunders returned to bring even the prophet of god set himself right before the first seal is preached he said i would have made a terrible mistake he said but the holy spirit came in the room about 12 o'clock and fixed something out that i was going to say wrong he what he was going back to his old notes his old notes didn't have the revelation on it matter of fact there wasn't a set of notes anywhere in the world that had the revelation on it christ and christ alone hallelujah had the revelation of what was laying underneath those seals somebody said when brother branham opened the seals i said i beg your pardon not to be contrary but brother brethren didn't open the seals jesus opened the seals amen it was him that's right and what it was it was the shout message the prophet of god said like this question answered on the seal he said now what is that seal he said the mystery of god going forth he said it's calling your name off the lamb's book of life as that mystery goes forth so as you were hearing the word of god being preached to you whether the rest of the world realizes it or not the holy spirit is calling your redemptive name you realize that lamb's book of life didn't have on their carson sampson or ben norod or bob coffee but that redemptive name is the name that new name i don't even know what it is myself but my theophany heard it whenever that lamb called me my theophany heard that message crying out cut out of her my people i'll receive you unto myself the message caught our neck it shouted to the bride and got her attention that's the reason why the rest of the world sits and looks like a bunch of mules let's look at let the new because they can't hear their name they don't have a name to hear but the elect has got a name she's got a name wrote in heaven and when was it wrote when was it put there before the foundation of the world the message the shout message come to alert the bride remember there was no difference between them ten virgins until the cry of the bridegroom came there were five wise and five foolish but the bible said there were ten un there were ten clean virgins ten virgin people but at midnight amen a cry went forth behold the bridegroom cometh then it says five were wise five were foolish what made the difference the opening of them seven seals it placed and positioned everybody and everything and put them in their right spot what are these seven thunders revealed to us the seven thunders was the perfect interpretation of the word let me make this simple because i know we've got young people sitting here i want them to understand this god i don't want you walking out here saying what in the world was he talking about tonight but there were questions in this bible that you didn't understand and until god in a supernatural way made a plain understanding of what it meant you still were guessing at it you're trying to figure it out it's like looking at one of them little puzzles it's got somebody hidden there and you know he's in there but you just can't see him right well when god set down this this revelation through the seven unknown thunders and they started uh he started pinning these things into the word of god and putting them on those tapes and preaching them across the platform listen brother branham when it comes to opening the seals gene's seed of god find him talking that way before the opening of the seals when he starts talking about balaam and their group and say oh we're all brothers brother i said no why not he said we're not all brothers look at him talk before that before that the angel of god had to rebuke him because he was catering too much to denomination but when them seals come open you didn't hear him cater no more why it was making a division making a dividing line it was putting everybody in their proper perspective of where they belong and it brought us a perfect interpretation of the bible any question you've got in the bible you can go to the tapes and come to church and you can understand what you don't understand that's why the message is so special to us it gives us a perfect interpretation of what was hid right in here friends i don't understand preachers in this message oh let's not say brother batman's name and let's not read quotes why why if i was in paul's day i'd be talking about paul if i was in peter's dad be calling peter's name i wouldn't be afraid to quote peter if i was living in the first century well god sent us a man just like them back to the earth i'm not afraid to quote him either amen amen and any true servant of god i'm not afraid to quote him amen i it wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit to say brother gerald lust said brother mark mark coffee said brother bob kai i mean if you're a servant of god hey it wouldn't matter to me if you're male or female if you tell me the truth i'm gonna amen it and i might repeat it amen that's right the perfect interpretation of the word watch again the seven unknown thunders revealed to us and defined for us the true character and nature of jesus christ it let us know in short terms what god loves what god hates what god believes and what god's all about the seven thunders revealed to us his true character this is why we know god hates organization he hates it he doesn't sympathize with it he hates organization i don't care if it's the same spirit in a message church he hates it as people can say that they want to but people are denominating around this message denominational spirits are creeping right into the ranks of this message you tell me they're not denominational when you go into a church supposed to believe this message and if somebody hollers out amen real loud everybody in the church cranes to look at them it's let y'all see it they're dead and they don't even know it a denominational spirit's got a hold of them you tell me they're not organizational whenever they you have to follow with their clubs and with their little groups and with their little associations and if you don't go to so-and-so's church or preaching so-and-so's convention or associate with so-and-so in the church well then you're not even really a part of the club i don't care about your club i care about god's club that's the one i'm trying to join amen and i don't join it i'm born into it amen i'm bathed into the kingdom of christ not joining the thing but it's a denominational spirit forgive me i'm going to say something really strong but we're just as denominational as the catholics are we don't rub peter's toe but we worship brother branham amen we've got all the same type of spirits amen that's exactly right we worship flesh we've run after personalities we've got if it ain't so-and-so preaching the camp or so-and-so doing so and so we don't even want to go here and listen as long as the man is anointed by the holy ghost i want to hear what he's got to say that's exactly right if he's telling me what the bible said what this message said amen and so be it what is that denominational spirit that tries to shut them things out it's right here amongst the people in this message they got no mercy on nobody they'll cut you off just like that they don't have any fellowship they're divided you tell me it ain't denominational it is you don't believe it just go to a message convention sometime and look at the little corners of people all separated off in their individual corners you think that's what god wants you think that's what this prophet tried to bring absolutely the opposite of what brother brahm tried to bring to us he wanted us to fellowship what if i disagree with him then so be it i like apple pie you like cherry but we're all supposed to be going to the very same heaven we got the same message we're brothers if we got the holy ghost oh but i don't like this and i don't like that that's denominational spirits that's exactly what it is amen that's exactly what it is oh my look here in the church age book page 349 brother braham reads now from revelation chapter 3 18 and 19. turn there with me if you would and we're going to we're going to read the read the scripture together now revelation 3 18 19 all right now i want to just take this part of the lady of cnn age now this is the lady of seeing this is the lady you'll see in time of what we're speaking of here tonight remember all of this that god does he does it to provide hope for the elect of god i mean could you imagine whenever jesus comes along and takes away their cloak for sin i preached this to you sometime last year ago but remember i talked about at the opening of the word i don't know if you remember not but he also took their cloak for sin away they couldn't hide anymore i don't know if you remember the message last year when i was bringing about that cloak of sin because you remember friends as long as they could stay covered that was a religious garment they had around their shoulders they looked like all the rest of us they could talk like us and walk like us and all of that but jesus brought the word to such a level that they couldn't hide behind their religion anymore look at what he did in the beatitudes oh he said a man's not supposed to commit adultery he said but i say if you look on a woman and lust after in your heart you've already committed adultery with him jesus brought it to such a level that they could not hide behind the message religion of that day they couldn't hide behind quotes amen they couldn't hide behind the prophet he brought it to such a level it would take grace and grace alone to get him out of that kind of mess he left him with one hope brother gerald himself that's the only hope he left him i mean you're listening to jesus i say to you be mad at your brother you've already killed him well you ain't got no hope after that pal as you can study the you study that torah inside and out you can know every word moses said but ain't no way in the world you can live that except for christ he's the only hope you've got in that way now watch him in this lady of c and age revelation 3 18 accounts of you by me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear anoint that eyes with eyes salve that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chase and be zealous therefore and repent he says i want you to buy me gold tried in the fire why they had no spiritual character of the word that you may be rich why is he saying rich because they're poor get wet white raiment on why that because they're naked see they're naked and have no clothes the shame of thy nagginess anoint that eyes with eyes have why because they're blind not only they poor wretched miserable blind and naked the bad part was lady ladies seeing people didn't even know they were in this condition the prophet said it'd be one thing if you see a man naked on the street you walk over and tell him brother you ain't got no clothes on he said oh my goodness how how did i get in the shape help me brother help me get me a coat do something help me i something's wrong somehow he said but when you walk up and tell them they're naked and they smack you in the face and say shout and get out of here he said it goes to prove what kind of age you're living in that's the time we're living in today you can tell people write about the prophet of god and tell them about the message and tell them what the prophet said and they will they will look at you and say shop i'll do my own thing blind wretched miserable naked poor blind they don't even see that they're blind they don't even see that they're naked they don't even see that they're wretched they don't even understand that they ain't got no vision to see the word of god amen that's right they can't and then he tells them as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent now watch this in the church but the man said the counsel of god is terse it is to the point he directs this last day church to one hope and that hope is in himself i counsel of thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire the only hope you've got is you've got to come to me i am your only hope he said it is evident from the phrase by of me that the lady will see and just not the legendary church is not dealing with jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom of god he said their transactions cannot be spiritual they may think they're spiritual but how can they be the works in the midst or not as paul would say philippians 2 13 god and you willing and doing of his own good pleasure what about all these churches schools hospitals missionary adventures etc he said god is not in them as long as they are denominational seed and spirit and not the seed and spirit of god so here's this age standing there an absolute blind apostasy they don't a bit more know what they're going to do tomorrow than nothing in the world their only hope they've got is upon church upon church joining upon churchianity upon this that are the other friends that that don't sound like message people tell me what it sounds like that's exactly where they've got to today they would never admit it but that's where they are now you could have a revival and call an altar call how the lord moved in this place last year and and and just the power of god we had an altar call you understand i went 17 places after that and probably had three more altar calls in the church after that you know why because i couldn't convince some of them hardheads that they needed an altar call they didn't want it they didn't have no desire to come to the altar to pray to seek the face of god well their message people why would they need it because you're blind because you're miserable because you're wretched because you're poor because you're naked and the bad part is you don't even know it no matter how many quotes i read i can read every scripture in the bible and this sit there hey who's he talking to anyhow i'm talking to you that's who i'm talking to to the people of god supposedly potentially the people of god but do they have ears to hear no they shut their hearings hearing aids off amen they don't want to hear what's got to be said and listen our hearing aid ain't some little boxing stick in your ear it's supposed to be the spirit of god amen because you don't hear when the sound reverberates off your uh off your eardrum and your your eardrum that's not hearing that's just that's your that's your body responding to the sound of vibration and noise but when you really hear it is when that word anchors in your heart and gives you a hope amen amen it gives you a hope that though this will pass away i and christ alone are the majority in this world amen let them do what they want to do but mean christ are a majority amen we're partners together amen he partnership himself with mankind brotherhood said god condescended from heaven down to the earth to do what partnership with man he wants to be one with us he wants to have a relationship with us to do what give us hope friends every promise in the bible i don't care what promise you're looking at has hope in it somewhere oh you say glory to god we need faith but we need hope with that faith we've got remember the bible said hebrews 11 1 without faith it's impossible to please god but in that first verse he tells us faith is the substance of things you have hoped for you realize people don't have any hope amen how could you trust an organizational type spirit around this message to get you ready for the rapture let man and woman do anything there is to do i i just come through an ordeal i realize this is going on the world so i'm going to be careful what i say here but i tell you one thing i have given up opportunities in many different parts of my ministry because i refuse to compromise with people i refuse to compromise preachers allowing adulterers and things to get up on the platform and lead songs and and and preach and on and on and on listen god requires holiness out of our life but we're not going to manufacture we just have to yield to it and let the lord bring the holiness out of us but if you've got a preacher in the platform that won't keep the platform clean you know what happens jesus is standing on the side of the door he's trying to not get me back in get me back in somebody let me back in hey i refuse to compromise with things like that amen there's a young woman we brought to the lord some years ago she started having an affair with a guy in the church i took all kinds of persecution because i stood against it i was told i should keep my mouth shut that i should leave the thing alone another brother that was standing against it i should have shut him up is what i was told i said let me tell you something you're not going to shut me up i'm going to get louder about it because god hates sin he will not compromise with sin of the devil tell me our churches aren't organizational look at them look at how they're getting people sitting around in the pews and they're dying spiritually it gets worse every year you know what it is denominational spirits are coming into the message can you understand why god did what he did in this last day not so we could learn a bunch of catch phrases and click phrases and learn how to say seal and thunder and this and that but to give us hope amen to give us hope and an age that has no hope in it whatsoever you realize the people we go to church with and i'm talking about around the world people we go to church with are sitting there blind miserable wretched poor naked and they don't even know it they're sitting right in the house of god and they're so completely blind to the things of god if the spirit of god moved on them they'll tell god no i'm not an emotional person i said this i said the people that don't know how to worship are the ones that ain't saved because let me tell you something when you get saved you don't go to how to worship god's school it just automatically comes out of you amen when you really got the baptism of the holy ghost there's not enough devils out of hell to stop you from raising your hands are you with me friends when god really does something in your heart and gives you a real hope inside of you there's nobody that can shut you up from worshiping god amen but nowadays you know it's a clap everybody claps on cue do you realize what that is that's a worldly trend friends that's just as worldly as people running after ball players and that's just as worldly as women wearing certain types of clothes listen i don't read in the bible where it said and the holy spirit came on the day of pentecost and they are all sitting in the pew clapping in one accord i don't mind if you clap your hands the bible said clap your hands but when you see people getting in a trend they don't say a man anymore they don't hallelujah anymore they don't glory to god they clap every time the preacher says something good that's a worldly thing i don't care who it is god doesn't want that out of us he wants worship out of us he wants us to worship raise our hands he wants tears to come out of her eyes cut out somebody he wants worship to come out of our hearts you know we're going to end up we're going to have a bunch of people on the last day that when all the older ones go off that knew what real pentecost looked like these younger ones going to be setting the pew they're going to be knotters nodders and note-takers that's what we're going to have because they don't know how to do nothing else amen you know why because we older ones ain't shown them how to do nothing else so we've come to church and become a bunch of knowledge and notetakers but listen my bible tells me that if a man is saved that the the joy of the lord is his strength amen we ought to be able to say amen and praise the lord and hallelujah or whatever you want to in the house of god if there's anybody that should do it the wisest god hope ought to be able to worship god [Applause] they just sit around yeah amen oh brother jerry i've done a pretty good job and i didn't kept it under two hours bless his heart i'm long-winded too [Laughter] that's pretty good brethren talked about the tabernacle who said the philistines come on him remember he said branham tabernacle the philistines are on he said god could do things in this tabernacle he said people be falling on their face worshiping and crying and what more before god he said now the spirit of god can do something in the time now and he said people will say well that's all right we don't mind listening to it every now and then if we're not too tired he said you see that very same thing happening around the message amen it's a trend it's a worldly thing it's a denominational spirit why should we live in such a condition when gods give us hope glory i've got hope it goes beyond the church bro i've got hope it goes beyond people this hope should give me an encouragement that if i'm in the middle of a valley and it's one of the worst valleys i've ever had i should have a hope and a peace to know god is always with me glory to god that's the hope we've got tonight we've got that kind of hope but look at these people just look at them friends look what a condition god saw them in and he didn't just cast them off and say i'll get out of here you bunch of devils and sinners and all that he said come to me come come i'll fix it i'll fix your problem if you will just come i wonder friends if people realize that god would he would figure out he would solve he he would he would settle he would answer he'd do anything that they needed if they would just simply come to him and just say god here i am i don't know what else to do nothing in my hands i bring simply to the cross i cling here i am lord whatever you want to do lord i'm putting myself in your hands amen it's what we need it's what we need we go on in time friends i'm afraid we're going to have a bunch of preachers that love to pl preach things politically they're going to be nice to the people everything is nice i still can't figure out when in the name of god that we get so nice in this message when did preachers get so nice last i checked we're supposed to preach heaven high and hell hot so when do we get so nice come on now somebody everybody's so nice nowadays and oh you're the bride and you're going to make it oh my everybody has their struggles sure we have our struggles but i but struggles is one thing but a person living in sin that's contrary to god's mind god is not going to bless somebody habitually living in sin every day of their life mistakes is one thing they ask the prophet of god are we going to do little minor things and he said absolutely he said that you'll have all kinds of things like that throughout your life he said but just to go on a living sin he said it don't happen you need to get saved if that's the case but preachers that got so nice everybody's bride everybody's elected everybody's gonna make it we preach to the people we're the super race and full of grace and friends we don't understand that sometimes people in that condition they're naked they're poor they're blind they're miserable they're wretched and they don't know it because nobody will tell them you're in that condition i don't blame the guy standing on the street corner naked if nobody will tell him he's out there on his own but if somebody'll tell him and he can listen why wouldn't we want to tell him what's truth that's what god's trying to tell these people here he's trying to tell him the reason you have no hope and brother brahman tells us about it in all the different messages he preached about the ladies in church age and the evening lights and the evening messenger and these different type of messages he makes it very plain for us what's going on he said it's the preachers and the pulpit he said preaching for a meal ticket instead of dealing with the people's soul that's where we are today amen the seven thunders revealed to us christ as our husband christ as our healer christ is our brother christ is our sanctifier amen it reveals him as our king he's our lion king it reveals him as the same yesterday today and forever and greater than that it reveals him as the one who rebukes us who chastens us and helps us straighten out and be right with god amen i was telling the brother today i said you know any time i've ever seen the holy spirit come down and bring correction to people when it's the holy ghost anytime they don't listen that bunch goes right out into impossibly i've seen many a message church down through the years the holy spirit come right down the congregation speak something to that congregation and let it go in one ear and out the other and the holy ghost never visits that group again they might be blessed a little bit here and there but eventually it ain't never what it could be and you know why because when people are stubborn and hard-headed and they won't listen when you're trying to tell them they're naked one day god just turns away from him and says i'll go to somebody who wants to hear it then amen thank god i'm one of those ones he turned to aren't you happy about it that you're one of the ones he turned to there's a thousand out there today that turned it away but you're the one that said yes you're the one that said yes lord that's what i want amen that's right psalm chapter 27 verse 4. now as you're turning there and get ready on the screen there and the rapture brother said there's three things that happen to shout voice the trumpet it has to happen before jesus appears he says now jesus does all three of them as he's he's he's he's descending a shout what is the shout it's a message going forth the living bread of life bringing forth the bride why because once the bread is issued out the bride will gather around that bread amen not pork but bread amen i just kidding you earlier about shouting loud on that i was actually the one shouting bigger i think i like it too but whenever the bread is giving forth the bride will jesus say where the carcass is glory to god hallelujah them eagles will just gather right on around that oh that's what i've been looking for all this time my hungry soul wants that word hallelujah amen what's that revelation of who christ really is something on the inside of that real child of god once that revelation starts going forth they just start lapping it up like a dog or that that you know you ever see a little dog get around a little thing of water he just that's where i am in church sometimes i can't hardly keep i'm getting it all over myself hallelujah amen why it's so precious to me the words of the lord i hunger and long for god to speak to my thirsty hungry soul it's my only hope it's the only hope i've got if i don't hear from him i don't know what to do he's the only hope that we've got left in this world friends you understand the denominations cannot produce what we can produce out of this message i challenge idiom i don't care how big they are how big their churches are this message will produce 20 times what any of their doctrines will produce i guarantee it you line up even some of our most struggling believers even some of you sitting here tonight i would take every person in this church and put your life up against one to a hundred of them denominational outfits out there let's see who has more of the power of god in their life you do why not because you're so holy not because you're so great not because you're so mighty but because this message amen put you in a possession that the shekinah glory could just fill up your being you're blessed because of where you dwell amen couldn't the children of israel said the same thing when they was over there in goshen and the lights were on they could say i'm blessed not because of who i am but because of where i'm at amen that's exactly right for all that's faults and mistakes and misgivings the people of this message are blessed beyond measure they don't even realize how blessed they are i'd take any person in here and put your life up against a hundred of them denominational outfits and i guarantee you've won more battles and you live a higher life than what they'll ever know why because of the revelation of this truth amen it does more for us than just put us in a church and make us religious it gives us an illumination of the spirit of god it illuminates christ to us in a way the rest of the world don't know nothing about oh hallelujah amen it makes christ so real that the devil recognizes it we should recognize it amen if the devil can recognize it we should recognize it hey don't kid yourself the devil knows what you're all about amen he knows you oh he watches he sees he understands what it's all about that's right look here in in psalm 27. now this is the scripture brother brown uses for the rapture one thing have i desired of the lord now i read this when i read this i read also the many things david said right desired this this for the kingdom that for his family this for that that that and then he says one thing so when i read this i see it this way that david is trying to say out of all of the things that i would desire out of all of the things i want one thing is the greatest thing of all of these the one thing i desire greater than everything else and that i will seek after is that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life o glory to behold the beauty of the lord to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me notice not you hide you amen he shall hide me you can't even hide yourself the devil sees you he knows what you're all about there are not enough quotes to hide behind it's going to take christ to hide you amen and where does he hide us in the holy ghost behind the blood brotherhood said he can't cross that bloodline because if he could he'd be our brother amen but he can't get the holy ghost he has no idea how to cross that blood the blood's more powerful than he is amen it's just like you be out in the park or you see a bunch of nonsense going on you know how this brothers you just grab your little family just come come here come here just get away from all that mask come over here and this is the way that christ is going to do us in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret glory of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock oh glory he just says come here sweetheart because come away from all that mess come over here come on i got a place for you over here come on i'll hide you i'll hide you over here glory to god hallelujah and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy glory i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord [Music] well you see after you get secured it's a good time to worship that's why i say a lot of times people don't worship they're not secured but you ever get in that securing place brother and the tears will flow and the amens and the hallelujahs will come oh glory right he will hide me now notice this in jesus's first ascension saint john chapter 20 13-19 he comes to the garden he tells mary and them don't touch me he ascends up and then verses 26 through 31 saint john 20. jesus brother man said goes up for like a private type resurrection or a private ascension rather he says he steps into the sanctuary presents himself he comes back out when he drops down into the 26th verse to the 31st verse jesus enters the doors being shut notice that saint john 21 12-17 jesus jesus now eating fish and honeycomb showing them i am not just theophany because theophany doesn't eat a drink they asked brother bradman to be on the curtain of time about about eating and drinking he he talked about not eating or sleeping or any of that here he said no no we're in the office we don't eat or drink here he said when we come back to the earth we'll take up bodies and then we'll do all that so jesus was showing i'm not just partially finishing the work i have completely finished this work amen give me fish give me honeycomb now in acts chapter 1 verse 9 when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up in a cloud received him out of their sight a cloud not rocket ship smoke y'all a cloud and while they look steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel said you men of galilee why stand gazing up into heaven this sad jesus glory to god which was taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like matter as you have seen him go into heaven so he went up body then cloud so when he returns how will he come the same exact order only in the opposite way cloud then body he went up body then cloud he comes back you'll have to be cloud then body amen and what do we see in arizona a cloud no wonder the devil hates that revelation because it was the lion roaring out those seven thunders taking possession over his domain oh hallelujah in acts chapter 3 19-21 the bible said that the heavens would hold him until the time of restoration so the cloud appeared to us to show us that the message was beginning the advent of the second coming was ushering in christ was gathering up all that was upon the earth so that we could meet them in heavenly places remember the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and then we'll meet him in the clouds in the air that's not natural clouds that's talking about the revelation of that which came in 1963. that cloud the revelation that was brought with that cloud we will meet them in the revelation of that all right hang on everybody i'm almost done we're almost to the finish line but paul in all of the rapture message or all of the preaching that he did paul did not have a rapturing message his message put him in the body of christ and everything that the rest of them preached they did not have a rapturing message they had a message and put them in a body of christ they had a message that would put them in eternal life but they didn't have rapturing faith in their message listen to me it wasn't until the lion finished the mystery on this side that the capstone could set down on the rest of it all the way down through them ages and then what paul preached connected with this would bring rapturing faith for the entire body paul said in the hebrews they without us cannot be made perfect brother said i preached exactly what paul preached he did in restoring restoring restoring the original word he preached what paul preached but paul didn't preach him seals paul didn't preach the book of revelation paul never touched the book of revelation that was left to this age all of the things that was left in that age with paul he had all the message he needed to start the work but there was no rapturing faith in what paul preached for that day it took this message it took the opening of these seals to bring rapturing faith not just for us but for all seven church ages everyone that laid in the ground plum up to the apostle paul it took this message to connect with all this to bring rapturing faith for the whole body so you see you're not just getting rapture and faith for yourself you're getting it for 2 000 years of saints that's went to the ground they're waiting on us they are waiting on us to finish this mystery of god no wonder he wanted to give us hope what other choice did we have amen all of that laying in the ground that's why there are cloud around us remember what paul said it's a cloud around us well that's right that's the revelation that came down when the head come down what was the head doing it was getting ready to unite with the rest of the body listen friends i'll tell you the way brother carol said it for for for i'll use his language 100 years he's not a hundred years old but he said he's 100 years but the capstone itself look at it all of this is imperfect it's imperfect it's not exactly perfected but that is a perfect capstone within itself it's perfect in itself but when that sets down on the rest of that it makes the rest of that perfect too [Applause] you realize jesus said matthew 5 48 be ye therefore perfect as my father in heaven is perfect and heaven is the capstone on earth as the rest of the characteristics the seven thunders revealed to us the character of jesus christ and once that character begins moving in the heart of the bride and the holy ghost produces all of them virtues out of our life he said then that capstone will set down on the rest of the body and it'll make you perfectly god walking in your two shoes oh i'm about to speak in another language right now amen and amen and amen now why not the devil hates us like he hates us it's the same one he faced when jesus was here only just in many more members [Laughter] oh thank you jesus thank you lord god setting down on the rest of the body god setting down on the rest of us makes all of them perfect how can luther who called the jews antichrist how can he be perfected because when his divine commentaries wrote way up here in this last stage the divine commentary for all of these are being road huh because you realize when martin luther took his last breath god justified the man and put him in the sixth dimension you realize this now all of that was laying against his life why there was no preaching to say compromise there was nobody to say different wesley comes along he tries to straighten it up it's just as much a mess when wells he tries to get a hold of is when luther had it why they're reformers not prophets it wasn't given to them to straighten out the revel the revelation comes to a prophet doesn't come to another regular men it don't come to me it doesn't come to you it comes to a prophet and then he comes all the way down here to this last stage and he preaches it is as though you never done it in the first place so when he justified us he justified all the rest of them down through the rest of them ages because by straightening that mystery up it straightened all the rest of it out glory to god no wonder they were waiting on us no wonder they were waiting on us all them un them loose sins and undone parts hanging out there in space and when the mighty angel comes down to a sin or descend rather onto this capstone work unto all of the ages that have been finished on this capstone work and he descends down to place the capstone on it without that all of them things left in them church ages would have been against every one of those men luther would have had to answer to god for calling the jews the antichrist because that message was left undone but when them seven thunders sound and god brings the revelation plain what did brother branham say he said just like it was in the old testament god winked at their ignorance down through them church ages because of misinterpreted theology oh i feel like shouting now hallelujah just like with marriage and divorce he said god and don't you do that thing again he said misinterpret theology is what made the mess we've got today amen amen amen amen they had the same bible the same revelation but they didn't have the understanding of it pulled from the word and here brother breton has got the he's got the pulpit god meets him out there on finger rock and he starts bringing the revelation on marriage and divorce and you know all these people setting in conditions god would have judged them for being adulterers but because justification was on the scene god could justify them for all of them past actions he wasn't just justifying that bunch sitting there in parkview junior high school there was 2 000 years of mess that needed to be straightened out god was straighten it out for the entire body how many of those men and women went by the way of the grave not really understanding what marriage and divorce is all about listen paul preached many different things about marriage and divorce but he had the same words of jesus that we've got and here he's got all these people set in all these conditions look at him in the book of romans and in corinthians when he goes to them gentiles out there and said you were extortioners and idolaters and thieves and homosexuals and this and that such for some of you before christ came into your life it's i speak it by permission this says i not the lord brother man said look at moses stand there he gave him a rally of divorce because of the hardness of their heart and no adulterer shall enter into the gates of heaven but when that prophet stood there and straightened that mystery of god out it made a through way for every single one of them to walk streets of gold oh glory to god hallelujah now why did the devil hates the revelation of this message he knows you shut it down you shut down 6 000 years of mercy and grace to the people of god how many then people in the old testament laying in the grave right now whenever whenever that message came forth god as you are don't you do it again brother let me tell you something i don't believe shouting was just there in part view junior high school or when you heard it your tape and your that tape in your car for the first time but i believe on the other side of glory brother gerald i believe there were people shouting and glorifying god amen amen i was in that mess too thank god i've been justified amen amen amen here's my last point we're going to close first kings chapter 18 verse 29 they tell me quit saying i'm going to close this i never do makes people anxious they think i'm going to close and i keep going that's what you call filler we preachers use a lot of filler amen amen it don't mean i'm going to close i'm just trying to make you think i am i guess first kings chapter 18 verse 29. now let's look at just a little something before we go home oh don't you love the word of god amen it's beautiful isn't it first kings i want you to see this this type in here of elijah we know where he's at he's up here with these prophets of baal and he's got a certain ministry he's gonna have to perform here and watch this type come right back up here in the end time verse 29. now i'm not going to read it all we're just going to skim over just catch the highlight of this it came to pass when midday was passed they prophesied to the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice so it is the evening time verse 30 and elijah brings all of the people near to him what does he do he repairs the altar of the lord remember the first and second pool was the first and second pull was to catch the attention of the people by the mark and bring all the people's attention upon him you see billy graham and oral roberts had great ministries they could bring the people out but they had nowhere to take them into amen because they had no revelation to take them in do you realize they're calling billy graham america's pastor i said sure because they rejected their real one their real one was elijah brother brown was the real pastor of america well sure they wanted billy billy would bring them out they could come to the altar pop and gum telling jokes and go back the same type of people there was as great a man as he might have been in the eyes of the people he had nowhere to take him when he brought him out that's why brother brown was given a sign in the hand that's why he was given that discernment because like elijah here he's gathering all the people he's getting all the people around the altar of the lord once he gets them all gathered in by the thousands and the thousands and the 10 000 he starts repairing the altar of the lord now watch what he does this is this is beautiful people don't believe in predestination when they they read this right here it ought to convince them about predestination verse 31 elijah took the 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob well that don't matter god just saves anybody then why is he doing this every man has their predestinated position in this altar this economy of god so he's positioning every one of them according to their predestinated order of god and guess what when moses and elijah raise up out of them 144 000 over there and start bringing the people back to the revelation of this message brother branham said that holy ghost will use them prophets to set all them tribes back in their proper tribal order again lord of god because brother i don't care how far you get away from god if you're a part of his economy he'll bring you back to your proper order somewhere amen i don't care what he's got to do if he's got your name in the palm of his hand brother look out trouble's coming for you if you don't straighten out amen amen he'll bankrupt heaven and he'll turn the earth upside down just to get you in your right position [Laughter] amen somebody said how do you know they're saved i said because their world's upside down god must think something about him because if he doesn't he don't care he just leaves him alone verse 32 the stones he built this altar watch he's building it up makes a trench about the altar with two measures of seed first pull second pull old testament new testament you type it many ways here justification sanctification two measures of seed he put the wood in order see god even believe in church order back in he puts the wood in order and cuts the bullock in pieces laid him on the wood and said phil far barrels matthew mark luke and john glory fill four barrels up oh my thank you lord jesus amen and fill them with water and put it upon the burnt sacrifice and on the wood remember four also represents earth represents earthly deliverance and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water so it wasn't just halfway around the altar this went all the way around the altar for in revelation 4 when the revelation comes back it's round about the altar is the rainbow all the way around blueberry said what it represent he said the entire revelation has come back into full view amen elijah said if i'm going to restore this i've got to restore all of it i can't leave no stone unturned amen in this case literally watch oh the water ran about the altar he filled the trench verse 36 came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening of sacrifice elijah the prophet came near amen malachi 4 5 i'll send to you elijah the prophet said the lord god of abraham isaac israel let it be known this day to thou that god in israel that i am thy servant i have done all these things that thy word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art lord god and thou has turned their heart back again amen what did he say in the church his book it would be the sounding of them seven unknown thunders that will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal faith of the fathers amen that very revelation will literally turn us right back to the original way friends people that don't believe in the opening of the word they haven't been turned back yet that's all there is to it they're still stuck in 1906 pentecost they're stuck in 50s revivals and tent meetings around the country but at the opening of the word it takes them into a whole other level altogether of christ it turns their heart back look at how beautiful this is then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice the wood the stones the dust licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw they fell on their faces and said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god and then elijah turns my look takes the prophets of baal let not one of them escape elijah brought him in to brook keyshawn and slew them there and elijah said to ahab gavin drake over to god for there is the sound of the abundance of the latter rain the former rain has been sown the word has been sown into the hearts of the bride and now it's time to bring that which has been sown into full maturity let it rain lord let it rain let it fall in the abundance of rain amen oh jesus so elijah built in the altar was building up all of this it gets the trench dug it gets the wood in order gets the stones in their place but when the fire fell brother it went from the first pool to the second pool it went from matthew mark luke and john it went from the water of the word to the capstone which was the fire the fire was the capstone that set down on the rest of it and made manifest notice the people did not recognize he was the lord god until the fire fell upon the altar and neither will you and i recognize who jesus is in this last day until holy ghost and fire falls upon us and consumes every part that's been set in order by this word that's why we have got to be restored back by the preaching of elijah the prophet and any man of god that stands in this platform has got to say only what those tapes said or he's preaching false doctrine men in that first stage i heard people say contrary to paul they said you're not saying what paul said same thing today they leave that message you're not saying what brother branham said amen they've got to stay with the original word i don't care people like it or not brother branham was the man god used to place this message in its proper order and god wasn't going to bypass him to pick up an oral robbers god wasn't going to bypass him to pick up a billy graham god wasn't going to bypass him to pick up a jack coe and if we're supposed to be the bride god ain't going to bypass you and i for anybody else we are the ones going to finish this mystery of god we're the ones going to finish this revelation of god nobody else can take my position i hear the prophet of god say if god placed you in his book before the foundation of the world he said nobody nobody can take your place in christ's body amen hang on everybody but i'm just as eternal as god as he turned on i am him his revelation is me i am his revelation of this last day we are the devil hates that boy hey he hates that man he don't like that revelation coming but when the bride is doing the talking that's what he's scared of that's what he backs up off of is the revelation of jesus christ in the heart of his bride and when we use these quotes we don't use these quotes we live these quotes when we read these books we don't read these books we absorb the spirit of god and manifest the promise in that word amen absorbance to his word like a sponge we just take it all in and then you squeeze me out it comes amen amen that's what i said about the squeeze somebody said i'm so worried about the squeeze worried about the squeeze worried about the squeeze i said did you ever see a sponge i said yes i said you ever stick it down in a bucket yes i said what happens all that water soaks up in the sponge i said then what do you do next they said we squeeze it i said yeah that's right that's exactly right because then all that was in that sponge is going to come out i said god i'm not running from the squeeze i'm running to it i hope it gets here quick because whatever's on the inside of me and that hour the prophet said we look away to jesus and what you've seen manifested temporarily will be manifested in full power [Applause] amen just like a sponge and out it comes you want to know what a man's really all about put him under pressure one time see what's in him squeeze him one time see what he's all about amen amen he don't prove what he is when he's on the mountaintop everybody cut out somebody and i'll prove what he is but everything's going good he's got a bank account full of money and everybody loves him but put some pressure on him one time you'll find out what he's all about then give him a good squeeze [Music] god lord i know it's coming but help me while i've got a chance to absorb all of this and just just keep absorbing until my being my mind my thoughts every fiber my actions my behavior my character to all of it is just so full of jesus christ that if you even poke me out a little a little piece of christ will just fly out you know the part of the lord will just if you just squeeze give me a little squeeze a little love a little grace a little merciless just pop out amen somebody said how are you going to turn your cheek on them is it i said you kidding me you'll be so full up of the love of god that they even even smite you they don't want to smite you on one sheet because the love will fly at them on the other side amen you know what it's like when you take an old rag or sponge that's full and you just sling it around just goes everywhere amen i said do what they want to the bride the more pressure they put on or the more love of god shall spread to the world amen hallelujah but it was in the evening time i hear the sound of the abundance of rain remember the latter rain didn't just bring the bride to their full position but it brings everybody every seed that's in the ground the economical seed under billy graham well roberts that whole thing it brings all of it to its fruition the latter rain is the fulfillment of your position and the maturity part of it in christ in other words if they were a little baby at communicable when it comes time for latter rain they're all growed up ecumenical if they're a little pentecostal when it comes time for a lot of rain they're all growed up pentecostal if she was an infant bride in 1962 by time this revelation come open and when it comes open to you comes open to me we're not a little infant bride anymore we're fully matured seed of god amen coming to the manifestations manifestation of the sons of god full power full authority i love this i got to tell you you keep pulling i keep preaching i can't quit just yet but i love this part brother brahman said the bride will come to position said where she'll step out and said when she does she'll take every power of the devil's god and just strip him of every power he's god hey brother you don't realize it yet but that little life of god that lives on the inside of you it's bringing you to more than just a body change bringing you more to just being saved it's bringing you to a position in christ that will bring hope for 6 000 years of dead saints because remember the resurrection that paul spoke of ain't just for the lady of sian ain't just for the ephesians it ain't just for two thousand years brother brahman said adam will take a hold of eve's hand like this glory he said then they'll reach over and get a hold of another age and then another age another age the last shall be first the first shall be last glory to god and watch just be them in the new testament but it'll be all the way down six thousand years they'll just connect and all of them will raise up to meet jesus in the air hallelujah and you've been to walmart i know and you've seen those little glass cases where they got missing people in them you know once i'm out so and so missing so-and-so missing one of these days brother carson somebody gonna walk in walmart my picture's going to be on the front of that they're going to say we went to newfoundland and we knew brother ben he got off the plane but where'd he go after that brother man said think of it missing people upon the earth he said 500 disappear every single day nobody knows nothing about it he said the coming of the lord will be the same exact way there'll be two in the field we'll be light side of one part of the earth there'll be dark side on the other part of the earth he said i want to be at the mill want to be in the bed sleeping said but when jesus comes the sound of god will awaken the entire heart of the bride hallelujah and shall raise up to meet jesus in the air a sharp pain will go through your body and then you'll be changed back to young man and young woman again oh glory to god it'll happen in a moment and a twinkle of an eye it'll be so fast you won't even be able to get a selfie of it it'll go so fast there's not a camera in the world to be able to catch it because you'll have to be synchronized to the revelation of this hour and that revelation as it comes forth in the heart of the bride as that revelation proceeds forth and grabs a hold of you that same revelation will just and you'll be gone i've been waiting my entire life to say this to the devil now you see me no you don't glory hallelujah amen amen will be taken away as my dale potter many years ago said there's been cosmonauts there's been astronauts he said but enoch was the first was not right now god took him out of here the word he uses whatever the mark for took is wrapped like you know the claw of a bird the raptor rapture rapture and he said in the time of trouble he shall hide me in other words he'll take me out of this whole world brother said it'll come to a spot it won't be a fitting place for the bride to live in anymore it'll become so unfit for us he'll just reach down with that great eagle claw mom will just pull us out of this old age and say come over here sweetheart there's a wedding supper three and a half years wedding supper waiting on you glory to god amen i don't know if we'll be eating beans taters i don't know be eating jiggy dinner or what we be eating glory to god amen but whatever's there brother sister amen we'll be there worshiping god glorifying god hallelujah with tears coming out of our eyes worshiping and praising i made it i made it i made it to this place you know when your hope will cease when you step into the promised land of god and you see gates of pearl and streets of gold the greatest revelation i want you to listen to me and understand the greatest revelation of your life at that moment is not going to be that there are streets of gold hey these gates are actually pearl but whenever you look down and see your feet walking down them streets of gold and you look around and your hands are in a new city and you look at your feets but your phone and say look at my feets my feet were new he said glory look at my hands and my hands were new and you realize you're walking in that city you're not gonna be looking all right now how tall was them gates of pearl let's see did they get them exactly measured some of them carpenter brothers have their measurement tape out let's see it's exactly the width and the breath and all right is peter he's supposed to be where he's at that won't be the revelation that gets you but the revelation will be is when you see yourself standing there in a new body in an eighth day paradise that will never end never began it's been eternal all this time you just slip back into eternity the greatest revelation will be when you realize i made it after all amen and you know what's beautiful about it you won't be able to say at that moment because i prayed is because i listen to the messages because i studied because i lived right you know what will happen you'll be saying amazing grace amen how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like you and me that'll be the great revelation of it amen but we have hope amen we have hope stand with me oh thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah he said the coming of the lord will be universal he said showing not just in a certain corner but universal said that secret moment says she's ready she's dressed and she's waiting for it can i say one more thing two four quid this bride that's waiting on the coming of the lord like this she's a lot like that rancher's girl or the girl that the rancher's son was gonna marry remember he promises certain times certain days certain hour i'm coming back for you and then she of course the story goes she's dressed she's waiting she's looking for him but you know all our pentecostal baptist methodist sisters making fun of her oh sure he's coming for you sure but do you know how she knew he was on his way you ever been out west you ever seen the desert you ever see a car or something drive on the desert what usually do you see before you recognize what's driving a dust cloud when she looked coming down the road she knew it was her prince charming because the first thing she saw was a cloud accompanying his return glory to god and when she saw that cloud she knew that was her lord up there amen that's the way it is with you and i we recognize the hour we're living and we recognize more importantly ourself as part of this great economy of god i'm so thankful for it i don't even know what to do with myself can we just raise our hands and just glorify him praise the lord you say lord thank you thank you thank you lord let me hear you let me see hallelujah thank you for clothing lord thank you for giving me eyesight thank you lord for revelations oh god that
