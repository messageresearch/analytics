[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Amen praise the Lord god bless just turn with me to st. Luke's Gospel chapter 24 and who asked the Saints to put sister Rose Gayle on your prayer list and Rose Gayle is brother Claude Gail's daughter and she's living in Alberta she called a couple of days ago in fact Friday I believe she called and on my cell phone and requesting prayer because she's suffering from cancer she has experienced it in the past and we prayed and the Lord has spared her and brought her on quite some time and so she called to request prayer again because certain forms of cancer have come back and it's in her left thigh and her lymph node in the neck and also in her shoulder but it's all on her left side and suffering prayer from lymphoma so she is in desperate need so pray the grace of God for the salvation of her soul and the grace of God for the healing of her body amen God is there to heal us spiritually God is there to heal us physically amen well really in the eyes of God has already done he's asking us to believe it so I pray grace to help our sister Rose Gayle to believe a man and she again thank thank me for the funeral service of her father brother Claude and she said brother I have to be honest because she wasn't there but she did hear it by DVD and she said brother she said thank you she said it didn't seem like a funeral service so she says thank you she said that you you made it that kind of a service well I said well it was the Lord and knowing that even many of our Pentecostal brethren was in the in the field of service in the funeral Hall in Deer Lake and OH amazing and I said Lord I should you're with us you're here and a number of them had already testified to me and thanked me and thanked and they were glad for brother Claude's testimony because they had fellowship with him and they said oh it was just wonderful and they said is his faith in the Lord and what he would tell them about Jesus and so on it made Christ more real to them and during the funeral service they they said my this is wonderful because through them also it just didn't seem like a funeral service no because he's not dead even we're not preaching someone is dead who were preaching that dirt they've gone from time to eternity a man there out of that body and they're gone into earth theophany body and which most of the world doesn't even know about those things because the world still thinks you know it's like when I driven past the graveyard and someone say I mean he's dead there nobody you know what it comes to dead they're all dead physically yeah but again during another dimension somewhere a man but most of the world doesn't know that most the world doesn't understand that because they thought when a person died they buried them that's it during degree no brother that's that's the sinful body but he's going to give him a glorified body a man one day he's gonna be ya know he don't want that one a man that would that one came under a curse a man so I said no and he's dead there when it comes to that physically he said they're all dead but I said they're in another dimension and I trust I said that most of them are in there the dimension that that Lazarus was in not the rich young ruler but ladders praise the Lord and I must say during our brother Klaus funeral I really appreciated the support of our Pentecostal brethren there and because they also were encouraged by the word that God was giving him by the spirit and the anointing that was in the funeral service they just loved it a man and I appreciated the fact that a Pentecostal pastor had also come to prayed during the funeral service and a Pentecostal brother there that we're familiar with and he was playing the piano accordion and he for us and he also came up as saying a special and not only that they were at the funeral in Bishop Falls there at the cemetery so it was good and and our brother Claude's daughter Rose was really really loved it really appreciated it so I pray God continue to bless sister Rose Gail so remember her in prayer as I said she's living in new in Alberta right now the grace of God to her amen in st. Luke's Gospel chapter 24 and beginning to read at verse 45 and then openiy their understanding that they might understand the scriptures amen that's what we need is understanding of the Word of God and the and said unto them thus it is written and thus it be you Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance a man after his death his burial his resurrection he says repentance and remission of sins should be preached a man praise the Lord now after his death Beulah resurrection it can be preached so he said and that again not just remission of sins but repentance repentance will lead us to the remission of and it should be preached in his name a man again that's why we went forth into water baptism Farrar with a vessel in the name praise the Lord and again it is a singular name in the name among all nations and it's got to be in his name beginning at Jerusalem and your witnesses of these things praise the Lord and the old I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high god bless his words you may be seated so I want to share with you some thoughts some scripture other scriptures and thoughts on repentance there's make our calling and election sure and we've got to go back to the beginning we got to go back to the beginning of our relationship with the Lord a man and it begins with the hearing of the word of God a man and he opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures sir brother begins with the word and the word is going to point us to salvation the word is going to show us and reveal to us what we had to do took enter into a relationship with the Lord a man and brother it begins absolutely it begins with with number one it's the conviction of the word and the conviction of the word is going to lead us to repentance so that what we have to do is to make sure that we have repented a man not a nun are just like a form of godliness brother but it's absolutely from our hearts a man and we really experience repentance it is an experience a man is not a form of godliness that you there you're going to go through but it's something here you experience brother if there's anything that we have with the Lord is an experience if you've got a relationship with God you've got an experience with God if you've got a relationship with God you experience God mother and it begins for the airing of the word of God understanding the Word of God and then responding to the Word of God a man and responding to the Word of God this is what they did under day of Pentecost this is what the disciples did and and brother and Jesus was highlighting the the thing that he's going to see in his in his elect and his sons and his daughters and in his seat a man in the children of God what's he going to see first he's got to see humility they're going to hover themselves a man acknowledging their need of God they're going to over themselves acknowledging their need of Christ acknowledging a man their need of the word of God a man and it's going to lead them to repentance praise the Lord so if you're humbled a man and again there's a revelation of the Word of God that God gives is the revelation of the word that is preached and it's and and the intended route is to Humble us amen it is to humble you because I tell you to review to repent you have to humble yourself a man because without humility there's no no real sincere honest heartfelt repentance a man and then there are many that this meal they come to an altar well that's repenting no no there's more to it than that brother there are those that went to the altar and really didn't repent as God wanted them to there are those that just set in their seats and repented a man and God and God saw it in their hearts God saw it in their souls that they repented a man and that they were born again they'll praise the name of the Lord so they had an experience with God because they recognize what they recognize their need to repent and they recognize their need for God by the grace of Almighty God so we will get into that some other thoughts a man so you see you can consider it I want I want you to consider ever I repented a man and you know well oh yeah I'm in church and I take the communion and I've been baptized yeah I repented no that doesn't mean you repented I said there's many there's many in church didn't that takes communion does many that do this and do that but still they have repented amen and we'll get into see what what repentance is and let's see if you really truly repented a man a man and because that's the only way that God is going to acknowledge you the only got way God is going to receive you and that's the only way they do to get the Holy Ghost to be born again you got every pendens what all you know you don't be born again and then repent no you repent a man that repentance that when it comes to being born there there's birth pains a man so part of the birth pains is repentance a man is really getting yourself down a man it's really it's really humbling yourself it's really dying to yourself by the grace of Almighty God a man so that it is it is painful a man to let go and let God have his way so what is repentance repentance is to change your mind anybody so now you don't think your thoughts anymore it's not your thoughts it's not your words it's not your deeds it now is God in you amen and repentance brings us to this place amen repentance brings us to a new creature in Christ repentance brings us to the place to us again as we say in the scripture stairs Paul said is not me that lives as Christ liveth in me amen brother s genuine repentance but again there's always that still say that but there but but it's not Christ living in them amen because they'll go so far but then they'll still maintain some of their own thoughts some of their own ideas some of their own wishes they're gonna do this they're gonna do that I want to do this I want to do that the Lord won't mind this the law won't mind that will you don't care you wanna do you want the will of God in yet anybody you don't want your will anymore you want God's will amen so when it comes to your decisions your thoughts your words your dates now if you're born again you've truly repented and you got born again it's Jesus it's Jesus thoughts it's Jesus words a man is Jesus deeds it's Jesus motivation in you now not you no more it's not what my flesh wants is what Jesus wants it's not what I would I what I like or what I want to do this I want to do that I want to go here I want to go there what does Jesus want remember it's not you that lives no Morris Christ that liveth in you amen so by pray grace brother that whatever your actions and reactions it's Jesus she that's why you're on your guard amen you're on your guard because you don't want to leave the wrong impression of Jesus hey not not to Jesus you don't want to leave the wrong impression of Jesus to the world hey man just say the way you act the way you live the way you talk amen and your reaction you're reflecting Jesus because you're professing to be a Christian and what is a Christian Christian is Christ like a man not like mom and dad you're like your heavenly father by the grace of God and yet there's so many out there that are so-called believers and so-called Christians but I tell you this Deen crunch like a million they made their Antichrist like yeah I'm more like the ad equates to Christ and then the reflecting not not the true revelation of Jesus the reflection a false revelation of Jesus the reflecting the Devils revelation of Jesus amen and brothers taking a word up on a word in whatever but you got to leave it the way it is now I'll tell you how did you reflect Jesus today our you're reflecting Jesus now how will you reflect Jesus when you go outside the door how will you reflect Jesus went where at your job will you reflect Jesus to family and friends and neighbors remember that's the ones you got to be careful those that are closest to you amen it's now those that are out there there's Ohio High Noon all right thank you so I know you gotta have a right attitude and a right spirit amen it's like I was talking we mentioned I think to brother Matthew that myself sister Betty had at us Costco it was we're there and oh my and we noticed this this gentleman there I'll call him brother and because of his attitude nice spirit and yet he was in and we're this cart and he had this six month old child didn't look that all but six my little child I said Lord my I said that's nice nice spirit I said oh I'm wondering who they were so huh and so we went over and oh yeah and and he was right Ian as a word with us myself with sister Betty and I said Maya almost as if we knew him all our lives you know and Alma says he knew us all of our lives and so on and so we just started to talk basic about the child and about about you know children and fathers and mothers and so on and it was amazing I said Lord I said what a wonderful spirit they got and again I no doubt maybe they looked at us maybe looking sister Betty they would consider us to be Christian you know some kind of a church or whatever but did that they weren't offended with those things all we entered into a like a fellowship oh yeah talking with him and he couldn't even enter into a filter with the child and the trial all loved us oh look did he looking at us and and laughing and smiling at us and all lot wonderful and then the mother came and at a wonderful spirit and I said god bless them I said Lord I said maybe according to ISO believe us it was your will that we made you meet him here it was your will I saw that we have cross cross paths there and Laura maybe we'll cross paths again I said what I said I sense I said there's an anointing their Lord and there's a spirit there so god bless them amen so brothers sister let's reflect Jesus amen brother sister oh my what a spirit there I want to enter that I don't know they were Christian of what they were never we never got to that but I said lord help us to reflect Jesus a right spirit and a right attitude a man and brother is not and again you can have a right spirit right attitude and not Christian but you got to reflect the spirit to the Christian right spirit and the question right attitude is not just go there and I'm a Christian so I can't do this I can't do that I can't say this no you go there's a life you got to live a man there's a right so that's not you living is Jesus living in you it's Jesus did that's there is Jesus like I said it's Jesus has seen your house it's Jesus is in your job hey man oh yeah so they don't know they're they work with Jesus yeah it's like I said I believe in the last sermon there and the problem of God said you're gonna you're gonna be standing in judgment against them hey man you're either gonna point them to Jesus or you're gonna judge them and where the prophet of God said they'll say well I didn't know you ready to see you and and the Bible said Jesus was showed up on the upon the sky and he said Who and he said you know show you a man he'll reflect you standing next to that person it reflect you may be working with that person it reflect you may be doing something with that person amen and he'll say well there was me I was I was there that was me that wasn't that person brother what kind of a life did that person live for God to put it on the sky and judge that other person by it amen did we live Jesus did we reflect Jesus to that extent so that brother in the judgment that God can use me to judge that person because I was I was representing Jesus and they refused Jesus they turned Jesus down when they turned you down hey may their issues Jesus testimony when they refused yours amen brother God hidden and God revealed in simplicity hey so began as say as I said when I when I ministered years ago some years ago rather to ours and our sister Barnes's children amen praise the name of the Lord all here are the believers you know oh my you know don't don't preach them longer than this and so on believers yeah critical of the time though as I was using the breach and there was a choir city and a choir sitting in the balcony and not not believers there they were from a certain church and oh they went and mentioned to somebody after and they said to them and they and that person came to me and told me and they said oh listen they called the gentleman by name they said we need that preached in our search yeah praise the name of Lord they won't complain it and knowing that the the person that was the manager of the field of hope and he stood he was standing in the doorway and he and he never moved he stood there listening to the sermon and he would he would respond oh he meant yeah and after the serve after the funeral and he said pastor he said don't you shorten your sermon for me it's acidity so that was good oh yeah I said what and here's believers huh the time boys it's time stop no they didn't want me to stop they want me to go on and that when I

funeral yeah we need to even do the cemetery so on so brother I pray God as believers that we got a right attitude right spirit I asked my neighbor still were reflecting Jesus a man as but now we're not over there just to say well we believe the message and this is why I dress the way I dress and and act the way I act and so no it's Christ in you you're born again a man you are born again now it's crazy and control of your thoughts Christ in control of your actions and your reactions I know I'll tell you this brother there's a lot of believers out there it's those are they're going to judge them not them judge believers so brother we better make sure that we repented amen the way God wants us to repent amen though we're sorry for what we've done him for our sin them where we were reborn and so on amen and that recognizing our absolute need of Jesus and without him we can do nothing amen but with him all things are possible amen so are you reflecting Jesus again in your home by reflecting Jesus into your family and friends and neighbors are you afflicting Jesus to where you're working yeah or they think you're just religious no no more than religious you're a new creature in Christ hey man there's a lot of religious people oh yeah I work with religious people as I said probably what you got you got to have a spirit you got to have an attitude and and so on that that reflects Christ it goes beyond religion it's Christ again like I told you when I worked in with the Americans and so on and and now I was walking across the kitchen there and and and that elderly gentleman they come to me and say brother always said thank you he said I want to thank you said you're a Christian I see I'm a Christian yes he said you're a Christian I know that he said oh by the way by your your attitude your spirit oh I said well I said thank the Lord I said that's the Lord yes he said I know he said but he said just want to let you know oh yeah I didn't tell him I was Christian no it's just that I just went and did this and did it this way they say I had this attitude this spirit and so on so brother I pray grace you're not gonna take on their spirit let their spirit let the spirit you got get on them hey man now there's some that would avoid you was this all right do it for the glory of God a man and give God the glory amen what is it it's humbling yourself so that's not you it's Christ in you you don't want them to know you you want to know Christ amen you're gonna get Prima's to Christ probably God preached this message tonight July 1963 humble thyself hey man why what was he seeing you've seen a lack of humility and more and more things time went on the less and less humility he was seeing the last thing less humanity he was he was finding in the people brother not just out there in the world but even among so-called believers because bearers they can they can take pride oh I believe this I believe that so on yeah they got pride foolishness humble yourself a man God's not looking for old to be think you're somebody out there no no if you got the Holy Ghost and you got Christ and you really truly repented amen brother and you got the Holy Ghost in your heart it'll humble you you know jesus never wasn't boasted about himself no the disciples thought he should do this you should do that but no he wouldn't do that amen he went forth as the simple simplicity of the revealed Word of God amen amen memory again that's why the father price in the opening the seals amen the first message he preached in the open the seals God hidden and God revealed in simplicity a man and he said now he said I know he said I'm gonna say things he said you're not going to get it not gonna get it oh no he's not gonna strike it this way you want you won't recognize it yeah and even after he finished now he said I knew you wouldn't want to get this and get that there are certain things he said they still never got amen and brother after all those years they still missed it well well he said that yes he said that a man and again he said he said look he said what was once God's great secret and great mysterious secret in his mind is now in the hearts of the believer and he said that is the body of Christ the believer is the body of Christ amen he said what was God's once great secrets in his mind before the foundation of the world and he said has now made manifest the mystery of God he says think of it oh I'm sure he said we don't get it he said I can't say it I can't see it the way I ought to see it and he said I'm sure he says you don't a man brother let's get more and more of the Holy Ghost in us so we're gonna see it the way we should we should see it amen that this was 1963 Christ the mystery of God revealed a man you saying I don't see it the way should see it and I said no you don't but there's a generation that's gonna strike them the way it should a man and it's gonna give them the faith that God wants them to have and brother we're moving into that realm of the resurrection of the rapture and this to give us that faith my brother the word has got to strike you a certain way to give you that faith hey man it's got to strike me a certain way gonna strike you a certain way but brother to strike us the way that it should we truly have got to experience repentance we've got to have a repentant attitude and a repentant spirit amen yes sir what it's absolute humidity by the grace of Almighty God brother repentance belief humility leads to repentance so they don't strike us the way that it should a man in this hour and in this age brother because it's over 50 years sister going to the Prophet amen so much longer will it be for the rapture for the resurrection amen I've been looking for it like I said as many times I go and look at the window and I said Lord where is the resurrection where's the rapture Lord we're calling for it lower we're a hungry poor were thirsting for oh yeah amen but I tell you this if we got if we got them the Holy Ghost and we're born again if we really got a repentant heart ambled a man we're going you got to be humble to look up get down to look up a man by the grace of Almighty God so brother how many are really looking up for them not only New Yorker ton dollar to be just there's not me no I married that are looking for the rapture now I'm ready looking for the resurrection over there believing they believe in a rapture they believe in a resurrection unlocking more but I tell you if you got the revelation assured you're gonna be looking for most definitely but I tell you what it takes it's gonna take absolute repentance a repentant attitude a repented spirit oh yeah in your heart and in your soul you're down and because you repented a man but the hope in your heart and what you're looking on a man but those that are down look up by the grace of God amen in the in the bay in the message or ability humble yourself he said if you'll read that little book of Jude and he said you just learn a whole lot now what brother Vale has said and he said I earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints but you're earnestly content for it earnestly morning noon and night amen brother you can't get away from the revelation you can't get away from the theme of it Luther couldn't get away from the theme of what God was dealing with in his life no way he couldn't get away from it look at the sacrifices he made and the things that he did to get more and more and more and then once the struck him oh brother oh he was it was getting more and more into it and he started to praise God more he was praying then he started to praise the Lord a man he went from prayer to priests a man to lay his life down oh yeah he told him he said here I stand I can do more no more he said the just shall live by faith when they stay threatened they're gonna kill him and do this and do that and so on yeah he's there I stand I can do more no more he wasn't gonna he wasn't going to compromise so brother don't compromise with Beverly don't compromise her friends don't compromise whatever you do remember each we're going to compromise with him you're compromising with Jesus yeah you cut you off oh yeah you got to take your stick a man for the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth but now your attitude straight your spirit is right by the grace of God if you're truly have a repentant heart because we're repentance comes the right attitude and the right spirit with true repentance God responds to true repentance a man because the Bible says repent and be baptized and as the prophet of God has said he said that's our steps he said that's the first two is ours on the day of Pentecost is three repent be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he said the third is God steps amen but he said it's God responding to your faith but there are those who are who do repent there are those who are baptized in the name but they don't get the Holy Ghost because why God doesn't receive faith it's just religion they're just going through just a form of godliness or you know just the religious forms or whatever yeah that's all but if you're a Christian and you got the Holy Ghost and it's God in you Rick brought you to repentance a man convicted you amen amen you recognize I need to repent goodness Lord I'm sorry Lord I was born this way you forgive me Lord I was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies oh Jesus I'm a sinner and I need you Jesus amen amen you acknowledge you need a savior you a knowledge that you need Jesus amen faith comes by hearing hearing by the Word of God praise the name of the Lord he opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and he said unto them thus it is written and thus they be who Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached amen I mean here repentance not many Oh what we're in this now so we just preached the resurrection rapture yeah but you need to remind them of repentance a man so that they're gonna make their calling lecture Shore and they're gonna get get more and more into the spirit of the Resurrection the spear the rapture but it takes for the spear of repentance to bring you into it oh yeah home with yourself so nice and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations and your witnesses of these things amen praise the Lord so brother there's there's not many churches and not many men preachers today that are bridging repentance or having a repentant attitude a repenting spirit and so on you know all in your relationship with the Lord anybody and you got that then brother you're gonna reflect Christ to family friends and neighbors by the grace of God so he said I earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and they got away from it now he said man a corrupt mind and so forth had come in and beguiled them away from the real things of God brother if you're repented and you've been born again you got a totally different attitude different spirit or you were like this you were like that but now you're like him you're like Jesus you got Jesus attitude Jesus spirit Jesus actions Jesus reactions yeah oh and in the eyes of the again and they're in many cases in the eyes of family not all of them friends and neighbors you're a fanatic you're just a fanatic now not always call you that but some well yeah I know like my family it's not doesn't call me a fanatic but they know that I different they know that my self sister Betty is different when it comes to our faith and what we believe in and so on and and I remember one time we're in a family gathering and one of the it was a nephew of mine then and they were bringing up this and there and and I think the mother was afraid that it might go a little too far she said that's enough now she said my son sheesh you leave those things she said and and and move on and so on so he changed this conversation oh yeah because that's the way they're taught that's the way they're is shown to them that don't hold anything against Gerald or Betty because of what they believe oh no and they would invite us if they got together for somebody's birthday or or for a child or whatever they would invite myself and sister Bay that's right and another time they called me said Oh Gerald she said that we're getting together student and it was for a certain birthday and I said yes and they said oh we were planning to do this did you have anything against that would that be anything contrary to your faith or your religion that's amazing that they would call and ask me those things before we got there oh yeah when they're making the plans because they said we wouldn't want to do that they said you know and I said well I appreciate that but I bet it was nothing against me there and so on so I I said thank you lord thank you listen if you your spirit is right your attitudes right god oh god oh god I'll make that right with you oh yeah you'll give them that right spirit towards your faith oh you will but if not boy it'll be different so brothers see but true repentance will bring that right attitude and right spirit hey man if you really got a repentant attitude and a repented spirit and brother is not it doesn't all I repented for as he had gone know that that spirit of repentance is always with you why because we're in this body of flesh amen Lord I'm constantly dealing with these spirits in in this flesh I costly dealing with the the senses of this whole body a man and remembers the Prophet said this is the devil's watchtower up here and he said living by the five senses of your flesh but he said God's watchtower he said it's in your soul and you're going by faith alone amen you're not going by your failings are going by your faith a man and he said when the devil comes you know up here and he said he's getting into your feelings in your senses he said the Holy Ghost comes out into your spirit easy to drive the devil back a man oh brother why because you got a spirit of repentance God knows that you're constantly sorry for your sins God knows your regrets in you don't want to be part you don't want to be a sinner you want to be a saint amen so he's constantly there reminding us repent by the grace of God it brings us down to humility humble thyself and he said God can only operate us when we let him operate a man sister that's right God can only operate us will mean hilarium and there's many times that we don't let God control us in this we one day God do this we want to God give us a is attitude in this spirit in this or in this or in that oh yeah oh we go we just live did the carnal nature of the flesh know that's why you got to walk in the spirit and live in the spirit a man a man a man by the grace of God because the Spirit will keep you in line with the word amen and with with the attitude of Christ with the nature of Christ by the grace of God and what is it you're going whatever God wants to do you let him do it you let him do it oh it's contrary to the mind it's country to your senses yeah but it's not country to your heart yeah god help us because I see a lot of so-called believers or so-called Christians and I said Lord I said they won't let you I said controlling to control them they won't let you control their attitude or their spirit listen brother sister you need the power and anointing of the Holy Ghost more and more on the joy than you ever did especially in these last days and man why because brother you're born with this whole nature and the devil is using it constantly amen oh yes brother I tell you this and as I see believers someday no I said Lord I said they need the Holy Ghost they need to surrender to the Holy Ghost why because I see I'm bringing out their own their own natural nature of morden spiritual nature they got more of the spirit of mom and dad and the sinful births and everything else than they do of the nuber yeah that's the truth that is the truth so brother re true Holy Ghost repentance will bring you into a born-again experience so you're a new creature in Christ and now you're living by the nature of the Holy Ghost the nature of God a man and the devil is playing that nature oh yeah the devil is fighting that nature with the Richard which are an old nature he wants you to give premise for the old nature he'd like you to give premise to this your feelings and your ideas and your thoughts intellect oh yeah brother get wisdom but get understanding yeah brother I mean he's media Holy Ghost wisdom to the homes in control of your life who's in control of your spirit who's in control of your your nature a man but let God control from the heart don't let the devil control from this no or your feeling not by any means and that's that is that is the battle and we're fighting constantly amen oh yeah so brother I trusted that God is getting the victory in you the victory in made by the power of the money of the Holy Ghost what is it were and again repent be baptized but again do it by faith out of your heart and then God give you the Holy Ghost a man and person can go and repent be baptized but it's not no faith there it's just religious knowledge and whatever and they're just religious people but Satan got more control than God but if you did it if you repented by the Holy Ghost amen and you humble yourself and you will know got baptized you really enter what is it you're getting more and more and more into oneness with Jesus and you're giving Jesus more and more control until you went out you repented oh yeah lord I need to die with you you lay down your life for me I'm gonna lay down my life for you amen and then he'll give you that you share with you the the life of his blood that he laid down and he picked it up again amen you sure that we do a man and why so that you're going to give him control does he control what you are doing what you are thinking how you're acting and reacting does he control you to the extent that no matter where you are they know you're a Christian you're different now god help us so he said God could only operate us as we let him operate that's the truth yeah and you see believers Oh Lord they're not born again they're still going by their own nature yeah they're yeah what the old nature is there yes but to show they're not born again if the old nature got more controlled and then the Holy Ghost serious Strait is the gate and narrow is the way and few there be that find it so make sure your connect your calling and your election sure amen you better make sure that you repented you better make sure that you humble yourself acknowledging Lord I'm a sinner and I need salvation I need what you would you purchase help me Jesus amen and the Lord I tell you lord I need to die to myself oh my again see he laid down his life for you now you're gonna lay down your life for him so you're gonna live not according to the old nature but a new nature you're born again hallelujah amen the devil is working on the old one but God's working on the new and the more you give to him the more the great the stronger you become the more powerful you become you're gonna you're gonna let you're gonna lay down lay down lay down more and more air Lord I want you to take control Lord's not what I want what you want everybody by the grace of God people don't realize that they think it's just religious they think it's just spiritual they're always just well Lord yeah I believe this I believe that I believe that no it's your entire life it's your entire life amen so brother he can only do it if you let him but you gotta bypass this your mind stop it amen let's see again people don't understand we do mean your heart yeah you can't think him there can you oh yes definitely I'm a new creature in here I'll tell you the right the right understanding and wisdom revelation is not up here it's in here it's in the heart by the grace of God amen oh yeah I think I think here the devil is using this God is using this on the inside of the inside oh it's a mystery but again it's something I've experienced and I know it's real by grace he said if you want power Ecco humble you can get he should just get away from all worldly thinking and humble yourself before God get away from worldly thinking if you need a brother plead the token life of the blood of Jesus anybody the Holy Ghost when you go to work you need to plead it a man why because we're where you work more more more than they're caught up with worldly thinking but you got to go in there with the anointing of the Holy Ghost so your Holy Ghost thinking your thoughts are spiritual there's there's is just carnal some might be religious but yours is spiritual by the grace of God amen and he said you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a lot of noise because you have been able to conquer yourself amen not me that leaves this Christ that liveth in me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and he said you have conquered yourself and he said commit yourself to Christ and he said to humble yourself before him he said that's really power humble yourself before you Lord without you I'm nothing without you I'm nobody that's you Lord I am dead yeah and mercy on me Lord a man listen Lord brother sister God loves you Jesus loves you the prophecy humble yourself and love him but I gotta be honest most people are not not loving Jesus they're not in love with Jesus no he's just a picture he's just a historical figure he's just somebody brother Ben preached about no if he I'll tell you this if you're born again it's someone you got a relationship with a man and it's a relationship that's closer than the relationship you got with any human being it is he got preeminence it's not this person that person you got to get it for you to have a relationship right relationship with them you got ever better gotta have a relationship with Jesus it's a commission after Christ you see to humble yourself before him that's really power he said you show me a church that's humble show me a church that's real humble not arrogancy a church just a sweet humble church and I'll show you a church that has the favour and the power of God in it amen do we have a sweet church amen do we have a humble humble church amen and he said that's the thing it takes he said humility humbling ourselves before God and letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise he said sometimes the father said he went out into the field with his wagon and every time he hit a bump it just rattled and went on and he said when they come back it hit the same for the same bump and he said big but now he said when they come back he said it was loaded amen he said above all things it's our individual souls that were responsible for before God and he said it's you going to heaven it isn't whether I go or he goes it's you going and you first and you've got to look this out and come sweet before the Lord oh brother a sweet spiritual attitude how many are in love with him how many love him because listen if you're in love with him you're in love with one another yeah you love him you love one another oh yes there finally yeah just think that that's the serious that is serious don't take it as a religious feeling no it's a faith by the grace of God and he said listen I've always found out that the man that humbles himself is the man that God exalts and he said when you take a person with his chest out and knows everything and you can't tell him nothing he is arrogant and well he said that's the person that never gets anywhere but you take that person that's unbolts himself and walks how amazing you don't walk with your head oh no you got trade down because I know nothing without him he said but that person that humbles himself he said they walk he said sweetly they have a sweet attitude and a sweet spirit sweet motives and sweet objectives and so on yeah I gave you this quote my brother there's a lot more of that message now love one another see as he was getting very near the end of his ministry he was seeing less and less of divine law oh yeah more more religious people but less baptized with the Holy Ghost he said love one another above everything he said no matter what the devil tries to say he says you're all one big sweet group now but remember my warning Satan won't let you stay that way and he said that sometimes God will let the devil in he said to do this do this what for he said to manifest your spirit and he said to see if you're going to take sides yeah basic that's the world that's the spear of the world yeah and he said he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison and he'll starts through the church with it but he said don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right lobbying and sweet and kind to one another and pray for that man or that woman and he said or ever would is just pray for them and stick with one another amen brother see that's though if you're in the body part of the body brother we're here to judge the world but be careful when you judge one another because the way you see them the way God sees you amen praise the Lord brother it's to humbleness oh yeah God does it to humblest like I said I've fought those spirits for over 50 years and I preached against that keep your attitude right keep your spirit right a man by the grace of God oh yeah we're here to be a witness of the word the witness of the truth but we're not Earley we're not here to condemn the people know as like I said the angel rebuked the prophet and told not not to do that don't call him Rickey's don't call him Rick hey Rick at us he says some of them are my children amazing yeah and that's like he said to about the woman who Barry said this dress this way dress that way he said we can't condemn her he said we can condemn what she's doing but he said not don't condemn her no grace of God brother Jesus could condemn us yeah in life that woman is out there that look worried born in sin these these these sinful bodies oh yeah born and seeing them yeah what thank God for Jesus so they why today God looks at us through the blood that Jesus shed hey man if he didn't he see he see nothing but sinners but he sees saints a man according to your faith hey man does he see a saint or a sinner this all depends on your faith a man and he said said find a man to be a shepherd that has no reputation in all denomination and that's just a real good genuine sweet humble brother that live lives the life and now he said not some big know-it-all coming in put this in order and he said this has to be this way and cutting these things he said it I said it'll never work he said every piece in the church must work together and you must keep up your heart you're part of it amen sure by the grace of God keep your part of it and he says see what the time we're living in he said we may be closer than we think we are to the end see the main thing is love God armor yourself with it love God you know how many is loving Jesus how many really love the Lord Jesus Christ there's not many that got the experience of love grace said surely after all these years of the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know it a little a bit about the gate to enter in that and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you a man stay humble a man don't look don't be looking down on everybody look up humble yourself and look up amen God blessed my brother God blessed my sister amen praise the name of the Lord praise the Lord and for the strong to support the weak they got a humble themselves oh yeah you got to get down amen brother Brown would do that if he met people and he was talking to them he would get down on their level yeah and he said to really pray for them and deported they were going to be healed he said I have get in their shoes oh yeah and his in his heart you get it he get in their shoes why he said he said there goes my mother there look my father there goes my brother my sister yeah he identified with them and why his heart was in it and that's why again that's what saving Jesus did and Jesus in William Branham did the same thing Jesus in you will do the same thing you'll be in their shoes praise the Lord identifying with them hey man he says so he said after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in and if you want to get someone with God he's a never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you don't let no malice come in no matter he sure what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person you see that what God seeing you yeah yeah the easiest thing for us to do is see see somebody else's mistakes but it's like I like our brother Perry green I'll never forget it and I got a summer on a cassette tape years ago when he was preaching and he was talking about who crucified my Lord and then he sung that song and he said I went by the mirror I looked in the mirror and I saw the man that crucified my Lord Amen so every time you go by a mirror look in you wanna know who crucified Jesus you a man he lay down his life for us a man he laid down his life for for his for his sons and daughters he laid down his life for his bride praise the name of the Lord oh yeah people wonder all they could they condemned the Jews for killing Jesus they could they condemn they know the Romans for killing Jesus did this did that no he did that for us for me for you yeah and brother when it comes to when he on the cross he said Father forgive them for they know not what they do brother I believe he was not only referring to just the ones down below the cross he was referring to all the seed of God a man though because brother why because it was frosty he was doing what he did for us he was experiencing what they experiencing brother it was for us that they did what they did to Jesus yeah because he had why because he was the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world slain amen what for for your sin and mine to redeem you to redeem me he voluntarily did it that was his love for you and me because he he knew we were we had fallen amen because of what happened in Eden amen and he knew their sons and daughters of God he knew that we want to be back and he laid down his life voluntarily to bring us back the prophet of God said he could he could have what he could have started all over again he could have destroyed Adam he could have destroyed either destroyed it all and did it start fresh no but he did what he didn't allowed what he allowed amen again it was God's plan purpose and patterned a man and what'd he do that for because he wanted to reveal himself he wanted to reveal his love to us so that we would love him not because we add - no no he would bring out our love for him because of his character and to know him is to love him you love him because of his character you love him because of what he did he did and so on Lord you do I know you didn't have to do it you didn't have to do it Lord but you did it because you love me if there's any genuine loss is the love of God human love is here and today and gone tomorrow but divine love is eternal oh yeah and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the baptism of divine love what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost divine love yeah you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it says God is love so if God is love the Holy Ghost is love s God in us so you got that's the evidence Anthony got the evidence of the Holy Ghost how many are manifesting the evidence of the Holy Ghost don't go say I got the Holy Ghost oh good no let them say it amen let them see it praise the Lord later oh that you're going to reflect my love of God's just you're just what it's your shoes just your nature now out of your soul you know I'm living by the nature of the flesh no more controlled by that or you're living by the nature of the soul controlled by that and a man and it's fighting the nature of your flesh oh yeah you're in a battle that's the battle but he promised to be with us he promised to help us he promised encourages everybody and when the enemy is there pushing this on us pushing that honest when it comes to our first Oh then the Holy Ghost is there it's written now it's written my son thus saith the Lord to give you victory brother that's how they Jesus overcome the devil it is written Satan in his temptation not only that when the devil was influencing Peter and like I said just think oh my brother George Smith brought it out you know look look oh god chooses hey man no God uses all my ears Paul the one that killed Christians yeah he had kids Christian after Christian after Christian killed and he was on his way to kill more when God dealt with him and he was the he was the messenger of the first church age hey man and here was Peter and Jesus had more more to deal with Peter questions that Peter would ask and the doubt that Peter had on the unbelief that Peter had and he said the deal without a finding you know when Peter said this Peter said that he tried to stop this try to stop that and Jesus said get thee behind me Satan for those savers not the things of me of God he knew the anointing that was that was on Peter not 'enum on him amen brothers sometimes we got that anointing you experienced that anointing a man saying you gotta get me I'd be Satan amen and you and you need that revelation to get power over the enemy it is written Satan it is written it is written brother as Jesus said it is written but after the day of Pentecost Peter was saying it is written a man could now Christ within Peter and the same defense that Jesus use now Peter was using the same defense Jesus used now you and I going to use it is written the word praise the Lord amen so a solution if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you no not by any means Lord I'm a sinner saved by grace thank you Jesus and brother he's there to use you yeah because you humble yourself he can use you praise the Lord he said don't let no malice come in no matter you sir what anybody do anybody does if they're wrong don't you never build up a complex to against that person no way no way but I've witnessed that for years believers would get a complex against this one a complex against that one against that yo yeah just love them and go on thank God for the that Jesus love you amen hey man are you gonna condemn you he was righteous we were on righteous a man but he didn't come to condemn has he come to redeem us and to encourage us hey amen so we're there to encourage one another amen to strengthen well like I said the Bible does acknowledge the weak praise the Lord one derful amen thank God for Redemption he acknowledges the weak and he said let the strong support the weak praise the Lord well we think everybody gotta be like me everybody got me like this one every gotta be guy on this level no no no look at that brother look at that sister down here maybe and then Jesus said there there the weak ones ways to let the strong support the weak you're there to encourage them and pray for them amen Oh glory he said don't you never build up a complex against that person you be sweet and kind wonderful remember God loved you when you were in sin and if the Spirit of God is in you you love the other person when E is wrong and he should just pray for them and love one another hallelujah Alleluia you're not there to condemn listen if the spirit of the Redeemers in you you're there to redeem you're there to bring them back is there to encourage them and lift them up amen praise the Lord above everything love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless it and it's hard telling what he will do a man and usually when a church begins to get in numbers and get to getting a little bigger or something like that then they get away from that real real thing amen they do but the smaller we are the better we are amen why cuz God can deal with us in a very personal way a man by His grace well sorry didn't think I'd be this locked but it seemed like only a few minutes but brother what is repentance it is to change one's mind for the better a man it is to turn from one sins to God he said putting more and more emphasis on the Lord on God repentance like I said you were going that way would you turn around amen your thoughts are changed your motives and objectives have changed everything has changed because going that way it was natural going this way it's spiritual going this way was it was just in time but this way is eternal oh where you where are you going what do you think you go from well this way oh I was born over there no where were you come from well I was born in eternity I'm born again I'm a new creature now and and God is my father that the prophet of God said that means you're God because God's he said give birth to God's yeah it's the sons and daughters of God they're God's old God help us amen brother let's not just not ignore the revelation of who we are repentance brings us back to God a man we're going that way away from God repentance turns us around to bring us back to God and back to the word back to eternity to bring us back home amen brother brother boys resume is not India brother Joshua your home is not Africa no not by any means a man no we didn't come from here come there and it's not the United States where some of our sisters come from not by any means not Canada not new for the land a man our home is in glory we come from eternity oh so good yes that's why that's where we that our brother come here and was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's amazing that he would come all the way from new from India and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ here in Newfoundland amen all right as like I said some of you brothers and sisters from America from Africa oh yeah and we like I said through our home page we administer to over 62 countries with booklets and pamphlets and tracks and and Bibles and so on it's absolutely amazing yeah I trust that we're known in glory as much as we're known in around the world because we thinking that we can be known around the world not knowing in heaven the important thing is to be known in glory and to end in heaven by the grace of God sure to give God the glory amen just sing why is our brother Virgil here wise brother Joshua here what hey even our sister court Ella here a man brother it's boy because we're not in time where he's Ernie you're representing not you're not representing India you're not representing Africa or this country or that country no you're representing heaven amen we're representing our Lord Jesus Christ now a man by the way I preached on him being an ambassador yeah what if what does an ambassador do he basa der for Canada out there over in this country in that country and he's representing Canada or an ambassador for United States representing United States and he's gonna he's gonna have to act like it talk like it and express their their their their motives objectives and feelings and so on yeah or ambassadors for Jesus for heaven for eternity and brother so you glue as an ambassador for heaven ambassador for the kingdom of God so brother you're gonna glue and reflect Oh what is it it's the word you go out and reflect the word yeah what is written here in the Word of God by the grace of God amen and brother to come to that place you have to repent let go of the pass and receive the new that God wants to give you the new life the new nature what is it now you're born again now so what do you got that nature and it's the nature of God it's the nature of the kingdom of God is the nature of eternity not this world god help us we're not living for this world Roger there's too many so-called believers all they're living for it's just they're still living for this world boy they say they read the message but like the prophet of God said you got it in your head but you don't have it in your heart and he brings that out again in this message on Christ as the mystery of God revealed god help us grace brother brother to repent danger mine acknowledging your need of a savior and submitting to his thoughts his words his deeds submitting to his leadership amen God's ultimate purpose purpose in saving us is to obtain the lordship of our lives for the saving of our souls and the changing of our bodies grace praise the Lord repentance brings us into that relationship as I was talking to even a brother a Pentecostal brother and I said brother I said I said many and most I said Christians they want Jesus as their Savior but I said they don't want him as their Lord but I said he is our Lord and our Savior he's got to be the lord of your life to be the Savior relation a man but most just want always my Savior Jesus my Savior but he's not their Lord you could tell that by the life they live on their attitude their spirit and what they do and so on no no they're doing what they want to do but not what God wants them to do no no they don't they don't think they got to be spiritual like that no but you do and I say there's a lot making carnal decisions based on the flesh they got their reasoning oh yeah the reasoning in their mind and their thoughts oh yeah I need this I need this yeah this is best this is best yeah well what's best in the eyes of God and what's best in the eyes are gone it's not necessarily best in the eyes of man God will do this not today there's a lot would disagree with God they would oh Lord I don't want to do this oh Lord I don't want to do that Oh Lord if you do that well my lord yeah oh yeah make your decision based on the Lord's revelation is word his spirit is just consider the word Oh what did he did for Abraham what did he do for Noah and what did he do for Moses will we let God govern our lives like that well we let God do to us what he did to others here in the Bible most wouldn't listen if God's not in control naturally he's not in control spiritually you need we need a repent of those attitudes and those spirits so brother God's ultimate purpose bringing us to repentance to Humble us and to what to obtain the lordship of our lives for the saving of our souls and the changing of our bodies and he accomplishes this through the preaching of the word penetrating and breaking down if we allow him he will penetrate and he will break down the wall of self-will which endures is moving fully in our lives we got things we want to do but God got things he wants you to do a man self will prevents the believer from going beyond non saving faith into the realm of saving faith where Christ reigns as the Lord of our lives so brother self will prevents God from taking control amen brother brother get let the Holy Ghost take away self will hey man are our subjection to it are our sense being sensitive to self will a man to the will not my will time be done hey man praise the Lord hallelujah brother if you got to make a decision talk to the Lord about it and don't make NIT water there or he was just Church or something no no it's everyday living Lord what if what would you have me to do what is your what is your will what is your leadership Lord Amen Lord not my will find be done it's amazing that that's the example that Jesus set for you and me oh jesus said this jesus said yeah but I said he went from self will to the will of God and brother if we got the Holy Ghost the life of Christ in us we got the same attitude the same spirit a man so we want to get rid of self-will because brother it'll hinder the saving faith where Christ reigns as the Lord of our lives amen no no we still want we still want to be the Lord of our lives oh I'm gonna be the Lord of my life I'm gonna make this decision I'm gonna make that no he's already made it so he brother it's the predestinated will of God for your life oh just save me Lord save you do you know what it means to be saved Oh Lord are you you're gonna say you saved me you did this you did that years but he said I want to do I want to do it in you yeah I lay down my life no I want to get in you and you lay down your life yeah hey man so so what so he's gonna he's gonna use you what for for the will of God amen I'm gonna manifest myself in you now I'm gonna control you now praise the name of the Lord most don't believe that they feel that God don't want that control oh yeah you got to have it all if you want to go to glory you want to get into heaven and you want to do this you want to do that brother well you got to have cool control hey man jesus knew that he had to totally subject and submit himself to to the promise of God to the word what for for our Redemption oh yeah he could have went on back he could have look he said I could call and ask the Father for twelve legions of angels to destroy the world set him free he could have done that over again but no for you he stayed there for me he stayed there amen brother so that he would come back to get rid of self-will and not my will but the will of God to be done and once self-will is conquered the word brings conviction and conviction leads to repentance and repentance will take us further into justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our souls and Christ is enthroned as our Lord of lords and King of Kings a man so I pray God that he is the lord of your life and he is the king of kings in your heart by grace amen so that it's absolutely God in control amen you're not in control you're not doing what you want to do you're doing what your what God wants to do amen and really you have submitted yourself to him and to his leadership amen you've submitted yourself to his anointing by the grace of God amen will read one scripture we'll bring it to a conclusion for this service second Timothy chapter two a man second Timothy chapter two and there's other scriptures that will get maybe the Lord willing on Wednesday concerning repentance praise the Lord second Timothy chapter two and verse 24 and the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men amazing be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if God peradventure will give them repentance a repentant heart a repentant attitude so I said the repentance you start with repentance but that spirit is still there because when if we sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and if we send Lord forgive me Lord forgive me Lord forgive me amen wrong thought wrong word wrong not just deeds or he did this he did this he did this yeah but sometimes it's your thought yeah amen so nice there's something you might say I just doo doo doo we could never everybody for doing this doing that but God looking down a sees your thoughts and sometimes your love your thought will speak louder than your words in God yeah in glory so brother you got to be in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves and if God

themselves amen out of the snare of the devil we are taken captive by who are those who are taken captive by him at his will a man but brother the spirit of repentance gives us the victory over the
