[19:38] here from her
[19:40] and
[19:41] [Music]
[19:42] she you know she requested prayer
[19:44] because she believes in prayer and she
[19:46] believes the saints will pray
[19:48] for herself she's having surgery on june
[19:50] 1st so we don't remember her that's in
[19:52] corner brook that's happening

[20:04] son-in-law dave rowe who's still

[20:12] respiratory ailment

[20:15] she said he still has to cough and it's
[20:18] like daily it's constant and he doesn't
[20:19] get any sleep
[20:21] so
[20:22] the only time he gets relief is when the
[20:24] chemo doctor gives him some medicine
[20:27] to
[20:28] to ease it for him so anyway so she's
[20:30] asked for prayer for him
[20:33] and of course we remember the salvation
[20:35] of his soul as well brother doug
[20:38] just a touch from the lord for him
[20:40] and
[20:41] also for the little boy jack who's two
[20:43] years old
[20:43] [Music]
[20:45] she explained to me
[20:47] that his problem is uh is that he he's
[20:50] two years old he can't he can't walk
[20:53] and he can stand up he's progressed to
[20:56] being able to stand up and to take a a
[20:58] step or two but that's it
[21:00] and then what happens is that
[21:03] if he gets a cold or a flu it affects
[21:05] him in such a way that his legs stop
[21:07] working at all he can't stand he gets
[21:09] around by crawling on his arms
[21:12] so

[1:05:39] dealing with believers and those of like
[1:05:41] precious fate there's no little
[1:05:44] uneasiness and you got to work the
[1:05:45] little quirks out we're just brothers
[1:05:47] and sisters and you know we may sound a
[1:05:49] little bit different brother by shell

[1:05:54] versus his indian accent so i'll be glad
[1:05:56] to trade places with you but i don't
[1:05:58] know how that'll work for me in the
[1:05:59] south but hey we'll figure that one out
[1:06:03] but uh you know i understand i have a
[1:06:05] little bit of a southern drawl so if
[1:06:07] y'all want to talk to me after service

[1:06:15] want to say sister gail we do have this
[1:06:18] here we will keep this handy as we
[1:06:20] preach the word tonight and as we end it
[1:06:22] we'll have prayer over these needs i
[1:06:24] believe we've already had prayer but we
[1:06:25] will have prayer once again
[1:06:27] um
[1:06:28] and i want to speak to you tonight we're
[1:06:29] going to pick back up where we left off
[1:06:30] yesterday evening
[1:06:32] we spoke on god does impossible math and
[1:06:35] we also kind of gave it a subtitle of
[1:06:37] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:06:39] and tonight i want to take that a step
[1:06:41] further not even cancer
[1:06:43] and we're going to go back we're going
[1:06:44] to pick up faith one more time as we
[1:06:46] drop down and there again i don't have
[1:06:48] any clocks working tonight y'all said
[1:06:50] hey just take your liberty i'm not prone
[1:06:52] for preaching more than four hours so
[1:06:54] you're okay
[1:06:57] that's a joke and y'all got it so great
[1:06:59] brother lush is like you preach as long
[1:07:00] as you want we're going home
[1:07:04] amen if you take your bibles here we're
[1:07:06] going to look in first john 5 and verse
[1:07:07] 13.
[1:07:09] first john 5 and verse 13.
[1:07:13] and these things have i written unto you
[1:07:15] that believe
[1:07:17] they believe on the name of the son of
[1:07:19] god that ye may know that you have
[1:07:22] eternal life and that you may believe on
[1:07:24] the name of the son of god notice now
[1:07:27] god wants you to know and he wants you
[1:07:29] to have faith in the name of the son of
[1:07:31] god and that in that name is where you
[1:07:34] find eternal life and that you may
[1:07:36] believe on the name of the son of god
[1:07:38] and in verse 14 and this is the
[1:07:40] confidence that we have in him that if
[1:07:43] we ask anything according to his will
[1:07:47] he heareth us
[1:07:49] now i know if you're like us down in the
[1:07:51] states there's times that your prayer
[1:07:53] doesn't seem to go above the ceiling
[1:07:55] but the bible says we can have
[1:07:56] confidence that when we ask anything
[1:07:59] according to his will
[1:08:00] he hears us
[1:08:02] he hears your faintest little whisper of
[1:08:05] a prayer god is mindful of it verse 15
[1:08:08] and if we know that he hears us
[1:08:11] whatsoever we ask we know
[1:08:13] that we have our petitions that we
[1:08:15] desired of him you can have your seats
[1:08:18] this evening
[1:08:20] and i'm just going to go ahead and make
[1:08:21] myself comfortable
[1:08:25] we look here in john 15 and verse 7 as
[1:08:27] well it says if you abide in me and my
[1:08:29] words abide in you then ask what you
[1:08:30] will and it shall be done unto you
[1:08:33] herein is my father glorified that you
[1:08:35] may bear fruit so shall you be my
[1:08:37] disciples as a father has loved me so
[1:08:39] have i loved you continue in my love if
[1:08:42] you keep my commandments you shall abide
[1:08:45] in my love even as i have kept my
[1:08:47] father's commandments and abide in his
[1:08:49] love
[1:08:49] these things have i spoken unto you that
[1:08:52] my joy might remain in you and that your
[1:08:55] joy might be full and the message where
[1:08:58] i think pentecost fell brother madam
[1:08:59] will tell us he goes he wants us to ask
[1:09:02] and to believe that our joys would be
[1:09:05] full
[1:09:06] what a mighty god that we serve tonight
[1:09:08] that he wants you to ask of him not only
[1:09:11] for for him to display his character so
[1:09:14] that but for that your joy as a child of
[1:09:17] god as a son of god your joys can be
[1:09:20] made full because you know that your
[1:09:22] prayer is not falling on deaf ears but
[1:09:24] the god that you serve is inclined to
[1:09:26] your prayer he's inclined to your
[1:09:28] whisper excuse me he knows what you have
[1:09:30] need of and the prophet of god said he
[1:09:32] wants you to ask abundantly
[1:09:36] who am i
[1:09:38] he said ask for big things
[1:09:40] don't limit your faith to some little
[1:09:42] mustard seed he says get on out there in
[1:09:45] some kind of faith move on out for big
[1:09:47] things
[1:09:48] that's my kind of god
[1:09:50] he's saying look don't put parameters on
[1:09:52] me don't don't put me in a little box
[1:09:54] don't don't limit what i can do i want
[1:09:56] you to ask for big things let me tell
[1:09:58] you how many you got a need tonight i
[1:10:01] know a god that can meet that need let
[1:10:03] me put it like this i know a god who
[1:10:05] will meet that need if you come with the
[1:10:07] right kind of faith tonight appropriated
[1:10:10] taking god in his word having confidence
[1:10:12] in what he said that he will do if you
[1:10:14] ask anything in my name i'll grant your
[1:10:17] prayer
[1:10:19] and we're going to work this thing all
[1:10:20] the way through in here tonight because
[1:10:21] we want to make sure we have a balance
[1:10:23] right
[1:10:24] see big things is just as easy to
[1:10:27] receive as little things
[1:10:30] big things
[1:10:32] now we're dealing with not even cancer i
[1:10:34] would assume cancer print a really big
[1:10:36] thing
[1:10:37] maybe here in newfoundland y'all got a
[1:10:38] cure to cancer we don't in louisiana
[1:10:41] cancer is a big thing
[1:10:42] but i got a big god
[1:10:45] and i got big faith in a big god to no
[1:10:47] matter what i face he's able
[1:10:49] he's able tonight to meet your need he's
[1:10:52] able tonight to meet your need he's a
[1:10:54] god who's never been defeated he's never
[1:10:57] lost a battle the problem of god said
[1:10:59] look he goes i've never seen god go into
[1:11:02] a battle but when he didn't come out
[1:11:03] packing the victory god sent somebody to
[1:11:06] newfoundland this weekend for what to
[1:11:08] come out packing the victory he's got
[1:11:10] sons and daughters here tonight they're
[1:11:11] going to leave service tonight packing
[1:11:13] the victory
[1:11:15] why because your faith is being elevated
[1:11:17] not in a man but in the son of man here
[1:11:20] he is again in flesh proclaiming the
[1:11:23] same word the same gospel the same
[1:11:25] healing power the same deliverance the
[1:11:27] same holy ghost he's the same in every
[1:11:30] detail except the corporal body
[1:11:33] that's the god that we serve let me just
[1:11:35] say it like this sir we are seeing jesus
[1:11:38] not that we want to sin we are seeing
[1:11:40] the manifestation we are seeing the
[1:11:42] supernatural we are seeing the display
[1:11:45] of the son of man we are seeing god made
[1:11:47] flesh
[1:11:47] [Music]
[1:11:50] then it was a one-man ministry now it's
[1:11:52] a body ministry
[1:11:54] same sign same wonder same everything
[1:11:57] only thing that's different is the
[1:11:58] corporal body
[1:12:00] notice of what he says now
[1:12:02] but
[1:12:03] things is just big things is just as
[1:12:05] easy to receive as little things
[1:12:08] you just have to believe that's all
[1:12:11] well that makes it pretty simple doesn't
[1:12:13] it
[1:12:14] but sometimes believing is not easy
[1:12:17] he says he goes and you got faith you
[1:12:20] just got to know exactly how to use it
[1:12:22] and it'll be all right
[1:12:23] you can put it right to work and it'll
[1:12:26] be just fine
[1:12:28] so that's why i spent all of last night
[1:12:30] building a foundation on faith
[1:12:33] and pace myself for this weekend see we
[1:12:36] got faith we understand that through the
[1:12:38] preaching of the world last night that
[1:12:39] each of us here we have faith some of us
[1:12:42] have higher levels of faith
[1:12:45] but nevertheless we have faith and the
[1:12:47] problem of god would say an inspiration
[1:12:50] he goes he goes you ask for a great
[1:12:52] thing god wants us to ask for big things
[1:12:55] my god he don't run out of blessings up
[1:12:57] there you can't ask too much could you
[1:13:00] imagine a little fish about this song
[1:13:02] out in the middle of the ocean's end i
[1:13:04] better not drink of this water because
[1:13:05] it might dry up
[1:13:07] now louisiana we don't have much water
[1:13:09] you guys got a ton of water out there
[1:13:11] could you imagine a little fish oh i
[1:13:13] better drink of this water sparingly it
[1:13:15] may all dry up he says that's just as
[1:13:17] it's unreasonable to think that that
[1:13:19] little fish has to be scared of the
[1:13:21] water dried up much less a son or
[1:13:23] daughter of god believing that we can
[1:13:25] exhaust the inexhaustible fountain
[1:13:27] there's no way that we can ask too much
[1:13:29] from god there's no way but what god
[1:13:31] can't supply your need there's nothing
[1:13:33] that we can run out of god is here and
[1:13:36] he's here in his service tonight
[1:13:38] he's here to meet your need
[1:13:42] he says well that's just unreasonable as
[1:13:44] it would be or is reasonable or it's
[1:13:46] more reasonable to think that god will
[1:13:48] run out of blessings
[1:13:50] see all heaven belongs to you
[1:13:54] a lot of times young people you see your
[1:13:56] mom and dad or you see the deacon we
[1:13:57] think wow they got the life or you see
[1:14:00] the great preacher the well-knowns
[1:14:02] man they got it made
[1:14:04] but all of heaven belongs to you
[1:14:07] not to the man you exalt on a pedestal
[1:14:09] but to you tonight the same blessings
[1:14:11] the same god the same promise the same
[1:14:14] everything belongs to you
[1:14:16] but notice here in matthew 17 and verse
[1:14:19] we'll look here in verse 14 tonight
[1:14:22] when they were come to the multitude
[1:14:24] there came to him a certain man kneeling
[1:14:26] down to him
[1:14:27] saying lord have mercy on my son
[1:14:29] for he is a lunatic and sorrex and of
[1:14:32] times he followed into the fire and
[1:14:34] often to the water and i brought him to
[1:14:36] thy disciples
[1:14:37] and they could not cure him
[1:14:39] then jesus answered and said or jesus
[1:14:41] yeah jesus answered and said oh faithful
[1:14:43] and professed generation how long shall
[1:14:46] i be with you how long shall i suffer
[1:14:48] you bring him hither to me
[1:14:51] and jesus rebuked the devil and he
[1:14:52] departed out of him and the child was
[1:14:54] cured from that very hour then came the
[1:14:56] disciples to jesus apart and they said
[1:14:59] why could not we cast him out
[1:15:02] and jesus said unto them because of your
[1:15:05] unbelief
[1:15:06] these are disciples
[1:15:08] those that walked with him slept in the
[1:15:11] same vicinity as he slept in and
[1:15:14] traveled with him and they sing the
[1:15:15] supernatural and he says because of your
[1:15:18] unbelief for verily i say unto you if
[1:15:20] you have faith as a grain of a mustard
[1:15:23] seed you shall say unto this mountain
[1:15:26] remove hence to your underplace and it
[1:15:28] shall remove and nothing shall be
[1:15:31] impossible unto you
[1:15:33] amen
[1:15:34] sometimes i think we read the stories in
[1:15:36] the bible and that's all we do is just
[1:15:38] read
[1:15:39] well this is just like a newspaper
[1:15:41] article well that's just great no
[1:15:43] there's something hidden in that
[1:15:44] scripture
[1:15:45] there's somebody that he didn't just put
[1:15:47] that there just to fill up pages or
[1:15:50] words on a page but god is telling a
[1:15:52] body if you can have this kind of faith
[1:15:54] and the mustard seed is the smallest
[1:15:56] seed that there is
[1:15:58] the prophet god will tell us now in the
[1:16:00] original he says in the original lexicon
[1:16:02] it says if you should say to this
[1:16:04] mountain be ye lifted up and thrown into
[1:16:07] the sea and not doubt in your heart but
[1:16:09] believe that this is being done you
[1:16:11] shall have what you say i say it's time
[1:16:13] time that the bride of christ starts
[1:16:15] believing what the word says not about
[1:16:17] the world but about you tonight
[1:16:20] let's start believing what it says about
[1:16:22] us there is going to be a bride and she
[1:16:24] is going to take a body change and there
[1:16:26] is a bride and god hears our prayer and
[1:16:28] when she finds herself in affliction we
[1:16:30] know that god will deliver her out of
[1:16:32] all of her afflictions
[1:16:36] but see we sometimes be looking at these
[1:16:38] things and the prophet of god will say
[1:16:39] he goes we're looking for things so
[1:16:41] spontaneous
[1:16:44] okay here's where we settle down just
[1:16:46] for a few minutes he goes you look at
[1:16:48] that mountain see we want that mountain
[1:16:50] to remove just like that but god don't
[1:16:51] operate that way
[1:16:53] all the time
[1:16:54] he can but he doesn't do it all the time
[1:16:58] because it's based on faith
[1:17:00] but he says we're looking for things to
[1:17:02] be so
[1:17:03] spontaneous but see what did he mean he
[1:17:05] says you look at the mountain you say be
[1:17:07] thou lifted up and thrown into the sea
[1:17:09] and then in your heart believe that what
[1:17:11] you have said has taken place maybe just
[1:17:14] one little grain of sand begins to move
[1:17:18] you never see the sand because on the
[1:17:20] back side of the mountain but god sweeps
[1:17:23] down with the wind and picks up one
[1:17:25] grain of sand
[1:17:26] that one grain of sand is an answer to
[1:17:29] prayer because you asked god moved this
[1:17:31] mountain from my life and god sweeps
[1:17:34] down and all of a sudden you don't
[1:17:35] understand why that door that you hold
[1:17:37] that you were asking god opened this
[1:17:39] door for me and that door shut what was
[1:17:41] god doing god was lifting up a grain of
[1:17:43] sand because he has something greater
[1:17:45] for you god knows what he's doing church
[1:17:48] i've been praying that god moved me out
[1:17:50] of the hospital system for three years
[1:17:52] and door after door after door began to
[1:17:54] be shut but what was god doing god was
[1:17:56] honoring my faith he was moving one
[1:17:58] grain after another grain after another
[1:18:01] grain after another grain and finally
[1:18:03] the whole mountain moved and i'm no
[1:18:05] longer there and now i got peace like a
[1:18:07] river until i got joy like a fountain
[1:18:09] why because i waited on god to do the
[1:18:12] work
[1:18:16] but see we want it spontaneous
[1:18:19] see that grain begins to move you might
[1:18:21] not be able to notice it but there's
[1:18:23] something in your heart says it's being
[1:18:25] done that's faith
[1:18:28] you may not see it you may not feel it
[1:18:30] but something's anchored in your heart
[1:18:32] it is being done
[1:18:34] you'll have he says you have what you
[1:18:36] say see that's the faith many of us are
[1:18:40] prayed for at night and the next morning
[1:18:42] say well there's no difference i don't
[1:18:44] feel any difference he says there's
[1:18:47] where we are failing
[1:18:49] notice now
[1:18:50] that doesn't have to show one thing but
[1:18:53] if thou believeth in thy heart that what
[1:18:56] you say is being done you shall have
[1:18:58] what you say that's it see if you
[1:19:01] believe that what you say has already
[1:19:03] taken place and don't have to feel it or
[1:19:06] see it he goes i believe it that's the
[1:19:08] reason that it takes place it's because
[1:19:11] i believe it and that's what we're
[1:19:13] trying to get you to get to this weekend
[1:19:15] is to believe it not based on emotion or
[1:19:17] not based on feeling not based on
[1:19:19] intellect not based on anything but the
[1:19:21] word of god it declares that it's yours
[1:19:24] it's declared that it's for you and this
[1:19:26] doesn't say that it's going to be
[1:19:28] instantaneous but it does say it will be
[1:19:31] done
[1:19:33] mark 11 23 for verily i say unto you
[1:19:36] that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:19:37] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:19:39] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:19:41] his heart but shall believe that those
[1:19:43] things which he saith shall come to pass
[1:19:45] he shall have whatsoever he's saying now
[1:19:49] let's go into mustard seed
[1:19:51] i'm not a
[1:19:52] biologist or a botanist but you know
[1:19:54] what i got a prophet and he was telling
[1:19:56] me what to say so i'm just going to say
[1:19:57] it tonight he said the mustard seed is
[1:19:59] the smallest among all seed
[1:20:02] come on
[1:20:03] if you study the message you know that
[1:20:05] that's right but there isn't nothing
[1:20:07] we'll mix with the mustard seed
[1:20:10] see it's all mustard you can't mix it
[1:20:12] with kale or nothing to make it grow
[1:20:14] it's all mustard if you got that much
[1:20:17] faith all faith not mixed up with
[1:20:19] something else he said ask what you will
[1:20:22] and it will be given unto you he says
[1:20:24] what but it can't be wavering it's got
[1:20:27] to be genuine mustard faith that's what
[1:20:30] i'll tell your faith may be the smallest
[1:20:31] that it could be but as long as it is
[1:20:33] genuine mustard seed faith based on the
[1:20:36] word of god it ain't mixing with man's
[1:20:38] ideas it ain't mixing with psychology it
[1:20:41] ain't mixing with all these other things
[1:20:43] that they're trying to do
[1:20:44] denominationalism it's based on the word
[1:20:46] of god let me tell you you can hold on
[1:20:48] brother you can hold on and god will
[1:20:50] meet that need it may not be tomorrow it
[1:20:53] may not be next week it may be 10 years
[1:20:55] but god is moving because mustard seed
[1:20:58] faith is responding
[1:21:00] that's what god is looking for
[1:21:02] we want it spontaneous but god said just
[1:21:04] have mustard seed faith don't let it mix
[1:21:07] with unbelief
[1:21:09] don't let it mix with anything
[1:21:11] he goes i understand now the angel of
[1:21:13] god sometimes when a blessing is being
[1:21:15] pronounced upon you he may not be able
[1:21:17] to get to you right then
[1:21:19] well this is big ain't it
[1:21:21] the angel of god sometimes when he's
[1:21:24] blessed when a blessing is being
[1:21:26] pronounced upon you he may not be able
[1:21:28] to get to you right then it might not be
[1:21:31] just instant healing but as you believe
[1:21:34] in your faith he says but as you believe
[1:21:37] your faith will make you whole
[1:21:41] your faith
[1:21:43] will make you whole
[1:21:45] i expected when i became the cfo of the
[1:21:47] hospital i mean it was going to be great
[1:21:48] grand and glorious i was going to have a
[1:21:51] career careers
[1:21:52] was i mistaken
[1:21:54] it was a crash course but god was
[1:21:56] refining the gift that was on the inside
[1:21:59] of his servant and i prayed for three
[1:22:01] years get me out of here
[1:22:03] change the situation so i got more work
[1:22:07] i got more work you know we want we want
[1:22:08] to be perfect right
[1:22:10] some of you do somebody's like i ain't
[1:22:12] really worried about it
[1:22:15] but why would peter why would they tell
[1:22:17] us about the trial of your faith
[1:22:19] more precious than gold
[1:22:22] there's things that we got to look at in
[1:22:23] the word and we want it to happen
[1:22:25] overnight but god's like hold up let me
[1:22:27] refine you
[1:22:29] let me cut the let me chip away the
[1:22:31] loose edges or or the sharp edges let me
[1:22:33] buff on you a little bit and smoothing
[1:22:35] you up and make you shine for the world
[1:22:37] to see what god can do in a life
[1:22:40] what god can do in a fallen humanity
[1:22:42] what god can take from the from the
[1:22:43] rubble and lift up and make a son of god
[1:22:46] look i wasn't always a christian i
[1:22:47] wasn't i didn't i wasn't born in a
[1:22:49] christian home i wasn't born in a
[1:22:50] christian family i didn't go to a church
[1:22:52] i got saved when i was 21 years old and
[1:22:54] then tonight i got saved i wanted to
[1:22:56] commit suicide i tried to pull my car
[1:22:58] off in a ditch but a voice came down and
[1:23:00] spoke to me turn your car around i said
[1:23:03] oh whoa then he said again turn your car
[1:23:06] around i turned my car around went back
[1:23:09] home knelt beside the bed i said god if
[1:23:11] you don't do something with this life
[1:23:12] i'm gonna take it i don't even have a
[1:23:14] desire to live but a brother says i can
[1:23:16] testify to you tonight when i woke up
[1:23:18] the next morning everything changed god
[1:23:21] came down because my god had a seed that
[1:23:23] he placed there not anything that i had
[1:23:25] to do with it but god planted it there
[1:23:27] and god was going to get that seed
[1:23:29] whether i was in church or not in church
[1:23:31] god was going to bring me to the truth
[1:23:32] because why because god will always
[1:23:35] produce a predestinated seed it will
[1:23:37] come to progression
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:43] mustard seed faith though it hasn't been
[1:23:45] easy
[1:23:46] life's not easy
[1:23:48] sure it's not easy here
[1:23:50] but it's life
[1:23:52] but we have the promises of god see now
[1:23:55] he goes you might want it just instant
[1:23:57] healing but but as you're a believer
[1:24:00] your faith will make you oh some people
[1:24:02] have spontaneous faith great faith deep
[1:24:04] faith that's a miracle
[1:24:06] some of them have faith about this deep
[1:24:09] and it takes a little while some have
[1:24:11] mustard seed faith very little but just
[1:24:14] stay with it it will bring you out

[1:24:29] today this is miserable you can you sure
[1:24:31] you know what you're doing
[1:24:32] that's our humanity right
[1:24:35] but just stay with it
[1:24:36] stay with it
[1:24:38] stay with what am i telling you stay
[1:24:39] with it
[1:24:40] oh you may not have spontaneous faith to
[1:24:42] bring a miracle on the scene but that
[1:24:44] doesn't matter god can still do it
[1:24:46] but if he doesn't do it he's still he
[1:24:48] he's not god he doesn't stop being god
[1:24:50] because he doesn't meet your need
[1:24:51] according to your desires he's going to
[1:24:53] meet your need according to his desire
[1:24:55] according to his plan and he's just
[1:24:57] taking a seat do you really believe do
[1:24:59] you have the faith that you claim that
[1:25:01] you have

[1:25:31] and then it'll become mountain faith if
[1:25:33] you'll bring it right out until you just
[1:25:35] just stay with it hold on to it it'll
[1:25:37] bring you right straight to the light if
[1:25:39] you'll stay with it

[1:25:49] becomes mountain faith
[1:25:51] not only mountain faith but mountain
[1:25:53] moving faith for whatever things you ask
[1:25:55] in my name i'll get it
[1:25:57] he says you know some people has great
[1:25:59] big faith like that they can be healed
[1:26:01] in a moment
[1:26:04] some have faith that much can be healed
[1:26:06] in a week some have mustard seed faith

[1:26:15] it'll bring you out you just keep
[1:26:18] holding on to that faith it'll bring you
[1:26:21] through
[1:26:23] if it's real mustard seed you know he
[1:26:25] says mustard don't mix with nothing
[1:26:28] he don't care what the other churches
[1:26:30] are doing he don't care what they're
[1:26:32] mandating he ain't looking to man he's
[1:26:34] looking to the word mustard seed faith
[1:26:36] is rightly divine words and god said i
[1:26:38] can have this i don't care what i got to
[1:26:40] go through i don't care how long it's
[1:26:41] going to take i got it it's anchored
[1:26:43] it's genuine it ain't mixing he goes you
[1:26:45] can't mix with kale you can't mix it
[1:26:47] with spinach and so forth but you he
[1:26:49] goes you can't mix mustard with nothing
[1:26:52] it's solid faith though it may be ever
[1:26:55] so small you plant it it becomes the
[1:26:57] biggest of all bushes
[1:26:59] mustard seeds
[1:27:01] some of you does not need to plant your
[1:27:02] faith plant your little mustard seed of
[1:27:04] faith and let it start
[1:27:05] blossoming
[1:27:07] quit expecting god to do it overnight
[1:27:09] say god i'm ready i'm gonna water this
[1:27:12] faith day after day
[1:27:14] after day i'm not gonna dig that seed up
[1:27:17] and say oh how you doing today now i'm
[1:27:18] gonna plant it in faith and i'm gonna
[1:27:20] water it with my praise and i'm gonna
[1:27:21] thank you god and i'm gonna watch it
[1:27:23] grow and watch it grow and watch it grow
[1:27:25] in my family and watch get a hold of my
[1:27:27] children and watch it grow on my job
[1:27:29] watch it grow here watch it grow in my
[1:27:31] church why god watch god add to it here
[1:27:33] and god add to it here see what is it
[1:27:35] mustard seed faith he says when real
[1:27:37] faith takes hold in the heart it's not
[1:27:39] intellectual it's not a reason no more
[1:27:42] it's real it's the spirit of god
[1:27:44] witnessing through you god's word is
[1:27:47] true he goes i stay right with it yes
[1:27:49] sir and that is what brings the results
[1:27:53] that is if that's good enough for a
[1:27:54] prophet it should be good enough for us
[1:27:57] stay with the word until it produces
[1:27:59] what it said it'll do
[1:28:00] you know you think about it brother
[1:28:02] brandon had a stomach issue for years
[1:28:05] years he had a stomach issue and then
[1:28:07] finally toward the end of his ministry
[1:28:09] did he finally get delivered
[1:28:12] all these i think it was what 1965
[1:28:14] before he finally got delivered on the
[1:28:15] wings of a snow white dove
[1:28:17] all his life he prayed for countless
[1:28:19] people watched him be healed watch them
[1:28:21] be delivered and yet he's struggling in
[1:28:23] his own body
[1:28:25] and yet we want instantaneous faith
[1:28:27] sometimes god doesn't move like that but
[1:28:29] god honored his faith he held on and
[1:28:32] believed that god can heal that one
[1:28:34] surely god can heal me if god touched
[1:28:36] that one surely god will touch me and
[1:28:38] here he is a man of god praying night
[1:28:40] after night having discernment and
[1:28:42] spiritual signs and different things
[1:28:44] taking place and pronouncing this one
[1:28:46] healed and this one healed and yet
[1:28:47] sitting there afflicted in his own body
[1:28:50] but he did not stop believing he kept
[1:28:52] trusting god not only for himself but
[1:28:54] for others that he laid hands on god i
[1:28:57] know you called me for this moment god i
[1:28:59] know that i'm an ordained prophet and
[1:29:00] here i am on the scene for this moment
[1:29:02] to do what to call out a pride or call
[1:29:05] out and elect to call out a people for
[1:29:07] your name's sake
[1:29:10] [Music]
[1:29:13] we looked at ephesians 3 we'll look at
[1:29:14] it again tonight it says now unto him
[1:29:16] that is able to do exceeding abundantly
[1:29:18] above all that we can ask or think
[1:29:20] according to the power that worketh
[1:29:22] within us
[1:29:23] notice now this word exceeding
[1:29:25] abundantly means more than is necessary
[1:29:28] hallelujah god can do more than is
[1:29:30] necessary brother mark
[1:29:33] you got way more kids he can do more
[1:29:34] than necessary
[1:29:36] just got to believe
[1:29:38] it's got to believe
[1:29:40] let me tell you god's arm's not short
[1:29:42] that it can't reach down
[1:29:43] and his ear is not deaf or heavy that he
[1:29:46] can't hear the faintest prayer
[1:29:49] gotta meet you we've seen it church i'm
[1:29:51] telling you i'm going to share some
[1:29:52] testimonies toward him but i've seen the
[1:29:54] supernatural move i've seen god display
[1:29:57] himself and manifest since not only in
[1:29:59] my own ministry but in other ministries
[1:30:00] we've seen god you can't tell me there's
[1:30:03] not a god
[1:30:04] you can't tell me that this message is
[1:30:06] not right you can't tell me that god
[1:30:08] doesn't still produce signs and wonders
[1:30:09] you can't tell me that we're not seeing
[1:30:11] the days of christ he's here again
[1:30:14] so this word exceeding abundant means
[1:30:16] supremely much more than all
[1:30:18] extraordinary surprising uncommon more
[1:30:21] imminent more remarkable more excellent
[1:30:23] oh church i want you to know today god
[1:30:26] will do he will exceed your greatest
[1:30:28] expectations whatever you can fathom in
[1:30:30] your mind god can exceed that tonight
[1:30:33] whatever you can come up and speak out
[1:30:34] of your mouth god can do exceeded
[1:30:37] abundantly above all that you can even
[1:30:38] think tonight
[1:30:40] i say light your faith luke to believe
[1:30:42] lord i believe you tonight i believe you
[1:30:44] for my family i believe you for my
[1:30:46] healing i believe you for my children i
[1:30:49] believe you for salvation i believe you
[1:30:51] for the holy ghost god i believe you
[1:30:53] tonight
[1:30:54] i'm letting my faith loose tonight god
[1:30:56] nothing will stand before the believer's
[1:30:58] prayer not even cancer
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:04] god can do more than what is necessary
[1:31:08] i like the more
[1:31:10] you know it's one thing to have this cup
[1:31:12] here
[1:31:13] and it's feel pretty good right
[1:31:15] what if you just keep adding to it
[1:31:17] keep adding to it
[1:31:19] and
[1:31:19] uh-huh
[1:31:22] i'm not god
[1:31:25] i don't want to make a mess but if we
[1:31:26] just keep patting to it and god says
[1:31:28] keep on filling up i can do more than
[1:31:29] that's necessary
[1:31:30] all your knees in the cuff but i'll keep
[1:31:32] filling up till it overflows
[1:31:34] because that's the god that we serve
[1:31:38] now here
[1:31:40] this is what we're going to come to this
[1:31:41] is our our keynote scripture or not
[1:31:44] scripture but quote tonight he said
[1:31:46] there was an angel came down into a room
[1:31:48] and he told me way back back before i
[1:31:50] was born
[1:31:52] there was for
[1:31:53] excuse me before dane to have a gift of
[1:31:55] divine healing and he came and he told
[1:31:58] me in a room one night that god has sent
[1:32:01] a gift and it was the gift of divine
[1:32:03] healing for the people notice who it's
[1:32:05] for
[1:32:06] it wasn't for the prophet
[1:32:08] it wasn't for the ministry
[1:32:10] it was for the people
[1:32:13] the gift of divine healing was for you
[1:32:15] for i is for us the people
[1:32:18] he said it was for the people and he
[1:32:20] goes and if i could get you to believe
[1:32:22] me
[1:32:23] he says believe me now he says and would
[1:32:25] be sincere when i prayed that nothing
[1:32:27] would stand before the prayer
[1:32:30] i said therefore speaking face to face
[1:32:33] with the supernatural being i believe it
[1:32:35] with all my heart and if i can get you
[1:32:37] to believe me with all your heart he
[1:32:40] said that's what moves god and then
[1:32:42] you're healed
[1:32:44] see your faith has saved you you see
[1:32:47] what i mean your faith to believe has
[1:32:49] saved you not what you worked up to a
[1:32:51] thought in your mind but what you really
[1:32:53] know the very evidence of things not
[1:32:56] seen
[1:32:58] see i don't believe this quote is just
[1:33:00] for physical healing
[1:33:01] but i believe god sent a prophet
[1:33:04] and that prophet was to break that word
[1:33:06] out to a people
[1:33:08] a people that was a special class of
[1:33:10] people that was going to believe this
[1:33:11] message and not only was it for healing
[1:33:14] but it's a it's a message or it's a
[1:33:16] quote it's to help us understand how do
[1:33:18] we get things from god
[1:33:20] how do we approach god how do we address
[1:33:23] ourselves as ministry and as believers
[1:33:26] see i don't believe it's just for
[1:33:27] physical healing but i believe it's
[1:33:28] whatsoever things we have need of if we
[1:33:30] can believe it nothing will stand before
[1:33:33] the prayer
[1:33:34] amen
[1:33:35] nothing will stand before the prayer
[1:33:38] see your belief in god's word as it
[1:33:41] pertains to you
[1:33:43] not me as a man because if you don't
[1:33:45] know how to rightly divide the word i
[1:33:47] can be feeding you a bunch of hogwash
[1:33:48] and you're just gumming it down but no
[1:33:50] but as you rightly divide the word as it
[1:33:53] pertains to you god will respond to your
[1:33:56] faith
[1:33:58] that's why we all have to be students of
[1:34:00] the message we have to be students of
[1:34:02] the word so we know what is being
[1:34:03] preached lines up with the prophet of
[1:34:05] god because it's not a prophet's message
[1:34:08] it's god's message that he sent down
[1:34:09] through a prophet
[1:34:11] and it's the message for the people to
[1:34:13] get a body ready for a rapture
[1:34:16] see you got to believe look otherwise we
[1:34:19] find here your belief in god's word as
[1:34:22] it pertains to you is what will move god
[1:34:24] to respond to your need
[1:34:26] amen see your faith pulls god
[1:34:30] to your need think about the woman at
[1:34:32] the well she had not the woman at the
[1:34:33] well but the one with the bloody she her
[1:34:35] faith told her if she could just touch
[1:34:37] to him of his garment
[1:34:39] she was forbidden to come into the city
[1:34:43] because she had a blood issue
[1:34:45] she was not allowed
[1:34:47] but there was something anchored in her
[1:34:49] heart when she heard that he was passing
[1:34:51] by he was coming through the streets let
[1:34:53] me tell you there wasn't enough crowd
[1:34:55] there wasn't enough criticism there
[1:34:57] wasn't enough laws in the land that was
[1:34:58] going to keep her from receiving what
[1:35:00] she had need of something anchored out
[1:35:02] on her face anchored down and she had to
[1:35:04] fight her way through the crowd she had
[1:35:06] to fight her way through the shame she
[1:35:07] had to fight her way through the
[1:35:08] embarrassment but when she got to him
[1:35:11] something left him and came into her
[1:35:13] virtue left him why was it because she
[1:35:16] had faith that if i could just touch him
[1:35:18] not only him but just to him of his
[1:35:20] garment i know i'll be made whole and if
[1:35:23] i can get you to believe that much
[1:35:25] tonight that if you can just touch to
[1:35:26] him of christ's garment tonight you
[1:35:29] could just feel his presence in this
[1:35:30] church then you would get your need man
[1:35:32] you may have to fight your way through a
[1:35:34] little bit of unbelief you may have to
[1:35:36] fight your way through the crowd tonight
[1:35:37] let me tell you church fights your way
[1:35:39] through he's there he's passing by he's
[1:35:41] coming through newborn this weekend what
[1:35:43] to minister to your need
[1:35:45] oh he's asking look your faith in what
[1:35:48] he will do will pull the very virtues
[1:35:50] out of this word and bring you healing
[1:35:52] and bring you deliverance and bring you
[1:35:54] to your knees and you'll see god
[1:35:56] manifest himself
[1:35:59] but you got to believe what the word
[1:36:01] says about you
[1:36:07] i understand
[1:36:09] we don't believe in being selfish do we
[1:36:12] but tonight is a night to be selfish
[1:36:15] i want it for me
[1:36:18] i want it for me
[1:36:19] god if you don't move on anybody
[1:36:22] i want it to me for me god i want to be
[1:36:24] self i want all that you have for me god
[1:36:27] i'll tell you what i want all that you
[1:36:28] got for my neighbor
[1:36:32] but you got to believe that it's for you
[1:36:35] psalms 34 and verse 17.
[1:36:38] i'm just taking my time tonight
[1:36:42] not sure where we're gonna go in the
[1:36:43] morning but we'll figure that out in the
[1:36:44] morning
[1:36:47] psalms 34 and verse 17 the righteous cry
[1:36:51] and the lord heareth
[1:36:53] the righteous cry they cry out to god
[1:36:56] they pray
[1:36:57] and the lord heareth and delivereth them
[1:37:00] out of all their troubles
[1:37:04] see the lord is not unto them that are
[1:37:06] of a broken heart and he saveth such
[1:37:08] that of a contrite spirit see the bible
[1:37:11] says in verse 19 many are the
[1:37:13] afflictions of the righteous
[1:37:15] but the lord delivereth him out of them
[1:37:19] all
[1:37:20] many are the afflictions nowhere does it
[1:37:23] say that there's one thing that you're
[1:37:25] not able to overcome
[1:37:27] it doesn't say that there's one thing
[1:37:29] that's so much bigger than god that
[1:37:31] god's not able to deliver and if you
[1:37:33] fall into that trap you just own your
[1:37:35] own no it says many are the afflictions
[1:37:37] of the righteous i mean you're righteous
[1:37:39] tonight
[1:37:40] then you can have the assurance that god
[1:37:42] will deliver him out of them all
[1:37:45] whatever you're going through man
[1:37:46] whatever the affliction may be today
[1:37:48] you've got a promise that god won't
[1:37:50] leave you there but god will deliver you
[1:37:52] from that position and from that place
[1:37:54] and god will establish you on the word
[1:37:56] of god and your faith will be increased
[1:38:00] now this word affliction here means
[1:38:03] malignant
[1:38:05] unpleasant evil unhappy
[1:38:08] misery
[1:38:09] and i'm sure that many of us
[1:38:11] can attest we've had some very miserable
[1:38:14] days
[1:38:15] lord knows i have
[1:38:17] but it means malignant and that word
[1:38:19] malignant means tending to produce death
[1:38:22] and when we think of malignant we think
[1:38:24] of malignant sea we think of cancer we
[1:38:26] think of a threat to human life we think
[1:38:29] of death yeah
[1:38:31] so
[1:38:32] god said brother madam says in the
[1:38:34] message redemption in completeness he
[1:38:36] says when you get the holy ghost
[1:38:38] you attend to a lot of obstacles
[1:38:41] man you're thinking man i got the holy
[1:38:43] ghost now it's going to be a flowery bit
[1:38:45] of ease no buddy
[1:38:46] all the guns are hell appointed on you
[1:38:50] but he says many are the afflictions of
[1:38:52] the righteous but god delivereth him out
[1:38:55] of them all god brings you right up
[1:38:58] facing with it
[1:38:59] so he can show you his power and
[1:39:02] goodness
[1:39:04] see god brings you right up facing with
[1:39:07] the trial with the affliction with
[1:39:09] whatever you're going through just so he
[1:39:11] can show you
[1:39:13] his power and his goodness
[1:39:16] sometimes we think it's all about us
[1:39:19] come on
[1:39:21] i know you're sub-human here or more
[1:39:23] than human not so but pro so whatever
[1:39:25] the word is
[1:39:26] you know sometimes we think man we are
[1:39:28] just better than anything else in the
[1:39:29] world i used to think that about myself
[1:39:31] i got humble real quick
[1:39:33] you don't have to aim in that no no no
[1:39:36] you don't well unless you talk about
[1:39:37] yourself
[1:39:41] but see we as a believer have a promise
[1:39:43] so no matter whatever we're facing god
[1:39:46] will deliver
[1:39:48] but you got to have faith you got to
[1:39:50] have mustard seed faith to hold on to
[1:39:52] the end amen
[1:39:55] see he'll not let one thing destroy you
[1:39:58] he'll not let one thing no matter what
[1:40:00] the affliction is that you're facing
[1:40:02] whether it be a physical affliction a
[1:40:03] mental affliction a financial affliction
[1:40:06] a spiritual affection god will deliver
[1:40:10] because that's his word
[1:40:12] see god's not obligated to anything but
[1:40:15] his word
[1:40:17] god is obligated god has to respond and
[1:40:19] god has to keep his word in order to be
[1:40:21] god and if he said many are the
[1:40:23] afflictions of the righteous god's not
[1:40:26] going to let the righteous die in their
[1:40:27] affliction he's going to raise him up
[1:40:29] out of it
[1:40:30] because that's god's word we will not be
[1:40:32] overcome by the affliction we will not
[1:40:34] be overcome by the malignancy you say
[1:40:36] well brother joe many people died i mean
[1:40:38] people died with cancer yeah the bible
[1:40:41] says as we read last night in hebrews
[1:40:42] they died in faith they all died in
[1:40:45] faith
[1:40:46] but the thing was they saw the promise
[1:40:49] of god they embraced the promise of god
[1:40:51] my father-in-law had a lung condition in
[1:40:53] his in his life and he fought for every
[1:40:55] breath and every day he would say i'm
[1:40:57] healed by the grace of god i'm healed by
[1:40:59] the grace of god and he would fight for
[1:41:00] breath and fight for breath and fight
[1:41:02] for breath and when he took his last
[1:41:04] breath he wasn't he god the devil didn't
[1:41:06] get the victory over his life no god
[1:41:08] transported him he took him home and
[1:41:10] gave a new set of lungs well he died in
[1:41:13] faith believing that god was still his
[1:41:16] healer and once you recant that god
[1:41:18] didn't do it that's when the devil wins
[1:41:20] but the devil never wins with a real son
[1:41:22] and daughter of god because they're
[1:41:24] believing to the end if it means you
[1:41:26] take your last breath here your last
[1:41:28] breath here is your first breath in
[1:41:30] eternity brother sister let me tell you
[1:41:32] talking about a new body you talking
[1:41:34] about a healing you talking about a
[1:41:36] deliverance i'm talking about a
[1:41:37] supernatural explosion you're talking on
[1:41:39] streets made with gold ain't no more
[1:41:42] symptoms ain't no more trout ain't no
[1:41:44] more afflictions in why you've been
[1:41:46] transported to your real body
[1:41:49] you didn't die god didn't lose you that
[1:41:51] affliction didn't overcome you no god
[1:41:53] just change your dwelling place
[1:41:55] [Applause]
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:59] but we got to quit thinking about all of
[1:42:01] it on the cardinals well they died
[1:42:03] no a believer doesn't die
[1:42:05] a christian doesn't die
[1:42:08] no you hold on to that testimony
[1:42:11] god is my savior god is my healer
[1:42:14] he says where in
[1:42:16] first peter 1 and verse 6
[1:42:18] wearing greatly rejoiced though now for
[1:42:20] a season
[1:42:21] if need be you're in the heaviness
[1:42:23] through manifold temptations
[1:42:26] that the trial of your faith
[1:42:28] being much more precious than gold that
[1:42:31] perishes don't be tried with fire might
[1:42:33] be found unto the praise and honor and
[1:42:35] the glory of the appearing of jesus
[1:42:38] christ now the trial of your faith how
[1:42:41] many of you likes trials
[1:42:43] oh about had somebody put their hand up
[1:42:45] i saw them oh no psych
[1:42:49] i know what that is right
[1:42:50] or y'all say yeet here is that how y'all
[1:42:52] do that y'all you got something on there
[1:42:53] man we just move on
[1:42:56] but we find nobody raises their hands
[1:42:58] pick me god for a trial
[1:43:02] but god picks you anyway
[1:43:04] and he brings you up facing with it so
[1:43:06] he can show you his power
[1:43:08] and his goodness to you
[1:43:11] so let's look we're talking about cancer
[1:43:13] tonight so we're going to dive in here
[1:43:14] on cancer and look what the prophet of
[1:43:16] god will say about that because we're
[1:43:17] going to tie all this in nothing will
[1:43:20] stand before your prayer
[1:43:22] not even cancer
[1:43:23] but all hinges on faith
[1:43:25] and that's why i'm preaching to your
[1:43:26] faith
[1:43:27] i don't have another ministry this is
[1:43:29] all i got is faith and i love god with
[1:43:31] all my heart i know what he's done for
[1:43:32] me and i've seen the supernatural and
[1:43:34] i'm here to declare he's a living god
[1:43:36] for your need tonight and if you've got
[1:43:38] a need tonight i'm here to tell you
[1:43:40] gotta meet that need if you come and you
[1:43:42] appropriate the right kind of faith
[1:43:44] he says now a cancer in the natural
[1:43:46] realms would be a scavenger a buzzard
[1:43:49] eats dead things a cancer comes from a
[1:43:51] bruise a bruised cell usually is where
[1:43:54] it comes from the cell is bruised all
[1:43:56] mashed up the cell is backslidden if
[1:43:59] something happens in there that fails to
[1:44:01] get the function of the blood to it
[1:44:02] right he says and through their satan
[1:44:05] the author of death which god is the
[1:44:07] author of life satan the author of death
[1:44:09] puts a demon in there called the devil a
[1:44:11] demon called cancer and cancer is not
[1:44:13] his name medical science just gives it
[1:44:15] that name he said the word cancer comes
[1:44:17] from the word craft and then it means
[1:44:19] with little legs and things and it runs
[1:44:21] out he says and like other diseases
[1:44:23] they're given medical terms he said then
[1:44:26] that little cancer comes in there first
[1:44:28] it's a spirit
[1:44:29] he says then it gets into a backslidden
[1:44:32] cell or a bruise cell and that cell he
[1:44:35] goes he goes a brew cell or a cell
[1:44:37] that's not operating right
[1:44:39] so i want to flip this just for a minute
[1:44:41] that's the natural
[1:44:43] what about the spiritual
[1:44:45] okay so the cancer comes first it comes
[1:44:47] as a spirit or a demon that attaches
[1:44:50] itself to a bruised cell
[1:44:52] see and if we're not careful
[1:44:55] maybe somebody in our church somebody
[1:44:57] here somebody somewhere else can get a
[1:44:58] cancerous spirit
[1:45:01] in their spirit
[1:45:03] see for instance you take a person who
[1:45:04] gets hurt
[1:45:06] somebody says something they get
[1:45:07] offended they get wounded
[1:45:09] satan is going to try to attach
[1:45:11] a spirit
[1:45:13] to that bruise
[1:45:14] to that hurt and then all of a sudden a
[1:45:17] complex grows from that and all of a
[1:45:18] sudden that person begins to pull back
[1:45:20] and all of a sudden that person begins
[1:45:22] to pull away all of a sudden you start
[1:45:23] seeing little commotions that happen in
[1:45:25] the church
[1:45:27] you need a quote don't you i got you one
[1:45:29] don't worry here you go
[1:45:30] he goes now that's what happens in
[1:45:32] church when he gets someone failing to
[1:45:34] operate with the church someone failing
[1:45:37] and pulling off and getting indifferent
[1:45:40] that's a cancer in the church it's a
[1:45:41] devil in that person that's right and
[1:45:43] that causes the whole church to be sick
[1:45:46] he said the best thing to do is have a
[1:45:48] spiritual operation
[1:45:51] now when somebody one of our friends
[1:45:52] gets cancer we don't throw our friend
[1:45:54] aside do we we begin to pray for him so
[1:45:56] when somebody gets cancer in the church
[1:45:58] we don't cast them aside we begin to
[1:46:00] pray god perform a spiritual operation
[1:46:03] take this thing out of their life take
[1:46:05] this thing out of their heart god that's
[1:46:07] a brother that's a sister they're
[1:46:08] wounded and this spirit this this cancer
[1:46:10] spirit has attached itself and now they
[1:46:13] fail to operate in tune with the church
[1:46:16] he says but this little cell backslid
[1:46:18] the cancer come in there for back on the
[1:46:20] natural and the cancer then it lays and
[1:46:22] then the first it's the spirit then in
[1:46:24] the form it forms teeny little cells of
[1:46:26] its own notice
[1:46:28] it begins to take on its own life
[1:46:30] and this little cell becomes first he
[1:46:32] goes i couldn't call the big words for
[1:46:33] it but the first form of life is a
[1:46:35] cancer it's painless
[1:46:37] he said no one knows that it's happening
[1:46:41] take somebody who has cancer they don't
[1:46:42] know that it's happening until those
[1:46:44] little cells become big enough cells to
[1:46:46] where it makes a lump or it makes a mass
[1:46:48] or it does something they don't know
[1:46:50] what's going on
[1:46:52] but all the time it could be months it
[1:46:53] could be years
[1:46:55] over a time frame and yet this spirit
[1:46:58] began or this cancer begins to form its
[1:47:00] own life
[1:47:01] and that same thing happens in the
[1:47:03] spiritual aspect as well
[1:47:05] see a spear can come into that bruised
[1:47:07] cell a little tiny cell begins to form a
[1:47:09] little cell then you find you got a
[1:47:11] complex and that complex begins to look
[1:47:13] at everything wrong with everybody
[1:47:16] begins to look at everything wrong with
[1:47:18] the church begins to look at everything
[1:47:20] wrong with the ministry and all of a
[1:47:22] sudden that little cancer cannot receive
[1:47:25] from the word
[1:47:27] but the first stage is
[1:47:29] it's painless it's just a spirit they
[1:47:31] don't even know that they got it but
[1:47:33] over time it begins to develop and it
[1:47:35] begins to respond and it begins to act
[1:47:38] out and it begins to manifest itself
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:43] now this little cell is born brother
[1:47:45] says this is god's provided way of
[1:47:46] healing he says now this little cell is
[1:47:48] born it must feed so in order to feed it
[1:47:51] has to feed on your bloodstream just
[1:47:54] like you fed on the bloodstream when you
[1:47:55] was in your mother's womb you fed on the
[1:47:58] substance that she ate and so forth and
[1:48:01] so does cancer feed on the substance of
[1:48:03] your body it's one little cell then it
[1:48:05] grows it begins to feed and another cell
[1:48:07] breaks out and another cell breaks out
[1:48:10] and another cell breaks out and after a
[1:48:11] while is cell on cell tumor cataract
[1:48:15] whatever it may be grows bigger bigger
[1:48:16] bigger bigger larger spreading out more
[1:48:19] sales more sales more sales he says in
[1:48:21] the first thing you know it begins to
[1:48:23] zap so much blood till the young lady
[1:48:25] begins to feel sick he says what is it
[1:48:28] it's poison it's death it runs into
[1:48:30] every little fiber of your body that it
[1:48:32] came down into the tissue stretching its
[1:48:34] legs down weeding out like the roots of
[1:48:36] retreat going all around rapping through
[1:48:38] the intestines and up through the spine
[1:48:41] and the doctor comes along and he opens
[1:48:43] them up he says nothing can be done the
[1:48:45] man to the best of his knowledge saying
[1:48:46] everything that he knows see there it is
[1:48:48] he's so the patient back up it's
[1:48:49] finished there's nothing that can be
[1:48:51] done you take the person all apart he
[1:48:53] goes but you couldn't find it anywhere
[1:48:55] couldn't find it all anywhere there it
[1:48:56] is the patient is hopelessly helplessly
[1:49:00] gone as far as a doctor is concerned
[1:49:02] there's nothing more that they can do
[1:49:06] nothing more
[1:49:08] but god said not even cancer
[1:49:11] not even cancer
[1:49:14] the doctors may not be able to get it
[1:49:16] all
[1:49:17] with a great physician
[1:49:20] let him perform the procedure let him
[1:49:22] perform the surgery
[1:49:24] so we find now when he told them if you
[1:49:27] can get the people to believe
[1:49:30] you
[1:49:31] and you be sincere when you pray nothing
[1:49:34] will stand before your prayer
[1:49:37] not even cancer so we find here in first
[1:49:39] corinthians 5 and verse 7 the bible will
[1:49:42] tell us purge out therefore the old
[1:49:44] leaven that you may be a new lump as you
[1:49:46] are unleavened for even christ our
[1:49:49] passover is sacrificed for us therefore
[1:49:52] let us keep the feasts not with the old
[1:49:54] leaven neither with the leaven of malice
[1:49:57] and wickedness but with the unleavened
[1:49:59] bread of sincerity
[1:50:01] and truth amen now notice that word
[1:50:04] purge means to cleanse thoroughly
[1:50:09] cleanse thoroughly if we're gonna keep
[1:50:11] the feasts with the
[1:50:12] with the new leaven and be a new lump
[1:50:14] then we gotta we gotta make sure that
[1:50:16] our worship is pure
[1:50:18] our worship
[1:50:20] is free from malice and that word malice
[1:50:22] means malignancy
[1:50:24] free from a cancer spirit
[1:50:26] free from jealousy
[1:50:28] free from grudges
[1:50:31] free from complexes free from wickedness
[1:50:34] toward another
[1:50:35] see the bible would tell us let let us
[1:50:38] lay aside every weight
[1:50:41] and run the race that is set before us
[1:50:43] lay it all aside let every weight every
[1:50:45] sin that so easily besets us and the
[1:50:47] weight there means encumbrance anything
[1:50:49] that's going to hinder you from
[1:50:50] performing your best put it aside
[1:50:53] and run this race
[1:50:55] if you've got a complex put it aside and
[1:50:57] run this race if you're holding on to
[1:51:00] something that somebody said to you and
[1:51:02] you just won't let it go you've got to
[1:51:03] forgive in order that you can be
[1:51:05] forgiven put it aside and run the race
[1:51:08] if you want to be healed you want to be
[1:51:09] delivered you got to put those things
[1:51:11] aside and you got to be thoroughly
[1:51:13] cleansed we got to purge out the old
[1:51:15] leaven and we don't want the old leaven
[1:51:17] mixed in our worship we want pure
[1:51:19] worship we want godly worship we want an
[1:51:22] anointed worship and what am i telling
[1:51:24] you church when they slayed the lamb in
[1:51:26] the exodus what did they do they had to
[1:51:27] eat the lamb but they ate the lamb with
[1:51:29] the with the unleavened bread of
[1:51:31] spirituality and truth while god was
[1:51:34] showing the two together he was going to
[1:51:35] show you i am the bread of life that
[1:51:37] comes down from god out of heaven and
[1:51:39] don't you mix my word with some man's
[1:51:41] idea make the word pure keep the word
[1:51:44] that's what we're fighting for in this
[1:51:46] hour is to have a pure word a true word
[1:51:49] a word that'll change your body a word
[1:51:51] that'll change your life a word that'll
[1:51:53] heal you when you're sick or whether
[1:51:54] that'll save your life or we're going to
[1:51:56] go after your young people
[1:52:00] but we cannot allow leaven to mix in
[1:52:02] with our worship the word leaven here it
[1:52:06] means it's a species of corruption
[1:52:08] being produced by fermentation which in
[1:52:11] such cases tends to putrefication
[1:52:15] we don't want leaven in our worship
[1:52:18] if we had leaven in our worship would be
[1:52:20] no more than a denomination
[1:52:24] being manhandled
[1:52:26] do this do this have everything scripted
[1:52:28] you know when you're going to do this
[1:52:29] you know when you're going to do that
[1:52:30] they give you a flyer it's a no we don't
[1:52:31] want that we want pure
[1:52:33] unleavened worship
[1:52:36] and they said they had to eat the leaven
[1:52:38] with bitter herbs and this was designed
[1:52:40] to put them in mind of their bitter in
[1:52:42] in severe bondage that they were had in
[1:52:44] egypt
[1:52:45] i believe we're eating on those bitter
[1:52:46] herbs now
[1:52:48] god is telling you don't get used to
[1:52:49] this place
[1:52:51] don't get used to this place
[1:52:53] you see the gay pride you see the lbgtq
[1:52:56] you see all these movements this ain't
[1:52:57] just canada this ain't just united
[1:52:59] states it's a worldwide sweet because
[1:53:02] while satan is preparing his eating he's
[1:53:04] saying don't get used to his eating i
[1:53:06] got you another eating i'm taking you
[1:53:07] back
[1:53:08] i'm telling i brought you out of that i
[1:53:10] brought you out so i can take you in
[1:53:12] church don't settle for what you're
[1:53:13] looking around here well this is all
[1:53:15] that life was going to be i'm just a new
[1:53:16] fee no you're not just a new fan you're
[1:53:18] the bride of jesus christ and all things
[1:53:21] are possible if i can get you to believe
[1:53:24] tonight amen
[1:53:27] see no christians can have or give
[1:53:29] evidence of sincerity
[1:53:31] and not be willing to put away all sin
[1:53:34] no christian can have malice an ill will
[1:53:36] toward their brother or sister and claim
[1:53:38] to have sincerity and be come into the
[1:53:39] house of god and worship with a pure
[1:53:41] heart
[1:53:42] we can't wish to get even with one
[1:53:44] another
[1:53:45] or with another one and claim to oh
[1:53:48] raise our hands and we're super
[1:53:49] spiritual
[1:53:51] not if you're really sincere
[1:53:53] you'll make that thing right before you
[1:53:54] come into the house of god before you
[1:53:56] put your gift at the altar you're gonna
[1:53:58] make it right
[1:54:00] see we were told to purge out that
[1:54:02] leaven purge out the fermentation which
[1:54:04] leads to putrification purge it out we
[1:54:06] want our worship to be pure we want our
[1:54:08] hearts to be pure we want our homes to
[1:54:10] be pure
[1:54:13] watch what you allow into your home
[1:54:15] purge it all out and let me say this if
[1:54:17] we plan on witnessing miracles if we
[1:54:19] plan on witnessing healings we must keep
[1:54:22] anything from hindering the sincerity of
[1:54:24] our worship
[1:54:26] even in such a small church as this
[1:54:29] keep it protect the pulpit watch what's
[1:54:31] coming over this desk
[1:54:34] we want pure anointed word
[1:54:38] amen
[1:54:39] whether it be an evangelist whether it
[1:54:40] be a teacher whether it be a pastor
[1:54:42] whether it be whatever it may be it's
[1:54:44] got to be pure and it's got to be
[1:54:46] anointed
[1:54:50] see
[1:54:52] we must allow the holy spirit to move as
[1:54:54] he chooses
[1:54:56] and that's what we want to do tonight we
[1:54:58] won't allow the holy spirit to move as
[1:55:00] he chooses to move in this service
[1:55:02] i didn't come here tonight with a
[1:55:04] pre-prescribed motion or idea of what
[1:55:06] the service is going to do i'm saying
[1:55:08] god you move how you choose to but i can
[1:55:10] tell you one thing when i was before we
[1:55:12] left brother john's house things began
[1:55:14] to swirl in that downstairs basement and
[1:55:16] i began to feel something god's going to
[1:55:17] do something supernatural tonight
[1:55:20] i told my wife i said i'm feeling
[1:55:22] something i said i don't know what it is
[1:55:24] but i believe god is going to do
[1:55:25] something special
[1:55:26] god is going to move in a special way
[1:55:28] tonight oh church why am i not just
[1:55:30] telling you this just to fill a bunch of
[1:55:32] time i'm telling you this to get you in
[1:55:34] the right atmosphere so that you can
[1:55:36] believe so that all things will be
[1:55:37] possible for you to believe tonight god
[1:55:39] can only do for you as you already
[1:55:41] confess that he's done it god must be we
[1:55:44] got to let god be willing to move in
[1:55:46] each and every heart as he chooses amen
[1:55:50] we want god to move
[1:55:53] we have too many men today manhandling
[1:55:55] to worship
[1:55:57] shutting down on the anointing of the
[1:55:58] holy spirit and we find their churches
[1:56:00] are sitting dead
[1:56:02] i'm not going to go into all this
[1:56:04] because that's not what we're here for
[1:56:05] tonight but if we're planning on taking
[1:56:07] a body change we got to let the one that
[1:56:08] can change the body move in this local
[1:56:10] body
[1:56:12] he's got to be able to change right here
[1:56:13] tonight change our ideas
[1:56:16] change our views change our perspective
[1:56:19] change what we're looking at change how
[1:56:20] we're looking at it look at the word
[1:56:22] with spirituality look at the word with
[1:56:24] the unleavened bread not mixed with any
[1:56:27] man look we can't mix our own unbelief
[1:56:29] with it and expect to receive from god
[1:56:31] we can't mix our own ideas and expect to
[1:56:33] receive from god we can't interject
[1:56:35] psychology and expect to receive from
[1:56:37] god we can't put programs and ideas and
[1:56:40] self-help this and that into this
[1:56:42] message and expect to receive from god
[1:56:44] no matter what you're facing you got to
[1:56:46] face it with the the unleavened bread of
[1:56:48] sincerity and truth that you know that
[1:56:51] you met god's requirement and god has
[1:56:53] hand picked you for it and god's gonna
[1:56:55] bring you through it
[1:56:58] so no matter what it looks like we gotta
[1:56:59] purge out
[1:57:01] the old leaven
[1:57:04] and keep the feasts keep the worship
[1:57:06] keep the worship with unleavened bread
[1:57:08] of sincerity and truth
[1:57:11] now abraham we know the story of abraham
[1:57:14] i'm just going to
[1:57:15] go somewhere we'll come back but we're
[1:57:17] going to look at abraham just for a
[1:57:18] minute abraham was expected to believe
[1:57:20] something has never been done
[1:57:23] he was given a promise
[1:57:25] and abraham had faith
[1:57:28] he had faith to believe it was going to
[1:57:29] be in eight months
[1:57:31] he had faith in believing that something
[1:57:32] was going to happen the next day that
[1:57:34] she was going to feel different
[1:57:36] he had faith 25 years later
[1:57:39] that god was still going to bring the
[1:57:40] promise to pass
[1:57:41] he had faith when even hagar sarah gave
[1:57:44] him hate guards
[1:57:45] to bring forth the promise but god said
[1:57:47] it's not hagar that i'm going to bring
[1:57:49] it through i'm going to bring it through
[1:57:50] sarah
[1:57:51] and then when sarah judged him faithful
[1:57:53] when sarah saw herself in the promise
[1:57:55] when she saw that god not only anointed
[1:57:57] abraham because look sarah was tied to
[1:58:00] abraham and in one place brother branham
[1:58:02] said that sarah laughed in herself she
[1:58:04] laughed within herself and he said god
[1:58:05] should have struck her dead right there
[1:58:07] but god couldn't strike her because she
[1:58:09] was part of abraham she was part of the
[1:58:11] promise let me tell you in your unbelief
[1:58:13] should god should have struck you down
[1:58:15] but god can't strike you down god can't
[1:58:17] why because you're a part of the promise
[1:58:19] you're connected with christ let me tell
[1:58:21] you faith you had that revelation
[1:58:23] tonight and it really dropped down in
[1:58:25] your heart let me tell you there'd be no
[1:58:26] trial that you would face that would
[1:58:28] overcome you because you know i'm tied
[1:58:30] to the promise no matter what i gotta go
[1:58:32] through no matter how long it takes i'm
[1:58:35] tied to the promise god you should have
[1:58:37] struck me down but you can't strike me
[1:58:39] because i'm tired to the word
[1:58:42] we're gonna bring forth the promised son
[1:58:44] god's gonna have a bride she's gonna be
[1:58:46] without spot she's going to be without
[1:58:48] rico she's going to be without blemish
[1:58:50] she's going to be bone of his bone flesh
[1:58:52] of his flesh power of his power life of
[1:58:55] his life she is going to be the very
[1:58:57] manifestation
[1:58:58] she is him
[1:59:01] oh believe that tonight what is god
[1:59:03] doing he's getting the bride ready
[1:59:05] [Music]
[1:59:07] they said abraham was not weak in faith
[1:59:10] this bride ain't weak in faith hope that
[1:59:12] we've heard about it by a rapture though
[1:59:14] we heard about it abraham's body was now
[1:59:16] dead sarah's womb was dead yet the bible
[1:59:19] says he staggered not at the promises of
[1:59:21] god
[1:59:22] but he stood strong in faith
[1:59:25] giving glory to god
[1:59:27] being fully persuaded
[1:59:30] that what he promised
[1:59:32] he was able to do
[1:59:34] notice
[1:59:36] the bible tells us man shall not live by
[1:59:38] bread alone
[1:59:39] but by every word that perceives that a
[1:59:41] mouth of god
[1:59:42] see abraham wasn't living just on
[1:59:45] natural substance alone
[1:59:47] he was living on the promise of god
[1:59:49] god you gave me a promise
[1:59:51] and i know no matter how bad i get how
[1:59:54] decrepit i get how sore i get how tired
[1:59:57] i get how old i get how wrinkled i get
[2:00:00] i'm gonna have that son because you gave
[2:00:02] me the promise
[2:00:04] and not only that when he that son was
[2:00:06] born and god said take your son isaac
[2:00:08] and i want you to go off from up on that
[2:00:10] mountain god know he said god if you was
[2:00:12] able to give me one from the dead then
[2:00:13] you can raise him back up from the dead
[2:00:15] why he said the lad and i are going to
[2:00:17] worship and the lad and i are going to
[2:00:19] return that's the kind of faith that we
[2:00:20] got to have god you brought me to this
[2:00:22] trial i don't know how i'm going to get
[2:00:24] through it i don't know how i'm going to
[2:00:25] get over it but i know one thing god
[2:00:27] you're going to bring me through it
[2:00:28] because your word declares that you'll
[2:00:30] not put too much on me but what i'm able
[2:00:32] to bear
[2:00:35] so no matter what he faced how sick he
[2:00:37] got
[2:00:38] how old sarah got how crabby she got
[2:00:41] she got crabby
[2:00:44] i know you sisters don't want to hear
[2:00:45] that
[2:00:46] she did
[2:00:48] so she was in no mood to enter
[2:00:50] entertained those angels when they came
[2:00:52] by that day
[2:00:53] he was all out of sorts i took that as
[2:00:55] crabby
[2:00:57] that's the southern interpretation of
[2:00:59] all out of sorts
[2:01:02] i know y'all don't get like out here
[2:01:03] you're not southern
[2:01:05] you all get all out of sorts we get
[2:01:07] crabby
[2:01:08] but see abraham didn't struggle at the
[2:01:10] promise
[2:01:11] he believed the word of god
[2:01:14] oh if i can just get you to believe the
[2:01:16] word
[2:01:17] that's what i'm trying to do he believed
[2:01:19] the word though he didn't see it though
[2:01:21] he didn't feel it he made preparations
[2:01:24] for it 25 years later sarah how do you
[2:01:26] feel honey
[2:01:28] yeah i'm feeling okay
[2:01:31] oh but one day
[2:01:34] man three men come walking in
[2:01:37] one day
[2:01:38] he met the angel
[2:01:40] himself
[2:01:43] abraham i'm gonna have dinner with you
[2:01:46] where's your wife sarah
[2:01:48] called her by name
[2:01:50] tied her to the promise i'm telling you
[2:01:53] sir if i can get you to believe right
[2:01:54] now you judge him faithful got to
[2:01:56] produce that promised son
[2:01:58] got to produce that prayer request got
[2:02:00] to produce that child you're looking for
[2:02:02] got to do it
[2:02:04] see he trusted god and god gave the
[2:02:06] promise and god was able to manifest the
[2:02:08] promise
[2:02:09] he didn't struggle with the promise of
[2:02:11] god
[2:02:12] he didn't struggle though he was old he
[2:02:14] didn't struggle because when he looked
[2:02:15] at sarah and she was all wrinkled no he
[2:02:17] staggered not at the promise of god and
[2:02:20] god was hiding in abraham and sarah's
[2:02:22] life what he was going to do with the
[2:02:24] bride body in the end time
[2:02:26] what was he saying he's going to change
[2:02:28] our bodies back
[2:02:30] though it looks impossible
[2:02:32] get ready for the change
[2:02:34] god's going to do the supernatural
[2:02:38] see abraham didn't look at his old age
[2:02:39] he didn't look at these things he looked
[2:02:41] at the promise and brother man says no
[2:02:43] matter what it looks like we don't look
[2:02:45] at what we see we look at what we do not
[2:02:47] see is that right see the word seed
[2:02:49] doesn't mean he says that to see doesn't
[2:02:51] mean to look at the word c means to
[2:02:54] understand you have to accept it by
[2:02:56] faith and then when he comes into you
[2:02:58] you understand amen
[2:03:01] you accept healing the same way stay
[2:03:03] right with it not what you look at but
[2:03:05] what you believe what you understand to
[2:03:08] be the truth it says what you're looking
[2:03:10] at the unseen then stay with it
[2:03:12] amen all right now
[2:03:16] so he says it lays in
[2:03:19] your
[2:03:20] faith
[2:03:21] it lays in your faith let me just share
[2:03:23] a quote that i was listening to before i
[2:03:25] came to service
[2:03:26] tonight brother graham says come
[2:03:29] reverently sister believing nothing is
[2:03:31] impossible with god this is obama gilead
[2:03:34] in 1959. father as she holds the word of
[2:03:37] life in her hand may it become real to
[2:03:40] her for her desire in jesus name notice
[2:03:44] may she come reverently but he says this
[2:03:46] at the end this is what i wanted to say
[2:03:48] if you believe it with all your heart
[2:03:50] raise your hand in the commission of the
[2:03:53] holy spirit by the word of the living
[2:03:54] god i pronounce every one of you healed
[2:03:58] according to your faith
[2:04:02] see god's word says he's a healer
[2:04:05] by my stripes you are already healed
[2:04:09] so if you want healing tonight then
[2:04:11] you've got to appropriate the faith to
[2:04:12] produce the healing
[2:04:14] and some of you have mustard seed
[2:04:16] some of you have grapefruit faith marble
[2:04:18] faith some of you have mountain faith
[2:04:21] but you all have faith
[2:04:22] so just hang on to it until it manifests
[2:04:26] he said now that sickness this is in
[2:04:28] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[2:04:30] and forever in 1952 he said that
[2:04:32] sickness whatever you have if that is
[2:04:34] pulling on you you see it's going to try
[2:04:36] to put everything in your mind to keep
[2:04:39] you from believing that this is the
[2:04:40] truth he says this which is coming now
[2:04:43] me speaking to you is trying to get you
[2:04:46] to believe that it is the truth he says
[2:04:48] now here that's the warfare
[2:04:51] see satan's put in your mind it's not
[2:04:52] for you oh the pain the symptom the
[2:04:55] situation this that and the other but
[2:04:56] that's why we preach faith because i'm
[2:04:58] trying to get you he says me speaking to
[2:05:00] you now is trying to get you to believe
[2:05:01] that it is the truth he says that's the
[2:05:04] warfare he says if you'll believe it he
[2:05:06] said then this here the holy spirit will
[2:05:08] pronounce the blessing satan has to
[2:05:11] leave it has to be
[2:05:13] amen
[2:05:16] he said but brother it will take your
[2:05:18] faith to heal you
[2:05:20] so why did god allow a prophet to come
[2:05:23] and do all the supernatural
[2:05:25] this sign that sign this sign that sign
[2:05:27] prophet god will tell the main purpose
[2:05:29] that god is doing this is to try to get
[2:05:32] you to believe his son
[2:05:34] jesus christ died raised from the dead
[2:05:35] and is living among us tonight the same
[2:05:38] as he was standing there visible like
[2:05:40] you and me he and some of these other
[2:05:42] people are now he goes don't make any
[2:05:43] difference whether you have a prayer
[2:05:45] card the only thing i'm trying to do is
[2:05:47] to get you to believe the lord jesus
[2:05:48] christ and he will heal you
[2:05:52] you don't have to have a prayer card
[2:05:55] if you notice there's more healed out in
[2:05:57] the audience than there is that comes to
[2:05:58] the platform
[2:06:00] and here so we want to find we're going
[2:06:02] to come back to our our screen or our
[2:06:04] quote tonight the angel told me if you
[2:06:06] can get the people to believe you
[2:06:08] notice what he says
[2:06:10] not believe me as a man
[2:06:13] but believe the message i'm telling you
[2:06:17] don't believe me as a man
[2:06:19] because as a man i can fail you because
[2:06:21] as a man i will fail you because as a
[2:06:24] man i will i do have failures i'm not
[2:06:26] perfect but believe the message that i'm
[2:06:29] telling you see brother baby will say
[2:06:31] now listen to the order of it
[2:06:33] he says ministers especially
[2:06:36] so he's telling the ministers now he's
[2:06:37] trying to tell us how do we approach god
[2:06:39] to get our healing
[2:06:41] he says minister's expression now here
[2:06:43] it is now listen close if you get the
[2:06:45] people to believe you he said and be
[2:06:47] sincere when you pray nothing will stand
[2:06:50] before your prayer
[2:06:52] see how we put it all on a prophet
[2:06:54] because we take that first quote in 1947
[2:06:58] where the angel lord told him if you can
[2:06:59] get the people to believe you believe
[2:07:02] you you know and he says you know and be
[2:07:04] sincere when you pray nothing will stand
[2:07:06] before the prayer but here we find in 50
[2:07:08] he's a few years later the prophet of
[2:07:10] god comes back and he's telling us as
[2:07:12] ministers he's telling us as believers
[2:07:14] this is how you get your needs met from
[2:07:16] god you got to believe as a congregation
[2:07:20] my responsibility is to preach to you a
[2:07:22] level of faith to bring your faith up to
[2:07:24] believe the promise and to be sincere
[2:07:26] when i pray and then nothing will stand
[2:07:29] before your prayer
[2:07:32] amen see that's why we preach faith
[2:07:35] that's why i'm trying to get you to
[2:07:37] believe that's why we preach a living
[2:07:39] god we don't preach a dead god we don't
[2:07:41] preach a god of psychology we don't
[2:07:43] preach a god of circumstances we preach
[2:07:46] a living god that you can take him out
[2:07:48] of your little box that you put him in
[2:07:50] and watch that god move watch that god
[2:07:53] work watch that god have a motion if he
[2:07:55] wants to be emotional we let that god
[2:07:58] move with emotion if we want to sit
[2:07:59] there and god wants to be somber and he
[2:08:02] wants to be solemn we will accept god in
[2:08:04] that motion too we don't put limits on
[2:08:06] god we let god move as he chooses to
[2:08:09] move
[2:08:11] god can still do the miraculous
[2:08:15] notice that's why we preach we preach
[2:08:18] both the mechanics which is
[2:08:21] the word
[2:08:23] but we don't only preach the word
[2:08:25] because the bible says the letter
[2:08:27] killeth but the spirit gives the life so
[2:08:30] we preach the mechanics and the dynamics
[2:08:33] of the word
[2:08:35] what good is just having the mechanics
[2:08:37] what good is having a nice ferrari
[2:08:39] sitting outside if it ain't got no juice
[2:08:41] it ain't got no spark it's just all
[2:08:43] pretty look i ain't looking for pretty
[2:08:45] i'm looking to get down the road i'm not
[2:08:47] worried about how my worship looks i
[2:08:49] just want to get down the road how would
[2:08:51] i worship a living god it may be ugly
[2:08:54] but it don't matter he loves my worship
[2:08:57] glory
[2:08:58] it's got fire in it it's taking us
[2:09:00] somewhere we're moving beyond the
[2:09:02] humanity we're moving beyond our own
[2:09:04] self-made ideas and we're moving up into
[2:09:06] a level we're moving up to an atmosphere
[2:09:08] of faith where all things are possible
[2:09:13] notice
[2:09:15] that's why we preached a living god we
[2:09:18] preach a god that honors our faith
[2:09:20] individually
[2:09:22] to see miracles
[2:09:25] to see healing to see deliverance
[2:09:28] to see a god personal
[2:09:30] see god that's what he wants he wants to
[2:09:31] be personal
[2:09:33] to each and every one of you
[2:09:36] not just for your pastor not just for
[2:09:38] the ministers not just for the deacons
[2:09:40] and the song people and and all that god
[2:09:43] wants to be personal to you to you young
[2:09:46] people god wants a personal relationship
[2:09:49] that god can take a young girl and keep
[2:09:52] her and keep her pure keep her virtuous
[2:09:54] keep her in a modest look and keep her
[2:09:56] free from the world keep her from the
[2:09:58] scars of life god can do that but it
[2:10:00] starts with an atmosphere that's why we
[2:10:03] come to create an atmosphere we don't
[2:10:06] come and we just shut down on the
[2:10:07] ministry no we come we have a part to
[2:10:09] play god help me do my part help me
[2:10:12] create an atmosphere that lies can be
[2:10:14] changed
[2:10:18] notice now
[2:10:20] why
[2:10:23] why did the angel identify
[2:10:26] cancer see cancer was one of the
[2:10:29] greatest threats
[2:10:31] to the human life if not the greatest
[2:10:33] threat
[2:10:34] in the early 1900s up until the 19 mid
[2:10:37] 1940s see it wasn't until the mid 1940s
[2:10:40] or late 1940s the medical science began
[2:10:43] treating cancer and their first forms of
[2:10:45] treatment was with penicillin and sulfur
[2:10:48] therefore when somebody received the
[2:10:50] diagnosis of cancer they were a dead man
[2:10:52] walking
[2:10:53] they knew there was no hope of recovery
[2:10:56] you know maybe they
[2:10:58] they they they fear gripped their life
[2:11:00] and they fretted about how much pain how
[2:11:02] much suffering what were they going to
[2:11:04] have to go through and many times they
[2:11:06] gave up on life
[2:11:09] but the prophet
[2:11:10] had an angel
[2:11:12] would come to him
[2:11:14] in a room and says you got a gift
[2:11:16] and this ain't your gift this is the
[2:11:18] people's gift
[2:11:19] this is a gift of divine healing and i'm
[2:11:21] telling you not even the greatest threat
[2:11:23] to life will stand before the prayer
[2:11:26] amen if you can get them to believe and
[2:11:29] if you will be sincere when you pray not
[2:11:32] even cancer will stand before their
[2:11:33] prayer not even the greatest threat to
[2:11:37] life
[2:11:39] oh church
[2:11:40] not even if you could just just just
[2:11:43] grab hold of that tonight not even the
[2:11:45] greatest threat to life
[2:11:48] mark 9 and verse 23 jesus said unto them
[2:11:50] if thou can't believe
[2:11:53] all things
[2:11:55] not some things all things are possible
[2:11:58] to him that believeth
[2:12:00] mark 21 and 21 jesus answered said unto
[2:12:03] them verily verily i say unto you
[2:12:05] he that has faith and not doubt shall
[2:12:07] not only do this which is done in a fig
[2:12:09] tree but also if you shall say unto this
[2:12:12] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[2:12:14] cast into the sea it shall be done and
[2:12:17] all
[2:12:18] things whatsoever you shall ask in
[2:12:21] prayer believing you shall receive
[2:12:25] see god doesn't put limits
[2:12:28] on what you're able to ask
[2:12:30] god doesn't put limits he says all
[2:12:32] things
[2:12:33] if you can believe it i'll perform it
[2:12:37] if you can believe it i'll perform it
[2:12:39] whatsoever you ask the father in my name
[2:12:43] i will do it
[2:12:46] all things are possible for them that
[2:12:49] believe
[2:12:51] and the bible will tell us as we learned
[2:12:52] last night in hebrews 11 verse 6 but
[2:12:54] without faith it is impossible to please
[2:12:58] him for he that cometh that god must
[2:13:00] believe that he is and that he is a
[2:13:02] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[2:13:05] him so you say brother joe as they asked
[2:13:07] brother branham does everybody get well
[2:13:10] he says everybody that truly believes
[2:13:13] gets well
[2:13:16] that's a quote
[2:13:18] does everybody get well brother branham
[2:13:21] everybody that truly believes gets
[2:13:24] wealth thousands have been healed
[2:13:27] he said now
[2:13:29] the brazen serpent when they lifted up
[2:13:31] that serpent not all of them were healed
[2:13:33] but those that looked upon it and
[2:13:35] believe were healed
[2:13:37] all those that came down to the pool of
[2:13:39] bethesda all of them wasn't healed but
[2:13:41] those that had enough faith to get close
[2:13:43] enough when the angels stirred the pool
[2:13:45] and they were the first ones to get in
[2:13:46] they got their need met
[2:13:48] the same god responds the same way today
[2:13:51] church it's based on your faith
[2:13:53] and if i can get you to believe
[2:13:56] all things are possible see the thing of
[2:13:58] it is the thing it is he says is to get
[2:14:00] the people to believe that this
[2:14:02] is the truth so brother john brother for
[2:14:06] the lush our responsibility
[2:14:08] is to get to people to believe amen
[2:14:11] church your responsibility and i'm gonna
[2:14:13] share this with you your responsibility
[2:14:15] is to believe
[2:14:17] well brother i don't feel it that
[2:14:19] doesn't matter your responsibility is to
[2:14:20] believe
[2:14:22] he says i'm gonna pray for you this is
[2:14:24] in the angel and the commission be good
[2:14:26] for you to go back and listen to this he
[2:14:27] said the gift is not the discernment the
[2:14:29] gift is to pray for the sick and to get
[2:14:31] them to believe you get you give what i
[2:14:33] mean nothing shall stand before your
[2:14:35] prayer not even cancer he goes i'm gonna
[2:14:37] pray for you you believe i believe with
[2:14:39] all my heart and i lay hands over on
[2:14:41] them and pray for them asking the
[2:14:43] blessing in the name of the lord jesus
[2:14:45] and pass them on he says they're
[2:14:48] supposed to go away rejoicing believing
[2:14:50] that they're going to get well the
[2:14:52] crippled is supposed to believe that
[2:14:53] they're going to walk the blind is
[2:14:55] supposed to believe that they're going
[2:14:56] to see
[2:14:58] so our responsibility as to ministry is
[2:15:01] to get you to believe
[2:15:03] but it's also to be sincere to enter
[2:15:06] into prayer with you with love with
[2:15:09] empathy with sincerity so that we can
[2:15:12] move
[2:15:14] the situation we can move god's heart to
[2:15:16] that need
[2:15:18] but it takes it takes us working
[2:15:21] hand in hand and i believe that's why
[2:15:23] god had an angel come down and speak to
[2:15:25] a prophet he says it all but so that we
[2:15:28] could have what we have needed he says
[2:15:29] now notice this is in the angel that
[2:15:31] came to me and his commission this is
[2:15:33] another sermon 55 he said regardless of
[2:15:36] what they have he designated god who's
[2:15:39] my judge knows that he designated cancer
[2:15:42] said nothing if you can get to people to
[2:15:45] believe you and be sincere when you pray
[2:15:47] nothing shall stand before your prayer
[2:15:50] not even cancer
[2:15:52] earnestly contend for the faith he
[2:15:54] designated cancer would be healed and he
[2:15:57] said come here
[2:15:58] notice he did it
[2:16:01] the angel designated cancer he knew what
[2:16:04] the greatest threat to life was
[2:16:09] he says and if you'll be sincere when
[2:16:11] you pray and get them to believe you and
[2:16:13] be sincere when you pray nothing shall
[2:16:16] stand before your prayer not even cancer
[2:16:19] he says he
[2:16:21] spoke cancer that's the only disease
[2:16:24] that he said
[2:16:27] so no matter what disease you have
[2:16:29] tonight no matter what your situation is
[2:16:31] tonight if you will believe
[2:16:35] if you will believe see it's what you
[2:16:37] believe believe in god first believe in
[2:16:38] the son of god believe in jesus christ
[2:16:40] believe in the holy spirit believe in
[2:16:41] angels and then you've got to believe me
[2:16:44] that i'm telling you the truth do you
[2:16:46] believe that now that's wonderful
[2:16:49] so he's showing you got to believe these
[2:16:51] things but then you've got to believe
[2:16:52] what i'm telling you is the truth
[2:16:54] so as we're preaching tonight and we
[2:16:56] preached last night we're here trying to
[2:16:58] build your faith to get you to believe
[2:17:00] you got to believe it some of you raised
[2:17:02] your hand said you got a need
[2:17:03] you raised your hand said you need god
[2:17:05] to respond
[2:17:06] i will tell you this if you believe like
[2:17:09] god will respond you can believe tonight
[2:17:11] god will deliver you it may not be
[2:17:13] instantaneous but god will perform the
[2:17:15] work
[2:17:17] he goes you got to believe it got to
[2:17:19] testify you got to confess it and god
[2:17:21] will bring it to pass
[2:17:24] as we start wrapping this up because we
[2:17:26] have been we've been a little bit good
[2:17:31] see god can never go back on his word
[2:17:34] god can ever go back on he said my word
[2:17:36] will not return to me void
[2:17:39] so we know that brother bam is not the
[2:17:40] one that heals us the signs of
[2:17:42] discernment does not heal us but it's
[2:17:44] our faith to believe is what heals us
[2:17:47] and god used the signs god used to want
[2:17:50] us to catch the attention of the people
[2:17:52] to elevate their faith
[2:17:53] listen what he says here he says divine
[2:17:55] healing is the bait that you put on the
[2:17:57] hook the fish doesn't see the hook he
[2:17:59] just takes debate and gets to hook so
[2:18:01] that's the way it is he says people see
[2:18:03] the supernatural the phenomena of the
[2:18:05] supernatural god healingly sick he said
[2:18:08] and then they reach for that and the
[2:18:10] first thing you know the first thing you
[2:18:11] know they're right in the arms of the
[2:18:13] lord jesus with great faith to believe
[2:18:16] but they see the supernatural
[2:18:18] they hear about the supernatural they
[2:18:21] witness the evidence of the supernatural
[2:18:23] and they reach out in their right in the
[2:18:25] arms of christ with faith to believe for
[2:18:27] their own self
[2:18:30] so not even cancer now we find ministry
[2:18:34] as i'll address us for a minute
[2:18:36] sincerity we must be sincere
[2:18:41] when we pray
[2:18:42] we must be sincere
[2:18:46] if you can get them to believe and
[2:18:48] that's our responsibility but we have a
[2:18:50] responsibility and that's to be sincere
[2:18:53] and if we look
[2:18:54] here in the paradox lebron will talk
[2:18:57] about this he said a voice came there
[2:18:59] and he said there's great danger in
[2:19:01] these days there's a great hideous thing
[2:19:03] that is death when it strikes you
[2:19:06] and i heard the weeds smashing down and
[2:19:08] i looked and there come a huge monster
[2:19:10] snake crawling through the weeds and i
[2:19:12] thought
[2:19:13] i wonder what this is i know when this
[2:19:14] is a vision i've seen it see what kind
[2:19:16] of animal or what kind of beast it is
[2:19:18] and it crawled up on the highway and as
[2:19:19] soon as i i got sidon i knew it was a
[2:19:22] mamba he said as a man was an african
[2:19:24] snake and he says he says which is the
[2:19:25] most deadly bite of all things there's
[2:19:27] nothing as poison as a mamba and he says
[2:19:30] now the snake here of course represents
[2:19:32] death he said that comes the mamba his
[2:19:35] debt he's death he said he's so fast you
[2:19:38] just can't see him he goes over the top
[2:19:40] of the weeds and he propels himself with
[2:19:42] the back of his tail and he's just
[2:19:43] and then he's gone he hits you in the
[2:19:45] face and usually he stands up high
[2:19:47] strikes hard and when he hits you you've
[2:19:49] got just a few breaths to your finish
[2:19:51] see it don't only paralyze you but get
[2:19:53] into the bloodstream it gets into the
[2:19:55] nerves and everything and you just die
[2:19:56] in a few seconds
[2:19:58] and then native boys and track boys you
[2:20:00] can say mama and they'll butt their
[2:20:02] heads together and scream because it's
[2:20:04] death just as soon as you see see when
[2:20:06] it hits you
[2:20:07] he says now he was on the highway he
[2:20:10] goes there he was on the highway and i
[2:20:11] thought as i looked at him and i said he
[2:20:13] looked angry at me
[2:20:16] and he licked out his tongue and here he
[2:20:17] come but when he got right close to me
[2:20:20] he could run up fast and then he would
[2:20:23] just get slower and slower and just
[2:20:25] quiver and stop and then something would
[2:20:27] hold him off and he couldn't bite me i
[2:20:30] think the prophet knew where he stood
[2:20:32] i think he had faith in his own gift
[2:20:35] he had faith in his own ministry
[2:20:37] and he would turn around on the other
[2:20:40] side and he'd try to approach from this
[2:20:42] side he would get back and he'd start
[2:20:43] and he'd swish right towards me and get
[2:20:45] slower and slower and slower
[2:20:48] and then to a stop
[2:20:50] then shake like that and he would move
[2:20:51] back and he couldn't strike me
[2:20:54] but notice he said he turned and he
[2:20:56] looked at my friend and away he went
[2:20:57] after my friend i see my friend just
[2:20:59] jumping way in the air over him and over
[2:21:01] him and over him trying the thing was
[2:21:03] trying to strike at him and i thought if
[2:21:05] it ever hits him it'll be instant death
[2:21:08] and no wonder everybody's so scared
[2:21:10] because when the thing hits you is
[2:21:12] instant then and he was just striking at
[2:21:14] him like that and i threw my hands up i
[2:21:15] said oh god have mercy on my brother and
[2:21:18] i said if that serpent ever strikes him
[2:21:21] it'll kill him
[2:21:22] and just then the serpent turned to me
[2:21:25] and when i said that he looked at me
[2:21:27] again and a voice came from above me and
[2:21:29] said you have been given power to bind
[2:21:32] him
[2:21:33] the worst or in it
[2:21:36] you have been given given power to bind
[2:21:39] him the worst or any
[2:21:42] and i said god what must i do
[2:21:45] and he said there's one thing
[2:21:48] brother lush
[2:21:50] one thing
[2:21:51] brother john
[2:21:52] one thing what must i do he said there's
[2:21:56] one thing that you must do you must be
[2:21:58] more sincere
[2:22:02] you must be more sincere
[2:22:07] see you must be more sincere and he said
[2:22:10] well god forgive me for my insincerity
[2:22:12] let me have sincerity and when i raised
[2:22:15] up my hands to him again there was a
[2:22:17] great something came over me just lifted
[2:22:19] me up seemed like i my whole body was
[2:22:21] just charged with some and i looked at
[2:22:22] that serpent and when he started towards
[2:22:24] me he couldn't do it yet and i said
[2:22:27] satan in the name of the lord jesus
[2:22:28] christ i bind you he's in that serpent
[2:22:30] the blue fl uh smoke flew out of him and
[2:22:33] he curled up and made like an s sign a
[2:22:35] capital s sign made backwards the and
[2:22:38] sign in the n means by this one or
[2:22:41] anything below him because he was the
[2:22:43] worst
[2:22:45] blue smoke fell out of him and his tail
[2:22:47] choked his own life his own self to
[2:22:49] death around his head and when he made
[2:22:51] that backward zest that sign that
[2:22:53] conjunction you see he choked it to
[2:22:55] death and the brother was free
[2:22:59] so we find
[2:23:01] sincerity
[2:23:02] we have a part to play we have to be
[2:23:05] sincere and that same voice came again
[2:23:08] and said you can also unbind him
[2:23:12] and he says satan that i might know i
[2:23:14] unbind you when i did he started coming
[2:23:17] to life again wiggling and i said i bind
[2:23:19] you back in the name of jesus and when
[2:23:22] he didn't the smoke flew out of him
[2:23:23] again and he choked himself right back
[2:23:25] and turned the crystal you say brother
[2:23:27] joe how do we unbind him unbelief
[2:23:32] your unbelief unbinds the serpent
[2:23:35] but i want you to know you have power to
[2:23:37] bind him again
[2:23:39] you may have been given in to unbelief
[2:23:41] but that doesn't ruin you you just got
[2:23:43] to be more sincere you got to be
[2:23:45] believing for the supernatural god you
[2:23:47] can do what your word declares that you
[2:23:48] would do
[2:23:50] he says now this is in another message
[2:23:52] count down jeffersonville jesus asked
[2:23:55] jesus said you asked the father anything
[2:23:56] in my name and i'll do it if you ask and
[2:24:00] not doubt but when you pray to believe
[2:24:02] that you receive what you asked for it
[2:24:04] would be given to us said even you could
[2:24:07] say to this mountain be moved and not
[2:24:09] doubt in your heart but believe that
[2:24:10] what you have said will come to pass
[2:24:12] then you can have what you've said
[2:24:14] father we know that this is the truth
[2:24:17] we we watch it day by day there's no
[2:24:19] fault in your word it's because we can't
[2:24:22] be at the spot sometimes of our faith
[2:24:24] won't move us up there we flustrate and
[2:24:27] doubt but this morning we're trying to
[2:24:29] come lord with new hope holding on to
[2:24:32] lifeline of christ and his promise so
[2:24:35] notice it's not his word his word is
[2:24:37] right
[2:24:39] sometimes we frustrate it but god didn't
[2:24:42] respond in my time frame that doesn't
[2:24:44] matter he's still god
[2:24:47] don't allow frustrations don't allow
[2:24:49] doubt doubt to unbind the serpent in
[2:24:52] your life
[2:24:53] hold god is true god is faithful notice
[2:24:56] he says you have power to buy
[2:24:59] serpent
[2:25:00] the worst or any now as i end with this
[2:25:03] last story
[2:25:04] this is the story of the maniac at
[2:25:06] oregon many of us probably very familiar
[2:25:08] with this story
[2:25:10] but we find here this maniac he was just
[2:25:12] released out of jail or prison or
[2:25:13] something for breaking a another
[2:25:15] minister's jaw on his shoulder and
[2:25:16] brother brown said he was at a place
[2:25:18] there were 60 600 people sitting there
[2:25:21] now counting those that was on the
[2:25:22] outside and everybody was breathless and
[2:25:24] this man he he come up to brother
[2:25:26] branham and he threatened brother brown
[2:25:28] he made a challenge to brother branham
[2:25:29] and he you know he hocked up a lugia and
[2:25:31] spit it in his face
[2:25:33] trying to get the prophet of god to get
[2:25:35] in his flesh
[2:25:37] try to get him into his humanity
[2:25:41] i don't know about you but i wouldn't
[2:25:42] like nobody spitting in my face
[2:25:44] but this prophet stood there
[2:25:46] and he was just waiting he was going i
[2:25:48] wonder what's wrong with this man
[2:25:51] but you know brother batman talks about
[2:25:52] only he says only love
[2:25:55] can defeat satan
[2:25:57] what is love sincerity
[2:26:00] he says this man is some some lady's or
[2:26:03] husband
[2:26:05] some father to some children maybe he's
[2:26:07] married maybe he's got children he
[2:26:08] doesn't know me he doesn't feel this way
[2:26:10] toward me some spirit has got a hold of
[2:26:12] him and he's like this but he said
[2:26:15] because you've made a challenge to the
[2:26:17] spirit of
[2:26:18] god you made a challenge to the spirit
[2:26:21] of god he said the spirit of god accepts
[2:26:24] the challenge
[2:26:27] he goes and because of that you'll fall
[2:26:29] over my feet he said the presence of
[2:26:31] almighty god no matter what it is he's
[2:26:33] healed he said the very he's a very
[2:26:35] present help in a time of trouble he
[2:26:37] said don't be afraid stand on your
[2:26:40] ground when you face off with these
[2:26:42] these kind of people
[2:26:44] when you face off with a man or a woman
[2:26:46] who's possessed with a demon spirit he
[2:26:48] says stand your ground don't be afraid
[2:26:52] now i was sharing with some of the
[2:26:54] brothers at lunch today and i'll share
[2:26:55] just one of the stories with you with
[2:26:57] our louisiana youth camp on a sunday
[2:26:59] morning there was a young girl come
[2:27:00] outside and they wanted to have a
[2:27:01] minister some of the deacons had already
[2:27:03] prayed with us she had a little bit of
[2:27:04] fear and anxiety and she just didn't
[2:27:06] feel right to go back into service yet
[2:27:07] and i was coming up after an all night
[2:27:10] of praying for different ones and we had
[2:27:11] another case the night before saturday
[2:27:13] night that took us an hour and a half to
[2:27:15] get the young lady delivered but she
[2:27:16] finally was delivered but we find here
[2:27:19] that she needed more prayer and they
[2:27:20] called call for brother joseph let him
[2:27:22] go over there and pray for i was i think
[2:27:24] i was the only other minister there at
[2:27:25] the time that wasn't preaching the rest
[2:27:27] of them were sleeping you know how that
[2:27:28] is right and so i go over there and i
[2:27:31] begin to talk to her she's i just i got
[2:27:33] a little bit of anxiety a little bit of
[2:27:35] fear just wondering what i saw last
[2:27:36] night with my friends is this gonna come
[2:27:38] on me and i just politely put my hand on
[2:27:40] her shoulder begin to pray for and when
[2:27:42] i did that spirit began to speak out i
[2:27:44] don't like you
[2:27:47] i
[2:27:47] don't like you
[2:27:49] i said well good i don't like you either
[2:27:52] see i wasn't afraid because i knew my
[2:27:55] commission
[2:27:56] god had called us to cast out serpents
[2:27:59] cast out devils to lay hands on the sick
[2:28:02] and they shall recover
[2:28:05] see we want god to heal but god also
[2:28:07] delivers god also sets free
[2:28:10] and this spirit says i'm not going to
[2:28:12] let her go i said shut up in the name of
[2:28:14] the lord jesus christ you don't speak
[2:28:15] anymore and i began to pray for her and
[2:28:17] we cast that devil out and her body just
[2:28:19] relax
[2:28:21] there was a sister from brother donny
[2:28:23] reagan's church that stood there and or
[2:28:25] sit there and she said when that thing
[2:28:27] went to speak out i didn't know i needed
[2:28:28] to get up and run
[2:28:30] scared her to death she's never been a
[2:28:32] part of that
[2:28:34] but see that's the commission we're not
[2:28:35] playing church
[2:28:37] god is real and we have been
[2:28:41] commissioned
[2:28:42] to lay hands on the sick we have been
[2:28:45] commissioned to cast out satan we have
[2:28:47] been commissioned to preach the gospel
[2:28:50] with sincerity and we find when this
[2:28:52] maniac here all these preachers on the
[2:28:54] platform left the platform left the
[2:28:56] prophet of god up there by himself 128
[2:29:00] pounds and this man some 260 and he had
[2:29:02] already broken a man's jaw or broken a
[2:29:04] man's shoulder but he chained and
[2:29:06] challenged brother branham he challenged
[2:29:08] the spirit of god and when he challenged
[2:29:11] the spirit of god the spirit of god
[2:29:13] accepted a challenge what are you saying
[2:29:15] brother joe i'm telling you tonight that
[2:29:17] that devil of hell has challenged you
[2:29:19] that you can't have your family you
[2:29:21] can't have your health but i want you to
[2:29:22] know tonight there's a holy ghost here
[2:29:24] and it accepts the challenge
[2:29:27] it accepts your talents and he's here to
[2:29:29] fight for you he's here to deliver you
[2:29:36] man went to swing back when he did a
[2:29:38] prophet of god said satan in the name of
[2:29:40] jesus christ come out of him and he said
[2:29:42] he swirled around and around and he fell
[2:29:44] over his feet and two little policemen
[2:29:46] that he led to the lord earlier that
[2:29:48] week they said why is he healed he said
[2:29:50] no is he delivered he said no
[2:29:53] he said he's not healed he's not
[2:29:56] delivered he worships that thing
[2:30:00] it's because he thinks he's right
[2:30:05] if he he would have been delivered if he
[2:30:08] would have repented
[2:30:09] of his spirit amen but notice
[2:30:13] oh i just love this he said because you
[2:30:16] challenged the spirit of god tonight
[2:30:17] you'll fall over my feet he goes i don't
[2:30:20] know he goes i didn't know i said that
[2:30:22] he goes that was the spirit talking and
[2:30:24] it done took over them he said there was
[2:30:26] both challenges made he goes no sir he
[2:30:29] worships that spirit he brings it right
[2:30:31] back to him because he thinks he's right
[2:30:33] see he isn't healed he goes at that time
[2:30:36] when all those demons in there the chief
[2:30:38] man was defeated he said then they just
[2:30:41] began to rise up out of wheelchairs out
[2:30:43] of cots out of stretchers out of
[2:30:45] everything else and walk why because it
[2:30:47] was the end of the meeting while
[2:30:49] everybody was healed they walked out
[2:30:50] when satan was defeated the whole
[2:30:53] audience believed with one accord and
[2:30:55] they went out now if satan is defeated
[2:30:57] in one case then why can't we do the
[2:30:59] same i'll tell you in the name of the
[2:31:01] lord jesus
[2:31:02] down with satan down with his propaganda
[2:31:05] down with his unbelief and not with the
[2:31:07] spirit of god
[2:31:08] [Applause]
[2:31:10] he said the greatest devil the chief of
[2:31:12] all devils is unbelief
[2:31:14] because that's the only sin there is
[2:31:15] that's the only sin is a sin of unbelief
[2:31:18] he said but when the chief of that tribe
[2:31:19] of demons had made the challenge and
[2:31:21] lost you see he says that's when the
[2:31:24] spirit of god struck the building and
[2:31:26] everything was healed
[2:31:29] the devil made his challenge
[2:31:32] and the holy spirit challenged him back
[2:31:36] i'm declaring to you tonight church
[2:31:38] healing life fellowship there's a god
[2:31:41] and he's alive
[2:31:42] and he's accepting the challenge tonight
[2:31:46] he's accepting the challenge tonight
[2:31:48] we hear the story if we look here in
[2:31:50] numbers 13 as we bring this to a close
[2:31:53] we bring it to a close and he says they
[2:31:55] returned from searching the land after
[2:31:58] 40 days
[2:32:00] and they went and they came to moses and
[2:32:01] aaron and to all the congregation of the
[2:32:03] children of israel unto the wilderness
[2:32:05] of paran to kadesh and they brought back
[2:32:08] word unto them and to all the
[2:32:10] congregation and they showed them the
[2:32:12] fruit of the land
[2:32:14] my
[2:32:18] they showed them the evidence
[2:32:21] of healing

[2:32:24] supernatural

[2:32:37] crippled legs being made well little boy
[2:32:39] come through the platform with braces on
[2:32:41] his legs and the prophet of god said
[2:32:42] there he goes right there and the place
[2:32:44] goes into pandemonium because why he
[2:32:46] just five minutes before come through
[2:32:48] there and the prophet of god pronounced
[2:32:50] him healed pronounced him well and five
[2:32:52] minutes later he walked into his healing

[2:33:08] milk and honey and this is the fruit of
[2:33:10] it nevertheless the people are strong to
[2:33:12] dwell in the land and the cities are all
[2:33:13] walled up and very great
[2:33:15] and moreover we saw the children of anak

[2:33:43] the grapes of the land he ate of
[2:33:45] everything else that the land had to
[2:33:46] produce he seen everything that they saw
[2:33:49] but caleb said let us go at once
[2:33:52] and possess it for we are well
[2:33:55] able to possess the land
