[42:49] receiving your grace this morning, Lord.
[42:51] That'll take us up into heavenly places
[42:53] once again, Lord. Thank you for your
[42:55] goodness, Lord. Thank you for this
[42:57] beautiful day. Thank you for this
[42:58] beautiful people that have gathered,
[43:00] Lord, to hear your word once again this
[43:02] morning to lift up your name, Lord. To
[43:04] give back a little of what you've given
[43:06] us throughout our days and our weeks,
[43:07] heavenly father. Lord, once again, we
[43:09] ask you to bless us with your word,
[43:11] Lord. May you just reveal yourself to
[43:13] us, Lord. Open our eyes to see more of
[43:15] you this morning. We pray, Lord, for as
[43:17] we see more of you, we can reflect more
[43:19] of you, Lord. Help us to step a little
[43:21] higher. We ask in Jesus Christ's name
[43:23] we're praying it. Amen. And amen. And
[43:26] God bless you. Turn if you would to
[43:27] Proverbs. We'll start in ver chapter 14.
[43:31] Proverbs 14. Amen. Good to see everyone.
[43:33] Good to have a beautiful day after the
[43:35] the rain. We needed the rain, but I'll
[43:36] tell you, we need sunshine more than
[43:38] rain in Newfoundland. Amen. I'm willing
[43:40] to go into drought conditions to get us
[43:42] ready for the fall and the winter. Amen.
[43:45] But I sure appreciate it. Amen. Remember
[43:48] Jensen? He's homesick this morning. He
[43:50] got sick yesterday afternoon. And he's
[43:51] been in bed most of the time just kind
[43:53] of laying around and whatnot. And that's
[43:55] not like Jensen if you know him. So we
[43:57] want to remember him. Jonathan left
[43:59] yesterday to go to British Columbia for
[44:02] camp there. Uh and then he's going to
[44:03] visit mom afterwards. So remember him.
[44:05] And then brother Matt and Sister Amber
[44:06] have gone away. Amen. I'm just praying
[44:08] the Lord will give them a wonderful time
[44:10] of rest. Brother Matt works hard. He
[44:12] works hard in his day job and then he
[44:14] works hard in his uh his service here in
[44:16] the church between the audio visual and
[44:18] the deaconing and all these different
[44:19] things. So I'm just trusting the Lord
[44:21] will give them a wonderful blessing
[44:23] while they're away. They're going to be
[44:24] going to one of the family camps as
[44:26] well. Selena will be leaving, I think,
[44:27] in a in a week or two to to also go
[44:30] there as well. So, we just want the Lord
[44:32] to just bless us in his word. Amen. Not
[44:35] just with peace and rest. Amen. But to
[44:37] help us grow in those things and that
[44:38] when we take time away, we could be
[44:40] closer to God when we come back. Amen.
[44:42] God bless you. Proverbs 14. And we're
[44:44] going to actually start in verse 15, not
[44:46] 16, if that's okay. It says this, "The
[44:48] simple believeth every word, but the
[44:51] prudent man lookth well to his going."
[44:54] In other words, the prudent man looks
[44:55] what's coming ahead if he makes this
[44:58] decision. He doesn't just believe that
[45:00] the person says that it's good or it's
[45:02] right or it's for him, but he looks
[45:03] ahead and he says, "Where is this taking
[45:05] me?" And that's when he decides, is it
[45:07] good or is it bad? And now this is our
[45:09] our primary scripture. He says, "A wise
[45:11] man fearthth." That word fears mean is
[45:14] morally reverent.
[45:17] He says, "But and departeth from evil."
[45:20] He says, "But the fool rages rageth and
[45:23] is confident." I want us to just look at
[45:25] for a moment here that we're that phrase
[45:27] says, "Rages and is confident." Because
[45:29] you look around today, there's a lot of
[45:30] people raging. There's they're raging so
[45:32] much they're frothing at the mouth. So
[45:33] many times they're completely obsessed
[45:35] with their agendas and their ideas and
[45:37] these different things. But that's not
[45:39] what this word means here. This word
[45:40] rage means to take away, to transgress,
[45:43] or do away with. And it's speaking of a
[45:45] person that's taking away something that
[45:47] is set over them. It's taking away
[45:49] authority, control. It's taking away uh
[45:52] the the direction of law and of an
[45:54] absolute. And it's walking all over what
[45:57] has been declared to be right and moral.
[46:00] Amen. The first portion of the verse
[46:03] sets this up because it says, "A wise
[46:05] man, he reveres
[46:07] God's instruction." Amen. But a fool
[46:09] walks all over. We've heard that that
[46:11] saying, a fool walks with hobnailed
[46:13] shoes where angels fear to tread. This
[46:15] is what this really means. Amen. Is that
[46:17] fools dismiss the instruction of God and
[46:20] they walk all over it and they're
[46:22] confident in their disobedience. They're
[46:24] confident in it. Amen. They're self
[46:26] assured that they are in the right. Now,
[46:28] let's turn back two chapters to Proverbs
[46:31] 12 and verse 15. And it says, 'The way
[46:35] of a fool is right in his own eyes, but
[46:38] he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.
[46:41] And there's this great trap that we're
[46:43] facing today. And it's it's really the
[46:45] focus of our service is that the problem
[46:47] with a fool is he always thinks he's
[46:48] right. Amen. He always thinks he's
[46:51] right. He's always confident that he's
[46:53] right. Amen. But notice the contrast to
[46:55] a wise person. It's a person that can
[46:57] listen to counsel. a person that says,
[47:00] "I don't actually know it all and it's
[47:02] good for me to listen, not just talk all
[47:04] the time." Amen. Amen. It says, if you
[47:07] look in the book of Judges, we've talked
[47:09] about this before. It says that every
[47:10] man did that which was right in his own
[47:12] eyes. We could write that and say, "And
[47:13] every man was a fool."
[47:18] Because you do that which is right in
[47:19] your own eyes. That's what a fool does.
[47:21] That which is right in your own eyes.
[47:22] Amen. We do what we feel is right. We do
[47:24] what we think is right. But what they
[47:26] didn't do is they didn't check it with
[47:27] the word. And so that's what made them a
[47:30] fool. Amen. God bless you. You can have
[47:31] your seats this morning. Amen. And I'm
[47:34] going to take a final service. Hold your
[47:37] applause. A final service. God bless
[47:40] you, brother Mark and Sister Moren.
[47:41] Welcome back. Glad to see you made it.
[47:43] Had a wonderful time. You're smiling,
[47:45] happy, looking rested. So, God bless
[47:46] you. Amen. Trusting everyone else comes
[47:48] back equally rested. Amen. God bless
[47:51] you. And uh it's good we've got a backup
[47:53] now. It's wonderful to have Sister
[47:55] Priscilla that can just step in and and
[47:57] do that. Amen. So, we didn't we didn't
[47:59] lose too much when you went away, except
[48:01] your presence, of course. Amen. But I
[48:02] want to take this a final service on an
[48:04] echo chamber gospel. Amen. And I know
[48:07] some of this has been hard. Some of it's
[48:08] been straight. But as I said already,
[48:11] we're too close to the end to be pulling
[48:12] our punches. Amen. We're too close to be
[48:14] to be patting each other on the back
[48:15] saying, "It's all right. You got it.
[48:17] Don't worry about it." No. Brother Paul
[48:19] said, "Make your or Peter said, "Make
[48:21] your calling and election sure." In
[48:24] other words, he says, "Make sure you are
[48:26] what you say you are. Make sure you have
[48:28] what you say you have and make sure
[48:29] you're where you ought to be according
[48:31] to what the word says in terms of your
[48:33] position and your placing. Amen. So last
[48:35] service, just as a quick recap, we spoke
[48:38] about the deeds of the Nickelians and
[48:39] that was Satan's strategy to divide and
[48:42] conquer the church. And he was trying to
[48:44] set up the ministry as the elite so that
[48:46] people would look to them rather than to
[48:48] the Holy Spirit. And when they put the
[48:50] men into an elite position, then they
[48:52] could take control of the church. That
[48:54] was the deeds of the Nickelians. Now
[48:56] that's not altogether wrong to have men
[48:58] in charge of the church because
[48:59] Ephesians 4 says that God has placed in
[49:01] the church prophet apostles prophets
[49:04] evangelists pastors and teachers. So
[49:06] there are men that are placed in
[49:07] authority in the church but those men
[49:09] themselves have to be under the
[49:11] authority of the Holy Spirit. They don't
[49:13] just step in as men. Amen. And and their
[49:15] purpose if you read Ephesians 4, we
[49:17] won't read it for the sake of of length
[49:19] of service this morning. There's a lot
[49:21] of hay on my fork. But it the purpose of
[49:23] the five-fold ministry is to perfect us
[49:27] to bring us to maturity and to bring us
[49:30] to the unity of the faith. And Paul says
[49:32] when those anointed men by the Holy
[49:35] Spirit are preaching, they'll do two
[49:37] things. They will edify. In other words,
[49:39] it will be for the benefit of the body,
[49:42] not for the benefit necessarily of the
[49:43] preacher that's preaching. Amen. So
[49:45] they'll have a positive word effect and
[49:48] it will stabilize the church so that
[49:51] they're not tossed about by every wind
[49:54] of doctrine. In other words, it'll
[49:55] settle them on the word of God so that
[49:58] they aren't easily blown around. So that
[50:01] when life comes in, when situations come
[50:02] in, when influences come in, they know
[50:04] where they're standing and they know I
[50:06] don't have to move with this. I can stay
[50:08] right where I am. Amen. But there's a
[50:11] unity that comes under anointed
[50:13] preaching. And it's a unity of the
[50:14] faith. In other words, it's a unity
[50:16] that's under the word of God. Because
[50:18] our faith is only in the word. It's not
[50:20] in the man behind the pulpit. It's not
[50:21] in the ministry. It's in the word of
[50:23] God. Amen. So, we're in the unity of the
[50:25] faith. Why? Because we're all preaching
[50:27] the same thing and we're getting the
[50:30] same results.
[50:32] It doesn't matter if you go to church
[50:34] here, you go to church in Louisiana, you
[50:36] go to church to BC, Alberta, Belgium,
[50:38] wherever it is. If they are anointed by
[50:40] the spirit preaching the word of the
[50:42] hour, it will produce the same results.
[50:44] And we know that's true because we can
[50:46] go over there, we can go to different
[50:48] places and we visit them and we hear the
[50:50] same word and we meet the same kind of
[50:51] people with the same kind of spirit,
[50:54] right? It's doing the same thing. And
[50:55] our unity is not because we look the
[50:57] same, we have the same kind of money, we
[50:59] have a preacher that has the exact same
[51:00] style as No, no, no. It's because the
[51:03] spirit is speaking through an anointed
[51:05] ministry, a called ministry to bring the
[51:08] word to the people for their age and
[51:10] it's producing that word inside of those
[51:12] people. And we've been preaching on this
[51:14] idea of an echochamber gospel. And so
[51:16] much of what I've been preaching, I
[51:17] know, has been negative and that it's
[51:19] saying an echo chamber gospel is
[51:21] negative. But let me tell you, we have
[51:23] an echochamber gospel as a bride. Amen.
[51:27] The false gospel is that we speak and
[51:30] everyone repeats.
[51:33] But the bride is silent until the spirit
[51:36] speaks and then she repeats what he
[51:39] says. So we repeat, we are an echo
[51:42] chamber to the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[51:45] Because that's the spirit of truth.
[51:47] That's what tells us what is right. And
[51:48] here's the thing, we don't repeat it
[51:51] because it feels right in our heart. We
[51:54] don't repeat it because our mind says
[51:56] amen to it. But we repeat it when we
[51:58] check it with the word that's been given
[52:01] and it matches up to it. And then we
[52:03] say, "Amen. I can preach that. I can
[52:05] speak that. I can repeat that back. I
[52:07] can testify. I can confess that word
[52:09] that's coming forth." Amen. The check
[52:11] and balance of every spirit is this
[52:14] right here.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; It is not whether you believe that
[52:17] brother is saved and filled with the
[52:18] spirit or that person is a Christian.
[52:20] And the check and balance is the written
[52:22] word of God. That is our absolute. That
[52:25] is our absolute this morning. Amen. It's
[52:28] not wrong to say the same thing. It's
[52:30] wrong to say it because we're in a
[52:31] group.
[52:33] Amen. We say the same thing because we
[52:35] have the same spirit. Amen. And we've
[52:37] got to always check the source of it
[52:39] with the word of God. But notice this
[52:42] unity of the faith because we saw the
[52:44] deeds of the nickelians was to take out
[52:46] the unity of the faith and replace it
[52:48] with the unity of consensus.
[52:51] We all agree that this is right.
[52:53] Therefore, it is right. Amen. And so
[52:56] when we look at this what when this
[52:58] first really happened now obviously
[53:00] before this the time I'm going to talk
[53:02] about the council of Nika in 325 AD that
[53:05] they were trying to bring it in but it
[53:06] was just thoughts and ideas. But in the
[53:08] council of Nika in 325 AD, Constantine
[53:11] the Roman emperor, a professing
[53:13] Christian, brought all of the church
[53:15] members together and he says, "We're
[53:17] going to hash out once and for all what
[53:18] we believe." Now, at that at that uh
[53:22] that council, there was a man named
[53:24] Mucceius that had a lot of influence
[53:26] there. And I want you to catch his
[53:28] description of Constantine the emperor
[53:30] as he walks into the chamber there. He
[53:32] says, "He entered like some heavenly
[53:34] angel of God. His bright mantle shedding
[53:37] luster like beams of light, shining with
[53:40] the fiery radiance of a purple robe and
[53:43] decorated with the dazzling brilliance
[53:46] of gold and precious stones." Now, who
[53:50] does that sound like? We read last
[53:52] Sunday, remember, of Lucifer, and he was
[53:54] arrayed in precious stones and gold. And
[53:57] he shimmerred and he shone when he was
[53:59] in the light. But he was not the source
[54:01] of light, but he was reflecting light.
[54:03] And now Constantine, the head of this
[54:05] council, comes in. And who is he dressed
[54:07] like, church? He's dressed like Lucifer.
[54:10] He looks just like Lucifer. His very
[54:13] description matches what Lucifer's does
[54:15] in in the scriptures. Amen. And in that
[54:18] council, they sat everyone around and
[54:20] what did they do? They sat down and they
[54:22] found consensus rather than revelation.
[54:25] They said, "What do you think? What do
[54:27] you think? What do you think? What do
[54:28] you think?" And they went around and
[54:30] they debated and they debated and they
[54:31] debated until they came to a consensus.
[54:34] And what they did is they put out the
[54:36] leadership of the Holy Spirit and they
[54:38] brought in false doctrine. They brought
[54:39] in a false trinity. They brought in a
[54:41] false baptism. They brought in false
[54:43] controls. They brought it brought in a
[54:45] false hierarchy. And more to the point,
[54:47] Constantine after this council exiled
[54:51] anyone that didn't agree
[54:53] because he was more concerned with
[54:55] having consensus than having revelation,
[54:58] than having the truth. He wanted unity
[55:01] now of men,
[55:03] not the unity of the faith. So he put
[55:06] everyone out. Put them not out of just
[55:08] the church. He put them out of the land
[55:11] so that they couldn't find their way
[55:12] back and even bring the truth. Amen. So
[55:14] in other words, what they did in the
[55:16] council of Na is they put the word out.
[55:18] And when they put the word out, the Holy
[55:19] Spirit went right with it. Amen. Because
[55:22] he's the spirit of truth. If he's the
[55:24] spirit of truth and the truth isn't
[55:25] there, then the spirit can't be there
[55:27] either. It can't be leading. It can't be
[55:28] doing it. And so they use the unity of
[55:30] men to determine the direction of the
[55:32] church. And they put the entire world
[55:34] into dark ages, thousand years of
[55:37] darkness. Horrible. More than a thousand
[55:40] years of darkness because they decided
[55:42] in a way they were going. They created a
[55:44] gospel of their own design. They put
[55:46] everyone out that disagreed with it and
[55:48] they literally created an echochamber
[55:50] gospel. That's what the council of Na
[55:52] did and God wasn't in it. Church, look
[55:55] at the results and tell me God was in
[55:56] it. You can't look at the results and
[55:58] see that God was in it. But watch now
[56:00] because everything that comes from that
[56:02] false church is as tainted as that
[56:05] original church. It's a false vine.
[56:08] Everything tied to a false vine is
[56:10] false. You can't get truth out of
[56:13] falseness. You cannot do it. Amen. So, I
[56:16] want to take this back to the scriptures
[56:17] and just establish this this morning.
[56:19] This is certainly more teaching than
[56:20] preaching, I would imagine, this
[56:22] service, but I want us to look at that
[56:24] that that that false gospel, that first
[56:27] false church.
[56:30] And it says in Revelation 17,
[56:33] "And there came one of the seven angels
[56:35] which had the seven vials, and talked
[56:37] with me, saying unto me, come hither. I
[56:40] will show thee the judgment of the great
[56:43] that siteth upon many waters. Now
[56:45] remember in scriptures a woman always
[56:48] represents a church a church and waters
[56:50] always represent people. So this is a
[56:52] woman and she is not a bride. She is a
[56:55] She is a prostitute. She's an
[56:57] ill-famed woman. She's a woman that is
[56:59] intimate with men that are not her
[57:02] husband and she is a church. Okay? So,
[57:06] she's a church that is not married to
[57:08] Christ, but she'll work with anyone that
[57:10] will pay her what she asks for. Okay?
[57:13] Not only that, but in her church, she's
[57:16] exercising power over many people, over
[57:20] many waters. So, she's a filthy church
[57:23] with power over many people. And he
[57:26] says, God is going to judge her. He
[57:28] says, "I'm going to show you the
[57:29] judgment of this prostitute, this great
[57:30] whore." He says, "With whom the kings of
[57:33] the earth, the political powers of the
[57:34] earth, have committed fornication, and
[57:37] the inhabitants of the earth have been
[57:38] made drunk with the wine of her
[57:40] fornication." They drank what she was
[57:41] serving. Today, we'd say they drank her
[57:43] Kool-Aid. But this is not Kool-Aid. This
[57:46] is wine. It's drunk. It makes you think
[57:48] you're something that you're not. And
[57:51] you're completely consumed by it. Amen.
[57:52] So this is a people that have accepted
[57:55] her ideas, her creeds, her doctrines,
[57:57] her pleasures, her assurance that if you
[58:00] accept me and believe what I say, you'll
[58:02] be okay. And they're completely
[58:05] overwhelmed by it. Amen. Her assurance
[58:06] that they would be forgiven if they'd
[58:08] only recognize her as the church. He
[58:11] says, "So he carried me away in the
[58:13] spirit into the wilderness, and I saw a
[58:15] woman sit upon a scarlet-colored beast
[58:18] full of names of blasphemy, having seven
[58:21] heads and 10 horns." Now look at her
[58:23] power. A beast always means power in the
[58:25] scripture. And she's riding on a beast
[58:28] full of blasphemous names. Amen. So
[58:31] blasphemy is to speak against the things
[58:34] of God. That's what blasphemy is. And
[58:36] Jesus would say there's only one sin
[58:38] that can't be forgiven. And that's to
[58:40] blaspheme the Holy Spirit. In other
[58:43] words, to say something is not of God
[58:46] that is of God. So this is a church that
[58:49] is riding upon the power of people that
[58:52] declare the Holy Ghost to not be the
[58:55] Holy Ghost. In other words, she's saying
[58:57] she has it and nobody else has it. But
[58:59] what she's really doing is she's she's
[59:01] blaspheming that which is real and
[59:03] claiming it for herself. Amen. So the
[59:06] angel told John, "I'm going to show you
[59:07] the judgment of this church." And
[59:09] church, there's only one judgment that
[59:10] can't be forgiven. It's when you say
[59:12] that it's not God when it is God. Jesus
[59:15] said, 'I'll forgive you today. He says,
[59:18] 'But when the spirit of God comes, he's
[59:19] not going to do it. I'm here to die for
[59:22] your sins. I'm not here to judge you.
[59:24] But he says, there's judgment coming if
[59:26] you turn it down later. There's judgment
[59:28] coming if you turn it down later. So
[59:29] this church and all that's attached to
[59:31] her. See, she's riding a beast full of
[59:33] blasphemous names and they're all
[59:35] speaking against the Holy Ghost and
[59:37] they're preaching a false gospel of
[59:38] their own making where they control the
[59:40] people in the church. He says, "And the
[59:42] woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet
[59:44] color, and she was decked with gold and
[59:46] precious stones and per and and pearls."
[59:49] She's dressed just like Constantine was.
[59:51] She's dressed just like Lucifer was.
[59:52] Lucifer is her partner. She says, he
[59:55] says, "Having a golden cup in her hand,
[59:57] full of abominations and filthiness of
[1:00:00] her fornication, and upon her forehead
[1:00:03] was writen,
[1:00:05] mystery Babylon the great, the mother of
[1:00:08] harlots and abominations of the earth."
[1:00:11] In other words, she is the lifegiver to
[1:00:13] every prostitute that follows her. And
[1:00:16] she is the product of all the
[1:00:18] abominations in the earth. And she's a
[1:00:21] church.
[1:00:23] Wow.
[1:00:25] Wow. I want you to catch that. We said
[1:00:28] earlier that every church, this is the
[1:00:29] Catholic Church, we'll see. But every
[1:00:31] church that spun off the Catholic Church
[1:00:34] is as tainted as the Catholic Church.
[1:00:37] Why? Because even though they separated
[1:00:39] from the Catholic Church, they carried
[1:00:41] on her teachings and doctrines and her
[1:00:44] filth. She left the word and all they
[1:00:46] did was they put out the men of the pope
[1:00:49] and they brought in their own men. But
[1:00:51] they kept the doctrines. Amen. They kept
[1:00:53] her false trinity. They kept her false
[1:00:55] baptism. They most of them kept the pomp
[1:00:58] and circumstance of that church. They
[1:01:00] kept the traditions. They tied
[1:01:01] themselves to political influence. They
[1:01:03] put themselves under the leadership of
[1:01:05] men. And they did whatever it took to
[1:01:08] survive and thrive in this fallen world.
[1:01:10] They did whatever it would take. Amen.
[1:01:12] And in no case did they ever turn back
[1:01:14] to the source of power and life, which
[1:01:17] is the word quickened by the spirit of
[1:01:19] God. They never went backwards. Amen.
[1:01:21] Look at what these churches preach. Look
[1:01:23] at ignore the Catholic church. Look at
[1:01:25] the Protestant churches that protest the
[1:01:28] authority of the Catholic Church. But
[1:01:30] all they did was trade out the pope for
[1:01:32] a man of their own choosing for another
[1:01:34] headquarters for another person that
[1:01:36] would lead them. And the key doctrine
[1:01:38] that they carried through was a trinity
[1:01:40] which unders the truth of the godhead.
[1:01:43] And that's the foundational revelation
[1:01:45] for the church. Their primary doctrine
[1:01:48] is that which takes away the foundation
[1:01:50] of the church. That that that that that
[1:01:53] revelation of Jesus Christ of the
[1:01:55] Godhead is the open door. If you don't
[1:01:59] know who Christ is, then how can you be
[1:02:01] saved? What door can you walk through?
[1:02:03] Amen. Jesus said, "I am the way, the
[1:02:06] truth, and the life." And you know what
[1:02:08] the Catholic Church says? Not so. If you
[1:02:11] commit unless you commit yourself to
[1:02:13] this church, you're lost.
[1:02:16] Unless you take our communion served by
[1:02:19] our priests, you're lost. Amen. They say
[1:02:22] the Bible is not the ultimate truth, but
[1:02:25] the church is the source of truth.
[1:02:29] The church is the source of truth. And
[1:02:31] who determines the truth in the church?
[1:02:33] The pope.
[1:02:36] Listen. The Pentecostals say, "Unless
[1:02:38] you speak in tongues, you're not saved."
[1:02:41] The Baptists say, "Unless you believe
[1:02:43] the Trinity, you're not saved.
[1:02:46] It's just the carrying on of the same
[1:02:48] filth and abomination
[1:02:50] under a different name. Amen. It's
[1:02:53] churches claiming salvation in their
[1:02:55] name and the name that they've chosen
[1:02:57] for their church. Amen. They won't say
[1:02:59] it outright perhaps like the Catholics
[1:03:01] do, but their doctrine is their proof.
[1:03:03] Their blasphemous names. The power of
[1:03:05] the great is this ecumenical
[1:03:07] movement of churches that will turn back
[1:03:10] and many already have to the supporting
[1:03:12] alliance of the Catholic Church because
[1:03:14] they all believe the same foundational
[1:03:17] doctrines. We're a little different but
[1:03:20] in the key areas that matter. They say
[1:03:22] we are the same. We baptize in the name
[1:03:25] of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost rather
[1:03:26] than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:03:28] And we believe in three gods. They won't
[1:03:30] say it that way, but that's what they
[1:03:32] do. Amen. But let me take it to our
[1:03:35] doorstep. Like I said, we're not here to
[1:03:36] preach to people that are here. We're
[1:03:37] here to preach to people that are here.
[1:03:39] The message church says, "Unless you
[1:03:41] accept a prophet of this age, you're
[1:03:44] lost."
[1:03:45] To that, I would say as Paul did. You
[1:03:48] know, we say unless you believe God sent
[1:03:49] a prophet. Let me answer it the way Paul
[1:03:51] did. Have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:03:53] since you believed?
[1:03:56] It's not about receiving the prophet.
[1:03:58] It's about becoming the message that he
[1:03:59] gave you. Amen. If we aren't living what
[1:04:02] he preached, then we have all men most
[1:04:04] miserable because we're sitting by a
[1:04:05] painted fire rather than living in the
[1:04:08] presence of almighty God. Amen. We've
[1:04:10] got our own things to deal with, church.
[1:04:13] We're not going in because we believe
[1:04:14] the message. We're going in because
[1:04:16] we've accepted Christ into our life.
[1:04:19] We're in relationship. We're in a
[1:04:21] marriage.
[1:04:23] Not because we can nod our heads in our
[1:04:25] pews and say amen to the words that
[1:04:26] Brother John would say. It's not going
[1:04:28] to get us here. Amen. We are Christlike
[1:04:31] by the inddwelling Holy Spirit, not by
[1:04:35] attending a church.
[1:04:37] Amen. But the common link for this
[1:04:40] harlot church and her harlot daughters
[1:04:43] is that trinity doctrine. They split God
[1:04:45] into three personalities and they turn
[1:04:48] one true God into three true
[1:04:49] personalities.
[1:04:51] Three different purposes. Amen.
[1:04:55] They haven't gotten the revelation of
[1:04:57] God. And that was the great deviation
[1:04:59] from truth that happened in Nia and it's
[1:05:01] continued all the way through. Even the
[1:05:03] Pentecostals, the oneness Pentecostals
[1:05:05] don't have it right. They're the
[1:05:06] closest. But as the saying goes, close
[1:05:09] only counts in hand grenades and
[1:05:11] horseshoes.
[1:05:12] Close ain't going to make it, church.
[1:05:14] We've got to be on the mark. Amen.
[1:05:16] Jesus, you say, doesn't matter, brother
[1:05:18] John, that they're off a little bit.
[1:05:19] Jesus said, "They that worship me must
[1:05:22] worship me in spirit and in truth." Not
[1:05:26] in sincerity,
[1:05:28] in spirit and truth. Not in truth and no
[1:05:32] spirit or spirit and no truth. But they
[1:05:34] have to come together. The anointed word
[1:05:36] is what's going to make the difference.
[1:05:38] Amen. Sincerity and good intentions
[1:05:41] won't do it. And just the spirit won't
[1:05:43] do it either. Jesus said to his
[1:05:45] disciples, he said, "Who do you say that
[1:05:47] I am?" He said, "Who does everybody else
[1:05:49] say?" But then he says, "Who do you say
[1:05:51] I am? What is your revelation of who is
[1:05:53] standing before you?" And Peter would
[1:05:55] say, "I, thou art the Christ, the son of
[1:05:57] the living God." And Jesus answered and
[1:05:59] said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon
[1:06:01] Barjonah, for flesh and blood had not
[1:06:04] revealed it." What? This is a
[1:06:06] revelation. It is not a teaching. It is
[1:06:08] a personal revelation. Has not revealed
[1:06:10] it to thee, but my father which is in
[1:06:12] heaven. And I say also unto thee that
[1:06:14] thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
[1:06:17] will build my church, and the gates of
[1:06:20] hell shall not prevail against it.
[1:06:23] There's only one thing that won't fail,
[1:06:25] church, and that's a true revelation
[1:06:27] from God of his word. It's the only
[1:06:29] thing that won't fail. Listen, Peter
[1:06:31] fell right after this moment. The
[1:06:33] Catholic Church will say, "Well, he's
[1:06:34] building the church on Peter because
[1:06:35] Peter means little rock."
[1:06:38] That completely denies all scripture for
[1:06:40] starters. But right after this, Jesus
[1:06:43] turned around to Peter and he said, "Get
[1:06:44] behind me, Satan." Because Satan because
[1:06:46] Peter tried to convince Jesus not to do
[1:06:48] what the word was telling him to do.
[1:06:50] Peter denied him three times. Peter made
[1:06:52] a split in the church after he got the
[1:06:54] Holy Ghost. That's not somebody to build
[1:06:56] your church on. But remember what what
[1:06:58] the scripture says, the stone that the
[1:07:01] builders rejected has become the chief
[1:07:03] cornerstone.
[1:07:05] It's never been Peter. It's always been
[1:07:07] Christ. And not Christ, but the
[1:07:08] revelation of Christ. because there's an
[1:07:11] unveiling of God that's going on. And if
[1:07:13] you're stuck with an unveiling of Christ
[1:07:15] 2,000 years ago, you'll miss what's
[1:07:17] happening today. It's the revelation of
[1:07:20] Christ. It's the revelation of God to
[1:07:23] us. Listen to this. He says, "The Roman
[1:07:25] Catholics say the church is built upon
[1:07:27] Peter." He says, "Now, that's really
[1:07:29] carnal. How could God build a church
[1:07:31] upon a man so unstable that he denied
[1:07:33] the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing
[1:07:35] it?" God can't build his church upon any
[1:07:38] man born in sin. But here's the thing,
[1:07:40] church. Remember we said the the the the
[1:07:43] way that Satan does this is that he
[1:07:45] tells a lie and he sticks with it until
[1:07:46] people accept it. And so the thing is
[1:07:48] you tell a lie that Peter was the first
[1:07:50] pope, that Peter is the cornerstone, the
[1:07:53] foundation of the church. If you tell
[1:07:55] that lie and people accept it, then when
[1:07:57] Peter moves on and you get the next
[1:07:58] pope, you'll take him as the cornerstone
[1:08:00] and the next one and the next one and
[1:08:02] you build a church on a lie that you
[1:08:04] told going all the way back to the
[1:08:06] beginning.
[1:08:07] It allows you to keep control of your
[1:08:09] church when the first pope so goes away.
[1:08:14] Amen. And the crazy thing is is that
[1:08:16] from one pope to the next pope, they
[1:08:19] don't even agree with themselves. It's
[1:08:21] shifting sand. It's not a sure
[1:08:22] foundation. It's not a solid rock. It's
[1:08:24] a shifting sand. He says, "And it wasn't
[1:08:27] some rock lying there as though God had
[1:08:28] hallowed the ground at that spot. And it
[1:08:30] wasn't as the it isn't as the
[1:08:32] Protestants say that the church is built
[1:08:33] upon Jesus. It was the revelation." And
[1:08:36] he says, "Read it the way it's written.
[1:08:38] Fle flesh and blood had not revealed it,
[1:08:40] but my father had revealed it. And upon
[1:08:42] this rock, this revelation, I will build
[1:08:45] my church." He says, "The church is
[1:08:47] built on revelation on thus saith the
[1:08:50] Lord." Now, Peter was repeating
[1:08:53] something that God had revealed to him.
[1:08:55] That's what made it thus sayeth the
[1:08:56] Lord. Peter didn't come up with it. It
[1:08:59] was a direct revelation from God. That's
[1:09:01] what made it thus sayeth the Lord. God
[1:09:03] gave it to him. So when you believe in a
[1:09:05] trinity, you miss the true revealing of
[1:09:09] Christ. Amen. You miss the entirety of
[1:09:11] the Godhead. And from there, then you
[1:09:12] miss the mystery of godliness. Then you
[1:09:15] miss the mystery of the indwelling of
[1:09:17] the Holy Spirit. Then you miss the
[1:09:19] mystery of the word made flesh then and
[1:09:21] now because you got three separate
[1:09:24] people.
[1:09:26] How are you going to blend that now into
[1:09:27] a multimember body that has the same
[1:09:29] spirit of Christ in? If it's three
[1:09:31] separate people, now we've got a Godhead
[1:09:33] that's got multi-millions of members.
[1:09:36] But that's not the way it works.
[1:09:40] Amen. That's why I preached Godhead last
[1:09:43] year is to hopefully hopefully settle
[1:09:44] some of those things in your mind. But
[1:09:46] Christ, Jesus Christ is the re the
[1:09:49] revelation of God to humanity. He's the
[1:09:51] expression, the manifestation, the
[1:09:54] fullness, the visible God to us. That's
[1:09:57] what he is. Amen. So the Catholic Church
[1:09:59] and anyone that holds to that false
[1:10:01] doctrine is called a harlot, a a
[1:10:04] prostitute by God. She's not in any way
[1:10:06] serving God. She's not worshiping God,
[1:10:08] nor does she speak for God. She's not
[1:10:10] the true God. She's not full of saints
[1:10:12] and believers. To the contrary, listen
[1:10:15] to this. As we go back to Revelation 17,
[1:10:17] it says, "And I saw the woman drunken
[1:10:20] with the blood of the saints and with
[1:10:22] the blood of the martyrs of Jesus."
[1:10:25] She doesn't have the believers. She
[1:10:27] kills the believers.
[1:10:30] That's the sad truth. She is antirist.
[1:10:34] She is anti-believer. She's anti-word.
[1:10:36] And she'll destroy anything that gets in
[1:10:38] her way. Now, some say that the Catholic
[1:10:41] Church killed 68 million murders. The
[1:10:44] Catholic Church admits to 3 to 5,000.
[1:10:47] I don't know what the real number is.
[1:10:49] All I know is that the Bible says that
[1:10:50] they were drunk with it, which means
[1:10:52] more than a couple sips. Amen. She's
[1:10:55] been drinking on this for a long time.
[1:10:57] But watch this. She's drunken. But when
[1:11:00] John saw John says, "When I saw her, I
[1:11:03] wondered with great admiration." This
[1:11:06] was so beautiful that even the
[1:11:09] prophet of God said, "Wow."
[1:11:14] Knowing what she is, knowing she's a
[1:11:16] knowing she's Antichrist, yet
[1:11:19] when even the prophet looked at her, he
[1:11:21] said, "Wow.
[1:11:26] Why? Because Satan has always been
[1:11:28] appealing.
[1:11:30] From the very beginning, he's been
[1:11:32] appealing. He's been beautiful. He knows
[1:11:34] how to appeal to our senses, even a
[1:11:37] prophet's senses.
[1:11:40] In his flesh, John looked at her and she
[1:11:42] was sexy. That's what we would say
[1:11:44] today.
[1:11:47] But listen now. Remember, she sat on a
[1:11:50] beast with seven heads and 10 horns. And
[1:11:52] now he starts to open up. What does this
[1:11:54] mean? He says, "Here is the mind which
[1:11:56] has mi wisdom." Remember we said a fool
[1:11:58] won't listen to counsel. Here's what a
[1:12:01] wise one will say. The seven heads are
[1:12:04] seven mountains on which the woman
[1:12:06] siteth. What's the city of seven hills?
[1:12:09] Rome. Historically,
[1:12:11] he says, "And the woman which thou
[1:12:12] sawest is that great city which reignth
[1:12:14] over the kings of the earth." So, he's
[1:12:16] confirming this is a city and it's a
[1:12:18] type. It's the Vatican city in Rome. Now
[1:12:20] I want to jump to the next verse or next
[1:12:22] chapter 18 because I love the clarity of
[1:12:25] scripture. It doesn't have we don't have
[1:12:26] to guess. Amen. It shows us very
[1:12:29] clearly. So remember what he said to
[1:12:30] John. He says, "John, I'm going to show
[1:12:32] you the judgment of this great church,
[1:12:34] this great this false church."
[1:12:36] Now we jump into Revelation 18. He still
[1:12:38] hasn't shown the judgment. He's just
[1:12:40] shown who she is. Revelation 17 is
[1:12:43] showing who she is, what she's done,
[1:12:46] what's made her worthy of judgment. Now
[1:12:48] we come into 18 and he says, "And after
[1:12:49] these things, I saw another angel come
[1:12:51] down from heaven having great power and
[1:12:53] the earth was lighted lightened with his
[1:12:56] glory. And he cried mightily with a
[1:12:58] strong voice, saying, Babylon the great
[1:13:00] is fallen is fallen and has become the
[1:13:03] habitation of devils and the hold of
[1:13:05] every foul spirit and a cage of every
[1:13:08] unclean and hateful bird." This is the
[1:13:10] end result of that church.
[1:13:14] He's not saying she's destroyed here.
[1:13:16] He's saying she has fallen.
[1:13:19] And look at what she's full of. She is
[1:13:21] the habitation of devils.
[1:13:25] A church full of devils, every foul
[1:13:28] spirit, every unclean and hateful bird.
[1:13:32] He says, "For all nations have drunk of
[1:13:34] the wine of her fornication. And the
[1:13:38] kings of the earth have committed
[1:13:39] fornication with her, and the merchants
[1:13:41] of the earth are wax rich through the
[1:13:43] abundance of her delicacies." So, she's
[1:13:46] a spiritual force. She's a political
[1:13:48] force. And she's demonically controlled
[1:13:50] and inhabited. Amen. She seduced others
[1:13:53] and made them fall by her teachings and
[1:13:55] promises of pleasure. Who else would be
[1:13:57] so arrogant as to say that you can pay
[1:14:00] us and you won't have to reap what
[1:14:02] you've sowed.
[1:14:04] The the Catholic Church has an
[1:14:05] indulgence where if you come in to
[1:14:07] confession and you confess that you did
[1:14:09] it, then you can pay to not reap the
[1:14:12] consequences.
[1:14:13] The Bible literally says, "God is not
[1:14:16] mocked. Whatsoever a man sows, he shall
[1:14:18] reap." And the Catholic Church says,
[1:14:19] "Not so. If you give us a little bit of
[1:14:21] money, we can take care of that for
[1:14:22] you." And they say they're drawing from
[1:14:25] the multitude of the grace of Christ and
[1:14:27] his saints to do it.
[1:14:30] Anti-word.
[1:14:32] What are they doing? They're
[1:14:32] merchandising the gospel. It's all about
[1:14:35] money. It's all about power. It's all
[1:14:37] about influence.
[1:14:39] He says, ' And I heard another great
[1:14:41] voice
[1:14:43] from heaven, saying, 'Come out of her,
[1:14:44] my people, that ye be not partakers of
[1:14:47] her sins, and that you receive not of
[1:14:50] her plagues. Why come out? Cuz Christ
[1:14:52] isn't there. Christ is calling a bride
[1:14:55] out. We're not against the people. We're
[1:14:59] against the systems. It's the systems
[1:15:01] that run. Listen, we all come from
[1:15:03] different places. We've got people here
[1:15:05] from the Catholic Church. What do they
[1:15:07] hear a cry? Come out. Get out while you
[1:15:10] can because she is full of devils and
[1:15:12] demons.
[1:15:14] Amen. He says, "For her sins or sorry,
[1:15:17] come out of her, my people, that you be
[1:15:19] not partakers of her sins and that you
[1:15:21] receive not of her plagues. You don't
[1:15:22] want what's coming to her. Get out while
[1:15:24] you can." He says, "For her sins have
[1:15:27] reached unto heaven. And God hath
[1:15:28] remembered her iniquities." And he says,
[1:15:31] "Now reward her even as she rewarded you
[1:15:34] and double unto her, double according to
[1:15:36] her works. Whatever she gave, she's got
[1:15:38] to get twice as bad because she's got to
[1:15:40] reap what she sowed." He says,
[1:15:43] "According to her works, in the cup
[1:15:44] which she hath filled, fill to her
[1:15:48] double." Now, I want to set up the next
[1:15:50] portion of scripture, this verse seven,
[1:15:51] because remember what Satan said. He
[1:15:53] says, "I will ascend above the stars of
[1:15:55] heaven. I will be like God. I will be
[1:15:57] worshiped as God. I'm going to sit in
[1:15:58] the church being worshiped as God. I
[1:16:00] will. I will. I w I will. Now, watch
[1:16:03] God's judgment of this church. Amen.
[1:16:06] Watch how she got where she is. There's
[1:16:08] no doubt here that she is the
[1:16:09] fulfillment of Satan's intentions on
[1:16:11] this earth to be worshiped. Okay?
[1:16:15] But the people are ignorant of it. Now,
[1:16:17] watch what he says in verse 7. Because
[1:16:18] Satan said, "I will. I will. I will."
[1:16:20] Now, watch what she says. He says about
[1:16:22] her. How much how much she hath
[1:16:24] glorified herself and lived deliciously.
[1:16:30] So much torment and sorrow give her. For
[1:16:32] she saith in her heart, I sit a queen
[1:16:36] and am no widow and shall see no sorrow.
[1:16:40] So who glorified her? Who got the glory?
[1:16:42] Let me put it that way. She did. She
[1:16:44] glorified herself. Everything she was
[1:16:47] doing was to bring glory to her instead
[1:16:49] of to Christ. Okay. The it says she
[1:16:52] lived deliciously. That word means
[1:16:54] luxuriously. How? She merchandise the
[1:16:57] gospel. Richest church in the world.
[1:16:59] Catholic church.
[1:17:01] Until billions, possibly trillions of
[1:17:05] dollars.
[1:17:06] Assets. You know, they invest in the
[1:17:09] very things they say you're not allowed
[1:17:11] to do.
[1:17:13] There's a pope came in and he was going
[1:17:14] to expose it all and they killed him for
[1:17:15] doing it. There's a book on it called In
[1:17:18] God's Name by a investigative journalist
[1:17:21] named David Yalup. Wonderful, amazing,
[1:17:23] in-depth book. But he was going to
[1:17:24] expose the hypocrisy of the Catholic
[1:17:26] Church and clean it up. And they killed
[1:17:28] him. Church, you know why they killed
[1:17:30] him? This had to be. He couldn't clean
[1:17:33] it up. There was no cleaning it up. It
[1:17:35] was impossible. Amen. But she got the
[1:17:38] people to pay her for their sins and
[1:17:41] mistakes. She created a false place
[1:17:43] called purgatory where your relatives
[1:17:45] would go. And if you would pay, you
[1:17:47] could get them out so they didn't have
[1:17:48] to go through pain and suffering.
[1:17:50] What a wonderful business model. Created
[1:17:52] an imaginary place that can't be proven
[1:17:54] and pay people to take them out.
[1:17:57] Amen. She got people to pay for
[1:18:00] indulgence, indulgences, for positions.
[1:18:02] She worked with the kings and
[1:18:03] government. She started great crusades
[1:18:05] to take lands to herself. And all it was
[1:18:08] was all for her own gain. She glorified
[1:18:11] herself. But look at her final boast.
[1:18:13] She says, "I sit as a queen. I am no
[1:18:16] widow and I shall see no sorrow." She's
[1:18:18] a queen and she reigns alone. Amen. She
[1:18:21] says, "I'm not another I'm not a widow."
[1:18:23] In other words, she wasn't married to a
[1:18:25] king who died and then she took over.
[1:18:28] She has never had a king. She's never
[1:18:30] had headship. She's never had a husband.
[1:18:33] Why? Because she's a A A
[1:18:35] prostitute doesn't have a husband. You
[1:18:37] know what? She has a pimp. And that's
[1:18:40] what Satan has done. He has pimped her
[1:18:42] out to anybody that will pay the price.
[1:18:46] And what has she's done? She's slept her
[1:18:48] way to the top.
[1:18:50] Fornications and iniquities. And she's
[1:18:53] fooled every man, every government,
[1:18:55] every group. And now she sits in a place
[1:18:58] of power.
[1:19:00] Contrast that with Christ and his bride.
[1:19:01] It says, "We will rule and reign with
[1:19:04] him. We will reign under headship. We
[1:19:08] will reign in marriage."
[1:19:10] She has none of those things. Amen. She
[1:19:13] says, "I'll see no sorrow." She won't
[1:19:15] have to deal with the loss of a husband.
[1:19:17] She's saying this is a good thing. She's
[1:19:18] saying, "I don't have the burden of
[1:19:20] losing a man. I don't have to go through
[1:19:23] the sorrows of losing a love. I have no
[1:19:26] love except for myself." She's a
[1:19:29] selfmade woman and she's happy with it.
[1:19:34] This is a church, a people that can't be
[1:19:38] told anything. They do the speaking.
[1:19:41] They do not do the listening. Amen. We
[1:19:43] read our in our opening scripture these
[1:19:45] words, "The way of a fool is right in
[1:19:47] his own eyes, but he that hearkeneth
[1:19:49] under counsel is wise. She cannot be
[1:19:51] told she is wrong. She refuses to hear
[1:19:54] it." Amen. She's a fool and she believes
[1:19:55] beyond a shadow of doubt that she is
[1:19:57] vindicated and she will be vindicated as
[1:20:00] the one true church. And they preach it
[1:20:03] outside of our church. You are lost.
[1:20:05] Amen. But watch God's response. She
[1:20:08] says, "I will not mourn. I sit as a
[1:20:12] queen. I've got everything I need." And
[1:20:14] watch God's response. "Therefore shall
[1:20:16] her plagues come in one day and death,
[1:20:19] mourning, and famine, and she shall be
[1:20:22] utterly burned with fire. For strong is
[1:20:24] the Lord God who judges her." We read
[1:20:26] last service, last Sunday rather, how
[1:20:28] Satan said, "I'm going to have all this,
[1:20:30] and I'm going to do all this." And God
[1:20:31] says, "Yep, you're going to get it, but
[1:20:32] it won't last. I'm going to destroy it."
[1:20:34] And here we see what happens. Amen. She
[1:20:36] is completely destroyed in a single day.
[1:20:38] Total destruction. But I want to take us
[1:20:41] back to verse 7 where she said, it says,
[1:20:43] "She has glorified herself and lived
[1:20:45] luxuriously." As we close out this this
[1:20:47] thought on an echo chamber gospel today,
[1:20:49] because I would say it this way. This
[1:20:51] church, this prostitute has a very high
[1:20:54] opinion of herself and she's not scared
[1:20:57] to tell you how great she is.
[1:21:01] I'm trying not to grin because I've met
[1:21:04] people like this. She has the money. She
[1:21:06] has the fame. She has the influence. She
[1:21:08] has the access to great people. Amen.
[1:21:10] She has the confirmation of billions of
[1:21:13] followers and they're all patting each
[1:21:14] other on the back. But she has no
[1:21:16] husband. She has no Christ. She has
[1:21:20] everything except the one thing that
[1:21:21] matters.
[1:21:24] But like I said, don't put this on the
[1:21:25] Catholic Church alone. I know I'm naming
[1:21:28] names here, but we have to realize that
[1:21:30] every formal church system is satanic.
[1:21:36] That's why we are not a denomination.
[1:21:39] That's why we don't have a headquarters.
[1:21:42] That's why I'm not the one in charge of
[1:21:44] every single thing here. Amen. We have
[1:21:46] to answer to the word. And what happens
[1:21:50] is when we form ourselves into a formal
[1:21:52] group, Amen. We put a period after our
[1:21:56] beliefs, our creeds, our doctrines, and
[1:21:59] that's when we become a denomination is
[1:22:01] when we put it into words and we say,
[1:22:02] "This is it. No more." Okay? But the
[1:22:06] scripture says they're ever learning and
[1:22:08] never able to come to the knowledge of
[1:22:11] the truth. Why? Because they've declared
[1:22:13] what is truth already. They've put it in
[1:22:15] a box. They've sealed it up and said,
[1:22:17] "This is truth. There is no more."
[1:22:19] They're not standing on revelation,
[1:22:21] remember? They're standing on religious
[1:22:23] consensus. They're in an echo chamber of
[1:22:25] their own making. Now, let's take this
[1:22:27] to the final church age, the seventh
[1:22:29] church age, the Leodysian church age,
[1:22:30] and see their condition. And I want to
[1:22:32] preface this with one thing, and that's
[1:22:34] to say that this church has nothing good
[1:22:36] in it. This church age we're in, God has
[1:22:39] nothing good to say about the nominal
[1:22:42] professing Christian church. There's
[1:22:45] nothing good here. Amen. It's bound for
[1:22:47] judgment. It's the only church age that
[1:22:49] God had nothing to good to say about it.
[1:22:51] There were no redeeming qualities in
[1:22:52] this last church age for those
[1:22:55] self-professed Christians. Amen. It's
[1:22:57] completely devoid of Christ. It's devoid
[1:22:59] of his word. It's devoid of everything
[1:23:02] that he mentions is supposed to be there
[1:23:05] and he can't work with them in any way.
[1:23:06] They kicked him out because they refused
[1:23:08] the word of God and it's come full
[1:23:10] circle. Now look at Revelation 3. It
[1:23:12] says unto the angel of the church of the
[1:23:14] Leadyans, right? Unto the messenger of
[1:23:16] the church of the Leadyans. Why do we
[1:23:18] believe in a prophet? Because there has
[1:23:20] to be one according to Revelation 3:2
[1:23:23] 3:14. There has to be an angel prophet.
[1:23:25] There has to be a messenger from God.
[1:23:27] Revelation 1 says, "Those seven an stars
[1:23:30] are the seven angels, the seven
[1:23:32] messengers to the seven church ages, the
[1:23:34] gentile church ages." So there's a
[1:23:36] message that's given and it says, "These
[1:23:38] things sayeth the amen, the faithful and
[1:23:40] true witness, the beginning of the
[1:23:42] creation of God." This is the real deal.
[1:23:44] He's the start and he's the end and he's
[1:23:46] never failed in between. Okay? He's the
[1:23:49] real deal. He's the absolute. He says,
[1:23:50] "I know thy works." Speaking to the
[1:23:53] church now, the church age.
[1:23:56] I know thy works that thou art neither
[1:23:58] cold nor hot. I would, he says, I want
[1:24:00] you to be cold or hot. In other words,
[1:24:03] they're luke lukewarm as we'll read in
[1:24:04] the next scripture. And you only get
[1:24:06] lukewarm by mixing cold and hot. Or you
[1:24:11] leave something that was cold in the hot
[1:24:13] sun and what does it do? It warms up a
[1:24:15] little. or something that is hot, you
[1:24:17] leave it in a cold area and it cools
[1:24:18] off. It's a cooling off or a tempering.
[1:24:23] Nobody Well, it's funny. Preachers a lot
[1:24:26] of time actually want lukewarm water
[1:24:27] because the cold water causes your your
[1:24:29] vocal cords to shrink. But nobody
[1:24:30] generally speaking says, "I would kill
[1:24:33] for a glass of lukewarm water."
[1:24:37] We don't do it. We either want it hot or
[1:24:39] cold. And God says, "I want you to be
[1:24:40] hot or cold. One or the other. Don't be
[1:24:42] in between."
[1:24:44] Amen. The seventh church age began with
[1:24:47] the Isuza Street revival in California
[1:24:49] where God poured out the Holy Spirit and
[1:24:51] gifts in the first major way since the
[1:24:54] day of Pentecost. And it was absolutely
[1:24:56] God. It was absolutely a move of God. It
[1:24:59] was the truth. It was pure. It was
[1:25:01] right. And if you look at it, it wasn't
[1:25:03] organized. It was an open church with a
[1:25:06] a a black man blind in one eye in there
[1:25:09] praying for the Holy Ghost. And what
[1:25:12] happened is a bunch of people came in
[1:25:13] and they started praying to receive the
[1:25:15] Holy Ghost. And God honored that
[1:25:16] request. And he poured out the Holy
[1:25:18] Ghost on that group. And they started to
[1:25:20] do all sorts of things, not just speak
[1:25:21] in tongues. They started to prophesy.
[1:25:23] They started to minister. They started
[1:25:25] to testify. They didn't have one man
[1:25:27] over it all. They would get up and
[1:25:29] preach as the spirit gave utterance. It
[1:25:32] wasn't organized at all. Amen. It was a
[1:25:34] bunch of nobodies calling on God. And
[1:25:36] God came down in a special way. They
[1:25:38] said the presence of God was so
[1:25:39] powerful. This was just a little hvel of
[1:25:41] a building church. This was nothing
[1:25:43] special. People, sinners would walk in.
[1:25:47] They would come through the door and the
[1:25:48] presence of God was so powerful. They
[1:25:50] would hit their knees in repentance
[1:25:52] right there.
[1:25:54] Why? Because it was the spirit of God
[1:25:56] moving, not just a bunch of men trying
[1:25:58] to make things happen.
[1:26:00] But what happened after that? They were
[1:26:02] baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:04] Christ. They were professing the oneness
[1:26:06] of God. They were preaching. They had
[1:26:09] corrected supposedly the errors of that
[1:26:11] that they've been going on for so long.
[1:26:13] But then the assemblies of God came
[1:26:14] along and they believed in the evidence
[1:26:16] of tongues as the as being that you have
[1:26:18] the Holy Ghost. And the other group
[1:26:20] didn't. So what' they do? They organized
[1:26:21] and they split off. And then another
[1:26:23] group jumped into Matthew 28:19
[1:26:26] and went to baptize in the name of the
[1:26:28] father, the son, the holy ghost. And
[1:26:30] that turned into the United Pentecostal
[1:26:31] church. And they split off. And what was
[1:26:33] it? Organization. Organization.
[1:26:35] Organization.
[1:26:37] They put a period behind what they
[1:26:38] believed and what happened? Spirit of
[1:26:40] God moved on. Amen. They started
[1:26:44] defining their individual doctrines,
[1:26:47] putting a period behind it and saying
[1:26:49] this is our church. This is what we
[1:26:50] believe. They put a period behind it and
[1:26:53] God had to move on. Why? Because God
[1:26:55] never stops revealing himself. Church,
[1:26:58] look at your Old Testament and you will
[1:27:00] see God revealed in many ways.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop
[1:27:05] with a pillar of fire. He didn't stop
[1:27:07] with a pillar of cloud. He didn't stop
[1:27:09] with Moses. He kept moving on and
[1:27:11] revealing more and more of himself. Then
[1:27:13] he comes in Christ. I mean, you go
[1:27:16] beyond Moses. You go you go back to
[1:27:18] Abraham. You look at mezz
[1:27:22] Lord, a man coming on the plains of
[1:27:24] memory. You see Christ. You see God
[1:27:26] revealing himself constantly.
[1:27:29] You couldn't stop. But when you stop,
[1:27:31] God keeps moving because he's trying to
[1:27:33] get us to a resurrection and a rapture.
[1:27:35] He's trying to get us to the fullness of
[1:27:37] the unity of the faith, which is a
[1:27:39] complete revelation of him in us. And so
[1:27:42] what's he doing? God keeps moving on. We
[1:27:44] see it in the Old Testament. Then we see
[1:27:46] it in the New Testament. Listen, even
[1:27:48] Peter, the man with the keys to the
[1:27:50] kingdom, he says, "Our brother Paul," he
[1:27:52] preaches things hard to understand.
[1:27:55] That's a man full of the Holy Ghost that
[1:27:57] spent time with God in flesh. And he
[1:28:00] says, "Paul's preaching things I've
[1:28:02] never heard about." Why? Because God was
[1:28:04] continuing to reveal himself to his
[1:28:06] people for the sake of revealing himself
[1:28:08] in his people.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; It's not just learning. It's a
[1:28:12] manifestation. It's an acceptance of the
[1:28:14] very presence of God that he would
[1:28:16] reveal himself through your life and
[1:28:18] mine. That's what we're preaching this
[1:28:20] morning is not doctrine. We're preaching
[1:28:22] Christ coming down and showing himself
[1:28:24] through a bride of believers.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here this morning.
[1:28:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:30] That's why we're here. God never stops
[1:28:32] and he won't stop revealing himself
[1:28:34] until we get to that great resurrection
[1:28:36] and rapture morning. But what stops
[1:28:39] progress when we stop? When we put a
[1:28:42] period behind it, we basically say,
[1:28:44] "God, we've got it all. We figured it
[1:28:46] out. We don't need to grow. We don't
[1:28:48] need a greater greater revelation." And
[1:28:50] what do we do? Like the settlers of old,
[1:28:51] we circle the wagons and we protect our
[1:28:53] doctrine. We protect our church. We
[1:28:56] protect our ministry. We protect our
[1:28:57] creeds. protect our results. And God's
[1:29:01] saying, "You need to keep moving to the
[1:29:02] promised land, not circling your wagons.
[1:29:05] You haven't reached the end, so keep
[1:29:06] pushing, keep pulling." Amen. Protecting
[1:29:11] creeds at all costs, rather than letting
[1:29:13] God open our eyes to a greater
[1:29:15] revelation. Listen, if Peter could have
[1:29:17] his eyes open to a greater revelation,
[1:29:18] having been the first to receive the
[1:29:20] critical revelation, how much more do we
[1:29:23] You know what I love? You know what I
[1:29:25] love about this message is that what we
[1:29:27] were preaching 30 years ago is not what
[1:29:29] we're preaching today. Not that it's
[1:29:30] different, but it has grown.
[1:29:33] It has grown. We have a greater
[1:29:34] understanding. We have a greater reality
[1:29:36] of what was preached. It's continuing to
[1:29:40] grow. We're understanding more. We're
[1:29:42] getting deeper into the word. And it's
[1:29:44] why? Because God is moving on. And as
[1:29:47] the scripture says, if we walk in the
[1:29:48] light as he is in the light, then we
[1:29:50] have fellowship one with another. And
[1:29:52] the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all
[1:29:54] of our sins.
[1:29:56] He's moving constantly. Amen. There's an
[1:29:59] ongoing progressive revelation of God
[1:30:01] today. And we've got to continue to let
[1:30:03] him open our eyes and we'll see that's
[1:30:05] the the cure for this church age. Amen.
[1:30:08] But what happens is if we put a period
[1:30:10] behind what we believe, if we circle our
[1:30:12] wagons around a church doctrine, then
[1:30:14] what happens is God sends his angel
[1:30:16] messenger. God sends anointed preachers
[1:30:19] and with a message straight from him and
[1:30:21] we say, "hm, that's weird. My daddy
[1:30:23] doesn't preach that. My church doesn't
[1:30:25] believe that. That's heresy."
[1:30:28] And it's not. It's God further revealing
[1:30:31] themselves, but we're so busy trying to
[1:30:32] protect what we have, we can't go on
[1:30:34] into what God has for us. We can't move
[1:30:36] forward. Amen. What is it? It's a church
[1:30:39] that's left in partial darkness getting
[1:30:42] darker.
[1:30:44] It's not that what they have is not
[1:30:46] truth.
[1:30:47] It's that it's not the full truth and
[1:30:48] they're choosing to stay in the past
[1:30:51] rather than move with God into the
[1:30:53] present and on into the future. As he
[1:30:55] moves away, what happens? They get
[1:30:57] darker and darker and darker because
[1:31:00] they won't move with him. The church
[1:31:01] isn't the light. Christ is the light.
[1:31:04] The word is the light. And so when your
[1:31:06] church says we are the light, no, you
[1:31:08] got to have him to be the light. You've
[1:31:10] got to walk with him as he moves. And
[1:31:12] you get that in the Old Testament. You
[1:31:13] look at the Old Testament. type of this
[1:31:15] is in the Old Testament when Israel went
[1:31:17] out, remember they were led by the
[1:31:19] pillar of fire and by the pillar of
[1:31:20] cloud. So when the pillar of fire moved,
[1:31:23] they moved. And if it stayed, they
[1:31:25] stayed. And it didn't matter if that
[1:31:28] cloud or that pillar of fire picked up
[1:31:30] at 3:00 a.m. and started moving church,
[1:31:32] they didn't get to say, "We're sleepy.
[1:31:33] We're going to stay here till the
[1:31:34] morning." They moved when he moved. They
[1:31:36] stopped when he stopped. And so it is
[1:31:39] today. Paul said, "Sons of God are led
[1:31:42] by the spirit of God." Amen. So as the
[1:31:45] pillar of light, as the light for the
[1:31:47] age moves through the church ages, the
[1:31:49] elect had to move with it. That's what
[1:31:51] we see is time and time again, they
[1:31:53] heard the message for their age and they
[1:31:55] moved on into overcoming. That's what
[1:31:57] brought them through. Amen.
[1:31:59] The the the churches today are looking
[1:32:02] backwards to what they had and forwards
[1:32:04] to what they're going to have, but
[1:32:05] they're not in the middle of it. And
[1:32:06] that's what separates the bride from
[1:32:08] everyone else is she's in the middle of
[1:32:09] the word as it's happening rather than
[1:32:11] looking behind or forward. That's what
[1:32:14] makes us different. That's what makes
[1:32:16] the bride different. Amen.
[1:32:20] You look at the Catholic Church. What
[1:32:22] did they do? They went and they killed
[1:32:24] real saints of God. Then later realized
[1:32:26] their error, dug them up, canonized
[1:32:29] them, made them saints, and said,
[1:32:31] "Whoops,
[1:32:33] my bad." What did they do? They missed
[1:32:36] God while he was moving. And by then,
[1:32:38] God had moved far beyond that point.
[1:32:40] They were correcting an error and not
[1:32:41] realizing they were still in the error.
[1:32:45] The bride will hear what the spirit says
[1:32:47] because she's receiving the message for
[1:32:49] her hour. Our message is not speak in
[1:32:51] tongues. It's not dance in the spirit.
[1:32:54] It's not even just believe. What is our
[1:32:57] message, church? Jesus Christ the same
[1:32:59] yesterday, today, and forever. It's
[1:33:03] Christ in you, the hope of glory. It's
[1:33:05] calling us to adoption. It's calling us
[1:33:06] to a body change. is calling us to a
[1:33:08] resurrection and and a rapture. Amen.
[1:33:10] Listen, many churches don't even believe
[1:33:12] in a rapture. How are you going to go in
[1:33:13] something you don't believe in?
[1:33:16] We've understand now, and this is one of
[1:33:18] the things we've seen in this message
[1:33:19] that as we've grown in Revelation
[1:33:21] understanding is that the rapture is not
[1:33:23] an event. The rapture is a process.
[1:33:25] We're being caught up word upon word,
[1:33:28] line upon line, here, a little, there
[1:33:30] little. And the last step is just the
[1:33:32] final step of many steps that came
[1:33:34] before. If you're not in a rapture
[1:33:36] process now, as I heard a brother say
[1:33:37] recently, I highly doubt you're going to
[1:33:39] go in a rapture.
[1:33:41] Why? Because God's been moving all
[1:33:43] along.
[1:33:44] God's trying to get a people ready to
[1:33:47] go. Amen.
[1:33:49] What's happened? The churches didn't
[1:33:52] want to hear what the spirit was saying
[1:33:53] because it didn't match up with what
[1:33:55] their church was saying. And so, they
[1:33:57] put it out completely. And all you're
[1:33:58] left then with is is a church
[1:34:00] organization instead of the spirit of
[1:34:02] God.
[1:34:04] But Brian would say this. He says, 'We
[1:34:05] are not the same. You are a separated
[1:34:08] people, holy unto the Lord, dedicated to
[1:34:11] the word and the spirit of God to bear
[1:34:14] fruit of his promise of this day. He
[1:34:18] says, you're not of them. I know that's
[1:34:20] awful strong, but that's the truth just
[1:34:22] the same. You're dedicated to a service
[1:34:24] in these last days. He says, come out
[1:34:26] from amongst it. Can I say this? You
[1:34:29] know my heart. We have kids that go to
[1:34:31] denominational schools.
[1:34:34] And I say this, be careful.
[1:34:36] We are not of them. Good people,
[1:34:41] lovely people.
[1:34:45] My, you know, the principle at First
[1:34:47] Baptist, what a wonderful man,
[1:34:51] a great man.
[1:34:53] But we're not like them. And don't ever
[1:34:56] think for a second that we are because
[1:34:58] the minute you do it, you'll compromise
[1:35:00] and you'll go down to where they are
[1:35:02] rather than try and pull them up to
[1:35:03] where you are. And I'm not saying that
[1:35:05] as elitist. I'm not saying that as
[1:35:06] anything like that. I'm saying don't get
[1:35:08] dragged back into their system. Don't
[1:35:10] get dragged back into their system.
[1:35:12] Don't get dragged into their sincerity.
[1:35:15] Amen. We're here to pull people up, not
[1:35:18] to go down. We've got to hold fast.
[1:35:21] Listen to what he says to this this
[1:35:24] leady in church.
[1:35:27] He says, "So then, because thou art
[1:35:29] lukewarm and neither hot, cold nor hot,
[1:35:31] I will spew thee out of my mouth." What
[1:35:33] comes out of your mouth? Words. He says,
[1:35:36] "I'll take you away from where the word
[1:35:37] is preached. You'll have no more word
[1:35:40] anymore. You'll be left to your own."
[1:35:42] What's where do where do words come from
[1:35:43] if we're not in the mouth? We got to
[1:35:45] produce them ourselves. It's a gospel of
[1:35:47] our own making. Now, catch this. Because
[1:35:50] thou sayest, this is the echo chamber.
[1:35:53] No, they're all saying the same thing. I
[1:35:55] am riched. I am increased with goods and
[1:35:58] have need of nothing. That's her claim.
[1:36:02] Now, God's, this is God's reading of the
[1:36:05] situation. He says, "And knowest not
[1:36:07] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[1:36:10] poor and blind and naked." Remember, we
[1:36:13] read of Satan's queen, that great
[1:36:15] She glorified herself. Here we see where
[1:36:18] that happens. It's in the seventh church
[1:36:20] age. It's where they say, "I've got it
[1:36:23] all. I've got it all. She's got it all."
[1:36:27] And church, physically speaking, she has
[1:36:28] it all. You look at the Catholic Church.
[1:36:31] You look at the big denominational
[1:36:32] churches today. They've got money.
[1:36:34] They've got numbers. They've got
[1:36:35] followers. They've got influence.
[1:36:37] They can sway elections.
[1:36:40] That's how powerful these churches are.
[1:36:42] They have it all. Amen.
[1:36:45] They have the formula for growth. They
[1:36:48] have the formula for growth. They'll go
[1:36:50] into a place church. They'll start out
[1:36:51] with 10 people and in two years they've
[1:36:53] got 2,000.
[1:36:55] Compare that with us.
[1:36:57] We hover more or less around 40 to 50.
[1:37:00] No matter what.
[1:37:02] No matter what. Why? It's not about a
[1:37:05] formula for success.
[1:37:08] Success is souls sealed with the spirit,
[1:37:12] not people sitting their butts in the
[1:37:14] pews. That's not ever going to be it.
[1:37:16] It's not going to be it, church. It
[1:37:19] isn't the gospel if everyone accepts it.
[1:37:21] As we preached not too long ago,
[1:37:23] straight is the gate, narrow is the way,
[1:37:25] and few there be that find it. Their
[1:37:27] claim is, "We've got it all." And Christ
[1:37:28] says, "You have nothing." Not only do
[1:37:31] you not have what you say you have, but
[1:37:33] you are wretched. You're miserable,
[1:37:35] poor, blind, and naked. And to top it
[1:37:37] off, you don't even realize it.
[1:37:41] They've been listening to themselves for
[1:37:42] so long. and their criteria for
[1:37:44] spirituality is based on physical
[1:37:46] blessing rather than spiritual blessing
[1:37:49] that they believe their own lie. They've
[1:37:51] con convinced themselves of their own
[1:37:53] goodness and acceptance before God.
[1:37:56] Catch this. He says, "Thou sayest, I am
[1:37:57] rich and increase with goods." He says,
[1:37:59] "This literally means, I have spiritual
[1:38:01] riches." This sounds like the millennium
[1:38:03] with streets of gold and the presence of
[1:38:04] God. He says, "But I wonder if this is
[1:38:06] so. Is the church truly rich in the
[1:38:08] spiritual things of God? Let us examine
[1:38:11] this 20th century layout to see him
[1:38:13] boast in the light of the word. If the
[1:38:15] church were truly spiritually rich, its
[1:38:17] influence will be felt upon community
[1:38:19] life. But what exactly but exactly what
[1:38:22] kind of lives are these so-called
[1:38:24] spiritual and influential men of the
[1:38:25] community living? He says out in
[1:38:28] suburbia, out in the betterass
[1:38:30] districts, there are bounds wife
[1:38:31] swapping, prostitution, bans of children
[1:38:34] crashing parties exacting a terrible
[1:38:36] toll in property damage. immorality has
[1:38:38] reached an all-time high. Impromiscuous
[1:38:41] sex acts, narcotic addiction, gambling,
[1:38:43] stealing, and all kinds of evil. And the
[1:38:46] church goes on claiming, "How fine is
[1:38:48] this generation? How full are the
[1:38:49] churches, and how responsive are even
[1:38:51] the natives on the mission fields? The
[1:38:53] church has turned the people over to the
[1:38:55] doctors, especially the psychiatrists."
[1:38:58] He says, "How it can pray about being
[1:39:01] rich spiritually is more than I know. It
[1:39:03] isn't true. They are bankrupt and don't
[1:39:05] know it. Take a good look around you.
[1:39:07] Examine the people as they walk by. In
[1:39:10] the multitudes, you see, can you pick
[1:39:13] out those that have the appearance of
[1:39:15] Christians? This is just outward
[1:39:16] appearance. He's saying, "Watch how they
[1:39:19] dress. Watch how they act, hear what
[1:39:22] they say, and see where they go. Surely
[1:39:25] that ought to be some real evidence of
[1:39:26] the new birth amongst all these that we
[1:39:28] see go by." He says, "But few there be."
[1:39:31] Yet today the fundamental churches are
[1:39:33] telling us they have millions saved and
[1:39:35] even spiritfilled.
[1:39:37] He says spiritfilled.
[1:39:39] Can you call women spiritfilled with
[1:39:41] frizzy bobbed hair, shorts and slacks,
[1:39:43] halters and briefs all painted up like
[1:39:45] Jezebel? He said if these are adorned in
[1:39:48] modest apparel has become Christian
[1:39:49] women. I would hate to think what it
[1:39:52] would be like if I had to witness a
[1:39:54] display of immodesty.
[1:39:56] Isn't that the truth? Remember, Satan's
[1:40:00] queen won't be told what to do. She's
[1:40:02] self assured. She glorifies herself, and
[1:40:05] she will do her own thing every time.
[1:40:07] And we see her this idea of telling a
[1:40:09] lie and continuing it until it becomes
[1:40:12] acceptable to live contrary to the word,
[1:40:14] to dress contrary to the word, to act
[1:40:16] contrary to the word, act in a way I'm
[1:40:19] becoming a Christian by the word, and
[1:40:21] not just make it okay, but literally now
[1:40:24] to glorify those things in church. Now I
[1:40:28] have seen with my own two eyes
[1:40:31] professing Christian churches with men
[1:40:33] dressed as women,
[1:40:36] homosexuals
[1:40:38] singing actual rock and roll. Not rock
[1:40:42] and roll with Christian lyrics. Actual
[1:40:45] rock and roll in the church. That's
[1:40:48] where they've come. Church
[1:40:50] rock and roll. What's it based on? Drugs
[1:40:53] and sex. And you're bringing that into
[1:40:55] your church. It shows you who you're
[1:40:57] worshiping. It shows you who you're
[1:40:59] worshiping. Amen. We've got preachers
[1:41:02] that are preaching that sex sexuality
[1:41:04] outside of marriage is okay. Heard it
[1:41:08] with my own two ears. Okay. We've got
[1:41:11] preachers not only saying alternate
[1:41:13] lifestyles are okay, but actually doing
[1:41:16] it. We actually have one in the United
[1:41:18] Methodist Church here just moved there
[1:41:19] with his husband. Preacher, professing
[1:41:22] preacher, I should say.
[1:41:27] What do they say? You can do whatever
[1:41:28] you want as long as you come to church
[1:41:30] on Sunday,
[1:41:32] right?
[1:41:33] You can speak in tongues on Monday and
[1:41:36] you can on Sunday and you can curse on
[1:41:38] Monday.
[1:41:39] I've heard preachers curse over the
[1:41:42] pulpit.
[1:41:45] James said, "Brothers,
[1:41:48] can sweet and bitter water come out of
[1:41:50] the same fountain?"
[1:41:53] And the answer there is no. But yet
[1:41:55] Christianity today says absolutely.
[1:41:57] You're one way in church and you're one
[1:42:00] way out there or you're what you're all
[1:42:02] all the time and it doesn't matter as
[1:42:04] long as you have a good heart.
[1:42:07] That's it's become the the litmus test
[1:42:09] is do you have a good heart?
[1:42:12] And I they don't even define what a good
[1:42:14] heart is. I think it's defined that you
[1:42:16] come to our church. That's not going to
[1:42:18] cut it.
[1:42:21] He says when nobody when anybody says I
[1:42:23] have need of nothing, he could very well
[1:42:24] be saying I have everything. Or he could
[1:42:26] be saying I don't want anymore as I am
[1:42:28] full now. You can express this any way
[1:42:30] you want and it all adds up to the fact
[1:42:32] that the church is complacent. She is
[1:42:34] satisfied with what she has. She either
[1:42:37] figures she has it all or she has
[1:42:39] enough. He says that's exactly what we
[1:42:41] find today. What denomination is not
[1:42:43] claiming that it has the revelation and
[1:42:44] the power and the truth? Listen to the
[1:42:47] Baptists, they have it all. Listen to
[1:42:48] the Methodists. They have it all. Listen
[1:42:50] to the Church of Christ and everyone is
[1:42:51] wrong but them. Hear what the
[1:42:52] Pentecostals say and they have the
[1:42:54] fullness of the fullness. But they know
[1:42:56] I'm telling the truth about them for not
[1:42:58] one of their manuals say any different.
[1:43:00] They wrote it all out just so nice and
[1:43:02] put their names to it and finished it
[1:43:03] all up. He says God just doesn't have
[1:43:06] anymore. He's not saying God doesn't
[1:43:08] have anymore. He's saying their
[1:43:09] declaration is we've got everything God
[1:43:10] has for us. God has more. Believe me.
[1:43:14] Watch how he puts it. He says, "And
[1:43:15] there are those that just don't want
[1:43:16] anymore. They do not believe in divine
[1:43:19] healing and would not want it although
[1:43:21] it is in the word. There are those who
[1:43:23] would not take the Holy Spirit if God
[1:43:24] opened the heavens and showed them a
[1:43:25] sign. Now they are all saying and trying
[1:43:28] to prove that they have it all or they
[1:43:29] have enough. He says yet is that the
[1:43:31] truth? He says compare this 20th century
[1:43:34] church to the first century church. Go
[1:43:37] ahead, do that. Where is the power?
[1:43:39] Where is the love? Where is the purified
[1:43:42] church that withtood sin and walked with
[1:43:45] faith toward Jesus? Where's the unity?
[1:43:47] He says, 'You can't find it. If this
[1:43:49] church has all it needs, he says, why
[1:43:52] were they crying out for more of God in
[1:43:53] the book of Acts? As though they didn't
[1:43:55] have it all, and yet they have far more
[1:43:57] than they have today. Remember in Acts
[1:43:59] two, the spirits poured out. Acts four,
[1:44:01] they're in the room crying out for more
[1:44:03] of God. They've just had an outpouring
[1:44:05] of the spirit like most have never
[1:44:06] experienced in their lives. And that
[1:44:08] they come back in Acts four and say, "We
[1:44:09] need more of you because we've got great
[1:44:11] work to do and we're going to need it."
[1:44:13] And he says, "Today they're claiming to
[1:44:14] have more than those people and yet
[1:44:17] they're not crying out for more of God.
[1:44:19] They don't have more and they're still
[1:44:21] not crying out for God." He says,
[1:44:22] "There's a disconnect here somewhere."
[1:44:24] How can you have what they have and not
[1:44:25] be crying out for more? If you're like
[1:44:28] the same church, the cry will always be
[1:44:29] there. This is that great trap of of
[1:44:32] knowledge without reality, of truth
[1:44:34] without spirit. For they have to go
[1:44:36] together. Truth and spirit have to go to
[1:44:37] together. Our message is Jesus Christ
[1:44:40] the same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:44:42] And I want to preach to us now. Can we
[1:44:44] claim it?
[1:44:46] Can we say that when people see me, they
[1:44:48] see Christ?
[1:44:50] Not in affirming you, but in affirming
[1:44:52] him.
[1:44:53] Can they see that in our lives? Amen.
[1:44:56] This is our message. This is our time.
[1:44:58] This is our church. This is our service.
[1:44:59] Can we look at our lives and say, "I am
[1:45:01] a living manifestation of Jesus Christ
[1:45:04] today."
[1:45:05] Do we have a painted fire or are we
[1:45:07] living next to the fire of the Holy
[1:45:08] Spirit? Amen. What's our daily
[1:45:10] testimony?
[1:45:12] What's our daily testimony look like?
[1:45:14] What do our Remember what brother Ram
[1:45:15] said. He says, "Watch how they dress.
[1:45:17] Watch how they talk. Watch where they
[1:45:19] go. Watch what they do." What does that
[1:45:21] testify of us this evening this morning?
[1:45:24] If we know the truth, have we become the
[1:45:26] truth? Or are we satisfied to just say,
[1:45:29] "I'm surrounded by the truth." Have we
[1:45:31] tasted and seen that the Lord is good?
[1:45:33] Or are we sitting back looking at the
[1:45:35] table not sure if it's really for us
[1:45:37] yet?
[1:45:39] Is our prayer for more of him or more
[1:45:41] for me?
[1:45:44] Let me say that again. Is our prayer for
[1:45:46] more of him
[1:45:48] or more stuff for me? Are we so busy
[1:45:51] looking at the opportunities and the
[1:45:52] potential of tomorrow
[1:45:55] for ourselves to live a better life, to
[1:45:57] live an easier life, to get a spouse, to
[1:45:59] get a job, to get a this, to get a that,
[1:46:01] that we're sitting there and Christ is
[1:46:02] outside the door saying, "Hey, I'd like
[1:46:04] to come in and talk for a little bit."
[1:46:08] The Leodysian church is so caught up in
[1:46:11] an echo chamber gospel.
[1:46:14] She's patting herself on the back.
[1:46:16] professing Christians patting each other
[1:46:18] on the back and they're saying, "We've
[1:46:19] got it all. We couldn't be more blessed.
[1:46:23] Ain't God good, brother?"
[1:46:26] Amen. We don't need to check up. We
[1:46:29] don't need to try. We don't need more of
[1:46:31] God. We God all the chosen. We are the
[1:46:33] elect. I'm preaching to us now. Amen.
[1:46:36] Church, are we on cruise control?
[1:46:40] Are we on cruise control?
[1:46:44] We don't have a worry. We don't have a
[1:46:46] concern in the world. We're blessed and
[1:46:47] highly favored. And that's all there is
[1:46:49] to it. Are we on cruise control?
[1:46:53] Here's where we're going to find out.
[1:46:54] Are we wise or foolish? A wise person
[1:46:57] will hear counsel. Here's God's counsel.
[1:46:59] He says, "I counsel. Here's what I
[1:47:01] think. Here's what I'm here's what I'm
[1:47:03] telling you will work." He says, "I
[1:47:04] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:47:07] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[1:47:09] white raignment that thou mayest be
[1:47:10] clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:47:12] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[1:47:15] eyes with eyes that thou mayest see."
[1:47:17] He's saying this is what will fix
[1:47:19] everything I've told you you're dealing
[1:47:21] with. First thing he says, we're not
[1:47:23] going to preach this in detail. We've
[1:47:24] done it before. He says, "I counsel buy
[1:47:27] of me gold tried in the fire." Gold is
[1:47:30] godly character and it only comes by the
[1:47:33] trials and tribulations of a child of
[1:47:36] God. These trials and tribulations,
[1:47:38] church, are literally our overcoming.
[1:47:42] Because to overcome means to stand the
[1:47:44] test. See, we look at overcoming as
[1:47:47] victory. No, it's to stand the test.
[1:47:50] It's to not move when everything's
[1:47:52] trying to make you move off of that
[1:47:53] word. To stand the test. Will we stay
[1:47:56] with the word when times get tough? Will
[1:47:58] we let health, will we let finances,
[1:48:00] will we let relationships hold us back?
[1:48:03] Or will we lay it all down and say,
[1:48:04] "Lord, I'm going to stay with your
[1:48:05] word." That's what it means to overcome,
[1:48:07] to stand the test.
[1:48:09] Remember, God's looking for character.
[1:48:12] Character above all else, not a church
[1:48:14] that's rich in lifestyle and luxury. He
[1:48:17] says, "You got to have white raignment
[1:48:20] that you can be clothed." The problem
[1:48:23] with this church is that she's clothed
[1:48:24] in her own righteousness.
[1:48:26] She says, "I have everything."
[1:48:29] But what is the white raignment of that
[1:48:31] he's talking about? It's the
[1:48:32] righteousness of saints, the scripture
[1:48:34] says. And what is the righteousness of
[1:48:36] saints? It's not my righteousness. It's
[1:48:38] not your righteousness. It's the
[1:48:40] righteousness of Christ. Remember, he
[1:48:41] says, "For him have he made to be sin
[1:48:43] who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:48:45] the righteousness of God in him." The
[1:48:48] righteousness of saints is that Christ
[1:48:50] did it. And so, I'm not coming to him
[1:48:52] with my works. I'm coming to him with my
[1:48:53] faith
[1:48:55] because this church is saying we've got
[1:48:57] it all. This is what they talked about.
[1:48:58] I think it was in Matthew where they
[1:49:00] said, "Hey, we've done all these
[1:49:00] wonderful things in your name." They're
[1:49:02] coming with works. They're coming with
[1:49:04] their own righteousness and that will
[1:49:06] never work. It's got to be Christ and
[1:49:08] him alone. Amen. Satan's queen is
[1:49:11] boastful of herself. We can only boast
[1:49:13] like Paul of Christ. That's our boast is
[1:49:16] Christ always. Then he says the last
[1:49:18] thing you got to have your eyes anointed
[1:49:20] with is. Now notice he doesn't say just
[1:49:23] you have to have droplets placed in your
[1:49:24] eye. He says it's anointed.
[1:49:27] Your eyes have to be anointed. And
[1:49:28] there's only one anointing for the true
[1:49:30] believer and it's the spirit of God.
[1:49:32] It's the Holy Spirit. Amen. We need a
[1:49:34] spiritual revelation by the spirit of
[1:49:36] truth. And the only way you can get it
[1:49:39] is by rejecting everything else that you
[1:49:40] brought to the table so far because it
[1:49:43] ain't right. You think it's right, but
[1:49:45] it's not. You got to bring it subject to
[1:49:47] the word. And it's only by the spirit.
[1:49:50] You can only see the truth by the Holy
[1:49:52] Spirit, church. It's the only way it'll
[1:49:54] work. Remember what Jesus said to
[1:49:55] Nicodemus, except a man be born again,
[1:49:57] he cannot see. He can't understand the
[1:49:59] kingdom of God. The new birth is the
[1:50:00] Holy Spirit. It's not speaking in
[1:50:02] tongues. It's not dancing. It's not
[1:50:03] shouting. It's not even baptism. It's
[1:50:05] the inddwelling spirit of God where we
[1:50:07] become a new creation. And without that
[1:50:10] spirit, we're blind. Which means we
[1:50:12] believe and we don't know. We're
[1:50:14] completely off. And it's the blind
[1:50:16] leading the blind and they're going to
[1:50:17] blind and they're going to fall into the
[1:50:18] ditch eventually. Otherwise, catch this.
[1:50:21] He says, "I'm counseling you. I'm
[1:50:23] telling you, if you're wise, you'll hear
[1:50:24] it." He says, "As many as I love, I
[1:50:28] rebuke and chasen. Be zealous,
[1:50:30] therefore, and repent." Don't just say
[1:50:32] you're sorry.
[1:50:34] Turn around and go 180 degrees. Go
[1:50:36] opposite to what you were doing before.
[1:50:38] Put your faith into action. Take what
[1:50:40] you believe and put it into practice.
[1:50:42] Now, watch his position. He says,
[1:50:44] "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:50:47] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:50:49] door, I will come into him and will s
[1:50:51] with him and he with me." Christ is
[1:50:53] completely outside the church in the
[1:50:55] final church age. They put him out when
[1:50:57] they put the word out. And now he's
[1:50:59] knocking on the doors of those that have
[1:51:01] come out themselves. He's not knocking
[1:51:04] on the doors of the church. He says, "If
[1:51:05] anyone," it's an individual affair. Now,
[1:51:10] we're not getting in because we attend
[1:51:11] this church. We're getting in because he
[1:51:14] knocks on our heart, on our life, and we
[1:51:17] say, "Come on in, Lord." That's the only
[1:51:20] way we're getting in. This is the real
[1:51:22] church now. They have come out of her,
[1:51:24] my people. That was the great shout,
[1:51:27] remember? Come out of her, my people. It
[1:51:29] was a heavenly voice.
[1:51:31] It's a message from heaven. It's the
[1:51:32] spirit talking. Come out of her, my
[1:51:34] people. So, they've come out now as
[1:51:36] individuals. They're the called out, the
[1:51:39] church, the true church. And they've
[1:51:41] come out of every man-made system. Amen.
[1:51:44] And what is it? They are now
[1:51:45] fellowshipping with Christ the word.
[1:51:48] They can't go to church for it. They can
[1:51:51] go to a church, but they can't go to the
[1:51:53] churches. It not there. He's not there.
[1:51:56] They're the ones that are in
[1:51:57] relationship with him. Otherwise, what
[1:52:00] do we have? We have 30,000 churches
[1:52:01] professing Christ and they are
[1:52:03] Christians without Christ.
[1:52:06] That's hard to say. They are Christians
[1:52:09] without Christ. Now remember, there is a
[1:52:11] wise virgin and there is a foolish
[1:52:13] virgin. They're both virgins.
[1:52:18] What's the difference? One has oil. One
[1:52:20] has an anointing. One has the spirit.
[1:52:23] And the other doesn't. She's still
[1:52:25] clean, still sanctified, still keeping
[1:52:29] herself separate, but she has no oil.
[1:52:33] They're Christians without Christ.
[1:52:36] They're Christians by their own works,
[1:52:38] not by the indwelling spirit. Good
[1:52:41] people, sincere people, lovely people,
[1:52:47] but they won't listen. They won't
[1:52:49] listen. They won't take the counsel.
[1:52:52] Amen. Sincere,
[1:52:54] but sincerely wrong. How can you be a
[1:52:56] Christian if Christ isn't in you? How
[1:52:58] can your church be true if Christ is
[1:53:00] outside knocking elsewhere?
[1:53:02] Kabad's written over the door, the glory
[1:53:04] of the Lord has departed. They have the
[1:53:06] name of Christ without the person of
[1:53:08] Christ. Like I said, God has nothing to
[1:53:11] do with this final church in this final
[1:53:12] church age because she's so convinced of
[1:53:14] her rightness, she won't even listen to
[1:53:16] him. She won't listen to his messenger.
[1:53:18] She won't listen to his five-fold
[1:53:20] ministry. She will only listen to
[1:53:22] herself. And she becomes a victim of her
[1:53:24] own ministry.
[1:53:28] I want to finish on a high note.
[1:53:31] Everyone smiled. Everyone's smiling.
[1:53:34] Yes, it's over. We made it through.
[1:53:38] We're still believers. He didn't put me
[1:53:40] out. Am I on the list?
[1:53:44] Right. I want to go out on a high note
[1:53:48] because this is our part that we're
[1:53:49] coming to now. If we'll listen to the
[1:53:51] counsel that was just given because I'll
[1:53:53] tell you, church, the spirit of this age
[1:53:55] is lukewarmness.
[1:53:57] It's lukewarmness. I have enough to get
[1:54:00] by.
[1:54:03] But do you have enough to overcome?
[1:54:06] It's not survival, church. It's victory.
[1:54:09] It's victory. Not survival. Not can I
[1:54:12] make it through the day. It's can I
[1:54:14] overcome today. Amen. Listen to this.
[1:54:21] This is the people that won't put God in
[1:54:22] a box, that won't put a period after
[1:54:25] what they believe. church, I can say
[1:54:27] honestly before you, I have had to
[1:54:29] change what I have believed throughout
[1:54:30] my life. I've had to grow in my maturity
[1:54:33] in the word of God. Absolutely. And I
[1:54:35] think we'd be a liar to say anything
[1:54:37] different. We've had to grow. We've had
[1:54:38] to learn in Christ. We can't put a
[1:54:40] period behind it. This is to those that
[1:54:43] won't do that. He says, "To him that
[1:54:45] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[1:54:47] in my throne, even as I also overcame
[1:54:50] and am set down with my father in his
[1:54:53] throne." This is the reward to the
[1:54:55] overcomer. Now he says, "How are you
[1:54:57] going to get it? How you going to
[1:54:59] overcome?" He says, "He that hath an
[1:55:01] ear, let him
[1:55:04] hear, not speak here." You got to
[1:55:08] listen. You got to shut up.
[1:55:11] You got to recognize my speaking didn't
[1:55:14] get me where I needed to. I need to
[1:55:16] listen to the spirit. He that hath an
[1:55:18] ear, let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:55:21] unto the churches. Now, I want you to
[1:55:23] notice something here as we start to
[1:55:24] close. There's only a prize if there's a
[1:55:28] winner.
[1:55:30] Now, you have to realize something. See,
[1:55:31] too many people believe that what
[1:55:33] happens is things happen and then God
[1:55:36] kind of works his way through things
[1:55:37] that are happening to achieve a goal.
[1:55:40] That's not the way it works. God, the
[1:55:42] scripture says, knows the end from the
[1:55:44] beginning. He thinks, he speaks, and
[1:55:48] then it happens. So God is moving all of
[1:55:52] this to produce his word. God's not
[1:55:55] reactive. God's creative. And so from
[1:55:59] the beginning, he has created things to
[1:56:01] go a certain way. That's why we can take
[1:56:03] Romans 8:28 and say, "All things work
[1:56:06] together for good." Why? Because from
[1:56:08] the beginning to the end, it's all him
[1:56:10] working. God's not sitting there and
[1:56:12] saying, "Oh my goodness, they backslid.
[1:56:14] I better respond. Oh, oh, look at the
[1:56:15] way the politics have shifted. I didn't
[1:56:17] see that coming. I've got to do this."
[1:56:18] No, no, no. God has seen it all. God has
[1:56:21] ordained it all. God has allowed it all.
[1:56:23] And God has checks and balances and a
[1:56:25] way through all of it by his word. God's
[1:56:28] not reacting to these things. Amen. He's
[1:56:30] creative. So when he says to him that
[1:56:32] overcomemeth, it's because there's an
[1:56:34] overcomer.
[1:56:37] This isn't like I better have a prize
[1:56:39] just in case one person makes it over
[1:56:41] the line. He's got a what? He's got a
[1:56:43] prize. He's got a reward because there's
[1:56:46] people that are ordained to overcome.
[1:56:49] Okay? Now, I want you to consider this.
[1:56:51] Overcoming is not just staying out of
[1:56:53] the world and the things of the world.
[1:56:55] Okay? Get that out of your head. That's
[1:56:57] a portion of it. That's the effect of it
[1:57:01] to a degree. But I can take you to many
[1:57:03] churches where there are people that
[1:57:07] have not the spirit and yet they are
[1:57:09] separate from the world and the things
[1:57:10] of the world. Absolutely 100%. There are
[1:57:13] wonderful Pentecostal people that have
[1:57:16] holiness nailed down, that don't go to
[1:57:19] movie theaters, that dress right, that
[1:57:21] talk right,
[1:57:23] listen to the good things. They are
[1:57:25] people that are separated from the
[1:57:28] world. They're virgins.
[1:57:31] Okay? The test is not are you a virgin,
[1:57:33] it's are you a wise virgin. Okay? Catch
[1:57:36] that. Okay?
[1:57:38] because we have people that are modest
[1:57:40] and humble and even holy if we put it
[1:57:43] that way. But there's a wise virgin that
[1:57:46] has the spirit that can listen to the
[1:57:48] counsel of God. Okay? The scripture
[1:57:52] says, "The bride hath made herself
[1:57:54] ready." What she has listened, she has
[1:57:57] obeyed, and she has put into action what
[1:57:59] the spirit is saying. She's received the
[1:58:01] spirit. She's received the word. The two
[1:58:04] come together and it produces exactly
[1:58:06] what it's supposed to. Bible overcoming
[1:58:09] is not just to be separate from the
[1:58:10] world. Bible overcoming is to stay with
[1:58:13] the word and not be deceived by those
[1:58:15] that try and manipulate it. Amen. It's
[1:58:18] not it's staying away from deception
[1:58:20] that's built into the word by false
[1:58:23] teachers and preachers. Amen. The battle
[1:58:25] is not can Satan make you do bad things.
[1:58:29] Anybody done any bad things this week?
[1:58:30] Don't show hands. I'll show mine. it.
[1:58:32] Anybody do anything that they know
[1:58:34] disappointed themselves, much less God.
[1:58:37] Okay. My wife and I both did pray for
[1:58:39] us. And Sister Moren, she raised both
[1:58:41] hands. It was a good trip.
[1:58:48] The goal of Satan is not to get you to
[1:58:52] do bad things. The goal is to separate
[1:58:54] you from the word.
[1:58:57] Because we all do bad things.
[1:59:00] We all do bad things.
[1:59:01] We're going to keep doing bad things
[1:59:03] until we get out of here because we are
[1:59:05] in fallen flesh. And until that flesh is
[1:59:08] changed, no matter how much our soul,
[1:59:09] our spirit, our heart is changed and
[1:59:11] sealed, this flesh will always do things
[1:59:14] that it ought not to do. And that's just
[1:59:16] the sad truth of it. Amen. But what he
[1:59:19] can do is if he can get us away from the
[1:59:22] word,
[1:59:23] then he's got us beat because that's our
[1:59:26] overcoming. That's our sword. That's our
[1:59:28] shield. It's our buckler. All of these
[1:59:29] things. But the criteria here is what?
[1:59:32] Who is the overcomer? He that hears what
[1:59:35] the spirit says and he yields himself or
[1:59:37] herself to it. Listen church. David, a
[1:59:41] man after God's own heart, fornicated
[1:59:43] and murdered.
[1:59:46] A man after God's own heart. His flesh
[1:59:49] got the better of him. But guess what?
[1:59:51] When the word came, he said, "You're
[1:59:54] right." He repented.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; He did what he could to make it right.
[2:00:00] And then what did he do? He moved on.
[2:00:03] Elijah was a man subject to like
[2:00:05] passions just as we are. It's not about
[2:00:08] sinless perfection. It's about will you
[2:00:10] stay with the word of God and come back
[2:00:12] to it when you make your mistakes. Will
[2:00:15] you repent, acknowledge it, and come
[2:00:18] back? Yield yourself back to the word of
[2:00:21] God. That's the criteria. The overcomer
[2:00:23] is he that hears what the spirit is
[2:00:26] saying.
[2:00:27] That'll take you in there. Listen to
[2:00:29] this as we're closing.
[2:00:31] So many say, "If the Lord will take this
[2:00:33] evil spirit from me from drinking or
[2:00:35] gambling or from lying or for stealing,
[2:00:37] I'll serve him." He says, "But that's up
[2:00:40] to you." See, you have to do something,
[2:00:42] too. They that overcome shall inherit
[2:00:45] all things. They that overcome, he says,
[2:00:47] you have power to do it. You have power
[2:00:50] to overcome, but you must be willing to
[2:00:52] lay it down. What? That habit down.
[2:00:56] Overcome has to start with the desire.
[2:01:00] Why is God going to take away your your
[2:01:01] your your lusting for pornography if you
[2:01:04] want it?
[2:01:06] What's the point? You want it. You got
[2:01:08] to say, "Lord, I don't want it. Lord,
[2:01:10] I'm wasting too much time on screens
[2:01:12] every day. I want to get rid of it.
[2:01:13] Church, he can do it." He can do it.
[2:01:17] Lord, I'm wasting too much time every
[2:01:19] day. Boy, have I ever had to talk to him
[2:01:21] about that since I became a a pastor.
[2:01:25] Lord, I can't let my time slip away
[2:01:27] doing silly things. I've got too much
[2:01:29] that needs my attention for me to be
[2:01:31] frittering away my time.
[2:01:34] I'm being honest this morning. God's had
[2:01:36] to deal with me. Son, you got to do
[2:01:39] better. But it's got to start with a
[2:01:41] desire. It's got to start with a desire.
[2:01:43] And everyone's saying, "God, do it. God,
[2:01:45] do it. God, do it." God says, "Listen, I
[2:01:47] can give you the overcoming power, but
[2:01:49] you got to want the overcoming power.
[2:01:51] You got to want to overcome.
[2:01:54] You got to want to fight.
[2:01:57] You got to want to push. You got to want
[2:01:59] to press. You got to come off cruise
[2:02:01] control, brother, sister. He says, you
[2:02:03] see, God cannot push us through a little
[2:02:05] pipe, pull us out the other end, and
[2:02:07] then say, "Blessed is he that
[2:02:09] overcomemeth."
[2:02:11] Isn't that the truth?
[2:02:13] He says, "You had nothing to overcome.
[2:02:16] He just pushed you through." He says,
[2:02:18] "But you've got to make decisions for
[2:02:20] yourself. I have to make decisions for
[2:02:23] myself. He says, "And in doing that, we
[2:02:25] show our faith and respects to God." And
[2:02:29] God bless you. Let's stand.
[2:02:32] What I want you to see here
[2:02:34] is that when you're in this position,
[2:02:37] that's when you're in the overcomer's
[2:02:39] position. Notice he said, "I'll grant
[2:02:41] you to sit in my throne even as I sat on
[2:02:44] my father's throne." Now, a throne is
[2:02:46] always a dominion. Amen. It's a place of
[2:02:48] do dominion or domain. And the scripture
[2:02:51] here is not just talking about a
[2:02:53] heavenly throne
[2:02:54] because the way it works, see, is we get
[2:02:56] a spiritual event or experience here
[2:02:59] that becomes a physical experience or
[2:03:01] event later. See, we get a throne here
[2:03:03] and then we get a throne there because
[2:03:04] there's going to be a day where the
[2:03:05] bride rules and reigns with Christ in
[2:03:07] the millennium with a rod of iron. We're
[2:03:09] going to sit in his throne with him and
[2:03:10] we're going to rule and reign with him.
[2:03:12] But there's a ruling and reigning now
[2:03:14] because to overcome means to have
[2:03:16] dominion. So, there's a throne that
[2:03:19] you're sitting in. And what's he saying?
[2:03:20] He's saying, listen, you've got to
[2:03:22] overcome as I overcame. How did Christ
[2:03:25] overcome, church?
[2:03:27] Filled with the spirit and submitted
[2:03:28] himself to the will of the father. And
[2:03:30] he's saying, if you will receive the
[2:03:32] spirit, it'll give you the same throne,
[2:03:34] the same dominion that I had. Because
[2:03:36] remember when Jesus stood before Pilate,
[2:03:38] he says, listen, you have no control
[2:03:39] over me. He says, I've got dominion over
[2:03:42] myself. The only way you have dominion
[2:03:43] is if it's given to you of my father.
[2:03:47] So your dominion today is not to go
[2:03:49] around and speak things into existence.
[2:03:52] Your dominion is the powers over sin in
[2:03:55] your own life. You got a spirit of God
[2:03:58] that's available today to give you
[2:04:02] overcoming power over that.
[2:04:05] Because I remember talking with brother
[2:04:06] Kingsley one time. I hope it's okay to
[2:04:08] say this, brother Kingsley. He was
[2:04:10] saying one thing he noticed when he was
[2:04:12] in Nigeria. people, these ministers with
[2:04:14] great gifts, prophecy, insight,
[2:04:16] discernment, all these things. He said,
[2:04:18] "But what I noticed is the people that
[2:04:19] went in were the same people that came
[2:04:21] out and there was no overcoming. There
[2:04:23] was no change."
[2:04:26] Why? Because the power was all in that
[2:04:28] man, and it wasn't in them. See, we're
[2:04:31] looking for God to do everything out
[2:04:33] there, but the throne that he wants to
[2:04:35] sit on is the throne of our heart and
[2:04:37] give dominion over sin. And that's by
[2:04:39] the that's only by the indwelling power
[2:04:41] of the spirit of God.
[2:04:42] He says, "You've got to want to let that
[2:04:44] power have dominion so that you can take
[2:04:46] dominion."
[2:04:48] You want to control sin, you've got to
[2:04:50] take in the power that can control sin,
[2:04:51] and that's only the spirit of God.
[2:04:54] You want to rule and reign, rule and
[2:04:56] reign over what you have control of
[2:04:58] right now, over what belongs to you. And
[2:05:01] if you'll do that, maybe I'll add too.
[2:05:03] I'll take you into adoption. I'll give
[2:05:05] you something to work with everyone
[2:05:06] else. I'll give you a ministry. I'll
[2:05:08] give you a gift. But first, you got to
[2:05:10] have that throne established in your
[2:05:11] heart where there is dominion over
[2:05:14] the world, Satan, sin, where character
[2:05:19] shines through in times of testing.
[2:05:22] And then that's when we can say, "I've
[2:05:24] overcome."
[2:05:25] That's the overcoming, church. He's
[2:05:27] coming for a bride that has overcome
[2:05:29] self. That's what character is. You've
[2:05:30] overcome self. You move from death into
[2:05:33] life. You're not bound now by what's
[2:05:35] good for this flesh. You're bound by
[2:05:36] what the word tells you to do. That's
[2:05:38] what godly character looks like. How are
[2:05:41] we going to get there? How are we going
[2:05:42] to overcome? He says, "He that hath an
[2:05:43] ear, let him hear." We have to act. That
[2:05:47] word hear doesn't mean listen. It means
[2:05:49] to hear it and understand it and put it
[2:05:52] into action. How do you overcome? You
[2:05:55] hear the word. You say, "Lord, that's
[2:05:57] for me. I want that." And then we'll lay
[2:05:59] down everything else that would hinder
[2:06:02] or hold us back or rise up against that
[2:06:04] word. That's why he says you got to want
[2:06:07] it. You got to be willing to lay down
[2:06:09] that hindrance. You got to be willing to
[2:06:11] lay down that practice, that habit,
[2:06:13] whatever it might be and say, "Lord, I'm
[2:06:16] laying it down cuz I want what you have
[2:06:17] for me." And that's the most important
[2:06:19] thing. That's what repentance looks
[2:06:21] like. Laying down and walking away.
[2:06:24] That's putting that's that's your fruits
[2:06:26] that are meat for repentance that show
[2:06:28] real repentance. How do we get it? Hear
[2:06:31] what the spirit is saying to the church.
[2:06:34] Amen. God bless you. It's over. We'll go
[2:06:38] back to absolute power next. We can have
[2:06:40] a hoop and holler in time, Brother
[2:06:41] Grant. Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[2:06:45] Heavenly Father,
[2:06:48] Lord, I believe the cry of our hearts
[2:06:50] this morning, Lord, as we want victory,
[2:06:53] Lord, we want overcoming power. Lord, we
[2:06:56] want to be able to say that Satan has no
[2:06:58] room, no place, no power, no influence,
[2:07:03] Lord, in our lives,
[2:07:05] Lord. And you've given us a way to get
[2:07:07] through it. You've given us a way to
[2:07:08] overcome self, Lord. And it's by dying
[2:07:11] out and letting your spirit take full
[2:07:13] control in our lives, Lord. It's about
[2:07:15] submitting ourselves to your word, Lord.
[2:07:17] It's about feeding on your word. It's
[2:07:19] about wrapping ourselves in your
[2:07:21] righteousness, Lord. And it's about
[2:07:23] letting your spirit open our eyes to the
[2:07:25] truth. that's made for this hour.
[2:07:28] Lord, I pray, Lord, you'd help us to see
[2:07:31] every hindrance that's rising up. Lord,
[2:07:34] every bit of friction that Satan's
[2:07:35] trying to add into our lives to slow
[2:07:37] down your move, Lord. I pray you'd help
[2:07:40] us to see we've got decisions to make,
[2:07:43] Lord. We've got roads to choose, ways to
[2:07:46] go, Lord. And we need to choose it based
[2:07:48] on what your spirit's telling us. Not
[2:07:50] just gut feel, Lord. Not just by feeling
[2:07:52] or emotion,
[2:07:54] Lord. But we've got to choose it
[2:07:55] according to your will and your way.
[2:07:57] Lord, I pray you help us to seek it,
[2:07:59] Lord. Because you said if we seek, we'll
[2:08:01] find. If we'll knock, you'll open. Lord,
[2:08:03] you're looking for a people that want
[2:08:04] it. Lord, I believe we're that people.
[2:08:07] But I pray you help us to act like it
[2:08:09] every day, Lord. Let your spirit have
[2:08:10] full control.
[2:08:12] Lord, we ask you these things.
[2:08:14] committing ourselves, Lord, praying for
[2:08:16] those that are sick especially or Jensen
[2:08:19] home today. Praying you just raise them
[2:08:20] up, heavenly father. Lord, each one you
[2:08:22] know where they are, what they're doing,
[2:08:24] Lord. I pray your spirit would touch
[2:08:25] them. We pray, Lord, remembering
[2:08:27] Cherylyn Piery also, Lord God. Lord,
[2:08:30] your mercy and grace to her in her
[2:08:31] condition. Lord, that for your glory,
[2:08:34] you grant her a revelation, Lord, that
[2:08:36] divine healing is for her. In Jesus
[2:08:38] Christ's name, we're asking it. Amen.
[2:08:42] Amen.
[2:08:45] I know we sang this not too long ago,
[2:08:47] but can we sing more of you? 7:59.
[2:08:50] Like I said earlier, are we asking for
[2:08:52] more of him or more for me?
[2:08:55] It's so easy to tie our relationship
[2:08:57] with God to the blessings he gives us.
[2:09:00] But Job said, "Though he slay me, yet
[2:09:02] I'll trust him." Amen. Our our claim to
[2:09:05] blessing is not what we have.
[2:09:09] It's the word that he gives us that he
[2:09:11] makes a reality in our lives. Amen. So I
[2:09:14] pray we can sing this this morning with
[2:09:15] a real sincerity and say, "Lord, I want
[2:09:18] more of you." And that first Pentecostal
[2:09:21] church, the true Pentecostal church
[2:09:22] could say, "Lord, we need more of you."
[2:09:24] Church, we're not out of here yet. I say
[2:09:26] we need more of him this morning. Amen.
[2:09:28] We need more of his presence, more of
[2:09:30] his spirit, more of his word, more of
[2:09:31] his revelation. And I remember I
[2:09:34] remember talking to brother Garfield a
[2:09:37] year or two ago and we were talking
[2:09:40] about how far we need to move forward. I
[2:09:43] said, "Brother Garfield, what do you
[2:09:44] think we're lacking?" He says, "Is it I
[2:09:47] said, "Is it the spirit or the word?" He
[2:09:48] says, "All the spirit's there. We need a
[2:09:50] greater revelation of his word. The
[2:09:52] spirit's there to bless it, to make it a
[2:09:53] reality, but we need more of his word."
[2:09:55] Amen. The spirit's here to quicken it,
[2:09:57] but we've got to get into it. We got to
[2:09:58] say, "Lord, make your word live in my
[2:10:00] life." Amen. I want to get ahead. I want
[2:10:02] to become what this word's talking
[2:10:04] about. And it can only come with a
[2:10:05] heart's cry for Lord, I want more of
[2:10:07] you. Amen. Let's sing this together.
[2:10:12] Oh, more of you.
[2:10:17] [Music]
[2:10:20] More of you.
[2:10:26] Oh, I've had it all.
[2:10:31] What I need is more of you.
[2:10:40] Of things I've had my fill,
[2:10:47] of yet I hunger
[2:10:52] still.
[2:10:55] Oh, empty and bare.
[2:10:59] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[2:11:08] And I need more of you.
[2:11:16] More of you.
[2:11:23] Oh, I've had it all.
[2:11:28] What I need is more of you.
[2:11:37] Of things I've had my fill,
[2:11:44] but yet I hunger
[2:11:48] still.
[2:11:51] Oh, empty and bare.
[2:11:55] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[2:12:05] Give me more of you.
[2:12:13] More
[2:12:14] of you.
[2:12:17] [Music]
[2:12:20] I've had it all.
[2:12:24] of what I need is more of you.
[2:12:33] Of things I've had my fill,
[2:12:40] but yet I hunger
[2:12:45] still
[2:12:49] empty and bare.
[2:12:52] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[2:13:00] Pour your spirit out on me. 12:21,
[2:13:03] [Music]
[2:13:09] Lord. I seek you.
[2:13:13] Help me find you.
[2:13:17] How I need your touch. touch.
[2:13:26] Find my dry and
[2:13:30] broken places.
[2:13:33] I'm thirsty for your love.
[2:13:41] Lord, forgive me
[2:13:46] if I wandered
[2:13:49] far away from you.
[2:13:57] You are all I
[2:14:02] ever needed.
[2:14:06] Come and make me new.
[2:14:11] and pour your spirit out on me.
[2:14:17] Fall just like the rain.
[2:14:22] Saturate
[2:14:24] my thirsty soul.
[2:14:28] Come and fall aresh on me.
[2:14:33] Fill my cup again.
[2:14:38] Heal my heart
[2:14:40] and make me whole.
[2:14:46] I need you now.
[2:14:49] Pour your spirit
[2:14:52] out.
[2:14:57] Lord, I seek you.
[2:15:01] Help me find you.
[2:15:13] Find my tri
[2:15:17] broken places
[2:15:21] thirsting for your love.
[2:15:29] Lord, forgive me
[2:15:33] where I wondered.
[2:15:37] Far away from you.
[2:15:44] For you are all I
[2:15:49] ever needed.
[2:15:53] Come and make me new.
[2:15:58] Pour your spirit out on me.
[2:16:04] All just like the rain.
[2:16:08] Saturate
[2:16:11] my thirsty soul.
[2:16:14] Come and fall aresh on me.

[2:16:38] out and pour your spirit out on me.
[2:16:45] Fall just like the rain.
[2:16:50] saturate
[2:16:52] my thirsty soul.
[2:16:56] Come and fall aresh on me.
[2:17:00] Fill my cup again.
[2:17:05] Heal my heart
[2:17:08] and make me whole.
[2:17:13] I need you now
[2:17:17] pour your spirit
[2:17:20] out.
[2:17:22] My hope 1088.
[2:17:27] I stand in all within the presence of
[2:17:33] the Lord.
[2:17:36] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[2:17:41] lies.
[2:17:44] For whom the raging of the sea
[2:17:49] subides.
[2:17:52] The living sacrifice.
[2:17:56] The only source
[2:17:59] of life,
[2:18:01] my hope
[2:18:04] is in the Lord.
[2:18:08] From this time on
[2:18:12] and ever more.
[2:18:16] Oh my hope
[2:18:20] is in the Lord
[2:18:24] forever more.
[2:18:28] His tender mercies come with every
[2:18:33] rising sun
[2:18:36] to meet the sinner in his brokenness.
[2:18:44] You offer healing and forgiveness.
[2:18:52] And those who trust in him will find
[2:18:57] their hearts
[2:18:59] at rest.
[2:19:01] My hope
[2:19:04] is in the Lord
[2:19:08] from this time on
[2:19:12] and ever more.
[2:19:16] Oh my hope
[2:19:20] is in the Lord
[2:19:24] forever more.
[2:19:28] His tender mercies come with every
[2:19:33] rising sun
[2:19:36] to meet the sinner in his brokenness
[2:19:44] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[2:19:52] And those who trust, hallelujah, will
[2:19:56] find their hearts

[2:20:23] forever more.
[2:20:28] My hope
[2:20:31] is in the Lord
[2:20:35] from this time on
[2:20:39] and ever more.
[2:20:42] Oh my hope
[2:20:47] is in the Lord
[2:20:51] forever more.
[2:20:55] My hope
[2:20:59] is in the Lord
[2:21:03] from this time on
[2:21:07] and ever more.
[2:21:11] Oh my hope
[2:21:16] is in the Lord
[2:21:21] forever
[2:21:23] more.
[2:21:26] Amen. God bless you. We're going to sing
[2:21:30] that song, Breathe, as we start to
[2:21:32] close. Brother Kingsley, I'm going to
[2:21:34] ask you to close in prayer when we're
[2:21:35] done singing this. Man, remember the
[2:21:37] needs. Remember each other.
[2:21:41] Amen.
[2:21:43] Let's get closer to God.
[2:21:46] Amen. Let's give him the time that he
[2:21:47] deserves.
[2:21:50] Let's make him the priority in our lives
[2:21:51] day by day. Now give him what's left
[2:21:54] over. Let's give him what we have. Fit
[2:21:57] everything else into what's left over.
[2:21:58] Amen.
[2:22:00] Amen. Let's sing this together.
[2:22:04] [Music]
[2:22:07] This is the air I breathe.
[2:22:16] This is the air I breathe.
[2:22:22] Your holy
[2:22:25] presence
[2:22:29] living
[2:22:32] in me.
[2:22:39] This is my daily bread.
[2:22:47] This is my daily bread.
[2:22:53] Your very
[2:22:56] word
[2:23:00] spoken
[2:23:03] to me
[2:23:07] and I
[2:23:09] [Music]
[2:23:14] I'm desperate for you.
[2:23:22] And I
[2:23:25] [Music]

[2:26:49] Amen.
[2:26:52] in Jesus name.
[2:26:56] Our heavenly father, we thank you for
[2:26:58] the word that we have received today.
[2:27:02] We thank you for your word that is
[2:27:03] unchanging.
[2:27:06] Though our hearts sometimes may struggle
[2:27:09] to accept the reality of what your word
[2:27:11] is. Sometimes it's difficult for our
[2:27:14] hearts to accept the truth in your word
[2:27:18] because we've been used to lies and
[2:27:20] deceit
[2:27:22] because we have done things in ways that
[2:27:24] we thought were right because of our
[2:27:26] sincerity,
[2:27:29] our intentions.
[2:27:31] We have forsaken your words and your
[2:27:33] ways. We've been disobedient in many
[2:27:36] ways. For this we ask you, oh Lord, that
[2:27:38] you forgive us, that you cleanse our
[2:27:41] hearts from every darkness from every
[2:27:45] correctness in in our
[2:27:47] self-righteousness,
[2:27:49] from every views that we have, from the
[2:27:52] desires to be right, to keep things as
[2:27:54] they are instead of asking you for your
[2:27:58] for direction. We thank you for using
[2:28:02] your vessel, the pastor, to open our
[2:28:05] eyes to the reality of your word and to
[2:28:08] call us back in alignment to your word.
[2:28:11] We thank you Lord for you have been
[2:28:13] building upon us line upon line, present
[2:28:16] upon present, improving us daily as we
[2:28:20] continue to walk with you in faith in
[2:28:23] hope strongly holding on to your word
[2:28:25] and your will doing things as you have
[2:28:28] led us and you have directed us.
[2:28:30] continue to build that perfection in us,
[2:28:33] building us greater and greater to where
[2:28:35] you want us to be. That our lives will
[2:28:37] continue to be a ministry as we live it
[2:28:40] day by day. That people will watch and
[2:28:42] see and glorify the glory of your name
[2:28:45] and be lifted
[2:28:48] and be redeemed and be saved. Let our
[2:28:51] lives continue be a testimony in our
[2:28:54] workplace, in our homes, on the
[2:28:56] community, in the church, wherever we
[2:28:58] find ourselves. Help us to be that
[2:29:01] testimony that you have created us to
[2:29:04] be.
[2:29:05] Father, we pray for those that are not
[2:29:07] in church today. We ask that your mighty
[2:29:10] hands continue to be upon them, that
[2:29:12] your light continue to shine upon them
[2:29:15] and guide them, Lord. And for those that
[2:29:17] are feeling too well, Lord, we know that
[2:29:20] you are the healer. By your stripes,
[2:29:22] they are healed. And we know trouble and
[2:29:25] sickness may disturb us for the night
[2:29:27] but every morning there is joy. We thank
[2:29:30] you Lord for their day has become for
[2:29:32] their life is now day and their joy has
[2:29:35] been speaking for them. Thank you for
[2:29:37] the healing that is going on in the
[2:29:39] church and amongst everyone. Father I
[2:29:41] also pray strongly for the heart desires
[2:29:44] of everyone in church and not in church
[2:29:46] today. You know our individual heart
[2:29:48] desires. Lord, grant us these
[2:29:50] testimonies and grant us this heart
[2:29:53] desire that we
[2:29:55] will continue to see you in the light of
[2:29:58] who you are even when you do and do not
[2:30:00] do for of what we want. But we do ask
[2:30:03] you, oh Lord,
[2:30:06] that you show us mercy
[2:30:08] and you show us love like you always do.
[2:30:12] We thank you for the week that is
[2:30:14] already blessed. Having heard this word,
[2:30:16] we know our week is blessed. We thank
[2:30:18] you for giving us a blessed week and a
[2:30:21] blessed rest of the month and year to
[2:30:24] all your to all all of these would be
[2:30:27] only for your glory Lord and we take no
[2:30:29] pride in any of it. Continue to take all
[2:30:32] the glory Lord in Jesus heavenly name we
[2:30:35] pray and trust says amen.
[2:30:42] [Music]
[2:31:58] Hallelujah.
[2:32:38] Oh,
[2:32:46] hey.

[2:36:46] that I
