[43:19] [Music]
[43:25] that's right amen and we thank God for
[43:35] grace or those that have been affected
[43:37] by the wind and rainstorm in the Bahamas
[43:40] and eastern United States
[43:42] Lanta Canada so we thank God for His
[43:45] grace to us a man in preserving us from
[43:49] it but we pray grace to those that have
[43:51] been afflicted affected by it
[43:53] and remembering of course the Saints
[43:55] down down through the United States and
[43:58] into the Bahamas and also to remember
[44:02] our brother George Smith it was supposed
[44:04] to be ministry in Fredericton today and
[44:07] of course they were also touched with
[44:09] the storm so he pray grace to our
[44:11] brother George
[44:12] amen and as he ministers again this
[44:16] morning I would assume also this evening
[44:18] so god bless them as they gather
[44:21] trusting God's grace and they'll be
[44:23] gathered together for the hearing of the
[44:26] word a man and also of course too we
[44:30] must consider these things not just
[44:32] thinking no this is just something that
[44:35] happened but believing that it's a sign
[44:37] of the end when it comes to these storms
[44:40] and all of us taking place a man as it
[44:43] was in the days of Noah as it was in the
[44:45] days of Sodom and Gomorrah as it was in
[44:48] those days brother sister when when they
[44:51] were experiencing the judgment of God a
[44:53] man and hunter this that the world's
[44:56] experiencing God's judgment even now and
[44:58] as I've said before a number of times
[45:01] that I can see the fires falling amen
[45:05] the fire of judgment is falling the fire
[45:08] of God's wrath is falling upon a world a
[45:11] man that has turned him down upon a
[45:13] world that has rejected God and the more
[45:15] caught up with themselves than they are
[45:17] the Lord the more cut out with man and
[45:20] politics and and yes and even religion
[45:23] more they're caught up more with that
[45:24] than they are with this right here
[45:27] man the Word of God it's the truth
[45:29] brother it's the word of the church but
[45:31] they're not considering the Word of God
[45:33] so grace to me grace to you help us to
[45:36] focus more and more on the word because
[45:39] whatever is whatever is happening in the
[45:42] world today no matter where it's
[45:44] happening
[45:44] it's brother it's got to be prophecy
[45:46] fulfilled amen and the Bible says when
[45:49] you see this when you see this they see
[45:51] this he says look up he because your
[45:54] Redemption draws nigh and many are
[45:55] looking up amen most are still looking
[45:58] at out there they're looking right there
[46:00] oh this is happening that's happening
[46:02] yell but let's look at the word and have
[46:04] yet you see it in the word you're gonna
[46:06] look up because you know it's the end
[46:07] amen than it is the end of all things
[46:10] so the grace of God be with us don't
[46:13] it's going to have the desired effect
[46:16] God's effect on us and on you and me
[46:19] Amen brothers sister but again if it's
[46:22] good if what's going on in the world
[46:24] it's going to have the desired effect on
[46:26] us what God wants to have on us with
[46:28] there is a certain thing that we've got
[46:31] to have a man and we're going to get
[46:33] into that as we go into the word again
[46:35] and back to the message I have heard but
[46:37] now I see because there's a couple of
[46:40] things there that brother Bama is
[46:41] highlighted and not just as I preached
[46:44] on it hearing the way God hears it
[46:46] seeing the way God sees it or hearing
[46:48] the way God wants you to hear it are
[46:50] seeing the way God wants you to see it
[46:52] but whether barrel highlights there's
[46:54] another there's another thing that God
[46:57] is looking for in you and in me a man so
[47:01] I pray God brother brother we got to
[47:03] have it and the probability of
[47:04] highlighting this yeah he because why
[47:07] because he knew that the people who was
[47:09] ministering to never had it a man and he
[47:13] brings out this and he brings out that I
[47:15] wonder I like that there's a certain
[47:16] situation there and and they all they
[47:19] just didn't do it when God wanted him to
[47:21] do it and then and they thought old
[47:23] world brother bit him I want you to do
[47:24] this no no no he said I'm not gonna do
[47:26] that he said God has already told me
[47:29] I've already told you but he says you
[47:31] didn't act on it a man when you should
[47:33] have acted on it you didn't do this when
[47:35] you should have done it he says so he
[47:38] said I'm not going to ask God about it
[47:39] no more
[47:40] and he said I'm certainly not interested
[47:42] in it but but they were interested but
[47:45] again we'll get into it what was their
[47:47] motive and what was their objective and
[47:49] what is your motive and what is your
[47:51] objective for being here today a man
[47:54] what is your motive an objective for
[47:56] saying I believe the message so the
[47:58] father of God highlights the wrong
[48:00] motive and the wrong objective or
[48:02] they're lacking the right motive and the
[48:05] right objective a man so brothers and
[48:08] any and if there's anything that he
[48:10] brings out in that message is anything
[48:12] we ought to catch in that message is
[48:13] that revelation is my motive rate is my
[48:17] objective rate a man it's got to be for
[48:20] the glory of God a man not just for
[48:23] Aaron's selfish benefits but it's for
[48:26] the glory of God a man because the
[48:29] Prophet I brings out some things there
[48:31] and he said all they want God to do this
[48:33] for and all they wanted that for there's
[48:35] a certain blessing that the Prophet said
[48:37] go and he said and do this and look for
[48:39] this and then there's a blessing there
[48:41] but they did they waited for their time
[48:43] a man and they lost it a man they come
[48:47] back to the Prophet to do this to do
[48:49] that no he said I'm not going to do it
[48:50] he said I told yes he's her brother
[48:52] round you did but he said we didn't do
[48:54] it he said when when when you want us to
[48:56] do it and so they lost it
[48:59] oh yeah a tremendous blessing but they
[49:02] lost it and the people of the world got
[49:05] it oh yeah because they acted when the
[49:08] believer refused to act a man so I'll
[49:11] show you those things shortly a man
[49:13] though the grace of God be with us
[49:15] brother it is serious this is this is
[49:19] more serious than just just religion
[49:21] this is more serious than just oh
[49:22] goddess and a prophet but brother some
[49:25] probably brings that again in the
[49:26] message he said God does this and God
[49:28] does that he said to test you and he
[49:31] said bring her what she knew he made and
[49:34] he bring out the true anointing and true
[49:36] bird spiritus in the bright but he bring
[49:39] out the false anointing that's in the
[49:41] it's in the make believer and he warns
[49:43] us again and he did he did that in the
[49:45] message on lean not to your own
[49:47] understanding on Wednesday what that
[49:50] there's three kinds of believers which
[49:52] one
[49:52] you a man and it's like a Hindley like I
[49:56] told you about the brother that that he
[49:57] mailed me one time and says look he said
[49:59] sir
[49:59] he said I read the Bible three times and
[50:02] he said I find so many mistakes on it he
[50:04] said I don't believe it
[50:05] so he said I don't believe in this I
[50:08] don't believe in that and and so on and
[50:10] I say brother you failed I said to
[50:12] understand that God wrote the Bible in
[50:15] the way that he wrote it for a reason
[50:17] amen why I sister bring out I said the
[50:20] true believer
[50:22] bring out the mate believer and the make
[50:24] make manifest the unbeliever and I said
[50:27] I said which one are you
[50:29] I said you're you're one of them and
[50:31] they never come back but I trust by the
[50:34] grace of God he went back to the word a
[50:36] man so brother sister see God is testing
[50:39] you so what we and all that we have gone
[50:41] through in the last number of years
[50:43] what has God brought it in you a man
[50:46] what is God made manifest in you what
[50:48] has God seen in you and seen in me a man
[50:52] so I pray the grace of God we're gonna
[50:54] see whether the Prophet is emphasizing
[50:56] in the message I have heard but now I
[50:58] see so I trust a garlic God hears us a
[51:02] man and God sees us a man as sons and
[51:05] daughters of God a man not as religious
[51:08] people but as these sons and daughters a
[51:10] man that he knew before the foundation
[51:13] of the world and he put our names on the
[51:15] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[51:17] foundation of the world Amen that's
[51:19] Bible that's the Word of God a man and
[51:23] in time God brings out the manifestation
[51:26] of sanctions a male that we are his
[51:30] children but not none there were not
[51:32] brother Branham children amen we're the
[51:34] seed and the children of God that the
[51:37] Lord sent the Prophet to get our
[51:39] attention a man grace Lewis brother so
[51:43] be in prayer as we'll get getting to end
[51:45] of this sermon and then end the notes
[51:47] and other things in just a little while
[51:49] but also to to remind you that the Lord
[51:53] willing I'd like to get into the
[51:54] communion service and usually of course
[51:56] during the summertime if the things are
[51:59] coming and going
[52:00] so maybe the Lord willing I'm not sure
[52:02] we'll see maybe to have communion maybe
[52:05] next Sunday so being prayer and the
[52:08] grace of God but we're gonna do what God
[52:09] wants us to do when God wants us to do
[52:11] it where God wants us to do it our God
[52:14] wants us to do it a man it's not my will
[52:16] it's his will a man by the grace of God
[52:19] so God elbows that we are dead to
[52:22] ourselves while we're alive to him but
[52:24] there's too many believers are still
[52:25] alive to themselves
[52:26] amen but you're the bride of Christ
[52:29] you're alive to him a man you're dead to
[52:32] yourself but a life to the Lord Jesus
[52:34] Christ and also to thank God for His
[52:38] grace to our brother Eric I believe it
[52:40] is and his wife that is in Nova Scotia a
[52:44] man and they are with our brother Ellie
[52:48] and sister Lily and to those that
[52:50] received the email from our brother Marc
[52:52] a man is the confirmation that all is
[52:55] well with them during the storm that
[52:57] struck Nova Scotia occur god bless them
[53:00] a man and God rest sister Lilia and
[53:03] brother Ellie they may praise the Lord
[53:06] and also to remind you that I did
[53:11] promise it and I finally got to it and

[1:02:55] this was the text that brother Brown use
[1:03:00] in the message on Missy yeah I have
[1:03:13] heard but now I see proverbs chapter
[1:03:17] three verse one
[1:03:23] my son forget not in my law but led by
[1:03:28] an art keep my Commandments for length
[1:03:32] of days and long life and peace shall
[1:03:36] they head to thee let not mercy and
[1:03:39] truth forsake thee buying them about thy
[1:03:43] neck write them upon the table of thine
[1:03:46] heart so shalt thou find favor a man
[1:03:51] favored and good understanding a man we
[1:03:56] need the grace of God but we need
[1:03:57] understanding he said in the sight of
[1:04:00] God and man trust in the Lord with all
[1:04:03] thine heart a man not part of it but all
[1:04:10] of it trusts in the Lord with all thine
[1:04:13] heart and lean not unto thine own
[1:04:16] understanding amen
[1:04:18] the game was the message lean not to
[1:04:20] your understanding amen
[1:04:22] but there's too many that's leaning to
[1:04:24] their own understanding too many they're
[1:04:26] getting the glory to themselves I know
[1:04:28] this I know that I see this and I see
[1:04:30] that brother if we are the seed of God
[1:04:33] we know what God has revealed
[1:04:35] to us it's God giving us the revelation
[1:04:39] is God giving us the understanding and
[1:04:41] it says so shalt thou find favor and
[1:04:43] good understanding in the sight of God
[1:04:46] and man but you're giving God the
[1:04:49] preeminence for giving God the glory and
[1:04:51] verse live trust in the Lord with all
[1:04:54] thine heart and lean not unto thine own
[1:04:58] understanding
[1:05:00] there's too many babe basing everything
[1:05:02] that they do on their own understanding
[1:05:04] no brothers sisters got to be God's
[1:05:06] understanding and the prophet of God
[1:05:08] brings that out again in the message on
[1:05:10] I have heard but now I see they didn't
[1:05:12] do it exactly the way that God wanted
[1:05:14] them to do it they didn't do it when God
[1:05:16] wanted them to do it they did it in
[1:05:18] their time they did it their way a man
[1:05:20] and really they were looking for
[1:05:22] attention for themselves but not for the
[1:05:24] Lord it is to give the glory to God
[1:05:26] and atella be sloth and it says in all
[1:05:30] thy ways this is tremendous in all thy
[1:05:33] ways acknowledge him and he shall direct
[1:05:37] thy paths a man but how many of us are
[1:05:41] acknowledging God he and all that we do
[1:05:43] amen brother you got to consult the Lord
[1:05:46] in all things a man it's not you making
[1:05:49] a decision I'm going to do this and I'm
[1:05:50] going to do that what is God's will for
[1:05:53] your life what is God's leadership in
[1:05:55] your life a man and brother oh my if
[1:05:58] we're born again it's not me that lives
[1:06:00] this Christ liveth in me and it's Christ
[1:06:03] lives in you and it's crazy living in
[1:06:05] you then he controls your thoughts your
[1:06:06] emotions your feelings he controls
[1:06:09] everything that you do amen it's not me
[1:06:12] that lives this Christ I live within me
[1:06:14] this is a tremendous statement so be not
[1:06:17] wise in your own eyes you don't make
[1:06:19] decisions you let God make the decision
[1:06:22] amen
[1:06:23] you made the decision to accept Christ
[1:06:25] amen and receive Christ into your life
[1:06:27] but once you once he comes into your
[1:06:30] life and into your heart then it's
[1:06:32] you're not living as him a man what you
[1:06:35] do is his leadership the anointing in
[1:06:37] you by the grace of God oh my the wisdom
[1:06:40] of God in you praise the name of the
[1:06:42] Lord so he said in all thy ways
[1:06:46] acknowledge him and
[1:06:48] he shall direct thy path be not wise in
[1:06:52] your own eyes don't give the glory to
[1:06:56] yourself give the glory to God a man but
[1:06:59] for the grace of God we wouldn't see
[1:07:01] what we see
[1:07:02] we wouldn't know what we know a man will
[1:07:05] give the glory to him and it says fear
[1:07:08] the Lord and depart from evil a man
[1:07:14] grace was as he said it shall be health
[1:07:16] to thy navel marrow to thy bones honor
[1:07:19] the Lord with thy substance and the
[1:07:21] first fruits of all thine increase a man
[1:07:25] give the glory to God
[1:07:26] god bless you may be seated turn with me
[1:07:29] to Psalms chapter 6
[1:07:32] no Psalms chapter our proverb from story
[1:07:35] proverbs chapter four fathers chapter
[1:07:41] four and verse five get wisdom get
[1:07:51] understanding we can have wisdom to know
[1:07:54] this to know that to know the message
[1:07:56] but brother how much understanding do we
[1:07:58] have a man if there's anything we need
[1:08:01] with the wisdom that God gives us we
[1:08:03] need understanding a man so it's going
[1:08:05] to reflect in us is going to produce the
[1:08:07] life that God wants it to produce in you
[1:08:10] and me a man they comes by hearing and
[1:08:12] hearing by the word a man but it takes
[1:08:15] more than the wisdom of the word we got
[1:08:17] to have the understanding of the word a
[1:08:19] man and faith is Revelation faith is
[1:08:22] understanding and it is not me
[1:08:24] in my in my intellectual knowledge but
[1:08:27] it's the revelation of God in my heart a
[1:08:30] man's not in our heads and again we got
[1:08:32] to make sure that we have we have the
[1:08:34] calling of God in our hearts we have the
[1:08:36] revelation of God in our hearts we have
[1:08:38] the message in our hearts but not in our
[1:08:40] heads there's so many got it in their
[1:08:42] heads but there's not in their hearts
[1:08:44] and I know that by the life that they're
[1:08:46] living and I know that because why
[1:08:48] because it's not it is not in control of
[1:08:51] their life it's not governing them to do
[1:08:53] this or to do this in God's time no no
[1:08:56] they're going to they're going they're
[1:08:57] going to make the decisions and they're
[1:08:58] going to do it in
[1:08:59] during their time doing the way they
[1:09:01] want to do it do it how they want to do
[1:09:03] it where they want to do it and when
[1:09:04] they want to do it no no if we're dead
[1:09:08] to ourselves and alive to God and we're
[1:09:10] born again and God is in us in our
[1:09:13] hearts and the Providence bringer that
[1:09:16] either in this message lean not to your
[1:09:18] own understanding or I have heard but
[1:09:20] now I see that he brings out the
[1:09:22] revelation that has got to be God in
[1:09:24] your heart and if you were born again he
[1:09:27] said is God in your heart and he said if
[1:09:29] God is not in your heart he said you're
[1:09:31] not born again a man so I trust that we
[1:09:35] are born again and the evidence of it is
[1:09:37] God in our hearts controlling the lives
[1:09:40] that we live
[1:09:41] controlling what we do and how we do it
[1:09:43] when we do it and where we do it amen
[1:09:46] so it's not me now it's Christ in me
[1:09:49] it's not you it is Christ in you
[1:09:51] amen this is absolutely a tremendous
[1:09:54] responsibility and it is - what is to
[1:09:57] die you ourselves and become alive to
[1:10:00] him amen and I die to ourselves so that
[1:10:03] it is not me
[1:10:04] making the decision since Christ in me
[1:10:07] making the decisions it's not me
[1:10:09] deciding this or deciding that is Christ
[1:10:11] in me making that decision and well god
[1:10:14] help us more that brother that you're
[1:10:16] the life that you are living and the job
[1:10:18] that you are doing and what you do it
[1:10:20] and how you do it and where you do it
[1:10:22] brother is not it's not your choice it's
[1:10:25] God in you a man praise the name of this
[1:10:28] is tremendous my brother we go back to
[1:10:30] the scriptures right again right from
[1:10:32] Genesis right on through the revelation
[1:10:34] it is God in control a man and as God
[1:10:38] Shalit challenged Cain in the book of
[1:10:41] Genesis if they do as well well they'll
[1:10:43] also be accepted but for it super-k to
[1:10:46] do well he had to submit himself to the
[1:10:48] leadership of God so that is not is not
[1:10:51] Cain and it would be God Enki amen
[1:10:54] but God wasn't in came because Cain
[1:10:56] didn't want that kind of leadership
[1:10:58] enabled it and that's the way that Abel
[1:11:01] had basically died to himself and become
[1:11:03] alive to the will of God he wanted the
[1:11:06] revelation of the will of God what is it
[1:11:08] that I what I what do I have to do Lord
[1:11:10] so I can get back
[1:11:11] in the fellowship with you again and
[1:11:13] whatever I had to do Lord from that I
[1:11:15] what I do is say can please God
[1:11:18] a man so he went out and he do this now
[1:11:21] Cain didn't agree with that a man
[1:11:23] because to him it was it wasn't a clean
[1:11:27] religion what for the glutton what kind
[1:11:30] of religion is sad to go and kill that
[1:11:32] they that lamb that doesn't make sense
[1:11:35] where brother he had a revelation of why
[1:11:37] he needed to do it a man when it comes
[1:11:40] to the shedding of blood a man he knew
[1:11:43] listen all we could get back into the
[1:11:45] original sin and brother Aeterna there's
[1:11:48] the original sin caused blood to be shed
[1:11:50] a man exactly I trust you have the
[1:11:53] understanding I don't have to say it
[1:11:55] from the pulpit but you have the
[1:11:56] understanding of the blood that was shed
[1:11:58] in the original sin monetarily they said
[1:12:01] that that a Abel he had sufficient
[1:12:04] revelation and again like I said maybe
[1:12:07] care maybe Adam and Eve had went and
[1:12:10] told him exactly what went on in the
[1:12:12] Garden of Eden
[1:12:13] and why this happened why that happened
[1:12:15] and when eventually why God put him out
[1:12:18] of the garden
[1:12:18] amen and so it so Abel walked away with
[1:12:22] a revelation a man that if that God was
[1:12:25] going to require this kind of a
[1:12:26] sacrifice it was going to require a
[1:12:28] blood sacrifice but Cain he went away
[1:12:31] and he thought well well God is going to
[1:12:33] go be satisfied with his sacrifice I did
[1:12:36] this and I did that and I know I grew I
[1:12:38] grew all of the all of these vegetables
[1:12:40] I grew maybe they need these fruits and
[1:12:42] I don't know what it what else he had
[1:12:44] there but that's what s what Cain came
[1:12:47] and offered to the Lord
[1:12:48] it was the works of his hands yeah
[1:12:51] exactly
[1:12:51] amen but what are what are we offering
[1:12:54] unto the Lord that's the old Lord you
[1:12:56] know I'm doing this for you I'm doing
[1:12:58] that for you but what do you say what is
[1:13:00] that God wants us to do amen
[1:13:03] what does God want you to do ain't may
[1:13:05] hole please in the name of the Lord
[1:13:07] I have his leadership in your heart have
[1:13:09] his leadership in your soul a man so
[1:13:12] that what you are doing in everyday
[1:13:14] living
[1:13:15] is what God wants you to do and how you
[1:13:18] do it when you do it where you do it
[1:13:20] it's what God wants a mayor's know what
[1:13:23] I didn't make the decision God made this
[1:13:25] decision a man to God be the glory a man
[1:13:30] all brothers show that you can you can
[1:13:31] truly say it's not me that lives this
[1:13:34] Christ to live within me
[1:13:35] amen and if that is the truth amen if
[1:13:39] that's us say the Lord then no matter
[1:13:41] what happens in your life God's in
[1:13:43] control amen
[1:13:45] no matter what you do God told you to do
[1:13:47] it amen if not yes not a choice you made
[1:13:50] it's not a decision made you made no no
[1:13:52] it's it's another anointing it's another
[1:13:54] life it's another influence in your life
[1:13:56] and it's in your soul a man when it
[1:14:00] comes to us this in our flesh when it
[1:14:03] comes to us making a decision we're
[1:14:05] going to do this we're going to do that
[1:14:06] and oh yeah it's all in our minds Billy
[1:14:10] and the senses of our flesh and so on
[1:14:13] and or maybe even the senses of your
[1:14:15] human spirit but if you're born again
[1:14:17] it's not me it's got in me
[1:14:20] amen amen amen and again they're part of
[1:14:23] God and I lighting this in the message I
[1:14:27] have heard but now I see if what you're
[1:14:29] doing is that God doing it or is it you
[1:14:32] doing it or is what you're doing is it
[1:14:34] is it just based on the letter of the
[1:14:36] word
[1:14:36] or is it the spiritual revelation of the
[1:14:39] word and it's God in control ain't man
[1:14:42] Oh what did you do this why did you do
[1:14:44] that
[1:14:44] that's what that don't make sense that
[1:14:46] don't make sense well I believe it with
[1:14:48] God because I'll tell you this when it
[1:14:50] comes to intellectually and when it
[1:14:52] comes to naturally what God does doesn't
[1:14:55] make sense for the truth into our human
[1:14:57] thoughts
[1:14:57] hey there's absolutely the truth because
[1:15:00] old by listen Satan is working on the
[1:15:03] senses of our flesh all you got to do
[1:15:05] this because you need this you got to do
[1:15:07] that because you need that you got to go
[1:15:09] here because you or you're gonna play
[1:15:11] what you physically need right there no
[1:15:13] but what does God want me to do where
[1:15:15] does God want me to go and it doesn't
[1:15:17] make sense to me to our natural innate
[1:15:19] human nature no no it doesn't makes it
[1:15:22] Lord will I need this we've got to be
[1:15:25] well you go do this and I'll bless you
[1:15:26] with that
[1:15:27] amen but if people think you and sing
[1:15:30] well for me to me to get this result I
[1:15:33] got to do it this way I got to do it
[1:15:34] this time I got to do it in this place
[1:15:36] no no no no no brother sister we got to
[1:15:39] do it and let God decide any man I tell
[1:15:42] you this when God makes a decision we
[1:15:44] think oh Lord
[1:15:45] I won't i won't be able to accomplish
[1:15:47] this I'm gonna do it oh yes you will
[1:15:49] I'll be there
[1:15:51] amen I'm gonna do it now you hadn't got
[1:15:55] to do it so God doesn't it in every in
[1:15:57] such a way so that we'll know that it's
[1:15:59] not us it's not it's not the devil
[1:16:01] either working in our flesh is God
[1:16:03] working in our soul because our lives
[1:16:05] will be America amen what you do how you
[1:16:09] do it when you do it where you do it is
[1:16:11] it's a miracle and people who have
[1:16:13] people would be astonished it says well
[1:16:15] how do you know this now can you do this
[1:16:18] well it's not me it's Christ in me you
[1:16:21] know and again it's like I told you
[1:16:23] about that when I was working in the
[1:16:24] retail business and and we were going to
[1:16:26] have a sale and they were looking for a
[1:16:29] certain thing that they they they were
[1:16:30] supposed to put on us as a special you
[1:16:33] know they do draw customers into the
[1:16:35] store and so on and they were looking
[1:16:37] for this looking for that a nice and
[1:16:38] some papers or something and then I was
[1:16:43] looking to but not in the way that they
[1:16:44] were looking a man because they were
[1:16:47] they were running the air running there
[1:16:49] and looking here and looking there and
[1:16:50] the finally as I said well one of the
[1:16:53] manual said mister lush are you
[1:16:56] concerned I said yes I am and they said
[1:16:58] well why aren't you looking for this I
[1:17:00] said I am and I said I'm not worried
[1:17:02] about it because I said I said wherever
[1:17:04] it is I said the lord ëletís to it and I
[1:17:08] told that to them although they they
[1:17:10] they were not some of them were not
[1:17:11] professing Christians and so on but they
[1:17:13] knew that I was a Christian they knew
[1:17:16] that I was standing with the Lord they
[1:17:18] knew that I was being led by the spirit
[1:17:20] and it's not my real father going be
[1:17:22] done
[1:17:23] and they so what are you gonna do I said
[1:17:25] well I'm just waiting on the Lord I said
[1:17:26] and he's gonna he's gonna give it to us
[1:17:29] I said before the store opens amen
[1:17:32] because we were going around looking for
[1:17:34] it and the Lord did praise the name of
[1:17:37] the Lord and we went and then here it
[1:17:39] was right there
[1:17:40] I right there Oh how'd you know
[1:17:43] that I said well I said that was in
[1:17:44] God's hands I told you he was going to
[1:17:46] he was going to find it for us I said
[1:17:48] it's not me we do this and we do this we
[1:17:50] do that but I should trust the Lord amen
[1:17:53] by the grace of Almighty God scene
[1:17:56] showing God in control not us oh my if
[1:18:00] it's arson control as human beings
[1:18:03] they're my co-workers and it was their
[1:18:06] human part that was in control because
[1:18:09] they were worried they were all mine
[1:18:10] they were all tore up because nervous
[1:18:13] but they couldn't understand why I was
[1:18:15] so calm and so on I said well I said I
[1:18:18] find it I said the Lord knows where it
[1:18:20] is
[1:18:20] and yeah you were like that I said yeah
[1:18:23] I was like that and then they couldn't
[1:18:25] understand why I was so calm and why I
[1:18:27] wasn't so worked up and what I wasn't
[1:18:30] doing like the restaurant running here
[1:18:32] running there looking here lifting this
[1:18:34] lifting that well I started just
[1:18:35] following these leadership and he'll
[1:18:37] leave me to it
[1:18:37] ain't man and that's right you got to
[1:18:40] wait on the Lord and as I said we did
[1:18:43] find it before the store open a man and
[1:18:46] I found it and then and to God be the
[1:18:49] glory amen so brother sister iske we've
[1:18:54] got it we gotta let God be in control of
[1:18:56] your I don't care what the job you're
[1:18:58] doing whether it's the sisters in the
[1:19:00] home whether sir brothers in their jobs
[1:19:02] but you got to be led by the spirit it's
[1:19:05] not what you want to do what does God
[1:19:06] want you to do a man and again there's
[1:19:10] like III one there's the Lord why do you
[1:19:12] let me here why did you lead me there
[1:19:14] why did you go walkin want me to get do
[1:19:16] this job you want me to do that job and
[1:19:18] or there's so many different jobs that I
[1:19:20] had but I believe it was the Lord wanted
[1:19:23] one of me to experience this he wanted
[1:19:26] me to experience that God was teaching
[1:19:27] me a man and God is teaching us God is
[1:19:30] raising us God has incurred while
[1:19:32] showing courage as a man so we're gonna
[1:19:35] follow his leaders
[1:19:36] by the grace of God or don't you try to
[1:19:38] figure that with your mind in your
[1:19:40] census you gotta be led by the spirit
[1:19:43] sons and daughters of God are led by the
[1:19:45] Spirit of God and the sons and daughters
[1:19:47] of God are walking in the spirit
[1:19:50] a man your walk in the spirit if you're
[1:19:52] walking in spirit you're gonna be led by
[1:19:54] the spirit but if you're not walking in
[1:19:56] the spirit you won't be led by the
[1:19:57] spirit ain't man because you're gonna go
[1:20:00] you're going to go by the intellect not
[1:20:02] the not the leadership in your soul a
[1:20:04] man again when they say the Prophet said
[1:20:06] if you are born again God is in your
[1:20:08] soul and if you're not born again he
[1:20:10] said God is not in your soul and if God
[1:20:13] is not in your soul you're not morning
[1:20:15] no no you might be religious but not
[1:20:18] born again
[1:20:18] a man so see the importance of being
[1:20:23] born again not nothing recognizing over
[1:20:26] there that's god that's God that's his
[1:20:28] word that's his word yeah but it's got
[1:20:30] to be in you a man brother I got the
[1:20:33] revelation in my heart not in my head
[1:20:35] because the devil got it in his head and
[1:20:37] he a maybe more than that when it comes
[1:20:40] to Satan a man that's why that's whether
[1:20:43] you can have 99% of the truth amen and
[1:20:46] 1% wrong a man because you don't have it
[1:20:50] in your soul you got it in your head you
[1:20:52] got the end of the intellect of it the
[1:20:53] intellectual part of it but you don't
[1:20:55] have the spiritual revelation and we got
[1:20:57] the spiritual revelation in our hearts
[1:20:59] it's going it's going to manifest in us
[1:21:01] what God wants to be in our lives
[1:21:03] it's gonna give us God's leadership when
[1:21:06] God wants to save this our God wants us
[1:21:08] to do this and so on
[1:21:09] amen now I tell you most believers today
[1:21:11] they got it in their heads but they
[1:21:14] don't have it in their hearts hey man oh
[1:21:16] yeah oh they might grow too and they
[1:21:19] live this this kind of like they won't
[1:21:21] do this or on the Christian so I won't
[1:21:23] do that I'm a Christian I won't do that
[1:21:25] and well you you don't have to say I
[1:21:26] won't do it you're not going to do it
[1:21:28] amen because why because you're born
[1:21:31] again you got a new nature and you're
[1:21:33] governed by that new nature amen but
[1:21:36] there's too many I know there's a lot of
[1:21:38] believers that are still going by their
[1:21:39] own old nature Oh like like I said this
[1:21:42] person is a good person and that person
[1:21:45] is a good they got good ideas and good
[1:21:46] days
[1:21:47] good that they need the goodness of God
[1:21:49] any man in their souls brother there
[1:21:53] ever anything we need is the goodness of
[1:21:55] God amen
[1:21:57] so it's the job you're doing God's
[1:21:59] leadership in your heart now and knowing
[1:22:03] that I want to come to education is the
[1:22:05] education you're getting God's
[1:22:06] leadership in your heart did God want
[1:22:08] you to have that education not sometimes
[1:22:11] not necessarily it's the influence of
[1:22:12] the world amen
[1:22:14] or the sake quenette education oh yeah
[1:22:18] see that's that's a cos the devil he
[1:22:22] works on the intellect but God working
[1:22:24] on the spiritual revelation hey man
[1:22:27] well God wants you to have this one sad
[1:22:28] but God don't want you to go there and
[1:22:30] get this all our chicken because more
[1:22:32] education man gets to less trust and
[1:22:34] faith he got and God he's gone by his
[1:22:37] gun way his knowledge he's gone by what
[1:22:38] he's been trained he's going by what
[1:22:40] he's been taught amen brother sister as
[1:22:42] I said I wouldn't got a grade 9 diploma
[1:22:44] and then there was a where I was maybe
[1:22:48] in my forties when I went and took that
[1:22:50] equivalence equivalency test to see if I
[1:22:53] could get a grade 11 diploma and I took
[1:22:55] the equivalency test and I got 72% and
[1:22:58] they gave me a crate a grade 11
[1:23:00] equivalency diploma although I never got
[1:23:02] it in grade 10 I never got in grade 11 a
[1:23:04] man and so on but the Lord taught the
[1:23:08] item must have led me to that time a man
[1:23:10] most was think I got to do is I got it I
[1:23:13] got it no follow the COTS leadership a
[1:23:16] man do what God wants you to do and when
[1:23:19] he wants you to do it how he want you to
[1:23:21] do it get the education that God wants
[1:23:23] it again no no don't go by the influence
[1:23:25] of a man out there or the influence of
[1:23:28] the teachers from the influence of the
[1:23:30] professor's and all that no that's what
[1:23:32] God wants you to have like the problem
[1:23:34] of God he had grade seven others never a
[1:23:36] grade seven others might have a grade
[1:23:37] five or six or four amen
[1:23:40] right and brothers I know there was a
[1:23:42] preacher there God use tremendously
[1:23:44] you were greedy yet great for yeah yeah
[1:23:48] greedy for that's all yeah and as I said
[1:23:51] I went and I I and I got a grade nine
[1:23:54] diploma and that was it I went on grade
[1:23:57] 10 then again I never got no diploma
[1:23:59] I'm not great
[1:24:00] never got naughty blown they may Lord
[1:24:03] all praise the Lord
[1:24:05] I was I was following these leadership
[1:24:07] Lord whatever you want me to do whatever
[1:24:09] glory
[1:24:10] whatever you want me to have a man so
[1:24:12] Lord I'm not gonna boast too much in my
[1:24:15] knowledge I said I get this diploma or
[1:24:17] that diploma I'll leave that with God
[1:24:19] amen so I followed God's leadership
[1:24:22] doing what he wanted me to do when he
[1:24:24] wanted me to do it and where he wanted
[1:24:26] me to do a man again as I say when we
[1:24:28] came to the message of the hour and in
[1:24:30] gamble they were saying old brother
[1:24:32] Gerald we want you to be the pastor I
[1:24:33] said no no no I said brother baron say
[1:24:35] you can take it or another brother that
[1:24:38] was there I said brother you could a no
[1:24:39] no no we are not the pastor we do not
[1:24:42] have the calling you take it but I
[1:24:44] didn't want it and the father I go I
[1:24:47] thank the Lord I said have caught the
[1:24:48] brother God said if you want it he said
[1:24:51] God never called you a man and I didn't
[1:24:54] want it that's the absolute truth I
[1:24:56] didn't want it and even though I I just
[1:24:58] filled it in there I said all fillion
[1:25:00] and so on and I knew it was God that was
[1:25:04] working in me because worried there was
[1:25:05] a ministry God was working on a man so
[1:25:10] it wasn't me working on that ministry
[1:25:12] was God working on that ministry it was
[1:25:14] God that led me to do them so the
[1:25:15] Scarlet led me to do that ain't man here
[1:25:17] I was in gamble here it was in Buer and
[1:25:20] here I was maybe I was out in western
[1:25:21] Newfoundland and countering the people
[1:25:24] there counselling the people in western
[1:25:26] new for a counseling the people of
[1:25:27] southern new flag counseling Iowa's yes
[1:25:30] I said Lord I said I don't know what's
[1:25:32] going on here but I'll leave that with
[1:25:33] you and counseling them in central
[1:25:36] Newfoundland and so on so I said Lord I
[1:25:38] said whatever you want to do in me

[1:30:20] in Abraham not by what man sees what God
[1:30:23] sees and he said by James he justified
[1:30:29] Abraham by what man saw in Abraham so
[1:30:32] what does God see in you and what is man
[1:30:36] saying
[1:30:37] a man and he said Abraham see he said he
[1:30:41] believed God and that's what God saw him
[1:30:44] is was his faith he believed God amen
[1:30:50] and he sober then when he went to acting
[1:30:53] and so it was already done that's what
[1:30:56] man saw in him a man why he went and
[1:31:01] lived his faith and he went out acting
[1:31:03] it living that out doing this up why are

[1:31:32] absolute truth yeah no no you're leaving
[1:31:35] all that to God by the grace of God amen

[1:31:41] because of that he just did it for the
[1:31:43] glory of God see your right motive and
[1:31:47] your right objective is for the glory of
[1:31:49] God regardless of what it is a man is
[1:31:52] not because I do this job because I'll

[1:34:56] spiritual brother
[1:34:58] there's too many put the emphasis on the
[1:35:00] natural things but how many are giving
[1:35:02] God preeminence in the spirit
[1:35:03] a man grace of God brother he said
[1:35:14] abraham believed God that's what God saw
[1:35:18] in Abraham and he said when he went to
[1:35:24] acting as though it was already done
[1:35:26] that's what man saw him do we believe in
[1:35:30] the resurrection and the rapture do we
[1:35:33] believe in the end that we're in the end
[1:35:35] does our life reflect that the emphasis
[1:35:39] we're putting on this the emphasis were
[1:35:40] putting on that if there's anything we
[1:35:42] ought to be putting the emphasis on is
[1:35:43] to spiritual not the natural but no it's
[1:35:49] a generation that they want to want to
[1:35:51] put the insan the natural make sure
[1:35:53] everything is in order and the lantern
[1:35:55] natural make sure everything is going to
[1:35:57] be there for them in the natural but why
[1:35:59] would you spiritual because the natural
[1:36:01] is passing away but their faith is in
[1:36:05] the natural not in the spiritual any
[1:36:08] brown faith within the spiritual god

[1:36:21] not our natural being what our natural
[1:36:23] beings want its what our what's in our

[1:37:03] job and he was hungry and thirsty
[1:37:05] oh no when I come from not the natural

[1:37:10] and he said the Lord gives the Lord
[1:37:12] takes away blessed be the name of the
[1:37:14] Lord amen and so on each it was

[1:44:49] just just a physical sense of this body
[1:44:52] brings us more and more contact with
[1:44:54] that dimension we're conscious of this
[1:44:56] one we're looking at this we're feeling
[1:44:57] this and we're thinking this and
[1:44:59] thinking that and that's got more
[1:45:01] control of the people and the Holy Ghost
[1:45:04] worse if the Holy Ghost amen
[1:45:07] you're not living and conscious all over
[1:45:09] get away I'm not gonna dwell on that
[1:45:12] nothing to dwell on that oh thank you
[1:45:14] lord hallelujah thank you Jesus amen
[1:45:17] focus on the spiritual not the natural
[1:45:21] it's like when brother Badham himself
[1:45:24] amen he stepped he stepped beyond the
[1:45:28] curtain of time as a word and oh it was
[1:45:31] it was a hope here was his daughter yeah
[1:45:38] she just died but if she said and he
[1:45:42] said who are you
[1:45:42] she's you don't know me what was her
[1:45:45] name
[1:45:48] oh yeah Sharon Rose yeah and she said
[1:45:52] you don't know me
[1:45:53] mmm no she's I'm Sharon Rose it but
[1:45:59] she just died she was only just a baby
[1:46:01] but when he got in that dimension she
[1:46:04] was a young girl she's a young girl
[1:46:08] Sharon Rose yes she said don't you
[1:46:12] believe this
[1:46:12] she's you preach this and she said oh
[1:46:16] she said her mom's just over there and
[1:46:19] she went over and sister Bannon was
[1:46:21] sitting in the chair yeah and he saw her
[1:46:26] he recognized her but she said bill
[1:46:30] she said they want to take this chair
[1:46:32] she said is paid for because just before
[1:46:36] she died apparently before all these
[1:46:38] things happen that that the were they
[1:46:41] had bought the chair and they weren't
[1:46:42] able to pay for it and they come and
[1:46:44] took it they took the chair back she
[1:46:47] said they won't take this one they said
[1:46:49] he's paid for her praise the Lord
[1:46:52] what a place we're going you know what's
[1:46:54] real I I trust by grace through the
[1:46:58] faith that God has given us and God is
[1:47:00] giving us a man through the message of
[1:47:02] the hour and the prophet of this age all
[1:47:04] that God has done brother we ought to be
[1:47:07] more and more and more conscious than
[1:47:08] any other age to that other dimension
[1:47:11] yeah if the data are waiting on us well
[1:47:14] that we got to be conscious of it yeah
[1:47:17] they're waiting for us to getting that
[1:47:18] thing we're conscious of that dimension
[1:47:20] conscious of the resurrection
[1:47:21] amen and God's waiting on us for the
[1:47:24] rapture so we got a bit like Jesus we
[1:47:28] got to get in the flesh a man not like
[1:47:31] the disciples they were sleeping a man
[1:47:34] like Jesus we get it your Jesus was in
[1:47:36] the flesh for what was he he was the
[1:47:37] Word of God made flesh now we're the
[1:47:40] Word made flesh
[1:47:41] and if we're the Word made flesh we're
[1:47:43] gonna wreck it he recognized what he had
[1:47:45] to do what was going to happen now I
[1:47:47] must add the bride to recognize what
[1:47:50] we're going to do he was going to lay
[1:47:52] his life down pick it up again but the
[1:47:54] bride is gonna pick her life huh
[1:47:59] as God revealed to us what is in this
[1:48:01] hour and this age brother got the
[1:48:04] responsibility in the bright bridegroom
[1:48:06] was one thing the responsibility and the
[1:48:08] bride is another responsibility in the
[1:48:11] bride is the resurrection and the
[1:48:12] rapture now eternity mostly just
[1:48:16] conscious of doctrines and I think
[1:48:19] brother George brought up the emphasis
[1:48:20] that people are putting on doctrines
[1:48:22] brother it's the book of Acts amen
[1:48:27] and in the book of Acts is any
[1:48:28] revelation is the resurrection and the
[1:48:31] rapture oh yeah the book of it I like I
[1:48:35] like what he brought out the book of
[1:48:36] Acts is still got ongoing amen as I said
[1:48:39] right you're going from the the Jews of
[1:48:41] the Gentiles now you're going from the
[1:48:42] Gentiles back to the Jews or what we're
[1:48:46] seeing oughta make is very very serious
[1:48:48] amen
[1:48:49] more and more God conscious more and
[1:48:51] more conscious of eternity more and more
[1:48:53] conscious of the resurrection more and
[1:48:55] more conscious of the rapture Jesus said
[1:48:57] I am the resurrection and the rapture
[1:49:00] would have rights your resurrection
[1:49:01] because of cause crisis in the bride now
[1:49:04] we are the resurrection and the rapture
[1:49:07] I pray God that we're going to have the
[1:49:12] it's going to have the results in us the
[1:49:13] effect on us that it had in Jesus when
[1:49:16] he was here and he went and he prayed
[1:49:20] and prayed and he prayed and he knew it
[1:49:22] is going to lay his life in order to
[1:49:23] manifest it
[1:49:24] he would have delay it suffer have you
[1:49:28] considered what he suffered he suffered
[1:49:29] for you for me what was where we were
[1:49:35] thee of that why did he do that what did
[1:49:39] he endure all that suffering that pain
[1:49:41] that agony and he in experienced death
[1:49:44] why because he had a revelation of his
[1:49:50] sons and daughters that he was going to
[1:49:53] redeem a man god help his brother he
[1:49:57] redeemed sons and daughters and he was
[1:50:00] laying his life down for his sons and
[1:50:01] all the things today that people will do
[1:50:03] for their natural families brother look
[1:50:06] what he did look what he did
[1:50:11] let's let's recognize it as I said
[1:50:14] there's too many of those pictures of a
[1:50:16] Christ on the cross - not exactly the
[1:50:18] way there should be why because it was
[1:50:22] nothing but blood a man you blood all
[1:50:27] over his body
[1:50:28] blood from the head right on down to the
[1:50:30] feet under finally they'd the drove the
[1:50:33] spear into his side and all the blood
[1:50:36] came out and the prophet of God said
[1:50:39] where did it go he said I went down to
[1:50:41] the earth and he said just dried up
[1:50:45] yeah but the life of the blood is what
[1:50:48] counts a man now I said the light he
[1:50:52] came back with the life of the blood and
[1:50:54] he shared it with you and me as the Holy
[1:50:55] Ghost amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:51:02] God help us to have a right motive and a
[1:51:07] right objective for what we believe and
[1:51:11] that's what the Prophet is highlighted
[1:51:14] in this message I have heard but now I
[1:51:16] see he said what is your motive and what
[1:51:19] is your objective for believing this
[1:51:22] message
[1:51:23] what is your mode of an objective for
[1:51:26] believing this and believe in this I
[1:51:27] brought it out in one of these in this
[1:51:30] message before in hearing and seen what
[1:51:33] brother Brown said concerning healing he
[1:51:37] says you can have faith to be healed
[1:51:38] what is your motive what is your
[1:51:40] objective why do you want to be healed
[1:51:44] most want to be healed because oh I just
[1:51:47] don't wanna be sick no more but he said
[1:51:49] that's the wrong motive and the wrong
[1:51:51] objective what is the right motive and
[1:51:55] the right objective for your healing it
[1:51:59] is for the glory of God
[1:52:02] you've gotta want it for the glory not
[1:52:05] because I'm sick and I don't want to sit
[1:52:07] no more no I want Lord I want you to
[1:52:09] glory for yourself in me I'll give you
[1:52:12] the glory I'll give you the praise Oh
[1:52:14] are you Lord Lord there's not me just go
[1:52:18] oh yes Oh Lord wonderful I got faith to
[1:52:21] be healed I got faith to be healed north
[1:52:23] to the west well that's what I'm thank
[1:52:25] thank you lord
[1:52:26] Vaughn and then they'll gluten and
[1:52:28] rejoice oh yeah I'm here because I have
[1:52:30] faith to be you know the prophecies
[1:52:33] you're gonna have faith to be healed to
[1:52:34] go to hell if your motive is not right
[1:52:37] your objective is not right got it
[1:52:40] and your motive and objective has got to
[1:52:42] be for the glory of God but the proud of
[1:52:45] God is highlighting here in this message
[1:52:47] there's too many their motive is not
[1:52:49] right and your objective is not right he
[1:52:51] said they have selfish reasons a man
[1:52:54] they want to be heal for this reason and
[1:52:56] they want God to bless them for this
[1:52:58] reason or that reason no no it's gotta
[1:53:01] be for the glory of God and brother in
[1:53:06] the message he said he said job he said
[1:53:13] let's take a little of his life job was
[1:53:15] a prophet and he was a man that lived
[1:53:17] back before the Bible was written and
[1:53:19] has been thought that job was one of the
[1:53:22] oldest books of the Bible because it was
[1:53:24] written before Genesis was written and
[1:53:26] he said jovi said this great warrior and
[1:53:30] prophet and no doubt he had been brought
[1:53:32] up and he had served the Lord all of his
[1:53:35] life and he said he has such a gallant
[1:53:38] life to the people and he said all IDI
[1:53:41] respects for him but he said he come to
[1:53:45] a place where he calls a near being
[1:53:48] tempted of the Lord
[1:53:50] attested of the Lord he said but I'd
[1:53:52] like to use the word tested and he said
[1:53:56] every son that cometh to God must first
[1:53:59] be tested tried and child trained and
[1:54:03] then if the testing gets hard and we
[1:54:06] think it's too hard and and won't listen
[1:54:09] and won't take heed he said then he said
[1:54:12] we become illegitimate children and not
[1:54:16] a child of God because there's nothing
[1:54:19] can move a real born-again child of God
[1:54:23] away from his parent he is part of God
[1:54:27] amen as if you're really truly born
[1:54:31] again amen and that and the baptism of
[1:54:36] the Holy Ghost he's in your heart he's
[1:54:38] in your soul he's in control not just in
[1:54:40] your flesh oh yeah I've seen a lot of
[1:54:44] people with the anointing in their flesh
[1:54:45] but how many got the anointing in their
[1:54:47] heart yeah
[1:54:51] God Elvis he says you can do more no
[1:54:56] more deny it you can deny yourself were
[1:55:00] you had an experience and you've been
[1:55:02] trained and tested and now he said this
[1:55:06] man he said being a prophet he had
[1:55:08] access he said the God's grace but Jobe
[1:55:11] didn't have a Bible to read and it says
[1:55:16] but he had access to God by revelation
[1:55:19] and by vision we got the Bible but for
[1:55:25] Joel was absolutely faith revelation and
[1:55:28] vision amen
[1:55:30] and it was in his heart not his head a
[1:55:34] man and he said Satan began to accuse
[1:55:41] job and that's the way he does every
[1:55:44] inspired sermon of God Satan is always
[1:55:47] there to accuse him of everything that
[1:55:50] he does that's not right now should we
[1:55:52] find out his life and trials his great
[1:55:55] faith even Jesus when he came on earth
[1:55:58] he referred to the patience of Job and
[1:56:01] he said have you not read of the
[1:56:03] patience of Job heesu faith waits with
[1:56:06] patience for the promised word to be
[1:56:09] fulfilled amen we don't doubt God we
[1:56:13] believe God amen and we have patience
[1:56:16] with God a man and he said he had a
[1:56:22] lovely family they were taken from him
[1:56:25] he had good health it was taken from him
[1:56:27] everything he hold in his life was take
[1:56:30] and he had us a sheep with a piece of
[1:56:33] crock scraping his boils and even to his
[1:56:36] own wave spoke against him why not curse
[1:56:40] God and die and he said thou speakest as
[1:56:43] a foolish woman God took brother-sister
[1:56:45] what if God took all what you got and
[1:56:50] remembers coming to that test oh yeah
[1:56:53] when the Antichrist reigns he's gonna
[1:56:55] come to that test where you're gonna
[1:56:57] lose everything you got you won't hold
[1:57:00] your car you won't own your your vehicle
[1:57:03] you won't own any no money no no that's
[1:57:08] coming God's gonna really test us that's
[1:57:13] right that's why I like I said I
[1:57:17] sometimes like when I go to a bank and
[1:57:18] get cash I said can I have some of that
[1:57:20] worthless money and they just laughing
[1:57:23] it worthless I said yeah it's worthless
[1:57:27] as it's just paper that's all because
[1:57:32] it's not when you consider it was all
[1:57:34] based on gold when you consider the gold
[1:57:36] that nations God it's not working
[1:57:40] because they want they want to have gold
[1:57:43] because that that'll that will justify
[1:57:46] them in putting up more and more cash
[1:57:49] it's supposed to be based on the gold
[1:57:51] that the country got but I tell you
[1:57:54] America don't have enough country to
[1:57:56] back up the the funds that they got out
[1:57:59] Canada don't have enough gold the back
[1:58:02] of the funds that they would that they
[1:58:03] got on paper no no that's why our
[1:58:08] brother George I think must have touched
[1:58:09] on it when he was here concerning the
[1:58:11] Antichrist and the Antichrist got more
[1:58:15] gold than any other nation that's why
[1:58:21] that one day they're going to have to
[1:58:23] give everything over to the control of
[1:58:26] the Antichrist amen
[1:58:29] beyond your dirt so that you're not
[1:58:33] going to give your control to the
[1:58:35] Antichrist for the sake of money
[1:58:38] no we're gonna give our chiral control
[1:58:41] to Christ amen for the sake of our faith
[1:58:45] for the sake of the resurrection for the
[1:58:47] sake of the rapture this is up serious
[1:58:50] cities brother what this is what I want
[1:58:56] that want you to get what is your motive
[1:58:58] and your objective for believing this
[1:59:00] message and the prophet of God
[1:59:04] highlights your motive and your
[1:59:06] objective why are you believing this
[1:59:09] message what what is your objective
[1:59:11] oh well it's going to give me wrapping
[1:59:16] paper going to rapture or and it comes
[1:59:19] to the message God did this God did this
[1:59:21] yes well what are we doing the Prophet
[1:59:24] did this to poverty what are we doing
[1:59:26] the responsibilities in your lap now the
[1:59:30] prophet of God was seen seeing those
[1:59:31] things about run and the people weren't
[1:59:34] living it out and that's why he he was
[1:59:37] he consulted the Lord because so the
[1:59:39] Lord he was really burdened now he was
[1:59:42] so he was so desperate and and and felt
[1:59:45] so bad that there were so few believers
[1:59:48] that I'll be honest he wanted to commit
[1:59:51] suicide that's how bad it was for him
[1:59:55] because why he was looking for more and
[1:59:57] more results in what he did and what God
[2:00:02] did in his ministry and he was getting
[2:00:05] less and less and less results yeah
[2:00:09] he said now he said there's no anointing
[2:00:11] there's not nothing like it used to be
[2:00:14] in his services one time it's just a
[2:00:15] just a dead dog he said and it's and
[2:00:20] it's like that now I did thump and he
[2:00:24] felt that way until the angel pulled him
[2:00:26] aside and the Angels her brother branham
[2:00:28] he said leave it in their lap he said
[2:00:32] just like he said when the brother he
[2:00:33] said went to look for our wife rising
[2:00:35] and he said well he said to Abraham we
[2:00:38] said what if he said she don't come she
[2:00:40] didn't want to come he said you are free
[2:00:42] he said from the responsibility you see
[2:00:46] just leave it in their lap
[2:00:50] and that's all the ministry can do is
[2:00:52] leave it in their lap it's a tremendous
[2:00:54] burden people don't understand the
[2:00:56] burden of the ministry they think it's
[2:00:59] just getting up and preaching this
[2:01:00] doctrine this idea this thought this
[2:01:02] thought oh no it's a responsibility a
[2:01:05] tremendous responsibility now and again
[2:01:11] if you ever need to pray for anyone pray
[2:01:13] for the ministry yeah the grace of God -
[2:01:17] just to sustain them and keep them grace
[2:01:22] of God because it's going to get worse
[2:01:25] and worse and worse and there's gonna
[2:01:27] get fewer and fewer and fewer that are
[2:01:29] bound for the resurrection and bound for
[2:01:31] the rapture they got the knowledge of
[2:01:33] the word they got the knowledge of the
[2:01:34] message they got the the intellectual
[2:01:37] knowledge of this doctrine and that
[2:01:38] doctrine but they don't have the right
[2:01:40] motive and a right objective for the
[2:01:44] message of the hour they leave in the
[2:01:45] man why are you believing this why are
[2:01:48] you staying there we're in the Word of
[2:01:49] God for this hour why am I in it what is
[2:01:52] the right motive objective the
[2:01:53] resurrection and the rapture it's not
[2:01:57] just being right in my doctrine no no
[2:02:00] it's having the faith that pleases God
[2:02:02] in this hour a man for the resurrection
[2:02:05] and the rapture resurrection the
[2:02:08] referring faith just consider the faith
[2:02:11] that Jesus said when he came to the end
[2:02:12] of his ministry now consider the faith
[2:02:14] that the bride got at the end of the
[2:02:16] ministry what what is God looking for
[2:02:20] God looking for the resurrection and the
[2:02:22] rapture ganda someone says I believe
[2:02:25] this doctrine this doctrine that
[2:02:27] doctrine again as our brother George
[2:02:29] highlighted the fact that people put
[2:02:31] emphasis on doctrine dr. doctrine they
[2:02:33] preach doctrine to preach doctrine yeah
[2:02:35] no no this preached the word in flesh
[2:02:39] the reserve to make drop or to manifest
[2:02:43] the resurrection and the rapture listen
[2:02:52] so I want you to notice he says sing and
[2:02:58] come up before God because he could come
[2:03:00] before God and accused the Christians or
[2:03:02] the believers all the time and notice he
[2:03:06] said the confidence that God had in a
[2:03:08] believer in other words God said to
[2:03:11] Satan you can't do it he's a just man
[2:03:15] he's justified he's a good man
[2:03:17] and there's not one like him in the
[2:03:19] holder oh what a man he said that God
[2:03:22] Himself would say to his enemy my
[2:03:24] servant is so perfect he said there's
[2:03:27] not another man like him at all on the
[2:03:29] earth oh if we could only be that kind
[2:03:32] of a man that God would could bestow
[2:03:34] that confidence upon us that no that
[2:03:38] will not twist from his word or beam
[2:03:40] away anyway stay exactly and he can put
[2:03:45] his trust in us can God trust you with
[2:03:50] the revelation that he has given you
[2:03:52] amen God will discern our our motives
[2:03:57] and our objectives why are you believing
[2:03:59] this message what is God's purpose for
[2:04:03] us to believe this message we have to
[2:04:06] have the right motive and the right
[2:04:07] objective he said job held right on and
[2:04:12] there was no turning back and he you
[2:04:16] cease when a man or a person has once
[2:04:18] really come in contact with God with
[2:04:21] that genuine revealed faith that God is
[2:04:24] there is nothing no time nowhere can
[2:04:27] ever separate that man from God but you
[2:04:33] seek a job with his perfect revelation
[2:04:35] of God and who God was and how God loved
[2:04:39] him he waited no matter what the
[2:04:41] circumstances he waited for his faith to
[2:04:45] be confirmed because he had a grip on
[2:04:48] God a revelation and brother he did have
[2:04:53] faith because God highlighted it in the
[2:04:55] presence of the devil and you considered
[2:04:58] my servant job
[2:05:01] God knew what was going to happen yeah
[2:05:04] the devil says yeah but that's you
[2:05:07] you're protecting him you're doing this
[2:05:10] you're doing that God said well you can
[2:05:13] go down but he said you can test them
[2:05:15] you can try try this try that but he
[2:05:17] said don't take his life and God allowed
[2:05:20] the devil to do that with you and me but
[2:05:23] do this do this do this but don't take
[2:05:26] his life amen
[2:05:28] how many would love that and I
[2:05:31] acknowledge that going on in our lives
[2:05:34] amen are we gonna be like Joel the Lord
[2:05:39] gives the Lord takes away blessed be the
[2:05:42] name of the Lord as we said when God
[2:05:44] took all of his wealth God took all of
[2:05:46] his family God took all of his
[2:05:48] possessions the Lord gives the Lord
[2:05:50] takes away blessed be the name of the
[2:05:53] Lord he worshiped God he gave God the
[2:05:56] glory how many are willing to do that
[2:05:59] most feel oh that's the devil yeah but
[2:06:02] God permitted the devil to do it you
[2:06:07] permitted Satan to do this for him Satan
[2:06:08] to do that brother in the name of Jesus
[2:06:10] helped us to Lord you trust God to know
[2:06:14] that you're in control not the devil
[2:06:18] Lord if this happened in your life that
[2:06:21] happen in your life you got a CO say
[2:06:22] Lord that was Satan I know but why did
[2:06:27] you allow it there's a purpose and
[2:06:30] there's a reason God hasn't turned us
[2:06:33] over to the devil with that reason God's
[2:06:35] not gonna let the devil do this and do
[2:06:37] this and do this and and just just first
[2:06:40] a we can play with you no no God got a
[2:06:43] reason God permitted him to do this with
[2:06:45] job that would joke and and there's not
[2:06:48] one of us but we're tested in one one
[2:06:50] one way or another like Joe was yeah and
[2:06:55] God and and it's fresh for a reason
[2:06:57] history he wanted to bring out the faith
[2:06:59] that was in Joe for you or your sake and
[2:07:02] for mine oh yeah they bring that the
[2:07:05] faith that was in Joel for generations
[2:07:07] to come
[2:07:07] oh yeah to bring out the revelation of
[2:07:10] the resurrection to bring out the
[2:07:12] concerning the rapture cabrillo
[2:07:13] concerning
[2:07:14] the nation and we were with him before
[2:07:16] the foundation of the world
[2:07:18] yeah where were you when I laid the
[2:07:21] foundations of the earth when the
[2:07:23] morning stars sang together sons of God
[2:07:24] shouted for joy
[2:07:25] amen Joe don't know where he was he was
[2:07:28] back there amen
[2:07:31] Oh wonderful god help us brother jobs
[2:07:37] motive was right and his objective was
[2:07:39] right it was all for the glory of God he
[2:07:44] endured it all to God be the glory he
[2:07:47] wasn't going to he didn't blame the
[2:07:49] devil even no no he knew that God was in
[2:07:52] control but there's too many today
[2:07:55] blaming the devil for this anything
[2:07:57] negative happens the devil the devil the
[2:07:59] devil yeah but why did God allow it
[2:08:03] there's a reason brother God wants to
[2:08:08] bring out our motive and our objective
[2:08:11] God wants to bring out in your life the
[2:08:13] motive you have for believing the word
[2:08:16] for professing to believe the message
[2:08:18] the motor you have for professing to be
[2:08:20] a Christian your objective what is your
[2:08:23] objective the problem of God said
[2:08:28] there's something that no matter what
[2:08:30] the difficulty is you want to go any out
[2:08:33] because you've got an objective and he
[2:08:37] said if you take the right motive
[2:08:39] towards that objective you'll get there
[2:08:41] he said you have got to have the right
[2:08:44] motive towards your objective God
[2:08:49] looking at your mode of your objective
[2:08:51] for believing the message you consecrate
[2:08:54] your motive objective for being in this
[2:08:56] church this morning and God's going to
[2:09:00] allow this to happen that to happen to
[2:09:02] bring out test you and bring out your
[2:09:05] your motive and objective that's the
[2:09:06] truth no matter what happens what God is
[2:09:10] manifesting is your motive for for
[2:09:12] living your objective for living for
[2:09:15] this word for this truth your motive and
[2:09:18] objective for coming to church your
[2:09:21] motive objective for taking your stand
[2:09:22] for the message God wants to bring it
[2:09:26] out
[2:09:27] yeah you know you know all that God has
[2:09:30] done and tested the people he's brought
[2:09:32] out their motives and their objectives
[2:09:34] the purpose why why why are you
[2:09:38] believing it
[2:09:39] why are you staking your stand why are
[2:09:41] you separating yourself and so on what
[2:09:45] is your objective yes sir what's your
[2:09:47] reason and what is your purpose he said
[2:09:52] always remember God's words are true I
[2:09:57] believe the right mental attitude toward
[2:10:00] any divine promise of God will bring it
[2:10:02] to pass and he said you can look at it
[2:10:05] in the right way but he should remember
[2:10:07] here has been my standard in life I have
[2:10:11] tried to do this the first thing I want
[2:10:13] to find out whether it's the will of God
[2:10:15] or not the next thing is my objective to
[2:10:20] it and my motive in doing it these are
[2:10:24] then if it's the will of God and my
[2:10:27] objective is right and my motive is
[2:10:29] right I have faith that it'll be done
[2:10:33] but you gotta have a right motive and a
[2:10:35] right objective amen because first it's
[2:10:41] the will of God and my objective is to
[2:10:43] glorify Him and my motive is to give him
[2:10:46] all the glory
[2:10:47] see there's no selfish motive about it
[2:10:50] and he said if you have a selfish motive
[2:10:53] it won't work if you got selfish motive
[2:10:57] you won't get resurrection and rap free
[2:10:59] faith no no if your motive is selfish
[2:11:03] and not for the glory of God it's got to
[2:11:06] be for the glory of God
[2:11:09] a man an decent of your objective is to
[2:11:12] make money for yourself or something he
[2:11:14] said you'll never succeed and then try
[2:11:17] to do something outside of the will of
[2:11:19] the Lord
[2:11:19] it won't work to begin with he said the
[2:11:22] first thing he said your achievement is
[2:11:25] only by motive and objective he says
[2:11:28] your motive has got to be right and your
[2:11:31] objective has got to be right in the
[2:11:33] eyes of God not selfish it's got to be
[2:11:38] for the glory of God and if you're a
[2:11:41] motive if your objective is right and
[2:11:43] your motive is wrong he said it won't
[2:11:45] happen amen you have got to have the
[2:11:52] right objective you've got to have the
[2:11:54] right motive and then take it up on the
[2:11:56] leading of the Holy Spirit in your heart
[2:11:58] and stay with it and God will bring it
[2:12:01] to pass
[2:12:02] but you got to have a right motive a
[2:12:04] right objective a right reason and
[2:12:07] purpose for believing what you're
[2:12:09] believing a right reason in the eyes of
[2:12:11] God being here in this word men this
[2:12:14] message in this church but there's too
[2:12:17] many their motives and objectives are
[2:12:20] too selfish and not for the glory of God
[2:12:23] you're just thinking about themselves
[2:12:25] but not the Lord Joe kept his mind on
[2:12:28] the Lord to Joe who was all for the
[2:12:31] glory of God no matter what happened to
[2:12:35] God be the glory amen
[2:12:38] he did not accuse God he didn't put God
[2:12:41] down no matter how hard it became for
[2:12:43] him no he's still reverenced and
[2:12:46] respected God hey man no matter what you
[2:12:51] go through your reverence and respect
[2:12:52] God a man you'll give God the glory why
[2:12:57] because you've experienced the love of
[2:13:00] God you have met God and you've
[2:13:05] experienced his love and His mercy and
[2:13:08] His grace amen
[2:13:09] to God be the glory
[2:13:13] you've got to have the right mode of an
[2:13:15] objective and God will bring it to pass
[2:13:19] he said do you remember him do you love
[2:13:22] him he said Paul said whatever you do we
[2:13:26] do we do in the spirit in all things we
[2:13:30] should remember him if there is a
[2:13:32] decision to be made
[2:13:33] let's wait remember what kind of
[2:13:35] decision we think he would make then let
[2:13:39] that be our decision let him make it and
[2:13:43] it becomes our decision if we get a ste
[2:13:47] let's remember he never was in a hurry
[2:13:50] if we get over anxious remember equals
[2:13:55] in eternity time means nothing to him
[2:13:59] it's the motive and the objective of our
[2:14:03] heart
[2:14:04] he said let's remember him hallelujah
[2:14:11] that's the important thing is to mode an
[2:14:13] objective for the glory of God and
[2:14:15] brother you'll recognize that and he'll
[2:14:17] respect it hallelujah he said we don't
[2:14:22] use the gift of God for commercial no no
[2:14:26] he could tell me where it was that but I
[2:14:28] don't have any need of it I would never
[2:14:31] faith enough to ask him for this or for
[2:14:35] that if I never need of it I believe if
[2:14:39] I'd ask him he'd tell me but first you
[2:14:43] see your motives and objectives has to
[2:14:46] be right you have to have reasons for
[2:14:50] this God don't give you those things
[2:14:52] just because you ask and you cannot ask
[2:14:55] in faith on the stairs our real
[2:14:57] objective to be in the will of God and
[2:15:00] if you want to be well what do you want
[2:15:03] to be well for and if you want to be
[2:15:05] healed what's the reason you want to be
[2:15:08] healed
[2:15:09] what are you telling God what do you
[2:15:12] want to do with your life when you get
[2:15:14] healed he said you've got to have a
[2:15:17] motive and objective and he said they
[2:15:20] have to be right according to the will
[2:15:22] of God and then
[2:15:25] it's when the faith is revealed to you
[2:15:28] and God by his Sovereign Grace places
[2:15:31] that faith in their then it's over but
[2:15:34] you got to have a right motive and a ret
[2:15:36] objective P to be healed a man it has
[2:15:39] got to be for the glory of God if not as
[2:15:41] the Prophet said you can be healed and
[2:15:43] go to hell why because the motive is not
[2:15:46] right and the objective is not right no
[2:15:50] matter what God does you got to have the
[2:15:52] right motive and right objective and in
[2:15:55] this message I'll close it more the
[2:16:00] Prophet did bringing about healing and
[2:16:02] why you want to be healed is it just for
[2:16:05] the sake you want to be healthy or do
[2:16:08] you want to give God the glory a man and
[2:16:11] what there's something else that he
[2:16:14] brings out that God had revealed to the
[2:16:19] prophet and the Prophet had revealed it
[2:16:25] to believers and it was concerning oil
[2:16:33] in Kentucky and he went and he told the
[2:16:38] believers what God had showed him and
[2:16:41] that there was oil here here and there
[2:16:44] and there and there and that they were
[2:16:47] supposed to go and dig the oil wells but
[2:16:52] they didn't respond they didn't respond
[2:16:57] I understand you got to do it in God's
[2:17:01] time and you got to do it with the right
[2:17:03] attitude and you got to have a right
[2:17:05] motive and a right objective but those
[2:17:10] believers and he named their one brother
[2:17:13] that he had told and he said he didn't
[2:17:17] go for a long time where the prophet of
[2:17:21] God said he said there's oil there does
[2:17:24] oil there and is all there and what he
[2:17:29] meant that
[2:17:32] should go and dig the oil wells but they
[2:17:37] waited too long but then there came a
[2:17:42] need and they they felt they needed this
[2:17:47] and they needed that so those brothers
[2:17:49] got together and oh brother Brown said
[2:17:53] there's oil there and oil there so they
[2:17:55] got together and they started to
[2:17:57] purchase land purchased this land and
[2:18:00] this land and they started to make
[2:18:01] agreements with one another we want you
[2:18:03] to agree with us to do this agree with
[2:18:05] us to do that and so on
[2:18:06] and and oh yeah this is this and you'll
[2:18:09] be blessed with this and you'll be
[2:18:10] blessed with that yeah but he said to
[2:18:16] the brother he said brother he said you
[2:18:18] ought to a went a long time ago because
[2:18:21] when they went finally went it wasn't
[2:18:26] there somebody else had gotten into it
[2:18:34] yeah and they got it and they were
[2:18:36] blessed by it but they weren't believers
[2:18:40] but their motive was right and their
[2:18:43] objective was right and their attitude
[2:18:45] was right
[2:18:45] it wasn't selfish no but the believers
[2:18:50] when they got into it and said oh we
[2:18:52] need this and we need that so we should
[2:18:54] do this and should do that and the power
[2:18:56] of God said you ought to have went a
[2:18:58] long time ago but they didn't do it and
[2:19:01] the brother said to brother branham he
[2:19:03] said I made a great mistake by not doing
[2:19:06] that brother branham and he said and
[2:19:08] brother Branham said brother he said if
[2:19:11] you had went down there you would
[2:19:13] haven't all the oil he said but he said
[2:19:19] they wouldn't listen to it so he said
[2:19:24] went to searching for it and said go
[2:19:26] down and tell us where the oil is now
[2:19:30] and brother Brown said no no he said we
[2:19:38] don't use the gift of God for commercial
[2:19:42] what is your motive and objective for
[2:19:44] wanting God's blessings in your life
[2:19:46] it's got to be for the glory of God amen
[2:19:50] not because oh Lord I want you to make
[2:19:52] me rich and I want you to make me this
[2:19:54] and I want you to make me that build me
[2:19:57] up Lord no no escabi for the glory of
[2:19:59] God amen
[2:20:01] what God was doing in jobs life was for
[2:20:03] the glory of God a man oh yes
[2:20:07] job went down God went up in jobs life
[2:20:11] in jobs life a man so he said don't use
[2:20:16] the gift of God for commercial no no he
[2:20:21] said he could tell me where it was but I
[2:20:23] don't have any need of it I wouldn't
[2:20:25] even have faith enough to ask him if I
[2:20:28] had a need of it I believe I'd ask him
[2:20:30] he'd tell me and he said but first you
[2:20:33] see your motives and your objectives as
[2:20:35] to be right why we want it just just to
[2:20:40] be rich oh just to have this just to
[2:20:44] have that Amen oh thank you Lord got no
[2:20:47] worries now you know but God loves those
[2:20:50] things to come test your faith amen and
[2:20:55] brother he told those brothers where it
[2:20:57] was so that way it would meet their
[2:20:59] needs and they would bless them but that
[2:21:02] when they finally decided what they
[2:21:03] wanted to do they wanted to turn it into
[2:21:06] a commercial thing not just a personal
[2:21:09] thing and God was going to bless them
[2:21:10] and through them God would bless others
[2:21:13] and so on no they wouldn't do it they
[2:21:16] waited too long until finally people of
[2:21:18] the world discovered the oil and they
[2:21:22] went and they started to dig the wells
[2:21:23] and then the oil that was down there
[2:21:25] became less a lot less the power God
[2:21:30] said that's your fault he said you
[2:21:32] didn't do when I told you to do it
[2:21:35] and they knew it their motive was wrong
[2:21:37] and their objective was wrong when they
[2:21:39] decided to do it a man he said I
[2:21:44] wouldn't even have faith enough to ask
[2:21:46] him he said you have to have reasons for
[2:21:49] this God don't give you those things
[2:21:51] just because you ask and you cannot ask
[2:21:53] in faith honestly there's a real
[2:21:55] objective to be in the will of God and
[2:21:59] if you want to be well what do you want
[2:22:02] to be well for you want to be healed
[2:22:03] what's the reason and he said what are
[2:22:06] you telling God what do you want to do
[2:22:08] with your life when you get ield what
[2:22:11] are you gonna do with those blessings
[2:22:12] when God blesses you be selfish or it's
[2:22:18] gonna be there to help others and to
[2:22:21] bless others most people have selfish
[2:22:25] motives and selfish objectives that's
[2:22:28] the truth now I know that somebody said
[2:22:32] do you know that there's men there's
[2:22:34] preachers around this message that are
[2:22:36] millionaires
[2:22:38] why because they take all the tithing
[2:22:44] they take it off oh yeah I know there's
[2:22:49] certain places where they have a certain
[2:22:51] box for the tides and the only one with
[2:22:54] a key to that box is the pastor he takes
[2:22:57] all the tithing
[2:22:59] yeah it's wrong motive wrong objective
[2:23:05] brother Brown just took what he needed
[2:23:08] into the tithe and he give he give the
[2:23:10] rest to the other ministers to the
[2:23:11] missions oh yeah that's what he did yeah
[2:23:17] god help us brother we need a right
[2:23:22] motive and a right objective if we got
[2:23:26] the right motor but objective we're
[2:23:27] hearing it the way God wants us to hear
[2:23:29] and see it the way God wants us to see
[2:23:32] amen
[2:23:34] he says you got
[2:23:35] have a motive and objective and they had
[2:23:38] to be right according to the will of God
[2:23:40] and thence when the faith is revealed to
[2:23:43] you and God by his Sovereign Grace
[2:23:45] places that faith in there then it's
[2:23:47] over and he said to make that word true
[2:23:52] when the Brethren got down there one
[2:23:55] fellow went over and brought a bunch of
[2:23:57] stuff sold leases cheated the other one
[2:24:00] this way and he said now you just don't
[2:24:03] make the prophecy Shore within a hundred
[2:24:06] yards of where these men were digging
[2:24:08] there well some man struck the big
[2:24:10] gusher and they lost it those that the
[2:24:16] Prophet Oh lost it the other man got it
[2:24:20] why because they didn't the others
[2:24:22] didn't do it when God told him to do it
[2:24:24] and their motive was right when they
[2:24:26] decided to do it their motive was wrong
[2:24:29] and your objective was wrong and he said
[2:24:34] just don't make the prophecy sure he
[2:24:37] said within a hundred yards of where
[2:24:39] these men were digging there well some
[2:24:41] man struck the big gusher the rest of
[2:24:45] them nearly all dried up everywhere
[2:24:47] through Kentucky but he said because of
[2:24:50] the selfishness that got among it the
[2:24:53] objectives was wrong the signing up of a
[2:24:55] bunch of stuff it would be this way when
[2:24:58] they promised they would do it for the
[2:25:00] kingdom of God but looked like it was
[2:25:02] for themselves not the kingdom of God
[2:25:06] and in one work no selfish thing will
[2:25:10] work your motives and objectives has to
[2:25:13] be exactly perfectly right then he said
[2:25:16] you have faith if our hearts condemn us
[2:25:19] not then we have confidence and we've
[2:25:21] got to have confidence I want this to
[2:25:24] the honor and the glory of God then
[2:25:27] faith a channel to move into if it
[2:25:29] doesn't then you've got mental
[2:25:31] intellectual faith and not genuine faith
[2:25:34] from God that intellectual faith will
[2:25:37] get you nowhere it might get you
[2:25:40] emotional but it won't get you the
[2:25:42] healing you're looking for and that
[2:25:44] intellectual faith didn't get them the
[2:25:46] oil that they went looking for
[2:25:48] they lost it God took it and gave it to
[2:25:53] either make believers or unbelievers
[2:25:56] amazing what is our motive what is our
[2:26:00] objective their motive their objective
[2:26:02] was right but the motive of the
[2:26:04] objective of the believers that the
[2:26:06] proper told was wrong when they decided
[2:26:09] it was wrong it was selfish it was for
[2:26:14] themselves not for the Lord well God's
[2:26:17] gonna bless me so praise the Lord
[2:26:19] hallelujah I'm gonna bless others amen
[2:26:23] God gonna bless me to bless others god
[2:26:25] bless you to bless others amen but too
[2:26:28] many gets so selfish is not blessing
[2:26:30] others is blessing themselves amen
[2:26:33] brother
[2:26:34] God give us the right motive and the
[2:26:37] right objective faith moves in the
[2:26:41] channel of right motives and right
[2:26:44] objectives amen grace of God that's the
[2:26:50] way every believer no matter how bad the
[2:26:53] cancer you got and how long you been
[2:26:56] sitting in a wheelchair just if you
[2:26:58] grasp the revelation from God there then
[2:27:01] be satisfied knowing that it's going to
[2:27:03] happen because faith waste waits
[2:27:05] patiently for the promise and job knew
[2:27:09] that he was right you hear people today
[2:27:12] say I told you look at him he said that
[2:27:15] ain't altogether the truth sometimes
[2:27:17] it's God testing his people and in this
[2:27:20] case it was God testing job he said the
[2:27:23] best man there was on earth at the time
[2:27:25] God was testing him and he knew job was
[2:27:29] a prophet that had a vision from God and
[2:27:31] he had exactly done what God told him to
[2:27:33] do and God was duty-bound to keep his
[2:27:36] promise to him all Christians he said
[2:27:41] has got to be that and when the last
[2:27:44] struggle of lay comes and death rattles
[2:27:47] our in our throat we still must steady
[2:27:51] and remember that God said I'll raise
[2:27:53] you again in the last day amen and Jobe
[2:27:57] knew that regardless of what happened to
[2:27:59] him he knew that God was going to bless
[2:28:00] him
[2:28:01] raising in the resurrection amen brother
[2:28:08] if we got the right motor what objective
[2:28:11] then by the grace of God we're going to
[2:28:13] hear it the way God wants us to hear it
[2:28:15] see it the way God wants to see it we're
[2:28:18] going to act on it the way God wants us
[2:28:19] to act on it by the grace of God let's
[2:28:28] hear it and see it with the right motive
[2:28:30] and a right objective God is challenging
[2:28:35] our faith it's important that we hear
[2:28:37] and see the message the way God wants us
[2:28:39] to hear it and see it but the Lord has
[2:28:42] reminded us that we have to have a right
[2:28:45] motive and a right objective and in the
[2:28:50] message and I have heard but now I see
[2:28:54] the Prophet highlights the revelation
[2:28:56] that to hear and see it according to the
[2:28:59] will of God we have to have right
[2:29:01] motives rights of right objectives and
[2:29:04] what is the right motive right objective
[2:29:06] is that it has to be for the glory of
[2:29:09] God amen everything you do and
[2:29:13] everything you experience you want to
[2:29:15] glorify God amen
[2:29:18] pay attention to the written word pay
[2:29:20] attention to the revealed word and give
