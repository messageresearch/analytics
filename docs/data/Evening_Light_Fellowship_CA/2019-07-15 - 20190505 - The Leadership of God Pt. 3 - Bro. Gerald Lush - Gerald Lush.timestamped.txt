[1:10:01] being led by religious thoughts but
[1:10:03] being led by the by Jesus Christ amen
[1:10:07] not my will father thine be
[1:10:10] done in the Book of Proverbs chapter 3
[1:10:13] and beginning to read at verse
[1:10:16] one
[1:10:19] amen my son forget not my law
[1:10:25] but many that have started in the word
[1:10:28] they have forgotten the word regardless
[1:10:30] of the age regardless of when God come
[1:10:33] on the scene with his word there was a
[1:10:36] time when man
[1:10:38] forgot amen so he said forget not my law
[1:10:42] or my word but he said let thine art
[1:10:45] keep my Commandments stay with the word
[1:10:51] amen for the length of days and long
[1:10:54] life and peace shall they head to thee
[1:10:58] amen that's the significance of staying
[1:11:02] with the word the significance of
[1:11:04] staying under God's
[1:11:06] leadership because it is amen the result
[1:11:10] thereof is length of days and long life
[1:11:13] and peace and they add to thee
[1:11:18] Amen Let not mercy and Truth forsake
[1:11:22] thee
[1:11:24] because you're ignoring it no the
[1:11:27] believer is not ignoring the truth the
[1:11:31] believer is not ignoring Mercy but
[1:11:34] morning noon and night we are conscious
[1:11:36] of the grace of God in the mercy and the
[1:11:40] truth of God so don't forsake his Mercy
[1:11:44] don't forget his Mercy or his
[1:11:47] Truth for nobody and for nothing amen
[1:11:53] but bind them about thy neck
[1:11:57] Amen to let it lead you to let it
[1:12:01] control you amen praise the name of the
[1:12:04] Lord that's why he said bind them above
[1:12:07] their neck so it's in control it's not
[1:12:10] you in control it's mercy and Truth
[1:12:14] praise the name of the Lord it is Mercy
[1:12:16] and truth that leads us and it says and
[1:12:19] write them upon the table of thine heart
[1:12:23] praise the Lord and so shalt thou find
[1:12:28] favor and good understanding thank God
[1:12:31] for the word this is not the wisdom of
[1:12:34] man but this is the wisdom of God Amen
[1:12:38] and it says in the sight of God and man
[1:12:42] Thou shalt find or Thou shalt yes find
[1:12:46] favor and good understanding in the
[1:12:49] sight of God and man but again again go
[1:12:53] back to the other the other verses to
[1:12:56] find out how you're going to find favor
[1:12:59] and good understanding in the sight of
[1:13:01] God Amen you got to keep it in your mind
[1:13:06] keep it in your heart to constantly be
[1:13:09] mindful of what God has done and what
[1:13:12] God is doing and you will find favor and
[1:13:15] good understanding in the sight of God
[1:13:18] and man verse five trust in the Lord
[1:13:22] with all thine heart
[1:13:24] not many are trusting God Amen they
[1:13:28] trust man they trust the thoughts of man
[1:13:31] the ideas of man but who is trusting God
[1:13:33] and who's trusting the word brother I
[1:13:36] pray Grace that we have the faith that
[1:13:39] God that pleases God so trust in the
[1:13:43] Lord with all thine art not just a
[1:13:46] little here and a little there but trust
[1:13:48] in the Lord with all thine
[1:13:50] heart
[1:13:51] Grace and lean not onto thine own
[1:13:56] understanding and we have too much of
[1:13:58] that mixture of faith and human
[1:14:02] understanding amen Faith it's God the
[1:14:07] human understanding is the devil
[1:14:10] remembering that God God's is in the
[1:14:13] heart and the only sense that God uses
[1:14:16] is Faith but the devil is using the
[1:14:19] flesh amen and his Watchtower is your
[1:14:22] mind
[1:14:24] reasoning amen so trust in the Lord with
[1:14:28] all thine heart and lean not unto thine
[1:14:31] own understanding be led by the spirit
[1:14:35] the spirit of God and not the devil in
[1:14:39] all thy ways in all thy ways acknowledge
[1:14:43] Him and He Shall direct thy path in all
[1:14:48] thy ways acknowledge Him and he'll Lead
[1:14:50] You Amen in Paths of right rightousness
[1:14:53] for his name's sake praise the name of
[1:14:56] the Lord so again in all thy ways
[1:14:59] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[1:15:03] paths be not wise in thine own
[1:15:07] eyes fear the lord and depart from evil
[1:15:12] God bless his words you may be
[1:15:17] seated be not wise in thine own eyes but
[1:15:20] fear the lord and depart from evil
[1:15:24] because brother that's where the enemy
[1:15:26] deceived Eve is giving her not godly
[1:15:31] wisdom but ungodly wisdom he says you
[1:15:34] shall be as Gods knowing this because it
[1:15:36] was a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:15:39] so they ended up with a wisdom but not
[1:15:41] the wisdom we needed and thank God for
[1:15:44] the Plan of Redemption that he's going
[1:15:46] to take it take us take it away from us
[1:15:49] amen by by the by the grace of God so
[1:15:53] God help us brother is our prayer that
[1:15:55] we're going to
[1:15:56] partake of the righteousness of God turn
[1:16:00] with me to Luke Chapter
[1:16:05] N St Luke's gospel chapter
[1:16:12] n and beginning to read at verse
[1:16:22] 57
[1:16:25] and it came to
[1:16:27] pass that as they went in the way a
[1:16:30] certain man said unto him Lord I will
[1:16:34] follow thee withs soever thou
[1:16:38] goest he said I'll follow your
[1:16:41] leadership amen and Jesus said unto him
[1:16:45] foxes have
[1:16:47] holes and birds of the air have Nest but
[1:16:51] the son of man that's not where to lay
[1:16:54] his
[1:16:55] head amen he was challenging that
[1:16:59] brother's
[1:17:00] Faith to follow him and to follow his
[1:17:04] leadership because challenging because
[1:17:07] even maybe that brother's emphasis was
[1:17:11] on natural
[1:17:13] things and what what he would possess
[1:17:16] naturally maybe believing that God was
[1:17:18] going to bless him if I follow Jesus God
[1:17:21] was going to bless me more
[1:17:23] amen but you follow Jesus that maybe
[1:17:26] God's going to take it away from you
[1:17:29] amen that's that's that's the what what
[1:17:31] God does sometimes it is a challenge to
[1:17:33] our faith so that our faith is not in
[1:17:35] what we possess our naturally our faith
[1:17:38] is in what we possess spiritually our
[1:17:41] faith is not in the Natural Things of
[1:17:43] life but the spiritual things of life
[1:17:45] that our faith is not in the devil and
[1:17:47] what the devil can do and what the devil
[1:17:49] can give us but our faith is in what God
[1:17:51] has done and what God is is doing Amen
[1:17:54] brother the grace of God to have the
[1:17:57] faith of God Amen the grace of God to
[1:18:00] have faith in God and he said and Jesus
[1:18:04] said unto him foxes have holes the birds
[1:18:07] of the air have Nest but the son of
[1:18:09] manath not where to lay his head you
[1:18:13] want to follow somebody like
[1:18:16] that the idea of man today would that
[1:18:19] that person is stupid that person does
[1:18:22] doesn't have any any any any good ideas
[1:18:24] or any any wisdom if they had wisdom
[1:18:27] they they wouldn't be in that condition
[1:18:30] we think well if this brother is good or
[1:18:32] that sister is good they're going to be
[1:18:34] out there they're going to get
[1:18:35] themselves a good job they're going to
[1:18:37] they're going to have money they're
[1:18:38] going to have a nice home they're going
[1:18:40] to have nice clothing and so on but
[1:18:42] sometimes your brother if you're
[1:18:43] following God God takes it from from us
[1:18:46] because what is it it is a test of our
[1:18:48] faith amen so that we our faith is not
[1:18:52] in not in world possessions our faith is
[1:18:54] not in this world and the and what's in
[1:18:56] this world our faith is in in the world
[1:18:59] to come our faith is in glory our faith
[1:19:01] is in eternity our faith is in heaven
[1:19:04] our faith is in the new Heaven and the
[1:19:06] new Earth and that is more real to us
[1:19:09] than the than the one that we are living
[1:19:11] in now oh brother I pray that I pray
[1:19:13] that that is true that the new Heaven
[1:19:15] and the new Earth and Eternity is more
[1:19:18] real than time and that when what we are
[1:19:20] experiencing in time but unfortunately
[1:19:24] there are too many Bel so-called
[1:19:25] Believers that are living in time and
[1:19:28] they are living for time and what they
[1:19:29] are experiencing in time what they find
[1:19:32] in time what they can see in time but I
[1:19:35] tell you this brother we're trying to
[1:19:36] get rid of time and we're trying to get
[1:19:38] rid of R of the emphasis on what time is
[1:19:40] giving us what for us so to put more and
[1:19:43] more emphasis on what what eternity is
[1:19:46] and what what God in eternity has
[1:19:48] promised for us amen oh no wonder again
[1:19:52] uh let me repeat that scripture that
[1:19:54] straight is the gate now is the way that
[1:19:57] leadth into life and few there be that
[1:19:59] find it and it's eternal life so where
[1:20:02] our focus is not on on natural life our
[1:20:05] focus is not on this life our focus is
[1:20:07] on eternal life amen so straight is the
[1:20:11] gate to eternal life narrow is the way
[1:20:13] and few there be that find it and we
[1:20:16] understand and we remember the the dream
[1:20:19] that the that brother bram's Mother I
[1:20:21] think his mother had the dream
[1:20:23] and and in the dream was brother Brandon
[1:20:25] was standing at at at at the road
[1:20:28] leading to eternal life amen and and
[1:20:32] this sister came up and she had on these
[1:20:35] I heel shoes and the problem of God he
[1:20:37] said sister he said you can't walk that
[1:20:40] path he said with those shoes oh yes she
[1:20:42] said I can and she said that that'll be
[1:20:45] no problem why the Propet of God said
[1:20:47] she she didn't see it the way that God
[1:20:49] wanted her to see it amen and the father
[1:20:53] of God has has has reminded us of the
[1:20:55] message he said it's not striking you
[1:20:58] the way that it should amen amen why why
[1:21:02] because if it did it would give us the
[1:21:04] faith that that that God had in it the
[1:21:07] faith for the Resurrection the faith for
[1:21:09] healing the faith for salvation the
[1:21:11] faith to get out of this world and get
[1:21:13] into the world to come amen but and we
[1:21:16] got to do it God's way not our way we
[1:21:18] got to follow God's leadership and not
[1:21:21] the devil's leadership we got to follow
[1:21:23] God's leadership by faith and brother it
[1:21:26] is not the devil's leadership by
[1:21:27] intellectual reasoning amen but this
[1:21:30] this sister there with her high heels on
[1:21:33] and and she stood she stood at the
[1:21:35] beginning of this road into eternity and
[1:21:37] there were three steps leading up to the
[1:21:40] path and she and and it was about I
[1:21:43] guess maybe 2 or three feet wide right
[1:21:46] here and and she thought well well if
[1:21:49] she got way down there it would still be
[1:21:51] 2 or 3T wide
[1:21:53] and that she had no problem to go up to
[1:21:55] the three the three steps of
[1:21:57] justification sanctification and the
[1:22:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:22:03] prophet of God said no sister you're not
[1:22:06] going to make it with those shoes on and
[1:22:08] she said get out of my way and he just
[1:22:11] he just stepped aside and let her and
[1:22:13] let her get on the path but he know he
[1:22:17] knew that she wasn't going to make it he
[1:22:18] told her he tried to warn her and
[1:22:20] brother and God is telling us with
[1:22:22] whether or not we can make it how we can
[1:22:24] make it or or if we get we get caught up
[1:22:26] with this we're not going to make it God
[1:22:28] knows brother and that's what the that's
[1:22:30] what the ministry is there for is the
[1:22:32] perfecting of the Saints the perfecting
[1:22:35] of the Revelation the perfecting of our
[1:22:37] wisdom and our understanding so it's not
[1:22:39] human wisdom human understanding it's
[1:22:41] Godly amen so that we're going to see it
[1:22:44] as God sees it amen and brother and not
[1:22:47] and see the thing is this that we're not
[1:22:49] going to look at the path and say well
[1:22:51] and we're we're going going to make
[1:22:53] decisions and we're going to decide this
[1:22:54] we're going to what is God's leadership
[1:22:56] and we got to come back to his word to
[1:22:58] find God's Will and God's leadership
[1:23:01] what does God want me to do and how does
[1:23:03] God want me to do it when does he want
[1:23:05] me to do it where does he want me to do
[1:23:07] it amen and I don't I don't have to have
[1:23:10] understanding of it I just have to have
[1:23:11] the Revelation that it's God Amen I
[1:23:15] don't Lord why this why that listen
[1:23:18] Faith believes God Amen not it's not
[1:23:21] it's not it comes to the understanding
[1:23:24] of this and why this and why that and
[1:23:26] why that no it's understanding what it
[1:23:29] is is it the will of God I'm he's not
[1:23:32] going to give us understanding of what's
[1:23:33] going to happen how it's going to happen
[1:23:35] all these things we just believe God God
[1:23:37] said with his stripes I am healed well
[1:23:41] how you do that Lord can you explain
[1:23:43] that to me well with his word well Lord
[1:23:47] no can you give me more scientific
[1:23:50] explanation no no if you got faith fath
[1:23:52] amen you just believe God and you go on
[1:23:55] Hallelujah there is too many trying to
[1:23:58] reason it out there's to many too many
[1:24:00] trying to figure it out even when it
[1:24:02] comes to the resurrection and the
[1:24:04] Rapture even when it comes to the to to
[1:24:06] to Salvation we want to figure out this
[1:24:09] and figure out that brother it is not by
[1:24:11] intellectual knowledge and human
[1:24:14] understanding it is it is by faith
[1:24:16] believe God Amen the same as as God
[1:24:20] required in the Garden of Eden God is
[1:24:22] requiring
[1:24:23] now and he said if you do this if you do
[1:24:26] that he said he said You shall surely
[1:24:29] die amen well Lord uh explain it to me
[1:24:33] no God didn't explain it and they didn't
[1:24:35] ask God to explain it they believed it
[1:24:38] under the devil came and be to inject
[1:24:41] his ideas into it and and to inject his
[1:24:44] thoughts into it amen in the tree of
[1:24:47] knowledge of Good and Evil amen so
[1:24:51] brother and sister listen
[1:24:53] I pray God that none of us are in in
[1:24:55] this in part of this assembly here
[1:24:57] across the island I trust that no one
[1:25:00] are online I trust that nobody is what
[1:25:03] is going by sight faith not not Faith
[1:25:06] but sight and reasoning you know what
[1:25:08] what you what you understand naturally
[1:25:10] what you figure out I I'm going to do
[1:25:12] this I'm ain't going to do that amen and
[1:25:14] and you think it's God's will when it's
[1:25:16] the devil amen see God never explained
[1:25:20] it to to Adam and Eve he just told them
[1:25:23] and they believe God Amen so God is not
[1:25:26] explaining all that he has done and what
[1:25:28] he is doing concerning the resurrection
[1:25:30] Rapture but brother he has told us and
[1:25:33] and we believe it amen how God how is
[1:25:35] God going to do it that's God's business
[1:25:38] amen he he is God it's his power it's
[1:25:42] his anointing it's a it's the Holy Ghost
[1:25:44] in US amen now but but again explain it
[1:25:48] scientifically I don't need it to
[1:25:50] explain scientifically Amen in the
[1:25:53] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:25:55] Earth period amen praise the name of the
[1:25:58] Lord father the Propet of God said he
[1:26:00] said he said the Bible and true science
[1:26:04] he said does agree together blend
[1:26:07] together that's the truth because
[1:26:09] science things that God took all of this
[1:26:11] time they they they don't believe the
[1:26:13] Bible because they they think in the
[1:26:14] Bible all God took six days to make the
[1:26:18] make to make the Heaven and the Earth no
[1:26:21] no
[1:26:23] Bible didn't say that the Bible says in
[1:26:25] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[1:26:27] the Earth that's right period it didn't
[1:26:29] say how long he took amen and it could
[1:26:32] have been it could have been a million
[1:26:34] years it could have been it could have
[1:26:35] been six million years we don't know but
[1:26:38] we know that something happened but then
[1:26:40] God came down and it took 6,000 years to
[1:26:43] do what one day with the Lord has a
[1:26:44] thousand years a thousand years in one
[1:26:47] day and God be to renew the Earth
[1:26:50] because it was in this condition in that
[1:26:52] condition he did this he did this he did
[1:26:54] this amen and then he created man and
[1:26:57] put him on the earth amen so true
[1:27:00] science and the and the true revelation
[1:27:03] of the word are are in agreement amen so
[1:27:06] brother we're not we're not looking for
[1:27:09] the the science of the devil that's what
[1:27:11] that's what the the devil came down to
[1:27:13] give it give to Eve Thou shalt not
[1:27:15] surely die amen and he began to explain
[1:27:18] this to her and that to her why it it
[1:27:21] was human knowledge human scientific
[1:27:24] amen and it was Satan's influence but by
[1:27:28] the grace of God brother as it was then
[1:27:30] so it is now when we're not looking with
[1:27:32] a scientific explanation we're going to
[1:27:34] believe
[1:27:35] God Amen as Adam and Eve believe God we
[1:27:39] believe God as Adam and Eve trusted God
[1:27:42] or Adam did and so we're going to trust
[1:27:44] God Amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:27:48] amen remember Enoch trusted God and
[1:27:50] believed God and he went on into the
[1:27:52] resurrection he went Resurrection but on
[1:27:54] into the Rapture he was changed
[1:27:57] absolutely and completely amen bless it
[1:28:00] be the name of the Lord and now we are
[1:28:02] the seven from the second Adam so
[1:28:04] brother and sister I trust that we have
[1:28:06] the faith that Enoch had amen I trust
[1:28:08] that we believe God as Enoch believ God
[1:28:11] I trust that we are walking with God as
[1:28:13] Enoch walked with God not walking with
[1:28:15] the world not walking with the
[1:28:16] foolishness of the world but we're
[1:28:18] walking with God Amen and if we walk
[1:28:21] with God Hallelujah and the faith of God
[1:28:24] it it'll bring us separation from the
[1:28:26] world and the things of the world you're
[1:28:28] not going to be caught up with the world
[1:28:30] or the things of the world but you're
[1:28:31] going to get more and more and more
[1:28:34] caught up with God more and more caught
[1:28:37] up with with with the promise of God and
[1:28:40] and oh brother what is it is getting
[1:28:42] back where we come fromen amen
[1:28:45] hallelujah if there anything that I want
[1:28:48] anything that I need is to get back into
[1:28:51] eternity is to get back into that new
[1:28:54] Heaven and new earth it is to get back
[1:28:56] with God and again and brother and
[1:28:58] sister all the saints of God in eternity
[1:29:01] by the grace of almighty God oh it's
[1:29:03] going to be a wonderful world and we
[1:29:05] think this world is wonderful oh brother
[1:29:08] and sister I pray God we're not going to
[1:29:10] be we're not going to be the ones that
[1:29:11] are left behind looking for a Rapture
[1:29:13] that we
[1:29:14] missed amen but again the people are are
[1:29:17] enjoying this world more and more
[1:29:19] they're getting more and more caught up
[1:29:21] with this world
[1:29:22] and they're getting more and more caught
[1:29:23] up with the foolishness of this world
[1:29:26] and they're putting more and more
[1:29:27] emphasis on what what is in this world
[1:29:30] and you know what what the enemy is
[1:29:32] there trying to make you believe oh this

[1:29:38] this and still you know believe believe
[1:29:42] in God yeah but remember this the devil

[1:29:50] just just believing in God doesn't make
[1:29:52] you a Christian no no it's believing
[1:29:55] God it's one thing to believe in God is
[1:29:58] another thing to believe God Amen so I

[1:30:03] going to believe God Amen that we're
[1:30:07] going to stay with the word of God Amen

[1:30:11] back by the grace of almighty God so
[1:30:15] brother let's father let's stay under
[1:30:17] his leadership not the leadership of man
[1:30:19] not the leadership of this world not the
[1:30:21] leadership of our minds not the
[1:30:23] leadership of our feelings but we're
[1:30:25] going to amen amen amen amen oh brother
[1:30:29] the vast majority and not not just the
[1:30:32] world over there but the vast majority
[1:30:35] of believers they they're they're
[1:30:37] believing in their senses they're
[1:30:38] believing in their in their intellect
[1:30:40] they're believing in their reasoning and
[1:30:42] their feelings but not their
[1:30:45] faith amen the the the word the word is
[1:30:49] to them it it is the letter and it is is
[1:30:52] mechanics but it is not

[1:31:06] mechanics just the letter of the word
[1:31:08] and there's too many going by the letter
[1:31:10] of the message but not the letter of the
[1:31:12] word amen because because they believe
[1:31:15] that oh this is this if it's God God is
[1:31:18] going to bless me if it's God God is
[1:31:20] going to do this God is going to do that
[1:31:22] yeah but what God does is going to be
[1:31:24] according to his word amen not going to
[1:31:27] be according to to the Natural Things of
[1:31:29] Life it'll be number one it's going to
[1:31:31] be spiritual God is going to focus on
[1:31:33] the spiritual not the natural amen
[1:31:36] remember it's the devil that focuses on
[1:31:39] the on the natural and the devil wants
[1:31:41] us to get caught up with the natural
[1:31:43] things but God wants to get caught up
[1:31:45] with the spiritual amen if we're cut up
[1:31:48] with the spiritual the spiritual is
[1:31:49] going to catch us up amen into eternity

[1:31:55] believing at this moment are we
[1:31:57] believing God or the devil are we
[1:31:59] believing in eternity or time are we
[1:32:02] focused on on time or eternity by the
[1:32:05] grace of almighty God I trust that it is

[1:33:46] you're not going by faith amen as I was
[1:33:50] saying about Eve in the garden
[1:33:52] and she went from Faith to sight she
[1:33:55] went from Faith to feelings she went
[1:33:57] from Faith to just intellectual
[1:34:00] reasoning the enemy be to get her to
[1:34:02] reason over this and to get her to get
[1:34:04] her from reasoning into her senses and
[1:34:08] this was you you read this the the
[1:34:10] devil's revealed to Eve that oh it was
[1:34:14] good for food it was pleasant to the
[1:34:16] eyes and it was a thing that desired to
[1:34:18] make one wise and so on so he was he was
[1:34:21] he was moving on her senses amen God God

[1:47:04] right in Israel he was the leader of
[1:47:07] Israel but he was saying this was all
[1:47:09] right that was all right and Elijah the
[1:47:11] prophet was there uh preaching against
[1:47:14] it amen and they hated
[1:47:18] him amen
[1:47:20] they hated him because the greater
[1:47:24] majority in in Israel was following
[1:47:26] ahab's
[1:47:27] leadership not the prophet's leadership
[1:47:30] not God's leadership and the prophet but
[1:47:32] they're following ahab's leadership
[1:47:34] because ABAB was under the
[1:47:37] influence of his of his Queen Jezebel
[1:47:44] amen and she was she
[1:47:46] was an
[1:47:49] idolator oh yeah yeah she was she was of
[1:47:51] a false religion she wasn't a Jew but
[1:47:54] ABAB went out and he wanted her and he
[1:47:58] went out and he had or yeah went out and
[1:48:00] one this one and so on yeah and he
[1:48:05] said he said he said this is all right
[1:48:08] because his wife thought it was all
[1:48:11] right
[1:48:19] oh
[1:48:21] he says it right here don't don't mean
[1:48:22] to be rude or or
[1:48:25] whatever but he said I got to tell you
[1:48:27] the
[1:48:28] truth that's right he did say this is a
[1:48:31] woman's
[1:48:33] World sisters if there's anyone that
[1:48:35] need to beyond their guard and to get
[1:48:37] into the faith of God is the
[1:48:40] sisters that's
[1:48:44] right that's right one time the man
[1:48:47] reigned and ruled but now the sisters r
[1:48:50] Reign and Rule and and more and more
[1:48:53] women are getting involved in in the
[1:48:55] politics more and more women are getting
[1:48:57] involved in everything out
[1:48:59] there
[1:49:02] yeah well I tell you I pray God in the
[1:49:05] name of the Lord that our sisters are
[1:49:06] going to come under the faith of the
[1:49:08] revealed
[1:49:09] word
[1:49:11] amen but AB he said he thought he said
[1:49:15] because his wife thought it was all
[1:49:17] right and he he also accepted it amen
[1:49:20] and Israel accepted it and the vast
[1:49:24] majority was following it and getting
[1:49:28] into
[1:49:30] idolatry and he said they caused a moral
[1:49:33] Decay and then he said they thought
[1:49:35] because they were prosperous and he said
[1:49:38] no Wars no forth and so forth and he
[1:49:41] said that was the sign that God was with
[1:49:43] them that's what they
[1:49:45] thought but what it was they were
[1:49:49] compromising
[1:49:51] Jezebel influenced aab to compromise
[1:49:54] with this compromis with this nation and
[1:49:56] that nation and this Kingdom and that
[1:49:57] Kingdom
[1:50:00] amen allow this in Israel allow that in
[1:50:04] Israel the UN the influence of
[1:50:09] Jezebel no one and she hated
[1:50:13] Elijah yet the power of God said she
[1:50:16] didn't accept it but he said Elijah was
[1:50:17] her
[1:50:19] pastor
[1:50:21] he said but she wouldn't accept it until
[1:50:24] finally the prophecy came that the dogs
[1:50:26] would eat her
[1:50:28] flesh and it
[1:50:30] did
[1:50:31] Amen brother let's stay with the word
[1:50:35] amen stay with God stay with the the the
[1:50:38] faith that God has and God is revealing
[1:50:42] amen amen amen list oh brother sister in
[1:50:45] the name of the Lord that we're not
[1:50:47] going to go back as they did in Luther's
[1:50:49] day W day the Salvation Army day and the
[1:50:52] Pentecostal age that go back to just a
[1:50:55] form of
[1:50:57] godliness yeah but denying the
[1:51:01] power brother if you're denying the
[1:51:04] power now you're denying the power of
[1:51:06] the
[1:51:06] Resurrection denying the power of the
[1:51:09] Rapture that's why a lot of people are
[1:51:10] denying and that's why they're going to
[1:51:12] miss it they denied the power of
[1:51:15] justification in Luther's day Wesley's
[1:51:17] day and and in other ages and the
[1:51:19] Pentecost denied the power of the
[1:51:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and
[1:51:24] denying the gifts that's why there's
[1:51:26] that's
[1:51:29] gone
[1:51:31] Amen brother of what it is the
[1:51:35] influence of another spirit it's the
[1:51:37] leadership of another Spirit they they
[1:51:40] got away from God's leadership to man to
[1:51:42] the to man's leadership and the man was
[1:51:45] under the influence of the
[1:51:48] devil Grace it's see now this is serious
[1:51:53] now you'll prefer maybe a preacher to
[1:51:55] get up here and make you laugh and and
[1:51:58] do this do oh yeah that's good we that's
[1:52:00] what God did we're saved we're this
[1:52:03] we're that we got to face
[1:52:07] reality we got to face the challenges of
[1:52:10] the
[1:52:12] devil
[1:52:13] amen so that God so that the devil is
[1:52:16] not going to deceive us into thinking
[1:52:18] we're all right when we're not
[1:52:22] oh yeah you better make sure you're
[1:52:25] right making your calling and election
[1:52:27] sure is to make sure you're under the
[1:52:29] right
[1:52:32] leadership
[1:52:34] amen and he says so he said oh he
[1:52:38] thought it was all right because his
[1:52:40] wife thought it was all right and he
[1:52:42] said they thought because they were
[1:52:43] prosperous and there was no Wars and so
[1:52:46] forth and he said that was a sign that
[1:52:49] God was is with them but he said
[1:52:51] Prosperity is not always
[1:52:55] understand Prosperity is not always the
[1:52:58] sign that God is with
[1:52:59] you many times that's
[1:53:03] deceiving oh well this worked out and
[1:53:05] that worked out so it must be the Lord
[1:53:09] no come back to the
[1:53:11] word see if you're still in line with
[1:53:13] the word make sure that there's no
[1:53:17] compromise but there's many doing it
[1:53:20] believing well I if I was at the will of
[1:53:23] God God wouldn't do this no the devil
[1:53:24] did
[1:53:27] it the devil did
[1:53:29] it they don't think go the devil will do
[1:53:32] this they don't think the devil can do
[1:53:33] this they think it's only God no devil
[1:53:35] can prosper you oh
[1:53:38] yeah he said the prosperity is not all
[1:53:41] not always the say that God is with you
[1:53:44] and he said many times that's deceiving
[1:53:48] why he said the rain falls on the just
[1:53:52] and the
[1:53:53] unjust amen but it's their by their
[1:53:57] fruits they are
[1:54:00] known amen are you getting more
[1:54:04] spiritual or more
[1:54:07] kind that's the difference God help
[1:54:15] us and so he said this
[1:54:18] nation was was really corrupted and God
[1:54:21] sent judgment upon Israel and all the
[1:54:24] preachers had bent under the heavy load
[1:54:29] because the members of the church had
[1:54:31] forced them to do
[1:54:35] things
[1:54:40] amen yeah the preachers in
[1:54:44] Israel the
[1:54:47] Levites they come under the influence of
[1:54:49] the people because the the the the force
[1:54:52] of the
[1:54:53] people so that what did what did the
[1:54:55] Levites do they just they just bowed
[1:54:58] down and said okay and they allowed this
[1:55:01] and allowed that allowed something else
[1:55:03] and there's many a message preacher
[1:55:04] that's allowing this allowing that and
[1:55:07] brother there there's preachers out
[1:55:09] there in the
[1:55:11] in in in in the Lutheran Church and so
[1:55:15] on that Luther started and they're
[1:55:18] allowing things Luther would never allow
[1:55:21] or Wesley would never allow for sure
[1:55:24] amen or the old fashioned salvations
[1:55:26] would never
[1:55:27] allow because I I've got I've got
[1:55:29] sermons by by the founders of the
[1:55:32] Salvation Army there back way back in in
[1:55:35] the late 1800s or early 1900s and and
[1:55:39] they saw worldliness creeping into the
[1:55:41] church there and they said
[1:55:44] sisters what you need to do is you need
[1:55:46] to start in your
[1:55:48] closet start your repentance in your
[1:55:50] closet
[1:55:52] amen yeah well that's that's what they
[1:55:55] were preaching because they and and they
[1:55:57] got to the finally came to the place and
[1:55:59] says you know what our problem is we
[1:56:01] need what they had on the day of
[1:56:04] Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:08] amen and then came came the Pentecostal
[1:56:11] Revival amen God was calling for it
[1:56:15] remember what the prophet said he said
[1:56:16] before God does anything he'll send the
[1:56:18] holy ghost ahead in the people he said
[1:56:21] to create a hunger and a thirst for amen
[1:56:24] for what he's going to do amen and
[1:56:27] brother what's he going to do he's the
[1:56:30] resurrection and Rapture so he's
[1:56:31] creating a hunger and a thirst in us for
[1:56:33] the resurrection and the Rapture amen
[1:56:35] many got a hunger and a thirst for the
[1:56:37] resurrection and Rapture not a religious
[1:56:39] thought not a Doctrine no no it's a
[1:56:43] hunger and a thirst it's a power it's an
[1:56:45] anointing that you're craving for the
[1:56:48] resurrection and the rapture
[1:56:50] Saints it's not just let being religious
[1:56:53] and going and oh wait waiting waiting
[1:56:55] waiting waiting waiting waiting no God's
[1:56:58] waiting on you he already he already
[1:57:01] sent the anointing he already sent the
[1:57:03] power he already sent the Holy Ghost he
[1:57:05] already revealed the word the mystery of
[1:57:07] God to create in us the hunger and
[1:57:10] thirst for the Rapture for the
[1:57:13] resurrection I tell you it's
[1:57:17] finished it's finished beyond your CU
[1:57:19] it's getting
[1:57:21] worse you know the world's worse you
[1:57:24] know there's no more hope in the
[1:57:26] world it's not going to get any it's not

[1:58:42] know why because you don't recognize the
[1:58:45] character there's no
[1:58:48] character it's it's the spirit of
[1:58:51] insanity one time they they just stood
[1:58:54] for stood for what we felt oh that's
[1:58:57] good yeah that's that's that's
[1:58:58] reasonable that's sensible not anymore

[1:59:23] real Faith that's in the
[1:59:28] bride it's getting
[1:59:30] serious father God said you the hours

[1:59:54] there when I go to my grave but he
[1:59:57] wouldn't tell us what it
[2:00:00] was I believe it what he saw in the
[2:00:02] future
[2:00:04] coming and you and I are witnessing
[2:00:07] it
[2:00:13] amen Grace because there's going to be
[2:00:15] so few most churches are going to go The
[2:00:19] Way of the World there'll still be
[2:00:22] churches but the greater the greatest
[2:00:25] influence is going to be the
[2:00:27] world
[2:00:30] Amen because the preachers are going to
[2:00:35] compromise and they are
[2:00:38] compromising just think there is
[2:00:40] churches out there they got atheist
[2:00:46] preaching and you mean tell me that's
[2:00:48] not in
[2:00:52] sanity atheist
[2:00:54] preaching yeah but what is it to them
[2:00:57] it's a
[2:00:59] job so to them all they got to do is
[2:01:02] read read this book and and and and
[2:01:04] they'll study it and and see what ideas
[2:01:07] they can come up with and and go out and
[2:01:09] and and preach it to the people but
[2:01:11] they're not going to preach for an hour
[2:01:12] or two hours or they that they'll preach
[2:01:13] for maybe 20 minutes 25
[2:01:18] minutes
[2:01:20] I was shocked when somebody said oh they
[2:01:23] got atheists preaching in that
[2:01:29] church you think it ever come to the
[2:01:31] place where we have atheists
[2:01:34] preaching the
[2:01:36] message I did mention I think to brother
[2:01:38] Bob that some time ago that I was going
[2:01:40] through some quotes and uh from some
[2:01:43] older messages and I said what that the
[2:01:47] Propet of god mentioned something about
[2:01:49] God's going to let it go on and on and
[2:01:51] on he said tell what for the trial of
[2:01:54] our faith our belief in
[2:01:58] God oh and then I heard about this
[2:02:01] atheist
[2:02:03] preaching how many Believers believe in
[2:02:07] God if they don't believe God they don't
[2:02:09] believe in
[2:02:17] God I tell you is there
[2:02:20] ever hard and difficult time for
[2:02:22] preacher for preachers that are called
[2:02:24] of
[2:02:25] God it's this
[2:02:29] our because we're seeing we're seeing
[2:02:32] what the others are not
[2:02:36] seeing and I tell you the preachers that
[2:02:38] are called of God they're not going to
[2:02:41] be elevated they're going to be bu
[2:02:43] they're going like Elijah they're going
[2:02:44] to be put
[2:02:46] down
[2:02:47] yeah and like Elijah they went out
[2:02:54] and to the
[2:02:59] Wilderness why because they because
[2:03:02] there are so few Believers in Israel
[2:03:05] Elijah didn't think there was any
[2:03:08] there and and what did Elijah say to God
[2:03:11] when God called him Elijah said Lord he
[2:03:13] said let me die he said I'm worse worse
[2:03:16] than my
[2:03:17] fathers help
[2:03:22] Grace that's how bad it's going to get
[2:03:25] in for for the for the
[2:03:27] Gentiles oh no that was just Israel no
[2:03:31] no it's going to get the same way
[2:03:35] here in this
[2:03:37] world Listen the preachers they bent
[2:03:40] under the heavy load and there's many
[2:03:43] preachers bending under the heavy load
[2:03:46] today you pressure because this is what
[2:03:50] people want the bride wants Resurrection
[2:03:52] rapturing
[2:03:53] Faith but there's others just want
[2:03:56] preach this preach this encourage us you
[2:03:58] know with with this Revelation that
[2:04:00] Revelation make us feel good no no the

[2:04:23] age this is not the Pentecostal age this
[2:04:26] is the bright age this is the most
[2:04:29] serious
[2:04:30] hour
[2:04:35] amen he said the preachers have been
[2:04:38] under the heavy load because the members
[2:04:39] of the church had forced them to do
[2:04:42] these
[2:04:43] things because that's what the members
[2:04:45] of the church
[2:04:47] wanted he said I feel sorry for a
[2:04:51] preacher that's got no more God about
[2:04:54] him than to let his congregation dictate
[2:04:57] to him and get him off in a
[2:04:59] rut he said I believe that we need
[2:05:02] preachers that's men that's God-fearing
[2:05:05] godsent servants who he said who's not
[2:05:08] afraid to call wrong wrong and right
[2:05:12] right amen he said the gospel has been
[2:05:15] handled too much now with kid gloves
[2:05:19] and he said what we need is some
[2:05:21] oldfashioned preaching he said like
[2:05:24] Billy Sunday John the Baptist and he
[2:05:26] saids some of them oldfashioned Hellfire
[2:05:29] and brimstone messages again he said
[2:05:32] back to the people he said I know he
[2:05:35] said that's not
[2:05:36] popular but
[2:05:39] brother it'll bring the bride under the
[2:05:41] leadership of the Holy Ghost most
[2:05:45] definitely as it is written in the word
[2:05:47] It Is by grace through faith that we are
[2:05:50] saved amen not of ourselves it is the
[2:05:54] gift of
[2:05:56] God faith is God's
[2:06:00] leadership amen you're living by
[2:06:04] faith not by sight what God
[2:06:09] reveals is God's
[2:06:11] leadership you're doing what
[2:06:14] God's revealing to you you're going to
[2:06:17] do it God's way God's time and so on for
[2:06:20] the glory of God but for your
[2:06:23] salvation and for the change of our
[2:06:28] bodies and remember again that faith is
[2:06:31] God's leadership that it's not you it's
[2:06:33] God's gift to you to Lead You In Paths
[2:06:37] of righteousness for his name's sake
[2:06:41] amen the bride shares the name of the
[2:06:45] bridegroom
[2:06:47] amen turn with me to Psalms chapter

[2:24:18] and was made in the likeness of men
[2:24:23] amen and being found in fashion as a man
[2:24:28] he humbled

[2:24:57] his leadership you're not dead to
[2:24:59] yourself yet God help

[2:25:24] showed you a picture
[2:25:27] before this we got to take up our cross
[2:25:30] and follow
[2:25:32] him but it's like
[2:25:36] the the drawings that somebody drove one
[2:25:39] time that they were they were walking
[2:25:42] with the cross on their
[2:25:44] shoulder yeah and there was some there
[2:25:49] they said oh it's too
[2:25:53] heavy oh and it stopped and went and and
[2:25:57] saw
[2:25:58] off a large portion of the Cross so it
[2:26:02] be
[2:26:03] lighter others was trying to wouldn't do
[2:26:06] it no we need this
[2:26:09] cross and so they kept on walking the
[2:26:11] other ones that haded cut off it was
[2:26:14] easier for them it was lighter but then
[2:26:17] all of a
[2:26:18] sudden they
[2:26:23] came to a place in their walk with
[2:26:27] God and it was going from one part of
[2:26:30] the cliff or the walkway to another
[2:26:33] because there was a big gap there in the
[2:26:37] Rock how are we going to get across
[2:26:41] here oh those that those that that kept
[2:26:44] the cross the way that God wanted it
[2:26:46] they took the cross and they lifted it
[2:26:49] up and they laid it down and it it went
[2:26:52] from one side to the other and they
[2:26:54] walked AC cross on the cross picked up
[2:26:57] the cross and kept on going but the ones
[2:27:00] that cut their cross off shortened their
[2:27:03] cross shortened their
[2:27:05] burden oh their cross was too
[2:27:10] short and they couldn't they couldn't go
[2:27:13] from one side to the
[2:27:15] other amen and there are those that can
[2:27:18] only go so far as a Christian and they

[2:38:37] our hearts a revelation of
[2:38:39] redemption of the price that was paid
[2:38:43] for our

[2:38:48] none righteous know not
[2:38:50] one amen except our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:38:54] and you know what he took upon himself
[2:38:57] our
[2:38:58] unrighteousness amen and he shed his
[2:39:02] sinless blood and he laid down his life
[2:39:05] so he could pick it up and share that
[2:39:08] share that righteousness with us that
[2:39:11] imputed righteousness of our Lord Jesus
[2:39:13] Christ but this was the price that was
[2:39:16] paid he

[3:35:41] had gotten my address and he came to
[3:35:44] visit me and see if he could get a copy
[3:35:46] of the book I never had any copies of
[3:35:48] that book left that we printed but I
[3:35:51] gave him other copies and he had made
[3:35:54] contact with me when he went to western
