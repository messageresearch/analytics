[1:12:53] to lead them the way and by night in a
[1:12:57] pillar of fire to give them light to go

[1:26:22] Pentecost there were Pentecostals that
[1:26:24] they really thought that oh the
[1:26:27] Pentecostal Revival back in the early
[1:26:28] 1900s they thought the Pentecostal
[1:26:30] Revival was going to take them on to the
[1:26:32] coming of the Lord no because by God

[1:26:36] of the word

[1:27:03] dead amen and finally he preached the
[1:27:06] truth
[1:27:08] amen he preached he got their attention
[1:27:11] before for the hearing of the word

[1:27:26] when he went forth with signs and
[1:27:27] wonders oh amen he had the hundreds and
[1:27:30] the thousands they were following his
[1:27:32] ministry but then he spoke the word
[1:27:35] yeah amen because he remember the the
[1:27:37] three Bulls and the first poll was to
[1:27:40] get to her two pools were to get their
[1:27:41] attention
[1:27:42] but the third pull was to give him the
[1:27:44] word amen amen amen they wanted more
[1:27:48] signs and wonders but they didn't want
[1:27:49] the word yeah amen but he caught the
[1:27:52] attention of the Bride
[1:27:53] amen the bride believes the word we're
[1:27:55] not following the signs and wonders
[1:27:57] we're following the word amen and by the
[1:28:00] grace of God that designs and wonders of
[1:28:01] resurrection and Rapture will follow us
[1:28:04] amen by the grace of God Amen he went
[1:28:08] through the prophet of the hour and
[1:28:09] through the anointing of the messenger
[1:28:11] of that age and this age amen and he and
[1:28:14] he did these signs and wonders oh my
[1:28:16] what and and he got the attention of of
[1:28:18] Christians around the world as it were
[1:28:21] but then when he gave them the word
[1:28:24] they wanted them to come oh let's get
[1:28:27] get rid of Brandon to come and do this
[1:28:29] and do this but don't don't get him to
[1:28:31] preach

[1:28:33] that was their attitude after
[1:28:35] he began to minister the word of God to
[1:28:37] him Amen brother oh yeah they wanted the
[1:28:41] faith to believe for this the faith to
[1:28:42] believe for that and that yeah but God
[1:28:45] was God Amen God through the messenger
[1:28:48] of the error was giving us the word to
[1:28:50] give us the faith for the resurrection
[1:28:52] the faith for the Rapture amen they
[1:28:55] thought well as long as we believe this
[1:28:57] we believe that or we'll be in the
[1:28:59] resurrection no
[1:29:01] you've got to follow God's leadership

[1:29:05] leadership into the Rapture amen you're
[1:29:07] not you know oh you're oh well the
[1:29:09] Revival the Pentecost revolver the gifts
[1:29:11] of the Spirit and we feel this and we
[1:29:13] feel that oh that's good wonderful amen
[1:29:15] but they didn't focus on the
[1:29:17] resurrection yeah yeah they didn't focus
[1:29:19] on the rapture amen says and God said
[1:29:22] the messenger of the hour God said the
[1:29:24] message of the earth amen amen thank God
[1:29:27] for what he did but in this last last
[1:29:29] stage it was to focus our attention on
[1:29:31] the rapture
[1:29:33] pose our attention on the resurrection
[1:29:35] amen now many of us today are looking
[1:29:38] for the resurrection and the news today

[1:30:08] are we looking for the resurrection oh

[1:30:20] waiting on us
[1:30:22] are we are we ready
[1:30:24] for them to come to us because the
[1:30:26] prophet of God did say the dead in
[1:30:28] Christ are going to appear to the living
[1:30:29] Saints and he said we're going to be
[1:30:31] caught and changed and go into that
[1:30:33] Dimension with them and he said we're
[1:30:35] going to have fellowship and he did say
[1:30:37] this somewhere he said we're going to
[1:30:39] have Fellowship he said we'd be around I
[1:30:40] think he said 30 40 days and then he
[1:30:43] said we're going to look up there's
[1:30:45] Jesus

[1:31:00] more into the revelation of what God is
[1:31:03] doing
[1:31:04] not what he's done what he's doing
[1:31:07] we know what he did in sending the
[1:31:09] prophet we know what he did in revealing

[1:33:43] because I tell your brother when when
[1:33:45] God came down and they know you're the
[1:33:46] Holy Ghost and Luther's hour with the
[1:33:48] revelation of justification
[1:33:50] morning noon and night that's all they
[1:33:52] were thinking about oh yeah brother
[1:33:54] sister whenever they got together as
[1:33:56] saints of God oh they were thinking oh
[1:33:58] you we he's Justified us he's Justified
[1:34:00] praise the Lord amen amen because why
[1:34:04] because for years Luther was teaching
[1:34:05] you had to do this you had to do that he
[1:34:07] believed this the church believed this
[1:34:09] that you had to do these things to be
[1:34:10] justified Amen to finally Luther went
[1:34:13] into the church and there was a Bible in
[1:34:16] in the best tribute and and they opened
[1:34:18] the Bible oh there it is
[1:34:20] Romans
[1:34:22] he says you as he justified
[1:34:25] amen Jesus is our justification
[1:34:28] amen that's drunk loser
[1:34:31] oh what a revelation Amen brother that's
[1:34:35] what started the Lutheran Revival
[1:34:38] amen it was the revelation of the word
[1:34:41] and it was amen and when that preacher
[1:34:43] was preaching that Revelation Amen in a
[1:34:45] cottage meeting and brother and John
[1:34:47] Wesley was there amen they were
[1:34:50] preaching the revelation of
[1:34:51] justification by faith it struck John
[1:34:53] Wesley oh praise the Lord we're
[1:34:55] Sanctified by faith
[1:34:57] amen oh he raised his hands he was he
[1:35:01] was standing in the in the back there of
[1:35:03] the of the of the cottage meeting amen
[1:35:05] thank you Lord hallelujah I'm Justified
[1:35:07] amen Jesus has Justified me right
[1:35:10] because John Wesley thought dude he had
[1:35:12] to go do this he had to do that he had
[1:35:14] to do that look forward to justify
[1:35:15] himself
[1:35:16] no no you will do it but it'll prove
[1:35:19] God's justification
[1:35:22] now what you did is what God has done
[1:35:24] amen amen it's not what we've done it's
[1:35:27] what Jesus has done amen concerning even
[1:35:29] the resurrection concerning the Rapture
[1:35:31] amen because Jesus was resurrected Jesus
[1:35:33] was raptured amen amen God help us to
[1:35:37] believe believe the word of God Amen

[1:35:47] [Music]
[1:35:48] amen you got this knees you got that
[1:35:51] Nate speak the word amen amen amen
[1:35:54] because God is in his word amen
[1:35:57] say with the word
[1:36:00] amen and the prophet of God did say he
[1:36:01] said Lord he said Thy word lays open on
[1:36:04] the pulpit and realizing that someday
[1:36:07] it'll be closed for his last time then
[1:36:10] the word will be flesh
[1:36:13] amen
[1:36:14] tiger entered into an absolute complete
[1:36:16] Oneness with the word amen so that you
[1:36:19] become the word in flesh
[1:36:21] Amen brother we are the word in flesh
[1:36:25] but we're moving on to a greater
[1:36:27] Perfection amen amen even as Jesus went

[1:36:32] go on to a glorified body amen by the
[1:36:35] grace of God Amen
[1:36:38] so he said listen he said then the word
[1:36:40] will be flesh and then he said we're
[1:36:42] grateful for this time this morning and
[1:36:45] open to us by the Holy Spirit he said
[1:36:47] the contents of this word that we shall
[1:36:50] read and he said May the Holy Spirit
[1:36:52] teach us today he said the things that
[1:36:55] we ought to know
[1:36:57] and he said and may we then in return
[1:37:00] listen closely to every word
[1:37:03] amen
[1:37:05] it's not just to believe this or God
[1:37:07] isn't a prophet and and God revealed
[1:37:09] this Doctrine to that doctrine that
[1:37:11] Doctrine but what faith is it given you
[1:37:15] what faith is God working on
[1:37:17] what faith did he work on in Luther's
[1:37:19] hour justification
[1:37:21] he wanted to get the people to believe
[1:37:23] that they didn't have to do these works
[1:37:24] and these works and they're Justified no
[1:37:27] they had to believe in the in the
[1:37:28] finished works of Calvary that's right
[1:37:30] amen Jesus Justified him oh brother
[1:37:34] Hallelujah do you have the faith of
[1:37:37] justification
[1:37:38] do you have the faith of sanctification
[1:37:42] amen do you have the faith of the
[1:37:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of
[1:37:46] the Spirit amen oh yeah the public
[1:37:49] officer they're still there
[1:37:50] and he said we have access to them
[1:37:53] you know
[1:37:54] and every day we need that that
[1:37:56] anointing
[1:37:58] there's not a day
[1:38:00] not an hour there's not a situation or
[1:38:02] circumstance but we need the anointing
[1:38:05] amen we need to be able to call on the
[1:38:07] Lord I mean he would be able to believe
[1:38:09] the Lord you're with me
[1:38:11] and you are in me
[1:38:13] amen that you are in him but he's in you
[1:38:17] amen Amen brother sister is the proud of
[1:38:20] God we got to be in him and in Christ in
[1:38:22] us and Jesus and the prophet of God
[1:38:25] didn't warn us he said remember he said
[1:38:26] you can you can have Jesus in your flesh
[1:38:29] he said 24 hours a day and he said hey
[1:38:32] go to hell
[1:38:33] but you've got to have him in your heart
[1:38:36] in your soul amen so Christ in you
[1:38:40] you in Christ
[1:38:42] crazier than you you're in Christ the
[1:38:44] word amen amen praise the name of the
[1:38:47] Lord hallelujah if I just oh I I feel
[1:38:50] Grace and I feel this and I feel that no

[1:38:56] you are in Christ the word amen and you
[1:38:59] go forth as the word of God Amen
[1:39:02] by the grace of God
[1:39:04] so he said listen he said maybe then in
[1:39:06] return listen closely to every word
[1:39:09] amen and weigh it deeply and may those
[1:39:14] who are listening by the way of the tape
[1:39:16] he said may they listen close and may we
[1:39:19] be able to catch what the holy spirit is
[1:39:21] trying to reveal to us amen for we
[1:39:25] realize if you should anoint us then the
[1:39:27] anointing is not in vain it's for a
[1:39:30] purpose that it might work to go to the
[1:39:32] good to the Lord
[1:39:34] Amen brother is a reason so as God
[1:39:37] accomplishing his reason and his purpose
[1:39:39] in you on a daily basis the life you
[1:39:42] live is a reflecting God's purpose
[1:39:45] amen Where's God working on in you
[1:39:47] brother it's not just not just to make
[1:39:49] us different from the churches out there
[1:39:51] or this group or that group
[1:39:54] no
[1:39:55] brother is to it's to turn us from time
[1:39:57] to Eternity
[1:39:59] what God is doing is to take us out of
[1:40:01] time and into eternity
[1:40:03] amen what God is doing is to make us
[1:40:06] less and less conscious of time and more
[1:40:09] conscious and convicted of Eternity
[1:40:12] we're coming home Lord
[1:40:14] amen look up
[1:40:17] look up you're going home God help us
[1:40:21] Brothers not focused on Natural Things
[1:40:23] oh my Lord my Lord my Lord I trust by
[1:40:26] the grace of God that our spiritual
[1:40:28] family is more important than our
[1:40:29] natural family
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:32] but yet still there's too many so-called
[1:40:35] Believers are caught up too much with
[1:40:36] their natural families
[1:40:38] but not the spiritual
[1:40:40] God help us
[1:40:42] amen
[1:40:43] brother it shows again we're born again
[1:40:48] if you're not born again you're caught
[1:40:50] up with the natural
[1:40:51] if you are born again you're caught up
[1:40:53] with spiritual
[1:40:58] God give us the evidence
[1:41:01] that we're born again
[1:41:03] that will go forth and live the life
[1:41:04] that we're born again
[1:41:06] amen you are going to hunger for what
[1:41:08] for what God wants to Stronger for
[1:41:10] thirst for what God wants to thirst for
[1:41:12] we're going to feed on what God wants us
[1:41:14] to feed on
[1:41:15] amen praise the Lord oh yes because I've
[1:41:19] been challenged down Through the Ages
[1:41:21] you know and even by certain family
[1:41:23] members oh you're you're always with
[1:41:26] them you know and when when he comes oh
[1:41:29] you'll go right on past the house and
[1:41:31] you'll go right on down to that house
[1:41:33] down there and so on a believer's house
[1:41:38] oh yeah
[1:41:39] certain family members who come jealous
[1:41:42] why because they add more attention more
[1:41:45] of our attention than they did
[1:41:47] that's the truth
[1:41:49] and brother sister is still even a lot
[1:41:51] of Believers that they're caught up with
[1:41:53] their natural more caught up with the
[1:41:54] natural family than they are the
[1:41:55] spiritual
[1:41:57] God help us
[1:41:59] amen
[1:42:01] brother Jesus wasn't caught up with this
[1:42:02] natural family
[1:42:04] he was kind of he was caught up with his
[1:42:06] Spirituals
[1:42:07] to the extent that he laid his life down
[1:42:10] for them
[1:42:11] are you going to lay down your life for
[1:42:13] your spiritual Sons and Daughters right
[1:42:16] or your brothers and sisters

[1:42:27] got children to raise them up in the way
[1:42:28] they should go
[1:42:29] amen that they're going to see your the
[1:42:31] the the
[1:42:32] emphasis you're putting on your
[1:42:34] spiritual
[1:42:35] not the natural
[1:42:37] and yet there's parents that are putting
[1:42:39] just
[1:42:40] more and more it's just on this on the
[1:42:41] natural oh just on the spiritual you
[1:42:44] know when we go to pray or when we go to
[1:42:46] go to church no no
[1:42:48] your your relationship morning noon and
[1:42:51] night is to be spiritual
[1:42:53] influenced by the Holy Ghost when you
[1:42:55] rise in the morning to when you go to
[1:42:57] bed at night it's all under the
[1:42:59] anointing of the Holy Ghost

[1:43:14] Gospel don't be ashamed of your
[1:43:17] relationship with Jesus
[1:43:20] amen
[1:43:21] brother and I know that again that's why
[1:43:24] a lot of the Believers down Through the
[1:43:26] Ages I've rejected is because they're
[1:43:28] putting more and more answers on
[1:43:29] Believers Believers Believers believers
[1:43:31] or they treat the natural family pie and
[1:43:33] I'm sorry the Lord bless you and and
[1:43:35] you're good to them and so on but your
[1:43:39] your fellowship you want more and more
[1:43:41] fellowship with believers for sake not
[1:43:43] the Assembly of yourselves together and
[1:43:46] more much more as you see the day
[1:43:48] approaching
[1:43:50] amen with with your spiritual Brothers
[1:43:53] and Sisters in Christ
[1:43:55] amen
[1:43:57] and I know Lord and I know that
[1:44:01] I've had I've had to bear that reproach
[1:44:02] for many years where people just felt
[1:44:05] that I was I was more caught up with
[1:44:07] Believers Believers Believers wherever
[1:44:08] there's Believers that's where we met
[1:44:10] that's where we went yeah
[1:44:13] because the natural family felt oh well
[1:44:17] I thank God for the respect my natural
[1:44:19] family gave for me even though I put
[1:44:22] more and more answers on on my brothers
[1:44:24] and sisters in the word in the message
[1:44:27] oh yeah thank God
[1:44:30] that's what God requires
[1:44:32] not only that now God requires it but if
[1:44:35] you've got the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:44:36] you'll do
[1:44:38] and you've got the Holy Ghost In Your
[1:44:39] Heart oh yeah that's the life you'll
[1:44:42] live
[1:44:43] you're not living for your natural
[1:44:44] family you're living for your spiritual
[1:44:48] it's not your natural mom and dad that
[1:44:50] you thank God for them and respect them
[1:44:51] amen but you want to give more answers
[1:44:54] to your spiritual
[1:44:57] our heavenly father
[1:44:59] amen
[1:45:01] amen because the natural is passing away
[1:45:03] but the spiritual goes on to Eternity
[1:45:05] amen amen God help us that's right
[1:45:07] that's right Amen brother brother sister
[1:45:10] and again there there are and I know
[1:45:12] over the years I've made a number of
[1:45:13] Believers there was more and more caught
[1:45:15] up with the natural family
[1:45:17] yeah and less with the spiritual
[1:45:20] God help us
[1:45:23] amen
[1:45:25] he said again he said they made the Holy
[1:45:27] Spirit he said teach us today the things
[1:45:31] we ought to know
[1:45:33] amen
[1:45:35] and may we then in return listen closely
[1:45:38] to every word
[1:45:40] and weigh it deeply
[1:45:42] amen
[1:45:45] and then he said May those who are
[1:45:46] listening by way of a tape he said may
[1:45:48] they listen close and may we be able to
[1:45:51] catch what the holy spirit is trying to
[1:45:53] reveal to us
[1:45:54] what's he trying to reveal to you today
[1:46:01] he said before we realize if we if you
[1:46:04] should anoint us then the anointing is
[1:46:06] not in vain it's for a purpose that it
[1:46:09] might work to the good
[1:46:11] of the Lord
[1:46:13] amen
[1:46:16] is it working to the good of the Lord to
[1:46:18] be a witness for Jesus morning noon and
[1:46:20] night amen
[1:46:24] and he said may we have the freedom to
[1:46:26] speak the freedom to hear and access to
[1:46:29] Faith to believe what we have heard amen
[1:46:32] as it comes from God's word
[1:46:35] amen
[1:46:37] and that it might count up to us eternal
[1:46:40] life in the great day that is to come
[1:46:42] bless us today Lord and he said condemn
[1:46:44] us when we're wrong yes
[1:46:48] the Lord is there to convict you if
[1:46:50] you're going to step out of line
[1:46:52] but are you there to receive that
[1:46:54] conviction
[1:46:55] are you there to acknowledge that
[1:46:57] conviction
[1:47:00] and just don't think oh my Lord help us
[1:47:03] don't think if if you're doing something
[1:47:05] and there's a conviction comes on you
[1:47:07] don't think well that's the devil
[1:47:09] no it might be the Lord
[1:47:12] might be the Holy Spirit
[1:47:15] don't blame it on the devil
[1:47:20] just make your calling no wonder the
[1:47:23] Bible told us
[1:47:24] make your calling and your election sure
[1:47:29] amen
[1:47:30] make sure that your anointing is God
[1:47:33] not the devil that's right because
[1:47:36] there's a false anointing
[1:47:40] make sure your Revelation is God not the
[1:47:43] devil that's right oh yeah
[1:47:46] Satan is going to agree with it but
[1:47:49] yes God said but
[1:47:52] yeah
[1:47:53] he agreed the message
[1:47:55] that's right oh yeah yeah here's the
[1:47:56] prophet said but yeah
[1:47:58] yeah forget the butts
[1:48:00] amen
[1:48:02] believe the word
[1:48:04] stay with the word regardless of the
[1:48:06] price you gotta pay
[1:48:09] amen
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:10] regardless of the sacrifice that God is
[1:48:12] going to require of you stay with the
[1:48:14] word
[1:48:15] amen I tell you you stay with the word
[1:48:18] I'll tell you more and more we stay with
[1:48:19] the word the greater and greater the
[1:48:21] separation that we'll experience
[1:48:24] when it comes to family friends and
[1:48:26] neighbors all due respect but again stay
[1:48:29] with the word
[1:48:31] God help us
[1:48:33] yes amen

[1:59:04] there was Bloodshed in the garden
[1:59:08] because and it was the result of of sin
[1:59:14] result of that sin
[1:59:19] most people are not aware of that
[1:59:21] no
[1:59:23] they didn't shed no blood they did
[1:59:29] sin and a testified of their sin
[1:59:34] God help us

[1:59:40] not others to believe
[1:59:42] God help us to stay with the word
[1:59:44] God I would stay with the truth amen
[1:59:48] not man's stories of
[1:59:51] a man Veil and how man went into sin no
[1:59:54] no man's oh we met he wouldn't eat this
[1:59:56] fruit he wouldn't eat that he shouldn't
[1:59:58] have done it no
[2:00:00] you need to take it a little further
[2:00:02] than that
[2:00:04] God help us
[2:00:10] he said the word of the Lord is so great
[2:00:14] the word of the Lord is so good there's
[2:00:15] just no way to stop reading it
[2:00:19] he said it just becomes Life as we read
[2:00:22] it
[2:00:23] amen
[2:00:25] listen
[2:00:27] he said I think in this text this
[2:00:29] morning
[2:00:32] he said I'm just going if your Lord
[2:00:34] willing to speak upon
[2:00:36] this because it drives me down and I
[2:00:40] hope it drives all of us down
[2:00:42] that we might see and cause us to look
[2:00:45] up and study a little bit in comparing
[2:00:47] the day that was then onto the day that
[2:00:50] is now
[2:00:52] they dealt with sin then we're dealing
[2:00:54] with sin now
[2:00:58] he said why cry speak the word
[2:01:03] why Christ thou unto me speak to the
[2:01:06] people that they go forward
[2:01:09] and listen
[2:01:11] in this text he said Moses crying out to
[2:01:14] God in the time of trouble
[2:01:16] and God rebuking Moses back right when
[2:01:19] trouble was in session
[2:01:21] and it's just nature seeming like for a
[2:01:25] person to cry out and then what a rebuke
[2:01:28] it is for God to turn around and rebuke
[2:01:30] him
[2:01:31] for crying out to him it looks like it's
[2:01:34] a very hard thing
[2:01:37] but he said many times when we look at
[2:01:39] the scriptures in our own way of looking
[2:01:42] it seems very hard but if we study a
[2:01:45] little while we find out that all the
[2:01:48] all-wise God knows just what he's doing
[2:01:51] and he knows how to do these things and
[2:01:54] how to deal with man he knows what's in
[2:01:56] man he knows him we don't
[2:02:00] we only know from the intellectual side
[2:02:03] but God knows what's really in the man
[2:02:08] amen he does
[2:02:10] and God knows what's really in you God
[2:02:13] knows what's really in me
[2:02:15] he does
[2:02:17] your feelings your emotions your
[2:02:19] thoughts
[2:02:22] your revelation
[2:02:24] or lack of Revelation
[2:02:27] God knows
[2:02:30] he said Moses was born in this world as
[2:02:32] a gifted boy and he was born to be a
[2:02:35] prophet a deliverer he was born with the
[2:02:37] equipment born in him
[2:02:40] as every man that comes into the world
[2:02:42] is born with this equipment amen you're
[2:02:45] born with the equipment to fulfill God's
[2:02:49] purpose
[2:02:51] God's purpose in your life
[2:02:54] it's there if you let God in
[2:02:58] too Quicken it
[2:02:59] [Music]
[2:03:01] amen make it alive
[2:03:04] amen hallelujah
[2:03:06] amen and brother if your seed of God the
[2:03:09] anointing comes in the united quickens
[2:03:10] it
[2:03:12] they do not see to God there's not
[2:03:13] nothing that that seed is not there no
[2:03:16] it won't Quicken you
[2:03:19] a person can be religious but not
[2:03:20] spiritual
[2:03:22] but if your seed of God you're spiritual
[2:03:25] hallelujah amen
[2:03:27] amen
[2:03:30] he said listen
[2:03:33] he said as I firmly believe in the
[2:03:35] foreknowledge of God
[2:03:37] the predestination not that God is
[2:03:39] willing that any should perish but all
[2:03:42] might come to repentance but being God
[2:03:44] he had to know and does know the end
[2:03:46] from the beginning
[2:03:48] amen he isn't then he said he if he
[2:03:51] doesn't then he isn't infinite
[2:03:54] and if he's not infinite he's not God
[2:03:58] so he wasn't willing certainly that any
[2:04:01] should perish but he knowing who would
[2:04:04] perish and who would not perish
[2:04:06] and that's the very purpose that Jesus
[2:04:08] came to the Earth was to save those that
[2:04:10] God
[2:04:11] through foreknowledge seeing that wanted
[2:04:14] to be saved
[2:04:16] God knows whether or not you want to be
[2:04:17] saved
[2:04:19] in your seat of God you have the hunger
[2:04:22] and thirst for salvation
[2:04:24] you want to be saved and that's why the
[2:04:27] Savior was that came that's why he was
[2:04:30] sent
[2:04:33] he said that's the very purpose that
[2:04:35] Jesus came to the Earth was to save
[2:04:37] those that God through is for knowledge
[2:04:39] seen that wanted to be saved
[2:04:43] Grace
[2:04:44] amen
[2:04:49] bear with me a moment
[2:04:52] he said there's only one covering for
[2:04:54] sin and that is the blood of Jesus
[2:04:56] Christ
[2:04:57] and it cannot be applied unless God has
[2:05:00] called you from the foundation of the
[2:05:02] world
[2:05:03] amen
[2:05:05] and he said that's what the blood was
[2:05:07] shed for
[2:05:09] not to be tramped upon made fun of
[2:05:12] he said evil is spoken of he said it was
[2:05:15] for a direct purpose not to be played
[2:05:18] with
[2:05:18] not to be impersonated by saying that
[2:05:21] the sins are covered when they are not
[2:05:26] and he said no man can have his sins
[2:05:28] covered lest his name was put on the
[2:05:31] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:05:34] foundation of the world
[2:05:37] amen
[2:05:38] Hallelujah
[2:05:42] thank God
[2:05:44] Amazing Grace amen
[2:05:47] amen Amazing Grace that our names were
[2:05:50] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:05:53] foundation of the world
[2:05:55] testifying that we were redeemed before
[2:05:58] the foundation of the world
[2:06:01] amen
[2:06:04] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[2:06:08] my father draws you
[2:06:10] and all that the father has given me
[2:06:13] past tense
[2:06:15] he said will come to me
[2:06:18] so you can't make the words lie they are
[2:06:21] there for truth and for correction
[2:06:24] and Moses was born with a gift of faith
[2:06:27] great faith Moses had and he said we see
[2:06:30] it after a while coming out in him in
[2:06:33] Moses faith
[2:06:35] he said he was strictly a type of our
[2:06:38] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:06:40] amen
[2:06:41] he was born in a very odd birth like the
[2:06:45] Lord Jesus he was born in a time of
[2:06:48] persecution like the Lord Jesus
[2:06:51] he was born to be delivered as a
[2:06:53] deliverer like our lord Jesus he was Aid
[2:06:57] of his parents away from the enemy like
[2:07:00] the Lord Jesus amen
[2:07:04] he was
[2:07:05] hid of his parents away from the enemy
[2:07:08] and he said and he come to his time of
[2:07:11] service like the Lord Jesus he was a
[2:07:14] leader like the Lord Jesus Moses he was
[2:07:18] a prophet like the Lord Jesus
[2:07:21] amen
[2:07:23] and he said he was a lawgiver like our
[2:07:26] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:07:29] he said he died on the Rock and he must
[2:07:32] have rose again because 800 years later
[2:07:35] he was standing on the Mount of
[2:07:37] transfiguration talking to Jesus
[2:07:41] amen where did he come from
[2:07:45] oh Moses you're dead no
[2:07:47] he was dead
[2:07:49] he appeared on the mount and he was
[2:07:51] talking to Jesus
[2:07:53] amazing
[2:07:55] amen
[2:07:57] see he said the Angels packed him away
[2:08:00] and no one knows where he's buried even
[2:08:03] the devil didn't know and he said
[2:08:05] frankly I don't believe he or he ever
[2:08:08] was buried I believe that God packed him
[2:08:11] away and he died on the Rock and he had
[2:08:14] followed all the days of his life
[2:08:17] he was a perfect type of Christ amen
[2:08:22] and he says he was born with this great
[2:08:24] gift and quality within him amen and
[2:08:28] then it was only taken something to
[2:08:29] flash across to bring that thing to life
[2:08:32] see the seed of God is actually placed
[2:08:36] in us from the foundation of the world
[2:08:39] amen and when that light that strikes
[2:08:42] the seed it brings it to life but the
[2:08:44] light first has to come upon the seed
[2:08:47] amen grace of God to us thank God
[2:08:51] for the experience that we have
[2:08:54] testifying
[2:08:56] of our relationship with God
[2:08:59] Hallelujah
[2:09:07] he said I have taught it many times of
[2:09:09] the little woman at the well
[2:09:11] though she be an ill-famed person
[2:09:14] and though her life was degraded and she
[2:09:17] was at in that condition
[2:09:19] because that tradition had never touched
[2:09:21] her but though when that light first
[2:09:24] struck her quickly she recognized it
[2:09:28] because there was something there to
[2:09:30] respond to it
[2:09:32] and brother is there something in you to
[2:09:34] respond to the light
[2:09:37] to respond to the word
[2:09:39] that is not you in your head
[2:09:42] but is God in your heart
[2:09:45] it's your it's you on the inside of the
[2:09:48] inside
[2:09:50] there's too many got it up here but they
[2:09:52] don't have it down here
[2:09:54] that's why the prophets had added it up
[2:09:57] here and he says well you can have God
[2:09:58] he said 24 hours a day he said in your
[2:10:00] life amen and go to hell
[2:10:04] if it's in your heart no no
[2:10:06] you won't go to hell
[2:10:09] yeah you're going to go to Glory
[2:10:11] you go to heaven
[2:10:13] you've got to go go to be with Jesus
[2:10:17] amen
[2:10:17] because it's on the inside of the inside
[2:10:22] amen
[2:10:29] these are in deep calls to the Deep
[2:10:31] there must be a deep to respond to that
[2:10:34] call
[2:10:35] amen and Moses here was born this
[2:10:38] prophet he was raised in an intellectual
[2:10:41] school and a Pharaoh's Palace the
[2:10:44] Pharaoh said he that he was raised up
[2:10:46] under it was a man that still had honor
[2:10:49] and believed Joseph being the prophet of
[2:10:51] the Lord but there came Ramesses after
[2:10:55] seti and did not care about Joseph
[2:10:59] and so therefore there's when the
[2:11:01] trouble started when they are raised up
[2:11:04] a pharaoh who did not know Joseph
[2:11:07] God
[2:11:11] just
[2:11:13] a couple more quotes
[2:11:16] he said Moses being born with this great
[2:11:18] gift of faith
[2:11:20] then he was anointed and commissioned at
[2:11:22] the burning bush
[2:11:24] to deliver God's people
[2:11:26] now he says see what great qualities
[2:11:28] this man had he was born for a certain
[2:11:31] thing and God had a purpose he said
[2:11:34] God's got a purpose of you being here
[2:11:37] he had a purpose in Moses he got a
[2:11:40] purpose in you
[2:11:42] and if you can only get to that place
[2:11:44] how much trouble you save God and
[2:11:47] yourself
[2:11:48] amen
[2:11:50] Amen to serve God's purpose
[2:11:56] it's a tremendous challenge to our faith
[2:11:58] are you are you serving God's purpose
[2:12:06] be being here today
[2:12:09] are you serving gospel
[2:12:13] that's right amen
[2:12:15] there's a reason
[2:12:18] amen
[2:12:25] he said listen
[2:12:32] Moses he was born
[2:12:35] brought to the place where he was
[2:12:36] anointed
[2:12:37] and noticed a seed laying there with the
[2:12:40] intellectual conception with all Faith
[2:12:43] he was born to deliver this people
[2:12:45] and yet it never come to life until that
[2:12:49] light from the burning bush flashed
[2:12:51] across it
[2:12:52] and not something he read about but
[2:12:55] something he'd seen with his eyes
[2:12:57] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[2:13:00] back
[2:13:03] and I think he said in the intellectual
[2:13:05] conception of what they think the word
[2:13:07] is is and so forth never can have a full
[2:13:12] Foundation stand until they have met
[2:13:16] that light that brings the word to
[2:13:18] reality
[2:13:20] amen
[2:13:22] he said I think no church in its
[2:13:25] practice no matter our intellectual and
[2:13:28] fundamental it might be that church
[2:13:30] cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is
[2:13:33] made known among that people
[2:13:35] amen something they can talk to that'll
[2:13:38] talk back to them that'll vindicate his
[2:13:41] written word
[2:13:43] amen amen
[2:13:50] he's speaking of the burning bush
[2:13:52] he said Moses knew this intellectually
[2:13:57] he said and the seed that was born in
[2:14:00] him was laying in his heart
[2:14:02] and he tried through his intellectual
[2:14:04] experience with the word to try to bring
[2:14:06] out to deliver them because he knew he
[2:14:09] was born for that purpose
[2:14:11] amen he knew that the time the scripture
[2:14:14] all said that they'd already been there
[2:14:17] 400 years just as we know now as a man
[2:14:21] asked me a few moments ago about the
[2:14:23] coming and the rapture
[2:14:27] and listen to what he said
[2:14:29] he said we know we have lived the time
[2:14:32] out
[2:14:34] and if we live the time out in July 1963
[2:14:38] where are we today
[2:14:42] where are we today
[2:14:46] 2022.
[2:14:53] amazing
[2:15:00] it's amazing
[2:15:02] I was born in 1948.
[2:15:07] that's when the angel came to the
[2:15:09] prophet
[2:15:10] he said well thank the Lord
[2:15:18] the grace of God to us
[2:15:20] that after all these years that we're
[2:15:22] here believing the word
[2:15:24] after all these years we're here
[2:15:26] acknowledging the gods sent a prophet
[2:15:33] he said listen just as we know know now
[2:15:36] as a man asked me a few moments ago
[2:15:38] about the coming and the rapture we know
[2:15:40] we have lived the time out and the time
[2:15:43] of the Rapture is at hand
[2:15:46] if it's that and then if it's at and now
[2:15:49] surely now
[2:15:52] well you say oh many it's many years
[2:15:55] brother Gerald
[2:15:57] yes
[2:15:58] to us it's it's many years but to God is
[2:16:01] is very little time
[2:16:08] there are too many that are judging will
[2:16:11] judge it
[2:16:12] by time as as a human
[2:16:15] but let's judge it by time
[2:16:17] spiritually
[2:16:20] oh brother it's been all these years 50
[2:16:22] odd years since he said this
[2:16:26] yes that's right but in the eyes of God
[2:16:29] but at just a moment
[2:16:32] not much
[2:16:34] 50 years is not much time
[2:16:39] there's too many Believers are
[2:16:40] discouraged
[2:16:42] because this was 1963 and we're still
[2:16:46] here
[2:16:48] there's many so-called Believers feel
[2:16:50] that oh no it couldn't it couldn't have
[2:16:52] been the Lord
[2:16:54] must have been just William Branham
[2:16:57] no no
[2:17:01] all those years is not much in when it
[2:17:03] comes to God
[2:17:05] no
[2:17:09] he said we're looking for a rapturing
[2:17:11] faith that can pull the churches
[2:17:14] together and give it some Supernatural
[2:17:16] strength that can change these bodies
[2:17:19] that we live in
[2:17:20] we see a God that can raise the dead off
[2:17:23] the floor
[2:17:24] or out of in the yard and bring him back
[2:17:27] to life again and present him before us
[2:17:29] we see a God who can take a cancer
[2:17:31] that's eat a man to a shadow and raise
[2:17:34] him up to a strong healthy man that
[2:17:37] ought to give rapturing Faith to the
[2:17:39] people
[2:17:40] and he said that when that light flashes
[2:17:42] from the sky and the trumpet sounds the
[2:17:46] body of Christ will be quickly gathered
[2:17:48] together and changed in a moment and
[2:17:50] taken into the heavens
[2:17:53] yes there's got to be something like
[2:17:55] that happen and our schools of theology
[2:17:57] can never produce it
[2:17:59] yet the intellectually are all right but
[2:18:03] you've got to meet that light and you've
[2:18:05] got to find that something amen
[2:18:09] and he said here Moses he said based in
[2:18:12] his great call upon the word
[2:18:14] and he said until one day he met this
[2:18:16] light and these are the very word itself
[2:18:18] spoke back to him and then he got his
[2:18:21] anointing that anointed and he said what
[2:18:24] he had in him and he said that on the
[2:18:28] inside
[2:18:29] amen it anointed that that he believed
[2:18:34] amen and brother is he not hearing what
[2:18:36] we believe is going to bring it to pass
[2:18:38] in our lives
[2:18:40] do you know any of what we believe is
[2:18:41] going to bring it
[2:18:43] to fulfillment
[2:18:44] concerning the resurrection and the
[2:18:47] rapture
[2:18:48] brother we need to delay in the presence
[2:18:51] of God till that till that Revelation is
[2:18:53] Anointed and we're going to see it as
[2:18:56] God ordained for us to see it
[2:19:00] yes there's got to be something like
[2:19:02] that happen and our schools of theology
[2:19:05] can never produce it yet the
[2:19:07] intellectually are all right but you
[2:19:09] have got to meet that light and you have
[2:19:12] got to find that something amen
[2:19:16] let me read again he said in here Moses
[2:19:18] basing his great call upon the word
[2:19:21] amen unto one day he met the light
[2:19:24] and the Very word itself spoke back to
[2:19:27] him and then he got his anointing
[2:19:30] that anointed what he had in him and he
[2:19:33] said that on the inside and brother the
[2:19:36] anointing is coming on the bride to
[2:19:37] anoint what we got in our hearts
[2:19:40] concerning the resurrection and the
[2:19:42] Rapture by the grace of God
[2:19:44] look up
[2:19:46] the hour of our Redemption is at hand
[2:19:48] amen
[2:19:50] amen because God is bringing out these
[2:19:52] Revelations now
[2:19:53] others are bringing out Revelation and
[2:19:55] causing people to disbelieve amen for
[2:19:58] yet God is bringing up the Revelation
[2:20:00] that's causing us to believe
[2:20:02] more and more and more
[2:20:04] have faith in God Amen
[2:20:11] amen he said what an anointing that
[2:20:13] anointed he said that what he believed
[2:20:14] he said what anointing he was he was
[2:20:17] commissioned and he said we know
[2:20:19] intellectually he aired his mother he
[2:20:21] knew what was going to take place and he
[2:20:23] knew he was living in that day but he
[2:20:25] found out he was a failure himself
[2:20:29] so he his faith might have dropped back
[2:20:33] a little bit but then when he comes to
[2:20:36] the bush God said I have heard the cries
[2:20:39] of my people and he said I remember my
[2:20:42] promise to their fathers Abraham Isaac
[2:20:45] Jacob and I have come down
[2:20:49] amen
[2:20:50] he said see I the personal pronoun I
[2:20:53] have come down to deliver them
[2:20:56] and brother what God has promised
[2:20:58] concerning for this hour and this age in
[2:21:00] which we're living now he has come down
[2:21:02] to deliver his elect
[2:21:04] into the resurrection and into the
[2:21:06] Rapture by the grace of God
[2:21:09] amen
[2:21:12] he said don't go away
[2:21:14] and say brother Brandon said it's 10
[2:21:16] years to the rapture
[2:21:18] I do not know nobody knows not even the
[2:21:21] angels of heaven but he said I know it's
[2:21:24] getting awful near
[2:21:25] for the signs that he said would be
[2:21:27] taking place and he said it'd be even at
[2:21:30] the door and we're getting them right
[2:21:32] now amen
[2:21:34] so he said are you young people are you
[2:21:37] old people
[2:21:38] he said who are out of Christ
[2:21:41] God help you and he said Now's the Time
[2:21:43] this is the hour if you haven't got the
[2:21:46] Holy Ghost receive it
[2:21:47] and he said for those that are in Christ
[2:21:49] will God bring with him the rest of them
[2:21:52] will go under the judgment and if you're
[2:21:54] not in Christ tonight hear my word for
[2:21:57] only those that are in Christ will go in
[2:22:00] the rapture
[2:22:01] God help us to be in Christ the word
[2:22:04] Amen to go in the Rapture by the grace
[2:22:07] of God let us believe what God has said
[2:22:11] and let us believe what God has done yes
[2:22:14] but let's believe what God's doing
[2:22:16] amen amen
[2:22:18] and what's he doing he's changing us
[2:22:20] from time to Eternity
[2:22:22] he's changing us into resurrection and
[2:22:25] rapturing glory amen
[2:22:27] oh it's tremendous what God has done
[2:22:30] but I'll tell you it's even more
[2:22:31] tremendous what God's doing
[2:22:33] it God did this God did that God did
[2:22:36] this through William Branham and it's
[2:22:37] true through this evangelist through
[2:22:39] that evangelist but brother what's he
[2:22:41] doing to the bride he's taking us from
[2:22:42] time to Eternity oh yeah they tapped
[2:22:45] into eternity and did this did this but
