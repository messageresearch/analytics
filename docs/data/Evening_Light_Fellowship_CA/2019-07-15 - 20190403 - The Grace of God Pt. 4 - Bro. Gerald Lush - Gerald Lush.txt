[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah turn with me to Romans chapter 5 no doubt we were already read this recently but we read it again I try to bring the thoughts on grace to a conclusion tonight it'll never end amen we'll always be under the revelation of grace a man we live by grace we walk by grace we talk by grace a man we believe by grace a man it's all grace a man praise the name of the Lord in Romans chapter 5 and verse 1 then pray the grace of God to sister Amber tonight I was sort of shocked when I heard the prayer request so we pray grace to her a man that the Jesus that's here is there a man so we pray the grace of God for the promise that we these stripes she was healed a man and for our brother Jeremiah and sisterly and the family a man going out of course and thank God that are going to a Christian doctor a man because God the Father God said one time he said God heals through medicine he said God heals you know through uses doctors and he said God heals through love and God heals through his word a man and that's the truth that's the absolute truth so we thank God for our brother Columbo we pray the grace of God in our brothers heart as he does surgery for our brother Jeremiah and any others that are sick we pray the grace of God Elvis Lord Elvis to believe with a complete belief and you know what that is as a statement of the faith of the Jews and it says they believe with a complete belief and they there's no room for any question or doubt a man no questions no doubt why they believe thus saith the Lord they believe the Word of God sir brother sister is serious it's getting more serious because the prophet of God did tell us and it's a challenge I pray that we face it as a challenge don't let the devil take it away from us or undermined its its significance that it's your talents and not just a thought that winner Branham experienced when he said if he's if you don't don't believe for divine healing he said are you gonna believe for the rapture a man you can't hear you believe for the heat of the body how you gonna believe for the change of the body a man because it's all by faith brother through our Lord Jesus Christ so uh it's a challenge no wonder the price he's dead the prophecy he said he says you're gonna be surprised who made it and who didn't make it cuz we think this one's gonna make it we think Don was gonna make it brother and they come to find out it than ever that's right and brother it's only by the grace of God we'll make it but again you got to have that attitude you got to have that right attitude you got to be conscious of that humbling yourself in the presence of God constantly amen and believe in God just believe God believe the word believe Jesus but listen stop the nonsense of the devil of reasoning saying you the devil is here to get you to reason but gods to come let us reason together though your sins be as scarlet they should be as white as snow and so on so grace by grace through faith he was giving us a faith amen to take away reasoning natural reasoning amen brother we need to get get rid of the natural reasoning and the natural thinking and all these things and become more spiritual by the grace of God it is serious a man so brothers sister please God help us but seem like the people are not not rising to the challenge to believe for healing they want to heal themselves they want to do this do you want to do that I can do this I can do that that's the devil oh do this do that you don't have to do this no God wants you to do it because like I said there's only one way of healing and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost probably God said as did that germ warfare is going to come up on all without the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen grace of God to his brother I pray make sure you got the baptism and make sure you got it in your soul not in your head make sure you got it in your soul not in your flesh amen because if it's in your soul it's gonna it got to manifest it in your flesh by the grace of God you'll bring it out amen so god help us is my prayer Romans 5 and verse 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ thank God by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in out of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also Oh tribulation I mean our glory and tribulation and it says knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience the Bible says through much tribulation we enter the kingdom much and patience experience and experience hope with expectation of fulfillment and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is she'd abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost Alleluia the love of God bear this in mind the Lord willing we'll get to a quote the Prophet emphasizes the love of God and what the love of God is amen and it says an old Megan not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us a man they shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Ghost there's no way of hiding it there's no way of holding it back it's a it'll automatically manifest itself and as for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly a man thank you Jesus for scarcely for a righteous man will one died yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us thank God amen this is our Redemption this is our salvation this is the grace of God that Christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him god bless his word you may be seated just a reminder that the items that we plan to get into regarding the messages that brother Matthew had sent us the link to on YouTube that her brother preached 40 years ago we'll get into that and also into the one that brother Alec reference to us hopefully after this Sunday by the grace of God because Sunday the Lord willing we I would like to have the communion service and because for that again to remind you that we should have communion service as the prophet of God said to our brother in Africa there he said maybe the post materials are more better than or better than we are because they have communion each and every Sunday and he's the wheel or every week we only have it once a week once a month rather he said and so on so and again I know that there are those around the message there some they don't believe in taking communion they feel that we don't we have a spiritual communion but we don't have to do the natural one but I like it you all know what I've said that as long as we're in this flesh we need to take the communion amen and brother when we get out of this flash into a glorified body we won't need it a man by the grace of God that we're going to take the communion as representing the shed blood and the broken body that by grace was laid down for us that we would be able to share we will be able to partake of the life of his blood eternal life by the grace of God amen so being prayer that the Lord will be with us on Sunday for the communion service and also to as we go through the other items that sometime in the near future we were going to have our brother Matthew give his testimony and also offer the time to our brother Craig to give a personal testimony and well some feel that we don't need that but again the problem of God did do away in in his Tabernacle in his church he did away with the testimony meetings because for many years ago that they had testimony meetings in most denominational churches I know that they used to have testimony meetings in even in the United Church their testimony meetings and they still do I wouldn't doubt but they still do maybe in the Salvation Army and the Pentecostal church and then and then after the testimony meeting they they they call on the preacher to preach and I know that even in the Salvation Army I remember the testimony said they had there it was tremendous the power of God the anointing was there and in the Pentecostal church the power of God the anointing was there as a brother or sister got up to testify a man they knee in between they would just sing sing courses but it was getting in the in Brenham chair and I who was getting out of order because they were a brethren that would get up to testifying but really they were preaching and I've experienced that as well in when in the early days of the message in the church in central Newfoundland and we eventually had to stop testimony meetings there because brethren would get up and go on and on and on and on and as I've said I have seen the pastor sit on the platform with his Bible in his notes for maybe three wait for maybe almost three hours a man that's the truth three hours before he could get up and preach a man so and brother Bannon was having a problem with that in Brenham tabernacle and no doubt brother Neville and and not only that it was also the gifts that they were manifesting in speaking in tongues and interpreting and the prophet of God preached church order because he said that the he did to bring our brother did bring it out to our pastor my former pastor and he brought it out and said that that many of the gifts that were being being used was not genuine a man it was a false anointing the gifts of the speaking in tongues and interpretation he said it wasn't God a man and again also is because of the testimonies that the people were giving and they were they were preaching not testifying so that's why he said you're going to have the meat he said when it comes to the gifts meet in the room before the service and let somebody judge the messages they came forth in tongues interpretation and when it comes to testimonies he said we're not going to add the testimony meetings he said if you've got a testimony just go and speak he said to to the pastor or let this one or that one know that you want to testify that God did something for you and you want to share it with the people and again they were limited to just a few minutes not for a 20 minutes for a half hour or 45 minutes so that again that we believe in testimonies and I'm willing to offer the brothers or even a sister if they had a testimony if they wanted to come out and testify for you know a half hour or 45 minutes or an hour we will it will allow that so as the Lord leads we will get our a couple of our brothers to give their testimonies and if Latin and if there's a sister they got a testimony or our brother got a testimony they'd like to share with the church you all feel free just let us know a man by the grace of God so grace to us a man let's do it let's do it God's Way let's get God the preeminence we're not going to try to give ourselves preeminence but give God two preeminence amen and let's do it for the glory of God and let's have the wisdom of God amen and the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen god bless you so again in Romans chapter 5 we read in verse 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ and by whom also we have access by faith into this grace we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in oak of the glory of God we have access by grace or by faith rather into grace because it is my it is my it is of great by grace through faith that we are saved a man so faith is going to is a reminder of grace if God reveals anything as a testimony of the grace of God to you as the testimony of the grace of God to me if God showed me this God showed me that Amen by faith a revelation that is a testimony of grace and grace and the prophet of God will will mention this and grace is a testimony of the love of God a man so let's not just say we say bye I'm saved by grace no you got to say by grace through faith but then you got to go back to the love of God that projected that grace a man because there are so few today that are thinking of or emphasizing the love of God amen or appreciating the love of God and they're not even appreciating really the grace of God they think is really what God did this and God did that and and so now I'm saved and so on but where's our appreciation a man where is our where is our love for him for doing what he has done for us and are we gonna are we gonna do for him what he has done for us are we gonna do for him what he is doing for us a man by the grace of God in that he lay down his life for us are we gonna lay down our lives for him a man and I turn to this brother this is the only way that we enter in to God's true Sabbath by the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the only way that we enter into the - to the God's God's rest saying again and we know that there are those are there they feel that they they've got to keep they got to keep a Saturday or they got to keep a Sunday know you got to keep every day a man is not one day it is seven days you see from your did works of sin seven days a week and you enter into God's eternal rest a man this is this is God's Sabbath it is our Lord Jesus Christ a man and the and the other which was but a tight and as I have I know it struck them I knew that by the way that there the look on their face those that believe in a Saturday Sabbath and I and I and I've challenged him I said well I said wasn't Jesus crucified I said for breaking the Sabbath day as I said according to the law and it shook them because they knew they were holding that against Jesus because he would bring he would do this on the Sabbath he would do that on the Sabbath and and throughout in Jesus challenged them Jesus because why because Jesus was God's Sabbath and Jesus was point what was moving them away from the natural Sabbath to God's spiritual salmon amen not focusing on a day but focusing on Christ amen not focusing on a day but focusing on the revelation of God by the grace of Almighty God Amen praise the name of the Lord and then again as I said before we got that online in our own page and I have received a number of emails from around the world a man from brothers and sisters that said thank you thank you thank you brother old brother I thank you for that revelation for that understanding of God's Sabbath because I was under the influence of this individual or that individual and they were trying to get me to keep Saturday Sabbath but when I when I read what you had written in your home page I entered into God's Sabbath amen and I want to thank you for that a van before we thank the Lord for the revelation that God has given a million in this day and in this hour Amen for brother I tell you this all due respect and God will honored God respects it there there was a time when when twist ins they they believe that that Sabbath was Sunday amen and they believed that we had to keep sunday in the Christianity as the Jews kept Saturday that's the truth and that's why they kept Sunday for for almost 2,000 years and of course they're still keeping a Sunday for almost 2,000 years but God in this hour in this age is revealed the truth and he has given us the light of God's true Sabbath a man that it is not a day it is an experience in our Lord Jesus Christ we go from natural rasa lujah we're going to lay down this old body nem and ever and we're gonna pick up a glorified body but the grace of God in our rest in our true Sabbath in Christ a man I had brother type of Wrath we don't we don't get rest the rest we want the rest we are honoring for the rest were thirsting for we don't get that by keeping a Saturday or a Sunday brother we're going to get that when we are entering to an experience with Jesus we repent we're baptized into in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and God gives us the Sabbath God gives us the Holy Ghost amen and again as I said I'll reference it to you and you want to read it in Hebrews chapter 4 read Hebrews 4 and you'll get the true revelation of God's true Sabbath by the group and it's by the grace of God amen so it's been the grace of God all the way down through the grace of God on the day or well right right right from the beginning as I have already ministered I believe in in the last sermon it was the grace of God in Genesis the grace of God in the in the in the in the Old Covenant it is the grace of God in the New Covenant and it was the grace of God as I said in the book of Revelation that the last line was the great I pray the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all Amen that's that's that's amazing thank God a man that he's serving John prayed that prayer at the end of the Book of Revelations amen that John prayed that prayer at the end of time amen hallelujah so it is grace that has brought us it is Grace that keeps us it is grace that's taking us on in His graciousness moving us from time to eternity by the grace of God amen hallelujah so I pray the grace of God to help us in order to recognize the the revelation that that pleases God the faith that pleases God and the grace of God is going to help us what is going to give us a greater and a greater revelation of the love of God amen because we're gonna trace work we're going to trace the faith points us back to Grace because they had brother the gray outside of grades there there's not going to be any faith that pleases God there is no way but it is by grace through faith so faith I go back and say thank you Lord for the grace that you have given me so that I have this faith a man and brother and again it is the love of God that is testified of the grace of God amen so brother love and faith is going to meet under grace by the group amen where new creatures in Christ by the grace of God anyway it is the love of God and it is the faith of God amen and it and it is it is revealed to us may the grace of God amen amen thank God for grace so brother by whom also we have access by faith into this grace we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God amen and in verse 15 it says but now not as the new offense so also is the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead after the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift of grace by grace which is by one man Jesus Christ as abounded unto many a man it is the grace of God brother from Genesis to Revelation that's why I bound it unto many is not just grace in the New Testament it was grace all the way down through a man it was grace in the Garden of Eden it was greater the days of Abel it was grace in the days of Enoch it was grace in the days of Noah amen it was grace of God to Israel through the through Abraham it was the grace of God to Israel Alleluia through the prophets amen and through the law answer the sacrifice that God had given them to do sacrifice these lambs sacrificed this sacrifice that and it became what he may in praise the name of the Lord what was that for it was a covering for their sin amen by the grace of God by God by goodbye baby by his love with strand projecting Grace and grace was going to project a man not just the covering for sin but he was going to project a man a sacrifice that would take away sin a man they would wash it away that had been lost a man lost lost in the sea of God's forgetfulness a man by the grace of Almighty God this is tremendous mother's sister a man named when we ate any any reason brother that we're loving God is because of grace Amen praise the name of the Lord and again the public God said this is why God has permitted all that he is permitted this is why God has allowed all that he is loud in the negative he says so he was going to manifest the positive by grace through faith and he's what for he says so that we would look back and love him amen no no yeah because God wanted wants us again he wants us to love him for himself amen not because of this because of that oh no he is his character Amen we would love God because of his character a man oh gods oh you're wonderful Lord loving for himself oh yeah there's just there there are those that oh we love this one because they did this because they did that no but what about their nature any man do you love them because of their nature your loving because because it's their their their character you know it's just a way that they live and so on and it seems so natural for them but it's an anointing on the inside of the inside of the grace of God amen and they're just automatically living it out and they're giving the glory to God by the grace of God but again for a humanly speaking they they that we like this one we like that one we love that when we love that one but all they're there they're nice and so on but wait God knows what's in the heart aim and see and God knows what's in your heart and and understand that tonight if there's anything that God is looking at he's not looking at your head he's not looking at your flesh he's looking at your heart and what's on the inside of the inside by the grace of Almighty God and remember because where he wants us he wants to see if really if God is in your heart if the Holy Ghost is in your heart amen if Jesus is there sitting on the throne amen if the word of God is there in control of you he may not in your head but in your heart so if nobody goes working out of the inside of the inside hey man they're all mine listen the devil has been put out of the heart we were born in sin saved in iniquity come to the world speaking lies we ate we a that evil nature and that sinful nature but a but again hallelujah God had got it at a promise God had a plan than to bring us to turn us around and bring us back hallelujah to turn us around and point us back to him and through him through faith our faith in Him and what he was doing and what he would do for us that he would take us back to eternity he made by the grace of Almighty God regarding mother sister God Elvis and all and to have the experience in our hearts and in our souls I that I have been born again a man that old bird not that I I felt I felt God in my flesh or I felt God in my head or I felt God in my senses no I I bet I was I was this kinetic creature and I used to do this and I used to do that you know it was just your nature and there was no conviction but now hallelujah I am a new creature in Christ I've been born again hallelujah and now and now there's an anointing there in my heart there's anointing in my soul now that's there to keep me in line with the word and it's there to keep me in contact with God and is there to convict me and trouble me if I fail God if I ever bright step out of line with the word and so on oh yeah their cargo the evidence I'll be born again amen by the grace of God because again we got to understand that if we're born again and the Holy Ghost is on the inside of the inside a

souls Amen not in your head but in our heart and in our soul and what what is it what is the end result it is a new creature in Christ because a man by the grace of Almighty God and he says for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God amen it is by grace you're saved through faith not of yourself it is the gift of God and he made many to want to take

of the word and tell us and I don't do this now but do this you don't have to do this but you're gonna do this ain't no oh if we're born again God shaken makes us new creatures and God gives us a new nature on the inside a man a hunger and a thirst sir for more of his righteousness ain't man and there's there's that power there's the Holy Ghost and it convicts us of what is right and what is wrong amen amen and then the desire now that as our a in us now is to do what's right but the enemy is there to get us to do what's wrong a man so God Elvis and that's why he said it we sin we got an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous praise the Lord and Heilbrun ouya thank God for that grace that by grace through faith he'll bring us back to it he'll bring us to repentance everybody and we repent and we're and our fellowship with God is restored again amen they are as I said I believe the last service our relationship wasn't changed but our fellowship anybody sin

living like a useful in you don't have the desires that you used to have amen oh the enemy is that I'm talking about operate your nature everyday living a man brother sister I have made an odor so we need a greater hunger in our souls then in our flesh amen there are those that oh there went out there living according to or they're hungry for this they're hungry for that hungry for something else but if you're a Christian you're hungry for God in you're a Christian you're hungry for the word if you're a question you're hungry to please God to love God - praise God if you're a Christian a man your hunger you've got a hunger to worship God you got a hunger for eternity a man a man hallelujah you've got a hunger to be a witness for God and the show and and to reveal God to others through the life you're living amen and and to show the love of God to others amen through the love that you're having for one another Amen brother sister god help us it's my prayer so he said by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God amen not of works lest any man should boast not of works and I on top of good works you can be religious you go to church a man yeah you can even preach yeah you can do anything I still go to hell yeah still go to hell why because it's all outward it's all in the flesh and in the mind but not in the soul yeah God of grace help us brother amen nor we need your unmerited favor what about brother sister mother's way if you're if you're a predestinated seed of God from the foundation of the world it's like that Pentecostal pastors to ask said to me he said brother would you explain predestination and I say well what's your problem because I heard in a church up here I heard a Pentecostal preacher get up and he blasted the predestination he didn't believe it he said they get out there and say God has predestinated this predestiny of that and he made light of it and so on and I said oh god I said forgiven and then this this other brother that was a Pentecostal pastor and he just said well predestination what I want to know is said God he said predestinate this one to go to hell and that one to that one that one to go to heaven and so on I said yes he should you mean God decided to send that one to hell I said no I said predestination I said is based on foreknowledge I say why and then they said foreknowledge I said yeah I said God foreknew all things before the foundation of the world I said he knew he knew he knew the end from the beginning and I said he knew what this one was going to do and what that one was gonna do and I said this one was free destinated Amen unto eternal life and that was for destinated to hell and again I said they that is their choice a man because God does Charlie Ximena and God wants them to make the choice and he knows what it's bringing out his seed and who's not who is the seed of God and who's the Serpent's eat anybody the seed of God I can respond to God and they're gonna stay with the word regardless of what a what the price they gonna pay amen regardless of the separation that is gonna cost him a man no matter what they got to do or or they feel that God wants them to do they're gonna do it for the glory of God if they are the seed of God amen and I tell you this God's God's for new when the word went for hallelujah praise the name of the Lord when the word went forth brother God saw this one was just took while some rejected it others took just parts of it and made religion out of it but the seed of God took it and went on down in the middle of the road amen they stayed in the middle of the road God did this and the seed of God's kept it oh that's gone that's my father hey man brother sister God is God God knows the end from the beginning God and listen true sister than a you know because why because Oh our guardian angels stand before the throne of God and your garden enjoys your theophany body now that's all those that are being saved brother God allowed us to come this way a man so he could show his love and grace to us and that we would turn around and go back boo back with him again but when we go back we're gonna go back in glorified bodies amen our Fiat our theophany bodies is going to take on glorified bodies hey man see we're going home we're going home we're going back where we come from anybody and the life you live and what you believe and how you believe it a man brother and how you live it a man approach whether or not you are going home that's the truth and now we know that some are going to seems like oh I'm a seed of God around this time that and all because they're lonely they want to go all the way somewhere somewhere they'll step out of line somewhere they're gonna compromise that's right brother just make our calling election shore that you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that makes that makes us new creatures in Christ don't think you're a new creature Christ because you left that church and went to that one left out and went to that one D left the others income and even come here oh I'm in the message so I meant who I'm a new creature in Christ no no no as I've said no I'll say it again and again and again the Devils in the message oh yeah and and and the devil he knows the message and that's why he's adding to it taking from it that's the truth but he knows he knows who it was the seed of God who's not the seed of God hey man but he's after the seed of God he's trying to get them but no all the father's give me will come to me and I will lose none of them that's what Jesus said amen praise the name of the Lord so brother again bear with me by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast it's not works whether it's grace and the faith that grace has given you and the life of that grace that faith is producing amen the life that that faith is producing amen what's that faith doing in you amen not just here what's that faith doing in you when you when you go to school what's that face doing in you when you go to work what's that thing doing in you a man when you're when you're ho dere associated with family friends and neighbors amen yes grease somebody one time was trying to sell my house and the somebody that was wondering about it they said who owns it or sister or it's it's a good house he said bend and the the one that lives in that he said he's a pastor they said why yeah he's a pastor oh no I'm not buying that and that's why they wouldn't buy it why cousins a pastor's house brother is amazing absolutely amazing yeah because the and the neighbor that knew me oh yeah Union one time there something came up and Nick sings I'm gonna knock down the door so oh this lady over here wants us to see the minister wants to see the me yes he said well see you there's an issue they want you to pray for so brother sister do they recognize that anointing in your life do they recognize that you're you're not just a normal person would they recognize you as a Christian because of the way you talk because of how you walk yeah come on if you if you're if you're born again you you walk like Christ you're a talk like Christ a man tremendous absolutely amazing yeah cuz this crutch is not me it lives it's Christ that liveth in me so now you're gonna walk like I'm talk like and think like him and you dare be that then you don't have to say what Jesus or Christ no no it's just just what the way you're gonna speak and explain yourself and so on you're not ashamed brother we are his workmanship created we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen brother so remember you're not just created just to go to church you're not just created just to go through the formal godliness you've been created on to good works they meant it so it's not you doing it it's Christ in you doing it by the grace of God a man through the faith of God and by the love of God a man and again in Romans he said not as the offence also is the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead and much more the grace of God and the gift by grace which is by one man Jesus Christ has abounded unto many and in verse 17 he said for him by one man's offence he said death reigned by one much more he said they which received abundance of grace and I pray for abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ it's all Jesus well it's amazing no matter what you're doing you're thank you Jesus is doing it that's right if you're in an office city and it is it's Jesus praise the Lord and or you're driving a propane truck it's not brother Chad it's Jesus hey man if you're doing this work and that work you're going to school as our staff are doing their schoolwork as our younger brothers and sisters it's not that much Jesus in them yeah and if they got problems I'm wanted by this store depending on Jesus to reveal this or do this to do this a man praise the Lord if you're going to a university yes Jesus and they'll recognize you oh yeah no no no that you're different most definitely yeah have you had have you had that response to the life you're living - what you do and how do you do it that individuals have said oh you must be a Christian amen they knew Jesus was different and listen if his Jesus in you as different as he was to the Jews 2,000 years ago so are you going to be as different to others around you a man he's gonna live his life he's going to express things the way he that that did he expressed it back there a man it's gonna be the word the word the word a man you never say no it's really it's written or thus saith the Lord you just expressed it this way no no I feel that this is this is what we should do and how we should do it oh you feel like that you believe that yes I believe it or you must be a Christian brother says if by one man's offense death reigned unto one much more they which receive the abundance of grace abundance of grace thank God oh my it's our only hope brother is Grace oh but it's the message but where is it grace amen is it is it the dynamics of the love of God the grace of God or is it just the mechanics of the letter of the word is Amen if it's Christ in you then it's a you're living a different life amen your spirit is different your attitude is different oh yeah Oh most definitely your characters different its Christ living out through you they oh yeah well Pete it was whoa that was Peter it was Jesus and Peter it was Jesus in the Apostles it was Jesus in in the believers down through the ages hey man it's Christ in me the hope of glory and so on I tell you there's a lot of believers they they can they can know the message inside upside down but they don't know they don't know Jesus that's the truth they don't know Jesus amen brother you can have it you can have the word but it what about the mechanics of the word oh yeah but do you have the dynamics that's the life of Christ in you the dynamics is the life of pricing ami and your are you a new creature I mean it now are you a new creature of Christ do you do it when you when you or when you repented and got baptized and so on did and you an experience with God did you feel like a new creature in Christ going different now oh yeah I all praise the Lord God's got preeminence now Jesus got preeminence now hallelujah oh I'm in it to me to the word and the love of God and all praise the Lord man do you have that experience yeah as I said before I've preached the congregation's and like I told you about the but the man that was a bit noisy but and I said Lord I said tell them to quiet the others now others were praising the Lord worshiping but he was right there he stood out and I said Lord there's something wrong with him I said the what's lacking in his praise I said is the anointing I said praise the Lord because like I said they that was the same service I started my silenced them but then when I got into the word they all started to praise the Lord but they for them it was the anointing of the Holy Ghost but for that brother I looked at him I saw this like a spirit around him I said or something wrong with him I said the others I said I don't notice on the others but him and I like I said it was just two or three nights later when we had fellowship and when he left he said pray for me I said why he said because sometimes he said I think I got a religious spirit I said yes brother I'll pray for you it was a confirmation of what the Lord was revealing amen so brother sister let's be in the spirit when you come come in the spirit everybody when you come make sure Jesus are with you not that not just with you but he's in you amen by the grace of God Alleluia old brother he gives he gives her he makes us new creatures new attitudes they man Alleluia praise the name of the Lord you got a different character a man you got a different nature actions reactions I will Lou you you see things differently you express yourself differently a man praise the Lord sure brothers sister we have received the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ isn't he is is the Holy Ghost in control of you that if he is Denys Christ living in you if he's not then all you got is two mechanics not the dynamics god help us if that's serious and again in verse 20 he said moreover the law entered that the offence might abound but where sin abounded grace did much more about hallelujah brother and in this world that we're living in now sin is abounding and grace is abounding much more for the few elected predestinated seed of god but you gotta want it you've gotta want it that's why it's abounding because the seed wants it the sons and daughters of God wanted and God is going to have it there for them amen and it says that as sin had reigned unto death even so my grace reigned through the righteousness on to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord so brother grace as to reign in your life be in control of your life by the grace of God amen bear with me allow me to share with you some thoughts and again no doubt maybe you heard the message on of grace but please hear the word don't hear brother Jerome hear the word you got to look beyond me hear the word Amen by the grace of God look beyond the pre church to the to Christ amen and he's the Lord and bear this in mind the poverty God said this is God's judgment seat and he said it's going over the pulpit that's right and he said by the preacher of the word he said the minister is casting out spirits amazing but but again if the spirit goes out the person's got to recognize it and thank God for deliverance thank you Jesus that you're helping me thank you Jesus you're making me more in your likeness amen praise the name of the Lord her brother his serious faith comes by hearing hearing by the word and it's not just what's written in this book it's by the it's by the ministry that God has said in the church and God and and you go through it and again there are those that don't believe in the ministry no no but Bibles gotcha the Bible says that God has set them in the church for the perfecting of the saints god Elvis for the work of the ministry and to build us up in the most holy faith and so on by the ministry is there to take us on to perfection and on to eternity well through the preaching of the word but there are those that feel that they can do it just by reading the Bible they can do it just by reading the message book no no no probably God did say you won't go no further than the pastor and he said he's ordained to lead you through and he said you won't live any higher than the pastor amen grace of God and but again don't you got to be careful you know when it comes to going to snifter this church that church that's a prophet of God said you got to go to a church where the pastor's anointed by the Holy Ghost cuz he said sometimes he said people go to a church he said and they just get the spirit of the pastor and not the Holy Spirit amen grace and in this message on the message of grace he did read the scripture that we have already read in Zachariah when we started this where he said we're at that old great mountain before zerubabbel and thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone there I was shouting crying grace grace unto it grace grace unto it amen he said but now according to the prophecy there will come the headstone and I want you to notice that when the headstone comes the prints that's going to cry out the message will cry grace grace he suffered by four hits my grace are we saved and not of works lest any man should boast and the message of grace has been tramped under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace and even around the message Grace has become a disgrace because many a church has become a yeah god help us and he said some of them runs out into eternity eternal security some runs out into everything but the true message of grace remains the same and he said and there's there's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the grace of God that we're all saved by so in the deity of Jesus Christ the Lord God he said could come there and confirm that that if that is the truth not only that but by his word he confirms it's the truth by signs and wonders he confirms it's the truth there then also grace is the truth then he said they could anyone anyone criticize say that grace is wrong and he said we're saved by works we are saved by grace and that's the truth but where the grace come from or a dog no come from God's love divine love projected grace grace thing and brother if we got the faith we got the grace of God in our hearts our souls we got the love of God in our hearts they met we are saved by grace and that through faith not by works work show that you have been saved but what saves you is the grace of God grace saves you grace is what God does for you works is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you but by grace are you saved amen praise the name of the Lord he said listen he said Jesus he took a fisherman who were poor and walked the common life and that he revealed himself and said follow me and I will make you fishers of men and he should show that His grace still reached down even from the Jews to the Gentiles to call the people for his name in this last days a man and has not fishers of men it's the resurrection of the rapture amen brother it's a revelation that that the folks who started the message a new flame didn't have you know what their their ministry was you know what the revelation was that they had and that they preached for years under God took him home they preached that God had sent a prophet and that God's through the Prophet had opened the seven seals the mystery of God and that was the that was the extent of the revelation that they had but they didn't go beyond that to realize that in those seven seals the third pole was rapturing faith a man and that God did what he did to give us rapturing faith to raise a generation that would get that revelation that the hour come for the resurrection and the rapture amen so we've gone beyond God has sent a prophet into the third pole of the Resurrection and the rapture amen and the prophet of God did I like the fact that there were five times that God manifested resurrection in his ministry amen five times that the dead was raised amen and it was it was a vindication Amen that the ministry was pointing to the resurrection and the rapture that the ministry would listen saints please in the name of Jesus Lutheran and went on to justification and made a denomination and like I said the others went on to sanctification made a denomination and the Pentecost was the gifts and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so on and they made the nomination out of that but the spirit moved on into the prophetic ministry of William Branham and the only of the word now where do we go from here our faith is being challenged where do we go from here they went on in the faith that God gave them in previous ages and they went on and on and on and usually the prophet of God said after the third or fourth generation he said they denominated and now more and more people are becoming denominated around the message they're making denominations in over this doctrine over this theology over that theology but the bride is going to stay separated unto the Lord for the resurrection and the rapture we're not gonna make a denomination out of it not by any means no we're gonna keep calling for the resurrection we're gonna keep calling for the rapture yes is there anything that the bride wants brother is the resurrection rapture as I said we need a greater hunger in our souls than the hunger in our flesh there there are believers today who hunger in their flesh is greater than the hunger in their souls why are they hungry for the army for the natural things of life they're longing for the natural things of life where those that are hungry and their souls are hungry for eternity they want to get out of here see just like the Troma of Israel that came out of Egypt Joshua Kayla wanted to go in they wanted to go and they were listen they took such a stand now listen they took such a stand to go in they were they wanted to force him to go in then they go in go in come on we gotta go in we got to get in they stood there and they end and no doubt they preached and preached and preached it under finally brother that the Jews took up stones to stone them what Moses brought them out to go in the prophet of God and God in the Providence brought us out to go in but how many wants to go Eve they're gonna fight and stone those that are trying to get the people to just just believe for the rapture believe for the resurrection come on we got to get in and we got to get in no dirt why because they have a greater hunger for the natural things of life than they do the spiritual whether this is real do we believe it or don't believe it do we believe what God has done and what God is doing or don't we believe what God was about God is doing is this the hour for the resurrection in the rapture or what is it we can we consider what's going on in the world and around the world brother the world is insane the world gone crazy this is this is not the world we lived in a year ago everything is changing so quickly no matter where you go ever there's nothing nothing normal no more that's right brother sister Utah why they're eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil it's controlling the world the Internet what yes it's controlling the world in fact as I was telling some brother there last few days said that there's certain governments in countries over there in the in Asia somewhere or Europe and and they're trying to stop the young people from getting involved with cell phones and the Internet why because there's changing the way they think it's changing the way they act because now is part because that cell phone and their contact with the internet now is putting them in contact with with the Western world with America and with Canada and with other than their other other Western nations and so on and so they don't think like like like they were thought might be used on like blood like they were trained and raised up as Arabs and so on no no everything's changing and that's why certain government severus are trying to get them away from from that internet yeah it's accomplishing one thing there is a company's in another in the Western world people are becoming less and less spiritual and it might be religious but they're not spiritual god help us you should remember the first judgement seat was upon the earth and it was in the Garden of Eden and the last judgement seat will be upon the earth at the end time the white throne brother ray in that hour now he said the grace of God reached over there to him through them in Noah's time he said grace saved Noah not his works but grace and it also saved his family he said God spoke to him by grace not her Abraham he said God spoke to Abraham by grace not because he was different not because he was a better man but by grace God called him and he said the Bible clearly makes that known o Abraham now Abraham tested God's patience and told him and said Abraham stay in the land don't you go out of it but as soon as famine come in Adam or Abraham run yeah god help us they were not going to get out of the land of the revealed word Abram spoke of us God took Abraham by grace and saved him and that's how he takes you by grace and how we do test his patience that's the truth today we're up tomorrow we're down one day we believe the next day we're wondering today we believe in divine healing and tomorrow the tummyache comes and we don't know whether we believe it or not that's true but yet in the midst of all of that God wants us to stay put but he saves us anyhow if it wasn't the grace of God we'd all be gone he said God saves us by His grace a man brother sister and he's true and he's right oh when we're well we got faith we can see what happened to faith oh I believe God I believe God I believe God then all of a sudden sickness strikes oh you believe God with His stripes you're healed Oh yeah I believe it but you gotta claim it you gotta claim it and read it the devil Jesus had to rebuke the devil so we got to rebuke the devil it's written Satan get thee behind me they man grace of God oh there's so much here but I won't read it we just he said my humble prayer is before the grace of God that's here this morning I hope mines wrote like this that he won't see my mistakes that when my commentary is written my obituary that it won't be read out that I made mistakes and done wrong but he'll only see the things that I tried to do for him amen thank God a man he said he'll take the grace of God that I believe in and that's where I'm solely trusting for upon my own merits I could do no more than go in then none of the rest but he said upon the grace of God I'm depending yes it's grace that i'm depending on he said it was grace to David he was grace to Moses he goes on explains what happened in their lives and the grace of God that oh that took over for them he said I'm so glad to be a fugitive today because I see that Christ is coming to be king you can elect all the Kennedys and whatever more you want but Christ will be king the anointing is upon him upon his message of is coming and he'll be king amen well he has come praise the Lord it's the message of his coming the Lord says shall descend from heaven with a shout yes yes the voice of the Trump and so on and the dead in Christ rise first then we which are alive remaining gonna be caught up caught up with them brothers sister resurrection and Ralphie faith is not up there it's right here and it should be in air just as you know like I said Luther just all he just rejoiced and praise God hallelujah Alleluia justification justification I'm just a a man he went on for a year after year after year I'm justified praise the Lord and as the others you know when the Pentecostals went off for years years and years and years praising God and and and talking about the gifts of the Spirit of speaking in tongues and so on amen but then they cool down they made the spirit and left of a moved on so brother that's what was in them and they moved and it moved them that was her faith so what's in us what are we believing for that was that age that age that age that age and what about this age amen her brother it ought to be in us now praise the Lord we're we're about to go in the rapture oh praise the Lord we're about to be changed I'm when to my entire fide body a man well how do you know that well brother sister according to the according to the Bible we're at the end of all things according to the Bible he's finishing with the Gentiles he's going back to the Jews hey man hallelujah amen oh that's right but you got to believe it you got to believe it Luther had to believe what he read concerning justification Pennock all said to believe what they read about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gift a man hallelujah and as like I said that black man that God that God used that Pentecostal revival in in the United States there like I said he he stood the pulpit he put a box over his head and pray because he didn't want to be disturbed amen oh yeah they are they did that I I have the the history of the book of it and they said he would even grow their time after time service after service and they ended pray and he get up and he put the box over his head and pray and pray and pray over they call him for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Spirit and that's where God started that revival they a man he he knew this is what God was wanted to do and he was hungry and thirsty for and God did it praise the Lord my brother your hunger god I'm good Joshua Caleb longer the thirst to get him to the promised land God took him in and not only that Joshua had the faith to stop the SU in and we know that Lazarus there in the end or one of the not Lazarus but one of the believers in the New Testament he stopped he stopped the som with his faith yeah Jesus stops it who's that and it was the blind man they wanted lot of Jesus the healer he says your faith is your faith has saved you say Amen he said go your way it's wrong so II stopped the Esso him but Joshua Caleb or judgment stopped the issuing because he was having problems we went out there he said Lord he said to defeat the enemies and we need more time he said the day needs to be longer hey man and so even though he took heed spoke to the son to stay still the issue in and it stopped for almost a day but science knew that there was something going on even even in modern science and so on but they could go back and find the answer at the bottle what should be a day and it was Joshua was almost today but it was the Prophet that prophesied the did did the death of a king amen and and as a sign he also stopped it and it was G but it was only H for a short time so that time and Joshua's time made the 24 hours yeah that's for that's true oh yes that's true science indicates it Sciences yeah we agree they thought - it was off because of Joshua first but then when they when somebody brought in a boat that both the Prophet and the King in Israel oh yeah there was different he made God made the full day God is perfect brother and God knows what he's doing brother you don't you don't have to worry about God you don't have to think that God made a mistake here made a mistake there nothing tough God's made no mistakes we make mistakes God don't praise the Lord amen oh he should think of love and grace I'll had the bring it to a conclusion he should think of love and grace as sisters twin sisters he says you can't have grace without having love amen do you have love yeah divine law oh yeah I got I got love yeah lovest thou me more than these something you got love what do you love who do you love Amen God Elvis grace do you love the body of Christ and I'm not talking about this I'm talking with the many membered body hallelujah the sons and daughters of God a man the brothers and sisters of Jesus Christ and now the Bride of Christ you know just like the bread the man one time was interviewed when the prophet of God was God took him home and the interviewed a certain individual in a certain denominational Church Catholic Church I have the newspaper home and they said and he was explaining about William Brennan he said listen he said the one thing about William Branham he said I'll never forget he said I knew it was anything that he had and he felt toward Jesus it was love he said you only had to talk to him and you knew he loved you I said well I said he won't lose his reward not for that testimony they may just think he recognized that praise the Lord so he said think of love and grace as sisters twin sisters you can't have grace without having love and before you can have grace you have to have love and before you can actually show some somebody a favor you love them right or wrong you have to love them amen knowing that did you love them you'll show that love God brought grace into our lives by his love for us amen and that's the truth he said I am nothing until charity comes in which is love love listen love is grace the grace of God that does all God's grace cannot be bargained for he said it is Sovereign Grace nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling amen just as I am amen the grace of God while the diminish they're with me that's grace he said we speak when the Holy Ghost speaks and we only let that come three times and he said two can't be while I'm preaching or in order because the spirit of the prophets is subject to the Prophet a man he said there's five offices in the church apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors that's ordained offices of God men hold them and they are you can't wish for them you can't pray for them they are sovereignly given and you are born amen to the results of that ministry that God has put you under a minute sure God got a ministry to bring you to Christ God got a ministry amen to introduce you praise the Lord there's only

we confess then he's done it a man your faith because you believe you're a Christian now he said you'll live above that thing now and he said if you want to raise a little higher just to have more faith because it's unlimited Jesus Christ dwells in his people we'll finish that there it is the message of grace and all the way through it the prophet of God is highlighting the grace of God in the lives of those in the scriptures and in the lives of those down through the ages that it is Grace amen he said grace be with you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ a man who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our Father to whom be glory for ever and ever amen the grace of God be with us amen being
