[1:21:03] I've reached the point of no return
[1:21:12] a man you believe it that way this
[1:21:23] morning nothing to go back to Amen
[1:21:27] praise the Lord we just appreciate the
[1:21:30] wonderful presence of the Lord here this
[1:21:32] morning in the presence of the Lord last
[1:21:35] night just to be able to enjoy the good
[1:21:38] Word of God
[1:21:39] and these things don't come from us they
[1:21:41] come from the word and the opening of
[1:21:43] the word and the seven seals being open
[1:21:45] to us and to be able to enjoy that it's
[1:21:48] our inheritance it's our food it's what
[1:21:51] the Lord has given us and so that's why
[1:21:53] we enjoy it so much we were living in a
[1:21:56] special time and so we're thankful once
[1:21:59] again thank you for inviting us brother
[1:22:02] Gerald is our last service although I
[1:22:04] were in wrestling with the angel here
[1:22:06] last night quite a bit and this morning
[1:22:08] of what two preachers now that I'm into
[1:22:10] the flow of it there's so many more
[1:22:12] things that I wanted to preach amen so
[1:22:15] we should stay another week and have
[1:22:17] service every night it would be nice
[1:22:24] it's nice but we just been trying to get
[1:22:26] the focus of the Lord and mind of the
[1:22:28] Lord for this morning so many wonderful
[1:22:30] things that we want to be able to share
[1:22:32] with you but we just want to thank say
[1:22:35] thank you once again for the hospitality
[1:22:36] and we just thank you that we can come
[1:22:40] and have friends we have several young
[1:22:42] people here that have attended our
[1:22:44] retreat and it's good to see you and be
[1:22:46] a participator in those things we
[1:22:49] remember you remember your participation
[1:22:51] and young people they're serving God as
[1:22:53] an example to the younger ones and we
[1:22:56] appreciate you going on with the Lord
[1:22:57] trust that you've reached the point of
[1:22:59] no return
[1:23:01] and so we are glad to be able to share
[1:23:03] our lives with you in those ways and
[1:23:05] then sister Kim as well and to see her
[1:23:07] in a good Church here using her gifts
[1:23:10] it's a great honor for me as a pastor be
[1:23:13] able to send young people like this to
[1:23:15] other places to be able to serve the
[1:23:17] Lord in good churches like this it's a
[1:23:19] gives me great joy to see her here and
[1:23:21] in just serving the Lord this way so I
[1:23:25] know she's an asset to you here so we
[1:23:28] appreciate appreciate very much we have
[1:23:30] I just will mention to you for the glory
[1:23:32] of the Lord we last 5 years our main
[1:23:35] mission work every church that's a
[1:23:38] church should be involved in some type
[1:23:40] of mission work and I know that you are
[1:23:42] here because you're always in the will
[1:23:43] of God when you're given to missions and
[1:23:45] helping spread the message so about five
[1:23:48] years ago would put it on my heart and
[1:23:50] brother Doug Baker's heart from Tucson
[1:23:52] to finish the message to entirely in
[1:23:55] Spanish so we launched the project about
[1:23:58] five years ago we hired several
[1:24:00] translators around the world some of
[1:24:02] them full-time some of them part-time
[1:24:04] and we thought the project would take
[1:24:06] just two years well it's been five years
[1:24:07] but here in a couple months we are only
[1:24:11] about 25 messages short now we'll finish
[1:24:13] those in the next few months of
[1:24:15] finishing the entire message in Spanish
[1:24:17] a spanish-language second or third
[1:24:21] largest language in the world it's the
[1:24:23] most downloaded message such a demand
[1:24:26] for it and so I you can imagine how I'm
[1:24:28] going to feel in a couple months when
[1:24:30] that project is done and we'll be able
[1:24:33] to know that they can enjoy the message
[1:24:35] the spanish-speaking people just as much
[1:24:37] as us in English they can be able to do
[1:24:40] the search program and all these other
[1:24:42] things available to us in the entirety
[1:24:45] of the message in Spanish so we thank
[1:24:47] the Lord for that it was also a very
[1:24:49] expensive project but the Lord has
[1:24:51] provided all the funds as well and he
[1:24:54] took care of us that way as well so
[1:24:55] we're thankful we just want to give
[1:24:57] glory to the Lord I don't know what the
[1:24:59] Lord will have doing for us next there's
[1:25:01] many needs around the world many
[1:25:02] different languages and things but would
[1:25:04] just be praying for his leadership and
[1:25:07] and we trust that you're involved in
[1:25:09] something here to be able to help with
[1:25:11] that little as much when God is in it
[1:25:13] little as much when God is in it and a
[1:25:16] small portion that you do and even that
[1:25:18] you give can go to help someone to come
[1:25:22] closer to the Lord and the message of
[1:25:24] the hour I think we should have our part
[1:25:26] in that participation in that
[1:25:28] praise the Lord well we're going to
[1:25:29] stand and read a scripture this morning
[1:25:31] if you would don't mind standing again
[1:25:38] we're going to read from Joshua chapter
[1:25:41] 1 just a few verses of Scripture and to
[1:25:44] set a set us in the right channel this
[1:25:47] morning and certainly enjoy last night
[1:25:50] to be able to enjoy the that subject and
[1:25:53] be able to cover that with trusted
[1:25:54] administered each of you in a special
[1:25:57] way amen and so we're going to continue
[1:26:01] a little bit in the subject of maturity
[1:26:03] as we've been the entire weekend we're
[1:26:06] gonna stay in that vein but just a
[1:26:07] little different channel to it and we're
[1:26:10] gonna speak about the transition here
[1:26:12] from Moses to Joshua a very very
[1:26:16] important transition to go from Moses to
[1:26:18] Joshua to go from the Prophet to the
[1:26:21] prophecy and we're in those transitions
[1:26:26] and those so they're important to talk
[1:26:28] about Joshua chapter 1 and verse 1 says
[1:26:31] now after the death of Moses the servant
[1:26:33] of the Lord it came to pass that the
[1:26:36] Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun
[1:26:39] Moses minister saying Moses my servant
[1:26:42] is dead now therefore arise go over this
[1:26:47] Jordan thou and all this people unto the
[1:26:51] land which I do give to them even to the
[1:26:55] children of Israel so even in the first
[1:26:59] two verses here you can see the
[1:27:01] transition that God is moving the people
[1:27:04] to from Moses singular to them the
[1:27:08] people so it's moving from the prophet
[1:27:11] Moses and you remember the purpose and
[1:27:15] God sending the Prophet was to bring the
[1:27:18] people all of them into
[1:27:20] they're individual tribes and individual
[1:27:23] lands and their inheritance that God
[1:27:25] promised them that was the purpose in
[1:27:28] God's ending Moses we know that Moses
[1:27:31] brought them out of Egypt we know that
[1:27:32] Moses did mighty signs and wonders we
[1:27:35] know there was a whole focus there of
[1:27:38] God leading his children in a certain
[1:27:40] way and they were 40 years in the
[1:27:42] wilderness but the main purpose and God
[1:27:44] sending a prophet was to bring the
[1:27:47] people to their promised land and you'll
[1:27:50] notice in that did not stop after Moses
[1:27:54] was dead Moses ministry was finished but
[1:27:58] the commission of the Joshua Commission
[1:28:01] was to finish what the message was meant
[1:28:03] to do and that's to bring them as he
[1:28:06] says the children of Israel now the
[1:28:08] focuses is not Moses Moses my servant is
[1:28:12] dead but the focus is right now now that
[1:28:15] he's gone
[1:28:16] arise and let's finish this work let's
[1:28:19] go into our land and so you can see that
[1:28:22] you can see yourselves in this scripture
[1:28:24] because we realize the focus is not on
[1:28:27] the prophet as much as it is now taking
[1:28:30] the message and bringing the people into
[1:28:32] their individual here inheritance that's
[1:28:35] a huge change so if you wouldn't mind
[1:28:37] let's add in chapter 5 and verse 10 and
[1:28:40] I don't know if I'll get to this but
[1:28:42] let's add it in so we can refer to it if
[1:28:44] we get time Joshua chapter 5 and verse
[1:28:47] 10 and the children of Israel in
[1:28:50] encamped Gilgal and kept the Passover on
[1:28:54] the fourteenth day of the month that
[1:28:55] even the plains of Jericho and they did
[1:28:58] eat of the old corn of the land on the
[1:29:01] morrow after the Passover unleavened
[1:29:03] cakes and parched corn in the self-same
[1:29:07] day and the manna ceased on the morrow
[1:29:10] after they had eaten of the old corn of
[1:29:13] the land neither had the children of
[1:29:15] Israel manna anymore but they did eat of
[1:29:18] the fruit of the land of Canaan that
[1:29:21] year so the diet of these believers now
[1:29:24] after Moses was gone the diet had
[1:29:27] changed where for forty years they ate
[1:29:30] manna now they're eating the old corn
[1:29:32] so the diet had changed even so many
[1:29:35] changes amen
[1:29:37] father bless your word today we pray
[1:29:39] that you'll help us that you encouraged
[1:29:41] us that you encouraged the brokenhearted
[1:29:43] that you'd strengthened the believers
[1:29:45] here Lord and God that you'd through the
[1:29:47] Word of God just annoying it Lord and
[1:29:49] coming close and personal to us this
[1:29:51] morning
[1:29:52] so we commit this service to you in
[1:29:54] Jesus name Amen amen god bless you we
[1:29:57] realize anything that we do in Jesus
[1:29:59] name that's an important thing and we do
[1:30:02] this in Jesus name today and do it in
[1:30:04] his name praise the Lord
[1:30:07] so in the changes that we want to look
[1:30:10] at from Josh from Moses to Joshua and
[1:30:14] I'm sure your pastor is ministered on
[1:30:16] these things and you've heard other
[1:30:18] ministers refer to the Joshua Commission
[1:30:21] and that's that originates out of the
[1:30:23] message as the Prophet preached as I was
[1:30:26] with Moses so will I be with thee and
[1:30:28] the Prophet begin to notice that even in
[1:30:32] his own ministry as he was moving from
[1:30:34] the first and second pole as I was as
[1:30:37] Moses God led the prophets Joshua
[1:30:40] chapter 1 and he read that Scripture
[1:30:41] because we're starting to see the
[1:30:43] beginning stages of a transition in the
[1:30:46] message from the first and second pole
[1:30:49] to the third pole and so people don't
[1:30:52] realize how big a transition that is
[1:30:54] people I think sometimes don't realize
[1:30:56] how many changes took place from Moses
[1:31:00] to Joshua in that well how it would
[1:31:03] affect the people people wouldn't
[1:31:04] realize that it's the same mighty God
[1:31:07] that's leading the message it's the same
[1:31:10] mighty God that's leading the people the
[1:31:12] same God that worked through what he did
[1:31:14] through Moses is the same God here today
[1:31:17] working in his people to accomplish and
[1:31:20] finish Redemption and to bring us back
[1:31:23] to what we're called - so now we've been
[1:31:25] on that subject the whole weekend but we
[1:31:26] want to elaborate on it in the in the
[1:31:28] subject of Moses and Joshua it's very
[1:31:31] important that we see a sons and
[1:31:33] daughters of God no matter who we are
[1:31:35] it's very important that we understand
[1:31:37] this transition and today I want to
[1:31:40] respectfully but clearly and plainly
[1:31:42] talk about it a little bit so that we
[1:31:44] understand
[1:31:45] and why do we talk about these things
[1:31:47] it's because that we might catch these
[1:31:50] things and live under the correct
[1:31:52] expectations for God now remember I said
[1:31:56] the first night that we want to be under
[1:31:58] the right expectations we don't want to
[1:32:01] be looking for something that's already
[1:32:02] past we want to look for the expectation
[1:32:06] now for what God has for us now if we
[1:32:10] linger in the past under the days of the
[1:32:13] past we fall short of taking our land if
[1:32:16] in the days of Moses they wanted to go
[1:32:18] back to the days of Moses they fall
[1:32:20] short of taking their own land so that's
[1:32:23] how important it is that it holds us
[1:32:25] back when we look back and look back and
[1:32:27] look back it keeps us from our promise
[1:32:29] and so and and I want to make this point
[1:32:32] because we've been talking about
[1:32:34] maturity it is in maturity to stay back
[1:32:37] and not move on with this transition it
[1:32:41] is great spiritual maturity to cling
[1:32:44] back to the days of Moses can you say
[1:32:47] and you understand what I'm saying it's
[1:32:49] huge in maturity to clean back to the
[1:32:51] days of the wilderness and Moses and all
[1:32:53] that it's in maturity just want to stay
[1:32:55] back there to some people it's a
[1:32:58] security blanket they feel better if I
[1:33:00] can just stay talking about the days of
[1:33:02] Moses it's a security blanket and you
[1:33:05] feel safe in that but it's not really
[1:33:06] safe because you if you lay back there
[1:33:09] and stay in that day you'll die
[1:33:10] spiritually
[1:33:12] you will die spiritually if you stay
[1:33:15] back in the days of Moses because why
[1:33:18] the pillar fire is moving on message is
[1:33:22] moving on amen so the people had to
[1:33:25] catch the change in Joshua Commission
[1:33:27] back then and today we have to catch it
[1:33:30] too people have to be amateur people to
[1:33:33] take be able to take this on that's what
[1:33:35] I've been preaching it takes amateur
[1:33:37] people it takes the message maturing but
[1:33:39] it takes amateur people to take to latch
[1:33:41] onto this and that's why we're praying
[1:33:43] this weekend and I've been praying with
[1:33:45] you Lord mature me take all my immature
[1:33:48] knees out Lord let me look at this
[1:33:50] message the way I'm supposed to look at
[1:33:52] it
[1:33:52] let me not reach back to some security
[1:33:55] blanket of yours even brother Graham
[1:33:57] said about your experience he says if
[1:33:59] you're experienced your testimony is
[1:34:00] that the Lord gave me the Holy Ghost 30
[1:34:02] years ago and that was the last time he
[1:34:04] says he said your back slid the Prophet
[1:34:07] said that he said you ought to be able
[1:34:09] to say my experiences fresh with me
[1:34:11] right now
[1:34:13] amen
[1:34:15] thank God for what he did 30 years ago
[1:34:17] but the your experience is how close are
[1:34:19] you to the Lord today so in the
[1:34:24] wilderness we had a people following a
[1:34:26] prophet following the message but in the
[1:34:30] wilderness the people had huge
[1:34:32] immaturity
[1:34:33] how many know that and I was in the
[1:34:36] office I jotted a few down because I
[1:34:38] forgot to type them in but I thought
[1:34:40] what were some of the immaturity sand
[1:34:41] won't be we'll all be speaking a lot
[1:34:43] about these today but I jotted some down
[1:34:44] of course the children of Israel under a
[1:34:46] prophet in the message were murmurers
[1:34:48] were complainers they murmured in their
[1:34:51] tents which today would be their houses
[1:34:53] they talked about things that they
[1:34:55] shouldn't talk about they gossiped they
[1:34:59] tore people down they tore Moses down
[1:35:01] they talked about things they it was an
[1:35:04] immaturity in them I think we ought to
[1:35:06] grow out of those immaturity
[1:35:07] they were negative they were
[1:35:10] disrespectful in their tents they were
[1:35:12] disrespectful sometimes to Moses they
[1:35:14] were disrespectful sometimes to one
[1:35:16] another they were sign seekers can you
[1:35:18] say Amen
[1:35:20] if there wasn't a sign going on then
[1:35:23] they got disappointed wanting to go back
[1:35:25] to Egypt if there wasn't something
[1:35:27] supernatural God they got disappointed I
[1:35:29] want to go back to Egypt
[1:35:30] that's immaturity God sees that as
[1:35:33] immature children God can perform the
[1:35:35] supernatural God can do it anytime he
[1:35:37] still does it today but we as Christians
[1:35:40] cannot depend on that all the time to
[1:35:43] keep us in the faith and they followed a
[1:35:48] sin and Korah Dathan cornrows approves
[1:35:50] the disrespect towards Moses we've seen
[1:35:52] that spirit rise up the last five or six
[1:35:54] years especially in the message a
[1:35:56] disrespect from Dathan and Korah and so
[1:35:59] then and then the children of Israel
[1:36:01] immature that one day there one day
[1:36:03] they're thinking about going back to
[1:36:05] Egypt and talking about going back to
[1:36:06] Egypt can you imagine come out with a
[1:36:08] prophet brought out of denominations in
[1:36:11] the world and when they win the tough
[1:36:13] times hit and emotional times if they're
[1:36:16] entertaining thoughts and saying maybe
[1:36:17] we should go back to Egypt you know what
[1:36:20] that is
[1:36:20] it's immaturity its babies spiritually
[1:36:24] God wants the people that are all in God
[1:36:28] wants the people that's reached the
[1:36:30] point of no return
[1:36:33] God wants to hear the faith to say I
[1:36:35] don't care what happens I don't care if
[1:36:36] I ever see another miracle again I don't
[1:36:39] care if God ever shows his presence
[1:36:40] again Jimmy I'm all-in and I'm gonna
[1:36:43] carry this thing out by the grace of God
[1:36:45] if I don't feel God I don't have to feel
[1:36:48] God I love to feel God but if I don't
[1:36:50] have to feel them I'm gonna continue
[1:36:52] serving them anyway that's what God
[1:36:54] wants to hear hey man that's maturity
[1:36:57] into faith can you say man and so what
[1:37:00] one day they're thinking go back to
[1:37:01] Egypt but another thing the next day
[1:37:03] they would they were their emotions just
[1:37:05] sewing everywhere and for one day then
[1:37:07] the next you didn't know where they
[1:37:08] stood and one day they're wanting to go
[1:37:10] back and evening the next day get
[1:37:11] excited about a miracle and now they're
[1:37:12] all in there ready to follow Moses again
[1:37:14] these are immature T's they were up and
[1:37:16] down with their emotions but I think the
[1:37:18] greatest immaturity and the children of
[1:37:20] Israel is their dependence upon a
[1:37:23] prophet as their attachment to God and I
[1:37:29] hope I said that right and today I might
[1:37:31] say some things that I I'm praying that
[1:37:33] I pray that I say them respectfully
[1:37:35] because nobody believes that God sent a
[1:37:38] prophet and this is God's prophet for
[1:37:39] the hour William Graham nobody believes
[1:37:41] they're stronger than I do
[1:37:42] I believe it with all my heart I'll
[1:37:44] never disrespect that but I want to say
[1:37:47] some things today I want to say I'm
[1:37:48] respectfully that the children is are
[1:37:50] one of their immaturity ziz their
[1:37:52] dependence on having to have that
[1:37:55] prophet having to have him there and if
[1:38:00] he's not there having to talk about when
[1:38:02] he was there and to keep that going and
[1:38:04] to keep in that realm it's a security
[1:38:07] blanket can you say men and those in the
[1:38:10] wilderness they could not have survived
[1:38:11] without Moses they had a lack of faith
[1:38:14] they were fearful they were up and down
[1:38:16] and so their dependence was on the
[1:38:19] Prophet
[1:38:21] and when God moved him into the Promised
[1:38:24] Land they had to die to that immaturity
[1:38:27] because Moses was no longer around and
[1:38:32] there had to be an individual faith rise
[1:38:35] to take their land it's like God has
[1:38:38] given something to you but it's not
[1:38:41] gonna come easy to you you're gonna have
[1:38:43] to fight for it
[1:38:43] and Moses won't be around I've given the
[1:38:46] Holy Ghost Joshua to encourage you to
[1:38:49] lead your right path
[1:38:50] but you've got to stand on your own two
[1:38:53] feet and you've got to take your
[1:38:54] individual leg because this isn't about
[1:38:58] standing around glorifying of what God
[1:39:00] does through a prophet it's looking to
[1:39:01] see what's God going to do through me
[1:39:03] now it's my inheritance what's my life
[1:39:07] in Christ
[1:39:08] hey man everybody on board this morning
[1:39:11] praise be to God so now is Mirman
[1:39:15] complaining but the worst thing is the
[1:39:16] dependence on that prophet let me just
[1:39:19] step back here and see now when we
[1:39:21] entered the days of the message when God
[1:39:22] sent a prophet in this hour just like
[1:39:24] Moses day it was a change when a voice
[1:39:27] came to call us out of the world and out
[1:39:29] of Egypt and out of denominations that
[1:39:31] was a great transition in Scripture
[1:39:33] Malachi 4:5 Luke 17 30 all these things
[1:39:37] that our scripture for the last days
[1:39:38] that was a transition that was a
[1:39:40] movement in scripture and all of us
[1:39:43] observed it many were here back when
[1:39:45] that took place actually when the
[1:39:46] Prophet was here it's nice to have the
[1:39:48] two generations here worshiping the same
[1:39:51] Lord can you say man we got ones that
[1:39:53] were in brother branham's meetings who
[1:39:55] got ones that followed and watched all
[1:39:57] that huge transition of God blessing us
[1:40:00] was a major prophet to this earth but
[1:40:03] we've moved on from those days and I
[1:40:07] think each generation has to respect one
[1:40:09] another
[1:40:11] can you say man oh thank god not every
[1:40:14] but not all the old people died in the
[1:40:17] wilderness just in that there was a
[1:40:19] there was a Joshua and Caleb and Caleb
[1:40:22] got old can you say man but he's seen
[1:40:24] the transition and he's wanting to go
[1:40:26] get his land hazel or Caleb all caught
[1:40:31] up in Moses he said no no I want to go
[1:40:33] get my land I want that mountain and he
[1:40:36] was an old guy so you had the young guys
[1:40:39] and they had their old guys but as long
[1:40:42] as they were led by the Holy Ghost
[1:40:43] they're gonna all go get their land and
[1:40:47] when you see that happen it's a blessed
[1:40:49] thing taking place nothing worse than
[1:40:51] the old ones trying to pull the people
[1:40:53] back to the days of Moses nothing worse
[1:40:55] than that young people don't want to go
[1:40:57] there the young generation don't want to
[1:40:58] go there we want to move forward nothing
[1:41:00] worse than the old people trying to take
[1:41:01] us back to the days of Moses but it's
[1:41:04] also nothing worse than the young people
[1:41:06] disrespecting the older generation amen
[1:41:12] praise the Lord these things I didn't
[1:41:14] put in my notes I'm just saying they're
[1:41:15] coming from somewhere praise the Lord
[1:41:19] so if I don't stay with my notes though
[1:41:21] we we won't get very far I learned 45
[1:41:25] minutes last night my you can tell I'm
[1:41:29] right at home here that's for sure
[1:41:32] yeah so much hay on my fork and the
[1:41:36] farmer that had you know there was a
[1:41:39] farmer that was asked you know one time
[1:41:42] he came to church and he attended church
[1:41:46] and there was nobody there
[1:41:47] but just the preacher and the farmer
[1:41:49] nobody showed up and so the preacher got
[1:41:52] up and he said what do i do today
[1:41:56] nobody's here the farmer says well said
[1:41:58] when I go out to feed my feed my cows or
[1:42:00] whatever he says so if only one comes
[1:42:03] around I feed him you know I feed him
[1:42:05] anyway
[1:42:07] and so the preacher took his text and he
[1:42:10] preached just as hard as if a thousand
[1:42:12] people were there and preached and
[1:42:13] farmers said Amen he was the only one
[1:42:15] there you know preached about 9:45
[1:42:18] minutes just like I did last night
[1:42:20] preached everything he knew and some
[1:42:22] things he didn't know he come out and
[1:42:25] shook the preachers hand because it
[1:42:28] shipped the farmers in because it was
[1:42:29] the only one to shake hands with just
[1:42:30] Illman he said well how did I do farmer
[1:42:33] says well he says I know when I go out
[1:42:34] and feed my cows he says I feed him even
[1:42:38] if one shows up but I don't feed him the
[1:42:40] whole barn a hay so he got his point
[1:42:45] across again that's how I feel there's
[1:42:50] just so much to preach praise the Lord
[1:42:53] so you know when we entered that change
[1:42:57] I don't want to spend too much time on
[1:42:58] it but it was a great movement to see
[1:43:00] the Prophet come on of the scenes and we
[1:43:05] have that was a shadow of the Prophet
[1:43:07] coming in the last days because we
[1:43:09] received a prophet on the level of Moses
[1:43:11] that was a shadow and because it's a
[1:43:13] shadow in the Old Testament remember
[1:43:15] Paul said the Old Testament was shadows
[1:43:18] and types in Hebrews he said that there
[1:43:21] were shadow of things to come and so if
[1:43:23] you have a shadow and it's a real true
[1:43:25] scriptural shadow then the real is
[1:43:27] coming and you can't work around your
[1:43:30] shadows can you say man that's the
[1:43:32] problem with message churches any
[1:43:34] churches and a lot of noise is they work
[1:43:36] outside of the shadows and interpret the
[1:43:37] Bible themselves
[1:43:38] you can't work outside the shadows and
[1:43:40] types if God sent a prophet before he
[1:43:43] can send a prophet again you have no
[1:43:45] right to take that out of the scripture
[1:43:48] and say he could bring prophets all
[1:43:49] through the Bible even balsa prophet but
[1:43:51] he can't do it today you have no right
[1:43:52] to do that who died and made you
[1:43:55] interpreter of the word a man so you
[1:43:59] can't get around the shadows and the
[1:44:01] shadow moses shows a prophet coming
[1:44:04] taking us out of egypt which meant
[1:44:06] presents the world any bible scholar
[1:44:08] tell you that egypt represents the world
[1:44:10] it represents bondage of not only the
[1:44:13] bondage of the world but bondage of
[1:44:15] denominations the people of god under
[1:44:18] the bondage of domination
[1:44:19] how does God get them out of that he
[1:44:21] sends a prophet so that you're not
[1:44:24] going to work around your shadows can
[1:44:25] you say man and so there's a transition
[1:44:28] that we see under Moses coming calling
[1:44:30] us out of Egypt bringing us the word to
[1:44:33] live by and and there's other places in
[1:44:35] the Old Testament that show that so the
[1:44:37] people were in bondage after 400 years a
[1:44:40] time for a deliverance came God called
[1:44:43] Moses to the desert gave them a
[1:44:45] commission gave them two signs now as
[1:44:47] I'm talking about this you can see the
[1:44:49] shadows of Moses happen exactly like
[1:44:52] they did today four hundred years of
[1:44:55] bondage time for deliverance God calls a
[1:44:58] prophet gives him two signs he rose in
[1:45:01] faith to the challenge of Pharaoh
[1:45:02] holding God's children bodies said let
[1:45:04] my people go and and so then then they
[1:45:07] came out of Egypt by a mighty hand of
[1:45:10] God they were in the journey of the
[1:45:12] wilderness for forty years signs and
[1:45:14] wonders followed that great message
[1:45:15] ministry but then after that the word
[1:45:18] was given from the mountain to the
[1:45:21] people and when the word was given there
[1:45:26] was a cloud on the mountain Exodus 24
[1:45:30] and then right after the cloud appears
[1:45:33] the word comes to the people right after
[1:45:36] the cloud and and so that this goes back
[1:45:39] to the time of the end time when the
[1:45:40] seals are open and and the opening the
[1:45:42] word comes to his people so I can go on
[1:45:44] and on to show you the shadows are
[1:45:47] perfectly to bring us to what happened
[1:45:49] today even with the cloud can you say
[1:45:52] man so I didn't preach on that we've
[1:45:54] already observed and seen those things
[1:45:57] take place and but something after that
[1:46:01] after many years there's a reality of
[1:46:04] something happening and it wasn't it
[1:46:06] wasn't Moses that fulfilled the final
[1:46:09] purpose of God's people
[1:46:12] so stay with the shadows now if the
[1:46:16] Bible would have read that Moses himself
[1:46:18] as a man would have been the one that
[1:46:21] lead the people in the promised land and
[1:46:23] finished the message then we would have
[1:46:26] seen that in the Bible but we can't get
[1:46:29] around the shadows and types and the
[1:46:32] shadow says that Moses my servant is
[1:46:34] dead now Joshua take up the people and
[1:46:38] take him into their life can't get
[1:46:41] around the shadows can you say men and
[1:46:43] so we find in this stark reality that
[1:46:46] that Moses now died and never went into
[1:46:50] the Promised Land himself at least at
[1:46:52] least back in that day never physically
[1:46:54] went into the promised land and so we're
[1:46:56] coming to a very critical point here and
[1:46:59] I'd like you to put your seatbelts on
[1:47:00] spiritually and I'm going to say some
[1:47:04] shaking things so now who now when Moses
[1:47:07] was in the wilderness do you know that
[1:47:09] there was those whose hearts were back
[1:47:11] in Egypt they wanted to go back and so
[1:47:16] they stayed on many of them but they
[1:47:18] were miserable and then when the spies
[1:47:20] went to view the land there was those
[1:47:21] who were too afraid to go they were
[1:47:24] happy staying in what they thought was a
[1:47:27] safe place in the wilderness under the
[1:47:30] Prophet now I know these points are
[1:47:33] simple but I want you to catch them
[1:47:34] there were people that were perfectly
[1:47:37] content staying in the wilderness they
[1:47:43] were in the message and they were
[1:47:45] content to stay there they felt that was
[1:47:47] their safe place but I'm telling you God
[1:47:51] has called this bride to something else
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:55] but there were people like that and
[1:47:57] Jesus said in John 649 they they says
[1:48:01] mole he says they died in the wilderness
[1:48:03] your father's died in the wilderness
[1:48:06] Jesus spoke to a religious people and
[1:48:09] said your father's ate manna in the
[1:48:11] wilderness and are dead he spoke to
[1:48:14] those that were disbelieving stayed in
[1:48:16] the wilderness under the prophets
[1:48:17] message they ate manna in the wilderness
[1:48:19] they're dead they died in the wilderness
[1:48:21] so no matter if a person comes under
[1:48:23] this by birth or by being a witness to
[1:48:26] it if they don't come with Joshua we can
[1:48:29] make the point if you don't move on with
[1:48:32] Joshua death sets in spiritual death
[1:48:38] sets in to our lives if we don't move on
[1:48:42] with the Joshua Commission really under
[1:48:45] a prophet under prophets message in a
[1:48:48] message church spiritual death can set
[1:48:51] in to a message Church I've seen it I've
[1:48:54] seen it friends and why is it you don't
[1:48:58] move on with the pillar of fire you
[1:49:00] don't move on to the Joshua Commission
[1:49:03] spiritual death they all died in the
[1:49:05] wilderness under Moses under a prophet
[1:49:07] spiritual death can set in a host died
[1:49:10] in there and some of us and so that can
[1:49:13] happen today spiritually people can die
[1:49:15] spiritually and not even realize their
[1:49:18] day because there's a safety zone they
[1:49:20] try to stay in of just talking about
[1:49:22] Moses and being under his leadership and
[1:49:24] did you know if you read your Bible you
[1:49:27] know some wept for days when he died
[1:49:29] they just wept and wept and wept and
[1:49:31] they wanted to stay there and they
[1:49:33] wanted Moses to come back and same thing
[1:49:35] happened with Elijah when Elijah went up
[1:49:38] in a chariot there were men that come
[1:49:40] around Elijah and says we think we know
[1:49:42] where Elijah is that
[1:49:44] we're gonna go find him would you go
[1:49:46] with us these things are right in the
[1:49:48] scripture you believers watch these
[1:49:51] things in the message take place these
[1:49:53] things return ministry all these it's
[1:49:55] right in the Bible they're so caught up
[1:49:57] and that's such a safety zone for them
[1:49:59] that the only hope for this is to get
[1:50:02] Moses backer to find Elijah to go find
[1:50:04] him he's gonna come back he's gonna and
[1:50:06] they were all at the gravesite in
[1:50:08] 1965-66 and Easter looking for him to
[1:50:11] come back why they're too tied to Moses
[1:50:14] and too tied to the prophets ministry
[1:50:20] these things are real they happen
[1:50:22] looking for a lot we're gonna go find
[1:50:23] Elijah and Elijah said you know you're
[1:50:25] not gonna find him but he already knew a
[1:50:26] double portion of his spirited come on
[1:50:28] him so this is no reason disrespect to
[1:50:32] Elijah but is that they people can't
[1:50:33] realize the first scripture in Joshua
[1:50:36] one if they would get a revelation of
[1:50:38] the first line in Joshua one look at
[1:50:41] your Bible read what it says that people
[1:50:43] need a revelation over the first line in
[1:50:44] Joshua one now after the death of Moses
[1:50:50] the servant of the Lord how about the
[1:50:53] first line of verse to Moses my servant
[1:50:55] is dead now friends I say this
[1:50:59] respectfully God uses live ministry can
[1:51:05] you say man
[1:51:07] and God by His grace today news
[1:51:10] technology to not not to get just the
[1:51:13] personality of the Prophet but to hold
[1:51:16] the word there on tape and on CD and all
[1:51:19] these things because it was stored up
[1:51:21] food for us because we're not going to
[1:51:23] get into a promised land without the
[1:51:24] food the word he said is part of how
[1:51:29] we're getting in there can you say man
[1:51:31] so I'm not against the food I'm just
[1:51:33] saying that Moses my servant is dead
[1:51:35] people people today don't even have a
[1:51:37] revelation to see that transition Moses
[1:51:40] my servant God says he was my servant
[1:51:43] but he's dead he's finished his course
[1:51:46] he's been faithful everybody still like
[1:51:52] me people today don't realize brother
[1:51:57] Branham is dead now he's not really dead
[1:51:59] he's sleeping because he was a believer
[1:52:00] which I believe he is he's gonna come up
[1:52:02] in the resurrection can you believe that
[1:52:05] but God's saying here you could have
[1:52:07] said that about Moses so he's gonna come
[1:52:09] back he did he come back in with Jesus
[1:52:11] transfer Transfiguration is in another
[1:52:14] body we understand that but God said it
[1:52:17] my servant is dead and now it's time to
[1:52:20] go on and finish what this message is so
[1:52:24] if you try to stay back in the days of
[1:52:26] Moses in his personality you're gonna
[1:52:31] have a problem in the first two verses
[1:52:34] he's trying to get the people to
[1:52:36] transition away from that because
[1:52:39] they'll never be able to take faith to
[1:52:41] finish this and come into their own land
[1:52:43] if they keep glorifying Moses can you
[1:52:49] say Amen so we see then that that
[1:52:55] somewhat for days when Moses was gone
[1:52:58] only two of all that coming to the
[1:53:00] message went in with Joshua can you say
[1:53:02] Amen
[1:53:03] as soon as he died right away God opens
[1:53:06] the Commission Moses my servant is dead
[1:53:08] and as soon as he said that he opens up
[1:53:11] the Joshua Commission he said Joshua
[1:53:13] take the people under their land
[1:53:15] he didn't waste no time it wasn't an I
[1:53:18] don't want to spend another 40 years
[1:53:19] here God said no no he didn't waste no
[1:53:21] time he's fulfilled his course my
[1:53:24] servant has fulfilled his course he's
[1:53:26] done his work right now it's time right
[1:53:28] now to take up and take the people into
[1:53:30] their land no more 40 years it's time to
[1:53:34] go now oh praise the Lord
[1:53:36] maybe you're feeling that this weekend
[1:53:38] hey man you're feeling that in your
[1:53:41] heart it's time now for you to take your
[1:53:43] land
[1:53:44] praise the Lord so somebody said a few
[1:53:46] months ago somebody quoted it says the
[1:53:49] only thing that Joshua did was pointed
[1:53:52] the people to Moses listen now you think
[1:53:58] about that statement somebody said this
[1:54:00] the other day on the Internet the only
[1:54:02] thing that Joshua did was pointed the
[1:54:04] people to Moses that's not true
[1:54:09] that's not the only thing Joshua did now
[1:54:13] did they read Moses yes did they get
[1:54:15] together after a battle after they won
[1:54:17] ai they got together and read the whole
[1:54:19] book of Moses they stayed in the message
[1:54:22] but to say that the only thing that
[1:54:25] Joshua did was pointed the people back
[1:54:27] to Moses that's a lie that's not true
[1:54:29] that's that person that said that
[1:54:31] doesn't even have a revelation of the
[1:54:33] Joshua Commission and brother Branham
[1:54:36] had a revelation of the Joshua
[1:54:37] Commission he was in the initial stages
[1:54:39] of it by the word that came through him
[1:54:41] was to begin the Joshua Commission but
[1:54:44] then he passed away and died can you say
[1:54:46] man but the Holy Ghost would take the
[1:54:48] people on to the rest of this and so you
[1:54:50] cannot say that the only thing Joshua
[1:54:53] did was point of the people to Moses our
[1:54:55] to listen to Moses that wasn't the only
[1:54:57] thing it wasn't good enough just to
[1:54:59] sitting to listen to Moses if that was
[1:55:01] the shadow then Joshua would say the
[1:55:03] only thing left to do is to sit here and
[1:55:05] listen to Moses Joshua was saying Joshua
[1:55:13] yes we do listen to the message but
[1:55:15] we're not gonna sit here and that's the
[1:55:17] only thing we do to the rapture we're
[1:55:18] gonna get up and fight this battle amen
[1:55:39] and so it's an effort to and that when
[1:55:41] people say that it's an effort to
[1:55:43] continue an emphasis on Moses it's safer
[1:55:47] for some people because we know that God
[1:55:50] works through the Prophet God
[1:55:52] supernaturally worked through you and
[1:55:54] that's wonderful and I love to hear the
[1:55:57] testimonies and I love to hear the
[1:55:58] reports I love to be around men that
[1:56:01] were with him I love that I would never
[1:56:03] disrespect it I was around Perry green
[1:56:05] quite a bit and he was around brother
[1:56:06] Branham Allah he's gone on now many of
[1:56:09] those brothers have gone on but I loved
[1:56:10] listening to it but I can never come
[1:56:13] into my full inheritance
[1:56:14] just by listening to what God did
[1:56:17] through William Branham that's not my
[1:56:22] ticket into a rapture I'll never make a
[1:56:24] rapture by listening to that if it
[1:56:27] builds my faith
[1:56:28] praise the Lord you know when I got the
[1:56:31] Holy Ghost at 16 you know the Lord
[1:56:34] touched my heart and received the Holy
[1:56:36] Ghost I don't know about you but I after
[1:56:38] that I developed an incredible craving
[1:56:41] to hear the word of God and I think
[1:56:44] someone who gets the Holy Ghost that's
[1:56:45] what they do I knew I grew up in this
[1:56:47] message world when I got the Holy Ghost
[1:56:49] the difference was for me is that I know
[1:56:51] mom and dad have said it I've heard it
[1:56:52] quoted but I got a craving to hear it
[1:56:54] for myself
[1:56:54] and this is what I concluded I said if
[1:56:56] God was gracious enough to send a
[1:56:58] prophet on the level of Moses or greater
[1:57:00] to my generation in my own language then
[1:57:04] if God took the time to do that then I
[1:57:06] can take the time as a young 16 year old
[1:57:09] man to find out what he said
[1:57:11] and the next three or four five years of
[1:57:14] my life people didn't see me a lot
[1:57:16] because basically I worked I came home I
[1:57:18] did my school then when I was out of
[1:57:20] school
[1:57:20] I brought tapes home out of the library
[1:57:22] to church and I just fed on this message
[1:57:24] for about four or five years that's all
[1:57:26] I did because I thought if God sent him
[1:57:28] I ought to take the time to find out
[1:57:30] what he said but when I studied it and
[1:57:34] when I and then it opened the Bible to
[1:57:37] me it will open the word to me I come
[1:57:39] closer to Jesus Christ and for me I
[1:57:43] didn't just see the glorious works that
[1:57:45] God did for you William Branham I got a
[1:57:48] hold of a faith to realize what is God
[1:57:51] gonna do through me because if he can do
[1:57:55] it through William Branham he can do it
[1:57:56] through me and I don't know how people
[1:57:59] don't some people don't catch that
[1:58:00] because they're good enough just to hear
[1:58:02] what what God did through brother Brent
[1:58:03] I didn't catch all that I realized in
[1:58:06] reading that and built my faith to
[1:58:07] realize when he's finished when his work
[1:58:09] is finished which he was by that time
[1:58:11] then it created faith in me to realize
[1:58:13] that the same God is still alive leading
[1:58:16] his people what is in this for me what's
[1:58:19] my part
[1:58:20] [Applause]
[1:58:23] praise the Lord
[1:58:24] but he died Moses died his commission
[1:58:28] was over Moses Commission was done you
[1:58:33] can't find any shout or even words from
[1:58:35] Joshua that say put moment we need to
[1:58:38] put Moses back in the pulpit you can't
[1:58:45] find the words from Joshua we need to
[1:58:47] put Moses back in the pulpit or we need
[1:58:51] to put brother branham back in the
[1:58:52] pulpit there's no shadow for that
[1:58:54] there's no direction for that there's
[1:58:57] nothing there that shows us that's the
[1:59:00] next step it's a bit of a deception
[1:59:07] if not a full deception and I have my
[1:59:11] personal opinions on that but I'm gonna
[1:59:13] keep them to myself but I'm staying with
[1:59:16] the scripture here I'm staying with the
[1:59:18] scripture you know your Joshua saying
[1:59:21] that it's time that we put the Moses
[1:59:24] back in the pulpit no no no no God's
[1:59:29] taking his people on not leaving the
[1:59:32] word now not leaving the message not
[1:59:34] leaving the word but the word that he
[1:59:36] said comes into the heart of his bride
[1:59:38] by the Holy Ghost and takes us on to our
[1:59:41] individual land and if we stay back in
[1:59:45] the old days will dry up and die
[1:59:47] we'll die spiritually can you say Amen
[1:59:50] so Moses did not take the people into
[1:59:54] the land that's the shadow and he could
[1:59:56] not do it as that as he died he could
[1:59:59] not do it first of all he couldn't do it
[2:00:00] cuz he died he couldn't take the people
[2:00:02] on because God uses live ministry he
[2:00:04] couldn't take the people in the bronze
[2:00:06] line cuz he died but we know the other
[2:00:07] reason that he had a temper there or
[2:00:09] whatever and God said kept him out of
[2:00:11] the promised land
[2:00:11] we understand he made a mistake prophet
[2:00:17] the prophet made a mistake prophets make
[2:00:21] mistakes when they're speaking thus
[2:00:23] saith the Lord
[2:00:24] it's the infallible Word of God but as a
[2:00:26] human being they can make mistakes
[2:00:29] [Applause]
[2:00:32] a man so Moses did not fulfill the final
[2:00:37] commission of placing the people but the
[2:00:39] word that he gave and the Holy Ghost
[2:00:41] leadership under Joshua placed the
[2:00:44] people in the promised land this
[2:00:46] transition is so crucial that we
[2:00:48] understand can you say ma'am what a
[2:00:50] crucial transition to make all this
[2:00:52] under the same message that's coming the
[2:00:54] last days this is so important because
[2:00:56] that I I preached here to our new
[2:00:59] generation that's coming up who was not
[2:01:01] even here when the Prophet was here it
[2:01:03] would be a disservice for me to try to
[2:01:05] teach them to live back in the days of
[2:01:08] Moses and look back and though I would
[2:01:10] do a disservice to those young people to
[2:01:12] try it if you just relive all that he'll
[2:01:14] be fine and you'll make the rapture
[2:01:16] that's deceiving the young people and
[2:01:19] that's all the experience you need is
[2:01:21] just to believe God send a prophet
[2:01:22] no the devil's believe it's not just
[2:01:27] that we believe God sent a prophet but
[2:01:29] that's that we keep believing to find
[2:01:32] our inheritance of who we are in Christ
[2:01:34] you have an inheritance in Christ you
[2:01:37] have a place a position God wants you to
[2:01:41] be stepping into that and living it out
[2:01:42] praise the Lord
[2:01:44] so now there's so much more we can say
[2:01:47] on this but we want to move along so
[2:01:48] there's death in there if we stay and
[2:01:50] not move on with that transition there's
[2:01:52] life in the Joshua Commission now people
[2:01:56] are dying left and right friends
[2:01:57] people are dying sometimes even under
[2:01:59] this message they're dying and sometimes
[2:02:02] if you had a lot of signs and wonders
[2:02:04] people would perk up and say all good
[2:02:05] we're back in the days of Prophet again
[2:02:07] they would perk up with signs and
[2:02:09] wonders I rejoice in signs and wonders
[2:02:11] but that doesn't make me perk up as much
[2:02:13] as when I see an individual in this
[2:02:15] message get so filled with the Holy
[2:02:17] Ghost that they're living overcoming
[2:02:19] life every day and they're conquering
[2:02:21] the devil's in their lives
[2:02:23] and they've taken their land that's what
[2:02:26] makes me sit up and take pay attention
[2:02:29] but if somebody's in and out and they oh
[2:02:32] they're all in church for several months
[2:02:33] because signs and wonders took place and
[2:02:35] then you don't see them for several
[2:02:36] months because they're discouraged and
[2:02:38] may leave the message that doesn't make
[2:02:39] me impress friends it doesn't impress me
[2:02:42] when they can come and rejoice and hear
[2:02:44] all the stories but when I see a banner
[2:02:46] woman in their struggles in their hard
[2:02:48] times they're battling it out every day
[2:02:50] because that's our our inheritance is
[2:02:53] our life in the Holy Ghost every day
[2:02:57] that's our inheritance our life in the
[2:03:00] Holy Ghost that's what makes us so we
[2:03:03] understand let me just say this so so
[2:03:06] you understand Moses came up in the
[2:03:09] resurrection with Christ how many
[2:03:11] believe that he died but he came up in
[2:03:14] the resurrection with Christ he was
[2:03:16] there
[2:03:16] I believe brother Branham will be up in
[2:03:18] the resurrection and I would be so glad
[2:03:22] to meet him and shout with him and shake
[2:03:26] his hand and thank him for the
[2:03:29] sacrifices probably no other human being
[2:03:31] in the 20th century made as many
[2:03:34] sacrifices for the people of God as
[2:03:36] William Branham did but that's it
[2:03:40] he's my brother brother Brian's my
[2:03:44] brother I'll shake his hand I'll thank
[2:03:46] him for his service I'll thank him for
[2:03:48] being faithful to the call the same God
[2:03:52] that was with Moses was in the Prophet
[2:03:54] and that was a wonderful thing but also
[2:03:56] he's my brother
[2:03:58] the same God that was in William Branham
[2:04:01] is the same God that's in me
[2:04:04] [Applause]
[2:04:07] remember Jesus referring to John the
[2:04:09] Baptist and saying there's not a mirrors
[2:04:11] of the greater man than John born of
[2:04:13] woman but then he turns and says but he
[2:04:16] that's least in the kingdom of God is
[2:04:18] greater than he so let's not get into
[2:04:22] glorifying just one in an age above and
[2:04:25] we're just down here no no he that's
[2:04:27] least in the kingdom it's greater not
[2:04:31] greater than a prophets position but in
[2:04:33] God's eyes all of his sons and daughters
[2:04:35] come into glory is what God's got in
[2:04:38] mind God would get no no joy out of just
[2:04:44] one son coming to adoption it's the
[2:04:47] whole crop
[2:04:49] praise the Lord so I'll shake his hand
[2:04:51] and I would love to meet him and spend
[2:04:54] eternity with him but brother Branham is
[2:04:56] my brother he's not my god so Joshua
[2:05:02] says there's more to this than just
[2:05:04] reading Moses now you need a greater
[2:05:07] faith yourself to drive out the enemy
[2:05:10] now Moses was a law and if in that day
[2:05:14] it was a law and today it's the opening
[2:05:17] of the word so the glory of God after
[2:05:18] Calvary as I said last night it changes
[2:05:21] us and brings us into full Redemption
[2:05:23] but Moses was a law for the people to
[2:05:24] stay in line with but if you would have
[2:05:26] stayed in that law you stay in a cycle
[2:05:28] of that law and there are elements to
[2:05:31] this word that even we've received that
[2:05:34] brought deliverance in other words what
[2:05:35] Moses preached were elements of it to
[2:05:37] bring deliverance and to protect the
[2:05:39] people there were elements to Moses
[2:05:41] message that were meant to protect the
[2:05:43] people from the world can you say mad
[2:05:46] I'm thankful
[2:05:47] and there were elements to the message
[2:05:49] of the hour that were to bring us out of
[2:05:51] denominations there were elements of
[2:05:53] this a message that was about the
[2:05:54] women's dress to show a woman the
[2:05:57] dignity of a true woman how she dresses
[2:05:59] how she acts can you say men this
[2:06:01] message was not to belittle women it's
[2:06:03] actually to restore to the dignity of
[2:06:05] what a woman is
[2:06:07] you know it's the devil that told you
[2:06:10] that this message is to bring women
[2:06:11] under bondage that's the devil this it's
[2:06:14] the complete opposite God's thoughts was
[2:06:17] bringing God's daughters back in line
[2:06:20] with truth the true dignity of what a
[2:06:22] woman is and that's why she needs to be
[2:06:24] respected
[2:06:26] it says there proverbs 31 she's to be
[2:06:28] praised
[2:06:29] yes she fears God can you say man
[2:06:32] she doesn't manifest the beauty of the
[2:06:34] world she manifests the character of God
[2:06:36] she's to be praised God praises her God
[2:06:40] praises are you brother should praise
[2:06:41] her can you say man thank God thank God
[2:06:45] for women of this hour thank God for
[2:06:47] these sisters see why do I stop and do
[2:06:51] this because they don't get enough
[2:06:52] praise for their stand that they're
[2:06:54] making can you say man they get preached
[2:07:00] on a lot and for years in the message
[2:07:02] that's all we preached out if we get the
[2:07:03] women line if we give them dress them
[2:07:04] right they get preached on a lot but
[2:07:06] they don't get complimented on and so I
[2:07:09] say
[2:07:10] these young girls standing with with the
[2:07:12] the glories of modesty standing is that
[2:07:15] you know do you know how much of a
[2:07:16] miracle that is to see these young girls
[2:07:18] here today and saying out of love for
[2:07:20] the Lord I want to manifest not what the
[2:07:23] world's beauty is but to manifest what
[2:07:25] God said in this generation do you know
[2:07:27] how what a paradox that is for them to
[2:07:29] be sitting with you this morning the
[2:07:32] glory of the Lord upon them Thank You
[2:07:34] sisters thank you old elderly sisters
[2:07:38] thank you for your standing many of you
[2:07:41] been living this for counsel years
[2:07:43] countless years you've been laughed at
[2:07:45] you made fun of your in school some of
[2:07:47] you even laughed at you made it fun
[2:07:48] we're not there to see that
[2:07:49] but God seen it and I want to say thank
[2:07:53] you to all these lovely sisters here
[2:07:55] this morning let's give them a hand god
[2:07:57] bless you god bless you
[2:08:04] we brothers don't know the battle
[2:08:07] they've been through we don't haven't
[2:08:10] been laughed at like that so thank you
[2:08:12] for holding that stand some parts of the
[2:08:16] message though were to to bring that
[2:08:18] back some parts of the message just to
[2:08:19] correct Pentecost some parts of the
[2:08:21] message to bring us out of Pentecost
[2:08:23] there's so many elements to the message
[2:08:26] and emphasis from brother Branham to
[2:08:29] bring us out of worldliness and out of
[2:08:31] denominations can you say man and I'm
[2:08:34] trying to get to this point to show you
[2:08:35] that but those are things are very
[2:08:38] important they're still important but to
[2:08:40] a person who's moved on they don't
[2:08:42] necessarily need to hear all of that
[2:08:44] rebuke out of worldliness because
[2:08:47] there's some mature adults that's moved
[2:08:48] on they've got the dress in order
[2:08:50] they've got these other things in order
[2:08:52] so a message church that continues to
[2:08:54] every service preach on the woman's
[2:08:57] dress or the men's dress or worldliness
[2:08:58] they're not emphasizing all this message
[2:09:03] you understand you're not going to get
[2:09:06] the results you're looking for just by
[2:09:08] doing that because we've moved on to the
[2:09:09] inheritance of the Lord if we only
[2:09:12] preached those parts of the message then
[2:09:14] actually you can put people sometimes
[2:09:15] under bondage we have to preach the
[2:09:19] whole counsel of God we have to preach
[2:09:21] the full word can you say Matt so those
[2:09:24] were needed for a time and everyone saw
[2:09:26] the austere I'm a pastor I have to hit
[2:09:29] things the world in this creeps in and
[2:09:30] sometimes you got to hit things but I
[2:09:32] don't take every service on it because
[2:09:34] that's not the emphasis that's not the
[2:09:35] weightier matters of the law
[2:09:39] dress is not the way tears on the way
[2:09:42] dear me matter of fact it's not even
[2:09:44] brother Bram says those things how we
[2:09:46] dress into that he says that's not the
[2:09:47] kingdom of God he says and do you know
[2:09:50] that there's certain things that God
[2:09:51] gives us in the message and in the Bible
[2:09:53] that are protections for this life only
[2:09:56] we won't need them when we get to the
[2:10:00] other side see and so when you talk
[2:10:03] about the kingdom and building us for a
[2:10:04] millenium Kingdom people there's certain
[2:10:06] things we preach to keep us in line and
[2:10:08] keep us protected here thank God for
[2:10:10] those things but if I only preach those
[2:10:12] things that means I'm just staying here
[2:10:14] I got a preach the faith to get us out
[2:10:17] of here
[2:10:18] glory be to his name we've got a priest
[2:10:21] rapturing say what's my heritage what's
[2:10:24] what's God building in my character to
[2:10:26] make me a millennium people ready for
[2:10:28] the millennium because it'll be a people
[2:10:30] of the millennium it'll be us that will
[2:10:32] be ruling and reigning and God's making
[2:10:34] a people of kings and priests right now
[2:10:36] to get us ready for the Millennium
[2:10:38] that's the stuff the bride's got to hear
[2:10:42] if we're not getting them ready to go to
[2:10:44] the other side of the rapture in faith
[2:10:45] and we're just that means we're just
[2:10:47] gonna stay here I don't want to stay
[2:10:48] here does anybody want to stay here well
[2:10:50] if we get all the dress right and all
[2:10:52] the things right it all perfectly and
[2:10:54] all the church are just perfect right
[2:10:56] well that's just staying for a year I'm
[2:11:00] not rebuke in church order but I'm just
[2:11:01] saying I'm not staying here for I don't
[2:11:04] want to stay here forever and just stay
[2:11:06] here I want a rapturing faith to take my
[2:11:09] inheritance because brother Brown says
[2:11:11] when the believers knows his position
[2:11:13] fully in Christ he'll take a rapture
[2:11:16] [Applause]
[2:11:17] and sisters Young says your position is
[2:11:21] Christ in Christ is more than just
[2:11:23] wearing a dress more than your hair it's
[2:11:26] much deeper than that this message is
[2:11:30] much deeper than hair and dress but it
[2:11:35] was part of it but if we emphasize you
[2:11:37] see now that we have to be careful of
[2:11:40] our emphasis is that okay amen so the
[2:11:50] transition has come and we're hearing
[2:11:53] things from the Lord now that call for
[2:11:56] his people to walk with the Lord under
[2:11:58] the Joshua Commission not under the
[2:12:00] Moses Commission but under the Joshua
[2:12:03] Commission to go to a convention and
[2:12:07] just play a tape at a convention of the
[2:12:10] Prophet it's fine it would be fine
[2:12:12] there's nothing wrong but that's not my
[2:12:14] full commission that's not the final
[2:12:18] result of what we're supposed to do
[2:12:20] that's not my part of the vision my part
[2:12:23] of the vision is the vision for the last
[2:12:24] days transitions from Moses Commission
[2:12:27] to the Joshua Commission and I'm part of
[2:12:29] that and that's the shadow now I'm
[2:12:31] living in the real of it can you say man
[2:12:33] so that that first quote if you if you
[2:12:35] guys did hear I'm gonna just bring
[2:12:36] another example up to you of this this
[2:12:38] transition are you still with me cuz the
[2:12:42] clock is still gone it's not it's not
[2:12:44] there
[2:12:45] amen so brother Graham says this in this
[2:12:48] first quote and it's the one brother
[2:12:49] from what is the traction on the
[2:12:51] mountain and he's referring to John the
[2:12:53] Baptist there's one standing among you
[2:12:55] whose shoes I am not worthy to bear John
[2:12:57] saying this about Jesus he will baptize
[2:13:00] you with the Holy Ghost and fire as i
[2:13:02] baptize with water one day an ordinary
[2:13:05] young man about 30 years old walked down
[2:13:07] and was baptized and when this man come
[2:13:09] there was such an attraction by the
[2:13:10] Prophet the Prophet act strange that day
[2:13:13] the congregation could help from
[2:13:14] watching the action of that prophet when
[2:13:16] he was debating with the priests across
[2:13:18] the river they said God built this altar
[2:13:20] God told us to do this Moses is the
[2:13:22] Prophet we believe Moses the sacrifice
[2:13:24] will never be done away with
[2:13:25] I can hear John answer back say have you
[2:13:27] not read the scripture what Daniel
[2:13:29] Prophet said the
[2:13:30] the sacrifice will be done away with and
[2:13:32] that hour has arrived have you not read
[2:13:34] that Isaiah said for the chapter the
[2:13:35] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[2:13:36] prepare the way of the Lord
[2:13:38] Johnson there's two prophecies for me
[2:13:40] and another thing did you not recognize
[2:13:42] our prophet 400 years ago Melek I when
[2:13:45] he spoke in the 3rd chapter and said
[2:13:46] behold I send my messenger before my
[2:13:50] face to prepare the way don't you know
[2:13:53] this fulfills prophecy so now catch it
[2:13:56] now John what is the attraction on the
[2:13:58] mountain scripts are being fulfilled
[2:14:00] so the attraction on the mountain then
[2:14:03] for John he is pointing to the
[2:14:05] scriptures four hundred years before
[2:14:06] that he is fulfilling I'm the voice of
[2:14:08] one crying in the wilderness all right
[2:14:10] so he refers to that but when jesus
[2:14:12] walks in that day there was a transition
[2:14:17] in about that time the prophet turned
[2:14:20] and said behold there comes the Lamb of
[2:14:23] God that takes away the sin of the world
[2:14:26] now what's the attraction it's changed
[2:14:30] from the Prophet to the prophecy
[2:14:35] [Music]
[2:14:37] [Applause]
[2:14:39] sit right there friends that's the
[2:14:42] transition right there and if we don't
[2:14:45] catch that we're gonna get lost in the
[2:14:47] wilderness somewhere we're gonna get
[2:14:48] lost in the past somewhere right there
[2:14:51] it changed from the Prophet to the
[2:14:55] prophecy because he came to introduce
[2:14:58] Christ right he came into here so a
[2:15:02] prophet came to introduce Christ the
[2:15:05] same as he needed it the Prophet was in
[2:15:07] today to introduce Christ once Christ is
[2:15:09] there working in his people then it
[2:15:12] moves the emphases the attraction the
[2:15:15] attraction changed from the Prophet to
[2:15:20] the prophecy
[2:15:23] it's a powerful quote friends it's a
[2:15:26] powerful thing to say that I don't think
[2:15:28] he believed Little John the Baptist at
[2:15:30] all by saying that she got to remember
[2:15:32] it's John who said later I must decrease
[2:15:36] he must increase I can no longer be the
[2:15:42] attraction now I fulfilled my commission
[2:15:44] I am no longer the attraction
[2:15:47] he's the attraction we're seeing the
[2:15:49] attraction today in the bride
[2:15:51] let me see Christ in the bride that's
[2:15:56] the attraction on the mountain his word
[2:15:58] being fulfilled in the bride it changed
[2:16:02] from the Prophet to his prophecy aren't
[2:16:04] you glad that we're living in the days
[2:16:06] not of the Prophet but the days of the
[2:16:09] prophecy you're living in those days you
[2:16:12] know this this bride we're walking in
[2:16:15] the vision a prophet let me just take a
[2:16:18] little time here not like I'm already
[2:16:20] doing that I'm already taking time but
[2:16:23] but a prophet is you know let me make
[2:16:26] this real simple for the children young
[2:16:28] people the Prophet is built special
[2:16:30] because he sees things by vision like
[2:16:33] Jesus did he says what I do nothing
[2:16:35] except my father shows me so he's he's
[2:16:38] speaking but when he speaks he's
[2:16:40] speaking by vision he sees he sees it
[2:16:42] and so when a prophet comes he can be
[2:16:44] specially built to see visions and so
[2:16:47] the particular thing that a prophet is
[2:16:49] sent for is
[2:16:50] speak the vision for that hour I think I
[2:16:52] said it Friday night when when Isaiah
[2:16:54] said a virgin shall conceive he spoke it
[2:16:56] he's seen that happening by vision spoke
[2:16:59] it by the vision then four hundred years
[2:17:02] later an angel Reese peeks it to Mary
[2:17:04] and then there was a manifestation
[2:17:06] so now thankfully here II speaks it to
[2:17:09] us in our generation but when God sends
[2:17:11] a prophet he's a man of vision so now he
[2:17:13] catches that vision so but but he speaks
[2:17:16] the vision but the people are to walk in
[2:17:19] the vision he spoke so I say you which
[2:17:23] is greater speaking it or walking every
[2:17:27] day in it from the Prophet to the
[2:17:30] prophecy which is greater to God to me
[2:17:33] to God to God it's greater when he sees
[2:17:36] his people walking in the vision greater
[2:17:39] than a prophet because the Prophet just
[2:17:41] speaks at all he has visions no I'd love
[2:17:43] to be around the Prophet him telling
[2:17:45] visions and heads business
[2:17:46] praise the Lord praise the Lord but
[2:17:48] what's better the vision walking in the
[2:17:52] vision so now is the beginning of the it
[2:17:56] was beginning of the the 20th century
[2:17:59] when television came on the scene in
[2:18:00] science and television was as the
[2:18:03] Prophet explained we bring it into a
[2:18:05] certain channel there's there's pictures
[2:18:07] there's things out there there's images
[2:18:08] but they develop this thing by science
[2:18:11] they can draw that in and bring it
[2:18:12] through a certain I don't know all the
[2:18:14] technical stuff but here you can see it
[2:18:16] now in a television television so that
[2:18:20] happens beginning of the 20th century
[2:18:22] that size came natural types of
[2:18:25] spiritual we received a prophet at the
[2:18:27] beginning of the 20th century can you
[2:18:29] say math so then he moves on in his
[2:18:32] ministry and he's going to be the
[2:18:33] Prophet to bring the people back so now
[2:18:35] what's happening naturally so what
[2:18:37] happens with televisions is that through
[2:18:39] the years there's an advancement in the
[2:18:41] picture of the television and the thing
[2:18:44] called pixels and pixels are little dots
[2:18:46] in the screen and as time has moved out
[2:18:49] science is advanced and there was only
[2:18:52] like 30 40 50 thousand pixels in a
[2:18:54] screen when they started now there's
[2:18:56] millions billions of pixels because the
[2:18:59] more little pixels you have the
[2:19:01] clear the picture is so now you go into
[2:19:07] these stores and you see these
[2:19:08] televisions and you're looking at this
[2:19:10] it's almost real I mean it looks so
[2:19:12] crystal clear they actually call it
[2:19:14] crystal because they've advanced the
[2:19:19] picture so much there's no doubt about
[2:19:21] what it it looks like you're there
[2:19:23] that's the bride coming to the place
[2:19:26] we're moving from the shadow to the real
[2:19:28] and so many little pixels until when God
[2:19:32] opened the seals to us you talk about a
[2:19:35] burst of pixels never before is history
[2:19:41] ever seen such a dumping of Revelation
[2:19:44] pixels to a people on the face of the
[2:19:46] earth and he speaks those things and it
[2:19:50] just starts the through for the last 50
[2:19:52] years the vision God's vision God's
[2:19:55] prophecy what God wants what he wants to
[2:19:58] achieve becomes crystal clear to the
[2:20:00] people of God it's right there in front
[2:20:03] of us the fivefold ministry is preaching
[2:20:05] it to us dead and I say I say here a
[2:20:08] little there a little a little dot here
[2:20:10] a little dot here little there little
[2:20:12] and it just keeps more dots morning like
[2:20:14] billions of dots in that picture now
[2:20:16] where are people that's blessed to have
[2:20:18] billions of pixels
[2:20:21] so we're not only seeing the vision
[2:20:23] we're walking in the vision I asked her
[2:20:28] the question again I asked you the
[2:20:29] question again which is greater a
[2:20:31] prophet speaking the vision or the
[2:20:34] people who afterwards walk in that
[2:20:36] vision you know you remember brother
[2:20:43] Bissell's testimony when he was out
[2:20:45] there the caribou and all that and he
[2:20:46] took that his wife put that green
[2:20:48] checkered shirt in the thing never even
[2:20:50] planned that but you know brother
[2:20:53] bisko's startling realization at the end
[2:20:55] of the day I didn't even realize it I
[2:20:59] was walking in that vision he puts that
[2:21:03] shirt on he walks out there because in
[2:21:04] the vision when he measured that with
[2:21:06] his hand and the Prophet looked over he
[2:21:08] had a green brother had had a green
[2:21:09] checkered shirt on how did all that
[2:21:11] happen he's walking in the vision and
[2:21:13] God did little things like that to show
[2:21:15] us the prophecy for this day it's not
[2:21:19] just about wearing a checkered shirt
[2:21:20] it's the word for this day is a vision
[2:21:24] and you are the ones walking in it right
[2:21:27] now
[2:21:31] moving from the Prophet to the prophecy
[2:21:35] is that okay with everybody I'm not
[2:21:38] losing any friends here today am i hey
[2:21:42] man I'm trying to gain friends in life
[2:21:43] not lose them I need more friends praise
[2:21:47] the Lord I got just a few you know
[2:21:49] brother Barry and that's questionable
[2:21:52] right there we're just like two totally
[2:21:57] different people I don't know how the
[2:21:58] Lord brought that friendship that we
[2:21:59] work together and we do retreats
[2:22:01] together in things but we're two
[2:22:02] opposites until he's totally different
[2:22:04] he's very different for that matter we
[2:22:09] have a I tell the young people we have a
[2:22:11] strange and wonderful relationship he's
[2:22:14] strange and I'm wonderful
[2:22:18] that's right so I have very little
[2:22:22] friends but I come to new feeling to
[2:22:23] gain some more I don't want to lose any
[2:22:25] praise the Lord so now now let's get to
[2:22:29] our text and try to finish this up here
[2:22:31] this morning we see then that one of the
[2:22:34] changes that I read to you so there's so
[2:22:37] many changes that took place under the
[2:22:39] Joshua Commission the people had grown
[2:22:42] to a place no more murmuring no more
[2:22:44] complaining did you realize that you
[2:22:48] don't find that in the book of Joshua no
[2:22:50] more days and no more Korah
[2:22:54] the gossiping had stopped they had
[2:22:56] matured okay it's time to move on
[2:22:59] get under Joshua here it's time to
[2:23:00] there's one focus to take our land when
[2:23:03] I got to sit around in our tents and
[2:23:05] just hash over things that's going on in
[2:23:06] the message no no there's a focus now
[2:23:09] you don't find it you don't find mermen
[2:23:12] complain you don't get see they find
[2:23:13] them seeking for a side Oh where's Moses
[2:23:16] and we just had Moses we can get out of
[2:23:18] this no no Josh was saying you got to
[2:23:19] get out of it you gotta fight your
[2:23:21] battles remember what I said one of the
[2:23:26] worst and maturities in the in the
[2:23:28] wilderness was too much dependence on
[2:23:30] Moses now you see a people and Joshua
[2:23:34] rise
[2:23:35] you got a leader you got the Holy Ghost
[2:23:37] Liam but you got two people and you
[2:23:39] never hear the complaining you never
[2:23:40] heard the murmuring everything's changed
[2:23:44] now there's one focus zeroed in on this
[2:23:48] day praise be think I want to be that
[2:23:51] way so all these changes we could preach
[2:23:57] about forever here it seems like but I'm
[2:23:59] just bringing out one in relation to our
[2:24:01] subject this weekend the manna ceased
[2:24:03] and they begin to eat the old corn and
[2:24:08] fruit of the promised land so the diet
[2:24:12] changed you know people that are
[2:24:14] maturing going from babyhood to
[2:24:17] adulthood your diet changes you go from
[2:24:20] milk to me so you can't take that meat
[2:24:24] though you can't move on with that
[2:24:26] unless you're matured yourself so you're
[2:24:29] you you eat mature food because you are
[2:24:32] becoming mature so you can go try to eat
[2:24:35] it and still bring them and remain a
[2:24:36] baby but you can't do that you're gonna
[2:24:39] choke yourself you're gonna be where's
[2:24:40] my milk at you want to be babied but if
[2:24:45] you're betray say god mature me God burn
[2:24:47] out all me maturities then you became
[2:24:49] ready for more of the meat of the word
[2:24:51] and when I say meat of the word I don't
[2:24:53] mean just doctrine of the word we're
[2:24:55] gonna find out in a minute
[2:24:55] that doesn't mean heavy deep doctrine I
[2:24:58] think the meat of the word is something
[2:25:00] much deeper even than that
[2:25:02] so now the diet change so does that
[2:25:06] apply to us spiritually yes it does for
[2:25:08] sure because we are in transition as
[2:25:10] revelations 10 as the book of redemption
[2:25:13] that was sealed is open to us for the
[2:25:15] first time it's crystal clear that it
[2:25:17] opens
[2:25:18] while the seventh angels on earth he
[2:25:20] opens it while the seven angels on earth
[2:25:22] Amen after that he says John was told to
[2:25:26] eat the book this is our diet so it
[2:25:30] changed though from what we ain't in the
[2:25:32] church ages now we have a book of
[2:25:35] redemption that we're feeding on John
[2:25:36] says taken and eat it so we're gonna be
[2:25:38] the different diet you know we're eating
[2:25:40] from the book of redemption being open
[2:25:43] to us so we become about Redemption we
[2:25:46] don't become about temporal things if I
[2:25:49] didn't just see another sign that I'll
[2:25:51] make it through the day if I can just
[2:25:53] see God do another supernatural act then
[2:25:55] I'll keep being a Christian if I can
[2:25:56] just see that's all Church ages God
[2:25:59] performing his thing but but it's not
[2:26:01] about finishing Redemption when we start
[2:26:03] to feed on the book of retention first
[2:26:05] of all we see our name in the book of
[2:26:06] redemption my positions in there I'm a
[2:26:09] part of this I'm a part of the vision I
[2:26:11] see my name in the book
[2:26:13] John seen his name in the book should it
[2:26:15] was an open he said he must have seen
[2:26:17] his name in there he began to shout and
[2:26:19] everybody heard him shouting so first of
[2:26:22] all you see your position and name in
[2:26:24] there but because it's a book of
[2:26:25] redemption it's like I preached last
[2:26:27] night you become a part of like Esther a
[2:26:29] part of Redemption
[2:26:32] that your focus is a much on focus not
[2:26:35] on temporal things and and what's going
[2:26:38] on in the message and all this happen
[2:26:40] and all the sin and all the stuff you
[2:26:41] move your focus now is that how can I be
[2:26:44] used to finish Redemption where's the
[2:26:48] last elected seed what does God want to
[2:26:53] do how does the redeemed son of God act
[2:26:55] a mature redeemed son of God
[2:26:58] what's this character I want to know I
[2:27:01] want to know where I stand I want to
[2:27:03] stand there now that this book is open
[2:27:06] I'm feeding on something that brings me
[2:27:08] to a maturity that I'm not getting all
[2:27:11] depressed about temporal things I'm not
[2:27:18] like the children in the wilderness that
[2:27:19] are just caught brother Brad explains it
[2:27:21] here and we just moved down I've got to
[2:27:24] move down this down this these notes
[2:27:29] said the manna ceased that's pretty
[2:27:32] significant that was 40 years of that
[2:27:36] manna every day being provided and it
[2:27:38] said that manna seized and they begin to
[2:27:41] eat the old corn of the lame the fruit
[2:27:45] of the land this is the man of the God
[2:27:47] supernaturally provided in exodus 16
[2:27:50] early in their journey every morning to
[2:27:52] do was up and there was fresh manna on
[2:27:53] the ground it lasted for 40 years every
[2:27:55] day when God's people are hungry he will
[2:27:57] provide fruit for them but now something
[2:28:00] that there was every morning for 40
[2:28:02] years stopped it seized Wow
[2:28:03] to these new ones under Joshua
[2:28:05] Commission the manna ceased and we don't
[2:28:07] hear one bit of complaining that they
[2:28:10] were so dependent on the manna for 40
[2:28:12] years and now one morning it stops and
[2:28:14] there's not one word from the children
[2:28:16] of Israel to say Oh what are we gonna do
[2:28:18] we've been used to this for 40 years
[2:28:21] it's not one word of that God's given us
[2:28:25] another food never asked about the manna
[2:28:29] that's maturity
[2:28:31] Oh blessed be his name they would have a
[2:28:36] different food can you say mad so you
[2:28:39] should understand that the change in
[2:28:41] spiritual diet happens in a believers
[2:28:43] life in this hour if you turn with me to
[2:28:45] the scripture but the Gerald read after
[2:28:47] Friday night it's us such a supernatural
[2:28:50] move of God this weekend for him to read
[2:28:53] that scripture Hebrews chapter 5 but I
[2:28:55] got to refer to it again now under my
[2:28:57] subject today you see those little
[2:29:00] things that happen pastor gets up and
[2:29:03] reads that scripture and that's the
[2:29:05] scripture I was gonna read and just in
[2:29:07] he's just trying to say something to us
[2:29:09] we don't realize we're so earthbound
[2:29:12] sometimes we're not conscious of what
[2:29:13] the Lord is doing can you say Amen
[2:29:16] I I'll give you a little testimony last
[2:29:20] Sunday I was talking about brother Bram
[2:29:22] saying driving the nail down he says if
[2:29:23] you don't drive the nail down in 47 he
[2:29:26] was he was talking about 4890 48 he says
[2:29:29] I go into a Sunday meeting and then the
[2:29:31] devil gets on people the whole week oh
[2:29:32] if we come back just Sunday the devil
[2:29:34] knocks out what I've done the faith
[2:29:36] isn't theirs we have to start again so
[2:29:38] it's cheap preaching to my people about
[2:29:39] we have to stay in the word and that we
[2:29:42] have to let the Lord clinch that nail
[2:29:44] and brother Graham wanted to have
[2:29:47] meetings every night so you clinched
[2:29:48] that faith they don't really drive it
[2:29:49] down so the devil couldn't move it so I
[2:29:51] brought a nail up to my pulpit and I was
[2:29:53] gonna nail that in and give a visual to
[2:29:55] explain it to the people and they were I
[2:29:58] said if you're worried about me putting
[2:29:59] a nail in the pulpit I said what's my
[2:30:01] pulpit I can do it so I put a little
[2:30:04] aluminum nail on there I should have got
[2:30:06] a real one but I grabbed something for
[2:30:07] that the house and I grabbed a rubber
[2:30:09] hammer because I thought that would be a
[2:30:11] good type to cuz I want to be a good
[2:30:13] pastor that even though it's a hammer
[2:30:15] driving down the word I want to do it as
[2:30:18] politely as I can
[2:30:21] so I thought that would be a good point
[2:30:23] you know and they liked that there's a
[2:30:25] little praise the Lord I got a pastor
[2:30:26] his sensitivity he's not just trying to
[2:30:28] beat us up all the time but he's
[2:30:30] hammering it down the word but he's
[2:30:31] using a rubber hammer well it did work
[2:30:32] out so well because when I begin to
[2:30:36] pound that aluminum nail with a rubber
[2:30:38] hammer it just wasn't working so my
[2:30:41] brother-in-law who's a remodeler he went
[2:30:43] and got a real hammer and he hands it up
[2:30:48] to me while I'm doing this helping me
[2:30:51] out because I you know I needed help
[2:30:53] deliverance out of this visual it was
[2:30:55] gonna fall apart you can see it's unfit
[2:30:58] it's on the archive and so he walks up
[2:31:00] with the real hammer and he he hands
[2:31:02] that thing to me he says listen preach
[2:31:04] the word
[2:31:08] don't hold anything back just take this
[2:31:10] hammer and and nail it down now that I
[2:31:14] didn't pre plan that but when I got home
[2:31:18] I just realized that you know what the
[2:31:21] Lord's doing something here some things
[2:31:24] you don't plan and I took that hammer
[2:31:27] and beat that thing put it right through
[2:31:29] the pole back and then I had just an
[2:31:33] eruption from the audience it seemed
[2:31:35] like they said yeah we get the point we
[2:31:37] get the boy yeah you got to nail it down
[2:31:39] keep preaching it keep nailing it down
[2:31:41] to anchors can you say man praise the
[2:31:45] Lord we're gonna leave that nail right
[2:31:46] in there as an example to show down
[2:31:48] through the years that that's what we're
[2:31:50] up here to do we don't want it because
[2:31:52] brother Bram says you know if you just
[2:31:54] tap that in then the devil can come and
[2:31:56] knock it off you know as you just tap it
[2:32:00] in he also said the children could get
[2:32:01] hurt by it and I said to the people I
[2:32:04] says if people don't get anchored in the
[2:32:06] Holy Ghost as parents their children
[2:32:07] will suffer for it we need to be
[2:32:11] anchored we need to be mature Christians
[2:32:14] we need to know where we stand it's just
[2:32:18] those supernatural things and so he read
[2:32:20] this Friday night Hebrews 5 and verse 12
[2:32:23] and he said he's reading it here and he
[2:32:25] said of whom we have many things to say
[2:32:28] and hard to be uttered seeing here dull
[2:32:29] of hearing for when the time he ought to
[2:32:31] be teachers ye have need that one teach
[2:32:33] you again which be the first principles
[2:32:35] of the Oracles of God our become such as
[2:32:38] one and have need of milk and not strong
[2:32:40] meat so he's talking about babies
[2:32:41] spiritually and there's security blanket
[2:32:44] like lioness and it's a security blanket
[2:32:46] they reach and back into no no I don't
[2:32:49] want to hear that I want to hear the
[2:32:51] things that I first heard because that's
[2:32:52] a comfort blanket to me and you're just
[2:32:55] babies you want to stay babies I just
[2:32:59] want I feel comfortable just hearing the
[2:33:01] stories that the Prophet told and says
[2:33:03] it and it's wonderful to hear it but if
[2:33:05] we're not moving on in our inheritance
[2:33:07] then we're using that for a comfort
[2:33:10] blanket I say that respectfully for
[2:33:15] every one that uses milk is unskillful
[2:33:17] in the word of righteousness for he is a
[2:33:19] babe but
[2:33:20] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[2:33:22] of full age did you notice now the diet
[2:33:24] for strong meat belongs to the one who
[2:33:27] are growing up in maturity so you have
[2:33:31] to mature in order to meet the diet God
[2:33:33] wants to give you and you can handle it
[2:33:35] that's why we pray God matura God take
[2:33:38] all very maturities out but strong meat
[2:33:40] belonging to them that are full eats
[2:33:41] even those who by reason of use have
[2:33:43] their senses exercised to discern both
[2:33:48] good and evil now friends I believe
[2:33:49] that's given a trait of true maturity
[2:33:52] then we're not babies anymore we're not
[2:33:55] falling to just anything every doctrine
[2:33:57] anymore
[2:33:58] but we've become there our senses have
[2:34:01] been exercised by the Word of God by the
[2:34:03] Holy Spirit that we can detect the enemy
[2:34:05] at every one of his tricks can you say
[2:34:09] mad and and and and using discernment in
[2:34:13] every situation you know an example is
[2:34:16] if something comes in your dog you see
[2:34:18] the devil setting a trap for you you
[2:34:20] have a strong people of God that's
[2:34:21] raising to the place today in in
[2:34:23] maturity that they're not falling over
[2:34:26] and over again to temptations because
[2:34:28] they recognize the devil ahead of time
[2:34:31] and you go down a certain Street and you
[2:34:34] fell in a hole in that Street then the
[2:34:36] next day you take the same way to work
[2:34:38] and fall on that hole again you take the
[2:34:40] same way to work and you fall in that
[2:34:42] hole again you're not using discernment
[2:34:44] so discernment says I got to quit going
[2:34:49] down that Street and go another Street
[2:34:51] and the devil won't meet me fall so you
[2:34:55] deserve it in your own life to say now
[2:34:57] I'm not going to fall to this all the
[2:34:59] time if I do I God forgive me I don't
[2:35:01] mean to fall but I want to keep falling
[2:35:02] over and over again so I used my
[2:35:04] discernment to pick up on the devil
[2:35:06] overcoming is recognizing the devil
[2:35:08] every one of his tricks
[2:35:10] we're not ignorant of his devices oh boy
[2:35:15] we got a lot of devices whether Gerald
[2:35:17] was saying that got a lot of devices
[2:35:18] today Satan's devices so we have them we
[2:35:22] can't we can't we have to live with them
[2:35:24] but we're not ignorant of how Satan can
[2:35:26] use them the rest of the world's
[2:35:29] ignorant the rest of the world's
[2:35:31] ignorant they're not mature they're
[2:35:32] they're like babies are the newest movie
[2:35:35] that comes out the newest thing they
[2:35:36] just fall for it whatever okay okay
[2:35:38] let's do it they get on there click on
[2:35:40] anything in their net we can't live that
[2:35:42] way we know what this tree of knowledge
[2:35:45] is where people who know what this stuff
[2:35:48] is we know the devil behind it so we
[2:35:50] have to use our discernment for our own
[2:35:52] lives but let me say it this way we also
[2:35:54] must use discernment with the sword of
[2:35:56] the word and how we use it on other
[2:35:59] people because if we don't have divine
[2:36:02] love as our motivator we can take this
[2:36:05] sword and slice people up big time the
[2:36:10] people of the message can be more
[2:36:11] judgmental people and critical people
[2:36:14] than any denomination I've ever seen now
[2:36:18] why is that because we have so much of
[2:36:20] the word so much of the correction of
[2:36:22] the word we know how Christians supposed
[2:36:24] to live but you have to be careful that
[2:36:26] you don't not use discernment and how
[2:36:29] you apply it you know I was talking
[2:36:31] about my dad the other night he came to
[2:36:33] the Lord so on fire came to a Baptist
[2:36:35] Church gave his heart to the Lord then
[2:36:37] he came to a Pentecostal church then the
[2:36:39] Lord opened the message told me he's
[2:36:40] following the message of the last day so
[2:36:42] I told you that but boy he got on such
[2:36:43] fire that when he went in the service
[2:36:45] down to North Carolina he thought his
[2:36:47] dad bomb everybody was going to come
[2:36:49] just like that and just resent so he
[2:36:50] wrote a letter to his dad's and dad dad
[2:36:52] I'm excited you're gonna have to quit
[2:36:55] your smoking you're gonna have to quit
[2:36:56] your drinking you're gonna have to quit
[2:36:57] going to bars he listed all stuff you do
[2:37:00] and dig and get filled with the Holy
[2:37:01] Ghost god bless you sign butch
[2:37:07] just a zeal to see his dad be saved no
[2:37:11] discernment whatsoever
[2:37:14] it's like Paul said about Israel a zeal
[2:37:18] but not according to knowledge no
[2:37:21] discernment so is he saying the words
[2:37:24] he's saying well yeah but no desert no
[2:37:26] love no no manner image to bring it so
[2:37:29] dad got a letter back a few weeks ago he
[2:37:32] says his dad never wrote him but this
[2:37:33] time you wrote him back and Butch don't
[2:37:37] bother to come home keep your religion
[2:37:43] to yourself don't tell me what to do
[2:37:45] sign dad and so then it took years to
[2:37:51] repair what he had done for even us kids
[2:37:54] to be around grandpa
[2:37:56] but then he repaired it he apologized
[2:37:57] and then you know it's funny where
[2:38:00] grandpa's going on now grandma but my
[2:38:02] dad's with his sibling sometimes and
[2:38:04] they still haven't accepted the Lord
[2:38:05] there's one going to church but they
[2:38:06] haven't really accepted the Lord and dad
[2:38:08] was with this is this is wasn't planned
[2:38:10] this morning but dad was with his
[2:38:12] brother who has a lot of heart issues
[2:38:15] and he was with them last week he's
[2:38:16] visiting from Florida and he went to a
[2:38:18] motel to see him there and dad said let
[2:38:20] me pray for you so this dad's family now
[2:38:22] rejected all that we believed all these
[2:38:24] are rejecting the message we're called
[2:38:26] were strangers you know but over the
[2:38:28] years because dad's developed a respect
[2:38:31] now they're asking questions you see
[2:38:35] there's a discernment there's a maturity
[2:38:39] that people can pick up on to trust I
[2:38:43] think early years in this message I
[2:38:45] think there wasn't enough maturity to
[2:38:47] present this message the right
[2:38:50] and that's what I've been preaching this
[2:38:52] weekend friends we've got to mature
[2:38:53] because we've got a great thing here we
[2:38:56] have got a great thing but if we're not
[2:38:59] mature we'll destroy people with it
[2:39:02] my dad said let me pray for you in the
[2:39:05] motel my sister was there and he wept my
[2:39:08] Uncle Jim he wept drinker smoker just
[2:39:11] terrible life just this really but he
[2:39:14] just wept as my dad prayed just left you
[2:39:17] see over time and see we have to be
[2:39:19] careful that we don't use this sword
[2:39:22] with the wrong spirit to slice people up
[2:39:26] with it we got to have divine love
[2:39:29] now divine love is not compromising but
[2:39:33] it's administering it in such a way it's
[2:39:36] not harsh it's not belittling it's not
[2:39:38] trying to take away from the person but
[2:39:41] it's just bringing that divine love with
[2:39:44] the Word of God and that becomes
[2:39:46] attractive to people my observance all
[2:39:50] these years and the message by they're
[2:39:51] just too much of that that went on too
[2:39:53] much beatin people over the head trying
[2:39:55] to beat people into a rapture you don't
[2:39:57] beat this bride into a rapture you love
[2:39:59] them into a rapture God's gonna love his
[2:40:02] bride into her rapturing thing she's
[2:40:04] gonna so crave him more and more that
[2:40:07] she wants to be in church she wants to
[2:40:09] be in the world she wants to serve the
[2:40:11] Lord she wants to wear a dress
[2:40:14] the sisters any way she wants to it's
[2:40:19] not that she has to she wants to because
[2:40:22] of love I've fallen in love with him
[2:40:26] you understand these things and so
[2:40:29] brother branham explains this as I try
[2:40:32] to close on this quote if I can I have a
[2:40:34] lot of stuff here a lot of hay in the
[2:40:36] barn don't want to preach the whole barn
[2:40:39] of hay this morning I will get a drink
[2:40:48] has this been helpful to you this
[2:40:51] morning
[2:40:52] praise the Lord that's what we want to
[2:40:54] be a help so now he says what we didn't
[2:40:57] finish the scripture he said strong meat
[2:40:59] discerning both good and evil
[2:41:02] so it's the desert it's matured
[2:41:04] discernment with the word that we need
[2:41:07] chapter six therefore leaving the
[2:41:09] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[2:41:12] us go on to perfection not laying again
[2:41:14] the foundation of repentance from dead
[2:41:15] works and of faith toward God of the
[2:41:17] doctrines of Baptism laying on hands and
[2:41:19] resurrection of the Dead and eternal
[2:41:21] judgment and this will we do if God
[2:41:24] permit so it just stops right there so
[2:41:26] leaving the principles those we still do
[2:41:28] those things but what's the emphasis you
[2:41:30] see if we only emphasize the laying of
[2:41:33] the hands if we only emphasize healings
[2:41:35] and miracles if we only emphasize the
[2:41:38] days of the Prophet we're gonna drop and
[2:41:41] die we have to personally move on with
[2:41:46] our inheritance with the law
[2:41:48] so when this man and corn thing this is
[2:41:51] the way brother branham explains it if
[2:41:52] he got that quote he's talking to the
[2:41:54] spiritual Canaanites Israel the
[2:41:56] spiritual Israel who has possessed a
[2:41:58] land
[2:41:59] Oh aren't you glad you've come out of
[2:42:01] Egypt garlic aren't you glad you're out
[2:42:03] of the wilderness and remember they had
[2:42:05] to eat man and angels food out of heaven
[2:42:07] until they crossed over into the land
[2:42:08] and when they crossed over into the land
[2:42:10] the manna ceased to fall they were fully
[2:42:13] matured in and they eat the old corn of
[2:42:15] the land now now that you're not babies
[2:42:18] anymore now that you're not desiring the
[2:42:21] sincere milk of the gospel that you
[2:42:23] don't have to be babied and patted and
[2:42:26] persuaded to come to church did you
[2:42:29] notice the one of the marks of babyhood
[2:42:31] there you have to be persuaded to do
[2:42:33] things
[2:42:34] I wasn't that group under Joshua they
[2:42:39] were all in there ready what's next
[2:42:43] where's the next city to conquer you
[2:42:46] come to church like that you inspire a
[2:42:48] pastor got that what's next let's go
[2:42:53] forward
[2:42:54] hey man that's the way our maturity
[2:42:58] should be so they're not little babies
[2:43:00] anymore baby pat it you know we peek so
[2:43:03] many people unless it's got to be babied
[2:43:04] and patted and persuaded and you know
[2:43:07] Paul said without use enticing words of
[2:43:09] man's wisdom to entice somebody to do
[2:43:11] something we ministers don't have to use
[2:43:13] every type of thing to try to entice
[2:43:15] people just preach the word preaching to
[2:43:19] mature people they're gonna take the
[2:43:20] word amen
[2:43:22] but you know you don't you don't want to
[2:43:25] just keep babying fat little babies in
[2:43:28] the message that just want to be you
[2:43:31] know I have had this I've had people
[2:43:33] leave my church years ago man left my
[2:43:35] church cuz I didn't quote brother
[2:43:36] branham enough I know you'd think about
[2:43:40] that one I didn't have I didn't say
[2:43:44] enough quotes for his satisfaction so
[2:43:50] then then I've had people leave the
[2:43:51] church because I quoted him too much
[2:43:59] you know and passengers don't know what
[2:44:01] to do sometimes do you know what it's
[2:44:04] just immaturity
[2:44:05] it's just babies they want to hear what
[2:44:07] they want to hear they don't want to
[2:44:09] hear nothing else they don't want to be
[2:44:10] corrected they don't you know they want
[2:44:12] their little bottle and come to church
[2:44:14] treat me right treat me just right don't
[2:44:16] preach against my sin don't preach
[2:44:18] against my and when I say sin today I
[2:44:20] don't mean smoking drinking but
[2:44:22] preaching against their their complexes
[2:44:24] or preaching against their their
[2:44:26] attitudes or their anger that's out of
[2:44:28] control or their treatment of other
[2:44:30] Christians don't you say nothing about
[2:44:33] that just give me what I want to hear
[2:44:37] babies big babies who bring their bottle
[2:44:40] to church we're not here to preach the
[2:44:46] babies feelings he touched me my
[2:44:57] daughter used to say he touched me now
[2:45:02] kids can be sometimes you know when
[2:45:05] they're all irritable you know and their
[2:45:07] brother or sister just rubs again
[2:45:10] he touched me you know and isn't fusses
[2:45:14] in the backseat of the car and and you
[2:45:16] wish hat you wish he had that police
[2:45:18] thing that had the window from the front
[2:45:21] to the back soundproof would that be
[2:45:24] great you just can't hear any of it just
[2:45:26] can't just let him go on do we get there
[2:45:29] or if you don't have it with my dad if
[2:45:33] you didn't have that screen there if you
[2:45:35] weren't careful you'd feel a hand go
[2:45:39] slap every one of us yeah that's right
[2:45:43] so you just move back like this because
[2:45:48] you're going to get it here this
[2:45:57] babyhood in the church sometimes people
[2:45:59] they're supposed to be grown up their
[2:46:02] feelings are on their shoulders don't
[2:46:06] you dare offend me preacher don't you
[2:46:07] offend me somebody don't offend me and
[2:46:10] they're just they're just shallow the
[2:46:12] babies can't take too much used to be a
[2:46:17] song that says I know a man maybe you
[2:46:20] know him too he never can tell he might
[2:46:24] even be you he knelt at the altar and
[2:46:26] that was the end he's saved and that's
[2:46:28] all that matters to him his spiritual
[2:46:31] tummy it can't take too much one day a
[2:46:34] week he gets a spiritual lunch on Sunday
[2:46:37] he puts on his spiritual best but he
[2:46:39] gives his language a spiritual rest he's
[2:46:44] just a fat he's just a fat little baby
[2:46:48] he wants his bottle and he don't mean
[2:46:50] maybe he sampled solid food for once or
[2:46:54] twice but his doctrine leaves him cold
[2:46:56] as I and it goes on and on and on it's a
[2:47:01] song it says a fat little spiritual baby
[2:47:04] living on his emotions there is offended
[2:47:07] here and there you know drop of the Hat
[2:47:10] crying about things I'll tell you
[2:47:11] friends we need strong mature believers
[2:47:17] grown up in the word they're not living
[2:47:20] by their feelings their living by the
[2:47:23] word their living by that's what's next
[2:47:25] in the Word of God not little babies
[2:47:29] have to be persuaded to come to church
[2:47:31] and Pat it oh it's okay brother and make
[2:47:34] them a deacon to make them feel better
[2:47:42] brother Brant talks about that you know
[2:47:47] do something give them a position in the
[2:47:49] church and let them sing a special or
[2:47:51] something to make sure their feelings
[2:47:52] aren't hurt or something like that they
[2:47:54] shouldn't have their feelings hurt
[2:47:55] you know people that serve in positions
[2:47:58] places should never hang so tightly onto
[2:48:01] that position that they can never step
[2:48:03] aside to let somebody else do it
[2:48:06] that's humility I've put people in my
[2:48:10] positions in my church sometimes and
[2:48:12] they got in there and they're holding on
[2:48:13] for dear life you know and then God
[2:48:15] feels the the gods leaving the church in
[2:48:17] a different way and Holy Ghost in a
[2:48:18] different direction boy they're gonna
[2:48:19] hold on to that for dear life and it's a
[2:48:21] terrible thing because then you realize
[2:48:22] the persons in there
[2:48:24] not to serve the Lord but they're in
[2:48:25] there because they they like the
[2:48:27] position they're like to be seen that
[2:48:30] can be talked about we got to grow out
[2:48:32] all those mature in the trees you've
[2:48:35] seen too much of this and the message
[2:48:36] Friends you me like David and say I'd
[2:48:41] rather be he's the King I'd rather be a
[2:48:43] doorkeeper in the house of God just so I
[2:48:46] can be in the house of God I don't need
[2:48:50] to be king I don't need to be a priest I
[2:48:51] don't need to be the preacher I don't
[2:48:52] need to sing a special if I can just be
[2:48:55] there and I open the door I'll greet the
[2:48:57] people I'll do whatever little thing
[2:48:59] because it's not about what position we
[2:49:01] hold it's about being in the glory of
[2:49:03] the Lord that's maturity so he says
[2:49:11] you're not baby padded and persuaded to
[2:49:14] come to church now that you feel you
[2:49:15] wholly mature Christians you're ready to
[2:49:17] eat strong means now you're ready to
[2:49:18] come into something you say you're ready
[2:49:20] to understand something that's deep and
[2:49:21] rich Oh we'll get into it directly oh
[2:49:23] it's been hidden since the foundation of
[2:49:25] the world now that you come to this I'm
[2:49:27] addressing this to you not to those
[2:49:29] who've just left Egypt not to those who
[2:49:31] are still in the journey but to those
[2:49:33] who are in the promised land that has
[2:49:35] received a promise how many's received
[2:49:37] the promise of the Holy Ghost aren't you
[2:49:39] glad you're in the land or eating the
[2:49:41] old corn eating the strong things of God
[2:49:43] get a clear understanding your spirits
[2:49:45] will not mine is all unmodeled up
[2:49:48] there's another sign of wisdom
[2:49:51] excuse me of maturity your minds not all
[2:49:54] muddled up there's a clarity in your
[2:49:56] mind sound mind you know exactly who he
[2:49:59] is you know exactly what he is you know
[2:50:02] exactly where you're going you know
[2:50:04] exactly all about it you know and whom
[2:50:06] you have believed and persuaded he's
[2:50:08] able to keep that which you've committed
[2:50:11] to him against that
[2:50:13] that's maturity friends that's
[2:50:16] discernment praise be to God
[2:50:18] just wonderful I believe God wants to
[2:50:22] hear from people mature confession like
[2:50:27] you heard I said to Caleb last night
[2:50:29] we're more than able that makes God's
[2:50:31] attention perk up that he can do
[2:50:34] something and we have to have
[2:50:35] confessions not of murmuring and
[2:50:38] complaining and can Moses come and do us
[2:50:41] another period can Moses come back and
[2:50:43] do us another miracle to pull us out of
[2:50:45] this can all this immaturity but but
[2:50:48] it's it's something that were
[2:50:50] proclaiming with a strong faith people
[2:51:01] that would say maybe in Joshua's day
[2:51:03] they'd say to Joshua Joshua not
[2:51:06] murmuring complaining I want to let you
[2:51:09] know Joshua Egypt is dead to me I will
[2:51:14] never go back to the wilderness I'm
[2:51:18] all-in I've crossed Jordan I've reached
[2:51:22] the point of no return
[2:51:24] I believe this thing with everything
[2:51:27] inside me pastor I don't need to I don't
[2:51:30] need God to show himself that he's great
[2:51:32] to stay in the message he's already
[2:51:35] showed me he's great
[2:51:36] I need him now to help me while I Drive
[2:51:40] these enemies out of the land and get my
[2:51:43] inheritance Joshua I'm not needing the
[2:51:45] mana I've got the old corn and I can
[2:51:49] pick up this corn and fruit of this land
[2:51:51] and eat that and be totally satisfied
[2:51:53] I'm not going back I'm not murmuring
[2:51:55] complaining I need to go get my
[2:51:57] inheritance and so whatever God shows
[2:51:59] you to tell me I want to know the next
[2:52:02] thing so I can move on with the Lord
[2:52:04] those are mature comments too in the
[2:52:09] Joshua Commission I mean I don't need to
[2:52:12] join a group that's trying to get Moses
[2:52:13] to come back I need to stay away from
[2:52:17] groups they're trying to raise him from
[2:52:19] the dead and have him a tent and have
[2:52:21] him a white horse
[2:52:23] all this fanaticism they'll come down
[2:52:25] and it's bound to be you know why it
[2:52:27] happens because we had such a
[2:52:29] significant spiritual happening in this
[2:52:32] generation whenever you have that you're
[2:52:34] gonna have a lot of fanaticism that goes
[2:52:35] with it and I'm not interested in
[2:52:38] fanaticism I'm interested why God sent a
[2:52:41] prophet see and so I'm not going to join
[2:52:44] the groups that are you know trying to
[2:52:47] bring him back join the groups that did
[2:52:48] glorifying what he did you know brother
[2:52:50] brems gonna come up and speak for us
[2:52:52] tonight it's a it's a tad of
[2:52:54] spiritualism when you act like a man is
[2:52:57] still alive and he's dead
[2:52:59] it's borderline spiritualism young
[2:53:02] people the young people the the prophet
[2:53:05] of God brother Branham will be speaking
[2:53:06] for us tonight it's it's eerie
[2:53:11] it's eerie but just just leave that with
[2:53:14] them because God has sent us a wonderful
[2:53:18] message through William Branham God sent
[2:53:23] us a wonderful message through William
[2:53:25] Branham and I can take what he said I
[2:53:27] can thank God for what he did through it
[2:53:29] but his commission is over and I can
[2:53:31] take what he's getting feed on it I feed
[2:53:33] on this message more than anything else
[2:53:34] this message is open this Bible to me I
[2:53:37] can feed on it and I say Lord what's
[2:53:40] next in my life can you say man and
[2:53:45] don't let me to stay with the manna let
[2:53:48] me eat the old corn the mature corner of
[2:53:50] the land let me eat that kind of food
[2:53:52] amen
[2:53:53] can we stand together god bless you amen
[2:53:56] let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[2:53:58] praise god is good all the time can we

[3:00:34] hey man thank God the Bible says out of
[3:00:37] the mouth of two or three witnesses let
[3:00:39] it be established hey man so it's it's
[3:00:42] our brothers we thank the Lord for our
[3:00:44] brothers ministry we thank the Lord for
[3:00:46] the word that's been ministered and it's
[3:00:49] the confirmation of maybe a number of
[3:00:51] things that you have heard me Minister
[3:00:52] for a number of years a man that's the
[3:00:56] truth I believe what he said you know
[3:00:58] and that was tremendous scripture there
[3:01:01] this morning concerning them my servant
[3:01:03] Moses is dead a man and no doubt there
[3:01:07] were those that were still wanted Moses
[3:01:08] and they still put the emphasis on Moses
[3:01:12] a man's the same thing today my servant
[3:01:14] brother Branham is dead physically amen
[3:01:17] we know they're spiritually he's in that
[3:01:18] dimension that the Lord has showed him
[3:01:21] before he took him a man but the
[3:01:24] emphasis is not on him now mother now
[3:01:26] we're going from the messenger to the
[3:01:28] message and I oh that's good praise the
[3:01:31] Lord for for confirming it for
[3:01:33] confirming those things so you've heard
[3:01:35] not just me you but now you've heard our
[3:01:38] brother come with with with the thoughts
[3:01:40] God laid on his heart I believe it was
[3:01:42] the Lord oh yes most definitely in the
[3:01:44] Lord and there's not only a witness to
[3:01:46] the Saints right here but a witness are
[3:01:49] those online or in DVD land and brother
[3:01:52] it could be around the world so the
[3:01:54] group we thank the Lord God I believe it
[3:01:56] was the will of God for our brother to
[3:01:58] come it was the will of God for our
[3:02:00] brother to minister what he ministered
[3:02:02] amen so god help us brother that we're
[3:02:05] going to recognize the message a man and
[3:02:08] I can go back for a number of years
[3:02:10] having having been around the message
[3:02:13] world maybe over 50 years and I can
[3:02:16] confirm what our brother is said a man
[3:02:19] most definitely because I can go back to
[3:02:21] well when I came to the message in 1965
[3:02:25] our brother wasn't born to 66 and it's
[3:02:30] amazing but I was I was getting better
[3:02:32] getting closer to the message and I'm
[3:02:34] late late 65 but it was in 1966 that
[3:02:38] that I that I was I was given a witness
[3:02:40] that God had sent a prophet a man and
[3:02:43] brother and I and I have I have
[3:02:46] I can bear witness on what it was like
[3:02:49] then and what it's like now a man and
[3:02:52] how that it has changed over 50 years a
[3:02:55] man and he ended what our brother
[3:02:57] preached was truth that the emphasis was
[3:02:59] on the messenger and is the truth when I
[3:03:02] first come to this message they were
[3:03:04] preaching God has sent a prophet goddess
[3:03:06] and a prophet God has sent a prophet but
[3:03:09] brother now the emphasis is on the
[3:03:10] message and brother it was and again I
[3:03:14] believe the prophet knew that this was
[3:03:16] coming
[3:03:16] this change was coming because there was
[3:03:19] somebody that asked the prophet of God
[3:03:21] in in the late 1950s
[3:03:23] somebody said brother Bentham what do
[3:03:24] you see ahead for the church and he said
[3:03:27] what do I see
[3:03:28] and he said well he said I see nothing
[3:03:30] but total darkness after 1977 a mayor
[3:03:35] that's the truth
[3:03:37] somewhere that God was going to draw a
[3:03:39] line and after 1977 it was total
[3:03:42] darkness and I can bear witness that it
[3:03:44] was in the early 1970s that we began to
[3:03:47] move from God a center prophet to the
[3:03:50] message amen
[3:03:52] that is that is the absolute truth
[3:03:53] brother because I remember from there 66
[3:03:56] and underground through the 1970s 72 at
[3:04:00] least 72 that it was all God's and a
[3:04:02] prophet everybody we were in went on the
[3:04:04] world preaching God has sent a prophet
[3:04:06] we went from one town to another one
[3:04:09] church to another God has sent a prophet
[3:04:11] a man but then all of a sudden it
[3:04:14] changed yes he sent a prophet but why
[3:04:17] did he send the prophet a man so let's
[3:04:20] get let's get into the message and we
[3:04:22] had me begin the move from putting the
[3:04:24] emphasis on the Prophet to these message
[3:04:26] a man but again there was an older
[3:04:29] generation and I mention that just
[3:04:31] recently the older generation they kept
[3:04:34] on preaching goddess and a prophet a man
[3:04:37] and they didn't understand the things
[3:04:39] that we were saying concerning the
[3:04:40] message a man what we were pointing to
[3:04:43] concerning the resurrection because
[3:04:45] suddenly the rapture concerning you know
[3:04:47] going on to perfection and more in into
[3:04:50] the image of our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[3:04:52] not William Branham no it was Jesus
[3:04:55] Christ
[3:04:56] if yet if he was pointing to anyone he
[3:04:58] was plenty to Jesus a man he didn't even
[3:05:00] want to either get his attention
[3:05:02] attention on him he wanted to get the
[3:05:04] attention on Jesus because he is is the
[3:05:07] resurrection and the rapture amen by the
[3:05:10] grace of God should we thank the Lord
[3:05:12] tonight a Merida's forty rather for the
[3:05:15] confirmation that he has given us
[3:05:17] through our brother
[3:05:18] Paula Fontaine a man to God be the glory
[3:05:21] a man and again I said he talked about
[3:05:25] the older generation when I'm part of
[3:05:27] that older dinner
[3:05:35] well Joshua came and ministered so caleb
[3:05:38] is going to confirm so we thank the Lord
[3:05:43] for that
[3:05:43] amen but it's amazing when he read that
[3:05:46] scripture and Moses my servant is dead
[3:05:49] a man so where do we go from here we
[3:05:52] can't we can't stay with Moses we be
[3:05:54] stably be in the wilderness hey man so
[3:05:56] let's go on with Joshua Caleb a man a
[3:05:59] man and it's going to give us the faith
[3:06:02] we need to get in and possess the land
[3:06:05] by the grace of God to God be the glory
[3:06:08] amen and I know there's some of the
[3:06:11] Saints here have confirmed to me Oh
[3:06:13] wonderful he said that brother just
[3:06:16] confirmed he said well you've been
[3:06:17] preaching he said that's good and then
[3:06:20] and it's been it's been a real blessing
[3:06:21] to their brother so praise the Lord to
[3:06:24] God be the glory amen
[3:06:26] so let's recognize what God has been
[3:06:28] revealing to us during these last three
[3:06:30] sermons amen
[3:06:32] let's move on from the messenger to the
[3:06:35] message we're not denying the messenger
[3:06:37] no not in any way we reverence and
[3:06:40] respect the messenger we thank God for
[3:06:42] the messenger a man but let us put the
[3:06:45] emphasis on the message and I like that
[3:06:48] quote besetting or you're going from the
[3:06:49] Prophet to the prophecy that's good
[3:06:52] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[3:06:54] a man so let's believe God what God has
[3:06:58] said not with her Bentham said what God
[3:07:01] said the prophet of God says this is not
[3:07:03] me he said I got to get myself out of
[3:07:05] the way and he said for him to do this
[3:07:07] him to do that and for for God to say
[3:07:09] what he wanted to say through the
[3:07:11] Prophet praise the name of the Lord
[3:07:13] let's believe the word a man to God be
[3:07:17] the glory
[3:07:18] amen and we've changed it as I said from
[3:07:22] the Prophet to the prophecy yes by the
[3:07:24] grace of God and again brother
[3:07:28] Paul didn't say that prophecy amen that
[3:07:33] was good
[3:07:33] oh praise the Lord that was good in what
[3:07:36] is the attraction on the mountain a man
[3:07:39] 19 and if 1965 praise the name of the
[3:07:44] Lord and the prophet knew he was going
[3:07:47] oh yeah
[3:07:48] no doubt he maybe he saw Moses was taken
[3:07:51] off the scene and God was going to take
[3:07:53] him off the senior praise the Lord
[3:07:55] hallelujah so there is a ministry that
[3:07:57] God's been raising up one after the
[3:07:59] other to get to get the message to the
[3:08:02] bride praise the name of the Lord Amen
[3:08:05] so god bless her brother
[3:08:07] Paula Fontaine and our sister Rebecca
[3:08:09] and amen and all the saints that have
[3:08:11] joined us here from central of land Lord
[3:08:14] bless you amen
[3:08:15] so the grace of God be with us and I
[3:08:19] could guess that I could go out a preach
[3:08:21] again as long as our brothers preach but
[3:08:25] we have we have to meet at our brother
[3:08:27] marks a place a system orange place for
[3:08:30] for natural fellowship but don't leave
[3:08:33] the spiritual behind

[3:08:38] before we go and I'm turn to our brother
[3:08:40] ba ba let's sing victory ahead amen
[3:08:44] when the host of Israel led by God a
[3:08:47] mayor round the walls of Jericho softly
[3:08:50] trot trusting in the Lord they felt the
[3:08:53] conquers trade by faith they saw the
[3:08:56] victory

[3:08:59] was preaching even today he said God
[3:09:02] bringing Israel out of Egypt amen
[3:09:05] but again Lord that like I said there's
[3:09:07] a lot of competitors ahead of the
[3:09:08] denominations and they want to go back
[3:09:10] now there they some have gone back and

[3:10:13] Israel said all we can't go in we can't
[3:10:15] go in and Caleb said if God be for us
