[39:59] us now in Jesus name we ask it amen amen
[40:03] God bless you thank you brother Josh for
[40:05] that song I had I had never heard it and
[40:07] that was absolutely beautiful it's just
[40:10] so worshipful such a wonderful song Amen
[40:12] praise the Lord amen turn if you would
[40:15] to Revelations chapter 3. Revelations
[40:17] chapter 3 and as your turn I would just
[40:20] want to make a quick announcement that
[40:21] uh the slides from the services are now
[40:24] being uploaded to YouTube so if you look
[40:26] in YouTube in the in just the
[40:28] description below the the video then
[40:31] he'll have a brother vaishal has put a
[40:32] link there to a to an online folder so
[40:35] if you're you know you're in service and
[40:37] you're writing notes and I know I go
[40:39] quickly and you can't remember what I
[40:41] said or what the quote was or the
[40:43] scripture was now you don't have to go
[40:44] and play through the entire sermon at a
[40:46] fast speed or scroll you can just go in
[40:48] the slides that are in the file there
[40:50] and you can get them yourself so we
[40:51] thought that would be helpful for those
[40:53] that sometimes like to go back and read
[40:55] or reference things and and it would
[40:57] just be available to you there so
[40:58] trusting that'll be a blessing
[41:00] men's small crowd Tonight I almost wish
[41:02] we could get everyone to move up a
[41:03] little closer preaching the back of the
[41:06] church amen but we're thankful for each
[41:07] one that's come out Revelation 3 verse
[41:09] 21 says to him that overcometh will I
[41:13] grant to sit with me and my throne even
[41:15] as I also overcame and am set down with
[41:18] my father in his throne amen God bless
[41:20] you you can have your seats and and this
[41:22] evening it's a it's a bit of an exciting
[41:25] time for me because I've been preaching
[41:27] so much on on the requirements of an
[41:30] adopted son or an adopted daughter of
[41:31] God and and we preached on those things
[41:33] and I know that as I'm preaching these
[41:35] things it can turn into a bit of a
[41:36] checklist it can feel like you know
[41:38] brother John's just up there and he's
[41:40] just writing this longer and longer and
[41:41] more detailed checklist of what we're
[41:43] supposed to be and who we're supposed to
[41:45] be and the characteristics we're
[41:46] supposed to have and the nature and the
[41:49] attitudes and all these things and what
[41:50] ends up is we end up with this scroll or
[41:53] the this this thick notepad of all the
[41:55] things we're supposed to be and we look
[41:57] at it and we say how in the world am I
[41:59] going to be all of that we look look at
[42:01] our lives and we say how in the world am
[42:02] I going to be what he's talking about up
[42:04] there and and of course Satan's there to
[42:06] point us to our failures and our our our
[42:08] faults and our flaws and all these
[42:11] different things and so tonight I'm just
[42:13] going to preach and I'm going to teach
[42:14] and I'm going to teach and I'm going to
[42:15] teach and I told brother vaishal and
[42:17] brother Matt I sent them the slides I
[42:19] said I said Don't Fear this is the
[42:21] longest slide deck I've ever brought to
[42:23] church but I'm going to be doing a lot
[42:24] of teaching so I move quickly when I'm
[42:26] teaching I don't tend to get hung up so
[42:28] unless the Lord slows me down I think
[42:30] we'll be okay tonight but I want to take
[42:31] a a a service title today called the way
[42:35] of adoption and we've been speaking
[42:37] about adoption we've been speaking about
[42:39] overcoming and we've been we've been
[42:41] talking about what it means to be a real
[42:42] believer in this age and we this we know
[42:44] this is the age of the Overcomer Amen in
[42:47] every age is an age of an overcomer but
[42:49] there is a specific Overcomer for this
[42:51] age and they're supposed to overcome a
[42:52] specific thing and every age had their
[42:54] their challenge their trial their
[42:56] difficulty their attitude that they had
[42:58] to overcome and we've got one as well
[43:00] amen and the scripture does not say to
[43:02] him that believeth
[43:03] to him that has Revelation to him that
[43:05] understandeth it says to him that
[43:07] overcometh amen so the requirement for
[43:09] the believer here in this age is as
[43:11] every other age that we must be an
[43:13] overcomer Above All Things amen we still
[43:15] have to believe we still have to have
[43:16] revelation we still have to have faith
[43:18] but we must be an overcomer in this age
[43:21] with what we're facing today so I want
[43:23] to I want to maybe build us up on this
[43:25] idea of of how you can be an overcomer
[43:28] how you can be an adopted son of God how
[43:30] do you pass the test how do you go
[43:32] through the training of God how do you
[43:33] sit under the leadership and the
[43:35] training of the Holy Spirit and come
[43:36] through try it as gold how do you get to
[43:38] that place how do you how do you develop
[43:40] into what it is that you're supposed to
[43:42] be as a son or daughter of God and and
[43:44] like I said I'm hoping to move quickly
[43:45] through this and the slides will be
[43:47] available to those that need them
[43:48] afterwards but that's because it's not
[43:50] rocket science
[43:51] the scripture is not difficult the
[43:53] scripture says the way is that even
[43:55] though a man was a fool he won't err in
[43:57] it amen it's not supposed to be
[43:59] difficult and I think sometimes what
[44:00] happens is we build up this big idea of
[44:02] what we're supposed to be and we forget
[44:04] the Simplicity of what it is to be a
[44:06] Christian because brother Brown would
[44:07] talk about that simple humble Victorious
[44:09] Christian life amen and that's where we
[44:11] really want to find our place so I want
[44:13] to start with as we're going there and
[44:15] I'll be preaching out of the message
[44:16] mostly how can I overcome and I want to
[44:20] tie the scriptures to the quotes here
[44:21] and and we'll just move through as we go
[44:23] and I want to start with this because it
[44:25] says in Ephesians 4 and he gave some
[44:27] Apostles some prophets and some
[44:29] evangelists and some pastors and
[44:31] teachers for the perfecting of the
[44:34] Saints
[44:35] the first purpose of the fivefold
[44:36] ministry is to bring you to Perfection
[44:38] not sinless Perfection but to maturity
[44:42] that's the first thing it says for the
[44:44] work of the ministry it's to bring you
[44:47] for the work of the ministry not just
[44:48] them they're already in the ministry but
[44:50] there is a Ministry for each and every
[44:52] one of us amen for the edifying of the
[44:54] body of Christ so the gifts that are
[44:56] given in the fivefold ministry are not
[44:58] for ourselves to use it is for your
[45:00] edification it's for the edification of
[45:02] the entire body of Christ how long until
[45:04] we come to the unity of the faith I
[45:07] believe brother Bram says that is the
[45:08] rapture
[45:09] but there's a Unity that has to happen
[45:11] here between all of the bride of Christ
[45:12] the global Body of Christ and Christ
[45:15] himself it says and the knowledge of the
[45:17] Son of God unto a perfect man Peter
[45:20] talks about that unto the measure of the
[45:22] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[45:25] we henceforth be no more children we're
[45:27] talking about adoption and that's why I
[45:29] start here is that the effect of the
[45:31] true five-fold Ministries that it takes
[45:33] you from children to adults it takes you
[45:36] from children to adopted Sons and
[45:38] Daughters of God which will be the
[45:39] manifested sons of God and Daughters of
[45:41] God toss to and fro you can't be tossed
[45:44] to and fro carried about with every wind
[45:46] of Doctrine by the Slate of men and
[45:48] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[45:50] wait to deceive but what speaking the
[45:52] truth in love
[45:54] if the words that come over this Pulpit
[45:56] are not dripping with love they won't
[45:58] have the right effect so I've got to
[46:00] keep my attitude I've got to keep my
[46:01] spirit I've got to keep my motive my
[46:03] objective right otherwise there's a
[46:04] tainted message that's coming across
[46:06] this pulpit and that's what I've got to
[46:08] do that's up to me to take care of he
[46:10] says what that they may grow up into him
[46:12] in all things which is the head even
[46:15] Christ
[46:16] brother Brown would say this he says but
[46:18] when we come here we are here for one
[46:21] specific purpose this is the house of
[46:23] correction this is the throne this is
[46:26] the Throne of God and judgment Goes
[46:28] Forth from the house of God and here is
[46:30] where we come Together We Gather in love
[46:34] with one another as only Christians can
[46:37] love there are things that happen in
[46:39] this church as in every every other
[46:41] message church or true believing Church
[46:43] there are things that happen here that
[46:44] can happen anywhere else and it's
[46:46] because We Gather in love
[46:48] that's why we can take correction we can
[46:50] take it when God is personal with us we
[46:52] can take it when our toes get stepped on
[46:54] these different things it's because we
[46:55] know that God's love is here and he's
[46:57] manifesting it through the preaching of
[46:58] the word he says but in here we are
[47:01] under the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[47:02] the Holy Ghost is among us and we're
[47:05] here to take Reckoning among us to see
[47:07] where our short places are are our
[47:10] shortcomings and how how can we catch
[47:15] from where we should be over to where we
[47:18] ought to be now where we are and where
[47:21] we ought to be
[47:22] and that's what we study ministers study
[47:25] those places for their people when they
[47:28] see the people the lack then they begin
[47:29] on that
[47:32] they begin on that that what where the
[47:34] lack is not with what you have but what
[47:36] you don't have
[47:38] what good is it to me to preach what you
[47:39] already have
[47:40] you need what you if you have need of
[47:42] something else that's what we need to
[47:43] bring here he says what now what a day
[47:47] what a time that we're living how that
[47:49] we should check up church now we talk
[47:51] about these things coming that's going
[47:53] to come we've been preaching about the
[47:55] full manifestation the adoption of the
[47:57] sons of God
[47:58] that's what's coming our way he says now
[48:01] today let's drop back here and see check
[48:04] ourselves and see if we're right in the
[48:06] faith so this is how he starts this
[48:08] whole idea on how can I overcome he says
[48:10] you've got to come with the right
[48:11] purpose you're going to overcome by
[48:13] recognizing why it is you're sitting
[48:15] under the preaching of the word why it
[48:17] is that you come to church amen this is
[48:19] after the preaching of the seals
[48:22] and that makes a difference to some
[48:23] people it doesn't make a difference to
[48:25] me but it's after the preaching of the
[48:26] seals and brother Brad I'm saying we've
[48:28] got to check up
[48:29] we have the opening of the word we have
[48:31] an understanding of these great
[48:33] Revelations but he says we've still got
[48:34] to check up because this is a time to
[48:36] check up because there's great things
[48:38] coming our way and we don't want to be
[48:40] the hindrance we don't want to be left
[48:41] outside the ark amen we want to be on
[48:43] board with these things what is it great
[48:46] Revelation is not a replacement for an
[48:48] overcoming life
[48:49] Revelation goes hand in hand with
[48:51] overcoming because a true Revelation has
[48:54] an effect in your life otherwise it's
[48:56] just head knowledge amen
[48:58] now we pointed to the fivefold ministry
[49:00] and they're they're a portion in
[49:02] overcoming in their place and the
[49:03] fivefold ministry will have an effect
[49:05] they've got to have an effect because
[49:07] they're anointed for purpose and there's
[49:09] got to be something that comes out of
[49:10] that amen there's got to be a Unity
[49:12] Among Us that cannot be broken and not
[49:14] just in a Unity as in a denomination
[49:16] where it's us for and no more but a
[49:18] Unity under the headship of the Holy
[49:19] Spirit under the headship of Christ in
[49:22] our lives but this is not the only time
[49:24] God's working on us relationship is not
[49:26] just built on Wednesday and Sundays
[49:29] it can't just be the one and a half
[49:31] hours maybe that I'll preach tonight or
[49:32] or the hour on Sunday mornings or
[49:34] something like that relationship is a
[49:36] day by day thing that we build up can
[49:38] you imagine husbands if we only spend
[49:40] time with our wives an hour and a half
[49:42] or two hours a week what would our
[49:43] relationship look like
[49:45] it'd be a mess wouldn't it
[49:47] so we've got to have something greater
[49:48] than what's just coming over this Pulpit
[49:50] there has to be something that's going
[49:52] on on a weekly basis on a daily basis
[49:54] that that helps us in these things
[49:56] brother Brown would continue he says and
[49:58] almost all every quote in this except
[50:00] for a couple is from how can I overcome
[50:01] he says now I want to take my subject
[50:04] this morning of how can I overcome now I
[50:07] chose this because I think that it's a
[50:09] time that we should never let the spirit
[50:11] of Revival die
[50:13] we've got to keep in Revival constantly
[50:16] revived every day and Paul said he had
[50:19] to Die daily that Christ could live and
[50:22] we must never we must never let that
[50:26] Revival die within us now it sounds like
[50:29] I'm putting pressure on us but I'm not
[50:31] but I'm talking about the way of
[50:33] adoption the way to be adopted and this
[50:35] is the first one and that's don't let
[50:37] the relationship die don't let the
[50:39] Revival die don't let the Love Die For
[50:41] Christ in your life you've got to keep
[50:43] that awake you've got to keep that fed
[50:45] you've got to keep on top of it you've
[50:47] got to keep feeding it you've got to
[50:48] keep contributing to it
[50:50] that's the only way it's going to work
[50:52] because otherwise you're going to get
[50:54] cold and you're going to get formal and
[50:55] you're going to get starchy because it's
[50:57] just something in your head rather than
[50:58] something that's being expressed in our
[51:00] heart amen we're being restored we're
[51:02] being redeemed we're being revived back
[51:04] to what we were
[51:06] we are not now what we will be Paul said
[51:09] but there's going to come a day where we
[51:11] are exactly what he said we're going to
[51:13] be we're being restored we're being
[51:15] revived back to fullness of life
[51:18] that's what the Resurrection The Rapture
[51:20] is that's the ultimate Revival is when
[51:21] now you have eternal life and you have a
[51:23] new body that won't die and won't be
[51:25] sick and won't cause you problems the
[51:27] way it does today amen but we've got to
[51:28] be focused on that idea of Revival not
[51:31] Revival in the shouting and dancing and
[51:33] everything because the strongest
[51:34] relationships aren't full of shouting
[51:36] and dancing all the time
[51:37] you might ask men we're not sweeping our
[51:39] wives off of their feet every day
[51:41] and our wives are not seducing us every
[51:43] night either there's a stability that
[51:45] comes with it but there's a constancy
[51:47] that comes with a relationship that's
[51:49] being worked on every day
[51:51] and that's what he's looking for is a
[51:52] priority in our lives amen
[51:55] he says now notice each Church age the
[51:58] same overcome when they eat Sun out of
[52:00] each Church age overcame the temptation
[52:03] of that age
[52:05] every age has a Temptation and everyone
[52:07] has to overcome that way he says the
[52:10] same now see I said to you at the
[52:11] beginning you are born defeated
[52:15] and that birth can never bring you to
[52:17] life because you're born defeated and
[52:19] you're in a defeated World amongst
[52:21] defeated people amongst defeated Creeds
[52:23] defeated denominations you've got to
[52:25] come to Victory some way some other way
[52:29] he says it's just like a lily a lily I
[52:32] think is one of the prettiest flowers
[52:34] that there is how it's in Radiance now
[52:36] where does it come from it's what it's a
[52:39] little seed
[52:41] you say brother John I'm a little
[52:42] nothing this evening perfect you're just
[52:44] like what he's talking about
[52:46] where is it it's down in the bottom of a
[52:49] muddy monkey pond
[52:51] now if I was to tell that Lily that one
[52:53] day you're gonna be up above the muck in
[52:56] the pond and right now you're just a
[52:58] hard little seed and nothing can seem to
[53:00] get to you and you're surrounded by the
[53:02] filth and the detritus of all of the
[53:04] ocean or the pond that you're in but one
[53:06] day you're going to be up there and
[53:07] you're going to be this beautiful white
[53:09] blossomy flower with green leaves and
[53:12] everyone will look at you and wonder
[53:13] about you and how beautiful you are and
[53:15] admire you if I put that checklist in
[53:17] front of a lily while it's down in the
[53:19] bottom in a seed form what would it say
[53:21] ain't no way
[53:23] ain't no way look at me brother John
[53:26] look at me I'm just a little seed I
[53:28] don't look anything like that but
[53:30] there's something inside it that will
[53:31] bring it to that place if it gets in the
[53:33] right conditions amen that's what you've
[53:35] got to realize is what you have right
[53:37] here is just conditions but that's not
[53:39] you
[53:40] that's just how you look right now
[53:42] that's just how the situation looks
[53:43] that's just how the world works but
[53:45] that's not what matters he says but that
[53:47] little seed yet all the radiance that'll
[53:49] ever shine in it is in it right then
[53:51] when it's in that mud but it has to
[53:54] strive daily what knowing that there is
[53:57] something knowing that there is
[53:59] something within it that is more than
[54:00] what it sees and feels right then there
[54:02] is something that is calling there's
[54:04] something that's pulling from the inside
[54:05] on these things it's black it's dirty
[54:08] it's Mucky it's slimy in that slime that
[54:11] it's living in yet it presses its way
[54:13] through the mud the muck and the waters
[54:15] and the stagnant places until it sticks
[54:18] its head above in the light and
[54:20] expresses what's been hidden it all the
[54:23] time
[54:24] he says I think that's an overcomer that
[54:27] once in sin did once did things that
[54:29] were wrong don't worry about it now once
[54:32] did things that was wrong then but now
[54:34] why look back into the pond again God by
[54:37] his predestination has brought the sea
[54:39] to life and it's pressing itself see
[54:40] it's coming to light and now on top of
[54:43] all of that it has overcome
[54:45] see it didn't Express itself down there
[54:48] it's getting up to express itself
[54:51] neither did you in your sin in adultery
[54:53] in everything that you lived in you
[54:55] didn't Express nothing but there was a
[54:57] seed in there and it got a chance to
[54:59] press itself into light
[55:02] and now you're in the presence of Jesus
[55:04] Christ with the sunlight it brought out
[55:07] what you really was in the beginning you
[55:09] see what I mean you saw the light you
[55:11] bloomed out you laid your heart open and
[55:14] now you're a lily
[55:15] the Lily didn't even know what a lily
[55:17] looked like until it became what until
[55:19] it came into the presence of the Sun
[55:22] its shape was different all the way
[55:23] through its different stages
[55:25] first that had to rot the shell and
[55:27] break it open then it's just a little
[55:28] sprig and it's going up up and it's just
[55:31] a vine
[55:32] it's just a long skinny thing and it's
[55:34] not till it gets to the top that that
[55:36] bud opens up and it really realizes what
[55:38] it is
[55:39] he says we're the same thing he says you
[55:42] laid your heart open and now you're a
[55:43] Lily that's the Overcomer he overcome
[55:46] the mod he overcome the things of the
[55:48] world and now he freely gives himself
[55:50] out everyone can look at him his life
[55:53] you can't put a finger on it see he's a
[55:55] real Overcomer you can't say nothing
[55:57] about him now say well he came out of
[55:59] the mud but he's not in the mud now
[56:03] you're not in the mud now don't worry
[56:05] what you came out of worry about where
[56:06] you are now that's what matters
[56:09] we all come from different backgrounds
[56:11] we all come from different situations we
[56:13] all have different genetics we all have
[56:15] natural flaws don't worry about that
[56:17] where are you now
[56:18] are you going towards the light he's not
[56:21] in the mud now he's on top of it amen
[56:24] you can't now point back what he was
[56:26] what is he now he's on top
[56:29] like the Lily he's above the darkness
[56:32] the of the mud he's above the darkness
[56:34] of the Muddy Waters he's in the light
[56:36] reflecting the beauty that was put in
[56:38] him before he left the Mahdi man he says
[56:40] now I feel like a shouting Christian
[56:43] when you can finally express it
[56:46] when it's finally real when it's finally
[56:48] been made manifest when we can finally
[56:50] see what this has all been about that's
[56:51] when we want to shout but that's why
[56:54] we've been given a more sure word of
[56:55] Prophecy that's why we've been given an
[56:57] open word is so that we can Rejoice
[56:59] through the process understanding that
[57:01] the change is bringing us to the final
[57:03] change when we'll be exactly as he was
[57:06] amen
[57:07] amen what was in there by God at the
[57:10] beginning
[57:11] it pressed its way through it overcome
[57:13] it overcome the shell
[57:15] it overcome the shell
[57:17] it overcome the mud it overcome
[57:19] everything we surrounded our lives with
[57:21] it overcome the waters it overcome
[57:23] everything and wasn't Overcomer and
[57:26] reflected the Beauty and the glory of
[57:28] God
[57:29] we can look at our lives and we can say
[57:31] it was a mess in some areas it still is
[57:34] a mess and there's things that are
[57:36] trying to bury us and drown us and cover
[57:38] us up but as long as we're drawn by the
[57:40] Light we're going to come through
[57:41] eventually
[57:43] some of us are in shallower ponds than
[57:45] others
[57:46] some of us draw it a little better than
[57:48] others but don't worry as long as you're
[57:50] drawing you're going to get to the top
[57:51] and you'll you'll be able to see what it
[57:53] was all about amen that's the overcoming
[57:56] part amen getting past what's all around
[57:58] you so you can bloom into what God has
[58:00] for you what pulls it out
[58:03] does the Lily pull itself out
[58:05] no the sun pulls it out being in the
[58:08] presence of the Sun in the light in the
[58:10] warmth that is what pulls it out lilies
[58:13] don't bloom in the winter under the ice
[58:15] they bloom in the spring and in the
[58:17] Summers everything heats up and it pulls
[58:19] them out of where they were amen it
[58:21] responds to the Sun
[58:23] that's what causes overcoming responding
[58:26] to the Sun
[58:27] responding to the presence of God
[58:29] responding to the presence of the holy
[58:31] spirit in your lives amen we're talking
[58:33] about overcoming we're talking about
[58:35] passing the test and the first thing to
[58:37] realize is that you're built to pass the
[58:40] test
[58:40] you're made to pass the test amen you're
[58:44] built to come through everything that's
[58:45] around you to rise above it and to
[58:48] produce what's been inside you by what
[58:50] God's predestination
[58:52] that's what an overcomer is is somebody
[58:54] is built from the beginning to overcome
[58:56] you've been called to be an overcomer
[58:58] there's a prize for the Overcomer and if
[59:00] there's a prize it means there's
[59:01] somebody that's going to get it and it's
[59:03] got to be you and it's got to be me this
[59:04] evening amen
[59:07] Jesus would type the children of God to
[59:10] wheat and what makes wheat mature is
[59:13] this familiar brother Mark what makes
[59:15] wheat mature
[59:16] see you plant the wheat and they plant
[59:18] it in the in the early spring and then
[59:20] what happens is the rain and weed takes
[59:22] a lot of rain initially takes a lot of
[59:24] rain and brother Brandon would call it
[59:25] what a teaching rain
[59:27] he called the teaching ring we had an
[59:29] open word to teach us what was right and
[59:31] then what happens is what the Sun comes
[59:33] and then it rains and then the Sun and
[59:35] then the rain and the Sun and the rain
[59:36] and it needs that cycle to dry it out
[59:40] but to water it and keep it alive and
[59:42] keep it growing and give it all the
[59:43] nutrients but there comes a point where
[59:45] it's time to ripen
[59:47] and in the ripening time everything else
[59:50] of the wheat dies out the stock dies out
[59:52] the roots die out the leaves dry out the
[59:55] husk everything falls away and all
[59:58] that's left is what was inside that
[1:00:00] grain in the first place and it's
[1:00:01] sitting there and it's just got to ripen
[1:00:03] how in the sun no more rain no more rain
[1:00:07] we're not going to have any more opening
[1:00:09] of this word it's done there's no
[1:00:11] greater Revelation coming there's no
[1:00:13] eighth Prophet there's no eighth
[1:00:15] messenger there's no greater thing
[1:00:16] coming the bride has had her Revival in
[1:00:19] the teaching side and now it's time to
[1:00:21] do what machara's Sons and Daughters of
[1:00:23] God in the presence of Christ the word
[1:00:25] himself the person of him amen
[1:00:28] this is what the prophet of God will say
[1:00:31] he says the thing that's the matter with
[1:00:33] the message today not the Baptist not
[1:00:36] the Pentecostals not the lutherans not
[1:00:37] the no no no he says the thing that's
[1:00:39] wrong with the message today
[1:00:42] this is for us church is those who
[1:00:45] obtain it in their hearts
[1:00:47] must lay in the presence of the sun to
[1:00:50] get ripened see you can pick up the
[1:00:52] message and then let the sun bake all
[1:00:55] the greenness out of you see making
[1:00:57] mature Christians see what I mean God is
[1:01:00] coming soon to receive his church and we
[1:01:02] must have that type of Christians for
[1:01:03] him to receive the wheat has got to get
[1:01:06] ripe
[1:01:07] how do you know when the weed is ripe
[1:01:09] when it looks exactly like what went
[1:01:11] into the ground when you plant that and
[1:01:13] the same thing comes out that it was
[1:01:14] that it brought forth in the first place
[1:01:16] the same thing that Christ was you are
[1:01:18] and you'll be planted and you'll bring
[1:01:20] forth the same thing
[1:01:21] that's how you know when you're right
[1:01:23] when you do what he does
[1:01:25] that's how you know and it can only come
[1:01:28] through what being in the presence of
[1:01:30] God
[1:01:31] the presence of God cannot just be a
[1:01:33] church experience
[1:01:35] we love it when there's this sweet
[1:01:36] presence here don't we brother Dale we
[1:01:38] love it when the anointing of God is
[1:01:39] here we love it when it's electric we
[1:01:41] love all of those things but if this is
[1:01:43] the only place we experience the
[1:01:45] presence of God I'm sorry there's a
[1:01:47] problem with our relationship with God
[1:01:49] it cannot only be here it cannot only be
[1:01:52] here
[1:01:53] it's got to be at home it's got to be in
[1:01:56] your devotions it's got to be when
[1:01:57] you're singing when you're driving your
[1:01:59] car it's got to be when you're listening
[1:02:01] to the messages it's got to be when
[1:02:03] you're speaking to God you've got to
[1:02:05] recognize his presence in your life
[1:02:06] otherwise you're not maturing
[1:02:10] it's got to be
[1:02:12] if there's one thing I can cry out
[1:02:13] tonight say is God real in your life
[1:02:17] personally not just in the church
[1:02:20] service amen
[1:02:22] church this is what what's he saying
[1:02:24] he's saying it's no longer just about
[1:02:26] having the word now is the time to be
[1:02:28] the word
[1:02:29] that's what a mature believer is that's
[1:02:31] what adopted son and daughter of God is
[1:02:33] is they are the word they don't just
[1:02:35] have the word we've had this word for so
[1:02:37] long
[1:02:38] we've had the opening of the word since
[1:02:40] 1963 60 years almost to the day
[1:02:44] 60 years almost to the day that the
[1:02:45] seals were opened we've had it a long
[1:02:48] time
[1:02:49] about time we matured I think
[1:02:51] amen
[1:02:54] he said in Noah's time a type of today
[1:02:56] Jesus referred to it and said as it was
[1:02:58] in Noah's Time Shows shall it be in the
[1:03:00] coming of the son of man in Noah's time
[1:03:02] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:03:03] of man notice there were all that
[1:03:05] anti-diluvian World perhaps of millions
[1:03:07] of people there were eight Overcomers
[1:03:10] eight people overcome that was real
[1:03:12] genuine Overcomers there was Noah's
[1:03:15] three sons and their wives and Noah and
[1:03:16] his wife eight overcome that entered the
[1:03:18] Ark at the appropriate time but how did
[1:03:21] they do it they listened to the word of
[1:03:24] God faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:03:26] by the word
[1:03:29] real actions
[1:03:30] right actions follow the hearing of the
[1:03:33] word because it puts you into it puts
[1:03:35] your faith into action amen he says they
[1:03:37] listen to the word of God they weren't
[1:03:39] caught outside the door they were caught
[1:03:41] inside the door notice he uses the
[1:03:43] phrase cop because God they didn't open
[1:03:45] and close the door they built the door
[1:03:47] and then God closed it and they were
[1:03:49] caught on the inside because they had
[1:03:51] obeyed the word they didn't close it God
[1:03:54] caught them on the inside and he caught
[1:03:55] everybody else out God decided when that
[1:03:58] door closed he says oh my beloved
[1:04:00] friends don't let that door shut Jesus
[1:04:02] said as it was in that day so shall it
[1:04:04] be in the coming of the son of man now
[1:04:07] there's somebody going to get caught
[1:04:08] outside that door many of them might
[1:04:10] have had good intentions and say someday
[1:04:12] if such things happen we'll go in with
[1:04:14] brother Noah because he's a fine fellow
[1:04:16] but you see it caught just eight inside
[1:04:18] then think hard now if you're laying
[1:04:21] around getting Dodie get in hurry quick
[1:04:25] because the door might close at any time
[1:04:28] he says there's always been an ark in
[1:04:30] God's economy there was an ark in the
[1:04:32] days of Noah for the saving of his
[1:04:34] people there was an ark in the days of
[1:04:35] the law the Ark of testimony and the
[1:04:37] days of the law they followed the ark
[1:04:39] and there is a third dispensation now
[1:04:41] like Noah's time lot's time and now this
[1:04:43] time there is an ark now and that Ark is
[1:04:46] not a denomination neither is it a good
[1:04:48] works that you do but it's by one Spirit
[1:04:50] Romans 8 1 we are all baptized into one
[1:04:53] body in the domain of that Kingdom one's
[1:04:56] spiritual baptism no matter how good how
[1:04:59] bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by
[1:05:02] what Holy Ghost baptism see that's the
[1:05:06] only way you overcome
[1:05:09] if that's the only way you overcome that
[1:05:11] means that's got to be the starting
[1:05:12] point for overcoming
[1:05:14] it's all that are under the shed blood
[1:05:17] that are Overcomers because you cannot
[1:05:19] overcome yourself
[1:05:21] it's he that overcome for you you're
[1:05:24] resting
[1:05:26] what a contradiction of the way we think
[1:05:28] he says he overcome for you now you're
[1:05:31] resting in that amen Jesus told
[1:05:33] Nicodemus except the man be born again
[1:05:35] he cannot see he cannot understand the
[1:05:38] kingdom of God you've got to have the
[1:05:40] new birth and that means you've got to
[1:05:42] have the Holy Ghost to be an adopted son
[1:05:44] or daughter you've got to have the Holy
[1:05:45] Ghost to be an overcomer in this age
[1:05:47] that's it
[1:05:49] it cannot be a message religion
[1:05:52] that'll kill you just as much as
[1:05:54] Catholicism or any of these other ones
[1:05:56] will do it'll kill you just the same and
[1:05:58] that's blasphemy to some people but I
[1:06:00] say it again without the Holy Ghost you
[1:06:03] are lost
[1:06:05] I don't know any other way to say it
[1:06:07] without the Holy Ghost you are lost amen
[1:06:11] don't let the basics of coming to church
[1:06:13] and saying that we we believe God sent a
[1:06:15] prophet and he sent us an end time
[1:06:17] message keep us from the fact that we
[1:06:19] have to repent be baptized and receive
[1:06:22] the Holy Ghost to make it in a Rapture
[1:06:23] that is the absolute minimum requirement
[1:06:26] to go in a Rapture amen
[1:06:28] Church let's be Overcomers in our
[1:06:30] day-to-day lives by the Holy Spirit
[1:06:31] leading us and guiding us
[1:06:34] he says I was crossing an Old Log the
[1:06:36] other day down what is called a hollow
[1:06:38] and I jumped up on this log on the
[1:06:41] outside it looked good
[1:06:43] nothing wrong with looking good on the
[1:06:44] outside nothing wrong with looking like
[1:06:46] a Christian on the outside it said look
[1:06:48] like a big old beach log but when I
[1:06:50] jumped on it oh a great chunk of it fell
[1:06:52] off it was real rotten and Dody I said
[1:06:55] that's the way Christians are becoming
[1:06:57] looking good on the outside but rotten
[1:06:59] on the inside they've been dead and sin
[1:07:01] and trespasses so long till they become
[1:07:04] Doty they can hold no weight at all they
[1:07:07] don't know what overcoming means and I
[1:07:09] begin to think of this text then that
[1:07:11] overcome means keep life in you when
[1:07:16] life went out that's what brought that
[1:07:18] log to that condition now listen to this
[1:07:20] he says see and it made it worse than
[1:07:23] ever when it laid in the branch where
[1:07:25] the water was
[1:07:26] this will blow your mind what he says
[1:07:28] next he says you take a Christian that's
[1:07:30] supposed to be a Christian let the life
[1:07:33] of God go from him in the experience the
[1:07:35] joy of serving Christ and living in a
[1:07:37] church where such is going on living in
[1:07:40] a church where there's joy where there's
[1:07:41] peace where there's rest where there's
[1:07:42] the real life of Christ he says living
[1:07:44] in a church where that's going on he
[1:07:47] rottens twice as quick right living
[1:07:49] right under
[1:07:51] wow
[1:07:54] if you're out from under it it will
[1:07:56] cause you to rot rather than to live
[1:07:59] because what it's judgment
[1:08:01] it's judgment to refuse it as judgment
[1:08:05] he says so if we're trying to follow the
[1:08:07] message of the hour are we trying to
[1:08:09] follow the message of the hour he says
[1:08:11] or at least this part of the message we
[1:08:13] should live constantly in the Life of
[1:08:16] Christ
[1:08:17] see because if you don't you lay around
[1:08:19] and know that these things that you're
[1:08:21] supposed to do and don't do it the Bible
[1:08:23] said he that knoweth to do good and
[1:08:25] doeth and not to him it's sin then you
[1:08:27] become Doty and rotten when you're
[1:08:29] separated from the life of God so he
[1:08:31] says so strive we're talking about the
[1:08:33] path the way of adoption how do I
[1:08:35] overcome he says so strived with all
[1:08:38] that's in you to do what to stay in the
[1:08:41] Life of Christ
[1:08:43] why that you would be fruit bearing now
[1:08:46] be careful he didn't say don't strive he
[1:08:49] didn't say strive to bear fruit
[1:08:51] he didn't say that he said strive to
[1:08:54] stay in the Life of Christ so that
[1:08:56] you'll bear fruit
[1:08:58] the striving is to stay in the presence
[1:09:00] of God not strive to bear fruit because
[1:09:03] you get it twisted around and you start
[1:09:04] trying to produce the right fruit and
[1:09:06] you'll fail every time
[1:09:08] because it's not you that bears it it's
[1:09:10] the holy spirit in you it's the life
[1:09:12] that's in you that's going to bear that
[1:09:13] fruit so you've got to stay connected to
[1:09:15] the vine you've got to stay connected to
[1:09:17] the main trunk there that's where the
[1:09:19] fruit is going to come from is the life
[1:09:20] that's connected to that so he says
[1:09:22] strive to stay connected to God
[1:09:26] how do brother Bradham said they said
[1:09:28] brother Bradham how do I how do I
[1:09:30] improve my relationship with God how do
[1:09:32] I get close to God he said two things
[1:09:35] read your Bible and pray
[1:09:38] and you know what most people won't do
[1:09:39] today
[1:09:40] read your Bible and pray
[1:09:43] because it's too simple
[1:09:45] it's too simple
[1:09:47] and it takes time and it takes
[1:09:48] dedication read your Bible and pray
[1:09:51] that'll keep you connected to Christ
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:55] the battle is not to bear fruit the
[1:09:57] battle is to stay with the word of God
[1:09:58] to yield to the Holy Spirit to be in his
[1:10:00] presence on a daily basis amen the
[1:10:02] battle isn't fruit bearing the battle is
[1:10:04] to stay connected to life
[1:10:06] because Satan's trying to cut that off
[1:10:08] day in and day out trying to stay in the
[1:10:10] right atmosphere
[1:10:11] we have a long day at work we have a
[1:10:13] rough day with the kids at home trying
[1:10:15] to stay in the right atmosphere and
[1:10:16] you're looking for the fruits of the
[1:10:17] spirit it's hard it's a battle it's a
[1:10:19] struggle but don't worry because you're
[1:10:21] not bearing fruit worry because that
[1:10:22] means that you're not connected to the
[1:10:24] life
[1:10:25] that's where our battle is strive to be
[1:10:27] there
[1:10:28] he says this now we see these hours that
[1:10:31] we're in this stage and we see what it
[1:10:34] is we know where we're at church
[1:10:36] and the Holy Ghost is rebuking the age
[1:10:38] that put him out but he says in all of
[1:10:40] that did you notice to him that
[1:10:42] overcometh even in that worldly Wicked
[1:10:45] Church age him that overcometh what's he
[1:10:48] saying he's saying when you read the
[1:10:49] word of God and you see the age we're in
[1:10:51] and the condition that this world is in
[1:10:52] don't read it and say we can't come out
[1:10:54] of it he says read that there is an
[1:10:56] overcomer that's got to come through it
[1:10:58] and say I'm that Overcomer that's the
[1:11:01] part that's for me the parts that for me
[1:11:03] is not that they're rich and increased
[1:11:04] with goods and have need of nothing the
[1:11:06] part that's for me is that we have one
[1:11:08] we invited Christ into our home and he's
[1:11:10] sitting down and he's feeding us and
[1:11:12] what we have overcome that's the part he
[1:11:15] says focus on the fact that there is an
[1:11:17] overcomer that comes out of this mess
[1:11:18] this muck that we're in
[1:11:21] what is it ask God to work on the
[1:11:24] checklist of brother John's been
[1:11:25] preaching a storm on over the last few
[1:11:27] months
[1:11:28] that you're supposed to be this and
[1:11:29] you're supposed to do that that's not
[1:11:31] your checklist to do that's God's to do
[1:11:33] for you
[1:11:34] but you've got to let him in you've got
[1:11:35] to let him work on these things amen we
[1:11:38] think overcoming is all about us and
[1:11:39] there is a portion that is remember we
[1:11:41] read that quote where brother Brown says
[1:11:42] he can't push you through the pipe and
[1:11:44] then say you overcame he says you got to
[1:11:46] do something you got to do something but
[1:11:48] what do you have to do you have to fight
[1:11:50] to stay connected that's your fight is
[1:11:52] to stay connected
[1:11:54] it's not us that wins the battles
[1:11:56] against Satan it's not us that has has
[1:11:57] the great weapons that we make ourselves
[1:11:59] it's not us that has anything that can
[1:12:01] overcome but we stay connected to the
[1:12:03] overcomer
[1:12:04] the Holy Spirit and that's what's going
[1:12:07] to give us the victory in our lives amen
[1:12:08] the struggle is not to win the struggle
[1:12:11] is not to have Victory the struggle is
[1:12:12] to what let him work through us
[1:12:16] and do the work remember in Hebrews 4 11
[1:12:18] I think it is he says that that would
[1:12:20] let us labor to enter into that rest
[1:12:24] let us labor to enter into the rest that
[1:12:26] is he has already overcome the world and
[1:12:29] I just have to get in him and I've
[1:12:30] automatically got every bit of
[1:12:31] overcoming that I need in my life
[1:12:35] first John says ye are of God Little
[1:12:37] Children You are of God
[1:12:41] what a statement you're of God
[1:12:43] you're not of of Lanny and Sandy
[1:12:46] curlette
[1:12:48] you're not of of Gus and Elise Colombo
[1:12:52] you're not of Joseph and Priscilla
[1:12:54] coffee you are of God little children
[1:12:57] and have overcome them why because
[1:13:01] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:13:04] that is in the world
[1:13:05] brother Brian would say now how will I
[1:13:07] know then that I'm in there
[1:13:09] he says watch what kind of a life you're
[1:13:10] living
[1:13:11] just look around see if it's lived out
[1:13:13] of you automatically or do you have to
[1:13:15] strain and policy then you're doing it
[1:13:18] but don't try to do it he says did you
[1:13:20] ever try I love this he says did you
[1:13:22] ever try he says yeah don't
[1:13:26] it's kind of a modern way of saying he
[1:13:28] says yeah don't try he says just like
[1:13:30] putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve
[1:13:32] hole you see he's just up and down and
[1:13:34] over and everything else see he can't do
[1:13:35] it put on your coat honey he can't do it
[1:13:38] little arm is up and down around it
[1:13:40] takes your Steady Hand he says oh how
[1:13:43] glad I am I can just yield my hand to
[1:13:45] father and say Lord Jesus I can't get in
[1:13:48] there you help me put the code on me he
[1:13:51] says I quit trying just let him do it
[1:13:54] see
[1:13:56] if you're putting yourself under
[1:13:58] pressure you've got the wrong approach
[1:14:03] it's not you that's going to do it so
[1:14:04] don't put yourself under pressure to do
[1:14:06] it put yourself under pressure to get
[1:14:08] close to the one that's going to do it
[1:14:09] for you amen listen it's good to be
[1:14:12] focused we want to be seeking the
[1:14:13] scripture says seek and you'll find
[1:14:15] knock and it'll be open to you seek the
[1:14:17] things of God but don't think the things
[1:14:19] of God are going to be yours because you
[1:14:20] tried
[1:14:21] they're yours because he's going to
[1:14:23] provide and he's going to be the life
[1:14:24] that does it inside of you amen you've
[1:14:26] got to realize this is a work of God in
[1:14:28] your life not the work of you in your
[1:14:29] life
[1:14:31] that'll that'll give you rest that'll
[1:14:33] help you sleep at night when you say it
[1:14:34] ain't cause I did it it's because he did
[1:14:36] it for me and all I'm doing is I'm going
[1:14:38] to him in expectation seeking what he's
[1:14:40] already promised
[1:14:43] he says if the little baby keeps trying
[1:14:45] oh I can do it I can do it ever tried to
[1:14:48] keep doing something
[1:14:49] in this word
[1:14:51] I have many times
[1:14:54] and sometimes you get six months before
[1:14:56] you did it again
[1:14:57] before you lost your temper before you
[1:14:59] looked at something before you did
[1:15:00] something whatever it might be but you
[1:15:02] always keep falling but you say Lord you
[1:15:05] do it that's when you'll see the results
[1:15:09] he says oh I can do it I can do it he's
[1:15:11] just everywhere he can't do it neither
[1:15:13] can you neither can I but if we'll just
[1:15:15] hold still and let him do it just yield
[1:15:17] to him here Lord here I am just let me
[1:15:20] be nothing I yield you put my hand in
[1:15:23] the right place he says that's the
[1:15:25] victory that's overcoming the thing you
[1:15:28] have to overcome is yourself your idea
[1:15:31] your thing and surrender yourself to him
[1:15:33] he overcome for you he knows the way we
[1:15:37] don't you've got to let go of the
[1:15:39] control so he can put you where you want
[1:15:42] to be
[1:15:43] because what you want the coat on
[1:15:45] because he's told you to put the coat on
[1:15:47] but you can't put the code on because
[1:15:49] you're just a little kid compared to him
[1:15:51] so you gotta say Lord you want me to put
[1:15:53] the coat on I can't do it so you got to
[1:15:55] put the coat on Lord you want me to have
[1:15:57] peace that passes understanding Lord you
[1:15:58] want me to have joy you want me to have
[1:16:00] peace you want me to you know reduce my
[1:16:02] temper you want no no I can't do that
[1:16:04] Lord You're gonna have to do it for me I
[1:16:06] just don't know how to do it I can't do
[1:16:08] anything good in myself
[1:16:10] he says
[1:16:13] he says whatever you do who is listening
[1:16:16] now or who will listen Hereafter he says
[1:16:18] the hour is very late and you do have
[1:16:20] good intentions but be caught inside now
[1:16:23] don't struggle not him that willeth or
[1:16:25] him that runeth but God but God that
[1:16:28] showeth Mercy he says just like God just
[1:16:30] yield yourself to him and walk on with a
[1:16:33] perfect satisfied faith that what God
[1:16:36] has promised who is able to perform
[1:16:39] what God has promised I am able to
[1:16:41] perform no what God has promised he is
[1:16:44] able to perform God is the guarantor of
[1:16:46] his own promise I'm not God's guarantor
[1:16:48] he is so he says he is able to perform
[1:16:50] it
[1:16:51] not joining one denomination another
[1:16:53] denomination running this that or the
[1:16:55] other trying this just yield yourself to
[1:16:57] God and walk with him peaceful quiet not
[1:17:01] interrupted just keep on walking with
[1:17:03] him
[1:17:04] listen to this he says that's what I
[1:17:06] told our brother that just had a
[1:17:07] breakdown
[1:17:09] see just yield to him he's here he who
[1:17:12] knew what you have done and what caused
[1:17:15] your being and doing this way and all
[1:17:17] that he knows all about you
[1:17:20] he knows all of our weaknesses church he
[1:17:22] knows all of our inclinations he knows
[1:17:24] all of our failures
[1:17:25] and now he's just told you back just
[1:17:28] what to do now I said the only thing you
[1:17:30] have to do is just go do it what God
[1:17:33] tells you to do go do it in simple
[1:17:36] obedience he says but what is it that he
[1:17:38] told him to do
[1:17:39] he didn't say go live and overcoming
[1:17:41] life he said forget all about the past
[1:17:45] walk live for the future in the glory
[1:17:49] and presence of God
[1:17:51] what's the principle what is the way of
[1:17:53] adoption just keep walking
[1:17:55] just keep trusting just keep moving
[1:17:58] forward Prophet God said when we're
[1:17:59] standing still we're backsliding
[1:18:02] footsteps is possession just keep going
[1:18:04] trust that he is able to do that he is
[1:18:07] able to perform in your life what he
[1:18:08] said was supposed to be there
[1:18:11] God never sets the requirement that he
[1:18:13] can't fulfill
[1:18:14] in you and in me he never does it he's
[1:18:16] not an unjust God in these things
[1:18:19] he says what do it walk live in the
[1:18:23] future in the glory and the presence of
[1:18:25] God
[1:18:27] catch us now
[1:18:29] you look back and you say I'm doing this
[1:18:30] and I'm doing that
[1:18:32] I've got issues brother John brother
[1:18:34] John's got issues
[1:18:37] I've got problems
[1:18:39] listen to this he says then no you're
[1:18:42] defeated
[1:18:43] don't look at what you're doing and say
[1:18:44] I'm defeated no he says but there's no
[1:18:47] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:18:49] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[1:18:52] after the spirit he says then you
[1:18:54] realize that you've overcome when you're
[1:18:56] in Christ there is no condemnation he's
[1:18:58] not holding it against you it's under
[1:19:00] the blood and there's a power inside of
[1:19:02] you that's going to take you past it
[1:19:04] he says there's no condemnation he's not
[1:19:06] condemning you because it's under the
[1:19:08] blood but what he's doing is is he
[1:19:09] giving you something to overcome it in
[1:19:11] your life
[1:19:12] because you've got to be an overcomer
[1:19:14] and he's providing the path and the way
[1:19:16] for you he says and you know he's a
[1:19:18] devil you can't say I got a sickness and
[1:19:20] I don't believe it's a sickness oh yes
[1:19:22] it is a sickness you got cancer you
[1:19:24] don't believe it's a cancer it's a
[1:19:26] cancer he says but remember greater is
[1:19:29] he that's in you than he that's in the
[1:19:30] world you must realize that the Holy
[1:19:34] Spirit that's in you has already
[1:19:35] overcome this thing
[1:19:38] and he's in you and you can overcome by
[1:19:41] him that's exactly sensible it's exactly
[1:19:44] the way the scripture is written notice
[1:19:46] overcome that God that's in you is
[1:19:48] greater than the one that's in him the
[1:19:50] God of this world is not as great as the
[1:19:52] god of Heaven which is in you no more
[1:19:54] than Darkness can stand in the presence
[1:19:56] of light he says now Darkness cannot
[1:19:58] stand in the presence of light I don't
[1:20:00] care how dark it is light will put it
[1:20:04] out
[1:20:05] you go in a room that's completely
[1:20:06] sealed off no windows no gaps in the
[1:20:09] doors nothing and it is so dark that you
[1:20:11] can feel it and you all you have to do
[1:20:13] is light a tiny little match
[1:20:15] and darkness disappears
[1:20:17] he says it's the same thing with God in
[1:20:19] your life it's the same thing with the
[1:20:20] presence of the Holy Spirit you put that
[1:20:22] in the room where that darkness is and
[1:20:23] it will go
[1:20:25] and you let it come in more and more and
[1:20:27] more until what that room is filled with
[1:20:28] light and there's no more Darkness
[1:20:31] and then you just got to keep the holy
[1:20:33] spirit in there
[1:20:34] that's the light you're looking for amen
[1:20:36] he says it can't stand Glory but you
[1:20:39] take as much Darkness as you want to he
[1:20:42] says try bring the the darkest thing in
[1:20:45] your life the the worst habit the worst
[1:20:47] traits the worst past whatever it is and
[1:20:50] try and stand it against light one time
[1:20:51] and see what happens that's the one
[1:20:54] that's in you is light and the one
[1:20:55] that's in the world is Darkness so the
[1:20:57] light has proved to overcome the
[1:20:59] darkness and the man that's in Christ
[1:21:01] and knows that he's over the come the
[1:21:03] things of the world Amen
[1:21:05] it has no more ties to you at all you're
[1:21:09] free he says walk in the light as he is
[1:21:11] in the light and the blood of Jesus
[1:21:13] Christ cleanses us from all sin and we
[1:21:15] have Fellowship one with another there
[1:21:18] you are he that's in you is greater than
[1:21:19] he that's in the world now if you look
[1:21:22] back and you're condemned then you're
[1:21:24] still in the world but if you're living
[1:21:26] above that then he that's in you has led
[1:21:28] you above the darkness
[1:21:31] what's the way of adoption look to who
[1:21:33] is in you rather than what what is
[1:21:36] surrounding you
[1:21:38] declare him that's in you as the real
[1:21:41] and declare everything else as darkness
[1:21:42] that has to flee before that light amen
[1:21:45] denial of what we're facing doesn't make
[1:21:46] us an overcomer
[1:21:48] if I sit here and say I don't have a
[1:21:49] temper and I've got a temper that
[1:21:50] doesn't make me an overcomer that's not
[1:21:52] Faith that's not the word of faith
[1:21:54] that's not speaking the word I don't
[1:21:55] have a temper I don't have a temper
[1:21:57] he says you can't say you're not sick if
[1:21:59] you're sick but he says what focus on
[1:22:02] the fact that it has already been
[1:22:03] overcome the price has been paid and
[1:22:05] there's something inside of you and
[1:22:06] that's the very Life of Christ that is
[1:22:08] already overcome it and he says dwell on
[1:22:10] that
[1:22:11] say cancer you can't stay where the holy
[1:22:14] spirit is
[1:22:16] lust you can't say where the holy spirit
[1:22:18] is that lying spirit that cheating
[1:22:21] Spirit whatever it might be you can't
[1:22:22] say we're the holy spirit because
[1:22:23] Darkness and Light can't be in the same
[1:22:25] room together it is impossible
[1:22:27] the definition of darkness is absence of
[1:22:30] light
[1:22:31] absence of light darkness is only
[1:22:33] defined by light
[1:22:35] and where light is Darkness cannot be
[1:22:37] it can't be there he says you've got to
[1:22:39] realize the same thing what is he saying
[1:22:41] he's saying Lord
[1:22:42] saying Lord keep me close to the light
[1:22:45] keep me close to the light and that'll
[1:22:47] take care of every situation I have in
[1:22:49] my life every single one
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:54] you want something practical
[1:22:56] let me give you an actual example an
[1:22:58] actual instruction that brother Branham
[1:22:59] had with a situation this is a question
[1:23:01] somebody said when someone gets on me or
[1:23:04] steps on my toes as the old saying is my
[1:23:06] temper Rises
[1:23:08] God forbid that somebody's temper rise
[1:23:10] when somebody steps on their toes
[1:23:13] listen to this how can I overcome this
[1:23:15] thing
[1:23:16] I know the Lord will have to do it but
[1:23:18] what can I do in my heart I don't want
[1:23:22] this thing
[1:23:27] sweeten your temper
[1:23:29] with prayer
[1:23:33] remember what we said read your Bible
[1:23:34] and pray
[1:23:35] don't just read your Bible you got to
[1:23:37] pray
[1:23:38] you got to talk to God about things he
[1:23:39] says sweeten your temper with prayer
[1:23:41] then make up your mind
[1:23:46] is this mind over matter no
[1:23:48] he says make up your mind what does he
[1:23:50] mean make up your mind that you truly
[1:23:52] don't want it
[1:23:53] and that you're expecting it to go away
[1:23:56] he says I don't guess he's going to talk
[1:23:58] about himself I don't guess there's too
[1:23:59] many people in this builder ever had any
[1:24:01] more of a temper than I did to begin
[1:24:02] with he says oh I had a mouth mashed all
[1:24:04] the time I took a lot of my meals out of
[1:24:06] a straw my mother as you know was a half
[1:24:08] Indian my father was an Irishman a
[1:24:10] Kentucky Irish at that both of them had
[1:24:12] enough temper to fight a buzz saw he
[1:24:14] says all the time my mouth was mashed it
[1:24:15] was beat up I was little to begin with
[1:24:18] and they just picked me up and knocked
[1:24:19] me down not as parents
[1:24:21] the kids at school and in his community
[1:24:23] he says I get up again they'd knock me
[1:24:25] down again until I was just got unable
[1:24:27] to get up anymore always and then when I
[1:24:30] got able to get up I got up again they
[1:24:32] knocked me down again that's just the
[1:24:34] way I had it I thought I can never be a
[1:24:37] Christian
[1:24:39] I can't be a Christian if I'm dealing
[1:24:41] with what I've got in my life now
[1:24:42] brother John listen to this he says but
[1:24:45] when the Holy Spirit came into my life
[1:24:48] that's done it he says no more
[1:24:51] what started the change
[1:24:54] prayer and a mind made up that he didn't
[1:24:58] want it in his life
[1:25:01] that's it that's what starts it
[1:25:04] but that's not what does it
[1:25:06] what did it was when the Holy Spirit
[1:25:07] came into his life and it removed that
[1:25:09] out of him
[1:25:10] you started with prayer you started with
[1:25:12] a desire you started with a confession
[1:25:14] you started by expressing your need and
[1:25:16] then you come to God and you say God I
[1:25:18] want to change I need a change I must
[1:25:21] have a change I'm desperate for a change
[1:25:24] and what does that do that loses the
[1:25:25] Holy Spirit to act on your confession of
[1:25:28] Faith by the word and that puts it into
[1:25:30] action and God will do it in your life
[1:25:31] like I talk about so many times about my
[1:25:33] mom and her makeup when she first came
[1:25:35] to the Lord she said I like my makeup
[1:25:38] and I know you don't want me to do it so
[1:25:40] you're gonna have to take it away and it
[1:25:41] took six months and then one day she
[1:25:42] realized she wasn't wearing makeup
[1:25:43] anymore
[1:25:44] but she had to say what she had to
[1:25:47] express her desire to be in line with
[1:25:49] the word of God
[1:25:50] that's the starting place
[1:25:52] the starting place is not to be perfect
[1:25:54] the starting place is to say God I want
[1:25:55] to be in alignment with your word and
[1:25:57] then say I need you to do the work and
[1:25:59] then it happens
[1:26:01] it's it just a simple honest confession
[1:26:03] of God of where you're at and where you
[1:26:05] need to be by his word that's what gets
[1:26:08] him moving
[1:26:12] another principle Jesus said unto him no
[1:26:15] man having put his hand to the plow and
[1:26:17] looking back is fit for the kingdom of
[1:26:19] God
[1:26:20] he says well Lot's wife did the same
[1:26:22] thing you know she set out to go with
[1:26:24] lot follow her husband or children or
[1:26:26] loved ones but it wasn't in her heart
[1:26:28] she still loved the world he says so
[1:26:30] it's possible you can make a start and
[1:26:32] still be the world in you see she never
[1:26:34] overcome and even though she was well on
[1:26:37] the road it finally overthrowed her she
[1:26:39] had to take that one big long last look
[1:26:42] and that's where she got caught he says
[1:26:45] don't even look back
[1:26:47] how do I get adopted how do I overcome
[1:26:49] brother John Don't Look Back
[1:26:52] for anything
[1:26:54] don't have no desires can I put it this
[1:26:57] way don't feed your desires
[1:27:00] don't feed it
[1:27:02] put it out of your life
[1:27:03] they say that that to beat any any habit
[1:27:06] and they talk about drugs and
[1:27:07] pornography and all these different
[1:27:09] things it takes 14 weeks of nothing to
[1:27:11] overcome it
[1:27:13] you got to starve it
[1:27:14] you got to starve it so what I'm saying
[1:27:16] is don't feed it there are things in
[1:27:18] your life there are characteristics in
[1:27:20] our lives attitudes whatever it might be
[1:27:22] we can't defeat it just by depriving it
[1:27:24] it's still got to be a work of the Holy
[1:27:25] Spirit but don't give it any food
[1:27:27] don't give it any food
[1:27:30] he says keep going put your mind on
[1:27:32] Calvary and keep moving towards Christ
[1:27:34] she started out as an overcomer but she
[1:27:37] never did overcome she overcame enough
[1:27:39] to leave
[1:27:40] but not to make it all the way to the
[1:27:42] end he says oh she left the denomination
[1:27:44] she did she walked out of solemn with
[1:27:46] lot but she wanted to go back and have
[1:27:48] her hair cut you know what I mean see
[1:27:50] she had to go back she couldn't just
[1:27:53] couldn't stand the test she had to look
[1:27:54] back again to see what the rest of them
[1:27:56] were doing oh you know I had some good
[1:27:59] friends down there after all and after
[1:28:00] all this might be just a little move I
[1:28:02] don't know whether it could be right or
[1:28:04] not I've only got this man's word for it
[1:28:05] and though he's my husband but yet
[1:28:09] what she didn't trust her headship
[1:28:11] he says then if you're not perfectly
[1:28:14] satisfied you're not perfectly knowing
[1:28:17] that it's the word of God then you can't
[1:28:19] go
[1:28:20] see you got to be really sold out you've
[1:28:23] got to know not just say well I see
[1:28:25] others doing it I see a sign he's saying
[1:28:27] you don't enter this walk because you
[1:28:29] see it in somebody else
[1:28:31] that's a draw but you got to be
[1:28:33] convinced you got to be sold out you got
[1:28:35] to be committed to this process
[1:28:38] when you walk you can't you can't look
[1:28:41] back because scripture says you can't
[1:28:43] come and taste and then turn back
[1:28:46] otherwise you crucify him a second time
[1:28:48] once you go you go
[1:28:50] that doesn't mean we don't backslide
[1:28:52] Prophet God said I backslide a thousand
[1:28:54] times a day he did
[1:28:57] What About Us
[1:28:59] there's Grace to cover that that's what
[1:29:00] the blood's for but he says don't look
[1:29:02] back don't dwell on what's back there
[1:29:03] don't feed what's back there
[1:29:05] amen
[1:29:08] what is it you've got to look at this as
[1:29:11] it's this way or no way
[1:29:14] you know what makes a marriage work
[1:29:16] is when divorce isn't an option
[1:29:19] when you say I'm in it regardless
[1:29:23] when I'm in it based on what I vowed
[1:29:26] when we take those vows at the marriage
[1:29:28] Altar and we say till death do us part
[1:29:30] in sickness and in health and in Joy and
[1:29:32] Pain and all these different things we
[1:29:33] ought to mean it
[1:29:35] and so if we say there is no other way
[1:29:37] except this marriage guess what
[1:29:39] magically the marriage will work
[1:29:41] because you're committed to it you don't
[1:29:43] accept anything other than the marriage
[1:29:44] working and it's the same thing with
[1:29:46] your relationship with God if you say
[1:29:48] it's the word and nothing else the word
[1:29:50] will work
[1:29:51] but the minute you say it's the word
[1:29:53] plus this or the word plus that or
[1:29:54] sometimes it's the word or sometimes
[1:29:55] it's not the word that's never going to
[1:29:57] work
[1:29:58] that's an adulterous relationship and
[1:30:00] that's what brother Brandon Will Blast
[1:30:02] this age for is that we would add things
[1:30:04] to the word of God and we take things
[1:30:05] out
[1:30:06] he says stick with it be committed to it
[1:30:08] don't look back to anything once you're
[1:30:11] on the road then don't go looking
[1:30:13] backwards amen
[1:30:15] sometimes it's longing for what you used
[1:30:17] to have even as Believers I've moved
[1:30:19] around a lot I've had places I lived
[1:30:22] that were easier than here in some ways
[1:30:23] and harder than here in some ways but if
[1:30:26] Satan can get a hold of me he'll get me
[1:30:27] focused on what is not here
[1:30:30] that is maybe a little more difficult or
[1:30:33] a lot more difficult and he'll
[1:30:34] completely get my eyes off what God is
[1:30:36] doing in my life right here and right
[1:30:37] now
[1:30:38] and what will it do it'll distract me
[1:30:39] and it'll get me looking back and that
[1:30:41] gives him an opportunity to jump in
[1:30:43] and all of a sudden I'm dissatisfied and
[1:30:45] I'm depressed and I'm unhappy with the
[1:30:48] people around me and the problem is and
[1:30:49] the people around me the problem is me
[1:30:50] that's the problem it's exactly the
[1:30:52] problem amen
[1:30:53] I've got to be able to live where I am
[1:30:55] now and I don't just mean physically I
[1:30:57] mean where I am in the situation I am
[1:30:59] now in the place God's put me in to
[1:31:01] trust that he's got me here for a reason
[1:31:06] the scripture in First Peter it says
[1:31:08] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:31:11] more precious than of gold that
[1:31:12] perisheth though it be tribe with fire
[1:31:15] might be found unto praise and honor and
[1:31:17] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:31:21] well the ram says this he says now we're
[1:31:22] expected to be tested
[1:31:24] that's a good lesson for my brother back
[1:31:26] there also he that cometh to God must
[1:31:29] first be tested tested with the word
[1:31:31] that's God's test that only shows a true
[1:31:34] child then see being tested you can't
[1:31:36] overcome and then unless there's a test
[1:31:39] give to you and when the test is given
[1:31:41] it's to see whether you can overcome or
[1:31:44] not
[1:31:45] we're talking about adoption and we're
[1:31:46] talking about the tests and the trials
[1:31:48] and the things that God puts us through
[1:31:50] he says you can't it's to see whether
[1:31:52] you can overcome or Not Jesus said to
[1:31:54] him that overcometh the test
[1:31:56] listen to this the test is the greatest
[1:31:59] thing that ever happened to you
[1:32:03] said no student ever after going through
[1:32:06] exam week
[1:32:08] but when you get the diploma at the end
[1:32:10] it was a great thing it proved who you
[1:32:12] were
[1:32:14] he says I believe it's written in the
[1:32:15] scripture Peter said that our trials are
[1:32:17] worth more to us than precious gold
[1:32:19] what's he saying he's saying we need to
[1:32:20] Value it not just endure it
[1:32:23] it's a mindset it's an attitude that
[1:32:25] he's talking about brother John how do I
[1:32:27] come to adoption do you have to
[1:32:29] understand what the trials are for and
[1:32:31] you have to Value the trials
[1:32:33] and that comes by understanding that
[1:32:35] comes by revelation of why God gives
[1:32:36] them to us in the first place listen we
[1:32:39] can't stop ourselves from feeling pain
[1:32:41] or hurt or these different things we go
[1:32:43] through that trials hurt tests exams we
[1:32:45] have sleepless nights and or lost sleep
[1:32:48] and and long days and your your brain is
[1:32:51] fried and guess what as a Believer it's
[1:32:52] no different we're beset on every side
[1:32:54] we're surrounded by a massive Army of
[1:32:57] 200 million demons that are trying to
[1:33:00] stop us from making it to the other side
[1:33:01] we're in a battle every single day and
[1:33:04] we've got to Value the battle
[1:33:06] rather than just endure it because we're
[1:33:09] going to come through it more as pure
[1:33:11] gold as as he would talk about amen we
[1:33:14] choose our attitude
[1:33:16] and we choose our atmosphere
[1:33:18] absolutely 100 that is a choice
[1:33:21] did you know we're the only creatures
[1:33:24] that can choose our attitude and our our
[1:33:26] atmosphere
[1:33:27] but you ever you ever see I think I've
[1:33:28] talked about this before and they let
[1:33:30] the little lion cubs in the zoo come out
[1:33:32] and uh and they attack the dad
[1:33:34] and if he's laying there sleeping and
[1:33:36] some kid comes and bites him on the rear
[1:33:38] end you know what he does he turns
[1:33:39] around with a big snarl and he swats him
[1:33:41] with the big paw why because he can't
[1:33:42] help it he can't help his attitude
[1:33:45] because he's a what he's an animal
[1:33:49] but we were different
[1:33:51] and we can what change our attitude
[1:33:53] based on simply a choice
[1:33:56] we can do that
[1:33:58] and what's he saying here he's saying
[1:33:59] what make a choice
[1:34:02] to Value the test
[1:34:05] he says it's testing time it's one good
[1:34:08] evidence of us that God is with us when
[1:34:10] we're tested for all children of God are
[1:34:13] tested and tried what's the principle
[1:34:15] understand and value that in order to be
[1:34:17] adopted you must first be tested
[1:34:21] the principle is to have the mindset
[1:34:23] that the testing of God is the proof of
[1:34:25] your heritage
[1:34:26] your purpose
[1:34:28] and that God has a plan for you in your
[1:34:29] life
[1:34:30] it's a completely different approach
[1:34:32] it's rather than a why me it's saying
[1:34:34] why me I know why
[1:34:37] because I'm a Child of God
[1:34:39] completely changes things
[1:34:41] but so often we stop and we're so caught
[1:34:44] up in the moment that we don't stop and
[1:34:46] say hold on a second there's a reason
[1:34:48] for this
[1:34:49] and that means God's doing something in
[1:34:51] my life as long as we've been staying
[1:34:52] with the word of God Amen it's God
[1:34:54] saying listen I've taught you Holy
[1:34:57] Spirit has taught you and now it's time
[1:34:58] to prove that you learned
[1:35:00] and if you if you can pass the test then
[1:35:02] you'll come into adoption you'll go on
[1:35:04] to the next level you'll go to to the to
[1:35:06] the next stage of your life and these
[1:35:07] different things
[1:35:09] but watch the requirement here
[1:35:11] James 4 10 says humble yourselves
[1:35:16] humble yourselves
[1:35:18] that means I do it
[1:35:21] for me and you do it for you
[1:35:23] it doesn't say I'm supposed to Humble
[1:35:25] Lydia says Lydia's supposed to Humble
[1:35:27] Lydia and John's supposed to Humble John
[1:35:30] humble your choice don't make God do it
[1:35:33] you do it willingly
[1:35:35] that's what we're looking for what in
[1:35:37] the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift
[1:35:39] you up is that a mental thing absolutely
[1:35:42] it starts in your mind because listen
[1:35:44] you won't exhibit Pride unless you think
[1:35:46] you're proud up here unless you're proud
[1:35:47] up here it's not going to come out of
[1:35:49] your life
[1:35:50] and in Romans Paul would say this for I
[1:35:52] say through the grace given unto me to
[1:35:55] every man that is among you not to think
[1:35:57] of himself more highly than he ought to
[1:35:59] think
[1:36:01] that's a mental thing
[1:36:02] that means I've got something I can do
[1:36:04] and that's to keep myself down so that
[1:36:07] God doesn't have to do it for me
[1:36:09] he says think soberly in other words
[1:36:12] don't get caught up don't get puffed up
[1:36:15] but literally really sit back and check
[1:36:17] up as the prophet of God was saying
[1:36:19] really take uh inventory of where you're
[1:36:21] at in life and say hmm
[1:36:24] maybe I'm not quite as good as I thought
[1:36:25] I was maybe there's room for improvement
[1:36:31] maybe there's room for improvement
[1:36:35] he says but to think soberly according
[1:36:37] as God had dealt to every man The
[1:36:40] Measure of Faith
[1:36:42] he says Jesus gave us the example of how
[1:36:44] to do it now we want to know how to
[1:36:46] overcome who wants to know how to
[1:36:48] overcome
[1:36:49] humility
[1:36:51] girded himself took a towel washed the
[1:36:53] disciples feed and wiped them the very
[1:36:55] God Of Heaven humiliated himself we
[1:36:58] don't want to be humiliated you know
[1:37:00] what what happens when we don't want to
[1:37:01] be humiliated is we do something
[1:37:03] unintentionally that is humiliating
[1:37:05] because it's God humbling us he's saying
[1:37:07] humble yourself intentionally and it
[1:37:09] won't be nearly as bad as when you're
[1:37:11] truly humiliated
[1:37:12] you choose he says that's the reason
[1:37:15] women don't want to grow their hair out
[1:37:16] see the reason they don't want to dress
[1:37:18] like ladies should dress like men don't
[1:37:20] want to see it's the same thing they
[1:37:21] don't they get humiliated but Jesus
[1:37:23] constantly
[1:37:26] look who he was greatness he said
[1:37:28] greatness humiliates itself greatness
[1:37:31] humbles itself
[1:37:33] he said I have I've had the privilege of
[1:37:36] getting and meeting some great men and
[1:37:38] it's these guys that got a change of
[1:37:39] clothes and 50 cents in their pocket to
[1:37:41] Rattle that's the guy that thinks he's
[1:37:43] something when he's nothing but I stood
[1:37:45] by great man I mean great men with
[1:37:47] ragged sleeves and cuffs they make you
[1:37:49] think you're the great person
[1:37:52] see greatness is humility don't forget
[1:37:54] that church greatness is expressed in
[1:37:56] humility not how fine you can be I don't
[1:37:59] mean dirty now I mean humble in spirit
[1:38:02] but I'm talking about humility genuine
[1:38:05] humility not something that's a put on
[1:38:07] you see somebody that's trying to make
[1:38:09] themselves look good
[1:38:10] look out
[1:38:12] because in God's school that doesn't fly
[1:38:15] right bolster show-offs that does not
[1:38:17] fly in God's School he'll humble you
[1:38:19] very quickly remember the scripture
[1:38:21] talks about says when you come to a
[1:38:22] feast don't go sit at the top don't go
[1:38:24] sit in the in the premium seats go sit
[1:38:27] low he says and then you'll be honored
[1:38:29] if they call you higher but he says
[1:38:31] you'll be embarrassed if you think that
[1:38:32] you're the best and then somebody says
[1:38:34] sorry there's somebody here that's of a
[1:38:36] higher caliber than you you're going to
[1:38:37] have to move down he says start low and
[1:38:39] get let God raise you up don't start
[1:38:41] high and let God lower you down
[1:38:44] think soberly about where you're at amen
[1:38:47] listen God will take us higher than we
[1:38:50] could ever go if we let him do it his
[1:38:52] way his time on a sure Foundation it's
[1:38:55] way more stable to let him build us up
[1:38:57] rather than ourselves I've said this
[1:38:59] before praying for humility is like
[1:39:01] praying for patience you won't like the
[1:39:03] process
[1:39:04] I recommend not praying for it myself
[1:39:08] I just don't
[1:39:10] but we need it
[1:39:12] so whether we pray for it or not he's
[1:39:14] going to do it
[1:39:15] but like I said my prayer is not Lord
[1:39:17] Make Me humble my prayers Lord keep me
[1:39:20] humble
[1:39:21] I'm trying to think soberly that I've
[1:39:24] got at least a little bit of it and say
[1:39:25] Lord keep me at least there don't let it
[1:39:27] don't let it puff up on me just keep me
[1:39:30] humble
[1:39:31] Lord help me not to think more of myself
[1:39:32] than I ought to let me tell you you want
[1:39:35] to get humbled start serving sometime
[1:39:38] that'll humble you
[1:39:40] that's what he did he says Jesus
[1:39:42] constantly humiliated himself constantly
[1:39:44] humbled himself
[1:39:47] he said Jesus told us how to do it he
[1:39:49] overcome he said overcome means to stand
[1:39:52] the test that's why we're talking about
[1:39:53] the way of adoption
[1:39:55] stand the test
[1:39:57] that's right like the old Saints did
[1:39:59] like Jesus did amidst all of his enemies
[1:40:01] he stood the test everything he was
[1:40:03] attested against he stood it in the very
[1:40:05] face of sickness and him being Messiah
[1:40:07] he healed them in the face of death he
[1:40:09] brought it back to life in the face of
[1:40:11] Calvary his own death he defeated it how
[1:40:13] by surrendering himself why by the word
[1:40:17] said you destroy this Temple and I'll
[1:40:19] raise it up in three days the word said
[1:40:21] so see and in the presence of death he
[1:40:23] defeated it he overcome death in the
[1:40:25] presence of hell he defeated hell and
[1:40:27] overcome hell yes even in the presence
[1:40:30] of the Grave he overcome the grave why
[1:40:32] all by the word and humility
[1:40:37] oh my there's the real man there's the
[1:40:40] one to make your example see he defeated
[1:40:42] everything he overcome it what's the
[1:40:45] principle he's saying he's saying take
[1:40:46] your cues from the word of God
[1:40:49] let the word put you into action not
[1:40:51] Pride
[1:40:52] not your big opinion of yourself but let
[1:40:54] the literal word of God let the Holy
[1:40:56] Spirit put you into action and do what
[1:40:58] the word says about you
[1:41:00] find your place in the word and then go
[1:41:02] and do that that's what Christ said
[1:41:04] Christ didn't walk around the the world
[1:41:06] and and doing all a bunch of things that
[1:41:07] he thought up on a whim just to prove he
[1:41:09] was the Christ what proved he was the
[1:41:11] Christ was he did what the word said he
[1:41:13] would do
[1:41:14] that's our principle to overcome that's
[1:41:16] our principle to be adopted is do what
[1:41:18] the Holy Spirit tells you to do do what
[1:41:20] the Holy Spirit quickens in the word to
[1:41:22] you that's how you're going to come to
[1:41:23] that place that that way you won't get
[1:41:25] drawn to the right and drawn to the left
[1:41:26] and got caught up in yourself and
[1:41:28] Ministries and gifts and all these
[1:41:29] things stay with what the word says
[1:41:31] about you
[1:41:32] we've had a message come to tell us what
[1:41:34] was most important for us listen we have
[1:41:37] the whole word we believe the whole word
[1:41:38] but there's things that we're supposed
[1:41:40] to be focused on and making a
[1:41:41] resurrection and the Rapture is one of
[1:41:43] them
[1:41:44] but overcoming is the thing that's going
[1:41:46] to take us there and that's going to
[1:41:47] come by focusing on what the word says
[1:41:49] about us and putting the rest of it
[1:41:51] aside not the rest of the word but
[1:41:52] putting everything else outside of that
[1:41:53] away from us we focus on those things we
[1:41:56] take our cues from what that end time
[1:41:58] messenger told us that was the spirit
[1:41:59] speaking to us
[1:42:01] scripture says the spirit says unto what
[1:42:04] the angel hear it hear it if you hear it
[1:42:07] do it
[1:42:08] stick with what he said because that's
[1:42:10] what's most important we can't go to
[1:42:11] Noah's age and know his message now
[1:42:13] we've got a message for this age and
[1:42:15] that's what we're focused on that's
[1:42:16] where we take our cues from that's why
[1:42:18] we needed a prophet was to take our cues
[1:42:20] from what he told us was most important
[1:42:22] because it was the Holy Spirit speaking
[1:42:24] to the church to the true bride
[1:42:27] he said overcome this is a very familiar
[1:42:29] quote overcome means to recognize the
[1:42:31] devil in every one of his tricks
[1:42:33] lots of people say there's no devil it's
[1:42:35] just a thought don't you believe it
[1:42:37] there's a real devil he's just as real
[1:42:39] as you are or anybody a real devil and
[1:42:42] you must recognize him as real you must
[1:42:44] know he's a devil but then at the same
[1:42:47] time that you recognize him and know
[1:42:48] that he's a devil and he's against you
[1:42:50] then to overcome
[1:42:53] you must recognize that the god in you
[1:42:56] is greater and mightier than he is and
[1:42:58] that the one that's in you that's why
[1:43:00] you have to have the new birth is
[1:43:01] because the Holy Spirit has to be in you
[1:43:03] has already already in the past done
[1:43:07] deal he has already overcome him and by
[1:43:11] his grace you
[1:43:13] by his grace you so it's him in you that
[1:43:17] makes you more than a match for him amen
[1:43:19] that's real overcoming when you
[1:43:21] recognize when you recognize the battle
[1:43:24] has already been won and all that we're
[1:43:26] in is a period of time to prove it
[1:43:29] all right brother brother Jason Watkins
[1:43:31] was talking about this idea and he says
[1:43:33] God is not in time everything is just in
[1:43:35] the here and now so he doesn't get
[1:43:37] worried when something pops up or flares
[1:43:38] up or goes sideways why because he's in
[1:43:40] the moment there is no rush
[1:43:43] God can stretch a second out to a
[1:43:45] thousand years and he can compress a
[1:43:47] thousand years to a second it doesn't
[1:43:49] get God worried so when we're in the
[1:43:52] battle the battle is already won because
[1:43:54] God is just in the moment everything for
[1:43:56] God is the here and now he is the I am
[1:43:58] and when the I am is in you it takes you
[1:44:00] out of this time issue and you see in
[1:44:03] God's eyes in God's presence in God's
[1:44:05] plan this is a finished work and so as
[1:44:07] soon as we recognize that we don't have
[1:44:09] to worry about the Battle it doesn't
[1:44:11] mean it's not hard it doesn't mean we
[1:44:12] feel pain don't feel pain it doesn't
[1:44:14] mean we don't get under the gun because
[1:44:16] we're in a body that feels those things
[1:44:18] but in our heart and in our soul we know
[1:44:20] the battle is finished and the outcome
[1:44:22] is guaranteed because we have to be an
[1:44:24] overcomer
[1:44:25] when you recognize that he says you'll
[1:44:27] be an overcomer
[1:44:30] listen life isn't a picnic it's a battle
[1:44:32] it's a battle every single day it's a
[1:44:35] battle in our homes it's a battle
[1:44:36] outside our homes because if we're not
[1:44:38] outside then we're inside fighting the
[1:44:39] internal part of us it's Satan on the
[1:44:42] outside trying to get in but then you
[1:44:43] come into your home and you still have
[1:44:45] to deal with your own flesh with your
[1:44:47] own nature your own traits at times and
[1:44:49] whatnot so it's a battle constantly for
[1:44:51] these things
[1:44:52] but the devil is real and he's
[1:44:54] constantly trying to throw things up in
[1:44:55] front of us to see how we'll react
[1:44:57] uh there's a quote
[1:45:00] that that the prophet said he says what
[1:45:02] the devil does is he tries to get you to
[1:45:04] a place where you don't know what to do
[1:45:07] and so you do nothing
[1:45:09] but there's something you can always do
[1:45:12] you can always cry Abba Father
[1:45:14] and you can always go to the word for
[1:45:16] your cue
[1:45:17] and you start reading that like that
[1:45:18] thing with sister Burns where Satan
[1:45:20] talked to her for two hours and finally
[1:45:22] what he did was he hit bedrock and she
[1:45:24] said you talked to me for two hours and
[1:45:26] now I'm going to talk to you and she
[1:45:27] started testifying back to the devil and
[1:45:29] pretty soon he was gone
[1:45:30] sometimes all we need to do is testify
[1:45:33] it'll do us good Moses had a book of
[1:45:35] remembrance for the children of Israel
[1:45:36] sometimes we need to go back in our what
[1:45:39] I do in my devotion book and I have my
[1:45:40] prayer list in there is I have a list
[1:45:43] a book of remembrance
[1:45:44] of the things God has done for me for my
[1:45:47] family and for the people in this church
[1:45:48] and the people outside of it that I
[1:45:50] prayed for that many others are praying
[1:45:52] for as well go read that for a while
[1:45:54] when you're feeling depressed when you
[1:45:55] think that things aren't going well and
[1:45:57] nothing's moving start reading from your
[1:45:58] testimony Book for a while and it'll
[1:46:00] perk you up and you'll say greater is he
[1:46:01] that's in me than he that's in the world
[1:46:03] because he did it last time and he'll do
[1:46:04] it again if he did it for them he'll do
[1:46:06] it for me
[1:46:07] amen
[1:46:09] he said he showed us how it's done how
[1:46:11] did he do it by the word that's how he
[1:46:13] done it for he was the word
[1:46:16] and Jesus said if you abide in me and my
[1:46:18] words in you you're back to the word
[1:46:20] again the Word of Promise what is the
[1:46:22] Word of Promise to every Christian
[1:46:24] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:46:26] that's in the world then how do I
[1:46:27] overcome he says not me but the word
[1:46:30] that's in me catch what he's saying you
[1:46:32] overcome by what you are
[1:46:35] so if you are the word you'll overcome
[1:46:37] by the word but if you're intellectual
[1:46:39] you'll try and overcome by your
[1:46:41] intellectuality and guess what it won't
[1:46:42] work and if you're emotional you're
[1:46:45] trying and overcome by getting yourself
[1:46:47] worked up and by giving yourself a pep
[1:46:48] talk and that won't work either you've
[1:46:51] got to come to the word because the word
[1:46:52] is what has the overcoming power the
[1:46:55] life of the word is what's going to take
[1:46:56] us through on these things he says what
[1:46:58] the word is God
[1:47:00] he says then I overcome the things of
[1:47:03] the world because it's the word in me
[1:47:07] if you abide in me my words in you then
[1:47:09] just ask what you will just keep
[1:47:11] pressing up like The Lily you're coming
[1:47:13] up to the top as sure as anything see
[1:47:15] you've got to come to the top what does
[1:47:18] that mean Church it means we've got to
[1:47:20] be reading what the word says about us
[1:47:22] we've got to be reading what the word
[1:47:23] says about our day about the Overcomer
[1:47:26] for this day about the True Believer all
[1:47:28] of it and say that's for me
[1:47:31] and I'm going to keep pressing I'm going
[1:47:32] to keep believing I'm going to keep
[1:47:34] holding to that we've got to feed an
[1:47:36] overcoming spirit
[1:47:38] brother Brown would say the Holy Spirit
[1:47:39] feeds on one thing only
[1:47:41] one thing only the word of God
[1:47:45] if you're not feeding on the word of God
[1:47:46] personally and privately you're going to
[1:47:49] starve and you're not going to overcome
[1:47:51] you've got to have it in your life daily
[1:47:53] constantly amen
[1:47:57] the scripture says in Revelation it says
[1:47:59] they overcame what or how
[1:48:01] by the blood of the Lamb we read the
[1:48:03] quote earlier where he says they're all
[1:48:04] under the shed blood
[1:48:05] but they get overcame by the blood of
[1:48:07] the lamb and
[1:48:09] the word
[1:48:10] of their testimony
[1:48:12] that means you've got a testimony and
[1:48:14] it's got to be word based and you got to
[1:48:16] be talking about it and you got to know
[1:48:17] it and you got to know that it's for you
[1:48:20] we ought to know our bibles inside and
[1:48:23] out
[1:48:24] up and down so that the first thing that
[1:48:26] comes to our mind in a situation is thus
[1:48:29] saith the Lord
[1:48:30] it is written it is written it is
[1:48:33] written and you can put the right Spirit
[1:48:35] behind it you can put the right attitude
[1:48:36] behind it you can cut through every
[1:48:38] situation and come to Clarity by simply
[1:48:40] saying it is written
[1:48:42] it is written it is written it is
[1:48:44] written amen that's overcoming
[1:48:46] revelation
[1:48:47] overcoming Revelation is when you can
[1:48:49] place yourself in the word and say
[1:48:50] that's for me
[1:48:52] not just for me that is me that is me
[1:48:55] and it becomes a part of you and that's
[1:48:57] what's going to overcome in our lives
[1:48:59] amen
[1:49:01] getting down to some brass taxes we
[1:49:03] start to close he says but seek ye first
[1:49:05] the kingdom of God
[1:49:08] he didn't say you can't seek anything
[1:49:09] else
[1:49:11] he says seek ye first
[1:49:13] but you know he never says seeks
[1:49:15] anything second
[1:49:16] because you don't need to
[1:49:18] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[1:49:20] righteousness and all of these things
[1:49:22] shall be added to you everything
[1:49:26] you need will be added to you if you put
[1:49:28] God first that you have need of Paul
[1:49:31] said I've never seen the righteous
[1:49:32] forsaken nor his seed begging bread
[1:49:35] never
[1:49:37] every need supplied we sing that song
[1:49:40] every needs supplied
[1:49:42] seek the kingdom of God first and he'll
[1:49:44] add everything else to you
[1:49:46] but Graham says just remember you're
[1:49:48] living for God you have one objective
[1:49:51] and that's Jesus Christ
[1:49:54] what is it we are his written epistle
[1:49:56] seen and right of all men that's our one
[1:49:58] objective
[1:49:59] there's that song do they see Jesus in
[1:50:01] me do they recognize his face
[1:50:06] do people see Christ in US
[1:50:09] he says outside of that there's nothing
[1:50:11] else counts that's him
[1:50:14] so first it's Christ then he says
[1:50:16] secondly for your family then thirdly
[1:50:18] for yourself but first for God next for
[1:50:21] your family next for you you're number
[1:50:23] three he says that's the end of the road
[1:50:25] put yourself last he did
[1:50:30] first John says love not the world nor
[1:50:32] the things that are in the world if any
[1:50:34] man love the world the love of the
[1:50:36] father is not in him
[1:50:37] but I would say that this is the major
[1:50:40] sin of our days it's the major sin among
[1:50:42] our people worldliness as the Bible said
[1:50:45] the laodicea age was she's worldly Rich
[1:50:48] have need of nothing don't know that
[1:50:49] she's naked miserable wretched and blind
[1:50:51] that's the sin of our day when you hear
[1:50:54] the word of God call out against it then
[1:50:56] you take the other root he says you're
[1:50:58] unpopular with this world
[1:51:00] anybody been unpopular in what they
[1:51:02] believe lately
[1:51:03] they don't like it at work
[1:51:05] most of them
[1:51:07] they don't like it at work what we
[1:51:08] believe they don't like that testimony
[1:51:10] but some do
[1:51:12] there's some that are interested but
[1:51:14] most of them will say you're crazy
[1:51:15] you're this phobic you're that phobic
[1:51:18] you're this you know and they'll call
[1:51:19] you nut they'll call you crazy they'll
[1:51:21] call you uh hate mongering whatever it
[1:51:23] might be
[1:51:25] he says that's the sin of our day he
[1:51:27] says you take that other route with the
[1:51:29] word you're unpopular with the world
[1:51:30] you're tempted to go back I know
[1:51:33] prophet of God is saying this church
[1:51:35] this is 1963 after the seals you keep
[1:51:37] saying to me I know you're saying this
[1:51:40] is all the time I know you get tired of
[1:51:42] me harping on these things
[1:51:45] are you tired of Brother John harping on
[1:51:47] these things yet
[1:51:48] he says I get tired of seeing you do it
[1:51:50] too
[1:51:51] that's right this sin that I'm trying to
[1:51:53] tell you about say what are you harping
[1:51:55] on it for stop doing it then I'm trying
[1:51:57] to save your life by the word I get
[1:52:00] tired also so just straighten up this is
[1:52:02] a sin it shouldn't be done yes sir what
[1:52:06] is worldliness
[1:52:08] it could be anything that is outside the
[1:52:10] word of God anything that would get
[1:52:12] between you and your relationship with
[1:52:13] Christ is going to be of the world
[1:52:16] because if it comes through comes
[1:52:18] through the love of Christ then it means
[1:52:19] that the love of Christ can't be there
[1:52:21] something's gotten in there's a wedge
[1:52:22] that's been driven in amen I was talking
[1:52:24] to my wife about this last night and I
[1:52:26] pointed out that the prophet of God he'd
[1:52:28] go through and he preached some of the
[1:52:29] most amazing deep
[1:52:32] revelatory fantastic sermons
[1:52:35] and he'd tell us who we are and he'd
[1:52:37] tell us where the bride of Christ and
[1:52:38] he'd tell us what we're in for and all
[1:52:40] these good things and then you know what
[1:52:41] he'd finish with
[1:52:43] where are you at in your life
[1:52:45] every single time it seems like he'd
[1:52:48] bring it back to
[1:52:49] ladies what are you doing with your
[1:52:51] dress
[1:52:51] what are you doing with your hair
[1:52:53] Brothers what kind of music are you
[1:52:55] listening to are you still smoking your
[1:52:56] cigars are you still going to car
[1:52:57] parties are you doing this and that and
[1:52:58] the other he'd bring it down to where we
[1:53:00] lived because what he was saying you
[1:53:02] live where you truly believe
[1:53:05] you'd say elsewhere if you really
[1:53:06] believed it you'd live it
[1:53:07] and what was he saying he's saying
[1:53:09] you're sitting here and you're listening
[1:53:10] to the preaching of the word and you're
[1:53:11] nodding your head and you're saying yes
[1:53:12] okay I believe it I understand in all
[1:53:14] these things and then he'd say but
[1:53:15] where's your life at
[1:53:17] remember the quote we read earlier he
[1:53:18] says how do I know when I'm in it he
[1:53:19] says look at your life
[1:53:21] didn't say look at your revelation
[1:53:23] he said look at your life
[1:53:25] that's where the that's where the proof
[1:53:27] is because the fruit is how we're known
[1:53:28] by these things
[1:53:30] what was he saying and he'd say it he
[1:53:32] says you can't keep you can't preach you
[1:53:35] can't teach algebra to somebody that
[1:53:37] doesn't understand their ABCs
[1:53:39] can't do it he says if your life isn't
[1:53:42] where it needs to be then why am I going
[1:53:43] to go any further you can't go any
[1:53:45] further until your life catches up
[1:53:47] you can't walk in Supernatural for power
[1:53:49] for others if it's not first manifested
[1:53:52] in your life
[1:53:53] the first Victory God's looking for is
[1:53:55] right here in me
[1:53:56] not me for you me for me this is the
[1:54:00] first thing self has to die first self
[1:54:02] has to be conquered first in these
[1:54:04] things if we want signs and wonders
[1:54:05] surrender our life
[1:54:08] we want great Revelation and the
[1:54:09] mysteries of the word
[1:54:11] surrender our life
[1:54:12] we want tongues and Gifts operating
[1:54:14] surrender our life
[1:54:16] that's it all we are are vessels
[1:54:19] and all he's looking for is a clean
[1:54:22] willing vessel
[1:54:24] that he can use at any time in any way
[1:54:28] we don't earn it
[1:54:30] but we can sanctify Our Lives to be
[1:54:32] ready for it and that's a choice we make
[1:54:34] every single day
[1:54:35] amen like I said relationships not built
[1:54:38] twice a week at church it's not going to
[1:54:39] do it
[1:54:40] I want to finish with three tests
[1:54:42] brother Brown talks about
[1:54:43] and we don't all face these some of us
[1:54:46] face it because of the positions we're
[1:54:47] in or even our gender in many cases but
[1:54:49] God is allowing us to to deal with these
[1:54:52] Satan will bring them our way but God
[1:54:54] allows them and it's part of our
[1:54:55] adoption test to see what we're going to
[1:54:56] do
[1:54:58] remember you've got to recognize the
[1:55:00] test is a test
[1:55:01] otherwise you won't pass it you've got
[1:55:03] to recognize that the test is a test and
[1:55:05] it's there for a purpose and you're in
[1:55:07] the hot seat now and your answer is
[1:55:08] going to determine whether you move
[1:55:09] forward or whether you stay and go
[1:55:11] another round in that course
[1:55:13] he said the first thing that Satan did
[1:55:15] was he made his attack upon us his
[1:55:17] attack upon was to use his great power
[1:55:19] he's talked about Satan tempting Jesus
[1:55:21] which he knew he was the word he knew
[1:55:24] his position this is Christ you believe
[1:55:25] he did he says I the son of man he knew
[1:55:27] his position and Satan come and wanted
[1:55:30] him to use his own power on himself to
[1:55:32] feed him and to want to feed himself he
[1:55:35] was hungry a man gets hungry he can do
[1:55:37] almost anything he'll steal Rob beg
[1:55:39] borrow anything see he had that appetite
[1:55:42] and Satan uses used his first great
[1:55:45] major assault upon him to take his power
[1:55:47] that he had been given to overcome with
[1:55:49] and use it on himself
[1:55:52] maybe I could say it and use it for
[1:55:54] himself
[1:55:55] he said he didn't use it on himself no
[1:55:58] he used it on others that's right he
[1:56:00] used it on others not himself it wasn't
[1:56:02] for him though he could have done it he
[1:56:05] certainly could have done it but see how
[1:56:06] the devil gets the devil wants you to
[1:56:08] mind him but he minded only what the
[1:56:12] father said to do a minister is a
[1:56:14] servant
[1:56:15] and we're not talking just five full
[1:56:16] ministry but each and every one of us
[1:56:18] has a position in the body and we are
[1:56:20] ministering servants
[1:56:21] that's what we do so whether it's
[1:56:23] brother Josh up here song leading or
[1:56:25] brother Bob or sister Maureen and
[1:56:26] brother Joe and brother Dave brother
[1:56:28] Paul rather playing the the instruments
[1:56:30] or whether it's the gift of helps that
[1:56:32] we have here or trustees and deacons or
[1:56:34] the minister itself all of those things
[1:56:36] the idea is that this is not for them
[1:56:38] it's for those that are in the body of
[1:56:40] Christ
[1:56:41] so guess what I get a benefit from being
[1:56:44] a pastor
[1:56:45] I get a benefit from being in the
[1:56:48] presence of God I get a benefit from
[1:56:49] being used of God it's gratifying when
[1:56:51] it works when it's good it's gratifying
[1:56:54] it's not that I don't get a benefit but
[1:56:55] I can't be up here for that
[1:56:57] I can't be up here for its gratification
[1:56:59] to me I have to be up here for your sake
[1:57:02] otherwise it taints the ministry that's
[1:57:04] coming over and it'll get me proud and
[1:57:05] it'll take the humility right out of my
[1:57:07] life and that'll take the power of God
[1:57:08] completely out of my life when I do that
[1:57:11] our first benefit is always to others
[1:57:13] like I said the first victory that
[1:57:15] you'll see for an adopted son of God is
[1:57:17] over himself
[1:57:18] that's the first thing God does is he
[1:57:20] brings you to a place of full surrender
[1:57:22] how do you overcome brother Brown said
[1:57:24] living for others you're looking heaven
[1:57:26] in the face something along those lines
[1:57:28] eternal life is living for others
[1:57:30] you want to be adopted start living for
[1:57:32] others don't just live for yourself
[1:57:35] he said the next great assault that he
[1:57:37] made upon him was that he would be a
[1:57:39] show-off
[1:57:40] and how that does hit God's servants to
[1:57:42] be a show-off to show what you can do
[1:57:44] glory to God hallelujah I'm a deliverer
[1:57:46] I'm so he's talking like Moses see come
[1:57:49] up here on top of the temple and sit
[1:57:51] down here he tempted him to do it now
[1:57:53] repent remember he was tempted to do it
[1:57:55] hard
[1:57:58] said now if you'll want to be something
[1:58:00] before the people stand up here on this
[1:58:01] Temple and jump off fulfill the word
[1:58:04] see I'll give you a scripture for for it
[1:58:07] because it's written he give the Angels
[1:58:09] charge over thee lest any time you dash
[1:58:12] a foot against the stone he barely up
[1:58:14] what was his temptation you produce the
[1:58:16] word the word says this come on produce
[1:58:19] it come on produce it come on produce it
[1:58:22] Jesus never did it on command
[1:58:24] remember the Jews wanted to sign or the
[1:58:26] Greeks wanted to sign in these different
[1:58:27] things and they said do this and do that
[1:58:29] they tried to tell them what to do he
[1:58:30] said no
[1:58:31] I can only do what the father tells me
[1:58:33] to do that's what the True Believer is
[1:58:35] the holy spirit is our lead our guide
[1:58:37] and our unction and we do not perform
[1:58:39] like trained monkeys because somebody
[1:58:40] says I believe you're a Christian if you
[1:58:43] will
[1:58:44] they tell that to brother Branham go
[1:58:45] heal this one go do that and I'll heal
[1:58:47] it he wouldn't do it
[1:58:49] because that wasn't in the proof that's
[1:58:51] not the proof the proof is what he
[1:58:52] obeyed the spirit of God
[1:58:54] and God would back him up every single
[1:58:56] time as long as he was led that way and
[1:58:59] he had to learn that he had to learn
[1:59:00] that if you remember if you read read
[1:59:02] his life story he talks about he says I
[1:59:03] started using that and I started using
[1:59:05] it as a as a
[1:59:07] as a challenge to the people rather than
[1:59:09] following the leadership of God
[1:59:11] and the angel rebuked him and rebuked
[1:59:14] him and then finally he couldn't get an
[1:59:15] answer to prayer and he had to go back
[1:59:16] and realize what it was about he had to
[1:59:18] ask forgiveness for those things
[1:59:21] he says to make him a show-off to show
[1:59:23] his authority no true servant of God
[1:59:26] ever does that
[1:59:29] you see a man showing off his chest out
[1:59:31] and all like that just remember there is
[1:59:34] something wrong there
[1:59:37] if all we do is talk about ourselves
[1:59:40] we ain't a child of God
[1:59:42] scripture says in me dwelleth no good
[1:59:44] thing
[1:59:45] everything I have is by grace
[1:59:48] God don't want that Jesus set the
[1:59:50] example he could have done it he
[1:59:51] certainly could have done it but he
[1:59:52] didn't do it no servant of God is a
[1:59:55] show-off of himself to try to take God's
[1:59:57] power and show himself above somebody
[2:00:00] else
[2:00:01] no true servant ever tries to show
[2:00:03] himself off with God's power if he does
[2:00:06] he loses
[2:00:07] right then I was talking about this and
[2:00:09] I'll share this it's maybe personal but
[2:00:11] I was talking to a brother this week and
[2:00:13] I said you know when I when I came to
[2:00:15] the ministry and I started looking
[2:00:17] around and you start to see the gifts
[2:00:18] that are that are among the ministers
[2:00:20] and and whether it's the gift of how
[2:00:22] they deliver and the Dynamics of those
[2:00:24] sorts of things whether you see it's a
[2:00:25] gift of Visions or dreams or discernment
[2:00:27] or all of these things uh altar calls
[2:00:29] and Gifts of Faith and Healing and all
[2:00:31] that and I looked at so many of those
[2:00:33] things and I looked at that and I I
[2:00:35] wanted to be like them
[2:00:37] if you're going to be a minister you
[2:00:38] want to be like the best right
[2:00:40] but I had to come to a place where I
[2:00:42] said Lord
[2:00:43] I'm not them
[2:00:45] I had to come to a revelation I'm not
[2:00:47] them
[2:00:48] brother vaishal I'm not you and you're
[2:00:50] not me you can't be me and I can't be
[2:00:52] you and you can't take me a place and I
[2:00:54] can't take yours and you can't try and
[2:00:55] be like me because it won't work because
[2:00:57] you're you
[2:00:58] and I said to the Lord I said Lord I am
[2:01:00] what I am and I'm not what I'm not
[2:01:04] and so all I can do is be what I am
[2:01:07] so whether I have a stilted delivery
[2:01:09] whether I'm dry whether I'm funny
[2:01:11] whether I'm Dynamic whether I'm shouting
[2:01:13] whether I'm crying whether I'm just
[2:01:14] talking normally it doesn't matter Lord
[2:01:16] I'm gonna be what you've made me and you
[2:01:19] add to me as you want to and you take
[2:01:21] away as you want to you grow as you want
[2:01:24] to but all I can do is be who I am right
[2:01:26] now right here that's the only way it'll
[2:01:28] work because otherwise what I'm trying
[2:01:30] to show off I'm trying to put something
[2:01:33] on that doesn't belong to me it's like a
[2:01:35] a crow putting on the the feathers of a
[2:01:37] peacock
[2:01:39] oh it's so pretty yeah it looks so
[2:01:41] beautiful maybe but it doesn't work
[2:01:43] doesn't work you can't do anything with
[2:01:45] them you can't flare them the way a
[2:01:46] peacock does and all it does is keep
[2:01:47] them from flying and being a crow
[2:01:49] that's for me and that's for you we've
[2:01:51] got to be who we are we've got to be who
[2:01:53] God made us and when we stay there and
[2:01:55] we stop trying to be what everybody else
[2:01:57] is that's when we can come into adoption
[2:02:00] because now we're stepping into his plan
[2:02:02] his purpose his way his thoughts His
[2:02:05] image
[2:02:07] and we find our place and all of a
[2:02:09] sudden it just starts to work
[2:02:09] beautifully and we can relax because it
[2:02:12] becomes natural to us a crow can't
[2:02:14] naturally be a peacock
[2:02:16] and guess what I can't be brother Ron
[2:02:18] Spencer
[2:02:19] as much as I would like to be
[2:02:22] I can't be a Shelton preacher like Joe
[2:02:24] Adams
[2:02:25] I can't be that
[2:02:27] I can have a gift of discernment like
[2:02:28] some of these brothers at least not
[2:02:30] knowingly why because God hasn't given
[2:02:33] that to me
[2:02:34] yet maybe who knows but I've got to
[2:02:37] preach where I'm at and I said Lord I'll
[2:02:38] preach where I'm at and if you can use
[2:02:40] that then I'm all yours
[2:02:42] but I can't try and do a put on
[2:02:44] I can't do a put on that's not going to
[2:02:45] work
[2:02:47] what is it if we get to trying to prove
[2:02:48] ourselves by somebody else's metric we
[2:02:51] fail right then
[2:02:52] God's got our checklist God's got our
[2:02:54] image and we're supposed to grow into
[2:02:56] that and leave everyone else behind
[2:02:58] let them grow let God work with them
[2:03:02] he says Satan offered this is the third
[2:03:05] assault Satan offered to Forfeit this
[2:03:07] Kingdom to him Satan said see these
[2:03:09] kingdoms of the world they're mine I do
[2:03:11] with them whatever I want to I'll
[2:03:13] forfeit them to you but you remember he
[2:03:15] was trying to get him to Forfeit it
[2:03:17] without the cross if he did we'd be lost
[2:03:21] he could have took the kingdom listen to
[2:03:23] this
[2:03:24] he was tempted to take his Liberty
[2:03:31] and be the king of the earth without the
[2:03:32] cross but if he did his subjects would
[2:03:35] have died Satan would have gladly made
[2:03:37] that proposition with him but he said
[2:03:39] get behind me Satan he didn't do it he
[2:03:42] come and suffered and took the hard
[2:03:45] rugged route he took the route of
[2:03:47] persecution he took the route of death
[2:03:49] are we this morning willing to do and
[2:03:51] take that same route that he took
[2:03:54] are we willing to die
[2:03:56] not physically necessarily but are we
[2:03:59] willing to die to our choice
[2:04:00] to our Liberty
[2:04:03] are we willing to give ourselves up to
[2:04:05] God and forfeit all the world and the
[2:04:07] things to serve him see
[2:04:10] though Jesus was tempted he overcome for
[2:04:13] us he endured all Temptations for me and
[2:04:16] for you see he could have took it right
[2:04:18] then but what did he take the other
[2:04:20] route for so that we could come and be
[2:04:23] with him
[2:04:24] and if he paid such a price as that then
[2:04:27] how little will we be not to take it
[2:04:29] when remember there's nothing here
[2:04:31] anyhow if you live a hundred years what
[2:04:33] are you going to come to mental your
[2:04:35] mind gone all crippled up and old and
[2:04:37] shaky that's where you're going and
[2:04:38] that's the end of it he says you come
[2:04:40] now overcome the thing how do you do it
[2:04:44] by the word what the word says you do it
[2:04:47] walk humble live before Jesus
[2:04:52] what's the principle here how do I come
[2:04:54] to adoption dismiss your personal
[2:04:57] Liberty
[2:04:58] Paul said use not your what use not
[2:05:01] Grace for an occasion to sin
[2:05:04] sin is not always well doing something
[2:05:06] that you're not supposed to do sin is
[2:05:08] often not doing what you're supposed to
[2:05:09] do
[2:05:11] to know to do it and not do it is
[2:05:12] Iniquity
[2:05:14] amen
[2:05:15] you've got a liberty that Liberty is
[2:05:17] your personal choice
[2:05:19] and you can choose to do what God wants
[2:05:21] you to do
[2:05:22] or you can choose not to
[2:05:24] and all that does is it makes you a
[2:05:25] hindrance if you choose not to doesn't
[2:05:27] change your sonship
[2:05:29] doesn't make you a not a daughter of God
[2:05:31] but it makes you a hindrance rather than
[2:05:33] a help in these things
[2:05:36] he says how do you do it stay with what
[2:05:37] the word says and guess what there's no
[2:05:39] parades for people that stay with what
[2:05:41] the word says down here they don't like
[2:05:43] us down here
[2:05:44] there's no Fanfare there's no trumpets
[2:05:46] there's no there's no you know big big
[2:05:49] news events for for those of us that
[2:05:51] follow the word of God except to dismiss
[2:05:52] us and make fun of us and no doubt put
[2:05:54] us down because they do it
[2:05:56] but he says if you'll choose that route
[2:05:58] you'll take your Liberty your choice and
[2:06:00] put it aside and say I'll take the way
[2:06:02] with the Lord's righteous View
[2:06:05] that's how you overcome you got to pick
[2:06:07] the Hard Road you have to pick the Hard
[2:06:10] Road
[2:06:11] that's how you overcome
[2:06:14] tell you what there is though there's a
[2:06:15] crown waiting for us
[2:06:17] and there's a place in his throne just
[2:06:18] for you and just for me if we overcome
[2:06:21] last two quotes
[2:06:23] he says
[2:06:25] as he caught them who looked for that so
[2:06:28] will he come to each New Testament Saint
[2:06:30] that's overcome every denominational
[2:06:31] critic who has ever overcome all the
[2:06:34] popular sins of this day of this age
[2:06:37] that we live in now like he did in all
[2:06:39] the other Church ages those who overcome
[2:06:41] in that church age those who overcome
[2:06:43] what I am rich I have need of nothing oh
[2:06:48] I'm all this and all this and I'm the
[2:06:51] bride
[2:06:53] what's he saying he's saying saying it
[2:06:56] doesn't make it
[2:06:57] saying on the bride there's lots of
[2:06:59] people saying we're the bride of Christ
[2:07:00] why because it's written in the
[2:07:01] scriptures he's saying they're saying
[2:07:03] I'm the bride I'm the bride
[2:07:05] what is it that's making them say it
[2:07:07] they're saying it because of what they
[2:07:09] have he says the true bride says it
[2:07:11] because of who they have
[2:07:13] it's a person it's not stuff it's not
[2:07:15] ideas it's not gifts it's the person of
[2:07:18] Christ that makes her the bride what is
[2:07:20] it she's saying I have someone not
[2:07:22] something and I have become that someone
[2:07:25] and that's what makes me the bride I'm
[2:07:28] this I have need of nothing and don't
[2:07:30] know that you are naked and blind see
[2:07:32] that deceiving age that I said it's not
[2:07:34] like them that had their heads cut off
[2:07:35] back Yonder to get the white stone not
[2:07:37] like those who died under martyrdoms and
[2:07:39] burnt with stakes and things like that
[2:07:40] who won the crown so he said back in
[2:07:42] those days it was easy
[2:07:44] easy to know because they died they died
[2:07:46] they had their heads chopped off Mothers
[2:07:48] had their children torn away they were
[2:07:49] fed to lions and all these different
[2:07:51] things it was easy to know who had the
[2:07:52] real deal he says no it's very deceptive
[2:07:54] in this age because everybody's saying
[2:07:56] I've got it
[2:07:57] I've got it
[2:07:59] he says but it's this deceiving age now
[2:08:01] that they that think that they're
[2:08:03] everything
[2:08:04] well I'm a church member I'm a good man
[2:08:06] I'm a good woman I do this I don't have
[2:08:07] to do this
[2:08:09] he says I do this their own thing but I
[2:08:12] don't have to do capital T this I don't
[2:08:14] have to do what the full word says but
[2:08:17] he that overcometh he that overcomes all
[2:08:19] those worldly things of this age what
[2:08:21] will they do all will sit with him in
[2:08:24] his throne and will go in the Rapture
[2:08:26] when he comes oh my what do I care then
[2:08:30] what should we care what the world says
[2:08:32] what should we care about what anybody
[2:08:34] else says the great holy spirit is Among
[2:08:36] Us his Pillar of Fire leads us and
[2:08:39] guides us his word is Vindicated before
[2:08:41] us his love is in our heart the world is
[2:08:44] in the back we pass from Death unto life
[2:08:47] the world thinks you're crazy
[2:08:50] amen God bless you let's stand
[2:08:55] amen
[2:08:57] hopefully that was a help
[2:09:00] you know we we can preach the higher
[2:09:03] things and we can preach the lofty
[2:09:04] things and we we preach about what's
[2:09:06] coming but there's a path to get us
[2:09:08] there and God has always provided a way
[2:09:10] God Is Not An unjust God If he if he has
[2:09:13] that requirement we said he gives us a
[2:09:15] way to get there amen and that's what
[2:09:17] I've just shown you tonight is the way
[2:09:19] to get there it's a way of humility
[2:09:21] it's a way of surrender it's a way of
[2:09:24] trust it's a way of a constant
[2:09:26] relationship with God it's a feeding on
[2:09:28] the word it's a prayer life
[2:09:31] it's a humbling yourself
[2:09:33] it's a crying out to God it's a seeking
[2:09:35] it's an expectation it's a confession
[2:09:37] it's a testimony all these things are
[2:09:40] what are going to get you to a place of
[2:09:42] adoption
[2:09:42] it's not just going to be any one of
[2:09:44] them they all work together they're all
[2:09:46] built on that concept of what hearing
[2:09:48] and believing and accepting the word of
[2:09:50] God and letting it come out of your life
[2:09:51] but it comes out in so many different
[2:09:53] ways and sometimes all that's missing is
[2:09:55] that one little piece
[2:09:57] sometimes we just need to Humble
[2:09:59] ourselves
[2:10:00] like he said there this is the age that
[2:10:03] think they're everything
[2:10:06] I believe I'm everything he said I am
[2:10:09] by faith
[2:10:10] but I also know I'm not there yet
[2:10:13] and that's what keeps me humble and
[2:10:14] that's what keeps us seeking and that's
[2:10:15] what keeps me praying and that's what
[2:10:17] keeps me working and that's what keeps
[2:10:18] me pushing and that's what keeps me
[2:10:20] fighting is I know there's more for me
[2:10:22] amen but he's going to get me there
[2:10:25] he's already promised there's an
[2:10:27] overcomer and I believe I'm an overcomer
[2:10:28] I believe you're an overcomer tonight
[2:10:32] but don't don't don't don't seek the
[2:10:34] lofty things and Miss just the
[2:10:36] Simplicity of what we talked about here
[2:10:38] tonight there's nothing here that you
[2:10:40] can make a decision to do
[2:10:42] Deliverance is not a view it's of him
[2:10:44] provision is not a view it's of him
[2:10:47] faith is not a view of it's of him but
[2:10:49] what you do have is you have a decision
[2:10:50] that's yours by free moral agency
[2:10:53] you have a decision and you have a mouth
[2:10:55] to speak
[2:10:57] and you've got a word to read
[2:10:59] and those three things will take you
[2:11:00] through if you'll do them the way he
[2:11:02] told you to use them it's that simple
[2:11:05] it's that simple
[2:11:06] you know brother Mark and I were talking
[2:11:08] about the the the the series brother
[2:11:10] Jason Watkins did on the token and after
[2:11:12] months and months of preaching and study
[2:11:14] he came back to one thing
[2:11:16] Acts 2 38 repent be baptized in the name
[2:11:20] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[2:11:21] sins and you shall receive the Holy
[2:11:22] Ghost and if you get the Holy Ghost
[2:11:24] you're going in a rapture
[2:11:26] that's it
[2:11:27] you young people if you don't have the
[2:11:29] holy ghost seek the Holy Ghost that's
[2:11:30] what's going to make the difference
[2:11:32] baptism is great confessing your sins
[2:11:34] repenting that's wonderful that's what
[2:11:36] the word says but you now have to seek
[2:11:38] the Holy Ghost because that's what's
[2:11:39] going to give you overcoming power
[2:11:40] that's what's going to make the world
[2:11:41] have no effect that's what's going to
[2:11:43] take us adults into the workplace and
[2:11:45] into school and into these different
[2:11:46] things and we can walk in there and be
[2:11:48] untainted by the world and be a true
[2:11:50] Witness A True Light for this gospel
[2:11:52] amen but it's only by the new birth it's
[2:11:55] the only way it comes
[2:11:57] come to church we want you to be in the
[2:11:58] right atmosphere we want you to be in
[2:12:00] the right things but get the Holy Ghost
[2:12:01] that is the greatest thing that we've
[2:12:03] got to seek in all of this amen that's
[2:12:05] overcoming power is the Holy Ghost In
[2:12:07] You
[2:12:08] the very life of God Amen let's bow our
[2:12:10] heads each one Heavenly Father
[2:12:15] Lord help us not to complicate things

[2:13:04] the hearing of a Ministry of the word
