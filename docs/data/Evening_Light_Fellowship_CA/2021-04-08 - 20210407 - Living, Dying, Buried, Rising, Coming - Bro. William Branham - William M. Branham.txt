okay if not we'll have the audio part for sure so uh apologies to those that are outside that uh may not be able to see it but they will at least hear it right amen may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word i want to take for this occasion this morning five words and around those five words try to express what's on my heart to you worshipers this morning i want these five words living dying buried rising coming and i think the poet well expressed it in the song of what i want to say when he wrote this song living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh glorious day thank god there never was a life ever lived like his because he was the god manifested in the flesh when he was born he was the expression of what god the father is and god the father being loved then jesus was a full expression of love he was loved from the very first time that his little baby hand stroked the pretty cheeks of his mother he was loved and i think today that that's where manny is failing to recognize that he was love god is love and they that love are born of god god so loved the world that is the unlovable that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but would have everlasting life he expressed his love when he was here on earth in so many different ways till it is undisputable that he was the most loving creature that ever lived now think in his life here he was expressing god in the only way that god can be expressed to the people is through love and well did he do this when he caught one of the most violence women nectar was of his days perhaps they found her just guilty and no way out when she was found in adultery and they drug her up before him and said what do you say do for her and when he turned to her and said i don't condemn thee going sin no more [Music] instead of being throwing her out to the streets to be drug out like a bunch of wolves or her to stone her and take her life his tender kind naughty heart stoop way down into the sin that she was in [Music] said i don't condemn me just go and don't sin no more and when he was on his way down to the grave of lazarus i think there's another great time that he expressed what god is to the human beings not only is he a god that can forgive the lord's sin that can be committed and take the guilty and make them guiltless by his party love but after death has laid us in silence he's still concerned about us i think he will express that on the road down with martha and mary when he come to the house work death and shut out the life of a lovely person and always roll down to the grave yet being god know that he would raise him from the dead know that it had been told him then in his very words laid the power to raise him from the grave amen yet when he seen martha and mary and those who loved lazarus crying the bible said he wept what was it his great loving heart when he seen that man and his his friends were in trouble he was troubled with them i'm so glad to know that he can be found amongst the brokenhearted praise god in our sorrows he's not one that would leave us he stands by us when all has failed and the last hopes of earthly reaching has come to its end he's still gone and loves us he was the expression of god know how i believe that he longs for his people to be so anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials and in troubles and give the expression of his sympathy as it pours from our hearts that's been burned off his spirit to reflect in the church the love of the living god that will express what he said or the poet said living he loved me he showed what he did to the whole human race the way god represented himself in jesus christ amen he expressed his opinion to the human race to forgive and to love those who were unlovable and i wonder on this easter morning how short we fall apart we can love those who love us but he loved those who did not love him he was the greatest of representation of love that ever hit the earth and it was despised of those who lived on the earth to whom he loved no man could ever love like him and no man was ever hated like him they hated him and despised him and rejected him but it did not stop his love the last one he was hanging on the cross after that life that he had lived had been done nothing but good things forgiving the guilty healing the sick and just things that were good but it was less breaths on the cross with the fire mocking spit of them who stood by hanging from his sacred face he cried with a heart full of love power forgiveness amen for they know not what they do he could understand being god he understands that's why he can love us when we're unlovable because he's god and he understands amen lady he loved me never life lived like it because it was wrapped in love dying he saved me a death when in the garden of eden god jehovah required the penalty our sin is death and there could be no alterations it could not be any other way taken care of because god is supreme and he is infinite and the judge of all heavens and earth the penalty of sin is death and there was no one who could pay this penalty for another for every man though he might die for another man but he was guilty to begin with amen there was none of us that could help the other because we were all guilty we are born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and there was not a real hope nowhere we were condemned to death by god and every creature that ever moved on the earth was under this condemnation there could be righteous man rise and do great things but he was a sinner to begin with there was only one way for it to be paid that was the death of god himself so god being a spirit could not die but he came down in a body of flesh and expressed himself and a life of love to take all that goodness that he wants amen and give it willingly as a supreme sacrifice that he might take the guilt of the guilty [Music] all of us being sinners and not a way in the world for us to ever be saved he came not only to be seen on earth but he came to die as a sacrifice abel expressed it when he offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain when he brought the little lamb with a piece of grapevine wrapped around his neck to a rock there laid the little fella up on the rock pulled his little chin back in with a rock pounding its little throat and it bleeding and died at the blood is squirting out this little white locks become bathed with blood they will express calvary there when the lamb of god slain from the foundation of the world came to take the place of guilty sinners and was mashed and bruised and and made fun of and died of death that no creature could die except god himself and his bloody locks hanging from his shoulders dripping to the ground express what a horrible thing that sin is when he had to die to redeem man from a life of sin nothing could die like that nothing could stand that death it said that when they pierced his side that there came forth blood and water it's been some time ago i was speaking to someone about this and it was a scientist that said there's only one way that that could have happened and it was not because of the roman spear that he died and neither was it the loss of blood that he died because there was still blood in his body what he died of was not because of the roman spear or the nails that was drove in his hand or the foreign crown they placed on his head but because he died of grief because he came to his home it is unreceived enough he died of a broken heart when he knows the very creatures of time that he had done to redeem had spent his face and he was rejected of man david 800 years before it happened cried the very voice that he cried in calvary my god has now forsaken me what a terrible thing that sin does it separates man from god he was a sin offering that had to be offered for our sins and he was separated from the presence of god sin and separating god placed our sins upon him and he was separated from god and that's why he cried why has thou forsaken me and because he was forsaken and have taken this place and seen his people that he would come to be their savior and to offer them life they had rejected him and he grieved him so though he was so brokenhearted in terms of blood and water the chemicals of his body separated man will never know what that was that's the reason there could be no one else could ever die like that i don't care how much that you could be tormented how that they might put your feet in stocks or saw you by inches or burn you by inches you could not die that death because your makeup's not like that he had to be god he had to be more than man and the faith that god died he died of a broken heart with such grief for the world until a chemical reaction taken place in his body that could not take place in you you cannot suffer like that there's no way for you to have that kind of a grief so there's only one could do it and he did it they're hanging that precious life that knows nothing but love doing good come there between the heavens and the earth lifted up there stripped naked embarrassed think how you'd be stripping naked you were no embarrassment to what god wanted hanging there i know the crucifix has a little thing like they had something around him but they never did that that's just put on the crosser the artist put it there they stripped his clothes from him he had on a rope and they tore off of him and gambled fart he wasn't back to the utmost yet me and god had to stand and sinners spit on these faces yet being the very depths of modesty had to die before the public spit naked such a fact that tuck up on him until it separated the water and the blood no wonder i think the point well expressed it when he said mid-rendering rocks and darkening sky my savior bout is hidden god but the opening they'll reveal the way to heaven's joys and endless days sure you had to do it the veil hung between man and god and that opening veil revealed the way the heavens joyous and endless day cowardly means something means more than we can express sure living he loved me dying he saved me and buried he carried my sins far away it's been condemned now sin has no more hope when he screamed at the cross it's finished sin died that's dead it's done with it's powerless it's lifeless think of it people that send the enemy to human being says damn life is it has no more effect it can't one of the sun shut off its vision the stars will not shine the earth turned black is all being redeemed now it's dead it's buried it's lifeless it has no more life then it must be buried what was buried the body of god was buried for it was a sin offering amen it was a burnt lamb it was buried by the fires of iniquity that sinless lamb that know no sin that god who know no wrong his life has been given and down to set off for you buried he carried my sins far away he must be buried the body the sin offering must be buried that's why many after a while will walk one by one to this pool amen to be baptized in the name of jesus christ why something has taken place that spirit that came out of that body when he screamed his finish has condemned sin in our bodies and we must bury it to be remembered no more i'm so glad that it is when anything it's hid it's out of sight and very he carried my sins far away god can see our sins no more for they are buried there buried were in the sea of forgetfulness think of a sea of forgetfulness god cannot remember them no more because they are both dead and buried amen they cannot be remembered no more they're out of god's memory he was also in this very he represented in the old testament they had two they had a sin offering at the cleansing of the sanctuary and that sin offering was that they've taken two goats and one goat was killed and the other goat had the sins that was placed upon the dead goat put up on the live goat remember jesus was a sheep he was a lamb but in this case he become a goat he was righteousness because he was god the sheep but it become a goat's sin that he might be the sin offering for me in you from a sheep to a goat jesus is representing both the animals both goats for one he died he died for the atonement the second the sins from the atonement was put on the scapegoat and the scapegoat took the sins of the people and went far into the wilderness to bear the sins of the people what was it it was the death and the burial of our lord jesus dying living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away he took the sins of the people upon himself and carried them plumbed down into the lords of hades he was a sin offering he had the sins of the people he died for them and also the sins is placed upon him and he took our sins far away so far that god can never see him no more thank god that oh the church can scream hallelujah for such a savior amen not only is our sins forgiven but they are buried in the same forgetfulness to be remembered no more buried he carried our sins far away no more can they be remembered or they are gone they're out of the eyes of god they are past they're divorced they're put away god don't remember him no more but the church ought to rejoice this morning to know that our sins will no more be remembered they are put in the sea of forgiveness into the grave of beyond any resurrection they are dead forever and forgotten about they are if they had never happened amen dying he saved me but buried he carried my sins far away he carried them so far until they went into the sea of forgiveness oh we know that those things are most surely believed among us and they're most surely the truth they're god's truth all those great things were beyond human expressions we could never express our gratitude for such thing but oh that easter rising he justified freely forever living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away and was all right but rising he justified what was that raising up it was god's receipt that the bill's been paid why isn't he justified freely forever oh what a savior rising what a goddamn a man can suffer a man can die a man can be buried but easter was the greatest of them all for it was god's endorsement amen my laws has been met my requirements has been met that's him rolls him up from the dead i think he just came out freely forever [Music] amen let it be his holy name hallelujah no wonder it brings emotions no wonder the human heart cannot contain because he died and was buried and god raised him up again on easter morning amen yes then god showed that it was accepted all the things that he did everything's [Music] that great day when he rose up with the angels in the heavens and hands the angels sang the praises of god and rejoice with the old testament saints in power [Music] [Applause] [Music] this oh when we look at that amazing grace yonder what he did see god sealed endorsement a little while in the world will see me no more yet you see me for all raise from the dead be with you even in you to the end of the world as a confirmation and a verification that what god said is true and what i say is true jesus said i'll come in the form of the holy spirit i will make my bold with you and live with you forever then the saints who has that resurrection hope in their heart can save this song [Music] bright and countless morning when the dead in christ shall rise and the glory of his resurrection share amen when his chosen one shall gather to their home beyond the sky with the perfect assurance with the with the red receipt from god himself when the royal is called a ponder i'll be there he loved me dying he saved me married he carried my sins far away hallelujah rising he justified freely forever sins are pardoned all these sacrifices could have been mythical all these sacrifices could have failed but on easter morning when he rose up that he accepted it make some people call those things which we're not as though they were justified how you always raise because he's risen in our hearts justified freely forever forty days later when he was standing talking to his children gravitation began to lose its hope the works was finished the penalty was paid he had the receipt in his hand it was god's receipt amen he had the children the church the believers oh sin was conquered the path was made clear he kept sailing earth no more what holds us here gravitation gravitation began to break it lost his scripts why it's all over then what happened you begin to rise from the earth go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature come forth the uttering of his sins go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out evil spirits they shall speak with new tongues if they should take up serpents or drink daily things it shall not come on them amen if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover because i live gravitations broke away from me sit out i died for you god prove it and give the resurrection receipt amen and because i live you live also someday i will return sunday is coming oh glorious day and one living dying buried rising coming the hope of the church today amen living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh glorious day what was it five things and five letters j-e-s-u-s leaving he love

mornings when the dead in christ shall rise and glory all that resurrection amen when his chosen one shall gather to their homes beyond the sky when the roll is called up gander i'll be there wow got the receipt he rose how do you know he lives in my heart who lives in the heart of his believing father of it friends the pool will be ready just in a few moments with warm water for the baptismal service as soon as we return let us bow our heads yesterday i wonder today if there be one in armpits your many who has not yet appreciated this sacrifice enough to accept it and you would like to be remembered in prayer that god will speak strangely to your heart that you will accept the sacrifice the cleansing of your soul and remember that today we celebrate just not a time to wear new hats and to wear new clothes which is all right it's a symbol of something new god did something new which is all right it's not only that easter doesn't mean that or hunting easter rabbits or bunny eggs and little white chickens and so forth that isn't the happy brother easter is a triumph it's the victory that god give over the earth that he raised his own son from the dead and whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have eternal life the resurrection can be in your own life if you haven't got it would you raise your hand to him this morning while you have your heads god said by this god remember me that that resurrection life may it be had in my heart will you raise your hands and say pray for me brother brown as i raise my hand the lord bless you god bless you is there enough to raise your hand say pray for me brother i want to accept this resurrection life [Music] is now if you're not sure make it right now let us labor for the master from the new saints now you that are christians wants to make a vow to god to labor more the coming year raise your hand [Music] oh dear god you've seen every heart in here and you know the emoties and the objectives yes i pray for mercy god granted that mercy shall be shown to these people they have come this morning for this hour of worship they've come to to this place to hear thy words and as we have spoken that when you live there was never a life like yours dying you were the only one who could die in that manner when you was buried you carried our sins far away having the sins of the people upon you you took them to the sea forgetfulness but rising you're justified freely forever and we stand today waiting for your coming god bless them help us we realize we don't have much more time or it's just at the door at any and one hour from now according to the scientists the nations could be no more and we pray god as we stand this easter morning upon the threshold of his coming the hope of the church many thousands are laying out in the dust of the earth waiting for that hour their souls are in the altar crying how long lord how long i pray god that you'll speak to us and let us remember that no matter what we ever do here on earth it's so little and the only thing that we can do now is wait for your coming and tell everyone the message is urgent may we get it to the people quickly that you may come at any time before these bombs that they're speaking of in these missiles that can be showers of thousands of them feel the earth in one minute's time before that happens you promise to come lord get your people it'll be that way lord so most any minute there could be a resurrection or easter for the church a resurrection from this sinful life unto the life eternal through christ hear our prayers and today as we go on into other services into the sunday school teaching oh lord speak again i made many hearts be strangely warned and may they come by the dozens into this pool this morning this easter morning to be buried with the lord jesus accepting his sacrifice no matter what church they belong to or what religious sect they they have fellowship with that means nothing but how they accepted that sacrifice [Music] are they confessing that they're not no good that jesus was the only good one and he died for us and they are still and he took our sins and buried him and we stand alone in him our churches cannot bury our sins our own life cannot bury our sins but christ buried our sins in the sea of forgiveness god grant them that these things will be glorious in our sight then tonight lord may you come in the power of your resurrection and shake this little place like it has never been shaken may signs and wonders appear repeat it like it was a couple sundays ago long when i'm sick and afflicted was so marvelously heated we pray that it'll be again the night for your glory forgive us of our trespasses now lord it may this be a real easter for some of us a real easter for all of us and some of those who have never known what the easter blessings was may it be today that christ rises in their heart with a new hope with a new life them to calvary for we ask that in jesus name amen and then god bless you i mean that was good that's uh it's my second time going through it today i was asked to come up and just say a few words and kind of you know do a bit of a summary of what we just heard and i don't want to re-preach the sermon but just kind of hit a couple of the high points we've only been here 40 minutes and we don't like church to be short so we're going to lengthen it out a little bit tonight amen i'm just going to read a few quotes here i've got four pages 12 minutes 15 minutes tops and and i'll be done so brother brown said him and well did he do this when he caught one of the most vilest women that was there his day perhaps they found her just guilty scripture says that they found her in the very act there's no denying it there was no you know he said she said they caught her in the very act there was no way out when she was found in adultery and they drug her up a form and said what do you say do for her and when he turned to her and said i don't condemn thee go and sin no more instead of throwing her out to the streets to be drug out like a bunch of wolves over her to stone her and take her life his tender kind loving heart stooped way down into the sin she was in and said i don't condemn thee just go and sin no more now people look at that and and you'll you'll get um you know nominal christians or even worldly people will go to that story and they'll say that's the way you're supposed to act when you see people caught in sin and whatnot because what they think is that jesus made an exception for that woman and he didn't he was the word and he was bound by the word and so he knew that if her accusers numbered two or three she was going to be stoned he was not a witness to what she did though i'm sure he believed that she did it and being who he was maybe he knew maybe he knew exactly what she did but the the the the the condemnation for her was conditional on there being two or three witnesses and so what did he do he didn't answer her and he didn't answer them he just said he who was is without sin cast the first stone what did he do he dispersed the witnesses and then he asked her he says where are your accusers is there no man here to condemn you and she said none he said neither do i go your way but he said sin no more right he could use the word for mercy and as long as there's mercy then god will use it for as long as it's available god will use it for that and he was there to bring mercy right he didn't come for the ones that were saved he said i came to find the lost it was a place of repentance it was a time of redemption and he wasn't there to judge at that time amen so he dispersed the witnesses and he said but don't do it again and if you listen to the world today they'll just say just say it's okay it's okay it's okay but they never catch the part where he says don't do it again right amen it's a tremendous thing he's the word he couldn't deny the word and as if they stayed there he would have had to say moses law says under two or three witnesses she has to be stoned but with those witnesses gone it gave him the freedom to say here's mercy go your way i won't condemn you there's no one else here to do it and so you're free to go amen he said oh how i believe that he longs for his people to just be so anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials and in troubles and give the expression of his sympathy as it pours from our hearts that's been borne of his spirit to reflect in the church the love of the living god you know he just throws in this little bit here about what it is to be in unity in a body and what it means to be a part of a body and that's when one part is hurting when one part is struggling when one part is weak what does the body do it sends all of its available resources to help build up to help heal to help bolster that one little thing and whether it's your little pinky or whether it's you know your heart you know a big organ or just a little tiny thing if something's hurting the whole body knows about it and the whole body is sending whatever they can do to help that thing out amen and that's the way we ought to be he says is that what be the expression of god's sympathy what as it pours from our hearts it's been borne of a spirit you can't help a believer unless you've got the holy spirit yourself truly help them oh you can bring them a meal and you can pat them on the back and you can give them a hug but they may need a word in due season amen and that's what the spirit's there is to give you that unction it may be to sit there silently and listen and it may be to give a correction it may be to give a suggestion but we're looking for the junction of the holy spirit to pour out of us and not just sympathy right not just sympathy as in oh that's so bad right we don't want to keep people where they are but we want to be able to lift them out of it he's talking about about jesus and the separation he had to endure he said what a terrible thing that sin does it separates man from god and he was a sin offering that had to be offered for our sins and he was separated from the presence of god sin had separated him god placed our sins upon him and he was separated from god and that's why he cried why hast thou forsaken me and because he was forsaken and had taken this place and seen his people that they had was come to be their savior and to offer them life they rejected him and it grieved him so till he was so brokenhearted that the blood and the water and the chemicals of his body separated i don't want to drive too deep in this because it was already in my notes for the next service whenever you know the next service i take but i want you to catch there that he says he was separated from god okay when we look at jesus that was the fullness of the godhead bodily and the holy spirit dwelt in him but when he went on the cross that was no longer in him he died a man he had to face this as a man he did not have all the power and all of the understanding of god with him when he went to that cross he did that as if you or i went up there as well in the same strength and the same knowledge the same understanding the same capacity that we would have that's what he went there with he didn't have superhuman strength to do this what he did have though was he had a special body that was built just for this kind of suffering and to take the kind of pain and to endure the damage that they did to him without dying before he made it to the cross because we'd have died before we made it to the cross right he was literally built to suffer and die he had a special body made that sinless body up to that point was made so that it could endure everything that they threw at him and still make it to the cross without dying that way amen but remember he was made sin and god cannot dwell in sin so god had to separate himself from that body and he had to walk that road completely alone completely alone and this is one that up until that point knew nothing about separation from god and then he has to walk up without that anymore and he's got to go through a new experience this is a whole new way of being for jesus because he's had that spirit on him he's known who he was from from a youth and all of a sudden he knows who he is but he doesn't have anything there to confirm it inside of him and he is literally walking purely on the understanding that he's built up through 33 and a half years that's all he's got and the commitment to the cross and the and the path that's before him that's the only thing getting them through he doesn't have supernatural strength he doesn't have angels hovering over him or anything like that he's doing it as a man as you or i would amen literally he went he would have been into sensory overload because this was one that was holy and righteous and in one fell moment he went to filthy and sinful and he'd never known what that felt like and you know what it's like if you do something wrong now take that and magnify it by the billions and billions of things that have happened in this world and that was all dropped on him from a state of perfection to a state of absolute rejection sinfulness filth whatever you can think of in one moment and boom that would kill us that would kill us and yet he's walking the road to calvary and he's going through all these things why because he had to go that way that was his plan that was the purpose of god was to do that amen but the brahm says he had to be god and he had to be more more than man and to think that god died he died of a broken heart with such grief for the world until a chemical reaction took place in his body that could not take place in you you cannot suffer like that there's no way for you to have that kind of grief there's only one could do it and that's him he could do it amen we couldn't have handled that suffering that's what brother bam saying there's this is a man that handled suffering that we could never handle and it was a requirement for him to do it and he stayed with it and he stayed with it and he stayed with it he held on to life until he gave it up on that cross amen i talked before about that rabbi remember i said that he looked at isaiah 53 and he said that israel that's that's that's a description of israel paying for their own sins but you can't pay for your own sins if you're sinful it's a it's it's amazing to me that he would think that that his eyes are so blinded and it shows how blinded the jews are right now is because it's not their time to receive that messiah but they look at that scripture and think that their suffering is what is described in isaiah 53 and it was an atonement for sin and their very law says that you can't do it if you're guilty that's what brother i'm saying is you can't handle this you couldn't have done this you can never justify yourself you can never redeem yourself it had to be a sinless one and this was the man that did it amen but when it's all done he said sin has no more hold when he screamed at the cross it's finished sin died i never heard him say it that way he says sin died now it's dead it's done with it's powerless it's lifeless think of it people that sin the enemy to human beings is dead and lifeless it has no more effect it can't no wonder the sun shut off its vision the stars would not shine the earth turned black it was all being redeemed that's incredible he says sin died it has no effect on you anymore that's why paul could sing what say what death where's your sting grace where's your victory because it all died right there the effect of satan was made null and void when that blood was shed and his life was given up and god accepted that as a price paid fully accepted paid him full there's nothing left to do amen and now christ is walking around he's got those two keys in his hand and there's nothing that satan can do about it he's never going to get him back and that means that he can't do it to you either that when you die you don't die you just go to another place and you have that eternal life amen completely bound amen he said god can see our sins no more for they are buried they're buried where in the sea of forgetfulness think of a sea of forgetfulness god cannot remember them no more because they are both dead and buried it cannot even be remembered no more they're out of god's memory he said the church ought to rejoice this morning to know that our sins will no more be remembered they're put in the sea of forgetfulness into a grave beyond any resurrection we look for a resurrection in a rapture he says this is one thing that you cannot resurrect it is impossible to resurrect your sins your mistakes your faults your failures the things you should have done that you didn't the things you did that you shouldn't he says that can never be resurrected and when you bring them up you're the one that's fishing in the sea of god's forgetfulness amen so if he won't remember then why should we be walking around remembering them why should we be bound by our conscience amen when we have committed them to him when we've confessed our sins when we've made we've we've done the fruits right meat for repentance we've gone the other way we've stopped doing that then there's nothing that satan can hold over us anymore amen amen what do you say they're not just dead they're buried and that makes satan a liar because if god can't remember it it didn't happen right he's the great recorder he's the great filmmaker he's the one that determines what is and isn't a reality it meant so when satan comes up there's nothing to there's nothing to back him up there's no film tape left of this it's all destroyed like i said brother branham went from justification means it's as if you never did it to he said you didn't do it that's the effect of the blood it's not as if you didn't do it he says you did not do it because you are in christ you are perfect you are sinless you are spotless so you couldn't have even done it in the first place amen he says what was that raising up it was god's receipt that the bill's been paid rising he justified freely forever oh what a savior rising what had god done a man can suffer a man can die a man can be buried but easter was the greatest of them all for it was god's endorsement my laws has been met my requirements been met and that's him he says that's the requirement in front of you it's not some thing it's a person he says that's my requirement and it's jesus christ he rose up from the dead he said rising he justified freely forever blessed be his holy name amen christ rising from the dead victorious with the keys of hell and death in his hand and he is the living receipt that he was accepted and the price was paid fully amen amen brother bram said sins are pardoned all these sacrifices could have been mythical all these sacrifices could have failed but on easter morning when he rose god proved that he accepted it no wonder it brings the human heart to a hallelujah no wonder it makes men stand in the face of death you don't face death on just anything willingly you know when you put men in war in that and they'll they'll stand up and and the adrenaline will get going and they'll find a certain ability to do but when you put people up there and you put their kids in front of a of certain death and these different things like they did in the first church age you don't just do that amen without what a reality that's there in your life and that's what he's talking about is when you have christ that's what's going to make you stand in the face of death he says it makes the people call those things which were not as though they were why because the price has been paid and there's nothing to hold you back remember we talked about that store and brother brown says everything that's in it is yours just go walking around just go looking in it just go reading it because everything you see is yours and you can go up and claim it because the price has been paid for every single one of those things amen he says how do you know he has raised he says cuz he's risen in our hearts justified freely forever amen that's why we call the holy spirit our token why because it's the very token life of christ it's the very same life that rose from the dead and now we have it within us amen we carry our receipt with us every day if you have the baptism of the holy spirit in your soul if you are sealed to the day of your redemption you have the receipt with you every day every minute every hour doesn't matter what happens when satan comes in you can just pull that up and you say i've got the token i've got the proof i've got the receipt that says that i didn't do anything and no matter what you say no matter what you do no matter how hard you press i am sinless and spotless and there's nothing you can ever do to change that amen at the end he's talking about jesus rising he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature come forth the uttering of his lips go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out evil spirits they shall speak with new tongues if they should take up serpents or drink deadly things it will not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover because i live he says gravitation is broke away from me sin had no hold i died for you god proved it and gave the resurrection receipt and because i live you live also someday i will return he says that's not just a token that the price was paid he says that holy spirit that's in you is your resurrection and your rapture receipt right that's proof that you're going in it he says the life that you live now because of christ in you he says that's the very proof that you're going to go in that resurrection and that rapture amen he says i've got the receipt he rose how do you know he lives in my heart he lives in the heart of his believing church he said easter is a triumph it's the victory that god gave over the earth and then they sing the role was called up yonder you know that role couldn't be called until that lamb had died and rose again because when you look in revelation what what is the one that takes the book right it's a sealed book the roll couldn't be read it was sealed but then a bloody lamb came out as it had been slain and they said worthy is the lamb and he took the book out of him that held it and then we see in the next chapter the next time we see him that book is open and he starts calling out the names of that amen the role was called up yonder then how do you know it was called because i'm here and you're here right he started calling the names out of those different church ages he started calling brother mark out of what nowhere brother brother mark was just walking around and all of a sudden what happened the role called out mark coffey and all of a sudden something happened inside of him and now you see here at church because god called one man out of it out of so many people here so randomly almost you know what was it the role was being called by what the bloody lamb the slain lamb that now had the right to take that title deed to the earth and go back and claim his possession amen what a tremendous message 40 minutes 40 minutes i wish i could preach like that in 40 minutes wow amen let's just stand together if we would and then he started he talked about he says there's no wonder that you can sing hallelujah do we know that song you asked me why i'm happy so i'll just tell you why my sins are gone let's sing that and then we'll we'll turn it over to brother bob to to close out the service amen i don't i don't know the verses off the top i don't know if we have it why i'm happy so i'll just tell you why because my sins are gone my sins are gone there underneath the blood of the cross of calvary as far removed as darkness is from god in the sea of god's forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise god my sins are gone it was at the old time altar where god came in my heart and now my sins are gone [Music] [Applause] as darkness is from dawn in the

that's good enough for me hallelujah my sins are gone [Applause] [Music] [Applause] god's forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise god my sins are gone amen praise the lord amen that's that's good enough isn't it that's good enough for us and deceive god's forgetfulness the only thing god can forget isn't it the fact that we've sinned and it's now under the blood and he's cleansed us the devil can't bring it up again beautiful amen 12 38 up there and he's really paid for us he's paid the highway to heaven so we're going to sing that [Music] why don't we sing the chorus first we'll try
