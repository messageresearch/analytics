[41:33] do a thing amen but we know a God that
[41:35] can change situations that can heal his
[41:37] body and that's that's what I'm here for
[41:40] amen that's what we're here for is to
[41:41] pray for him and trust God to do the
[41:43] work amen I also spoke with brother
[41:47] Carmen Mills so I'll be heading out to
[41:49] Vancouver for work on January 20th
[41:51] returning Lord willing January 26 so
[41:53] that's a Sunday and a Wednesday I'll be
[41:55] gone and I wasn't sure what to do or who
[41:58] to talk to for the Sunday service and
[41:59] then brother Carmen Mills texted me and
[42:01] I'd talk to him about coming to minister
[42:03] and he said hey I've sold my house
[42:05] that's closed so we're getting ready for
[42:07] the big house building project next
[42:09] summer but until then I'm free I've got
[42:11] some and he told me he was going to be
[42:13] traveling down to South America and then
[42:15] also the US so he said I'm free January
[42:18] or I'm free March so I said January 21st
[42:21] is when I'd like you if you can come up
[42:23] so he said absolutely so he's going to
[42:25] come and he's going to preach s Saturday

[42:38] sensitive to your needs he said in your
[42:39] situation he says listen if the people
[42:41] want to we'll take two we'll do two I
[42:43] said the people will want two so we're
[42:45] going to do a Saturday night and a
[42:46] Sunday morning service while I'm gone
[42:48] and then brother Paul as usual will do
[42:50] his adult Sunday school on the Wednesday
[42:52] night so be in prayer for that amen I I
[42:54] told Brother Carmen I'm very
[42:55] disappointed to to miss I had good
[42:57] fellowship with him and I've seen you
[42:58] know the service he preached there at
[43:00] brother Tim pritz and that so I believe
[43:02] you're in for a treat and I just wish I
[43:03] could be here but I'm thankful that I
[43:05] didn't even have to ask anyone God just
[43:07] brought somebody their way my way and
[43:09] just kind of filled in while uh while
[43:11] I'm gone amen so want to thank the Lord
[43:14] for that and just trust that Amen
[43:15] brother Bob enjoyed the song service
[43:16] that was perfect uh everything we're
[43:18] going to mention here tonight is is in
[43:20] the song service so praise the Lord for
[43:22] that and then sister Betty on the way in
[43:24] told Brother Matt she says I got my
[43:25] blood today and I am 100% cancer free
[43:29] hallelujah amen thank you
[43:33] Lord that's what we trust amen settle
[43:37] for nothing less amen than total healing
[43:40] total Victory amen so we thank God for
[43:42] that amen and trusting the Lord to just
[43:44] continue to guard and protect her every
[43:47] day amen second
[43:49] Timothy 1: 7 now before we read this
[43:53] Paul says in verse 6 he tells Timothy
[43:56] stir up the gift of God which is in thee
[44:00] now we're not all preachers like Timothy
[44:03] was but each one of us has the gift of
[44:06] the holy spirit inside of us and that's
[44:08] really what Paul's talking about because
[44:10] he says in verse 7 he says what stir up
[44:12] the gift that is within thee by the
[44:13] laying on of hands that's his preaching
[44:15] but he says what's behind that is what's
[44:17] really the gift he says for God had not
[44:20] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[44:23] and of love and of a A sound mind amen
[44:28] God bless you you can have your seats
[44:29] this evening and as you can imagine
[44:31] we're continuing on our Series in
[44:33] manifesting time and I'm going to take a
[44:35] third service on this thought of the
[44:37] spirit of freedom and I don't know if
[44:38] we're going to do another one but we'll
[44:40] see where we go but I have to say I've
[44:42] been enjoying this amen I I just I was
[44:44] studying on Monday and I just started
[44:47] crying just it's so beautiful what we
[44:50] have this message we've been given this
[44:52] this open word that we have you know
[44:54] we've we've got an open book book before
[44:56] us and it's got our names in it and
[44:58] God's calling our names and he's telling
[45:00] us who we are and he's telling us what
[45:01] he's provided for us and sometimes it's
[45:04] just overwhelming it's just overwhelming
[45:06] when we see the goodness of God and what
[45:08] he's done for us and what he's given us
[45:09] amen but you know sometimes we don't see
[45:12] the change but let me say whether we see
[45:13] it or not we're changing amen the
[45:15] scripture says we're changing from glory
[45:18] to glory amen he's building us up bit by
[45:20] bit and sometimes it takes a long time
[45:23] and then you look back and you realize
[45:24] he's been working on me
[45:26] amen and if he's been working on you
[45:27] he's going to keep working on you amen
[45:29] and that's really where our trust is and
[45:31] I was reading in my devotions in a
[45:33] Monday in Deuteronomy and I read the
[45:35] scripture that told them not to remove
[45:37] the landmarks and I want to read it this
[45:38] morning or this evening because it
[45:40] struck me how we've lost some landmarks
[45:42] today Deuteronomy 19:14 says Thou shalt
[45:45] not remove thy neighbor's Landmark which
[45:48] they of old time have set in thine
[45:50] inheritance which Thou shalt inherit in
[45:53] the land which the Lord thy God giveth
[45:55] thee to possess it you know we spoke
[45:57] last service on Samson and how he got in
[45:59] trouble when he went looking into the
[46:01] land of the Philistines but here's the
[46:03] thing philistia belonged to
[46:05] Samson they' conquered it once already
[46:08] and then they got out of the word they
[46:09] got away from the love of God they got
[46:11] away from the things of God and the
[46:12] Philistines came in and they took it
[46:14] back but it really belonged to Samson
[46:16] but what happened is the Philistines
[46:18] went in and they removed the ancient
[46:20] landmarks that said this is the land of
[46:22] the Israelites this belongs to a child
[46:24] of God this belongs to a child of Israel
[46:27] and they've removed them out and they've
[46:28] forgotten that that lands were supposed
[46:30] to belong to them amen the the the the
[46:33] the landmarks that proved that this
[46:34] belonged to the children of Israel were
[46:36] long gone and so they would sit there
[46:38] and they would look at it and they
[46:39] wouldn't remember that belongs to me and
[46:42] many of them had a a personal position a
[46:45] personal place a possession in that land
[46:47] and they never had it because the
[46:48] Philistines had taken it back amen I
[46:51] believe Satan has moved the
[46:52] landmarks he's come in and he's he he's
[46:55] gotten on our land and he's taken these
[46:57] things and he's he he said they belong
[46:59] to me but I'll tell you God sent a
[47:00] prophet to restore the ancient landmarks
[47:03] and they open and full word of God and
[47:05] he's come and he's told us this belongs
[47:08] to you and he would say time and time
[47:10] again take it back take it back amen and
[47:13] I believe we're here tonight to say
[47:15] Satan give it back amen give us back
[47:18] what belongs to us not because we have
[47:20] something good or that that we've
[47:22] determined it but because God has told
[47:24] us in his word this belongs to you amen
[47:26] and I believe that's what we're doing
[47:28] here and that means we've got to commit
[47:29] to the battle amen we've got to commit
[47:31] to sticking it through we've got to
[47:32] commit to pressing for these things amen
[47:34] we've got to commit to trusting God and
[47:36] knowing that he'll do what he said he
[47:38] would do amen I want to talk a bit
[47:40] tonight as you can imagine maybe from
[47:42] our scripture I want to take a thought
[47:44] on fear and we're talking about the
[47:46] spirit of freedom but I want to talk
[47:47] about the weapon that Satan brings and
[47:49] it's fear and brother Bram actually
[47:50] preaches a message called the power of
[47:51] the devil and he speaks about this fear
[47:54] but I'm reminded of brother ER V NOA
[47:56] some of you might know him he was a a
[47:58] real talker and he was a minister at
[48:00] brother Ed bisc church for a long time
[48:02] and he actually gave uh uh message tapes
[48:05] and books to uh to Benny Hinn he was a
[48:07] close personal friend of Benny Hinn he
[48:09] comes from a Pentecostal background and
[48:10] a charismatic background but this is
[48:12] what brother Ernie V NOA always said
[48:14] about fear he said fear is false
[48:17] evidence appearing real amen so Satan's
[48:21] goal is to magnify reality beyond what
[48:24] it is to make you think that you can't
[48:27] defeat or you can't go through the
[48:28] situation or you can't overcome what's
[48:31] in front of you amen Satan's goal is to
[48:33] make it so big and so bad that he
[48:35] defeats Us by keeping us from even
[48:37] starting the fight in the first place if
[48:39] he can defeat you before you get started
[48:41] then he's won the battle hasn't he amen
[48:43] so he tries and he tries to blow it up
[48:45] and he tries to magnify it and it
[48:47] reminds me of in the scripture when the
[48:49] the the the 12 uh spies came back and
[48:52] Caleb and Joshua gave a wonderful report
[48:54] but the 10 of them said we are as
[48:56] grasshoppers in their eyes Satan wants
[48:58] you thinking you're a grasshopper in the
[49:00] eyes of himself and in the eyes of the
[49:02] the the demons that are on his side amen
[49:05] but God is here to restore us back to
[49:06] our position and say greater is he
[49:08] that's in you than he that's in the
[49:09] world you are more than able to conquer
[49:12] them amen as as J as as Joshua and Caleb
[49:15] said now when I was looking at fear you
[49:17] know fear has a natural purpose and its
[49:20] purpose is to help us make life-saving
[49:22] decisions you're supposed to have fear
[49:25] and fear is not supposed to paralyze you
[49:27] but fear is supposed to make you watch
[49:29] what you're doing so that you don't
[49:31] cause unnecessary harm and and and in an
[49:33] extreme case that you don't lose your
[49:35] life it's supposed to be based on
[49:37] reality it's supposed to be based on
[49:39] experience and it's supposed to be based
[49:41] on understanding but what happens so
[49:43] often is that our experiences are not
[49:45] what we think we are they are and so
[49:47] they magnify the danger they magnify the
[49:50] issue and it paralyzes us when we come
[49:52] into those situations again or it will
[49:54] project fear into a situation where it
[49:56] doesn't really need to be think of it as
[50:00] as children and you know brother Brandon
[50:01] remember you had that woman that came up
[50:03] and she had all these issues and he he
[50:05] went into her life and he says this all
[50:06] goes back to a time when a dog scared
[50:09] you fear had overtaken her life and all
[50:12] she needed was that fear to be exposed
[50:15] and then all of a sudden she was made
[50:17] well but it took a prophit to do that
[50:20] amen that the fear in her life was
[50:21] controlling her and keeping her from a
[50:23] victory that was needed inside of her
[50:25] body body amen if I was a young boy and
[50:28] I got hit while Cross by a car while
[50:30] crossing the street let me tell you I'd
[50:32] have a fear of crossing the road every
[50:34] time I had to cross the road and it
[50:36] maybe would come to the point where I
[50:37] would not cross a road and I'd be bound
[50:39] by my fear of crossing a road and yet
[50:42] day after day people thousands millions
[50:44] of people cross the road every day and
[50:47] they're not fearful about it and they
[50:48] don't get hit by a car but because I
[50:51] have one bad experience that fear holds
[50:54] me back from doing something that I
[50:55] ought to be capable of doing which is
[50:57] crossing a road and not getting hit by a
[50:58] car am man fear is supposed to moderate
[51:00] our approach it's not supposed to
[51:02] paralyze Us in its proper context What
[51:04] Fear will do is make me look before I
[51:07] cross the road but it won't keep me from
[51:09] crossing the road but Satan's trying to
[51:11] keep us from Crossing roads he's trying
[51:12] to keep us from moving forward in these
[51:14] things and that kind of fear has no
[51:16] place in a Believer if you are paralyzed
[51:18] by fear that is absolutely demonic
[51:21] influence inside of your life and that
[51:23] does not belong there and it takes the
[51:24] power of the Holy Ghost to move those
[51:26] things out as I was looking in that
[51:28] scripture I want to look at the
[51:29] Amplified here he says he's not given us
[51:31] a spirit of fear but he's given us a
[51:33] spirit of power of love and of a sound
[51:35] mind in the Amplified says for God did
[51:37] not give us a spirit of timidity you
[51:40] know what's timid babies and things that
[51:43] get
[51:44] eaten if you look in the animal world
[51:46] the things that are at the lowest part
[51:48] of the food chain are the most timid
[51:49] because they have no defense mechanism
[51:52] he says he's not given us a spirit of
[51:53] timidity he says of coward
[51:56] of craving and cringing and fawning fear
[52:00] you don't have to pull back you don't
[52:03] have to bow down you don't have to pull
[52:05] away from anything that Satan throws at
[52:07] you he says but he has given us a spirit
[52:10] of power and of love and of calm and
[52:15] well balanced mind and discipline and
[52:19] self-control so when we look at this
[52:21] we've been preaching on Divine love
[52:22] we've been preaching on charity and this
[52:24] all fits on under the window of Charity
[52:26] because charity is the Holy Ghost and
[52:28] here timoth what Paul is saying to
[52:29] Timothy is he's saying the holy spirit
[52:31] is a spirit of power it's a spirit of
[52:35] love and it's a spirit of a sound mind
[52:38] amen if you got the Holy Ghost then
[52:39] you're supposed to have power you're
[52:41] supposed to have love and you're
[52:42] supposed to have a sound mind in your
[52:44] day-to-day walk with God Amen it's
[52:46] supposed to settle us down so that Satan
[52:48] can't spook us he can't get us running
[52:50] he can't get us reacting he can't get us
[52:52] panicking God says fear not time After
[52:55] Time After Time in the Scriptures it
[52:58] seems like every time God comes with a
[53:00] message or God comes with a decree or
[53:02] God comes with a direction the first
[53:04] thing he says is fear not why because
[53:06] we're inclined to fear since the fall
[53:10] the first thing that happened as soon as
[53:12] Adam and Eve sinned was they got fear
[53:14] they got afraid if you remember but he
[53:18] says no when I come don't be scared
[53:20] because I'm here to take you out of fear
[53:21] I'm not to put fear inside of you
[53:24] there's a fear for God there's a respect
[53:25] of God but that's not what we're talking
[53:27] about we're talking about something that
[53:28] causes you to pull back to bow down to
[53:30] let something have its way in your life
[53:32] amen but every time God comes he says
[53:35] fear not it's tied to an explanation
[53:37] it's tied to a command or it's tied to
[53:39] his attributes that's so three things
[53:41] that you'll see most common and what is
[53:42] it it's God saying it's okay I'm here to
[53:45] help you through this situation and he
[53:47] says fear not so he can do two things he
[53:49] can get people to stop doing what they
[53:50] ought not to be doing or to start doing
[53:52] what they ought to be doing he's trying
[53:54] to get you to stop from going into
[53:56] danger or he's trying to get you to
[53:57] press into the
[53:59] promises amen we see one of the biggest
[54:01] fear not moments in the scripture and
[54:03] it's right as they're about to go into
[54:05] Canaan because remember they came into
[54:07] they came up to the border of Canaan and
[54:09] they feared and they wouldn't listen to
[54:11] the testimony and they wouldn't listen
[54:12] to Moses and they wouldn't listen to God
[54:14] and they pull back and God Ran them
[54:16] around the desert for 40 years but then
[54:18] he comes into the book of Deuteronomy
[54:20] and he's reminding them you've got a
[54:22] place to go and now it's not a time to
[54:23] turn back you've got to in and you got
[54:25] to take hold of This Promise he says
[54:27] you've got to go somewhere you've never
[54:29] gone before and that's why I'm here to
[54:31] lead you but you got to go you can't
[54:34] stay here it's time to go into the
[54:35] promise and it's a spirit of power
[54:38] that's coming to the Forefront here so
[54:40] in Deuteronomy one it says behold the
[54:42] Lord thy God has set the L before thee
[54:45] what's in front of you is by God's
[54:47] decision by God's ordination he says go
[54:51] up and possess it as the Lord God of thy
[54:53] fathers has said unto thee he says fear
[54:56] not neither be discouraged God's trying
[54:59] to build them up God's trying to pump
[55:00] them up to go into the promised land
[55:03] brother brandom says this he says we
[55:06] ought to be
[55:07] free he says if we study the
[55:10] word and believe the
[55:13] word give us room he's sure let's get
[55:16] out and get moving let's start
[55:18] exercising our faith let's do something
[55:20] with what God has given us if we believe
[55:23] it if we've got it then let's do
[55:24] something with it brother R would put it
[55:26] this way he says the first thing you
[55:28] know you get to petting your sickness
[55:29] around petting your little pettiness
[55:32] around and things like that because your
[55:33] neighbor doesn't believe in healing your
[55:35] neighbor doesn't believe in the Holy
[55:36] Ghost he says destroy the thing let's go
[55:38] over and take the land Hallelujah God
[55:41] said it's ours if he said it's ours if
[55:44] he said it's ours it belongs to us the
[55:47] promise is unto you and to your children
[55:50] and to your children's children as many
[55:52] as the Lord Our God shall call amen
[55:54] that's what the matter with the church
[55:56] tonight we got a wishbone instead of a
[55:59] backbone he says what we need is
[56:01] something in there that'll stand you up
[56:03] amen he says every man that ever
[56:07] amounted to a hill of beans had to fight
[56:09] for what he
[56:10] got God don't give it to you on a silver
[56:12] platter he said there's the promised
[56:14] land she's flowing with milk and honey
[56:17] but before you get there you're going to
[56:18] go through all these hivites and
[56:20] Canaanites and everything but don't you
[56:22] bow down to one of them remember last
[56:25] last service brother R said you don't
[56:27] have to knuckle down to to the devil you
[56:30] don't have to knuckle down to Satan you
[56:31] don't have to bow down before anything
[56:34] he says you destroy the things as you
[56:38] come to them scripture says sufficient
[56:42] to the day is the evil thereof don't be
[56:45] all worried about what tomorrow holds
[56:47] deal with what's in front of you today
[56:49] cuz that's the one that God has ordained
[56:51] for you to destroy today don't get
[56:52] worked up about the future
[56:55] why fear will magnify it focus on what's
[56:58] in front of you today he says destroy it
[57:01] as you come to them stop building a fire
[57:04] on the enemy's altar amen what is it the
[57:07] first step is always the
[57:10] hardest the first step and and every
[57:13] believer here knows that I know it you
[57:15] know the first time you step out on the
[57:17] word of God it's on faith and faith
[57:19] alone there's nothing to show you that
[57:22] it's right there's nothing to prove to
[57:23] you that it's right it's something in
[57:25] your heart that God has anchored and you
[57:27] step out and you say I believe it and
[57:29] then you act on it but the first step is
[57:31] always the hardest it's always the
[57:34] hardest and the question is what what if
[57:37] he doesn't answer what if he doesn't
[57:40] respond what if he doesn't do it what is
[57:43] it it's Satan putting fear on you to try
[57:46] and offset the faith that's inside of
[57:48] you by the Holy Spirit quickening the
[57:50] word here's the thing it's just as
[57:53] reasonable to say what if if he
[57:57] does but Satan will focus on us what if
[58:00] he doesn't but we ought to be thinking
[58:02] if we're rational creatures what if he
[58:04] does what if he does what he says but
[58:08] Satan's there and we've got an adversary
[58:10] that's playing with our mind to try and
[58:12] twist it so that a spirit of power and a
[58:14] sound mind can't work to get us focused
[58:16] on what if he doesn't church I'm here to
[58:18] tell you what if he does not what if he
[58:21] does but he will he said he would he's
[58:23] going to do it amen amen what is it
[58:25] Satan's trying to get our mind close to
[58:27] the idea that there is still the same
[58:29] God here today there's the same Holy
[58:31] Ghost here today that was in a prophet's
[58:33] Ministry in 70 years ago and in Christ's
[58:35] Ministry in the apostles 2,000 years ago
[58:38] the same Holy Ghost is here today to
[58:40] Quicken the word to us and to do the
[58:42] same Works in our lives brother brandom
[58:45] says the first you know really the first
[58:48] step is just a little out of your reach
[58:51] he says we have to accept it by faith
[58:53] it's just a little more more than the
[58:55] human mind can explain you can't explain
[58:57] God if you do then he's no more accepted
[58:59] by faith you have to believe him he that
[59:02] cometh to God must believe that he is
[59:04] and a rewarder of those that diligently
[59:06] seek after
[59:07] him then he says in the message of the
[59:09] great Shining Light he says but it gives
[59:11] us consolation to know this that we do
[59:15] not hold our
[59:19] destiny that doesn't mean the path is
[59:21] not influenced by us cuz our choice
[59:23] every day deter what the road looks like
[59:26] but our destiny the Finish point is
[59:28] already determined for every Son of God
[59:31] you're already
[59:34] there it's done it's a finished work
[59:37] like I prayed about Lord help us to step
[59:40] into the revelation of a finished work
[59:42] that'll keep you going when time gets
[59:44] tough that'll keep you going when things
[59:45] are are when you're sick when the
[59:47] finances aren't so good when things are
[59:49] falling apart it's a finished work it's
[59:51] already done it's already done and all
[59:54] I'm doing is walk walking through a
[59:55] finished film man I like what brother
[59:57] Hank said to me the film's already done
[59:59] I just got to walk through it he says
[1:00:01] god holds our destiny we don't hold our
[1:00:03] destiny god holds our destiny and he has
[1:00:06] ordained it to be so and there is
[1:00:08] nothing that's an absolute there is
[1:00:11] nothing will ever interrupt the program
[1:00:14] of God we are bound to
[1:00:17] arrive you're bound to
[1:00:20] arrive he says then there was to be no
[1:00:23] fear
[1:00:25] he's talking about Mary and Joseph he
[1:00:26] says now Mary be Mary and Joseph
[1:00:27] themselves just common people not
[1:00:29] educated they didn't have the way of
[1:00:31] knowing these things that they were
[1:00:32] taking place right at that time was
[1:00:34] fulfilling the scriptures and it's the
[1:00:35] same today the things are taking place
[1:00:38] right in this day that we live in and
[1:00:40] many of us know nothing about it how God
[1:00:42] is moving but oh to see in this dark
[1:00:44] enveloping out time God's Great hand
[1:00:47] moves steadily on nothing shall stop it
[1:00:51] remember we walk by faith and not by
[1:00:53] sight just CU You Don't See see it
[1:00:54] doesn't mean it's not happening just cuz
[1:00:56] you don't hear it doesn't mean it's not
[1:00:58] being spoken just cuz you don't know it
[1:01:00] doesn't mean it's not being done God is
[1:01:04] moving his great hand moves steadily on
[1:01:07] I was talking to a minister recently
[1:01:10] about some things that are going on in
[1:01:11] this church and I said you know what
[1:01:12] we're praying and we're believing and
[1:01:15] things are starting to happen and it's
[1:01:17] starting to become matter of
[1:01:19] fact it's starting to become matter of
[1:01:21] fact I believe that with all my heart
[1:01:23] when I pray I believe what we pray for
[1:01:26] is going to happen that the need is
[1:01:28] going to be met not always the way we
[1:01:30] prayed for it amen but the need is going
[1:01:33] to be met one way or the other God moves
[1:01:36] on behalf of his children every single
[1:01:39] time that's just the way it is amen and
[1:01:42] I believe that's what's going to be
[1:01:44] happening as we move closer and closer
[1:01:47] to this Rapture is that we're going to
[1:01:48] get focused on the will of God we're
[1:01:50] going to get focused on the word of God
[1:01:52] we're going to get in the anointing of
[1:01:53] the Holy SP Spirit to catch what God
[1:01:56] wants done and we're going to start
[1:01:57] calling for it in a greater and a
[1:01:59] greater way amen that as we come closer
[1:02:02] to that the things of this world will
[1:02:04] grow strangely
[1:02:05] dim you I was thinking the other day if
[1:02:08] you look in a
[1:02:09] light and you look in a light for long
[1:02:12] enough if you close your eyes and go in
[1:02:14] a dark room you know what you can still
[1:02:15] see
[1:02:17] light cuz it's burned into your eyeballs
[1:02:20] and I was thinking if we could look at
[1:02:22] this word that much if we could look and
[1:02:25] look and read and read and absorb and
[1:02:29] eat and feed and feed it didn't matter
[1:02:32] how dark it got how quiet it got or how
[1:02:35] loud it got how alone it got when we
[1:02:37] closed our eyes this would be coming out
[1:02:40] and no matter what all we could see was
[1:02:42] the light of God's word making a way
[1:02:44] through every trial and every situation
[1:02:45] that we're dealing with Hallelujah if we
[1:02:48] could just get their Church where
[1:02:50] everything everything is focused on that
[1:02:53] great word that he's given us us he's
[1:02:55] given it to us it's the answer it says
[1:02:57] he sent his word to heal our diseases
[1:03:00] amen the spirit of Truth is here to make
[1:03:02] it alive to Quicken it in each each and
[1:03:04] every one of our Lives it's God moving
[1:03:06] in his people you know how I know it's
[1:03:08] happening not just in my life and yours
[1:03:10] because I see what you're praying for I
[1:03:12] see what you're asking for I see what
[1:03:13] you come up for prayer for and it shows
[1:03:16] that faith is rising that we're asking
[1:03:19] for things we've never had the courage
[1:03:20] to ask for we've never had the faith to
[1:03:22] ask for before and it shows that God is
[1:03:24] moving in his word amen you know the
[1:03:27] first time I prayed for someone as a
[1:03:28] minister it was an
[1:03:30] experience because you know what I am no
[1:03:33] different from you and people will ask
[1:03:36] you to pray for the most impossible
[1:03:38] things currently speaking the most
[1:03:40] impossible things and you sit there and
[1:03:43] you say how in the world am I going to
[1:03:44] pray for that well let me tell you when
[1:03:47] God called me to minister he called me
[1:03:48] to pray and he called me to pray
[1:03:51] effectively amen he called me to pray
[1:03:54] for sicknesses he called me to cast out
[1:03:57] demons he called me to pray to change
[1:04:00] situations that's the calling of a
[1:04:02] minister is not to just preach it in
[1:04:04] these notes but to preach it by a living
[1:04:06] gospel by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:08] amen and let me tell you the first time
[1:04:10] I prayed and every time since then I've
[1:04:12] got to trust that his calling and his
[1:04:14] choosing puts me in a position to pray
[1:04:17] the way that he he needs me to pray for
[1:04:18] his people but it's not just for me how
[1:04:22] many times would brother brandham say
[1:04:24] he'd say lay your hand on the person
[1:04:25] next to you he says it's in you it's in
[1:04:29] you whether you're a mother whether
[1:04:30] you're a wife whether you're a husband
[1:04:32] whether you're a father whether you're
[1:04:33] single whether you're rich whether
[1:04:35] you're poor whether you're fat whether
[1:04:37] you're skinny it don't matter if you are
[1:04:39] a child of God God is calling you to
[1:04:43] pray and call on the things that he's
[1:04:45] given for his family each and every one
[1:04:47] of us is supposed to have that amen you
[1:04:49] know when I pray I I I I
[1:04:52] quiver because it's the the Holy Spirit
[1:04:55] that's there to take care of the
[1:04:56] situation it's not me sometimes I can
[1:04:58] barely
[1:04:59] talk because it's his presence that
[1:05:02] makes the difference it's nothing about
[1:05:04] me it's nothing about me but church we
[1:05:07] are ordained husbands you are ordained
[1:05:10] to take control of your families of your
[1:05:13] households of the atmosphere that's
[1:05:14] around there you are ordained to do it
[1:05:16] mothers you have the same authority over
[1:05:18] your children each and every one of you
[1:05:21] by the power of the Holy Ghost if you
[1:05:22] are a born again believer you ought to
[1:05:25] have a ought to have a confidence in the
[1:05:27] power that God has placed in you the
[1:05:28] authority he's given you by the holy
[1:05:30] spirit amen as a minister I had to find
[1:05:33] faith and I had to trust and I had to
[1:05:35] rest that God had called me to do
[1:05:36] this but it takes faith it takes Faith
[1:05:39] No Matter What Amen brother Bram says
[1:05:42] this he says I used to often time wonder
[1:05:45] what's the matter with the Christian
[1:05:46] Church they're so scared of things we're
[1:05:49] talking about fear he says why you got
[1:05:52] nothing to be scared about the first
[1:05:53] word nearly Jesus said after the
[1:05:55] resurrection fear not see don't fear
[1:05:58] don't get scared there ain't nothing
[1:06:00] going to happen nothing can happen
[1:06:03] nothing can bother a Christian you say
[1:06:05] things happen yes but nothing can change
[1:06:08] who you are nothing can change what you
[1:06:10] are nothing can change your destination
[1:06:12] nothing can change your purpose nothing
[1:06:13] can change what God has planned for you
[1:06:16] amen not even death itself can even
[1:06:18] touch the Christian he that heareth my
[1:06:20] words and believeth on him that has sent
[1:06:22] me have the everlasting life shall not
[1:06:24] come into condemnation but has passed
[1:06:26] from Death to life amen death itself has
[1:06:29] no Reign Over a Christian because Christ
[1:06:31] died in our stead
[1:06:33] amen he says what faith ought to do
[1:06:36] ought to build up in the people is
[1:06:38] something that'll tow the mark now we
[1:06:41] don't know what that means anymore but
[1:06:43] way back in in the in the early days the
[1:06:46] 16 17 1800s when they did boxing they
[1:06:49] didn't put as brother B said pillows on
[1:06:51] their on their fists and go in a nice
[1:06:52] marked out ring what they' do is they'd
[1:06:54] have people stand around in a in an area
[1:06:57] around a just a marked off area and then
[1:07:00] if there the two combatants the two
[1:07:01] boxers would come in and what they'd do
[1:07:03] is they' just Mark a line in the
[1:07:06] dirt and to start the match both of you
[1:07:09] had to come up and put your feet on the
[1:07:11] line you had to tow the line and as soon
[1:07:13] as your toe was there and his toe was
[1:07:15] there now you could fight and the and
[1:07:18] the they today they have you know they
[1:07:19] got 2 3 minutes for for a round back
[1:07:22] then the round lasted until somebody got
[1:07:24] knocked
[1:07:25] down and then when you got knocked down
[1:07:27] you chose whether you wanted to continue
[1:07:29] or not and if you wanted to continue
[1:07:31] then you had to come up you had to stand
[1:07:33] up and you had to tow the line again and
[1:07:35] go face to face with your with your
[1:07:36] combatant the
[1:07:38] opponent and it went and went until
[1:07:40] somebody couldn't tow the line you had
[1:07:43] to be tough back then cuz you got beaten
[1:07:45] until you couldn't stand
[1:07:47] up if you got knocked out you could
[1:07:50] still get up and to the line they'd
[1:07:52] throw water on you and say do you want
[1:07:53] to continue today no no if you get
[1:07:55] knocked down three times you're done no
[1:07:57] there you went until you couldn't tow
[1:07:59] the line brother Braham says we need
[1:08:01] something in us a faith that'll make us
[1:08:03] tow the line no matter how many times we
[1:08:05] get knocked down no matter how many
[1:08:06] things we go through we keep coming up
[1:08:08] and saying I'm still in this
[1:08:10] fight he says you'll get never get
[1:08:12] nothing by being a little jellyfish
[1:08:14] Christian no sir do you ever see a
[1:08:16] jellyfish you just hit them he splatters
[1:08:18] all over
[1:08:19] everything see a jellyfish you know what
[1:08:21] usually eats them the crabs and things
[1:08:23] along the side by the seashore comes up
[1:08:24] with his pincher and cuts him in two and
[1:08:26] takes him down cuz the jellyfish just
[1:08:29] lays
[1:08:30] there he says brother we need some
[1:08:32] Christians not jellyfish but with a
[1:08:34] backbone that'll stand he says oh I
[1:08:36] don't mean to fuss with people but stand
[1:08:38] for your god-given rights that Christ
[1:08:41] died for there's a price paid let's take
[1:08:43] it he says certainly not pushed around
[1:08:46] we don't have to be no sir he says we've
[1:08:48] got an inheritance and our inheritance
[1:08:51] belongs to us it's your privilege to
[1:08:54] have anything that you inherited through
[1:08:56] accepting Jesus Christ and dying to
[1:09:00] yourself he says how marvelous yes sir
[1:09:02] Satan said well I'll tell you what I'm
[1:09:04] going to do he says no you ain't going
[1:09:06] to do nothing that's the way to talk
[1:09:08] back to him we've got to stand up
[1:09:11] enough's enough you've talked enough
[1:09:14] remember the story of sister barns
[1:09:17] you've been talking for a long time now
[1:09:20] let me start talking back to
[1:09:22] you he says that's way to talk back to
[1:09:24] him say I know my position in Christ and
[1:09:27] you just might as well get away I ain't
[1:09:29] listening to you no more I've got an
[1:09:31] inheritance you got to know that you're
[1:09:32] a son and daughter of God that's why you
[1:09:35] need to read your Bible and pray every
[1:09:37] day that's why you need to spend time
[1:09:38] with God every day that's why you need
[1:09:40] to be in a spirit of worship every day
[1:09:42] is to keep reminding us because we're
[1:09:44] forgetful
[1:09:45] hearers and we're walking through a
[1:09:47] dirty world that's trying to remind us
[1:09:49] or trying to make us think we ain't
[1:09:51] children of God that we're just like
[1:09:53] them and because we're just like them we
[1:09:54] got to put up with the same things they
[1:09:56] do we don't have to put up with it we're
[1:09:58] children of God we're on a different set
[1:09:59] of
[1:10:01] privileges he says and we got a tital
[1:10:03] deed to it an abstract that goes all the
[1:10:06] way back to Calvary the day of Pentecost
[1:10:08] when he said this promises unto you to
[1:10:10] your children and them that's a far off
[1:10:12] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:10:14] call an abstract deed clear all the way
[1:10:17] back to Pentecost how far does it go
[1:10:19] back and how many is it for as many as
[1:10:22] the Lord will call if the Lord calls you
[1:10:25] he gives you an abstract title all the
[1:10:27] way back now we don't really know that
[1:10:30] that title that that that phrase
[1:10:32] Abstract title but an abstract title d
[1:10:35] means it's been checked and it's been
[1:10:36] cleared and nobody has any leens to it
[1:10:39] nobody has any rights to it there's no
[1:10:42] debts owed on it it's free and clear and
[1:10:44] it belongs to the person that has the
[1:10:46] abstract title deed and he says when you
[1:10:48] are born again God gives you the Holy
[1:10:51] Spirit you have a tital deed to every
[1:10:54] promise in the word of God you have a
[1:10:56] tital deed in your name for every
[1:10:59] promise of God it belongs to
[1:11:02] you he said and the blood of Jesus
[1:11:04] Christ is just as good as it would have
[1:11:06] been shed 10 minutes ago it said every
[1:11:09] believer it's your
[1:11:12] profession are you going to use it are
[1:11:15] you going to use it he says you're just
[1:11:17] scared to use your rights that's
[1:11:19] all imagine this he he gives a situation
[1:11:22] he says when you go home tonight you
[1:11:24] Christians respectable people that's
[1:11:25] here sitting a big bunch of drugs drunks
[1:11:28] and things have moved in and taken over

[1:11:36] beings isn't it yes well I'm a human
[1:11:38] being and I have a right to be here well

[1:12:01] have a spirit inside of you but not any
[1:12:03] Spirit the holy spirit so any other
[1:12:06] spirit that comes you can say you don't

[1:12:20] he said I'm not going to get out he says
[1:12:22] well there's a law down here that says
[1:12:24] that he will get out as long as you can
[1:12:26] prove it's your house is that right

[1:12:43] God's Great detective just leave the
[1:12:45] blood there and serve that warrant on
[1:12:48] him and watch the Holy Ghost put him out
[1:12:50] amen there you are it's yours whosoever
[1:12:53] will will let him come he says oh it's
[1:12:56] marvelous what's he saying Church he's
[1:12:59] saying he tries to put fear in you put
[1:13:01] the fear back where it
[1:13:03] belongs give it back to its
[1:13:05] originator remember the origin of fear
[1:13:07] is Satan it's sin it's unbelief it's a
[1:13:12] knowledge of your condition is the
[1:13:14] original
[1:13:15] fear because remember as soon as they
[1:13:18] knew that they had sinned the presence
[1:13:20] of God which they'd enjoyed for who
[1:13:22] knows how many how many years they hid
[1:13:25] from it why because they were
[1:13:29] afraid
[1:13:31] why of their condition they were scared
[1:13:35] that their condition was going to keep
[1:13:37] them out of acceptance from
[1:13:40] God that's the fear that Satan puts on
[1:13:42] us is about our condition so many times
[1:13:45] he says here's what you are here's what
[1:13:47] you have here's what you said here's
[1:13:49] what you did or here's what you didn't
[1:13:51] say and didn't do and you should have
[1:13:52] said and did
[1:13:54] right he gets us worried about our
[1:13:55] condition our faults and our failures
[1:13:57] and he's trying to keep you out of the
[1:13:58] word of God and he's trying to keep you
[1:13:59] out of the presence of God because he
[1:14:01] gets us thinking you got to be perfect
[1:14:03] to come into the presence of God that's
[1:14:05] not it our Perfection is not in
[1:14:07] ourselves our Perfection is in a perfect
[1:14:09] sacrifice it's under the blood that we
[1:14:11] are perfect not in
[1:14:13] ourselves Satan says you're not
[1:14:16] worthy let's look at what the word
[1:14:19] says where where are we at tonight
[1:14:22] listen we're believers but we aren't
[1:14:23] always feeling like we're in Heavenly
[1:14:25] places sometimes we feel like we're in a
[1:14:27] bit of a personal hell If we're honest
[1:14:30] it just seems like things have built up
[1:14:31] and built up and we listen I disappoint
[1:14:34] myself and if myself at times and if I
[1:14:36] disappoint me I know I disappoint God
[1:14:38] and sometimes we can get so caught up in
[1:14:40] our own disappointments that we say I
[1:14:43] can't even find
[1:14:44] him done too much gone too far can't get
[1:14:47] back to him let's read what the
[1:14:49] scripture says about where his Spirit
[1:14:51] can
[1:14:52] go David saidh shall I go from thy
[1:14:55] Spirit or whether shall I free from thy
[1:14:58] presence he says where can I get away
[1:14:59] from your spirit and how can I get away
[1:15:02] from you
[1:15:03] Lord he said if I Ascend up into heaven
[1:15:06] Thou Art there praise the Lord Brother
[1:15:08] John but what about the next part he
[1:15:10] says if I make my bed in hell behold
[1:15:14] Thou Art
[1:15:15] there that's contrary to what our
[1:15:17] Humanity wants to think when I get down
[1:15:20] and out when I mess up when I make
[1:15:23] mistakes he's not there no no it says
[1:15:26] you're still there if I make my bed in
[1:15:29] hell your spirit is still there to call
[1:15:32] me out to bring me out when we're
[1:15:35] feeling completely
[1:15:36] unworthy we're supposed to be in
[1:15:38] Heavenly places but sometimes our
[1:15:40] feeling is more like we're in hellish
[1:15:43] places he says even there he says Thou
[1:15:46] Art there he says if I take the wings of
[1:15:49] the morning and dwell in the uttermost
[1:15:51] parts of the sea even there there shall
[1:15:54] thy hand lead me and thy right hand
[1:15:56] shall hold me you can't get anywhere
[1:15:59] from the presence of God as a child of
[1:16:02] God it comes looking for you it comes
[1:16:05] wooing you it comes pulling sometimes it
[1:16:08] comes with a
[1:16:09] paddle but it
[1:16:12] comes as a child of God he always comes
[1:16:15] looking for you he comes getting you he
[1:16:17] draws you back to where you left him
[1:16:19] amen there's always a rope that's tied
[1:16:21] to us and it's our predestination I like
[1:16:22] what brother Steven stru says he says
[1:16:24] predestination is the rope that keeps
[1:16:25] bringing you back to God Amen back in in
[1:16:30] Eden after they sinned and they got
[1:16:33] afraid and they disbelieved there was
[1:16:35] angels that were guarding the presence
[1:16:36] of God and they guarded Christ with a
[1:16:39] sword to keep us back but ever since
[1:16:40] Calvary the Angels you'll notice have
[1:16:42] been trying to bring us back to him see
[1:16:44] in the old days only one man a year
[1:16:46] could go in one day a year into the
[1:16:48] presence of God into the holy of holies
[1:16:51] and that was the high priest one man
[1:16:53] year and he went in for himself with the
[1:16:56] blood and then when God covered his sins
[1:16:58] then he went in with the blood for the
[1:16:59] covering of the people then when he came
[1:17:00] out they knew that they were they was
[1:17:02] atoned for for another year only one man
[1:17:04] got to go into the Shina presence but
[1:17:06] after Calvary what happened the veil is
[1:17:08] torn and now every angel in heaven is
[1:17:10] trying to push us into the presence of
[1:17:11] God because it was death to go in before
[1:17:13] now it's death if we stay out brother
[1:17:15] brandom said everything that this word
[1:17:17] is trying to do is bring us to the
[1:17:18] presence of God to refuse its death to
[1:17:20] accept it his life talking about our
[1:17:24] condition that Satan uses against US 1
[1:17:26] John 3 says this and hereby we know that
[1:17:29] we are of the truth and shall assure our
[1:17:32] hearts before him for if our hearts
[1:17:35] condemn us God is greater than our heart
[1:17:38] and knoweth all things anybody's heart
[1:17:40] ever condemn him you don't have to raise
[1:17:42] your hand mine's condemned me many
[1:17:44] times if your heart condemns you he says
[1:17:47] God's greater than that the Amplified
[1:17:49] says whenever our hearts in tormenting
[1:17:52] self- accusation
[1:17:53] and makes us feel guilty and condemns us
[1:17:56] he says he reminds us we are in God's
[1:17:59] hands he says for he is above and
[1:18:02] greater than our consciences our hearts
[1:18:04] and he knows he perceives and
[1:18:06] understands everything he says nothing
[1:18:08] is hidden from him there's a remedy and
[1:18:11] the remedy is
[1:18:13] confession and repentance repentance
[1:18:16] means go the other way turn back to
[1:18:20] right and when you do that now you got
[1:18:22] to path back to where you need to be
[1:18:25] then we can move to verse 21 verse 21
[1:18:28] says beloved if our heart condemn us not
[1:18:31] take care of your heart take care of the
[1:18:33] condemnation that's there because as
[1:18:34] soon as that's done now you can move
[1:18:36] back towards God he says then we have
[1:18:38] confidence towards God and whatsoever we
[1:18:42] ask we receive of him because we keep
[1:18:43] his Commandments and do those things
[1:18:45] that are pleasing in his sight anybody
[1:18:47] ever pray and you know things aren't
[1:18:48] right between you and
[1:18:51] God four of
[1:18:53] us I know I'm not asking you to raise
[1:18:56] your hands but you know when you pray
[1:19:00] ain't nothing going to happen right when
[1:19:03] you know you got to make something right
[1:19:05] you know I'm praying because I'm a
[1:19:07] Christian and that's what we do but you
[1:19:09] know for a fact ain't God God ain't
[1:19:12] hearing your prayer because there's a
[1:19:13] barrier between you and him and you got
[1:19:15] to confess your sin and put it under the
[1:19:18] blood you got to make it right otherwise
[1:19:20] the ceiling is like brass
[1:19:23] and it's just bouncing off and you're
[1:19:25] just doing this by rot you're doing it
[1:19:26] by by by habit and God ain't listening
[1:19:29] to you because you know better and you
[1:19:32] got to make it right it's that simple
[1:19:34] and as soon as you make it right
[1:19:36] condemnation lifts from your heart
[1:19:38] listen we ain't Catholic we don't have
[1:19:40] to go around beating ourselves up I did
[1:19:42] this I did that I didn't do this I
[1:19:43] didn't do that and we got to make
[1:19:45] ourselves miserable for 12 days no when
[1:19:49] and I'm a testament to this by God's
[1:19:50] grace I can say this with all my heart
[1:19:52] it's true true when I lay it before him
[1:19:55] it's done and I can move on as if I
[1:19:58] never did it brother Adam talked about I
[1:20:00] have no more conscience of sin I know
[1:20:02] what that means that when you lay it
[1:20:05] under the blood it's as if you never did
[1:20:07] it and it doesn't bother me one lick
[1:20:10] you're torn up until that point but you
[1:20:12] do it and you say Lord help me not to do
[1:20:13] it again and you go on in newness as if
[1:20:16] you never did it in the first place
[1:20:18] because he doesn't see you do it I've
[1:20:20] said this before you say God I did it
[1:20:21] again he says did what again he can't
[1:20:23] even remember you did it ever before
[1:20:25] it's new every time and it's forgotten
[1:20:27] every single time
[1:20:30] amen I look at this and I say church
[1:20:32] it's time to make Satan feel nervous
[1:20:36] we're supposed to have confidence and if
[1:20:39] we're confident that means somebody else
[1:20:40] is supposed to get nervous I say church
[1:20:42] it's time to start making Satan nervous
[1:20:44] amen it's time to be confident towards
[1:20:47] God like what's written here if our
[1:20:50] hearts don't condemn us then let's be
[1:20:52] confident toward towards God get your
[1:20:54] eyes off yourself get your eyes on the
[1:20:56] word and start being confident because
[1:20:59] this Spirit of power working in a bride
[1:21:01] it makes Satan very very nervous it did
[1:21:04] in Canaan and it's going to do it again
[1:21:05] this time remember what he said in
[1:21:07] Deuteronomy he says there shall be no
[1:21:10] man a be able to stand before you for
[1:21:13] the Lord your God shall lay the fear of
[1:21:15] who
[1:21:16] you lay the fear of you and the dread of
[1:21:19] you upon all the land that you shall
[1:21:22] tread upon as he has said unto you
[1:21:24] that's the spirit of power in a
[1:21:26] believer's life is it puts fear in
[1:21:28] Satan's kingdom because they know
[1:21:30] they're going to have to move very very
[1:21:33] soon they know things can't stay the way
[1:21:35] they are because Powers come in their
[1:21:37] way and it's in a bride that's anointed
[1:21:40] to do these things brother brah says it
[1:21:43] this way he says there's only two
[1:21:44] elements you can be controlled by that
[1:21:47] is either Faith or
[1:21:49] doubt a fear he says will accompany
[1:21:52] doubt if if you're fearing it's because
[1:21:53] you don't believe you don't believe as
[1:21:56] much as you ought to maybe I'll put it
[1:21:57] that way you've got more doubt than
[1:21:59] you've got faith and therefore fear can
[1:22:01] be in there Jesus said fear not Don't Be
[1:22:04] Afraid God keeps his word no matter what
[1:22:07] condition you are tonight God keeps his
[1:22:11] word Satan says you don't deserve it
[1:22:14] your condition ain't right you know what
[1:22:16] he's right but he's
[1:22:19] irrelevant Satan says a lot of things
[1:22:21] that don't matter there right but they
[1:22:23] don't matter we're in an unconditional
[1:22:26] Covenant Church you know what that means
[1:22:28] where you're at doesn't matter what you
[1:22:31] are in your flesh doesn't matter because
[1:22:34] he swore by himself cuz he could swear
[1:22:37] by no greater and he says I've got a
[1:22:39] bride and she is spotless she's without
[1:22:42] wrinkle she's my body she's my bone
[1:22:45] she's my flesh she is me and I am
[1:22:50] her that's what he said about about us
[1:22:53] Satan will say a lot of things about
[1:22:54] this flesh that are 100% true but
[1:22:56] they're Irrelevant in the word they're
[1:22:59] irrelevant when we look at Christ and
[1:23:00] the position he's put us in what's he
[1:23:02] doing he's trying to magnify us so we
[1:23:04] don't look at the Magnificent one the
[1:23:07] Savior the champion the Lord of Lord the
[1:23:10] King of Kings the Healer the deliverer
[1:23:13] that's what he's trying to get our eyes
[1:23:14] off of he's trying to say look at you
[1:23:16] and the scripture says our confidence is
[1:23:18] not in us our confidence is towards God
[1:23:21] Amen that's where we're resting
[1:23:23] I like what a brother said one time he
[1:23:24] said when a Christian wakes up in the
[1:23:26] morning every demon in Hell ought to be
[1:23:27] sounding alarms and saying look out
[1:23:30] they're
[1:23:32] awake Church we've been anointed to make
[1:23:36] life a living hell for
[1:23:39] demons that we would be so they would be
[1:23:41] so frustrated with us that they would
[1:23:44] say you take morine I'm sick and tired I
[1:23:47] can barely move she's got me black and
[1:23:50] blue you do it for a while
[1:23:53] her feet just hit the floor look out and
[1:23:57] not just our older ones but our younger
[1:23:59] ones as
[1:24:01] well that when they get up and they say
[1:24:04] we're going to try and put the world in
[1:24:05] front of them we're going to try and put
[1:24:06] fashion in front of them we're going to
[1:24:08] put worldly relationships in front of
[1:24:09] them we're going to try and throw rock
[1:24:10] and roll at them we're going to try and
[1:24:12] throw clothes at them they say you try
[1:24:14] it I've been trying it it ain't working
[1:24:16] I'm sick and tired I want an easier
[1:24:19] Target they ought to be frustrated with
[1:24:22] us the way we are frustrated with Satan
[1:24:24] so many times that's what we're meant to
[1:24:26] do we're meant to frustrate the kingdom
[1:24:29] of
[1:24:30] Satan that's our
[1:24:32] place brother Braham says this what we
[1:24:35] need today is a good oldfashioned Holy
[1:24:38] Ghost Revival to sweep the country to
[1:24:42] fill the people full of the vitamins of
[1:24:44] God's word where they'll know where
[1:24:46] they're standing and
[1:24:48] no know where they're standing and no
[1:24:51] you know that you know that you know
[1:24:53] it's a settled thing he says taking the
[1:24:55] fear out of the church now the people
[1:24:57] where we know that by Grace We're saved
[1:24:59] and we're filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:25:01] and sealed to the day of redemption yes
[1:25:03] sir it takes all the fear out Church
[1:25:05] we're not talking about a pep
[1:25:07] talk pep talks are good for the moment
[1:25:10] but they don't
[1:25:12] last we've got to have solid word-based
[1:25:15] preaching that lets you know where your
[1:25:18] foundation is so you know that you're
[1:25:20] standing on a place that you get to you
[1:25:22] get to hold that it belongs to you if
[1:25:24] it's word based that'll do it but if I
[1:25:26] get up here and I get you all rah rah R
[1:25:28] up that ain't going to hold cuz that's
[1:25:29] just the words of a man there could be
[1:25:32] an anointing here but that's not going
[1:25:34] to hold you if you don't have a resting
[1:25:36] place in the word of God pep talks are
[1:25:38] no good pep talks won't drive the fear
[1:25:41] out knowing who you are and where you
[1:25:43] stand will drive the fear out knowing
[1:25:45] you're a child of God filled with the
[1:25:46] Holy Ghost that's what's going to take
[1:25:47] it out brother BR says this he says When
[1:25:50] Faith takes a hold fear drops away I
[1:25:53] love this line he says Faith's got big
[1:25:55] muscles and a hairy
[1:25:58] chest he says when it speaks everything
[1:26:00] else keeps quiet cancer has to shut up
[1:26:03] Sister Sister Betty doesn't it cancer
[1:26:05] has to shut up praise the
[1:26:07] Lord he says and get out of the way
[1:26:09] tumor tuberculosis the rest of them
[1:26:11] moves out when Faith raises up and says
[1:26:14] set down that settles it the power of
[1:26:16] the devil sure he has the power and the
[1:26:18] reign of death but the second power that
[1:26:20] was given was faith and Faith put put
[1:26:22] Satan to
[1:26:23] shame he says certainly it does oh if we
[1:26:26] could only accumulate that kind of Faith
[1:26:28] tonight get that kind of Faith living
[1:26:31] amongst us mainly moving in our beings
[1:26:34] moving through the church now watch what
[1:26:35] he says not just the emotional Faith
[1:26:39] there's an emotional faith and it can
[1:26:42] only do so much it's still Faith but he
[1:26:45] says what not just the emotional Faith
[1:26:48] but a real Solid Faith what does that
[1:26:50] look like brother brandham a real real
[1:26:52] Solid Faith that won't take no for an
[1:26:57] answer he says know that God said so and
[1:27:00] that settles it what be perseverant
[1:27:03] there's power in perseverance to say I
[1:27:06] will not let you go until you bless me
[1:27:10] like Jacob did that you hold on and you
[1:27:12] hold on and you hold on until he does
[1:27:15] what he said he was going to
[1:27:17] do not an emotional Faith but a real
[1:27:20] Solid Faith that won't take no for an
[1:27:23] answer now that's where we start to
[1:27:25] transfer over now to the power of a
[1:27:27] sound mind now generally speaking when
[1:27:30] fear comes it it comes from looking at
[1:27:32] two things looking at yourself or
[1:27:35] looking at the situation or putting the
[1:27:37] two of them together now we get fearful
[1:27:40] because we know we aren't able to manage
[1:27:41] or control
[1:27:43] situations certainly when it involves
[1:27:45] people I can't I can't force you to do
[1:27:47] anything I can't force you to be
[1:27:49] anything I can't force you to respond a
[1:27:50] certain way and so we look look at
[1:27:52] things and we know we're not up to the
[1:27:54] task it's either out of our hands or
[1:27:55] it's too much to handle if we do have it
[1:27:57] in our hands Satan gets us looking at
[1:28:00] how poorly we handled it the last
[1:28:03] time he gets us looking at the
[1:28:05] personalities involved he gets us
[1:28:06] looking at the the the the the the the
[1:28:09] things that we've gone through in the
[1:28:10] past and he'll pull up every negative
[1:28:12] aspect of the of our past performance
[1:28:14] and say you can't handle it and you know
[1:28:16] what he's right but he's
[1:28:21] irrelevant
[1:28:23] but if he can't get you looking at
[1:28:24] yourself then he'll get you focused on
[1:28:27] the situation itself and he'll look at
[1:28:29] the impossibilities and the twists and
[1:28:30] the turns and the complexities and the
[1:28:32] years of history and the personalities
[1:28:34] and you know how they are and it ain't
[1:28:35] never change and they ain't never going
[1:28:37] to
[1:28:39] change sometimes we need to
[1:28:41] change but in it all he'll make you
[1:28:43] fearful that you can't sort it out and
[1:28:45] it'll just keep going the way it's
[1:28:46] always been
[1:28:48] going and then he'll take the two of
[1:28:51] them together and we'll compare our
[1:28:53] inability to the horribleness of the
[1:28:55] situation or the greatness required to
[1:28:57] get out of it and that causes us to
[1:28:59] worry and fear and stress and all of a
[1:29:01] sudden it takes the health right out of
[1:29:03] us stress is a killer we're going to
[1:29:05] read a quote where brother B talks about
[1:29:06] stress and worry it's a killer he says
[1:29:08] it's the greatest killer we've got but
[1:29:11] God has a remedy amen and it's the power
[1:29:13] of a sound mind now listen to this list
[1:29:16] in Isaiah
[1:29:17] 41 he says fear thou not for I am with
[1:29:22] thee what's he doing look to me I'm with
[1:29:26] you don't be scared cuz it's you be
[1:29:28] don't be scared cuz it's with it's me
[1:29:30] that's with you he says be not dismayed
[1:29:33] for I am thy God church is he God or is
[1:29:37] he thy God there's a difference yeah I
[1:29:41] saw a um there's a a well-known us
[1:29:44] female soccer
[1:29:46] player she is uh alternate lifestyle she
[1:29:50] def definitely doesn't believe in God
[1:29:52] but she had a uh a press conference the
[1:29:54] other day and she said if there is a she
[1:29:58] she said if there is any doubt there
[1:29:59] isn't a God she says what happened to me
[1:30:01] in my final game is proof that there
[1:30:03] isn't a God cuz she was in her last game
[1:30:05] before she retired and a couple minutes
[1:30:06] in she got a a uh career- ending injury
[1:30:10] so she didn't get to really play and she
[1:30:12] said that's proof there's God as if God
[1:30:14] would only do something good for her and
[1:30:17] that's the only way she believe in a god
[1:30:19] a woman that is Antichrist in every
[1:30:21] aspect effect of her life and then she
[1:30:23] says because God didn't do what God
[1:30:25] should have done that's proof that there
[1:30:26] isn't a god at all why he's just God to
[1:30:29] her but he's my God and he's your God
[1:30:32] and that's the way he's got to be he's
[1:30:34] got to you got to be able to say he's my
[1:30:36] Lord we sing that song He's My Lord
[1:30:39] there is no other one he's got to be
[1:30:41] your Lord you got to be able to say Lord
[1:30:43] you are my God and I'm coming to you
[1:30:45] because you're
[1:30:46] mine he says for I am thy God I will
[1:30:50] strengthen thee strengthen y I will help
[1:30:54] thee y I will uphold thee with the right
[1:30:57] hand of my righteousness now I read that
[1:30:59] word be not dismayed and and I looked it
[1:31:01] up in the dictionary and dismay means to
[1:31:03] cause to feel consternation or distress
[1:31:06] to worry or to be alarmed and that's our
[1:31:09] definition today that's the modern
[1:31:11] definition but when you go into the
[1:31:12] scripture and see what they actually
[1:31:14] mean there that word dismay means to
[1:31:16] look at to regard to gaze at or to look
[1:31:20] around so what's God saying he's saying
[1:31:23] don't look
[1:31:26] around talking about the SP Spirit of a
[1:31:29] of a sound mind he says don't look at
[1:31:32] what you can see because everything that
[1:31:35] the Israelites faced everything the Jews
[1:31:37] faced was greater than them bigger more
[1:31:40] powerful uh more money whatever you want
[1:31:42] to talk about every time they're going
[1:31:44] into these things what they looked at
[1:31:46] was greater than what they had or what
[1:31:48] they were or what they brought to the
[1:31:50] table amen what what does that mean
[1:31:52] don't be a looker be a
[1:31:55] believer amen it's not what you can see
[1:31:58] that you can defeat it's what you
[1:31:59] believe you can defeat amen where would
[1:32:02] say it's not the size of the dog and the
[1:32:03] fight it's the size of the fight and the
[1:32:04] dog you got to recognize that there's
[1:32:06] someone inside of you that's really
[1:32:07] doing the fight and he's the one that's
[1:32:09] greater than whatever you're facing no
[1:32:11] one got anywhere with God by looking at
[1:32:14] natural things you can't show me a
[1:32:17] single person in the scripture that ever
[1:32:18] said oh yeah there's something natural
[1:32:20] that's going to bring me closer to God
[1:32:21] in the sense of it brought them to a
[1:32:23] place of Faith No they believed and then
[1:32:25] God
[1:32:26] followed they believed and then God did
[1:32:28] the work nobody's looking around saying
[1:32:30] oh yeah that proves God therefore I'm
[1:32:31] going to no no no they believe God and
[1:32:33] then God came behind and Vindicated his
[1:32:35] word but we need to turn our scriptural
[1:32:38] Eyes On Jesus amen look full in his
[1:32:40] wonderful face and the things of this
[1:32:42] world will grow strangely dim in the
[1:32:43] light of his glory and grace brother BR
[1:32:46] or the scripture says this thou wil keep
[1:32:49] him in perfect peace
[1:32:52] whose mind is stayed on thee why because
[1:32:56] he trusteth in
[1:32:59] thee Isaiah
[1:33:02] 59 behold the Lord's hand is not
[1:33:04] shortened that it cannot save neither
[1:33:07] his ear heavy that it cannot hear in
[1:33:09] other words God hasn't changed God
[1:33:11] hasn't lost power God hasn't lost
[1:33:14] ability what's he saying is is you need
[1:33:17] you think somebody's so far gone that
[1:33:18] God can't reach all the way down he says
[1:33:20] God's arm's not so short it can't get
[1:33:21] there what he's done for others he can
[1:33:23] do for them his ear is not closed as
[1:33:26] long as the bride here there's Mercy as
[1:33:29] long as the bride is here there's blood
[1:33:30] to cover a multitude of sins everything
[1:33:33] is still available to people today I
[1:33:35] don't understand these people that
[1:33:37] preach that The Mercy Seat is closed I
[1:33:39] don't understand it because if they are
[1:33:40] we're all lost we need the blood of
[1:33:43] Jesus Christ every single day and if The
[1:33:46] Mercy Seat is closed then we don't have
[1:33:47] the blood to cover
[1:33:50] us he says it's not shorten that it
[1:33:53] cannot save neither is ears heavy that
[1:33:55] it cannot
[1:33:59] hear Brother Braham says it this way as
[1:34:03] long and as long as there is an eternity
[1:34:06] Christ will ever be the Savior and the
[1:34:09] way out of every problem every
[1:34:11] difference every trial everything you
[1:34:15] tell me what fits doesn't fit inside of
[1:34:17] that
[1:34:18] church he'll always be the Savior the
[1:34:21] way out of every
[1:34:22] problem every difference we get
[1:34:25] differences amongst us don't we he says
[1:34:28] of every trial and everything and
[1:34:30] therefore we when we are tied to him we
[1:34:32] don't get flustered and all worked up
[1:34:34] like all the world does but oh what will
[1:34:36] we do about this and what will we do
[1:34:37] about that we seem as if we're not even
[1:34:40] anchored but a man who has anchored his
[1:34:43] soul into Christ Jesus his trust is
[1:34:45] there knowing that when he asks the
[1:34:48] father anything in his name Jesus said
[1:34:49] I'll do it that said settles it it's the
[1:34:52] amen it's the absolute it's the ultimate
[1:34:56] when Jesus said ask the father anything
[1:34:58] in my name I'll Grant it he says now
[1:34:59] that's an ultimate that's
[1:35:01] it whatever you have need of When you
[1:35:06] pray what do you
[1:35:09] do
[1:35:13] believe believe that you receive it you
[1:35:16] shall have it that settles it that's all
[1:35:18] of it see if we're really anchored
[1:35:22] and believe it and we've made him our
[1:35:25] absolute there's the if and again if we
[1:35:29] really if we're really anchored and we
[1:35:31] believe it and we've made him our
[1:35:33] absolute cuz he does he is the absolute
[1:35:35] that takes us from all fear there's no
[1:35:37] fear when you're really tied to the Rock
[1:35:39] of Ages and when a man can pray the
[1:35:41] prayer of faith and anchor his soul
[1:35:43] Yonder in the word of God where all
[1:35:44] heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:35:46] that word cannot there is no fear let
[1:35:50] them come say whatever they want to our
[1:35:52] faith is in God and God Alone we believe
[1:35:55] it Church where's our anchor this
[1:35:57] morning we sang about it in
[1:35:59] service is our anchor in Christ the
[1:36:02] word you know he he says you've got to
[1:36:05] make him your absolute how do you know
[1:36:07] what your absolute is it's your first
[1:36:09] stop not your last
[1:36:12] stop it's the first place you go not the
[1:36:15] last place you go it's your source of
[1:36:18] help in a time of trouble it's your
[1:36:21] source of knowledge of direction of
[1:36:23] understanding it is everything you need
[1:36:25] is there and that's where you go you
[1:36:27] know he's your absolute when that's
[1:36:28] where you're going first off you don't
[1:36:31] go talk to a preacher you don't go talk
[1:36:32] to a Believer you go into the word of
[1:36:34] God and you pray before him and you say
[1:36:36] Lord You're my absolute show me your
[1:36:38] will and
[1:36:39] way because he's got the answer he's got
[1:36:42] the answer every single
[1:36:44] time when he's your absolute we go to
[1:36:47] him
[1:36:48] first brother B says you got to get away
[1:36:50] from your your own thoughts we're
[1:36:52] talking about the power of a sound
[1:36:54] mind that means my thoughts are not part
[1:36:56] of a sound mind he says you got to let
[1:36:59] the mind that was in Christ be in you
[1:37:02] you've got to stay there Watch What
[1:37:04] Happens now when we have a sound mind
[1:37:06] the mind of Christ till every sin of
[1:37:09] fear every sin of Doubt has gone from
[1:37:12] your heart and if you're there and God
[1:37:15] doesn't take you and omit your sins and
[1:37:17] send you into the presence of God he
[1:37:19] says there is something wrong with your
[1:37:22] experience now here's the thing remember
[1:37:25] I think it was job said that which I
[1:37:27] feared has come upon
[1:37:28] me sometimes we dwell on things that are
[1:37:31] going to cause us to
[1:37:33] fear and we got to get back what in the
[1:37:36] presence of God that's what this tells
[1:37:38] me we got to get in the presence of God
[1:37:41] when we're in fear when we're in worry
[1:37:42] when we're in stress we got to get to
[1:37:44] where he is because that's where that
[1:37:46] will get taken away the power of the
[1:37:48] Holy Spirit In Our Lives is there to
[1:37:49] take us away get us in this presence of
[1:37:51] God get us in a spirit of worship get us
[1:37:53] in a spirit of Praise get us in a spirit
[1:37:55] of Thanksgiving get us in a spirit of
[1:37:58] expectation get us set up to receive
[1:38:00] what he's got coming our way because our
[1:38:02] attitude will hold it back our our
[1:38:05] approach to these things amen if we can
[1:38:07] create an atmosphere of Faith where the
[1:38:09] the the spirit of God can nurture us and
[1:38:12] and grow us and mature us and get us
[1:38:14] ready for what he wants us to do or what
[1:38:16] he has for us it'll make a difference
[1:38:18] amen put on a sermon
[1:38:22] put on some worshipful
[1:38:24] music listen to this
[1:38:27] now not entertaining
[1:38:30] music as Believers we can have
[1:38:33] entertaining music and there ain't
[1:38:34] nothing wrong with it but it won't take
[1:38:36] you into the presence of
[1:38:38] God some songs are wonderful and the
[1:38:42] music's great and the vocals are great
[1:38:45] but it won't take you into the presence
[1:38:46] of God it's amazing it's beautiful but
[1:38:50] it ain't true worship
[1:38:52] but can I say something else brother
[1:38:53] Steve Bron said this and it stuck with
[1:38:55] me way back when he said don't go for
[1:38:58] melancholy music either you know why
[1:39:01] because Melancholy music affirms you
[1:39:03] where you are rather than takes you to
[1:39:05] where you need to be what it does
[1:39:08] melancholy music is empathetic
[1:39:10] empathetic rather than
[1:39:13] Victorious it says you're right to feel
[1:39:15] this
[1:39:16] way that's not going to help
[1:39:19] you you need to get out of where you're
[1:39:21] at you need music that'll take you out
[1:39:23] of that that means you got to get
[1:39:25] worship that'll that that'll lift you up
[1:39:28] that'll take you into the presence of
[1:39:29] God that'll remind you what God has said
[1:39:31] about you what God has done for you amen
[1:39:34] was it was it Watchman KNE that that
[1:39:35] that did that book practicing the
[1:39:37] presence of God something like that I
[1:39:38] don't know if it was Watchman KN but I
[1:39:40] think we need to start practicing the
[1:39:42] presence of God even the prophet
[1:39:44] remember had to call a musician to get
[1:39:48] into the presence of God sometimes he
[1:39:50] was so angry I think it was Jehoshaphat
[1:39:53] again wasn't it went down and they he
[1:39:54] ended up telling them you have to dig
[1:39:55] ditches and that you'll get the water
[1:39:57] you need and these different things but
[1:39:58] he was
[1:39:59] flustered he was flustered he was angry
[1:40:02] he was disappointed and so he said call
[1:40:04] a
[1:40:05] Minstrel and then after the minstrel
[1:40:07] came after the musician came and played
[1:40:08] a while it calmed the prophet down to
[1:40:11] where he could actually hear the voice
[1:40:13] of God because otherwise you know what
[1:40:15] would have happened Church he'd have
[1:40:17] presumed and he'd have probably spoke
[1:40:19] judgment rather than the will of
[1:40:22] God you know what happens sometimes is
[1:40:25] we walk we try and walk into the
[1:40:26] presence of God flustered and stressed
[1:40:29] and worried and we need to actually set
[1:40:31] ourselves in an atmosphere to calm us
[1:40:33] down so we can actually hear the voice
[1:40:35] of God and you know what'll do it the
[1:40:38] right kind of music music is a powerful
[1:40:42] thing absolutely powerful there's a
[1:40:44] reason why we start a church with
[1:40:46] worship why to set an atmosphere so you
[1:40:50] can receive the preaching of the word
[1:40:53] that tells me that if you're not in a
[1:40:55] mood to receive it then you need to get
[1:40:56] in a mood to receive it before you can
[1:40:58] receive it and music is the ordained way
[1:41:00] to generally do that you can put on a
[1:41:02] sermon that'll be fine whatever you want
[1:41:04] to do but something that'll calm you
[1:41:06] down that'll settle your spirit and
[1:41:08] that'll set your attitude right to to
[1:41:10] approach God and receive what God's got
[1:41:11] for
[1:41:13] you we've got to give ourselves a chance
[1:41:15] to get settled before we go in and dump
[1:41:17] everything on God settle down look what
[1:41:21] brother Bram says now we're talking
[1:41:22] about this young lady I mentioned
[1:41:23] earlier he's going to pray for
[1:41:26] her he's just prayed for her she's been
[1:41:29] delivered and she was she was all worked
[1:41:32] up he says no don't fear young lady look
[1:41:35] will you do as I tell you now you feel
[1:41:38] all right at this time because it's gone
[1:41:40] okay he's prayed he's cast it off of her
[1:41:43] when you come up here there was a dark
[1:41:44] shadow around you and it's gone now he
[1:41:46] says it scared you you can't help it it
[1:41:49] comes to you he he says but look now the
[1:41:51] unclean spirit's gone from you he walks
[1:41:53] in dry fa dry places now listen to this
[1:41:56] he says he will try to return again but
[1:42:00] you just take my word as God's Prophet
[1:42:03] here's her answer don't you never have a
[1:42:06] frown on your
[1:42:08] face does that seem
[1:42:11] impossible listen to this sing all day
[1:42:15] long and praise God no matter how you
[1:42:20] feel
[1:42:21] of what takes place notice he didn't say
[1:42:23] you'd always feel good he didn't say
[1:42:25] you'll never fear
[1:42:27] fearful feel
[1:42:29] fearful but he said sing and praise no
[1:42:32] matter what you feel feeling's not the
[1:42:35] problem letting the feeling take over is
[1:42:37] the problem and he says to counteract
[1:42:39] that sing all day long and praise God
[1:42:42] you got to keep that void filled up you
[1:42:44] got to keep something there to
[1:42:46] counteract what Satan's going to send
[1:42:47] your way he says or whatever takes place
[1:42:50] he says it'll leave you and it won't
[1:42:52] come no more now go do that you believe
[1:42:54] with all your heart he says that's right
[1:42:56] that's a killer kills more people than
[1:42:58] anything else but Christ is a savior
[1:43:00] they that walk upright before God he
[1:43:02] said he withhold no good thing from
[1:43:07] them praise the Lord he'll withhold no
[1:43:10] good thing from you but sometimes you
[1:43:12] got to keep an attitude of spirit and
[1:43:13] praise about you
[1:43:16] Amen brother R says it this way he says
[1:43:18] but you know if you're determined to see
[1:43:20] God
[1:43:21] God will make a way for you and there's
[1:43:23] no fear at all about nothing you just
[1:43:26] have one
[1:43:27] achievement one
[1:43:29] thought one motive one objective and
[1:43:34] that is one thing get to God he says and
[1:43:38] if God spoke to you you'll go I don't
[1:43:40] care what takes place God will make a
[1:43:43] way for you to do it if you're really
[1:43:45] anchored and know what you're speaking
[1:43:48] of that means we got to get in his
[1:43:50] presence and find out what he wants let
[1:43:52] him speak to us not just when it's
[1:43:55] coming over the pulpit like this but day
[1:43:57] by day by day let him just feed that
[1:43:59] word into us I saw I don't have the
[1:44:02] quote here with me but brother Bram says
[1:44:04] we need to feed this Engine with the
[1:44:07] word it's the only thing we run on the
[1:44:09] only thing a Believer runs on is the
[1:44:11] word of God the Holy Spirit feeds on the
[1:44:14] word of God your your Godlike nature
[1:44:17] inside of you that he's given you feeds
[1:44:18] on the word of God you got to feed it
[1:44:20] with the word and nothing else will take
[1:44:22] its
[1:44:23] place as good as music is it won't take
[1:44:26] the place of the word but it'll prepare
[1:44:28] you for it see music's great for
[1:44:31] feeling it's great for attitude but it
[1:44:34] won't do the work but it'll prepare you
[1:44:37] for the
[1:44:38] work but we want to talk as we just
[1:44:40] start to close now we're going to talk
[1:44:42] about the spirit of love that's the
[1:44:44] greatest weapon of all and we preached
[1:44:45] on that and I'm not going to belabor it
[1:44:47] this evening but I want you to
[1:44:48] understand one thing love works opposite
[1:44:50] to to fear love and fear are at complete
[1:44:52] opposites they're they're diametrically
[1:44:54] opposed they're at the opposite sides of
[1:44:56] the table or the circle I want to show
[1:44:58] what this looks like and in in the Book
[1:45:00] of Ruth Boaz is speaking to Ruth and
[1:45:02] they've had their their little meeting
[1:45:04] on the threshing floor and and he's
[1:45:07] expressed his desire to marry her and
[1:45:08] all of these things and and she's
[1:45:10] probably a little bit worried and he
[1:45:12] says to her now my daughter fear not I
[1:45:16] will do to thee all that thou requirest
[1:45:22] that's an absolute
[1:45:23] statement he says for all the city of my
[1:45:26] people do know that thou art a virtuous
[1:45:28] woman so Boaz is trying to set Ruth at
[1:45:30] ease that he's not going to back away
[1:45:31] from his promise and notice what he says
[1:45:34] he says Ruth you're a good
[1:45:36] woman that's what Christ says about us
[1:45:38] church that's the only one we ought to
[1:45:41] be listening to when it comes to our
[1:45:42] condition or our position is what our
[1:45:44] husband says and he says you're a
[1:45:47] virtuous bride you're a virtuous woman
[1:45:49] you're my my choice you're my thoughts
[1:45:52] you're my elected bride that's what I
[1:45:54] want to hear that's the voice that I
[1:45:56] want to listen to but notice what boas
[1:45:58] says he says I'll do all that you
[1:46:00] require now he didn't say I'll do
[1:46:02] everything you told me to do or
[1:46:04] everything you want me to do I'll said
[1:46:06] I'll he said I'll do everything you
[1:46:07] require in other words I'll do
[1:46:09] everything that is needed for you what
[1:46:11] your needs are I'll meet it whatever
[1:46:14] needs to be done to get you and I
[1:46:16] together I'm going to get it done and
[1:46:17] remember she goes back to to Naomi and
[1:46:20] Naomi says the exact same thing she says
[1:46:21] he's a good man he'll get it done don't
[1:46:24] worry about it sit back have some
[1:46:27] bread and just relax the man knows what
[1:46:30] he's doing and he's going to get it done
[1:46:32] nobody can stop him but what was Ruth's
[1:46:35] challenge Rest In Love rather than get
[1:46:39] all threatened with
[1:46:41] worry to say the first thing is he loves
[1:46:45] me he loves me that's our rest church is
[1:46:49] that he loves me
[1:46:51] my love for him waivers If we're honest
[1:46:54] based on our actions our love wavers our
[1:46:57] commitment waivers but his has never
[1:46:59] changed from the beginning and it will
[1:47:01] never change all the way through
[1:47:02] eternity he loves us and that's where
[1:47:05] our rest is amen he called us he chose
[1:47:09] us he changed us filled us with the Holy
[1:47:12] Ghost he forgave us and he's continued
[1:47:13] to work with us that's how we know he
[1:47:15] loves us is not just what he's done but
[1:47:17] what he's continuing to do he starts a
[1:47:19] work and he's going to be he's going to
[1:47:20] finish it amen this is what he Jesus
[1:47:23] said in or this is what John said he
[1:47:25] said in this was manifested the love of
[1:47:27] God towards us because that God sent his
[1:47:29] only begotten son into the world that we
[1:47:31] might live through him here in his love
[1:47:35] he says not that we love God that's not
[1:47:38] love he says but that he loved us and he
[1:47:42] sent his son to be the propitiation
[1:47:44] that's the atoning sacrifice for our
[1:47:46] sins and then in verse 18 He says there
[1:47:48] is no fear in love love that's an
[1:47:51] absolute you can't be in love and be in
[1:47:54] fear it doesn't work that way he says
[1:47:57] but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:48:00] because fear ha torment perfect love is
[1:48:04] the Holy Ghost In other words the Holy
[1:48:06] Ghost In You casts out fear that's God's
[1:48:09] sign that's God's token that's God's
[1:48:11] proof to you that you are signed sealed
[1:48:12] and delivered and there's nothing going
[1:48:14] to stop you and when you get the Holy
[1:48:16] Ghost that ought to be the Assurance in
[1:48:18] your heart that you don't have to fear
[1:48:19] anymore
[1:48:21] he says because fear had torment he that
[1:48:23] feareth is not made perfect in love so
[1:48:26] you can't be in love and in fear at the
[1:48:27] same time something's dominated he says
[1:48:31] but we love him because he first loved
[1:48:34] us when did he love me when I was
[1:48:37] perfect when I did the right thing no he
[1:48:38] loved us when we were unlovable when by
[1:48:41] every Godly standard there was nothing
[1:48:42] in us to love yet he loved us he gave
[1:48:45] his life for us he paid the price for us
[1:48:47] and now he's calling us and he's
[1:48:48] changing us and he's moving moving us
[1:48:50] back to our original condition amen
[1:48:52] we're not just under his love but we're
[1:48:54] in his love we're a part of him we're
[1:48:56] made a part of him amen we're bone of
[1:48:58] his bone flesh of his flesh and there's
[1:48:59] a security there's a just a a
[1:49:03] satisfaction that comes with knowing
[1:49:06] that he's working on me that he's given
[1:49:08] me this seal on my soul and he's not
[1:49:11] going to finish until he's changed this
[1:49:12] very body into a glorified body and
[1:49:14] brings me into his presence amen God's
[1:49:17] made us his choice he chose you he chose
[1:49:20] you brother Dale he chose you sister
[1:49:24] Rebecca he chose you called your name
[1:49:27] wrote your name before you did right or
[1:49:29] wrong good or bad he chose you you were
[1:49:33] in his thoughts you were in his mind you
[1:49:34] were built into him and now you're being
[1:49:36] expressed and he's come to draw you all
[1:49:38] the way back to him it's the security of
[1:49:40] being God's chosen bride that I'm
[1:49:42] talking
[1:49:43] about it's the power of love in our
[1:49:45] lives brother puts it this way he says a
[1:49:47] man that walks in Love Walks In in
[1:49:51] life and perfect love casteth out all
[1:49:54] fear he says then if here's the if if
[1:49:58] you can take him at his word and not
[1:49:59] fear a bit about it say Lord I love you
[1:50:02] you know you're going to I know you're
[1:50:04] going to answer because you promis me
[1:50:06] you would and I just know you're going
[1:50:08] to do it see it takes away all fear he
[1:50:12] says but when God says anything God
[1:50:15] stays with his
[1:50:17] word that he says you stay with it too
[1:50:21] God's going to stay with it so don't you
[1:50:22] move off of it but if you leave the word
[1:50:25] you leave God you leave your blessing
[1:50:27] and everything there he says stay and
[1:50:29] Obey God's word he says what God says
[1:50:32] God
[1:50:33] does you know as we start to close I've
[1:50:35] been dwelling a lot on something lately
[1:50:37] and it's this idea of
[1:50:39] torment and I'm preaching to myself here
[1:50:41] as much as this congregation but the
[1:50:43] scripture says fear has torment but
[1:50:45] perfect love casts out fear and I see
[1:50:49] torment
[1:50:50] I see tormented time and you know what
[1:50:52] it is is we've made it
[1:50:54] normal we've made it normal we've dealt
[1:50:58] with things for so long we've had things
[1:50:59] for so long that we've normalized it
[1:51:01] we've made it
[1:51:02] reasonable we've made it acceptable and
[1:51:05] you know the way we do that we look and
[1:51:07] we see other people that have it in the
[1:51:09] world but remember we're not of this
[1:51:12] world we're of a different Kingdom we
[1:51:15] have a different father we have a
[1:51:17] different Destiny what they have to deal
[1:51:19] with we don't have to deal with but
[1:51:22] we've got a world that'll put things on
[1:51:23] us and that'll prescribe things and tell
[1:51:25] us it can't be changed and nothing we
[1:51:27] can do about it and Satan starts running
[1:51:29] free in that area of our life because
[1:51:31] we've normalized what he's taken
[1:51:34] over we don't recognize that the ancient
[1:51:36] landmarks have been removed but the word
[1:51:39] of God is here to say you don't have to
[1:51:41] deal with
[1:51:42] it that's what the word is about it's to
[1:51:44] Quicken you to say I've been dealing
[1:51:46] with something I don't need to he's got
[1:51:49] me Bound in and I didn't even realize it
[1:51:52] and to set you free from those things
[1:51:55] Amen brother Braham says this way he
[1:51:58] says if you don't believe the Holy Ghost
[1:51:59] is right give it the same kind of try he
[1:52:03] says you might you might uh hear it on
[1:52:05] others but wait till it goes to work on
[1:52:07] you once then you'll know for sure that
[1:52:10] it is the gift of God can you say Amen
[1:52:12] to that this morning you that have the
[1:52:14] Holy Ghost when God goes to working on
[1:52:16] you through the Holy Ghost it changes
[1:52:19] you
[1:52:20] because here's the thing there's that
[1:52:22] that song I think I've quoted it before
[1:52:23] it says sometimes God calms the storm
[1:52:26] and other times he calms his child see
[1:52:29] the work is on you
[1:52:30] first he'll settle you no matter what
[1:52:34] sometimes he changes the situation
[1:52:35] sometimes he doesn't but the point is
[1:52:37] are you going to go through it all
[1:52:38] fretting and worried and stressed are
[1:52:40] you going to come through it calm and
[1:52:41] trusting and believing and relaxed in
[1:52:44] the love of God that he's given in You
[1:52:45] by the Holy
[1:52:46] Ghost he says it takes all temper all
[1:52:50] the sin all unbelief all doubts all
[1:52:55] fears he said even the fear of death
[1:52:57] goes away from you when the Holy Ghost
[1:52:59] comes in what's love the Holy Ghost When
[1:53:02] Love Comes in it takes all de fear of
[1:53:04] death away he says oh it's real friends
[1:53:06] if you've never received it don't let
[1:53:08] the night pass without receiving it what
[1:53:11] are we talking about church we're
[1:53:13] talking about letting the holy spirit of
[1:53:14] God flow through our lives in a way it's
[1:53:17] never
[1:53:18] before remember the problem is not that
[1:53:20] God's arm is shortened nor that he can't
[1:53:23] hear Brother bam says we got the flu all
[1:53:25] choked up all blocked up with unbelief
[1:53:29] with cares of this
[1:53:31] world right we've been looking too much
[1:53:33] and believing too

[1:53:37] message we've been listening to the
[1:53:39] wrong
[1:53:40] messenger anden we're supposed to be
[1:53:42] walking in the word living in the word
[1:53:44] believing in the word amen one
[1:53:48] experience in the Holy Ghost one one
[1:53:49] filling Church it'll get you to Eternity
[1:53:52] but we're not just meant to make it to
[1:53:54] Eternity we're supposed to walk we're
[1:53:57] supposed to overcome we're supposed to
[1:54:00] have Victory we're supposed to have
[1:54:01] peace Joy rest all in the Holy Ghost and
[1:54:06] that takes baptism after baptism that
[1:54:10] takes experience after experience let me
[1:54:13] ask the older couples do you love your
[1:54:15] spouse more than you did before I hope
[1:54:17] you do and what did it take experience
[1:54:21] after experience Time After Time what to

[1:54:30] couple than you've ever
[1:54:32] been CU you're in unity now in a way
[1:54:34] that you've never been by God's grace

[1:54:39] get satisfied with say well I got the
[1:54:40] Holy Ghost that's great you're sealed to
[1:54:42] the day of your Redemption but that's

[1:55:23] weight you got a

[1:55:50] people in the church he says lay it on
[1:55:52] the altar this morning and the fire of
[1:55:54] God will come down and take it right
[1:55:56] away what'll burn this place
[1:55:58] Supernatural power and authority he says

[1:56:24] stand together if we
[1:56:26] would I've been listening to God in
[1:56:28] Simplicity bit by bit and I'm at the
[1:56:30] very end and I was listening to it this
[1:56:32] morning brother bradam is encouraging
[1:56:34] the people because he's talked about God
[1:56:36] in Simplicity he's trying to show them
[1:56:38] God wants to dwell in
[1:56:40] you this isn't just for for ministering
[1:56:43] it's not just for select people in the
[1:56:45] Bible but he says it's for you and God
[1:56:47] wants to dwell in you and that's the
[1:56:48] Simplicity of it and he's encouraging
[1:56:50] them and he's encouraging them and he's
[1:56:52] encouraging them and he's praying and
[1:56:54] he's calling out and he's calling out

[1:57:10] here if you want it he says it's up to
[1:57:15] you that takes being in his presence to
[1:57:18] understand and after he says that then
[1:57:21] one by one you hear people just start to
[1:57:23] be set free in that church and one and

[1:58:22] every scenario figuring out how this was
[1:58:25] going to happen and if they do this then
[1:58:26] I'm going to do that and if they say
