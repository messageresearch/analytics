[1:01:46] Lush I felt like we was back in the old
[1:01:49] you know brush Harbor Revival days
[1:01:53] if there would have been 500 people here
[1:01:55] I think they'd have been clapping and
[1:01:56] shouting and glorifying God
[1:01:59] just because we're in a little building
[1:02:00] don't mean that you know we can't give a
[1:02:03] little noise
[1:02:04] because in a few weeks you're going to
[1:02:06] be in a bigger building so
[1:02:10] yeah you know amen I'm gonna let you
[1:02:13] have your seats for a moment
[1:02:15] well I just read something for you and I
[1:02:17] put the name of your church up again on
[1:02:20] this picture do you like that
[1:02:22] as it's just shining there over the
[1:02:25] Mountaintop
[1:02:28] here's a little something that we'll
[1:02:30] share
[1:02:31] and I think it goes along with your
[1:02:33] little church too and the vision of the
[1:02:36] ministry and each one of you and taking
[1:02:38] sides with Jesus in Jeffersonville
[1:02:41] brother Branham said we've got to think
[1:02:43] of the others that's coming on behind us
[1:02:46] these young people and so forth and a
[1:02:49] place for our children
[1:02:52] and we've got to make arrangements for
[1:02:54] that
[1:02:55] and if there is no tomorrow we don't
[1:02:57] know that if there is no tomorrow we
[1:03:00] haven't done nothing but been at the
[1:03:02] Masters business and been found at our
[1:03:06] post of Duty when he does come
[1:03:09] now brother John's been raised in the
[1:03:11] message from the Branham Tabernacle been
[1:03:13] born around the messages and things in
[1:03:16] all these years you know the Lord's
[1:03:18] coming the Lord's coming the Lord's
[1:03:20] coming and the Lord's coming and the
[1:03:22] Lord he's coming
[1:03:24] he's still coming I mean
[1:03:27] 2022 and he's still coming but as the
[1:03:31] coffees have gotten older and brother
[1:03:32] Lush and the different elders and you
[1:03:34] all have prepared a place and then But
[1:03:37] as God is moving you forward we've got
[1:03:39] to think of uh those that are coming on
[1:03:41] behind us
[1:03:43] these young people and so forth and make
[1:03:45] a place for our children and we've got
[1:03:48] to make arrangements for that
[1:03:51] and I pray the Lord will bless your
[1:03:53] Arrangements
[1:03:54] and bless what God is doing because we
[1:03:57] don't know if there's going to be a
[1:03:58] tomorrow that's right we don't know if
[1:04:00] there might be another three years I
[1:04:02] mean I'll be honest with you if somebody
[1:04:05] would have said in the in the 60s or 70s
[1:04:08] that we were going to hit the year 2000
[1:04:11] they probably would have said you're
[1:04:13] backslidden
[1:04:15] you know the Lord's coming the Lord's
[1:04:17] coming I mean 77 80s 90 2000.
[1:04:22] 2010
[1:04:24] 2022 I mean they would have shook their
[1:04:27] head and said no way brother you know
[1:04:29] we're we're not going to be here and and
[1:04:32] my parents said they're not going to get
[1:04:33] married they're not going to have
[1:04:35] children and they're not going to have
[1:04:36] grandchildren now they have great
[1:04:38] grandchildren so friends we we never
[1:04:41] want to get stuck in our minds we want
[1:04:43] to stay stuck in the mind of Christ and
[1:04:46] let's make arrangements for one another
[1:04:50] and before we read our scripture I'll
[1:04:52] share this quote with you out of
[1:04:53] Jeffersonville on the influence of
[1:04:56] another brother Branham said oh your
[1:04:58] family's what you are you raise your
[1:05:01] child in a certain environment it's got
[1:05:04] a 98
[1:05:06] better chance to go right than it has to
[1:05:10] if you bring it up in the wrong way
[1:05:13] I put a picture there of some Eagles the
[1:05:16] adult Eagles and the and the younger
[1:05:19] Eagles in the nest
[1:05:21] and brother Branham is quoting this
[1:05:23] scripture bring up a child in the way
[1:05:25] that it should go and when it's old
[1:05:27] it'll not depart from it he said be
[1:05:30] brought upright teach your children to
[1:05:32] do right to be honest and to be square
[1:05:36] and fair even when they're in school
[1:05:40] now I think 98 is a pretty good percent
[1:05:43] what do you all think
[1:05:45] if you raise your children right in a
[1:05:47] good environment it's got a 98 percent
[1:05:50] better chance to go right than it has to
[1:05:53] if you bring it up in the wrong way I
[1:05:55] believe we're raising up our children in
[1:05:57] the right way
[1:05:58] I believe they have a good chance to
[1:06:00] make it in the rapture
[1:06:03] come on friends I mean do you all
[1:06:04] believe that or are we in the wrong
[1:06:06] church today or we believe in a wrong
[1:06:09] message are we teaching them wrong
[1:06:10] things I hope not friends
[1:06:12] even our singing and our testimonies and
[1:06:15] our special services like this ought to
[1:06:17] be where even our younger children or
[1:06:19] our teenagers or our families that we
[1:06:22] can go home and say that it touched our
[1:06:24] daily lives I I don't want to be guilty
[1:06:27] of just preaching way over people's head
[1:06:29] I don't think that we need to preach
[1:06:31] Mysteries the mystery's already been
[1:06:34] Unleashed amen and I don't want you
[1:06:36] leaving the church services thinking wow
[1:06:39] brother John is so deep in the word and
[1:06:42] then when I say well what was preached
[1:06:44] you say well
[1:06:45] um I don't know what was said you know I
[1:06:48] don't want that we want to get it we
[1:06:50] want to get it and we want one another
[1:06:52] to get it and this weekend has been
[1:06:54] really special and unique and and we
[1:06:57] felt to speak messages that were close
[1:06:59] to your hearts on on Friday night we
[1:07:02] spoke on which son are you of the
[1:07:05] prodigal son or an elder son and then
[1:07:08] last night we spoke on I will restore
[1:07:11] and today I'd like to speak on Christ
[1:07:14] ministers to the poor
[1:07:17] Christ ministers to the poor
[1:07:19] kind of an unusual subject to speak on a
[1:07:23] Sunday morning but as we're going to see
[1:07:25] by the word of God I want to encourage
[1:07:27] you I really want you to feel encouraged
[1:07:29] and strengthened today it's the number
[1:07:32] one thing that Christ said and we're
[1:07:35] going to read it here if you want to
[1:07:36] turn to Luke Chapter 4. it's the number
[1:07:39] one thing that identifies the ministry
[1:07:42] of Jesus Christ was he came to preach
[1:07:46] the gospel to the poor
[1:07:49] and you're going to find that in brother
[1:07:50] branham's life also how he was a poor
[1:07:54] man and poor in the ministry and and the
[1:07:58] people that surrounded brother branham's
[1:08:00] Ministry wasn't rich and famous people a
[1:08:03] lot of them were poor and down and
[1:08:04] outers and cots and stretchers Jesus his
[1:08:08] he was born in a poor family his mother
[1:08:11] when she came to bring offerings on his
[1:08:14] um dedication day brought turtle doves
[1:08:17] and if you look in the Book of Leviticus
[1:08:20] that's actually an offering of a poor
[1:08:23] family
[1:08:24] they didn't even couldn't even afford a
[1:08:26] lamb and and if he couldn't afford a
[1:08:28] lamb when bring turtle doves so Jesus
[1:08:31] Joseph and Mary were not rich people
[1:08:35] y'all are a little quiet that means
[1:08:37] you're listening right
[1:08:38] well it's a real trademark of Believers
[1:08:41] then you don't have to Aspire to be rich
[1:08:43] or famous or you don't have to Aspire
[1:08:46] your number one goal in life shouldn't
[1:08:48] just be to attend a big university or
[1:08:51] college or you know to live in a big
[1:08:53] house or drive a fancy car we're here to
[1:08:56] seek first the kingdom of God and his
[1:08:59] righteousness
[1:09:01] so maybe the Lord just asked brother
[1:09:03] John to speak a simple message
[1:09:06] to maybe encourage someone in your daily
[1:09:09] life that'll just take away some of that
[1:09:12] strain and I want to say today and
[1:09:15] you'll pick it up throughout the the
[1:09:16] service I don't want you to get a
[1:09:19] complex in your life that you are poor
[1:09:23] I don't want you to be embarrassed
[1:09:25] or ever ashamed
[1:09:27] that you're poor
[1:09:29] I don't want you to be embarrassed or
[1:09:31] hang your head as a Christian as a
[1:09:33] message believer or a carrier complex
[1:09:36] that you're never good enough or we've
[1:09:38] got to be a certain standard or we got
[1:09:40] to do a certain thing I've been called
[1:09:42] today from the west coast to the east
[1:09:45] coast to just talk to you like that
[1:09:48] and the way I'm going to deliver the
[1:09:50] word is even very important I want you
[1:09:52] to feel real settled when you leave here
[1:09:54] today that okay I might not have
[1:09:57] everything that the world might have or
[1:09:59] what I might have but I have the Lord I
[1:10:03] have spiritual things and by the end of
[1:10:06] the service as brother coffee let us let
[1:10:08] let the poor say I am rich
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:12] that ought to be our confession we're
[1:10:14] not poor we're not down and outers we're
[1:10:16] not kicking a rock down the road and
[1:10:18] never gonna make it nowhere no no we're
[1:10:20] going in a rapture
[1:10:23] so let's stand and turn to this very
[1:10:25] familiar scripture that I know your
[1:10:26] ministers have read many times
[1:10:29] Faithfully Luke chapter 4.
[1:10:34] and it's been so an honor to speak to
[1:10:36] you and you've made us feel right at
[1:10:37] home and met all our needs and I just
[1:10:41] pray the Lord would just come through
[1:10:42] his word now
[1:10:44] and just minister to your heart
[1:10:47] Luke chapter 4 we find in verse 14 Jesus
[1:10:51] returning back to the place where he was
[1:10:54] born in Nazareth and he returned in the
[1:10:57] power of the spirit into Galilee and
[1:11:00] there went out of Fame of him through
[1:11:02] all the region round about and he taught
[1:11:04] in their synagogues being glorified of
[1:11:07] all
[1:11:08] and he came to Nazareth
[1:11:10] where he had been brought up and as his
[1:11:13] custom was
[1:11:14] he went into the synagogue on the
[1:11:17] Sabbath day and stood up for to read
[1:11:21] so Jesus believed in going to church
[1:11:24] and there was delivered unto him
[1:11:27] the book A Certain book
[1:11:29] a certain Prophet messenger
[1:11:32] that was for his day
[1:11:35] a certain book was given to Jesus of the
[1:11:39] prophet isaiahs
[1:11:41] and when he had opened the book he found
[1:11:44] the place where it was written
[1:11:46] why did he go to this verse
[1:11:49] why was it so important
[1:11:52] why is the very first thing when he says
[1:11:55] in verse 18 the spirit of the Lord is
[1:11:58] upon me
[1:12:00] did he just run around the temple
[1:12:03] did he just grab a hanky and wave it and
[1:12:05] start screaming and yelling
[1:12:07] no the very first thing that he did when
[1:12:11] the spirit of the Lord came upon him and
[1:12:14] he he began to speak he hath anointed me
[1:12:17] to preach the gospel to the poor
[1:12:21] amen it's the number one thing have you
[1:12:25] ever even thought of that before
[1:12:26] the number one thing that he said when
[1:12:29] he was anointed was
[1:12:32] I don't want the poor people to feel
[1:12:34] like you're forgotten
[1:12:36] that's that's quite amazing I want you
[1:12:38] to ponder this today this is this is
[1:12:40] pretty incredible
[1:12:42] this is the Lord Jesus being anointed
[1:12:45] to preach the gospel to the poor
[1:12:48] he hath sent me to heal the
[1:12:51] brokenhearted that's what our sister
[1:12:53] sang about
[1:12:55] about the remedy
[1:12:57] is Jesus Christ
[1:12:59] to preach Deliverance to the captives
[1:13:03] and recovering of sight to the blind
[1:13:06] to set at Liberty them that are bruised
[1:13:10] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:13:13] Lord
[1:13:14] that's pretty incredible
[1:13:17] did he take up a rod and start beating
[1:13:19] the people
[1:13:21] did he start yelling at them when he was
[1:13:23] anointed when the spirit of the Lord
[1:13:25] Came Upon Jesus did he all start finding
[1:13:28] all their faults and all their
[1:13:29] weaknesses and is that what he did I
[1:13:32] want you to notice his approach was as
[1:13:35] I've come
[1:13:36] to minister to the poor
[1:13:39] and he closed the book verse 20.
[1:13:42] and he gave it again to the minister and
[1:13:45] sat down
[1:13:47] and the eyes of all them that were in
[1:13:49] the synagogue were fastened on him
[1:13:52] and he began to say unto them this day
[1:13:56] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[1:14:01] and all bear him witness and wondered at
[1:14:04] the gracious Words which proceeded out
[1:14:06] of his mouth and they said is not this
[1:14:09] Joseph's son it's amazing how you can be
[1:14:12] in a supernatural atmosphere and
[1:14:14] people's minds are already so carnal I
[1:14:16] mean you know isn't he Joseph's son I
[1:14:18] mean oh the preacher has glasses oh look
[1:14:21] at his tie that he's wearing today look
[1:14:24] at his hair or you know how did he come
[1:14:26] out did he hold his Bible like the
[1:14:28] prophet and they're so carnal today
[1:14:30] but the bride has their mind on the word
[1:14:33] they're they're they're seeing the
[1:14:35] spiritual projection of what's being
[1:14:37] said
[1:14:38] and how it's being said there must be a
[1:14:41] message throughout this weekend that the
[1:14:43] Lord is trying to convey to you of where
[1:14:46] we're at in the message
[1:14:48] and what the ministry that's anointed by
[1:14:51] God is actually saying to the people we
[1:14:54] need to take note of that and we need to
[1:14:56] be obedient to that and say Lord we've
[1:14:58] entered into another season now and I
[1:15:01] received that God bless you as you have
[1:15:03] your seats today
[1:15:09] Christ ministers to the poor
[1:15:14] we all know that Christ means the
[1:15:16] anointed one
[1:15:17] so what will the anointed one do when he
[1:15:21] comes around what will the anointed word
[1:15:24] for our day not just the written word
[1:15:27] but the Living Word what will it do when
[1:15:31] it's around God's people
[1:15:33] he'll be anointed and what will he what
[1:15:36] is one of his first things that he said
[1:15:38] will come from that anointing is that
[1:15:41] he's come to minister to preach to the
[1:15:45] poor I just think that's incredible
[1:15:48] let's go to another scripture if you
[1:15:51] will and that's Matthew chapter 5. it's
[1:15:53] very close to Luke there back to Matthew
[1:15:59] is everyone doing okay today did you get
[1:16:02] a little rest last night and a little
[1:16:04] breakfast who ate a little food this
[1:16:06] morning breakfast and maybe you're
[1:16:08] fasting that's fine too but amen we got
[1:16:11] a little strength today so we can make
[1:16:13] it it's lunch time I think already
[1:16:17] I got the pulpit turned to me almost at
[1:16:19] lunch time so can we do we have a little
[1:16:22] time for the word
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:24] I think this is going to help someone I
[1:16:26] think in the next few minutes some of
[1:16:28] you are going to be helped in your
[1:16:30] spiritual life
[1:16:32] that's what we seek to do when we come
[1:16:34] is not to elevate ourselves or something
[1:16:36] but so that the people can leave and
[1:16:38] they feel like they got a hold of
[1:16:40] something
[1:16:41] Matthew Chapter 5 is another scripture
[1:16:44] of the Beatitudes
[1:16:46] I want you to notice again the emphasis
[1:16:49] in Matthew chapter 5.
[1:16:52] when he Jesus seeing the multitudes and
[1:16:56] he went up into a mountain and when he
[1:16:58] was said his disciples came unto him
[1:17:02] and when he opened his mouth and taught
[1:17:04] them what was the number one thing that
[1:17:08] came out of his mouth
[1:17:10] I think from these two scriptures we can
[1:17:12] really take a lesson about what's really
[1:17:15] important then
[1:17:17] and the whole Beatitudes if you look
[1:17:19] down through verse 12 all the way 1 to
[1:17:22] 12 here this is called the Beatitudes of
[1:17:24] The Sermon on the Mount but verse 3
[1:17:28] when he ought opened his mouth and
[1:17:30] taught them saying bless it
[1:17:32] are the poor in spirit
[1:17:36] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:17:41] Amen in two places of the Bible we see
[1:17:43] now in Matthew 5 and we read out of Luke
[1:17:46] our opening scripture verse 4 we find an
[1:17:49] emphasis being put on the poor blessed
[1:17:52] are the poor in spirit
[1:17:55] you know poor as we go forward this
[1:17:57] morning is not always poor in finances
[1:18:02] some of you might not have heard this
[1:18:04] quite like this before because right
[1:18:06] away your mind would go to the poor as
[1:18:08] being poor in finances even though many
[1:18:11] of God's people are poor but I want you
[1:18:14] to think about this as Jesus said
[1:18:16] blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:18:20] blessed are the poor maybe in gifts
[1:18:24] when you think of your life and think of
[1:18:27] maybe your talents you might feel like
[1:18:29] you're poor
[1:18:30] you're blessed today
[1:18:33] Christ is going to minister to you today
[1:18:35] when you feel like as a sister or as a
[1:18:38] brother maybe you're poor in health
[1:18:40] maybe you struggle with your health and
[1:18:42] you you have poor health and you think
[1:18:45] like maybe you're getting in a certain
[1:18:48] time of your life and and you're poor in
[1:18:50] health like you don't you can't
[1:18:51] contribute or you can't be the kind of
[1:18:53] mother that you'd like to be or the kind
[1:18:55] of sister or the brother in the church
[1:18:58] Christ is going to minister to you today
[1:19:01] maybe you're a person that is poor in
[1:19:03] friendships maybe you don't have a lot
[1:19:06] of friends
[1:19:07] maybe you feel alone a lot of times or
[1:19:10] like make maybe like a misfit maybe you
[1:19:13] came from Africa or another country and
[1:19:16] you've came to North America Canada and
[1:19:18] you feel like you're just trying to make
[1:19:20] it and you to survive here in this
[1:19:23] culture and you feel like you're poor
[1:19:26] maybe in relationships or friendships
[1:19:28] Christ ministers to the poor
[1:19:31] maybe you today feel poor in strength I
[1:19:35] know that we had a Friday night service
[1:19:37] and a Saturday night service and maybe
[1:19:39] on a Sunday afternoon now it's in the
[1:19:42] afternoon but you maybe feel poor in
[1:19:45] strength
[1:19:46] I want to I want to say this today
[1:19:48] Christ ministers to the poor
[1:19:51] maybe in physical abilities you're maybe
[1:19:54] when they chose the team you were always
[1:19:57] one of the last maybe when it comes to
[1:19:59] being physically abilities and to run or
[1:20:03] to jump maybe you weren't always the
[1:20:05] best maybe you're not in the top class
[1:20:07] and you feel poor and your physical
[1:20:09] abilities maybe mentally have you ever
[1:20:12] thought about this that's the number one
[1:20:14] thing that Jesus said that he's come to
[1:20:17] minister to the poor that it's just not
[1:20:19] always finances but it could have been a
[1:20:22] person that was poor mentally
[1:20:25] mentally they're not strong they might
[1:20:28] be physically strong maybe they have
[1:20:30] money in the bank but mentally they they
[1:20:33] are not strong brother John traveling
[1:20:36] now over the world and preaching in a
[1:20:39] lot of places I found that really
[1:20:41] amongst Believers that there's a a real
[1:20:43] test of our mental strength and sisters
[1:20:46] and brothers it's a it's a it's a very
[1:20:48] age of a mental battles that we're going
[1:20:51] through how many remember brother
[1:20:53] brownham in his meetings there would be
[1:20:55] stretchers and Wheelchairs and they
[1:20:57] would just be all kinds of uh things in
[1:21:00] his meetings and he would go right down
[1:21:02] the line in in discernment and say oh
[1:21:04] you sister back there you've got heart
[1:21:06] trouble and the man next to you you've
[1:21:08] got a kidney disease and and the neck
[1:21:10] next oh and you behind you there in the
[1:21:13] corner and you just thought my goodness
[1:21:15] these are serious needs
[1:21:18] and today if I would go through the
[1:21:21] building it probably wouldn't be like
[1:21:23] that oh brother you have cancer or you
[1:21:26] know you've got a tumor or you've got a
[1:21:28] lung disease it probably wouldn't be
[1:21:30] that way I can say that probably uh
[1:21:33] without even knowing you but it would
[1:21:34] probably be what are you going through
[1:21:36] sister what are you going through
[1:21:38] brother well there's a mental strain
[1:21:40] there's a struggle that I'm going
[1:21:42] through I'm facing this in my life our
[1:21:44] financial strain and the mental ability
[1:21:46] to make the grades or to kind of fit in
[1:21:49] it would be more of a mental condition
[1:21:51] and we look like everything's in order
[1:21:53] and there's no wheelchairs here there's
[1:21:55] no stretchers where everybody's doing
[1:21:57] just fine but really if you want to look
[1:21:59] into the spiritual Dimension that many
[1:22:02] people have become poor and I want to
[1:22:05] say Christ ministers to the poor
[1:22:08] maybe poor in education maybe poor and
[1:22:12] and having DNA or hereditary or the gene
[1:22:16] pool that follows in your family you
[1:22:19] actually might be poor you might
[1:22:20] struggle in that DNA area maybe poor and
[1:22:24] musical talent I don't think this church
[1:22:26] suffers with that very much but you know
[1:22:29] there are places where there is a
[1:22:31] musical Talent where you just don't have
[1:22:33] it you know and uh well you're a little
[1:22:36] quiet there but you know some Churches
[1:22:37] we go to they they struggle and they
[1:22:40] fight and they just you know they don't
[1:22:41] have a lot of talents I think the Lord's
[1:22:43] really blessed you but sometimes you
[1:22:45] wonder it's like Lord I can't preach I
[1:22:47] can't sing I can't hardly do nothing I
[1:22:49] feel like a failure I feel like I'm
[1:22:51] struggling poor an ability to keep
[1:22:54] things together and maybe you know I I
[1:22:57] want to reinforce this that Jesus was
[1:22:59] born in a poor family
[1:23:02] if you want to look in the scripture you
[1:23:04] don't need to turn now but and Matthew
[1:23:06] Mark and in the Gospel of John Jesus
[1:23:10] told this to the disciples the poor you
[1:23:14] have with you always
[1:23:16] the poor you have with you always
[1:23:19] even evening Light Fellowship the poor
[1:23:22] you will have with you always we we
[1:23:24] can't always meet all the needs of all
[1:23:26] the families and all the needs the
[1:23:28] church is not a bank
[1:23:31] evening Light Fellowship is not a
[1:23:33] financial institution this is a Church
[1:23:35] of the Living God and so you know we try
[1:23:38] to meet one another's needs and we try
[1:23:39] to respect the poor and be mindful and
[1:23:42] have compassion and and I believe that's
[1:23:44] important as we are a body but we can't
[1:23:46] meet all the needs of everyone sometimes
[1:23:49] people get into financial trouble
[1:23:51] sometimes there are decisions that are
[1:23:53] being made by young couples or young
[1:23:55] people or even older ones and we just
[1:23:57] need the Lord to help us stay humble and
[1:24:00] go forward in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:03] Christ
[1:24:06] Luke chapter 4 that we read
[1:24:10] if you'd like to turn back to there just
[1:24:12] for a moment I'll go back to it with you
[1:24:14] on the screen
[1:24:16] when Jesus was speaking when the spirit
[1:24:18] of the Lord came upon him and he was
[1:24:21] anointed to preach the gospel to the
[1:24:23] poor there was always a lot of poor
[1:24:25] people around around Jesus
[1:24:30] maybe they were dressed tattered maybe
[1:24:31] they were broken when you find Jesus
[1:24:34] who he talked to like the woman at the
[1:24:37] well or talked to the man that was at
[1:24:39] the pool of Bethesda it wasn't always
[1:24:41] people that had nice clothes and in the
[1:24:44] fineries and their Chariot drove up you
[1:24:47] know and they had 12 horses and who got
[1:24:49] out Jesus was really dealing with people
[1:24:51] that was in trouble A lot of times if
[1:24:54] you look in Luke chapter 4 speaks about
[1:24:56] the poor he speaks about the
[1:24:58] Brokenhearted speaks about the captives
[1:25:01] speaks about those that were blind or
[1:25:04] those that were bruised and how the
[1:25:05] ministry should follow that projection
[1:25:08] and I as we're going to talk about in a
[1:25:10] few minutes the ministry of William
[1:25:12] Branham followed the same projection
[1:25:15] wherever Christ is these attributes are
[1:25:18] going to be in the ministry
[1:25:20] can we say Amen
[1:25:22] and that is in the bride Ministry also
[1:25:26] should be our emphasis that it should be
[1:25:29] that the gospel is being ministered to
[1:25:31] the poor and I'm going to say this again
[1:25:33] because it's in my notes don't get a
[1:25:36] complex about being poor
[1:25:39] if you are in one of those lists of
[1:25:41] people that I just mentioned about poor
[1:25:44] and friends or poor and strength or poor
[1:25:46] and mental ability or poor and musical
[1:25:49] Talent or maybe poor fans financially
[1:25:51] don't get a complex and drag your head
[1:25:54] around you are a son and a daughter of
[1:25:57] God
[1:25:58] do you know today you can be rich in
[1:26:02] wealth
[1:26:03] and poor in spirit
[1:26:07] you could be rich and worldly wisdom
[1:26:10] have all kinds of degrees and diplomas
[1:26:13] on your wall and be smart be educated
[1:26:16] you know almost know the answer before
[1:26:18] the teacher even gives the question
[1:26:21] you can be rich in that and yet poor and
[1:26:24] love
[1:26:26] and poor and brotherly kindness
[1:26:29] I'm speaking this way today to maybe
[1:26:32] adjust some of our perceptions because
[1:26:35] we are living in exactly what brother
[1:26:37] John is preaching today is going
[1:26:39] opposite than the world we live in so
[1:26:42] this isn't popular you're not going to
[1:26:44] win any popular contests by believing
[1:26:46] this kind of message or preaching this
[1:26:49] kind of word it's not a running around
[1:26:51] the building and shouting Hallelujah to
[1:26:53] recognize that we are poor and sometimes
[1:26:56] we begin to look at our services and
[1:26:58] what really is the most important things
[1:27:00] that we need to be speaking about it's
[1:27:02] the things that the people are going
[1:27:04] through in their day-to-day life
[1:27:06] is that true you could be rich in
[1:27:09] finances and in mental abilities
[1:27:12] and be sharp and yet be poor in
[1:27:15] compassion
[1:27:17] and poor in Grace
[1:27:19] and poor in Mercy and the believer ought
[1:27:23] not to be that way we ought to be rich
[1:27:25] in compassion
[1:27:27] we ought to be like that Samaritan that
[1:27:30] was hated by the Jews the Jews were
[1:27:33] raised to hate the Samaritans they're
[1:27:36] like dogs and they're not even part of
[1:27:38] our race but remember Jesus gave that
[1:27:41] example of the priest that was too busy
[1:27:44] the levite that was too busy but there
[1:27:47] was a man that was hated by the Jews
[1:27:49] that had compassion on this man that had
[1:27:53] been beaten by the thieves do you all
[1:27:54] remember that and this man was
[1:27:56] backsliding so he was not in a Revival
[1:27:59] he was going from Jerusalem to Jericho
[1:28:02] and brother Branham said did you notice
[1:28:04] he was backsliding yes that's right so
[1:28:06] this this man did not look on him like
[1:28:09] the priest and the levite and say I
[1:28:10] don't have time all serves him right and
[1:28:13] he's backslidden he's going you know
[1:28:15] just you know anyway no he he knelt down
[1:28:18] and had compassion and poured in oil and
[1:28:21] wine could I ask you how you're doing
[1:28:23] this morning this afternoon and that I
[1:28:26] mean do you have that kind of a heart or
[1:28:28] do you have a heart of Grace
[1:28:32] are you quick to forgive
[1:28:35] how many know that in birth pains when
[1:28:37] brother Branham took birth pains and
[1:28:39] took the scripture and his Pages were
[1:28:42] stuck together and and you remember him
[1:28:44] fumbling around because he thought
[1:28:45] there's a misprint in my Bible and his
[1:28:47] wife is embarrassed he had just got uh
[1:28:50] this Bible for Christmas gift he had
[1:28:52] looked up the scripture you know that he
[1:28:54] had with his old Bible but he had
[1:28:56] brought his new Bible and he said it's
[1:28:58] the the pages are stuck together and
[1:29:00] he's embarrassed yes sir and who was it
[1:29:03] that stepped up in front with him was a
[1:29:06] Catholic priest Bishop Stanley and gave
[1:29:10] him his Bible and he actually prophesied
[1:29:12] and called brother Branham brother
[1:29:16] he called him brother and brother and he
[1:29:18] prophesied over brother Branham and
[1:29:20] brother Branham said that in the next
[1:29:22] Service uh this day the scripture is
[1:29:24] fulfilled he spoke it two times there
[1:29:27] the next night and then went back to
[1:29:29] Jeffersonville and spoke a whole message
[1:29:31] on this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:29:35] in other words did you notice yeah
[1:29:37] when Jesus Took the scripture in the
[1:29:40] Bible that his very first thing was I've
[1:29:44] come to minister to the poor
[1:29:46] here's a Catholic priest and all his
[1:29:48] robes and everything Hammond brother
[1:29:50] Branham his Bible and brother Branham
[1:29:53] and the message called him brother
[1:29:55] Stanley
[1:29:58] brother
[1:29:59] brother John I would never call a
[1:30:03] Catholic priest a brother where your
[1:30:06] Prophet did yeah
[1:30:08] yeah your Prophet called him my brother
[1:30:09] just like Abraham called lot brother lot
[1:30:12] and brother and brother you read that in

[1:30:25] backslidden person well your Prophet

[1:30:29] and he called a leader of the Catholic
[1:30:31] Church the Church brother Stanley

[1:30:52] on you and your little call I would
[1:30:54] never do that call a lot of brother
[1:30:56] blessed God you know what happened to
[1:30:57] his wife she turned into a pillar of
[1:30:59] salt and he got drunk later and all

[1:31:38] and you are so wonderful and oh I
[1:31:42] recognize this person you could be rich
[1:31:44] like that and be poor in relationships
[1:31:49] poor and being able to connect
[1:31:53] I'm gonna bring up an example in a few
[1:31:56] minutes of Marilyn Monroe and how she
[1:31:58] was raised and and how she becomes so
[1:32:00] popular in a sex symbol globally and
[1:32:03] brother Branham talked about her life
[1:32:05] and how she was so weary
[1:32:07] and when he saw her and heard about her
[1:32:09] life how he saw a whole nother side of
[1:32:12] Marilyn Monroe and they and he said the
[1:32:14] world would say she committed suicide
[1:32:16] but brother Branham said she died of a
[1:32:19] heart attack
[1:32:20] how many know that to be true and I'm
[1:32:22] going to show you her image and I'm
[1:32:24] going to show you her background to say
[1:32:26] that she started out poor she started
[1:32:28] out as a in a foster home an orphanage
[1:32:31] and she went on to become very popular
[1:32:33] and very rich
[1:32:35] recognized around the world even today
[1:32:39] and sometimes as Believers we can say
[1:32:42] well I'm not recognized and I'm not well
[1:32:44] known in fact I'm looked down but yet
[1:32:46] you're rich in relationships and what
[1:32:49] God has given you you are at church
[1:32:52] today
[1:32:54] Hallelujah I mean everybody with their
[1:32:57] cars and I know your parking lot's small
[1:32:59] and things but if you were so
[1:33:01] embarrassed that you didn't even have a
[1:33:03] car and you just kind of shuffled out
[1:33:05] last and said God bless you brother I'll
[1:33:07] see you at the fellowship at four
[1:33:08] o'clock you know but and you Shuffle
[1:33:10] down to the bus to the bus route or in a
[1:33:14] bicycle and you get there instead of
[1:33:15] having your nice dress all nice and how
[1:33:18] you doing brother coffee congratulations

[1:33:22] dirt all on the back of your skirt

[1:33:30] to the potluck because to be honest with
[1:33:32] you you couldn't afford it
[1:33:34] I mean that kind of shows another side
[1:33:36] of who the gospel came is to preach to
[1:33:39] those kind of people
[1:33:41] you know you could be let me just finish
[1:33:43] that thought you could
[1:33:47] and say well
[1:33:50] I'm a person that would get on the bus
[1:33:52] this afternoon or ride their bicycle to
[1:33:55] the to the great celebration is actually
[1:33:58] greater in the sight of God and they
[1:34:01] ought to be revered in their in our
[1:34:03] church as a real popular person more
[1:34:06] than those that are on social media are
[1:34:08] out there in politics or it's throwing a
[1:34:11] touchdown pass to Dan and thousands are
[1:34:14] screaming in their stands and they're
[1:34:16] just so wonderful and they're just so
[1:34:19] fantastic did you see that cat

[1:34:34] divorcing from his wife and that
[1:34:36] quarterback you know this cornerback
[1:34:38] just had adultery the last do you know
[1:34:39] all the tattoos and all the earrings

[1:34:44] studded diamonds here and and they're
[1:34:46] abusing women and they're abusing this
[1:34:49] and and they pay them off because they
[1:34:51] got millions that is not wonderful
[1:34:54] that is not rich today we need to focus
[1:34:57] down on what God has put around us and
[1:34:59] say that's rich and we are rich to have
[1:35:02] that kind of song that kind of preaching
[1:35:05] that kind of piano player though this
[1:35:07] kind of church
[1:35:10] it's not how high the steeple is it's
[1:35:12] how big your heart is
[1:35:14] it's how you do them through the week

[1:35:25] bonds you could have all kinds of boats
[1:35:27] and and things and guns and shoes my you
[1:35:30] could have books and iPhones and and
[1:35:33] Android devices and tablets and
[1:35:36] Microsoft my goodness brother John lives

[1:35:40] very you know capital of Microsoft and
[1:35:43] Amazon oh Bill Gates and Jim bezo Bozo
[1:35:46] whatever his name is and we find out
[1:35:49] they can't even keep their marriages
[1:35:50] together
[1:35:52] that's right
[1:35:54] amen they can't even keep their
[1:35:56] marriages together they're they're not
[1:35:57] happy they're the secretary this or the
[1:36:00] million dollar Island I mean what is
[1:36:01] their yacht gonna do when a tsunami
[1:36:03] comes and just crashes up we begin to
[1:36:06] find out that people could be rich in
[1:36:08] all of these things and yet poor in
[1:36:10] Christ pour in the word and poor in
[1:36:13] peace
[1:36:14] what is real riches then this afternoon
[1:36:17] what is to be rich
[1:36:19] what is life all about
[1:36:21] I want you to listen real closely today
[1:36:23] maybe a service like this could change
[1:36:26] the trajectory of a person's whole life
[1:36:30] I'm very aware that a service like this
[1:36:33] could change the direction of somebody's
[1:36:35] life
[1:36:36] some decision that they're making or
[1:36:38] something that they put out there I'm
[1:36:41] very aware that after three services
[1:36:42] like we've heard that it could change
[1:36:44] the course of a young lady or a young
[1:36:47] man for the rest of their life
[1:36:51] they say that children are like wet
[1:36:53] cement
[1:36:54] whatever's put on them whatever is
[1:36:57] impressed upon them is what they become
[1:37:00] so we need to be careful about how we
[1:37:02] are with our children and our families
[1:37:04] and make arrangements for them
[1:37:07] what is life all about then what is
[1:37:10] money
[1:37:11] what is popularity what is pleasure
[1:37:15] if it ends up being in a wrong
[1:37:16] relationship then what is pleasure
[1:37:19] what is houses
[1:37:22] I'm speaking about Christ ministering to
[1:37:24] the poor and I'm trying to show you the
[1:37:27] negative and the positive then what is
[1:37:29] real lands and what is being famous what
[1:37:32] does all that mean I think today that we
[1:37:35] would rather be rich in Jesus Christ
[1:37:39] I would rather be rich in his word
[1:37:42] I would rather be rich in his promises I
[1:37:46] would rather be rich in love
[1:37:49] I would rather be rich in goodness
[1:37:52] I would rather be rich in forgiveness
[1:37:56] if someone would find fault with my life
[1:37:59] I would really love that they would say
[1:38:01] but he just gave too much grace
[1:38:04] he was really rich in forgiveness for
[1:38:06] others and for himself I want to be rich
[1:38:09] in peace
[1:38:10] I pray that for your families I pray
[1:38:13] that for your children I pray that for
[1:38:15] your wives and your husbands that I uh
[1:38:18] that you would be rich in peace
[1:38:21] I really do friends
[1:38:23] that you would find richness and joy and
[1:38:26] surround yourself in positive things
[1:38:29] somebody say praise the Lord he
[1:38:32] ministers to the poor Jesus ministers to
[1:38:35] the poor
[1:38:38] I know this is unusual
[1:38:41] Isaiah chapter 66 verse 1 and 2. thus
[1:38:46] saith the Lord the heaven is my Throne
[1:38:48] Earth is my can I go on a little bit
[1:38:51] Earth is my footstool
[1:38:53] where is the house that ye build unto me
[1:38:56] and where is the place of my rest
[1:38:58] for all these things hath my mind
[1:39:01] handmade and all those things have been
[1:39:04] saith the Lord but to this man will I
[1:39:08] look
[1:39:09] to this woman this Sunday afternoon am I
[1:39:13] looking
[1:39:15] who's I looking to
[1:39:18] even to him that is poor and of a
[1:39:22] contrite spirit and trembleth at my work
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:27] I want to be where the Lord's uh
[1:39:29] attention is
[1:39:30] he didn't say to rich people to people
[1:39:33] that gave the most tithing or offering
[1:39:35] or were the best dressed no I'm gonna be
[1:39:40] looking to those individuals that are
[1:39:43] poor
[1:39:46] they're contrite
[1:39:49] David
[1:39:50] they respect my word they actually
[1:39:52] tremble
[1:39:54] that God would even speak to us like
[1:39:56] that and would say those type of things
[1:39:59] through one visiting Minister then
[1:40:01] another visiting Minister and another
[1:40:03] Minister that don't even know us surely
[1:40:06] the Lord must have a theme or must get
[1:40:08] something across to us but I wonder
[1:40:10] sometimes are we really catching what
[1:40:12] the spirit is saying to the church and
[1:40:15] then are we being obedient to follow
[1:40:17] those things
[1:40:19] blessed are you today if you're poor
[1:40:22] blessed are you that have a contrite
[1:40:24] spirit blessed are you that are
[1:40:26] trembling at the word
[1:40:28] Matthew 5 we read it already blessed are
[1:40:30] the poor in spirit so we're looking at a
[1:40:33] much deeper meaning than poor is not
[1:40:35] just financially or money or values and
[1:40:38] dollars or cents and things but poor is
[1:40:40] a man or a woman sometimes that might
[1:40:43] even be a person that that is needy has
[1:40:45] their hands out
[1:40:47] say now I want more of you Jesus I want
[1:40:49] more of you their destitute of wealth
[1:40:52] sometimes they they don't have a lot of
[1:40:54] influence maybe on the you know the
[1:40:56] placard on them they don't have a
[1:40:58] placard but it's not you know president
[1:41:00] or vice president
[1:41:02] they're not prime minister king or queen
[1:41:04] they're helpless
[1:41:06] how bloodies ever felt helpless before
[1:41:08] about half of you
[1:41:11] like well you're in good company
[1:41:17] you know let me just stop right here and
[1:41:19] say something
[1:41:21] it's Tuesday
[1:41:22] in America
[1:41:25] there was elections in the United States
[1:41:28] and they voted for senators they voted
[1:41:31] for Governors they voted for House of
[1:41:33] Representatives they voted for different
[1:41:35] initiatives and about things on ballots
[1:41:39] and things but you know what it really
[1:41:41] revealed
[1:41:42] it revealed a country that is very
[1:41:45] divided
[1:41:46] amen locally and even throughout the
[1:41:49] nation it actually revealed that America
[1:41:53] is a very divided country
[1:41:57] I know we're not politics and we're not
[1:41:59] thinking that way but I'm showing you on
[1:42:01] a political and on a national level I
[1:42:03] think it's that way in Canada too how
[1:42:05] you can be looking at the exact same
[1:42:07] thing and have totally opposite views in
[1:42:10] fact in the polling it was like 51 to 49
[1:42:14] it was like 51 of 50.6 and 49.3 this
[1:42:20] person was
[1:42:21] 50.6 and this is 49 that's not being
[1:42:24] balanced it's not like 70 percent in 30
[1:42:27] say man it was a landslide I mean
[1:42:29] literally throughout the whole nation
[1:42:31] you had races like that where they are
[1:42:34] so divided and in opposition and their
[1:42:37] struggles and opposite opinions I tell
[1:42:40] your friends the answer is not in
[1:42:43] politics
[1:42:44] the answer is not in politics it is not
[1:42:48] the liberals or conservatives or The
[1:42:50] Independents it is in Jesus Christ I I
[1:42:54] think we ought to have those ladies
[1:42:55] stand up and sing that song again amen
[1:42:57] we have a remedy and his name is Jesus
[1:43:01] Christ
[1:43:04] well if you were political Justin
[1:43:06] Trudeau or this other person and it's
[1:43:09] like are you serious
[1:43:11] you're so divided you look at the same
[1:43:14] piece of paper and say two opposite
[1:43:17] things
[1:43:19] people look in the message and they see
[1:43:21] two opposite things
[1:43:23] you can have churches and ministers and
[1:43:25] people they'll read the same quote and
[1:43:27] the same Bible and you wonder that's not
[1:43:30] even the character of our prophet
[1:43:33] our Prophet didn't handle the people
[1:43:35] that way that's not the spirit of the
[1:43:37] message
[1:43:39] and I'm trying to convey this this
[1:43:41] morning and in so many ways from here
[1:43:43] and there in illustrations and local
[1:43:46] things and and things from out of my
[1:43:48] experience or testimonies or quotes from
[1:43:50] Brother Bradham or the scriptures to let
[1:43:52] you know that Christ ministers to the
[1:43:55] poor
[1:43:58] where you're lacking he wants to make up
[1:44:01] the difference
[1:44:02] maybe in respects to your spirit you
[1:44:05] maybe even in learning maybe an
[1:44:07] intellectual culture in schools and
[1:44:09] things you just
[1:44:10] seem to fall short
[1:44:14] I'm just being cautious with my words
[1:44:16] but I want to be mindful to the Lord
[1:44:18] Jesus
[1:44:21] because we have different ones that move
[1:44:22] from other countries
[1:44:24] to North America and they think that oh
[1:44:26] the American dream or the Canadian plan
[1:44:29] it's so good it's so wonderful and they
[1:44:32] start out humble and they start out
[1:44:34] sincere and they want what's good for
[1:44:36] their children and what what's good for
[1:44:38] their families and if they're not
[1:44:40] careful down the road they got two jobs
[1:44:42] and then three jobs and they want to
[1:44:44] drive the Tesla or the BMW and they want
[1:44:47] to have the American dream or live in
[1:44:49] the nice house or you know have a you
[1:44:51] know the fancy newest iPhone and they
[1:44:53] want to do this and and it's a false
[1:44:56] facade because we that live here know
[1:44:58] that's not really contentment
[1:45:02] I mean we know that our culture is not
[1:45:04] the Canadian dream or the American dream
[1:45:07] it's only in Jesus Christ
[1:45:10] but I've seen so many then run after
[1:45:13] education because they want a better
[1:45:15] life for their children than that what
[1:45:18] they had or they want a better house
[1:45:20] than they can really afford or they have
[1:45:23] in their mind some great big idea and we
[1:45:26] find after years that go by they're not
[1:45:29] really happy and their children aren't
[1:45:31] happy and their marriages aren't happy
[1:45:33] they can actually get Warped in their
[1:45:36] whole lives because they've had
[1:45:38] something before them that was not real
[1:45:42] amen it's better to be poor and have a
[1:45:45] walk with Jesus than to be rich
[1:45:49] and not know him
[1:45:52] you can know a lot about him and not
[1:45:54] know him
[1:45:56] depart from me ye that work iniquity I
[1:45:59] never knew you that those were people
[1:46:01] that was involved with church things and
[1:46:03] casting out devils and preaching and all
[1:46:06] kinds of good works and things I mean
[1:46:08] the Rich Young Ruler was not a bad young
[1:46:10] person he he came to Jesus he respected
[1:46:13] Jesus and when he said all these things
[1:46:17] from my youth have I done Jesus never
[1:46:19] disputed that
[1:46:21] he was a good young man in the message
[1:46:23] he he would have been kind of a model
[1:46:25] young man in our church that was raised
[1:46:28] around the church very respectful if it
[1:46:30] was a young lady she you know she tried
[1:46:32] to live and hold the standard I know she
[1:46:35] was a little bit of you know lip gloss
[1:46:37] and a little bit of you know maybe
[1:46:38] excess over here music kind of you know
[1:46:41] there was a time but you know she's
[1:46:42] we're glad she's here and all of that
[1:46:44] but then as time goes on their hearts go
[1:46:47] away from the Lord
[1:46:49] then we wonder was we really focusing on
[1:46:52] the main thing did are we keeping the 98
[1:46:56] as our standard
[1:46:58] you keep them in a good environment you
[1:47:00] keep them around have a balanced
[1:47:03] Ministry have a balanced home life and
[1:47:05] they're gonna make it
[1:47:07] then it really really
[1:47:10] ought to strike us like our dear sister
[1:47:11] I was sharing with you last night that
[1:47:13] put those pictures all over her house
[1:47:15] and notes on the refrigerator and and
[1:47:18] microwave in their bedrooms on the
[1:47:20] mirror she got under a burden that her
[1:47:23] young people would be going in a certain
[1:47:25] way and I I'm here to tell you friends
[1:47:27] if you're on that road thank you
[1:47:29] on The Fast Track going down the road
[1:47:33] and thinking you're passing everybody
[1:47:34] and you're just better than everybody
[1:47:36] and you've got to have this and maybe
[1:47:39] the Lord's just putting a little bit of
[1:47:41] check in your heart today
[1:47:46] he's not going to ask you what was your
[1:47:48] degree
[1:47:49] crossing over to that other side
[1:47:52] what kind of car did you drive uh what
[1:47:54] kind of model did you drive and all
[1:47:56] we're gonna have the higher class in
[1:47:58] this section and over in heaven then
[1:48:00] we're going to have this those that
[1:48:01] struggled and the poor people down kind
[1:48:03] of here in the ghettos there is no there
[1:48:05] there's no get out in heaven
[1:48:08] it's a wonderful place
[1:48:10] I'm going to be in a place with you as
[1:48:12] streets of gold and a city we don't
[1:48:15] deserve to be there but he said you're
[1:48:17] worthy to be there he's making you
[1:48:19] worthy to be there
[1:48:21] I'm preaching this with a lot of
[1:48:22] earnestness I've got to be there
[1:48:24] my wife's got to be there my husband's
[1:48:27] got we've got to get dead Earnest today
[1:48:31] we didn't come here for an offering we
[1:48:33] come here for yourselves
[1:48:35] I don't even know you people my my
[1:48:37] lovely family but I'm more concerned
[1:48:40] about you are Tuesday what you're going
[1:48:43] to be thinking and what's your home life
[1:48:45] like than I am right now
[1:48:47] I'm more concerned this week about how
[1:48:49] you're caring about your love life with
[1:48:52] the Lord how you're treating your your
[1:48:53] spouse how you're treating your children
[1:48:55] are we really emphasizing the main thing
[1:48:59] help me Preach Today
[1:49:01] we ought to think of this great
[1:49:03] consideration then
[1:49:06] we ought to take the scripture and say
[1:49:08] why did he say that was the number one
[1:49:11] thing that I'm preaching the gospel to
[1:49:13] the poor
[1:49:14] we ought to take that as valid as
[1:49:17] something very valid in the Beatitudes
[1:49:20] when he said blessed are the poor
[1:49:23] the number one beatitude
[1:49:25] because we all was poor
[1:49:29] I have a very great
[1:49:31] um warning in my heart to speak to the
[1:49:33] older generation we can forget that when
[1:49:37] we started out we were poor too
[1:49:39] and I know God would bless you with the
[1:49:42] good things and and you can dress better
[1:49:44] now and you can have a better house and
[1:49:46] have the ability to to move things
[1:49:48] around and buy certain things or you
[1:49:51] know you can have that now but we don't
[1:49:54] never forget I hope this is okay
[1:49:56] don't never forget where you came from
[1:50:00] don't never forget that some of you
[1:50:02] maybe struggled financially or even in
[1:50:05] your marriage when you were first
[1:50:06] married and it it wasn't always clicking
[1:50:09] stop putting that romance fairy tale
[1:50:13] story in front of our young people that
[1:50:15] everything's good all the time that's
[1:50:17] nothing but what they're reading and
[1:50:19] looking on the internet as romance and
[1:50:21] it's not true
[1:50:23] marriage is struggle
[1:50:26] good Holy Ghost people struggle in their
[1:50:29] marriages
[1:50:31] I'm gonna smile I'm looking at you
[1:50:34] I've been married for 30 years and I
[1:50:37] know what I'm talking about
[1:50:41] good brothers and good sisters have to
[1:50:43] learn to change and adapt and it's not
[1:50:47] always his way
[1:50:49] it's not always her way
[1:50:52] it's not your way or the highway and you
[1:50:55] gotta walk around like eggshells around
[1:50:57] her in the morning you know and
[1:50:59] that's not the spirit of Christ
[1:51:03] some of us drink coffee better than we
[1:51:05] do the Holy Ghost
[1:51:08] well don't talk to me don't even talk to
[1:51:10] her until she gets her coffee
[1:51:13] you better not make any major decisions
[1:51:15] till you've had your vintage
[1:51:18] we glorify caffeine more than we do the
[1:51:21] power of God
[1:51:23] I'm being serious some of the little
[1:51:25] things that we have learned to become
[1:51:27] our habits we need to really look at
[1:51:29] because our children are going to
[1:51:31] accentuate that times 10.
[1:51:34] and our weaknesses they're picking up on
[1:51:37] that
[1:51:38] and sometimes we spank can we might want
[1:51:41] to delete this off the YouTube or you
[1:51:42] correct your children you correct your
[1:51:44] children and really what you're so upset
[1:51:46] at is you see yourself in them
[1:51:49] because you used to be that way
[1:51:53] you don't disrespect me you don't tell
[1:51:55] me you don't put a temper tant well
[1:51:57] that's the way you used to be that's
[1:51:59] just your own self coming out you're
[1:52:01] trying to beat out that old nature and
[1:52:03] you can't do that with a rod
[1:52:07] foreign
[1:52:11] stay with your notes okay I'm back here
[1:52:13] stay focused
[1:52:16] I did feel to say that today older ones
[1:52:20] let's not forget that we also went
[1:52:22] through hard times
[1:52:28] sometimes even bankruptcy sometimes
[1:52:31] failure
[1:52:33] sometimes you made bad decisions and
[1:52:35] wrong things and you just gotta admit it
[1:52:38] amen maybe having two jobs and three
[1:52:41] jobs
[1:52:42] you can't pay off that debt you just got
[1:52:44] to be honest and say listen baby listen
[1:52:46] baby
[1:52:48] we need to go back to being simple again
[1:52:51] where's our prayer life where's our time
[1:52:53] in the word we haven't even gone out for
[1:52:55] a date for
[1:52:57] three and a half years do I even know
[1:52:59] you
[1:53:00] I'm serious that and you're running here
[1:53:03] and she's running there and he's running
[1:53:05] over here and the kids are over there
[1:53:06] that's not a family
[1:53:09] that's not the mold that's not our goals
[1:53:12] that's not our pattern
[1:53:14] listen friends we can be poor and have
[1:53:16] our struggles but rich people have
[1:53:18] struggles too
[1:53:21] hello
[1:53:22] Tom Brady is a fantastic quarterback but
[1:53:26] his wife just said that's enough
[1:53:28] he wanted to retire and and that's it
[1:53:30] and she wanted a family man and all the
[1:53:34] time she's going along with her Jitsu
[1:53:36] partner there and anyway and he wants
[1:53:38] another year and nothing you look what
[1:53:40] happened in the year they got money
[1:53:42] coming out their ears both of them
[1:53:45] it's not being married to a Brazilian
[1:53:47] model that's going to keep you together
[1:53:50] oh y'all are getting quiet but I'm
[1:53:52] talking to you amen I'm talking some of
[1:53:54] your language you know exactly what I'm
[1:53:56] talking about
[1:53:57] amen and right on Sundays yeah he's
[1:54:00] throwing beautiful passes and he's doing
[1:54:02] all kinds of and he doesn't even know
[1:54:04] how to be a father and how to be a
[1:54:06] husband
[1:54:07] yet he's got the money brother
[1:54:10] he must be blessed
[1:54:16] really
[1:54:18] so you might be today in a position of
[1:54:21] being poor
[1:54:23] emotionally
[1:54:26] you might even be a spiritual person but
[1:54:29] emotionally
[1:54:32] or mentally
[1:54:36] you could be poor today you could
[1:54:38] literally be poor you could have enough
[1:54:40] money to go out and buy lunch at a
[1:54:42] restaurant today and yet emotionally
[1:54:45] not have it you just don't have it
[1:54:49] I could give so many and if I had
[1:54:51] another service to take on that
[1:54:54] what we know on the back end even in the
[1:54:56] message of things and prominent people
[1:54:58] but they struggle in this area of mental
[1:55:02] and oppression and even pastors wives
[1:55:05] and ministers and people that are
[1:55:07] prominent in the church deacons and
[1:55:09] things you're not alone sister when you
[1:55:12] feel nervous
[1:55:14] and it's like your only Escape is when
[1:55:16] you close the door to the washroom like
[1:55:18] give me some privacy
[1:55:22] you don't even hardly have enough time
[1:55:24] to take a bath
[1:55:26] I mean you can't even go to the restroom
[1:55:28] with them
[1:55:30] things going under the door in people's
[1:55:33] head and you're like oh God you're poor
[1:55:36] poor
[1:55:39] Christ ministers to the poor I mean he's
[1:55:41] gonna pick up and bring a minister from
[1:55:43] the West to come and talk to you and say
[1:55:45] God's got this
[1:55:47] you're not a weirdo
[1:55:49] you're not about to crack up
[1:55:52] you're normal you're a normal believer
[1:55:54] that's going through what we're all
[1:55:57] going through and he's ministering to
[1:55:59] you right right there at your point of
[1:56:01] need
[1:56:04] that's real Ministry it's ministering to
[1:56:07] the people at their point of need
[1:56:11] God give us people that are contrite
[1:56:14] they've been smitten and stricken in
[1:56:17] their spirit it's like brother John my
[1:56:20] courage is gone my emotions are gone the
[1:56:23] reason that I don't have it to give I
[1:56:25] don't have the love I should and the
[1:56:28] kind of patience is because I've lost it
[1:56:30] somewhere in the battle
[1:56:31] and I see it on my disposition I see the
[1:56:35] very seat of my emotions it's been like
[1:56:37] the carpets ripped out underneath me
[1:56:38] Brother John
[1:56:40] and I need courage and I need Spirit
[1:56:42] look in Isaiah 66 verse 2 those are the
[1:56:46] ones that the Lord Jesus is looking at
[1:56:50] praise God that you administer like this
[1:56:53] not to the strong people in the church
[1:56:56] that the service isn't for you then
[1:56:58] today just exit it often say that's
[1:57:00] where brother so and so or sister so but
[1:57:03] maybe it's for you
[1:57:05] to realize we're a body and we need to
[1:57:09] have this kind of Ministry for one
[1:57:11] another
[1:57:12] I'm willing to stand here so that my
[1:57:15] sister can be ministered to
[1:57:18] amen I'm willing to be a servant so that
[1:57:21] my brother can really be ministered to I
[1:57:23] want him to catch this
[1:57:28] I don't want her to feel like because
[1:57:30] she is feeling like that way that she's
[1:57:33] not a good Christian and she don't have
[1:57:34] the Holy Spirit I want to be able to let
[1:57:37] the Holy Spirit minister to her do you
[1:57:40] know in Matthew 5 when Jesus said
[1:57:42] blessed are the poor in spirit that word
[1:57:45] blessed actually means satisfied and
[1:57:48] happy or happier are the poor in spirit
[1:57:53] do you know that it's actually poor
[1:57:55] people that will receive the Gospel read
[1:57:57] more readily and easier than someone
[1:58:00] that has a lot of money
[1:58:03] know that the gospel is carried on the
[1:58:06] shoulders of the poor and any pastor and
[1:58:10] any trustee will tell you that
[1:58:13] it's not always the big givers in the
[1:58:15] church
[1:58:16] it is uh it is those brothers and
[1:58:18] sisters that give their offerings and
[1:58:20] ties a lot of rich people are stingy and
[1:58:24] give the least
[1:58:25] [Music]
[1:58:28] and I don't even know your names let
[1:58:30] alone your Ledger here I'm just telling
[1:58:32] you from experience a lot of rich people
[1:58:34] don't give
[1:58:37] they have some weird concept that all
[1:58:40] these write-offs take away their income
[1:58:42] it's very weird it's a worldly lack of
[1:58:45] Revelation
[1:58:46] that all these write-offs kind of take
[1:58:49] away their income so they might be
[1:58:50] millionaires in the church and you have
[1:58:52] a brother that's struggling and he's
[1:58:54] given his 200 or a hundred dollars or I
[1:58:57] have little children that give a dollar
[1:58:58] sometimes or 58 cents and I'm just so
[1:59:01] thankful and you have a millionaire in
[1:59:03] the church and they're not giving
[1:59:07] where did that come from amen praise God
[1:59:10] the Bible says Happy happy are you when
[1:59:14] you're poor
[1:59:19] I meant to say this earlier don't be a
[1:59:21] poor person
[1:59:22] and be sad and miserable
[1:59:26] and you're still going to be poor
[1:59:29] all right when the people that are rich
[1:59:32] and have all the they're not happy
[1:59:33] either
[1:59:35] so why are you trying to be like them
[1:59:37] come on
[1:59:38] why are you thinking all the time I've
[1:59:41] got to be a certain thing and people
[1:59:43] that are that certain thing they're not
[1:59:45] happy either because they want to be
[1:59:47] another thing
[1:59:49] come on I tell you this is a deep
[1:59:51] revelation
[1:59:53] the Poor People's gotta get it stop
[1:59:55] trying to be like them when they're them
[1:59:58] and they're not happy either
[1:59:59] [Music]
[2:00:01] because they got one yacht and they want
[2:00:03] a bigger yacht you know they got a
[2:00:05] million dollars and they went three
[2:00:06] million and their taxes are worth more
[2:00:09] than you ever even think about your
[2:00:10] mortgage and you know one-third problems
[2:00:16] blessed are the poor
[2:00:20] there was a king are we doing okay this
[2:00:22] is our you can kick me out after this
[2:00:24] service amen
[2:00:27] there was a king in Scotland
[2:00:30] King five of Scotland you can look it up
[2:00:34] that on occasion he was a king he would
[2:00:36] lay aside the Royal Robes of being a
[2:00:39] king and he would dress like a peasant
[2:00:42] and in that disguise he would move
[2:00:45] freely about the land making friends and
[2:00:48] entering into their difficulties
[2:00:51] appreciating their handicaps and
[2:00:54] sympathizing with them in their sorrow
[2:00:55] would when he was a king and sat on the
[2:00:58] throne then after going through that
[2:01:01] with the peasants and the common people
[2:01:03] he was better able to rule over them
[2:01:05] because now he had a fatherly compassion
[2:01:08] and he had mercy
[2:01:12] in fact there was one day a good King
[2:01:14] loved his people very much
[2:01:17] and he dedicated his life to serving his
[2:01:20] people but he had a hard time
[2:01:21] understanding exactly what they were
[2:01:24] going through because he was a king
[2:01:26] so he was born in a royal family so
[2:01:30] he always knew that he would become a
[2:01:32] king he but he never had to cut wood
[2:01:34] with the wood Chopper he never had to
[2:01:37] work in the fields like a farmer and it
[2:01:39] was hard for him to understand
[2:01:42] what it was like to be a regular person
[2:01:45] in the kingdom are you listening
[2:01:48] so one day this King decided to make
[2:01:51] himself to become a peasant
[2:01:55] so he laid down his crown he would give
[2:01:57] up all his powers
[2:01:58] so he could work like the workers in the
[2:02:01] field and struggle through life like
[2:02:03] those who lived in his kingdom so one
[2:02:05] day the king told his guards and his
[2:02:07] noble men today you see me for your last
[2:02:10] time for many years
[2:02:12] oh and they said good team
[2:02:16] why do you say that
[2:02:18] they ask are you going to a foreign
[2:02:20] country
[2:02:21] the king replied no I'm going out
[2:02:23] amongst my subjects I'm going to become
[2:02:26] like a peasant
[2:02:28] his guards are noblemen they were amazed
[2:02:32] why would the king become a peasant
[2:02:35] why would he care what others have to go
[2:02:38] through we He will always be king so
[2:02:41] what does it matter to him how other
[2:02:43] people are living
[2:02:44] it was hard for them to understand but
[2:02:47] the king's mind was made up so the good
[2:02:49] King he left the castle and lived in
[2:02:53] Disguise Among The Peasants so he could
[2:02:55] understand them better
[2:02:57] the king so loved his people that he
[2:03:01] wanted to understand their needs and
[2:03:03] wishes so he became one of them
[2:03:07] I hope you're thinking spiritual that's
[2:03:10] exactly what God did for us
[2:03:13] changed himself from being Jehovah God
[2:03:18] to became one of us Jesus Christ he was
[2:03:22] tempted like us suffered like us he died
[2:03:25] like us he didn't have to go through
[2:03:27] that but he was God I want to say that's
[2:03:30] my God
[2:03:31] I can serve that kind of a God I I can
[2:03:34] be like that kind of a priest that would
[2:03:36] would actually become like one of us and
[2:03:39] and suffer with a headache and he would
[2:03:42] be sick and tormented he was a teenager
[2:03:45] he was a young person he was a person in
[2:03:48] their 20s
[2:03:53] somebody say praise the Lord
[2:03:55] so that now when you pray to him he
[2:03:58] knows what you're going through and he's
[2:04:00] not just striking you up because he was
[2:04:02] tired he sweated too he was
[2:04:04] misunderstood I mean come on Friends
[2:04:06] you've heard enough messages on the
[2:04:07] cross what he went through he didn't
[2:04:10] have a nice little robe and a little
[2:04:12] long he was stripped naked on the cross
[2:04:15] hello somebody's here evening time
[2:04:17] evening Light Fellowship
[2:04:20] how would you like to be stripped naked
[2:04:22] in front of all the people and yeah
[2:04:23] hanging up there that's embarrassing
[2:04:26] amen isn't it
[2:04:29] and you had done nothing but good healed
[2:04:32] their sick raised their dad been kind
[2:04:34] and generous compassionate loving all of
[2:04:37] that
[2:04:38] and they still killed him
[2:04:41] let me just put this as a little note
[2:04:43] for everyone you can be just like what
[2:04:46] you're praying to be to be like Jesus
[2:04:48] and people still will hate you
[2:04:51] they still will look down on you they'll
[2:04:54] look down me oh no oh she's just being
[2:04:56] religious
[2:04:59] so just wake up today and realize it's
[2:05:01] not about everybody's opinion
[2:05:02] [Music]
[2:05:04] the church thinks about you
[2:05:09] you don't know what they're going
[2:05:10] through and you don't know why their
[2:05:13] young little boy is like that or their
[2:05:15] little girl you don't know why that why
[2:05:16] that brother is carrying himself in a
[2:05:19] certain way why he's not responding to
[2:05:21] to a service maybe he's going through a
[2:05:24] distress maybe tomorrow Tuesday morning
[2:05:26] he's filing for bankruptcy around
[2:05:30] and the Bible says you're worse than an
[2:05:32] Infidel if you kept around he just feels
[2:05:34] like do I even have the Holy Ghost
[2:05:39] and what do I say to my teenager now
[2:05:41] that we got to move out of our house and
[2:05:44] well here's a good message for you to
[2:05:46] hear
[2:05:47] Christ is trying to minister to you
[2:05:50] when your friends walk out when they say
[2:05:52] bad things on the media about you and
[2:05:55] when they put thumbs down instead of
[2:05:57] thumbs up
[2:05:59] what are you supposed to do about that
[2:06:01] I'm poor brother John I don't even have
[2:06:03] a person that understands me
[2:06:06] my husband don't even understand my wife
[2:06:09] I could never tell her I'd be too
[2:06:11] embarrassed to tell her where we're at
[2:06:13] and what we're doing
[2:06:15] people in the church they just friends
[2:06:17] we can get such an attitude
[2:06:20] look at Second Corinthians chapter eight
[2:06:22] are we still doing okay
[2:06:25] blessed are the poor
[2:06:28] Paul said for you know the grace of our
[2:06:30] Lord Jesus Christ that though he was
[2:06:33] rich
[2:06:34] yet for your sakes he become poor
[2:06:38] that ye through his poverty might be
[2:06:42] rich
[2:06:43] somebody say praise the Lord
[2:06:44] [Music]
[2:06:46] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:06:49] though she was rich yet for your sakes
[2:06:52] he became poor
[2:06:54] that ye through his poverty might be
[2:06:57] rich
[2:06:58] he became poor like a beggar
[2:07:04] I mean can you imagine being married
[2:07:07] man feeding the Messiah
[2:07:11] changing his diaper
[2:07:13] telling him to go to bed you need to go
[2:07:16] to bed you know it's you need to go to
[2:07:18] bed
[2:07:19] that's the Messiah
[2:07:22] he was still a little boy he still
[2:07:24] needed his diapers changed
[2:07:27] none of us are Catholics but we still
[2:07:30] got the little Halo and oh he was just
[2:07:32] so perfect and all of these things
[2:07:35] he was a young man
[2:07:37] there's a years of Silence from 12 years
[2:07:40] old to 30. we don't know a lot that went
[2:07:42] on but he was a teenager
[2:07:51] and if you're a sister with the Life of
[2:07:53] Christ and you're going through life
[2:07:55] you're still going to have the times of
[2:07:56] the month and you're still going to have
[2:07:58] menopause
[2:08:00] with the Holy Ghost
[2:08:02] it's going to come in all our churches
[2:08:04] all of our sisters are going to deal
[2:08:06] with this
[2:08:07] you can get quiet and look at me all
[2:08:09] weird and your face get all red but it's
[2:08:12] nothing but the truth and brother Bynum
[2:08:14] didn't call him demons and Devils he
[2:08:16] would just say you're going through that
[2:08:17] time of the month and you get nervous
[2:08:19] and it comes at that time of the evening
[2:08:21] and they talked about certain times of
[2:08:23] the year I think we're in that time of
[2:08:24] the year where it gets gloomy and it
[2:08:26] gets darker early you need to be careful
[2:08:29] oh you say I got the Holy Ghost brother
[2:08:31] well we I do too
[2:08:33] but brother Brown I'm in discernment
[2:08:35] when he would talk about these things
[2:08:36] Crossing Bridges before you get there
[2:08:40] that's real people are already crossing
[2:08:43] the bridge going around the corner and
[2:08:45] doing something and she said and he said
[2:08:47] and I just know that they're poor
[2:08:49] mentally but God's trying to strengthen
[2:08:52] you today
[2:08:53] he's trying to let you know that you
[2:08:55] don't you're not filled with the demon
[2:08:57] Spirit he's trying to encourage you and
[2:09:00] Minister he became like a beggar Paul
[2:09:03] was talking about and is poverty and his
[2:09:06] lack of riches
[2:09:07] he he that we would become rich
[2:09:11] that we would have spiritual blessings
[2:09:13] and a giving of an abundance of this
[2:09:17] praise the Lord
[2:09:19] let me just go to another area talking
[2:09:22] about brother branham's Ministry I need
[2:09:24] to turn a little corner here to build
[2:09:25] this thought for you are we still doing
[2:09:28] okay
[2:09:29] brother branham's Ministry was
[2:09:31] surrounded by these kind of people
[2:09:34] he's talking about it in in British
[2:09:36] Columbia Dawson Creek some time ago I
[2:09:39] was going into the psychopathic room
[2:09:40] from the auditorium to pray for the
[2:09:43] people some of them in straight jackets
[2:09:47] well who's your congregation
[2:09:49] well I've got the auditorium
[2:09:52] that's full of stretchers and cots and
[2:09:54] things that for and over there is a
[2:09:56] psychopathic room and there's people in
[2:09:59] there that are in straight jackets who
[2:10:01] knows what a straight jacket is straight
[2:10:03] jacket
[2:10:04] that's his congregation
[2:10:07] they were poor
[2:10:10] couldn't even hold it together
[2:10:13] I'm bringing this to you for a reason
[2:10:16] how many you've heard of Charles Fuller
[2:10:19] the old-fashioned Revival hour well
[2:10:21] that's where it was Long Beach we just
[2:10:23] left there a few days ago and when the
[2:10:25] big Auditorium and oh my what a meeting
[2:10:27] we had and he's talking about brother
[2:10:29] Fuller there calls him brother Fuller
[2:10:32] when we were there a wonderful Christian
[2:10:34] brother he was going out that afternoon
[2:10:37] and he as he passed off the platform now
[2:10:40] he's showing the contrast brother Fuller
[2:10:43] and his group his crowd when they went
[2:10:46] out fine dressed and intellectual people
[2:10:49] he made an altar call and one lady
[2:10:51] raised up her hand that she wanted to
[2:10:53] receive Christ wonderful dedicated a few
[2:10:56] babies and went out a Grand Old Saint in
[2:11:00] Charles Fuller man nice cars and
[2:11:02] intellectual what a service they had
[2:11:06] say I want to be part of that group well
[2:11:09] let me talk to you about the messenger
[2:11:12] our messenger

[2:11:16] afternoon
[2:11:18] and our group

[2:11:22] our group waited out on the peers and so
[2:11:25] forth to his service was the Smith and
[2:11:27] here come my crowd in
[2:11:31] Hallelujah
[2:11:33] wheelchairs crutches
[2:11:38] straight jackets
[2:11:44] that's a lot different
[2:11:47] when you can stand and kind of talk some
[2:11:49] kind of a theology nothing against Dr
[2:11:51] Fuller a godly man but to stand and tell
[2:11:54] them about Christ that lives and will
[2:11:55] save them and let them raise their hands
[2:11:57] and put their name on a book that's one
[2:11:59] thing
[2:12:00] but when your faith has to Buck against
[2:12:02] Wheelchairs and crutches and blind and
[2:12:06] deaf and dumb and insane and screaming
[2:12:10] and whiskers over their face he's
[2:12:13] talking about the poor people
[2:12:14] [Music]

[2:12:22] part of

[2:12:25] John that has

[2:15:49] I didn't even know if they're in the
[2:15:50] message today
[2:15:54] you see our human Natures we tend to
[2:15:56] appeal to the easiest Road or what can
[2:15:59] be easy when brother branham's group was
[2:16:00] insane people
[2:16:04] he just gotten insane and and the same
[2:16:07] the paragraph before he went to a
[2:16:09] psychopathic room
[2:16:11] and if you read that quote he was
[2:16:13] dealing with a young lady and dealing
[2:16:15] with their situation and some of you
[2:16:17] know the story he would go into another
[2:16:19] place down underneath and it's like why
[2:16:21] are you in here and and she was so
[2:16:23] beautiful it looked like she had it
[2:16:25] together yet her mind was gone
[2:16:28] how many remember John the Baptist
[2:16:31] how many know one of the main things
[2:16:34] that Jesus said to John the Baptist
[2:16:37] disciples because remember John the
[2:16:40] Baptist is in prison who knows some of
[2:16:42] the main things Jesus said you go tell
[2:16:45] John
[2:16:46] that this is the ministry
[2:16:48] what was it
[2:16:50] what did Jesus focus on what did he say
[2:16:53] okay you Brothers go back and tell John
[2:16:55] what did he say was it how he held the
[2:16:57] Bible
[2:16:59] was that how he just talked about the
[2:17:01] Mysteries and the Seven Seals and did
[2:17:03] you notice how he wrapped that all up in
[2:17:05] the rainbows and oh did he say that
[2:17:08] no he said in Matthew the blind received
[2:17:11] their sight the lame walk the lepers are
[2:17:13] cleansed the death here the dead are
[2:17:16] raised up and the poor have the gospel
[2:17:18] praise to them
[2:17:19] Hallelujah there's all kinds of things
[2:17:21] happening the supernatural but don't
[2:17:24] forget to tell John that the poor people
[2:17:27] are and I'm sure John went okay you're
[2:17:29] the you're the blindness the deaf this
[2:17:31] and that and then the poor have their
[2:17:33] gospel preaching John said Hallelujah
[2:17:36] [Music]
[2:17:38] it would be like this yes okay I see the
[2:17:41] Supernatural and then oh and finally the
[2:17:44] poor is having the gospel preach to them
[2:17:46] I can see it already brother Jonathan
[2:17:49] brother John the Baptist going yes yes
[2:17:55] cause I know if he would have told me it
[2:17:57] was all the rich people all the
[2:17:59] Pharisees while everybody's receipt oh

[2:18:03] six you know camels and they got 12
[2:18:05] Arabians and they're all just sitting up
[2:18:07] there so Papa's oh John would have said
[2:18:10] oh man real really
[2:18:13] I'm dramatizing but that's exactly right
[2:18:16] it's a scripture in Luke Jesus answering
[2:18:19] said unto them go your way tell John
[2:18:22] what things you have seen and heard how
[2:18:25] the blind sea the lame walk the lepers
[2:18:28] are cleansed the deaf here the dead are
[2:18:30] raised and son's going yeah yeah
[2:18:33] and to the poor the gospel is preached

[2:18:49] Newfoundland today we have the gospel
[2:18:51] being preached to us this has happened
[2:18:54] that's happened and that's happened with
[2:18:55] how you really know the the poor people
[2:18:58] are being ministered to
[2:19:02] praise be to God
[2:19:05] as we try to find a rep
[2:19:07] find a place to wrap these things up
[2:19:09] today
[2:19:12] this is Marilyn Monroe I have her
[2:19:15] you can look it up and study how many
[2:19:17] she was married three times she only
[2:19:20] lived a very short life
[2:19:23] but when brother Branham talked about
[2:19:25] her and show us the father notice the
[2:19:28] title show us the father he was talking
[2:19:30] about how the lord gave are we still
[2:19:32] doing okay
[2:19:33] I need to let you know that what I said
[2:19:35] earlier was in the message
[2:19:37] I saw a vision of this young woman dying
[2:19:40] that they said that committed suicide
[2:19:43] it's been about a year ago I forget this
[2:19:46] she was some kind of a girl that was
[2:19:48] very popular woman I was up in the
[2:19:50] mountain
[2:19:51] and I saw her die
[2:19:54] and they told me he said he told me he
[2:19:57] said you can say it's four o'clock it's
[2:20:01] just a few seconds before four
[2:20:04] I think that's incredible
[2:20:08] and said they'll say she committed
[2:20:11] suicide but she died with a heart attack
[2:20:17] and you can go and search it out today
[2:20:19] on the internet they'll say she died
[2:20:22] of suicide reaching for the phone with
[2:20:25] all pills on the on the table next to
[2:20:27] her the night table and she just died
[2:20:29] she committed suicide and brother Bynum
[2:20:32] said she did not commit suicide she died
[2:20:33] with a heart attack
[2:20:35] what is her woman's name a young
[2:20:37] blonde-headed woman Marilyn Monroe that
[2:20:40] was it she died and she did not commit
[2:20:42] suicide
[2:20:43] watch in verse paragraph 155. I felt
[2:20:47] sorry for the girl are we all listening
[2:20:50] she always seemed to be kind of a woman
[2:20:52] weary like she needed something
[2:20:56] I wish I could have got to that child
[2:20:59] she needed Christ
[2:21:03] she might have went to some cold formal
[2:21:06] Church
[2:21:07] but she needed a real case of Salvation
[2:21:10] with something in her heart to give that
[2:21:13] assurance
[2:21:15] her father look at this
[2:21:17] and show us the father he's he's showing
[2:21:21] how this young lady her father she never
[2:21:24] seen him
[2:21:26] her mother was in the insane Institution
[2:21:30] it was all on the girl's mind
[2:21:34] she needed Christ
[2:21:36] and then in that he's talking about a
[2:21:39] young lady
[2:21:41] are you with me today
[2:21:43] she's raised in a foster home she
[2:21:48] it's just horrible
[2:21:55] it was all in the girl's mind
[2:21:59] her mother was in an insane Institution
[2:22:03] can you imagine her mother spinning the
[2:22:06] wall don't even know your father your
[2:22:09] mother's insane
[2:22:12] she needed Christ
[2:22:15] it was all on her mind here is Marilyn
[2:22:17] Monroe here you can see cause of death
[2:22:20] what the world would say barbiturate
[2:22:22] overdose where she was born Los Angeles
[2:22:24] she was an actress a model a singer
[2:22:28] she was married three times look she was
[2:22:30] married the year she was married and
[2:22:32] then divorced
[2:22:33] even the the paper when she died Marilyn
[2:22:37] Monroe killed cell found in bed hand on
[2:22:40] the phone took 40 pills this is what the
[2:22:43] papers said about her death
[2:22:46] Marilyn Monroe
[2:22:49] she was born to the certain woman she
[2:22:51] was an American actress a singer a model
[2:22:54] she was famous for being a blondie
[2:22:56] bombshell and her characters won a
[2:22:59] popular sex symbol in the 50s and 60s as
[2:23:02] they went through that sexual Revolution
[2:23:04] she grossed it talks about her movies
[2:23:06] which was equivalent to two billion
[2:23:09] dollars in 2021
[2:23:11] long after her death she still remains
[2:23:13] in pop culture and things a major icon
[2:23:16] and goes through all of these things
[2:23:17] born in Los Angeles
[2:23:19] she spent most of her childhood in
[2:23:23] foster homes and an orphanage
[2:23:25] and she married at age 16.
[2:23:29] working in a factory during World War II
[2:23:32] and she met a photographer she was
[2:23:34] looking for love
[2:23:36] in all the wrong places she
[2:23:39] she didn't know her daddy
[2:23:42] her mom's beating her head against an
[2:23:44] insane
[2:23:46] institution War
[2:23:48] she goes from foster home Foster Home
[2:23:51] Orphanage
[2:23:53] and that's when brother Branham he
[2:23:56] talked about her and that she committed
[2:23:58] suicide and said she needed Christ she
[2:24:00] he felt sorry for her he seemed to be
[2:24:03] kind of a woman kind of weary like she
[2:24:05] needed something I wished I could have
[2:24:07] got to the child she might have been in
[2:24:10] so some cold formal Church she really
[2:24:13] needed a real case of Salvation with
[2:24:16] something in her heart you say brother
[2:24:18] John you repeated that yeah we need it
[2:24:20] to be repeated sometime because I don't
[2:24:22] know if we got it the first time
[2:24:25] she was poor
[2:24:28] yet she turned out rich
[2:24:30] she's popular she's all kinds of all
[2:24:33] over the internet
[2:24:35] today
[2:24:37] for all the wrong reasons
[2:24:39] so what do you want to be like today
[2:24:44] I would say Lord Keep Us near The Cross
[2:24:47] who was her father Marilyn Monroe who
[2:24:49] they don't even know till today who her
[2:24:51] father was
[2:24:54] I tell you we ought to be thankful we
[2:24:56] have a Heavenly Father this was
[2:24:58] expressed through John in third John 1
[2:25:00] and 2-4 what says I have no Greater Joy
[2:25:03] than to hear that my children Walk In
[2:25:05] Truth this was an apostle of love
[2:25:08] saying that he had no Greater Joy than
[2:25:10] to find the Lord Has No Greater Joy than
[2:25:13] to see us walking in the truth and
[2:25:15] neither does his ministry or your pastor
[2:25:17] or the Elders of this church There's No
[2:25:19] Greater Joy than to see us going on with
[2:25:22] God and that we made arrangements and we
[2:25:25] can see some are catching it and some
[2:25:27] are going on sure they all have their
[2:25:29] struggles and sure things aren't maybe
[2:25:31] the way that you would like them to be
[2:25:33] or maybe they would they're not the way
[2:25:35] that you would do them but there is no
[2:25:37] Greater Joy that we should have this
[2:25:40] afternoon than we are in the presence of
[2:25:43] God
[2:25:45] Hallelujah Lord help us to be as Earnest
[2:25:48] as we should be about these things maybe
[2:25:50] somebody's turning a corner maybe
[2:25:52] somebody is at that point of just making
[2:25:55] a decision
[2:25:57] and God predestinated this weekend
[2:26:00] long before we even knew you were going
[2:26:03] to sell this building
[2:26:04] long before we knew you were gonna buy
[2:26:07] another building and this was our last
[2:26:09] special no we didn't plan it that way
[2:26:11] is that true brother sister God planned
[2:26:15] it that way
[2:26:20] God loves you today
[2:26:23] God loves us
[2:26:26] David even was unashamed to say in
[2:26:28] Psalms in verse 6
[2:26:30] Psalms 34 Verse 6 this poor man cried
[2:26:33] and the Lord heard him
[2:26:36] so it's not always in our times of
[2:26:38] strength but it's in our times when we
[2:26:41] feel like we're poor I'm Afflicted Lord
[2:26:44] I'm needy
[2:26:46] I'm weak
[2:26:48] I'm lonely

[2:31:28] did he have a church where there was
[2:31:30] thousands of seats just thousands my
[2:31:34] brother John brother branham's
[2:31:35] Tabernacle just had thousands and
[2:31:37] balconies and five Services a day
[2:31:40] because there were just thousands are
[2:31:42] you serious
[2:31:43] I was born and raised and there wasn't
[2:31:46] thousands of people that came to the
[2:31:48] pratham Tabernacle
[2:31:51] did he travel on private jets did he
[2:31:53] minister to poor people was his ministry
[2:31:56] of healing into the Brokenhearted did he
[2:31:58] preach deliverance and and heal those
[2:32:00] that were blind did he liberate those
[2:32:03] that were bruised and I would say that
[2:32:04] is the ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:32:07] then what about the ministry of Christ
[2:32:09] today in the bride
[2:32:11] don't you think that it would carry the
[2:32:13] same projection
[2:32:16] if Christ is going to be in you
[2:32:18] will it not bring forth The Same Spirit
[2:32:21] of Christ
[2:32:24] how many want him to walk in you today
[2:32:27] how many want him to talk in you
[2:32:29] how many would want your nature to be
[2:32:31] like Jesus to be like Jesus I want to
[2:32:34] act like him she is him
[2:32:37] his spirit is in you so then if it's the
[2:32:41] same projection then there's got to be a
[2:32:43] people that's begin to recognize that
[2:32:46] our whole mission in life is to be like
[2:32:48] Jesus our whole achievement in life is
[2:32:51] to be like Jesus our mission statement
[2:32:54] ought to be I want to be like Jesus our
[2:32:58] goal is to be like Jesus and do you know
[2:33:00] what that spirit of God did when he came
[2:33:02] on Jesus I mean the spirit of the Lord
[2:33:05] when he sat down he was anointed
[2:33:09] to relate to poor people
[2:33:11] to needy people
[2:33:14] to troubled people
[2:33:16] that's where healing flowed
[2:33:19] I tell you friends love is going to win
[2:33:21] the elect
[2:33:23] the law will not win
[2:33:25] at your new church there the law is not
[2:33:28] going to win when they walk in and y'all
[2:33:31] are measuring how high their skirts are
[2:33:33] or this person's so stinky they must
[2:33:35] have just walked and they haven't taken
[2:33:37] a bath for how long
[2:33:39] well neither did John the Baptist
[2:33:42] [Music]
[2:33:44] y'all want to talk about some Financial
[2:33:46] portfolios what about John the Baptist
[2:33:48] Financial portfolio
[2:33:50] you think it was very good
[2:33:52] come on everybody what do y'all what do
[2:33:55] you all think about Paul and his uh tax
[2:33:57] return for the years he was in prison
[2:34:02] we can get quiet but I'm talking reality
[2:34:05] I've been in prison for two years wow
[2:34:07] what do you think he said to his wife
[2:34:09] about their income
[2:34:12] these are real people
[2:34:14] I've talked to you about Mary Joseph
[2:34:16] Paul John the Baptist
[2:34:19] well I got three locusts to my name and
[2:34:21] I just ate two of them for breakfast and
[2:34:23] I'm looking forward to them for I'm
[2:34:25] gonna eat a locust for supper
[2:34:27] that's my portfolio
[2:34:30] where do you live I live in a cave
[2:34:34] who's your friends I got a bunny rabbit
[2:34:36] that comes in the morning I got a big
[2:34:38] moose that walks in the evening man I'm
[2:34:40] not gonna take him out one day
[2:34:42] my goodness you got a real circle of
[2:34:45] friendship well that is the greatest man
[2:34:48] that walked on the face of the Earth he
[2:34:51] was smelly
[2:34:52] maybe not brushed his teeth maybe we
[2:34:55] need to be a little bit more careful
[2:34:57] about how we judge one another then
[2:34:59] maybe we need to look at about matters
[2:35:01] of the heart instead of how they hold
[2:35:03] themselves
[2:35:06] maybe that sister has a little body odor
[2:35:08] because she's been carrying a baby
[2:35:10] throughout service or she has two little
[2:35:12] children she wasn't able to curl her
[2:35:14] hair this morning because she stayed up
[2:35:16] half the night with somebody that was
[2:35:18] screaming and snotty amen just maybe
[2:35:21] maybe
[2:35:24] they could use a little encouragement
[2:35:25] come to the house of God you say well
[2:35:28] brother I think our church is built upon
[2:35:30] helping all the strong people
[2:35:32] all the people that's got it together
[2:35:34] well really I think the church ought to
[2:35:37] be built upon helping those that are
[2:35:39] needy
[2:35:42] doing what we can for others
[2:35:44] and not really caring what everybody
[2:35:46] else thinks that as time goes on you
[2:35:48] find out they're not really friends
[2:35:50] anyway
[2:35:51] seek first the kingdom of God today
[2:35:54] what are you becoming
[2:35:57] what are you becoming today but
[2:35:59] sometimes we need a good kick in the
[2:36:01] pants
[2:36:02] if you're a brother and you need a good
[2:36:04] kick in the pants
[2:36:07] but we don't like you well you need a
[2:36:09] good kick in the pants amen you need you
[2:36:12] can do better for that lady you married
[2:36:13] her you made the three children or the
[2:36:16] one children or whatever
[2:36:18] let's serve the Lord
[2:36:20] I'd rather cry and weep in the house of
[2:36:22] God and look strange to the world but
[2:36:25] yet know the Lord Jesus then be out here
[2:36:27] in some stadium with my shirt ripped off
[2:36:29] and going crazy for somebody running
[2:36:32] around out there that don't even know me
[2:36:34] and
[2:36:35] and you're just whatever well we won
[2:36:38] today you didn't win nothing
[2:36:41] it's we well our team that we like
[2:36:43] you're that's nonsense
[2:36:45] that's gonna fade away just like their
[2:36:48] football and now it's World Cup and all
[2:36:51] kinds of balls and things it's just
[2:36:53] gonna fade away friends are your
[2:36:55] physique and all your good looks and
[2:36:57] everything and I'm closing up all my
[2:36:59] notes Hallelujah we want to be good

[2:55:41] charge
[2:55:47] [Music]
[2:55:56] this is
[2:55:58] [Applause]
[2:56:04] amen God bless you just have your seats
[2:56:06] for a moment if you would
[2:56:08] it's a military service up down up down
[2:56:12] and but I wanted to before service I was
[2:56:15] just reading there and
[2:56:17] and reading where the the brother said
[2:56:19] not Brother John
[2:56:21] the brother said he said we're like the
[2:56:24] scripture says the man that looks in the
[2:56:26] mirror
[2:56:27] and then he goes away and he forgets
[2:56:28] what he looked like and he said what
[2:56:31] happens when you come into an anointed
[2:56:32] service is you get to look in the mirror
[2:56:35] of God's word and see yourself as he
[2:56:37] sees you
[2:56:38] under the anointing is when you find out
[2:56:41] who and what you truly truly are and if
[2:56:43] you believe that an anointed Minister
[2:56:45] has been standing here then it has been
[2:56:47] God showing us in a mirror of his word
[2:56:49] what we look like to him and so he said
[2:56:52] the problem he says is that we are in an
[2:56:54] anointed service he says but as soon as
[2:56:57] we leave the anointed service we forget
[2:56:58] what we look like that moment in what
[2:57:01] the very presence of God and he says
[2:57:03] we've got to make sure that we don't
[2:57:05] forget what the word was telling us we
[2:57:07] were in that service he said because he
[2:57:09] said otherwise we're supposed to be
[2:57:11] writing a book of Acts he says and we
[2:57:13] end up writing The Chronicles of
[2:57:14] laodicea because what we are rich we are
[2:57:17] increased with Goods we have need of
[2:57:18] nothing we are not poor we don't have
[2:57:21] needs anymore but when the word is going
[2:57:23] forth and you're in the spotlight of the
[2:57:25] Holy Spirit you sit there and you say
[2:57:27] that's me that's me but you leave the
[2:57:29] service and then you say maybe I'm not
[2:57:31] quite the way it said and you forget
[2:57:33] because we are forgetful hearers amen so
[2:57:36] I want to encourage you this morning
[2:57:38] I'm going to cover a couple things that
[2:57:40] jumped out at me just by way of reminder
[2:57:42] because there was a theme this weekend
[2:57:45] there are a couple major themes in there
[2:57:47] amen but we don't want to walk out and
[2:57:49] say
[2:57:50] I forget what he said don't take brother
[2:57:53] John this brother John we got so many
[2:57:55] brother John's here don't take my word
[2:57:57] for it go back this week and listen to
[2:57:59] every single service again when you
[2:58:01] don't have to go out and watch your kids
[2:58:03] and you're not angry because your son is
[2:58:05] crunching in the people's ears in front
[2:58:06] of you and you've got this going on that
[2:58:08] going on go back and listen take it and
[2:58:11] listen and say Lord what was your word
[2:58:14] what was the mirror showing me that I
[2:58:16] was this weekend brother John started
[2:58:18] the first thing he said and he warned us
[2:58:21] he encouraged us he said restore a
[2:58:23] spirit that calls us to ask for another
[2:58:26] chance for those that are causing issues
[2:58:28] or falling away
[2:58:29] Emma
[2:58:30] the second thing he said is if Satan is
[2:58:33] trying to get in at such a young age so
[2:58:35] is the holy spirit let us be pressing in
[2:58:38] to the Holy Spirit as much as it's
[2:58:40] trying to press into us he said Don't
[2:58:42] Fear The Wrath of the father Embrace his
[2:58:45] forgiveness make things right
[2:58:47] remember he told the story about how he
[2:58:49] had told that lie to his dad and he held
[2:58:51] it for so long and his dad when he
[2:58:53] finally told him said why didn't you
[2:58:54] tell me before yes it was no big deal it
[2:58:57] was no big deal I'm your father what am
[2:58:59] I going to kick you out because you took
[2:59:01] no come quickly and make it right he
[2:59:04] said our response to Restoration should
[2:59:06] always be rejoicing and praise not anger
[2:59:10] and skepticism
[2:59:12] he said are we getting the people to
[2:59:13] church are we getting people to Christ
[2:59:17] and he said both sons needed restoration
[2:59:19] both were arrogant proud and Headstrong
[2:59:23] and in the end he said good works don't
[2:59:25] cover bad behavior I thought that was
[2:59:28] the most poignant thing that it was a an
[2:59:31] amazing statement good works don't cover
[2:59:33] bad behavior then he preached I will
[2:59:35] restore and he said a word from God will
[2:59:38] turn your heart not your head I was
[2:59:42] reading there the brother was saying
[2:59:43] that Satan is in a psychological warfare
[2:59:45] with us and we get up into head games
[2:59:47] but he says God turns the heart and then
[2:59:50] the heart from out of there comes the
[2:59:51] faith to turn your mind into that which
[2:59:53] is of Christ amen he said Jesus Christ
[2:59:56] is the solution to every issue and
[2:59:58] problem that we have
[3:00:00] he said restore means a covenant of
[3:00:03] peace to be complete and sound to be
[3:00:05] finished uninjured to make safe and
[3:00:08] whole to compensate to make good to
[3:00:10] reward and repay and to make an end of
[3:00:13] your current condition
[3:00:15] he said Spirits travel on Words watch
[3:00:18] what you say
[3:00:20] this was the biggest thing in my mind
[3:00:21] that he said last night he said in the
[3:00:23] time of your wounding the holy spirit is
[3:00:26] released in that situation becomes
[3:00:29] character in your life
[3:00:31] he says sometimes it takes a jolt a
[3:00:34] shock to get our attention and turn us
[3:00:37] towards God
[3:00:40] sometimes we're so caught up in what
[3:00:41] caused the shock rather than saying is
[3:00:43] it turning me toward the father amen and
[3:00:46] then he said restoration takes time
[3:00:49] healing takes time he says you have to
[3:00:52] be willing to have patience with God
[3:00:55] with yourself
[3:00:57] and with others
[3:00:59] he says we want a drive-through
[3:01:01] restoration that was amazing don't we
[3:01:04] just want that one service in the
[3:01:07] presence of the Lord and I won't ever
[3:01:08] have to worry again listen he works in
[3:01:11] time
[3:01:12] sometimes there are Miracles and we've
[3:01:14] seen him in everybody's life here we've
[3:01:15] had a miracle I guarantee you but more
[3:01:17] often he works through time and it is a
[3:01:20] restoration process not a restoration
[3:01:22] moment and he finished with sheep are
[3:01:25] dumb
[3:01:26] that's why the Lord has to be our
[3:01:28] Shepherd and then today he started with
[3:01:31] the acceptable year you know what the
[3:01:32] acceptable year is is when the anointed
[3:01:34] message comes forth that's the
[3:01:37] acceptable year because many people read
[3:01:39] Isaiah before that but when the anointed
[3:01:41] message comes that is the acceptable
[3:01:43] year that is the time of the Lord's
[3:01:45] choosing for you to enjoy the benefits
[3:01:47] that he's written he said where are you
[3:01:49] in your conversation and where is your
[3:01:52] brotherly love
[3:01:53] you know so often he talked about we're
[3:01:55] poor but he says to him that is of a
[3:01:58] poor and a contrite spirit a repentant
[3:02:01] Spirit an unworthy Spirit sometimes
[3:02:03] that's what it takes to get anywhere
[3:02:05] with God is we have to see ourselves as
[3:02:07] poor that's the laodiceem problem they
[3:02:09] can never see themselves in need amen
[3:02:11] we've got to see ourselves in that place
[3:02:14] he was talking about the the Rich Young
[3:02:16] Ruler and Jesus said one thing thou
[3:02:18] lacquest yes we all have one thing we
[3:02:20] lack
[3:02:21] and God's going to put his finger right
[3:02:23] on the thing that we value most and say
[3:02:25] give it up
[3:02:26] will you give it up will you give up
[3:02:28] your money will you give up your
[3:02:30] popularity your influence your good
[3:02:32] looks your career opportunities whatever
[3:02:34] it might be like the young man that
[3:02:36] wanted to play football will you give it
[3:02:37] up for me because I'll use you in a way
[3:02:39] that nobody else could ever use you
[3:02:42] amen
[3:02:44] he said how hard is it for a rich man to
[3:02:46] enter the kingdom of God
[3:02:48] why because you think you have
[3:02:50] everything yeah he said how hard is it
[3:02:52] for a rich believer to enter the kingdom
[3:02:54] of God that thinks I have need of
[3:02:56] nothing
[3:02:57] and then the first thing God had to do
[3:02:58] to ever use me was humble me had to
[3:03:00] Humble me and say you're nothing you are
[3:03:03] nothing yes unless I'm using you but
[3:03:06] listen you say I am rich
[3:03:08] they said how can how can it even get
[3:03:10] into the kingdom of God he said With God
[3:03:13] all things are possible amen amen it
[3:03:17] said he became poor that us through his
[3:03:18] poverty could have his riches amen poor
[3:03:22] means you can't get out of your current
[3:03:23] condition yourself
[3:03:25] amen how many times are we in that how
[3:03:28] many times are we saying Lord I've tried
[3:03:30] everything I can do and I can't get out
[3:03:32] of it that is the one that he comes to
[3:03:34] when you stop trying and say this is
[3:03:36] going to take a supernatural Restoration
[3:03:38] in my life to get me to where I need to
[3:03:41] go amen
[3:03:42] that's good
[3:03:44] he said they that seek the Lord shall
[3:03:46] not want in any good thing we need to
[3:03:49] stop confessing we are so poor because
[3:03:51] love is going to win
[3:03:53] the elect amen we have been blessed
[3:03:56] brother John
[3:03:59] some of us have been in the spotlight
[3:04:01] this weekend
[3:04:03] brother John did I tell you anything
[3:04:05] about any person in this church any
[3:04:09] situation
[3:04:10] nothing can you stand up and say it
[3:04:14] nothing
[3:04:16] thank you
[3:04:18] he spoke into my life can you say he
[3:04:21] spoke into your life this morning
[3:04:24] that is what the Holy Spirit does it is
[3:04:27] so perfect and it is on time and it is
[3:04:31] specific and it is personal that's the
[3:04:34] kind of God I want to serve because he
[3:04:37] said he only comes once to the
[3:04:39] unbeliever
[3:04:40] he only comes once to the unbeliever but
[3:04:42] to his child he comes again and again
[3:04:45] and again and sometimes he's got to get
[3:04:47] you where the pigs are sometimes you
[3:04:49] just take one foot out that door and he
[3:04:51] touches you and you say whoops I'll turn
[3:04:53] back father amen we have been blessed we
[3:04:57] have seen the supernatural in our midst
[3:04:59] this weekend amen he has spoken to me I
[3:05:02] know he has spoken to many of you I've
[3:05:03] seen you responding in the sources in
[3:05:05] your worship and your praise crying
[3:05:07] reaching out to God and God is there to
[3:05:10] meet the needs that we have and he has
[3:05:11] come in and he has spoken to us this
[3:05:13] evening in this these these last few
[3:05:15] days brother John God bless you for for
[3:05:17] for following the leadership of the holy
[3:05:19] spirit amen can we thank brother John
[3:05:22] for his goodness and coming out amen
[3:05:26] and let's all stand together if we would
[3:05:30] I'll say one thing
[3:05:32] nothing encourages a minister more than
[3:05:34] when people come up and say you were
[3:05:36] talking to me this weekend so if you
[3:05:39] have if he has talked to you not him
[3:05:41] brother John you didn't say a word did
