pray Lord so many are out and sick and Away Lord we pray your special Grace in touch to them each one Lord just be with us now we ask in Jesus name amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 just spoke briefly with Brother David Nash this afternoon so he did get in safely last night I knew that and and no no issues there so very glad for that and he asked me to thank the church for their offering and you were very generous and took him by surprise I think and I talked to him about you know the different needs that he had and trips he was making and that and I said you know um you know are are your your costs covered for your your Honduras trip and he said well they are now and he meant the offering we gave him and I said no Brother David that's not for your trip that's for you that's that's how you make a living is off of this and and I said so I'll I'll talk to to the to the trustees or or the treasurer and and see if we can't pay for your ticket as well so I talked to brother Mark and so we paid for his ticket as well so he thanked us for that as well but it really really touched his heart and he teared up on me there just a little just it took him by surprise that we'd support him not just his ministry but him and his family he's got needs he's 71 years old and and he has needs and they've got costs and these days everybody has them and so he was very thankful for that so asked me to to to just pass on the appreciation to the church and you know he was saying on the way of the airport he says you guys get the credit for what happens on those those trips I can't go if people can't support me and if people can't pay for it he can only cover so much himself and and so he said the credit goes to the people that support me so you get to be missionaries when you pay your ties and that's where it comes from it's ties ties aren't just for the Pastor it's for the ministry amen and that's what we do and we support multiple ministers around the globe and brother brother David Nash is one of them and and we do that because that's what's that's what it's meant to do so we don't need to take an offering up for that that comes out of the ties that's what you've already paid in so that's a we've done but thank you for your faithfulness in that also thanks for the hard work going into the meetings and the specials and it certainly was appreciative and the anointing that comes with those things it's a game Cher many times for a service so especially sister Moren and sister Priscilla doing their specials and I know Priscilla did it with very little practice kind of spur the moment and so we appreciate that as well we still got many sick out many recovering I'm still not there 100% I've been fighting through this for about a week but it's not got me yet and so I'm here amen and I'm I'm happy to be here for that but just keep each one in prayer Brother Paul's got a viral throat infection so remember him especially and the different ones so but we're thankful to be here amen I'm thankful to to be here behind the pulpit it's funny you get a break and then you're ready to get right back in the saddle and itching to to get up there so I'm trusting that's a good sign amen second Peter chapter 1 we ought to be able to say this almost by memory now amen 2 Peter 1 and verse4 says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust the divine nature is in your soul and the corruption that's in your body is through lust amen so you got a flesh thing and you've got a a divine nature thing and he says we've got to press to the divine nature even though we're stuck in something that's corrupted there's a battle that's got to be one here and he says let's focus on the divine nature he says besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness he says and then to brotherly kindness at charity amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and as you can imagine we're continuing on and manifesting time and we're going to be speaking on this this thought of Charity but I'm going to call this a Capstone and and brother Bram I'll read a quote and then just step into some things here but brother Brown would say this he says the next thing then add charity which is love and he says that's the capping Stone and we're we're going to be talking about what this charity really means and there's lots of pieces to this and I've got notes and notes on top of notes with this and it's pretty chunky so we're just going to take one chunk every service and some of them will be shorter services and some will be longer services and this one will be a little bit shorter maybe tonight but I just want to take my time with this because when we're talking about the Holy Ghost you can get all the way through these Christian attributes and if you don't get to charity then everything you've done up to that point is wasted it's the way it is you've got to go all the way or else it's as if you never went anywhere if you come up only to brotherly kindness you'll be judged on works that's what you're left with because you're not going to be in the bride you're not going to go in a Rapture because you got to have the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead in your body for you to go on that Rapture so you've got to go all the way to the top and if you don't go there then you're going to go only by works and chances are you'll fall and slip away to a degree because you didn't go all the way with the word you didn't go all the way to Perfection like Paul said Paul said go on to Perfection and brother Bram says leave The Works behind and leave the doctrines behind and go into perfect love and that's what we're talking about in these things and you know what that tells me when Paul says go on to Perfection it means there's more than works it means there's more than doct it means there's more than how I dress and the things I say but there's a an encompassing life there's an indwelling that we're talking about in these things because those things are great we've got to know what we believe we've got to know the doctrine that we have and why we do the things we do and these these things it's structural for the believer but it's not life but when we come to charity now we're talking about the literal life of Jesus Christ brother Brown would say this he says you take a young Minister now this isn't about a minister this is this could be about anyone this could apply to anyone but he says you take a young Minister that feels the call of God in his heart he'll repent of his sins go off to school get his education which is fine he'll come back he will still smoke cigarettes maybe maybe he's still got a lustful spirit and he'll say oh I don't want to do that Lord take it away from me he says the spirit of God will come and sanctify his soul it'll clean his soul up it'll it'll take his it says and take that desire away from him then he'll be brought right up to the borderline set right in the meetings and watch the working of the Holy Spirit see others get healed hear them speak with tongues and see signs and wonders done he says you can have a Sanctified soul you can have a cleaned up soul but that's not all the way that's just a preparation for what's going to come next he says they'll sit around and watch it but they're afraid to put their hand on it they'll look and they'll see what other people do with it and they'll see the the signs and the Wonders and the effects on their life and they're afraid to put their hand on it they're afraid to go through the change that those people had to go through he says that's that borderline believer that's the fellow if he ever turns away there's no more remission of sins for him he says he'll stand right up here even look over into the land who's received the knowledge of the truth knew that that was right but because of prestige well if I do this it'll do this and if I accept that it'll do this he says see they refuse it and they walk away from it you'll see people that come into this church even from out in the community and whatnot and they've got to recognize that if they want what we've got they've got to get what we have they've got to go through the same process and it's going to have the same effect and it might be different for each one of us some of us have had to give up family more than others some of us have had to change relationships and careers and and all these sorts of things but no matter what when you lay hold of it there's going to be a change in your life and you've got to be willing to pay the price and you've got to count that cost ahead of time and really what he's saying is they've counted the cost and they've said it's not worth it he says they refuse it they walk away from it and he said Paul said count the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy thing they went that far to bring him on up a step to look over into and have a knowledge of it he says he was saved and Sanctified but comes up here to look over to receive the holy ghost that new birth he wants nothing to do with it now I can speak maybe to to the young people tonight that there's going to be a time and you look now and you look at Mom and you look at dad and you look at the the other people in the church and mostly the adults I would say and you can say I'm okay with dressing right and I'm okay with looking right and I'm okay with doing this and I'm okay with not doing that but that's not the end of it that's only the start of it because there has to come a time where you lay hold of eternal life the person of eternal life and when you do it will shake your life to the core everything changes when you get the Holy Ghost and you got to make a decision first that you want it cuz that'll take you through the statue of a perfect man and then having done that then you've got to lay hold and say now I want it I want it and I've gone through the process and I've I've gone through the pain and I've gone through the testing and the trials but I don't want to go there and then just sit there and not get it but I want this in my life and I want to go all the way with God Amen we see what happens and and you know everything we've talked about to this point is big and you go through those seven Christian attributes and it'll change your life and this signific ific way but there comes a point where You' got to make a decision Daniel had to make a decision Paul had to make a decision Peter had to make a decision the three Hebrew children had to make a decision David had to make a decision as to was he going to go on or was he going to stay back with everyone else and we've got to do the exact same thing and these things will develop our character then we'll see as we go into this tonight a little bit that all of this is really proving your character it's proving what's inside of you it's proving the attributes inside of you though but then we come to this fin one and brother brandham says it is the Holy Ghost and that's not an attribute it's a person and that's the big difference all the rest of these things were attributes but when we come to charity you don't have an attribute this isn't something you can put on and put off and you can turn on and turn off but it's a person and it's the person of Christ inside of our life amen this charity we're talking about it's a special thing brother BR would say this he says excuse this expression but I told my wife here not long ago we're both getting old and I said to her do you love me like you used to she said I certainly do and I said you know I love you so much till I would like to take you and pull you inside of me Co so we could be really be one more he wanted to be so much closer to his wife and of course we know brother bam traveled so much he was in the fields so much and then he would go off in the woods to try and decompress and but he said I love you so much that I just wish I could fold you into me so we could be more one than we are now he says now take that and multiply it by a 100 million and you'll find out how that the believer Who falls in love with Christ wants to get into him because it's a love so all of these seven attributes that he's pulled out of your life here is developing a love for Christ that maybe you didn't even have in the first place it's drawing out that great internal desire it's the Deep calling to the deep and that's what's responding through all this and you get to the end and really what you're going to do is you're going to accept the marriage proposal that's what we're coming up to in the thing and this is a quote I've read many times in this series but it I always love to read it because I want to remind what's going on it says and here he's going to show us how that through these promises what we read in second Peter 1 we might be partakers of Christ's divine nature see we think all of those things was his divine nature no that's attributes the the divine nature is what makes all of those things live it's the thing that makes all of those things work the way they're truly supposed to work he says these mortal bodies how that we can be partakers but I'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house where God can dwell he wants to dwell in you the whole goal the whole purpose of this message the whole purpose of what he's talking about is for you to get Christ in you that's the Great Commission that's what they're trying to get people to he says he wants to make you like himself himself he wants you to be reflecting his being continuously not just one moment or one day but a continuous shine Shining Light that everyone can see he says we're not building an organization I'm not here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build organization but Christ sent me to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word he says by his word see build up the individual to that place so we come up through these seven attributes from Faith all the way to brotherly kindness and now that we're at the end of it and brother Adam is reminding us this is to build you to a place for God to dwell in amen these attributes these seven attributes from Faith through brotherly kindness they're the house that God has ordained and he has structured to live in but there is no one in the house yet and the purpose of a house is for somebody to live in it so all of this is a structure it's a place that God would be pleased to dwell in amen but God is potentially coming to you but unless you have the house built he he not going to come in but once the house is done now somebody's got the opportunity to come into these things you know it's interesting up by Brother Joe's house I saw you know they've knocked it down now but there was a house there for so long that God and and they had it built and they had the outside somewhat finished but nobody finished the house and what happened is the house eventually fell into disarray because there was nobody in it when somebody's in it then they take care of a house don't they you'll see somebody that lives in a house they maintain it and they make sure that everything's working because they want it to be comfortable for themselves and so when we build this house the point is to get the person inside of it that it was built for and not just have this beautiful building it has no purpose except for looks and that's not what God's Building is a thing just for looks but when we're reading in in second Peter 1 here and Peter says to add charity that's a word that only appears in the new testimony because that word charity and you'll hear brother bham talk about this a lot of times it's Agape it's divine love and I find it amazing that it's only in the New Testament because in the New Testament is the only place that this charity ever comes out because this Divine love could not be shown in the way that it's shown in the way it's meant to be shown except in the New Testament because in the Old Testament we're under the blood of bulls and goats and our sins are covered but the price isn't paid yet and so that Divine love is really the key to the kingdom and it's what we need in our lives but God can't give it to us because our sin there's a sin debt that's got to paid but then he comes to Calvary and he pays the price and as soon as the price is paid now access is made to God and now Divine love can project because when Divine love is projected Grace takes over brother brandham said and what happens is that we're now made acceptable in the Beloved and he can release Divine love to his bride the way that he always wanted he can give her the Holy Ghost he can indwell in her now because she's perfect in his sight she's under the blood cuz he paid the price and so we see through the new Testament the New Covenant that the person of Christ paid the price and the person of Christ is the key to the kingdom that's that's the way to get into it and Brother David talked about this a little bit and and of course Jesus said to it he said the kingdom of God doesn't come with observation but the kingdom of God is within you it's within you and it's not something but it's someone and it's the person of Christ and it's the Holy Ghost and so when Jesus Christ paid the price on the on the cross paid the price on the cross what did he do he released his spirit and his Spirit was now available to come back on the bride and that is the thing that brings us into fullness with Christ it's the true form of Christianity it's eternal life it's resurrection power I it's Holiness it's love it's Joy it's all of these things personified in The Believer because it's the very nature it's the very Life of Christ coming back on us but that a eight thing that that that that Peter talks about that Capstone is charity and we see by the word of God that Char it is none other than God himself it's not an attribute but it's a person 1 John 4 says beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God you've got to be born of God to have the love of God and you've got to know God to have the love of God and then and then John leaves no no question about what he's saying he says he that loveth not knoweth not God so if you don't love the with this agape love and this is the exact same word Agape he says you you can't Agape he says unless you know God so who who he that loveth not knows not God for God is love that word love is the same as Charity and it's agape and it's the attribute of God it's the very nature of God and you can't have love if you don't know God and Brother David talked about this a little bit it was already in my notes I'd already started studying last week but he he he he talked about knowing and he talked about Mary and John ties the idea of loving with this idea of knowing and this isn't knowing the way we would think of knowing we think 1+ 1 equal 2 is knowing or you know the square root of nine is three is knowing no no no that's not knowing and then you say well Malachi 4 has been has come in our day no that's not the knowing he's talking about knowing what's under the seals is not the knowing he's talking about but this knowing is a different word and this word is also only used in the New Testament because this kind of knowing can only happen through the Holy Ghost and this word is is josco and it means to personally know by divine revelation in other words you know first hand somebody didn't tell you it you didn't hear a video or you didn't listen to a tape if I could put it that way but it's a personal revelation from Christ amen you you were a part of what happened that's the knowing he's talking about it's a personal experience and then it says it's so to know personally by divine revelation or it's to know by in intimate experience and that's speaking of the relationship the intimate relationship between a wife and a husband so there's two knowings it's a personal experience and it's an intimate experience so if we look in the scriptures we'll see where Jesus uses this word and the disciples came to him and they said why speakest thou to the people in Parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given it's meant to you to have a person experience a personal divine revelation of what this is but it's not given to them and that's only for the children of God that's the only ones can know it because it's tied to love and only the True Believer can get love which is the Holy Ghost then he'd say in Matthew 7 he says not everyone that says unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works there's lots of claims to him being their Lord but he says in verse 23 then will I profess unto them I never knew you in other words I never gave you a personal divine revelation I never had an intimate experience with you you knew about me you knew me but I didn't know you there was no relationship he says I never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity there works Pro that they didn't have an intimate relationship because their Works were not what he wanted done my wife knows what I want done and she only knows that because we're in relationship nobody else could walk up and say well I'm doing this in brother John's name no only my wife knows that because she's the only one I share those things with so you can come up and say I did all these things in Jonathan carlette's name but if I haven't told you what I want then you're not going to get it right that's what he says you did lots of things and maybe there were even wonderful things in your eyes but it wasn't n what I wanted and it's because you didn't know me you didn't have an intimate relationship then we come to that verse and Brother David read this this weekend where the Angel's talking to Mary and then Mary said to the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man so Mary's saying I haven't I'm not married I'm I I I'm just engaged I haven't had an intimate relationship with Joseph yet I I'm a virgin I haven't been touched and she's saying how can I have a baby because I've never had intimate relationships with a man and it's the same knowing that that Christ is talking about in this word so we're looking at charity and John says charity comes from personal experience and by intimacy you can't have Divine love you can't be divine love you can't be a dwelling place for it until you've had a personal intimate relationship with God not just that yes I believe or yes I associate with or yes I come to church but a personal relationship with Christ is the only way that gets you to this and let me say it this way you don't even know what true love is until you get the Holy Ghost you don't know you don't know and if you don't you want proof of it look around this world because they take love and they apply it in the way that they think is best and we have record divorce rates we have broken homes we have sensuality and we have perversion beyond what it's been since the days of Sodom and Gomorrah that's what happens because when you turn down true love you turn to the Beast nature and the Beast nature is always self-gratifying always you'll end up doing what's best for you in the end and it'll take you down a path of Destruction but John would say clearly and he's using the same word Agape that Peter used that word charity and John says we've got to divinely love one another that means that if you have the Holy Ghost and I don't I can't love you the way you love me and we can't have love for one for one for another the right way until we both have the Holy Ghost because it'll bring a commonality it'll bring a Unity it'll bring an understanding to what's going on even when it doesn't feel like love because we're playing from the Same Love Book we're reading from the Same Love Letter and so we can take it back to there and by the Holy Ghost we can submit ourselves to this and in that we can submit ourselves one to another in love and we can do what's right for one another by this and that's the love as well amen but John's saying you got to divinely love one another a and that Divine love is only by the holy spirit because that's the only thing that Divine love is is the very nature of God himself amen they're one and the same you can't have Divine love in God it is one and the same it's it's it's a it's a package that comes together look at what Paul would say in Romans 8 he would say who then shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword he says as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter but then he says nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us so here's the thing but when we were unlovable Christ loved us and so nothing we go through before we get the Holy Ghost or after we get the Holy Ghost can separate us from the love of Christ because he says you're engraved in the palms of my head I won't lose one that the father gave to me he's saying nothing that's happened nothing that's happening and nothing that will happen can separate you from the love of God and so you can look at it especially when you've got the Holy Ghost and say through all of this we're conquerors listen if I die in this Pulpit tonight I win I go directly into a place of peace and rest I go directly to a place that I've been longing for all of my life but if I stay here and I go through these things yet I'm a conqueror as well because he'll never leave me he'll never forsake me he'll take me through to the End of the Age amen and Paul says for I am persuaded see he he lists it out and then he says I'm persuaded of the very thing I'm talking about why because he's been there he's done that he's been through hard times Paul's been stoned and left for dead Paul's been uh turned on he's been called out he's been whipped he's been thrown into jail he's been beaten he's been bitten he's been Shipwrecked all these things and he says I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord Paul's saying when you get this love when you recognize you're a part of it when you recognize that it's given to you the love that God has for you then he says you'll realize that there is nothing can beat you this this is the the the the the the unbeatable combination of what it means to be a child of God is that nothing can separate you from him he's got you he's got a hedge about you he's got a plan for you he's got a purpose and Satan can't stop it you can't stop it I can't stop it God's going to take us all the way through amen amen if we could I think sometimes we need to read that every day and just say nothing's going to stop the plan of God in my life I mean nothing's going to hold me back from fulfilling his word in this age maybe today I lose more than I win but I'm going to win in the end no matter what cuz there's going to be days where it feels like all we do is lose maybe we have a couple wins and then we just drop the ball on something and it feels like we've lost the day that has nothing to do with it wins and losses we've already run the books the book has been written we've read the back of the book He's already won the price is paid we're sinless we're spotless we're guaranteed to make it across the Finish Line amen nothing can separate us from the love of God why because when God comes to dwell in the house he never leaves God makes perfect choices and when he comes into a house it's because he knows that that house will stand that it's built on a firm foundation that it's built of the right stuff remember brother BR was saying God makes things out of real material it's built out of real material and God knows that it will not fall amen once he comes in and dwells with us he's never going to just leave us he's not going to kick us to the curb because like I was saying earlier this charity is really a marriage proposal and it's an acceptance and it's God saying I'm ready to come into your life and you've got to be able to accept that you've got to be willing to do that and it's not just understanding and emotionalism and dos and don'ts and these things but it's now you're coming into the unity with the mind of Christ to understand what he's doing and wanting to do inside of your life God doesn't put us through all this work and this effort and character building and testing and trying just to sit us or kick us out to the curb at the end it's not a game for God but it's got a real purpose behind these things amen he doesn't play with our feelings he doesn't play with our time he doesn't play with our marriages and these different things but he's doing it with purpose and that purpose is love which which means it's for our good every single time Jesus would say this remember they asked Jesus about divorce and the reasons for it he said in Mark 10 he says but from the beginning of the creation God made the male and female for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more Twain but they are one flesh he says they come in as two they go out as one and it's a supernatural blending it's a Heavenly blending because it's a reflection of Christ in the bride he says now what therefore God had joined together let not man put a under this is why I said when God comes into the house he never leaves because the nature of God is to stay with his mate it's to stay with his bride and he said you were supposed to do it but out of the hardness of your heart Moses gave you a decree of divorcement but God's not going to divorce you God's not going to lay you aside God has picked you and he picks perfectly and he chooses you and then it's up to you you now to let him in or let him out what was he doing what was he doing through these seven attributes we've been talking about because remember God can a man can only divorce a woman if she commits adultery and what God does through that that that work of these seven attributes is he's proving you he's proving your character he's proving that when times get tough you won't run away when the money gets low that you won't go and fall back on your own self that when your health gets bad that you're not going to run away from him because he hasn't healed you or he hasn't done this or he hasn't done that he's proving you through all these things because when he gets married he wants to know what he's getting married to and this is a process he used to show what this is amen it's not about our feelings though feelings are a part of it it's not about what we say and what we do but he's looking into the very inside of our hearts amen and seeing what we'll do when the screws are applied when the pressure comes down when times get tough and when we go through those things then he's just checking off a list yep just like just like me just like me just like me wow they keep using the word they keep filtering the word look no matter what happens doesn't matter what people say they act the same doesn't matter what people do they keep doing what I tell them to do they don't go to the left they don't go to the right they're stable they're steady and what's he doing he's showing what's inside of you because it's a house that he's building and it's a house that he's certifying and it's a house that he's ordained for his Dwelling Place brother B would say this he says now you can't think with your body you think with your mind and in there is where too many of Christians stop and they can just like the corn in the field and the weed in the field be Anointed with the same holy spirit that the real Believers Anointed with if you want to get into that more go listen to anoint false anointed ones at the end time brother B would talk about someone like balum who was a prophet a genuine Prophet but he was yet an unbeliever he had a gift he had a calling he was anointed and yet he was not a True Believer because when push came to shove he went for money and he went for influence rather than to do the will of God but he was anointed he was absolutely 100% anointed but the vessel was still dirty he says but down on the inside of that next realm the Third Realm is the soul and that's predestinated by God there is where the real sea germ lay lays is in there he says today so many are confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate any gift that God has got but he cannot bring that word word by word remember that Paul would say he said here a little there where word upon word line upon line Satan cannot build you up because he's a liar he's a thief he's a Tormentor and he's a destroyer Satan can't build you up he says he can impersonate any gift but he can't build you into the statue of a perfect son or daughter of God he can't do it because it's not in his nature to do it he only knows how to mimic and destroy but he cannot build up and he cannot redeem and he cannot give life so he says he can do any gift but he can't make you a real believer he can't change you from what you were into what you ought to be all he can do is work in your base nature he says that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he's always failed he says that's where the tape on false anointed ones or anointed ones is they can be Anointed with the spirit the Holy Spirit the literal real Holy Spirit anointed not not filled with but anointed it can be on them but not in them he says they can speak in tongues they can dance shout preach the gospel and they're still a devil that how do you even try and teach that to somebody that you can literally be anointed and be a devil you can be Anointed with the Holy Spirit and be a devil and yet we can see it in scripture we see it with balum we see it with Judas Judas was anointed the same as the other disciples did signs and wonders and yet he himself was a devil inside he was not a real believer he says it's the inside that's what we're talking about he says now remember Jesus said all the father has given me will come all will if your name was there in the beginning you're gonna make it and it's a finished work he says no man can come except my father draws him first remember Jesus said where I am you may be also this is an eternal work this is a finished work now remember the man chooses the woman accepts and so the choosing of God this is the beauty of of being in relationship with Christ is that we're Christ's choice and he makes a perfect choice the perfect one makes a perfect choice and like I've said before the question is are you going to come easy or you going to come the hard way cuz he's going to get you one way or the other because he's pulling on that word seed remember brother bam says it's that real seed Gene it's the inside of you that he's coming for he's not coming for Jonathan klette or or Amber coffee or Joshua Columbo or Betty Lush he's coming for the word inside of me my name has nothing to do with it I get a new name over there That's how little this flesh matters That's how little this this name that I have matters but he's coming for the word inside of me and that's my great rest is that he put it in there so he could come back for it he redeems what was already his he does not come for something that didn't belong for him that's the rest of the believer he chose me I didn't choose him because he came looking for me before I ever came looking for him anden he's the one that put the characteristics inside of us and he's the one that by the working of the holy spirit is drawing them out it's the seed word of God inside of us that responds to the word it's the Deep calling to the Deep it's the Deep responding to the Deep brother BR would say put it this way he says and when you have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly love he says then the Holy Spirit comes down and seals you you as a unit the same as he seals the church ages as a unit the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of the same material like Eve was made out of Adam a rib from the side he says here's the things that you have to have first you have to have those first seven attributes he says and you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them he's not saying it's not possible to imitate them he's saying you can't do it it won't work if you do he says they've got to be godsent and God born he says imitation only causes confusion remember the scripture says God is not the author of confusion amen it'll work the same for each and every one of us and it's it's if it's of God it's from God and that's the only way that it works for us the Eternal comes to the Eternal the word comes to the word you maybe I hope this doesn't sound too crude but for church especially but you know when you're walking around and this goes for brothers and sisters alike you know you're young people and and you're looking and you're you know wanting to get married and that and and we can see everything on the outside we can see the way you dress we can see the way you you do your hair we can see whether we can smell whether you smell nice whether you smell bad we can see how good or bad your skin is in these things but here's the thing this suit covers up a lot of flaws this suit covers up a lot of flaws and so if my wife hadn't married me yet she all she'd see was what I put on she'd see the outside but if we spend enough time in the courtship together then she she's going to see me in times where my hair isn't everyone in the perfect place she's going to see me when I'm tired she's going to see me when I'm worn out she's going to see me when I'm frustrated she's going to have an idea of what the real Jonathan klet is like isn't she but let me tell you when we get married she's going to see me in a way she's never seen me before and she's going to know if I've been eating Donuts she's going to know if I've been sucking in and hiding my stomach this time she's going to know if I've got to hairry back because now everything's being revealed and what Christ is doing through all of this process here is he's revealing what matters to him and it's what's on the inside but because remember he's not going to be surprised when he comes to the marriage to find what's waiting for him but you know what if if if you pred and you proded and youve you know they got clothes to make you do everything these days for men and women alike right you can make yourself look skinny with clothes and I know we don't wear makeup here necessarily but guess what you wake up next to a woman that always wears makeup and then you see what she looks like without makeup it's scary sometimes the Stark difference between those two and if you're always perfect on the outside when the marriage Night comes and the next morning comes guess what somebody's going to be in for a surprise if you've hidden your real self that whole time there's going to be a revealing that happens whether you like it or not now here's the thing if I I if you you you've been wearing clothes that make you look like you're 130 lbs and when you take them off it's obvious that you're 160 that's going to be a little bit startling going into your into your wedding night because your husband thinks you're 130 and you know you're 160 and you know he's going to find out tonight but what is it that keeps you from running away what is it that makes you still go through with it hopefully it's because you know he loves you for who you are regardless of what he finds regardless of of how you look regardless of these things what matters is is the thing that's on the inside of you he's loving you for the whole package your entire being not just whether you're perfect physically not just whether your skin is beautiful everywhere whether you wear hair extensions or not or whether you have bad breath or not that's not what he's marrying you for but he's marrying you for the core part of you and that's what he should have fallen in love with because if he marries you for your looks and your looks are false then there's going to be a there's going to be something that happens and he might he might hide his disappointment for a while but eventually that marriage will fall apart because you weren't what he thought he was marrying cuz it was was based on the external and what you presented to him was false same for guys listen I talked to ministers all over the the globe and you know they say these women come to us for and and couples come with marital counseling and they find out that their husband just wants to play games all the time and they had no idea until they married that he would play computer games or whatever for four hours a day and and that he kept that hidden or that he watches movies day in and day out or that he listens to music country music mus or maybe something else and she had no idea and then all of a sudden they're married and all of this comes out why cuz he was hiding who he was rather than revealing who he was but not that's not the way go God works God knows what's on the inside of us and he's proving it and he's testing and trying it so that when he comes to the house he knows what's there and it's been proven and it's been tested amen amen he chose us perfectly I love when it comes to David you know God never said David was perfect but David he said David's heart was perfect he said David's heart is like mine he didn't say David's like me he says he has a heart like mine it's on the inside that David is like God David made plenty of mistakes David had hot-headed moments David fell into sensuality David fell into temptation David fell into to thinking too much of himself but at the heart it was just like God and that's why God chose him to be king brother B puts it this way he says there's no Shadow at the Judgment for us to have a way of Escape at all because God in every way has combed everything to make us believe he's saying if you come to the Judgment There's No Escape saying I didn't know this or I didn't know that or I was no no there's no room for ignorance anymore he said God's taken everything away and he's given us every opportunity for us to believe but he says the first thing is his word he says seeming to me if someone wouldn't believe my word well I would wouldn't have much confidence in the person but God is different though you do not believe his word he's yet willing to come to you in some other way to manifest his love to you that's what I said when we are unlovable yet Christ loved us while we were yet sinners he died for us Paul said and he's saying God isn't like us where if somebody turns us down or somebody spurns us or somebody offends us we turn away he says no God comes around and if you won't take his word then he'll reveal himself even another way he'll do it in the heavens he'll do it the signs of the times he'll do it in a person it's the word but it's not maybe the Bible in the way that most people would expect he says isn't that wonderful how unworthy we creatures are of such love and now he brings it to us and he says brother sister that's what the world needs today is some more love of God not some more love some more love of God he says that's what the world's hungry for today is more love of God if we'd show a little more love to one another a little more love towards God how much better are our churches and individuals and how much better we'd be if we just love one another now catch this he says if we love one another then we can love God for God is love remember what John said by this shall all men know or Jesus said by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one for another you say I love God and you can't get together with the Believers you can't get along with Believers something's wrong something is wrong Church you know I've heard this said before I don't know if brother Braham said it i' I've been told he said it I haven't been able to find it he says I don't like that brother but I love that brother sometimes we have personality conflicts you know sometimes we just Rob each other the wrong way but we still ought to be able to see in the heart of that person that there is a Unity under the word amen that their intent is the same as ours their purpose is the same of our as ours they may go about it a different way way listen you compare the way Peter was to John they were two different people remember John was the one that laid on jesus' chest he was lydy he was he he was I would say he was he was maybe more emotional maybe more cuddly you know more touchy feely Peter was coarse and rough but Peter was Brash as well but Peter had courage two different approaches sometimes I wonder if maybe Peter and John didn't maybe not get along so great at all times cuz Peter was maybe a bit of a louder mouth and John was a bit of a quieter person personality but yet somehow they're both together at the gate beautiful they learn to walk together amen remember Paul Paul and Paul and Silas I think it was John Mark that they wanted to send along with them and Paul says no I can't travel with him Paul said that and so Paul ended up taking Silas rather than going with his other brother because he didn't work well with Paul he never said that brother doesn't have the Holy Ghost he didn't say he's not a Believer he just said I can't work with him he does things different than I do so we're going to go this way and we're going to do what the Holy Ghost tells us to do and he's going to go another way and the Holy Ghost is going to tell him what to do it's amazing today where we can have Ministries and we can have personalities and if you don't do it the way they want to do suddenly we don't you don't have the Holy Ghost no you do what he leads you to do and I'll do what I'll lead me he leads me to do and that's okay we don't have to be all cut from that same cloth we don't have to have the same approach in these things he says if we love one another then we can love God for God is love so the expectation is by the time you come to this place and really we're talking about marriage you move past performance and you're into relationship you move past legalism you move past Doctrine we're moving into Perfection now like Paul said and these things matter our words matter our actions matter they Define us but we're moving out past relation past performance and into relationship because we're coming into Unity my wife and I do things together for the sake of unity not because we always understand but we trust and she has to trust me and I've got to trust her and the things that I've committed to her I may not always agree but if she's done the work and I've committed it to her hands I'll let her go ahead with it and she's got to do the same thing for me because we're in it together because the two have become one and in unity now we start to work together in a way we didn't before and that's the basis that this is talking about we moved past doctrines and the dos and don'ts and we're at a place of peace and rest and Trust where we can do exactly what he wants us to do and we don't question you know brother BR we talked about brotherly kindness and that was really the peak of what you can do without the Holy Ghost and yet you if you don't trust him by the time you're getting to that you're not going to get very far because brotherly kindness requires you to do things to and with people that you wouldn't do in your flesh it's the hardest thing to do is forgive somebody when they've done something bad to you to go and extend a hand of friendship to extend a hand of help when they've slapped it down or they' rejected you but that's what brotherly kindness is about is about the other person person you've got to have that but now we're coming into relationship where whatever he asks you to do even if it's laying down your life even if it's laying down your job even if it's laying down this that and the other thing you'll be willing to do it because you trust him all through this he's you've been proving his word and he's been proving you he's been proving his word in your life and you've been showing him that you take it seriously and that you're willing to walk as he would amen and you know this why because you know that everything he does is for your good you're in love with him that's what brandom said at the beginning remember he says take what you would feel for your wife or your spouse and multiply by 100 million times he says and when you get in love with Christ you just want to be more and more in him with him amen it's a it's a union that's going on but if you think if you can Satan can ever get you to think that God's holding back on you he's got you licked because that's what he did with Eve remember in the garden he tried to make her he he successfully made her think that God was holding back on her he said God God doesn't want you to be like he is God's holding back God's up here and you're right here and he's trying to make you think you're up here he says but if you'll do what I tell you you'll be just like God and that's how he got Eve away was he made her think that where she was at wasn't good enough but she was exactly in a place of perfect peace and rest and as soon as he did she did what he said she lost it all fear came in and she didn't even want to be around Christ What a Sad Place why trying to get her to think that God's hoing back on us hey sometimes it feels like he's holding back we don't always get the answer to our prayer when we want it and we don't always get the answer we wanted in the first place do we and it's sometimes hard to think well God's holding back on us why do I have to go through this we can look around and one person gets healed immediately and somebody else is going for years and they don't get their total healing God why you holding back on me and we can get frustrated in our minds and we can get worn down and what is it Satan can commit an attack and say see he doesn't love you like he loves them and he starts playing mind games but there's got to be something in the soul that holds us amen and it's that deep calling to the Deep amen like I said before this is not a an attribute now it's a person and it's not something we flip the switch on and off but it's something that's continuously going through our lives brother Bram I was reading this quote the other day and he says he says people are looking for shine now you know they want Sparkle and they want everything to be shiny he says but he says the gospel glows with humility it's just constant a glow never goes away something that's bright you know what happens it burns out quickly you got a light bulb that's really bright it burns out quickly but you got something that's just got a you know just you know you take a 100 watt versus a 30 watt or a 40 watt you put that 40 watt on it's just a nice soft light and that'll go for a, hours you put that 100 watt on it'll burn out in 600 cuz it's just got too much going but that constant glow was what he was talking talking about but even as we're talking about this this ceiling and we're speaking on the Capstone tonight the the danger of this is that we think that this Capstone is the ceiling of this entire thing and it's not remember and we're going to we're going to be covering what the Holy Ghost is because brother Brown would say it's a comforter it's a it's a seal it's it's an approval it's all of these different things but he'd say it's a sealing of your soul because this is the Paradox of the Christian walk is that you can be sealed in the Soul by the Holy Spirit and still be fighting things all day long in your flesh and that's the the the the the difficult thing for us to grasp sometimes say how can I have the Holy Ghost and still be dealing with issues remember Paul said you know before he talked about there were there were fightings without and fears within there's always going to be things that we're we're we're going on and and things that are we're dealing with in our life but our flesh is not sealed our soul is sealed our flesh needs to be redeemed our soul doesn't get changed when we go into Rapture and Resurrection but our body does this body is the thing that needs redeeming that's why we need a glorified one and that's why we're fighting until the day of our Redemption is because this ain't Sanctified this ain't saved this ain't sealed this isn't cleaned out this is where the battle is day in and day out remember Paul would say grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption so something gets sealed but there's got to be a redeeming yet the soul is eternal it does not die that's already been sealed but your body needs to be redeemed to bring you back to your original Place amen so we need a new body to be fully redeemed we need a new body to be the true manifested Sons and Daughters of God so Paul says this is only going to keep you till that time your soul is sealed if I die as soon as I get the Holy Ghost I go straight into the straight into Paradise I go straight to a better place because the soul is what's moving and the body has nothing to do with it amen Paul all saying what there's still a battle to be fought just because you're sealed doesn't mean you're perfect but what it does mean is that the intentions of your heart are right it means that on the inside of the inside you want what God wants you put his word in preeminence in your life and you'll filter your life and you'll live your life through the word but there's still a Redemption that's coming for this body and so in the meantime you're going to have a battle as long as you get the Holy Ghost remember brother Bram I read that quote where he said get the Holy Ghost once and you'll see that it's always a battle you fight from that day on that's the greatest battle because now there's a there's somebody at the controls at all times remember until your soul is sealed then Satan can come in there and God can come in there it's the control tower until you truly are receive a new birth then anybody can any Spirit can control you but as soon as your soul is sealed by the Holy Spirit nothing can get in there nothing can get in there but there's a battle now for the rest of you that isn't Sanctified that isn't sealed and that's the body Paul would say this he said but I keep under my body this is one of those ones that Brother David was talking you can flip the words and it means the correct thing really what he's saying I keep my body under and we'll explain what that means he says and I bring it unto subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway in the Amplified says but like a wrestler I submit and hold down my body I handle it roughly I discipline it by hardships in other words I pin it I keep it on underneath me I make it immovable I take its power from it he says and I subdue it for fear that after proclaiming to others the gospel and things pertaining to it I myself should become unfit I would not stand the test I would be unapproved and rejected as a counterfeit now I know most of us don't don't watch wrestling I know some of our brothers have done this before but in wrestling the goal is to get on top of your opponent because the one on top is the one that generally controls the match and and back in those days that's what they did they did a lot of wrestling and so Paul says I take this flesh and I get it down on the ground and I subdue it I pin it I wrap my arms around it I pin its arms to its side I take away its power every single day Paul said I Die daily I'm working every day to kill this stinking flesh he says and I've got to do this every single day until the day of my Redemption so don't let Satan go in there and and somehow say no other believer or no believer would deal with what you're dealing with no believer would have this problem in their life listen the reason it's a problem for us is because there is someone on the inside that will refuse to allow it to have preeminence in our life the world doesn't have battles the way we have battles cuz they're okay with everything that their flesh is but we're not because we've got something we've got someone on the inside that says you can't do that with this Temple and so we've got a battle and so we battle where others do not because we've got something on the inside that's contrary to what's in our flesh and we've got things in our genetics we've got things in our emotions we've got things in in in our past and our memories and these different things and they can cause us issues but that doesn't mean we don't have the Holy Ghost what it means is that the Holy Ghost will stand up and fight in our life to bring us subject to the word and to bring those things subject to God Amen they he won't allow them to have preeminence he won't allow them to have power over us and so there's a battle every single day because the soul the nature of our of our heart is seeking after God and this flesh is seeking after itself simple fact is this sometimes the soul wins and sometimes the flesh wins listen I'm a minister I'm your pastor and sometimes my flesh wins there are days where it seems like the flesh won but I will say this the flesh wins less and less and it wins in areas it doesn't win in areas it used used to winning why cuz we're growing we're maturing I don't mind so much if I lose the battle once it's if I keep losing it if I keep losing it you know what that means there's a Tormentor in my life and I got to pray that thing out and I've got to get honest before God I've got to get humble before God and I've got to say God this is something that I can't defeat and then brother Bram says you go with prayer and you hold that token before you and you say you've got to leave and if you truly want it gone it'll go but he says as long as you want it it can stay because you're opening the door your mouth might say I don't want it but in here it's saying I want it and so you keep falling and you keep falling I've dealt with these things don't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about and here's the thing as I've learned what happens is I have discernment for my own weaknesses and so I can see where something can go and what do I do then I back away I put myself in a position where that thing can't do what it wants to do right we don't have a conversation we flee we flee we use our feet for discernment remember Jesus the scripture says you know if your eye affect you pluck it out if something's causing you problems get rid of it don't leave it in your house don't leave it on your phone don't leave it in your person no get rid of it and you can use that discernment because if you sit back and say I fell again why did I fall what you'll see is there's a pattern behind it usually that's leading you up to that point time and time again you know for young men it may be sensuality and lust and these different things for young women it could be all sorts of things but you'll see a pattern there and what you've got to understand is when you see that pattern you back away before it goes too far and that's Holy Ghost discernment that's doing that because in here doesn't want it but your flesh is craving it there's plenty of Believers dealing with addictions plenty of Believers dealing with things they can't lay down your phone can be the greatest addiction for a Believer today and you got to know that you can lay it down and if you can't lay it down there's a problem in there something to be dealt with listen brother brandham had a cross in his car hanging from the rearview mirror the prophet of God the seventh Church age messenger had a cross hanging from his window from his rearview mirror you know why he says I looked it up just before service remember he was blind for that little bit from from the the accident he had with the gun and he told God he said God if you give me back my s I'll never look at something again that I ought not to look at and he said I was driving down the road with my wife in the car in this certain town he says and I kept having to look one way to the other to keep to stop from seeing the women that were dressed inappropriately you can't go anywhere today you can't even avoid it it's everywhere but brother bradam would say what red-blooded American man he says it draws your eyes he says but you make a choice as to what you do what you look at the prophet of God had a cross there to remind him of the price that Christ paid to help him to turn his head if he needs it I need it amen if he needs it you need it for whatever it is in our lives amen there's got to be something there that says I don't want that and let me tell you when you've been free from it a while you'll you'll start to understand what it means to be free in Christ you'll say I can't believe I waited this long this is so much better than the than the the perverted or or or the the this the the fleshly gratification we got from those things when your life is clean it's a wonderful thing and you're closer to God and Satan can't use your your your your mind against you he can't use your memories he can't use your faults against you in that way again it's not about perfection but it's the things that we tend to raise up in our lives as big deals it's all the same to God it's all sin listen I tell a lie and you look at pornography it's the same in God's eyes Sin Sin it it doesn't matter to him but we we put these levels on it and sometimes that's what Satan uses against us but listen to this as I was studying through this brother Bram said this he's speaking to the ministers and really this could go for anyone but especially for ministers so I guess I'm preaching to myself he says and there are three things that I notied in the Bible that always trip up a minister he says and one of them was money the other was popularity in women so I know that Saul fell because of popularity balum because of money and Samson because of women so then I know those three things are a hindrance that we must always keep covered up he says and money of course would be the greatest but catch what he throws in at the end here doesn't throw it in he says or trying to think you're just a little bit better than somebody else I think we can all fit in that one but it can fit in with Ministries as well that burns cuz sometimes we can get a little cocky about how good we are and I'll say that as a minister and I'll say that as about a a spouse or this our jobs whatever we can get cocky and we can start thinking this is about me cuz I'm so good and we look down on that brother we look down on that sister that's just trying to do a work for the Lord and we say really how can anybody listen to him does she really think she's helping and why do we look down because we've elevated ourself in our sight and we're comparing them to us and we think I'm good we're all a sinner saved by grace' there is nothing good in this flesh nothing whatsoever but brother Bram says that one of these signs that you're getting tripped up he says you think you're better than somebody else God help us God help me God help me if we ever think that we're anything special amen we get critical we get cynical of these things we're going to dwell on this a little bit later in this series I think but let me say this when we start thinking too much of ourselves get ready for a fall remember the scripture says Pride goes before destruction and a body spirit before a fall an arrogant spirit is never ever ever ever of the Holy Spirit I I I've told this story before brother brandom and I I couldn't find it I just thought about it when I was in the in the room back there getting ready but he's preaching in a service and he's talking about a certain Minister that had got up and he had he had confused a brother and and he kind of shamed him publicly on his Doctrine and it was the same doctrine that brother Brandon preached and brother Bram said something along the lines don't quote me here but I'm just generalizing he said if I was there or if he was here today I'd rip him apart with the Bible and that's the kind of the way he phrased it and I remember the first time I heard that it's the only time I've heard it actually and I was in the car I was in my little 94 Volkswagen Golf and and I was listening to that and literally the Holy Spirit I was listening to that tape and it was wonderful the Holy Spirit I felt it leave in the car where I was listening I felt it Go and it was like a chill just went over and I was like and and and I knew he shouldn't have said that and about 15 seconds later brother Braham says what happened what did I say he says oh I did some I said something and he said I said something I shouldn't he says forgive me he says he left he didn't like that because brother Bram had done what he'd elevated himself brother Bram was a sixth grade educated hillbilly he wasn't where he was because of anything in himself he was where he was because God chose and ordained him a prophet and everything he knew by Revelation was from God and he's saying I would tear that Man Apart God didn't like it cuz what it was arrogance not humility brother brah was saying I'd destroy that man the purpose of a prophet is not to destroy that comes if you don't listen to the prophet and what he' done he'd switched his ministry it wasn't what he was meant to do and he says he's gone he left I did something I said something and he humbled himself and he asked and he apologized and he asked the Forgiveness of the audience that was there shouldn't have said it cuz he elevated himself it's a scary thing but if we can understand God has all sorts of Ministries listen you look at you look at the two sisters that sang this weekend couldn't be any more different in how they sang but anointed can you imagine if we said we only like the way sister Morin sings but we don't like the way sister Priscilla does and sister Amber come on give me a break what does she think no we love what each one has and we love how you sing sister Amber we only get it once a year and I've said that before it's a shame but here's the thing she moves as the spirit moves her and I can respect that I can respect that I love that I'd Rather somebody came up and and it had an effect every time rather than somebody came up all the time and it had no effect amen amen we don't want stuffed shirts up here but can you imagine if we went by preference or perception rather than anointing or by understanding remember brother baham says God's got pennies in his kingdom he's got nickels he's got dimes and he's got silver dollars and you start thinking you're a silver dollar I start thinking I'm a silver dollar and I start looking down on the Nickels they're still in the kingdom of God they still have the Holy Ghost they still have a purpose look at what what what Paul said in Romans he said who art thou that judgest another man's servant to his own Master he standeth or fth in other words he's his boss determines if he's doing well or he's not if he stays in that position or he he gets demoted or he gets promoted he says yay he hold he shall be Holden up for God is able to make him stand listen the remember the scripture says that the this this this work is in Earth and vessels that the Excellency would be of God and not of us I'm an earth and vessel you're an earth and vessel there's nothing here that's strong and sturdy unless God's inside of us amen working through US amen we take tend to make things relative it's the human thing we like to rank right we like statistics we like to compare so we compare preachers we compare singers We compare workers We compare how people look and how they dress and better and worse and all these different things and and so we can take a you know a prince among preachers and we'll put them up here and then we'll put the guy down here that can barely string it together and he's got to read most of his sermon and do all of these things and we say well this one's worse and this one's better but that's not the way God works because remember when when you look at the parable of the talents he said what did you do with what I gave you he didn't say who got the most he says what did you do with what I gave you to one he gave five and he got another five to one he gave two he got another two to one he gave one and he did nothing with it and he was judged because he did nothing with it not because he didn't do a lot with it see we look at who's the best preacher Christ looks at what did you do with the preaching gift I gave you we look at if we look at at a a a at the appearance of it the measure of it and God looks at the effect of it listen if God makes you able to lift 100 pounds and you're walking around lifting 50 in the kingdom of God God's not happy but if you're made to build to lift 100 pound and you walk around lifting 100 pound in the Kingdom God's happy may maybe some of us are you know maybe we're just spiritual weaklings and so God says all I need you to do is carry a backpack in the kingdom of God as long as we carry the backpack he's happy with us he's made us for that remember God brother brah said God will train a man all his life for 15 minutes of work John had a six-month Ministry and then he's cast into prison six months Jesus was three and a half some of the Apostles look at Steven stepen Steven was killed within months of receiving the Holy Ghost but effective while he was there and about the father's business and those things but each and every one of us are human and so we look at that and what happens is we may have a lot of times what happens we've got a maybe a period of Victory or things are going really well and then we look at somebody that's struggling and we start to put them down we start to say why can't they snap out of it why can't they do this oh they just need to do more of this and do more of that as if we've never been there right come on now as if we've never been there chances are if we were really honest just about every any trial that any one one of us has had another one of us has had and some of us handled it better than others and we need to realize those things but each and every one of us has got a got an area to cover up and that weakness is not a sign of unbelief it's not a not a sign that we don't have the Holy Ghost but it's a sign that we've got a battle on our hands remember brother brother brandwood say that quote he says you know God doesn't just put you in a pipe and push you through out the other end and then you get to say you got a victory you got to fight you got to battle and that's often through the weaknesses that are in our flesh the weaknesses that come genetically whatever we want to we we've got and we've got to be able to go to God and say it is what it is I've got it I've got a fight on my hands I've got a battle on my hands I've got a struggle on my hands and we got to go to him and say I need your help because if we sit here and we say I've got the Holy Ghost therefore I have no problems that's not going to work and Satan will have a field day with us if we sit there trying to cover up what God's trying to take out of our Lives we don't get a better of flower ease we've all got to fight we've all got to battle in these things listen to this brother B said I was just talking to a young Minister and his wife in the room just a few moments ago and both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world the rest of the human beings on Earth and I said remember Satan's got a Punch coming at you don't care who you are he's got a WR for that one punch now which would you rather that punch be be blind be an arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous see he's got somewhere he can punch you he's got to right to that open place he says now that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time you got to keep it covered covered up with what prayer cuz remember Paul went to God and he has that weakness I liked how Brother David said I didn't I didn't understand I'd never understood it that way where he said that that when Paul was healed of the blindness that was struck on him when he got knocked off his horse he says God didn't heal it completely He restored his sight but he didn't restore it all the way and he says that was the weakness in Paul's in Paul's flesh that's what he said that sounded good to me I can't it's not thus sayith the Lord anything but it would make sense he said he gave it to he gave he mostly healed him but he didn't heal him all the way and then Paul says I went to God three times and said Lord take it away and what did God come back and say he said Paul my strength is made perfect in your weakness Paul you're a bigger testimony with this weakness than you would be if you never have it in the first place and sometimes that's the big picture we've got to see is that God's giving us a testimony that others can't hope to have with the exact same condition or issue in their life he says that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time I'm talking about humility really for this and we're talking about the Capstone of Charity but I'm setting a basis this this this evening for where we're going in the next few services with that and that's one thing is when you get to the Capstone you realize this is not about you in the sense of it can't be about who I am and how I look and what people think about me and how I appear and what no no no when you come to this point you should have been broken down so that God's ready to really start using you when we come to this this is the the complete sanctification this is the complete cleaning out and it's the preparing for God to dwell in and God will share his glory with no man and so when you come to this if you don't have that humility then God won't give you the Holy Ghost I'm not saying you'll never have moments of arrogance or these different things again we're fighting the stink in flesh but if you come up to this and you're sitting there say well I just just deserve this now look what I've done look who I am passed every test with flying colors look at that poor guy over there that's not the way God's doing it God's looking for humility amen so when we come to this it's Christ Living in you and that means you have to have died out you've got to come to a place of full surrender you've got to come to a place where you've just let go and you've let God have his way and then the Holy Ghost this Capstone this ch it this love of God is what a sign or a token that God has accepted your sacrifice that he's accepted what you've laid on the altar that you've you've set yourself aside and that you're willing to let him truly have full control because that's the only way it's going to work amen like I said before that that that arrogant Spirit has no place and God will beat it out of us before he'll give us the Holy Ghost we can't be arrogant and expect him to come and dwell there Peter had to be completely humbled Peter got embarrassed remember the night of Jesus you know when he was going before the priesthood and whatnot and Peter saidou know Lord I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you and he says before the the the the rooster crows tonight three times you'll you'll uh before he crows you'll you'll deny me three times and he did and then Peter went out and he went fishing naked and he cursed Peter had to be humbled before he got the Holy Ghost but once he got it Peter was a changed man and he was confident without the arrogance Paul had to be humbled Paul had to be knocked off of his high horse and then he had to go out on the desert and God had to work with him and beat out of him all of that pheral attitude that he had brother Bram call him a high-tempered hook-nosed Jew he had to bring him to a place where he could surrender and truly let God flow through him rather than come in with now I've got now I've got the Holy Ghost and if we can just take that and take all the knowledge that I've I've got in my life and everything I've studied now we can really do good things God no no no he had to take him on the back back side of the Desert what' god do with Moses took him to the back side of the desert 40 years putting it in and 40 years beating it out and he went back in the power of God because he knew who he met and God had taken it away from him amen God will take you to the place listen if you're arrogant God can't use you yet but he'll get you to the place where he can use you that's it it's just that simple just cuz he just CU you're there now doesn't mean he can't use you but he'll use you when you've got that when he's he's got that all all the way out and you release to him brother BR says this we're starting to close he says I've always found that the man that humbles himself is the man that God exalts he said always found in other words he's never found an exception humility is power with god brother Brown would say elsewhere he says when you take a person with his chest out and knows everything you can't tell him nothing he's arrogant well that's the person that never gets anywhere but you take that person that humbles themselves and walks sweetly he says now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seen different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter and at and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you that's one thing listen to this don't let malice come Ino now arrogant that's one thing but malice that's different that's a real battle some of us are naturally humble some of you are naturally humble amen but when it comes to malice holding things against somebody there are very few people have that naturally because we get hurt that's when the spikes come out amen that's when the swords come out he says no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person God help us God help you I'm dealing with the arrogance you guys deal with the mice no God help us all see you be sweet and kind remember God loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of God is in you you love that other person when he's in wrong see just pray for them and love one another watch now as we start to close he says a chain is strongest at its weakest link that's right he says it's no stronger than its weakest link he says no matter how strong and he starts pointing to this and I I I added it to the slide these these Seven Virtues he says no matter how strong these are built up or this is built up if it's got a weak link that's where she breaks he says now if you possess you say you got this this and this and you don't have this that's where she breaks so you say you got faith virtue knowledge but you don't have Temperance he say says that's where your Christian walk breaks it's as far as you can go you can say you've got patience godliness and brotherly kindness but if Temperance is no good then the chain breaks there and you'll never get really the opportunity to do the other the others above it he says if you got this and haven't got that shall break right there he says you can't have this without having this right so you can't just have you can't pick and choose you got to have each and every one of them in order for this whole thing to work but don't use it as an excuse if you don't got it that's the thing a family I won't say who it was but a family member said you know a minister one time said something and in just in private fellowship and they said you shouldn't say that he said well if you know what was in my head and what I really could have said you wouldn't say that and they said we all have those thoughts we all have things we think sometimes and maybe we're cutting remarks or sarcastic or these different things just cuz you think it doesn't mean you can just dilute it by 90% And still put it out some you have to hold you have to be able to hold and that was a lesson that brother had to learn was because he thought well because I'm not saying everything I want to say then it's somehow okay no sometimes we got to learn to just keep our mouth shut period right holding it's like you know punch somebody as hard as you can or punch them you know a third of what you can it's still a punch that doesn't make it right just because you didn't hit them as hard as you can you're not supposed to hit him in the first place amen it's the same thing I read in in my devotions the other morning we answer for every Idol word we say and it can be critical it can be joking it can be all these things but we answer for those things and this brother had a you know he's very very very quick to think in these things and he he was kind of spouting off but they said you can't do that you're a minister especially because you're a minister you can't say those types of things because it'll dampen your influence with the people and it'll cause a break in your testimony like that it was a weak point and he had to he had to go to God and he had to get that covered up and get that taken out of him he says so when you surrender your complete being when not if when when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you're a living Tabernacle he says then people look out and say you say brother John you've been preaching we've got to have all these attributes you do but he says once you get the Holy Spirit flowing through them then people look out and say that's a man full of virtue knowledge he believes the word Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness full of the love of the Holy Ghost see there he is walking around what is it it's a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian there is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about he said you've never seen a person that knows what's under the Seven Seals like they do is that is that what he said he said you've never seen a Kinder sweeter godlier person because remember it's not knowledge knowledge is a part of it it's not Doctrine doctrine's a part of it it's not dos and don'ts but it's a part of it it's not just the clothes you wear but it's a part of it but it's a Kinder sweeter godlier person we'll close with this he says you're sealed a seal shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you see the seal just the same let me put it this way coming into the situation people see you're a Christian and going out of the situation they see you're still a Christian coming in or going out doesn't matter which way you're going people know you're a Christian by the way you act he says there you are see when a woman man or woman possess this then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost amen God bless you let's stand this evening if we would I thought I was going to be a lot shorter amen but that's okay amen like I said there's a lot to this it's pretty chunky and so we're going to just take some of these as we go through but I wanted to set this this this tone here humility sweetness kindness they know how to act they know how to respond these things because without that we're going to just be playing games if we don't know how to act then how in the world are we ever going to say that we're we're ready for God to come in and dwell if we can't do the basics how can we do the Greater Works because remember the Greater Works is is not just the signs and wonders it's being able to turn the other cheek it's being able to pray for the ones that despitefully use you it's to not rail back when they rail against you it's to Bear the burden of the one that can't bear it these are the things that define the acts of a Christian the rest is the works of the Holy Spirit but there's got to be an act in our life there's got to be a life inside of us that makes us walk the way he walks first and foremost and then what happens is he comes in and he lives in there we'll read the quote where brother brah gets into it he says then your faith becomes his faith your knowledge becomes his knowledge your Temperance becomes his Temperance your patience becomes his patience and now what he's doing is he's taking you to a whole new level and he's placing you in the body of Christ and that's where in you're in Heavenly places in Christ is you recognize your position you recognize what you're supposed to do and you recognize that he's given you all power and authority to do what he's asked you to do it's a wonderful place but like anything he's building us up into these things amen amen let's just pray together Heavenly Father Lord all I can say is make us more like you Lord how I fall short Lord and I know I'm not the only one many times but Lord our hearts cry has make me more like you Lord to just help us to lay ourselves aside Lord Lord that we'd have that sacrificial nature of the Lamb Lord that be we be wise as serpents and harmless as doves Lord that our inent would be for the sake of the Soul that's in front of us each and every day Lord knowing that our our soul is sealed Lord may we look to get other sealed Lord no matter what it costs us we pray Lord we want to be Lord Fit for Your Kingdom Lord we want to be fit for your presence in our life and Lord we thankful you've given us the Holy Spirit Lord there's some here don't have it but

Lord and when it's all said and done Lord may you say Well done thou good and faithful servant enter into the joys of thy Lord Lord we ask these things Lord remembering the many sick ones especially brother Paul Lord struggling Lord with his throat Lord we pray a Special Touch for him and for that household Lord Lord just seems like Satan is hammering them Lord but we rebuke him in Your Name Lord and ask your Holy Spirit to go even to that home and restore health and strengthen each and everyone we pray Lord each one that's here Lord you see the the stresses the trials Lord that are going on Lord you see where we get weary Lord lift up feeble hands and strengthen feeble knees we pray Lord help us to just hold each other up Lord in bonds of Love Lord and in prayer Lord before your throne of mercy and Grace Lord may we know that we can reach out at any time Lord to each other Lord for the help that we need Lord bless your people we ask in Jesus name we ask it amen let's sing that song
