to you Lord forgive us Lord forgive us and help us Lord to seek Lord to do better each day Lord fill us Anew with your spirit we ask Lord turn us not away we pray Lord but accept us Lord and draw us closer to you we ask in Jesus Christ's name we're praying it amen and amen God bless you thank you musicians I'm in good to be back and still a small group we've got sister Delfina back praise the Lord we've got brother Paul back praise the Lord and then we've lost the couples anyways trusting his brother Dale prayed that God will touch each one and bring him back to us amen good to have brother Joe back safely and I said I guess we'll see you there tonight and he said yes and then he said no we're leaving late so it kind of closed the window on that but I said we missed him playing the bass so much that we canceled two Services while he was gone I meant so anyways uh very tired this evening Samuel's been keeping us up a lot at night so just covet your prayers it's even worse for Blanca because she's the one that has to get up with him but he's been waking me up as well so just praying the Lord would help him he's just not back to his normal self from being sick amen also we have sister Rochelle's family will be traveling I guess next week sometime so we want to remember them in prayer it travels getting better it seems but it's also the winter season so we want to remember them as they travel that God would keep them safe and give them an enjoyable time as they come over to the wonderful land that is Newfoundland amen amen let's go in our scriptures if we would to Deuteronomy 15 I do have to apologize apparently I've been clipping my my uh scriptures occasionally and I'm putting when I copy them in sometimes I miss a number so I think last time it was Deuteronomy 5 instead of 15 at some points as I was looking through my notes so if I've clipped that forgive me it's not intentional but sometimes I just mix stuff up when I copy and paste but hopefully I've got it right here tonight amen Deuteronomy 15 verse 12 this is where we read last week last service it says and if thy brother and Hebrew man or in Hebrew woman be sold unto thee and serve thee six years than in the seventh year Thou shalt let him go free from thee and when thou sendest him out free from thee Thou shalt not let him go away empty Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy winepress of that where with the Lord thy God hath blessed thee Thou shalt give unto him and thou shalt remember that thou was the bondman in the land of Egypt and the Lord thy God redeemed thee therefore I command thee this thing today and it shall be if he say unto thee I will not go away from thee because he loveth thee and thine house because he is well with thee then Thou shalt taken all and thrusted through his ear into the door and he shall be unto thy servant forever and also unto thy maidservant shalt thou do likewise amen God bless his word you may be seated this evening I want to pick up right where we left off and we're going to continue and we're going to take the second part of the Year Jubilee I think there'll be one more after this Lord willing but we start with such a strange scripture and we kind of close with that in the last service and we talked about why a slave would stick around in a situation like that you know you would think that the the Natural Instinct for somebody that's put into bondage that somebody's a debt slave that's somebody that's committed crime or whatever it might be that put them in the prison that put them into slavery what is it that would keep them there and we talked about how they would get bound uh potentially to a a a non-hebrew uh a gentile slave and they'd marry them to that person with the hopes that when the time came that they could go free that they'd stick around but brother Branham approaches it from a much different situation that was a historical uh way of looking at it perhaps but brother Branham approaches this from a much different uh angle when he starts talking about this this boring of the ear and whatnot and so I want to spend an entire service on this if you can believe it but about why you would turn down the Year of Jubilee what it is that holds us back because the prophet of God didn't preach it as something that was from two or three or four thousand years ago he preached it as it was happening today amen and he's preaching it not to uh Sinners but he's preaching it to professing Christians and so when we start talking about the boring of the ear that is meant for the believer to hear and take heed to and make sure that that's not what's happening in their life because the prophet of God would say that's what's happening in denominations is they put a period behind what God Said and they couldn't go any further and so God put a put a hole through their ear and they can't hear the gospel trumpet anymore but there's so much more that's going on in this and there's one major refusal that we see in scriptures and I want to take that refusal because it's the one way that we can apply this because we don't have a an idea of what it means to be in slavery today you know we have what happened in certainly in the United States in particular back in the 16 1700s and whatnot and how they put people into slavery and and they had an idea of what that looked like but today we don't have an idea of what it means to be a slave we can say well I'm a slave to the job I'm a slave to the man I'm a slave to the government but it it's not slavery like they used to have where you you didn't have a whole lot of clothes and you just had bear shelter and and and just bear sustenance and those things so we don't really know what it means to be in slavery today because even when you fail the government's there to bail you out to make sure that you have enough to to sustain yourself generally speaking amen but I want to talk about what it means to to stay in the Master's house rather than to go out into freedom and go back to your own thing and we talked about that one thing was when the person said I'm satisfied with where I'm at I'm satisfied to be a slave I'm satisfied to just have my food given to me my clothing given to me when it wears out and a roof over my head and that bare sustenance was enough for them and it was more than enough for them to stay with that Master rather than to go out and buy a life of Faith a life of work for themselves have to bear the burden of their own success or failure on their shoulders they said I'd rather be enslaved to somebody that would guarantee that I'll I'll live my days out and I'll be productive rather than go out on my own and I want to stop there because we get into a place sometimes in our lives where we say this isn't so bad and you can get there as a Believer we're not talking about this isn't so bad in in my life and whatnot but we can get to the place where we say I've dealt with things in my life for so long and it's not so bad anymore because if you remember to the first days of slavery no doubt things were difficult somebody that was free that was bound they had a very strong memory of what it was like to be free didn't they the first day as a slave I can't imagine you know in those days you'd you'd go to bed you know free and you'd wake up a slave somebody would come into your your tribe or come into your city or your town or or come into your house and they'd steal you in the night they'd they'd grab you and they bind you and they take you away and sell you and you had no no choice about it and one day you were you were free and the next day you were enslaved and that first day after they were in slavery I'll bet you they remembered a whole lot what it meant to be free and what it meant to have family what it meant to be able to go and do what you wanted and not be hit and not be abused and and all these different things but as time went on for so many no doubt they forgot what it was like to be truly free and they started to accept their condition and forget what it was that they had waiting back home what it was that they used to enjoy in the presence of the Lord if I could put it that way and we can get to the place where we're deadened to what it used to be not because it was so much better back then but because we haven't been where we used to be in so long where we get accepting of what a cold and formal religion because that's what it turns into brother Brown that was the biggest warning I think he had is he said don't go into formalism and then don't let it become just something you do every Sunday or let it become something you do every Wednesday or just because you wake up in the morning have devotions don't let it become formal but it needs to be life amen it needs to have an impact it's supposed to be doing something inside of us and so we can get to the place where we say this coldness is sung even though I'm doing things that are good or maybe even I'm doing things that God has asked me to do yet nothing's happening in my life and I'm okay with it because I meet the requirements that he has for me amen that's not where we want to be amen that's not where we want to be or we get to the place where we have addictions we have habits we have friendships we have influences in our life and they've been there so long that we don't know what it's like to be without them it's kind of like I think the the retirees you know talking to them and when they're done working they almost don't know what to do with themselves when they're done working after all the first few days are woohoo right they sleep in they go to bed as late as they want they wake up as late as they want they do whatever they want they eat whatever they want as long as the wife's not home it's a wonderful time but after a while I'm told you start to wonder what do I do with things and you can get drawn into what a life that is not particularly fulfilling because you don't know what you're supposed to be doing there's no fulfillment in it and you're just living life and this is what we're talking about as you're just living life you're in a condition you're not growing and brother Brown says if you're not growing then you're going backwards right if you're not moving forward then you're backsliding but that backsliding can be so slow I like what brother Aaron said he says sometimes it we're not doing poorly because we're backsliding but because we've lost the fire because we've lost the Zeal and then we've lost the fervency of our relationship with God and so we sit there and we get used to what that formalness we we get used to just doing the same thing over and over again and seeing no results and we can sit there and we can end up literally a slave to the very religion that we profess to be a message from the from God that's what we see so many times talking with young people and old alike they can get to the place where it's just something you do by rote rather than by desire it's almost like when you walk out the door and you give your wife a kiss you do it because she's your wife and that's what you do when you go out the door rather than because you love her right you can get into the place where what you've gotten your relationship cold because there's no passion in it there's nothing inside of it and this is this is something we're going to go into a little bit is that coldness that formality that can come into it but it's also you get to the place where you can say well I used to do it so much worse I used to be addicted I used to have this problem I used to be with these people but now I only do it once a week it used to be every day I used to only be on Facebook I used to be on it every day but now I only go on once a week but that's just negotiated slavery once again it's kind of like people and you'll hear them in the world they say I only drink on weekends but they drink every weekend they're still in slavery it's just that they're not alcoholics every day they're just alcoholics on the weekend but they're still alcoholics and we can get to that point where we say it's not as bad as it used to be but it's still there and we haven't overcome and what we are is we are in prison amen and then we get to the point where we're so used to it that we don't want we don't need we're not looking for a change we're not expecting a change we're happy with the way things are and we say I'm happy to stay in the slavery for as long as it wants to to stay in my life amen we're a slave and we're fine with being it now when I was studying this I looked up this thing called Stockholm syndrome if you've ever heard of it so Stockholm syndrome is a coping mechanism for a captive someone in a captive or abusive situation where people develop positive of feelings towards their captors or abusers over time it applies to situations including child abuse coach and athlete abuse relationship abuse and even sex trafficking and when I put up the definition it says it is a psychological response wherein a captive begins to identify closely with his or her captors as well as their agenda and demands and when I was studying on this they they were talking about uh robbers and terrorists that would take people as hostages but the first thing that jumped out here is this idea of what identifying closely with an agenda because the world is full of agendas today it doesn't matter what you're talking about if you're talking about marriage and relationships there's agendas if you're talking about your kids and how to raise them there's agendas out there if you're talking about politics it is agendas from start to finish employment what a business is supposed to represent everything is full of agendas agendas agendas and if you're feeding on that pretty soon you start to identify with the causes that they have forgetting that it's all of Satan this is Satan's kingdom and they're trying to get a Believer involved to try and fix Satan's kingdom guess what it's his and it's never going to be fixed you can't fix the country you can't fix the family unit you can't fix the world you can't fix Humanity it's lost and when he gets you to identify with an agenda then what is he doing he's getting you off the Kingdom Agenda the real agenda and you're burning all of your energy up and you can become a slave you can start to identify with things because you say it's not fair listen if we wanted to focus on not fair look at our sisters men can go and remarry ad nauseum if they want not really according to scripture but that's the way it's worked out because a man is allowed to remarry after divorce and the sister has to sit there and she has can't remarry until that man dies that first husband dies how fair is that it's not fair but it's right and since people will get us caught up in the fairness of it and is that really the way it should be and if you stop and think about it and all of a sudden it's just like Eve they've got you identifying with their agenda rather than running it through the filter of the word of God and so you end up being caught between two opinions and we'll touch on that a little bit amen the idea is not to get caught up the idea is to get into Christ and as we said get into that strong tower to be so buried in there that they've got to come through the word to get you and they can never get through because their agenda won't fit through it amen but I was looking at this and they said that these these people these terrorists are or these children that are taken and and whatnot that they get to the point where what happens is their life or their safety is threatened by the person that takes them and then the person lets them keep their life in their safety and it triggers a response that makes them think that their Master their captor that terrorist whoever might be is their friend because they threatened to take their life and then they gave it back to them and so they start to think this person actually cares about me and they start to think that there's actually a beneficial relationship that that person is going to do everything they said they were going to do and that their promises will not be turned away in the end and they get caught up in this and they actually have a an example in Sweden where the woman said I trust this Bank robber's motives and objectives and I'm scared that if the police come in they'll kill me she didn't want to rescue she didn't want them to try anything she believed that a man that was that that was putting her life and her body and using it as a shield for himself had her in mind her goodness and her life and mind over his own rather than the police whose duty is to protect and serve that's how twisted she got up in just a few short hours she got bound up by this now take somebody that's around somebody like they have this the these child trafficking and whatnot where they're around them for years and all of a sudden they start to rely on that person and they start to look at that person to provide their needs to give them validation they get them hooked on drugs all these different things they're looking at that person and they get into a delusion that that person has their motor their best motives and objectives in their heart and they don't they're in it for themselves that's what we see with agendas and these different things is there's people that are in it for what themselves everything you look I remember when the the black lives movement came out in and and everything was sweeping towards and everybody joined in and then all of a sudden everything went blank because the founders had taken the money and run with it right they had a moral cause potentially but all they did was they got all of this influence and they took it they turned it into money and then they went and ran and bought houses and now nobody knows what's going on they've got no money left in the foundation they've just got a shadow board to try and keep things running right because why it wasn't pulled through the word of God and so it was a man it was of women in this case and they went through and they absolutely destroyed that foundation and everything that they were working through we start to forget that what they took us from our freedom in the first place but we still think that it's okay to stay there that it's going to be okay that we don't need anything to change in our life and in the end they fear and resent anybody that would try and take them out of that condition that's an amazing place you think that a child abuse sexually abused by a man that stole her away and brought her over the Border would somehow not do anything but hate that man and yet they get to the point where they don't want to leave that man they don't want to be freed they want to stay with them that's their daddy and they trust him even though he's abusing them and giving them away to other men every single day of their life they comply with their captor rather than even help the police in those situations it's amazing you say brother that's insane amen you say that's insane but yet what happens when what we touch one another sore spots places where we're not doing so well places where we need Deliverance places where we need to grow places where we need to come up a little higher and what do we do we pull back and we say why'd you do that I'm okay I don't have a problem I don't need to go up for prayer the minister touches on the pulpit from behind the pulpit and all of a sudden we say well he's out to get me now and what's he doing he's blowing a trumpet he's blowing a trumpet if he's a Holy Ghost Field Ministry he's blowing a trumpet and saying you got to come out of that you got to come up higher you got to realize that there's more Beyond this that there is a Deliverance I said it before and I like my own statement it was that we're covering up too many things with forgiveness instead of Deliverance amen that we're in a cycle and we're going around and around the mountain we're going around and around the desert and we're coming close to the promise of God and then we turn away at the last minute close to the presence of God and turn away why because we like right where we're at and we don't think it's a problem we don't think we're Bound by something amen you don't even think you're in bonded you don't think you're in change you don't think you've got a problem because it's been there so long that you don't know what it's like to be without it then you think about it somebody tells you there's more there's a land beyond the Jordan that's what Caleb and Joshua are saying there's more there's grapes the size grape clusters that are so big it takes two men to carry them there's there's land there's water there's cattle there's pastures there's houses already built and you're sitting here saying but I'm happy in the desert I'm just going to go around and around the desert and that's what they did you know they came close to Jordan time and time again but they never crossed over they never crossed over close pulled away close pulled away brother the scripture talks about this in Revelation 3 17 this is the latest in church age okay we're preaching to this church age tonight it says because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked listen church it's not Sinners reading this Bible is it because he says what he says to what the Church of laodicea he says preach it to the Believers John preach it seventh Church age Messenger to the people let them know that this is the condition they're going to be in in this age unless they hear the trumpet he's preaching to professing Believers he's preaching to professing message Christians if I could put it that way and he's saying you think that you have so much and what is he saying don't get comfortable because that first bid Rich increased with Goods have need of nothing that's a comfortable place and it's not just natural wealth it's spiritual wealth they think they have amen what's he saying stay on fire for God don't stop moving it doesn't all have to be a anybody that's been married for more than than a couple of years will know that it's not all fire and passion every day is it maybe it's just mine every day is in fire and passion it is early on but then you settle down and you get into loving instead of just being in love and there's more that comes into it and and this is what it's talking about is don't stay there where you are stay and move on with your relationship with God keep moving because these talks and the next thing about I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that's the character of God and characters developed over time brother Brown says character is what a victory right it's a character of Victory it's something that you overcome in yourself it's not you that overcomes it's Christ that overcomes in you it's the holy spirit that does that amen but you've got to keep your walk going towards God keep your walk with God don't just stand still like I said brother Brown says when you stand still you're backsliding you've always got to be pushing forward amen and brother Bram says these are souls in prison because they think they're where they need to be and they're nowhere near it and they are spiritually bereft they're completely missing the boat when it comes to what God's doing in their life and what he's supposed to be doing amen these people don't think they're just middle-class Christians they think they're the best of the best and yet there's nothing there he said you have nothing your poor wretched miserable blind and naked that's an amazing condition to be in and not know it you've got to be in real trouble you got to be like that slave that wants to stay there to be in that kind of a condition amen you have nothing and you think you have all that you need and because of that you're never looking for anything else I was thinking about today brother Mark you know when you you read that um advertisement in the paper and it said something along the lines of if you're happy where you are stay there but if you're looking for something more that's what struck me even as we're moving forward into a larger Church where we could have more people I almost thought that maybe we should put that out again if you're happy where you're at stay there but if you're looking for something more come to 50 Long Shore Road amen because I'm looking for more I I have an end time message and I'm looking for more not more from it but more in me amen that God would lift me up to a higher level not just as a minister but as a father as a husband as a a member of the church as a member of the community in my job that he would Raise Me Up that I'd not be satisfied with where I'm at be satisfied with where I'm at in that where he's placed me but always to be looking to grow in Christ amen amen we've forgotten what it's like to not have a temper to not have a complex to not be cynical to not be frustrated all the time to not be depressed I remember back in 2006 just before we bought our first house in Texas and we got in a a bad wreck and it it hurt me really badly it it did a number on one of my on one of my um discs in my back and it caused me to have um I couldn't sleep at night insomnia and so I couldn't sleep at all and I'd get maybe one or two hours a night and I'd just lay there and toss and turn and just completely frustrated and I got to the point that I was depressed but you know I didn't know I was depressed because it had been so long since I had slept it had been so long since I had rest it had been so long since I hadn't been frustrated that I thought that being frustrated tired worn out was the way that I had always felt that's a personal testimony of of the dark road we can get down and not realize Where We Are but as soon as I got a diagnosis as soon as I knew what was wrong as soon as I knew that it was going to be okay then all of a sudden I could sleep and all of a sudden I popped out of it and my wife she was trying to tell me you're depressed and I'd say no I'm not no I'm not I'm fine I'm just tired and that's sometimes what we're doing is we're denying it because we can't see it for ourselves sometimes we need a spell sometimes we need a minister to come on and say you're not normal there's something lacking here you've forgotten what it's like to be free you've forgotten the first love that you had you've forgotten the joy that you used to have you've you've lost the rest that you used to enjoy so much and you're frustrated all the time I deal with frustration a lot I'm I'm a performance driven person so I'm usually more frustrated at myself than anything that's one thing I've really got to watch is that if I'm constantly frustrated it means I've lost the joy of my salvation it means I'm looking too much of myself and not looking enough to the cross of Calvary amen I remember I pre-shot service on knowing where to satisfy your thirst you remember where David he's in the middle of the desert and he's been running so long and it's hot and it's dusty and he's sweaty and he said oh for water from The Well of Bethlehem why because he remembered what it was like to be satisfied he remembered what it was like to have his thirst quenched he remembered the taste of it not because he'd heard about it but because he'd experienced it and the danger we get is we've forgotten what it tastes to be free in the Holy Spirit to be free in the presence of God to know what it means to walk through a day and not be bound up in yourself in your complexes and your family situations and all of these different things amen if you've ever been satisfied with the good things of God keep that in your mind because when you start to miss it you can say I remember what it used to be and like David said restore to me the joy of my salvation didn't mean he lost his salvation but restore to me the joy give me back what I had Lord listen God doesn't move away from us God never moves away from us we move away from him and all these all you need to do is say Lord I'm coming back and what is it he's blowing the trumpet constantly saying come back come back to where I am come back to your inheritance come back to the promises of God come back to the presence of God and enjoy the benefits that you're supposed to have as a child as a son and daughter of God what happens why do we refuse a jubilee because we've forgotten who we are and what we're supposed to be living like we've forgotten the goodness of God we've forgotten the blessings of God the promises of God brother Brown talks about it in spiritual Amnesia he says another thing that causes this among the people is getting between two opinions you get caught between two worlds maybe I could put it that way where you're at and where you used to be he says that'll cause Amnesia and it gets you to a place where you actually what you've done you've lost your reason you've lost your mind you don't know who you are you can't identify yourself you can walk around and eat and everything but you still can't identify yourself what is it well how do you get caught between two opinions feed on two sources right if you're feeding on the things of the world on the agendas of the world if you're feeding on things that are from people that don't have the Holy Ghost you're going to get pulled in a direction opposite to what the word of God says every single time even if they profess to be a Christian amen you get there of times by seeking balance and you end up imbalanced we're not looking for a balance between what the word says and what the world says there is no balance there amen right your balance is here Old Testament and New Testament that's where your balance is it is not in commentaries by political people or by religious people it's not on YouTube it's not on Tick Tock it's not on Facebook it's not on Instagram that is never going to balance us but it's going to draw you into two opinions and you're never going to come out of it looking the better for it brother badham would also say and it's not here it was in a previous quote he said sometimes a shock will do it sometimes a shock will do and what happens somebody you really love dies or leaves the message or you have a financial setback in your family somebody's Health goes down the drain a relationship fails and you're seeking for understanding and so you start to go away from the word and start to talk to people that know nothing about the things of God and what happens is it pulls you down a rabbit Trail to which there's no end it's just one thing after another after another and pretty soon you're you're stuck between two opinions you don't know what's right what's wrong who's right who's wrong where to go where to stay and you're stuck in brother Brown calls it spiritual Amnesia it's no man's land you're seeking a worldly answer to a god question right amen listen you want a God answer go to God it's the only place you're going to get it go to the word of God he says now there's a place when you get this Amnesia you might get like Nebuchadnezzar who exalted himself one time remember the scripture says what pry goldth Before Destruction in a haughty spirit before a fall It also says humility goeth before honor so you can invert this you can invert this if you're in a place where you don't know who you are humble yourself and God will take you to what you're supposed to be he says and God let him think he was an animal he lived out in the wilderness and he grasped like an ox and his hairs grow down his body like eagle feathers and he had become the heart of a beast in him see that was Amnesia because he had forgotten he was a king he forgotten he was a human being he thought he was an animal so he acted like an animal because he forgot he was a human being he says that's so easy today we forget sometimes what the Christian church is we act like the world that shows that we've got spiritual Amnesia because you don't act like a Christian you act like the world you receive the heart of the world and it causes this that's why I was focusing earlier on agendas is because that's what's going to give the heart of the world to you you start to align you start to to understand where they're coming from and it draws you into a place where you're not sure what you believe anymore he says when the world and the church joins itself together then they don't want nothing spiritual they don't want thus said the Lord they want what they want they want the world and to say they're a Christian live in the world and live with the world and live like the world and still maintain their confession of being a Christian he says you know the thing of it is it's spiritual Amnesia it's exactly what it is they don't know who they are they've forgotten what they're supposed to do if one would come today like that it would be rejected just the same they had a bad case of it and so have they today he says they could not identify themselves with the supernatural things anymore because they didn't want it the word the gospel they didn't want it see what happens there he says they don't want the supernatural but how do they get to not wanting the supernatural they didn't want the word because the supernatural follows the word it does not lead the word it follows the word right the assigns shall follow them that believe right the word comes first he says they turn down the word and then they turn down the supernatural because they can't see why they need it he says sin disease had Afflicted them and they loved that sin is Pleasant to the unconverted heart it looks good to the unconverted mind but it's the way of death there's nothing left but death the wages of sin is death and you must reap them wages you've sowed to the winds and you're now reaping the Whirlwind the spiritual signs and the preaching of an ordained messenger from God never stirred them anymore the woman could the women could laugh right in their face and say I don't have to go hear such a stuff as that if that hasn't repeated again what is it spiritual Amnesia exactly what it is they have forgotten that God and His word is the same and he cannot change it he says you know the old saying fools will walk with hobnailed shoes Where Angels Fear to trod that's what this spiritual Amnesia does now listen to this it says it makes people get to a spot to well they have no feeling on the inside of them they don't want nothing that's spiritual but the church today has got a bad case of spiritual Amnesia it doesn't know where it belongs it's for God all about it forgot all these things that makes it a church and the Bible prophesied Jesus Christ sent his Angel to John and said this last Church age would have the spiritual Amnesia they were wretched remember they think they're big they think they've got something but he said they were miserable wretched poor blind naked and didn't know it and there is no way of telling them they think just because I belong to a church that's all is necessary oh brother that means no more to God than to be a mason or anything else or any other Lodge if you know the Masonic Lodge it ain't religious and he says you say all I need to do is belong to a church it's no different than saying I need to belong to the Masonic Lodge has nothing to do with God to belong to church that don't mean nothing to God you've got to be Sons and Daughters of God you've got to be born of God and God is the word and when I become part of my father I become all my father when you become part of God you become God in full his whole word you believe all of it amen now it doesn't sound very nice spiritual amnesia doesn't sound like a very good thing to be in but the beautiful thing is they didn't determine the condition of the people before they blew the trumpet did they the trumpet always blew no matter what that's right and guess what the gospel trumpet blows regardless of our condition amen sometimes we were blind we were wretched miserable poor blind naked all of those things and the trumpet's still blue and one day we heard it and we heard it for what it was it wasn't just the sound wasn't just something off in the distance but it was something that meant something to us and we said that means something and we took it and the word says you can go free and what did we do we said I'll take that I'll go free but guess what it's continuing to sound every day we're what we're Washed by the what the water of the word it's a regular thing that trumpet is constantly blowing to keep us free and if we're bound to get us free hey man did you know you can have the Holy Ghost and still be bound absolutely temporarily you let something in it combines you as long as you leave it in there you open the door it can come in you deny it it can't come in but if you open the door it has a right to bind you but when you hear that gospel Trump and you realize I'm not supposed to have this in my life I'm supposed to be living in a higher plane than what that thing has to go because you apply the word to it you release the Holy Spirit to it and now it's got to go but you can absolutely be stuck there amen what do you do if you got this condition what do you do if you know somebody has this condition get them to where the trumpet's blowing that's what you got to do is get to where the trumpet's blowing and brother Brown says every time the trumpet is the gospel the trumpet is the preaching of the word get them to church get to church not get them to church let's get us to church let's get to the hearing of the word everyone's here I'm preaching to the choir I know tonight but get to where the word is and guess what don't wait for brother Gerald to get up don't wait for me to get up you gotta you got 1200 odd messages sitting at home that's the gospel trumpet for this age telling you how you can go free and what your land looks like and what's waiting for you if you'll just leave the master that you're serving today if you're serving a master that's other than Christ amen talk to God before you talk to anyone else talk to God amen look to him like I said you got a god question get a God answer go to him and go through his word amen stop listening to commentaries and podcasts from people that don't have the Holy Ghost listen if they don't have it there's going to be something in there that'll trip you up why because they don't have the full word and we're going to get to a quote where brother Brown talks about he says now that you've got the full word you can go free because it'll only take you so far you listen to a denominational Minister you listen to some nominal Christian trying to tell you the good things of God they'll only take you so far and they'll leave you with more questions and answers in the end you need somebody that's got the full Revelation something that's preaching from an open book an open book that's been revealed by a seventh angel messenger amen by the Holy Spirit working through them amen sorry that's why the scripture says I threw it up here in Hebrews 10 25 it says what not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching what day the end time the day of our Salvation the day of tribulation for everyone else but the day of our Salvation this is a great test for what your spirit is under these days are you seeking to be in the house of God and in the fellowship with the Saints or are you avoiding it again I'm preaching to the choir here tonight but there's many listening to this and there's many we'll listen to it that are what they're avoiding this for they're joining together with the church because they're bound up by something that won't allow them to Fellowship anymore what is it it's not the Holy Spirit because this is what the holy spirit says will happen to those that are outside of the Holy Spirit they'll forsake the assembling of themselves together humble yourself get back to church again I'm not preaching to the people here but there are people listening that need to hear that amen why because if you get there you can hear what God says about you you can see what he says you're supposed to see you can look for what he says he has waiting for you but if you send it home you're just going to feed yourself whatever will satisfy you to stay with where you're at you've got to get under the preaching of the word with an anointed Ministry and guess what the ministry did not stop with William Branham you can't just sit at home and listen to tapes right because the holy spirit is still moving in real time to speak to people today you need a live Minister today to move on in your walk with Christ amen you can't sit home and do it it's never been ordained the prophet never said to do it amen listen we all need this we all need deliverance from areas in our life I was talking to a minister the other day he said brother John I feel like I'm the lowest of the lowest of my church as a Believer he says I'm always struggling I'm always fighting with things I said join the crowd praise the Lord it means you're at least in a battle at least you're struggling at least you're fighting rather than giving into it but as a minister I'd say that puts me at the top of the Heap for needing these things because why if I get tripped up then it bleeds into an entire congregation right as a mother as a father as a husband as a wife you've got to stay clean you've got to stay tight to the word of God to the presence of God to be delivered from these things otherwise it goes down into your your your family and kids I remember I was talking to a pastor who was dealing with a family situation and and the the daughter had gotten into some issues and he went in and the Holy Spirit said talk to the father first and he went and talked to that man and he says are you having issues with lust and pornography and these things and the brother broke down he said yes I am he said if you fix that your daughter will be okay why because he was the conduit for that Spirit coming into that family he didn't hold himself clean he didn't get deliverance from that and that allowed a channel right into his home so that his daughter could be affected by that that's how serious it is if you don't admit you've got an issue if you don't admit that you're not where you need to be that you've Fallen away from where you used to be then it's a channel for Satan to dance all over your life all day long what is it pride Rises up or fear that someone's going to find out my husband's gonna find out my wife's gonna find out my mom my dad my pastor the church listen the fruits are going to come out eventually anyways listen I love what brother John said he said what if the son comes to the father there's mercy and a sincere confession but when you get caught there's never Mercy it's just judgment because you didn't come and say I need to make it right you got caught I love that as parents hopefully we've got grace and mercy for the for the Willing confession of our children for our spouses even but that's the way you want to call me man brother Bob says no that's the type of the Gospel trumpet you might have served the devil all three's years in Chains with drinking smoking gambling and send dirty things now we don't really identify with that I never smoked in my life I drank once by mistake maybe they put something in that I didn't realize they were putting in one other time willingly actually now that I think about it drinking is not a lot of smoking is not a problem for people in the message but he says no matter what you've done when you hear the gospel trumpet sound it's a sign that you can go free you can go Faith cometh by hearing of the word of God that's why you've got to be under the hearing of the word of God it'll give you Faith to claim what the trumpet says you can have he says now that you've heard the Full Gospel you don't have to stay bound any longer I was reading in the in the gospels this this week and Jesus was talking and he's talking to the to the people that were very righteous he was talking to the laodiceans if I could put it that way and when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that behold need not a physician but they that are sick doctors are for sick people not well people he says but go ye and learn what that meaneth I will have mercy and not sacrifice for I am not come to call the righteous but the Sinners to repentance remember I've said many times that in the church age book it says that the Zeal of the Legacy in ages to repent to be able to humble yourself to the word of God and say I'm not where the word says I should be because what the laodicea and says I don't need anything what does the True Believer say what I have is worthless I want what Christ has for me the latest the season later see him what says they have more than enough what matters to them and what does the believer say I want what matters to him because you've got to wear a garment that he likes not of your own liking amen we read in Romans and the other service where Paul said we are servants to the one that we obey and he was pointing he said there's people going down two completely different paths and they don't really realize it because he'd say what you are him you are servants to him that you obey and people will say well I'm in obedience and think that that means that they're a Believer but the question is what are you obeying because just because you're sincere doesn't mean that you're always obeying God but people will say well I'm being obedient but are you truly obedient to what the word says are you truly obedient to being called out of what we're called out of or are you just going along in a way of your own choosing remember we're talking about a religious spirit here this is the thing that we're fighting in laodicea is a religious spirit we'll talk about it in a little minute amen but you can be led by a lot of things today and guess what we think Satan's gonna jump out as some big demon some black thing something very dark and obvious and guess what that is not the way Satan operates especially with well-taught believers he's not going to be obvious remember brother Brown said I had it in here and I took it out he says to overcome is to recognize Satan in every one of his tricks and to recognize that he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world that you've already overcome you can't overcome by what's inside of you but to recognize Satan in every one of his tricks which means it's not going to be obvious listen Satan disguises himself and his demons as what angels of light scripture says in second Corinthians 11 Paul is dealing with a situation he says but what I do that will I do in order what I'm what I'm doing I'm going to keep doing it that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that were in their Glory they may be found even as we the Amplified it says but what I do I will continue to do for I am to determined to maintain this independence of being bound by obligation to you because you support me in order to cut off the claim of those who would like to find an occasion to claim that in their boasted mission in life they work on the same terms we do what was happening here is Paul was dealing with so-called ministers that said were the same as Paul is and because of that you have to support us as you support Paul you need to support us what was it they were in it for the money so Paul says here he says I work with my hands so that you wouldn't have to pay me he says and I'm going to keep doing that to see who's really in it for the ministering of the Saints and who's in it for the money because if they're in it like I am as they say they are then they'll work without money meaning they'll do whatever it takes to stay independent of influence so Paul was trying to keep people from being copycats of him and he continues to describe them he says for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ transforming themselves not a work of the inward heart but an outward work to show men he says in no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works you can hide your motives every day of your life but in the end the fruit never lies I mentioned it I think last service amen but if you're looking for a big demon to announce itself in life you're not going to see it that way why he says here the demon is a man the demon is a woman it's a minister it's somebody that is appearing to be a believer somebody that is appearing to be spiritual somebody is appearing to be religious but they have another motive and another objective in their life and they'll suck you into something for their benefit and not yours and you can become a slave to it and we've seen this mostly from a Ministry side to be frank if for those that have been around the message a long time you've seen the perusian movement you've seen the two Souls movement you've seen that we're in the Millennium movement you've seen all these different things right and what is it men got caught up in men's Ministries I'm not calling those men Ministers of Darkness but they got caught up in the men rather than in the Holy Spirit and it led them to a place where even if the doctrine may have been correct the attitude was wrong and the fruit of it was that they went into cold formalism and they all died off they never went anywhere good they were drawn down by what Satan was using a man or using the man to influence them to where they put that man to a level higher than he needed to be amen listen us ministers need to watch out for these things especially I speak probably to myself here brother Gerald's essentially you know he's he he's more or less finished his race you know and and he hasn't fallen to the influence of of people in that but I'll tell you it can be a heady feeling when somebody comes to you and says brother John what do I do and whatever I tell them they'll do that's a huge responsibility and if you start to think if I start to think for a second that this is about me I'll lead them astray every time because any influence I have is of him not of myself and any gift I have is of him and not of myself and if there's any any discernments of the holy spirit it's not of me because I don't do it I don't do it instinctively I don't have any conscience of anything that's happening in those areas but you can get caught up in those things and you can draw people to yourself and you can turn it around and you can start to make money off it you can start to make influence pretty soon you become we're not talking about me because I'll never get there pretty soon everyone wants you at their convention pretty soon everybody wants you to come to their special meetings to dedicate their church and you can get to a place where you get caught up in it and all of a sudden you become a servant of anything but the holy spirit because it's about you and you're drawing people to you and these different things that's what I was going to say earlier and I said it a bit last service if you've talked to me anytime in the last couple of months I've said I've been talking about the fruit because Jesus said by your fruit you shall know them and guess what fruit doesn't appear overnight does it there's a reason why we're supposed to watch ministers for a while there's a reason why we're supposed to watch Believers new ones as you come in contact with people we're supposed to watch them and see where is the fruit of it where's the fruit of their life because we can meet people and I've met many through my life and they can only talk about the message of the hour and you think that's a solid believer and then three months down the road they have to make a decision and that decision is completely contrary to the word of God but every time you meet them they'll talk about the message of the hour and you start to say uh oh why because there's a religious spirit operating because they love the knowledge of the message but they won't let the message have control of their life and you start to get these red flags go up oh oh oh oh and they can talk the hind leg off of a mule as the saying goes they can share great Revelations but you look at the life and you say it's not matching up with the word and what I found is usually the people that are busy living it don't have time to talk about it too much you're too busy doing what the word says then to sit there and talk about all the things God's been telling you because usually what God's been telling us about has an effect on our daily life it's not just mind things it's not just intelligence it's not just knowledge it's just not Revelation for the sake of knowing but it's going into our lives and he's working in our lives he's working in our lives and so we don't have time to sit there always and expound on things because we're buried in the Walk we're buried in the relationship it's kind of like if somebody's always talking about their relationship to their spouse usually they don't have much of one now I say this without reverence to the younger couples that are here usually you think your relationship is fantastic and it hasn't been tested yet and as it gets to the testing point you ought you usually realize it's not as good as it used to be and then it starts to grow to match the trial doesn't it it starts to grow to match the test and you have your first kid and all of a sudden you you don't have all the sleep that you would normally get and you don't have all the time to look beautiful that you used to have and and to be you know fit because you always have time to go and all these things and all of a sudden the relationship starts to get challenged doesn't it and all of a sudden you realize we're gonna have to grow this relationship is going to have to expand our love our consideration our patience our Good Will long suffering all these things are going to have to grow otherwise the relationship is going to fail amen wisdom is knowledge applied correctly and it takes the Holy Spirit to apply the word in your life otherwise it's just head it's just in your head it's not going to take you anywhere and I'm not saying people that do that I'm not saying people that make wrong decisions don't have the Holy Ghost because otherwise I don't have it I've made plenty of wrong decisions and I still make them but what it does point to is you've got another influence in your life in that area of your life because God's moving room by room right he's moving room by room he's still at least in mind moving room by Roman he's moving things out and he's filling them up with himself amen so there's areas in my life that maybe aren't fully surrendered in the way they need to be yet but he's got to work in that he's going to work in your life the exact same way amen but if somebody continually rejects the leadership of the Holy Spirit and submitting themselves to what the word of God says then you do have to question what is what anointing are you under absolutely you do brother Branham said he says if you won't live by the word then how can you have it inside of you because the holy spirit will never deny the word of God listen it comes to the place where Paul Peter talking about Paul's writings he says also in his epistle speaking in them of these things in which there are some things hard to be understood Paul was a very very intellectual person but what an anointed Ministry I mean I it blows my mind sometimes some of the things that he comes up with and he didn't come up with it that's the beauty of it he didn't come up with it it's the Holy Spirit gave him these things and he's sharing them with us but he but Peter will point to this and he say which they that are unlearned and unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures onto their own description under their own destruction unlearn it and unstable rest he means they wrestle with it they struggle with it they strive with it they try and manipulate the word of God because it doesn't work the way they think it should work it doesn't do it doesn't agree with how they think it should fit and this is again something us ministers deal with I've mentioned it before sometimes we get a revelation I'm speaking from actual personal experience including this week where you think God's given you something and you go and you start to look in the word of God and everything's good until you hit one scripture and it doesn't work and the question of whether or not you're truly anointed is what will you do when you hit that one thing that doesn't agree with this great Revelation that you've had because you've got to throw the whole thing away the whole thing the whole thing I was literally typing this sermon up in my notes and I was typing typing and it's just flowing and this is the way it works I was just flowing then I stopped and I said where did that come from that is total baloney I'm being serious I'm being serious now because guess what you can be anointed but that does not mean that Satan's not in there trying to drill a thought into your head and if he can slide it in there and put in a seated discrepancy where somebody says why where did Jonathan come up with that don't even call me brother where did John come up with that it wasn't the Holy Spirit you gotta check every word you got to check every word amen it's the same thing with ours what what Peter's talking about here is that people take the word and they apply it they go in and they look for confirmation of their decision that's not the way it works they're looking it's confirmation bias you'll only read what what matches what your decision has already made right but what he's saying is they wrestle with it they manipulate it they're trying to bring it to a place where they can in good conscience can doing doing what they continue doing what they've already decided to do and that's not the way it works we're supposed to bring every thought subject to the word of God not bring the word subject to the thought we don't shape the word with our thought but we shape our thought we shape our decision with the word of God Amen the Amplified there says those that are ignorant and unstable twist and misconstrue to their own utter destruction just as they distort and misinterpret the rest of the scriptures you'll find that people there are people that every decision they make they say I've checked it with the word but then you go and you read the entire word and you see that it can't make sense it's because they stopped when they found what they were looking for rather than pulling it through the entire thing brother Brown says it's got to be Genesis to revelation Old Testament New Testaments got to line up you've got to have two points of of reference for it pull it all the way through amen so we can get stuck when we misconstrue but you know we can get stuck at believing and by believing I mean saying I believe not just believing because believing will true belief will take you somewhere but we can stop at just saying I believe we can we can sit here as message Believers as as believing we're part of the bride of Christ and just nod our heads and say I believe but that is not what believing is because brother Brown says if you believed it you'd do it amen and Jesus said this he was he was talking to the people when they heard a minister and he's early on in his ministry and it says as he spake these words many believed on him great start but Jesus said then just said Jesus to these Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed if you look at the the Greek and that it means to hold fast and live by this so if you believe it hold fast and live by it that's when you're my disciples not when you just nod your head and say I believe or when you say amen he says if you do that you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and again I'm trying to bring this to our our level today because I believe we're being raised in a message culture and for anyone that's traveled you know to to you camps and other churches and these different things it's very easy to get caught up in a culture of what the message teaches where everybody dresses a certain way they act a certain way and we all should there should be relative uniformity across the way we we act and and the things we say the way we dress and these different things but but it's this idea that you're raised around truth and therefore you are right and brother Branham said and we've read it there where he says no that's just joining a church he says You must be a son or a daughter of God you must go through a new birth you must come through the way they did in Acts 2 38. you must go through what they went through in the upper room you've got to come through that it is not a culture amen it's great it's good to have it it's healthy and it's wholesome but that is not going to get you in the rapture it's not going to get you in the Rapture because the message without the Holy Ghost is just at another denomination I'm saying a message culture you know what I'm talking about amen amen remember the reward in the Book of Revelation is not to him that has great revelation is it says to him that overcometh amen that means you've got to move from believing to living you got to move from not in your head and say Amen to doing what you said amen to it's got to be a Wellspring inside of you that's coming up and bubbling out that's drawing the fruit of the Holy Spirit into your life amen that that Prophet came to do one thing and that was give us a message that would give us over Pat overcoming power to take us into a rapture all he was interested in was getting a bride out and up out of and into and to what a relationship with Christ that would draw her off of this Earth amen what does revelation do Revelation shows you what God's doing and it also shows you what Satan's doing but if you don't heed it then what's the point of it if you're going to come to church and ignore everything that's said over the pulpit you might as well stay home and watch a hockey game for all the good it's going to do you because you're just going to be judged by what comes over this Pulpit if you're not going to hear it that's a horrible place to be amen this is it becomes judgment when we don't hear it it's Mercy if we heed it in this judgment if we don't amen men how we treat the word of God is how we treat him if we want to get down to it brother Bob says this he says the sounding of the trumpet yes sir return dispersed but if you sold your inheritance if you sold out and done these things he says what am I saying return back if you joined up with some cult that tries to keep you away from fellowship with other Brethren leave the thing this is Jubilee amen return return this is jubilee don't let it pass by remember don't let it pass by he says if you've sold out they caught me there because the question I asked myself is what's my price what's my price to what am I sold out to how I spend my time how I spend my energy how I spend my money that's how that's my that's where you'll see what prices I I'm willing to be sold for because whatever I'm doing that for is what has bought me is what has given me what I need so if I'm doing it for the kingdom of God then I've sold out to the right thing but if I'm seeking the things that are of this world then I've sold out to something else and my price is not a spiritual price it's a natural price just like Kane just like Esau right they were willing to sell for something that was not what eternal and they got caught up in it if you've sold out if you went out in the world if you've sinned you know that you once had the experience so remember he's not talking about somebody that is a ranked sinner that's never known the good things of God he says if you've known that you once had the experience you went and joined up where you came fellowship with the rest of them you've done all these things I don't care what you've done if you're a son you have a right to return now because it's Jubilee but if you settle back into a wall somewhere put your name down and anchored got all chickenized there isn't going to much happen to you because you'll never hear it he's talking about what if you're an eagle in a chicken pen and you hear that eagle scream and you don't come out he says you'll be pretty chickenized by the time it's all said and done you'll just say I'm a chicken like the rest of them you'll never be a good chicken and you'll never be a good eagle you got to get out of there he says you'll walk out and say well I guess it was all right I've heard that before I feel bad for brother Gerald sometimes and the older folks here because you've heard most of it you've heard most of it there's probably not a whole lot of new things coming over the pulpit anymore you know Brandon warns against it don't let it become common to you and then the word is the word and I'll tell you one thing if if if I if I underline something new every time it came out of my Bible be full of ink you'd be underlining over and over again the same scripture because it means something different to you almost every other time you read it right because it's ever unfolding it's ever unfolding I think the difficulty somebody is sometimes as an older person is you're waiting for us young people to catch up to you right and that's difficult sometimes but he says see go home sleep it off and get up the next morning he says but conviction you don't sleep off the word of God you can't shake off if you're an eagle you've caught something it's good when you go into a church when you go into a service and something just calls you right out not calls you out but it catches your attention and you know that was just for me and you go home and you can chew on that thing for a month because you know God was in it and you'll sit there and you'll just ruminate and ruminate on it and you'll dream about it and you'll wake up thinking about it and the songs you have in your head will be like it and you'll be running everything through that filter for the next month because you know God gave it to you and it's a special thing but brother Brown says if you walk out and say ah yeah I heard that before but the John's getting really repetitive that's tough because he says what that's not the way it works for an eagle when they hear the word of God they latch onto it amen but religious Spirits are the Hallmark of the laodicean age and you know it because it loves to talk but it hates to act a religious spirit is all talk no action amen it's satisfied with the knowledge of the word but it refuses the correction the direction and the boundaries of that the word of God places on their life amen and what happens is they miss the blessings of God and they miss the fullness of the anointing for this age because you've choked it off you've throttled it you've held it back and God can't do everything he's supposed to Paul warned Timothy about this and we're coming to a close he says what these people are having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away brother Adam this is a a very short quote he says the Antichrist spirit is a religious spirit that's a scary thought because remember I'm listening to the message that see to see the discrepancy brother Brown comes to that scripture it says that that they grow up together and the the two Spirits are so close that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible that's how tight we're talking about it he says it's within the framework of the church that's that's a scary thought to think that Satan is not roaming around out there and these these alternative lifestyle movements and that he's in all of that but he's working right in here trying to work in here trying to get in trying to slide something into your life and you don't even realize it the best thing saying Duke is be in your life and you not know about it because why do you need Deliverance if you don't know about it that's why we come and hear the trumpet of the Gospel it lets you know it tells you when something's off amen brother Brahm says but God knows what he's doing as long as he's leading you see you must always go by the spirit and the spirit will always agree with the word now if the spirit leads you contrary to the word then it's not the spirit of God that's very simple Church if it is contrary to this it is never ever ever the Holy Spirit no matter which way we try and pull it which way we dice it which way we argue it which way we we pull it around in our head no matter how long we argue it if it doesn't agree with this the holy spirit is not leading you and there's only one other Spirit besides the Holy Spirit and it's a seed of discrepancy right it's satanic in its origin he says now if the holy spirit is leading you it'll say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now you can sit here and say brother John why are you preaching on religious Spirits you're supposed to be preaching on the Jubilee this is supposed to be wonderful it's supposed to be Freedom it's supposed to be all these things I'm preaching on it because this is what the laodicean church age fights is a religious spirit so I'm not saying you have it I'm saying watch out for it watch out for it if the word stops having an effect on your life you've got a religious spirit on you you say can the Holy Spirit person have a religious spirit absolutely absolutely why pride gets up fear gets up worry gets up anything basically you take the opposite of the fruits of the holy spirit that will allow a religious spirit to come in and it'll get a a toe hold and they'll turn into a stronghold as brother Joe talked about in your life but again it's temporary by God's grace because he's not going to lose a one right the ones that are in the palms of his hand he's not going to miss a one he said they're always going to be there but that doesn't mean you can't come under another influence absolutely you can absolutely you can every mistake you make you've allowed another influence into your life that's all it is but it's if you continually do it it's probably not a thing to talk about over the pulpit but in gambling they talk about doubling down so if you make a bet and you're convinced that you're going to win whatever you're playing you there's an option to double down you can double your bet and what happens so often is people double down on their Badness their bad decisions on their mistakes and they they refuse to acknowledge that they were wrong and what happens is they go even further down into it and that's when the religious spirit comes in first one's an influence right you just you gave in you you weren't quite there where you needed to be you had a bad day you didn't have devotions that morning whatever it might be but when you double down on it that's when you open the door for a truly religious spirit to come in because now you're trying to hide the failure and the mistake and the problem and the faults and these different things right how do you know a religious spirit it never overcomes it never overcomes that's what that's what we just read in Timothy remember he says a form of godliness but denying the power thereof they never get what overcoming power in their life because the first Victory is here first Victory is here as a as a Believer as young young believers to our young people the first Victory is always going to be inside it's going to be your nature it's going to be your mind it's going to be the way you think it's the way you make decisions it's not going to be all this stuff outside it's going to be inside of you the way you approach the way you react and all of these different things amen but what happens we get up and we we start to fear loss of reputation loss of status loss of money loss of relationship closeness of relationship whatever it is whatever little thing we've got we say if they find out it'll ruin things and that's when a religious spirit has such a toll hold is when we're scared that somebody's going to realize that we've got an issue that we're not what we say we are that's the toehold Satan's looking for is when we try and build a facade rather than say this one's for me Lord this one's for me that's me that's me he's talking about whatever it is we're not I'm not being specific here today but remember the scripture says if we walk in the light as he's in the light then have we Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all of our sins we're supposed to love the light we're supposed to love the light we're supposed to embrace it when brother John Andes was here there were some moments there where you just wanted to duck for myself I'll say because it and and I've had it from other ministers as well of course but you just want to duck because it's so piercing but that's the human nature that's what a religious spirit wants to do is duck away from the light but a child of God says you got me that's true yay Lord yay Lord that's me and then when you do that what does that allow that opens the door all the way open and the Holy Spirit can come in and he can burn it out he can clean it out he can move it out he can push it out he can beat it out he can do whatever he needs to do whatever it's been hiding behind that little door in your life behind that concern behind that attitude behind that cynicism behind that complex that depression relationship issues whatever it might be he can come in there and he can start to move now but when you slam the door and say nope don't need it been dealing with that all my life and it's been okay he's got nowhere to go amen what is it you rather not you're a slave than be freed from the slavery you're in that's a sad place Hebrews 10 39 says but we are not of them who draw back into Perdition that word perdition means Eternal misery and that's a miserable place to be when the word has no effect in your life when you would rather duck and hide than to let it take and ha and do what it's supposed to do in your life amen you aren't miserable but if you move back that's where you end up knows it says move back into miserably you left misery I was miserable I've talked about him many times before I gave my heart to the Lord I was miserable because I I wanted to be saved but I didn't know if I wanted to be saved and you're in that back and forth you're in no man's land but soon as you give your life to God now you're in now you're in a defined area now you're headed in a Direction but Paul says if you pull back from there that's when you get into trouble you get into misery because you draw back from where the word is going it's moving forward it's opening things up in your life and you pull back and you say nah I don't want any of that that's when you get miserable and guess what a child of God is miserable outside of the presence of the father you know brother brother John was talking about that that that prodigal son he says and when he came to himself you know what he heard he heard a jubilee trumpet but he only he was the only one that heard it he says even the servants in My Father's House live better than I am he says I'll go back and I'll take even a servant's role better than where I got myself in all of this that's what we're talking about don't draw back when you hear it but embrace it amen because why when the trumpet sounds you've got to go in the right direction because so many people remember we talked about every seven years you got free from jail you got free from your debt you got free from your slavery why because we're human and God built in a Grace law every seven years because we're prone to failure and what happened so many times is they went in and a problem gotten into debt they got relief from it and then they ranked back and they found a new habit if they went from an old jail to a new jail they went from an old Habit to a new habit they went from one bad relationship to another bad relationship they went from one casino to the next Casino all they did was they continued doing what they were doing just in another place and it got them in the Dead all over again I'll get a move to a new church I'm going to move to a new town I'm going to start a new job it doesn't change anything because you're the same amen right you had to go to your land because your land was where God was going to work with you and bless you amen what we need to get where God wants us to be so that our battles mean something because what happens is if you're not on your land you're fighting over somebody else's property and what happens is you're getting in a fight where you've got no right to win right that's it so I laugh at these things on social media and people getting into fights with people and then I'm like this is not your land you're never gonna win you're never going to win and we get into fights with people about relationships and this and that and the other stay in your lane get in your land get in your position and fight there because God will back you up when you're where he wants you to be amen not where you're you're not where you're trying to hurt somebody else to their point but you stay in your land God will get them to their land you stay in your land that's where you can do it I've said it before the prodigal father this the father The Prodigal Son never went looking he stayed where the son could find him he knew where he could go he had to go back to my father's house it's the same thing with us stay in your place stay in your position that way God can he can back you up but if you're running around all over the place doing things Helter Skelter this way that way God can't touch you there otherwise you're just getting out of one slavery and into another one then you get into what the Death March just like the children of Israel it's just circular hiking in the desert and that's not fun for anybody nobody likes hiking around in circles in the desert they die they call it the Death March brother Bram says this now a man and his family could go back to their original inheritance if they could hear the Jubilee and a trumpet sound and know what it meant to them now if they heard the priest sound the trumpet he says the minister the trumpet is the gospel and when they hear it and they know what it means and they know that that's their inheritance no matter where they'd lost how far they went back whatever they had to do they had the privilege to come and receive again their their inheritance the whole family could come and receive their inheritance so it is tonight that men and women that knows the things that we do know and have heard from our brother in different ones of our Pentecostal experience of years ago and he says we find that we have walled or if we haven't walled ourselves away from it so far that we got to hear what somebody says instead of what thus saith the Lord is what is he says you started listening to sermons instead of thus saith the Lord and can hear what the word of God has got to say about it now is the hour of Jubilee to come back to your original inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again again he didn't say come to a real Holy Ghost for the first time he says come again to it come back to it you've been pulled away from it now come back to it it's available again remember he could go free didn't have to pay nothing didn't have to do nothing just get up and go and that's all he had to do go back if he knew the sound of the trumpet but he had to know the sound of the trumpet sea for they were sons of God trumpet was only for the seat of Abraham remember that's the only thing that made any sense to didn't mean anything to the Gentiles didn't mean that the slaves that they brought in from the enemies that they defeated or bought in another slave market it only meant something to those that were born free in the first place you know what's sad about this about this Year of Jubilee it's about the only Grace you find built into the law and they stop doing it they stopped blowing the trumpet when they had that issue where they CA you know the Gad and uh Manasseh have to try manasse and what not went out of the land they stopped doing it they said because we're not all where we're supposed to be then this doesn't apply anymore and then when the kings came in all of a sudden they're not under ministerial rule they're under King rule so they said we don't have to do that either and so they pulled Grace right out of the law so all of a sudden property could change hands now now people couldn't be freed from debt now people were being bound and then in the end you'll see it and we'll cover it in the next service where God judged them for it he says you've got to go for 70 years because you missed 490 years that you were supposed to be doing this you're doing this for years and years and years and you never sounded to Jubilee trumpet you bound yourselves you bound your own people he says and now I'm going to bind you because of what you did you took Grace out of the law he says and now you've got to pay a price for it listen that might have stopped back then but when Christ came he blew the Jubilee trumpet and ever since then he's been blowing it guess what you don't have to wait every seven years to hear the Jubilee trumpet it's blowing every service we're here it's blowing every time you open your Bible it's blown every time you turn on a message tape every service you stream online whatever it is that gospel trumpet is blowing day in and day out because it's time for us to go home and he's trying to free us he's trying to freeze he's trying to let get us to let go let go of what we've got inside let go of what our families got let go of our complexes let go of our hearts let go of our offenses let go of the draws of the world and come into the good things that God has for us amen he's got an inheritance there and brother Bram says it's the sons of God it's the daughters of God that hear the trumpet because it means something to them and they know that there's something that's waiting for you brother Graham said thus saith the Lord is what's come and it's blowing a freedom trumpet amen what's it doing it's removing our spiritual amnesia I remember a funny story I think it was Billy Paul might have been Brother Joseph Branham and they share books with friends you know in different ones and they gave a message uh to it to one man and they they gave the same message to a couple different people and one man came back and he kind of shook it in their face and he said this man called me a buzzard foreign Billy Paul said that's funny because he called me an eagle and the same message why because the trumpet meant one thing to one and didn't mean anything to the other and so he was what he was judged by it he was condemned by it but if you're sitting here and you're under the preaching of the word and it means something to you what does it mean it means he's calling you to go free amen let's Stand Together where we're going next time we're going to what people sorry just turned that back brother vaishal I got one more the next service I don't want to you know what's a bit tough to preach on real experience before that's what we're going to talk about in the next service amen they stop blowing the trumpet and then Christ comes along and says the trumpet's going to blow and it's going to blow and blow and blow until every son and daughter of God hears it and comes back to where they're supposed to be amen let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord I know it's words of warning tonight Lord not the funnest thing to preach for sure but Lord I know I can look at my own life and see areas where Lord I'm not where I need to be Lord and as I get older lord it's not so much maybe what we're doing Lord in terms of the things of the world and whatnot Lord but its attitudes we take Lord its reactions we have it's thoughts that we have it's Lord and unwillingness to to bend or bow Lord It's a Lord it can be judgmental even at times but Lord we want to have the nature of Christ and all of these things Heavenly Father Lord that your spirit would have a free reign that we'd not be looking Lord to to set up an image of ourselves or Lord a facade of spirituality but Lord that we would be soft and tender towards the moving of the spirit Lord that we'd be quick to heed it or that we be quick to Humble ourselves Lord that we'd be quick to repent ourselves Lord of where we fail so often Lord so I pray you Minister Lord you know what each heart has hold has a need of this evening Lord Lord you know where Satan's got his hooks into US Lord you know where maybe there's doors we don't want to open up too much and Lord you see into my life and you see my struggles Lord I pray you minister to me Lord

and we believe it Lord but that means every generation also have its repentance Lord that they've got to have the humbling to the word to go with that Revival Lord so I lift up our young people Lord I pray you give them Victory every day that they would see the the tricks and the influences of Satan in their lives Lord for the young parents Lord and the young married couples Lord even the young the the unmarried amongst the sword each one Lord may you lead us and guide us and Lord for the elders Among Us Lord may they help to show us the way by the Holy Spirit Lord not just by word but indeed in examples of their life also Lord may you give them strength day by day Lord a heart to help and lead and guide and Mentor us we pray Lord and above all may your Holy Spirit Lord may the great holy spirit that you sent back on the day of Pentecost Lord that's come down in this age in its fullness again Lord may we just be so surrendered to it Lord may it just lead us in God to stay in and day

you for a bit may you just Lord convince us of our goodness that happens Lord when we obey the trumpet Lord when the Jubilee sounds if we'll just walk towards you Lord free our spirits to Worship You
