[36:54] and sing it today good god help me amen
[36:56] it's found in the
[36:59] book of st. John the gospel you put your
[37:01] Bible there
[37:03] you know the story Nicodemus came to the
[37:06] Lord there was a man of the Pharisees
[37:09] named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the
[37:12] same came to Jesus by night and said
[37:14] unto him rabbi we know that what a
[37:17] teacher come from God for no man can do
[37:19] these things this miracles that thou
[37:22] doest except God with him jesus
[37:24] answering said unto him very various
[37:26] aren't you except a man be born again he
[37:28] cannot see the kingdom of God mmm so I
[37:32] remember when I was a little boy Jeff a
[37:35] long time ago
[37:37] the missionaries when they came to
[37:38] Africa they would sing these songs and
[37:40] teach us when at that time I didn't
[37:43] really take much of it it didn't mean
[37:45] much to me but I remember this song amen
[37:47] but when I came to the Lord by His grace
[37:49] then this song meant so much to me and
[37:52] my
[37:53] principal
[37:55] message and I preached I meant I've been
[37:58] in the new wave hellmen so how this we
[38:00] try and sing it and then you can help me
[38:02] with a diamond
[38:06] there was a man called eco Tomas he came
[38:13] to Jesus by night and say how can a man
[38:19] be born
[38:27] how can they be born again
[38:32] here was a man corny
[38:35] Kojima
[38:37] he came to Jesus by night and say how
[38:43] can a baby born again
[38:52] [Music]
[38:54] be born and there was a they wasn't
[38:59] meant for Miko demons he came to Jesus
[39:04] by night and say how can he be born
[39:10] again
[39:17] [Music]
[39:22] [Applause]
[39:46] she was hinting for me huh
[39:52] he came to Jesus by night and said how
[39:57] can
[40:00] my lord
[40:15] [Applause]
[40:24] [Applause]
[41:24] [Music]
[41:47] [Music]
[41:51] forget it
[41:53] it just wouldn't go away
[41:57] so I asked again Lord wash my sin and
[42:03] this is all he'd say
[42:06] [Music]
[42:10] what's it
[42:15] what's in
[42:17] that's as far away as the East is from
[42:21] the West
[42:23] [Music]
[42:28] what's it
[42:32] what's it
[42:35] and it was gone the very minute you
[42:39] confess
[42:44] buried in the sea
[42:48] a
[42:49] forgetfulness
[42:52] [Music]
[42:59] the heaviest load you carry is a load of
[43:04] guilt and shame
[43:05] [Music]
[43:07] you were never meant to bury
[43:11] so let it go in Jesus name
[43:17] I got a angered and he's quick to
[43:20] forgive our sin so
[43:24] just put them under the blood and don't
[43:28] bring it up again
[43:32] cuz he'll just say what's in
[43:36] what's
[43:38] in
[43:40] that's as far away as the East is from
[43:44] the West
[43:50] what's it
[43:53] [Music]
[43:54] what's in it was gone the very minute
[44:00] you confess

[44:19] for my accusing memory
[44:24] nothing makes me weep this way
[44:28] but when I hear you
[44:31] [Music]
[44:34] what see
[44:38] what's in that's as far away as the East
[44:44] is from
[44:51] what's it
[44:55] what's in it was gone the very minute
[45:01] you confess
[45:07] buried in the sea
[45:09] [Music]
[45:10] of forgetfulness
[45:12] [Music]
[45:17] buried in the sea
[45:21] I forget for me
[45:25] [Music]
[45:30] [Applause]
[45:45] amen
[45:47] lor bless and thank
[45:50] the Lord for the special assistant this
[45:53] morning and
[45:56] surprised
[45:57] for it too here died in Menasha I
[46:01] was expecting the whole family of the
[46:04] sink and so the Lord bless us all we
[46:08] enjoyed it and I believe God was in it
[46:10] by the grace of God so the Lord ever
[46:12] bless is my prayer and I want to welcome
[46:17] the coffee family not the ones that are
[46:20] here every morning but the ones that are
[46:22] that are here every two years
[46:27] so it's not a testimony against your
[46:29] Christianity trusting that wherever you
[46:32] are that you are in worship with the
[46:34] Lord so I just want to welcome our
[46:36] brother Barry back again and look
[46:38] forward for the hearing of the word and
[46:40] the dedication of the Assembly and I
[46:43] know it's been on the minds of the
[46:45] Saints for quite a while wondering when
[46:48] and who was going to dedicate the the
[46:51] Assembly of the church to the Lord so we
[46:55] just waited on the Lord at least I was
[46:57] waiting on the Lord and
[46:59] there were different suggestions and
[47:02] we'll see what the Lord will do so the
[47:05] Lord he predestinated it he ordained it
[47:09] I believe for our brother Barry to do it
[47:12] having begun his ministry here having
[47:16] begun his testimony here that the Lord
[47:19] was send him back to dedicate the church
[47:22] here so we thank God for that and we
[47:25] welcome our brother and be in prayer for
[47:27] her brother as he comes to to minister
[47:31] of the word
[47:32] and the leaders into the dedication of
[47:35] the of the set of the building but also
[47:38] of the people that we'd be dedicated to
[47:42] the Lord and for his glory and so we
[47:46] welcome brother Barry and sister Becky
[47:49] and
[47:52] I guess is not just brother and sister
[47:55] now as it's not even mom and dad anymore
[47:58] is popping a name
[48:01] it just shows that we're getting older
[48:04] and there's another generation rising
[48:07] but it's also a blessing to to look and
[48:11] to see the younger generation serving
[48:14] the Lord a man I was expressing that to
[48:18] I think brother Matthew the other day I
[48:20] said that is a tremendous testimony to
[48:23] any church for a pastor to be able to
[48:26] look and see
[48:27] young people in the congregation
[48:31] because as I quoted some time ago from a
[48:36] book that was written by I don't know
[48:38] maybe some magazine like magazine
[48:40] Maclean's magazine and and the book was
[48:44] entitled they're gone and
[48:47] it was based on the attitude of young
[48:50] people towards the church and all that
[48:53] most young people have left the church
[48:56] most young people have no interest in
[48:59] church and they said they are gone and
[49:02] that is the truth and you will find that
[49:05] even around the message and it's the
[49:07] grace of God in the lives of our brother
[49:10] Andrew and Peter and Luke and Steven
[49:12] today and then and there their lives and
[49:16] and their children that they are still
[49:19] with it still pressing by the grace of
[49:22] God into the kingdom so I pray God bless
[49:25] you in your fellowship with us in these
[49:28] next few days and of course also to
[49:30] welcome the Macondo family and I assume
[49:34] the Colombo family will be back shortly
[49:38] with this week I assume
[49:41] Tuesday so they'll be back and when
[49:44] brother Bob said he said you'll take it
[49:46] after sister Rebecca sings and the only
[49:51] sister Rebecca I could think of was was
[49:53] our black sister
[49:57] so the sister Rebecca there sang was in
[50:00] no way like like the one that I knew and
[50:03] the one that we expect back on Tuesday
[50:06] sister Rebecca Colombo and I said
[50:09] Rebecca I said she's not back yet
[50:12] but God bless you sister and
[50:15] enjoyed the song and may God make it a
[50:19] revelation to our hearts a man so the
[50:22] Lord bless you all and also to ask you
[50:25] to remember in prayer brother Philip
[50:28] power in Chapel arm he was released from
[50:31] the hospital yesterday I believe and he
[50:34] is going back again on Tuesday for
[50:37] surgery so remember him in prayer is
[50:41] he's going to be out of it as it were
[50:44] for maybe I don't know maybe three four
[50:47] or five months he had moved back from
[50:50] Edmonton his wife is from the Yukon and
[50:53] so he is now living in his mother's home
[50:57] in Chapel arm but because of the
[51:00] injuries to his leg and arm it's he's he
[51:03] won't be able to work so pray the grace
[51:05] of God for him as he returns on Tuesday
[51:08] for surgery and
[51:11] also our neighbor was released from the
[51:14] hospital he had fallen down the steps
[51:16] and he was released from the hospital
[51:17] yesterday as well so we thank the Lord
[51:20] for that
[51:22] so I'm going to turn it over to our
[51:24] brother Barry and
[51:26] I want to thank you too for your prayers
[51:30] for myself and
[51:32] trusting that the recovery is going to
[51:37] be hastened by the grace of God so I can
[51:40] get back into the pulpit again and as I
[51:43] said I'm I've got a chair so I'll bring
[51:46] the chair sit on the chair preach
[51:48] by the grace of God I did that when we
[51:51] had surgery for the hernia and I just
[51:55] said Haran preach I
[51:58] just
[51:59] they're calling it's just a zeal this
[52:02] the enthusiasm of the Holy Ghost call in
[52:05] your life and brother Branson whatever
[52:08] you do don't lose your zeal and
[52:10] enthusiasm and he said don't lose the
[52:13] spirit of revival a man so I pray God
[52:17] that you know that'll be in the ministry
[52:20] and it was not in the ministry it won't
[52:22] be in the congregation so God's grace to
[52:25] us and
[52:26] we'll turn it to our brother Barry and
[52:29] I'll rest for for a little while so Lord
[52:34] bless you and look forward to the
[52:35] fellowship this afternoon and our
[52:37] brother marks so god bless you each and

[54:48] gathered together in this place today we
[54:51] are thrilled Lord to see what you have

[54:54] this wonderful building just a sanctuary

[54:59] saints we are we are just so thankful

[55:21] present ourselves a living sacrifice
[55:23] holy and acceptable unto you which is

[55:29] would just speak to our hearts move
[55:31] among us I pray and Lord we just are so
[55:35] just so humble when we think about your
[55:38] calling in our lives Lord and your
[55:39] choosing how Lord Jesus in the great
[55:42] stream of humanity your sauce and
[55:44] predestinated us from before the
[55:46] foundation of the world and now we stand

[55:59] moment here and I
[56:02] just want to greet you all in the name
[56:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ is certainly
[56:05] good to see all of you today and they
[56:07] have all of you here and
[56:09] building our condo god bless you great
[56:12] to have you and I tell you I just
[56:15] appreciated that that singing and I feel
[56:17] right at home when the Africans sing
[56:19] I've said this many times and I mean it
[56:22] with all my heart that when we get to
[56:24] heaven we'll have a wonderful time of
[56:25] fellowship over there and if nobody else
[56:27] sings we're just gonna let the Africans
[56:29] sing I
[56:31] always said you're not in the message
[56:33] and until you've heard the African sing
[56:35] and you're not in the bride until you
[56:36] had the people from Malawi sing and
[56:38] they're just extra special and very
[56:40] gifted and it's just always a blessing
[56:42] to me so I appreciate your words and and
[56:45] your song today I wanted to just proceed
[56:49] and talk a little bit about the church
[56:51] here this morning before we have a word
[56:53] of prayer and I wanted to read the
[56:54] scripture together but you know I was
[56:57] thinking as I was
[56:59] walking around the building here and I
[57:01] see some of the familiar trappings of
[57:03] every church that this church has ever
[57:05] been in that if I remember correctly the
[57:10] the start of it was in in Max's building
[57:14] impairment on the Paramount Theatre
[57:15] right then old building and that's where
[57:18] we started first and it was
[57:20] two of you and you and me and mom right
[57:25] and that's where it began and
[57:28] then there was a couple of others that
[57:31] came and of course then brother Earl
[57:32] came in sister Betty god bless you came
[57:35] in and then from there it was Plymouth
[57:36] Road right no it was duck her Street in
[57:40] the basement of duck rich Street where I
[57:42] preached my first sermon that's right
[57:44] and we had to lock the doors because
[57:47] people would steal the pictures and so
[57:48] forth out of the lobby
[57:50] and we had some good meetings in that
[57:53] andhaka how could I forget Duckworth
[57:54] Street and from there it was Plymouth
[57:56] Road
[57:58] and we worshiped in the upper part of
[58:00] Plymouth Road for a while and then from
[58:03] there the car let's house right we're
[58:07] sister coffee son our one and only
[58:09] special and then from there it was a
[58:12] Christian Science church right for a
[58:15] good while and then to Al calluses right
[58:19] and now Conception Bay who ever would
[58:22] have thought we'd wind up in Conception
[58:23] Bay
[58:24] but over those years a lot has happened
[58:27] a lot of a lot of Ministers come through
[58:30] a lot of good services and a lot of
[58:32] things have happened and you know it's
[58:34] just like I say it's just a wonderful
[58:36] thing to see how God has led the church
[58:38] and bless the church and held you folks
[58:40] together and way out here and this
[58:42] outpost in Newfoundland but it's it's
[58:45] it's just something that's very dear to
[58:48] my heart and it's always a pleasure to
[58:50] come back and and see all of you again
[58:52] and
[58:53] I think over those years I think God
[58:56] honors your faithfulness and now has
[58:57] given you this wonderful building here
[58:59] and the ability to be able to you know
[59:01] have it for yourselves and renovate it
[59:03] and make it look so lovely it looks like
[59:04] it's always been here it's it's a fit it
[59:07] looks like it's the right place and
[59:10] maybe this would be the last place on
[59:12] the list you know and the next step will
[59:14] be in the glory and that'll be our next
[59:16] house but I just we're just excited for
[59:20] you and glad for you and trust that the
[59:22] Lord will bless you and meet you here
[59:23] and and speak to you over these years
[59:26] that you're in this in this place here
[59:27] we trust that it won't be very long but
[59:30] over those years we trust that good
[59:33] things happen here among you and the
[59:35] Lord will add to your numbers and and
[59:38] and bless you abundantly I was just
[59:41] recently my wife and I were in Boston we
[59:42] were celebrating our 30th wedding
[59:44] anniversary and we went downtown they
[59:46] have a Heritage Trail where you can go
[59:48] around the downtown area and see all
[59:50] these historic places where significant
[59:53] thing things happen in the early history
[59:55] of America and one of the places we went
[59:58] into was the old meeting house and in
[1:00:02] there it was just a real thrill for me
[1:00:04] to be in there and it was a place where
[1:00:05] when it was built was two stories two or
[1:00:07] three stories high but it was a tallest
[1:00:09] building in Boston when it was built in
[1:00:11] the 1700s I believe and George
[1:00:14] Whitefield had preached in that church
[1:00:16] and but it wasn't a church it was a
[1:00:18] meeting house it was the biggest place
[1:00:20] that they could have for GAD public
[1:00:23] gatherings and church gatherings and so
[1:00:25] forth and the the Quakers would meet in
[1:00:29] there and the the fundamental churches
[1:00:32] and Cotton Mather and increase Mather
[1:00:34] and those folks I don't know if you
[1:00:36] ringing any bells here or not but they
[1:00:39] all met in this house and and the
[1:00:41] Quakers and the Puritans they believe
[1:00:42] that you know the building didn't matter
[1:00:45] to them from that from that era the
[1:00:49] building itself didn't matter they were
[1:00:51] the church they knew that we are the
[1:00:53] church and wherever we are gathered
[1:00:54] that's where the Lord would meet us and
[1:00:56] the building was inconsequential it was
[1:00:58] just a tool that we were able to use so
[1:01:00] that we could gather together because
[1:01:01] God's people like to gather together but
[1:01:04] to them they were they were convinced
[1:01:06] they didn't need to have a fancy
[1:01:07] building they didn't need to have a big
[1:01:09] structure they were the church and
[1:01:11] wherever they gathered together and
[1:01:13] there was some great ministers who came
[1:01:15] through and that public meeting house
[1:01:17] there and they they worshiped there
[1:01:19] actually for a long while and it was
[1:01:22] there just a real blessing to be and
[1:01:24] there were a George Whitefield I'd read
[1:01:25] a lot about George Whitfield over the
[1:01:27] years in the time of the Wesley brothers
[1:01:28] and
[1:01:30] different ones and so it was just a real
[1:01:32] honor to be right there had my picture
[1:01:34] taken next to the pulpit where George
[1:01:37] would feel preached but remember this
[1:01:39] that you know we appreciate the building
[1:01:42] we appreciate the structure appreciate
[1:01:43] how nice it looks and I'll break the
[1:01:45] lights are
[1:01:46] but more importantly never forget that
[1:01:50] you're the church when Jesus when Jesus
[1:01:53] went to Calvary he wasn't thinking of
[1:01:55] this
[1:01:56] he was thinking of this
[1:01:59] and that's what's really important for
[1:02:01] you to remember and and so we just trust
[1:02:04] that Lord will meet with you and and
[1:02:06] bless you abundantly now if you don't
[1:02:08] mind I'd like to sing a little course
[1:02:09] that we sing at home sister Becky if

[1:05:18] praise the Lord let's take our feet
[1:05:21] let's take your Bible if you don't mind
[1:05:22] I'd like to go to second chronicles the
[1:05:24] fifth chapter
[1:05:25] thank you and let's take a look here
[1:05:33] at the dedicating of Solomon's Temple
[1:05:36] here brother Brandon preached this
[1:05:39] sermon called dedication of building to
[1:05:42] the Lord back in 1959 I believe it was
[1:05:45] and
[1:05:47] he used this scripture in the dedicating
[1:05:50] of this church and this was not his own
[1:05:51] church this was a church that he was
[1:05:53] asked to dedicate in the in the u.s. I
[1:05:56] believe was in Indiana somewhere and
[1:05:57] this is the scripture that he read so
[1:06:00] let's read it together this chapter here
[1:06:03] thus all the work that Solomon made for
[1:06:06] the house of the Lord was finished and
[1:06:07] Solomon brought in all the things that
[1:06:09] David his father had dedicated and the
[1:06:12] silver and the gold and all the
[1:06:13] instruments put he among the treasures
[1:06:15] of the house of God and then Solomon
[1:06:17] assembled the elders of Israel and all
[1:06:19] the heads of the tribes the chief of the
[1:06:21] fathers of the children of Israel unto
[1:06:23] Jerusalem to bring up the Ark of the
[1:06:25] Covenant of the Lord out of the City of
[1:06:27] David which is Zion where for all the
[1:06:30] men of Israel assemble themselves unto
[1:06:33] the king and the feast which was in the
[1:06:35] seventh month and all the elders of
[1:06:37] Israel came and the Levites took up the
[1:06:39] ark and they brought up the ark and the
[1:06:42] tabernacle of the congregation and all
[1:06:44] the holy vessels that were in the
[1:06:45] tabernacle these did the priests and the
[1:06:47] Levites bring up and care also King
[1:06:50] Solomon and the congregation of Israel
[1:06:52] that were assembled unto him before the
[1:06:54] ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which
[1:06:56] could not be told nor numbered for
[1:06:58] multitude and the priests brought in the
[1:07:00] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his
[1:07:02] place to the Oracle of the house into
[1:07:04] the most holy place even under the wings
[1:07:06] of the cherubims but the cherubim spread
[1:07:09] forth their wings over the place of the
[1:07:10] Ark and the cherubims covered the Ark
[1:07:12] and the staves thereof above and they
[1:07:15] drew up the staves of the ark and the
[1:07:17] ends of the staves were seen from the
[1:07:18] ark before the Oracle but they were not
[1:07:21] seen without and there it is unto this
[1:07:23] day there was nothing in the ark saved
[1:07:25] the two tab tables which Moses put
[1:07:28] therein at Horeb when the Lord made a
[1:07:30] covenant with of Israel when they came
[1:07:32] out of Egypt and it came to pass when
[1:07:34] the priests were come out of the holy
[1:07:35] place for all the priests that were
[1:07:37] present were sanctified and did not then
[1:07:40] wait by course and also the Levites
[1:07:44] which were the singers all of them of
[1:07:46] Asaph of Heymann jeduthun with their
[1:07:50] sons and their brethren being arrayed in
[1:07:51] white linen having cymbals and
[1:07:53] psalteries and harps stood at the east
[1:07:56] end of the altar and with them in one
[1:07:57] hundred and twenty priests sounding with
[1:07:59] trumpets it must have been quite a scene
[1:08:00] for them to gathered with all of these
[1:08:03] people and musicians and all the
[1:08:05] important people and the elders of
[1:08:06] Israel and it came to pass as the
[1:08:08] trumpets and singers were as one to make
[1:08:10] one sound to be heard in praising and
[1:08:12] thanking the Lord and when they lifted
[1:08:14] up their voice with the trumpets and
[1:08:16] cymbals and instruments and music and
[1:08:18] praise the Lord saying for he is good
[1:08:19] for his mercy endureth forever then the
[1:08:22] house was filled with a cloud
[1:08:23] even the house of the Lord so the
[1:08:26] priests could not stay in the minister
[1:08:28] by reason of the cloud for the glory of
[1:08:30] the Lord had filled the house of God the
[1:08:33] Lord is blessing you may be seated just
[1:08:35] for a moment here I wanted to read this
[1:08:37] little quotation here with you is
[1:08:38] brother Branham finished reading this
[1:08:40] this statement here this passage of
[1:08:43] Scripture you read the whole chapter and
[1:08:47] what I find interesting is that whenever
[1:08:50] whenever we go to do something
[1:08:53] we we prepare ourselves and and we set
[1:08:57] ourselves in a ray just like these
[1:08:59] people did back there and they had a
[1:09:00] great ceremony this was the center of
[1:09:03] worship for all of God's people so all
[1:09:05] of Israel would have been involved or
[1:09:07] affected by this great day that they had
[1:09:09] this was God moving into his tabernacle
[1:09:12] and they made this tabernacle with all
[1:09:16] the expense and all the materials and
[1:09:18] all the expert workmanship that they
[1:09:20] could put into it and they made it as
[1:09:22] good as I can but it didn't matter
[1:09:25] unless God blessed it what really
[1:09:28] mattered is that God came to it and when
[1:09:31] God reached down and said now this and
[1:09:33] your work has done this is mine now and
[1:09:36] when God stepped into it that made the
[1:09:38] difference
[1:09:39] your prayer always should be about this
[1:09:42] church that hey the the work is great
[1:09:44] though you know the facility is nice but
[1:09:47] what you don't want to have is just you
[1:09:49] here you want to make sure that he
[1:09:51] reaches down in every service and takes
[1:09:54] that and says now this is my moment this
[1:09:56] is my time to speak and this is my place
[1:09:59] and I want to breathe my life into it my
[1:10:01] glory into it so that it's not men
[1:10:03] ministering in here anymore it's the
[1:10:05] Holy Spirit speaking to you and that's
[1:10:07] really what you want to have and God is
[1:10:08] interested in doing that here as he was
[1:10:10] back in the days of Solomon back there
[1:10:12] it was a grander bigger building with
[1:10:14] more people but the principle is exactly
[1:10:16] the same that God wants to take this
[1:10:19] place and call it his own and sanctified
[1:10:21] separate it so nothing else goes on here
[1:10:24] but a welcoming spirit for his presence
[1:10:26] and then he can come anytime he wants to
[1:10:28] and speak to your hearts and and give
[1:10:30] you a rapturing faith and give you
[1:10:32] everything you have need of in this hour
[1:10:33] you can answer prayer he can heal bodies
[1:10:35] he can deliver the the the deliverable
[1:10:38] he can heal the broken hearts he can
[1:10:40] restore the joy of the Lord in your life
[1:10:42] he can do all he's an inexhaustible
[1:10:44] fountain of life and if he ever was he
[1:10:47] still is today and God can do that and
[1:10:49] so we should expect that when we come
[1:10:51] and these people wanted God's blessing
[1:10:53] there they did everything meticulously
[1:10:54] and carefully according to God's
[1:10:57] blueprint and that's the way they were
[1:10:58] all instructed and as to exactly what
[1:11:00] they needed to do and when they did it
[1:11:03] they expected God to come and he did and
[1:11:05] it was a glorious scene to behold but it
[1:11:08] was more glorious when he came and fill
[1:11:11] that place with his cloud now brother
[1:11:13] Branham said the Spirit of God and this
[1:11:14] is where you come in now the Spirit of
[1:11:16] God and the people makes the church but
[1:11:19] we also have gathering places dedicated
[1:11:21] with this church gathers together to
[1:11:22] worship God then God has given to our
[1:11:25] precious brother in this congregation
[1:11:26] this most beautiful structure and
[1:11:28] therefore we are here this morning for
[1:11:30] that purpose to dedicate it to be a
[1:11:32] place of worship to the Lord our God the
[1:11:35] temple was ready to be dedicated are you
[1:11:37] ready this morning for dedication
[1:11:40] remember now not only did Israel be
[1:11:43] ready for the dedication of the temple
[1:11:45] but they were dedicating themselves to
[1:11:47] God again when they had come in and this
[1:11:50] pastor here I believe with my heart is a
[1:11:52] man of God and I believe that he stands
[1:11:54] for the principles that God has laid out
[1:11:56] to us and so you see the dedication of a
[1:11:58] church don't only mean coming and saying
[1:12:01] Lord we give you this building but it
[1:12:04] also means Lord we give ourselves to you
[1:12:06] in sacrifice and when Israel had finally
[1:12:10] made one place that they could all dwell
[1:12:12] in came to a place and meet God under
[1:12:15] the fellowship of the blood then they
[1:12:17] begin to sing with joy they begin to
[1:12:18] play the harp they praise with they
[1:12:20] praise God in such one Accord until it
[1:12:23] sounded like one voice singing they had
[1:12:25] they had ceased their wandering they had
[1:12:28] no longer a temporary place of worship
[1:12:30] no more Max's place no more Christian
[1:12:33] science right no more call is's ain't no
[1:12:39] in a simple sense right now they now you
[1:12:42] have a place they they had a place they
[1:12:44] picked up their church and brought it
[1:12:45] with them wherever they went and they
[1:12:47] they brought it for years and hundreds
[1:12:50] of years this is four hundred and
[1:12:52] seventeen years after the exodus that's
[1:12:55] the time span here that we're talking
[1:12:57] about from Solomon's dedication where
[1:12:59] actually when they began the building of
[1:13:01] the church from there back to when Moses
[1:13:03] said let my people go we have 417 years
[1:13:07] and so for those years they actually
[1:13:09] picked up their church and put it on
[1:13:11] their shoulders and walked around with
[1:13:12] it everywhere they went and this day
[1:13:14] that stopped they said this is my place
[1:13:17] God said now you're building in a my
[1:13:19] holy hill this is this is the place that
[1:13:21] I have chosen and and if you go to
[1:13:24] Jerusalem and you stand where the temple
[1:13:26] stood and and of course the the mosque
[1:13:28] is there now but when you go there the
[1:13:31] old ancient Hebrew scholars they believe
[1:13:33] that that's the place that God reached
[1:13:34] them took a handful of dirt and created
[1:13:37] Adam that's where it all began and that
[1:13:39] was God's place and God identified that
[1:13:41] of all the places of the earth he said
[1:13:43] this is my Mountain here and this will
[1:13:45] be called the City of David the city of
[1:13:47] the Great King and I will tell you when
[1:13:48] you're there it's not like any other
[1:13:50] place in the entire world it is a unique
[1:13:52] place and God claimed it as his own and
[1:13:54] now he puts Solomon's Temple right on
[1:13:57] that exact same spot where he where he
[1:14:00] claimed it as himself that also is the
[1:14:02] same spot where Abraham took Isaac up on
[1:14:04] top of the mountain and went to
[1:14:05] sacrifice of exactly many many important
[1:14:08] things happen there but this is where
[1:14:10] God placed the church and placed
[1:14:13] Solomon's Temple and it was the end of
[1:14:15] moving now it was the end of the journey
[1:14:17] for the children of Israel in terms of
[1:14:20] worship now they were sent off in the
[1:14:22] Babylon the people win but the church
[1:14:24] never went when they went in the Babylon
[1:14:26] they never took the tabernacle with him
[1:14:27] right they never took Solomon's
[1:14:29] tabernacle with him when they went to
[1:14:30] Babylon in the days of Jeremiah but for
[1:14:33] the people in terms of worship they had
[1:14:35] been given God's chosen place right this
[1:14:40] was now God's chosen place it was no
[1:14:42] longer the sands of the desert it was
[1:14:44] now God's chosen place of worship and so
[1:14:47] brother Branham said this is not now
[1:14:49] just the dedication of a building but he
[1:14:52] said it's also ourselves and then he
[1:14:54] goes on to say then Solomon stood to
[1:14:55] pray and to mark the dedication to the
[1:14:58] Lord and when he did the ark had already
[1:15:00] been brought in under the wings of the
[1:15:01] cherubim and set back in the holy place
[1:15:03] and when the people but when the people
[1:15:06] dedicated not the church not the
[1:15:08] building but when the people got with
[1:15:10] one Accord and prayed with one Accord
[1:15:12] and sang with one Accord and everything
[1:15:15] was one Accord then the Holy Spirit in
[1:15:18] the form of the pillar fire moved into
[1:15:19] the building and settled into that place
[1:15:21] and it was so much glory in that
[1:15:24] building until the priest couldn't
[1:15:25] minister anymore
[1:15:26] God let it be again and let it come
[1:15:30] again into this little tabernacle
[1:15:33] when I saw that quote I thought this was
[1:15:36] your quote this was your moment here
[1:15:38] because with that's exactly what we want
[1:15:40] to believe that you know in praying a
[1:15:43] prayer dedication and it isn't just it
[1:15:45] isn't just a you know walls and carpet
[1:15:47] it isn't just that it's the church that
[1:15:49] we're dedicating today it's the real
[1:15:51] church that we're dedicating we thank
[1:15:53] God for the place but you know it's only
[1:15:54] a tool that we use right and it ain't
[1:15:56] going no word ain't gonna mean a
[1:15:58] millennium but God's church is what we
[1:16:01] really dedicate here today and I think
[1:16:03] that's a wonderful privilege and
[1:16:04] whenever we do I was like brother
[1:16:06] branham said God let it be again that
[1:16:08] that God would come and breathe his life
[1:16:10] into this place and and
[1:16:12] this would be a different atmosphere and
[1:16:14] a different just just a different time
[1:16:18] that you spend here than anywhere else
[1:16:19] this is not like it is at your house
[1:16:21] it's not like it isn't in the mall it's
[1:16:23] not like it is at your work this is a
[1:16:25] different place and so we want God to
[1:16:27] coming into this tabernacle so if you
[1:16:30] don't mind let's have our brothers come
[1:16:32] our elders here brother Jarrell if you'd
[1:16:34] come brother my condo if you come in and
[1:16:36] why don't we all stand to our feet this
[1:16:38] morning and mark and Bob and here we are
[1:16:41] back again and praying over over this
[1:16:45] place and let's just join our hearts
[1:16:47] together in the word of prayer
[1:16:51] and as we pray I want you to pray as
[1:16:55] well because this is not just the prayer
[1:16:57] over the place now this is the people
[1:16:59] also dedicating themselves to be praying
[1:17:01] and asking God's blessing on our own
[1:17:04] lives in his service so let's pray
[1:17:07] together Heavenly Father we counted a
[1:17:09] privilege together this morning Lord we
[1:17:12] worship you in spirit and in truth O God
[1:17:15] and you have chosen this people to come
[1:17:17] together Lord in the light of the
[1:17:19] revealed word of the hour how we thank
[1:17:21] you for it o God we never would have
[1:17:23] found our way we never would have been
[1:17:25] able to be led in the right path by our
[1:17:27] own thinking and our own mental ability
[1:17:29] but Lord Jesus you predestinated us to
[1:17:32] see this great light in the last day and
[1:17:34] to walk in that light and to believe
[1:17:36] your word and I believe this truth Lord
[1:17:37] that you've given to us we steadfastly
[1:17:40] hold in in our hearts O God we waver not
[1:17:42] from it by your grace and we stand here
[1:17:45] together today Lord and and father many
[1:17:48] memories and many years gone by but Lord
[1:17:51] Jesus we just dedicate this building to
[1:17:54] you today may it be a lighthouse Lord
[1:17:56] may it be a place where your Holy Spirit
[1:17:58] is always welcome may it be a place Lord
[1:18:00] with a sojourner in the sinner and those
[1:18:03] that are in need of help and deliverance
[1:18:05] they may come Lord through these doors
[1:18:06] and they may sense your presence I pray
[1:18:09] that father the preaching of the word
[1:18:11] may always continue here Lord to be a
[1:18:13] blessing to the people Heavenly Father
[1:18:15] we just ask that you would just breathe
[1:18:17] your life into this place and it Lord
[1:18:19] your presence would come and just take
[1:18:21] control of these services that are be
[1:18:24] held in this big building and father God
[1:18:26] we ourselves as a Church of the Living
[1:18:28] God we stand before you today and we
[1:18:30] consecrate our lives to you afresh we
[1:18:32] dedicate our hearts and our minds to you
[1:18:34] and ask and pray that your Holy Spirit
[1:18:36] would come and anoint us O God that we
[1:18:38] might not only just enter into the word
[1:18:40] of the Lord whenever it comes but Lord
[1:18:42] our lives might be living written
[1:18:45] epistles known of all men and people in
[1:18:47] this community Lord they might see us
[1:18:49] they might they might recognize that
[1:18:51] there's something different about each
[1:18:53] one lord I pray even these young people
[1:18:55] that are here energize their lives Lord
[1:18:57] teach them I pray and mold them and
[1:18:59] shape them in the atmosphere of the Holy
[1:19:01] Spirit Lord come I pray and breathe life
[1:19:04] into this place and breathe life afresh
[1:19:06] into our hearts we commit ourselves to
[1:19:09] you Lord we dedicate ourselves to you
[1:19:10] and thank you dear God for this
[1:19:12] opportunity we have to ask your blessing
[1:19:14] upon all that's done all who labored
[1:19:17] Lord all who gave and all who
[1:19:18] contributed Lord to this building today
[1:19:21] we thank you for it may it be a hallowed
[1:19:24] sanctified separate place we give it all
[1:19:26] to you Lord and we give ourselves to you
[1:19:28] afresh in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:19:30] pray
[1:19:32] amen and amen thank you Jesus thank you
[1:19:36] Lord Jesus thank you brother
[1:19:38] thank you Jesus
[1:19:42] wonderful
[1:19:49] should have had you remain standing if
[1:19:51] you don't mind let's do it again first
[1:19:52] Kings chapter 6
[1:19:57] trust you can see this ok we're gonna
[1:19:59] use this here this morning first Kings
[1:20:02] chapter 6 I want to read two places here
[1:20:04] in the in the Bible and now we're gonna
[1:20:08] go backwards just a little bit to the
[1:20:10] preamble to the building of Solomon's
[1:20:12] Temple here
[1:20:14] and this is an amazing story if you go
[1:20:17] back you can find it in chronicles you
[1:20:19] can also find it in Kings there it
[1:20:20] starts in first Kings chapter 5 when
[1:20:23] Hiram comes in on the scene and he's
[1:20:25] involved in the building and the
[1:20:27] materials for this building is what I
[1:20:29] want to focus on this morning here just
[1:20:31] for a little while and I will I will ask
[1:20:34] you to do two things first of all
[1:20:35] forgive me for this being strikingly
[1:20:38] this is going to be simple and many
[1:20:42] times when somebody asked me to speak at
[1:20:44] a place you know I always I always you
[1:20:46] know you just begin to pray in your
[1:20:48] search and you wonder what it is that
[1:20:50] you could say to the people I always do
[1:20:51] that I'm ministers do that but when when
[1:20:54] mark conveyed the request from brother
[1:20:57] Gerald to minister here I immediately
[1:21:00] knew this just dropped right in my heart
[1:21:02] and I knew right from there this was the
[1:21:03] right thing for me to do and so I just
[1:21:06] trust it'll be a blessing to you and
[1:21:07] then the second thing I want you to do
[1:21:09] is forget it's me all right so all you
[1:21:11] family members I need you to forget it's
[1:21:13] me just for a moment here all right Paul
[1:21:16] and just concentrate on what it is that
[1:21:19] said here because this is a even though
[1:21:21] it's a an alarmingly simple thought
[1:21:26] this is a real blessing when you think
[1:21:28] about it all right so let's just let's
[1:21:30] just focus on God's Word now for a
[1:21:32] little bit in first Kings chapter 6 and
[1:21:35] verse 7
[1:21:38] the Bible says in the house when it was
[1:21:41] in building
[1:21:43] was built of stone made ready before it
[1:21:48] was brought hither
[1:21:50] when it was in building now that's us
[1:21:53] isn't it because we're not there yet
[1:21:55] we're not for God's not finished with us
[1:21:57] yet he's still working on me so we're
[1:22:00] still in building we're still in
[1:22:02] formation if you like God is still
[1:22:05] molding us in shaping us but the stone
[1:22:08] was made ready ready before it was
[1:22:12] placed before it was brought hither so
[1:22:15] before it found its place that stone was
[1:22:18] worked on and it was made perfect before
[1:22:21] it actually was dropped in the slot
[1:22:23] designed for it okay so that there was
[1:22:27] neither hammer nor axe or any tool of
[1:22:31] iron heard in the house heard in the
[1:22:34] church while it was in building
[1:22:38] proverbs chapter 24 verse 27 you're
[1:22:41] welcome to read with me here
[1:22:43] Solomon wrote prepare thy work without
[1:22:45] and make it fit for thyself in the field
[1:22:49] and
[1:22:50] afterwards
[1:22:52] build on house do your work first then
[1:22:55] build your house
[1:22:56] may the Lord at his blessing you may be
[1:22:59] seated
[1:23:00] now recently I was doing a little series
[1:23:03] the back home on the subject of success
[1:23:05] and I on Wednesday nights and we've been
[1:23:07] talking about this scripture here
[1:23:08] because this actually proverbs 24 27 is
[1:23:11] the scriptural design for a man to have
[1:23:15] his own house and what Solomon is
[1:23:18] actually saying to the people here is
[1:23:20] that
[1:23:20] rather than for a young man you know
[1:23:23] maybe he gets married and leaves his
[1:23:25] father's house and he wants to go and
[1:23:27] have this great big mansion of a house
[1:23:29] he wants to have a big fancy house he's
[1:23:31] he's better off the instruction by
[1:23:33] Solomon is to prepare your trade without
[1:23:37] in the field go out in the field and
[1:23:40] make yourself established or successful
[1:23:42] in the field and save for a down payment
[1:23:46] on that house so that you're not
[1:23:48] burdened by a lot of debt and then buy
[1:23:52] your house that's actually what
[1:23:54] Solomon's wisdom is all about and this
[1:23:56] is a great study in itself but but
[1:23:58] that's what he's saying there's
[1:24:00] preparation that needs to go into the
[1:24:02] building of a house don't just go out
[1:24:03] and and assume that it's all going to
[1:24:06] come together you have to think about
[1:24:07] this and you got to pray about this and
[1:24:08] you've got a you've got to work in your
[1:24:10] field you have to work in your trade you
[1:24:12] have to work in your with your hands and
[1:24:14] the gifts that God's giving it and make
[1:24:16] it fit for thyself in thy field just
[1:24:19] like brother Joel over here he's he's as
[1:24:21] an example here he's worked hard and
[1:24:23] built that business from the incubator
[1:24:25] up there at Mun and built it up a little
[1:24:27] bit to the point where now it was a
[1:24:28] little easier for him to tackle the new
[1:24:31] house that he's built and the deck
[1:24:33] attached to it
[1:24:35] so Joe admittedly now it would have been
[1:24:39] hard for you to have done that in first
[1:24:41] year business right it would have been
[1:24:43] very hard because it was not enough
[1:24:44] established there but now it's a little
[1:24:46] easier you know for him to do that you
[1:24:48] understand the principle here that a lot
[1:24:51] of people in our culture they feel like
[1:24:52] I can have whatever ever any way
[1:24:54] everybody else has I can have a nice
[1:24:56] house because mom and dad have a nice
[1:24:58] house hey they've probably had 30 years
[1:24:59] working on this house and paying for it
[1:25:02] moving from you know moving up moving up
[1:25:03] and and that's what Solomon is saying
[1:25:05] that there's a there's a right principle
[1:25:08] in planning so that it all comes later
[1:25:11] on but there's a work that's to be done
[1:25:13] before we get there okay so that's where
[1:25:15] our title comes from this morning
[1:25:17] prepare thy work and build on house now
[1:25:19] let's take a look at it now for a moment
[1:25:21] to give you a couple of statements here
[1:25:22] just to get your thinking together
[1:25:23] brother Ram said I think when Solomon
[1:25:26] built the first temple it was cut out
[1:25:27] from all over the world all over their
[1:25:30] world back in that time shipped in they
[1:25:33] sailed some of those materials in on the
[1:25:36] Mediterranean Sea they floated some down
[1:25:38] on rivers they mined some there recently
[1:25:40] just like in the last year or so they
[1:25:43] found a quarry near the the mountain
[1:25:46] where the Solomon's Temple was actually
[1:25:47] built the uncovered this place and they
[1:25:49] figured it had to be a quarry so there
[1:25:51] was material brought from very close and
[1:25:53] there was materials brought from afar
[1:25:55] like brother man saying right here the
[1:25:57] Cedars of Lebanon floated down to Joppa
[1:26:00] Chiapas on the coast line and they
[1:26:02] hauled him in by ox cart it was so
[1:26:04] masterly built that when the temple went
[1:26:06] together it had all kinds of
[1:26:09] funny-looking stones in it hello
[1:26:13] it had all kinds of funny-looking stones
[1:26:16] in it so when they brought the materials
[1:26:18] now the materials were already completed
[1:26:21] they were already shaped they didn't
[1:26:23] have mills set up they didn't have rock
[1:26:25] crusher set up there it was all done so
[1:26:28] all these funny-looking stones now came
[1:26:31] and they were delivered right to the
[1:26:33] site but when they began to read the
[1:26:34] blueprint it was all in the blueprint
[1:26:36] and there wasn't even a buzz of a saw or
[1:26:39] a sound of a hammer for 40 years in
[1:26:42] building the temple and I think the way
[1:26:44] God's got his people all cut out I think
[1:26:48] that's the way that God's got his people
[1:26:51] all cut out so here's brother branham
[1:26:54] now he's looking back at the building of
[1:26:56] that temple and he's applying that to
[1:26:58] our time he sees there's a pattern here
[1:27:00] and he said one's got a nature of one
[1:27:02] kind and one is another he says but
[1:27:04] they're all Christians they're fitted
[1:27:06] stones joined together upon the chief
[1:27:08] Cornerstone Jesus Christ
[1:27:11] so we know that God doesn't have has
[1:27:14] earlie do anything the design or the
[1:27:16] process by which Solomon built this
[1:27:18] temple was consistent with the way that
[1:27:21] God deals with these people and I want
[1:27:24] to say this this morning that many times
[1:27:25] there's there's III observe in people
[1:27:28] over the years especially is you know in
[1:27:31] the pain the pastoral role you you
[1:27:33] notice people get stalled on the process
[1:27:37] the way that God deals with us as
[1:27:40] individuals there's a process there's a
[1:27:42] reason why certain things happen to you
[1:27:45] there's a reason why certain calamities
[1:27:47] come your way does the reason why
[1:27:49] certain occupations are natural to you
[1:27:51] there's a reason why that you have a you
[1:27:54] know an aptitude towards certain things
[1:27:56] you know there's there's a reason why
[1:27:58] God's made you like he's made you and
[1:28:00] when he called you when he called you
[1:28:02] you are not where you are now
[1:28:05] spiritually you were not where you are
[1:28:07] now right when and when God called you
[1:28:10] when God called you you were still
[1:28:12] debating about the simple things of the
[1:28:14] world whether you could continue to do
[1:28:16] those things and whether you know what
[1:28:17] part of you we're all worship did you
[1:28:19] need to let go and so a lot of that is
[1:28:21] gone now and God is still dealing with
[1:28:24] us according to his word we're still
[1:28:25] growing and we're still we're still
[1:28:27] developing spiritually isn't that right
[1:28:29] growing up in faith and growing up in
[1:28:32] strength and grace and all knowledge and
[1:28:34] all the other things that God gives to
[1:28:35] us and and brother BAM saying that the
[1:28:38] same way that Solomon planned all this
[1:28:40] so that when all of these materials came
[1:28:43] together it became a complete unit and
[1:28:45] every one of them had a specific and
[1:28:47] designated spot ordained by that person
[1:28:51] whoever he was who drew that blueprint
[1:28:54] somebody had to have a mind to be able
[1:28:57] to draw and construct that that that
[1:28:59] Temple in his own mind and then convey
[1:29:02] it to paper and
[1:29:03] give it to the 3300 managers who were on
[1:29:06] the site there were 3300 managers you
[1:29:10] can see him there you read it in the
[1:29:12] Bible in the in the in the preceding
[1:29:13] chapters there that we read and they had
[1:29:16] they had 70,000 burden bearers they had
[1:29:19] 40,000 stone cores who were scattered
[1:29:23] out where all these stones were being
[1:29:24] dug they had a multitude of workers out
[1:29:26] there but somebody in the beginning had
[1:29:29] to catch the vision of this temple and
[1:29:31] find out hey not just any temple but the
[1:29:35] Lord how do you want me to construct
[1:29:37] this temple how do you want me to build
[1:29:40] this one is what does God's house look
[1:29:42] like he had Solomon had to sit down and
[1:29:46] say what does God's house look like what
[1:29:49] what way can we build this and it had to
[1:29:51] be conveyed on the paper which is the
[1:29:53] blueprint and the blueprint went out and
[1:29:55] everybody operated according to the same
[1:29:58] blueprint
[1:29:59] we understand that God has also given us
[1:30:03] a blueprint isn't that right and he sent
[1:30:05] the blueprint out everybody's got to
[1:30:07] copy the same one I assume right so
[1:30:10] there's not a different version of the
[1:30:12] blueprint you know here and another one
[1:30:14] there and another one in Africa and
[1:30:15] another one over here and in the US the
[1:30:18] blueprint is identical and so the
[1:30:21] building instructions don't vary they're
[1:30:23] the same wherever you go
[1:30:25] the one who drew that blueprint and the
[1:30:28] blueprint itself becomes very valuable
[1:30:30] to us because we all operate in
[1:30:33] different parts of the world without
[1:30:34] communicating with one another we're all
[1:30:36] being molded or shaped by the plan that
[1:30:38] God has given to us right
[1:30:41] I've got a smart isn't he let's take a
[1:30:44] look now for a moment we'd have to
[1:30:46] assume then it would look something like
[1:30:47] this it would have we would have to
[1:30:49] assume that this is not Jerusalem this
[1:30:52] is not the mountain where Solomon's
[1:30:54] Temple sits but this is where the work
[1:30:56] went up this is where it all happened
[1:30:58] folks this is where the sound of the
[1:31:00] hammer was and the saws and the and the
[1:31:03] people laboring and how they would move
[1:31:05] those great stones around you can see
[1:31:07] the the sheer sides that I could step
[1:31:10] cliff there as they come down and they
[1:31:12] would they would somehow or another
[1:31:13] drill down in those things they would
[1:31:15] let a slab fall and they will cut it
[1:31:18] into smaller slabs so they can move it
[1:31:19] and and this was painstaking sweaty
[1:31:22] difficult work to make these stones into
[1:31:25] these sizes here and then they probably
[1:31:28] would have took the blueprint out and
[1:31:29] said all right we need 70 blocks this
[1:31:30] size well let's let's count out 7/8 and
[1:31:33] work on those 70 lay on the side and
[1:31:35] only need 80 blocks that are this side
[1:31:37] would what with you know 8 sides that
[1:31:41] are that are in this rectangle but one
[1:31:43] of them's got to be angled a little bit
[1:31:44] so they'd separate those and I mean
[1:31:46] that's where they did this work this
[1:31:47] work was done in the field
[1:31:50] it was done in the field so yeah this is
[1:31:54] not this is not Solomon's Corey's here
[1:31:57] but this is a quarry where this work is
[1:32:00] being done so we just assumed here give
[1:32:02] me a little the scriptural license here
[1:32:05] this is a this is what it would probably
[1:32:09] have looked like something like this
[1:32:10] except it would have been populated by
[1:32:12] thousands of laborers who would have
[1:32:15] been working on these stones thank God
[1:32:17] for the laborers who got all these
[1:32:18] stones ready
[1:32:21] now where did this idea come that
[1:32:24] Solomon pulled out where he said is
[1:32:26] gonna be no work done on site why would
[1:32:28] that be done because at one sense it to
[1:32:30] be easier just to ship raw materials
[1:32:32] there and let everybody do it and so
[1:32:33] they could look at the spot in other
[1:32:35] words if there was a you know if there
[1:32:37] was a piece of equipment or a block that
[1:32:39] needed to go right here on the wall
[1:32:40] wouldn't it be better for the man to go
[1:32:42] like this and make the measurements here
[1:32:44] and and and do it right here and fit it
[1:32:46] and they do it right here why what's the
[1:32:48] issue why why would that be so I think
[1:32:51] about things like that so I went back
[1:32:54] and I looked in the scripture to look at
[1:32:55] Deuteronomy chapter 17 for a moment here
[1:32:57] here's a principle that's very important
[1:33:00] moses is speaking here and he's telling
[1:33:02] the people who are not in the promised
[1:33:04] land yet he's telling them when thou art
[1:33:06] coming to the land which the LORD thy
[1:33:08] God giveth thee and shall possess it and
[1:33:11] shall dwell therein and shall say I will
[1:33:13] set a king over me like as all the
[1:33:16] nations that are about me thou shalt in
[1:33:19] it now there's been no king right
[1:33:21] there's been no king yet this is under
[1:33:23] Moses ministry and then Joshua becoming
[1:33:25] the judges would come we're a long way
[1:33:27] away from Saul we're a long way away
[1:33:29] from King Saul no talk of a king yet but
[1:33:32] God knows is going to come a David later
[1:33:34] on right God knows because he knows the
[1:33:37] end from the beginning he knows the
[1:33:38] future as well as the present the past
[1:33:39] right you with me so God speaking about
[1:33:43] a king he's given instructions to a king
[1:33:44] here and there's been no talk of a king
[1:33:46] so far God is projecting way out here
[1:33:49] for when Kings King David would sit on
[1:33:52] the throne and he says thou shalt in no
[1:33:54] wise thou shalt in any wise said him
[1:33:56] king over thee whom the LORD thy God
[1:33:58] shall choose one from among thy brethren
[1:34:01] shalt thou set the king over thee thou
[1:34:03] mayest not set a stranger over thee
[1:34:05] which is not thy brother but he shall
[1:34:07] not multiply horses to himself nor cause
[1:34:09] the people to return to Egypt to the end
[1:34:11] that he should multiply horses for as
[1:34:13] much as the Lord has said he shall
[1:34:15] henceforth return no more that way these
[1:34:17] are instructions now that God was given
[1:34:19] to a future king all right that's read
[1:34:21] on now just a little bit further in the
[1:34:23] same passage neither shall he multiply
[1:34:24] wives to himself that his heart turned
[1:34:27] not away hmm neither shall he greatly
[1:34:30] multiplied to himself silver and gold
[1:34:32] and it shall be when he sitteth upon the
[1:34:34] throne of his kingdom that he shall
[1:34:36] write him a copy of this law in a book
[1:34:38] out of that which is before the priests
[1:34:40] and levites to get it a future king had
[1:34:45] to take time to take the first five
[1:34:47] books of the Bible and he had to write
[1:34:49] him out in his own book his own journal
[1:34:51] and he had to write out all the words
[1:34:54] that were already written out on the
[1:34:55] scroll he had to write it out for
[1:34:57] himself because and it shall be with him
[1:34:59] verse 19 he shall read therein all the
[1:35:01] days of his life that he may learn to
[1:35:04] fear the Lord his God to keep all the
[1:35:07] words of this law and these statutes and
[1:35:08] to do them because we're not ever
[1:35:11] required just to be a hearer or a writer
[1:35:13] of the word were to be a doer of the
[1:35:15] word so God wanted this king as the
[1:35:18] first act of his official office to take
[1:35:21] his pen and write out the first five
[1:35:23] books of the the law of Moses there so
[1:35:26] that he would learn by his own
[1:35:28] handwriting what God required of him
[1:35:30] what were the commandments what were the
[1:35:32] precepts what did God really intend to
[1:35:34] write out the book of Genesis I actually
[1:35:36] think it would be a great exercise to
[1:35:37] write out the book of Genesis because
[1:35:39] you would understand it differently than
[1:35:40] if you just read it I mean I I just
[1:35:42] think it to be a good thing but now
[1:35:44] here's God God's point he said in verse
[1:35:46] 20 that his heart be not lifted up among
[1:35:49] his above his brethren and then he
[1:35:51] turned not aside from the commandment to
[1:35:52] the right hand or to the left to the end
[1:35:54] that he may prolong these days in his
[1:35:56] kingdom he and his children in the midst
[1:35:58] of Israel so God wanted any king who
[1:36:02] took office to do this first so that he
[1:36:04] would be reminded that I am NOT V King I
[1:36:07] am aching but he is the king and I am
[1:36:12] here by His grace and he's the one who
[1:36:14] controls it all right and God wanted the
[1:36:17] Kings to know that and he never wanted
[1:36:19] them to consider themselves to be way up
[1:36:21] here and some great person here there's
[1:36:23] no big guys right there's no big guys
[1:36:25] there's there's we're all really at the
[1:36:27] end of the day we're all stones that are
[1:36:29] shaped in this in this temple every one
[1:36:32] of us have our place in the temple here
[1:36:33] and so this is the principle now that we
[1:36:36] find in the book of Deuteronomy well
[1:36:37] then if that's true then we can also
[1:36:39] assume this that Solomon when he sat on
[1:36:43] the throne he would have wrote this out
[1:36:44] and Moses with the elders of Israel
[1:36:48] commanded the people saying keep all the
[1:36:50] commandments which I command you this
[1:36:51] day and it shall be on the day when he
[1:36:54] shall pass over Jordan unto the land
[1:36:55] which the LORD thy God giveth thee and
[1:36:58] thou shalt set thee up great stones and
[1:37:00] plaster them a plaster which is a paint
[1:37:02] it's a very light paint that they would
[1:37:05] have painted over that to mark it and
[1:37:06] thou shalt write upon them all the words
[1:37:08] of this law when now are passed over
[1:37:10] that thou mayst go unto the land which
[1:37:13] the LORD thy God giveth thee a land that
[1:37:15] floweth with milk and honey as the Lord
[1:37:17] God of thy father says promise thee so
[1:37:18] this is a prophecy when you go into the
[1:37:22] land and
[1:37:23] they're going to go into the land now
[1:37:25] under Joshua are gonna be placed in the
[1:37:27] land there and when you do this this is
[1:37:29] the way I want you to build this altar
[1:37:30] and I want you to paint it with this
[1:37:31] white paint here plaster it with plaster
[1:37:33] and therefore it shall be verse 4 when
[1:37:36] you've gone over Jordan that you shall
[1:37:38] set up these stones which I command you
[1:37:39] this day and Mount Ebal and thou shalt
[1:37:42] plaster them a plaster and there there
[1:37:45] shalt I'll build an altar unto the Lord
[1:37:47] thy God and altar of stones and thou
[1:37:49] shalt not lift up any iron tool upon
[1:37:51] them
[1:37:53] so we assume now that Solomon would have
[1:37:56] read when he wrote out the first five
[1:37:58] books that he was commanded to write out
[1:37:59] right so therefore when he says that
[1:38:02] we're going to have all of these stones
[1:38:03] come in and all this material come in
[1:38:05] for the temple we're not going to lift
[1:38:07] up any iron tool against those stones
[1:38:09] here in the temple because God wants the
[1:38:11] work done in the field okay
[1:38:14] so this is the way now that it was in
[1:38:17] this is not just a random thing that
[1:38:19] Solomon says I don't like the noise it
[1:38:20] makes me nervous had nothing to do with
[1:38:21] that he was following the inspiration
[1:38:24] that was given here by Moses before they
[1:38:26] crossed Jordan and came into the land
[1:38:27] okay now we find this as well over here
[1:38:31] in Joshua and Joshua built an altar unto
[1:38:33] the Lord God of Israel to Mount Ebal as
[1:38:35] Moses the servant of the lord commanded
[1:38:37] the children of Israel as it is written
[1:38:38] in the book of the law of Moses an altar
[1:38:40] of whole stones which are perfect stones
[1:38:42] over which no man hath lift up any iron
[1:38:45] so when they cross the river Jordan they
[1:38:48] took out these stones perfect stones and
[1:38:49] nobody could work on these stones there
[1:38:53] where they were building the altar they
[1:38:54] offered their own burnt offerings unto
[1:38:56] the Lord and sacrifice peace offerings
[1:38:58] watch and he wrote there upon the stones
[1:39:02] they were not shaped now but what God
[1:39:06] wanted was and what Joshua did he wrote
[1:39:09] there upon the stones a copy of the law
[1:39:11] of Moses which he wrote in the presence
[1:39:13] of the children of Israel so the only
[1:39:16] thing now that was ever written on the
[1:39:18] stones of one of God's memorials was his
[1:39:22] own word
[1:39:23] God wanted the word itched in stone on
[1:39:27] this memorial do you understand that and
[1:39:31] I don't know this is not the River
[1:39:32] Jordan here but the River Jordan is very
[1:39:34] small if you've ever seen it and it's
[1:39:36] surprisingly small but when they came
[1:39:37] out of the River Jordan and they stacked
[1:39:39] these twelve stones up one for each
[1:39:41] tribe of Israel Joshua actually carved
[1:39:44] on on those stones and it would not have
[1:39:46] written the entire five books now
[1:39:48] because I would have taken quite a small
[1:39:50] chisel and a big stone but he would have
[1:39:53] written symbols which indicated that
[1:39:55] this was God's law that was given to the
[1:39:58] children of Israel by Moses and he wrote
[1:40:00] that in the presence of the children of
[1:40:01] Israel so he would have he would have
[1:40:02] worked on this this stone here and
[1:40:04] scribed this this is the only thing that
[1:40:07] God wanted scribed on these stones
[1:40:10] was his own word are you following me
[1:40:12] are you thinking spiritual right we
[1:40:14] don't need to linger long on these types
[1:40:15] here that in God's process of working
[1:40:19] with you the only thing he really wants
[1:40:22] impressed on you that is irreversible
[1:40:25] and not erasable at all is God's word
[1:40:30] listen folks when brother Branham held
[1:40:33] his services the way he did he was doing
[1:40:36] it a little bit differently than many
[1:40:38] other
[1:40:39] ministers and and leaders back in his
[1:40:42] time Billy Sunday ran his services quite
[1:40:45] differently if you read the story Billy
[1:40:46] Sunday and Spurgeon read his services
[1:40:48] ran his services a little bit
[1:40:50] differently and Martin Luther certainly
[1:40:52] did and John Wesley did they all had
[1:40:54] their own way when brother Branham came
[1:40:56] along he wanted to simplify these
[1:40:58] services and he said you know so many
[1:41:00] just so many songs don't drag it out you
[1:41:02] don't don't have people get up and talk
[1:41:04] from the audience just write down to
[1:41:05] prayer requests and give it out to the
[1:41:07] people have the song leader control that
[1:41:09] and you know don't wait don't we read
[1:41:11] the memory him saying then and and then
[1:41:14] he says you don't take up your offering
[1:41:16] don't don't linger you don't need to
[1:41:17] press the people and shake everybody for
[1:41:19] $100 bill he said you know just take up
[1:41:21] the offering and move on he said the
[1:41:23] important thing is the word he said
[1:41:24] bring the word out and he says give
[1:41:26] plenty of time for the word and he
[1:41:27] didn't want anybody interrupting the
[1:41:29] service with the gifts you know people
[1:41:31] jumping up like Pentecost right you know
[1:41:33] and he set that in order he was you
[1:41:35] don't want he did then do you have any
[1:41:37] idea of why brother Branham did it that
[1:41:38] way I mean he was he seemed like he was
[1:41:41] very calculated in the way he said his
[1:41:43] service up but a random said the reason
[1:41:45] I do this is because the angel told me
[1:41:48] do it this way
[1:41:49] that's why he did it because the angel
[1:41:52] came to him and said when you run your
[1:41:54] services run them this way you can fire
[1:41:57] had time I could find you the cold here
[1:41:59] and brother Branham said that's why I do
[1:42:01] things the way that I do because this
[1:42:03] setup is pleasing to the Lord well hey
[1:42:07] to me that's a good model for us to
[1:42:09] model ourselves after right this is not
[1:42:12] about the offering it's not about the
[1:42:13] singers it's not about the music it's
[1:42:15] not about the pews it's not about the
[1:42:16] building it's about the word that comes
[1:42:18] forth let that be the important part of
[1:42:21] every service let that be stun my heart
[1:42:24] not my career not my money not my looks
[1:42:26] not my youth not anything else let the
[1:42:28] word be etched on my heart let
[1:42:30] everything else comes second place to
[1:42:32] that if there's one thing I'm gonna
[1:42:34] leave with here let it be the Word of
[1:42:37] God that's impressed on my heart let it
[1:42:38] be chisel in my heart and that's the
[1:42:41] idea that's being conveyed here but
[1:42:43] remember now this wasn't the the the
[1:42:45] work was not done in the field this was
[1:42:47] a temporary altar that they set up as a
[1:42:49] memorial when they came through in the
[1:42:51] children of Israel but this idea of not
[1:42:53] having iron there and that in the church
[1:42:55] heaven has work done here an iron is a
[1:42:57] material that normally is used as a
[1:42:59] weapon
[1:43:01] whenever they fought enemies and they
[1:43:04] were able to they were able to
[1:43:07] confiscate a forge back in those days
[1:43:10] that was a very precious thing because
[1:43:12] you needed a Forge to to shape metal
[1:43:15] weapons lot of stones right out of iron
[1:43:18] that you iron or that you took out of
[1:43:20] the ground you needed a forge in order
[1:43:21] to make yourself weapons of war and so
[1:43:24] iron is considered a tool or a weapon of
[1:43:27] war made by man and
[1:43:29] God didn't want that in Solomon's Temple
[1:43:34] all right let's go on let's read on now
[1:43:37] I think so when Solomon built the first
[1:43:39] temple I'm being repetitive here now he
[1:43:42] says when he built the first temple it
[1:43:43] was cut out from all over the world
[1:43:44] shipped in this is the same quote and it
[1:43:46] was so masterly built that when the
[1:43:47] temple went together it had all kinds of
[1:43:49] little funny-looking stones in it I'm
[1:43:50] back at that same quote okay and I came
[1:43:53] back to it for this line but when they
[1:43:55] began to read the blueprint it was all
[1:43:57] in the blueprint
[1:43:59] so all of this work that went on now was
[1:44:02] not just a loose bunch of activity out
[1:44:06] there and hoping this thing will fit
[1:44:07] this blueprint mattered to everybody
[1:44:11] this mattered everybody because if they
[1:44:14] didn't do it by the blueprint it had to
[1:44:15] go back out to the quarry again and it
[1:44:18] had to be worked on and then it had to
[1:44:19] be brought back in again now brother
[1:44:21] Branham talked a lot about this
[1:44:23] blueprint idea and he talked about the
[1:44:24] Word of God being the blueprint we know
[1:44:26] that one time if you if you follow this
[1:44:28] in the message their brotherly veil was
[1:44:31] talking with brother Branham late at
[1:44:33] night there were heaven cornbread and
[1:44:35] buttermilk
[1:44:36] late at night and I seen all the
[1:44:41] non-americans look at that and go
[1:44:43] horrible and I'm with you there I'm with
[1:44:47] you there but my wife she looks at me
[1:44:49] says oh you know that's that's eaten a
[1:44:51] dragon no but brother Vale and and his
[1:44:55] sister brother Vale and brother branham
[1:44:57] were sitting in the kitchen they had
[1:44:58] cornbread and buttermilk there they sent
[1:45:00] their wives to bed they were up sitting
[1:45:02] late and leave al was debating brother
[1:45:04] branham on baptism and the right way to
[1:45:05] be baptized and brother branham was
[1:45:08] going back and forth with him you know
[1:45:09] when talking about it and brother Vale
[1:45:10] went to bed and had a dream and the next
[1:45:12] morning he got up and he said brother
[1:45:14] branham I had a dream and he said what
[1:45:15] was the dream about he said well he said
[1:45:17] I was building this house and this man
[1:45:19] wanted me to build this fancy nice place
[1:45:21] for him and I built it and when the man
[1:45:23] looked around he said no good he said
[1:45:25] tear it down and build it according to
[1:45:27] the blueprint he said when it came to
[1:45:29] the payday he said the man refused to
[1:45:31] pay he would not he would not accept the
[1:45:32] work that I had done for him and he said
[1:45:34] he gave it back to me and said tear it
[1:45:35] down and do it again and he said brother
[1:45:37] bill he said I don't want to come down
[1:45:40] to the river and have it done wrong
[1:45:43] and he said I can see the blueprint
[1:45:45] tells me to do it a certain way and
[1:45:47] brother branham said he said there's
[1:45:49] water out here let's go do it and they
[1:45:51] went out and got baptized that morning
[1:45:52] and leave al was baptized that way now
[1:45:54] brother branham said many things and
[1:45:56] you'll be familiar with this here just
[1:45:58] very briefly in 1965 in the rapture
[1:46:00] brother Branham was signaling to us here
[1:46:03] that we're at a corner in the in the
[1:46:05] dispensation of the Gentiles being near
[1:46:08] the end and the top of the pyramid here
[1:46:10] there are lots more turns and
[1:46:13] critical events than here this went on
[1:46:18] for a long time these dark ages went on
[1:46:20] for a long time hundreds and hundreds of
[1:46:23] years but in the last of it this section
[1:46:25] here required I mean obviously you had
[1:46:28] to have a stonemason to lay the
[1:46:29] foundation of this thing but you had to
[1:46:31] have a very carefully trained person to
[1:46:34] get you here
[1:46:36] everybody was following the pattern and
[1:46:39] brother Branham had to as well but this
[1:46:41] required some pretty important
[1:46:43] navigation if you like in the
[1:46:44] construction of this building right so
[1:46:46] brother Branham says we're at a corner
[1:46:48] in 1965 he says we're at a corner and
[1:46:50] it's easy a brick mason he turns a
[1:46:52] corner he said start everybody starts
[1:46:54] laying down bricks the same way same
[1:46:56] roll a certain denomination starts and
[1:46:58] they start rolling down the roll he said
[1:47:00] it's all right but when you get to them
[1:47:01] turns he said you got to turn back the
[1:47:03] other way
[1:47:04] he says now God is not building a wall
[1:47:07] he's building a house and there's many
[1:47:10] cuts and turns that he's predicted here
[1:47:12] in the Bible and the turns anybody could
[1:47:14] try to make a turn but it must be
[1:47:17] according to the blueprint or it's got
[1:47:19] to be torn down again so
[1:47:22] when Billy ran him restored baptism and
[1:47:25] when brother Brandon brought the
[1:47:26] ordinances in and when brother Branham
[1:47:27] opened up the seals and saw how how
[1:47:30] without any any preconceived idea about
[1:47:33] the seal as a matter of fact all of his
[1:47:34] preconceived ideas were wrong about the
[1:47:37] seals he said he was going out with
[1:47:39] Smith and Larkin and all the other ones
[1:47:42] there that idea and he was wrong about
[1:47:44] that so he had no preconceived idea the
[1:47:46] Holy Spirit came right to him in that
[1:47:48] room and gave him the understanding of
[1:47:50] each seal and he saw how it fit with the
[1:47:53] blueprint the entire blueprint he knew
[1:47:55] he was on the money he knew he was right
[1:47:57] and as a matter of fact when he got
[1:48:00] translated beyond the curtain of time he
[1:48:02] went over there and said where's Paul
[1:48:03] and he said Paul's you know what it a
[1:48:05] little bit of a different place over
[1:48:07] here and he said but Paul made it yes
[1:48:09] Paul made it well hey if Paul made it
[1:48:11] we're gonna make it because we got the
[1:48:13] same blueprint
[1:48:14] Paul had the same blueprint that we've
[1:48:17] got here and a Paul native how can we go
[1:48:19] wrong if we follow this blueprint and
[1:48:21] that's why brother Branham couldn't be
[1:48:23] talked out of the blueprint that God had
[1:48:25] opened up to him right so this blueprint
[1:48:29] now becomes very important it's very
[1:48:30] valuable because all of these workers
[1:48:32] back in Solomon's day they didn't text
[1:48:36] and they didn't email they didn't
[1:48:38] communicate hardly at all because one
[1:48:40] was in timber and one was in stone and
[1:48:42] one was in you know different kinds of
[1:48:45] materials that they had in the temple
[1:48:46] the the people who shaped the gold and
[1:48:48] the silver and the vessels and the
[1:48:50] garments and all of that it all had to
[1:48:52] be done according to this vision that
[1:48:54] was initially given there and this
[1:48:56] blueprint dictated all of it but they
[1:48:58] were without communication with one
[1:49:00] another and then it all came together in
[1:49:02] that one place there and it was all
[1:49:04] assemble and bang there's that there's
[1:49:06] the temple of God I mean what a story
[1:49:08] right what a story I mean you understand
[1:49:10] saints of God without you know
[1:49:12] belaboring this point when we get over
[1:49:14] on the other side and all the body of
[1:49:16] Christ comes together we're only what 40
[1:49:18] people here today or so 30 or 40 people
[1:49:21] here today but when all the body comes
[1:49:23] together and you realize we've all been
[1:49:25] shaped by the same blueprint
[1:49:27] what are coming together that's gonna be
[1:49:31] my goodness it'll be a great coming
[1:49:35] together when you get over there and you
[1:49:36] see all your friends from Laodicea right
[1:49:38] the last of the last all the people over
[1:49:40] there and there's brother Branham with
[1:49:41] us what uh what an honor that would be
[1:49:43] to be in over there with brother Branham
[1:49:45] and I'd like to shake his hand wouldn't
[1:49:47] you I'm not a brother branham worshiper
[1:49:50] but I'd like to shake his hand now I
[1:49:52] just say got to be a wonderful thing to
[1:49:55] experience you don't be over there with
[1:49:56] all the all the believers out of
[1:49:58] Laodicea and then then to realize that's
[1:50:00] only one seventh of the flock and then
[1:50:05] to meet all of those people back there
[1:50:06] and hi you know I got a I got an
[1:50:08] affinity with Martin Luther all right
[1:50:11] walked out of the Catholic Church ready
[1:50:13] to nail something on the board I was
[1:50:15] telling him you somebody the other day
[1:50:16] when we went to the rectory up there and
[1:50:18] wanted to tell the priest that we were
[1:50:19] leaving the Catholic Church and ready to
[1:50:21] nail the malachi fort right on the
[1:50:23] church door you know when we went in we
[1:50:26] were ready to do that when we came out
[1:50:27] we were not ready to do that but when we
[1:50:29] went in we were ready to do that
[1:50:31] all right I'd like to meet him I in for
[1:50:34] John Wesley and all those people back
[1:50:36] here I've been at a place where Columba
[1:50:38] lived over in Scotland there in the
[1:50:40] island I love Iona and just there was
[1:50:43] there's just the amount of work that he
[1:50:46] did and the supernatural events that
[1:50:47] took place on that little island and
[1:50:50] our sorryi rainiest over here is on the
[1:50:53] Isle of Iona and he would he would train
[1:50:56] young men to go preach the gospel and
[1:50:57] they'd go down in Europe and England and
[1:50:59] all of France and Spain and Portugal and
[1:51:02] it's travel all over they were trained
[1:51:05] by Irenaeus and a great work that he did
[1:51:07] he's a very
[1:51:09] underscore he's a very
[1:51:12] under applauded what's that word
[1:51:14] underrated he's a very underrated
[1:51:17] messenger we don't hear very much about
[1:51:18] him he's not as popular as the ones that
[1:51:20] are here and Paul but he did a
[1:51:22] tremendous work and when you look at it
[1:51:24] I was there in the bookstore where the
[1:51:26] ferry went across to the iron the island
[1:51:28] and I bought the same book that brother
[1:51:30] branham read when he made the decision
[1:51:31] about choosing Iranian instead of
[1:51:33] Polycarp for this church age messenger
[1:51:35] and it was no wonder he did just such
[1:51:37] tremendous things and it was just a
[1:51:39] blessing to be there there was still a
[1:51:40] different aura about that Island that
[1:51:43] was there thousands of years after the
[1:51:45] fact because of the work that he did it
[1:51:48] was just absolutely amazing and to meet
[1:51:50] those saints of God and those people and
[1:51:52] I mean you think about the Saints but
[1:51:55] you go back all that way and you've only
[1:51:56] met a portion of the folks that are
[1:51:58] gonna be over there
[1:52:00] imagine meeting David and
[1:52:02] Solomon Abraham look there's Adam
[1:52:06] there's Adam and his wife
[1:52:10] we laugh about it but it will happen one
[1:52:14] day
[1:52:14] and we're all gathered over to the other
[1:52:17] side and then he comes out yeah I mean
[1:52:20] it's it's just it's hard even it's hard
[1:52:22] to even think hard even imagine that I
[1:52:25] is not seen there's not hurt I
[1:52:28] told you to be simple now watch now just
[1:52:32] a little side note here I wanted to drop
[1:52:34] this in here for you in the book the
[1:52:36] Hebrews series brother Graham said now
[1:52:38] Paul had an experience and how many
[1:52:40] believes that experience comes by
[1:52:41] conversion do you believe that a
[1:52:44] lot of people believe the opposite of
[1:52:46] that the opposite of that would be how
[1:52:48] many believed that conversion comes by
[1:52:50] experience
[1:52:51] but that's not what he said
[1:52:54] if it hasn't I would doubt the
[1:52:57] conversion the conversion brings
[1:52:58] experience you can have experiences you
[1:53:02] can you can listen to some music and get
[1:53:04] real emotional with it right you can go
[1:53:06] to a funeral to get real emotional I
[1:53:08] have an emotional experience but doesn't
[1:53:09] mean you're converted I
[1:53:11] was telling the church the other day I
[1:53:13] probably I knew I shouldn't have told
[1:53:14] him this but I had never heard the end
[1:53:15] of it but I was coming down the road one
[1:53:17] Sunday morning early by myself and I was
[1:53:19] listening to a focus on the family you
[1:53:22] know wit's end of interest and Odyssey
[1:53:24] and mr. Whitaker was going back and
[1:53:27] telling about how he wife died and how
[1:53:29] she had the disease and everything else
[1:53:31] and I got all emotional just listen to
[1:53:33] it and I got to thinking about sister
[1:53:34] Becky and what would happen if she died
[1:53:35] and I was just a wreck I I had I had a
[1:53:39] real experience coming down in the car I
[1:53:41] didn't get converted but you know you
[1:53:45] can have experiences right you've all
[1:53:47] been in churches where I mean you know
[1:53:49] the real dynamic experiences you know
[1:53:51] and you feel the goosebumps on your back
[1:53:54] we've all had experiences like that that
[1:53:56] doesn't mean you're converted there's
[1:53:57] lots of people that were sinners when
[1:53:58] they went into services like that and
[1:54:00] sinners when they came out so brother
[1:54:02] brands not saying that that that
[1:54:03] conversion the conversion comes by
[1:54:06] experience but experience comes by
[1:54:07] conversion watch now if it hasn't he
[1:54:10] said I doubt the conversion and the
[1:54:11] conversion brings experience and you
[1:54:14] can't allot it to anything now sometimes
[1:54:16] it might be shouting sometimes it might
[1:54:18] be speaking in tongues sometimes it
[1:54:19] might be weeping sometimes it might be
[1:54:21] groaning right your conversion would
[1:54:24] have had some
[1:54:26] element to it where you reacted to the
[1:54:29] presence of God but we don't necessarily
[1:54:32] have to all have the same experience
[1:54:35] right I've never spoken in tongues I
[1:54:37] felt like at a time or two but I've
[1:54:39] never actually spoken in tongues that
[1:54:41] doesn't make me not convert it
[1:54:43] I'm sure that you'd say man if you want
[1:54:47] to I'm sure that
[1:54:49] you don't know what it is so don't try
[1:54:53] to lot it
[1:54:55] you understand what he's saying now
[1:54:57] don't you try to impose that anybody
[1:54:59] that you've got a you got a laugh in the
[1:55:01] spirit you got to speak in tongues in
[1:55:02] order to be converted or you got to do a
[1:55:04] certain thing here you don't know what
[1:55:07] it is so don't try it a lot of because
[1:55:08] every one of you has proved to be wrong
[1:55:11] in it you Methodists and Baptists in
[1:55:14] your Nazarenes and Pentecostals whenever
[1:55:16] men tried to do that they were wrong in
[1:55:18] it just like the Pentecostals saying
[1:55:20] that you have the Holy Ghost only when
[1:55:23] you've spoken in tongues right
[1:55:25] that's what they believed a lot of
[1:55:27] Pentecostals went to their grave
[1:55:29] believing that but it wasn't the initial
[1:55:31] evidence
[1:55:32] it was an experience but it was not it
[1:55:36] was not the true baptism of the Holy
[1:55:38] Spirit are you okay with that don't get
[1:55:41] quiet on me folks I know I'm talking
[1:55:42] about you understand what he's saying
[1:55:44] now you've got to make sure that you
[1:55:45] separate an experience from the
[1:55:47] conversion because the conversions going
[1:55:49] to bring you back to same into every
[1:55:50] word right a real conversions of New
[1:55:53] Birth it's going to bring you back to
[1:55:54] air to say a name in every word to
[1:55:56] believe in the word for your day walking
[1:55:57] in the light as he's in the light but
[1:56:00] you can have a lot of experiences along
[1:56:01] the way can have experiences before and
[1:56:03] after a new birth and in the new birth
[1:56:07] but remember now the key is the
[1:56:09] conversion not the experience are we
[1:56:12] okay he said I've seen people shout just
[1:56:14] as hard as they could shout and steal
[1:56:16] the gold of your teeth
[1:56:17] I've seen people speak with tongues like
[1:56:20] pouring peas on a dry cowhide and
[1:56:21] honest-to-goodness they chewed tobacco
[1:56:22] on the other side of the mouth and cut
[1:56:24] their throat if they could do it
[1:56:26] were they people who had an experience
[1:56:28] yes sir where they converted no sir you
[1:56:31] understand what he's saying now all
[1:56:33] right so let's look at this now the
[1:56:36] reason I bring this in when it comes to
[1:56:38] adoption we know adoption is the placing
[1:56:41] of a believer right
[1:56:42] the conversion of a believer is one
[1:56:45] thing the maturing and the placing of a
[1:56:46] believer is another thing and that takes
[1:56:49] place over time that's a learning how
[1:56:51] the father's way of things is that's it
[1:56:53] learning the father's way and he says
[1:56:55] what is adoption adoption is not your
[1:56:58] new birth it is not your birth your
[1:57:00] adoption is you are placing when we are
[1:57:02] born of the Spirit of God we are sons of
[1:57:03] God we were predestinated now this is
[1:57:06] what hurts Pentecostals a little they
[1:57:08] say well I got born again praise the
[1:57:09] Lord got the Holy Ghost fine you're a
[1:57:10] child of God that's right but yet that
[1:57:12] ain't what I'm talking about because
[1:57:13] he's in the adoption series now this is
[1:57:16] the series he's talking about see you
[1:57:18] were predestinated unto adoption and
[1:57:21] adoption is placing a son
[1:57:26] so remember now we're the Pentecostal
[1:57:29] people and he knew this was like nails
[1:57:30] on the chalkboard of the Pentecostal
[1:57:31] people because let me tell you something
[1:57:33] about Brandon tabernacle in brother
[1:57:35] Graham's early years when brother
[1:57:36] Branham had the prayer lines he did in
[1:57:37] Branham tabernacle and he'd leave the
[1:57:39] building they would have the people who
[1:57:41] come and take the service after him
[1:57:43] would have people come up and speak in
[1:57:45] tongues at the altar and they trained
[1:57:46] him to speak in tongues at the altar
[1:57:48] because they still believed that was the
[1:57:50] only evidence of the Holy Spirit and
[1:57:52] they did that because brother Branham
[1:57:54] left the building
[1:57:55] and yeah I can show you a coach where
[1:57:57] brother Bantam came back and corrected
[1:57:59] that in his own church and even brother
[1:58:01] Neville over that because they were
[1:58:03] placing the experience ahead of the
[1:58:07] conversion
[1:58:09] and what was brother Branham there to do
[1:58:11] he was there to bring this adoption
[1:58:13] ministry to place us in the word for our
[1:58:16] day not another day are we okay here we
[1:58:19] had a Joshua type ministry to place us
[1:58:21] in the word hey listen say to God if it
[1:58:24] wasn't for adoption in your life you'd
[1:58:26] still be back believing other things of
[1:58:28] another era but God placed us in this in
[1:58:31] this word he placed us in this time now
[1:58:33] where we have the light that we have and
[1:58:35] you are predestinated unto adoption so
[1:58:39] in other words there's a birth there's a
[1:58:41] birth over here and then there's a
[1:58:43] placing of this son and there's a lot
[1:58:46] that goes on between here and there
[1:58:49] right and one day you're going to be
[1:58:53] taken and you're going to be placed in
[1:58:54] that eternal house in that eternal
[1:58:56] Tabernacle over there on the other side
[1:58:58] but over there God won't say wow that
[1:59:02] guy's still got an attitude he's still
[1:59:04] got a lot of pride we're gonna have to
[1:59:06] get the belt sander out and work on
[1:59:07] there'll be none of that over there all
[1:59:09] of that is done here are we okay all of
[1:59:13] that is done here
[1:59:15] and those are
[1:59:18] experiences that we have along the way
[1:59:22] but you don't have those kinds of
[1:59:24] experiences until there's a conversion
[1:59:27] first
[1:59:29] then God's interested in making you v
[1:59:31] some where are we okay this is important
[1:59:36] folks these walls are gonna be able
[1:59:37] you'll see now in in
[1:59:41] 1963
[1:59:43] brother Branham said what good is stones
[1:59:46] if you don't have a true stonemason and
[1:59:49] with a good sharp tool is to shape him
[1:59:51] into fitting into the fitting place in
[1:59:54] the house of God what's the good of a
[1:59:56] stone if you know somebody who knows
[1:59:57] what the blueprint says and how to shape
[1:59:59] it you're just piling up a bunch of
[2:00:01] rocks it isn't doing a bit of good see
[2:00:05] that's right that's the people and while
[2:00:06] goodness is that to come to church if
[2:00:08] the stonemason is there that'll shape
[2:00:10] that and make them quit this and that
[2:00:12] and cut them and make them over this way
[2:00:14] and square them up and make them like
[2:00:16] Christians and sets in the house of God
[2:00:18] with signs following the believers
[2:00:21] what do you got you got a bunch of
[2:00:23] church right a bunch of churchgoers a
[2:00:25] bunch of church rocks that's in time
[2:00:29] evangelism
[2:00:31] well come on folks and we think of
[2:00:33] evangelism this is how we define it I
[2:00:35] got to get out of these lights I'll be
[2:00:38] able to see for a week
[2:00:40] the when we think of evangelism we think
[2:00:44] of somebody pulling on the people in
[2:00:46] denominational circles now do you think
[2:00:47] of them pulling on the people that come
[2:00:49] to the altar to make a decision that's
[2:00:51] going to determine their eternal
[2:00:52] destination right that's that's not how
[2:00:55] we think of it but that's how the world
[2:00:56] a church world thinks of evangelism they
[2:00:59] bring in an evangelist just shake
[2:01:01] everybody up and get them up to the
[2:01:02] altar and make a decision and that's
[2:01:03] going to determine where they go
[2:01:04] you know give your heart to the Lord
[2:01:06] you'll go to heaven you don't keep your
[2:01:07] heart to the Lord you're gonna go to
[2:01:08] hell and the decisions made right here
[2:01:10] come on you know mom did it dad did it
[2:01:11] why don't you do it come on up here and
[2:01:13] they have everybody come to the altar
[2:01:14] right that's all-time evangelism now in
[2:01:16] their season that was all right but
[2:01:18] that's not endtime evangelism that's not
[2:01:20] what brother Branham did when brother
[2:01:22] manum came and preached in time
[2:01:23] evangelism and I can show you in the
[2:01:24] sermon brother Branham did this he had
[2:01:27] everybody turn around and look at the
[2:01:28] Lamb's Book of Life and he said if your
[2:01:31] name is on the Lamb's Book of Life your
[2:01:33] destiny is already sealed
[2:01:35] your origin becomes your destiny right
[2:01:38] and run around keep talking about the
[2:01:41] Lamb's Book of Life and he talks about
[2:01:42] how the fact that you know one day
[2:01:43] you're recognized you're not just the
[2:01:45] son of Frank and Betty coffee but you're
[2:01:47] a son of God you always were he said it
[2:01:49] began that day he said your realization
[2:01:52] of it began at the altar but you always
[2:01:53] were a son of God right and so brother
[2:01:58] man I've had everybody looks that way at
[2:01:59] the Lamb's Book of Life and realize if
[2:02:01] I'm there I'm gonna identify with the
[2:02:02] mystery of my day
[2:02:04] right and come into the light of the
[2:02:06] hour but a heaven experience I had this
[2:02:09] conversion time right here at an altar
[2:02:12] at his church service when I realize
[2:02:14] that I'm more than just a son of my
[2:02:16] parents I'm a son of God and if I was
[2:02:18] the son of God I was back there and I'm
[2:02:20] back there that up there is already
[2:02:22] settled I didn't decide it God decided
[2:02:24] it a long time ago
[2:02:26] right and then brother branham said this
[2:02:32] this kind of evangelism this endtime
[2:02:35] evangelism is also identified by
[2:02:37] he said that stonemason cutting you and
[2:02:41] and shaping you and molding you and
[2:02:45] squaring you up with the word
[2:02:47] now let me tell you something brother
[2:02:49] Jarrell will identify with this
[2:02:52] there's a statement where if I had it I
[2:02:54] should have brought it brother Branham
[2:02:56] said people are gonna do what they're
[2:02:57] gonna do
[2:02:59] it was an awfully true statement people
[2:03:03] are gonna do what they're gonna do and
[2:03:05] you know what as much as I preached in
[2:03:06] as much as I labor in as much as you
[2:03:09] study and sweat and give it out to
[2:03:12] people and turn red in the face and all
[2:03:13] of that people still go do what they're
[2:03:15] gonna do
[2:03:16] it's an amazing thing you wonder huh you
[2:03:19] know what else are you supposed to do
[2:03:21] what ministry can you bring in what way
[2:03:23] can you can you present it to people
[2:03:26] because you got to realize this it isn't
[2:03:29] me shaping the people the Holy Spirit's
[2:03:34] got to do it and in order for the Holy
[2:03:36] Spirit to do it there's got to be a
[2:03:37] certain amount of surrender in their
[2:03:40] life to say Lord you look at me honestly
[2:03:44] you show me myself in the perfect law of
[2:03:46] Liberty which is like a mirror and let
[2:03:48] me see myself and and help me to change
[2:03:52] until the people come to that place
[2:03:54] people are gonna do what they want to do
[2:03:57] you can pre-sell you're blue in the face
[2:03:59] I'll tell you that because I am limited
[2:04:02] and how much I can shape the people and
[2:04:03] how much I can I can you know
[2:04:06] if I impose things on the people you're
[2:04:10] only gonna find a way to get around that
[2:04:11] they're only gonna find a way to get
[2:04:13] around that in time if they don't have
[2:04:16] the Holy Spirit if they've never
[2:04:18] surrendered to the Holy Spirit they're
[2:04:19] gonna find a way to get around that you
[2:04:21] remember there was a certain brother who
[2:04:24] came to our church years ago
[2:04:27] whose wife is still serving the Lord and
[2:04:30] he was in a Bible College
[2:04:33] and they had built a fence around that
[2:04:35] Bible College to keep the students in
[2:04:38] because they were not allowed they had
[2:04:40] curfews and they had to be in the hand
[2:04:42] of building you know at certain periods
[2:04:43] of time and he said we didn't do it he
[2:04:45] says you know we didn't have the Holy
[2:04:46] Ghost back then and he said we just
[2:04:48] found a way to dig underneath the fence
[2:04:50] and go out
[2:04:53] because without the Holy Ghost the rules
[2:04:56] don't really all you're doing is finding
[2:04:57] a way to get around him it's this just
[2:05:00] challenge to get around these rules that
[2:05:01] are there what brother Branham is
[2:05:03] telling us right here is that endtime
[2:05:04] evangelism the whole ministry the end
[2:05:06] time is not only to pull the loose ends
[2:05:08] together and to open up the seals and so
[2:05:10] forth but to listen to effectively shape
[2:05:13] you by the preaching of the word the
[2:05:15] washing of the water by the word
[2:05:18] it isn't just to have the seals but it
[2:05:21] is to have the effect of that open word
[2:05:23] affect you to shape you and mold you in
[2:05:26] a way that no other age has been shaped
[2:05:27] because we've got a word that no other
[2:05:29] ages have and we are the last part of
[2:05:32] this thing the capstone people and we
[2:05:34] are the people that have you know the
[2:05:36] the the the the the finest work compared
[2:05:38] to all the other work not that our
[2:05:40] messages is more eternal than theirs or
[2:05:43] we've got more eternal life they're all
[2:05:44] just as eternal as we are but no other
[2:05:48] age saw what we have seen in this last
[2:05:51] time and so therefore I believe there's
[2:05:53] a greater element of of molding and
[2:05:56] shaping as brother Graham says right
[2:05:58] here that's what that's what any time
[2:06:00] evangelism is
[2:06:01] because God had to take us in a lifetime
[2:06:04] in this last day from something that
[2:06:07] looked like this
[2:06:08] to something look like this in type
[2:06:12] right God God looked at this and he said
[2:06:17] I
[2:06:19] can make something out of that
[2:06:21] just a pile of dirt he looked at that he
[2:06:24] said oh that's that's grandness that's
[2:06:27] hard old stuff stubborn as a mule I can
[2:06:31] make something out of that I I can I can
[2:06:32] do it my leg just give me time give me
[2:06:35] time
[2:06:35] and I can make something really
[2:06:37] beautiful
[2:06:38] and that's what God did didn't he come
[2:06:42] on folks think about where you are I
[2:06:43] could bring the pictures I could show
[2:06:45] you my pictures or when I go got ahold
[2:06:46] of me now think about this think about
[2:06:50] this all of you that are going back
[2:06:51] memory lane come on back now come on
[2:06:53] back now I could show you the pictures
[2:06:54] I've showed that picture to my church
[2:06:55] and they still don't believe that's me
[2:06:57] they still don't believe that's me
[2:06:59] now think about it this way all right
[2:07:02] you kids now watch this when God called
[2:07:05] you out of here all right when God
[2:07:08] called you from here he took you from
[2:07:10] the world and once he called you
[2:07:14] you didn't fit in other words when God
[2:07:16] blasted you out of the world you were in
[2:07:19] you didn't fit anymore here
[2:07:23] but when God called you out she
[2:07:25] certainly didn't fit in in this place
[2:07:27] over here
[2:07:28] right that old stone that fell out of
[2:07:31] the side of the mountain over here had
[2:07:33] to be worked on until it found its place
[2:07:35] over here I
[2:07:37] mean this was not fit to enter in when I
[2:07:41] came in I wasn't fit to find my place
[2:07:44] over there in that eternal house no sir
[2:07:48] because remember now we are we are part
[2:07:51] of an eternal house right eternal temple
[2:07:54] eternal Kingdom
[2:07:56] this was a natural this was a natural
[2:07:59] phenomenon right but but we we know that
[2:08:02] that's this body it's not our destiny
[2:08:05] God's got a eternal house for us on the
[2:08:08] other side and we're part of an eternal
[2:08:09] Kingdom on this side over here right
[2:08:11] God's got a house for us got his address
[2:08:13] for us we are predestinated unto that
[2:08:15] God's got a place over here for us but
[2:08:17] when we came out we were not fit to
[2:08:19] enter into there we had to go through a
[2:08:21] whole lot of things here
[2:08:23] friends were shucked off dress codes
[2:08:26] were shucked off we had attitudes we had
[2:08:28] language we had all kinds of things that
[2:08:30] had to go here styles that had to go
[2:08:32] right and all kinds of things that had
[2:08:34] to drop off drop off drop off it was a
[2:08:36] new that was making those decisions it
[2:08:38] was those 70,000 stone quarry workers
[2:08:41] that were there working on us all the
[2:08:43] way through there and bringing a sermon
[2:08:45] after sermon after sermon and you say
[2:08:47] Lord whatever it takes and he'd send
[2:08:49] that stone quarry worker in there and
[2:08:51] they'd work you over a little bit and
[2:08:53] you do you come away I thank God I got
[2:08:55] delivered other than you know when you
[2:08:57] listen to
[2:08:59] him working on those stones now let me
[2:09:02] let me illustrate it this way the moment
[2:09:05] God called you you don't fit there
[2:09:07] anymore and you don't fit there
[2:09:10] you're an oddball
[2:09:12] alright you are an oddball because all
[2:09:15] this way here you don't you don't fit
[2:09:18] anywhere you don't fit in in this
[2:09:20] journey folks we don't fit in we don't
[2:09:23] blend with the world right they do
[2:09:25] things they listen to things they enjoy
[2:09:27] things they watch things that we don't
[2:09:29] watch and we don't fit in with and we
[2:09:30] have trouble fitting in with them all
[2:09:32] along this journey the only other people
[2:09:36] that we can relate to from here to here
[2:09:40] are the other stones that are being
[2:09:42] worked on -
[2:09:44] [Music]
[2:09:45] you're the only people that understand
[2:09:48] me you're the only people that would
[2:09:50] understand why we would get excited
[2:09:52] about a message that God sent through a
[2:09:54] prophet back here who we refer to as a
[2:09:56] prophet most people have no idea what
[2:09:58] that even means but do you understand
[2:10:01] what I'm going through and when we see a
[2:10:02] brother going through a difficulty or a
[2:10:04] trial and gods shaping him and molding
[2:10:06] him you know exactly what's going on
[2:10:08] God's dealing with his heart God dealing
[2:10:10] with his life God's dealing with his
[2:10:12] family we can relate to that because
[2:10:14] we're the ones who are going through
[2:10:15] that as well
[2:10:16] right we have sympathy we have empathy
[2:10:20] we know how to pray for people who are
[2:10:21] going through difficulties and trials
[2:10:23] and and ill-health and all the rest of
[2:10:26] it we understand those principles
[2:10:27] because we've been trained in this
[2:10:29] adoption process all of these years here
[2:10:32] and the people out in the world say why
[2:10:34] don't they say to us why don't you quit
[2:10:36] why don't you just give it up and go
[2:10:37] there's lots of other churches why don't
[2:10:40] you just give it up and take the easier
[2:10:42] path
[2:10:44] they don't relate to us we don't relate
[2:10:46] to them the only people who understand
[2:10:49] this language at all is the people who
[2:10:50] are going through the same thing
[2:10:53] and you don't fit anywhere you don't fit
[2:10:56] anywhere you matter of fact the moment
[2:10:58] God starts working on you can't go back
[2:10:59] there you can't go back into that old
[2:11:01] mountain again right you can't the last
[2:11:04] thing in the world once you get an idea
[2:11:05] that it is God who's actually doing this
[2:11:07] and God has called you you don't want to
[2:11:09] go back to there
[2:11:11] you don't want to go back to the slime
[2:11:13] pits of the world you don't want to go
[2:11:15] back to the glory of the word you don't
[2:11:16] want to go back to that could you if you
[2:11:19] could I got to preach differently but I
[2:11:22] mean I don't think there's any of you
[2:11:23] that would want to go back to the world
[2:11:25] again and and and live that way that we
[2:11:27] were in the world
[2:11:29] because as soon as you come in God gives
[2:11:31] you a glimpse of the eternal he lets you
[2:11:33] know certain promises there and and and
[2:11:35] it gives you the baptism of the Holy
[2:11:37] Spirit and all of a sudden things begin
[2:11:39] to be illuminated in your heart that you
[2:11:41] never knew I is not seen and all of a
[2:11:44] sudden you're beginning to realize God's
[2:11:46] got an eternity waiting for me he's got
[2:11:48] a better body waiting for me my loved
[2:11:50] ones are on the other side we sorrow not
[2:11:52] as those which have no hope we believe
[2:11:53] we're gonna see them again over on the
[2:11:55] other side isn't that right the whole
[2:11:56] world going into darkness and God has
[2:11:58] pulled us out of it the whole world
[2:12:01] plunging towards tribulation and here
[2:12:03] they are building stores and malls and
[2:12:05] digging for oil and everything else and
[2:12:07] I'm looking at it and saying
[2:12:09] who cares I
[2:12:12] mean it's great because you got more
[2:12:14] choices in stores but you know what at
[2:12:16] the end of it you you spend your money
[2:12:18] anyway right it's a rat race to me
[2:12:23] there's no satisfaction in those things
[2:12:25] anymore now for people in the world I
[2:12:27] mean they they gain satisfaction by
[2:12:29] heaven you know things and stuff and all
[2:12:31] the rest of it but for me that's not my
[2:12:32] chief joy God has put a chief joy in my
[2:12:35] heart that's different than the things
[2:12:36] of the world things of the world and the
[2:12:38] only people that can really relate to
[2:12:39] that is the people who are going through
[2:12:40] the same thing
[2:12:43] hang on
[2:12:45] brother Graham said stones are like
[2:12:47] decisions confessions blessed are
[2:12:49] thought Peter upon this rock and all
[2:12:51] year he said we have decisions those
[2:12:53] stones confessions or good as a stone
[2:12:55] without a stonemason and the sharp Word
[2:12:57] of God to cut him into a son of God or a
[2:12:58] daughter of God and place him in the
[2:13:00] church where he belongs what good is
[2:13:02] that
[2:13:02] for whom the Lord loveth each a sinner
[2:13:06] and he scourgeth every son whom he
[2:13:08] receives God receives you begins to work
[2:13:11] on you and if you endure this chastening
[2:13:14] God dealeth with you as sons that's that
[2:13:15] adoption process isn't it for what son
[2:13:18] is he whom the father Jason is not for
[2:13:21] they verily for a few days chasing us
[2:13:22] after their own pleasure but he for our
[2:13:24] profit that he might be partakers of his
[2:13:26] holiness now God is not making a square
[2:13:29] on the on the edges but this is what
[2:13:31] he's doing that word chastened means the
[2:13:33] whole training and education of children
[2:13:35] which relates to the cultivation of your
[2:13:38] mind and morals and
[2:13:40] with that comes reproofs and punishments
[2:13:43] so that's the word now that paul chooses
[2:13:46] to use there it also includes the
[2:13:48] training in care of the body so as
[2:13:50] parents now we can relate to this
[2:13:52] because we're always trying to sculpt
[2:13:54] and mold and shape the thinking of our
[2:13:57] children basically to our values
[2:14:01] to the things that we feel are important
[2:14:03] if they don't need to watch a certain
[2:14:05] thing we're gonna prevent that if they
[2:14:07] do need to participate in a certain
[2:14:09] thing we're gonna promote that right
[2:14:11] that's what we're going to do and and so
[2:14:13] therefore it's the whole training of
[2:14:15] children so Paul is saying that the way
[2:14:17] God looks at us is as is luck he's got a
[2:14:20] bunch of recruits and he's going to work
[2:14:22] with us to shape our thinking and cause
[2:14:26] us to think differently about things
[2:14:28] than anyone else's children because
[2:14:31] we're gonna be shaped by God's values
[2:14:34] and God's Way of thinking right like a
[2:14:36] parent would shape the thinking of their
[2:14:38] children or try to and God is going to
[2:14:41] shape our thinking according to his way
[2:14:43] and his way is found in his word right
[2:14:46] that makes sense whatever in adults also
[2:14:49] cultivates the soul by correcting
[2:14:52] mistakes and curbing passions
[2:14:53] instruction which aims at increasing
[2:14:54] virtue this would be a self-evident
[2:14:57] question but how many of you have ever
[2:15:00] done anything wrong and felt checked by
[2:15:01] it you know maybe you went to the wrong
[2:15:04] place on the internet or maybe you know
[2:15:06] a little white lie or maybe achieved a
[2:15:08] little on your taxes or whatever else
[2:15:09] and whatever you did all of a sudden
[2:15:12] there's a there's a conviction there
[2:15:18] there's a hesitate patien there
[2:15:21] and you know what you really ought to be
[2:15:24] thanking God for that because it's the
[2:15:27] thing that curbs you it's the things
[2:15:30] that cultivates the passion to do the
[2:15:33] right thing instead of the wrong thing
[2:15:36] because if you didn't have that you'd
[2:15:38] carry on in the error of your own ways
[2:15:41] and the worst thing that could happen to
[2:15:44] you is that God would turn you over to
[2:15:45] your own ways
[2:15:47] that's the worst thing that could happen
[2:15:49] to you but God constantly checks us and
[2:15:52] brings us back you know what he's doing
[2:15:53] he's doing it like a father would do his
[2:15:56] children to cultivate certain good
[2:15:59] things there and caused that to be
[2:16:01] strong so that it would overwhelm the
[2:16:04] weak I
[2:16:07] down in our down in our place in
[2:16:09] Virginia there when we moved in there we
[2:16:11] we bought a portion of a pasture our
[2:16:14] neighborhood was a pasture so there was
[2:16:17] pasture grass in the pasture obviously
[2:16:20] and in a pasture there's all kinds of
[2:16:22] grasses that grow there and I every
[2:16:25] spring I'd look at it you know with the
[2:16:27] boys and we'd be out there
[2:16:29] except Andrew he wouldn't be there but
[2:16:31] the other boys would be we'd be looking
[2:16:32] at it'd be all kinds of weeds and I said
[2:16:34] guys we're gonna have to pull these
[2:16:34] weeds we're gonna have to get some weed
[2:16:36] killer and we're gonna have to spread
[2:16:37] this out and you know so they every year
[2:16:39] we try to go at it we try to kill all
[2:16:41] the weeds and finally I found somebody
[2:16:43] who knew what they were talking about
[2:16:44] and I asked him I said how in the world
[2:16:46] we deal with this let's do a soil sample
[2:16:49] and see what the soil is actually
[2:16:50] looking like and so they did that and so
[2:16:52] on and he finally he told me he said
[2:16:54] you're wasting your time trying to kill
[2:16:55] all these weeds he said you'll never do
[2:16:57] it because as soon as you kill him
[2:16:58] there'll be other weeds from your
[2:16:59] neighbor's over here they're sitting on
[2:17:00] the same grass you were on and there's
[2:17:02] just gonna blow in here and you're gonna
[2:17:04] grow more weeds again he said this it's
[2:17:06] a waste of time he said that's not the
[2:17:07] way to go about this and I said well
[2:17:09] pray tell what is and he said feed the
[2:17:12] grass
[2:17:13] he said if you feed the grass he said
[2:17:15] the grass will grow strong enough it'll
[2:17:17] take everything over and choke out all
[2:17:18] those weeds he said don't worry about
[2:17:20] trying to kill everything he said just
[2:17:22] feed that feed that grass he said just
[2:17:24] just watch that it'll just it'll just
[2:17:25] push everything else out and take over
[2:17:27] because grass is in the senses is a weed
[2:17:29] it's just a we do we like and we've
[2:17:31] named it something you know and we've
[2:17:32] kind of we like it that's all but he
[2:17:35] said if you let it go it just looks like
[2:17:36] a weed like all the rest of it you can't
[2:17:37] tell it apart but he said die if I were
[2:17:39] you he said I just feed the grass just
[2:17:40] just do that don't worry about anything
[2:17:42] else and we did and you know what it
[2:17:44] worked now we have a beautiful lawn
[2:17:46] years later we have a beautiful lawn
[2:17:48] because we fed the grass and that grass
[2:17:50] just kind of did what he said I just
[2:17:52] pushed everything out it and and its
[2:17:55] strong the grass is strong it is rooted
[2:17:57] in there and it's strong in other words
[2:17:59] let me let me apply it this way feed
[2:18:02] that inner man and let that become
[2:18:05] strong and push out a lot of that other
[2:18:07] stuff that doesn't belong there you can
[2:18:09] be legalistic and say well I'm not gonna
[2:18:11] do this I'm not gonna do that and thou
[2:18:12] shalt not do this now it's kids you
[2:18:13] shall not do - hey you're better off
[2:18:14] giving your kids a love for the gospel
[2:18:16] instead of a bunch of restrictions from
[2:18:18] the things of the world
[2:18:20] because jesus said if you love me you
[2:18:24] will keep my Commandments
[2:18:26] it's not rules and regulations it's if
[2:18:29] you love me you keep my Commandments and
[2:18:32] when you give your children you
[2:18:33] cultivate a love for the gospel and the
[2:18:35] things of God and and you you encourage
[2:18:38] them to do the right things and let go
[2:18:40] of the wrong things and make your
[2:18:41] priorities right seek first the kingdom
[2:18:43] of God when you begin to cultivate that
[2:18:45] in children let me tell you over time
[2:18:47] they begin to recognize things when
[2:18:49] they're wrong when they pop up and
[2:18:50] they're not they don't belong there
[2:18:51] they're more easily identifiable right
[2:18:54] and in your own life the same thing is
[2:18:57] true that when you feed that inner man I
[2:18:59] mean you're strong and when you're prey
[2:19:01] and when you seek God in your app church
[2:19:02] and they're right you had to write
[2:19:03] openness in church when the wrong thing
[2:19:06] pops up in your life gets evident right
[2:19:07] away you know you've crossed a line you
[2:19:09] know you've grieved the Holy Spirit that
[2:19:12] doesn't come by accident that comes
[2:19:13] because you fed the grass you feed the
[2:19:17] inner man in your life and it will it
[2:19:19] will cultivate the right thing in your
[2:19:20] life now that's exactly what Paul is you
[2:19:22] that's the term I said all that about
[2:19:24] the grass because that's the term he's
[2:19:26] using right here every son who he whom
[2:19:30] the Lord loveth he chasing it he caught
[2:19:32] he's always cultivating something in
[2:19:34] your life he's wanting to bring out the
[2:19:36] right things in your life
[2:19:38] an adoption brother branham said and I
[2:19:40] say unto thee thou art Peter I'm the
[2:19:42] great rock I'm the cornerstone he says
[2:19:45] but you are the little
[2:19:46] that's placed upon me and the builders
[2:19:49] chose you you never chose yourself and
[2:19:53] the angels of God one night working in
[2:19:56] the quarry called you out and you
[2:19:59] submitted yourself to me and I cut you
[2:20:02] in my own fashion I made you the way I
[2:20:05] wanted you to be I done the sawing you
[2:20:09] just stood still and I placed you now as
[2:20:12] a little stone to fit in with some other
[2:20:15] stone to lead that stone and this stone
[2:20:18] leaves that stone and that stone and the
[2:20:21] cement of love is bringing you together
[2:20:24] making the foundation which I am to be
[2:20:27] fitted together with every stone that
[2:20:29] professes my name and receives this
[2:20:32] revelation and upon this rock the
[2:20:34] revelation of God that will stand still
[2:20:36] and be cut to stone by revelation I will
[2:20:39] build my church and the gates of Hell
[2:20:41] shall not prevail against it and now
[2:20:44] dear father but he says if there be any
[2:20:47] of your children that have been blasted
[2:20:49] with the gospel from the quarry of life
[2:20:51] all of us have right
[2:20:53] blasted from the world with the gospel
[2:20:55] out of the quarry of life what a
[2:20:57] statement and desire to so make them and
[2:21:01] been cutting on them this morning hewing
[2:21:05] them sawing off their habits and their
[2:21:09] evil thinking and their backbiting and
[2:21:12] their backslidings and now you want to
[2:21:15] place them again and fit them into the
[2:21:17] building will you speak to their hearts
[2:21:19] just now you understand when you say
[2:21:21] brother has put himself right into that
[2:21:23] he's a lively stone he's one that he's
[2:21:26] one that's being built up you know
[2:21:27] because of of the work of the Holy
[2:21:29] Spirit don't you agree that that God and
[2:21:32] those stonemasons worked on brother
[2:21:34] around
[2:21:36] remember that remember those experiences
[2:21:38] he had never in any other race if we
[2:21:41] ever get a window into the life of a
[2:21:43] prophet and the molding of a prophet
[2:21:44] until this last age when brother Branham
[2:21:47] came on the scene in first Kings at
[2:21:48] first Kings chapter 17 the Bible says
[2:21:51] and Elisha came out and called for a
[2:21:53] drought that's all we know we don't know
[2:21:55] anything about the preliminary life of
[2:21:58] Elisha we don't know what he went to we
[2:21:59] don't know what school he went to we
[2:22:00] don't know whether he shot six boys with
[2:22:01] a gun right we don't know about whether
[2:22:04] he was poor or rich we don't know where
[2:22:05] Tishbite what a tishbite is any of you
[2:22:08] know what a douche plate is if you know
[2:22:09] tell me afterwards
[2:22:11] no I we have never found what the word
[2:22:14] tishbite means but Elijah was a tishbite
[2:22:16] some say it was a hairy man he was a
[2:22:18] bearded man some savings from the place
[2:22:20] called tisha but we really don't know we
[2:22:22] know very little about the beginning of
[2:22:23] Elijah of all the sudden a fall comes on
[2:22:25] the scene right and we think well he's a
[2:22:27] prophet all the time but in this age God
[2:22:29] lets you see a prophet from his birth
[2:22:31] and a pillar fire comes right in the
[2:22:34] window there at his birth even when
[2:22:35] brother bran is not making any decisions
[2:22:37] right and then carrying water and the
[2:22:38] whirlwind comes and he's do you know
[2:22:40] guiding and cultivating brother Branham
[2:22:42] don't smoke her drink her to find your
[2:22:44] body in any way right and God's shaping
[2:22:47] that man brother man said well I'll be a
[2:22:49] man you know far be it from her Brandon
[2:22:51] not to drink and he tries to drink and
[2:22:53] that sound comes you know that whirling
[2:22:54] comes in what's called doing he's
[2:22:57] chastening this prophet right and then
[2:23:00] brother Graham so angry he takes his gun
[2:23:01] he hides by the side of the road these
[2:23:03] boys had come by he's gonna he shoot six
[2:23:05] times at the and the gun doesn't go off
[2:23:07] and they run down the road he shoots
[2:23:08] again six times and the gun goes off six
[2:23:10] times what was God doing guarding that
[2:23:12] man he was chasing that man and we see
[2:23:15] all of those events and those
[2:23:16] experiences from when God called them to
[2:23:18] where he actually was placed in the body
[2:23:20] and we find that shaping and it molding
[2:23:23] and all of that that went on in his life
[2:23:24] saints of God God allowed us to look in
[2:23:27] that window of his life and see how God
[2:23:29] dealt with the Prophet and if God would
[2:23:31] deal with a prophet why do you think
[2:23:32] that God wouldn't be dealing with you
[2:23:34] and God would allow you to go through
[2:23:37] certain things because he's shaping you
[2:23:40] from here to where you eventually fit in
[2:23:43] I
[2:23:44] said it before I'll say it again that
[2:23:46] out here we just talk about what it's
[2:23:48] going to be like over there in that
[2:23:50] place over yonder but one day you'll fit
[2:23:52] right in and I mean nobody arguing with
[2:23:54] it there'll be no websites over there
[2:23:57] that are contrary to the message I mean
[2:23:58] nobody nobody trying to say well the
[2:24:00] bridge didn't go up and abrade they
[2:24:01] didn't die on the bridge and all their
[2:24:02] all the other garbage that's out there
[2:24:04] there'll be none of that over there
[2:24:05] it'll all come together in the one unit
[2:24:08] and in Solomon's Temple the pillar of
[2:24:12] fire was the center it was a center of
[2:24:15] attraction in that building when that
[2:24:17] cloud came in there that was the center
[2:24:19] of attraction everybody else kind of had
[2:24:21] to step back and he he became the center
[2:24:24] of that whole thing
[2:24:26] imagine now
[2:24:29] today air and we have service
[2:24:33] you know it's it's a different
[2:24:35] atmosphere
[2:24:36] different atmosphere now to when we
[2:24:38] begin you know what's that
[2:24:40] different atmosphere now when they right
[2:24:43] right now then when we started when I
[2:24:44] walked in here I knew it was right I
[2:24:46] knew his right place I knew I wasn't
[2:24:48] supposed to be where I was supposed to
[2:24:49] be and I figured you you did to us why
[2:24:52] you came
[2:24:52] but there's just something about getting
[2:24:55] together with God's people and talking
[2:24:56] about God's Word it just brings an
[2:24:58] atmosphere that nothing else does but
[2:25:00] you know what we go right back out
[2:25:02] tomorrow we go back out in the world and
[2:25:03] your labor and you're working and you're
[2:25:06] you know you're mixing with people who
[2:25:08] are buying lottery tickets and there one
[2:25:10] there wondering what the you know the
[2:25:11] latest hockey score was and all the rest
[2:25:13] of it and they're they're passionate
[2:25:14] about Tim Hortons imagine me and
[2:25:16] passionate about something Tim Hortons
[2:25:18] and they're out there in the world and
[2:25:20] they look at those things as being all
[2:25:21] they're wonderful things in here
[2:25:23] yeah I kind of wish I was back there in
[2:25:27] yesterday
[2:25:29] forever I
[2:25:31] mean that's really at the end of the day
[2:25:33] what's the good of the rest of it I'd
[2:25:36] rather be in this presence greater
[2:25:38] forever I
[2:25:41] got loved ones on the other side you
[2:25:44] some of you got loved ones on the other
[2:25:45] side I got people I want to meet on the
[2:25:48] other side I got people I want to see
[2:25:50] real quick when I get over in the other
[2:25:51] side I want to go I know right where I'm
[2:25:53] going when I got on the other side I'll
[2:25:54] buy you I got people I want to see
[2:25:57] but over here we just don't fit in
[2:26:00] we don't fit anymore we don't fit back
[2:26:03] there
[2:26:03] and God hasn't allowed us to be fit back
[2:26:06] in in that Kingdom yet but he's still
[2:26:09] working on me and over time we just come
[2:26:12] closer and closer and one day
[2:26:15] we'll just be gone
[2:26:18] let's stay in raphy one day we'll be
[2:26:20] gone
[2:26:21] prepare that work build a house
[2:26:24] prepare thy work
[2:26:26] build my house
[2:26:29] God took a lot of planning God
[2:26:32] he instructed Solomon on how to do this
[2:26:35] and he give Solomon wisdom in order how
[2:26:36] to do this you get all these people all
[2:26:38] over this all over the countryside here
[2:26:42] fine people are skilled and let them do
[2:26:45] what they do it's like God God said all
[2:26:47] over the world he says I'm gonna give
[2:26:49] gifts to the people I'm gonna give
[2:26:50] prophets teachers evangelists pastors
[2:26:52] and so on and they're gonna preach the
[2:26:54] gospel and that gospel will work on
[2:26:56] those people and it'll shape them and
[2:26:58] mold them and change them it won't be
[2:27:01] the won't be the preacher that does it
[2:27:02] it'll be the gospel he preaches that
[2:27:04] works in the hearts of the people a very
[2:27:07] important distinction
[2:27:09] we don't want to all be little brother
[2:27:11] Gerald's
[2:27:13] because if we all weren't meant to be
[2:27:16] little brother Gerald's sister Betty
[2:27:18] would have had 40 or 50 kids
[2:27:23] but that's not wasn't God's intent
[2:27:25] that's not God's intent God's intent was
[2:27:28] is that we could come together under a
[2:27:30] word in Africa and Canada in the US or
[2:27:34] Europe wherever wherever it is and be
[2:27:36] all molded by the same blueprint so we
[2:27:39] could all find our unique place in God's
[2:27:41] kingdom you're not being shaped and
[2:27:43] molded to live here you're not being
[2:27:46] shaped for here you're being shaped for
[2:27:49] the money you're being shaped for the
[2:27:51] wedding supper you're being shaped for
[2:27:53] another Kingdom altogether you're not
[2:27:54] being prepared to live here matter of
[2:27:56] fact the way we live here is not going
[2:27:59] to guarantee prosperity and success here
[2:28:01] I
[2:28:02] mean the first thing we give away a
[2:28:04] tenth part of our income
[2:28:06] who else does that all right it's only a
[2:28:09] fanatical few give away the first part
[2:28:11] of their income most people work to keep
[2:28:14] all their income right and make it more
[2:28:15] make it bigger we just do things
[2:28:17] differently and the way things are
[2:28:18] structured we'll never be successful
[2:28:20] like the wicked of the world will never
[2:28:23] be God's got us on a different path and
[2:28:26] you're being molded not to live here
[2:28:28] you're being molded to live somewhere
[2:28:29] else
[2:28:30] understanding that process to me helps
[2:28:34] that helps be it unto me according to
[2:28:38] your word according to your promises I
[2:28:40] can stand assured I think that'll be our
[2:28:43] when those people went in that temple
[2:28:46] that day with Solomon and they're all
[2:28:47] standing there and they were offering
[2:28:49] those goats it must have been looking
[2:28:50] upward they must have been looking
[2:28:52] around and just saying what will God's
[2:28:54] reaction be to our place what will gods
[2:28:57] reaction be to our worship what will
[2:28:59] God's reaction be to these sacrifices
[2:29:01] that we make and they must have been
[2:29:02] looking I'm wondering will he come will
[2:29:06] he speak to us will he visit us today
[2:29:08] and they're going through what they
[2:29:10] needed to do hoping that God would do
[2:29:13] the rest I
[2:29:15] doubt to be our attitude when we come to
[2:29:17] this building here may it be a dedicated
[2:29:19] place for God's work God's people
[2:29:21] but every service you ought to be
[2:29:24] looking heavenward and saying Lord
[2:29:25] forgive me for what I didn't do and Lord
[2:29:28] just help me line up with your word but
[2:29:30] I'm glad brother Gerald's here and I'm
[2:29:32] glad sister Maureen's here to play the
[2:29:33] organ I'm glad everybody else is here
[2:29:34] but Lord we need you to come on the
[2:29:37] scene now I'm looking heavenward to see
[2:29:39] if you'd come on because one word from
