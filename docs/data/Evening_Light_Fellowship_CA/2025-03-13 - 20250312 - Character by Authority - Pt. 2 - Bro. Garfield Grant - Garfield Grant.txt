as as El Shai the breasted God the strength Giver Lord God may you come tonight Lord and may you bless your people have th own way we pray we humble our hearts to you our Lord in Jesus Christ's name and we say amen amen praise God are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight praise God I'm truly indeed happy you know to be standing another time I'm humbled to be standing before the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and you know I thank brother John for you know for the confidence that he has in me you know to have me here standing amen praise God I feel happy you know to serve the Bride of Jesus Christ amen praise God so I would like to continue the thought that we were on tonight and I ask for you just continue to pray for me as we go through it amen hallelujah we'll be reading from the our Bibles from Hebrews chapter 9 verse 13 and it read thus for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of efor sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal Spirit offer himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and so tonight we like to look on the purging of our conscience uh that's the a part that I had intentionally wanted to bring across so I think we can get to the main topic tonight amen amen you may be seated amen praise God so the last time we were talking about this and we say that you know to bring the bride into her Perfection really it will take God on the scene to bring us to Perfection it will take him on the scene you know to take us into that stage of perfection really and we see also and that's a wonderful thing church because he didn't entrust that with anything else but himself in other word we are in safe hands because we are trusting the mighty hands of God and so we also see Jesus you know that abam spoke of you know his ministry having three p we find that in St John 5: 19 you know before before he bring the turple that turple is God himself coming on the scene amen you know he he he he wanted his disciples to understand that it wasn't him Jesus that was doing the work it was his father which was God himself that was dwelling inside of him it was God himself that was doing the work so in other word he took it off completely off his Humanity Hallelujah which is very important to understanding because we cannot do this by ourself in our Humanity we have to depend on God and so he knows that church he knows that we can't do it by ourself and so it takes the mighty hands of God really Amen to bring forth a Total Restoration of all things and so in s John 5 and verse 19 he says then answered Jesus and said unto them ver verely I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he said the father doeth for what things soever he doth these things also doth the son likewise Hallelujah so J Jesus took it completely off himself and say hallelujah the father that dwelleth in me he's the one that is doing the work Hallelujah so just before he bring in that Temple as we mentioned earlier which was his Ministry you see brother Bram spoke of the ministry of Christ and he he said that e Ministry has three poles really you know and the first pull the second pull and the third pole and you know we see that under the first pull really it was the works of God it was the works of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and we saw great works that was done under the first pool we see under the second we see great works I used to God what are you you saying what where are you going with all of this because of what Paul said Hallelujah in Hebrews 9 and verse4 he said H that your consciences will be purged from dead Works to serve the Living God so the works Hallelujah under the first poll did not bring Perfection it could not bring Perfection Church Hallelujah we saw the and there were Mighty works really you know we see dead raised we saw great healing Revival in all of H but it could not bring the Perfection Hallelujah and so to bring the Perfection it took God himself on the seene hallelujah praise God to do what to do the works of perfection in other word it's going to it have to come a time when God himself comes on the scene again in this day to do the works of perfection in his bride Hallelujah and so what he did there he was telling them that it was his father father that will come on the scene and his father will do the works Hallelujah and so you know but explain the the tree pools and all of that Hallelujah and we saw all the good works that was done hallelujah but we saw also that you know as we mentioned earlier in St John 14 and verse uh St John 9 and verse1 14 it said how much more shall the blood of Christ to the eternal spirit offer himself without spot God H to purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God so to bring this work it's God and the scene again hallelujah praise God are you there with me church amen so your conscience have to be purged in other words our conscience as you know I think the first service I did mention it but it's it correlates with your soul in other words how do I know if your soul is made alive is when your conscience is awaiting to the righteousness of God by the word and so if your conscience is alive to God it will produce the works of God it's not just a fabrication of or of or something that someone Force upon you are you coming in and you take on the spirit of the church or the spirit of an EnV enironment but it is God in your soul operating God bringing forth a life conscience Hallelujah making the world know but the reason why you're dressed the way you dress because Christ is alive and so Christ in your house is expressing himself your conscience is bearing record that Christ is living in your house and because he's living there is showing that you are you are being made alive from dead works to serve the Living God so it takes him in your in your soul really to bring that conscience to life to produce that work it takes Christ on the inside and Paul said it's Christ in us the hope of glory so when the anointing come Hallelujah I'm it's not an anointing to anoint your flesh to produce the works of God no sir it's a it's an anointing upon your spirit but God comes on the scene to anoint your soul to bring your soul alive H to produce the perfect work of God hallelujah praise God and in other words church it's not a pressure to be a Christian it's not a hard thing really it's a surrendered heart but God can have his own way hallelujah praise God so so the the anointing we say it was meant to purge our soul you know to to bring it alive to the things of God you know we saw also in St John 14 you and verse you know 10 the Bible said believe thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or HSE believe me for the very Works sake verely verely I say unto you he that believe on me the works that I do he shall do it also Hallelujah if that same spirit that Rose Christ from the dead if he's dwelling inside of us tonight he will produce the same works you see today the the concept of work is when you get into that spiritual mode and someone can identify work works by spiritualism but this work is a work by faith it's a work of accepting Christ in your heart and allow Christ from the heart to express thems so the life you live the way you conduct yourself the way you speak your Association where you go your acquaintances is based on the Christ that is living on the inside hallelujah praise God that's the work we are speaking of so Jesus was saying that it was the father Hallelujah that was on the scene Hallelujah even was the one that was doing the work through him and it wasn't dead works it was living Works hallelujah praise God St John 6 have we turn there so we see in St John 6 when God was getting ready for that move God was getting ready for Perfection to get his church into a position where God can produce that work because remember no church except that work is except that work being produced Hallelujah then we cannot enter into the Perfection State and so when he comes when we saw in St John 6 he came on the scene and when he came on the scene on St John 6 in St John 6 he was getting ready to do something Hallelujah not just to the unbeliever adate believer but he was getting ready to do something for the genuine believer the call out one and so in St John 6 and verse 35 the Bible said and Jesus answered and said unto them I am the bread of life either that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I say unto you that he also have seen me and believe not all that the father has given me Hallelujah shall come to me and him that come to me I will I will in no wise cast them out verse 38 for I'm come down from heaven not to do my own will Hallelujah but the will of him that sent me let's start at verse 3 a little bit the will of the Father the will of God Jesus said it's not I am not here to do my own will I'm not here in other word hallelujah you put yourself in that same position if Christ is dwelling on the inside tonight it's not your will but it is his will it is not your thought but it's his thought are you there me because now God want to lead his children in a particular direction and so in order to do that he got to take your will out of the picture and he got to put inside of you his will and so when he comes it's not your will anymore it's the will of your father hallelujah praise God so he said I come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the will and this is the Father's will which he which has let me read that again and this is the Father's will which has sent me and all that he has given me I shall lose nothing but shall raise him up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me Hallelujah that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day Hallelujah in other word what I'm saying to you Church Hallelujah you see the scripture was written before Jes Jesus came the prophets prophesy about him and so he came down to take the will of the father of the word of God and to make every word live to materialize the word hallelujah and in that we find the church in that we find redemption in in that we find Hallelujah him paying the price for Redemption he had to die why because it's he said it's not my will but the will of the father and so that which was on the pages Church which was the will of God he came to magnify to make the word become alive so the works of Jesus was to take the word and make the word live hallelujah praise God what am I going what am I saying to you I I want to as as we go we we we break it down and you can see exactly Hallelujah the works of God is the will of God hallelujah it's not just to live a life of of of of heartly domain and all of this but it's just it's a life uh to recognize God's word and to step into the word of God and allow that word of God to unveil and to manifest from your life so if you if you believe God if you if you are chosen by God you're chosen by God for one purpose the make the word of God live in your day Hallelujah and so Jesus said The Works must be performed again in other word the will of the father must be done again Hallelujah and so what he did he comes he came down on the seal to ensure H that this the predestinated seal perform the perfect will of God hallelujah praise God in verse 40 he said and this is the the will of him that sent me that everyone that seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and high will raise him up on the last day praise God Amen Hallelujah you see Church the spirit of God only operate by the word of God hallelujah we we want to present a God that you know like this God we can he will he will do exactly any and anything no God's spirit works by his word and so all that he that was said has to be made fulfill and so if we can take over thought from just living a life of of of of of a moral life but to to keep our minds on the perfect will of God the perfect word of God and walk in that word as a if you can take the word and let the word become your your daily confession Hallelujah then listen Church God by the spirit of God we take the word that you're confessing providing it's God's word and make that word live we were told Hallelujah that he's going to take us he's going to purge us he's going to purge our lives he is going to take us out of a life of of of works that does that produce God into a life that produces God Hallelujah in other words Church your lives are under prophecy Hallelujah what God say about you H if you can believe it and walk into it what you're doing you produce God on the scene Again by the perfect will of God hallelujah praise God so the spirit of God only operate by the word of God the will of God is to fulfill the word of God oh my amen praise God I like that church because the Bible said he was wounded for transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripe we to heal that is his word and so H there got to be a bride to produce that it got to be a living reality Hallelujah it cannot stand the page if you see it as God's perfect will hallelujah praise God hallelujah so we are looking Hallelujah and God setting the stage but when he comes on the scene he comes Hallelujah to bring the believer to his perfect will Hal to make your conscience that within your soul not just an anointing Hallelujah up of of shaking and speaking in tongues and all of that but but an anointing of believing thus say the Lord hallelujah and listen what I'm saying to you and an anointing Hallelujah that caus you to walk in your daily confession in other word if God says so you just keep on confessing it and believing it even though it's not there in full manifestation but as a Believer from your heart you know it's God's word and you're going to walk in it and believe in it any hallelujah praise God hallelujah and so we find in the book of Acts Acts chapter 2 Hallelujah chapter 2 let me tell brother Mark also he gave me some real good stuff I actually meant to say that you know um uh brother Mark has another son from Jamaica I I you don't mind saying that brother praise God Amen he brother Mark is such a wonderful person amen so Acts chapter 2 now this was the day the anointing came not upon the flesh not upon the spirit but a new birth within the soul but we find something happen that Peter May mention of that spoke of the Redemption of God that will bring us back to the true path of eternal life you see when Adam let let me before I go to this hold the script scure there and let me show you exactly where where I'm going with this you see it was one word that caused us to be where we are Hallelujah and so we are we are subjected to a life of sin because of one word one word hallelujah praise God but now remember when when when when man was cast out of the garden and the Bible said and God put up CH to God the way to the Tree of Life listen there is a way back to God hallelujah there's a way to access the things of God but listen it is guarded Hallelujah by what by the the those CH beams they accept as God to to to prevent Hallelujah us in our sinle condition to access that way and so he said H in this end time God is going to restore the way back to the tree of life we are going to get that access to God and so Peter on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah in verse 22 Peter said he man of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth and man approve of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the in the midst of you as he yourself also know him being delivered by the determinate counselor and for knowledge of God he have taken and by Wicked hands of crucified and slain whom God has raised up having lose the pain of death he what the Bible said because it was not possible that it should be holding happen hallelujah what pet what Peter is saying it was not possible death could not hold him hallelujah hallelujah let me tell you let let's read on that's see what Peter said about it in verse 25 Peter said for David speaketh concerning him I fora the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I shall not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh Rest In Hope hallelujah praise God let me stop there a little bit Jesus Hallelujah went to the Grave why but said upon the strength of the scripture hallelujah praise God and so because he had a word he received something from God concerning himself he held on to it even in death Hallelujah and so when he died Hallelujah that scripture concerning himself had to be made manifested and so it wasn't his that it was the word it was what God said about him before he died Hallelujah I'm sorry if I'm shouting tonight I'm getting a little bit excited Hallelujah it was he had something he died believing something church and so when he bowed his head and said it was finished something was in his heart you know what was in his heart the prophecy concerning himself what David said about him hallelujah praise God and so when he died he knew that he was coming up because death could not hold him why because of the word hallelujah amen hallelujah praise God and so the said therefore verse 2 say therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover My Flesh Rest In Hope because thou would not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou supper thy Holy One to see corruption and I want you mark verse 28 in your Bible for thou thou Hast made known to me the way the way the way of life Hallelujah thou shall make me full of joy and countenance there is a way to life what kind of life not moreal life but eternal life the way back to eternal life hallelujah it's by the word in another word if you can hear the Eternal voice you can hold on to that voice the Bible said no matter what the circumstance is even death Hallelujah cannot hold the word it can't stay the word the word must produce according to what he says it's not dead letters church but it it is Living Word living Hallelujah scriptures and so when you take it and light it moved from just written scriptures H to Living Faith in believ in God hallelujah I hope you're following what I'm where I'm going with all of this because I'm showing you that your conscience is being purged not from dead Works Hallelujah but from living works why because you have the Living Word Hallelujah he comes on the scene Christ came on the scene to give what to give you the word why because H we got to find our way back home we got to find our way back Hallelujah and the way to life eternal life is by the word hallelujah praise God it's by the scripture theam said in message presume preach 962 he said now look he said there will be light in the evening time that is to Wren the heing the fruit can only be Wren by the light and he said and we know that and at the top of the tree the Heen light and all the rest of it but said but way back in there that predestinated word of God he said it stays there all the time because God spoke it oh my oh Church can't you see why we're happy tonight because we heard the word the predestinated word for the how we know that it lays dant until someone can catch the word but if you catch it tonight Hallelujah you know that it will lead you to the path of life it will produce God again it will bring God on the scene Hallelujah so he said he will do it no matter how many organization and things he has prun it off there will be a church without spot or wrinkle for I will restore said the Lord it has to it had got to he said what all the years that the Conqueror heated all the years that the caterpillar has heated all the years years that the denominational and suckers and thing on the tree took its fruit away it said took its Vine away took its backk away took the life out of it but I will restore for the root and The Offspring of David I will restore say the Lord said what it is he said so he predestinated it his word let there he said therefore look just exactly the way he he done it the first time he said he took John justification Jesus sanctification the church with his own blood and then the Holy Ghost come then Along come the church he said and it begin to grow oh my hallelujah oh church I believe that this is the end time I know it's the end time Church that God has given us a word a predestinated word hallelujah to bring this bride to life hallelujah praise God Amen and so in in in the book uh St John 6 and verse 43 the Bible said therefore answered and said unto them murm not among yourselves no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw in and I will raise him up on the last day so it is written in the prophets that they shall be all thought of God Heaven man therefore that has heard and have learned of the father cometh unto me oh my it said not not that any man has seen the father save he which is of god he has seen the father ver ver I say unto you he that believeth on me has everlasting life and he said and I am the bread of life they won't come unless if you first US you're drawn by God there's something I want to say to us tonight the this time is very pecul because it's not for everybody but I'm said some of the things that you hear and you know we hear it so often that we take it for granted really but some of the things that is that he said you know brother John he preached you know so so so many times a lot of these things really on the outside they wish they had somebody who could tell them what you're hearing I I make it habitual to say to them and they just can't hear but my one of my favorite vers in Revelation 1 and verse3 he said blessed is he that readeth and heareth the word of this prophecy you know just to be in church hearing it you're blessed yeah we are blessed to hear and and if you can't read it and you can't hear it you're blessed you know just to hear it right so it's not for everybody and you know I I probably will get you know I I I I know I send the link probably to some person I know they proba will ask me questions tomorrow this is the time of the Bride because when he when he comes down church he comes to do one thing he comes to separate the bride from the church what what is what is it what he is he using to doing that he's using the very word and so when they hear it to some it's an hard thing it's rough but to the elected they said to whom shall we go for you have Hallelujah the word of eternal life Hallelujah so when the anointing come church and I'm zoning into that a little bit because I want us to understand that this anointing when it comes it comes not to allow uh to make us speak in tongues and prophesy all of that is an attribute or a part of it but the anointing comes to wake up the soul to let us know that God by the word hallelujah is alive Hallelujah so under that turple anointing when he comes and the SE and we know brother bam spoke of that that he came Christ the angel the Covenant angel had descended but when he comes on the seen church and he start unveil it what it did it separated the crowd Hallelujah and only those to whom it is it is written will get the predestinated word that's one of the characteristic about this same time that is so hard that when God comes know I was talking brother Mark the day brother Mark was said sister Marina had a family for about 300 something like that and it's just she alone just one just one in my family my family is Big just one my wife we have a large family we have a large Church community just one he comes to separate the house mother from father Hallelujah daughter from son why because the word the revealed word goes in and he separate Hallelujah and when he separate Hallelujah he pulls out the predestinated seed those who are destined to hear the word of God hallelujah why is he doing that church because brother bam said because the bride in this end time got to be identified Hallelujah the church has their identity but the bride got to be identified brother bam said in the face of trumpet P 64 he said what is the true evidence Jesus said that you should believe that I am he and he isar the word it said go into the prophet's chamber you know jumping on to paragraph 112 he said and watch them seven steps that where did where did the god meet the challenge to bring the commer into the presence of the king he said at the top of the step he said was in the seventh step there he show that we got to come again with that same spirit that was on John to introduce the Messiah he said he was greater than all the prophets he introduced it and he said and he got to and we have got to come to a place again to something got to introduce the Messiah he said now how shall we oh shallot he shall appear in the last day is to bring the people back to the world so that the bride will know her husband he said to know her mate the reveal word he said why this has to happen he said going on to paragraph uh 114 he said it it wasn't in the reformer it wasn't in Luther Wesley and the Pentecost p Castor and then the scripture said it wasn't it said but it will come that that is is promise for this age we are living in the age of his coming will be in he said she must be identified in him and said any man must be identified with her husband for the two are one Christ bride has to be identified with him for the who are one and he is the word not the denomination the word is that we are to be Children of the light and the light is the word which is made manifested for this age said how do we know light except it comes from the word is it all right the word made flesh is the light of the H when and you can see it and the Bible says so Hallelujah she must be identified and so listen Church Hallelujah in the midst of all of this in all of this chaos in all of this darkness in all of this Pentecostal age where where there's so much prophet and all of that Hallelujah and so much prophesying and all of that but God said there got to be a bride and she must be identified how by the word hallelujah so he gave her his word when when he comes to her he comes to her in the secret of theah to do what to put in her his word and so Hallelujah and so she and him become one by the word hallelujah and so we saw the in in in Jesus time he fulfilled the word concerning his day what about our day church we are called to make the word live and to produce God again Hallelujah behind skin hallelujah how will that be done it will be done by the word by the scripture she hears the word because he is the word hallelujah praise God and so church this is a season of identification all are being identified with their se but the bride is identified with the word of God hallelujah praise God hallelujah and so the word through her must produce the perfect work of God our conscience must produce H the perfect work of God by the word Hal and it takes God on the scene to do that hallelujah praise God Amen brother Ram said in the message the Third Exodus PRI 1963 he said under the organization live lously live as a grafted Branch into the real Vine of Christianity but it's still bearing its original Fruit women off dressed men intellectual denying the power of the spirit but it live under the name of Christian Church it's a it's grafted Vine but the husband man is coming by now to pume the vine oh God he's working on me church is is work is trans transform the man that I am how is he doing that is revealing himself to me by the word and so when I see that word I take Faith in that word believing that that's God's word and I believe that I can live it how you doing me Church Hallelujah probably not in its full manifestation but I identify that that's God word and if that's God's word it got to be made manifested Hallelujah are you there the church that's the bride identity is to take what he say and believe it and walk into it as our daily confession believing that it is his word hallelujah praise God so the fruit Hallelujah from the vine hallelujah oh the fruit was from you know was was to bring uh the life of God was to produce that fruit Hal by the word hallelujah praise God which you know it was showing that the soul is converted you know the soul has made contact with the Eternal the soul is made Alive by the scripture hallelujah praise God and so he's puning in the Lord he's changing he's working on me how it it it brings you into situation sometimes to see how your faith how would you deal with it concerning what he say and so sometime in the M sickness comes on the picture what do you do do you walk away do do you say Lord I cannot walk Hallelujah but Peter said Hallelujah Lord to whom shall we go when situation arises do you mean does that mean that I'm not going to go church and I'm no you keep on walking because you know we we always say this brother John like Sunday morning you know we we we we decid that I I'm not going to church anymore but you know what suay morning you know I asked myself the question what do I do Sunday morning I used to be in church Sunday morning so if I decided I'm not no longer going to walk my Sunday morning will be empty so I have to be here because being here it's my fulfill my fulfillment it's my joy to be here in the presence of the Lord so I can't go anywhere there's nowhere else to go this is my joy this this is where we sing and we we we dance and we we we shout and we say hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen praise God but he's working he's bringing my faith Hallelujah and we're going to look on that a little bit tonight to see how he's working on me how he's bringing my faith by the perfect work Hallelujah into the full manifestation of his presence you see we are under prophecy church we are called to do do something that it it has never been done to this magnitude before but we are called to do it and God comes on the scene and he working behind the scene not just an anointing upon the flesh or anointing upon the the spirit but he's anointing the soul he's bringing the soul alive to his word and so he brings you in situation sometime to see what you will do really accepting you believing we you keep on walking no matter what let me say this no matter what keep your faith in God one of your greatest achievement is not the big houses is not the money in the banket there not nothing like but really it is your faith in God Hallelujah the greatest accomplishment and so we are called to to to fulfill that really and so in St John 15 and verse 16 the Bible said he have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordain you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that your fruit shall remain in other word hallelujah The Works that is produced H remember let me take it back again Hallelujah to what the Bible said uh Peter 1 Peter one the Bible said Hallelujah we are born again not by corruptible seed the Bible said the grass withth the flower fadeth in other word hallelujah only the word of God hallelujah last stands forever and so everything else fail Church everything else will go but only the word of God will stand forever and so if your fruits are being remained it means that H the only thing that can remain is the word of God why because the word of God is eternal Hallelujah and so if you have the Eternal Word it means that the fruits that produces as a result of that Hallelujah of that word inside of you it will not diminish or perish but it remains Str it lasts forever The Works Hallelujah will last forever it will not diminish that your fruit should remain but whatsoever you ask the father in my name Hallelujah he may give it to you also jump quickly and this is these are like some of my favorite scriptures you know Psalms 1 Hallelujah this is brother brother you know he spoke of this when he and he preached on the restoration of the brid tree Psalms 1 he said blessed is the man that walth not in the Council of the ungodly that's standeth in the way of The Sinner nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night hallelujah amen get myself right he said and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and that bring forth his fruit Hallelujah in his season Hallelujah brother said it's not our fruit but if you're planted by the rivers of water if Christ is living there he said you're going to produce fruit uh but not your fruit uh it's not your works but him that dwelleth in you and brother said he Hallelujah you will produce the works of God his works his fruit in his season you know brother B went as far as saying this I don't have the quote here better said that the season when the prophet is here in know word there's going to come a a time again when the perfect fruits of God the perfect work of God will be produced again you see church we have lived in this Mortal life so long we we accept the Mortal condition and we believe and we see it and we accept it but now in this transition God made known to us the perfect word and so little by little as you hear it bit by bit as you believe it we are being changed hallelujah it's like you're being resurrected again to the word of God and he said hey I didn't know I could do this but here am I I'm standing here Hallelujah by the grace of God are you there my church and you see more and more of God it's like you're being changed into the image little by little the Bible said from Glory unto Glory he's changing you what he's doing he's working on your faith is changing the works by your faith and he's bringing your faith into the perfect fate of God to reflect God again by his perfect work by the scripture Hallelujah B said from the message uh from that time preached 1960 he said and when the church come together in the Resurrection The Same Spirit Hallelujah was in Jesus Christ that was torn out of him will come will have to be in the church you can't copy anything like it you can't make nothing different from it it got to be the same holy spirit that dwell in Christ and when the Rapture comes when the body comes is bride he said that was tored from him oh the Holy Ghost will bring the the bride just exactly D tail right into the body of Jesus Christ and said and and can you see from the days of Luther to Wesley to Pentecost it said and now at the end time oh that spirit is shaping up Hallelujah it said the same sign and wonders that he got on the hurt is being done in the church today said it's that Covenant that God made with Abraham and we are Abraham's children being dead in Christ he said we take on Abraham's seed and we are here according to the promise he said and from that time Hallelujah the church had a covenant say yes it was a it was different Hallelujah now in referencing the Covenant brother bam said Hallelujah we are a covenanted people because God is a covenanted God and so the works the promise of perfection the promise of God coming and living on the inside is by A Perfect promise Hallelujah It Is by The Covenant that that he gave to Abraham now I like to quickly brushing that a little bit the Covenant that he gave to Abraham because if if it is by the Covenant God is bringing Perfection then it means that that Covenant got to be perfect Hallelujah it got to be a perfect Covenant Church so we saw under the first we know this under the first Covenant when God gave it you know to to the the human race Hallelujah God set it on a on a condition the condition was that if you do this then I will do this in other word God was requiring work but the work was not the work of God is just your work upon your own morality because we were made free moral agency but we find one thing not no matter what church once the works is been done by our Humanity it brings imperfection are you there me church and so God knows that church God knows that we can't do it by ourself and so he comes to Abraham and gave him a new covenant and the New Covenant is it's not Hallelujah but if you do this and and I will do but no no no God said I have already done it Hallelujah in other word church by this New Covenant God take the empasis of what you can do for yourself and God is saying that I have already done it Hallelujah I've already done it for you and I'm come down to do it through you can I tell you something beautiful beautiful tonight and the Bible said and The Works were already done before the foundation of the world before we got here The Works was already done there's not there's no new works there's nothing there's no sickness there's nothing there in other world when God see you Hallelujah he seeing you through the Covenant and the Covenant is perfect what is the Covenant it is the blood he's seeing it through the blood and so when he seed you to the blood is seeing his predestinated part oh my oh my Len what I'm saying to you Church you see on the Eternal side Hallelujah all is perfect there's no weakness there's no sugar diabetes there's no high blood pressure how you there church God is seeing a perfect reflection of you it's perfect on his side the works is already done it's perfect oh my it's already done hallelujah and so in order to to transfer that it takes it that's why he came himself to take the work of us and bring it on to himself so we say it is his life it's his death it's his healing his resurrection his power his love his saving grace everything that we have belongs to him is what he had done for me while I'm standing here I'm rejoicing because of what he has done it's not my works but his Works in other word hallelujah oh my can I show you church that the works that he's revealing to you is the works Hallelujah that was already done he's revealing to you perfect work Hallelujah and so the Covenant is to take it off over humanity and bring it unto God himself there can be no failure in this there can be no DET there can be no Heil there can be nothing Hallelujah because God himself is saying hallelujah but I have done it for you and through you Hallelujah Hallelujah so the Covenant is God hallelujah praise God is is is the one that is doing the doing it for us so Ence we saw under this New Covenant he gave his own blood he became that perfect sacrifice Hallelujah you see all that God has been doing have been doing really to purge our conscience by its own blood what's the blood brother said the blood is the word and so what he's doing he's revealing his word to us that by faith we will see and and believe that word and step into it but it's not just words of time in other word church there got to come a time where we move out of this time domain boundary and we step into a Heavenly atmosphere where where our faith catches the Heavenly things and so it changed our walk it changed the manner of our dress sisters we we we we we we live lives unhe hurt but reflecting another do Dominion we are here in this life but we're we're we're producing works from Another Life From Another Dimension hallelujah praise God oh my so the the Covenant brought us back to the Eternal world where there's no sin there's no fault it took us back to the Eternal thoughts of God and in those thoughts God is seeing his children perfect so when you look upon us tonight's CH he only see us through the perfect blood of Christ Hallelujah and The Works according to his word are already completed perfect hallelujah we're getting there and so you know brother Mark sent me this I had actually asked him for an extract from uh from Divine Healing I think uh this was one of interview by sister I don't remember her name yes but this was an interview done by Brother Bron you know um while she was in in in the hospital and gam said some things to her you know I'm going to read it here brother bam said I'm fixing to pray for you I am not worthy of that I think he said what what would I do if Jesus Christ was sitting here now he said and what would he do if he was sitting here he lay his hands upon you and with his great fith see you you get well so well I think well I am I am a sinner I'm not him but I come to represent him he said but remember me being a sinner and before God I'm he said I'm not a sinner I am not a sinner neither are you he said we got a blood sacrifice laying there that God don't even see us wow he said he hears our voice but he sees the blood of of Christ he said that's it he saids see he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ blood then it's Christ that talk through us to God so therefore we are not Sinners no more Hallelujah we are he said we are Christian I believe you to be a genine Christian woman it's through the blood the blood the sacrifice is perfect in other word hallelujah you see one of us struggle and I'm going on the contrast because there's something I need to show you before I close right on the contrast is that there is a perfect blood that speaks perfectly for our perfect atonement but you know what church I find that while we live in these mortal bodies we struggle we we we get sick we find ourselves struggling and we said Lord how what what is happening because the sacrifice is perfect there's not one sick person here tonight not one if we accept the word that Jesus said that 2,000 years ago every sickness was healed every dead was raised everything that needed to be accomplished was accomplished in other word the atonement speak perfectly for Perfection but here we are some of us have to go to the doctor some of us feel pain all over does that mean that the sacrifice has imperfection no let me show you something and I I never saw this until you know I started studying you see to wake up your conscience to bring really God already knows the end he sees the end but he knows where you're at right now so while in our soul we we are not from this realm we're in another world but in our bodies we are still here and so God had to made provision for that but while in our mortal state in our mortal weakness Hallelujah God can give us a petition of overcoming so God I'm going to quote it but uh Genesis 15 and verse 8 the Bible said and God said and he said Lord God where by shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said unto him take me in effer that's a perfect atonement Now take me an eer of threey old and a she go threey old and a around 3 years old and he said and a turtle above hallelujah what was that Turtle love brother bam said it was for healing oh my brother Mark healing the Covenant is perfect but God put healing in that perfect Covenant because he knows hallelujah our mortal State why we live in these bodies of humiliation there will be instances that hallah our faith will not be fully surrendered to God's perfect word and do you know that if in one instance if you fail to believe it bring us right back to where you are in the first place debt Hallelujah sin will produce unbelief will produce thatt but he knows that church and so what did he do he put healing in the Covenant hallelujah praise God but when you find yourself in a situation when your life begins struggling when you start find yourself Hallelujah in a state with a sickness or whatever remember this that God God placed healing in the Covenant he took in consideration your sickness Hallelujah he take in consideration that there are times you will not obey the word he knows that is go where you get it from listen Jonah God gave him the perfect word and he should have gone to nineve and speak it that was God's perfect will but what did he do he took a ship and went the total opposite direction that was total SC disregard and because of that he should have died the consequence to his action should have produced that but God in his Sovereign Grace Hallelujah God would have wanted his son his children to obey him by his perfect will but but God saw Hallelujah his servant stepping into his permissive well but brother said but even him Hallelujah his own permissive well God will bring forth his perfect will who did know that there was a whale waiting there to swallow Jonah Hallelujah you know the Bible said the Bible said God prepare a special fish God knew until God make provision for for it did not stop or prevent the word from going forth no way do you know when when Abraham lied he should have died right there do you know when Sarah Li she should have died right there but the grace of God stepped in because God made provision for his church hallelujah hallelujah God make provision for our lives he make provision for a situation he knows and so he put the turn of Love butam said what he did the priest would have would have had like two turtled up and he would pull the head off one and and turn it upside down and and the blood from that one will drip on the other one and he baath that one with the blood and then he released it and wherever it goes it take the blood Hallelujah church God has given us eternal love Hallelujah of Divine Healing hallelujah what am I saying Church you see Hallelujah God through the position of Divine Healing you see brother Mark when we speak of healing you know we say that Hallelujah when you're sick you're healed but remember now that's why we say under the tpol it must produce healing in abundance in a way that we have never experienced before because we saw the first anointing What It Did It produced healing by the works but it could not bring Perfection no sir the second brought forth healing but it could not produce Perfection it's the brother gospel where did you get that Lazarus was healed from Death he died and he was healed but he was healed to die again oh my Hallelujah and so Hallelujah the production or this healing that God is producing Hallelujah the works it's it's transforming us from The Works Hallelujah of of from God's Own Works inside of us and it's producing Hallelujah healing in a way Hallelujah in abundance into Perfection church is changing us is transforming us and so in this age hallelujah praise is God he's producing that healing brother bam let me quote here quickly brother bam said um the message Abraham preached 1956 he said no Divine Healing is not on the same basis as salvation the Divine Healing was included in the atonement truly is that the all atonement had Divine Healing and the new one is much better than the old one so if it is better better it got to be better in every way but Divine Healing salvation of the soul and you're becoming a new creature it's a eternal life you don't have eternal Health by healing but he said but it's an attribute it's he said it's an Earnest of your Resurrection it's a it's a if there is no Divine Healing then there is no Resurrection he says see but now he said what is it it said it's your personal faith I'm going to end with this part tonight he said it is your personal faith in the finished work of Calvary oh my church Hallelujah you see there's a part that we still got to do Hallelujah and all God is requiring to bring us there is to accept his word by faith Hallelujah accept his word by faith it produces Church it makes alive it it brings us why because when your faith is anchored on the Eternal Word it produces it changes the atmosphere it changes our body it changes our experience it Chang Our Lives it brings us from our mortal condition Hallelujah into God's True Divine Healing Hallelujah and he changing me it's producing the work he raising me up again my conscience is being resurrected from dead Works to serve the Living God Hallelujah the word is producing itself Hallelujah but all is asking to the process of healing is not to walk away but to accept what he says and no matter what but believe it and watch God brings it to pass you know I while I Was preparing I I thought you know something came to Brother John you know I remember the the other day when you were preaching and you mentioning of sister Justine you know when she had that condition and she walked up you know if a medical doctor was there they would have called us cuckoo there's no medical referal there's no there's no reference there's nothing there you can use to explain what happened you know all she did that something in our heart come on church was calling her back to the Eternal things to an eternal condition where she's being raised from her dead work hallelujah what is calling her her conscience is calling her back to the Eternal world to bring her back to her Eternal estate H she listen when when it happened Church the resurrecting power of God hallelujah was was calling her to bring a change you know I think I was here the day when she came and she held her hand up and she was prayed for listen church I can't explain to you the mechanics I can't really Hallelujah but I know this that if God put something on your heart and you walk up Hallelujah and believe that Hallelujah Church it produces I'm saying to you when I was younger I I I was you know when I was about AG 13 medically but there was no cure we did everything everything possible there was nothing I mean for I here a half I was I was sick I couldn't walk on the road I could not go to school every Saturday every weekend we were at the doctor trying to get some help and my mom she was totally frustrated because you know we were living kind of real rough life back home and all of that and and and so man I just and but I knew that God could do this church and so at age3 hallelujah praise God you know I I I had a little bible a little New Testament Bible I had it and I remember you know when I started feeling sick I don't know who tell me to do it I just tried it and I believe that something was happening when when I do it right but I took the Bible and I had the Bible under my clothes and I open the Bible I don't remember which Psalms I had it to but I had the word under my and my skin and so when I feel sick I squeeze the Bible because I believe that something from the Bible can be transferred into my skip you know what church it works every time I did that I started feeling better hallelujah hallelujah do I I can't explain to you the mechanics but you know what my mom I decided you know I got baptized in the Pentecostal church back home and to week after she got a dream she saw me I was dring I was fell in into a foring it was very turbulent and all of that and I was drowning and when she told me the dream she said while I was there you know fell in the water she said a guy was passing and he saw me and he jumped in the water and he saved me and she said that you know you know yes the guy saved you and you know what church I was sick one and a a here and a half one here in six months my mom told me that she gave up She Was preparing for funeral She Was preparing to put me under right but you know when she told me that dream I said yes that's what I was waiting for and church from that day I keep on confessing Hallelujah I Keep On Believing and church from that day that was what almost 35 30 something years ago that sickness could not it never bother me hallelujah what am i showing you Church Hallelujah but when the word comes alive in your heart it is producing not dead Works uh but living works it producing life work uh it's bringing you back to your Eternal side uh where God can live in you and make manifest uh it can bring his Word Alive in your heart it's not dead letter stretch but it is a Living Word uh living power living Resurrection God again coming by the word uh to live to his people hallelujah praise God hallelujah praise God and from that time my life has never been the same you know every time when I get sick I I I keep on reminding remember

and everyone in a special way we're going to be we come in here with the right attitude like brother brand said you come and pray up and believing and ready to worship and he said there's no telling what God will do that you for sure you won't go out the same as when you came in that's the truth and it's it's happened to me so many times by the grace of God coming in here and not feeling well brother John mentioned this on on Sunday so I just you said I should testify about it so but just very briefly is uh I you know it's been many times over the 45 years that I've done this that I my body did not want to come to church and it didn't only come my spirit did spirit is willing right but there's times when I you know i' be up here with the flu but God put it this way I had a posted
