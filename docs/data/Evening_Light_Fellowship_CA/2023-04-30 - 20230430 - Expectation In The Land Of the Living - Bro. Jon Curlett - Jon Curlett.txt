[Music] Jesus [Music] Jesus Jesus Jesus let all Heaven and Earth Proclaim foreign [Music] but there's something about that name [Music] Heavenly Father Lord we're supposed to gather where you placed your name and Lord we've come in under that lovely name of Jesus Christ this afternoon Lord and we've come to worship your name we've come to lift you up Lord we've come to magnify you you we've come to glorify you Lord we've come to thank you for your goodness and Grace Lord we've come to thank you for a word that you've given us Lord we've come to thank you for the faith that you've given us but Lord We've Come Again crying out in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord for a greater portion this morning Lord for a greater Faith a greater rest a Greater Joy a greater love in our lives Heavenly Father Lord that you would show yourself manifest Lord in a greater way in our lives and we would greater reflect you Lord that we would be more surrendered than we've ever been Lord and that you would have a greater victory in our life nor would you just touch us this morning encourage us through the preaching of your word Lord lift up feeble knees Lord and hands that are hanging down lord may you just drive every evil thought and depression Lord from Minds Lord May every sickness be healed this morning we pray Lord have your way with your people we ask we're inviting you now to take hold of this service Lord may you just speak to hearts and souls Lord Jesus we pray Lord and when we go out Lord may we just have that seal of God more firmly embedded Lord may we know who we are Lord may we know our purpose and our calling and may we go forth with joy to do it we pray and Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen and amen amen God bless you 'll turn the scriptures to Psalm 27 and then certainly wants to be in prayer for the special meetings coming up next week it's been a long time and I'm certainly an expectation for those things so remember brother Dwayne and they'll be coming and having a bit of an anniversary time and then he's going to be preaching right after that so we want to remember him and his wife sister Connie Rhonda remember Sister Betty of course as well she's going to be starting her radiation treatments this week and then her surgery has been moved up to May 11th so we we definitely want to remember her in prayer over the coming days that the Lord would just settle her heart and settle her her soul and he would heal her body amen that's what we're looking for amen God bless you it's good to see brother and sister cater here this morning amen good to have each one that's with us Psalm 27 and verse 13 says I had fainted unless I have believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning amen I had read this scripture I believe in the in the last service and and I've had I've had this on my heart for quite some time and I wasn't sure where I was going to kind of fit it or when it would be ministered and I thought perhaps I just tied into Redemption and kind of stick with our our series that we've been doing on but just as I've been going through this week and dealing with some things and it's been a bit of a rough week for me and and I was just asking the Lord for kind of a word to help me in a word to help the church and and and so this is this is what he's laid on my heart this morning so so it's it's for all of us I believe this morning I want to preach on this and it's expectation in the land of the living amen David's words in Psalm 27 are are used to preach that message the Rapture if you know this was brother branham's scripture for when he preached the Rapture and and we tend to go there because we've been given a rapturing message and that's where we focus on it but but David wasn't looking for a rapture that was not for David's day and that's what not what David was speaking about we know he did it and he does these things prophetically and he's under inspiration to do it but there's an inspiration for for where he was at that day and there's an inspiration for where we're at today amen and we can take inspiration for his situation for our situation and then take it all the way but the brother Branham took it to the Rapture but David wasn't looking for a Rapture that day David was looking for God to be real that day in his situation and in his life amen David was dealing with things in his everyday life and that's what psalms 27 was about for David was David was seeking a God that was going to deliver him and preserve him and do all of these different things and David was looking for God to be real to him that day David wasn't just looking for a god of tomorrow and he wasn't just dwelling on a god of yesterday but he was looking for a God that was with him today present in his need present in his trial present in his battle amen listen David needed peace that day David needed protection that day because people were trying to kill him people were seeking his life people were trying to take what he had in that day amen and David didn't need peace for the sunny days David needed peace for the storm that he was in and that's what we sometimes forget is is we can put God for the always in the forward and always in the future and not recognize that he has promised to be here with us in the midst of our trial in the midst of our everyday lives and the situations we're going through and the difficulties we face and and in in the persecution even that we face he's promised to be here in the midst of it and David was saying Lord I need you right now Lord I need you in my situation right now but I want you to look at how David starts Psalms 27 and we'll read a portion of it this morning but he said because if you can start the way David starts then you'll finish the way David finished can I put it that way amen if you can catch the inspiration if you can catch the drive of David's life in this moment then you're going to get the same results that David did and David says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid now it's easy to say he's the Lord of your light and he's the Lord of your salvation but then David says he's the strength of my life not just the strength of my trouble not just the strength of my battle but he says he is the Lord of my life and he's what keeps me going he's got to be Lord he can't just be savior he's got to be Lord he's got to be in the middle of everything he's got to be welcome in every room of your life and when he's welcome in every room then he is Lord he's not just savior but he's working in the midst of it David knew who kept him alive David knew who allowed him to wake up in the morning and go to bed in the evening David knew who had anointed him David knew who was leading him David knew who was guiding him David knew who was protecting him and he said it is the Lord not just God but he said the Lord he is in my life and he is controlling my life and these different things I want to ask you who is your light who is your salvation who is your strength this morning because is it you every day and then when the battle comes up it becomes the Lord or is it the Lord all day every day in every situation in every aspect in everything you come up to is he Lord or is he just the god of the time when you need him because of his only Lord some of the times he's not Lord at all he's got to be in every aspect of Our Lives amen where do you go you say I he is my Lord Brother brother John if he's your lord then where do you go when you're maxed out do you go to him or do you go to something else do you go to some other thing do you go to entertainment do you go to old relationships do you go to Old Friends do you go to the world and the things of the world or do you go to your Lord because he's been with you all along and say I need you now Lord I need you now Lord where do you go and it seems like you're surrounded and you can't get a break is he with you in that moment because he's been with you all along or do you have to go seek him because he's not a part of your life every single day David would say in Psalm 61 he would say Hear My Cry Oh God attend unto my prayer from the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I for thou Hast David speaking from experience here he's not saying I believe you will be or I believe that you could be but he says you have been you have been a shelter for me you've been a strong tower from the enemy and he says I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust in the covert of thy wings what is the Tabernacle it's the dwelling place of God it's where God has put his name it is his word but not just his word this way but it's got to be his word this way as well it's his word and his flesh amen it's the word in you and I that is the Tabernacle of God that's when he's your lord is when he is tabernacled inside of you amen David want to be where God was not just where the word was in terms of of the scripture or these things but he wanted to go to the person of his protection the person of his strength the person of his life David wanted Above All Else relationship he wanted to be with God and he said that's where I'm going I want to be in your Tabernacle forever I want to be where you are and that was his Guiding Light his guiding principle when you're overwhelmed where do you go do you know that he has been a shelter and therefore he will be a shelter or is it just an experiment you're trying for the first time or that you run to occasionally when things get so bad that you don't think you can go anywhere else David said there's there's a place that's higher than me there's a place that's stronger than me there's a place that's more deeply founded than I am there's a place where I can go and I can rest and it doesn't move it doesn't move come hell or high water come storm or rain or wind whether it's an enemy whether it's situations whatever it might be when I go to that place I know I'm safe he said he hides me in the cleft of The Rock amen is that what he is to you amen is he a rock and a weary land is he a water is he a source of water in a dry land is he a foundation in the storm amen is he peace when all around you is Raging that's what David said he was David knew what it was like to be in trials and battles and he knew that there was a place of peace and rest in all of those situations amen I think David knew better than anyone else in the scripture what it meant to be run around run ragged we would say today for 15 years David was run ragged through no Faults of his own through no fault of his own and then when he ever did run into an enemy he had to what be able to not kill him because Saul was his enemy not of David's choosing but if Saul's choosing but every time Saul came after him all David could do is try and disengage and keep from hurting that man talk about a tricky task talk about a tricky task when you're trying not to hurt somebody that's intent on destroying you that was David's life for 15 years trying not to hurt what he considered to be God's anointed what a place but watch how David talks I'm trying to encourage you this morning I want you to see the pattern of a person that has rest and peace and also the overcomer so if we look back in Psalms 27 he said when the wicked even mine enemies in my phone Came Upon me to eat my flesh so he's pointing to his past David has a testimony David has a testimony that people tried to do bad stuff to him he says they tried to eat up my flesh this isn't just an enemy that's content on killing you but they want to destroy and remove every evidence that you were ever there in the first place as if out in the in in the wilderness you know maybe a bear would kill you and then eat you completely and they don't know what happened to you he says that's the kind of enemies that came upon me they tried to remove me from this Earth but I want you to see because listen we're in a fight it's not wrong to say you've got enemies it's not wrong to say that you've got battles it's not wrong to say I'm in a struggle for my health I'm in a struggle for my marriage I'm in a struggle for my finances I'm in a struggle for my kids I'm in a struggle for a relationship I'm in a struggle inwardly and nobody knows about it it's okay to say you've got enemies but listen to what David said he said they stumbled and fell I did just fine I made it through not because of me because he's pointing to a rock he's pointing to a place of rest now he comes to verse three because he's letting his past shape his future in terms of his faith in God he says though and hosts should encamp against me so he says if they come I'm not going to worry about it God God help me in the past God's going to help me in the future amen ever feel like you're surrounded ever feel like there's a battle no matter wherever you face this is your scripture he says though a whole should against me a camp about me though an army surrounds me he says my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will I be confident listen you're going to be in a war if you're not in it today you're going to be in it tomorrow and if not tomorrow the next day we're in a battle and we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers you're in a struggle so guess what if you're not encamped about today you are going to be tomorrow or the next day so this is for you he says in this will I be confident brother Brown says this he says all we say we have faith we have love but if we had love we'd have faith for he says that is perfect love casteth out fear all fear all fear and when fear is gone faith is perfect you're scared he won't keep his word he says but I believe he does he would go on in the message faith is a substance and say now love one another above everything that you do love one another remember they asked Jesus what is the first what are the what is the main command he says love the Lord thy God with all their hearts soul mind and strength and he said the second is just like it love your neighbor as yourself he said by this shall all men know you that you are my disciples if you have loved one for another he says above everything you do love one another and as you love one another you'll love God for God is love listen to this and a man that walks in Love Walks In life and perfect love casteth out all fear then if you can take him at his word and not fear a bit about it he says say Lord I love you I know you're going to answer because you promised me you would and I just know you're going to do it he says see and it takes away all fear what David was saying in this scripture and what this quote is saying is if you're assured of God's love towards you you can go through anything because you know that he is with you and that nothing can touch you and nothing can get into your life and nothing can come against you except he allows it he said if you're assured that God loves you then you can face anything he says in your walk in life then because you are sure of that perfect love husbands let me talk to you this morning if you can love your wife that way she'll trust you the way we ought to trust God but if she ever thinks that your love is selfish in any way it draws her trust away from you and she can't trust your motives and she'll struggle to obey she'll struggle to catch the vision she'll struggle to do those things if she feels your love for yourself is overshadowed by overshadows your love for her then she's not going to trust anything you do so we've got to what we've got to bring her to a place where she believes that our love is for her is our greatest motive is our great is our driving force in the things that we do listen I've had to deal with this myself in my own marriage I've had to I've had to stand up and say you've got to buckle down you've got to be less selfish you've got to step up to the plate and start showing her that you're in it for her and not just for you and that's what David's saying is if you don't believe God's in it for you you're never going to have faith but he's in it for you he is in it for you we've got to know that but he's saying if you can trust his love if you can catch a revelation of his love he says faith will follow right behind it because he says faith and love go together that's what he's looking at amen listen whether you've got a a sickness in your life an addiction you got Financial issues you've got relationship issues you've got to be convinced first of all that Christ loves you and then you'll have faith that he's going to move in the situation amen listen we fight shame we fight shame we've got besetting sins in our lives and we've got little habits that we have and we've got these little things that get into our life and maybe they've been there for a very long time but we what we don't want to bring those things out and we don't even want to bring them to God because we're ashamed but listen while we were yet sinners he loved us God doesn't care about that God doesn't care about that what he cares is will you come back to him will you go talk to him The Prodigal Son remember brother John and he's talked about it he said when he came to himself he came home and where was the father the father saw him a far way off he was looking for him to come back not to judge him but to welcome him to wrap him in the robe and put on a ring of a merited Grace on his hand and welcome him back into the home yes he had lost something yes that son never got the inheritance that he should have gotten he burned it all he'd wasted it but he was back in the family and the father was waiting to welcome him home listen you're in his life you're in his presence you're you're sitting under the preaching of the word you're committed to Christ and yet we hold back due to shame we hold back due to embarrassment about these things go to him that's what he's there to Deliver Us from look at that woman at the well what did he do to the woman at the well you talk about a woman that could be embarrassed and all he did was he turned it around and he gave her the husband that she had really needed all along what was it it was Christ the word and she was changed from that day forward he didn't focus on her shame he focused on I've got something to take away your shame I've got a drink that'll satisfy your thirst for your life amen listen the question that comes up often though is why are you seeking God's help in the first place brother Brown says it matters it matters why you want your healing it matters why you want Deliverance because the human nature is always to avoid pain and so what we want is our pain taken away but we don't want to do what God wants us to do so many times we can't come to God and say take away my pain God's not there to take away your pain he's there to root out the issue and that will resolve the pain we take painkillers don't we you know you go for surgery you you have a toothache you do those things and they give you a painkiller to take you through it but the thing is what you need is you need to get that tooth out you need to have that surgery to deal with it and until that is resolved you'll always have that toothache you can take the painkiller and it will take away the pain for a while but that's going to keep coming back and it's going to keep getting worse and worse until the painkillers won't work anymore and then you're gonna have to get desperate and say Lord I need this tooth taken out I need this issue taken out of my life and that's when he starts to come in is when you say Lord I need the resolution to the problem not just a bandage I need to really get down into my life and have you do these things look at look at David's motive for this he says one thing one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple David had one desire one motive one purpose and that was to be in the presence of God and that is his greatest desire and he says everything I'm asking you the Lord is so that I can be in your presence that I can worship you that I can glorify you that was his passion David was in it for God not in it for David listen David's early reputation if you read in the Scripture it says that David he grew in stature and he grew in favor with men and these things and it was because he of his going in and is coming out and what it meant was David could go into the presence of God and he would stay there till he found the will of God for the people and for the Army and then he'd go out and he would do it and God would always bless him in it because he had stayed and he had gotten in God's presence and found God's Will and so David developed a reputation for perfect leadership why because David wasn't in it for David David was in it to deliver the people from their enemies he wasn't in it to develop a reputation he was in it to to to take the Philistines out of the land and these different things so David was used because he would go in and find the will of God and submit to that no matter what it looked like and that's what built David's reputation was not that he was the world's best warrior though he was a great warrior but that he could find the will of God every single time without fail that was David's passion he says one thing of our desire that I may dwell in the house of the Lord but I'm going to jump to our opening scripture just for the sake of time so we can get into this whole thing more deeply and he says I had fainted unless I would have fainted unless I have believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living He says wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord you take it to the Amplified and it says what would have become of me had I not believed you know what God still would have saved David if he hadn't believed God still would have delivered David except unless if he hadn't believed but you know what David would have been miserable the entire time because God's going to take care of his children but you can arrive at the end with a peace that passes all understanding or you can arrive they're stressed out and worn out and fractured and brittle you're going to get there no matter what God's going to get you across the Finish Line it's already a done deal but you can get there in his place or you can get there in your mind and in your failures and in your flaws and in your nature David said if I hadn't believed what would have happened to me he'd have been a wreck it was tough enough as it was but he says had I not believed that I would see the Lord's goodness in the land of the living wait and hope for and expect the Lord be brave and of good courage and let your heart be Stout and enduring yes wait for and hope for and expect the Lord listen David's Faith was that there was a supernatural God there's a supernatural Lord in his life that could help him today and that if it wasn't going to be then it was going to be tomorrow and if it wasn't tomorrow is the next day David had an expectation that God would move in the land of the living that means here that means where we are now that doesn't mean that David was putting everything off till heaven or David was putting everything off to the marriage supper of the Lamb or the resurrection or the Rapture but he said he is a god of the living and he's in my life and I have an expectation that he's going to move where I've asked them to because my motive is to be with him because my desire is to be with him amen he does he says it's it's not that that David says it's not that we won't overcome it doesn't mean we won't see God move he says I'm expecting God to move here and now that he is a God right now he's an on-time God in these things yes I believe in a resurrection yes I believe in a Rapture but I believe he's given us something to have while we're here as well that he's given us something to take us through this day-to-day life amen I don't want to put it off to be on the curtain of time if he's promised it for here let's not be so spiritual that we can't apply the word and expect it in our natural lives today amen listen God hasn't promised us a bed of ease but he has promised us he'd take us through and he give us something that would take us through our lives and we could come through with a sane mind and a sound body and with a healthy relationship with our spouse and with kids that are saved with new generations in our church that we can be fed by the word of God that we can see the supernatural in our midst that's what he has promised us not all for the future but he gave us a word for this journey the word is for here the word is for now amen I was reading in Hebrews 11 and brother Kingsley was talking to me about this brother Kings it was so funny after Thursday I went there and Friday morning my devotions it was Hebrews 11 right where you've been talking to me about so I'm preaching out of Hebrews 11 this morning we know this is the faith chapter but this is what this looks like because we're looking for big things but big things happen in small steps and you've got to be able to see the small steps you've got to be able to recognize the small steps you've got to be able to say that's God even though it's not the full picture you can see that's God moving and I want you to us to see what this looks like because it's so small so many times listen it says by faith faith is what we need we've got to believe we've got to have a revelation that what we are resting on today is truth and it is life and it will take us all the way across he says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether we went now I preached extensively on Abraham's Covenant so I'm not going to go into it but his Covenant was that God said is I'm going to take you and I'm going to make you a great nation I'm going to give you a land for that Nation but then he also said I'm going to be your God and you're going to be my people so there was a natural and there was a supernatural now it was going to take the supernatural to get the natural but then there's a supernatural to get the supernatural as well if I could put it that way but then he says by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise so he's walking around in something that will belong to them but doesn't yet belong to them so he's it's theirs by promise but it's not theirs by possession yet but they're walking around in it they can literally see the land of promise but they don't possess it they're in it and they're blessed in it but they don't possess it yet why it says for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder maker is god listen this really sets the tone for our expectation for this life because we expect God to do things here because he promised to do things here but our great expectation is in glory our great expectation is in a body change our great expectation is in a Rapture it's not just here so he said Abraham was not consumed with a natural land but he was looking for a land that would not fade away whose foundations were built by God who's whose maker was God his Focus was on the Eternal but he was still in the natural believing in the promise of God we've got to be able to hold those two things in our mind and in our lives and say Lord I'm believing for you here and I'm believing for you there he says through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised Sarah was 90 years old when she had Isaac and Sarah had to have a body change before she could have him she went from old and wrinkly to a 20-something year old she went from old and Haggard to Young and the prettiest woman in the Kingdom listen plastic surgery has got nothing on God when God wants to make a change he makes a change in not only that but he fixed her problem in the meantime because the scripture says Sarah could not conceive a child her body couldn't do it she lacked strength something was wrong in it and when God gave her the promise he gave her the means to produce that Promise by fixing her body that's the supernatural God when he's bringing forth a promise he'll fix the thing in you that's holding that held it up in the natural and he'll produce the supernatural out of you and these things what was it it was God working in the land of the living the baby had to be Supernatural and so the supernatural had to come into her land of the living it had to come in her everyday life in her natural body it says therefore spring there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore numerable listen Paul's writing this and we often have this this ability to go in hindsight and have great faith faith in hindsight is not faith Paul can look and Paul is a part Paul is a part of the Fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham both naturally and spiritually and he's saying listen out of that one came everything a multitude as much as the Sands of the sea or the or the stars of the heavens but Abraham couldn't see any of this all he had was a promise to come out and I'll do it that's all he had listen and it says there these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth notice now Church they were convinced they believed that they were persuaded they embraced it that means they acted on it that means they moved with it and it moved with them it was a part of their everyday life and they confessed God's promise and yet the scripture says they died without receiving all of their promises not only that they died in faith still believing nothing wavering amen listen Abraham and his son and his grandson only saw a portion of the promise that's it but each one had their portion of the promise each one had their part to play and their part was Supernatural each and every one of them but they only saw a portion of it listen and Abraham had one child you look at Abraham's life and you say that's an awfully interesting interpretation of a promise of a people that's innumerable that is as many as the stars of the of the heavens or the Sands of the sea Abraham you've got one kid one kid this is really the promise but listen that one was a miracle and out of one Miracle came what two miracles because we come to Isaac and guess what God told Isaac out of you is going to be the promise you're the one that everything's going to come out of and Isaac goes and Rebecca his wife cannot conceive children she can't conceive they're under the promise and she can't conceive a child what did Isaac do church he prayed he prayed and he went to God and he said God you said you said that we were going to have children so he had to go and he had to pray to get God moving on the situation sometimes the only thing that's holding us back is the fact that we haven't gone to God and prayerfully confessed that we're believing him and we're expecting him to move in our lives that's it and as soon as soon as Isaac prays they get pregnant that's all it took was Isaac to go to God and remind him you told me I don't deserve it but you told me you told me we were going to have a child and he went to God and he prayed about it and all of a sudden she gets pregnant amen so then we go through Isaac and and he has two children and only one of them's good only one of them's good this is a really weird way to have a multitude of people one and then one bad and one good at each other's throats you're you're it's amazing that Jacob and Esau didn't kill each other and Jacob really would have died if he would have stuck around because Esau would have killed him you look at a church and you see it's only one it's only one thing it's only one step it's only one movement but if you can understand that it's inside of the promise then you can understand the Supernatural is moving that's the faith we have to see is that something's moving amen listen in the end when the Lord came to Abraham he said this he said is anything too hard for the Lord that's got to be our it's got to be our confession like that is though we only see one thing happening though we only see little baby steps yet we believe this that God is moving if we could only recognize when God starts moving it would settle us for the rest of it if you can see God making the change if you can see God making the move if you can see God opening the door opening the window or knocking down that first little bit of that wall that's been blocking you for years then you'll say praise the Lord we're going through praise the lord it's happening and you can have faith then for the rest of it and you'll get to the end in better shape than you started because your faith has been quickened because you recognize the hand of God moving in your life for that situation or whatever it might be I've been looking at things lately in within this church and I I see things and I say Lord that looks a lot like your handiwork and and my attitude frankly sometimes is could it be could it be is that really you Lord but if we have been praying then we ought to be expecting and our attitude should not be could it be it ought to be that's you that's you Lord you're moving you're doing it it's starting listen you got a a stone at the top of a hill and it's huge and it's big and it's heavy how many of you have ever been been on the edge of a cliff and there's a stone there and you were you had to rock it a while sometimes the rock doesn't move but all you got to get it is rocking a little bit and sometimes God's just rocking the situation and you see it start to move a bit it hasn't started tumbling but you're just getting some momentum to move back and forth back and forth and then the it gets wider and wider and deeper and deeper and then all of a sudden you give that last thing and and that last step is the quickest isn't it and it just decides to flop over and then it starts picking up speed down that hill and that bowler just goes and goes and goes and it's picking up speed and nothing can stop it once it goes if you can see that God's starting to rock the situation and say it's about to move it's about to open it's about to go down amen it's about to leave then you can have faith and you'll get to the end and you'll say I saw it from the start and it quickened my faith and look at what God has done amen listen our approach ought to be he's on the move God's in the situation he doesn't sleep he doesn't Slumber the scripture says he's moving in our midst and he's got a plan he's got a purpose and all these things amen listen sometimes what we see is not the final step it's only the first step maybe it's only an intermediate step and it's not all the way but it means it's moving the prophet of God would say this I don't care what it is if you say to the mountain be moved and maybe if you've got to go over the mountain for a purpose don't tempt God he's saying you got a reason to go then you speak somebody would say oh I'm a great man of faith I move that mountain he says it will never move but if there's something over the mountain that you've got to get over there for to do the will of God and you can't get over it you can't get under it you can't get around it and yet something in your heart is telling you to go you speak the word don't you doubt and maybe when you speak the word only one little grain of sand will fall you speak to that mountain are you going to see the sand of the grain of sandfall no you couldn't even see it if you're looking for it but he says you speak it and one grain of sand will fall but it's on the road it's on its Road the next day A Spoonful may drop who's going to notice a spoonful out of a mountain the next day a teacup full you will never notice it but if you will just hold steady knowing that it's being done after a while the whole thing will fall in That's the Way It Is by Divine Healing when you're seeing the working of the Holy Spirit the word laid on and the Holy Spirit anointing that word and proving it that he is here in our midst to vindicate himself and to give you the promise then you accept your healing if there's sin in your life get it out if there's condemnation get it out remember we spoke last service condemnation is of Satan because it points to your fault and it doesn't give you the remedy he says get rid of the fault get rid of the the shame get rid of the embarrassment and get rid of this idea that you can't overcome he says get rid of that and get to the remedy that Christ is he says get rid of that if there's condemnation get it out if there's doubt get it out until you can see perfectly that it's God's will it's God's plan and you're included in that you've got to see yourself in that word then he says say sickness in the name of Jesus Christ get away from me whether it's depression whether it's an it's a it's a becoming sin whether it's a habit whether it's a relationship whatever it is say Satan you've got to go and you expect the mountain to fall and remember you might not feel any better for a week you may not think any different you may not see a difference in your looks in your mentality doesn't have anything to do with it it may be breaking down one grain at a time he says but as soon as you said that word something happened God has to keep his word that sickness shakes and he begins to turn loose he will go if you'll just believe it don't doubt like Peter walking on the water he said why did you doubt oh ye of little faith just because he was thinking that had nothing to do with it you say I'm sinking how can I be in the Supernatural Brother John listen to this he said Christ had commanded him and his word was enough that's the way we should think too sometimes it seems like you get worse before you get better not just physically in sickness mentally emotionally relationally whatever it is sometimes your finances keep going downhill before they turn up he says as soon as you said the word something happened listen there cannot be a promise of healing without a day of healing there can't be a promise of Deliverance without a day of Deliverance there can't be a promise a provision without a day of provision it has to come in the land of the living it has to come in this life because that's what he promised it for amen if he has promised Grace or peace or rest or love there's got to be a day that has all of those things in it as you have need he will provide amen listen he said in Isaiah 53 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void in other words it will not go out and have no effect it is not useless it goes out and it it has an effect it says but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sent it listen the word was given for us here right now right here right now that's what it was given for amen we can be an expectation of God working in our lives today just not always at the rate we want you hear of people that were you know in in a in a prison they do a prison break and they tunnel out you know when they Allied in the war camps in Germany and that do you know how slow they had to do those things they built tunnels 300 feet long and they dig it with spoons dig it with spoons but they got out listen don't hinder God by saying it's taking too long say Lord you'll get it done in your time and look for the little clumps of dirt that show that the tunnel's being built look for evidence of change don't look for evidence of no change look through eyes of faith not eyes of doubt amen and then you'll start to be like Abraham I will call that which is not as if it is and I will ignore everything contrary to it in my life that's the faith that we're looking for amen back in Hebrews 11 it says for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country what not the land of Israel that was a promise but he was looking for the promise the kingdom of God where he says I will be your God and you will be my people amen there's a real promise and it lays in Redemption not in the natural here this is just a foreshadow of things to come it's a taste it's a spoonful of what we've been promised he says and truly if they had been mindful of that country from once they came out they might have had opportunity to return so in other words if you keep looking back at where you were what you had all these different things all the benefits the garlics and leaks of Egypt as the scripture talks about you keep looking at that you're never going to move forward Jesus said there are no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God there's a drive there's a saying that says you can't drive looking in your rearview mirror you'll never go straight you'll never get to your destination safe because you're so concerned or you're so tied in to what you came out of Amen you've got to let go those things Paul said forgetting those things which are behind I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus Let It Go it's done press forward for now they desire a better country that is and Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he have received the promises offered up his only begotten son accounting sorry of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up what faith God was able to raise him up even from the dead in a situation listen we're not even talking about situations of people have gone too far we're talking about dead knife in the heart dead okay this isn't figurative this is literally saying accounting believing that God was able to raise that son up that he had just killed he says from whence also he received in him a figure listen Abraham knew that Isaac was a miracle baby from a miracle wife and from a miracle husband so he said listen he's Supernatural all the way so the supernatural will have to continue because there's a promise that's over Isaac and it's got to happen that's the faith that he had that God would raise him up if Abraham actually was required to kill him it says now watch this by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come so Abraham had the promise of a land and he passes it on to Isaac now Isaac's in the same situation as Abraham he sees no more but he has two kids instead of one so I he has a personal portion of the promise but he's not really seen anything so Isaac now blesses Jacob and Esau concerning what things to come he's sharing the word he's passing on the promise he's passing on the word to them and he's saying you keep pressing now you keep believing you keep acting on these things don't let it fall don't let it fail but keep believing and God will do it and now in verse 21 it says by faith Jacob when he was dying bless both the sons of Joseph and worship leaning upon the the top of his staff Jacob's now not even in the land of promise he's in a Strange Land he's dying but now we went from one kid to two kids now Jacob's got 12 kids God's moving and then those kids now have grandchildren so he's seen that God is starting to multiply so they've got a a path maybe you would see the growth in the people but they still don't have a land and that he's there and he's worshiping while dying saying I believe God's going to take you to it the word the promise just coming from generation to generation and they see it afar off and they're looking they say stick with it stick with it because it's going to happen by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones Joseph was a prophet he was the the closest type of Christ that we have in the scripture and now he's there and he never gets to experience the reality of the promised land but he sees the growth again but they're still not innumerable maybe they've got hundreds not innumerable he doesn't have a land and yet he says it's going to happen and take me with you I don't want to rest in a Strange Land I want to rest where you guys are by faith Moses now we're 400 years down the road by faith Moses when he was born was hit three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment so the same promise that Abraham now has had is now driving Moses parents to act on the promise believing that now it is the time of Deliverance they protect the deliverer they act by faith they go against the king Commandments and and This Promise that's been passed from generation to generation they're quickened that this is now the time for it and they keep their son from dying what is it they were making sure that every generation was in expectation that every generation knew that the promise was there waiting to be fulfilled and now it goes to Moses and it says by faith Moses when he was come to years listen Moses laid hold of the promise himself young people that's what you've got to do you've got to lay hold of this promise this word for yourself you've got to say this is for me and I believe it and I'm going to act on it that's what you've got to do by Moses when he was by faith Moses when he was come to yours refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season it says esteeming the reproach of Christ greater the reproach of that was of greater value to him than the treasures of then greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect under the recompense of the war he made a conscious decision to walk away he made a conscious decision to forsake power and influence and money and women and all of these things he made a conscious decision to walk away from all of it deeming believing that what God had told him was worth more than what he had right here right now that's the kind of Faith Moses had it says by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured endurance is required that means God doesn't always move right now he's the god of right now but that means you don't always see it he endured as seeing him who was invisible and through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood lest that he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them this is where the reality of The Exodus is starting to come in and they're saying we're going to go because Moses said we're about to go get in your houses get under the atonement there's a provision made for you get under the provision because the promise is about to be made made real it says by faith they pass through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians are saying to do were drowned can you imagine the excitement now they get out around the Exodus and then there's of course the the great worry and concern as the Egyptians come up and they Rebel and they they cry out and they complain but then they go through the Red Sea supernaturally and then they watch somebody try and copy them and die doing it because the Supernatural is only for Supernatural people and somebody tried to copy them and they die doing it so now they realize we're free we're really free they can't come after us they've just been destroyed completely now all we got to do is walk to the promised land they're in the middle of the promise and yet what happened we know they step back and their faith wavered and they got into doubt and they got into complaining in these different things but even in that God raised up a group who would believe even out of all that fate out of that doubt God raised up a group of faithful people faithful young people because that's what they were they were young they were young they were under 20 years old all of them when this whole thing started but now we get to verse 30 and it says by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days listen this is the literal fulfillment of the promise of God this is the first step of that promise and this is the first land that they were able to take that was across the river Jordan that was in the land that God promised them 22 verses here spanning almost 500 years where was The Promise it was right there all along and God was moving but all they could each one see is one kid here one kid there then Jacob comes along 12 kids he took it personally and then they went and they had a bazillion kids and all of a sudden each one of them now has a portion of the promise right in their own house but did they realize it did they realize it they had their own portion of the supernatural right there and it was their own families that's it you say brother John why do we pray for our kids that's your promise that's your portion that's the Supernatural is our kids that can have a relationship with Christ just like we can that's why we fight that's why we pray that's why we have services and that's why we we do the things that we do and we sacrifice the things we do not so that they'll have great careers and and these different things but that they'll meet the Christ that we know so that they can have the promise that we're looking for as well amen listen 430 years all that happened was babies but babies were part of the promise and all they had to do was recognize them we're multiplying we're bigger than anybody that's all they had to do recognize the moving of God in their midst in the simplest of ways verse 32 says what more what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell if Gideon and a Barrack and of Samson and objecta of David also in Samuel of the prophets who through faith subdued that's subdued we think that means that we defeated but you know what it means it means to struggle and overcome says they subdued kingdoms they wrote righteousness that means they did the right thing and brought to Justice those that didn't they wrought it they did it it says they obtained promises did it say they deserved them did say they earned them did it say they bought them no it says they obtained them obtain promises it means it says they stopped the mouth of lions listen God didn't keep Daniel out of the Lion's Den God hasn't promised us we'll never be in a place of peril a place where our life is in danger that there's that there's difficulty there's there's things facing us that can kill us sometimes the Supernatural is God binding Satan right in front of you remember that story of that man that was going to try and and beat up brother Branham and take over the meetings you would say the supernatural will be that that man never made it in the supernatural was that man coming in and Christ through that Prophet saying because you have challenged what him you must bow before me and he had to stop right there and fall down and confess and he was powerless powerless why because he was in the will of God that Prophet was in the will of God that service was in the will of God and God would allowed nothing to touch his prophet he didn't say you're never going to face lions but he did say he'll close their mouths sometimes you've got to realize that God allows you into the situation just to show you nothing can touch you unless I let it that's it sometimes you're going through it just so you can come out unscathed where everybody else got destroyed he says they did what quenched the violence of fire didn't keep the three Hebrew children out of the fire they walked in and the supernatural was happening even as they walked in because nobody could even stand the heat to get close to it and when they fall in it says it quenched the violence it took away the effects of the fire except in a way that benefited them and that's that it released their bonds the trial they went through freed them and God himself stepped down in the midst of them brother man talks about it and he says I'm going to go down this time because the Angels were saying we can go down we can put the Flames out he says no no I'm gonna go down this time they believed in me they professed that they believed that I could see I could save them he says I'm going to go down and I'm going to step in their midst and do that it says they escape the edge of the sword this is this is the the the actions of a God in the land of the living Church they escape the sword sometimes we want to stand and fight sometimes the working of God is that you don't have to fight at all that he just takes away of escape and you just slip out the side door sometimes we're struggling and we're overwhelmed and God says you don't have to fight this one I'll just make a way out just go and take some peace go and take some rest this one isn't for you today I'll take care of this one listen to this church out of weakness were made strong listen anybody feeling weak this morning anybody feeling overwhelmed this morning it says what out of weakness it's okay to start weak it's okay to admit I don't have it all but he says out of that weakness they were made strong they went from weak to strong they went from unable to Able they went from defeated to more than conquerors they went from no good to to Godly that's what God does he'll take you from where you are and he takes you to what he wants you to be amen listen he says they were waxed they waxed Valiant and fight now wax does not like we think of Wax you know waxing a car or waxing to take something off but this wax means that they were transformed they didn't start Valiant that were Valiant it means brave and powerful and mighty and courageous so in this in this fight they didn't start out that way but the longer they fought the braver they became the longer they fought the greater their strength became the longer they follow the greater their courage raised I'm reminded of shamgar 600 men 600 men and all he has is an ox goat maybe something the size of this with a sharp point on the end and he's going out against 600 Philistines fully armored Men of War and all shamgar is is a man in the land of promise do you think he was scared I think he was terrified but you know what he was he was sick and tired of Satan taking his family he was sick and tired of Satan putting it over on sick and tired of being sick and tired sick and tired of losing the blessings so he went out and he said it's me or it's you and he killed the first one fully armored Philistine Soldier he killed him with an ox goat a farm utensil then he killed the second one then he killed the third one pretty soon he was down 20. and I believe he got stronger as he went because the scripture says you wax Valiant in the fight sometimes you gotta say I'm fighting for it I'm not walking away anymore I'm not I'm not going to live below my privileges anymore if God has given it for me if God has promised it for me I'm going to take it after the first hundred I think he started to talk I think he started to say praise the Lord I thought he's I think he started to say Bring It On who's next I think they start to get worried after they saw a hundred down then he killed the next hundred surrounded him nothing could touch him the next hundred down they're down to half their men 300 men scattered around the farm of shamgar and all he has is an ox goat church if God gave it to you he'll make it last he's up against swords he's up against Spears he's up against arrows he's up against Shields he's up against armor he's up against helmets and he's got 300 dead Philistines there and they're stupid enough to keep coming he says as long as you keep coming I'll keep killing can you imagine he was down to 599 dead and there's one idiot standing there still standing there thinking I'm gonna get shamgar everyone else is dead one idiot says I'm going to take him on I think shamgar just looked at him and shook his head and killed him and that was that they put a pin on their GPS and said don't go to this Farm anymore there's a guy with an ox code and he don't like us leave his home alone leave his family alone leave his crops alone leave his blessings alone because that man will stand for what God gave him one man shin guards only got I think one verse in the entire Bible one verse he waxed Valiant in fight church if you want to wax Valiant you got to start fighting you've got to start fighting and trust that he'll give you the strength he'll give you the courage he'll give you the endurance to come all the way through amen it says they turn to flight the armies of the aliens you can't turn to fight the armies of the aliens unless you face the armies of the aliens you got to face an army sometimes David's Mighty Men it was all about how many they could kill by themselves they faced armies they turned to flight armies all on their own Mighty Men of Valor Mighty women of value not listed in scripture but I'm saying we've got Mighty women of Valor here we're all Warriors we're all battles in this day amen listen they couldn't beat an army if they didn't face an army you can't beat that habit if you don't face it you can't beat the situation if you don't stand up to it and say I'm not getting what God promised me I'm here to take it back listen every single story that Paul talked about here happened in the day-to-day lives of believers this is not Supernatural up in heaven he's not talking about Michael and the archangels fighting against Satan he's talking about Believers Standing on the Promises and the word of God in every generation and laying hold of it and saying this is for me it's for here it's for now it's in my life today listen every single one of them knew that they had walked they were walking a path that God had put them on and that meant that he was with them you got to find the will of God and then you'll have the faith of God but if you know that he's with you then anything that stands Before You Must Fall brother Brown says if you've got a reason to go over that mountain and you can't get over it he says and you're in the will of God you speak to that mountain and it will go listen they didn't just believe he was a god of heaven or he was the god of my brother and he was the god of my sister they believed he was the God and the Lord of them personally and that's where we've got to be amen right in the in the land of the living right in our everyday lives brother Brian would say this just be sure it's God and then hold on to it stay with it when God says anything he has to keep his word be certain that it's God take God's word that's how you know it certainly God is that it's his word don't they hold of some Fantastical thing that you dreamed up in the night lay hold of the word if God Whispers to your heart I'm the Lord that healeth thee stay with it that's God's promise God promises to give the Holy Spirit he says stay with it until it comes I mean I want to as we start to close here I want to talk about our great promise because what is our great promise they had a promise of a land and a people and then they had a promise that they would God would be their God and they would be his people and we're a part of that second portion we know but but what is our promise Abraham had this promise that he'd be a great nation and a great land what is our promise that that that's similar to that First Corinthians 15 says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep that says that means we'll not all die it says but we shall all be changed so some are going to die and some aren't going to die but we'll all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruption shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory this thing of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved brethren he says having this promise Brothers be ye steadfast be unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain on the Lord listen our promise is a resurrection of rapture it's a body change and whether you go by way the Graver you go by way of a Rapture when that when that final sweep comes amen we have a promise that he's going to change us and it will be Incorruptible amen but that's far off and you say what evidence do I have of a Rapture today what evidence do I have of the Resurrection I can't see anything happening and if you're looking at big events you probably won't see anything happening we had a great sign when we had a Prophet come in this age and that was a call that woke us up and we know that there's a bridegroom coming because we had a call that said get yourself ready and he gave us a message to point us to the word that would get us ready so we know that there's a bridegroom coming we know that there's a marriage supper of the Lamb coming we know there's a resurrection and a Rapture but you've got to see that the steps to that are often so small as to be what completely unnoticeable and you won't attach the events to the final event but we've got to put on spiritual eyes amen and that's why we have a message is because that's what's going to give us those spiritual eyes it's gonna what does the prophet do he told us look for this look for these signs look at what's happening in the world look at Israel the time clock of God he pointed to the politics he pointed to religion he pointed to Hollywood he talked he pointed to the family and how it was being broken up he pointed to all these things he says look up your Redemption draweth nigh so we've had a warning we've had a message that tells us to be looking for it the question is are we seeing it do you know what the movement of the Rapture is do you know what it looks like to experience a portion of the Resurrection Right Here and Now listen we're human and in our Humanity our vision and our understanding our Cape our capacity to understand the full picture is so limited so many times but he said I've given you the mind of Christ said you'll catch it so that you'll be aware because Jesus said you're my friends and that's why I tell you these things you're my brothers I've let you in on the secret so don't let doubt or don't let your eyes get filmed over like John the Baptist keep your eyes open be looking for these things listen we're looking for the supernatural of of God to move and take us off the Earth that's our Heavenly promise but the promise on the land of the living is what takes us to the promise of the supernatural in heaven there's a promise here there's an expectation what is a Rapture it's a total healing Rapture is total healing we have a body that will be incorrupted like unto his glorious body the scripture says and it's meant to last forever but in the meantime he gives us a taste of it he gives us a spoonful of it he gives us a teapot of it and what is it it's Divine Healing it's the promise that I stayed at the whipping post and the and the Flesh and the muscles and the skin off my body were ripped away so that you could be healed that's our Taste of the Resurrection that's our Taste of the Rapture is Divine Healing it's the children's bread it's a fullness of the ra it's a portion of the of the Rapture in the land of the living so your healing your promise is what points you to a rapture so when you're healed say I'm also raptured then because if he's healing me now that means he's going to Rapture me then because there's a portion that's working in my life amen what is a Rapture it's total peace and rest you won't have peace and rest listen our days are short and full of trouble that's what we have here but over there is all peace and rest the scripture says he will wipe all tears from our eyes and everything in our past there'll be no more death there's no more sorrow nor crying nor pain and the only thing that passes away is our painful past all the flaws and the failures and the battles and the offenses and the difficulties and all of these different things that is what goes away and you're at total peace and rest because you're at your Warrior you're with your bridegroom it's total peace and rest but listen while we're here we get a spoonful and what is it it's a peace that surpasses all understanding and that's available today you don't have to wait over there to get a piece that goes beyond your understanding beyond what you think is is possible in this world he gives you a piece here and what is it it's a it's a little portion of the supernatural in the land of the living what is a rapture total Deliverance total Deliverance because we have we're here in this thinking flesh and it's not saved and it can't be saved and it won't be saved but when you get a body change amen when you're together with Christ in harmony now there's no fighting he has perfect preeminence and you are subject to him and you speak with him as one that's total Deliverance you're delivered from the influence of your own ideas of your own intellect of your own education of your own experience and what is our Taste of total Deliverance it's the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is what helps us to submit the Holy Ghost is what helps us to surrender the Holy Ghost is what helps us to speak what he wants us to speak and it's just a portion it's a down payment it's an earnest of the rapture because we only have a bit of it we don't have the whole thing but if we can see that I've got the Holy Ghost and he doesn't give that to me unless he's going to Rapture me unless he's going to resurrect me that's our hope that's our land of the living portion of the supernatural that awaits Us in that perfect relationship with Christ over there amen brother Brown would say let's go on the promised land is there for whatsoever thing you desire When you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it every promise in the Bible is ours when today today don't put it off till tomorrow believe today he may give it to you tomorrow but believe today he says every promise in the Bible is ours it's given to us by the Lord Jesus and his Great Mighty hand is holding time holding time for us to possess the land that's been given to us he said but God has promised us and he cannot lie he swore that he would do it healing belongs to us amen salvation belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to us Heaven belongs to us now we're the sons of God now now today here tomorrow here on this Earth You are a son you are a daughter you are a child of God and the promises of God are yea and amen so be it right here that's for you if you can recognize your position you'll recognize what he's given you to possess as well every promise in the book is mine we sing that book that song Amen he says now right now we're setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and there is nothing that can harm us listen I want to close with one more quote and I I use this as a closing quote when I preach with Brother John Andes in in in February but someone shared it with me this week and I thought it was a wonderful wonderful way to close this service out speaking of Christ it says Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm and the Gale is knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in the face a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him that's right whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knewed what if the situation looked like it wasn't going to go the way that it was supposed to go he says it didn't move and why he knew it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say oh have I prayed through have I wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed what God Said was truth the words must be fulfilled and he knew that his life was to fulfill them his life was to fulfill them if the spirit and the mind of Christ is in you then there must be a word for you to fulfill personally in the land of the living so expect it to happen in your life expect it to happen in your family expect it to happen in your job expect it to happen in your marriage because there's a word for you to fulfill and it's personal and it's part of us moving into that great rapture he says and you're here to fulfill it too don't leave it with Christ Christ is here in you the hope of glory if you're you're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious and unto the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention the right or left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God Hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God Enoch one day he walked like that you know what Enoch didn't just walk one day he walked every day but take it one day at a time don't don't don't dwell on what's going to happen tomorrow don't get caught up in fear and worry and concern and what if scenarios walk today with God Enoch one day walk like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore walk with God the doctor says you're going to die walk with God yeah the doctor says you can't well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you I personal pronoun will never leave you or forsake you I will be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by that Covenant that he gave you that he would confirm it just walk with God then listen to this church as we close you'll never have a problem you'll never have a concern you'll never fall you never fail is everybody reading this with me am I reading that correctly that's not what it says you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you got to go through Briar patches over sharp rocks over Bluffs down over the hillsides up through the mountains over Waters he says but walk with God yes sir there's so many Hills to climb upward you've heard that old song but how little it'll seem when you get to the end of the way and then God bless you let's stand together if we would I want you to take courage this morning how many stories have we read how many scriptures have we said let's say you're going to make it through sometimes he's just waiting for you to save God I believe sometimes you just wait for you to get up and be honest and sometimes he's what he's asking you to just take your hands off and let me make the Escape for you God moves in many ways and he moves in our lives in different ways and he works with us according to the way we are but he always has a way for us to come through and we don't have to put it off till tomorrow we don't have to carry a burden into next week we don't have to dwell on things that are holding us back and not deal with them we can deal with them here we can deal with them today amen and you can have an expectation that when you break when you bring it to him he hears he answers and it starts to move and you may go home and you may say brother John I don't feel a bit different nothing's changed nothing's moved don't look at that remember he said when Peter started to sink he said that had nothing to do with it Christ had called him to walk on water and he just had to keep walking keep walking this morning if you need to start walking start walking if you need to start praying start praying you need to start believing start believing but don't stay in your current condition this morning believe that he's moving in your midst in your life personally and if you made him Lord if you've made him savior then he is there to meet the needs of your life here and now let's not be so spiritual that we can't see the supernatural in our lives amen let's trust let's believe let's speak let's speak let's confess the word God loves to hear his word repeated back to him that's why you take it back to the word and you say God I'm believing what you said I'm believing by your stripes I am healed I'm believing that if you lay hands on us on me that somebody will cast that demon out Lord that there can be peace and rest in a time of great trial and struggle that you can save my children that you can correct the situation that you can restore that you can redeem that you can heal and that you can save that you can fill me with the Holy Ghost or maybe fill me with the Holy Ghost again anew that you can be a rock in a dry place that splits open and gives me all the water that I could ever take that's the kind of God we serve amen let's just bow our heads if we would Mr Maureen if you would play that song in your presence I want to go quietly all heads bowed look into your life this morning and I want you to look and say is something holding me back is something overshadowing me as something got me in a thorn patch and I'm stuck and I can't get out maybe you've got a besetting sin now you've got a relationship you shouldn't have husbands maybe our headship isn't where it ought to be wise maybe our obedience isn't where it's supposed to be every head's bowed every eye is closed you got a need you let him know it break that barrier of gravity and say Lord I'm raising my hand because I've got a need Lord and I am sick I'm sick of not being where I ought to be not saying you're lost I'm not saying you're you're a failure what I'm saying is there's a place for God to move in there's a need there's a desire and you know there's a higher plane there's a greater victory let's just go to him in prayer Heavenly Father Lord I believe this was a message of overcoming power this morning not my words your word not my spirit your spirit Lord and we've read that scripture recently where it says where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Lord and I believe if we'll humble ourselves and call on your name Lord if we'll put the word on our lips Lord you'll come in our midst and you'll touch and you'll heal and you'll deliver and you'll save and you'll fill and you'll refill Lord you'll bring repentance you'll bring worship you'll bring joy you'll bring peace you'll bring restoration you'll bring Salvation Lord whatever the situation is you are a God that works in the land of the living Lord the word says you're not a god of the dead but you're the god of the Living Lord your living bride is here this morning Lord and we are a needy people Lord I am needy Lord we're praying your grace and your mercy to drop down Heavenly Father Lord as your people bow their heads and they pray and they humble themselves before you Lord my hands are up too Lord God Lord would you move in our midst Lord would you give us an expectation for your moving power in this land of the living Lord in these bodies that we have to live in for now Lord in these situations in this Fallen Earth Lord may your power move Lord as your spirit moved in creation Glory may it creatively work in US Lord to bring the past that which we cannot do on our own Lord may we take our hands off the wheel or may we surrender where we need to and Lord where we need to pick up an ox go where we need to pick up the sword of the word Lord may we need to lay hold of The Shield of Faith Lord may you put it in our hands this morning and help us to start swinging Lord would you grant us strength Lord let us wax Valiant in the fight Lord and let us turn to flight the armies of the aliens Lord God anything that comes before you must fall Lord and we are in you we're in Heavenly places in Christ and we're claiming our position we're claiming our promises this morning Lord where sin is Lord we repent no of our condemnation is we cast Satan out and say there's a remedy there's a path there's a way there's a blood that's already atoned and there's a holy ghost to give us power that overcomes Lord would you just move in our midst this morning Lord as your people pray Lord as they worship as they cry out to you Lord may you change their lives may you change their situations Lord may they have faith to hold on and see that first grain of sand Lord to see that first Spoonful that first teapot
