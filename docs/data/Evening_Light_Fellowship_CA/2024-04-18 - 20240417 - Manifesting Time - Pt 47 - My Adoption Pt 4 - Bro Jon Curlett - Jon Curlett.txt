but Lord It's Your Grace that pulled us out that sets us aside that places us upon a rock or that puts your very life inside of us and makes us live a life that's pleasing to you Lord we're thankful this evening Lord we just ask you to be in this service Lord praying your grace to each one that's here Lord that you'd encourage us that you'd straighten us out Lord that you'd draw us closer to you Lord separate us more from the things of this world Lord help us to see through your eyes Lord help us to see our place in you Lord help us to see your purpose in our lives Lord and help us to just willingly step into it and trust you all along we pray Lord God lord remembering those that aren't here remembering especially brother Mark tonight Lord praying you just Lord restore strength Lord and health to him Lord thanking you for your goodness to him for his tests the good results but praying Lord you just continue to be with them Lord each one of us Lord we have many needs in this body Lord I pray you just Minister tonight we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this evening amen good to be in church tonight amen God bless you 1 Corinthians chapter 12 we've been preaching a lot of Corinthians out of a lot out of Corinthians I should say and we're going to stay in there tonight a little bit and amen just trusting God's grace amen 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 27 and uh we've got the slides tonight but I will try and go slowly I had feedback that said that going slowly helps and so when it comes to reading I was telling them when it's up there I read it fast because you can read it and you don't need me to read slow but apparently helps if I read it slower so I'm going to try and slow down here tonight and just relax and and not worry about the time or anything like that and we're just going to have a good time in the Lord amen amen 1 Corinthians 12: 27 very familiar scripture it says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular can you say Amen to that this evening amen we are the body of Christ and we are members in particular and God have set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret he says but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening amen we're continuing our series on manifesting time and and taking another service on my adoption and now we're getting down today is where we get down to where we live what we do why our purpose what our purpose is what we're doing here on this Earth why God put us here in the first place and so I want to establish us always from the word of God you know I've seen what quote Wars produce and it's just div Vision amen and you can take a quote and you can run with it and if you take it out of context or you shave a little bit here a little bit there you can make it say anything but the scriptures flow from start to finish absolutely and that is that is where we go for these things so back in John chap 14 John 14 and: 16 and Jesus is talking he says I will pray he's telling the disciples about what's coming he says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive that means that there are people that cannot receive this truth because they cannot receive the spirit of the truth and without the spirit of the truth truth you'll never be able to find the truth anden it takes the Holy Spirit to open these things to our eyes and our hearts he says whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I want you to notice here Jesus is saying the spirit of Truth is here right now and they don't recognize it he said but you're going to recognize it because you recognize it now you'll recognize it in the future but as people don't recognize it today he says they're not going to recognize it tomorrow when it's in you they're never going to understand what's going on here he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you that's a real hard scripture for those that believe in a trinity because he says I'm going to come he says the comforter is going to come to you another comforter and then he says I'm going to come to you he says I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me and because I live ye shall live also at that day what when the spirit of truth comes when the comforter comes you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you and this is the mystery of God being revealed right here this is the full picture of what God had in his mind before the foundation of the world and it's a full picture of what God was trying to do all along and we can see here what it was like in the Garden of Eden was you had a perfect Unity of the children of God with Christ himself and God walked in the garden he walked with Adam and his wife and and then that picture got erased and this mystery got hidden it was flowing right along and it was supposed to come out but then something happened and Satan Twisted it up and we lost the picture of what the mystery of God looks like but now in this age we've had a messenger come back with a restoring message and what does he do he reveals what the mystery of God was all along amen we don't have a new message we have a restoring message that's what Malachi 45 and6 tells us is it's a restoring message it's it's bringing us back to something that was there originally and in Revelations 10 7 it says that this that under this Angel message we have what the revealing of the mystery the finishing of the mystery of God it started all the way back in the mind of God and it started really in Genesis but then it was put into a Hiatus because of sin but now under the Covenant of Grace he's coming back and he's bringing us all the way back to that original position so we see the revealing of the mystery before our very eyes now I've read this quote many times and I know we've heard it many times but I want to just speak it this morning this evening so we're we're standing on familiar ground brother Braham says God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself Jehovah's Tabernacle he says it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me saith the son he doeth The Works in other words he says in that day the father was the vine and he was the branch to Bear the fruit of God he says Jesus was the the branch to Bear the fruit of God now he becomes the vine who Christ becomes the vine and we become the branch and all that was in God was poured into Christ and we can all say Amen like we just did but now he says are you ready here it is it may gag you a little but listen all that was in Christ was poured into the church he's explaining John 14 he says the works that I do shall you also More Than This shall you do for I go to my father he says do you see it we are living under our god-given privileges that God has redeemed us to church I believe this morning this evening that we're living under our privileges you know why I believe that because I see that there's more in the word I see that there's more for us I see that under this prophet's message he showed us that there's more there's a greater Victory there's a greater surrender there's a greater overcoming there's a greater signs and wonders there's a greater gifts all of these things are greater why because we're under the revelation of restoration and Redemption Amen to redeem or to restore means to bring back to its original condition and I don't know about you but I'm not in my original condition yet I've got aches and pains more than I ever used to and I'm I'm aging and I'm turning gray and I'm getting older and older and Satan still has his strongholds in this flesh that I'm dealing with that's not the way we were meant to be amen but under a time of redemption under a message of restoration we know that everything has to come back to its original and until I'm there I know there's more as long as I'm not where I need to be as long as I'm not in a a Rapture yet then I know there's more for me and it's not all in the in the outside in the power of God in the external but it's the internal man that needs these changes as well there's things in me that have to be changed and overcome amen so until we get a body change there's going to be work and that means there's more for me to expect amen there's faith that I can have and there's expectation I can have for the Lord to do things in my life amen now we took a bit of a detour in the last two services on on this thought of my adoption and it wasn't a detour cuz the scriptures were in my notes all along and and we talk so much about unity and I want to talk about Unity because remember adoption is placing us into a body it's not placing us into a position where we're out on our own doing our own thing but it's placing us into the body of Christ and that means we've got to be able to get along we've got to be able to work together we've got to be able to recognize and appreciate the things that each one brings to the body of Christ and appreciate the differences and look past where they maybe rub us a little wrong and I know that the Lord dealt with me on several things in studying and preaching that and he's still dealing with me on things and I'm trusting he's doing the same thing in our lives amen that we can sit here and say we can always be closer but I want to read one quote here and and I I I I wanted to preach it last service but just for the sake of time I left it out but I want you to see what what this Unity looks like and and what can even bring it and brother bam he's quoting that song when we asunder part it gives us inward pain and he says I've seen the time brother he says let me not condemn us but let me just wake us up to something he's saying I'm not I'm not trying to hurt you here but I'm trying to tell you we used to do it differently he says I saw the time in this church that when people had to wait until Wednesday night to meet one another they would cry over it he says and that's right now he says and and I saw ministers come in here and would say how do you do it then people they're just with one heart ministers would come in they say brother brandom how do the people people get this way how do you have such a close- niit group of people I've had ministers come in here and say that about us and man I'll give you a pad on the back this evening they come in and they say it's wonderful how you Fellowship together and you're close and you just like to spend time with one another and they say we don't see that many places let's not lose it let's not let the little things that pop up from time to time separate us from that closeness of Fellowship of seeking out our brothers and our sisters and spending time with them but brother baham says here's how they keep it listen up he says they meet at the door and them sisters meet one another back there and they hug one another saying sister be sure to pray for me now honey I'll see you again Wednesday night you'll pray won't you you pray for me and I'll be praying for you he says and making like that with tears in their eyes see the brothers Shake one another's hands they could just hardly get get away from each other like that he says that's real Christian Fellowship see just waiting and praying for each other yes sir that's the way they should be I've been to churches where 10 minutes after the minister stops preaching and the songs are done everybody's gone and I say Where's the Love where's the body we've read the scriptures in John 14 we read the quotes of brother R says we are a body we are the word made flesh and people will say well we come to church to hear the word we do but guess what this is not the only word that's in this building anden we read the quotes that said this is the word we are the word made flesh today and if we're coming in and we're doing this and we miss it in our brothers and sisters have we really gotten the word we can make an idol of the preaching and ignore the effect that it has on the body we need Fellowship we need to spend time we need to pray for one another we need to to to hold on to one another amen this is a body word that's here it's the bride of Christ that's here and it's the word made flesh amen and so we don't just run out the door we what we Fellowship we wait and pray for each other I appreciate it after service seeing people that don't run out the door and I know I I'm not getting on you this evening by any means sometimes we've got to go but people that'll sit here and they'll pray and sometimes you're not praying for yourself you're praying because your brother or your sister is sitting over there and they're praying and you say they need me whatever they're praying for Lord would you help my brother and sister that's a wonderful thing when we can sit here and wait for each other and pray and hold each other up before God Amen brother Brown would say this he says Moses Veil he was the Living Word to the people he says and today the people that are veiled are the same thing they are written Epistles read of all men not a new epistle but the epistle that's been written made manifest it's those who believe the word and the promise of this day that God is pouring out his Spirit upon All Flesh that is written Epistles that's why I like to spend time with Believers because it's the word coming to the word there's an automatic connection when you meet a Believer that's got the Holy Ghost there ought to be there ought to be why because there's something in them that's a part of you and there's something in you that's a part of them cuz you're part of the word amen you're part of the bride of Christ now I want to take us back that was just a just a a little finish for last service but I want to take us back to the the quote I read a couple services to go because remember adoption is about our positional placing within the body of Christ amen it's the role that God has ordained for each and every one of us before the foundation of the world and I want to read this quote from here himym brother Braham says what God wants to do with the church tonight wants to do with an individual is find somebody the Holy Spirit searching to find man where he can take him out to a certain place speak to that person anoint them give them something special great powers and gifts to work his will and to do his will now we look at this quote and we're going to we're going to reflect on this at the very end of service but we look at that and we say wow wow where do I fit into that what is my great power going to be how is it going to anoint me what is the something special that God has ordained for my life that's a big quote and what happens is when we see something like this is we build it up in our mind and we forget the Simplicity that is God being revealed so many times but keep this in here we talked we talked about Moses we talked about David and Joshua and Samuel and Peter and Paul and Gideon and all these different people that God came to them he spoke to them he anointed them he gave them purpose he put his power behind them and then they went out and they did wonderful things and you'll find with these people that they weren't perfect but they were prepared they were prepared God did a work Gideon needed to Gideon needed some Cal alongs Gideon needed some prompts needed some pushes he needed some support to let him know that God had chosen him and he asked God for a sign and then he flipped the sign and said well let's do it the other way that way it could have been natural this way I'll no it's not natural and then God has him do one thing and then God has him do another thing and God's encouraging him and encouraging him sometimes we think it's just going to be this big burst of power and we're going to do it listen we're not all superheroes some of us need a little more encouragement than others but regardless when God chooses us then he'll provide whatever it takes to get us across the finish line to get his us to do his will and his word amen don't sit there and say I can't do it no if he's called you and he's chosen you you're going to be able to do it because he's with you all the way but I want to pick up where we started in this service in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and it's where we left off in the last service he says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular that word that phrase members in particular means we each have a specific function and purpose individually no one of us is alike some of us can be very similar in certain ways but not a one of us is alike don't ever have the exact same role he says and God has set some in the church not all some some in the church he says first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers and after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps government's diversities of tongues now we've talked about this before but just to remind you the first gifts are to bring the word the word is the most important thing it's the most important thing the word is always first signs and wonders and demonstration are supposed to follow that if we're leading with signs and wonders we've gotten it wrong we lead with the word we follow with signs and wonders that's the way that it works amen if we've gotten the signs and wonders first we're out of order God always sends his word first but notice here it says that he set some so some have this some have this some have this and then after that you have others that have this this this and this but then then Paul says are all prophets are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers in other words is everyone a minister brother visha was talking to us at the fellowship on on Sunday talking about a a friend of his that believes that everyone should be in the ministry well Paul's saying no no all chiefs and no Indians if everyone's a preacher then who's going to listen right right not everyone's a a part of preaching not everyone's a part of teaching and then he says they're all workers of Miracles well brother John you just read this quote where you're talking about God wants us to take us and give us great gifts and great powers and this and that and the other thing and Paul says is everybody going to work miracles no no by no means he says have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret Paul's saying not everyone has these sorts of gifts and certainly nobody has all of them more importantly right God ordains them God drops them down and God uses dwelling vessels that's what we'll see now some are ordained vessels if you're in the ministry we see we see it in in Jeremiah we see it in John the Baptist and these different ones you're ordained to that but gifts can be different gifts can be dropped down and pulled up it can be on you one day gone the next and then there's people that are born with a gift that's with them no matter what and we'll talk about that as we go through this and maybe a little bit tonight but but certainly as we move forward so Paul goes through all this he says he he's placed all these gifts and then he says does everyone have all of these is this what we're talking about here is this what our focus is and then we come to verse 31 he says but covet earnestly the best gifts but then he says and yet show I unto you a more excellent way now Paul would go into 1 Corinthians 13 naturally and he would go in and he'd start talking about charity and charity is that that Greek word Agape which means divine love and it represents the holy spirit in scripture we've talked about before it's only in the New Testament because that's the only place the Holy Ghost was given in the way that we receive it Paul would talk about all these gifts and then he says there's a more excellent way and what is it it's the holy spirit in the individual so that means the gifts can be without the Holy G Holy Spirit as well so that can't be the the the excellent way or the more excellent way it has to come by the holy spirit amen the purpose of the holy spirit is to bring all these gifts subject to God rather than subject to man man amen bring them subject to the spirit of God rather than the spirit of man we're not supposed to covet what other people have but Paul says these are what's available and he says covet them desire them seek after them why that you may edify the body that you might do something good for people that we wouldn't just be warming a Pew I appreciate people that warm the pews it's it's hard to preach the empty pews but that's not the only reason we're here each one of us has purpose and he says seek to help the local body seek the best way that you can but don't pick it seek it and let God give you what he would determine to be the best but then Paul says after all of that he says I show unto you a more excellent way and I know we covered this when we preached on the Statue of a perfect man out of second Peter 1 but I want to read this this chapter of 1 Corinthians 13 because the the thing we've got to realize is that without the Holy Ghost anything you try and do in the body of Christ has no purpose or profit and that's that's our hard thing to say but it's true because what sons of God are led by the spirit of God God puts a spirit in us to lead us and guide us into his will for Eternal value otherwise we just end up Kingdom building for ourselves so the more excellent way the mature way the only way for the believer the acceptable way is found in 1 Corinthians 13 and Paul says though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol he says say if I don't have charity and I do all these things I'm just noise I don't have any real purpose I don't have any real benefit I'm just breaking the silence right the the claim that the Pentecostals have that that that the speaking in tongues is the evidence H Holy Spirit falls falls apart right here because Paul says if I do that and I don't have charity then I'm I'm nothing so I speak with tongues but I don't have charity then I'm just somebody that makes a bunch of noise that's hardly the place for a Believer to make their credit I break up the noise that's no benefit that's no benefit to anybody but this word charity here is that agape and it literally means the Beloved he says without the Beloved if I don't have the Beloved I'm just a noise maker then he says and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing so now he's covered virtually all the gifts that we just talked about in 1 Corinthians 12 all the spiritual gifts if I could put it that way and he says without love without the Holy Ghost I'm nothing though I have those gifts without the Holy Ghost I'm nothing so that means that the gifts and the Holy Ghost are not the same thing are they it means you can have one without the other and that he says and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profits me nothing good works good intentions charitable Works they don't amount to a hill of beans without it being led of the Holy Spirit doesn't mean you don't help people no Mother Teresa never got the Holy Ghost but she helped a lot of people but we're talking about eternal value now but watch while Paul flips the script here now he says charity suffers long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up here's the evidence of having the Holy Spirit we know that the fruits of the spirit follow but Paul's giving us an Evidence of the Holy Spirit here he says charity does not behave itself unseemly doesn't seek her own is not sensually focused ego it's not focused on selfish interests it's not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth it beareth all things it can support whatever load you put on it he says it believeth all things it hopeth all things it endureth all things and then he gives these great three words charity never faileth the Holy Ghost never fails he says but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be know know it shall vanish away you look at that it says prophecies tongues and the word of knowledge that's that's like the trifecta for the charismatic church today that's what everybody's trying to draw people to them with is prophecies tongues and a word of knowledge trying to tell you what's going to happen trying to tell you the blessings of God over you all these different things that's what they do to draw people to themselves and Paul says these will all fail or cease they'll either be false eventually or they'll just stop they'll come to an end so we're supposed to cover the greatest gifts that are available how wonderful it would be if the Holy Spirit would drop down on a brother or sister here and they would stand up and say thus sayeth the Lord and they would warn us of an event that's coming not to go here brother Brown would say or not to go there or don't drive your truck today or or don't go to work today or don't do this or don't do that what to preserve the local body if and wonders were on a constant display in this church it would be a wonderful thing I would love that but that has never been the saving power of God it's it's a benefit but it's not a leader it's not something that we're supposed to be looking to all the time and Paul says without Divine love without the holy spirit all of these things they'll come to nothing they'll come to nothing and you know I've got family that's in the charismatic churches and been raising them and you know what happens is they all just end up going off and filtering into nothing going from fanaticism to fanaticism going from movement to movement why because they don't have the holy spirit inside of them adopted children of God we've got to have the Holy Ghost it's impossible to be in the body of Christ without it we've read before by one Spirit you're baptized into that body but the Holy Ghost is what places people in their proper place it's what puts the gifts in their proper place cuz you can have a gift without the Holy Ghost but you put that gift in its proper place and it's done by the Holy Ghost now you're going to have some real effect in amen and outside of the Holy Ghost outside of the body of Christ we're just playing around that's the way it works brother Bram I've read this quote before he says now I'm telling you all see he says now a few years ago you were children with these gifts playing back and forth but you've been to a long school now it's time to be men not use these just to play with these gifts they're sacred they're of God and you don't play with them he says let's let God use them that's what your ministry wants to be see now I want you to see here he says you can play with them and God can use them so you can have a gift of God in your life you can have a calling you can have a purpose and you can take that and run with it in your own flesh in your own will in your own desire and you can do something with it but he says no no no we've got to the place get to the place where God's the one that's using it that's our ministry is to what let go and let God have his way let God be the one that's working in our lives brother would say this now he he's talking about after you've been born again by the Holy Spirit he says then you've got the right thing the holy spirit is the right thing for us he says then you can use anything he wants to use you in sorry then he can use you to anything he wants to use you in cuz you're in the body and subject to any one of those gifts so God can use you at any time all gifts are not permanent they can drop down the spirit can move it can drop down somebody can stand up they can speak in tongues somebody can interpret they can give a word of knowledge they can give a word of prophecy they can they can worship they can dance in the spirit they can do all of these things it and it can be just a momentary thing why because you're in the body of Christ and you're subject to being used by the Holy Spirit but then he says but see to have one of these gifts outside of the body it would do you no good why because the gifts are there to edify the body if there's no body there then how do you edify you can't he says You' got to be inside of it and then he say he reads the scripture that we just read in 1 Corinthians 13 then he says see don't depend on those things the holy spirit is a being it's God God in you the person God that's lit your whole entire being now we're seeing what the gift really is he says you're changed you're a new creature and any little thing that's wrong he'll tell you that's wrong then quit don't do it say father I didn't mean to do that you forgive me he see that's the Holy Spirit see we get into this idea that gifts are things that it's something that God drops down into your life drops down a gift a special skill or approach or a way of doing things and we have it and that's the gift and that's true but that's not the true gift and we'll see this if we go to the scriptures Paul says this in Romans 11 and he's speaking of Israel and he says as concerning the gospel Israel they are enemies for your sakes they were they were opposed to the early Christian Church they persecuted him then he says but as touching the election are beloved for the father's sake he says Israel is still God's chosen people though they are enemies to the truth now they're still God's chosen people and then he says these words he says for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance so in other words the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable we can't put them away and we can't put them on and God can't say I don't want to use them anymore or I'm not going to give them that anymore or they're not my beloved or they're not my people when God declares it that's it and so God chose Israel first and she's his first love and he's blessed her and he's put a blessing on her and he's put a promise over her and all of these things yet Israel disappointed him time and time again but she never lost her position as his first love amen and he's saying gifts are the same thing God gives them to you God gives liberally and they're real gifts but the vessels aren't always Godly and you can see this with somebody like balum balam was a true anointed Prophet no doubt about it but yet in the end he turns against the will of God and against the people of God and for that he gets killed he dies and in the end they call him a soothsayer because he sold his gift for profit for money amen real gifts false vessels and people use these for their own sakes and and Paul would talk about people like this in second Timothy and he says what they lead captive silly women silly churches silly church goers with sins laid in way with divers lust that's what balum did that's literally balam's Ministry is to lead people into lust the things that they want to hear but then what's a true gift because the gift is not that that that you're you're called to preach or the gift is not that you can speak in tongues or interpret the true gift is the holy spirit working in you perfectly remember Paul says I showed you a more excellent way I'm showing you the way it's supposed to be that's what Paul's driving at the biggest gift that we can get is the holy spirit in US leading us and guiding us and using us that's what brother M says we're now subject to the gifts because of the Holy Spirit we're subject to the Holy Spirit to use the gifts amen so then it's not so much the gifts that are being operated it's what people that are being operated by the Holy Spirit right we are the gifts we are the gifts we have something to offer but we've got to surrender that so so that he can use it that's what makes it perfect that's what makes it work Paul would talk about this in Ephesians 4 and I know I'm teaching tonight but just stay with me he says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men so what are those gifts what are the gifts that Christ gave when he went up and and on his first Ascension it says in verse 11 and he gave some or he gave to some to who he gave to some men Apostles so he didn't give the gift of apostleship to Men He gave Gifts of Apostles to other men what you have here then he says he gave and to some he gave prophets and to some he gave evangelists and some pastors and teachers so what you see here today is a gift I am a gift to you what a wonderful thing for me to preach about this evening I am your gift but that's literally what he's saying here is that the men are the gifts men that are filled with the spirit are the gifts not just the gifts of preaching I can say well I have a gift of preaching I pray I I trust that I do but the real gift is when that man is being used by the Holy Spirit to preach to the body of Believers amen the true gift is not the calling the true gift of the holy spirit inside me making it work according to the way that God intended in the first place amen a real gift is men and women filled with the spirit that the Holy Spirit operates in within their role so that's why this is called the foolishness of preaching because people will say it's a gift of preaching and what they miss is it's the Holy Spirit speaking they miss that the true gift is the holy spirit that's in operation here this ain't me it's the Holy Spirit working and they miss these things right the gift of God to a person is that God would use them that's the real gift not that they would use themselves in any gift or or format that they choose the Difference Maker is God it's the holy spirit it's his life inside of us leading and guiding us amen the gifts fail why cuz we use them that's the failure I'm the weakest link in this whole chain is me Jonathan klette the flesh man is the weakest link in this preaching chain and when I try and use it rather than God use it that's when we're going to get into problems but when I can step out of the way remember brother Ram says my gift is to what get myself out of the way so that he can use me that's what we're talking about brother Brown puts it this way he says but you see Pentecostal people you're going after gifts instead of the givers see come back to God get this real Divine love in your heart your fellowship that all you just love him with all your heart brother then the gifts will take care of itself you just let that alone see It'll come God will place in the church the place that he sees you after he's adopted you into his family he'll call you out someday in a little prayer meeting the first thing you you know and plac the robe upon you and say now son I've sent you to preach the gospel why because he gave them first apostles and Prophets and what this brother B saying these are the first gifts that go out he says then the whole world will know about it that's right he'll call you out and say son I've sent you to pray for the sick people or Roberts was all about praying for the sick that was his ministry was to pray for the sick he says just watch the things fly then when he adopts you into his family but you can't push that you can't mentally work that up God vindicates his gifts God proves his gifts he says but what is the gift without the giver he says that's what's the matter today doesn't that just make it so simple he says we you know we want the power we want the manifestation we want the gifts we want the Greater Works and all these things and he says seek after God get close to God get close in your relationship with him and all these things will be added to you you want more in your life of God get more of God die out more surrender more feed on more that's how we get into these things amen get filled with the spirit every day seek after him and watch what he does inside of our Lives people are looking for for this huge manifestation they're looking for signs and wonders and brother BR saying just get him get him and get him and get him and that'll take care of everything you're looking for and whatever he has for you he'll give it then cuz he sees where your heart is brother Ram says this about himself he says I had to get the Holy Ghost before this gift was manifested that's right brother randam had a gift all his life remember as a young man he talked about that Vision or that that he saw of those men falling off of the the bridge all his life even as a young man as a young boy he had these gifts and but there wasn't a placing of that gift into its proper place until he got the Holy Ghost and then he gets the Holy Ghost and he steps into his preaching Ministry and then the light comes down on the Ohio River and it says as John the Baptist foran the first coming so your message will run the second I send you with a gift of Divine Healing and then he goes out and he starts to use that gift but you'll notice that it's not positionally placed immediately brother bam was not adopted as soon as he got the Holy Ghost because you see the gift is not in perfect operation because what happens is he goes out and he realizes that he has a gift of Divine Healing and he goes out and he starts to have healing campaigns but he starts to now inject himself into the process and what does he do he starts to say bring your worst one bring the sickest person you can find bring the one that's the worst case you can find and bring him up here and God will heal him and what did the angel say to him don't do that he says you're catering to the people you're not doing it the way that I want you to do it and brother bandam has this one and I think he was up there for almost two hours praying for for for a person that was very sick might have been blind I don't remember exactly and he's praying and it comes to his mind what the angel said and he says is God even going to heal this person and in the end God did but brother brandom had to back away from that because he was using the gift instead of what the Holy Spirit leading him the gift was there but he was using it and God honored that gift God honored that man God honored that office but God still rebuked him for it and in the end God pulled away and said don't you do it stop doing it I told you not to do it and brother Bram had to get disciplined for it amen it says in Show and Tell and that's what brother BR was doing was he was turning it into a showand tell whatever Satan can do God Can Do Better God's not here to play games he's not here to show off he's got a purpose and it's to draw people to him brother br says it this way he says and when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he's in you with your temperament that's part of the earth and vessels we've been talking about my temperament is not the same as yours and you know what my temperament is good for some things and my temperament is really not good for other things and some of you have me beat six ways past Sunday in certain areas with your temperament you're way better at at approaching people in certain situations ations than I am but this isn't an excuse for us to stay in our stinginess or our rudess or our aloofness or our isolation or whatever it is silliness whatever it might be no no no but he's saying God will work with you God will shape you God will mature us God will trim us to where we need to be but he says he works with you with your temperament but he is living his own life to his own will through you he says hallelujah you're so yielded you are that Christ speaks the kinds of words he would speak he thinks the kind of thoughts he would think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you he says you are yielded and resting we're talking about adoption he's saying who's doing the work you're yielded and resting what a beautiful picture he says of the Christian consecrated Christian yielded it's Christ that's working through what relax let go he's got this this is his work brother Brown say so many times if I could heal you I would if I could do this for you I would if I could do that for you I would but it's him and him alone and in most cases he's already done it and all I'm trying to do is get you to have faith to believe it to accept it for yourself the gifts are not being given to convince people you won't find in in scripture where where gifts are converting people but when the word comes that's what changes Hearts remember the scripture says it's what that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word that's how these things happen and and Peter comes down on the day of Pentecost and everybody's hearing them speak in their own tongue completely Supernatural but that did not convert them and in fact they misinterpreted and said you guys are drunk so even though they they had the signs and wonders there Jesus said though one raised from the dead they won't believe it Jesus did every work in front of them and it didn't save a soul but what did it do it caught the attention of the True Believer so that when the word came forth they would believe it and that's what we see because we look at at Peter and he did not say thou Hast The Works of eternal life he says Thou H has the words of eternal life that's why we believe you that's what we hold on to is because your words they spirit and Truth they've got power behind them it's not the the evidence of the the signs and wonders that held them it was the word that matched up with the word that held them signs and wonders will never change a person's nature they won't do it people will see a genuine miracle and they'll convince themselves out of it a week later I didn't see it it was a trick it didn't happen da da d d that and and next thing you know they're right back where they were why it doesn't change people it just draws attention to God it's a sign that's all it's a sign pointing to the real work that God's trying to do look at Israel Israel was in the desert they were delivered under the supernatural power of God and spent 40 years in the desert being supernaturally fed and clothed and sheltered and all these things the literal presence of God above them every single day and all but two died in the wilderness living under a Ministry of signs and wonders the signs and wonders don't hold us that's why Paul said covet to seek the best gifts and he said what's the best gift pure leadership by the Holy Spirit perfect leadership by the Holy Spirit Holy Spirit leadership is the greatest gift God can give a Believer because when you're under his leadership it doesn't matter where you are what you're doing or you're facing you can have confidence that he put me here and I can walk through that's our resting places that he calls us he places us he pushes us into these things and he backs us up every time because we're in his will we're in his way we're in his purpose we'll get to leadership in another service Lord willing brother Braham says this we're talking about gifts we're talking about placing somebody asked me some time ago shall we seek our gifts now for our Ministries it was some meth Methodist Brethren who had just received the Holy Ghost I said no don't you do that when you do then God can't use you I said the only thing to do is just go ahead being a Christian if God has called you he'll place you just exactly where you belong usually those who seek and try to get things if God would give them something they'd more or less be a stuffed shirt why because we seek things that we want it can be because you get money because you get influence you get Fame impact whatever it is see we tend to seek things that are best for us that's human nature and that's something we've always got to keep underneath but he says no you just live a Christian Life and then whatever God gives you you stay right with that he says if you look you know you look at Moses and Paul Moses was passionate about his position he was passionate about being a deliverer so much so that he an Egyptian but where did it get him what he overstepped God's timeline and it got him nowhere he sought to become a deliverer in his own in his own way of doing things and it didn't get him anywhere look at Paul Saul at the time he he's a passionate professing believer and in that passion he is persecuting the very Christ the very god of the Bible that he believed all relig Zeal all with good intentions going after people he thought were Heretics killing them putting them in jail beating them whipping them both of these men seeking after something they thought they'd been ordained to do made a mess of everything and what happens in the end once God gets through with them now they learn to sit back and wait and Moses spends 40 years on the backside of the desert getting every bit of skill and knowledge and training beaten out of him and becoming a humble Shepherd and then God takes him a and God just has one little five minute conversation with him from a burning bush and he turns him into a deliverer with a staff in his hand and that's it see if we try and push into it that's when we get into problems Moses murderer laughing stock just a Shepherd that's what he had to become before God could use him Paul you know so many times what holds us back is our early failures in our Zeal in our youthful enthusiasm as Believers I'm seeing some nodding heads here obviously I've struck a cord what do you do what what do we do not what do you do what do we do what we presume and we get ahead of god good intentions just trying to do something for the body of Christ many times and what do we do we make a mess and you know what Satan does is he tries to use that mess to tell us we can't ever try that again but that's not the way God works see that's part of these Earth and vessels so that the Excellency is of God and not of us and so often what happens is we mess up and then we think well I can't ever do that again God will never use me that way I'm not even going to try about it and all God wants us to do is just sit back and wait for him and when we get to a place of maturity we get to a place where we can truly seek his will we can wait on him all of a sudden God steps in and we are doing exactly what we wanted to do all along or we felt to do all along but this time it's him instead of me this time it's him instead of you but Paul had to get over that Paul had to get over his conscience can you imagine I I don't know how Paul did it frankly he went for years just persecuting and killing people and putting them in jail and only to realize that it was the very thing that he should have been believing all along but yet he did it that's the power of God in a believer's life amen don't worry about your failures that's the thing that tends to hold me back I like Perfection and you know what I'll never be perfect younger Pastor dealing with people lots of uncomfortable situations I want everything to go perfectly but guess what there's no perfection in this body my perfection is in Christ so I'm going to fail I'm going to mess up but that just proves God's graciousness it proves how great he is cu by the time I'm done getting myself out of the way and all my mistakes then people know it's only God that can do these things anyways because obviously brother John can't do it because he's tried and failed too many times it takes God to do this brother says here but here we find that God in spite of all the failures Moses had done he still had his hand on him he said and he called him to go to do a service called him to his commission what a a consolation that must have been to Joshua when he heard God say as I was with Moses so will I be with you he says although if I'm trying and I fail God won't leave me I never have much confidence in anybody that's too afraid to do anything I'd rather be found a failure than too lazy to try those of us that tend to lean towards Perfection can lead to inactivity because if we can't be perfect we won't do it in the first place that's not God's way God says let me be the perfect one you be the willing and yielded one he says God don't hold you responsible for your mistakes praise the Lord all our good intentions all our flaws whatever it might be God doesn't hold us responsible for that he says he holds you responsible for your willful sin he that sins willfully after he's received the knowledge of Truth he says there's no more there's no more covering of the the sins by the blood he says but a man that's going to do something hear this now we're talking about adoption adoption means you're going to be put into action he says any man that's going to do something is going to blunder he's going to fall he's going to make mistakes it's a real encouraging service tonight you will fall I will fall I have fallen amen he says but if he's really divinely called and God is in his heart he'll rise again that's what I can I I can live that I can say Lord just Lift Me Up give me another shot help me to learn from my mistakes so that you can have a perfect work in my life amen CU so often what happens is I you you yeah I I I slip I fall things don't go the way I think they should have my response isn't as as as as good as it could have been you sit back and and I say I thought I was better than that I thought I was more mature than that I thought I have more of this or more of that so what it's God working in me that's all that matters he'll pick me up he'll hold me up he'll raise me up we look through scriptures how many flawed people did God work with every one of them every single one that God worked with the Great Men the great women of scripture all had their flaws and failures and moments of humanity and carnality and falling away in from Faith even we make mistakes that's the humanity of us but when I look through the word and I see the wonderful things God used through people that were as flawed as I am I say praise the Lord he can still use me then and he can still use you why the Perfection is not through us it's through the blood of Jesus Christ but the prophet is been telling us he's saying seek after God focus on him the rest will follow don't try to be something special that's the worst thing we can do is try and be something special we're special because he chose us in and of itself that makes us special makes us elect amen but he's saying don't try and claim anything special just be humble just be simple you be you and let God be God and that'll work really really well if we can do that brother M says this he says that's the way it is with the Holy Spirit he says we don't have to be peculiar to be different or be anything more just let loose and live a Godly life and just let God live through you this is that rest we're talking about just sitting back and saying Lord just live through me he says that'll glow for the gospel see not glitter glitter that just makes monkeys jump at things like that anything that Glitters he says you know they're always jumping for something that's shiny but he says that but glow is the soft mellow sweetness of the Holy Spirit but notice here he starts out he says you don't have to be peculiar be different or be anything more Church we're pilgrims and strangers here just looking at our lives people are going to see we're different we don't have to make ourselves different either we're different or we're not but we don't have to try and force a difference Our Lives alone will cause separation it'll cause people to see that we're different amen we're not of this world if we've got the Holy Ghost we are not of this world and we don't fit in and eventually people realize it it's amazing how I'm seeing things happen with people I work with and people that I I I spend time with outside of this and and they just keep coming back with more questions and and you just sit there and you say Lord help me to be a test testimony and everything that they're asking because they don't understand and they're trying to understand and many of them I just had one with a colleague this week and just out of the blue he emailed me and I was able to give him my full testimony of why I'm here and why I moved back to New Finland and these things but he confessed that he's feeling he's got issues with where he's at in life and unsure of if what he's doing is going to have an impact and and these different things and what's he seeing he's seeing somebody that believes they're having an impact and so he's saying what's going on in your life but he comes at it this way and he comes at it that way cuz he's trying to see what makes me different I didn't have to go tell them I'm Different just living the life of Christ makes us different and it'll draw people to us it's that glow where a city on a hill that can't be hid don't try and force it we don't try and force doctrinal differences when I'm talking to a Pentecostal or a Baptist I don't go right to the heart of the matter and try and tear down speaking of tongues as an Evidence or do you have the Holy Ghost to a Baptist or no I try and let them see the Life of Christ in Me Above All Else and to be meek and gentle and salty and hope that that gives them enough time to sit back and actually consider what I might say rather than just dismiss it because I'm trying to force myself to be different we don't need to do those things amen words are cheap and so often what we do is we can speak in a way that causes division where it's unnecessary let them pull away let them Force the division but if you can get along with somebody stay with them as long as you can just per chance God might give them a revelation of this end time message of what's going on of the truth that's been revealed in this age amen but words are cheap and lots of people are out there talking but it's a life lived before them that really gets people's attention we want to be those living Epistles we read about earlier Amen brother B says this he says we're adopted by the father into the fellowship and into the body of Believers by the Holy Ghost and a Vindicated Ministry proving he says you don't have to talk so much about it God does his own talking God testifies of his gifts but all those gifts are wonderful they're Dandy and we love them all God grant that every one of us would have every gift but I'd rather have the giver than all the gifts Paul said though I could have the gifts without the giver without charity without the love of God without the Holy Spirit those gifts are nothing he said says now if we had went to seeking the giver instead of the gifts I believe the church would have been further up the road don't you think so if we stayed close to God and loved him and just kept living for him and not trying to push things over we we look and we see where we're at in this time we we have an end time message that tells us what's happening and what's supposed to happen and I feel sometimes we're trying to push it to make it happen rather than saying L saying Lord just help me catch it as it happens I don't want to catch it after it's happened I want to catch it while it's happening because it's a part of me it's a part of you it's a part of this local body of Believers amen don't try and push it he says just live for God live a pure holy life and live and pray every day and keep yourself refreshed in his presence and God will take care of the rest of it I've said this before about myself I'll say it again when I start to get impatient when I start to look at people around me when I start to get critical it's because I haven't been in his presence amen the scripture would talk about brother Brandon would talk about that Dew in the morning that refreshes the plants that makes them ready to face the heat of the day whatever's going to come their their way that de in the morning refreshes them and it gives them enough to get them through the day and when I don't get that and I don't get that for maybe a couple days what happens is I get brittle and what do I do I start to push against those that I ought to love most and my wife will suffer and my kids will suffer maybe the congregation will suffer and maybe my preaching will get harder why because I'm not spending the time in his presence that I need to that's where my refreshment is it's when I force my way when I fight my way to his presence otherwise life gets busy and I can find every excuse in the world not to do it these mornings I get up and I got to go and drive to Physio and I'm there for an hour and a half and then you come back and then work's waiting for you and you're trying to get through on your devotions and you're trying to do this and you got to drive for work and meetings and study and this and it all builds up on you and what happens is we get brittle because we're not taking that time to just set it down and sit back and spend a little bit of time with him amen when we start looking at other people when I start looking at other people you know where the problem is right here amen if I start looking at other believers the beam is in my eye because the holy spirit's not running around having me to correct your life as a person over this Pulpit maybe but as as an individual to an individual it's not the holy spirit will not criticize it'll correct in love at most and what it really ought to do is take me to my knees in prayer not to criticize not to put people down not to put them out or any of these things what isn't I haven't lost my Christianity I've lost the joy I've lost the peace that's what that's what David did David needed a refreshing he said restore to me the joy of my salvation he hadn't lost that he hadn't lost salvation but he'd lost the joy of it he'd lost the refreshing of the spirit of God in his life that's what we've got to fight for fight for that everything else will take its place every day we need to be in his presence to seek after him to give him time to just shut our our minds down and and just dwell on the things of God for a little bit but as we start to close this evening I want to set us up for this next service with just a few thoughts and this is the this is the moment I've been waiting for in this entire series is what we're going to talk about now and it's about our predestinated place and what is our adopted positions if I were to walk through the church from Sister Lydia all the way back to to to little brother Levi back there and these different ones to walk through and say what is your adopted position if you were to say brother John what is my adopted position we're going to answer that question tonight and this is what I've been waiting for for all of this I think it's a beautiful thing but I'm going to start Us in Romans 12 and Paul says for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we be many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that's given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministry or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhorting he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness all of us have these different places and things and when you look there not all of those seem like spiritual gifts giving anybody can give right but it says with diligence Mercy givers your position in the body could be a mercy Giver you could also be a a minister a preacher of some sort but he says I'm ministering Ministry just means a place of service so he says whatever it is whatever your place of service is wait on that wait till God shows it to you and then brother Bram starts us out and we're talking about now what is our positions what is he's calling us into and he says God will place in the church the place that he sees you after he's adopted you into his family he'll call you out someday in a little prayer meeting the first thing you know place the robe upon you and say now son I've sent you to preach the gospel the whole world will know about it that's right he'll call you out and say son I've sent you to pray for the sick people we read this earlier all right now that's a great quote it matches up with what we read in Romans 12 it matches up with what we read read in Ephesians 4 about the gifts of God and that that are sent in and apostles the fivefold ministry in these different things but then Paul told us if you remember in 1 Corinthians 12 he says are all Apostles are all teachers are all workers of Miracles we're looking at adoption this positional placing and the first thing we're told about every time is the ministering of the word that always leads okay we see it on the day of Pentecost and it's always been that way but we can't always be preachers we can't all be preachers and we can't all be one type of preacher and the sisters sitting here aren't allowed to be preachers at all so it can't just be about preachers amen it can't just be about the ministers that stand behind this Pulpit but whatever our ministry is that's what it we're looking for amen remember Paul gives us a glimpse in Romans 12 he says each one of us has our ministry tree our place of service and Paul says for some of you that's giving for some of you it's governments it's management it's helping out around the church for others it's being merci merciful so it's not just preaching the word it's not just signs and wonders so we read that quote in the beginning where brother Ram says he'll call you to a place and he'll speak to you and he'll anoint you and he'll give you great gifts and powers and Paul's telling telling us what that looks like it's not all some big Fanfare it's not all some big Public public show it's not all standing behind a Pulpit amen but it's what it's a body Ministry it's each one of us presenting Christ in a particular way and it's individuals fulfilling the word of God according their individual purposes each one of us has an element of ministry are you ready for this this is it are you ready we're almost done are you ready to hear what adop positions are available in this body of Christ here we go this is wonderful the church positionally before the foundation of the world okay what he's about to talk about is what God saw in his mind before we ever came into begin okay when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife adopted housewife but John are you serious he is an adopted housewife to be a farmer what my position the body of Christ is to be a farmer that ain't spiritual where's the gift where's the great power where's the evidence that everyone's going to see to be a preacher praise the Lord to be a prophet or to be this or to be that he placed you positionally so we look at it as this big thing that he's going to place us into something we've never been before rather than recognizing that what he has placed us into is our position in the first place if it's within his will adopted teachers adopted machinists adopted operations people adopted snow clearing people adopted hearing a practitioners even adopted engineers we're sitting here and we're waiting for this big explosion someday I'm going to be adopted and the prophet of God's saying most of you are already there and you just don't know it most of you are there and you just don't know it each one of us has access to people he says he's got no hands but yours no feet but yours no mouth but yours so when I look around this room and I see the access we have to people that's where the ministry comes in is because you've got a place that I can't get and I've got a place you can't get and you've got an approach and you've got a way that you can what deal with the people that are around you guess what brother Matt as a bluecollar worker has a way better camaraderie with those people than I ever will I get along just fine but in the end I'm an engineer I'm the one that makes things difficult right sisters get along better with women and can reach places with women that men can't or shouldn't amen then you look at Housewives you say how can that be adopted look at the access you have to young people to other mothers to other children all of these things and what is it it's Christ trying to flow throughout the whole world to reach the entire one every single one out there that needs to do it through you and through me through your little humble Life we'll get into what that looks like in the next service but I want you to to do this sisters listen up and if each one of you in here has not been positionally placed he says you might be nothing but a housewife he's not putting down a housewife he's saying you're looking at it this way it's us that puts these things down and the prophet saying you're housewife he says catch this now you well you say brother brandom I've never done a thing in my life I'm not a preacher I think if we could get this idea that it's all on the ministry out of our heads I'm not saying it's here but we tend to put it on the ministry don't we this is a body Ministry he says well maybe God brought you here to raise a family of children and out of that family of children may come another family of children that'll be a preacher that'll send a million souls to Christ he says you had to be here you had to be at your post of Duty you had to be faithful to raise them in the what nurture and admonition of the Lord he said you're here for a purpose do you know that he's trying to get us to recognize if God has placed you there's purpose and you're there because he's placed you not because you married a man and you got pregnant you're not a mother because you can't can be a mother you're mother because he ordained you to be a mother you're a wife because he ordained you to be a wife you're a machinist because he ordained you to be a machinist you're whatever it might be he's ordained you for that he's trying to get you to see if you've got the Holy Ghost and he has placed you in that position there's so much more that's going on than you realize amen let's stand together if we would even if you might not be nothing but a housewife adoption so high so lofty nothing we can attain to until the very last few days before the resurrection and Rapture that's what adoption has made out been made out to be for so long brother brah says you had to be here you had to be in that position you had to recognize that God's working through you so that he could do something special we read that quote at the beginning where brother Braham says God wants to speak to a person anoint them give them something special great powers and gifts to work his will and here he says nothing but a housewife nothing but a farmer nothing but a mother how's that look like and what's really available to us remember what we read he says we're living below our privileges remember what brother Brown said he said he says when the church realizes when the bride of Christ recognizes her position he says the Rapture will go that's what he's trying to do is help us to see this isn't some great big future event it's going on right now and you're a part of it and he's trying to get us to see it he's trying to get us to see what he's trying to do brother brandham before the seals he would preach God in Simplicity God is what hidden in Simplicity and revealed in the same and we're trying to make it into some big event and what you see time and time again in the scripture is just simple humble Victorious Believers and God steps in and uses them God steps in and uses them God steps in and uses them God steps in and uses them and all they had to do was recognize he's there and he's called me and he's made it available to me and all of a sudden things start to happen What when they recognize that he answers prayer that his promis is for them that it doesn't take somebody special it doesn't take a minister it doesn't take a man doesn't take a great gift it just takes somebody that'll take God at his word and be led by the spirit and we'll see these things start to follow in their life amen we'll get into that in the next service amen the greatest gift is a human being in the hands of God that's what adoption is you in his hands so he can use you and however that looks however that looks it's with power it's with authority you can have great expectation that God's got a purpose that God's going to use you for wonderful things in his kingdom isn't that just so beautifully simple my when I read that I thought what could hold us back if we'd only recognize right where I'm at doing what he's doing when we're matured don't get me wrong this is not something we we just step into immediately but when we've matured when we've been proven the things that God is wanting to do through us just in the humble Simplicity of everyday Believers not just ministers but in each and every one men and women boys and girls wherever they might be in the body of Christ to place them in there and start working through their lives so that people can see Christ all over again what a wonderful thing we've got amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord It's just little old me and a bunch of other little old people Lord we're nothing special Lord there's no great ones Among Us just a little Humble Church here in the middle of nowhere Lord but you called us Lord and in that calling is an election for purpose Lord
