head that he was having and he was out uh with the family at a function and then when they left they were coming to their uh car and he just stopped because his legs just froze and he was uh like they were paralyzed so uh he's and so he's still suffering from It Whatever It Is they don't know I guess doctors are looking at that so uh we were asked to pray for him as well he's only 6 years old and uh his body started started to just stiffen up and he can't move he can't move his legs also uh I got a call from Brother Dale and brother Dale uh he said to me he said to me you remember he said when uh I was diagnosed with uh with prostate cancer he said um I had to test and you know the normal like it was for PSA right it's the blood test to check the prostate and uh he said uh well we well we know that the I think the normal range is around 10 the number 10 give or take depending on the age and all that but it's in that range anyway his count was 200 and so that triggered uh of course that triggered action on the doctor's part and that sort of thing and kind of medication things then he went and U before he left he had another uh blood test for PSA to see how that was going and it went up to 250 so he was going in the wrong direction so on Saturday pass he he went into a walk-in clinic that um was offering uh was offering PSA test for uh men between the age of 40 and 70 he said well I think I'll try that so he went in and got a blood test and he just got the results he's down to 41 that's what he said and that's what we're all saying is praise the Lord that that was just um it just wonderful he didn't even call his family first I don't know if I should say it I over here he called me right away he said I want everybody to know he said I want the Saints to know so uh anyway

tonight sick Lord sister Kimberly sister Selena brother Chad Lord these different ones Lord we pray your grace to them each one that you would touch them heal them Lord restore them back we pray Lord bless us now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen God bless you each one welcome each one of you here tonight amen I saw the grants just slid in nicely God bless you brother Garfield you know brother Garfield's going to take a service here in the not too distant future Lord willing but he was saying brother John I can't take Wednesdays because classes finish at 6 and I can't even get to church much less get there to preach and so what they did is somehow they worked it out that they move his class backwards an hour so now he can make it to church on Wednesday night sometimes if he's not working so I say praise the Lord praise the Lord amen we if we have a sincere desire I believe God gives us those desires amen especially as it relates to doing what his word asks us to do amen that's good and good to see sister Nikki here as well she hasn't been feeling well for past week or so so we're very thankful to see her as well God bless you amen I spoke with brother Barry coffee before service and he has confirmed he'll be here for Saturday February 22 and Sunday February 23 so he's going to do uh the Saturday with the married couples it's primarily L intended for those of us that still have children and whatnot maybe going through the the the the trying times still but anyone that's married is certainly welcome to come along and do that so we'll have two sessions probably from 10: till 12: and then 2: to 4:00 and we'll have a nice lunch in between Lord willing but we'll confirm those those times as we get closer to it and then he'll also preach the Sunday service and then we'll have a fellowship as well so sister Amber I believe is going to be leading that Fellowship planning so sister she'll be reaching out to you um just to confirm the deacons wives are handling the the standard church fellowships and they'll be alternating so sister Amber will take the first one sister Priscilla the second one and back and forth and so they have my full Authority they have my full support please support them in whatever way they ask you to do it and it'll make everyone's lives easier amen God bless you 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and 12 very familiar scripture he says for as the body is one and had many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ Paul's taking a an example here of our own body and how we've got all these different parts in our body and yet together they still make up one body and the fact that they're different doesn't make them any less a part of the body then he says this this beautiful scripture that we've referenced so many times he says for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body so the only way you can get into this body of Christ is by the Holy Spirit that's the thing that binds us together amen that's the thing that keeps us together that's the thing that keeps us working together and it's a holy spirit that does this placing this positioning that gives us our part in the body of Christ amen it is not our choosing it is his choosing is not our placing it's his placing it's not our timing it's his timing it's all done by him he says so whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost and and perhaps we'll be happy to know we moved on from that question we preached on six services on how do I know I have received the Holy Spirit and hopefully we've settled some things and and and answered some questions but really we wanted to to show there the progression of the Walk of a child of God Amen that getting the holy spirit is just really the start of this and then from there you grow and you mature and there's a work that the Holy Spirit does and so we can't expect to be everything that we read in our Bible on the first day amen but we grow as children in Christ and we grow up into mature adults and God never expects us to be everything right up front and if you want some some evidence for that just go read your Bible because you'll see there especially as we're under the New Covenant the New Testament Paul does not talk about everything as if it was in the past as in you got the Holy Ghost and now everything's in the past you don't fight you don't struggle you don't have to grow you don't have things that God has to deal with in your life but rather you see there in the scriptures that Paul you know we're reading in Corinthians Corinthians was the church that needed the greatest instruction it seems and like I said last service or the service before we all have a little bit of Corinthians in us we've got areas that we need to to to bring into subjection and God's got to mature us he's got to beat some things out and he's got to put some things in and so you see people that were newborns in Christ you have people that were sincere raised in a good home that were were raised under the message of the power and came right into this truth as it was revealed in these different things you have people that were atheists you had people that were perverted you have people from all sorts of Lifestyles and backgrounds and the Bible addresses every single one of them amen and it it shows us that we have to grow in Grace in God now last service we focused on the fruit of the spirit and we spoke how the fruit of the spirit is primarily meant for others mine's meant for yours yours is meant for Mine mine's not really meant for mine and yours is not really meant for you but it's a sacrifice and it's an offering that we give to people that pass our way and that God brings our way more to the point because really when we think about it most of us don't like our fruit being picked it doesn't feel good in that sense that's what I mean by that it doesn't feel good to have somebody eat your your patience or or your long suffering or these different things but we're meant to be able to absorb things that other people can't because of the holy spirit inside of us amen but I want to move forward from the the fruit of the spirit now to start talking about the gifts of the Spirit because while these gifts are not the evidence of the holy spirit in our personal lives yet they have been given to the church for its benefit and for its health and for its growth amen they are there they're part of the body of Christ today they have not gone away just because they may not be here doesn't mean they've gone away but they are in the bride they are available and they are for our good all the gifts are there for for for our good Amen brother Brandon would point to every gift and so often it was the Divine Healing but he would say all the gifts are available to the church tonight and we'll read even where he says things like this but I want to take us to the start of 1 Corinthians 12 here it's already there there we go and it says now there are diversities of gifts now these are what we would call Grace gifts they are spiritual gifts of the holy spirit there's nine of them but there's many varieties and types amen but catch this now nobody has them all no one has everything because otherwise they would be a body unto themselves and that's a denomination we don't want that amen but and God doesn't want it that way but they are there are diversities of gift there's different types but it's the same spirit and that word spirit in the original is the same breath the same life so in other words the gifts are alive by the spirit they're not alive by me they're not alive by you but it's the working of the power of God the spiritual gifts these nine spiritual gifts are meant to be operated by the Holy Spirit not by me and not by you amen they're not ours they're his they're meant to express the kingdom of God they're meant to help the kingdom of God and so we can't change how those gifts work but you look around today and especially you see in Pentecost they have changed the way many of these gifts work because they're using them rather than being used to employ them in the body and brother Brandon would spend a great deal of time trying to correct especially the Pentecostal church about this because the holy spirit always works according to the word it's not according to my will or my feeling or what's going to work or what you think will work but it's by his and I saw an example maybe to to share this this evening that I saw a man that was a so-called prophet and he was wanting to exhibit this this gift that he had so he said I want you to look at this water bottle and he he called somebody up from the the the the congregation he says I want you to look at this bottle is it sealed it was a water bottle it was clear he says I want you to look at this is this a sealed water bottle the man said yes he says now watch this and he he prayed and he said some words that sounded very spiritual in these things and and he said gave it to the man he says now break the cap and taste it and the man tastes it he says how's it taste he says it tastes sweet and he said see I just turned the water into wine didn't change color he didn't taste it before and after he just drank it and he said it taste sweet so when we look at that and we compare it to the gift that was in the Bible how did Jesus turn water into wine he didn't do it in public he didn't do it to make a big kafuffle cuz this guy did it and of course the whole church blew up because everyone believed he just turned water into wine but Jesus did it in secret and he didn't just changed the taste of the water he changed it into wine it changed its chemical composition its color its taste it tasted like aged wine it was the best wine that they had at that thing but this guy sits here stands there and he makes this big Grand gesture and he's he's trying to mimic what Jesus did and when we take that gift and we compare it to the word the only conclusion we can come up with is false prophet because he's not working the gift is not working the way the spirit did the first time now you look at brother bram's gift and what would he do every time he was doing the gift the gift was being used in his life he would point you back to scripture so that you could see the god behind the gift rather than get stuck on the man through the gift being operated he would say what did Jesus do what happened when Abraham was sitting in the plains of mammory and this man came and talked to him in the tent he said do you see what it was and when Christ came and he spoke to that woman at the well what was he saying he's saying Christ is using a gift again he wasn't trying to make you believe in him he was trying to make you believe in the god behind him right a son of man revealing the son of man and he was pointing and he was making it perfectly scriptural the sign in the hand he would point to Moses that had the sign in the hand he brought it back to the scriptures so that you could have confidence that it was a scripturally applied gift being used by the Holy Spirit rather than just a man putting on a show Paul continues then and he says now there are differences of administrations this word administrations means Ministries office Services supports and it's in a religious Contex and context and the original phrase there is really inferring the temple duties so these are typically formal uh offices and and the meaning of that word administrations is that they are they are waiting at a table so it is about serving not about Authority it's about serving so it is not for somebody to go out and make themselves something but rather they make you something by serving you we're talking about the work of the Holy Spirit do you see how this ties in with the fruit because if you don't have the fruit you can't be in these gifts because you'll never use them you'll never be used of them appropriately because you'll make it about yourself rather than the person you're trying to help he says so this is difference of administrations Ministries offices but it's the same Lord so notice now he went from The Same Spirit it's all talking the same person church but he says in the first one it's the same spirit that using it now under administrations he says it's the same Lord because why they're under the same chain of command in other words they have to be able to work together you can't be in this portion of the gifts the administrations and not be able to work together because you all answer to the same commander-in-chief you're all under the same general and he doesn't the scripture says he's not the author of confusion he's not the author of chaos and so if you are under his command and I under his command and we're butting heads guess what one of us is wrong or we're both wrong let's not let's not put it on you or you put it on me maybe both of us is wrong but if you can stay in your lane if you can do what you've been commanded to do then nobody gets in anybody else's way and it's a beautiful place to be because everybody's now exactly working at their highest efficiency because shoulder are all put to the wheel rather than one person steering this way and one person steering that way and one going backwards and one going forwards and one trying to go up no it doesn't work that way under the same Lord we are in a chain of command that brings Clarity and efficiency not chaos and confusion and conflict amen so we're working for the same one and he keeps us in harmony then he says in verse six now there are diversities of operations that word means workings or effects today is the the buzzword is what impacts this is there are there are diversities there's difference impacts and it means work any work that's done for the kingdom of God that is effective he says but in all this it's the same God which worketh all in all so it's from God from start to finish verse four verse 5 and six so gifts administrations operations whatever it's been done if it's truly a benefit God is the one that's working in every one of those areas now we look at all of these and so often people will focus on the gifts administrations and operations but Paul's pointing here the key here is not to have an Administration a gift or an operation it's to have the same Spirit that's the only unifying thing that's what makes us a body is you've got the Holy Spirit I've got the Holy Spirit and we're being led by that Holy Spirit remember the Bible says sons of God are led by the spirit of God not just that they have it but they've learned to be led by that thing amen so it's spirit-led not just anointed and we'll see that as we go through and we' preached on it many times anyways so we can have a false a real anointing on a false vessel and so that will lead to to to difficult times for sure because their soul is not in alignment with the word of God there isn't a surrender there and so they're using the gift rather than being led and we see that even amongst this church and any church I guess you know we've got musicians that are here and they play and we're so thankful for them but listen sister Moren I'm going to use your name tonight if we got the greatest piano player in the world and they came into this church would we put them behind that piano nope why because they have to be spirit-led not just gifted see Paul didn't say there are diversities of gifts there's diversities of ministrations and diversities of operations he says but the Same Spirit the same Lord and the same God working all in all we've all got to be under that anointing the same anointing the same vision the same influence the same unction amen and so when people come into this church they may be very gifted but unless we know them and they have been tested beforehand then we have to get to know them and test them amen and they have to show that they are under the Same Spirit and the same it's not just spirit it's commitment it's all of these things they have to prove they're a part of the body before they can have an influence on the body the the the crazy thing is we're less picky about people flowing through than people that stay here listen a visiting Minister comes through almost any time the pastor will say Hey brother get up and take a service for us let's hear what God's doing with your life and sometimes when we do that sometimes we have Services we probably wish we didn't have don't we every church has had it every church I've been to we've had Clunkers people that come in they preach just something strange but you know what we do we shrug it off maybe the pastor gives a little bit of correction the next service after the brother's gone and we move on with life but if you're in this church what happens is now you are here and you have influence and you have impact and people know you and if you say or do something that's off the word now that has a far greater effect than if you're just passing through so that's why we try the spirits and that's why there's a waiting period for certain offices you can't serve in an in a in a a voted office in this church unless you've been here at least 6 months that's to give us time to get to know you to test your spirit and to see if you can be under the same vision that's what it's all about amen it's very practical but Paul has it there for a reason we have to try the spirits we have to test the people they have to be proved amen so the only thing consistent in all of these is God God is in control that's that's the key message to get out of there remember what brother BR says my gift is not the the discernment or the the laying on of hands or the prayer of faith he says my gift is to get myself out of the way and this is all Paul is trying to say here if you can get yourself out of the way things will happen that otherwise cannot happen it takes that getting out of our way amen we don't need gifts what we need is Christ and if we have Christ then the gifts will follow behind just like signs and wonders and these different things amen we're not looking for manifestations we're looking for the person of Christ and when he comes he'll make himself known he'll make himself revealed we can't hide it you can't hide the eternal life that's inside of you it'll break forth in one way or another it has to because they are expressions of him and we'll see what that looks like as we go through so Paul's saying make sure you got the Holy Spirit you know we don't need signs we need to be the sign really isn't that what we are we're a we're a epistle seen and read of all men some of it is by the supernatural but a lot of it is the day-by-day ability to go through life and not get chopped to pieces to keep the victory through all that we're going but in all of these gifts as we go through them tonight until we surrender them to God until we let him use it rather than us use it we'll never see the full impact we'll never see what could really be done with that in a kingdom of God way until we let him have it because the question is going to be who's doing the work who's in control if it's him it's going to have way different results than it's me and if it's him rather than you you're going to see a difference in the things that come through so we got three different categories here we've got gifts administrations and operations now the gifts are the nine spiritual gifts and we don't tend to focus on those a great deal and I think it's because we've seen the Trap that that it got that it had for Pentecost because they came to the gifts and they didn't go to the giver and they refused the fullness of the word the opening of the word and so it seems like many times that that we've taken them we've said well we don't need them anymore because we have the word that's not true what would is is we place the preeminence where it needs to be which is on the word of God that is always the preeminence and Paul when he comes in and he sets the church in order he would Point them to charity he point them to the Holy Ghost when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done away but that doesn't mean the gifts were done away with listen under the restoration of the Bride tree gifts came back they're not brought back so we can throw them away today listen we don't throw away justification hey that was that was Luther's message did we throw that away you better not otherwise your conscience will be burning you up sanctification a cleaned up life if we throw that away church then the Holy Spirit can't use us and then the gifts the gifts are there for the health and the benefit of the body and then there's the Holy Spirit himself and that's really the key point because the Holy Spirit leads us into all truth he points us to the word and then he makes it a reality but all of these all of these restoration Ministries we build on those Ministries today we're not lutherans we're we're not um methodists but we believe that portion of their message absolutely we had to because that was the Holy Spirit restoring the word back to us amen so all of these things uh I'm saying that to say this it's not up to us to put the gifts on the Shelf that's for God to do amen our portion is to say Lord I'm Available that's it I'm available not to force it not to try and make it into something not to try and manifest it that's the the worst thing you can do is try and manifest the promise of God it takes him a gift of God it takes him to do that sort of thing amen so the gifts the nine spiritual gifts we're going to talk a little bit about them tonight but then after that we have administrations and this is primarily your five-fold ministry but it's also your formal offices within the church so it's your Apostles evangelists prophets pastors teachers as Ephesians 4 says but it also includes the Practical side of the ministry so that will include brother Matt and brother Joe as deacons they're a part of the administration of the church body they help keep it in order we've got our trustees brother Bob and brother via we've got our treasur brother Mark we've got brother Paul as the Sunday School Superintendent these are all formal offices and officers that are working to keep the body working together cleanly they're formal they have a declared Duty everybody knows who they are and and nobody gets to be a deacon except brother Matt and brother Joe for this year doesn't mean you don't have insights or anything but they are the ones that do that that's their Lane and so we let them do their Lane amen same with the treasur nobody goes to brother Mark and tries to tell them how to manage the finances he's been voted in with the confidence of the people to do that and we trust him to do it and he's doing a great job and then brother Bob and brother Vel we can say I would like it this way or I would like it that way but in the end they are the ones that look at the body and make a decision based on how God leads them that all keeps things working together but it can also include the helpers it can include the audiovisual people sister Rebecca and sister Selena and brother Levi and brother vichel it can include the the janitorial side with sister Amber and these different ones it can include the ones that are put into Authority even temporarily to manage an event or manage a situation in these sorts of things amen so I'm trying to point out that in all of these somebody's got a place to fit you can fit in one of these three no matter what then the last one is operations and this is the widest one of all because this is somebody that has a burden in their heart to do something and they've got a gift to make it happen can I put it this way a willing heart is not a gift okay how many times have you ever met people in your job that want to do something but they can't do it it's the same in the body of Christ not everybody is called to do everything and not everybody has a gift to do everything even if we want to listen I believe a sincere desire in our hearts should be that we can serve any way we could serve and sometimes that willing heart puts us in a dangerous position because we say I'm willing to do it therefore I will do it no no no he's got to lead you into it and here's the thing we'll know that we're called and gifted if the results match the vision okay if I say that I can manage a $100 million company and I turn it into a $50 million company then guess what my willing heart was not enough I didn't have the gift I didn't have what it took to do that sort of thing and so it's the same in our midst listen if this church starts to fall apart if people start to leave if people are falling asleep in service what does that say about me it means I'm right up there with Paul oh woke you up didn't I no but in all seriousness listen if I'm putting people to sleep up here there's a problem with my calling that's just speaking practically that ought not to be it ought to do something for the people it ought to help them grow and mature in Christ amen so the test of these PE of a person that has a gift in operations is that they are effective I don't know if brother Kim dingwell is listening tonight probably not but if he is brother Kim God bless you but when we were in be in British Columbia we notice that brother Kim was used for a lot of project management and leading things because apparently he can manage and he can lead and he did it once and it worked well and again and again and so they made him the principal and then they took him out and then they put him back in again they didn't have anybody else they said can you please do it because you do a great job that's really how you know you've got a gift is people keep coming back to you if I can put it that way people keep coming back because they see that God uses you in a way that's effective amen but this could be in operations it can be things within the church it can be people that work outside of the church people that help people move people that shovel snow for old folks that mow yards that it could be charitable giving for specific causes it could be dedicating a way to help the community and all these different things somebody like Dorcas would fit within operations okay she had a vision to go out and help poor people with their clothing and so she she produced clothing for them and she had a massive impact on them so great that she was deemed worthy of being raised from the dead okay so we don't put these into levels they are places and positions I don't even think I read my title finding your place and accepting your part I think you skipped on me brother Vel did you I didn't think I pressed it anyways finding your place and accepting your part okay this thing seems to have a mind of its own tonight it's been going back and forth a bit all right so but operations is all about impact you can't say you've got a gift in whatever area this is if there's no impact okay it's not about willing heart it's about actually being able to produce something it's not about how it looks it's about what it achieves so we're not here to look good we're here to do good it has to have a real effect okay so we continue he says now but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so that means it's for the common good it's for common profiting in other words if I have a gift and I'm the the only one that's profiting there's either two issues one it's not a real gift or two I'm not being led of the spirit because it's for everyone not just for me doesn't mean I can't benefit from it but if it's only me that's benefiting we've got a problem amen so you can have a manifestation of the Holy Spirit but it's not a true gift if you're not surrendering it for everybody's benefit he says for to one is given now these are the nine spiritual gifts for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom so this is insight into a situation so you might be going through a c certain situation in life and and you may not really understand what's going on and somebody can come to you with a word of wisdom and say this is what you need to do this is the problem go do it and you're like great it's insight into a particular area then it says to another one the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit so a word of knowledge would be very similar to this so wisdom is is to give you good advice a word of knowledge is that that which is specific to your situation and a word of knowledge is really a form of Prophecy because it's from God for a person so for instance uh the example that that I jumped out to me in scripture is ananas and Safara because a word of knowledge can be judgment it can be encouragement it can be Direction it can be all these different things remember Peter comes with the word of knowledge and he says how much did you sell that land for see he already knows and they they say such and such and he says why did you try to fool the Holy Spirit and he says because of this you're going to die and then he gives that Safar a chance to come in and she does the same thing it's a word of knowledge Peter was not a prophet Peter was not a man that had an open Vision Ministry he saw Visions at times but he wasn't this way but this was a word of knowledge that came showed him what was going on in the situation and gave him a word for the situation it's used it's meant for our benefit and in that case it was a benefit because it purged the church that's a scary thing got to remember that the remember when it comes to the healing of the body sometimes it takes a cutting not see it's not all sabs and hugs and kisses sometimes it's surgery and so the holy spirit's here to keep the body clean brother Brandon made a comment about how if he had somebody with this gift that they would stand in the door of the congregation and would not allow you to enter unless your life was clean because that word of knowledge would call you out that's the seriousness of this it's not for playing around it's very serious it's the Holy Spirit working but it can be very simple where somebody would say listen the Lord has showed me something and he told me to tell you something and they tell it to you and then you go and you do it sometimes it's a word of warning hey you're supposed to leave tomorrow to drive across the the the the the um Province don't do it there's going to be a bad wreck and you're going to be involved involved stay home tomorrow okay praise the Lord don't take that job get out of that relationship all these different things it's a word uh of knowledge to the person then he says to another Faith by The Same Spirit so some people have a particular gift of faith they can believe anything by the word and it's there to help those of us that are of weaker Faith it's not to build them a great ministry it's to help those that aren't in such a strong position then he says to another the gift of healing to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit so this is a gift to pray for people and see amazing results remember the scripture says if any are sick let them come forward and the elders will anoint them with oil lay hands on them and they shall recover they'll be restored to health but the gifts of healing is for Supernatural healing it's miraculous healing and these are this is a very particular one it's a gift that goes beyond just laying on of hands and you'll you're to get better it is an it can be an instantaneous thing then he says to another the working of Miracles this could be anything you look in the scriptures you see remember when uh uh Elisha made the ax head to float that was a working of a miracle it could be somebody lays their hands on a car that won't start and it starts it could be all sorts of of things it could be be speaking to a storm changing a situation all these sorts of things it can it can be whatever God would lay on your heart to do it could be just a change in circumstances whatever that might be he says to another there's a gift of Prophecy remember what Paul said prophecy is the greatest of all of these because prophecy is thus saith the Lord prophecy is not vague it's specific it's direct and it has to be 100% right it's the greatest gift because it is God speaking directly to the church then he says now another discerning of spirits remember we're all all supposed to have discernment by exercising it by testing it and checking it but there are people that can that can meet a person and they can understand the influence that person's under and they can they have insight into that and that is a gift of the spirit amen then it says to anothers diverse kinds of tongues so this is speaking in tongues as a gift and then another the interpretation of tongues it's the interpretation of tongues that makes the gift of tongues of any use gift of tongues by itself is useless to the body we preached that already all it is is gibberish none of us understand it's the SP the person speaking it doesn't understand it it has no benefit to the body except there be an interpretation given and Paul says without interpretation we don't do it in the church by that meaning we don't stop and listen to it you can speak in tongues in worship or prayer whatever time you want but it's not meant it cannot interrupt the word and we don't stop and listen unless there's going to be an interpretation given of that thing amen you're with me but then he comes down down down to verse 11 and he says but all of these worketh that one and the selfs Same Spirit so the person that's operating all of these is not the people that have the gifts it's the spirit that's working it and he says now he's dividing to every man severly as he will so it's the Holy Spirit that's giving them operating them to each person as he wills and this is a dynamic event it is not that brother Matt has a gift of the spirit on his life all all the time he might but it's not guaranteed rather it's the spirit falling and giving a gift to those as it is needed and as they're willing and available to be done now I just want to talk about that for a little bit because with the Holy Spirit operating it and it being a dynamic situation it means every one of us could potentially serve under the anointing of one of these gifts it's not limited to men only men women young old it matters not this is this is the the great equalizing of the Holy Spirit when it was given is that the gifts are given for everybody okay the nine spiritual gifts I'm talking about administrations fivefold Ministry men only sorry sisters right and there are certain leadership positions that can only be men but when it comes to the nine spiritual gifts we've just talked about anybody can have them and it's not that they're always going to have them scripturally we can look at King Saul but before he became King Saul remember he went to the school of the prophets and in the school of the prophets the Holy Spirit fell on Saul and he prophesied accurately so much so that people said is Saul one of the prophets no Saul wasn't one of the prophets he was under an anointing that gave him a gift of Prophecy for that moment Paul went or Saul went away and he never prophesied again as far as I remember and as far as recorded in history you look at Caiaphas the high priest he prophesied accurately and beautifully when Jesus was under trial and as far as we know he never did it again he they're not prophets they're under a gift of Prophecy amen but then you have people so you have people and it may just happen once it may just happen once but you have people that it happens to constantly and sometimes that's because they are very open to it sometimes they have an inclination to it and sometimes that's just the way God does it sometimes that's the sovereignty of God that he will use somebody over and over but you'll have people and you'll see this in life and we can even see it in the scriptures of course is you'll have people that do a great work over a short period of time and then they go back and just live a normal life after that and God drops a gift into their life an anointing an unction a vision a direction whatever that might be a courage to do something and they go do it and then they go and they just live a normal life and they have exactly fulfilled the purpose of God for their life 100% remember brother he says God will train a man for what what was the quote said 30 years for 30 minutes of work he just needs you ready for that moment and then he'll use you and then you have some people that all they do is work and there's a gift there for that we're not talking spiritual gifts we're kind of moving to another side of it but just for a second you look at our our brother Gerald as a pastor for 43 years he never got to lay that burden down that was a gift and it's a calling but he's doing that every day of his life brother Bob's now serving longer in an office and he's at 44 years now of song leading that's not an anointing that comes and goes brother Bob it better not be right CU we would of all people be most miserable it's true it's true we laugh but it's true and if it ever leaves he'll know step down that's it I'm not pushing I'm not pushing I'm so I'm so blessed that we have people that are willing to stay and do this for so long God bless you every single one but if the anointing ever goes we got to lay that we got to lay it down that's it that's it God's done with you that's it and we don't fight it here's the thing if I got up here and never felt that I should be up here why would I do it you'd be of all people most miserable and I join right in there with you because I'd be trying to force something that I'm not meant to be doing amen I'm not sure why I went there amen but we'll keep pushing through but these nine gifts God can use any one of us at any time brother brah says it this way he says there are nine spiritual gifts in the church they operate anywhere in the church for instance if this tent here tonight concealed the entire body of Christ the Holy Spirit leads the body of Christ and in this body there are nine spiritual gifts they're here in the body Gifts of healing Gifts of prophecy he says it might fall upon someone here tonight this lady sitting here this man or this man and he may give a prophecy and it would be true but it would never work on him maybe again see that doesn't make him a prophet all right but then he says we're in the body and by one Spirit we are baptized in the body and we are subject to these gifts in other words we are available for use by the Holy Spirit to express these gifts and when the body sitting here he says remember what Paul said if something be revealed to one sitting by let him hold his peace and so forth like that that's the apostolic church that's where it should be now and here might be one tonight with the prayer of faith that would pray a prayer of faith that would heal somebody not the preacher listen I don't declare myself to have a prayer a gift of faith that way but listen there are times where I do and I have but I also know that there are people in this church that have had that happen to them as well mothers and fathers believe me when you have something to that says go lay your hands on your child what is that that is a gift of faith that is a gift of healing by the Holy Spirit dropping down to address the need remember brother Brown talked about I I hope I get this right because it's off the top of my head I didn't look it up where that woman was sitting in his one of his meetings and she had this this something kept telling her lay your hands on this person near you and so she went to that person she said listen I'm I'm a nobody and I just feel led to do this I want to pray for you is that okay and the person said yes they prayed on she prayed for her and then went back to her seat Well that person had a prayer card if I'm not mistaken or maybe brother Bram called him out I'm not sure but they were looking to be healed and he says I can't do a thing for you you were healed when that sister laid her hands on you and prayed for you so she had a of faith and she had a gift of healing for that moment for that person he says the gift of healing might be on them tonight it might be upon this lady here tomorrow night and upon this man over here the next night it might come back to her it's in the church the body that's the beauty of it is that we don't have to rely on some person to always have this if you are filled with the spirit and you open yourself to be used he'll use you he use you in his way but he'll use you I believe that with all my heart amen so he says now now he makes this transition and we'll make the same transition with them he says now those are the nine spiritual gifts that are in the body now he says they work through the body but then there are gifts there is gifts and callings without repentance he says that's a Vindicated Prophet sent from God so you can have a gift of Prophecy but he says that is not make you a prophet he says you don't receive that that's a gift sent from God that's born in your birth come down through and been set you down through he says a prophet not a gift of Prophecy so notice now these nine spiritual gifts of wisdom and healing and faith and all these different things word of knowledge they are not necessarily A Ministry they can be a Ministry and they can be attached to a Ministry but they are meant for everyone anytime and they we do have these amen and many preachers will have these sorts of gifts attached to their Ministry it is not their true Ministry but it is a gift that's attached to their Ministry because their true Ministry is to preach the word teach the word whatever that might be Pastor in these different things but these things follow along and they are used for the benefit of the body and the greatest danger we have is that we start bringing them in for the gift rather than for the word because it will in effect restore us back to Pentecost which takes us backward we're there for the word first and everything else is second but they are here and they're a manifestation they a portion of God and we have these in the bride of Christ today I've experienced it I've had those gifts applied to me by other ministers in my life I can tell you there are brothers out there that have a gift of knowledge that have a gift of laying on of hands that have a gift of faith that have a gift of healing we've seen it we've seen people that come in and that is their greatest Ministry is that that Faith and Healing where they will preach the word to establish your faith and something that is absolute and then they will come behind it and they will show you what that looks like that's what the gift's really meant to do it's to manifest what the word's talking about it's to put the Life of Christ back through US amen and these gifts are these nine gifts they're all Redemptive gifts and we'll read the scripture that talks about that but they're Unleashed by God they're sent down by God to help us and so we don't need to be scared of it we don't need to put them on the Shelf we can take them and let them be used because they are part of the blessings that come with being a child of God we've seen those gifts many of us have experienced those amen they're all through scriptures but you'll see very little of that in the Old Testament but in the New Testament all of a sudden it seems like they're all over the place you've got the apostles going and they have all these gifts and then the church has it so much so that Paul has to put it in order these different gifts and saying hey remember what the preeminence is here and that's the key thing is that it can be a lot this is the fun side of Christianity the gifts if you use them they're fun if he uses them it takes a lot of the fruit of the spirit to keep them in their proper order and place and it keeps us humble that's for sure so these nine spiritual gifts are not necessarily A Ministry they're an opportunity to be used by God in a particular way amen but they are according to the Sovereign will of God in our life and it's based on our surrender and it's based on our availability okay two things surrender and availability listen if you never open your mouth you're probably not going to speak in tongues ever you have to allow yourself to relax and get yourself out of the way for those things amen but then the other side is we may not have them because we're not suitable we may not be suitable by character we may not be suitable by our life that's lived when brother Mark was preaching there or or teaching a little while ago remember what he says we need to keep our lives clean a clean heart and a clean life that's what makes us suitable for the Holy Spirit to use amen that's what we need to do sincere and Sanctified vessels fit for the Master's use but then brother brandham comes along and he says now you've got to be very careful that you don't have a gift of Prophecy that drops on you and you start to declare yourself a prophet that's a very dangerous place to be he says because a prophet is not a gift given it is something that's ordained to you by birth and that means it's a creation gift not a Redemptive gift it's in you you have it and and whether you realize it or not and whether or not you surrender your life to God it's still there and that calling is there now he referenced the scripture in Romans 11 that said for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance notice gifts plural calling singular the gifts are many and varied and you look around this church and we have lots of different gifts cuz we have lots of different people the fact that you're different makes you a gift that's why you're here is because you're different amen so but it's a singular purpose and what is that singular purpose we have lots of gifts but we've got one purpose and one alone scripture says in first John says behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God our purpose is to be a child of God that's our calling is to be a child of God and our life is to reflect that but the gifts come together to help Express that we are a child of God but we're different parts we're different gifts we're different people but our purpose is to be a part of that bride body and let him Express himself through us now notice it says here that these gifts and the calling of God are without repentance that original word there means irrevocable the gifts and calling of God are irrevocable you can't add them because you want them and you can't take them away because you don't they're there whether you want them or not amen you can't change it your gift with your your calling your purpose is set in stone by God that's pre-ordained you can't say well I wasn't I I don't want to be a musician I want to be a preacher sorry if he's called you to be a musician you're a musician and if you try and be a preacher I'm not saying you can't get up and preach I'm saying he'll never bless it because you're never meant to be there in the first place you got to stay in your lane you'll never have a true impact you may have a big church but you'll never have an impact because he never intended you to do that you have to find your lane you have to find your gift your position and stay in it remember what he said about Jeremiah he says before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations so Jeremiah was a vessel prepared to be a prophet before he ever was even formed in his mother's womb where was it it was before the foundation of the world in the thoughts of God Jeremiah Was A prophetic attribute of God and when he's born what is it now the word is being born in his life of what God has told him God has declared that him supposed to be Jeremiah wasn't a prophet because he got into service and got anointed and prophesied Jeremiah was a Prophet by the ordination of God and God alone and he didn't pick it he couldn't walk away from it he couldn't become it he was in the mind of God as a prophet and so he was a prophet and that's all there was to it can you see it this way that when the word of God comes to you it's quick in that which he's seen beforehand it's producing what he's already seen Jeremiah's purpose was to be a prophet and so when the word came to him it turned him into the word that was meant out of his life he may not have been a prophet I don't know how old Jeremiah was when he became a prophet maybe he had his rebellious teens maybe he backslid I don't know but eventually he came to a place where he stepped into the will and the plan of God and God started to use him as a prophet God took care of his prophet and he was ready to go when God needed him to go it's like we we read so many times about the wooing of the holy spirit in in the early creation it's moving over the Earth to draw life out of seeds and that's what's happening and so these these creation gifts the holy spirit's here to pull the gift and the calling of God out of our life to produce Sons and Daughters of God that can reflect his attributes in their life I was reading something by Lonnie Jenkins a long time ago and I refreshed myself in this week and and I just want to read what he said if that's okay this evening because he said it's so much better than I ever could and so much more succintly and he said in his daily work the holy spirit is to refine his work of creation he said he brings the manifestation in your life everything you were created to be he says I'm showing you the principle that God created and then he sent his Spirit to refine the same God the same Spirit the spirit is refining the elements that God built so the work really starts after we get the holy spirit because that's where the refining starts that's where the real character development starts and that's where the word starts to come forth because when you receive the Holy Spirit it shows that you have died you have surrendered and now there's a different life there's a different preeminence that's coming out of your life and now it's going to refine you into what he had in his mind before the foundation of the world that's what it's doing it's producing the word that he had of you here and now in this flesh okay brother Braham says it this way he says now you have those gifts you didn't deserve them God gave them to you before the foundation of the world they are yours that's a key statement they are yours he says when you were born in this world you were born with them he he quotes Paul speaking to Timothy stir up that gift which is within you you're born with those things you can't make yourself do something I can't make my eyes brown because they're blue who taking thought can add one cubit to his stature it's all in God's Divine program you are whoever you are notice he says they're yours you can do with that gift whatever you want we're talking creation gifts and we're going to spend the last third of this service talking about this for a little bit amen God does not bind you to using that gift for him he gives you the gift and you have free moral agency as to how you use it absolutely you do but if you're a child of God he's going to bring you in no matter what but you may never surrender that gift remember we talked about every man has the same Foundation but what they build on it that's between you and God and if you build on your own gift without surrendering it it's not going to survive that's a free will free moral agency brother BR would talk so many times about one person on this Elvis Presley hey that man was raised in a Pentecostal Church mimicked moves he saw but turned it into perversion and had a horrible influence on this entire continent but he learned it in church and then he perverted it he had a gift to sing he had a gift to play he had a gift to entertain to Wild People however you want to look at it that could have been used by God hey he could sing hey Elvis did some beautiful hymns and songs absolutely he did he could have turned it over you look at Whitney Houston amazing black woman black singer when she sings those hymns she can sing and hit notes in a way that nobody else in this world seems to be able to and what did she do she gave it over to R&B and she came back she she got into drug trouble cleaned herself up did a hym album and then went out and o e again and died she never surrendered it she never surrendered it what a shame amen God's given them to use for his glory but we do have a choice to use them for our own Glory as well you know I study hard I put my notes together in a particular way it's the way my mind goes these different things but there are times up here I start a sentence and I don't know what's coming next it's the strangest thing can I be honest my greatest fear is that someday I'm going to sound like KLA Harris where a word salad comes out but that's part of preaching is you've got to be able to relax and not direct him let him direct you and so you may not know when that's happening cuz it's not the entire service by any stretch of the imagination I don't think I could do it I don't think I could do it but there are times where you don't know where you're going and you don't know the words that are going to come out I believe in studying scriptures tells us to study the reason we have deacons is so that the ministry can study we're supposed to study amen I believe that putting our notes together in a certain way I believe in leadership to preach in these different things I might do a series that lasts a year and I've done it but in that I've got to be able to be moved I've got to be able to be led and I've got to be able to Le be led off as well as he leads me to do that amen and it's the same thing behind the pulpit I believe that the Holy Spirit leads me to study I believe he anoints anoints me to study to put the notes together but I have to be able to let go up here and let him determine how that service is going to go if you looked at what I had here versus what I've said tonight you might be very surprised because it's usually seamless but sometimes I'll fight a little bit CU I want my way cuz that's what it that's how I got it and then he's got to let me know and he'll keep pushing and he'll keep pushing until I say what he wants me to say that's I I'm being perfectly honest with you so you can understand it it it isn't always so easy by any means by any means okay but here's the thing we're talking about a creation gift I Believe by God's grace I've been called to preach not because I'm a great preacher but because he has opened the doors and placed me heaven knows I never thought I would want to I I I don't want to be a preacher much less I never thought I would be preaching or pastoring in these different things but I can take that exact gift and I've talked about this before and I can use this at work I when I'm going to present or teach I cannot overstudy I cannot practice it too much because it will make me worse not better but what I have to do is I have to to use a common phrase I have to go with the flow and it just comes out a certain way and it seems to work and that's a benefit to to me it's a benefit to my career it's a benefit to my pay it's a benefit to my colleagues it's a benefit to my reputation it's working the same way but here's one difference it ain't anointed it's just a gift it's just a gift I can use that for my benefit and maybe I could go way higher in my in my career if I really wanted to but the gift was not meant for me to succeed even though I believe I've been successful but it was meant to put me behind a Pulpit so I can serve amen you see that it's been there all along that portion of my life has been there most of my life as far as I can look back but to use it to preach that was a complete change and transition in my life and in my purpose so we can have a gift in our life even a great gift and have all sorts of personal benefits but its purpose is meant to benefit everyone else not just me not just you but you we'll never see that that what that looks like until we surrender it and the problem is that Satan will offer us every worldly opportunity to magnify ourselves while God's offering us a little humble opportunity to Magnify Him and the thing is if we'd ever realize that the true greatness will come when you humble yourself and let him use you it's far greater far greater than anything you can achieve in this world you might get a lot more Acclaim you might get more followers on Instagram you might make a lot more money you might have a lot more influence but let me tell you the the the satisfaction that comes with knowing that the results are far beyond anything you could ever achieve it's the greatest feeling in the world because it's Christ in you that's doing the work brother says it this way he says now look if you will take those gifts that you have and use them correctly and orderly in the church this little church will grow like everything but when you get in yourself in the flesh you'll keep it tore up as long as the church stands here that's exactly right remember what I said before we're all under the same Lord we all are under a chain of command that is bringing order not chaos not confusion not conflict he's pointing back to what Paul said be led by the spirit that's the only way that this is going to work the gift really as we said it's about being used not about using it remember what Jesus said in John he says then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for whatsoever things he doeth those also doeth the son likewise amen we're led by the spirit we're led by the spirit and I tell you this if we are led by the spirit the results will speak for themselves 100% amen each and every one of us has a gift and a calling some of us are blessed enough to have two or three gifts four or five maybe but regardless we're placed with purpose every single one of us not a person that gets away with this listen to what Paul said a little earlier in 1 Corinthians he says for I would that all men were even as myself now Paul there is talking about the fact that he is um unmarried or widowed as the case may be but now he says this but every man has his proper gift of God every person has a proper gift of God one after this manner and another after that then he would say in epes Ephesians he says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now in Ephesians he's talking about the fivefold ministry where he gave preaching gifts to the five-fold ministry and then those men themselves are gifts to the body so so it's a gift to minister and then those gifts those ministers themselves are gifts to them but when we look at this word gift in 1 Corinthians and then Ephesians the word there is charisma and we look at that more as an English word because we know about charismatic people people that have Charisma and it's people that just seem to draw people to them they get along with everybody they're magnetic they make friends easily they can influence people they just seem to slide into opportunity and and and and it just seems like it's effortless the way that they connect with people now most people with what we call Charisma use it for themselves but the the original intent for Charisma is to reflect a gift something that's given with purpose it's a gift of Grace we would even call it that way each one of us has our own Charisma our own gracious gift and God has meant us to use that for his purpose to help other people so each of us has a way to be effective in the kingdom of God every single one of us without exception remember what Paul said every man has his proper gift of God one this and one that and so we can look at those people and I'm just going to dwell on the natural side of Charisma we can look at those people that have Charisma and say how can I compare to them listen I'm not known for my Charisma I can speak okay to people but I don't have a Magnetic Personality I have a few close friends and they tend to be people older than I but there are people and if I asked you to think about it may you know maybe in this church maybe not but you know people that it just seems like they can they can go anywhere and they make friends with everybody they've got a Charisma a natural Charisma that draws people to them and we can say how do I compare to them you can't so don't you're not meant to your charisma your gift is meant to work in a different way than theirs so it's not about comparisons it's never about comparisons it's about about what you've been given and how you're letting God use it that's what this is all about amen and so we're not all the same and that's why we can't have the same gifts or charism listen some of us don't like a crowd some of us like as I said to just have a few close friends and so people like that they only connect to a couple people and that's okay that's okay amen those types of people tend to have a very deep impact but it's very narrow they don't touch a lot of lives but they go real deep on the ones they touch but then you got somebody else that has a lot of natural Charisma amen and they can reach out to everybody but because we only have so much time and energy their impact is very broad but it tends to be shallow cuz they're just being friendly with everyone they'll still have a couple of close friends but their day-to-day impact is very broad but they don't get too deep with nearly the same number of people amen so Mr Broad and shallow will eventually hand people off to Mr deep and narrow I'm speaking natural Charisma but it's the same thing with gifts you see it's the same thing with gifts because we can hand off people throughout the process of using these gifts we have different things that we're doing and you know think of somebody coming to this church okay somebody that has a a gift of real friendliness and outgoingness they're going to pull them into the church aren't they and they're going to have them over a lot and they're going to follow up with them and they'll be real friendly and they'll make sure that they greet them first thinging at the door and these different things they'll go out of their way to make them feel friendly but after that we've got people that'll help and they'll go help them move into their house and we need those people listen making them friendly doesn't do a whole lot if they can't get some help they need physical practical help and then beyond that you got people that can bake and can and can deliver things and go in and the sisters go in and help them clean up their house and then you've got the brothers that can sit down and answer questions and fellowship and give them a a deeper spiritual connection so we've got a practical connection we've got spiritual connections Community connections food connections work connections whatever that might be and all of it working together helps a person become a part of this body but without the spirit we can't bring them in and they can't be a part that's still got to be there so we need to be led by the spirit and so we need public gifts and we need private gifts not everything is a show it's not meant to be a show it's meant to be about him amen that's the way it's supposed to work so I'm not saying that that that that you can't have both those things but it tends to be more polarized that people that are outgoing tend to be on the more public side and people that are in in inward focused tend to be more on the quieter side of things the unknown side and that's okay but if we lose one of them we're going to suffer we need both we need the whole side we need all of us so don't leave nobody go nobody say I'm useless we're not going to get there this service but we're going to get there next service amen that the things that look the least important when you lose them you realize how truly great they were how necessary they were that's what I mean by greatness watch how Paul says it as we start to close I've got two more pages left I think Romans 12 he says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service we said before body mind and soul Paul says for you to live and keep your body clean and and present your life to him that's reasonable you're not doing anything great by making your life re by by presenting yourself to him that's a reasonable thing for him to ask of you but he says now now be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may Pro prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God it takes a changing of our mindset to do that and that is the work of the Holy Spirit remember what Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child I thought as a child I did all these things as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things I went into maturity and what Paul's talking about here is a transition into maturity by the transforming of the spirit applying the word and it produces in our lives exactly what God wants and in doing that there is nobody that can do it that way except a child of God this is only for the Spirit-filled Spirit born spirit-led we are the only ones church that can show this world what is the good acceptable and perfect will of God listen you listen to some of the things that are going on in churches outside these days it is horrible how they have Twisted the word and made it of no effect but people walking through this Earth will never read a Bible but the one that we present they may never crack open the pages and see Genesis but they'll see Genesis in you and they'll see Revelation in you and they'll see all these things we may never preach a sermon except by the lives that we live and it's by proving what is that good acceptable and perfect mature will of God Amen then he says for I say that the gra through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly catch this now according as God had dealt to every man The Measure of Faith so we're talking about gifts and we've got differences of gifts we also have different levels of the same gift listen we've all got our favorite preachers don't we why some of them have a greater gift than the rest of us and that's okay they're meant to be and do that but they've had to come to a maturity a transformation and a faith that's been given them to operate at that level of ministry okay so we're talking about measures capacities potential and Paul says it varies from person to person that means from Sister Lydia here on the front all the way back to brother Viet to back there are different levels of Faith here not only Faith let me put it this way remember what Paul says we have switched now under the Holy Spirit from Faith to the faith rather than faith in God we are now moving into the faith of God but that Faith Of God is there to operate the gift in your life the calling and the purpose of your life so every one of us has a different level so that is according to what God God gives God sets up it's God's sovereignty that does it so the question is not does brother Matt have more or less Faith than I the question is what's brother Matt doing with his faith and what am I doing with mine because if brother Matt can lift 1,000 pounds with faith and all he's lifting is 300 lb that's a brother Matt problem am I doing everything that I can with the faith that he's given me see sometimes the greatest trap of a gift is that because it's easy we just do as much as everyone else but we do it faster easier simpler and then we say I'm good because I've matched everyone else God remember what scriptures Jesus said to whom much is given much is required you say brother John I'd love to have a great gift listen I've been privileged to be good friends with some of the greatest message Ministers of this world has you don't want a great gift if you understood the pain the suffering the character development the testing the trials that went into that no sir no sir I guarantee you you don't want it there is a testing that goes into that that will break most people but beyond it comes out the perfect maturity of Christ to operate the gifts that he's given them but it is a brutal brutal path because it is a dying out above and beyond what most of us could endure or willing to endure we have to use what we have to its full potential to its full potential he says for as we have many members in the body in one body and all the members have not the same office that word office means function so not all the members have the same function just as the body has many parts they all have different functions same thing with the body of Christ we aren't all here to do the same thing listen I've said this before I can walk on my hands instead of my feet a capability to do it does not mean that's my position CU if I walk on my hands how am I going to pick things up you say I can use my toes not nearly as good as you can use your fingers right let the hands do what the hands do and let the feet do what feet do okay he says so we be many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another we're tied together we're in this together a't nobody's saying I don't like my finger chop it off but if my hand is trying to do what my foot's doing we might get annoyed at that hand find our lane and stay there he says th having then gifts differing according to what the grace I called these gracious gifts earlier this is where it comes from having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith so these are Gifts of Grace they are not Gifts of Merit a brother called them extraordinary Graces and I like that I thought that was beautifully Said So based on the gracious gifts we've received we're supposed to use it in line with the faith that we've received as well the gift is Grace and the faith is Grace you put Grace and combine it with the faith of God that he's given you it'll produce the word every time it'll produce a manifestation of God it'll produce the right result ream says it this way he says because God give you a little gift it doesn't make any different from anyone else we were just all human beings Sinners saved by his grace it's all we can make of ourselves all we can make of ourselves is a sinner saved by grace nothing else then Paul says now so he said remember he says if we're if we're prophesying let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith he says or Ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching so in other words if your gift is service serve if your gift is preaching preach if your gift is teaching teach don't try and be a prophet don't try and be a musician don't try and be a song leader stay in your lane do what you do uh to the best ability because otherwise somebody's going to be coming down that line a whole lot faster than you and there's going to be a wreck cuz you're in his or her way now because that's their Lane if you're trying to be a prophet and you're a pastor get out of the way cuz there's a prophet coming down the road and he's going to run you over you're in his Lane you're in his way you're hold them up I've said it before there's a well-known Pastor said there are a lot of great deacons behind the pulpit and he was not he wasn't complimenting he was saying just because you can doesn't mean you should you better have a call not just an ability and you'll see the results behind those things many churches I've been in them been a part of them where they lose a pastor or whatever and what happens is a deacon Rises up and it causes problems why because they were never meant to preach but they know the word you can't deny it they can even deliver a a a a well structured sermon but they're not anointed they're not gifted to preach and so they're out of their position he says now or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity and he that ruleth with diligence and he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness I'm going to end just here very shortly like I said I've got actually I had two more pages now I've got two more pages one and a half but watch what he says how Paul puts it he says exhorters exhort we have exhorters here we have brother Mark that will get up from time to time and we have brother Paul that'll do that from time to time amen that's a gift and it has its place but it doesn't it doesn't put out the preaching and it doesn't replace the preaching of the word but it's an exhortation from the word and it's meant for our good and we enjoy it and we appreciate it and it brings Clarity and it brings instruction in these different things but it's not there to replace preaching it's there to supplement it and it's a gift and it's a blessing to the body so God bless you brother Mark and brother Paul at home amen now then Paul says now he says at the end he says he that showeth mercy be cheerful about it now this one's a tough one because we'd all like to somebody grinned and giggled we all like to think we're merciful but notice if you've got a gift of Mercy you can show Mercy with cheerfulness that means why do we show Mercy we show Mercy when somebody has done something wrong and they deserve judgment and we go and we show them Mercy he says you'll know you have a gift of Mercy by the attitude you do it with because if you can't show Mercy having had your rights trampled and still be cheerful you're fooling yourself you ain't got a gift of Mercy you might be showing Mercy but it ain't a gift if we can't show Mercy without begrudging the person the very thing we're giving them it ain't a gift of Mercy listen if we've got a gift of Mercy we'll give it if we never receive it we'll show them something that they're never going to give to us that's a gift because the gift remember is not dependent on what happens when it goes out it's dependent on what happened on the inside it's God operating that gift amen you'll be merciful no matter what then he says about the the gift of giving he says it let it be done in Simplicity that word means do it with pureness of heart with clear intentions and unselfishly in other words you don't talk about your giving I have a brother that reached out to me a while ago year and a half ago and he said brother if you know of anyone that has a serious Financial need through no fault of their own he says let me know and I will help them and he did not put a dollar figure limit on that and there's only a few pastors know that he does this he doesn't tell other people he doesn't put out a notice to the church what's he doing he's guarding his gift by keeping himself out of it he doesn't want his name associated he gives anonymously he doesn't even people don't even know where it came from what's he doing he's letting God get the glory while he's being used amen his gift is to give not to talk about himself and it's a wonderful thing and we'll see that as we go that every good gift that's being used of God is Not self- serving it's not self-promoting it's not bragging these different things it might develop a reputation for you I believe a good gift think scripture says a gift goes before a man and it's speaking of literally you send a gift before you to prepare the way to open the doors but gift a Godly gift in your life will open doors it'll open relationships it'll open you up to be able to influence people in these different things but it takes character to do that and so often that's what holds back the true revealing of the gift is we don't have the character yet I've always wondered why didn't I why didn't even I feel a call to generally preach really preach until I was 35 and the only thing I come up with is he had some work to do and that's okay what matters is he gets me there not in my timing but in his timing and God spent 35 years hiding that call in my life to preach until I was ready to go three quotes as we close brother BR puts it this way we see motive and objective is a big thing here let your objective be right let your motive be right so let what you want to happen be the right thing and why you want it to happen he says for anything outside of the right motive and right objective God can't use it that's pretty flat that's pretty flat if you're not wanting the right thing for the right reason God God's not going to be in it he says sometimes I've read this before but it's a good check sometimes God can bless a man and give him a little ministry that's maybe a little better than his Brethren and then he clarifies he says or not better just something a little different from his Brethren and the first thing you know that man becomes exalted with his chest out and he would brush you off the street he said and that's the time that I believe that man has started out the door cuz God can't use a person like that sometimes God give you a little bit just to see what you do with it and if you can use it in humility for the benefit of others what does he do he comes and he gives you more remember the the the parable of the talents listen he gave a different amount of talents to every single one and we can use that metaphorically or we can use it literally we are given talents and some people are very gifted but it's like I said before are we using them for him or are we just letting them sit and you had the one that that had the the the the five or the 10 and he went and he doubled it a wonderful thing but the one that had five he went and he doubled it to but then the one that had one he just went and buried it in the napkin in the in the in the ground and said yeah I I know that you're a person that goes and and you benefit where you didn't sew and I don't like the way you do things and so I just decided not to do anything with what you gave me and then what did Jesus say that man will do he'll s take from him that has the little and give it to him that has a lot because the one that has a lot is going to use it for me he says from him that had little will be taken away to give to that which has much why cuz the ones that have much are because they prove them themselves when the first little things to build to the bigger things it takes character takes hum humility to be able to move with god brother B would say humility is power with God that's the greatest thing you'll see with gifts is that you are used and you don't force and that allows him to produce a wonderful result last quote he says and every little gift that you have don't use it to try and make it some great something for ourselves he says let's make it for the kingdom of God to work with everyone gifts aren't selective listen I might like to work really a lot with brother Mark but if brother Matt's the one that has the need of my gift I work with brother Matt or Brother David or brother Garfield or brother Joe it doesn't matter the gift has nothing to do with the person on the receiving end if the need is there we use it okay we can work with everyone to try to uplift the cause of Jesus Christ for his coming as soon amen God bless you let's stand together again some down home cooking rubber meets the road I am I believe we are so blessed in this church with the gifts and the helps and the supports and the different things everything from worship to Administration to offices and these different things but are we LED that's always the question we need to ask ourselves are we LED and if we are LED it takes me out of the equation it takes you out of the equation and it puts him up and it puts those that you're serving in a place that's higher than our own will our own desire our own preferences our own emotions our own relationships these different things amen and it calls us to lay our lives down so that the Holy Spirit could use us for something that takes real character that takes real patience that takes a real dying out that takes a life of prayer that takes a life of just saying Lord use me use me and in sincerity when he moves to use you let him use you amen we're going to talk a little bit more about that on Sunday Lord willing amen let's just bow our heads if we would Lord Jesus Lord our greatest desire I believe is to be used Lord that our lives would not be wasted day by day Lord than all the having to make a living and provide and take breaks and have a rest in these different things Lord that in it all our greatest desire would be to serve you Lord to be used by you Lord but before that comes we've got to be led by you Lord I pray you help us to learn to be led to learn to yield Lord to to Humble ourselves to lay ourselves before you and let you be the Lord Of Our Lives Lord when you're given us the Holy Spirit Lord It's power to serve Lord I pray you help us to be servants not just in our words Lord not just with a willing Heart Lord but with a LED heart that's following your word and your will Lord I pray your grace to us each one Lord we have many needs this evening certainly in body Lord we ask
