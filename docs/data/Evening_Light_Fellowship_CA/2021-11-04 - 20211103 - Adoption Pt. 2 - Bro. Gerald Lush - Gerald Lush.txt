anointing amen because we're going to need the double portion tonight for sure amen so be in prayer let's say only believe all things are possible only believe as we go to the word and to mention these things that you can keep in prayer amen uh having communicated with our brother george smith within the last few days that uh he has expressed a desire he's so open and be able to get back to newfoundland and but of course we're waiting for the changes of what's going on in the united states well basically around the world concerning the kobet 19 issues and concerning traveling but right now our brother is traveling around in the united states i don't think he's able to get out of the united states or to go to any other country and he's hoping to be able maybe to get to newfoundland amen soon so we pray god will open the way amen and bless us with our brother george's ministry it was just as i mentioned might have mentioned about a month ago that he did minister for our brother paul lafontaine in the united states so we pray the grace of god to continue to bless brother brother george as he travels through the states amen and maybe the lord will open the way for him to get to get back to canada and to get back to newfoundland amen so god bless brother george and also to keep sister betty in prayer with her sickness and the condition she's experiencing in her body the grace of god be with her amen to give her the victory over the world the flesh and the devil amen to god be the glory and uh appreciate our brother ali's prayer gladys he's back here tonight amen so the lord be with us all and again lord willing hopefully we'll have communion uh it's been a long time again since we've had the communion and we've had that very often for the last number of months maybe a couple years since this covet issue has been been here but we want to give god the glory amen give god the preeminence amen and believe by grace that he's able to protect us amen during these these situations so brother let's not be under the influence of the world to stay under the the influence of god the influence oh my concerning concerning what what's going what was going on in egypt my but i tell you this the the jews they had the token life of the blood of slain lambs on the doorpost amen i said take no slay the lambs take the blood put it on the doorpost put it here put it there wherever the jews were living at that time in egypt amen and when the death angel came he went he went over egypt but he didn't go near any place where the where where they had the blood amen over the doors over the maybe over the the the the going in amen but the angels recognize it oh yeah when they went through with that judgment in egypt or they they they knew what that blood represented amen so i trust by grace brother sister and again they had a joshua we got a joshua and our joshua is the holy ghost amen and brother i tell you just that joshua took israel into the natural promised land the holy ghost is there to take us into the spiritual promised land amen and to give us the victory amen brother if in every hour we need to have that faith that victory over the world over the flesh and the devil brother this is the hour brother and god is allowing it brother to test our faith amen god's allowed to bring out our faith what are we going to think like what are we going to say what's going to be our attitude amen are we just going to go on and trust the lord and say well lord i'm trusting you we're the seed of god we're not the seed of man amen so by the grace of god i trust we have that faith i tell you brother that's what we need in this hour is faith in god oh yes definitely the world is nervous the world's afraid oh yeah this is going on that's going on they're doing this they're doing that but the bride is moving on as usual by grace amen amen we're not of this world we didn't come from this world amen we're going back to where we come from praise the lord and brother that's i want to discuss those things tonight again as we go in for another thought on adoption and the power of god highlights the fact adoption has taken us back is it where we come from amen i trust we got i trust we got that spirit of adoption i trust we got that anointing in our hearts in our souls and it's a confirmation oh i'm on my way home oh yeah i'm going back where i come from you don't belong here no i don't i'm a stranger here yeah and those out there are strangers to us amen oh i trust the world seems strange to you if you've got the holy ghost it does because i tell you god god's not familiar with this god doesn't want this no these thoughts these these spirits these attitudes not made by any means amen we're going back to where it doesn't exist amen amen he's here to give us that faith amen to be a witness to the world family friends and neighbors amen so brother oh yeah when it happens and we're missing where are they they'll know oh oh that's what they talked about they talked about the resurrection they talked about the rapture they talked about this they talked about that oh and getting out of this dimension into another one or that that's that must have happened but they didn't really believe it when but they believed too late amen but i trust we're not believing too late we're believing up to date amen what god not what god will do what god is doing oh i pray grace we got that faith to recognize what god is doing amen because i tell you we're a part of what he's doing amen we're reflecting what he's doing amen so i trust that we live every day conscious of what god's doing in your life and in your family and so on but we wonder about this we want to know that lord this is your lord this is your business this is what you're doing and lord i'm going to move on by faith amen it's not me that lives it's christ living in me oh it's not you doing this doing that doing that north jesus amen so amen because he's made flesh in the bride amen just think i i there's a challenge are we living like like the way that jesus lived when he was here do we have that attitude do we have that spirit knowing who we are do we really know who we are like jesus know who he was amen and know where you come from know why you're here know where you're going and how you're going to get there by grace oh i trust by grace brother we got that real genuine faith by the grace of god brother and again we'll bring out some more thoughts concerning adoption but i'll tell you this god's working by faith amen applying your adoption in your life amen bringing it to past the reality of it amen improving where you come from proving where you come from and you're proving it by the faith and the life you lead amen to god be the glory amen let's sing only believe all things are possible only believe [Music] only believe only be [Music] [Music] oh [Music] all things are possible [Music] only we need jesus is here jesus is

the going forth of your word father hallelujah that again the faith you're looking for will come true the word amen father the word is going to give us the faith we need the for the word is going to

brought in and delivered us from sin father 2 000 years ago you're there to deliver us tonight yes amen you're there to deliver us from the world you're there to deliver us from the influence of the world amen the influence of our flesh thank god lord you're there to deliver us yes from the influence of the devil lord that we're going to think the thoughts of jesus that we're going to think the thoughts of the holy ghost and sense the presence of god through the anointing of the power and the life of the blood amen so lord we have that power over the world that power over the flesh that power over the devil that power over satan's influence in these last days grace to let go and let you have your way grace to let go and let you do what you want to do now and what you want to do in this hour amen father approaching the resurrection approaching the rapture hallelujah praise the name of the lord what an hour of the living lord what a tremendous time we are living lord i pray grace

things are possible now i believe now i believe now i believe all things are possible because now i believe grace amen and amen praise the lord god bless you turn with me to a scripture i think maybe we read in the last message we read it again in the book of galatians chapter four the prophet of god has made reference to this scripture in his emphasis on adoption amen galatians chapter 4 and let's begin to read at the first verse amen galatians 4. now i say that the hair as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant amen i trust we've matured that we're not children we're not babies amen but we're sons and daughters amen and it says but the child different nothing from a servant though he be lord of all amen he has to be trained amen and brother silva is with us as the seed of god that for the resurrection for the rapture god has brought us to that through that phase of training amen to so that we're going to mature as sons and daughters of god amen not just babies no no not just again as we refer to children but sons and daughters matured but he said is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children we were in bondage under the elements of the world but we're getting to that place where the world has no influence on us we're getting to that place where our hunger and thirst is for the new heaven and the new earth amen for glory amen to be back with our heavenly father god help us to give us the revelation that's creating us that hunger and that thirst to be back with him amen to believe that's where we come from and that's where we're going amen verse 4 but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons amen by the grace of god god bless his word you may be seated turn with me to the book of romans chapter 8. romans chapter 8. in his messages concerning adoption the prophet did refer to the scriptures we read in galatians amen and to other scriptures as well but we want to emphasize galatians of what god has done why god did it amen to bring us to the reality and the revelation of adoption amen it's not that we're hoping this and hoping that but it's it's a finished work not only that brother it's speaking of the adoption of sons and daughters amen the prophet is highlighting that they are the sons of god they are the daughters of god and and he's adopting them amen because why because god will either cut them off or god is going to bring them back amen god is going to either move the messiah or he's going to bring them in and and give him the giving them the authority of sons and daughters amen oh yeah and there are those that are that are that are not that are not anointed with that anointing yet they're out there oh yeah this is where they come from that's where they're going but they're not as if we're adopted you've got the the ministry or the or the anointing of adoption where god is bringing them back amen to sit with him in his throne amen so i pray the grace of god brother that we're not just going to be outside the city i trust by grace we're going to be in the city amen and we're laying our lives down amen by the grace of god to give more and more control to jesus amen because i believe that the ones that jesus is going is controlling is going to be in the city they're going to sit with him in his throne amen because they've been toted they've been they've been trained amen oh yeah or we train them the lord they're trained and then all they they act like sons they talk like sons amen or they feel they have the authority of a son amen brother if you go if you're adopted praise the lord the prophet of god said adoption is bringing the son and daughter into a place of authority amen amen as we as we read there in the scriptures amen oh yes uh oh oh master oh this is a good song and this is a good daughter we train them and train them and oh yeah they do well amen they recognize their authority they recognize their position they know who they are amen you'd have no words about them amen brother lord or they would say master they respect you they know who you are amen and now you know who they are amen praise the lord oh yeah because the bible says it is giving us the revelation of sons and daughters being trained amen and the sons that are being trained amen so now they can come in and then or they can exercise the authority that their father exercises praise the lord amen they have access to what the father has access to oh yeah why because oh yeah you're trained you're good they said you're good and you were mature and you're this you're that so come on in son and you can have this i want you to do this i want you to do that amen amen brother that's what god has done all the way down through the ages amen he brought his sons and daughters in he gave them the revelation of his word amen and he held them responsible amen for the word and they were then there were these sons and daughters that they went out and then they lived the word they went out amen and they obeyed the word amen the oh yeah they enforced the word of god amen no matter what they did where they did it how they did it amen they were giving the preeminence to god amen and god honored that faith amen that's the faith god is looking for in his sons and daughters praise the lord brother hey brother i pray grace that we have the faith that he's looking for in the bride amen not just church members not just religious people but she's spiritual the bride is spiritual are you spiritual in what you do are you spiritual in what you say how you talk amen in your actions and reactions are you spiritual are you just just carnal and you're fleshly oh yeah well i i'm a human so i do this and i do it that way but brother if you're if you're a seed of god you're going to do it god's way amen and you're going to have god's attitude you're going to have god's spirit you're going to have god's motives god's objectives and you're going to have god's actions and reactions amen it proves your sonship amen amen hallelujah why because you're god and the prophet of god said again he says son he said the gods give birth to gods amen so are you are you god are you a god do you feel oh my my i i would i would imagine that there's many uh a so-called royal person whether they're the sons and daughters of a queen a sons and daughters of a king oh my and and they exercise the this whenever wherever they go whatever they're doing wherever they're doing it amen or they're going to look for that respect as sons and daughters of a king or a queen amen so brother god's looking for in us the nature of the sons and daughters of the king amen the king of kings and the lord of lords oh glory so you go forth oh i'm not sure there's too many women out there or well i'm i'm a christian what you're a christian oh yeah i'm christ light or to what extent are you christ-like huh oh well i i live the christian life and i do this and i think this and i act this and said what if i tell you this if you're christ-liked you don't act nothing amen it's not an act oh yeah that's uh that's what we learned through through hollywood and and and and they're doing this and they're doing that and they're just acting amen oh they're going to do this they're acting like this one if they're or they're a policeman they're going to act like one amen or they're this and they're going to act like it oh no brother sister that's not with god that's not with our relationship with god amen it's not we're going to act like god we're going to be god amen oh yeah when it comes to acting like him in a sense yes to be like him but i tell you this it's just your nature it's not something you are enforcing no no is your nature is coming forth by the power the anointing of the holy ghost he's oh what is it it's a com the brother brown referred to the holy ghost as being a confirmation of our adoption amen hallelujah that we are sons and daughters praise the name of the lord hallelujah and that anointing is there amen oh what what what is it well it's well physically naturally the anointing is there of your natural birth the anointing is there uh of your your mother your father your grandmother your grandfather or some other relative that's why you act like them amen naturally but you get the holy ghost he controls all that nature oh yeah he he brings this he brings that nature down and the holy ghost nature takes control oh yes whereas one time you went out and did this you did that you acted like this one act like that one well praise god he anointed you to act different oh well how come you're not like this i come you were but you're you've gone beyond that yes i am yes you have why because we got the anointing of our heavenly father amen praise the lord and that's why believers act like they act talk like they talk do what they do when they do it where they do it how they do it amen because it's their nature truly absolutely completely born again and i trust brother and sister all in the hearing of my voice here online or maybe a in a dvd whatever that you got the confirmation you feel within yourself that you are the sons and daughters of god amen that you're burned of god and you had the nature of god amen and you and it has got control of you amen and you oh yeah you believe the word for sure amen because god is the word in the beginning was the word the word were with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and the prophet said the word is made flesh amen in the brain amen because hallelujah because you're a word bright oh my lord i pray grace lord help us to go forth help us to go forward father as the word amen not as just a christian believing these doctrines and this and this and this oh yeah this theology and the letter of the word no we're going forth at the living word made flesh amen the power of the anointing of almighty god amen oh yeah the nature of god but that's the nature of his sons and daughters amen if you're a son of god you're the seed of god amen you've got the nature of god oh yeah but it's still there's still too many when it comes to the natural is to they're too still many are too still to subject and too own too much under the control of their natural parents and less and less under the control of their spiritual but if you're born again but i tell you i'm truly born again the holy ghost the spirit of your heavenly father controls you more than the natural amen in fact that anointing of your heavenly father is there to control the natural it is why because oh it's a natural that's why i would act like this i would do this i would say that i would respond this way that way but the holy ghost comes in to to bring it under control amen so that oh the temptation is there to do this because oh that one nature lord yes he said that's why i'm there to control you that's why i'm there to correct you amen by the grace of almighty god oh god help us to recognize who we are amen and god help us to recognize your brother what god is requiring of us amen okay i believe i'm the i i'm i'm the son of god you believe you're the daughter of god okay you do okay praise the lord that you'll have no problem with the word no not by any means and oh yeah and and and your family friends and neighbors might think you're strange well i was born of a stranger amen because he's a stranger to the world amen jesus was a stranger to the world amen so oh yeah you don't act like this you don't act like your mom and dad you don't you know no i act like my heavenly mother and father amen my spiritual mother and father amen and that oh yeah it's not it hasn't taken away the the old nature no no that's still there but he's here to control it amen he's there to control that nature amen by the grace of almighty god brother it is a testimony it is the evidence that we've been born again okay because you're living a different life and it's not religious it's spiritual amen brother amen and it's not causing you just oh well i go to church and i do this sunday sunday and wednesday wednesday and so on but the rest of the day you're living just an ordinary you know worldly life no you're living like oh and there's a lot don't want to live that kind of life you know i tell you if you're a seed of god you want to live that life amen because it's pulling you into glory amen but as others they just they just too caught up with the natural world to cut up with the physical world amen but if you're really born again i tell you you hate it you hate this world oh yes you hate it amen but not not hating everybody you meet and see but when it comes to the spirit that you're seeing around the world you oh i hate it lord how much longer shall we be here we want to go lord oh you want to oh yeah you'll go the prophet said you go when you want to go amen amen jesus wanted to go amen and if it's christ in you you want to go oh exactly brother that's right amen if you've got jesus in you christ in you the way he acted back here 2000 years ago that's he's got that spirit and that attitude today oh yeah he's giving preeminence to the father the heavenly father amen oh amen just like i said we got to come to that place in the garden of gethsemane not my will thine be done amen brother i tell you that's that's the conclusion of your testimony at conclusion of your life that you're living for jesus amen goal is not what you want it's what he wants amen as i said jesus came to that place until finally he said not my will thine be done lord if it's possible let this cup pass from me but not my will amen in all circumstances all situations oh i pray grace that will be spiritual not religious amen and spiritual is acknowledging our sonship amen and acknowledging the influence of god lord what is your will oh yeah god's grace to us amen and if we are truly sincerely adopted into the kingdom of god amen adopted and placed as sons and daughters of god oh yeah the again this adoption right there that we that the bible speaks of it's not it's not just unrelated individuals no no they were born as sons and daughters but they're trained amen and after they're trained and they're tested amen and they and they passed the test amen oh now they're acknowledged as sons and daughters oh yeah the father and the mother just takes them and says now this is our son this is our daughter amen they're pleased amen and they know oh yeah because as the bible says right there oh yes master their their name on the ticket is good yours yes well as good as yours because oh yeah and they had to be trained to do that because ordinarily or they do anything they do anything oh and you get to a place where you trust them no no you wouldn't be able to trust your sons and daughters with your with your checks and with the money in the bank oh no but if you're trained right oh yeah you trust him amen and brother that's the same it is with the family of god we're trained up in the way that we should go amen god knows god knows okay i can trust that son i can trust that daughter oh yes amen they're wonderful they're really there for me they're really there for my word they're taking their takes to stand for the truth oh yes indeed amen brother can you really truly say i'm the son of god amen do you act like one talk like one when you go up there and you're meeting with family and friends and neighbors oh yeah they know you're different they know yeah and you're not just really they know you're not religious oh they do i've had that experience over the years amen where you meet family and friends and neighbors and they know oh you're not just religious no you're you're a little different oh yeah they uh again as i said one time when i was working there and the elderly gentleman came and just tapped me on the shoulder oh excuse me sir i just want to let you know that i know that you're a christian i said what i said you know how'd you know who told you oh he said no one says just just your attitude and and the way you act and the way you react and so on he said i noticed that oh he felt only he heard me maybe conversation you see me do this do that oh he said i i knew it oh he's a christian amazing i was amazed oh i said well i said well give the glory to jesus well he said just want to let you know amen oh yeah and i and wherever i went whatever i did they just knew it and that's why they all they would they wouldn't swear in my presence they wouldn't do this in my presence they wouldn't do that and i noticed that there was a couple of times that i have met individuals and and they were talking and then all of a sudden they just because they're so used to it they would swear oh i'm sorry i said what always i'm sorry he said he said i didn't mean to do that he said you're a christian and not that i told them no but they knew amen i pray grace that we have such an anointing in our hearts such a ninety amen that brother they recognize who we are amen oh we're we're not we're not in the natural we're in the spiritual amen and not fanatical no no it's just that we are simple sons and daughters of god holy ghost filled sons and daughters of god amen and i tell you if there's anything we do have you got to go to first corinthians 13 and you see that there amen because you can have this and this and this and this but it really comes down to the life you live it's not it's not what you're saying it's the life you're living it is your attitude amen it is your spirit and you take your stand for the truth and again as uh i don't know i might have mentioned it some time ago but it was many many many years ago and when i was working in a certain place and i was just doing this and doing that and somebody came into the room and he was i guess in contact with somebody else there and he and he swore and he was he was said this and said that well i just laid down what i was doing there and i went over i said excuse me i said please i said keep your voice down and i said don't use those words i said you shouldn't do that because i knew it wasn't just normal for for what he was doing the way he was doing he just had lost his temper that's all and he was getting upset and made with somebody else there i said don't do that i said keep keep yourself calm amen you you take your stand for jesus boy is this time when he wants you to take your stand for him time when he wants you to take your stead for his word amen now this time when you just let it go on some of it but not all but not always you just wait on the lord be led by the spirit does he want you to take your stand for that sometimes he do and other times you don't let's be led by the spirit sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god amen so brother i pray grace that we truly have a holy ghost adoption amen not a religious adoption of changing doctrines changing theories when it comes to the word of god no no we have a holy ghost adoption why because brother it's not me it's him amen i've been born again and it's through the power of the anointing of the holy ghost that i'm that you were born again the prophet said and i am born again amen praise the lord and it is the power anointing of the holy ghost bringing us to adoption a position even though your sons and daughters he said you can be a son and a daughter but again they they had to be trained and then he said garlic thompson amen back to give them authority amen oh praise the lord i trust brother that god is recognizing us receiving us amen and that oh yes and that we are coming back to that full adoption full recognition as sons and daughters of god by the grace of god amen again romans chapter 8. praise the lord oh my it is tremendous for as many verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so you're led by the spirit not just going to church but what you're going to do after church what you're going to do at home what you're going to do at work at school amen your education are you really truly led by the spirit amen again i said that i i wasn't really conscious of it as others were but they knew it and i i didn't i didn't go around boasting about anything you know but when i was even when i was young just a young young young boy or a young teenager or even 10 or 12 years old i remember now a scene and uh going we're walking down down the road there which is all dirt roads no nothing paved then and i remember we came by a house there there was nobody i don't think there was anybody living there that might have been at the time but right in front of the house was a huge rock right in front of the house and between the house and the road that we were walking on there's this huge rock and i remember walking down that way with a number of young people friends and so on and there was a situation evolved and this was going on that was going on and oh yeah and they were jumping up on the rock and jumping down doing this doing that and i don't know what happened oh they said oh gerald you're going to swear i said no i'm not going to swear don't know they said we know you want but they said we we got to swear i said that's up to you i said it's not me amen that's that's your choice oh yeah but they knew even then oh yeah they said we know that you won't swear we know that you won't do this you won't do that amen so we respect that we're just going on i said okay go on yeah and they they went one way i turned around went back the other way amen why because of what they planned and what what they were doing how they were doing it and their conversation i said they got nothing to do with me so i went on back to my my home at the time my parents i was amen why because sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god i trust that we're getting more and more conscious of it amen led by the spirit praise the name of the lord hallelujah for verse 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption amen whereby we cry abba father amen it takes away the spirit of fear why our relationship is not based on fear our relationship with god is based on love amen amen there are those that have a relationship with god and based on fear they're those that have relationship with other believers and that's based on fear they're afraid of what the believer might say and might one might say this might say that and so on no move on by the grace of god it's like i said there were down through the years i was told later that there was a number of believers that wouldn't have nothing to do with me because they felt that i knew what they were thinking amen that i could discern their thoughts and so on but again i said well i said would you leave that with the lord i said amen that's between them and god amen so god help us to have that anointing in our hearts they know you're a christian amen amen because you've got the christian attitude you've got the christian spirit you've got christian motives christian objectives oh my you just like jesus amen so again in verse 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption praise the lord whereby we cry abba father and he said the spirit and it's the spirit of adoption and it's the holy ghost amen amen amen yeah well it's your human spirit cause you to be identified with your natural mother and father your natural family where the holy ghost brings us into fellowship with our spiritual family amen hallelujah praise the lord so the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god amen and we're subject to the leadership of the holy spirit amen the nature of god hallelujah oh yeah we think oh well brother this world is not very religious and some of them out there they got no respect for religious people that don't make a difference it's not me it's jesus if they turn you down it's not turning you down to turn jesus down amen as they crucified him they'll crucify you or that that hour's coming it's getting worse amen so the spirit bear witness that we are the children of god amen brother and if you're the child of child of god you've got the nature of god you've got the attributes of god oh yeah amen you think like god you act like god you talk like god amen that doesn't mean you're going to be what you call oh really really religious no you're going to be spiritual amen you're going to be spiritual there's god hidden and god revealed in the simplicity of our lives amen and he said if children then hairs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together amen with him amen by the grace of god brother hallelujah the spirit of adoption brings us into unity and into oneness with our lord jesus christ amen verse 18 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature rated for the manifestation of the sons of god amen glory is god bringing forth his nature in you amen the nature of his son the nature of his daughter in you amen oh my brother we're not living for man we're living for you for god hallelujah for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god hallelujah he's there to bring forth the life of god in you for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god oh my oh my oh my not the children of a church it's the children of god amen for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also praise the lord which add the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption amen waiting for the con confirmation of the adoption amen in glory in the resurrection in the rapture a confirmation because you're an adopted son and daughter of god amen and it says we've grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption and to know the redemption of our body hallelujah brother if you're really adopted sons and daughters of god you're hunging and thirsting for a glorified body you're hungry and thirsting to get out of here and into eternity by the grace of god we're believing and we're waiting for this adoption in a glorified body and we're really getting closer home by the grace of god i want to share with you some thoughts of the prophet please in the name of jesus take your spiritual adoption serious amen amen put yourself in the word to make your calling and election sure put yourself in the word to make your adoption sure by the grace of god and he quoted he said ye haven't received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption amen and he said after you're adopted amen you're placed then you understand he said you've been put into the body correctly adoption is placing you in the body amen correctly the right position by the grace of god he said you're a son sure a daughter and when you're born again he said that's that's your birth but now he said you're positionally placed adopted amen amen oh glory and he said we have not received the spirit of fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father which means my god hallelujah and the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god amen and brother brahma highlights it oh why why do you have you you when it comes to adoption he does i like the difference in what man thinks adoption is and what the bible teaches adoption is oh man thinks adoption is oh that that's sons children out there boys and girls but they don't have no parents right now so i'm going we're going to adopt this one i'm going to adopt that one oh they think oh okay but he doesn't look like you he's not going to have the nature of you because he is his parents are is another mother and father oh yeah we think oh yeah they're adopting those those children out there no when it comes to god he's adopting his own he's adopting his own sons and daughters amen we were cut off we were cut off by sin but now god brings us back to adopt us again amen so he said again he said we have received the spirit of adoption and whereby we cry abba father amen the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god amen he said the bible speaks of the dispensation of the fullness of time amen he said there's a dispensation of the mosaic law there's a dispensation of john the baptist there's a dispensation of christ and there was a dispensation of a church organization and he said there's a dispensation of the outpouring of the holy ghost now is the dispensation of adoption amen amen hallelujah god is calling this calling this calling that but now he wants you to he wants to you to identify with who you are amen his son amen and that hallelujah that what is god what is god doing through our lord jesus christ he's bringing us back to sonship by adoption spiritual adoption amen well because we were caught off god's bringing us back amen sin cut us off but jesus came to pay the price to hallelujah to bring us back amen with the revelation oh yeah oh father father father amen he said it there was the dispensation of the outpouring of the holy spirit now the dispensation of adoption amen and he said what the world's waiting for groaning amen the fullness of the dispensation of time is the dispensation of adoption god recognizing acknowledging our sonship that's right amen by the grace of almighty god amen he said we're predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will and he said remember again inheritance by predestination i inherited something right again that that son is trained just and and the the one that trains him brings him into the father so all well well he's put back in line now because if if he wasn't a trained right if he if and if the trainer felt that he oh he just doesn't have that he don't know what to do there he don't know how to do this he he don't have the maturity oh then his father can't receive him or put him in as a tourist to inherit what he's going to leave behind oh yeah and on that his father cannot receive him and put him into a position of authority and say all right my son you've been trained amen i'm going to adopt you now and and what he would be he would be in in his father's house he would be exactly what his father wanted and he would be able to give him authority and and to do this to do that to do that oh yeah he would have access oh yeah to all that his father would have access to because he he was proved proved to be trained proved to be capable amen so he was brought into adoption into the family amen he said i inherited something he said what inheritance there had to be somebody leave me an irritant why you say jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon jesus never left me in an inheritance jesus left you an inheritance and he only came down and paid for your inheritance amen brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world god give you your inheritance amen brother through adoption god by his foreknowledge seen exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved and he sent jesus to save those he had already chosen amen and amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah i read some of this i believe during the service the previous service okay oh listen to what he said here no he said look he said as he has predestinated us unto is this inheritance and if i may write an irritance of something if god is knocking at my heart and saying william branham i called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel i have an inheritance of eternal life now god sent jesus to make that inheritance real to me and god sent the holy ghost to make the inerrors of eternal life real to us and what god is doing today amen his blood was shed that i might go to my inheritance and he said to what inheritance the sonship of god amen amen oh hallelujah jesus died he laid down his life for us picked it up again so that we could come back to our inheritance we were cut off because of sin but he paid the price bring us back amen praise the lord hallelujah and he said this may choke you to death but did you know that man that are sons of god are amateur gods amen and he talked about i believe was jesus coming and others coming and he said he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain satan took it over but glory we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god who will come back and take it over again amen why praise the lord jesus paid the price for our adoption he's amen to bring us back listen just to share this with you and he said you think cancer is something he said he said cancer is a toothache to what's coming be on your guard what's going on in the world getting worse and worse and worse we need to truly live in the spirit and walk in the spirit amen we need to truly be led by the spirit of jesus the nature of jesus in you jesus in control of my amen so brother oh my i pray grace that that jesus is just not out there oh yeah thank you jesus thank you no jesus is in here i trust we got that that that experience that is not me that lives is christ that liveth in me you've been born again you've been truly adopted by the power of the holy ghost listen he said cancer is a toothache to what's coming and remember that horrible thing that was forbidden in that day to touch those who had the seal of god and he said that's what we're striving for now to get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of god before these horrible plagues strike that's right just make our adoption sure make our this is our calling and election sure make our adoption and election sure amen because i tell you things are going to get worse yes and we said how good the dispensation of time the fullness of time the inheritance but brother we've obtained an inheritance being predestinated through our lord jesus christ he said that was our inheritance given to us through what predestination amen predestination is for knowledge and how did god know he could trust you to be a preacher it's foreknowledge not he that willeth he that runneth it's god that shows mercy amen brother but that's a response to what he's seeing in you response to your attitude your spirit your motives your objectives said that's right he's a predestination he knew what was in you and he knowed what was in you before you even came on the earth he said when i stood there for those few joyful moments and thought there's no tomorrow there's no yesterday there's no sickness there's no sorrow there's no little bit of happiness then a whole lot of happiness it's all happiness and that voice said that this is perfect love and everything that you ever loved and everything that ever loved you is here with you now and you'll present us to the lord jesus when he comes as the trophies of your ministry praise the name praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah just bear with me praise the lord and this is by the way this is a series on adoption amen and he preached four or five messages on adoption amen again he reads the scripture jesus read speaking of salvation and he said what was the salvation he was trying to tell them predestinated before the foundation of the earth that's the salvation he was indicating to the adoption of sons predestinated to eternal life now he said as you come into eternal life after you have been saved sanctified filled with the holy spirit you are a son now he said god's wanting to place you possessionally so that you can work for his kingdom and for his glory amen by the grace of god amen amen he said it is the gospel of your salvation and he said listen closely after that ye believe you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise and in the last days the bible said in the last days there's going to be two classes of people one of them is going to have the seal of god and the other one the mark of the beast amazing and he said if the seal of god is the holy ghost then without the holy ghost is the mark of the beast so we either got the holy ghost or the mark of the beast and your attitude your actions your reactions bears witness of the spirit that you that controls you is it the holy ghost or is it the mark of the beast amazing amen he said the seal of god is the holy ghost then without the holy ghost is the mark of the beast and he said knowing there's ten virgins went out to meet the lord all sanctified all holy every one of them sanctified and he said five were dilatory and let their lights go out five had oil in their lamps and the bright behold the bridegroom cometh and the five that had all in their lamps went into the wedding supper and the others were left outside where there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth amen grace for full holy ghost adoption amen praise the lord and in the message the revelation of jesus christ amen chapter 5. bear with me again praise the lord he said how do we get in christ by one spirit we're all baptized into one body which is the body of christ and he said grace unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ amen he has sealed us in by his spirit and now is revealing to us all the things that's in the future for us and we are up to the seven seals amen by the grace of god and he said now he said let me just quote another scripture all that he foreknew he has called and all that he called is justified and all that he justified he had glorified amen all the way from the beginning god in his great infinite mind foresaw his church and predestinated it unto the adoption of children through jesus christ amen praise the lord to give eternal life at the end of the age by the grace of god amen he said we are predestinated with the lamb and the holy spirit is our seal and the earnest means more is yet to come we only have the earnest of it now the earnest is just a down payment yeah that owes it and secures it and anchors it and so no one else can touch it it's the earnest of our adoption amen the power the anointing of the holy ghost it is the earnest of our adoption praise the lord looking for and longing for the complete adoption and he said the complete adoption is in glory is getting out of time into eternity and is getting into a glorified body amen amen brother those that are experiencing the spirit of adoption they've been predestinated onto a glorified body amen praise the name of the lord he said we are waiting he said for the fullness of adoption and this will take place when he said at the first resurrection and he said that's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that that we are and we'll have a body like his glorious body amen the fullness of adoption is to end the resurrection amen we've experienced it we've got it in a new birth experienced it but it's moving us on to the fullness amen to be borne again into a glorified body by the grace of god amen amen and amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah this is the message on blasphemous names let me just give you three or four quotes from this message oh my please i tell you this adoption is just not a thought an experience we had an experience of adoption well that's it it's more than that it's it's the life adoption is the life of god in you amen and he said now he said get this listen here's what's wrong he said with the branham tabernacle he said there is two different kinds of faith two different kinds of virtue and as i added the other day two different kinds of knowledge two different kinds of temperance he said one thinks it's prohibition he said they ain't that ain't the kind of temperance that god's talking about he says that ungodly uncontrollable temper you got and things that flash back he said listen patience and so forth there's a mockery of it pretending to be a nature given faith yeah but he said the biggest part of our faith is mental faith do you have holy ghost faith or mental faith for most of them they just got a mental faith but for the few they have a holy ghost faith in the heart they're controlled by it out of the heart amen oh yeah you can be kind but not loving oh yeah that's right sister what if you you can go places and people think you're you're you're you're nice you're kind you're kind you're kind but they're not loving there's a difference oh yeah i've met kind people i met nice people but they weren't loving no no but if you're born again you got the love of god the love of god amen oh brother that's beyond any human love hallelujah amen she said though he said the biggest part of our faith is mental faith and by hearing the word it we bring brings us to a mental mental recognition of god amen but he said what about a godly faith do you have a mental faith or a godly faith a mental faith or a holy ghost faith is it all up here or is it down here in the heart he said when the word itself is poured into our faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation so is the word just knowledge or spiritual revelation amen you can't get away from it no you're spiritual and you love the lord oh yeah you got a holy ghost love amen he said now he's a coming from the holy spirit what is what has come and then he he will give to you supernatural faith spiritual faith that here at the bottom and he said then that spiritual faith recognizes only the word amen so we got to go make sure that we we're we're not we're not under the control of mental faith we're under the control of spiritual faith holy ghost faith by the grace of god you can have intellectual faith and you just got the letter of the word yeah but if you've got the spirit of the word amen it controls your life your thoughts your words your deeds your attitudes your actions your reactions or if you got a holy ghost faith i tell you you're governed by divine love amen he said god has predestinated us unto the adoption of sons amen i trust by grace that we're under the predestination of god amen not just to all believers believe the message believe this believe that no sons and daughters of god by the grace of god we've been adopted and brought back amen and when a son is born into it it's a sun but that sun at tutors to raise it and if that son never did come to the right kind of a son he never becomes an heir and he said but if he was the right son and the son that would obey his father then that son was adopted positionally amen he'd become a hair of what the father had amen praise the lord grace to us he said there is where our pentecostal people have made a mistake being born into the family up by the holy ghost that's right but then we must be right kind of children tutored by the right tutor amen you have an experience with god that's good but make sure you're going to be taught and trained to and tutored as worthless the right way by the grace of god oh yeah god oh yeah well well that's all it is i'm born again so i don't have to worry about this do not worry with that as i said like that believer that i heard praying at the altar and i i was kneeling down and that person was kneeling next to me and they prayed and said lord thank you for your deliverance thank you for bringing us out of denomination and now we don't have to be under the control of any man anymore amen well brother they came in under control of this this prophet that prophet but they came under the control of another prophet amen by the grace of god so brother oh yeah just think we're not in denomination but still we got to come under the control of the ministry yeah by the grace of god that's that's god's way of doing things god help us yeah as someone just recently informed us that they wouldn't be watching us online anymore because of a certain situation which they believe that that we sort of have done in the church here a certain thing and they said oh they want they won't be tuned in anymore yeah but what is is it are they doing something that god doesn't like maybe god don't tune into them that's right you got to be careful oh yeah so we were just informed of that so i pray the grace of god brother help us to prove our adoption that we are the sons and daughters of god by the grace of god amen always tremendous brother when i consider all this going on he said when the member is born by the holy ghost into the family of god and has proven to have these virtues in him that god can see virtue god can see knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness and godliness in him then god seals him or places him and he said that's when you see the sons and daughters of god amen the adopted sons and daughters of god by the grace of god amen brother god help us to keep the attitude right keep the spirit right amen proving our adoption amen that we are truly born again by the grace of god truly adopted into the family of god because we are the sons and daughters of god by the grace of god god bless you let's stand amen let's prove our adoption by the life we live amen let's sing
