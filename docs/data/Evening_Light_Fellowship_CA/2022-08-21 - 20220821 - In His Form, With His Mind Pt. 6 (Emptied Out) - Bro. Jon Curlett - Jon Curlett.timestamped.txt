[1:01:32] word this morning lord as our brother
[1:01:34] prayed earlier lord that you would
[1:01:36] anoint the lips to speak lord and the
[1:01:38] ears to hear or that they would be in
[1:01:40] sync with your spirit lord god that we
[1:01:42] would hear what the spirit is saying to
[1:01:44] the church in this time lord jesus
[1:01:46] lord have your way in this people have
[1:01:48] your way through me this morning lord we
[1:01:50] ask
[1:01:50] in jesus christ's name we're praying
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:54] and amen and god bless you if you'll
[1:01:56] turn the scriptures to philippians
[1:01:58] chapter 3 thanking musicians as always
[1:02:01] and then certainly appreciate the
[1:02:03] specials this morning that was just
[1:02:04] beautiful
[1:02:06] i feel like it's uh
[1:02:08] it's certainly a sacrifice
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:12] it's a sacrifice to come up and lay
[1:02:14] yourself before the people and before
[1:02:16] god and
[1:02:17] and just sing your heart out amen
[1:02:20] it's always a limited edition when
[1:02:22] sister amber gets up
[1:02:23] and then if if she was a hockey card
[1:02:25] she'd be worth a million dollars i think
[1:02:27] because we only get about one a year but
[1:02:29] we're thankful for every time we get it
[1:02:30] amen and then i believe god leads and
[1:02:32] guides it's not about the the quantity
[1:02:35] it's about the quality i believe amen so
[1:02:37] praise the lord for that and certainly
[1:02:39] for sister kimberly as well we
[1:02:40] appreciate it
[1:02:41] and then god bless them both philippians
[1:02:43] 3 verse 4
[1:02:46] says though i might have confidence in
[1:02:48] the flesh
[1:02:49] if any other man think it that he hath
[1:02:51] aware of he might might trust in the
[1:02:53] flesh
[1:02:54] i more
[1:02:55] it's an interesting thing for a prophet
[1:02:57] the age to say paul's saying if any man
[1:02:58] has reason to think of himself highly
[1:03:01] it's me
[1:03:02] that sounds egotistical doesn't it
[1:03:05] paul says i'm the best of the best
[1:03:07] if anybody has a reason to think that
[1:03:09] they're great it's me
[1:03:12] he says i was circumcised the eighth day
[1:03:14] of the stock of israel of the tribe of
[1:03:15] benjamin and hebrew of the hebrews as
[1:03:18] touching the law of pharisee
[1:03:20] concerning zeal
[1:03:22] persecuting the church
[1:03:24] touching the righteousness which is in
[1:03:25] the law
[1:03:26] blameless paul says i did it all but
[1:03:30] what things were gained to me
[1:03:32] those i counted loss for christ
[1:03:35] he says yea doubtless and i count all
[1:03:38] things but loss
[1:03:40] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[1:03:42] christ jesus my lord
[1:03:44] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[1:03:47] things
[1:03:48] what are you willing to lose this
[1:03:49] morning
[1:03:53] and to count them but dung
[1:03:55] that i may win christ
[1:03:59] he found something he was willing to pay
[1:04:01] the price for
[1:04:03] and be found in him not having my known
[1:04:05] righteousness which he just spent a
[1:04:06] couple verses telling us about
[1:04:09] which is of the law but that which is
[1:04:10] through the faith of christ the
[1:04:12] righteousness which is of god
[1:04:14] by faith
[1:04:15] that i may know him
[1:04:18] and the power of his resurrection
[1:04:21] we love that
[1:04:23] but then he says and the fellowship of
[1:04:24] his sufferings
[1:04:26] be made conformable unto his death
[1:04:29] if by any means i might attain unto the
[1:04:32] resurrection of the dead that's what
[1:04:33] paul had that mattered most was his
[1:04:35] resurrection he knew that he wasn't
[1:04:37] going in a rapture you know that was for
[1:04:39] a time in the future but he says i've
[1:04:41] got to make that resurrection mourning
[1:04:42] amen
[1:04:43] he was looking for what not the life
[1:04:45] here but the life hereafter
[1:04:47] he says not as though i had already
[1:04:49] attained
[1:04:50] either were already perfect
[1:04:52] but i follow after
[1:04:54] if that i may apprehend that for which i
[1:04:57] am also apprehended of christ jesus
[1:05:00] brethren i count not myself to have
[1:05:02] apprehended he says i don't consider
[1:05:04] myself to have it all amen but this one
[1:05:07] thing i do
[1:05:08] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:05:10] and reaching forth under those things
[1:05:12] which are before
[1:05:14] he says i'm not fully mature i'm not
[1:05:16] fully ready i'm not fully prepared for
[1:05:18] this yet
[1:05:19] he says but in spite of that he says i
[1:05:21] press toward the mark
[1:05:23] for the prize of the high calling of god
[1:05:25] in christ jesus
[1:05:27] he says let us therefore as many be
[1:05:29] perfect be thus minded amen and if in
[1:05:32] anything he be otherwise minded god
[1:05:35] shall reveal even this
[1:05:37] unto you he says it's not wrong if you
[1:05:39] have a different mind he says but let
[1:05:41] god change your mind and reveal a new
[1:05:43] way of going so that you can come into a
[1:05:45] more perfect way a more mature way amen
[1:05:47] god bless you may have your seats this
[1:05:49] morning
[1:05:51] amen
[1:05:52] we want to continue in our our little
[1:05:54] series and we've got just a couple more
[1:05:56] services as far as i know but i want to
[1:05:57] take a a title this morning of in his
[1:05:59] form and with his mind of course but i
[1:06:01] want to preach on emptied out amen
[1:06:04] emptied out we're talking about having
[1:06:06] the mind of christ and before you can
[1:06:08] ever get the mind of christ you've got
[1:06:09] to get rid of the mind that's inside of
[1:06:10] you amen last service we we talked about
[1:06:13] the the the upper room experience and
[1:06:15] the day at pentecost and
[1:06:17] and what happened to those people up
[1:06:19] there and it's the new birth what they
[1:06:21] had up there was the new birth and it's
[1:06:22] what jesus said nicodemus had to have he
[1:06:24] said that's what every man and every
[1:06:26] woman that comes into the kingdom of god
[1:06:27] has to have is a new birth but we didn't
[1:06:30] really talk much about what happened
[1:06:31] before that
[1:06:32] and what was going on up there for those
[1:06:34] 10 days and it's amazing because we we
[1:06:37] tell our young people especially you
[1:06:38] know we we that are maybe more mature in
[1:06:40] christ we've had the holy ghost we've
[1:06:42] we've had the baptism the sealing of the
[1:06:43] holy ghost in our life and there's if
[1:06:45] there's one thing we teach our children
[1:06:46] it's get the holy ghost
[1:06:48] amen it's not get the doctrines of the
[1:06:50] church it's not it's not come to church
[1:06:53] all the time those are all good things
[1:06:54] but they can do all of those things and
[1:06:56] never get life i mean they can never get
[1:06:58] that token life of the blood that
[1:06:59] brother branham said was the holy spirit
[1:07:01] and there's a there's a process to
[1:07:03] getting the holy spirit
[1:07:05] you don't just get it one day amen
[1:07:06] there's something you have to do and we
[1:07:08] know what that is peter said it in acts
[1:07:10] 2 38 and he says you have to repent and
[1:07:12] be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:07:13] jesus christ for the for the remission
[1:07:15] of your sins and then you'll receive the
[1:07:17] baptism of the holy spirit and so often
[1:07:19] we're focused on getting the holy spirit
[1:07:22] but there's two things that have to
[1:07:23] happen before that and that's repentance
[1:07:25] and baptism now baptism we've got nailed
[1:07:27] down we know we know what how it's done
[1:07:29] we know the name it's done in we know
[1:07:30] the proper uh you know way of doing
[1:07:32] these things but repentance is something
[1:07:34] we don't talk too much about
[1:07:36] and if you'll remember i've said this
[1:07:37] many times the prophet of god said that
[1:07:39] the zeal of the age this age is to
[1:07:41] repent
[1:07:42] and there's a reason why and we're going
[1:07:44] to get into that this morning but as
[1:07:46] they were sitting up there in the in the
[1:07:48] upper room
[1:07:49] they had to have a change of something
[1:07:51] that happened up there something had to
[1:07:52] go on up there that hadn't happened in
[1:07:54] their days with jesus even as they they
[1:07:56] walked the earth with him and they saw
[1:07:57] the miracles and even they did miracles
[1:07:59] and signs and wonders and these things
[1:08:01] yet they were not fully converted
[1:08:03] remember jesus told peter when you're
[1:08:04] converted strengthen your brethren so
[1:08:06] there was something that had to go on in
[1:08:08] in peter's head and in peter's body and
[1:08:10] in peter's mind and these different
[1:08:11] things and same with every single other
[1:08:13] person up there
[1:08:14] and you say how long does that take well
[1:08:16] it took them 10 days
[1:08:17] it took them 10 days to get to the place
[1:08:19] where the holy spirit could drop into
[1:08:21] their lives
[1:08:22] now how long is it going to take you for
[1:08:23] me it took about six months from the day
[1:08:25] i got baptized to the day i knew that i
[1:08:27] received the holy ghost it was six
[1:08:28] months so it takes a different amount of
[1:08:30] time for each and every one of us but i
[1:08:32] will say this i believe if you set
[1:08:34] yourself aside from the things of the
[1:08:35] world if you set yourself aside from the
[1:08:37] things that distract us and the the
[1:08:39] hobbies and the entertainment and these
[1:08:41] things and you turn your face to the
[1:08:42] wall and you said lord i need the holy
[1:08:44] ghost you'll get it in the same 10 days
[1:08:46] if you put the same focus and effort
[1:08:48] into getting it and waiting on it and
[1:08:50] expecting for it that they did i believe
[1:08:52] you'll get the same results because
[1:08:54] brother brown says if you come to god
[1:08:56] with the same promise and you do the
[1:08:57] same thing that everyone else did then
[1:08:59] you'll get the same result but you got
[1:09:01] to come the same way and that's what
[1:09:02] their whole heart mind soul body
[1:09:05] everything they had was committed to
[1:09:06] getting the holy ghost and they were
[1:09:08] waiting to be endued with power on on
[1:09:10] high amen
[1:09:12] focus and intent matter so much amen i
[1:09:14] appreciated brother chad's prayer this
[1:09:16] morning on helping us to what lord focus
[1:09:18] on you more amen the times that we set
[1:09:21] aside the things that we do that that
[1:09:23] clog up our life get them out of our
[1:09:25] lives amen help us to focus more purely
[1:09:27] on god
[1:09:28] and i read this in the last couple of
[1:09:30] services but it behooves us to hear it
[1:09:32] again i think and in jeremiah 29 it says
[1:09:34] for i know the thoughts that i think
[1:09:36] towards you saith the lord thoughts of
[1:09:38] peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:09:40] unexpected end so if we're looking at
[1:09:42] god maybe like a amazon delivery service
[1:09:45] amen it's all on the shelf it's all
[1:09:48] waiting for you to hit the button
[1:09:52] there's nothing god doesn't have to
[1:09:53] create something new for you this
[1:09:55] morning but it's all sitting there in
[1:09:57] the promise of the word for you to take
[1:09:58] hold of this morning and guess what it
[1:10:00] was lovely in vancouver i could get a
[1:10:02] package in as little as three hours from
[1:10:04] amazon
[1:10:05] you know why because they had a delivery
[1:10:06] system they had a they have multiple
[1:10:08] warehouses right there i could get it in
[1:10:09] three hours from amazon
[1:10:11] guess what god can give it to you the
[1:10:13] second you asked for it because it's
[1:10:15] ready and prepared and waiting for those
[1:10:17] that are asking him for it
[1:10:19] amen
[1:10:20] god doesn't have to create this for you
[1:10:22] he's ready willing and able to do it he
[1:10:24] says look the thoughts i have towards
[1:10:25] you are of what peace not of evil
[1:10:29] it's all good stuff that god has waiting
[1:10:31] for us
[1:10:32] but watch what it takes to get it
[1:10:34] it says what there's going to be a day
[1:10:37] he says then shall you call upon me
[1:10:40] and ye shall go and pray unto me and i
[1:10:43] will hearken unto you these are
[1:10:44] prophetic words
[1:10:46] listen if you're not crying out to him
[1:10:47] today there's going to come a day when
[1:10:49] you're going to cry out if there's a day
[1:10:51] where you're if you're not asking today
[1:10:53] there's going to come a day where you're
[1:10:54] going to start asking because you're
[1:10:56] going to recognize that there's
[1:10:57] something missing in your life there's a
[1:10:58] need in your life that has to be changed
[1:11:00] amen there's something that has to be
[1:11:02] met it's deep inside of you amen and god
[1:11:05] says you will call on me
[1:11:07] and i will answer amen you will call you
[1:11:10] may not be calling today but on that day
[1:11:12] you're going to call and the day you
[1:11:14] call i'm going to answer you
[1:11:15] he says and you shall seek me
[1:11:18] that's prophetic you shall seek me
[1:11:22] and you shall find me amen you're going
[1:11:25] to seek and you're going to find you do
[1:11:26] not seek without finding when god's in
[1:11:28] the midst of it amen he says what when
[1:11:31] you shall search for me with all of your
[1:11:33] heart
[1:11:34] amen with all of your heart
[1:11:37] not just a little bit not just a bit
[1:11:39] here not just a bit there not just this
[1:11:41] portion of my life and not that portion
[1:11:43] but when you seek me with all of your
[1:11:45] heart with all of your soul with all of
[1:11:48] your mind that's when you're going to
[1:11:49] hear from heaven amen it's when you seek
[1:11:52] the way he's telling you to seek
[1:11:54] and he says you're going to seek
[1:11:57] you're not going to get away if you're a
[1:11:58] child of god you're going to seek what
[1:12:00] he has for you
[1:12:01] because he doesn't prepare it so that
[1:12:03] nobody will take use of it he's always
[1:12:05] got somebody that's going to call on his
[1:12:07] name amen we look at what that new birth
[1:12:09] was and peter on the day of pentecost
[1:12:11] did not preach it from an intellectual
[1:12:12] conception
[1:12:14] he might have known he might have had
[1:12:15] ideas before this ever happened but when
[1:12:17] he preached on the day of pentecost he
[1:12:19] didn't say that is that he said this is
[1:12:21] that
[1:12:22] it was something that peter had in his
[1:12:24] life he had gone through the steps the
[1:12:26] three works of grace repentance and
[1:12:27] these different things he had gone
[1:12:29] through all of it he'd been baptized and
[1:12:30] then he got the baptism of the holy
[1:12:32] ghost and he steps out and he says you
[1:12:33] need what i have
[1:12:35] you've got to go through the process
[1:12:37] that i went through
[1:12:39] and the majority of it happened up there
[1:12:41] in that little room amen with 120 other
[1:12:44] people
[1:12:45] acts 2 37 says now when they heard this
[1:12:48] they were pricked in their heart and
[1:12:49] they said to peter and the rest of the
[1:12:51] apostles men and brethren what shall we
[1:12:52] do peter's just finished telling them
[1:12:54] that you you crucified the prince of
[1:12:56] life
[1:12:57] you pro you crucified the messiah you
[1:12:59] pray you you crucified the christ you
[1:13:01] did it
[1:13:03] and their hearts were pricked and they
[1:13:05] said what do we do and peter said to
[1:13:07] them repent and be baptized every one of
[1:13:09] you in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:13:11] remission of sins
[1:13:13] not in titles
[1:13:14] in the name of jesus christ and you
[1:13:16] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:13:19] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:13:20] children and to all that are far off
[1:13:22] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:13:24] call and with many other words did he
[1:13:27] testify and exhort saying save
[1:13:29] yourselves from this untowards
[1:13:31] generation
[1:13:32] he says save yourself
[1:13:34] so often you people think in the world
[1:13:36] that the gospel is condemning them no
[1:13:37] the gospel is saying come
[1:13:39] get out of where you're in because
[1:13:41] that's going to a particular age you
[1:13:43] don't want to be a part of that you
[1:13:45] don't want to be with that when it falls
[1:13:46] off the edge of the cliff when it goes
[1:13:48] from mercy into judgment save yourself
[1:13:50] from this generation that word untoward
[1:13:53] means crooked
[1:13:55] curved that means it's not straight
[1:13:58] that means it's not consistent that
[1:13:59] means it moves with the times that it
[1:14:02] changes with the whims and the emotions
[1:14:04] and the schools and the education with
[1:14:06] the politics it's always moving around
[1:14:09] it's perverse and it's wicked he says
[1:14:12] save yourself from this generation
[1:14:14] then it says they that glad they
[1:14:16] received his word were baptized and the
[1:14:19] same day they were added unto them about
[1:14:21] three thousand souls
[1:14:22] now i want to talk about that word
[1:14:24] repent because it's it has so many
[1:14:26] angles to it and brother branham would
[1:14:28] say it this way he said they said men
[1:14:30] and brethren what can we do first
[1:14:33] they wanted to be saved
[1:14:35] now watch he's talking there to who
[1:14:39] unbelievers
[1:14:41] he said repent every one of you now what
[1:14:43] does repent mean repent means to be
[1:14:45] sorry for what you've done
[1:14:47] for instance what if i turned around
[1:14:49] right here and hit my brother without a
[1:14:50] cause and i want to repent for it i'd
[1:14:52] say brother neville i'm sorry i did that
[1:14:55] see well then if i say i'm sorry i did
[1:14:57] it and mean it from my heart
[1:15:00] i am repentant
[1:15:01] and if i'm sorry for my sins and ask god
[1:15:03] to forgive me i am repentant is that
[1:15:05] right all right peter said repent and be
[1:15:07] sorry for your sins and then be baptized
[1:15:09] in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:15:10] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:15:12] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:15:14] now this is often deeper than what
[1:15:15] people think because so many say well
[1:15:17] brother brahm said and the scripture
[1:15:19] indicates say you're sorry
[1:15:22] listen how many times have we seen
[1:15:23] politicians say they're sorry with zero
[1:15:25] repentance
[1:15:26] brother brahm says if i said i'm sorry
[1:15:29] and it's from my heart i am repentant
[1:15:33] amen so it has to come from your heart
[1:15:34] it has to be something inside of you
[1:15:36] that says that was wrong not because
[1:15:38] mama said it not because daddy said it
[1:15:40] not because the pastor said it not
[1:15:42] because my boss said it but because
[1:15:43] something in my heart is pricked
[1:15:46] that's what happened on the day of
[1:15:47] pentecost their hearts were pricked they
[1:15:49] mean it has to come from your heart how
[1:15:52] do you even repent of something if
[1:15:53] you're not truly sorry for it
[1:15:55] right what's it going to be it's just
[1:15:56] the formal proceedings without any
[1:15:58] sincerity to it and god doesn't accept
[1:16:00] the formal proceedings
[1:16:02] that's not the way it works
[1:16:04] amen their heart he says with your mouth
[1:16:06] you draw anatomy but your heart is far
[1:16:08] from me
[1:16:10] right why because there's no repentance
[1:16:11] there inside of you nothing has changed
[1:16:14] but your mouth is just spewing out what
[1:16:15] people tell you to do to try and make
[1:16:17] things right
[1:16:18] acts 2 37 says they were pricked in
[1:16:20] their heart
[1:16:22] now peter is only answering the question
[1:16:24] that those people asked
[1:16:26] they're the only ones that ask what can
[1:16:27] we do
[1:16:28] how do we fix this
[1:16:30] maybe there are others that say huh
[1:16:32] that's an interesting thought you're
[1:16:34] telling me that guy jesus was the
[1:16:35] messiah he was the christ huh
[1:16:38] but there were some people that were
[1:16:40] affected by peter's words and they said
[1:16:42] how do we fix what's going on inside of
[1:16:44] us right now
[1:16:45] what he's only talking to the ones that
[1:16:47] are impacted by it
[1:16:49] that's all you're looking for is the
[1:16:50] ones that are impacted by it it's not
[1:16:53] for everybody but there are those that
[1:16:55] were impacted and they had to get it
[1:16:57] fixed in their life now listen they had
[1:17:00] just crucified jesus 50 days before
[1:17:04] 51 in a bid i think anyways
[1:17:06] they just crucified him
[1:17:09] and now they're sitting there and saying
[1:17:11] what we did was wrong
[1:17:13] but on the day they crucified him they
[1:17:15] thought it was completely right they
[1:17:16] thought it was justified they thought it
[1:17:18] was the better thing to do let barabbas
[1:17:20] go and kill jesus everything inside of
[1:17:22] them was saying this is the right thing
[1:17:23] to do and they supported it
[1:17:26] and now they're sitting here on the day
[1:17:27] of pentecost and they're saying what do
[1:17:29] we do something's changed inside of us
[1:17:31] what's happened
[1:17:33] god started moving hasn't he because he
[1:17:35] blinded their eyes so that they would
[1:17:37] crucify him he had to pay a price he had
[1:17:39] to be crucified so he blinded their eyes
[1:17:41] but then he pulls it back off and all of
[1:17:43] a sudden their mind is working a
[1:17:45] different way their heart is in a
[1:17:46] different condition it's ready to
[1:17:48] receive the message that he brought in
[1:17:49] the first place
[1:17:50] they've gone from one thing to another
[1:17:52] in 50 days and they don't even know
[1:17:54] what's happening inside of them
[1:17:58] don't even know what's going on but
[1:17:59] something has changed inside of them
[1:18:00] without them even knowing about it
[1:18:03] what happened to their minds
[1:18:04] god started moving
[1:18:06] god changed wrong in right into wrong
[1:18:10] in an unsafe person
[1:18:12] only god can do that
[1:18:14] only god can take somebody that's been
[1:18:15] drinking all their life smoking all
[1:18:17] their life living in adultery all their
[1:18:19] life watching movies all their life
[1:18:20] doing all the things the world does and
[1:18:22] in one moment say whoa
[1:18:24] that's wrong and it's under what the
[1:18:26] preaching of the word
[1:18:28] not just over the pulpit but out of your
[1:18:31] lives
[1:18:32] amen out of your lives is going to do
[1:18:34] the same convicting that i can do over
[1:18:36] this pulpit or brother gerald can do it
[1:18:38] and then it's lives lived that's going
[1:18:39] to do that so many times amen but god is
[1:18:42] the one that's calling them that's the
[1:18:43] only way it can happen there was a time
[1:18:44] allotted and he he did the work in 120
[1:18:47] and then they came out and said this is
[1:18:48] what joel the prophet was talking about
[1:18:50] now is the day now is the time of
[1:18:52] salvation
[1:18:54] brother brown would say he said repent
[1:18:56] what is repent so he said to say you're
[1:18:58] sorry from your heart he says repent
[1:19:01] means to turn around you are going with
[1:19:03] the world turn around and go up towards
[1:19:07] god go up you're down here go up but he
[1:19:10] says go up towards god now you're
[1:19:13] looking down this way look up this way
[1:19:15] repent run along with a big long face
[1:19:17] like this well bless god i've been in
[1:19:19] the church for 40 years
[1:19:21] i've never understood a christian with a
[1:19:23] long face
[1:19:25] never understood a christian with a long
[1:19:26] face he says then repent look up this
[1:19:29] way and say hallelujah there it is yeah
[1:19:31] that's what you want to do turn around
[1:19:33] and look different
[1:19:35] he's not saying look different with your
[1:19:36] clothes he's saying look in a different
[1:19:37] direction look to something different
[1:19:39] than you were looking before he says
[1:19:41] that's what you should do
[1:19:43] but he says listen you've been in the
[1:19:44] church for 40 years and you haven't done
[1:19:46] this
[1:19:48] he says and it shows in your long face
[1:19:50] why because something's stolen something
[1:19:52] out of your life that ought to be there
[1:19:53] in the life of a believer and then in
[1:19:55] john 10 10 it says the thief cometh not
[1:19:58] before to steal and kill and to destroy
[1:20:00] i am come that they might have life and
[1:20:02] that they might have it more abundantly
[1:20:04] when we're sitting here with long faces
[1:20:06] what's it telling me
[1:20:07] the thief's been in and stole something
[1:20:09] that belongs to you
[1:20:11] or you never had it in the first place
[1:20:13] that's what brother i'm saying you never
[1:20:14] had in the first place you've been here
[1:20:15] for 40 years and you're still got to
[1:20:17] turn down mouth you still have a long
[1:20:19] face you don't have the joy of the holy
[1:20:21] ghost in your life
[1:20:24] the thief has been in our midst
[1:20:26] amen
[1:20:28] when someone can't muster up enough joy
[1:20:29] or peace to crack a smile as a believer
[1:20:31] i'm starting to question their current
[1:20:32] experience
[1:20:34] my voice is going pray for me
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:39] the prophet of god says repent means to
[1:20:40] turn around and go towards god
[1:20:43] now listen you'll go towards something
[1:20:45] if i was super charismatic guess what i
[1:20:47] could probably turn some of you towards
[1:20:49] me
[1:20:50] if you weren't a child of god
[1:20:53] but guess what children of god can get
[1:20:54] drawn by charismatic men
[1:20:56] by ministries
[1:20:57] by gifts
[1:20:59] right hey we can all we can all be
[1:21:01] influenced by those things but that's
[1:21:02] not what we're supposed to do but you'll
[1:21:04] be drawn towards what is calling you so
[1:21:07] the thing is what is calling you you
[1:21:08] have to make sure it's god every single
[1:21:10] time because if you're called towards
[1:21:11] another voice if you're called towards
[1:21:13] another church if you're called towards
[1:21:14] a ministry or gift that's where you're
[1:21:16] going to go
[1:21:17] so you've got to make sure that it's god
[1:21:18] calling you every time amen you can
[1:21:20] respond to an emotional pull over this
[1:21:22] pulpit and guess what you'll do you'll
[1:21:24] be stuck in emotional polls the rest of
[1:21:25] your life because that's what you felt a
[1:21:27] call to was not god but you responded to
[1:21:29] emotion
[1:21:30] right you can be drawn to to to to
[1:21:33] someone with a great gift up here until
[1:21:35] the point where that's the only one
[1:21:36] you'll listen to because their gift is
[1:21:38] so great
[1:21:39] that's not the holy
[1:21:40] spirit it might be the holy spirit in
[1:21:42] them it's not the holy spirit in you
[1:21:44] that's doing that sort of having that
[1:21:45] sort of an effect amen
[1:21:47] but we're in this this series of in his
[1:21:49] form and with his mind and when i looked
[1:21:50] at that word repent in the original
[1:21:52] language it speaks of our minds
[1:21:56] and it means to change one's mind
[1:22:00] not just to have a different thought or
[1:22:02] a different idea of what's wrong but
[1:22:03] literally to change one's mind for the
[1:22:06] better to heartily amend with the
[1:22:09] abhorrence of one's past sins
[1:22:12] so to recognize that the way you've been
[1:22:14] walking was not just wrong but it was
[1:22:17] abhorrent in god's eyes
[1:22:19] that there was no rightness there was no
[1:22:21] goodness about it it was completely
[1:22:23] opposite of what god wants you to do in
[1:22:25] your life amen right
[1:22:27] now that's the hardest thing to do being
[1:22:29] raised in the message church because you
[1:22:30] think well i've been raised right and
[1:22:31] i've been doing right
[1:22:33] listen you haven't i say by experience
[1:22:35] my thoughts and attitudes towards people
[1:22:37] and situations around the message and in
[1:22:39] this church were completely different
[1:22:41] before and after i got the holy ghost
[1:22:44] completely different
[1:22:45] the way i looked at scripture was
[1:22:47] completely different the way i applied
[1:22:49] it how much i looked at myself as
[1:22:50] opposed to how much i looked at other
[1:22:52] people changed a whole lot too
[1:22:54] right you can be raised in it all day
[1:22:56] long but listen we've got to repent
[1:22:57] completely and say none of it is worth
[1:22:59] bringing forward
[1:23:01] let me start anew on a firm foundation
[1:23:04] clear everything out
[1:23:06] empty out is what we're talking about
[1:23:08] this morning set it all aside and then
[1:23:10] if he wants to take a brick i've thrown
[1:23:11] away and put it back in because it was
[1:23:13] good that's up to him but don't start
[1:23:14] building the foundation don't continue
[1:23:16] with the foundation you built on
[1:23:18] anything other than the true and genuine
[1:23:19] new birth in your life
[1:23:21] amen
[1:23:23] in other words that word repent means
[1:23:25] you have to upgrade your mind
[1:23:27] you have to get a new mind
[1:23:30] it's not just a cleaning
[1:23:32] it's a new one
[1:23:34] because the old one doesn't work with
[1:23:36] god
[1:23:38] romans 8 says
[1:23:39] for they that are after the flesh do
[1:23:41] mind the things of the flesh but they
[1:23:44] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:23:46] the spirit for to be carnally minded is
[1:23:50] death
[1:23:52] so any aspect of the carnal mind
[1:23:56] in the christian walk leads to one thing
[1:23:58] and that's death
[1:24:00] he says but to be spiritually minded is
[1:24:03] life
[1:24:04] and peace
[1:24:06] so one's death the other one's life
[1:24:07] you'd say i'll be happy with life he
[1:24:08] says to be spiritually minded is life
[1:24:10] and peace
[1:24:12] it's a peace that passes all
[1:24:13] understanding as the scripture says
[1:24:15] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:24:18] against god and that that word enmity
[1:24:20] means it is an enemy it is contrary to
[1:24:23] it is never in agreement with never ever
[1:24:26] ever is the carnal mind in agreement
[1:24:28] with the spirit and mind of god ever
[1:24:30] it is enmity paul says for it is not
[1:24:33] subject to the law of god neither indeed
[1:24:36] can be it's not subject to the law of
[1:24:38] god what is the law of god to the
[1:24:39] believer the word through the holy
[1:24:41] spirit
[1:24:44] he says so then they that are in the
[1:24:45] flesh cannot please god in the fleshly
[1:24:48] mind
[1:24:49] in the carnality that is to be human
[1:24:51] none of it can ever please god
[1:24:54] but listen to this he says but ye are
[1:24:56] not in the flesh
[1:24:59] but in the spirit if so be that the
[1:25:01] spirit of god dwell in you he says
[1:25:03] you're not in the flesh in the spirit if
[1:25:04] the spirit dwells in you
[1:25:06] you've got to have the spirit dwelling
[1:25:08] in you to be what he says is out of the
[1:25:10] flesh
[1:25:10] he says now if any man have not the
[1:25:12] spirit of christ he is none of his you
[1:25:15] must be born again he said to nicodemus
[1:25:18] and that goes for every single person in
[1:25:19] this church every single person in the
[1:25:21] world you must be born again it is not
[1:25:23] receiving the message of the hours not
[1:25:25] accepting the the prophet of the age it
[1:25:27] is accepting the person of jesus christ
[1:25:29] into your life
[1:25:30] that's the only way he says if christ be
[1:25:33] in you
[1:25:35] paul says it if christ be in you this
[1:25:38] body is dead because of sin but the
[1:25:41] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:25:44] amen brother brown speaking of the the
[1:25:45] signs and the miracles and wonders of
[1:25:47] these things he says the same things
[1:25:49] will blind the eyes of the carnal mind
[1:25:51] because it can't understand the things
[1:25:53] of god can't even comprehend it can't
[1:25:55] put it in its rightful place
[1:25:57] it's against god it's the enemy of gods
[1:26:00] the human mind is the enemy to god
[1:26:03] you've got to get out of your own human
[1:26:05] mind and be born anew by the holy spirit
[1:26:08] and get the mind of god in you then you
[1:26:11] can believe these things then it becomes
[1:26:13] a reality he says amen so be it
[1:26:16] so be it
[1:26:17] he says see what the world calls great
[1:26:19] god calls foolish and what the world
[1:26:22] calls foolish god calls great that's
[1:26:24] right so don't mind to be called foolish
[1:26:28] because remember
[1:26:29] you can't have the mind of christ and
[1:26:31] the mind of the world at the same time
[1:26:35] you can't be now what does that look
[1:26:37] like he says you can't be in your way
[1:26:40] and god's way at the same time
[1:26:44] you can't be in your way and god's way
[1:26:47] at the same time you have to get out of
[1:26:49] your own way to let god have his way
[1:26:52] that's the only way you're ever going to
[1:26:54] do anything you've got to get away from
[1:26:56] your own thoughts your own reasons don't
[1:26:59] try to reason he said just believe grace
[1:27:01] example i know this in the scripture is
[1:27:03] moses
[1:27:05] right he had the calling he had the
[1:27:07] election he had the purpose he knew who
[1:27:08] he was knew what he was supposed to do
[1:27:10] and we read that quote where brother
[1:27:11] branham said he tried his intellect he
[1:27:13] tried his education he tried his way he
[1:27:14] tried his his might he tried his
[1:27:17] strength and none of it worked and then
[1:27:18] he did it god's way and it worked
[1:27:20] amen
[1:27:22] take an example go god's way the first
[1:27:23] way
[1:27:24] amen choose that the first time seek
[1:27:26] that out rather than presume that
[1:27:28] because we're we're this or we're that
[1:27:29] then we automatically know
[1:27:31] he says you have to forget all you ever
[1:27:34] knowed in order to learn of him empty
[1:27:36] out that he can fill us he says you
[1:27:38] don't mix it now you have to empty out
[1:27:42] amen can i say this bluntly this morning
[1:27:45] if your thinking hasn't changed since
[1:27:46] you got saved
[1:27:48] you haven't been saved
[1:27:50] you don't have the new birth if you just
[1:27:52] continued on as you were as if nothing
[1:27:54] had ever happened then there's a problem
[1:27:56] in your experience because repentance
[1:27:58] brings a new mind amen it is not
[1:28:01] necessarily the mind but there's
[1:28:02] something that happens there that says
[1:28:04] what's wrong is right and what's right
[1:28:05] is wrong now it flips the switch there
[1:28:08] so that you can start walking with god
[1:28:09] and that keeps going and going and going
[1:28:11] and going and it's a process that's
[1:28:12] going on even today
[1:28:14] amen it's not that it's all gone because
[1:28:16] it's a process god's working through us
[1:28:17] he's cleaning things out he's changing
[1:28:19] things amen but repentance requires it
[1:28:22] is defined by a changing of your mind
[1:28:25] you have to have a different mindset
[1:28:27] after this is done amen
[1:28:28] you let go of what you were because it
[1:28:30] was wrong and you embrace christ because
[1:28:33] he's the only thing that's right
[1:28:35] so you let it go you let it go
[1:28:36] completely
[1:28:38] but says pentecostal people letting them
[1:28:40] do that too yeah they want a shortcut to
[1:28:42] heaven hallelujah all i have to do is
[1:28:44] get down here and just don't think of
[1:28:46] nothing at all and say hallelujah
[1:28:48] hallelujah i got on elijah's garment i'm
[1:28:50] going out tomorrow to cast out devils
[1:28:52] hallelujah hallelujah i got it praise
[1:28:54] god here i go lots of enthusiasm he says
[1:28:57] they want the shortcut to heaven taking
[1:28:59] as much of the world as they can take
[1:29:03] what you're in the church and you're
[1:29:05] experiencing the presence of god but you
[1:29:07] want to go right back out and continue
[1:29:09] on doing things as if nothing has ever
[1:29:11] changed
[1:29:12] you want the the good times here and the
[1:29:14] good times out there and the good times
[1:29:16] in here don't match the good times out
[1:29:17] there
[1:29:18] amen
[1:29:19] okay you can't get sweet water and salt
[1:29:21] water out of the same fountain bubble
[1:29:23] says you can't do this
[1:29:24] he says you can't take any of it there's
[1:29:26] no shortcuts you come the way of calvary
[1:29:29] you come the way of the brass altar you
[1:29:31] come the way of the brazen serpent he
[1:29:33] says you die
[1:29:34] you actually die and i'm listening to
[1:29:36] him preach this and he says oh god why
[1:29:38] can't i say it right he says you die you
[1:29:42] literally die to yourselves you die to
[1:29:46] the things of the world and are born
[1:29:48] anew
[1:29:50] amen he says no world
[1:29:52] the things of the world is dead
[1:29:56] there's no shortcuts amen the things of
[1:29:59] the world are dead
[1:30:01] there's no shortcuts
[1:30:02] that's why i'd say the new birth is a
[1:30:04] mess
[1:30:06] why
[1:30:07] because you die
[1:30:09] i'm not going to get graphic but guess
[1:30:10] what deaths are messy
[1:30:14] when a person dies things relax things
[1:30:17] release things empty out
[1:30:20] any nurses or doctors or people that
[1:30:22] have been in the room when it happens
[1:30:23] it's not a pleasant experience if you
[1:30:25] stick around for a little bit
[1:30:27] it's a mess
[1:30:29] what is it you cut the strings to over
[1:30:31] relationships old friendships old habits
[1:30:35] old ways of doing things old ways of
[1:30:37] talking
[1:30:38] connections
[1:30:39] influences it all gets cut off in one
[1:30:41] moment and it's a mess
[1:30:44] it's like cutting off your arm
[1:30:47] if you cut your arm off
[1:30:49] there's a big mess there isn't it
[1:30:51] until things get tied off
[1:30:53] the same when you die it's a mess but
[1:30:55] guess what a new birth is a mess too
[1:30:57] because what you're coming out of
[1:30:58] something and life's coming with it and
[1:31:00] you're tied to something else
[1:31:02] and all those cords have to be cut as
[1:31:04] well don't they
[1:31:05] and there's things that surround it and
[1:31:07] and things that may be initially
[1:31:08] protected and they come out with it and
[1:31:10] they get discarded and now life comes
[1:31:11] out of it but a birth is anyone that has
[1:31:13] a kid that's been in the room it's a
[1:31:15] mess too
[1:31:17] it's as much a mess as death if not more
[1:31:19] many times
[1:31:21] it's not clean
[1:31:22] it's not surgical
[1:31:24] the work is surgical but the effect is
[1:31:26] messy amen
[1:31:29] amen you come out
[1:31:31] a baby comes out a baby doesn't come out
[1:31:33] running
[1:31:34] ready to paint pictures to have
[1:31:35] intellectual conversations what
[1:31:37] sometimes you make a mess as a baby too
[1:31:39] don't you
[1:31:41] because you don't know anything
[1:31:43] sometimes that makes messes in our in
[1:31:45] our relationships and in our marriages
[1:31:46] and and the different things we do
[1:31:48] sometimes our enthusiasm and our zeal
[1:31:50] gets the better of us and we can make
[1:31:51] messes that way too
[1:31:56] as soon as you're born what's the first
[1:31:58] thing that baby does
[1:32:00] cries
[1:32:02] all a baby knows is to cry
[1:32:05] listen no matter the problem with a baby
[1:32:07] it only has one response doesn't it
[1:32:09] it's to cry
[1:32:11] that's the only thing a baby knows
[1:32:13] it can't say mommy my diaper is wet
[1:32:16] or dirty
[1:32:18] it can't say i'm sleeping in an awkward
[1:32:20] position
[1:32:21] the only response a baby has is to cry
[1:32:25] and it's up to the one that knows what's
[1:32:27] going on to come over and figure it out
[1:32:29] for the baby the baby's job is to cry
[1:32:31] out
[1:32:33] and it's the father or the mother's job
[1:32:34] to come in and figure out what's wrong
[1:32:36] so that that baby will stop crying amen
[1:32:38] the baby may not even understand what it
[1:32:40] is that is truly wrong with it
[1:32:42] it can't say i'm hungry all it knows is
[1:32:45] there's something that doesn't feel good
[1:32:46] so it cries it can't say i'm wet all it
[1:32:49] knows is i'm uncomfortable i'm cold
[1:32:53] this doesn't feel good and so it cries
[1:32:55] and sometimes we're spiritual children
[1:32:58] and when we ought to be crying we're
[1:32:59] sitting there and we're trying to have
[1:33:00] an articulate conversation with god and
[1:33:02] say god this is wrong god this is wrong
[1:33:04] and god fix this and god do it this way
[1:33:06] and god do it that way and he's saying
[1:33:08] you're a spiritual child my son cry out
[1:33:11] let me figure it out let me do that i'm
[1:33:14] the father i'm papa you don't have a
[1:33:16] clue you're just a child in this area of
[1:33:18] your life don't tell me what to do just
[1:33:21] cry out and say i don't like this i'm
[1:33:23] not comfortable where i'm at
[1:33:26] i can't do what i'm supposed to do as a
[1:33:28] believer god help me
[1:33:30] god help me i don't know what's going on
[1:33:33] that's what we're looking for is people
[1:33:34] that will cry out don't presume on our
[1:33:37] maturity sometimes
[1:33:39] the bane of a believer is presumption
[1:33:43] you presume you're there we're not there
[1:33:45] we're not out of here we're growing
[1:33:47] we're maturing he's taking us somewhere
[1:33:51] cry out to papa god and say papa god i
[1:33:53] need this cleaned up something's wrong
[1:33:56] something's wrong and i can't tell you i
[1:33:58] won't presume to tell you
[1:34:00] but i need you to clean it up
[1:34:02] because otherwise i'm just going to be
[1:34:03] in a mess
[1:34:05] amen
[1:34:06] the prophet of god said christ had to
[1:34:08] die to make us alive to quicken us is
[1:34:10] that right no matter what church you
[1:34:12] belong to how many times you shook hands
[1:34:14] with the preacher how many names you got
[1:34:16] on the book or how many churches you
[1:34:17] belong to it doesn't mean that you've
[1:34:20] got to absolutely accept the death of
[1:34:22] the lord jesus christ and not only that
[1:34:24] but you've got to die to yourself
[1:34:26] listen to this you've got to die to
[1:34:29] every thought of the flesh so that you
[1:34:31] can receive the mind of christ and walk
[1:34:34] from henceforth not of your own but of
[1:34:36] his mind the mind of christ in you
[1:34:39] that's the only way you can stay alive
[1:34:43] that's the only way you can stay alive
[1:34:46] this morning that's the only way i can
[1:34:48] stay alive that's all i live by is by
[1:34:51] the holy spirit man said man shall or
[1:34:54] jesus said man shall not live by bread
[1:34:56] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:34:58] out of the mouth of god
[1:35:00] so many times i've spoken first and
[1:35:03] cried out later
[1:35:04] i want to flip that
[1:35:07] and cry out first and speak later amen
[1:35:11] lord here's a symptom
[1:35:14] but i don't know the root cause
[1:35:17] whether it's temper
[1:35:20] whether it's an inability to overcome
[1:35:22] whether it's addiction
[1:35:24] whether it's depression
[1:35:26] whether it's a feeling of helplessness
[1:35:27] or pointlessness lord i don't know where
[1:35:30] this is coming from
[1:35:32] but lord
[1:35:33] something's wrong
[1:35:34] because this is not the fruit of the
[1:35:36] holy spirit
[1:35:38] so instead of saying lord fix this area
[1:35:39] say lord i'm just telling you what the
[1:35:41] problem is i'm telling you what i'm
[1:35:42] feeling like a baby
[1:35:45] will you go into my life and change it
[1:35:47] will you go in and empty out what's
[1:35:48] causing the problem and fill it with the
[1:35:50] thing that'll make it all better
[1:35:53] brother branham he's talking he says as
[1:35:55] i was remarking some time ago about a
[1:35:56] certain little canary and he thought he
[1:35:58] knowed all the knowledge that need to be
[1:36:00] knowed and he knows so much that he
[1:36:01] could tell all the rest of the canaries
[1:36:02] about the human beings
[1:36:04] we call that a psychologist today
[1:36:08] so he flies up on his cage and he begins
[1:36:10] to speak about the human being how he
[1:36:12] knowed all about them and all of a
[1:36:14] sudden a professor from purdue walked up
[1:36:16] and began to speak some high polish
[1:36:18] words to him and the little fellow
[1:36:20] batted his eyes and turned his head
[1:36:23] he says now he had eyes he could see the
[1:36:26] professor
[1:36:27] he had ears he could hear him but of
[1:36:29] course he didn't know what he was
[1:36:30] talking about why he's got a canary
[1:36:33] brain he's just a bird brain
[1:36:36] listen your carnal mind it's a bird
[1:36:37] brain
[1:36:39] compared to god it's not even a bird
[1:36:41] brain it's a worm brain they don't have
[1:36:43] brains
[1:36:45] it's a worm brain
[1:36:46] he says he hasn't got a human brain so
[1:36:48] he can't think like human beings and
[1:36:50] neither can a human being think like god
[1:36:53] your human and all the worldly knowledge
[1:36:55] is no more than a canary brain
[1:36:58] all you do you just hurt yourself with
[1:37:01] it
[1:37:02] he says you've got to have the mind of
[1:37:05] christ
[1:37:06] listen job was a man that god was proud
[1:37:09] to brag about
[1:37:11] job was a man among men he was the best
[1:37:14] of the best he was the elite believer
[1:37:17] and job came to the place where god
[1:37:18] started talking to him and job said
[1:37:20] i will be silent
[1:37:23] the greatest man on the earth at that
[1:37:24] time and when god started talking job
[1:37:26] said i'll be silent
[1:37:28] he'd been talking a lot job had
[1:37:30] he had some things to say to god
[1:37:33] but when god started going and looking
[1:37:35] through the symptoms and making the
[1:37:36] diagnosis of what was going on in job's
[1:37:38] life job said i'm an idiot
[1:37:40] i'm just gonna shush
[1:37:42] we need to shush so often
[1:37:44] and let god have a little conversation
[1:37:46] with us amen too many times we presume
[1:37:49] on the two-way street
[1:37:50] and really it's a one-way from us to him
[1:37:53] and there's so little traffic coming
[1:37:54] back
[1:37:55] be like joel i will be silent
[1:37:58] why brother brown says compared to him
[1:38:01] we're canaries
[1:38:03] we're nothing we can't comprehend we can
[1:38:05] see and we can hear but there's no
[1:38:06] understanding of what god understands
[1:38:09] and the way he sees things and the way
[1:38:10] he does things amen
[1:38:13] he says people are told out on the west
[1:38:15] coast now they always have movements
[1:38:17] don't they brother batman's addressing
[1:38:18] one of the movements he says oh we got
[1:38:20] the immortal baptism we baptize you in
[1:38:22] water you turn right back to a young man
[1:38:24] right there a young woman yes sir you
[1:38:25] keep getting he says they got elijah's
[1:38:28] garments they got manifested sons of god
[1:38:30] yes sir god brother god is getting
[1:38:32] manifested sons right now
[1:38:35] hey we're preaching it in the message
[1:38:37] listen to this
[1:38:39] manifesting telling them all about it
[1:38:41] tonight you're a sinner tomorrow you're
[1:38:43] manifested sons of god he says nonsense
[1:38:46] where you get that in the word babies
[1:38:48] are not born men they're born babies and
[1:38:51] they grow to men
[1:38:53] amen there's a promise to the
[1:38:54] manifestation of the sons of god and it
[1:38:56] does not happen like that
[1:38:58] listen you're sealed into the kingdom in
[1:39:00] a moment i believe that but there is a
[1:39:02] process of training
[1:39:03] brother brahm said that's the way too
[1:39:06] many people do it too much carrying on
[1:39:08] without enough word behind it to back it
[1:39:10] up he says grow up
[1:39:12] oh he danced in the spirit last night
[1:39:14] brother branham he's all right no that
[1:39:16] don't make him all right to me no sir
[1:39:19] he's got to one grow up two be proved
[1:39:22] three tested growing up to him to reach
[1:39:25] four seasoned
[1:39:27] amen grow up proved tested and seasoned
[1:39:32] that's the way it works
[1:39:33] there is no born and then seasoned
[1:39:35] there's a lot happening in between there
[1:39:37] amen he says god's infinite and when he
[1:39:40] speaks it's got to be perfect he cannot
[1:39:42] change he says we cannot alter god's
[1:39:44] word we have to alter our thinking to
[1:39:48] his thinking let the mind of christ be
[1:39:50] in you then we'll think like he thinks
[1:39:54] so if you don't get rid of the old mind
[1:39:56] which starts with repentance then where
[1:39:58] do you end up
[1:40:00] you end up with dead works because you
[1:40:02] never started from the right place in
[1:40:03] the beginning you're not building on a
[1:40:05] foundation of repentance and so you get
[1:40:08] down the road and listen i know people
[1:40:09] that have been there and i know people
[1:40:11] that are there and they go down the road
[1:40:12] and they're 5 or 10 years later and
[1:40:14] they're struggling with their walk and
[1:40:15] they're saying what in the world went
[1:40:17] wrong
[1:40:18] i thought i had the holy ghost i thought
[1:40:19] i did everything right and you take it
[1:40:21] back and almost every time it goes
[1:40:22] straight back to repentance you didn't
[1:40:24] actually repent
[1:40:26] you just went and got baptized and then
[1:40:28] you were expecting the holy ghost and
[1:40:29] nothing changed in your mind god never
[1:40:31] did a work there you did it because you
[1:40:33] answered an emotional call not because
[1:40:34] there was a prick in your heart
[1:40:37] i will speak for myself and not not to
[1:40:39] raise myself up but to say the
[1:40:41] experience of uh uh of
[1:40:44] of when that con that conviction hits
[1:40:46] you is not the work of a moment and you
[1:40:48] don't get over it in a moment
[1:40:51] i know when brother braham says dioxide
[1:40:52] and we'll talk about it in a second a
[1:40:54] dry confession a dry confession makes no
[1:40:56] sense to me because it took me 45
[1:40:58] minutes to get from my seat to where
[1:41:00] those brothers prayed for me and then i
[1:41:01] went to get baptized later that evening
[1:41:03] 45 minutes and i cried and shook and
[1:41:06] cried and shook the entire time
[1:41:09] and i wasn't looking at anybody else
[1:41:10] except my life and saying unworthy
[1:41:13] unworthy unworthy
[1:41:18] there was no dry eyes there
[1:41:21] there's no looking around to see what
[1:41:22] people thought
[1:41:24] but when i went through that prayer line
[1:41:26] and i came out i was completely scoured
[1:41:28] out
[1:41:29] clean as a
[1:41:30] whistle i had no thoughts of guilt
[1:41:34] no thoughts of shame
[1:41:36] but i repented
[1:41:38] and i repented and i repented and it
[1:41:40] wasn't my work it was something in my
[1:41:42] heart that wouldn't stop until it was
[1:41:44] resolved that's what we're talking about
[1:41:46] not mommy and daddy told me to
[1:41:48] something in my heart says i got her
[1:41:50] change
[1:41:51] and that's what drew me up to there
[1:41:54] you know what did it praying praying
[1:41:56] parents
[1:41:56] praying church people
[1:41:59] looking for a real new birth in our
[1:42:00] young people amen
[1:42:04] without a sincere repentance without a
[1:42:05] change of your mind water baptism is
[1:42:07] just a dead work even if you do it in
[1:42:09] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:42:11] because you didn't
[1:42:12] repent
[1:42:14] lebron talks about he says in a great
[1:42:16] revival here not long ago up here one of
[1:42:18] these eastern states he says they
[1:42:19] claimed to have 30 000 converts and six
[1:42:22] weeks later they couldn't find 30 people
[1:42:23] holding out why it was just a cold
[1:42:26] dry-eyed confession
[1:42:28] god requires death
[1:42:30] and regeneration he says that's what the
[1:42:33] matter he says to come to the altar with
[1:42:35] a dry eye confession is a tradition
[1:42:39] you should die there to your sacrifice
[1:42:42] as you identify yourself that you are
[1:42:44] dead amen buried in christ the world is
[1:42:47] dead behind you and you're to walk in a
[1:42:49] new life with christ jesus in his
[1:42:52] resurrection loving his word taking his
[1:42:55] word watch him identify himself in his
[1:42:58] word as giving you the identification
[1:43:00] that you pass from death unto life it's
[1:43:03] not just die but out of that death comes
[1:43:05] life now he says what a time that we're
[1:43:07] living in yes sir now we see that we're
[1:43:09] living down to the last hours the
[1:43:11] believer must accept all the word
[1:43:16] he didn't restore it so we could ignore
[1:43:18] it
[1:43:19] right
[1:43:20] the opposite of repentance is what
[1:43:23] rebellion
[1:43:26] you feel it's wrong and then you say but
[1:43:28] i'm going to keep doing it amen right if
[1:43:31] you don't repent then it turns into
[1:43:32] rebellion and what happens if you insist
[1:43:34] on rebellion eventually it sears your
[1:43:36] conscience and so that you don't feel
[1:43:39] any conviction anymore and so you can do
[1:43:41] whatever you want
[1:43:43] if you turn down repentance then
[1:43:44] rebellion's going to come in
[1:43:47] first timothy 4 says now the spirit
[1:43:49] speaks speaketh
[1:43:50] expressly it means it's very specific
[1:43:53] about when this is going to happen that
[1:43:55] in the latter times which is when now
[1:43:59] so let me put it this way that today
[1:44:02] now some shall depart from the faith
[1:44:05] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[1:44:08] doctrines of devils
[1:44:10] i mean that's aimed at people that are
[1:44:11] going to leave the faith
[1:44:13] we've seen it haven't we and we're still
[1:44:15] seeing it
[1:44:16] people that are leaving the faith and
[1:44:18] what caused it seducing spirits
[1:44:21] that's one thing guess what that's not
[1:44:22] always over a pulpit
[1:44:24] there can be all sorts of things that
[1:44:26] are seducing you drawing away your time
[1:44:27] and energy and efforts getting your mind
[1:44:29] out of the word and getting it into
[1:44:31] something else and then he says there's
[1:44:32] doctrines of devils and that's preached
[1:44:34] over the pulpit
[1:44:36] he says speaking lies in hypocrisy
[1:44:39] having their conscience here with a hot
[1:44:41] iron that speaking lies in hypocrisy
[1:44:43] means that you're excluding yourself
[1:44:44] from the requirement of the word of god
[1:44:47] and what happens is as soon as you do
[1:44:49] that he says that your your conscience
[1:44:51] starts to get seared and when your
[1:44:53] conscience is seared what do you start
[1:44:54] doing you start telling other people
[1:44:56] they can do the same thing you do
[1:44:58] and guess what that's lovely for the
[1:44:59] carnal mind that's lovely for the flesh
[1:45:02] you can do what i do and because i'm a
[1:45:03] preacher and i do it then you can do it
[1:45:05] too and they're taking their cues from
[1:45:06] the ministry rather than the word and
[1:45:08] the holy spirit
[1:45:09] right you check everything i say you
[1:45:11] check everything brother gerald says
[1:45:12] against the word don't do it if it's not
[1:45:14] in the word amen but they listen to the
[1:45:16] doctrines of devils
[1:45:18] and it draws them into a place where
[1:45:19] they get their conscience here and
[1:45:20] they're an open rebellion again amen
[1:45:24] that's why i said the other day i said
[1:45:25] when people go against the word when
[1:45:27] they make decisions in their life when
[1:45:29] they do something that is contrary to
[1:45:30] what god has said what do you do
[1:45:33] you tell them
[1:45:34] and then you let them go
[1:45:36] because you can't you can't cushion the
[1:45:38] chastising of god
[1:45:40] that's his chastising
[1:45:42] so and i'm speaking by experience right
[1:45:44] you walk away people warn you you do
[1:45:46] something you ought not to do god spanks
[1:45:48] you and guess what having your brother
[1:45:49] there ain't going to make it any easier
[1:45:51] all you're doing is getting them
[1:45:51] involved having your sister in there
[1:45:53] just gets them involved you got to take
[1:45:54] the spanking amen but like the prodigal
[1:45:57] son we stand where
[1:45:59] back home
[1:46:00] on the word
[1:46:02] and we say come on home
[1:46:04] we're looking
[1:46:05] every day the father was out looking for
[1:46:07] them to come home wasn't he
[1:46:08] he didn't lose his sonship
[1:46:11] he just lost some of his innocence
[1:46:13] right and he got some pain and he got
[1:46:15] some heart he got some offenses
[1:46:18] he got to a place where he had to eat
[1:46:19] pigs food
[1:46:20] that's when he finally said hey i'm
[1:46:22] better than this i come from a better
[1:46:24] lineage than to have to eat pigs food
[1:46:26] i don't enjoy it anymore
[1:46:28] amen he came to himself the scripture
[1:46:30] says
[1:46:31] brother jason watkins said this he said
[1:46:33] a friend is someone that holds you
[1:46:35] accountable to the word
[1:46:38] that's a tough thing to do to say to a
[1:46:39] brother or sister hey
[1:46:42] shouldn't do it
[1:46:44] but he says that's what a friend will do
[1:46:45] hold you accountable to the word amen
[1:46:48] because why
[1:46:49] i'm not for or against you
[1:46:51] i'm for the word amen and then the
[1:46:53] question is what are you for
[1:46:56] because if you're not for the word then
[1:46:57] you've got to go but i'm going to stay
[1:46:59] with the word so i'm not for brother
[1:47:01] vaishal
[1:47:02] i'm for the word and as long as brother
[1:47:04] weissel stays with the word then we're
[1:47:05] great
[1:47:06] but if he gets out then what happens
[1:47:08] fellowship pulls away
[1:47:10] why because he's not for the word he's
[1:47:12] not for me
[1:47:13] i'm not for him we're for the word
[1:47:15] and as soon as that changes then there's
[1:47:17] what a barricade comes up to fellowship
[1:47:19] barricade comes up to relationship
[1:47:20] because why we're serving two different
[1:47:23] masters at that moment
[1:47:24] right and we've got to come back to the
[1:47:25] same page we've got to come back to the
[1:47:27] same foundation we've got to come back
[1:47:28] to the home
[1:47:29] and home base is always the word of god
[1:47:31] amen
[1:47:34] i'm not trying to be dark or harsh with
[1:47:35] this i'm telling you that's what the
[1:47:37] prophet said is what the scripture says
[1:47:39] look out for it i like what brother
[1:47:40] eargley said it really struck me when he
[1:47:42] preached he says sometimes lacks-ness
[1:47:44] isn't from being backslidden he says
[1:47:46] sometimes it's a lack of fervency
[1:47:50] i thought that was amazing
[1:47:52] i thought that was amazing he says
[1:47:53] listen it's not that you're out there
[1:47:54] doing bad things it's that you're not
[1:47:56] doing the right things
[1:47:58] and what happens is then you start to
[1:48:00] slide into other things what slack
[1:48:02] living depression feelings of
[1:48:03] pointlessness questions worry mindless
[1:48:05] entertainment what you're trying to get
[1:48:07] something in there that's going to make
[1:48:08] you feel the way that god intends you to
[1:48:11] feel which is fulfilled right
[1:48:13] but because you're not in his place
[1:48:15] you'll fill it with anything else trying
[1:48:17] to do what gets you back to that place
[1:48:19] the only way to get back to that place
[1:48:20] is to go back to that place
[1:48:23] right
[1:48:25] what standing somewhere in the shadows
[1:48:26] you'll find jesus
[1:48:28] right where right where you left him
[1:48:30] right where you left him he doesn't move
[1:48:32] on without you
[1:48:33] right he just sits there like the
[1:48:35] prodigal father saying
[1:48:37] is she coming back
[1:48:40] don't see her
[1:48:43] all right another day
[1:48:44] i'll be here tomorrow
[1:48:47] 24 7
[1:48:48] 365.
[1:48:50] he stands there
[1:48:52] waiting for you to come back where you
[1:48:53] left him
[1:48:58] i started with paul's words this morning
[1:49:00] because they speak so eloquently of what
[1:49:02] it looks like to experience the new
[1:49:03] birth
[1:49:04] in the changing of your mind amen he
[1:49:06] gave all his credentials as to why he
[1:49:08] was an awesome person
[1:49:10] paul was a pretty awesome person before
[1:49:12] he got saved and he was the enemy of god
[1:49:16] the enemy of the true church
[1:49:18] he was antichrist
[1:49:20] and he was an awesome guy amen
[1:49:23] philippians 3 we're going to close
[1:49:25] shortly he says but what things were
[1:49:26] gained to me those i counted lost for
[1:49:28] christ
[1:49:29] this is a beautiful before and after
[1:49:31] picture
[1:49:32] he says yea doubtless and i count all
[1:49:34] things but lost for the excellency of
[1:49:36] the knowledge of christ jesus my lord
[1:49:38] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[1:49:40] things and do count them but dung that i
[1:49:43] may win christ you can't make anything
[1:49:45] less valuable than dung
[1:49:48] if you're to sell something on the open
[1:49:49] market dung's about as low as it gets
[1:49:51] unless you're a farmer
[1:49:53] right paul says that's the kind of value
[1:49:55] we attach to our achievements
[1:49:57] and the things that we've done in our
[1:49:59] life the gifts we bring
[1:50:01] he says it's all done
[1:50:04] the prophet of god puts it this way he
[1:50:06] says well i was studying one day what
[1:50:07] was this pitch he's talking about noah's
[1:50:09] ark pitch to us is tar that we take
[1:50:11] chemicals and make tar and pitch the
[1:50:13] road the cracks in the road and so forth
[1:50:15] with tar but those days it was different
[1:50:16] they had a rosin tree and they'd take
[1:50:18] this evergreen and cut it down and
[1:50:20] instead of having the things that we do
[1:50:21] today to take the rosin out they beat
[1:50:23] the tree and they beat the tree till the
[1:50:25] sap and rosin poured out then they would
[1:50:27] heat it and pour it upon the soft gopher
[1:50:29] wood that was like a sponge and it just
[1:50:32] filled up
[1:50:33] and then when it got hardened you
[1:50:35] couldn't drive a nail in it see it was
[1:50:37] ready to receive he says that's like
[1:50:40] christ he's talking about the beating
[1:50:42] tree the tree that's beaten so that
[1:50:43] things flow out of it
[1:50:45] then he switches to the to the other
[1:50:47] word or to the other tree which is the
[1:50:49] the gopher wood he says that's the
[1:50:51] church
[1:50:52] see the church must empty itself out and
[1:50:55] get real light
[1:50:57] get all the denomination out of you now
[1:50:59] listen
[1:51:01] raised in the message in the message we
[1:51:03] don't have a concept of what
[1:51:04] denomination means i was talking to this
[1:51:06] to some ministers about this we don't
[1:51:07] have a clue what denomination means
[1:51:08] because most of us have never been there
[1:51:10] only some of the older folks here have
[1:51:11] ever been in a denomination
[1:51:13] if at all
[1:51:15] but what is a denomination
[1:51:17] a denomination is where you take your
[1:51:19] thinking over god's thinking
[1:51:20] your way over god's way guess what we've
[1:51:23] got a million denominations
[1:51:25] in the world of people that are sitting
[1:51:27] in message pews and doing things their
[1:51:29] own way
[1:51:31] he says get the denomination of you get
[1:51:33] the get your own way of doing things get
[1:51:35] your own way of thinking of things your
[1:51:36] own way of approaching things your own
[1:51:38] way of resolving things get out of that
[1:51:40] he says get all the world out of you get
[1:51:43] all the belief out of you and then he
[1:51:45] says get away remember repentance says
[1:51:47] to turn around and go towards god get
[1:51:49] away from it
[1:51:50] he says and there was another which was
[1:51:52] different from us that was cut down in
[1:51:54] his young life and he was bruised and
[1:51:55] beaten wounded for our transgressions
[1:51:57] bruised for our iniquity and he was
[1:51:59] beaten until the life of him poured out
[1:52:01] like the rosin out of a tree
[1:52:03] he says and oh how the christian can
[1:52:07] soak it up
[1:52:09] oh
[1:52:09] if you're
[1:52:11] empty
[1:52:13] there's a condition here
[1:52:15] you've got to be empty
[1:52:17] can't be half full
[1:52:19] can't be three-quarters full can't be 99
[1:52:21] empty he says you've got to be empty
[1:52:24] period
[1:52:25] but you got to empty up first
[1:52:28] he says the trouble of it is we don't
[1:52:30] want to empty up but let's empty up all
[1:52:33] of our thoughts all of our creeds all of
[1:52:35] our books and soak up the holy spirit
[1:52:37] which is god in his word then it could
[1:52:39] ride the storm it could ride the seas
[1:52:41] because it was harder than any other
[1:52:43] wood there was nothing could take its
[1:52:45] place he says the parts of the ark still
[1:52:48] remain six thousand years ago and they
[1:52:49] find parts of it because it remains
[1:52:51] because it was so hardened from this
[1:52:54] cased out that kept the judgments on the
[1:52:56] outside he says the waters was the
[1:52:58] judgments
[1:52:59] he says and when we come into christ
[1:53:01] through his beaten life
[1:53:04] soak up him into our system we become so
[1:53:07] inoculated from the things of the world
[1:53:10] until they could stand the wrath then
[1:53:12] when the storms are pitching and the sea
[1:53:14] is contrary yet the little boat won't
[1:53:16] fail she slides right on through the
[1:53:19] waves to the rock of ages he says
[1:53:22] inoculated what we'd say today
[1:53:23] vaccinated listen you don't have to
[1:53:26] believe in vaccination this world but
[1:53:27] you better believe in this kind of
[1:53:28] vaccination amen he says when you get
[1:53:30] this kind of vaccination you get this
[1:53:32] kind of inoculation he says what the
[1:53:34] world and the things of the world do not
[1:53:36] affect you
[1:53:38] they can't touch you because why you're
[1:53:40] hardened to it he says you're cased
[1:53:42] there's a shell that's formed over you
[1:53:44] says you can't even drive a nail into it
[1:53:46] that's how hard it is nothing from the
[1:53:47] outside gets in because you soaked up
[1:53:49] the life of the one that was bruised and
[1:53:51] beaten for you amen amen
[1:53:56] says what
[1:53:57] it's inoculated from the things of the
[1:53:59] world guess what if you're not affected
[1:54:01] by it you don't try and fix it you don't
[1:54:03] try and get involved with it you don't
[1:54:05] worry about it because you're unaffected
[1:54:07] by it
[1:54:09] listen i don't like the politics we have
[1:54:11] today i don't like the finances we have
[1:54:13] today i don't like the way things are
[1:54:14] going but guess what it's got to get
[1:54:16] worse
[1:54:18] it's got to get worse to make us more
[1:54:19] desperate it's got to get worse to
[1:54:21] fulfill prophecy and it's got to get
[1:54:23] worse to get us on our knees to where we
[1:54:25] say this is not my home
[1:54:29] why would i try and fix a place that's
[1:54:30] not my home i'm a pilgrim and a stranger
[1:54:33] right we're seeking a city whose builder
[1:54:34] and maker is god why would i start
[1:54:36] trying to fix up satan eason
[1:54:38] i've got no time to fix this place it's
[1:54:40] done it's dead 1956 brother bram says
[1:54:42] it's over
[1:54:43] she has turned it down for the last time
[1:54:46] and then he indicted her for the second
[1:54:48] crucifixion of jesus christ the united
[1:54:50] states and i believe canada was involved
[1:54:51] in that as well all of north america
[1:54:53] it's done it's over he says the logs on
[1:54:56] the skid it's rolling down it ain't
[1:54:57] coming back amen so don't try and stop
[1:54:59] it don't try and fix it it's prophecy
[1:55:02] being fulfilled we'd literally be
[1:55:03] fighting prophecy to try and stop it
[1:55:07] watch how paul's mindset changes here
[1:55:09] after the new birth not just towards his
[1:55:11] old self but what he's achieved
[1:55:14] because sometimes that's where we get
[1:55:15] caught up is well i'm this and i'm that
[1:55:18] and i've done great things and raised
[1:55:19] great kids and had a wonderful ministry
[1:55:21] and all these different things whatever
[1:55:22] it might be that's in your head
[1:55:24] but paul says this
[1:55:27] he says not that i have attained this
[1:55:28] ideal
[1:55:30] this in the amplified or i've already
[1:55:32] been made perfect listen he talked about
[1:55:35] how perfect he was but he says look i'm
[1:55:36] no longer perfect in that way
[1:55:38] but i press on to lay hold of to grasp
[1:55:41] and make my own that for which christ
[1:55:43] jesus has laid hold of me and made me
[1:55:45] his own
[1:55:46] i do not consider brethren that i have
[1:55:48] captured and made it my own yet
[1:55:50] but one thing i do
[1:55:53] he says it is my one aspiration
[1:55:55] forgetting what lies behind and
[1:55:57] straining forward to what lies ahead
[1:56:02] sometimes we think about that looking in
[1:56:03] the past is is forgetting our old lives
[1:56:06] and mistakes and that's fine and true
[1:56:08] but if you look at verse 12 he's not
[1:56:10] talking about his old life and his
[1:56:11] mistakes he's saying all of my
[1:56:12] achievements
[1:56:14] all the good things i've done he says i
[1:56:15] forget that even
[1:56:17] he says and i press i strain my work is
[1:56:21] to go forward amen
[1:56:23] he's not letting his past growth and
[1:56:24] improvement stop him from continuing to
[1:56:26] seek future growth and improvements
[1:56:28] he's not resting on his laurels we would
[1:56:30] say he's saying there's always more for
[1:56:32] me until i leave this earth so i'm going
[1:56:34] to keep pressing towards the more
[1:56:36] i'm going to keep pushing i'm going to
[1:56:38] keep saying lord do more in my life
[1:56:41] because there's a promise for it amen
[1:56:44] listen we're satisfied we're
[1:56:46] appreciative of what god does in our
[1:56:48] lives
[1:56:48] i'm thankful he saved me and thankfully
[1:56:50] fill me with the holy ghost and
[1:56:52] thankfully he's called me to a ministry
[1:56:54] but it's not the be-all and end-all
[1:56:56] amen he wants to turn me into a fully
[1:56:58] manifested son of cr son of god he wants
[1:57:01] to turn you into one and a daughter in
[1:57:02] these different things
[1:57:04] there's a there's a furtherance in this
[1:57:05] ministry for each and every one of us
[1:57:07] amen we're not there yet but we're
[1:57:10] straining for it because we know when we
[1:57:11] believe it's there amen
[1:57:13] paul say no matter what i've done or
[1:57:15] achieved in christ i never consider that
[1:57:16] high enough to stop trying
[1:57:18] and by trying he means pressing the
[1:57:20] battle
[1:57:21] not trying to do it on his own but
[1:57:23] pressing for more and more of god to
[1:57:25] absorb more of the life if we can put it
[1:57:27] that way to empty out more so that more
[1:57:29] can be poured in amen you know
[1:57:32] what was his mindset verse 14 says i
[1:57:34] press on toward the goal to win the
[1:57:36] supreme and heavenly prize to which god
[1:57:39] and christ is calling us upward what is
[1:57:40] it the resurrection and the rapture that
[1:57:43] restores us to eternal fellowship with
[1:57:45] god amen that's the way our mind ought
[1:57:47] to work after the new birth i'm pressing
[1:57:49] towards one goal and one goal alone
[1:57:52] jonathan what's your goal for monday
[1:57:54] make a rapture tuesday make a rapture
[1:57:56] when you wake up in the morning wake a
[1:57:57] rapture when you go to bed make a
[1:57:59] rapture
[1:58:00] that's the only thing we ought to have
[1:58:02] in our mind make that rapture
[1:58:06] romans 12
[1:58:08] he says i beseech you therefore brethren
[1:58:09] by the mercies of god that you present
[1:58:12] your bodies a living sacrifice holy
[1:58:15] acceptable unto god which is your
[1:58:17] reasonable service
[1:58:18] and be not conformed to this world
[1:58:21] do you know what confirmation is
[1:58:23] you take a piece of steel
[1:58:25] you have a piece of tubing or something
[1:58:27] and you take it and you press on both
[1:58:28] sides and you bend it around
[1:58:31] that's conforming that's using force
[1:58:34] it's using force it's putting pressure
[1:58:36] on something to change it into a
[1:58:37] different shape or purpose
[1:58:39] he says that's not the way this works
[1:58:41] we're not forcing you into it
[1:58:44] he says but be ye transformed
[1:58:47] by the what renewing of your mind that
[1:58:50] you may prove what is that good and
[1:58:52] acceptable and perfect will of god good
[1:58:56] acceptable and perfect
[1:58:58] that's a high standard
[1:59:00] that's a very high standard
[1:59:02] his way his time his attitude his motive
[1:59:06] his objective
[1:59:07] right
[1:59:09] his strength
[1:59:12] that's what he says that's the prize of
[1:59:14] the high calling here that's what it
[1:59:16] looks like is when you're pushing as
[1:59:17] you're looking for this amen
[1:59:19] but he says what the renewing
[1:59:22] he didn't say by transformed by the new
[1:59:24] mind he says the renewing how can you be
[1:59:27] renewed if you didn't have it in the
[1:59:28] first place he says this is your
[1:59:30] original mind this is what you used to
[1:59:32] be before you came into sin
[1:59:34] this is the way your mind used to work
[1:59:36] before sin dropped in we're taking you
[1:59:38] back to your precinct condition
[1:59:40] we're taking you back to what you used
[1:59:42] to be
[1:59:43] that word transform is kind of like a
[1:59:44] butterfly
[1:59:47] right it used to be a caterpillar
[1:59:50] and then it goes in through a process
[1:59:51] and it wraps itself up and what comes
[1:59:53] out in no way represents what came in
[1:59:56] right a butterfly doesn't look like a
[1:59:58] caterpillar
[1:59:59] doesn't act like a caterpillar doesn't
[2:00:01] move like a caterpillar everything about
[2:00:03] a caterpillar has been erased from that
[2:00:05] butterfly he's a butterfly now
[2:00:08] and nothing of a caterpillar remains
[2:00:10] that's what a transformation is you were
[2:00:12] one thing and now you're another
[2:00:14] and he says it starts with the renewing
[2:00:16] of your mind it starts with the changing
[2:00:17] of your mind that's the start point and
[2:00:20] it never stops it's a lifetime of
[2:00:22] renewal it's a lifetime of renewal as
[2:00:24] god opens things up to you as he shows
[2:00:26] things to you as he takes things out and
[2:00:27] fills it with new things there's a
[2:00:29] constant thing that's going on but it's
[2:00:30] a new creation it's a new creature
[2:00:33] it's not a confirmation we're not
[2:00:34] bending you into another shape we're
[2:00:36] taking you and turning you into
[2:00:37] something completely different that has
[2:00:38] no attachment to what you used to be
[2:00:42] lebron says don't think i'm crazy he
[2:00:44] says i'm not if i am just let me alone
[2:00:46] i'm more happier this way than i was the
[2:00:47] other way yes sir just let me stay this
[2:00:50] way oh sure crazy to the world for those
[2:00:52] things what the world calls crazy god
[2:00:55] calls blessed he says you have to lose
[2:00:57] your mind to this world because why
[2:00:59] you're not of this world when you cross
[2:01:02] over that separating line
[2:01:04] you become fellow citizens of the
[2:01:07] kingdom of god
[2:01:08] says oh my how good is it why you become
[2:01:11] a new creature oh my change from this
[2:01:14] what you are now he says you are now the
[2:01:16] sons of god
[2:01:18] now we are sitting together in heavenly
[2:01:19] places not we will be in the millennium
[2:01:22] we are now right now we're the sons of
[2:01:24] god right now we're sitting together in
[2:01:26] the heavenly places in christ jesus not
[2:01:28] just in the church in christ jesus the
[2:01:31] resurrected lord jesus is here he is
[2:01:34] here in his power he is here in his
[2:01:36] redemption power he is here for the
[2:01:38] exodus
[2:01:40] he is here to bring every church member
[2:01:42] into fellowship with him
[2:01:44] he is here to bring every sinner no
[2:01:46] matter how low you are he is here to
[2:01:48] bring the power of his resurrection into
[2:01:50] your life and make you a new
[2:01:53] creature
[2:01:54] and then if the musicians would come
[2:01:57] he says what
[2:01:58] he's here to bring every church member
[2:02:03] it's where we start so often isn't it
[2:02:05] just a church member just coming to
[2:02:07] church
[2:02:08] mom and dad bring me to church
[2:02:10] i go to church because we always have
[2:02:12] gone to church he says buddy i'm here to
[2:02:14] turn every bring every church member
[2:02:16] into fellowship with him amen we close
[2:02:19] with one quote if we'll all stand
[2:02:21] together he says and dear god
[2:02:23] then for ourselves
[2:02:24] we will claim in this hour to be the
[2:02:26] church to call out those around the
[2:02:28] world who has come out from babylon and
[2:02:30] to be partakers of this wonderful
[2:02:32] fellowship in this last day
[2:02:34] we pray god that you'll bless our hearts
[2:02:36] in such a way
[2:02:38] he says we're truly hungry lord and
[2:02:40] emptied out from all the things of the
[2:02:42] world that we know
[2:02:44] of can you pray that prayer this morning
[2:02:48] i'm emptied out of everything
[2:02:50] he says lord we've set aside every
[2:02:52] weight that so easily beset us
[2:02:54] and now let us run this race with
[2:02:56] patience that sets before us
[2:02:58] granite father and may we be fuller
[2:03:01] stronger
[2:03:02] better christians at the end of this
[2:03:04] service than we were when we entered
[2:03:08] now listen he says may god get all the
[2:03:10] glory
[2:03:11] for we ask it in jesus name amen
[2:03:15] and then next service we're going to
[2:03:16] talk about a pouring in
[2:03:18] but before there can be a pouring in
[2:03:19] there's got to be an empty nowaday man
[2:03:23] like i said that's
[2:03:24] it's a start point
[2:03:26] you give up what you know to give up
[2:03:28] you let go of what you know to let go
[2:03:31] but we're in a body that is completely
[2:03:33] identity with god
[2:03:34] and so it's a day in and a day out god's
[2:03:36] cutting things away and sometimes it's
[2:03:38] messy
[2:03:40] sometimes it takes a long time to heal
[2:03:43] sometimes it takes to fill up time to
[2:03:45] fill up doesn't it
[2:03:47] but if you empty out
[2:03:49] he'll fill
[2:03:51] and guess what it's him that's going to
[2:03:52] do the emptying out anyways all he's
[2:03:54] saying is surrender it let it go
[2:03:57] let it go whatever you're holding on to
[2:03:58] the enjoyment the
[2:04:00] the the dopamine rush you know what
[2:04:02] dopamine does makes you feel good
[2:04:05] you get addicted to something and
[2:04:06] dopamine is what comes out whether it's
[2:04:08] fast cars whether it's riding your bike
[2:04:10] quickly whether it's airsoft whether
[2:04:12] it's sports
[2:04:14] what you get a rush from it
[2:04:16] so many times you can't let go of the
[2:04:17] rush
[2:04:18] you can't let go the good feeling that
[2:04:19] comes with it he says you got to let go
[2:04:21] of that
[2:04:22] you got to let go the thing that makes
[2:04:23] you feel great because i've got
[2:04:25] something so much higher than that
[2:04:26] something that lasts
[2:04:29] right that's the fruit of the holy
[2:04:30] spirit it lasts it's not just a high
[2:04:33] every now and again but it's something
[2:04:35] that's available to us constantly day in
[2:04:37] and day out
[2:04:38] you don't have to pay money for it
[2:04:40] you don't have to go somewhere to get it
[2:04:42] you can have it with you every day of
[2:04:43] your life amen
[2:04:45] you gotta empty out though so he can
[2:04:47] pour it
[2:04:48] let's bow our heads
[2:04:50] lord jesus
[2:04:52] lord you called us to walk a straight
[2:04:54] and narrow way
[2:04:56] the lord we rest on the fact that you
[2:04:58] called us to it
[2:05:00] or that you pricked our hearts lord that
[2:05:02] our consciences
[2:05:03] lord they couldn't stay in the condition
[2:05:05] they were in after you started calling
[2:05:06] us
[2:05:07] and lord we emptied out i believe that
[2:05:10] day that you called us
[2:05:11] but lord we need to empty out more and
[2:05:13] more
[2:05:14] lord if we want more of you then more of
[2:05:16] us has to leave or more of the world has
[2:05:18] to leave more of satan's strongholds
[2:05:20] have to be torn down in our lives lord
[2:05:21] god
[2:05:22] and lord so we ask in these just few
[2:05:24] moments
[2:05:25] lord that as we would dwell in your
[2:05:26] presence orders we would sing songs of
[2:05:28] worship and praise
[2:05:30] lord that we'd look into our lives
[2:05:32] lord and we'd see where we need to empty
[2:05:34] out
[2:05:35] lord where we need to let go
[2:05:37] lord where we need to relax
[2:05:39] lord where we need to rest and just
[2:05:40] trust that the pouring in will follow
[2:05:42] the emptying out for each and every one
[2:05:44] of us
[2:05:45] lord where we need healing lord we pray
[2:05:47] your grace this morning lord where we
[2:05:49] need deliverance we pray the power of
[2:05:50] your holy spirit to come down and touch
[2:05:52] each one
[2:05:54] lord where we need resolution
[2:05:56] lord we pray that you would be the
[2:05:58] mighty conqueror
[2:06:00] lord that you would be the lord the
[2:06:01] negotiator
[2:06:03] lord that you would sort all things out
[2:06:05] according to your perfect will and
[2:06:06] purpose if we'll trust you amen lord
[2:06:08] just bless your people now we pray in
[2:06:10] jesus christ's name we ask it
