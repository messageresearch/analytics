might seem small in the eyes of man but in the eyes of God it's great if he finds faith in this assembly amen God's been looking for since the fall of man he's been looking for faith he's looking for those that believe him and not just believe literally smoking words but believe revelation because God deals with us by faith by grace through faith spiritual revelation a man son and he'll do that tonight oh but our brother is going to speak yes but what God reveals will be spiritual in your heart a man that him that Anthony R not here what our brother Stephen is going to minister tonight but let it that has an ear hear what the Spirit is going to say amen and the Spirit is going to speak into your heart and your soul as the brother ministers verbally God is going to minister spiritually he had taken what what is being said and he's going to bring it down to faith revelation understanding maturity in your soul by grace as why it's written B therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect and that's not sinless perfection that is maturity perfect maturity when it comes to the water to believe God to believe the plan and the purpose of God a man so I pray that you have an ear not ears by your ears you will hear our brother Stephen but I trust by the ear of the soul you will hear the Holy Ghost speaking through our brother Stephen a man that's the important thing there are too many that are going by the letter of the word and the literal smokin word but not despair a revelation of the word a man so he trust will get what God is saved through our brother tonight and we thank the Lord for bringing our brother Stephen coffee this way again and I was surprised to learn that it's been over a year since he's been here I believe it was two we're a year over a year here in July of this year a year and I thought it was just a few months ago that he was here but God blessed us through his ministry then so let's believe that God is going to bless us through our brothers ministry again it's a younger generation rising on the scene but again remembering what the prophets said concerning the younger ministers he said take the message on to the coming of the Lord the revelation of the coming the greater understanding of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ for the bride in the resurrection and in the rapture praise the Lord so let's believe that the ministry that God has brought us tonight is one of those ministries ordained to fill the prophets shoes he said you are deemed to fill my shoes and brother Neville shoes that's a tall order but again if we just let go and and turn ourselves over to the Lord he is able to do it by the grace of God it is not the manifestation of the of the gift of discernment as the prophet of God used it know that God still discerns by his word a man through the preaching and teaching of his word you discern the thoughts and intents of your heart and and and then the anointing will bring for the word a man to collect that that in your heart or to help you in your heart by the grace of God to give you understanding in your soul by the grace of God that's how God works that's how God deals with man by grace through faith spiritual revelation your soul so as the word goes we pray that we'll have spiritual revelation spiritual understanding of what God is saying and what God wants me to know what God wants you to know and we're in goddess is endeavoring to correct you or to correct me and to get us to get us to line up or to do as the Prophet said in the last vision of the bride when he screamed out stay in line a man stay in line because what that was the last vision he had of the right and that was the last message to the bride in the vision screaming stay in line because because I believe that has to be the the essence of any ministry any message today when we see everything getting so out of line we need to minister stay in line amen and to use the whip of the word to align the people up with with the word by grace so god bless our brother Stephen thank God for bringing him and no doubt he has ministered to congregations much larger than this one but again we pray the grace of God that the break family will be able to make it on Saturday and Sunday and our brother Karsan is working tonight and sister Shara and his wife is in central Newfoundland and and others as well so we pray the grace our brother Matthew of course and his family in the United States but they will be back on Monday so I know brother Macondo is on call in the hospital in Bureau so pray the grace of God to each one that's that's not with us tonight our brother Joshua sister Lily and we pray God grab bless those on line a man oh praise the Lord he was hiding between sister brother sister Macondo and sisters he had brother Joshua a man sitting with our brother David a man Lord bless you so God the Lord bless each and every one and so be in prayer for the services tonight being prayer for the services tomorrow night and also again again on on Sunday morning amen and our fellowship with our brother so we look forward to that so let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible and believe and I'll remind you again that way received in the mail shortly ago these books so there's again it's just for one one book for our family not for everybody here but for a family or for a household and so we received the three or four copies four or five copies of the messenger look again printed by believers International and this is just photos of brother Branham from the beginning of his life to the calling home of the Prophet in 1965 and of course also the generation book as extra copies outside to those who do not have any so the Lord bless you and make it a blessing to you amen by the grace of God so let's sing only believe all things are possible only believe as our brother Steven comes and God bless our brother and thank the Lord that he was able to make it up this way again amen let's sing it Oh baby Oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh today man praise the Lord yeah do you believe this evening yeah that's the Eagles favorite song still true and don't think that it's changed just because brother and I'm left I believe it still it's his favorite song that's right again we believe praise the Lord yeah well god bless you this evening you can have your seats thank you musicians that'll be all just wanted to greet you and thank you all for coming this evening and it's a privilege to be here and always exciting to be in Newfoundland be back on the rock but it's a great privilege and honour for me to be invited here I really I really feel that it's a it's a privilege to be here and to be asked to come and to speak that means a lot and I don't consider myself to be a great speaker but if the lord puts something on your heart to do you have to do it so just excited to be here and thankful for the opportunity to come and speak so thank you for the jail for that hope we can be a blessing to somebody in some small way and it's good to see each and every one of you it's a quick trip it's only I got here last night I have to leave Monday morning but hopefully we'll get the fellowship with everybody and get to see you all and looking forward to the services to come it's a given to be in church on Sunday the scripture says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together so you should come to church on Sunday and it's a privilege to be on Church and Saturday and it's it's exciting to be on Church and Friday so happy to be here the tonight and hope everybody's uh come expecting to hear from the Lord and I doubt any of you have come expecting to hear from for the Steve but you've come expecting to hear from the Lord because I know that he can speak to you and I have confidence and his ability to do so I don't come with any any confidence myself whatsoever and you know I speak but the Gerald said speaking to or spoken to bigger congregations who I have but that means diddly-squat to me how big the congregation is it really really means absolutely nothing to me whatsoever I have confidence in the Lord's ability to speak to somebody through me being here because I know that he led me here and I'm not gonna be here you know I had I had the opportunity to be other places this weekend but I felt led to be here and I'm happy to be here and I'm excited and I know because he led me here and we're preaching the Word of God in his name I know that he can speak to somebody and it's not up to me who he speaks to or in what manner or what I could speak on it's up to him then he presses upon my heart what to say and I I say it with all confidence and I know that he'll he'll do the work in the people yeah so I just pray and ask you that you come expecting and to pull on the word of God and to expect to receive something from his presence being here yeah because we're two or three gathered in his name he shall be there so he's here we know he's here but it's the attitude by which you submit yourself into his presence by the Word of God going forth that you can receive from them it's the attitude that you present yourself to him yeah yeah yeah and you know what if I say something wrong I'm just I'm still a human being I can say things wrong you know and it's never an intention to do so but if I do if I say something against what the pastor says and just spit it out like a cherry seed and let's come back on the basis of the word always bring it back to the basis of the word and I just ask that you'd you'd expect and just pray that the Lord would speak to you and speak to your hearts and again itself a privilege to be here I'm very excited and beautiful weather for October and I was bracing myself for the worst but it's beautiful and Newfoundland is the prettiest place on the face of the earth when it's when it's nice so if you would let's stand to our feet and read a scripture just before we begin let's turn to Luke chapter 21 Luke chapter 21 and let's start at verse 25 now this this weekend I have a few things on my heart I'm not sure exactly which way the Lord will go with them but this evening I just wanted to lay a little groundwork of what I had what I had in my heart to say in I guess it was March believe it was March I was supposed to come and it just the Lord worked it out to where I couldn't make it and I had an illness there and I just couldn't make it and I felt something on my heart to speak then so I felt directly led to say it and I was just confused as to why the Lord would allow it to work out so that I couldn't go or come here and speak it but it never left me and I and I thought of this subject and it's been on my heart since that time so it's for somebody and in you know I don't say things in for a particular reason to speak into somebody because I think they need to hear I speak what the Lord puts on my heart to say and that's it and I had I've had I have had this on my heart since March or February and March of this year so it's a long time to have the burden on your heart so I hope it's a blessing to you and I just want to lay a little groundwork this evening and we can take it one step further tomorrow night with the Lord's help and then we can summon up on Sunday the good Lord willing Luke chapter 21 and verse 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the Stars and upon the earth distress of Nations with perplexity and we know there's a lot of perplexity with the distress of nations we there's a lot of foreign policy that simply is is they don't know how to figure out this perplexity among nations the sea and the waves roaring in 22:26 men's hearts failing them for fear and looking after the things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your hands your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh now let's turn one place proverbs chapter 29 proverbs chapter 29 and verse 25 the Lord proverbs chapter 29 and verse 25 9 I think it's interesting that the book of Proverbs the wisest the the the the wisdom that we can draw from from the wisest man that ever Dawn the face of the earth and yet he was the man who could never fully conquer himself and he allowed his wives to turn his heart from from the Lord to other things and yet he we draw from the wisdom from a man who could never conquer himself I think that's fascinating that the Lord would show us through that that we're still human beings proverbs chapter 29 verse 25 the fear of man bringeth the snare now according to the wording in the Hebrew that says the fear of man so it's the fear of a man you'd fear a man you could fear what man could do into you the fear of man bringeth a snare but whoso put us put his trust in the Lord shall be safe that's pretty gracious Heavenly Father we thank you so much Lord for this opportunity to come into your house to hear and to speak the Word of God Lord we know that faith coming by the Word of God and hearing the Word of God Lord I pray that you'd speak tonight that you would take control of everything in this building Lord every soul that you just capture them with your presence Lord and that you'd give us something that would take this one step further Lord we never we know that we're just regular human beings that's business there's no one thing that would fix all except it be your presence Lord that we could step into your presence and receive from you Lord and oh all in the way that you could speak to us only in the way that you know that we have need of because you are the only one who genuinely knows what we struggle with this evening what we are going through Lord what we will go through tomorrow you are the only one who knows genuinely what that what that is man so I pray this evening Lord that you that I'd move myself out of the way that you could come and speak to us little granite father that your presence would have preeminence remove every spirit every hindrance to that and in your glorious name do we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you can have your seats which water is mine are they both mine either one I'll take the one I'm all right now we see here just to get directly into the word and I don't intend to be long with this tonight famous first words of a preacher but I'll speak until the Holy Spirit is finished with you so it's not really up to me but uh I'll have mercy upon you and we see here in in proverbs chapter 29 the the Hebrew word is Shara da which means fear anxiety and trembling the fear of man bringeth the snare so it's the fear that you would have towards some something someone that brings a snare around that man but he says but whoso putteth his trust and the Lord shall be safe he'll be safe from the snare so there is a snare and there will be fear that can hinder the man from from falling from trusting the Lord that would allow him to fall into the snare but there's merely a redirecting of your of your of your being into the trust of the Lord and put your trust in the Lord and you'll be safe from the snare it doesn't mean that the snare will not be there or the enemy will not be there to try to put you into the snare this simply means that you will be safe from the snake and then in Luke chapter 21 we see that men's hearts failing them for fear and we know that the heart of a man I'd like to get into this a little bit more tomorrow night the heart of a man is the innermost innermost being it's the the secret intentions of a man it's those things that are that are the most deep within him the secret desires of his heart that's that's the the the the most inner part of a human being is his heart and it said that man's hearts would be failing them they'd simply have no strength they'd have no ability to do anything because they'd be failing because of fear it would be fear that would hold them back and I was thinking just on the way up and on the plane and I had picked up a book that I thought was interesting in the bookstore and it was called the the world order by Henry Kissinger and we know that Kissinger was deeply involved with the Chinese and back in the day it was an American politician and the book said world order and I always flip to the first page and just start reading if it's interesting Abhaya and immediately and in the the the second page he started talking about how Rome fell because there how Rome fell and then how they rose in in church power and that really caught my attention so I bought the book and I was reading it and he was going back over the history of how the the mankind had developed political theories and how political theories had shaped the world that we now live in and he was he was explaining how in in 446 I believe it was the Roman Empire fell and what what happened is is that the the civil disputes between them they simply couldn't operate anymore because of the conflict between people and fear had gotten inside of the people and they started to bicker back and forth and then it fell and it was the same spirit that we know that rose to papal Rome so his pagan Rome that fell but it was the same spirit that brought back up papal Rome and then he began to explain that Christianity and Christendom offered the people's stability where the political regime could not so he said they they went to the church simply out of fear because of the chaos that was ensuing because of no political law so he said out of fear people went to the church because they offered the stability and people needed just to feel like they were safe and under some kind of law that would keep them from the people around them now brother branham said in expectation in 1961 he says now I want to take the subject of expectation now before you can have expectation there must be faith to accompany the expectation and he says there's only two elements in the world that controls the world tonight and that's fear or faith I find that to be fascinating that there's only two two things that controls modern the modern world so all that you see all the industry that you see all the business that you conduct all of the things that that though that the world has done for themselves there's only two things that controls that that's faith or fear the Paul and I were talking today people they understand how they under they have the technology to send a drone to see Pluto and then retrieve the pictures back from it they have the understanding of the molecules of the science of the physics to send a little hunk of metal and wires to take pictures of a planet so far away and send it back and yet they don't even know how thoughts come and go out of their mind they don't even know they don't even understand what the the heart really is they don't understand their their minds and how the mind relates to the body and how the spiritual matters work they don't understand that yet they know everything else and they know how to build so many things but they can't even understand themselves completely and I think with that accompanies of fear of not being able to understand themselves so what they do is they create a culture that they can hide themselves in so they create divergence from the fear that drives them to do what they do so they have TV they have entertainment they have a beauty things to increase the beauty of themselves they have fatten a fashion they have all kinds of things that diverts the fear that they have within themselves because they have they don't know they have no order within themselves because they don't understand themselves it's a fear that drives a deep within a man and I think what that comes from is that thirst that a man was created with because everybody in this room is the same although we're different we have different backgrounds we were raised differently in our order in and in our creation we are the same we each have a body we have a spirit we each have a soul so in that we are all driven by that thirst that God created in a man man to look for something to need a God to need something and when they can't find that they fear and so men's hearts fail them because of that fear he says Russia is trying to get everybody to fear them they want everybody to fear them because they need that respect they need that honor they need to feel like they are in control and we're trying to get everybody to have faith in God that's the difference the two element controls all nations controls all people controls all churches controls all individuals is either fear faith I think the interesting thing is is because that we all are the same is because we all are we all do have a soul and a spirit and a body we are all affected by the enemy in the same way so we all have a mind we all have a heart and Satan's way into a man is through his mind and that never changes throughout any walk in a believers life so we know that that sanctification is is here for a reason from the time we were birthed until we receive a rapture there's a reason that is and the enemy works through us in the same way so even though you you are birthed into Christ and you have a walk with God no matter how old you are how young you are or where you are on that walk the enemy still has the same Avenue into your being so no matter how spiritually strong you are or how spiritually weak you are how little your faith is or how big your faith is Satan still has the same Avenue into your spirit realm a man has a body in the spirit and a soul and the soul is either it's it's that part of God that was eternal and hopefully we can get into that there's gonna be a lot that we're gonna get into hopefully and I never could understand why how a man and a woman could be one flesh and how they operate is one flesh because they're separate beings and that was always a real mystery to me until God gives us the revelation that we are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh that's why it says this this man and this woman are now bone of your bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh you're one being is because Christ in the beginning was that that eternal being but the bride just like it was in the type in the garden the bride was taken from his side he was taken from the very bone and flesh of Adam and Eve was created within the very molecules and material that Adam was created with so all of the attributes of God was poured into Christ and in Christ is a direct he is God and the bride was taken directly from him so you are what you are when you are birthed into Christ you you are what you are because you are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone because it's that part of you that was foreordained to be in you that's sealed into you when you are birthed into Christ that is his very nature and that is that is either the it's either sealed into you or it's not you're either birthed or you're not that can never be tapped into once you are sealed into Christ that seal can never be broken but now the Spirit is the nature of the soul so we know that the Spirit is a direct correspondence to what is in the soul of a fruit tree will bear the fruit that is in the nature of that seed isn't that right this is very familiar to us all so if you're if you're an orange you will bear an orange for an apple you're barren or an apple it can't be either/or so that what's in the seed will be produced in the fruit and what is in the in the seed of the believer it will be produced on the outside but the flesh is still the same because the flesh is never born again so the spirit is is is the quickening power it's it's um it's the spirit that quickeneth and it's the spirit that gives life it's the flesh that is dead that's John 6:63 so it's the spirit that quickens it's that it's the dynamics to the mechanics which is the body which is the five senses which is how we operate in this world but the body cannot operate until it has the spirit to quicken it but the Spirit is the nature of the soul so there is a spirit realm that all of us have and it is all the same it is simply the nature of the soul so it is that part of you that that soul that has made a new creature in Christ and when you are birthed into Christ it is that which bubbles up from the inside out not from the outside in now you're not simply picking up the the rulebook and applying it it comes from the inside out and it is Christ who does the work in you because you are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh but now Satan has a way into a man just like God has a way into a man God chose the heart and Satan chose the mind so we have the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind so the mind is where those seeds start the mind is where the Satan attacks the most and it is in the mind that we dwell the most it is the thoughts it's the intentions it's it's everything that we go about our days through the mind but now there's five avenues into the spirit realm and that's reason that's conscience that's memory it's and all the rest of them my memory fails and it's memory and it's conscience and if you take all five of those and you look at those those are the avenues that Satan can use into the spirit realm so that never changes so you wonder why why you're a believer you've been in the message for so long and you're struggling with things and Joanne why am I even struggling with that it's because Satan has the same avenue that he did when you were first birthed into Christ he still has to say it the same way he still tries to get you the same way yet he learns throughout all of it how to get to you and he plans and he prods and he under the--under he learns you and he probes at you and then he understands how to do that but that is only allowed by God what he can do to you but it's still the same memory that this is still the same Avenue so uh you you you you know you're a believer in Christ and you'reyou're going down the someone will struggle with something and someone will hurt you and and you have a memory of that and it just affects you so much and then 30 years later someone will say something to you and all of a sudden that memory is brought back of what that person did and then all of a sudden Satan has now has an Avenue into your spirit realm and then you begin to imagine all kinds of things and you and you cook up all these things in your mind simply because Satan had that Avenue that memory that he used into your mind but the memory was flesh because you you remember what it's like to feel something a soldier goes through PTSD a post-traumatic distress disorder if it's a foggy day and the bombs were going all around him and he experienced that horrible war scene and it was foggy the next time he goes to a place that is foggy he'll get really scared and fearful and he'll get distressed because it was foggy that's memory so that's simply the flesh said that that engrained into his body but yet it was the spirit realm and Satan that went into his memory and pulled that out and prodded and prodded at him through his spirit realm so you see Satan has these spirit these avenues into your mind that are always there and they never leave you and you can see that it's the same way in in Scripture that David was a man after God's own heart and all that he had accomplished in Christ all that he had accomplished for God and yet at the end of his days he was still struggling with different things because Satan still has the same Avenue into you and when you're old is when you're young is when you're in the middle middle age but brother Branham says now he brings it back to 2 there's so many things that goes on in the world and so many things that we we worry about so many things that we think about yet brother Branham he brings it back to the simplicity of God because God is not simple yet he wraps himself in simplicity and he hides himself in simplicity God is not a simple God he's extremely complex far more than we could ever understand yet he hides himself and wraps himself and simplicity brother venom he brings it back to something simple and he says it's either fear or faith and I think therein lies the struggle because it's either fear or faith that will drive you and if that be so then it is it is the the root of it will be fear that Satan will try to get you to respond to something a fear of a memory happening again fear of an imagination that you're cooking up in your mind and anxiety a depression from something that happened in the past will all be the root of faith of fear so I guess the you can understand the importance of it then if everything is ran by either faith or fear then what you're going through you must trace it back to the very root of it to see what is going on is it here is it faith that really drives me is it faith and I'm operating today or is it fear brother Branham said in 1953 in Israel in the church part 1 he says now the first place we want to find out is why is is the greatest thing that I've found among Christian people throughout the entire world has been a fear the greatest thing out of all the people in in and all of the world that he went and all of the Christians that he spoke to and that he dealt with and that he prayed for he said the greatest thing among them is fear and there you can see the greatest trick of the devil is to get fear into the people to get them to fear something because fear will hold you back and withdraw you from something fear it's it sterilizers courage and Vince in faith and bravery to accomplish something for God it keeps you and it holds you back he said the greatest thing is fear among the Christian world they're always afraid and with a little sickness strikes they're afraid many I wonder sometimes and now I'm along with you but now I'm trying to do tonight and then this week to come is to try to drive that fear away he says I can't I can't do anything with you until first I Drive the fear away so in other words I can't preach to your faith I cannot build your faith until first fear is driven from you so he says you want to grow you want these great things you want algebra and I've got to drive the fear away and teach you the ABCs so that you can add to your faith and build from there but first I've got to get the fear out I think at any point in time Satan tries to get fear back into a believer because he still has that Avenue imagination reason conscience memory he still has those avenues that he attacks the believer every day and the thing about this this is not some grand scheme or anything this happened every single day in the life of a believer you know what I'm speaking about this is not some obscure theology this comes down to everyday living for the believer that's what that's what burdens me the most is to is to understand Lord where is my place today because you're not promised tomorrow sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof but what do you want me to do today what is my job today what could you accomplish in me today I don't have tomorrow and I can't worry about what happened yesterday what do you want me to do today and if that be the case then wouldn't the enemy try to be there ever so much and he try to bring you to a place where you're not focused on him but your focus on everything that everything the busyness the anxiety the stress the problems our circumstance he says what I'm trying to do is drive out all of the fear and then I'm gonna bring faith in this word fear in the Greek it's full boughs where we get our word phobia maybe a fear of all kinds of things is a fear of all kinds of things I don't have time to get into them the word in the Greek it means fear means terror but it also means reverence so there's a it's the same word in the Greek all throughout the scripture in many places it talks about the the fear of God and then it talks about fear and it's many times the same word just use in a different context so we'd say we use the word fear in the same contact the same word in many ways to denote a different meaning so we'd say we don't really use the word in modern days I fear the president in in there in the in the way that I would respect the president we don't say that we say well you have a respect for the president we have reverence for the pen the president but in the scripture it is the same word and it is almost used in the same way there's different variances in different places and I like the brick an get into that but it's the same word that is used when it says do not fear as when it says fear God in first John 4:18 it says there is no fear in love phobos in Romans 8:14 15 it says who we have not received the bondage again to fear terror reverence and fear we haven't received the spirit of fear so then we know that there is a spirit that accompanies fear and we know that there in order for it to have life it has to have a spirit behind it so there is a spirit of fear that will anoint somebody and that is the very spirit that tries to get through those avenues of the mind in second Timothy 1:17 when Paul was exhorting Timothy this Adalia is the Greek word that means to timidity and fear and cowardice this says in 2nd Timothy 1 set verse 7 and says we do not have the spirit of fear but we have the spirit of love and empower and of a sound mind so we know that we're given a spirit not of this we're given a spirit of this now when he was saying that to Timothy Paul was saying to him I have not given you the the the spirit the attitude in your ministry to fear God has not given you that and he says when you preach preach with diligent don't be ashamed of your testimony just don't let anybody despise your youth speak with with all assurance and diligence preach just fervently from your heart just don't be afraid of it and then he didn't say you will not have you will not be fearful because Timothy would be fearful because he's a regular human being because Paul knew what it was to be fearful about something he lived in a fear and almost a dread in a in a an anxiety and a depression all of the time for what he did to the to the believers you don't think that Satan would not have used the same tactic that he used today to the Apostle Paul say to jump on his shoulder buy an avenue of memory in today the spirit round and say but look what you did to those people back there and he lived with that anxiety of what what what could I do for the Lord because I did that all that all the time he lived with the fear then in the depression of that all the time but you never hear him speak about it in in the in the way that God could never deliver him from that so he didn't say to Timothy you won't fear you won't experience anxiety you won't fear depression you won't experience depression it's not that you won't experience fear but he says God hasn't given you the spirit of fear because he's giving you this spirit the power of love and of a sound mind that word sound lines means self-control it's the same word that Titus used to say it all of your young men live with self-control let your let your older women control themselves and teach the younger women how to live let your young women live in self-control you can you can use self-control yourself by bringing your spirit and your itself subject to the Word of God into the spirit of God he says he's given us that spirit not the spirit of fear Phobos it's the same word in the Hebrew it's Sharda and Yara it means fear and trembling and anxiety a fright it also means absolute means a reverence that is given to something and all those different ways of spelling the word the meaning is the same you can use it in a sentence differently linguistically but it's the same word it's the same meaning it's fear it's an apprehension it's an anxiety it's a trembling of something it holds you back from something but the venom said fear does nothing for you he says faith can deliver you fear does nothing for you what I'd like to focus on is the wrong kind of fear this evening because in in in Hebrews what I'd like to bring out and focus on tomorrow night is the fear of God because Paul said fear bless the promise that God has given you would be of none effect so he said fear and all in all in the Old Testament and in the New Testament it said fear God you must fear the Lord Solomon the wisest of my among men he said here the whole conclusion of the matter fear God and keep his Commandments it's the same word the scripture says that Noah feared the Lord and was moved with this fear he was moved with fear and by faith he accomplished what he did why would the Lord tell us not to fear and tell us to rid out fear and why would the prophet of God say I can bring you no further until fear is gone in faith and then the Lord tell us fear God and Genesis chapter 20 we see the story of Abraham when he was going down to Egypt and he was not supposed to be there and he went he was believed this is the same the same circumstance and he went down to Egypt and it was it was the time when Sarah was turned back to her young young age so I'm assuming that he was also turned back to a young age because he obviously had some jealousy going on there because she was obviously very pretty because the Pharaoh wanted wanted so for his wife so he knew what he you know just like every guy experienced he's probably a little jealous you know because he was obviously very pretty lady and he said he said he was cooking up things in his mind and you know Satan hates the same enemy he probably went through the spirit realm in some form or fashion through imagination and he just was just getting down into Abraham because they didn't have the Holy Ghost he didn't have the Holy Ghost so he had to rely on the Holy Spirit Christ to come to him and to deliver him from that he didn't have that bubbling up from within set within it so the Satan problem is probably looking down and saying well you know what she's a pretty girl man you're you know these are Egyptians these are crazy guys and you can just imagine now what he was thinking and what was going on and he said he said to Sarah it's telling you my sister and then we can just come in and get out we can go and visit the pyramids and everything and then we can leave and so he said that and it doesn't say what was driving Abraham to say that it simply says Abraham told Sarah tell him you're my sister so the the Pharaoh obviously you know she was a pretty a pretty woman and he had nothing hindering them so he said well I'd like to marry her so he only said can I do this and the Abraham was okay with it and everything like that then we know the story the Lord comes down to the Pharaoh and and says you touch her you're a dead man he said Lord you know the integrity of your heart in it and he said I do know the integrity of her heart that's why I've saved you from this but he says that's my profitable that's my profit so I want you to go to him and pray for him and have not have him pray for you and then given a good dude dude just send him on his way but don't touch that woman so and it was interesting as we were looking today I was looking today and he never told Sarah that Abraham did this he never went to Sarah and said listen I didn't know what was going on your husband told me that you were his sister I'm sorry he didn't do that he went to Sarah and said go back to your brother he didn't tell her tell Sarah what was going on so Sarah was probably completely oblivious to what was going on because she was probably somewhere else being prepared as a bride would be in that day so Sarah wasn't even in the equation at this point he went back to Sarah and said can I give you back to your brother and she didn't even know what was going on in Abraham he said it was out of fear the what you could do to me that I did this so you can see that it was the fear of man that brings a snare and it was that fear that that that was coaxing up inside of Abraham that Ford that had made him be brought into the snare so it was it was a perfect example of what can happen when you misplace your trust when you misplace your your your reverence when your fear is misplaced and he placed his fear in man and what in that what the man could do to him and then by that he led himself directly into a snare and all of this happened and he was out completely out of the will of God in doing that but a believer is never out of the will of God so he had him praying and and we can see now what what what uh what what happens when a man fears and I know for beyond the shadow of a doubt that you could look back in your own lives and you could see there was fear that I did that by it was fear that I did not do that by and you can see in your own life how you have been moved by fear to do the things that you have done or did not do it was either fear that held you back from something it was fear that made you react to something it's either one of the other fear or faith that moves a man that that constrains him to do what he does it either comes to back to one root either faith or fear for the random set in 1951 he says Jesus always said fear not do not fear don't fear don't do that if you do then God can't work with you if you fear God cannot work with you what a horrible place it would be to be in a spot where God could not work with you it was David's greatest fear to be out of the presence of God when all that happened with Bathsheba and he went and in Psalms 51 he says Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from me don't don't don't let me out of your presence Lord and he feared being out of the presence of God you can fear being out of that being being out of it and he was he was so needful of the presence of God in his life as are we and he was fearful to the point that he would ever be in a spot where he wouldn't be in the presence of God it constrained him to do what he did and he said brother Branham said yet God cannot deal with you if you have fear in your life if you are being constrained to do something or are being held back by a deep deep-seated fear that you just can't you can't control you don't know where it comes from and you can't operate effectively because God cannot operate through you because you're being held back by fear 19:52 God testifying of his gifts he says so don't fear fears of the devil everything Jesus would say fear not fear not constantly fear not fear not always fear not now God don't want you to fear he wants you to believe so every one of you believe in one Accord one Accord every one of you believe in one of Accord and do not fear you'd see him in the prayer line and he he'd be going and he'd stop in person he said now don't fear they said don't fear go go now and fear not say go believing don't fear and the people would come and they'd be so scared and they'd even be afraid of the presence that was anointing brother Branham and they'd be scared to get into that presence instead don't fear that don't be scared of that then one so even that even the the the human the humanity of these people that were being prayed for they were just so caught up in a fear within himself that they could not go forward but the Branham had to address the fear before they could go forward and I believe it behold it behooves every believer to examine themselves and say Lord cast out all the fear that is in my life so that I can go forward if you feel like you're in a point where you can't go forward then you have to to get to a place with God so that he can move out the fear and then place the faith in there because there cannot be something sealing the soul at the same time there cannot be faith and fear at the same time he said have you ever seen a completely black bird and a completely white bird at the same time there's nothing like that every resina a drunk sober man there can't be faith and fear at the same time he says that either one or the other so if you are a born-again Holy Ghost filled believer and you have been sealed into Christ and there was nothing that could take you from his hand but it could be Satan going through the spirit realm just imputing fear through a memory through an imagination through conscience so your reasoning Bible says not lean not to your own understanding so by the spirit realm Satan tries to get into you and he tries to develop a fear in your spirit realm that will affect every aspect of your life and hinder you and drive you to a spot where you cannot move forward with God and it is only until he gets the fear out of you can he begin to build the faith that he needs to bring you forward so wouldn't it be true then that you cannot have the rapturing faith there that you need to rapture out of here until the faith be removed he said I can't God can't do anything with you and if you fear you say there's a point there where God cannot move you forward you couldn't heal you when there was fear there like you if you would to turn through Matthew chapter 14 I'd like to just bring it down into everyday living into something you know something that's really hits home with a believer because it's in here that you you're encouraged that you develop the by the hearing of the word you develop the armor that you need you put on the armor you you you receive from God in a way that you can be encouraged and strengthened but it's out there that you go through the battle and it's an everyday living it's in everything that you subject yourself to it's in the everyday things that you feed on that's how you will fight the battle that's how you either grow or you won't grow Matthew chapter 14 chapter 20 start at verse 3 and I'd like to read this together it's a very familiar passage of Scripture but I just want you to see what happens 23 and when they had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone Jesus was always trying to get alone now speaking the other night and just to pause just from this for a second God can never fully deal with a believer until he's alone he never really could get Abraham's attention in the way that he needed to do it until he was alone and he never can really deal with a believer until he's alone it's not you being birthed into the church are you being birthed into the message it's you being birthed into Christ it's God looking down and in you're his focus and it's you looking back up and receiving from him individually in crisis mystery of God revealed he says he doesn't deal with groups of people he deals with the individual it's it's you and Christ alone that you walk daily it's not you and your family are you and this and and you and the church that helped you get through it's you in Christ that you overcome with that's that's the way it's got to be and he cannot effectively deal with you until you're alone that's why you have to get alone with God and Jesus was alone and the evening was come but the ship was now the ship the disciples were fishing and they were off doing things at verse 24 but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary this is a sea of gallilee those of you have been to the Sea of Galilee there's no more peaceful body of water I've ever seen in my life in the Sea of Galilee unless the wind comes down from the certain area if it cycles through and the wind currents come down it comes through the valley and the Golan Heights and the other in the scene if this comes down it's just and just creates a crazy place hurricane-force winds all of a sudden and this is what happened for his 25 and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear now that word in the fear that the denotation and the Greek it doesn't mean that they were driven with fear or anything like that they just means they they didn't know what it was they were timid they were they were concerned because they didn't understand what that was so he says but 27 but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid so just to get to the context of the situation this is just an everyday event they were going through the storm they were there you know they were trying to do what they could to get the ship from tossing in the waves and and being wrecked and and why on earth Jesus would come to them walking on water I still don't know why would he walk on water what's the point and I've always wondered did he sway with the waves or was it calm where he stood I'm gonna ask him that when I get on the other side was he swaying there you know and you know could they hear him from the waves or what was it like you know you can imagine how a peculiar this situation is in modern in modern time to it to a God who defeated death this is nothing someone said to me the other day do you really I was talking to some unbeliever and he said do you really believe that you know Jonah was swallowed by a fish I said are you kidding me I said to a guy who defeated death and it's proven historically that there's he was not in his grave and you're saying a fish is small stuff compared to a man who could defeat death and rise again and what a peculiar situation this would be and yet there is always a particular reason as to why something is in Scripture and to why something happened in Christ's life and here he was and he was calling out to the disciples and they were they were crying they were Oh curious just out of curiosity and here oh right what is what is this you know what's going on here and you could be probably talking and they probably weren't saying much on the boat because they didn't know what was going on and then Jesus says and they hear the familiar voice and they understand now who it is that's Jesus and he says fear be of good cheer it is I be not afraid be of good cheer there in a storm and there's a man walking on the water which has never happened anywhere else in history and he says be of good cheer what what what do they have to be cheerful about but something strikes Peter and this is the the important thing about it something strikes Peter deep down in his heart because there was something that was that was inside of Peter because he had a lot of problems Peter had a lot of issues and he was not sealed by the Holy Ghost he was pretty a new believer you know at this point in time and something just struck him odd that Jesus would be walking on water he could see it with his own eyes and yet there was something that was just unique about this situation that was just building up inside of him that he just it was just strange that this would be happening and Peter then cried back out to the him once he recognized what was happening so he recognized there was something happening and he called out to Jesus and recognizing who he was he said lord if it be thou if it really be you bid me to come unto thee on the water says the Lord if it be you and you got to think what faith of a man what courage of a man to say Lord if it be you then let me walk on the water as well because if you're doing that then you can allow me to come to you because I know that there's power that resides in you so there was just something that bubbled up with inside of him that where he knew there was something peculiar about this situation [Applause] so he says if it be you then let me come unto you and then jesus replied he says come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus now you could imagine I've been healed twice of sicknesses in my body real bad sickness I had real bad food allergies and I was completely healed of that and I had Lyme disease and I was completely healed of that so I know that God can heal so I have no problem praying for someone who is sick because I know he's done it because he done it to me I know he's capable of doing it I have no question as to whether he is a living God today who can touch us and let us feel his presence I have no question about that I have no problem preaching the Word of God because I know he is real because I have experienced him I have not seen them what I have experienced and I know that he is alive and I have confidence in that and Peter when he walked on the water when he took the first step it was God who gave him the ability to do that because Jesus had come but when he started to walk on the water there was something that was obviously reaffirmed in him because he began to walk further and he began to walk on water and he began to walk so he was doing it there was no other man that had the ability to walk on water and you got to wonder what what kind of presence there must have been on the ship that day because the storm didn't stop the cloud didn't cease the rain didn't cease everything was just as it was but this man had the ability to walk on the water because he knew that Jesus could allow him to do it it's just such a fascinating scene and verse 30 and here's the interesting thing but when he saw the wind boisterous and we know that the everything was the same nothing had calmed down nothing had happened it was the same Peter began then he was looking at the water and you began looking around he said I'm actually doing it but then when he looked around reality came back into play and I'm sure that Satan was right there on his shoulder and worked through his spirit realm just as he does to you and me so he's saying now Peter you're walking on water what are you doing and and and obviously he was working through a reason because he was looking at the waves and he was looking by what his eyesight was seeing and what he was experiencing so he's probably swaying I imagine he was probably swinging with the waves so he was looking at that obviously and you can it's it's point-blank what happened he was looking around he said I'm actually doing it I'm actually walking on water and then he began to looking around and then you actually realized what was happening is that but there's nobody else on the planet has ever done this and this is completely against the laws of physics I'm the fisherman I know how water works and then all of a sudden he found himself waist-deep in water because you see what happened Satan worked through a reason to get into his spirit realm he was just a human being like you and my you my you and me he had a body a spirit in his soul he had a spirit realm he had five ways and avenues into his spirit realm he was no different than you and I but yet he was accomplishing this incredible feat and yet when he looked up Satan was right there to work through reason and you begin to reason with himself and then he look down then all of a sudden he was in waist-deep verse 31 silver it's 30 and he said and he began to sink because he was afraid he began to see the wind in the water and boisterous and he became afraid he was experiencing Phobos is what this Greek word is he was he was right in the midst of Phobos but it was Satan who had worked through the spirit realm to develop that fear with inside of him that stopped him on the spot and made him start sinking he was he was accomplishing something that no other human being has had had it previously or since had done or has done and he was accomplishing this and he was actually walking if he had walked so far you'd think he'd be able to walk the rest of the way but he didn't because he stopped and looked around and Satan quickly used that Avenue of reason and got into the spirit realm and all of a sudden fear came in fears of the devil and faith cannot operate when there is fear in operation now the Peter knew who Christ was at this point in time because he recognized him and he said Lord if you can do this then allow me to come and do it with you so what faith of a man that would allow him to do that encouraged to step down off of the boat you can imagine what he was thinking what the other men were thinking when he put his swingers led a leg over the bow of the boat and its feet touched the water for the first time he could imagine what was going through him and yet he was walking he had enough faith to do that but as soon as he stopped singing use that that Avenue into his spirit realm and he sank on the spot he was no different than you and I he knew who was who was standing there before him and he was within reaching distance of Jesus and he was looking around and at that moment he sank because he was afraid he was experiencing Phobos how simple it is and yet how how it caused him to sink after after having accomplished something so amazing and so incredible in the presence of God and yet he was sinking verse 30 when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me just when David said he said Lord take not thy presence for me just like Elijah underneath the juniper-tree Lord that just let me die let come to me I need something I need some help it's like brother branham Paul throughout his life lord help me I need some kind of a help there was obviously something happening Satan was trying to work for that spirit realm and this almost happens daily in the seventh church Ange and Laodicea how the enemy works ever so harder they get to you and I'm bringing it down to a close I said it immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and he caught him and here's the key and it's simple you know I don't have to yell to make a good point stronger it's as strong enough as it is just by saying it just by reading it and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and he caught him and he said unto Him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt doubt fear is a part of the definition is one of the definitions of doubt to doubt is to fear to doubt is to have fear he said all you have little faith wherefore did you doubt you were afraid and the scripture says that he was afraid the thing about it is is that when we go through the situations in life when we go through our situation and our trials and we've gone through the things that we have we we lose the reality of the situation looking back on it of how God actually worked through us we we we look at the things of scripture and we almost in a way cannot relate to it to the warfare that David fought his battles with hood to the wisdom by which Solomon ruled his kingdom turned to the perplexity of the time when Jeremiah preached and we almost can't relate to the great things that they did and we fail to see how great a time that we live we failed to see the the the the reality of our self having the phone of the word being a reality that the deity of Christ in this age in the last time waiting for a rapture to happen we failed to see how important we are in the eyes of God in this age because we are thou fear to make us look at ourselves to look at our failures to look at this and we failed to realize how a mighty a time we live and how mighty we are through Christ and that the things that we have overcome day by day by day doesn't hold a candle to the things that that people did maybe one time in their life they went through one thing in their life and scripture writes about it maybe they live peaceful lives for the rest of it a lot their lives we don't know but yet the believer goes through in the latest sea an age something every single day you've heard ministers say that someone will come up to you on the other side and they'll say you're from Laodicea how did you do it it's every single day the enemy plods and prayin and probes at you and tries to get you into a place where he can get through your spirit realm he can try to reach you in a way that you don't even know what's going on and who tried to impute fear into you then when fear is there faith has no room to work and God cannot move you forward he cannot do anything with you when there is fear there Jesus he stretched forth his hand and he caught him Jesus his hand was outstretched Peter he was falling he couldn't catch he couldn't even catch himself he was water he was seeking because he was afraid and Jesus reached out his hand and he caught him what was happened is that this is fear was misplaced and he was looking he was looking at the circumstances and for that brief moment he allowed something to get inside of him and he feared the wrong thing see because scripture says to fear to fear the Lord and and we'll explain that further we had the time but what happened was is that Peter misplaced his fear because the fear of man bringeth a snare it says in the last days in this time men's hearts would fail them for fear the man's innermost intentions his desires his innermost being would fail him because of being afraid but Phobos there's not a day that day that goes by that Satan would not try to impute fear within you you fear how you look you fear what what will happen you fear what happens in business in your job in your business and your family you fear your for your children's lives you fear for your own life you fear for your future you fear everything that there is to fear and there's that little seed in there it sets that breeds anxiety and the anxiety comes and you're depressed by what happened in your in your past something happened way back then and Satan always through memory tries to bring that back into your into your mind a young man who will struggle with pornography in his life he'll be driving down the road and he'll be driving in a billboard will be there on the road it'll be a morally dressed woman of something maybe he dealt with that four years of his life and then they're just that billboard and he was delivered of it by it by God's grace he was delivered of it he's a born-again Holy Ghost filled believer and then all of a sudden the Billboard goes by and then all of a sudden through memory he remembers what what he saw because they never go away and he's just all of a sudden all these memories start coming back and by the time that young man gets home he's so depressed and so far from the presence of God he doesn't have strength to get down and pray so what he does is he turns to something else he turns to a movie he turned some music he turns to something else and drives him farther away from God and then the next morning he so he's so depressed and downtrodden they so afraid of what's going to happen it's just that little doubt that little thing that Avenue brought that fear into him now what I want to leave you with this evening 1956 and fellowship brother branham he said now we have great things that we can do in the in the realm of faith fakes the faith works great things for us and if you brethren here getting your and you can't have faith until you have love and that's just all there is to it you just perfect love casts out all fear and you as long as you've got fear you can't have faith so you got to have love first and it drives out all of the fear and then then faith comes in and takes the place of fear so when you can have that you're coming right along he says you've got to have love so you see love casts out the wrong kind of fear because God is love and if you love because God first love you and he is agape love and what it was is love it's not the the capstone love that we see in the pyramid it was not the the ability to love everybody and to be like a 1960 love to all humanity and love and peace God is love and it was that projecting down and reflecting off of that off of his bride it was Christ reflecting off of the moon the Sun reflecting off of the moon it was love being projected from the very nature of Christ and then that brought something out of the bride and that casts all the fear out because if you're if you're truly in the presence of the Sun then it brings something down that you cannot produce in yourself because it takes the Sun and the water to produce what's in the seed to bring it out of the seed so it's merely placing yourself in the right atmosphere in the right place that simply drives out all the fear if you try to drive out all the fear then it would be flesh trying to get it out and if it's flesh getting you out it'll be pledged to get your right back in but if you place yourself in the right atmosphere if you place yourself in the right in the right environment then it's the Holy Spirit comes down and he is the one who takes the fear away and he placed his faith because faith is a gift love is a gift of God you cannot attain agape love it is given of God because God is love and you are the very nature the flesh of his bone the the flesh of his flesh the bone of his bones you are taken from the very nature and and being of Christ and that is that part of you that is eternal that cannot go away and when you'e place that seed in the director and in the atmosphere that you must it casts out the fear it's not you that casts out the fear it is God who casts the fear out and then gives you faith it's a gift of God faith it's a revelation you simply have to you have to go to God in the right way you have to reach out and grab his hand because he's extending it to you and so for the Steve that's pretty simple yeah it is thanks thanks be to God that it is that simple there has to be what I want you to understand this evening is that there has to be a starting place for you to move forward with God you understand you you all you want to do with great things for God you can't and tell you you start somewhere and that starting place is to let God do it and to let God do it you have to place yourself within his ending within his grasp but you cannot do that when you're looking to everything and then Satan has all these avenues to just stop you in your tracks and then make you sink on you on the spot in order to stop sinking you have to allow faith to come in again but in order to stop sinking you have to reach out and grab the end of Christ you have to place yourself in the right atmosphere that is the first step you fear things you fear this and an anxiety and depression is a direct route of fear being in your life you suffer with anxiety depression and all these things is simply because fear has taken ahold of it you want to get rid of those things you want to start somewhere you want to do something for Christ and start right you have to reach out and allow God to do the work you can't do that you have to place yourself in the right atmosphere miss Charles Spurgeon he said before we can do any great things for Christ he said there must be a sense of weakness and then trust in the promised strength and then fear removed from that promise perfect love casts out all fear if the Lord top would like to get in at tomorrow night and musicians would come let's stand our feet like too close there you have to start somewhere these things don't just they they don't just happen on their own you don't just fear if if the song brother Gerald if you'd like to come and turn it over to you or the song leader you can't the thing that the thing that we we too often just disregard is the fact that we can't use flesh to get out of something because it'll be flesh to get us right back into something and if it's if it's the flesh in the mind that Satan uses to get into that spirit realm then then why would you try to use flesh to get you out of that because Satan still has access to it in a different way he simply would come in in a different route in the back door in the side door in order to overcome that in to make the step in the right direction you have to cast out all of the wrong kind of fear you have to cast out the phobos and he redirects your fear because all of the all of the issues that the anxiety the depression the the things that pause you and cause you to sink where you stand and in the in the in the problems of life in the things that we go through and everyday situations what causes you to start sinking is that little you know little root of fear and you misplace your your direction your misplaced your focus you start sinking on the spot in order to start right you have to place yourself in his presence you have to place yourself in that in that projection of love which is the capstone and then let him do the work and he'll turn able to turn it around let's pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord we love your father so much Lord we realize our frailty Lord our incapability Lord to get things right yes we realize our inability Lord to turn to the right thing our inability to focus on the right thing and so we turn to the to the storm that rages around us which will rage until you come we cannot escape it we cannot escape the pressure of life but Lord I know that there are those who are here myself included or subject to the fear that the world is engrossed with the darkness that that pressures the world it's the same pressure that pressure is us lord help us to to focus on the right thing not to be so caught up in ourselves and our problems and our anxieties but we cannot see clearly what lies before us and that is the outstretched hand of Almighty God to reach down and grab us where we stand this is regardless of where we are in our lives however young maybe we may be however old we may be whatever spot we find ourselves in whatever circumstance we find ourselves in Lord we know that that's that this truth is the same the two are the same yesterday today and forever and that your hand is outstretched in the same way as it was to Peter on that evening at that night when he began to sink you reached out your hand and you grabbed him and Lord we have confidence in the fact that your presence is here and capable to do the same thing tonight and it's in that presence that we submit ourselves Lord grandfather that you dare to remove us now we'd submit ourselves into the right right place granted father that you move among us man move us at once step forward and if we need to start over then help us to start tonight let's not go one step
