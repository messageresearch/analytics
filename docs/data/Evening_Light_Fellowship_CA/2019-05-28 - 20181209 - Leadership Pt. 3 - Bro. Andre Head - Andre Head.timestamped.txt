[1:06:04] then I get up early in the morning about
[1:06:06] 6:30 or 7 go to the church go in the
[1:06:09] office there and pray and study because
[1:06:11] they're out working I don't just want to
[1:06:13] be there just sitting I want to be
[1:06:15] working and praying for each one of them
[1:06:18] I have a list because we don't have
[1:06:19] about 40 Believers in the church so
[1:06:22] every morning I go there first thing we
[1:06:24] sing praising him to the Lord then I get
[1:06:26] that list out and I pray for each and
[1:06:28] every one each individual that's my job
[1:06:31] as a minister and I don't want to see
[1:06:33] not one believer in our church left in
[1:06:36] the tribulation I want them to be in the
[1:06:38] Rapture but if they're not in the
[1:06:40] Rapture I want them to be saved I don't
[1:06:42] want a single person in our congregation
[1:06:44] to ever be lost and I don't I don't want
[1:06:46] that for you either you see we take
[1:06:49] these things serious you know we're
[1:06:51] we're not playing Church we've come to
[1:06:53] the reality of God and you were called
[1:06:56] before the foundation of the world the
[1:06:58] same one that said let there be let
[1:07:00] there be and there was and there was
[1:07:03] that's the same one who has come in this
[1:07:05] hour for his own good purpose Amen to to
[1:07:10] express himself in your hearts in our
[1:07:13] lives and so how thankful you all have
[1:07:16] your own experiences and your own
[1:07:18] testimonies and those experiences and
[1:07:21] testimonies they lead us higher and
[1:07:23] higher and higher on the word and so a
[1:07:26] lot of times when I'm just waiting on
[1:07:28] the Lord there I'll go into that study
[1:07:31] and I just don't get there and say okay
[1:07:33] okay when sometimes I've got a couch in
[1:07:35] the office there I'll just sit on the
[1:07:38] end of the couch kind of
[1:07:41] meditate I've got our precious sister
[1:07:43] Marin's CD there we play that sometimes
[1:07:47] sometimes I'll fall asleep at the end of
[1:07:49] the
[1:07:50] couch then I'll wake up and say well
[1:07:53] Lord here I am
[1:07:56] and then read my scripture go home and
[1:07:59] and then maybe come set days and days
[1:08:03] and then something will start speaking
[1:08:05] to my heart amen and so for 24 years
[1:08:09] being in the ministry we I learned I
[1:08:11] used to get real you know nervous and
[1:08:15] those things but I learned to try to
[1:08:17] relax and let the Holy Spirit have his
[1:08:20] way and stuff found God he's not in a
[1:08:22] hurry he's not under pressure maybe I'm
[1:08:26] not prepared but he's always
[1:08:28] prepared so it's like brother Brown said
[1:08:31] it's what we yield ourselves to and so
[1:08:34] we thank the Lord for that amen aren't
[1:08:36] you glad to be a
[1:08:38] Christian aren't you glad to be the
[1:08:40] bride in the bride age with the promises
[1:08:43] that God has given us amen not didn't
[1:08:46] mean to keep you standing but I guess
[1:08:48] everybody should be over at First Peter
[1:08:51] chapter 5 and we're going to start at
[1:08:54] verse 6
[1:08:59] humble yourselves therefore under the
[1:09:02] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[1:09:07] in due time amen casting all your care
[1:09:11] upon him for he carth for you be sober
[1:09:16] be VI Vigilant because your adversary
[1:09:19] the devil as a roaring line walketh
[1:09:23] about seeking whom he may
[1:09:26] devour whom resist steadfast in the
[1:09:30] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[1:09:33] are accomplished in your brethren that
[1:09:36] are in the
[1:09:38] world but the God of all
[1:09:41] Grace who hath called us unto his
[1:09:45] eternal glory by Christ
[1:09:48] Jesus after that ye have suffered a
[1:09:51] while make you perfect stab Lish
[1:09:57] strengthen settle you to him be glory
[1:10:03] and Dominion forever and ever amen may
[1:10:08] the Lord add His blessings to the
[1:10:09] reading of his holy and precious words
[1:10:11] you may be seated let's turn over to uh
[1:10:15] Romans chapter
[1:10:18] 8 we see Paul with this exhortation
[1:10:22] speaking to the
[1:10:24] believer that that we we have to go
[1:10:27] through these afflictions and
[1:10:30] trials that the glory of God may be
[1:10:32] accomplished in our lives Amen Brother
[1:10:35] brandham Talks of it being elective love
[1:10:40] because God's love is not humanistic
[1:10:42] love it's God's love and God's love
[1:10:46] leads us to Perfection and understanding
[1:10:49] it establishes Us in the faith it brings
[1:10:52] us through great trials but he is
[1:10:55] perfecting us and we must go through the
[1:10:58] fire amen and then through the water
[1:11:01] that is brother Matthew bringing those
[1:11:03] things out to us the Refiner's Fire to
[1:11:07] purify us to purge us to bring us into
[1:11:10] his own image by his word and you know
[1:11:13] we don't give ourselves Temptations and
[1:11:16] trials if I had to give myself a trial
[1:11:19] or Temptation it'd be something very
[1:11:21] easy that wouldn't take too much out of
[1:11:24] me but God he knows how to put us into
[1:11:29] pressure and you've heard it mentioned
[1:11:31] before you know you take an orange and
[1:11:33] and you squeeze that orange you're going
[1:11:36] to get orange juice you're not going to
[1:11:38] squeeze an orange and get an Apple out
[1:11:41] of that you're not going to get apple
[1:11:43] juice and so we see when Christ was
[1:11:45] squeezed and he was put to the pressure
[1:11:48] it brought forth the Divine love of God
[1:11:51] you see and so you and I God creating
[1:11:54] his own own nature in us when we're
[1:11:57] squeezed is going to bring forth the
[1:12:00] very nature of Christ we're not going to
[1:12:02] bring forth anything contrary to God's
[1:12:06] word amen because the Holy Ghost who is
[1:12:08] building you up into Christ he's trying
[1:12:12] these virtues in your heart he is
[1:12:14] building these things these things these
[1:12:17] characteristics and virtues of Christ
[1:12:20] he's solidifying those things in our
[1:12:22] heart that when we go through trial and
[1:12:25] situations we're being built up into him
[1:12:28] we know how to handle the circumstances
[1:12:32] because perfect Faith teaches us that
[1:12:35] perfect Faith you know who you are and
[1:12:38] what you've been raised up to do raised
[1:12:40] up I don't mean just somebody lifting
[1:12:43] you up like that you have your children
[1:12:45] you raise your children you teach them
[1:12:48] you instruct them that's what I mean by
[1:12:50] raising up and the Holy Ghost raises us
[1:12:53] up in Jesus Christ teaches us tutors us
[1:12:57] he shows us how to handle because we are
[1:13:00] his children see and because we bypass
[1:13:03] our theophany the word and we come here
[1:13:06] to be tried and tested and to be built
[1:13:08] in His image then as we said there won't
[1:13:11] be anyone standing in the resurrection
[1:13:13] morning that doesn't have a testimony of
[1:13:17] how that they overcome in the age that
[1:13:20] they lived in and brother brandom says
[1:13:22] it's not what you overcome but how you
[1:13:24] overcome
[1:13:25] and we know that that overcoming is by
[1:13:28] the word being made spirit and life in
[1:13:31] our own lives so if if if I'm being led
[1:13:34] by the Holy Spirit then I would maybe if
[1:13:38] I wanted to try to impress someone maybe
[1:13:40] I would say you know I'm not going you
[1:13:42] know everything's just move for me and
[1:13:44] and going fine well that's all right but
[1:13:47] when the Holy Ghost leads us he takes us
[1:13:50] through some awful hard
[1:13:52] trials takes us through some real roads
[1:13:56] to go through real climbs there are
[1:13:58] mountains we must climb and there are
[1:14:01] valleys and situation
[1:14:03] circumstances I remember when brother
[1:14:05] Billy Paul many years ago he came down
[1:14:07] to mon Georgia and I'm originally from
[1:14:10] Georgia city called Marietta Georgia and
[1:14:13] uh the voice of God they were doing a
[1:14:15] wonderful tour it was called catch the
[1:14:17] vision tour in the United States and
[1:14:19] they had the bus and they were visiting
[1:14:21] cities and they came to mon Georgia and
[1:14:24] there's a wonderful Pastor in that area
[1:14:27] uh I can't think of his name now shame
[1:14:29] on me but he has a church in Perry
[1:14:32] Georgia I'll think of him in a little
[1:14:35] bit his his name but uh brother yansy
[1:14:37] brother David yansy and uh so brother
[1:14:40] the the the bus was there and brother
[1:14:42] Billy Paul and Brother Joseph brandham
[1:14:45] they were just it was just a wonderful
[1:14:46] time and uh so brother Billy Paul that
[1:14:50] he had the service that night of course
[1:14:52] he's not a preacher he's just testifying
[1:14:54] and he said you know uh everybody wanted
[1:14:58] to hear the different testimonies and we
[1:15:00] all do it just builds us up in the faith
[1:15:02] and things like that and him being there
[1:15:05] with uh brother brandham and seeing so
[1:15:07] many great Ma Miracles and and you could
[1:15:11] you can just imagine him right there he
[1:15:13] was the one giving out the prayer cards
[1:15:15] and watching the angel of the Lord come
[1:15:17] down and do all these things and he said
[1:15:20] you know brother Billy Paul said you
[1:15:21] know out of everything that the the I
[1:15:25] was humbled and privileged by the grace
[1:15:27] of the Lord to see he said the greatest
[1:15:30] thing that impressed me about my father
[1:15:33] was he mastered every circumstance says
[1:15:36] it didn't matter what he went through
[1:15:38] and he went through many things he said
[1:15:41] he was put out you don't know how he
[1:15:44] would hug up to a person knowing that
[1:15:45] the person didn't even like him and care
[1:15:48] about him because he could see the lives
[1:15:50] of people and and how the denominations
[1:15:53] would tell people he's want to be here
[1:15:55] but he wasn't there to bring in money
[1:15:57] all kind of stuff that brother brandham
[1:16:00] knew all this was going on Amen and yet
[1:16:03] with the love of God and the character
[1:16:05] of God he could have just come out and
[1:16:07] just blasted everybody but he didn't
[1:16:10] amen because he understood the
[1:16:12] leadership of the Holy Spirit you see
[1:16:15] and so brother Billy Paul said what what
[1:16:18] really really impress me about my father
[1:16:23] is that he could master anything that
[1:16:25] came before him he mastered that
[1:16:29] circumstance that always impacted my
[1:16:32] heart because God has privileged me to
[1:16:35] see Miracles and many wonderful things
[1:16:37] and I thank the Lord for even in my own
[1:16:39] life but to have but to know that God is
[1:16:44] raising me to master the
[1:16:48] circumstances by the word amen to know
[1:16:51] that my experiences are not schooled
[1:16:55] something schooled into me as brother
[1:16:57] brandham says in the message Satan's
[1:16:59] Eden your experiences are not something
[1:17:01] that schooled into you it's
[1:17:04] predestinated by the hand of God Amen
[1:17:07] and so knowing these things knowing
[1:17:09] these things knowing these things then
[1:17:13] we're not ignorant of what we have to go
[1:17:17] through and the trials and that God
[1:17:20] permits because when it comes to his
[1:17:22] bride and anything Satan doesn't have a
[1:17:25] free flow at the bride we see that in
[1:17:28] the Book of Job and the different ones
[1:17:30] amen God gives him permission for these
[1:17:32] trials and things like that brother
[1:17:35] brandham he talks of the sh of of the
[1:17:37] shepherd and the sheep and how that in
[1:17:40] the Eastern custom they have their
[1:17:42] Corrals and the shepherd leads the Sheep
[1:17:45] into that Corral many of them are made
[1:17:47] of stone but in front there's a door and
[1:17:51] you know it's not a door like we open
[1:17:53] it's the shepherd brother Brom taught us
[1:17:55] those things and Jesus taught us those
[1:17:57] things so that when the Sheep are put
[1:18:00] into the Corral for the night or for
[1:18:03] whatever situation they're uh in that
[1:18:07] Corral and there's only way only one way
[1:18:10] in and one way out and that's right by
[1:18:13] the door and that's where the shepherd
[1:18:16] lays down right there nothing can go out
[1:18:21] and nothing can come in unless it passes
[1:18:23] through him you see
[1:18:25] so so when we when we hear the word are
[1:18:28] we really hearing the word are we really
[1:18:32] understanding that your life has been
[1:18:35] predestinated by the hand of God and the
[1:18:38] situations that may come God has
[1:18:41] permitted these things or he doesn't
[1:18:43] have control at all you see so so the
[1:18:46] knowledge and the understanding and the
[1:18:49] wisdom of God it brings a maturity in
[1:18:53] you and I that would just not just
[1:18:55] stumbling from one thing stumbling and
[1:18:58] how did this happen what brought this no
[1:19:01] no no no we know God has permitted these
[1:19:04] things then we understand this is a
[1:19:07] reaction to the action amen and God is
[1:19:12] teaching us and showing us these things
[1:19:15] so I've seen people around the message
[1:19:17] they've been in meage 50 years and they
[1:19:20] still haven't matured to understand what
[1:19:22] is going on in their lives
[1:19:25] surprise surprise you know it shouldn't
[1:19:28] be like that that's right we know who we
[1:19:30] are we know our enemy and what we're
[1:19:33] fighting maybe maybe the the maybe the
[1:19:36] enemy comes in like a flood but the
[1:19:39] scripture says then in in Isaiah 59 then
[1:19:42] God raises up the standard and the
[1:19:45] standard is the Holy Ghost leadership in
[1:19:47] you that has God ain't given you trials
[1:19:50] and hadn't brought you to an
[1:19:53] understanding you see he perits these
[1:19:55] things after he has taught us you know
[1:19:58] as a child your parents they I hadn't
[1:20:01] even read my scripture yet you know God
[1:20:03] bless you you know as a
[1:20:05] child it's just a wonderful spirit here
[1:20:08] as a child you know my parents they
[1:20:11] would teach me don't do this do this
[1:20:13] don't do this do this don't do
[1:20:15] this and after a while you know they'd
[1:20:20] say well don't hang around with this boy
[1:20:22] down the street or wherever I lived in
[1:20:24] the country but mile away there were
[1:20:26] some kids and my dad said look you don't
[1:20:28] need to be hanging around them boys
[1:20:29] because this that but before he ever
[1:20:32] told me not to do something he's already
[1:20:34] instilled in
[1:20:36] me strength and what's right what you
[1:20:39] shouldn't do what you should do he don't
[1:20:42] just say well get out there and go at it
[1:20:44] and whatever happens come back and let
[1:20:46] me know no no no no he teaching me son
[1:20:49] don't be lying that's a bad thing don't
[1:20:52] lie okay Daddy I won't lie don't be
[1:20:55] stealing either boy we don't steal we
[1:20:57] work okay Daddy so so daddy already
[1:21:01] instilling things in me amen so that
[1:21:04] when I go into the store and I see a toy
[1:21:07] said man I know my mom and dad ain't got
[1:21:09] no money for that but I can just put it
[1:21:11] in my jacket like this and take it home
[1:21:14] but there's something in me
[1:21:16] saying that ain't your you ain't got no
[1:21:18] money you going to have to wait a
[1:21:20] Christmas to Santa Claus come I'm
[1:21:26] your mom and
[1:21:28] daddy but what I'm saying is has God
[1:21:31] been
[1:21:32] insing has God been putting his virtue
[1:21:35] into you and I has he really been
[1:21:38] building himself up into us or we just
[1:21:41] trying to hang on to it you know when
[1:21:43] brother brandham had lost his wife hope
[1:21:46] and Sharon Rose there and then after the
[1:21:49] flood there of uh the great Ohio flood
[1:21:53] there he was I don't know how long after
[1:21:56] this was but brother Brown said he was
[1:21:58] walking down the road and I don't know
[1:22:00] if it was the mayor of the sheriff they
[1:22:02] said bill I don't know how you do it he
[1:22:06] said what do you mean sir he said I
[1:22:08] don't know how you can keep your
[1:22:10] religion and the times and the things
[1:22:13] that you've been through I don't know
[1:22:14] how you could keep it he said I didn't
[1:22:17] sir it kept me
[1:22:19] amen amen so Lord so when we begin to
[1:22:24] hear
[1:22:25] God speaking through his message and
[1:22:28] begin to
[1:22:29] meditate and not just well I heard that
[1:22:31] message and I heard this message and and
[1:22:34] uh you hear what brother Brown said on
[1:22:35] that well that's fine but are these
[1:22:38] things are they becoming us are they be
[1:22:42] are they you have to ask yourself am I
[1:22:44] becoming this am I just is this
[1:22:47] memorization or am I really am I really
[1:22:51] becoming what I'm hearing and by changed
[1:22:55] from glory to glory so we find ourselves
[1:22:59] in this hour we're not at a time where
[1:23:02] we just want to run over the word of God
[1:23:05] we want to examine ourselves we want to
[1:23:08] look into the mirror of God's word amise
[1:23:11] the Lord and as our pastor was saying
[1:23:13] the other day we know what the
[1:23:17] requirements are in this hour as we said
[1:23:21] um as we said the other night when you
[1:23:24] ask
[1:23:25] about going in the Rapture yes I'm
[1:23:27] waiting maybe tonight I'm going in the
[1:23:29] Rapture I'm going in the Rapture then
[1:23:31] you ask well are there any requirements
[1:23:34] well you know just to believe brother
[1:23:36] Brandon that's the requirement well yeah
[1:23:38] that's right but it's it's more
[1:23:39] requirements to that we got to be built
[1:23:42] up into the statue of a perfect man amen
[1:23:45] you see I mean there's requirements for
[1:23:47] these things not just you know well
[1:23:49] praise God we're going to be flying off
[1:23:51] one day or go to another dimension well
[1:23:55] that's fine I'm not knocking any of that
[1:23:57] y all understand that right but I'm just
[1:23:59] saying we got to examine our lives by
[1:24:03] the scripture and see if what the word
[1:24:06] for this hour if that is being built up
[1:24:09] in me amen amen if that's been built up
[1:24:13] in me and I'm walking in that light then
[1:24:15] I know light comes from the word of this
[1:24:18] hour amen and the Holy Ghost is going to
[1:24:21] lead me to the promise of this hour
[1:24:24] right he see that's right that's the
[1:24:26] leadership that we must look in
[1:24:28] ourselves and say is that now Lord
[1:24:31] forgive me because I was down in the
[1:24:33] study this morning and I saw the brother
[1:24:36] had come so I don't want anyone to think
[1:24:38] I would ever attack any of God's
[1:24:40] Ministry I never do that but I must be
[1:24:43] honest with you so I saw the the title
[1:24:46] of the messages and things I thought man
[1:24:49] well that's good but listen brother and
[1:24:51] sisters if we still at the point where
[1:24:53] we got to teach each other to be kind
[1:24:55] and be nice to one another bro we we
[1:24:58] done got left behind that's right that's
[1:25:00] right that's the truth
[1:25:03] amen I got I've been in the message 27
[1:25:06] years and I got to tell somebody got to
[1:25:08] come to me and say look brother Andre
[1:25:09] you need to be kind to people and stop
[1:25:12] this and that and this and that well
[1:25:13] that's all right but if if 27 years in
[1:25:16] my experience with the Holy Ghost under
[1:25:19] a vindicative message like this and I
[1:25:21] still got to try to be kind to somebody
[1:25:25] brother Lord Lord please don't come
[1:25:30] now see that's the infancy of the Bride
[1:25:34] that's right amen so we're not in the
[1:25:38] infancy of the Bride we're in the
[1:25:41] rapturing age amen where Divine love has
[1:25:45] been that all these work by Divine love
[1:25:48] divine love is what build that faith and
[1:25:50] virtue knowledge Temperance that's
[1:25:52] Divine love that's the headstone
[1:25:54] building you up into himself amen so
[1:25:57] those are just Elementary things I
[1:25:58] wanted to say but we have to examine
[1:26:02] ourselves by the word we don't want any
[1:26:06] disappointments like brother Brown said
[1:26:08] the old negro man Moos he said uh he
[1:26:12] said when I get down to the Jordan I
[1:26:14] just want to give him my token and just
[1:26:16] cross on over I don't want no problems
[1:26:18] then amen amen so we want to examine we
[1:26:21] don't want no problems here at this end
[1:26:23] time we want to just be right with the
[1:26:26] word if as we said the other night if
[1:26:29] there's complexes or habits or things in
[1:26:32] our life people think CU you go to
[1:26:34] church you ain't got no
[1:26:36] problems like they go to church so they
[1:26:38] ain't got no problem they just lit
[1:26:40] living in a you know a flowery bed of
[1:26:44] ease
[1:26:46] what
[1:26:47] what if you serving God you fighting
[1:26:51] battles so people just just having the
[1:26:55] mindset that well if you go to church
[1:26:57] everything ly doy you on a big picnic
[1:27:00] just think the children of Israel when
[1:27:03] they crossed over the Jordan River there
[1:27:05] and God had told them you're going to go
[1:27:08] to a a land that flows with milk and
[1:27:11] honey and God promised Abraham this and
[1:27:14] no doubt they would rehearse that man
[1:27:17] we'll leave Egypt we're going to a land
[1:27:19] that's flowing with milk and honey and
[1:27:21] then Joshua and Caleb come back with the
[1:27:23] evidence of the land those grapes and
[1:27:25] things and and the people think man look
[1:27:27] at the big cluster of grapes and and
[1:27:30] strawberries and raspberries and dates
[1:27:33] and all those uh fruits that grow in the
[1:27:35] Middle East and they probably thought
[1:27:36] man what a land this is and probably
[1:27:39] some of thought man well when I get over
[1:27:41] in my land I'm just G to hang my hammock
[1:27:44] and just let the Lord just keep feeding
[1:27:47] me like he's been feeding me all these
[1:27:50] years I'm just going to hang my hammock
[1:27:52] and just sing uh oh I want to see him
[1:27:55] and and but then when they got over
[1:27:57] there joshu thought about look y'all
[1:28:00] going to have to fight
[1:28:02] fight we thought God yeah and and and we
[1:28:06] ain't getting no that bread that's been
[1:28:08] falling we going to have to eat the old
[1:28:10] corn now we going to have to
[1:28:12] plant and some of you born in the
[1:28:15] wilderness and you ain't been
[1:28:16] circumcised pull out the knives you're
[1:28:19] going to get circumcised now because
[1:28:22] you're in a new promised land now
[1:28:24] amen so going into that they had to be
[1:28:27] circumcised they had to been be taught
[1:28:30] how to fight rais them up God raising
[1:28:34] them up showing them how to fight and
[1:28:37] Caleb and them already knowing how to
[1:28:38] fight it wasn't an easy thing but they
[1:28:41] knew they had a promise Caleb said as it
[1:28:46] was in my heart he had a revelation he
[1:28:50] was of a different Spirit just think he
[1:28:52] had been he had come out with all of
[1:28:54] them and those two million were brother
[1:28:57] R said only two went into the promised
[1:28:59] land this man the God said to Moses he
[1:29:03] said Moses these two men Joshua and
[1:29:07] Caleb they will go into the land because
[1:29:10] they are of a different spirit
[1:29:14] amen can imagine all those people there
[1:29:17] two million people when they first went
[1:29:20] down into Egypt 70 Souls but over 400
[1:29:24] some years 70 had multiplied to over 2
[1:29:27] million people amen and when God by a
[1:29:31] mighty hand went down to deliver them
[1:29:34] just like you're walking today just like
[1:29:37] many in the briad today were going into
[1:29:39] the promise can you imagine God saying
[1:29:42] of all of
[1:29:45] these only these two because they are a
[1:29:49] different
[1:29:49] spirit amen that'd be an incredible
[1:29:53] thing right so you got to examine your
[1:29:57] own lives by the word and ask yourself
[1:30:00] am I of a different Spirit than just a
[1:30:03] religious spirit that's around the
[1:30:04] message and and people into this and and
[1:30:07] all kind of spirits you got to ask
[1:30:09] yourself what has the word of God built
[1:30:11] in
[1:30:13] me you got to do that you see you got to
[1:30:17] look in that mirror and you say well I
[1:30:20] got frailties and things that ain't got
[1:30:22] nothing to do with it you you can't
[1:30:24] never perfect the flesh so you you keep
[1:30:27] your eyes on the
[1:30:29] word the word will do what it said it
[1:30:32] would do and faith in God's word you see
[1:30:36] so you so don't let the devil just CU
[1:30:38] you might be going through hard times
[1:30:40] and people you say well people see I'm
[1:30:42] going through hard times well praise God
[1:30:43] you're going through hard times amen
[1:30:45] because God has permitted you and he's
[1:30:48] giving you a test and in the message how
[1:30:50] can I overcome brother brand said the
[1:30:52] greatest thing that God can give you not
[1:30:54] talking about the Holy Ghost is a test
[1:30:57] and that test is to prove your faith you
[1:30:59] see he knows it he knows everything that
[1:31:01] great intelligence he knows it all you
[1:31:03] see but what do you know you see what is
[1:31:07] coming out of your heart what are you
[1:31:10] seeing that is being reflected because
[1:31:14] as the prophet of God said you are
[1:31:15] reflecting what you are in another
[1:31:18] dimension and that's that theophany you
[1:31:19] see and so I didn't mean to get started
[1:31:23] like that but the the Holy Ghost knows
[1:31:24] what he's doing a amen where we at
[1:31:27] Romans chapter 8 and then we got to
[1:31:30] go Romans chapter I just want to thank
[1:31:33] that brother for taking the clot down
[1:31:35] last
[1:31:37] night that was a uh uh a Act of Valor
[1:31:44] there I hope nobody said anything
[1:31:47] negative to
[1:31:49] him if they did count it all
[1:31:51] joy I know they wouldn't I I know this
[1:31:54] group of believers they love the word
[1:31:56] Romans chapter 8 so we're still talking
[1:31:59] about this
[1:32:00] leadership uh by the grace and the mercy
[1:32:03] of the Lord and let's let's look into
[1:32:05] this word now Romans chapter 8 ver14 I
[1:32:08] love this book of the whole the whole
[1:32:10] Bible and Romans 8 is certainly very
[1:32:13] very special there I mean the Apostle
[1:32:16] Paul he starts out in Romans 81 there is
[1:32:19] therefore now no
[1:32:21] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:32:24] and then when he gets to the end of
[1:32:26] Romans chapter 8 around verse 38 and 39
[1:32:29] he said I am persuaded that nothing can
[1:32:33] separate you from the love of God that's
[1:32:36] the same chapter where he says if God be
[1:32:38] for you who can be against you it's the
[1:32:40] same chapter where he says who can bring
[1:32:42] to charge to God's elect it is God that
[1:32:45] justifi you see amen wonderful scripture
[1:32:48] and so we see here in Romans chapter 8
[1:32:50] verse4 for as many as are led by the
[1:32:53] spirit of God God they are the sons of
[1:32:56] God and so we know the leadership of the
[1:33:01] Holy Ghost is taking us somewhere we're
[1:33:04] not just being led in circles we're not
[1:33:09] as brother Brown preached that message
[1:33:11] turn northward and how thankful we are
[1:33:14] that we're not just marching and going
[1:33:16] in circles brother Brown talked about in
[1:33:18] the message God when he was in the ater
[1:33:21] rondak mountains there in New York and
[1:33:24] his wife he was on his honeymoon and his
[1:33:26] wife Ma and Billy Paul was there at the
[1:33:29] cabin there and he wanted to get his
[1:33:31] hunt and there he was and it was snowing
[1:33:34] the the the darkness was falling in the
[1:33:36] evening time and brother Brandon who was
[1:33:38] a great God he even in that message of
[1:33:41] God he goes into minute details of how
[1:33:45] if you're in the wilderness to uh uh
[1:33:48] know uh north south east and west and to
[1:33:51] know directions he goes into that
[1:33:54] meticulously in that message and then he
[1:33:56] gets to a place and say you know then I
[1:33:59] found myself on the ending Death March I
[1:34:01] was lost in circles walking in circles
[1:34:06] think of that think you've been in the
[1:34:08] message so long just walking in circles
[1:34:10] and you and you see no growth and you
[1:34:12] realize man what's going on
[1:34:15] here I don't want to be in the ending
[1:34:17] Death March we don't want to be walking
[1:34:19] in circles we want to be climbing higher
[1:34:22] and higher and higher under the
[1:34:23] leadership of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:34:25] producing those characters in our life
[1:34:28] by the trials those trials
[1:34:31] divinely predestinated trials in your
[1:34:34] life to produce this characteristic
[1:34:36] because who can produce Faith as we said
[1:34:38] in the message uh works as Faith Express
[1:34:41] and that message brother brandom says
[1:34:43] you did not have faith faith is a gift
[1:34:46] from God it's a revelation you see and
[1:34:49] so how thankful we are that we cannot
[1:34:51] create these Divine natures in ourselves
[1:34:54] it's the Holy Ghost under that
[1:34:56] leadership of the Holy Ghost he opens
[1:34:59] the word to us he opens that word and
[1:35:01] makes that word a living reality to you
[1:35:05] and I the word becomes spirit and life
[1:35:08] in our own lives you see that's what the
[1:35:11] prophet said in the message uh Christ is
[1:35:13] the mystery of God reveal he says now
[1:35:16] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:35:18] bondage again to fear but ye have
[1:35:20] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:35:23] we cry out by father and we saw that
[1:35:25] yesterday when we read over in 1 John
[1:35:28] chapter 4 I believe that it said perfect
[1:35:31] love cast out fear so the journey that
[1:35:35] God is directing and leading you and I
[1:35:38] it must be putting all fear and unbelief
[1:35:42] away because remember let this be glued
[1:35:46] in your heart this great Holy Spirit
[1:35:49] this great supernatural being the angel
[1:35:51] of the Lord the same one that when
[1:35:53] Joshua had crossed over Jordan he was
[1:35:57] there and he told the people we're going
[1:35:59] to take Jericho that's going to be the
[1:36:01] first battle there we're going to take
[1:36:03] Jericho and he himself who had been
[1:36:06] given a commission by God himself to go
[1:36:09] no man shall be able to stand before you
[1:36:11] don't fear don't fret I will be with you
[1:36:15] you see Joshua under his commission
[1:36:18] moving he brother brandham said in the
[1:36:21] scriptures you know the scriptures he
[1:36:22] saw a man standing against the
[1:36:25] building and he drew his
[1:36:27] sword and he ran over to the man and he
[1:36:31] said who are you are you with us or are
[1:36:34] you against us and that great Angel of
[1:36:36] the Lord who had imorph himself with his
[1:36:39] arms like this he said to Joshua I am
[1:36:43] the captain of the
[1:36:44] host I am
[1:36:47] God and Joshua fell down on his knees
[1:36:51] and God said take off thy shoes
[1:36:54] you're on Holy Ground then Joshua knew
[1:36:57] he was not in charge of the battle but
[1:37:00] there was one that was leading him to
[1:37:02] Victory after Victory after Victory who
[1:37:06] is leading you is the question this
[1:37:08] morning are you being led by some mental
[1:37:11] conception or can you say that the same
[1:37:14] one that led Joshua that's LED every
[1:37:17] messenger Through the Ages is that the
[1:37:19] same Bible holy ghost that is leading
[1:37:22] you
[1:37:24] amen you see that angel of the Lord that
[1:37:29] is indwelling in You by the baptism of
[1:37:31] the Holy Ghost leading and guiding us
[1:37:35] when that Mighty angel of Revelations 10
[1:37:38] descended there with an open book A book
[1:37:42] that God had given Adam in Genesis given
[1:37:46] him this great
[1:37:48] inheritance and after the fall brother
[1:37:51] Bram says that book went back to the
[1:37:52] author self into the hands of
[1:37:56] God and then it was in the hands of
[1:38:00] God until we see a lamb comes and takes
[1:38:05] the book in Revelations chapter 5
[1:38:08] amen he is worthy to take the book that
[1:38:12] same lamb that same Holy Ghost has to be
[1:38:16] in your heart to take the book and open
[1:38:19] the seals and reveal the mystery of your
[1:38:23] Redemption to you that same one it's the
[1:38:27] same one you said that was a lamb but
[1:38:30] when the seals were open brother Bram
[1:38:32] said my revelation of it is the lamb and
[1:38:35] the Holy Ghost are the selfs same person
[1:38:38] only in a different form so the baptism
[1:38:41] of the Holy Ghost that took the seals
[1:38:44] and opened the seals and broke those and
[1:38:46] came down in this day is the same holy
[1:38:49] ghost that led the prophet am so who am
[1:38:53] I lifting up man no no no the Holy
[1:38:57] Ghost so that leadership in your life of
[1:39:01] the Holy Ghost that takes you from Fear
[1:39:04] brings you into Faith begins to raise
[1:39:07] you up into the very image of the Living
[1:39:11] God Amen then he begins to show you that
[1:39:15] the entire leadership and the reason
[1:39:18] that you're here this morning is not
[1:39:20] just to see one another but the reason
[1:39:23] that you're here this morning is to hear
[1:39:25] that word and have that Holy Ghost to
[1:39:28] Quicken and make aive more and more into
[1:39:31] the positive and that's why Paul said
[1:39:34] that which is perfect has come and that
[1:39:36] which is
[1:39:37] perfect is divine
[1:39:40] love
[1:39:41] amen so the connection that the Holy
[1:39:44] Ghost has in your heart if he's not
[1:39:47] leading you listen now if he's not
[1:39:49] leading you from Mortal to immortality
[1:39:52] you're not under his leadersh
[1:39:54] ship because we this leadership is not
[1:39:57] Church home Church home Church home
[1:40:00] Church home Church home Church
[1:40:04] home is that all the broadest Church
[1:40:07] home did you hear that message yeah did
[1:40:08] you listen that meage yeah Church home
[1:40:10] Church home we're under the eagle
[1:40:13] anointing this is a people in the Third
[1:40:15] Exodus this is a bride who is in the in
[1:40:18] motion that's journeying out of this
[1:40:21] chaos amen
[1:40:25] that's why brother brandham said and we
[1:40:27] see judgment in the land
[1:40:28] already that's why brother brand said
[1:40:31] people will begin to say I thought there
[1:40:32] was supposed to be a Rapture before
[1:40:34] these things and a voice said it already
[1:40:35] happened you didn't know it people
[1:40:37] around the message going to be stuck in
[1:40:39] churches remembering brother Andre said
[1:40:41] Church home Church home and the bride
[1:40:43] already
[1:40:47] gone that's not you you were not made
[1:40:50] for that you were created for an eternal
[1:40:54] purpose amen you see so when we become
[1:41:00] conscious of the reality not the
[1:41:04] circumstances because your house your
[1:41:07] car your job that
[1:41:11] circumstances that can go
[1:41:13] like that amen so impress me impress me
[1:41:19] wear some high dollar shirt impress me
[1:41:22] that would that impress the Bride come
[1:41:24] on now dress fancy and and Vace and all
[1:41:29] of this nonsense that don't mean
[1:41:34] nothing you say I got a million in the
[1:41:36] bank it don't matter if you got a
[1:41:37] billion in the
[1:41:40] banken what does that mean when you have
[1:41:43] turned Heavenly and you understand that
[1:41:46] you're being led out of this chaos then
[1:41:49] what do these temporal things mean to
[1:41:51] you amen sure we have them sure we want
[1:41:55] to have nice homes and and all those
[1:41:58] nice things but the bride ain't holding
[1:42:00] on to none of
[1:42:02] that that's just nice convenient things
[1:42:04] to help us through amen but the bride
[1:42:08] has been so connected to the holy
[1:42:11] ghost that under that leadership of the
[1:42:14] Holy Ghost each and everyone here this
[1:42:16] morning should be able to get up behind
[1:42:18] this testimony and show and be proved
[1:42:21] guilty of being a Christian that the
[1:42:23] leadership of the Holy Ghost is leading
[1:42:25] you into
[1:42:26] immortality without quoting me what
[1:42:28] brother brandham said
[1:42:31] amen if you can't then what testimony do
[1:42:34] you have on Resurrection morning when
[1:42:37] that race of the the race of almighty
[1:42:41] God in human flesh stands in their age
[1:42:45] and says I
[1:42:48] overcame by the word of God for this
[1:42:52] age
[1:42:55] what about you you stand in that group
[1:42:58] sure you do sure you do so the
[1:43:02] leadership of the Holy Ghost so we know
[1:43:05] that this holy spirit is leading us from
[1:43:07] Mortal to immortality
[1:43:10] amen so somebody ask me you in the you
[1:43:12] in the message brother Andre yes I am
[1:43:15] what is the Holy Ghost doing he leading
[1:43:16] me from more than immortality brother he
[1:43:19] leading me out of here and in that
[1:43:21] leadership I'm growing growing up into
[1:43:23] him who is the head of all things and
[1:43:26] I'm mastering circumstances in my
[1:43:30] life and I see a Life coming forth that
[1:43:33] I didn't receive from Mama and Papa but
[1:43:36] come from God and it's growing and the
[1:43:39] sunlight is drawing
[1:43:41] it like like like the sunflower I didn't
[1:43:45] know I I was talking about in central
[1:43:47] when we were over in Venezuela and uh uh
[1:43:50] Sant Elena there and and the sister uh
[1:43:54] sister Theodore she had these beautiful
[1:43:57] sunflowers I I really didn't know about
[1:43:59] sunflowers until that day and my wife
[1:44:01] she knows about flowers and she said my
[1:44:03] you should see these sunflowers they're
[1:44:05] so beautiful and I looked and I saw them
[1:44:08] but the sun wasn't out so they were kind
[1:44:10] of kind of closed up like that but she
[1:44:12] said no no no no they'll they follow the
[1:44:15] Sun so I said I said Okay I want to
[1:44:19] watch this and so after the sun was up
[1:44:22] then the sun there in the East and they
[1:44:25] had they had opened up their petals and
[1:44:27] you could see the yellow of the
[1:44:29] sunflower and it was just facing this
[1:44:31] way and I said well that's nice that's
[1:44:33] nice but then by midday the sun right
[1:44:37] here they ain't still facing this way
[1:44:40] them flowers done turn that way it's
[1:44:43] still looking at the sun I told my wife
[1:44:45] man that's right that's that's
[1:44:48] sweet then getting toward the evening
[1:44:51] that sunflower done turn like this to
[1:44:53] following the
[1:44:55] sun I thought man she said that's why
[1:44:58] they call it the sunflower it follows
[1:45:01] the
[1:45:02] sun I thought
[1:45:04] my that's a
[1:45:07] revelation because the sun 93 93.6 7
[1:45:11] million miles from the earth yet that
[1:45:14] sun has an effect on that little
[1:45:19] flow it's following the light of that
[1:45:22] song
[1:45:23] Hallelujah pise the Lord are we
[1:45:26] following the
[1:45:28] light of the Son of
[1:45:30] God are we are we moving with that or am
[1:45:34] I am I like this the sun over here and
[1:45:36] I'm like this talking about praise the
[1:45:38] Lord praise the Lord I'm in the light
[1:45:41] somebody said you in the light the light
[1:45:42] over there you talking about you in the
[1:45:44] light oh so you just singing you ain't
[1:45:47] you just
[1:45:48] singing the light yeah turn your head
[1:45:50] over there oh yeah there go the light oh
[1:45:52] man
[1:45:55] see so this
[1:45:58] connection this
[1:46:02] 93.6 million miles from the earth the
[1:46:05] sun rays the energy from the Sun is
[1:46:09] having a relationship with this
[1:46:10] sunflower
[1:46:12] amen praise God praise God praise God
[1:46:18] praise God praise God it's being led by
[1:46:22] the L right brother Brown said my first
[1:46:25] Bible was nature so when we can see even
[1:46:29] nature is obedient to God then you ask
[1:46:33] yourself what about these sons of God
[1:46:35] they still looking that way and the
[1:46:37] sunflower know where the sun
[1:46:39] is so you and I having that connection
[1:46:43] with the Holy Ghost when he moves we
[1:46:45] move with him when he goes higher we go
[1:46:48] higher when he brings forth then we
[1:46:51] receive because we are in connection
[1:46:54] with that light you see then being in in
[1:46:58] connection with the Holy Ghost you and I
[1:47:00] cannot go in a Rapture without
[1:47:02] connecting to our
[1:47:06] theophany will'll be Earthbound is
[1:47:08] Earthbound can be there has to be a
[1:47:11] connection and a Biblical chord that is
[1:47:14] connected us to that
[1:47:17] theophany and you're drawing from that
[1:47:19] word drawing from that word so we see
[1:47:23] here in Romans chapter 8 verse 16 the
[1:47:27] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[1:47:29] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:47:33] and if children then
[1:47:36] hires now the leadership of the Holy
[1:47:39] Ghost you already know these things we
[1:47:41] ain't bringing nothing new the
[1:47:42] leadership of the Holy Ghost is to bring
[1:47:45] you back to the position that you were
[1:47:47] in the mind of God before the foundation
[1:47:50] of the world Amen so we know our
[1:47:52] destination
[1:47:53] we're not a people that don't know where
[1:47:55] they're
[1:47:56] going we are people that know exactly
[1:48:00] that we're going from justification to
[1:48:02] sanctification to the baptism of the
[1:48:04] Holy Ghost to the mystery of
[1:48:06] justification the mystery of uh of
[1:48:09] justification sanctification The Mystery
[1:48:11] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is
[1:48:13] brought To Us by the coming of MDC amen
[1:48:16] we know that we're going from the church
[1:48:18] a justification to a higher
[1:48:20] justification that you never did sin and
[1:48:23] you was never looked at as a sinner only
[1:48:25] MDC can bring you into that position
[1:48:28] under the mystery of justification
[1:48:31] because he is King justification king of
[1:48:34] righteousness king of Peace
[1:48:36] sanctification King of Kings baptism of
[1:48:38] the Holy Ghost amen you see the reality
[1:48:42] and the bride has come to the reality
[1:48:45] we're not preaching types and shadows
[1:48:48] tipes and shadows were something we were
[1:48:50] looking at but now the reality it has
[1:48:53] come Christ has come that which is
[1:48:56] perfect has come and you're being made
[1:48:58] into the very image of God
[1:49:01] himself leadership and so we see hes the
[1:49:05] Bible says hes of God and as we were
[1:49:08] saying last night your new birth is not
[1:49:12] the same as your adoption adoption is
[1:49:15] placing we are born a child into the
[1:49:19] kingdom of God how many in here born an

[1:49:25] adult your mama in there screaming ah
[1:49:30] ah every floor on the hospital hearing
[1:49:32] her thinking man what going on
[1:49:35] there and then she deliver you and it
[1:49:39] used to be a time they had little babies
[1:49:41] in a little glass you could see and
[1:49:44] somebody said you need to go down there
[1:49:46] and see that
[1:49:47] baby go down there you see them
[1:49:49] little baby in the basket and then you
[1:49:50] see a grown man laying in the bed

[1:50:19] birth in Christ you don't come no full
[1:50:22] grown person
[1:50:23] Amen brother so your adoption that's
[1:50:28] sunship many people don't even though
[1:50:30] they're born again they don't go all the
[1:50:32] way with to their adoption because God
[1:50:36] listen now God adopts his own
[1:50:43] children I want y'all to go I want y'all
[1:50:46] to see if I'm telling the truth go in
[1:50:48] the Cod book and see what brother
[1:50:50] brandham said and go in the adoption
[1:50:52] book because y'all been reading the
[1:50:53] message 50 years and if y'all don't know
[1:50:56] that then shame on you because brother
[1:50:58] Gerald preach these thing if you don't
[1:51:00] know that your birth and your adoption
[1:51:02] two different things then you ain't
[1:51:03] never read the message
[1:51:06] amen you got to grow up into
[1:51:11] him so when you grow up into him you
[1:51:13] ever heard of an adoption ceremony in
[1:51:15] the Old Testament brother brand said
[1:51:17] they had an adoption ceremony now a man
[1:51:19] may have had four or five Sons but he
[1:51:21] wasn't given all his inheritance to any
[1:51:24] son now the firstborn son according to
[1:51:27] the Old Testament that firstborn son he
[1:51:30] was to receive a double portion of the
[1:51:33] inheritance he would be he would be the
[1:51:35] very priest of the family you see the
[1:51:39] firstborn son would receive a double
[1:51:43] inheritance of the family now that son
[1:51:46] ain't let that father brother bandam
[1:51:48] told us in in the message uh hear ye him
[1:51:51] different one speak to this Mountain
[1:51:53] that there was a in the Old Testament
[1:51:55] that they had to raise a child and the
[1:51:57] father would get a tutor and he would
[1:51:59] get the best tutor he could to raise
[1:52:01] that son he wouldn't just get anybody
[1:52:04] he'd get the best one he could to raise
[1:52:06] his son that that son would know about
[1:52:08] the business of the father and be about
[1:52:10] the father's business
[1:52:12] amen see so he wouldn't just at the at
[1:52:17] the time of birth he wouldn't say praise
[1:52:19] God here's the inheritance son because
[1:52:22] that some might be a renegade he might
[1:52:24] have a good son he might have a renegade
[1:52:26] son he might have all kind of thing so
[1:52:28] he got to try and test that son to see
[1:52:31] if he can give his inheritance to him
[1:52:33] amen what he going to give his inherit a
[1:52:35] man done worked all his life him and his
[1:52:37] wife they got money in the bank lands
[1:52:39] and everything father been responsible
[1:52:42] and they birth a son who ain't
[1:52:44] responsible and just like the prodical
[1:52:46] son just say Daddy give me my
[1:52:48] inheritance or daddy let me have the
[1:52:51] inheritance and the I said
[1:52:53] what give you the
[1:52:56] inheritance boy you are hot riding
[1:52:59] around you done already waste yours and
[1:53:02] and you ain't got no responsibility you
[1:53:04] think the father going to just hit call
[1:53:06] the mother and say sweetheart come on
[1:53:08] this our little son and I know he ain't
[1:53:11] been responsible but he told me he gonna
[1:53:13] be responsible so let's just go ahead
[1:53:16] and write that million dollars and give
[1:53:17] it to him let's just go ahead and give
[1:53:19] him the deed to the land and the house
[1:53:21] he said we can stay stay in the house
[1:53:23] for a
[1:53:25] while he already done bought our bearing
[1:53:28] plots and everything plus he took a lot
[1:53:30] of in
[1:53:33] dang only some a parent
[1:53:37] that's that don't know what they're
[1:53:40] doing but you want to give your that
[1:53:42] tutor has so tutored your son you want
[1:53:44] to say to your son son I see you being
[1:53:48] responsible I see this this all these
[1:53:51] qualities at that are in me it's in you
[1:53:54] and I've been testing you watching you
[1:53:56] over these years see how you going to
[1:53:57] conduct yourself me and my mom me and
[1:53:59] your mom have been watching you and
[1:54:01] you've been growing up you've been
[1:54:02] responsible even when you made problems
[1:54:05] and did thing you came back respected me
[1:54:07] and your mama etc etc etc we going to
[1:54:11] have a ceremony for you we're going to
[1:54:13] adopt you into the family praise the
[1:54:16] Lord now he was birthed into the family
[1:54:18] but you got to be adopted into the
[1:54:20] family you see Amen to receive the
[1:54:21] inheritance
[1:54:22] so the Bible says that you and I the
[1:54:25] elect are Heirs of God you have an
[1:54:28] inheritance in God but it goes further
[1:54:32] you don't think the Apostle Paul knew
[1:54:34] what it meant to be joint heirs with the
[1:54:38] firstborn so he doesn't stop and say
[1:54:40] you're just hirs with God he says and
[1:54:44] also you are joint hirs with
[1:54:47] Christ because him being a prophet he
[1:54:50] understands what it means means to be a
[1:54:53] joint Heir so Christ being the firstborn
[1:54:57] of a new
[1:54:58] creation you and I are not just only
[1:55:02] Born Into the family after his kind but
[1:55:06] we are connected to his
[1:55:10] inheritance the same inheritance that
[1:55:12] belongs to Christ belongs to you also
[1:55:15] amen you see so not only did God give
[1:55:19] you an inheritance but the inheritance
[1:55:21] that he gave himself in Christ he gave
[1:55:24] that to you
[1:55:26] also because Son of God Ministry is heir
[1:55:29] of all things son of man Ministry is
[1:55:33] heir of the earth and everything Adam
[1:55:37] lost so he has given you Christ has
[1:55:41] given you the double portion to The
[1:55:44] Inheritance not just air with God you go
[1:55:47] back and study those things not just air
[1:55:50] with God but everything that Christ has
[1:55:53] that's why when one day uh the sons of
[1:55:57] thunder the sons of Zebedee James and
[1:56:00] John and their mother their precious
[1:56:03] mother came to the Lord and she said
[1:56:08] Lord I have a
[1:56:11] request and the Lord said the Lord Jesus
[1:56:14] he said uhhuh how are you doing said I'm
[1:56:18] doing fine I got a request though he she
[1:56:21] said Lord saidwell go ahead what's what
[1:56:24] what's your request she said I'm
[1:56:26] designed that my two sons James and John
[1:56:31] they'll sit on the right hand and the
[1:56:33] left hand of you and your
[1:56:36] kingdom see that that's any Mother's
[1:56:39] Love they want their son sitting in a
[1:56:42] good
[1:56:43] position and brother Bri says in the
[1:56:45] message how can I overcome that Jesus
[1:56:47] said to her he said
[1:56:50] ma'am he said it's not for me to
[1:56:55] give but can they drink of the same cup
[1:56:58] that I drink of and Jesus said yeah
[1:57:01] Jesus said yes they will have to drink
[1:57:04] of that cup yes that's right but what
[1:57:06] you're
[1:57:07] asking that's only to the
[1:57:11] father brother brandham said he said
[1:57:15] that position to sit on his left hand or
[1:57:18] his right hand was not even a position
[1:57:22] position at that time that had not even
[1:57:24] come into
[1:57:26] view so the prophet of God
[1:57:29] said he said that
[1:57:32] position it was given to the bride of
[1:57:37] Christ at the End of the Age amen amen
[1:57:41] so it had not even been a position that
[1:57:45] could be given yet because God was still
[1:57:48] dealing with the Jews had not even moved
[1:57:51] into the Gentile
[1:57:52] dispensation to call them up Through the
[1:57:55] Ages that did not exist at that time but
[1:57:58] after Christ came and and called a
[1:58:01] gentile Bride for his name's sake then
[1:58:03] the position was created
[1:58:06] amen and Jesus says being the
[1:58:10] firstborn also understanding the law of
[1:58:13] the double portion to him that
[1:58:17] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:58:20] in my throne
[1:58:22] They will receive my inheritance also so
[1:58:26] you and I the Hees of God join HS with
[1:58:32] Christ the bride is moving in the
[1:58:35] position of Christ
[1:58:37] himself amen his authority his domain
[1:58:43] all that Adam lost Son of God heir of
[1:58:47] all things son of man heir of the earth
[1:58:50] and everything that Adam lost
[1:58:52] read the message it's all
[1:58:55] there heir to the the Royal Grant that's
[1:58:58] air to the Seed of Abraham brother
[1:59:01] Brandon brings those things out so the
[1:59:03] leadership of the Holy Ghost has to
[1:59:06] bring us in this time in the position to
[1:59:09] be raised up in Heavenly places seated
[1:59:12] with Christ in the position that God has
[1:59:15] given you before the foundation of the
[1:59:17] world amen amen and so just looking at
[1:59:22] these things before we go on so we see
[1:59:25] that the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:27] the leadership of the Holy Ghost that
[1:59:29] inward holy ghost that lives in your
[1:59:31] heart he must bring us to The Living
[1:59:34] reality and to the promises of God that
[1:59:37] are written for you in this hour
[1:59:41] amen and he's not going to fail he's
[1:59:45] going to do exactly what he said he's
[1:59:48] going to do if he only brings one out of
[1:59:50] this generation he he will keep his word
[1:59:53] you see amen so you and I being tutored
[1:59:56] and trained and taught to move into our
[1:59:59] inheritance because that's what the
[2:00:01] leadership of God is doing it's leading
[2:00:04] us and bringing us into an inheritance
[2:00:06] of eternal life out of of an immortal
[2:00:09] body and an immortal Spirit an immortal
[2:00:12] world and I will give you a new spirit
[2:00:14] and a new heart I'll give you a new body
[2:00:16] a new world a new Heaven and a new Earth
[2:00:18] a future home you see all of these
[2:00:21] things amen
[2:00:22] so we begin to be conscious of what the
[2:00:25] Holy Ghost is doing instead of church
[2:00:28] home Church home church church church oh
[2:00:32] Church
[2:00:33] home that's right Amen Let the Living
[2:00:37] God connect you to the realities of God
[2:00:41] then you'll see why you're here this
[2:00:43] morning that's right that's
[2:00:45] right so you see moving into the
[2:00:48] inheritance and being conscious and
[2:00:52] beginning to operate by the Revelation
[2:00:55] that's been given to you you are his
[2:00:57] victory God has not come down all this
[2:01:00] time from Genesis to Revelation to try
[2:01:03] to get somebody to love somebody he
[2:01:05] trying to get somebody to be a Son of
[2:01:08] God
[2:01:10] Amen that's right amen blessed be the
[2:01:13] name of the
[2:01:14] Lord God bless you brothers let's turn
[2:01:17] to Galatians chapter 4 praise His name

[2:01:22] thank you Lord so we
[2:01:26] see here in Romans chapter 8 we're going
[2:01:28] to Galatians 4 now but we see here the
[2:01:31] portion that we've read we see that this
[2:01:36] portion of the gospel Paul is speaking
[2:01:40] of the full
[2:01:42] results of the Gospel to the believer
[2:01:45] who is a son taking him into his
[2:01:48] inheritance amen amen so the AP Paul
[2:01:52] under the leadership writing these
[2:01:54] things for that people and for this end
[2:01:57] time people to let you know that you as
[2:02:00] a son are coming into full inheritance
[2:02:04] amen under this great leadership of the
[2:02:06] Holy
[2:02:08] Ghost so we see here in Galatians
[2:02:11] chapter 4 let me let me get over
[2:02:13] there starting at verse one you you know
[2:02:16] these
[2:02:19] things this great leadership now I
[2:02:22] say that the heir that's
[2:02:25] you an heir is an inheritor
[2:02:29] Jesus in the adoption
[2:02:33] series brother Brown says stay right
[2:02:36] there Galatians 41 in the adoption
[2:02:38] series brother Randon is preaching the
[2:02:40] adoption this message adoption is based
[2:02:44] on him going beyond the curtain of time
[2:02:45] and coming backen all you got to do is
[2:02:48] read the first few pages he said I'll
[2:02:50] never be the same what happened to to me
[2:02:52] that morning when God took me over there
[2:02:54] this whole adoption series is based on
[2:02:57] him going into his inheritance seeing
[2:03:00] those there and coming back and telling
[2:03:02] you the purpose of the Holy Ghost in
[2:03:05] your life was to bring you into this
[2:03:06] leadership
[2:03:08] amen
[2:03:11] Amen brother randam says in the adoption
[2:03:13] series thank you Lord he says but the
[2:03:16] purpose of this is seeing your position
[2:03:19] in Christ seeing your position in Christ
[2:03:24] seeing that it's not something that you
[2:03:26] just stumbled into who how many stumble
[2:03:29] into this how many say no I I just
[2:03:32] stumbled into it no you didn't stumble

[2:03:41] that's right this is only elect
[2:03:44] predestined for ordained for knowledge
[2:03:48] amen that's right this is by this is by
[2:03:52] the determinant counsel of almighty God
[2:03:55] that cannot change amen see so it's
[2:03:59] nothing that you stumbl into it was the
[2:04:01] grace of God that led us this way that's
[2:04:03] right so he says now thank you Jesus
[2:04:05] brother Brown says seeing this seeing
[2:04:08] that it's not something that you just
[2:04:09] stumbled into or something that you
[2:04:11] might that you merited somewhere how

[2:07:50] eternal life for a long time that's
[2:07:52] right brother amen I've already crossed
[2:07:54] over amen I'm already in the land
[2:08:01] amen oh my this is for the elect rich
[2:08:05] food right here everybody can't eat on
[2:08:08] thisen I ain't talking about me
[2:08:09] preaching I'm talking about the
[2:08:10] Revelation that's right A lot of people
[2:08:12] can't eat that that choke people to
[2:08:15] death because they they just only thing
[2:08:18] they stuck on is their flesh these five
[2:08:20] senses of the body yeah but I'm going to
[2:08:22] read to you where brother Brandon when
[2:08:25] he went beyond the curtain of time he
[2:08:26] looking into that Dimension where he
[2:08:28] just come from and he looking into this
[2:08:31] Dimension and his soul has transferred
[2:08:34] yes y'all didn't hear me his
[2:08:39] soul has left that
[2:08:41] body the
[2:08:44] terrestrial and now he's in the
[2:08:47] celestial
[2:08:49] amen and I'm telling you that the true
[2:08:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost in This Hour
[2:08:55] burst us into that land amen that's
[2:08:59] right even though we're still in this
[2:09:02] pest house in your soul you're in that
[2:09:05] land that's right amen that's right that
[2:09:08] ain't for everybody and I ain't worried
[2:09:10] about that like I when I preach I tell
[2:09:12] people I ain't mad at you only the elect
[2:09:15] can go into these things amen that's
[2:09:17] that's between God and them so if
[2:09:19] everybody turn around say well we don't
[2:09:21] even what you preaching brother Andre
[2:09:22] you know wining some kind of el
[2:09:25] intellectual or something that that
[2:09:26] ain't bothering me if somebody said well
[2:09:29] I can't see that that ain't bothering me
[2:09:31] I don't want to see you mad but that
[2:09:32] ain't bothering me because all that the
[2:09:35] father has given me Jesus said they will
[2:09:37] come to me that's right right so we we
[2:09:40] could be up all night crying oh I don't
[2:09:42] know why they ain't coming in oh I don't
[2:09:44] know why they ain't receive oh why can't
[2:09:45] they see it if they don't have eyes to
[2:09:47] see they can't see it that's right so
[2:09:49] why I'm going get mad at them that's
[2:09:50] right ain't mad at them I'm just gloring
[2:09:53] because he gave me eyes to see
[2:09:55] it amen and that he gave you eyes to see
[2:09:59] it thank you Jes so he says oh an
[2:10:01] inheritance somebody has to leave you
[2:10:03] something to inherit it is that right an
[2:10:06] inheritance what inheritance do we have
[2:10:10] what inheritance did I have brother
[2:10:12] Brown said I didn't have but God left me
[2:10:16] an inheritance when he put my name on
[2:10:18] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:10:20] foundation of the world Amen so before
[2:10:24] the foundation of the world God gave you
[2:10:26] an inheritance and eternal life in Jesus
[2:10:28] Christ and the Holy Ghost knowing that
[2:10:31] he's got a bride that will not go to the
[2:10:33] grave and a bride who's already in that
[2:10:35] sixth Dimension he's got to bring both
[2:10:37] of those group for when the fullness of
[2:10:39] time would come God would gather
[2:10:41] together those in heaven those in Earth
[2:10:44] all into Christ and to be made
[2:10:47] one and that's what the Holy Ghost is
[2:10:50] working on in our lives to bring us into
[2:10:52] that reality read just a little bit more
[2:10:55] now he says now what inheritance did I
[2:10:57] have I didn't have this is the adoption
[2:10:59] part four paragraph 72 but God left me
[2:11:02] an inheritance when he put my name on
[2:11:05] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:11:07] foundation of the world and he goes on
[2:11:09] he says now look has an inheritance look
[2:11:13] has
[2:11:14] predestinated us to an inheritance so
[2:11:18] here in Galatians chapter 4 now I say
[2:11:21] that the heir that's
[2:11:23] us as long as he is a child differs
[2:11:28] nothing from a
[2:11:30] servant
[2:11:32] though he be Lord of
[2:11:35] all so as long as he is a child the
[2:11:39] father has not adopted him and given him
[2:11:42] the full
[2:11:43] inheritance he gave Jesus full
[2:11:45] inheritance we see that in Matthew 17 on
[2:11:48] Mount
[2:11:49] Transfiguration he gives us us a for
[2:11:53] view of the great Millennium in those
[2:11:55] things in Revelations chap in in Matthew
[2:11:57] chapter 7 so we're not waiting to die to
[2:12:01] go into this
[2:12:05] inheritance we have pass from death into
[2:12:08] life amen we are in the
[2:12:12] immortal Revelation and the mind of God
[2:12:16] before the foundation of the world Amen
[2:12:19] and you didn't stumble into this you
[2:12:21] didn't Merit this you didn't learn this
[2:12:25] it's not because you twiddled your
[2:12:26] finger and say I'm humble nonsense
[2:12:30] humility is obedience to the word of
[2:12:33] God so he says here
[2:12:36] now he says but is under tutors and
[2:12:40] governors until the time appointed of
[2:12:42] the father so you know these things
[2:12:44] we're not going to go over but brother
[2:12:45] Bron the scripture says that this child
[2:12:49] is under tutors and governors unto the
[2:12:52] time
[2:12:53] appointed there's an appointed time in
[2:12:55] your life when you come to the fullness
[2:12:58] of this word led by the Holy Ghost as we
[2:13:00] said the Holy Ghost he doesn't Pat you
[2:13:02] on the shoulder and say good job it was
[2:13:04] nice working with you you was a good son
[2:13:07] and I've already told the father and
[2:13:09] you'll be all right I'll see you around
[2:13:13] sometime no no no the Holy Ghost raises
[2:13:16] you up all the way and then he
[2:13:18] incarnates in you amen and Jesus said
[2:13:23] the same one that led you he will abide
[2:13:25] with you forever
[2:13:27] amen then he who leads you and builds
[2:13:30] you up he comes himself IM morha
[2:13:33] breathes upon you the breath of eternal
[2:13:36] life amen and all that Adam lost brings
[2:13:41] you into the full authority of the word
[2:13:44] amen you say the full authority of the
[2:13:46] word the full authority of the word not
[2:13:51] only are you hes you have become joint
[2:13:55] hes with Christ hallelujah hallelujah is
[2:14:00] the right word he says
[2:14:03] now verse three even so we when we were
[2:14:06] children were in the bondage under the
[2:14:09] elements of the world and we were we
[2:14:11] were under the bond bondage of the
[2:14:12] elements of the world we didn't know
[2:14:15] Christ we didn't know the fullness of
[2:14:17] the word we didn't know that we had an
[2:14:19] inheritance we didn't know that we was a
[2:14:21] part of a bride we didn't know any of
[2:14:23] these
[2:14:25] things but when the fullness of time but
[2:14:28] when the fullness of time was come God
[2:14:31] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[2:14:33] under the law to redeem them that were
[2:14:37] under the law that we might receive the
[2:14:40] adoption or the placing of sons amen so
[2:14:45] what what is he saying brother Andre we
[2:14:47] who were
[2:14:48] children yet we had an inh heritance in
[2:14:52] God but we had to be raised and come to
[2:14:55] maturity and be tried and tested to the
[2:14:58] father brother Brenham said in the Old
[2:15:00] Testament he would take that son into a
[2:15:01] hill or a mountain above all the people
[2:15:04] there and he would say to the people
[2:15:06] this day I am adopting my son he's not
[2:15:09] going to adopt any other person's son he
[2:15:13] only adopts his own Sons and
[2:15:16] Daughters not all grow up into the
[2:15:18] fullness but those that come to the
[2:15:21] predestinated course that God has given
[2:15:24] them
[2:15:26] amen then he
[2:15:30] says
[2:15:32] son and the message what is the Holy
[2:15:35] Ghost brother Brandon says the father he
[2:15:38] presents his son there and he moves back
[2:15:41] and he says now I've given all authority
[2:15:45] to the
[2:15:48] son hear ye him amen
[2:15:51] amen the last invitation you Bible

[2:18:37] here so we see here in the scriptures
[2:18:40] let me let me get to
[2:18:42] it I'm sorry Revelations
[2:18:48] 22 so how can
[2:18:52] someone without
[2:18:54] access being the last invitation of the
[2:18:59] Bible in Revelations
[2:19:03] 22 verse
[2:19:06] 17 and the
[2:19:09] spirit and the bride say come
[2:19:14] amen this is the last invitation in the
[2:19:17] bible let him that heareth say
[2:19:22] come and let him that is a thirst come
[2:19:27] and whosoever will let him take the
[2:19:30] Water of Life
[2:19:33] freely how can the
[2:19:36] bride without access of the
[2:19:40] spirit say these things and they just be
[2:19:44] empty words no no no no this is a
[2:19:48] people that God has ra raised himself
[2:19:52] given them hes of God join HS with
[2:19:55] Christ and have placed them in the
[2:19:57] position to say if any man
[2:20:00] thirst let him
[2:20:02] come and take of the Water of Life
[2:20:05] freely amen you say well I don't believe
[2:20:08] that then go to the Catholic church and
[2:20:09] ask them see if they see if they can
[2:20:12] direct you to life go to the Methodist
[2:20:16] go to the Pentecostal see if they can
[2:20:18] give you
[2:20:19] life
[2:20:21] the seed only comes through the
[2:20:23] body life is in the
[2:20:26] bride where is life if life ain't in the
[2:20:29] brde where is it what denominational
[2:20:31] Church where's it
[2:20:34] at so we see here the last invitation
[2:20:38] the bride under her prophet's message is
[2:20:42] the final voice to the final age amen
[2:20:46] she only and she alone has the message
[2:20:50] of the hour power that can give life
[2:20:54] it's not her giving life it's the word
[2:20:56] that gives life but she directs them to
[2:21:00] the word and to the F you
[2:21:02] see hallu so the
[2:21:05] inheritance that God has brought you
[2:21:08] into is a living
[2:21:11] reality and not just somebody trying to
[2:21:13] get worked up but people who have been
[2:21:17] led into this position and made
[2:21:20] conscious
[2:21:21] of the reality that has been given to
[2:21:24] them amen amen you see that's why you
[2:21:27] are his victory here at the end time
[2:21:30] let's go back real quick now to
[2:21:31] Galatians chapter
[2:21:33] 4 verse
[2:21:36] 5 to redeem them that were under the law
[2:21:40] that we might receive the placing of
[2:21:43] sons to receive the adoption of son
[2:21:47] remember that father y'all already know
[2:21:49] this he brings that son up to a mountain
[2:21:51] he throws his robe over
[2:21:55] him he gives him the robe of
[2:21:58] righteousness amen and then he
[2:22:02] takes the wedding
[2:22:04] band of unmerited
[2:22:07] Grace and he places it on his finger
[2:22:12] amen he has the
[2:22:14] robe he has the Seal of the father
[2:22:19] Hallelujah his name on the the check is
[2:22:22] just as good as the father and that's
[2:22:24] why forever we read the scriptures ask
[2:22:26] anything in my name I'll do it he ain't
[2:22:28] talking he talking to adopted children
[2:22:31] amen that's why through they well God I
[2:22:33] ask in your name I didn't receive it and
[2:22:36] Jesus
[2:22:37] said ask
[2:22:40] anything these adopted
[2:22:42] children these children that had come to
[2:22:45] the
[2:22:45] position they have the
[2:22:48] ring they have The Robe
[2:22:51] and they're not going to ask anything
[2:22:52] out of his will because that Holy Ghost
[2:22:56] has grow them up into sons of the father
[2:22:59] Hallelujah they know exactly what the
[2:23:01] father wants done amen because why he
[2:23:05] dwells in them prise the Lord and they
[2:23:09] ain't running out doing all kind of
[2:23:11] things trying to impress nobody who God
[2:23:13] trying to impress you God and you done
[2:23:16] created everything who you trying to
[2:23:17] impress who you who you got respect for
[2:23:23] you
[2:23:24] God he ain't respect of no person he
[2:23:27] created all persons you see right so God
[2:23:33] bringing you who are genes and spirit of
[2:23:38] his
[2:23:39] attribute not somebody that stumbled
[2:23:41] into something somebody that done a good
[2:23:45] work we're talking about A different
[2:23:48] race than your mom and dadd is

[2:23:54] seed we're talking about the bride of

[2:29:56] back to what you were and your father
[2:29:59] before the foundation of the world okay
[2:30:02] I'm going to read a couple of places
[2:30:04] from the
[2:30:05] message and then we're going to close I
[2:30:08] I'm trying to figure out what time it
[2:30:10] might
[2:30:12] be
[2:30:13] and but but ain't nobody snoring yet so
[2:30:17] I'm going to go a little
[2:30:18] farther
[2:30:20] in the message bear with me
[2:30:24] now let's go back to Romans chapter 8
[2:30:26] and we're just going to move on I'm not
[2:30:28] going to try to say I'm just going to
[2:30:29] read in Romans chapter 8 verse
[2:30:32] 28 for we know that all things work
[2:30:35] together for good to them that love God
[2:30:37] to them who are the called according to
[2:30:40] his purpose and I like what I've learned
[2:30:42] from Central when I quote that it
[2:30:44] doesn't say all things are good it says
[2:30:47] all things are working together for for
[2:30:50] your good so you you we all been through
[2:30:53] things that were not good that were
[2:30:54] terrible that were bad but it's all
[2:30:57] working together for our good you see
[2:31:01] for whom he did for know this is a great
[2:31:03] forn knowledge of God that went out he
[2:31:05] also did
[2:31:07] predestinate listen now look at that
[2:31:09] with me maybe I've got a Scofield bible
[2:31:12] maybe your Bible's different but the
[2:31:14] scripture says for whom he did for know
[2:31:17] that's the forn knowledge of God he also
[2:31:19] o did
[2:31:21] predestinate does yours have a period
[2:31:24] after predestinate anybody Bible got a
[2:31:26] period after predestinate mine doesn't
[2:31:29] either what about a comma mine doesn't
[2:31:32] either so we're going to keep going with
[2:31:34] this word
[2:31:36] predestinate
[2:31:39] amen moreover whom he did
[2:31:42] predestinate them excuse verse 29 for
[2:31:44] whom he did for know he also did
[2:31:47] predestinate to be formed into formed to
[2:31:52] the image of his dear son so when we
[2:31:56] hear around the message are you
[2:31:58] predestinated yeah I'm predestinated are
[2:31:59] you predestinated yeah I'm predestinated
[2:32:01] what about you you predestinated well
[2:32:03] predestination means something to a
[2:32:05] Believer amen because your
[2:32:08] predestination is to be conformed to the
[2:32:13] image of his dear son Hallelujah so just
[2:32:16] somebody walking around in message say
[2:32:18] praise God I'm predestinated are you
[2:32:20] predestinated yeah I'm predestinated are
[2:32:22] you predestin yeah I'm predestinated and
[2:32:23] they don't even know what they
[2:32:24] predestinate to they just say I'm
[2:32:27] predestinated so the bride's
[2:32:29] predestination in this new creation is
[2:32:32] predestinated to be conformed into the
[2:32:35] image of his dear son amen amen so just
[2:32:39] because somebody say I'm predestinated
[2:32:40] and don't know that the predestination
[2:32:43] for the bride is to be conformed into
[2:32:45] the image of his dear son amen praise
[2:32:48] the Lord Brother Matthew was sharing
[2:32:50] wonderful I enjoyed that last night he
[2:32:52] was talking to me and sharing with me
[2:32:54] about predestination and he said you
[2:32:56] know predestination is like maybe a ship
[2:32:58] that leaves New York is going to a
[2:33:00] certain destination and maybe England I
[2:33:03] forgot how he used it and he said if
[2:33:05] you've got your token and you're on that
[2:33:07] ship that ship is not it might be going
[2:33:10] slow however but it's destination like
[2:33:14] let's just say from from St John's to
[2:33:16] England that sh you being on that ship
[2:33:19] that ship is taking you to your
[2:33:21] destination amen you going
[2:33:24] there see you might be on the ship
[2:33:26] walking around seeing many days and and
[2:33:29] and all kind of waves and storms and
[2:33:31] everything but that ship taking you to
[2:33:33] that destination that's right pre the
[2:33:36] power of predestination is not you and I
[2:33:39] but the Holy Ghost working mightily in
[2:33:42] your life to bring you to the fullness
[2:33:45] of the word that he has predestinated
[2:33:47] you to right so God the operation of the
[2:33:51] Holy Ghost groan groaning in you causing
[2:33:55] you to groan for that great theophany to
[2:33:58] be clothed upon bringing you to the
[2:34:01] great predestination that you are to be
[2:34:03] conformed into the image of his dear
[2:34:07] son so if somebody tells me brother
[2:34:10] Andre I'm predestinated well praise the
[2:34:11] Lord but do you know what you're
[2:34:12] predestinated to amen so I'm
[2:34:15] predestinated to eternal life but what
[2:34:16] is that that is to be conformed right
[2:34:20] into the image of his dear son praise
[2:34:22] the Lord amen for whom he did for know
[2:34:25] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[2:34:28] to the image of his dear son that he
[2:34:31] might be the
[2:34:33] firstborn among many Brethren he is the
[2:34:36] sheath wave the wave sheath he is the
[2:34:41] the the brother brandham said he is the
[2:34:43] the original wheat seed of God you see
[2:34:47] he is the one at 's race fell and went
[2:34:51] into sin for by one man's disobedient
[2:34:54] were all men made Sinners but by one man
[2:34:58] obedient we are made righteous through
[2:35:01] his
[2:35:02] obedience oh my you see so we being not
[2:35:07] under Adam brother brandham said under
[2:35:09] Adam you was represented in heaven as a
[2:35:11] sinner but under
[2:35:14] Christ you're
[2:35:16] represented as a son of the Living God
[2:35:19] amen that's
[2:35:21] right
[2:35:23] amen do you know where you're standing
[2:35:25] this morning listen
[2:35:28] now he uh more of whom he did
[2:35:31] predestinate them he also
[2:35:34] called and whom he
[2:35:36] called them he also Justified and whom
[2:35:40] he justified them he also glorified
[2:35:43] praise the Lord and the message who is
[2:35:44] this
[2:35:45] mzc brother banam
[2:35:47] says going me get this this real quick
[2:35:51] here yes here we go right here in the
[2:35:55] message who is this
[2:35:57] mzc get here
[2:36:01] real y'all bear with me one moment I've
[2:36:05] got a new who is this mzc book because
[2:36:08] the one I had before I just wore it
[2:36:10] outen brother Brown says he's talking
[2:36:14] about about
[2:36:16] predestination he says
[2:36:18] now talking about the
[2:36:21] elect he says
[2:36:24] now the
[2:36:26] predestinated is the only one that's
[2:36:30] considered in
[2:36:32] Redemption only those that are
[2:36:35] predestinated are the ones that are
[2:36:38] considered in Redemption because
[2:36:41] remember we what we said the bride's
[2:36:42] predestination is to be conformed into
[2:36:44] the image of his dear son Amen to move
[2:36:46] into your inheritance all of these
[2:36:49] things listen and let's see if the
[2:36:50] Prophet vindicates this he said now the
[2:36:53] predes he said did you get it let me say
[2:36:56] that again the predestinated is the only
[2:37:00] one that's considered in Redemption
[2:37:03] people might be making like think they
[2:37:06] are but the real Redemption is those
[2:37:09] that are predestinated because the very
[2:37:12] word redeem means to bring back see is
[2:37:16] that right to redeem something to redeem
[2:37:19] deem anything is to bring it back to its
[2:37:22] original Place Hallelujah brother
[2:37:25] brandom says so it's only the
[2:37:28] predestinated will be brought back
[2:37:31] because others did not come from there
[2:37:34] you see bring
[2:37:36] back being Eternal with him at the
[2:37:39] beginning the eternal life that you had
[2:37:42] his thoughts of what you was only he
[2:37:46] wanted he wanted me to stand in the pool
[2:37:49] pit he wanted you to sit in the seat
[2:37:52] then we are serving his eternal purpose
[2:37:55] amen the one listen now the one that
[2:37:59] left home that's you only come to the
[2:38:03] Earth to serve his
[2:38:08] purpose W
[2:38:11] powerful he says
[2:38:14] now he won't he says the then then we
[2:38:17] are and the one that left home only come
[2:38:21] to Earth to serve his purpose is that
[2:38:23] right he says all right then after it's
[2:38:27] finished after you have served your
[2:38:29] purpose it's brought back to a glorified
[2:38:32] State it's matured and brought back
[2:38:34] again brought back
[2:38:37] home
[2:38:39] my now we now we in the message amen now
[2:38:42] we in the message no wonder Paul could
[2:38:45] say when he was uh when they was
[2:38:47] building the block to chop off chop his
[2:38:50] head off he said oh
[2:38:52] death where's your stin oh grave where's
[2:38:56] your Victory but thanks be to God who
[2:38:59] gives us the victory he said death tell
[2:39:02] me where you can make me holler cuz I'm
[2:39:05] going home amen because I have a
[2:39:08] theophany because I went to the third
[2:39:11] heaven and I saw and heard things that
[2:39:14] are not lawful for man to utter I've
[2:39:17] been
[2:39:18] there see Paul one preaching by
[2:39:21] intellect he said I receive this by
[2:39:23] Revelation Amen in second in 2
[2:39:25] Corinthians chapter 12 there he said I
[2:39:28] don't know if I was in the body or out
[2:39:29] of the body God knows but I was caught
[2:39:32] up to the third heaven and I heard words
[2:39:35] that were not even lawful to be uttered
[2:39:39] brother brandom in his translation he
[2:39:40] said I went to the first Heaven he said
[2:39:42] Paul went to the third
[2:39:44] heaven amen hallelujah my what a
[2:39:48] heritage
[2:39:50] what an
[2:39:51] inheritance what God has invested in you
[2:39:54] and I he says here he says grave how can
[2:39:59] uh grave tell me how you're going to
[2:40:01] hold me for I am a possessor of eternal
[2:40:05] life amen he recognized that death Hell
[2:40:08] In The Grave nothing could hold him and
[2:40:10] nothing can hurt
[2:40:12] us God eternal life he realized he was
[2:40:15] blessed with eternal life just like
[2:40:18] brother Brown says just like like a a
[2:40:19] little do drop everybody know what a
[2:40:21] little do drop is that little moisture
[2:40:23] that sometime it'll settled on the
[2:40:25] clothes line or something early in the
[2:40:26] morning he said just like a little do
[2:40:28] drop if I understand I don't know much
[2:40:31] about chemistry but it must be that it's
[2:40:34] the celing of humidity or atmosphere and
[2:40:37] when night gets cold and dark it falls
[2:40:41] from heaven and drops upon the ground it
[2:40:44] fell from
[2:40:46] somewhere but the next morning before
[2:40:48] the sun comes up it's laying there the
[2:40:51] little fella shivering but just let the
[2:40:54] sun come up and watch it go to shining
[2:40:58] it's happy why the Sun is going to call
[2:41:01] it back to where it was from the
[2:41:05] beginning and that's the way brother
[2:41:07] Brown says and that's the way with a
[2:41:09] Christian Hallelujah we know when we
[2:41:11] walk into the presence of God something
[2:41:14] in US tells us that we come from
[2:41:16] somewhere amen and that we're going back
[2:41:19] Again by the power that's pulling us he
[2:41:22] says the little DW d drop he glistens he
[2:41:25] shines he shouts because he knows he
[2:41:27] come from up there and the Sun is going
[2:41:30] to draw him right back again and a man
[2:41:32] that's an attribute of God born of God
[2:41:35] knows Hallelujah when he comes in
[2:41:37] contact with the Son of God he's going
[2:41:40] to be draw back up somewhere to where he
[2:41:43] was as Jesus said if I be lifted up I
[2:41:46] will draw all men unto me Hallelujah
[2:41:49] hallelujah praise the lord we see the
[2:41:53] mighty power of God working in our life
[2:41:56] to predestinate to conform us into the
[2:41:59] image of his dear son under the
[2:42:03] leadership of the Holy Spirit and the
[2:42:05] message things that are to be I'm
[2:42:07] closing I'm winding now brother B I'm
[2:42:09] talking about us being built up in the
[2:42:11] word he said like a germ coming into a
[2:42:14] womb of a woman and that word coming
[2:42:17] into your womb amen amen you who are
[2:42:20] predestinated with the representation of
[2:42:23] eternal life giving ears to hear eyes to
[2:42:26] see heart to
[2:42:27] believe like a germ coming into a womb
[2:42:30] of a woman with egg and when and when
[2:42:33] that little egg begins to develop it
[2:42:36] begins to bring forth
[2:42:38] germs but it don't put one human germ
[2:42:41] and a dog germ and a cow germ it puts
[2:42:45] all human germ and when a child of God
[2:42:50] when that predestinated that's a bad
[2:42:53] word to use but it's God here is God's
[2:42:57] Bible the for knowledge of God can
[2:43:00] predestinate make everything work to his
[2:43:03] honor and when that predestinated seed
[2:43:06] that you were supposed to
[2:43:09] be when that predestinated
[2:43:13] seed that you were supposed to be
[2:43:19] amen you bypass that but the
[2:43:23] predestination of
[2:43:25] God not this pest
[2:43:29] house but the house of God and the
[2:43:32] glorification the theophany what you
[2:43:36] were supposed to be he says
[2:43:41] now he says now the forn knowledge of
[2:43:44] God can predestinate make everything
[2:43:46] work to his honor when that
[2:43:47] predestinated seed that you was supposed
[2:43:49] to be and God called you and that little
[2:43:52] germ of life in there heard the word of
[2:43:55] God it began to build on word on top of
[2:43:58] word one on top of the other on top of
[2:44:01] the other on top of the other on top of
[2:44:03] the other one it'll not mix with any
[2:44:06] Creed then God building you up into
[2:44:09] himself that germ that you were supposed
[2:44:12] to be brother brandham says in an
[2:44:14] invisible Union of the BR broad it found
[2:44:16] you that germ found you you see found it
[2:44:19] no no no it found you you see and how
[2:44:22] thankful we are for that just a little
[2:44:24] bit more now we we moving real quick now
[2:44:28] brother brandom says
[2:44:31] here and I believe that's paragraph 21
[2:44:35] just going to go as fast as we can
[2:44:38] brother Brown says now listen
[2:44:42] now he says your birth here was
[2:44:44] pre-planned
[2:44:47] I guess you believe that every one of
[2:44:50] you knows that your birth was
[2:44:53] pre-planned did you know that your being
[2:44:56] here never originated just a myth or a
[2:44:59] thought everything was pre-planned
[2:45:02] by God Amen everything pre-planned by
[2:45:08] God he
[2:45:09] says before the foundation of the world
[2:45:12] you would he said he knew you would be
[2:45:14] here the infinite God know that because
[2:45:17] he predestinated you to be here he goes
[2:45:21] on he says now you were all pre-planned
[2:45:24] by God nothing happened by chance with
[2:45:27] God he knows all about it it's all
[2:45:30] pre-planned planned from many
[2:45:32] generations back so that you would be
[2:45:34] here this morning did you know that that
[2:45:36] is true just think of that you at one
[2:45:39] time I'll repeat this again you at one
[2:45:42] time was in your father in the gene of
[2:45:44] your father now he didn't know you at
[2:45:46] that time neither did you know him at
[2:45:48] that time but you see then you were put
[2:45:51] into the beding ground of the womb of
[2:45:53] your mother through holy wedlock and
[2:45:55] then you become a person expressed into
[2:45:58] the image like your father then you have
[2:46:01] Fellowship as we said the other day just
[2:46:04] like that child being born into Earth
[2:46:05] brought on to different leaders and
[2:46:07] everything he's never been in the earth
[2:46:08] before he's being introduced to a new
[2:46:11] world that he knows nothing about and
[2:46:13] the Holy Ghost introducing you to a new
[2:46:15] world that you know nothing about but if
[2:46:17] your mind is just on temporal things
[2:46:18] you'll never know about that
[2:46:20] world you see so he says here now the
[2:46:25] only way that you can be a son and
[2:46:26] daughter of God is because you have to
[2:46:29] have eternal life there's only one form
[2:46:31] of eternal life and that's God's life
[2:46:35] amen only one form of eternal life that
[2:46:38] was God see not just everybody running
[2:46:41] around talking about I got God life and
[2:46:43] a ain't no evidence of God life in them
[2:46:45] at all just
[2:46:47] quoting see
[2:46:50] yeah when when Jesus the this the
[2:46:53] Pharisees were going to try to Stone him
[2:46:56] he said for what good work do you Stone
[2:46:58] me for Healing The Sick opening eyes of
[2:47:02] the blind raising the dead what good
[2:47:05] work are you going to Stone me for they
[2:47:07] said no no no you being a man make
[2:47:10] yourself God he didn't make himself God
[2:47:13] God made him
[2:47:16] God see and God makes you Sons and
[2:47:19] Daughters of his Spirit praise the Lord
[2:47:22] he says now and there's only one form of
[2:47:24] eternal life that's God's life only one
[2:47:27] form of eternal life that was God there
[2:47:30] to be a Son of God you had to be in him
[2:47:35] always not your being but the thought of
[2:47:39] that he had for you amen you see the
[2:47:43] gene listen the gene of your life
[2:47:47] spiritual was in God the Father before
[2:47:51] ever a molecube before anything else the
[2:47:55] gene of your spiritual life now if I ask
[2:47:59] you who your daddy is you say this is my
[2:48:01] daddy brother Andre this is the picture
[2:48:02] of our family then I said well what was
[2:48:04] the gene of your life you say my daddy I
[2:48:08] said that's right what about before your
[2:48:10] daddy say my granddaddy said that's
[2:48:13] right what about for your granddaddy you
[2:48:15] said my great granddaddy I said how you
[2:48:18] know that you because Apostle Paul and a
[2:48:20] prophet of God begin to show the lineage
[2:48:24] naturally when he said that when mzc
[2:48:27] came to Abraham that Levi who was in the
[2:48:31] loins of
[2:48:33] Abraham Isaac Jacob the 12 tribes amen
[2:48:38] already there then Paul that great
[2:48:43] prophet he could take those things and
[2:48:46] pick up like he did Abraham seek the
[2:48:47] city whose building make is God we only
[2:48:49] read that only know that because the
[2:48:52] Apostle Paul in the faith chapter tell
[2:48:54] us Abraham was looking for that City
[2:48:57] amen because he was a prophet amen he
[2:49:00] could bring these things out show these
[2:49:02] things because he went to the third
[2:49:03] heaven he knew what it was to be in in a
[2:49:08] theophany because he had left his body
[2:49:11] like brother brandham had left his body
[2:49:13] and he saw a whole different
[2:49:16] dimension and begin to tell us
[2:49:19] that your original state was in God
[2:49:24] before the foundation of the world and
[2:49:26] when Jesus came you had representation
[2:49:29] the traits of your father that's why he
[2:49:30] uses the spirit of Elijah five times it
[2:49:33] is the handing down amen amen it is the
[2:49:37] masculine he says here
[2:49:39] now he says then the gene of your life
[2:49:42] spiritual was in God before the
[2:49:45] foundation of the world we're closing
[2:49:49] down now got these two out of the way
[2:49:51] got these two out of the way uh bear
[2:49:54] with me y'all with me this morning amen
[2:49:57] and and and I know I know that the mind
[2:50:00] can only take so much I know that but I
[2:50:03] know this is Sunday and then Wednesday
[2:50:05] I'm gone but I know the Holy Spirit can
[2:50:07] do what he wants to do then then I'm not
[2:50:11] talking about the mental I must be
[2:50:12] talking about the spiritual mind see
[2:50:15] then I know the holy ghost that live in
[2:50:16] you I can bring him these things he can
[2:50:19] bring back to your remembrance these
[2:50:20] things amen that is right brother
[2:50:24] brandham in the message the rejected
[2:50:28] King listen
[2:50:31] now this message here the rejected
[2:50:40] King
[2:50:45] okay and the message rejected King
[2:50:47] brother Bram says
[2:50:50] now let's pick it up right
[2:50:54] here he says
[2:50:56] now this is this is before my church or
[2:51:01] my sheep that I'm
[2:51:03] pastoring he's quoting the Apostle Paul
[2:51:06] now whether it was I was in this body or
[2:51:10] not or out whether it was
[2:51:14] translation it wasn't like any Vision I
[2:51:18] ever ever
[2:51:19] had I could look
[2:51:22] there and I could look
[2:51:25] here his soul had
[2:51:28] left the terrestrial the Earthly body
[2:51:33] and his soul had moved into his
[2:51:35] theophany and brother bham said I could
[2:51:38] look into this Dimension and I could
[2:51:41] look into this Dimension I could look
[2:51:43] there and see my body laying on the bed
[2:51:46] beside my wife and I could look here and
[2:51:48] see these
[2:51:50] people his
[2:51:52] soul had traveled into the house of God
[2:51:57] that the Holy Ghost is building around
[2:51:59] your Born Again experience amen under
[2:52:02] the leadership of the
[2:52:04] word people looking for a Rapture and
[2:52:07] they don't even know what the Rapture by
[2:52:09] that's right that's right people looking
[2:52:11] for a Rapture and holding these quotes
[2:52:12] and don't know that the Holy Ghost is
[2:52:14] making these things a reality amen so
[2:52:18] how
[2:52:19] how we going to make the Rapture without
[2:52:21] the Holy Ghost you can't you you might
[2:52:24] say well I'm just a little child but God
[2:52:26] he g a holy ghost to little children too
[2:52:29] one day when they asked Jesus who is the
[2:52:31] greatest in the
[2:52:33] Kingdom you know what Jesus did he went
[2:52:36] over he saw a little child and he
[2:52:39] grabbed a little child's hand and he
[2:52:42] said I say unto
[2:52:43] thee except you be converted and become
[2:52:47] as a little child amen you shall not
[2:52:51] enter into the kingdom amen so maybe the
[2:52:54] maybe them big intellectual John say J
[2:52:57] knew I know he gonna come over to me
[2:52:59] when they say who is the greatest in the
[2:53:01] Kingdom Jesus bypassed them all he
[2:53:04] didn't even grab one of his disciples in
[2:53:06] cuz they had not been converted at the
[2:53:07] time amen and he said except you be
[2:53:10] converted and become as a
[2:53:11] child you can't even enter in the
[2:53:13] kingdom of God Amen so he says brother
[2:53:17] brandham says
[2:53:20] he says it wasn't like any Vision I had
[2:53:24] I could look there and I could look
[2:53:26] here and when I hit that little place I
[2:53:31] never seen so many people come running
[2:53:34] and screaming oh our precious
[2:53:38] brother ain't that something else he
[2:53:40] said he could
[2:53:42] look here at his body on the bed and he
[2:53:46] could look there you say why that's
[2:53:48] something brother Andre because brother
[2:53:49] Brown say at the time of the
[2:53:50] Resurrection only the elect will be able
[2:53:52] to see those resurrected ones amen so
[2:53:56] they looking here and looking there amen
[2:53:59] it's the soul that's been converted and
[2:54:02] made Eternal that holds the life of God
[2:54:06] life of God ain't just living with a
[2:54:08] heartbeat it is the very character
[2:54:11] attributes authority of God
[2:54:14] Amen he said I never seen so many people
[2:54:17] come running screaming oh my precious
[2:54:18] brother and I looked and young women
[2:54:20] maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20 they
[2:54:23] were throwing their arms around me and
[2:54:25] screaming our precious brother here come
[2:54:28] young men in the Brilliance of of Young
[2:54:30] Manhood their eyes glistening and
[2:54:32] looking like stars on The Dark Night
[2:54:35] their teeth white as Pearl listen to his
[2:54:37] words now and they were screaming and
[2:54:39] grabbing me and screaming oh our
[2:54:42] precious brother and I stopped and I
[2:54:44] looked and I was
[2:54:47] young
[2:54:48] amen what the what what what is the Holy
[2:54:51] Ghost leading you to old
[2:54:54] age I'm talking about in the spiritual
[2:54:56] real now to be little babies remember
[2:55:00] there ain't no babies we the first night
[2:55:02] we talked about that Sharon Rosa all Dy
[2:55:04] they ain't got no babies up here God was
[2:55:07] connecting his Prophet to a reality amen
[2:55:10] listen now and I stand to be
[2:55:13] corrected brother Brandon was not
[2:55:16] ready in that condition when he lost his
[2:55:18] wife and baby to understand 1
[2:55:21] Thessalonians 5 if this Earthly
[2:55:23] Tabernacle be dissolved amen he wasn't
[2:55:25] ready for
[2:55:26] that so God had to keep raising his son
[2:55:31] raising his son I don't mean just lift
[2:55:33] him up like somebody on a fork lift lift
[2:55:35] up some package I'm talking about like a
[2:55:37] parents raise their child like God
[2:55:39] raising you so God had to take this
[2:55:41] Prophet at that time because remember he
[2:55:44] talking about wanting to see hope at
[2:55:46] that time that that's his wife there he
[2:55:50] lost his wife so he lost his little baby
[2:55:54] so God being gracious to his Prophet
[2:55:57] when he brings him up here in 1960 when
[2:56:00] the prophet is ready to understand these
[2:56:02] things and bring these things to the
[2:56:03] Brad brother bandam in that theop form
[2:56:06] he looking for his first
[2:56:08] wife he looking for

[2:56:14] those women you know how brother Brown
[2:56:16] said a man shouldn't hug up to any woman
[2:56:17] except it be his wife explain all that
[2:56:19] but he said there there was no sex
[2:56:21] glands like that and any of those things
[2:56:23] no perversion of the mind that Satan
[2:56:25] just crams us with all the time tries to
[2:56:27] condemn us just cast them away because
[2:56:30] that's just nonsense San Will T brother
[2:56:33] Bown said Jesus was tempted with all
[2:56:34] that too see so don't don't don't you be
[2:56:37] condemned just don't don't build a
[2:56:39] burdess them thoughts come by you say
[2:56:41] Lord get out of here L Lord know that
[2:56:43] ain't you that's just how the human
[2:56:45] realm is and stuff like that but this
[2:56:48] Prophet looking for his first wife to
[2:56:51] come all these people running and
[2:56:53] screaming and everything when hope
[2:56:56] comes he looking at Hope like this I
[2:57:00] know she gonna say my husband my husband
[2:57:02] and he gonna say my wife a good to see
[2:57:04] where Sharon Rose's at she ain't
[2:57:07] thinking about that she running to

[2:57:11] sisters then she run to brother she look
[2:57:13] at brother Brown oh my precious brother

[2:57:21] a first husband she ain't stud in that
[2:57:25] she in a higher life
[2:57:28] form love now that look listen I ain't

[2:57:35] ain't never been there maybe you been
[2:57:36] there you come up here and tell me I'm
[2:57:39] just saying what brother brandham said
[2:57:41] so somebody say well that's what brother
[2:57:42] Andre said well how he said he was
[2:57:44] reading from the message but you might
[2:57:46] know maybe you've been translated so you

[2:58:06] I looked and I was young I looked back
[2:58:09] at my old body laying there with my
[2:58:11] hands behind my head and I said I don't
[2:58:14] understand this and these women throwing
[2:58:15] their arms around me now I do realize
[2:58:18] this is a mixed audience and I say this
[2:58:20] with sweetness with the mellowness of
[2:58:22] the spirit men cannot put your arm
[2:58:24] around a woman without a human sensation
[2:58:27] amen but there wasn't but it wasn't
[2:58:31] there there was no con sensation there
[2:58:34] there was no yesterday nor tomorrow they
[2:58:38] didn't get tired they never I've never
[2:58:41] seen such pretty women in all my life
[2:58:44] they had hair all the way down to their
[2:58:47] waistline long skirts to their feet and
[2:58:51] they were hugging me and it and it
[2:58:53] wasn't a hug like even my own sister
[2:58:56] sitting there would hug me they were not
[2:58:58] kissing me I was not kissing them I it
[2:59:01] was something i' I have not got a
[2:59:04] vocabulary he says I haven't got words
[2:59:07] to say it Perfection wouldn't touch it
[2:59:10] superb wouldn't even touch it nowhere
[2:59:13] it's something that I never you just
[2:59:15] have to be there amen
[2:59:18] and I looked this way and that way and
[2:59:21] they were coming by the thousands and I
[2:59:23] said now I don't understand this I said
[2:59:26] why then here they come hope my first
[2:59:29] wife she run never said my
[2:59:37] husband hope my first wife she run never
[2:59:40] said my husband she said my precious
[2:59:44] brother and when she hugged me there was
[2:59:47] another woman standing there she hugged
[2:59:49] me then hugged this woman and each one
[2:59:51] of them they went
[2:59:54] on now when when his wife had died way
[2:59:57] back there and here little
[3:00:00] girl he was distraught he wasn't ready
[3:00:03] for this he had to grow into this you
[3:00:09] see I thought oh this has to be
[3:00:12] something different it can't there's
[3:00:14] something I thought oh would I ever want
[3:00:17] oh
[3:00:18] would I ever want to go back to that old
[3:00:21] carcass again he's thinking he looking
[3:00:24] at his body on that bed that old dead
[3:00:26] carcass he said do I have to go back to
[3:00:29] that thing
[3:00:31] again he
[3:00:33] says I looked around there and I thought
[3:00:35] what is this and I looked real good and
[3:00:38] I said I can't understand this but hope
[3:00:41] seemed to be oh a guest of honor she was
[3:00:43] no different but just another guest of
[3:00:46] honor and I heard a voice then listen to
[3:00:49] him now and I Heard a Voice
[3:00:52] then that spoke to
[3:00:55] me that was in the room
[3:00:59] said
[3:01:01] this is what you
[3:01:03] preached was the Holy
[3:01:07] Ghost amen then what am I preaching is
[3:01:11] the Holy Ghost be good to your
[3:01:14] neighbor no I'm preaching the same thing
[3:01:19] that he went
[3:01:22] into the same Holy Ghost how many Holy
[3:01:26] Ghost are
[3:01:29] there and I Heard a Voice then that
[3:01:33] spoke to me that was in the room said
[3:01:37] this is what you preach was the Holy
[3:01:42] Ghost this is perfect
[3:01:45] love amen and I am
[3:01:49] determined than ever in my life that it
[3:01:53] takes perfect love to enter
[3:02:02] there there's only one holy
[3:02:05] ghost that same Holy Ghost who has
[3:02:08] brought them into their theophonic
[3:02:10] form in that sixth Dimension is the same
[3:02:14] holy ghost that you who will not go to
[3:02:17] the Grave
[3:02:18] will bring that same love that same
[3:02:21] character build that in you right now
[3:02:25] right here on this side of that sixth
[3:02:28] Dimension amen because when they come
[3:02:31] from the resurrection they ain't coming
[3:02:33] back to a bunch of people arguing
[3:02:36] divided they ain't coming back to that
[3:02:39] you know a long time ago I realized that
[3:02:42] in churches you going to have people
[3:02:44] that argue PE there ain't no perfect
[3:02:47] group in in the earth so if I just beat
[3:02:50] myself over the head talking about
[3:02:51] somebody else Church man look at that
[3:02:53] church there they got all they got this
[3:02:55] and that and they arguing and all that
[3:02:56] that's everywhere Jesus had a devil in
[3:02:59] his group

[3:03:05] heaven so so that tell me then that God
[3:03:08] dealing with
[3:03:10] individuals you might have a church 99%
[3:03:12] arguing beating each other there and
[3:03:14] somebody there talking about thank you
[3:03:15] Lord I'm praying for my brothers and
[3:03:17] sisters but Lord this between you and me
[3:03:20] Lord keep leading me where you leading
[3:03:23] me I follow Lord keep growing me up in
[3:03:25] the word and everybody talking about oh
[3:03:28] our church and and that's fine there
[3:03:30] there's power and authority in the local
[3:03:33] church there's power and authority in
[3:03:35] the body of Bride in in the local church
[3:03:39] amen but a lot of times people think by
[3:03:43] affiliation that will guarantee them
[3:03:45] Rapture I know I'm in the big
[3:03:48] Church the mayor go to our church I'm in
[3:03:51] the big church so I know I'm going in no
[3:03:53] no it ain't by
[3:03:56] affiliation it's because you were son
[3:03:58] and daughters in God before the
[3:03:59] foundation of the world praise the Lord
[3:04:01] you see so this is the last place and
[3:04:05] we're going to go home we're going to
[3:04:07] sing till we can't sing we're going to
[3:04:09] eat till our belly button pops off and
[3:04:15] everything and I'm going to enjoy
[3:04:18] amen but this is the last one and I
[3:04:22] thank you for your patience this morning
[3:04:24] for the supernal presence of the Living
[3:04:27] God Amen don't don't let the word just
[3:04:30] run off you like a water off a duck's
[3:04:32] back
[3:04:33] amen don't don't do that brother and
[3:04:36] sister look at yourself in the mirror of
[3:04:37] the word God is in Simplicity and
[3:04:40] humility but God ain't just leading us
[3:04:42] around a mountain just just walking in
[3:04:44] circles you come on let go to church
[3:04:47] come on let go to church come on let go
[3:04:49] and and we just looking for something to
[3:04:51] happen one
[3:04:53] day what you looking for you say well
[3:04:56] I'm looking for a Rapture it's in
[3:04:58] process that's right Amen brother Brown
[3:05:01] says when the word of God becomes eagleu
[3:05:03] to you then you have heard from your
[3:05:04] theophany you already heard from your
[3:05:05] theophany the Holy Ghost has already
[3:05:07] connected you to the position that you
[3:05:09] was in Christ before the foundation of
[3:05:11] the world and brought you back to that
[3:05:13] Fellowship that the father can
[3:05:14] fellowship with you am that is exactly
[3:05:16] right and so let me just read this and
[3:05:19] you've been patient with me if I could
[3:05:21] give you a little uh Medallion or
[3:05:23] something that say they were patient
[3:05:25] December the n9th when I came
[3:05:27] through but I can't do it though but but
[3:05:31] you were patient with me and so I say
[3:05:33] that because there's actually two quotes
[3:05:35] and I don't want you to get upset with
[3:05:37] me got to use some reverse psychology on
[3:05:41] you so let let me just read this in the
[3:05:44] message future home brother brandom says
[3:05:46] if you got eternal life life there's
[3:05:48] only one form that's
[3:05:52] God and you are an Express
[3:05:56] attribute he's going to get strong
[3:05:58] now if you were not you're not going to
[3:06:02] be there anyhow it's strong but that's
[3:06:05] the truth if you were not there if you
[3:06:08] were not a fault in God's mind in the
[3:06:11] beginning you can never become the word
[3:06:14] that's right to be the word you had to
[3:06:17] be ath thought Express that's right amen
[3:06:19] so if you were not a thought in his mind
[3:06:21] before the foundation of the world you
[3:06:23] can never be the word you can never
[3:06:25] return there because you were not there
[3:06:27] in the first
[3:06:29] place listen to him he says for no man
[3:06:32] can come to me except my father draw him
[3:06:34] see all these old things passed away he
[3:06:37] says the Holy Ghost is
[3:06:39] eternal then you
[3:06:42] are in
[3:06:44] eternity where you was all the time
[3:06:49] man let me let me read that again the
[3:06:52] Holy Ghost brother Brown says now the
[3:06:55] Holy Ghost is eternal then you are in
[3:07:00] you are in
[3:07:02] eternity where you was all the time but
[3:07:07] you just recognize what
[3:07:11] happened I was in
[3:07:14] eternity all the time brother Brown says
[3:07:18] yes the gene of your spiritual life amen
[3:07:23] what God saw you and the fellowship that
[3:07:26] he desired to have with you was in him
[3:07:30] to bring you back to your real you amen
[3:07:34] you're real you not the one that Mom and
[3:07:37] Daddy birth the one attribute Spirit
[3:07:40] attribute sons of his spirit that were
[3:07:43] in him then by the baptism of the Holy
[3:07:46] Ghost which makes you Eternal then he
[3:07:49] has brought you back into eternity where
[3:07:52] you was in him before there was a cherub
[3:07:55] a star anything why has he brought you
[3:07:58] back that way for
[3:07:59] Fellowship God ain't fellowshipping with

[3:08:37] translation of the
[3:08:38] briad he says in in the question answer

[3:08:56] explain the mystery of the translation
[3:08:58] of the Bride listen to him now he says
[3:09:00] just a
[3:09:02] change then he says now listen he says
[3:09:05] see our bodies now let's say our he says
[3:09:12] you know what I mean when I say this I
[3:09:15] don't mean to be Sac religious I don't
[3:09:18] mean to say ours I don't mean to say
[3:09:21] this church I mean to say every
[3:09:26] believer he says Abraham was looking for
[3:09:29] a promised son that was promised him is
[3:09:33] that right and the church is looking for
[3:09:35] a promised son the bride is that right
[3:09:40] the bride is looking for the promised
[3:09:41] son before the promised son could come
[3:09:45] to Sarah and Abraham there bodies had to
[3:09:48] be
[3:09:49] changed is that right she was too old to
[3:09:54] have a baby she had no milk veins her
[3:09:56] breast her breast was dried up her womb
[3:09:58] wasn't fertile she was sterile she could
[3:10:01] not have a baby her heart was too old to
[3:10:04] stand labor so what happened God changed
[3:10:08] her back to a young woman and he did
[3:10:11] Abraham the same thing cuz he said his
[3:10:14] body was as good as dead see and he had
[3:10:17] to change their bodies in order to
[3:10:19] receive the promised son and we cannot
[3:10:21] receive the promised son that's promised
[3:10:23] us in these bodies that we live in these
[3:10:26] bodies are sin he's talking about
[3:10:28] meeting the Lord in the air listen now
[3:10:30] he says now this first
[3:10:32] conscious controls this body with see
[3:10:35] taste feel smell and hear and has just
[3:10:39] and has just got us all scrp it up we
[3:10:42] reason and everything
[3:10:44] else but that new body
[3:10:48] that comes
[3:10:49] from this born
[3:10:53] again not this first conscience it'll
[3:10:56] pass
[3:10:58] away it's that inside something that
[3:11:02] lives everybody understand it say amen
[3:11:06] he
[3:11:07] says it's not this outside SE taste fi
[3:11:10] smell here it isn't it's subject to
[3:11:13] death and we'll die but the inside part
[3:11:17] of you down in here inside that is a
[3:11:21] person that cannot die Amen brother
[3:11:25] Brown you said that deep down inside of
[3:11:27] me built around my Born Again experience
[3:11:29] is another person that cannot die ah
[3:11:32] what's been going on down there what's
[3:11:34] been going on in this leadership what
[3:11:36] has this Holy Ghost been building
[3:11:38] through your leadership knowing that you
[3:11:40] will not die to go to the sixth
[3:11:42] Dimension to get into your theophany he
[3:11:44] will bring the word that you bypass he
[3:11:46] will build that in your heart Amen in
[3:11:49] this Dimension amen he says now
[3:11:53] [Music]
[3:11:55] see and that person and that's the
[3:11:59] person that New Life Starts from from
[3:12:03] this new birth it builds another person
[3:12:07] in the image of this person that you
[3:12:11] are another person being
[3:12:14] built in the image of what I was this is
[3:12:18] the
[3:12:19] negative that is the positive amen he
[3:12:23] says so potentially it's here what is it
[3:12:28] the word promised before the foundation
[3:12:30] of the world the word that you
[3:12:34] bypass that has come to you and around
[3:12:38] there this only brother Brown says this
[3:12:41] only reflects the negative that will
[3:12:44] reflect the positive the word
[3:12:47] see and the same thing or the
[3:12:50] translation of the broad will be the
[3:12:52] same thing the word that's in you the
[3:12:55] body will materialize around that word
[3:12:58] the same as it did Sarah amen what word
[3:13:02] you're guessing the word that you bypass
[3:13:05] that you are supposed to be that
[3:13:07] theophany has come to you been built in
[3:13:10] You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[3:13:12] this body materializes around that word
[3:13:16] and becomes a glorified body
[3:13:19] Glory that's the message of the hour
[3:13:22] amen not just running around saying I'm
[3:13:24] in the bride I'm in the bride I'm in the
[3:13:26] bride you believe brother BR this is the
[3:13:28] message to create Sons and Daughters of
[3:13:30] God after his own
[3:13:33] time you see that ain't for
[3:13:36] everybody is it for
[3:13:39] you is it for
[3:13:41] you me brother then be it unto thee

[3:13:47] bless him Lord he has claimed the
[3:13:50] inheritance

[3:13:57] body had to be changed in order to
[3:13:59] produce a son you get it that body could
[3:14:02] not do it this body cannot do it so
[3:14:04] it'll have to be changed the same way to
[3:14:07] receive a
[3:14:10] son God bless you richly Hallelujah

[3:14:39] Barnard if he had not have heard that
[3:14:41] scream he would have
[3:14:43] lived never coming to the true identity
[3:14:46] of what he was and what he was created
[3:14:48] to be but Lord when he heard the word

[3:15:27] foundation of the world to a glorified
[3:15:31] condition to meet that Eternal Elohim
[3:15:35] who has taken up a body

[3:15:47] the hour that we live in then we walk in
[3:15:50] the light and what is light but that it
[3:15:53] comes from the word what is light except
[3:15:57] the promise for this hour being made
[3:16:00] real by the Holy
[3:16:03] Ghost and father your Prophet said that
[3:16:06] voice that spoke to him the one voice
[3:16:09] that spoke to him all of his life said
