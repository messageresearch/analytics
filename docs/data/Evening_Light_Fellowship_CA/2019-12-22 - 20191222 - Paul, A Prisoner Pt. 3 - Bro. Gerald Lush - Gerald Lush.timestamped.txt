[44:25] the
[44:26] [Music]
[44:33] let us
[44:36] [Music]
[44:38] Oh
[44:40] [Music]
[44:59] [Music]
[45:22] Oh
[45:23] [Music]
[45:30] Oh
[45:49] Oh
[45:49] [Music]
[45:55] [Music]
[46:04] it's approaching with a greater
[46:07] revelation than what the world is
[46:09] expressing today hey man
[46:11] while the world will be expressing even
[46:13] on Wednesday hey man it's Christmas Day
[46:15] but again they're not considering the
[46:17] gift of God - considering the gifts of
[46:20] mom and dad and grandma grandpa family
[46:22] friends and neighbors but brothers for
[46:25] the right a man the great gift is Christ
[46:28] a man and for and for us is that for
[46:32] Christ it is the gift of eternal life
[46:34] through our Lord Jesus Christ amen so
[46:38] let's keep the balance and as I said
[46:40] we'll stay with the word by the grace of
[46:43] Almighty God to God be the glory
[46:46] that's Santa Claus a man but to hit -
[46:51] again this time of the year Santa Claus
[46:53] was getting a lot of glory and getting a
[46:55] lot of praise a man and oh my if the
[46:59] only new you know the history of Santa
[47:02] Claus and where it comes from and how it
[47:03] comes and so on
[47:04] you stay away and when it comes to a lot
[47:07] of things people getting involved in
[47:08] during Christmas the power of God so as
[47:11] Christians we can't do this with
[47:12] Christians we can't do that
[47:14] he says that's idolatry a man is
[47:16] referring to the Christmas decorations
[47:18] and this and that
[47:19] oh yeah a lot of people - a lot they're
[47:22] worshipping it in their heads they
[47:24] worship it in their in their zombie in
[47:26] their hearts so but the grace of God
[47:30] we're going to thank God for the birth
[47:33] of Jesus we thank God that He gave
[47:35] but again it's like the booklet we have
[47:38] over there and there's a picture on it
[47:41] concerning Christmas is it pagan and it
[47:44] is and there's four pictures on the
[47:48] front and one is his birth and the other
[47:51] one is his death and if they for this
[47:53] cause came I into the world a van and
[47:56] then down I said what did he do what do
[48:00] you want us to do and remember severe
[48:01] probable Christmas tree no I said right
[48:04] on the other side is there is the bread
[48:06] and wine the communion
[48:08] Amen praise the Lord so Jesus is not
[48:11] referring to his natural death he's
[48:13] referring to or not death but birth
[48:15] rather he's referring to his death he
[48:17] man he wants to focus us on what
[48:19] happened on Calvary a man by the grace
[48:22] of Almighty God so let's keep our to
[48:26] keep the balance when it comes to
[48:28] Christmas and I guess I've said some
[48:31] some believers now some believers are
[48:33] more and more is getting more and more
[48:35] now are getting involved in Christmas
[48:37] and they're having their going back to
[48:39] what they came out of as I did tell I
[48:43] got a certain brother and sister that
[48:45] present a certain thing concerning
[48:48] brother Branham and Christmas as you
[48:49] shouldn't have done as you're going to
[48:51] improve this increase the sale of
[48:52] Christmas trees this year either guys
[48:55] why because you didn't bring the balance
[48:57] and what you were pretty I said the
[48:59] property did say this but he also said
[49:01] this and so on so we got to take into
[49:03] consideration the whole truth nothing
[49:05] about the truth a man brother and for us
[49:08] to do that is to justify that the
[49:10] denominations out there that are
[49:13] compromising on the word a man they want
[49:16] to add to it or take from it so brother
[49:18] let's not add to it and I'll take from
[49:20] it let's take it the way that it is by
[49:22] the grace of God amen
[49:26] and of course we're not objecting to any
[49:27] the giving of gifts and things like that
[49:29] but let's keep it simple there's not
[49:32] glorify the devil there's not glorify
[49:34] Santa Claus a man no not by any means so
[49:39] we will glorify the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:41] and just think they're putting more
[49:43] emphasis is oh Christmas Christmas
[49:45] that's when Jesus was born yeah but
[49:47] they'll put more emphasis on Santa Claus
[49:48] than on Jesus and that is the absolute
[49:51] truth so grace to us to keep the balance
[49:54] and let let the balance you keep your
[49:56] reflection to the people of witness to
[49:58] the people a witness to your family and
[50:01] friends and neighbors and so on so
[50:03] rather be careful don't don't leave the
[50:06] wrong impression no no not by any means
[50:09] God's gonna required of you because the
[50:11] the in the judgment the gods will say
[50:14] you've done this unit on that and any a
[50:16] part of the prophecy of but on the
[50:18] screen he said what you did as a witness
[50:20] to the
[50:21] and so on and all God was in in that
[50:24] person the word was in that that brother
[50:26] that sister and so on so they're so
[50:28] they'll be without excuse for so the
[50:31] grace of God that you'll judge them and
[50:33] they won't judge you
[50:33] amen so let's be on our guard by the
[50:37] grace of God and the closer I think we
[50:40] get to eternity and the closer we get to
[50:43] to the resurrection rapture of course
[50:46] the less and less and less emphasis were
[50:48] going to put any any on Christmas and on
[50:51] this and on that no we want to get into
[50:53] the reality of it amen he was born
[50:56] without sin and praise the Lord he came
[50:59] back to give us a new birth a man
[51:02] without sin to thank God by the grace of
[51:05] God amen so the Lord blessed us and give
[51:09] us the wisdom we need especially this
[51:11] time of the year and again our brother
[51:15] Bob as mentioned already is concerned
[51:17] there be no service on Wednesday and of
[51:20] course it's it's Christmas Day and
[51:22] they're not only of course there's not
[51:25] going to gonna be a lot of activity
[51:26] around Christmas and gifts and so on but
[51:30] I understand too that the the weather
[51:32] forecast is not so good for a Christmas
[51:34] Day but also during this week our
[51:39] brother Bob sister Brenda brother
[51:41] Matthew and his family they will be they
[51:43] will be journeying to kill morning you
[51:46] know for three or four days there so god
[51:50] bless them and we pray for a safe
[51:52] journey a man and that God will bless
[51:55] them in the heart and in their souls I
[51:58] don't know I could I've been in kill
[52:01] Maury many times when we lived in Dewar
[52:03] and in Mary's time we drove by there
[52:05] many many many times of course it's not
[52:08] the kill Maury that we saw many year
[52:10] forty years ago is quite different now
[52:12] so so god bless our brothers and sisters
[52:16] as they travel amen of course and
[52:19] remember brother Joseph sister Priscilla
[52:21] in Tucson so I don't think they're
[52:24] looking at snow and I don't think
[52:26] they'll need any shovels amen
[52:29] but a brother from Tucson did tell me he
[52:33] said no we don't have the
[52:34] snowstorms and we don't have to worry
[52:37] with that but he said we do have
[52:38] problems sometimes with sand and I said
[52:40] yeah he always says the same problem you
[52:42] got with certain snow conditions he said
[52:45] we have was saying and they said were
[52:47] warned to be on our guard if there's a
[52:49] high wind and there's a lot of sand or
[52:51] yes he says you can go off the road you
[52:53] can run into another vehicle a man if
[52:55] you're not on your guard so thank God
[52:57] for snow amen
[52:59] and as I said to her brother that went
[53:01] to Florida and he emailed me back and he
[53:03] said brother no snow here all I said
[53:06] it's too bad I said the Bible says you
[53:08] should do when it comes to your sins
[53:09] though they be red like crimson and he's
[53:16] everybody said you're gonna be white
[53:17] like snow so I said if there's no snow
[53:20] you won't know what he means a man and
[53:23] it's like certain brethren in central
[53:26] United States and they said well we
[53:27] don't understand this song we can sing
[53:29] it a certain song there in him and he
[53:32] said but he said we can't identify with
[53:34] it like the brothers and sisters maybe a
[53:36] new flannery or down the coast it has to
[53:39] do with the water and so on that we had
[53:41] we know what it's all about but they
[53:43] don't amen could we witness it so the
[53:46] grace of God to us amen
[53:49] and that brother when it comes to snow
[53:53] just check see how many times the Bible
[53:56] refers to snow a man and let's identify
[53:59] with it not in the natural but in the
[54:01] spiritual day man and also to keep in
[54:04] prayer our brother Jeff King in Ontario
[54:07] there brother that well my sister-in-law
[54:10] called and and then he wanted to speak
[54:12] to me and he really appreciates what God
[54:16] has done and what God has said through
[54:18] his servant the prophet and he maybe
[54:20] even online today going to the listen to
[54:24] our some of our services so god bless
[54:26] our brother Jeff and the Lord willing I
[54:29] will be sending him some booklets
[54:31] he has understand he's already got a lot
[54:34] of Browns sermon books
[54:36] I'll see what other booklets he does he
[54:38] doesn't have concerning what God has
[54:40] done in this hour amen and what God is
[54:44] doing
[54:45] in this hour by the grace of God as I
[54:48] said this to many are recognizing what
[54:51] God has done but not what God is doing a
[54:54] man and they're going around the world
[54:56] God has sent a prophet God has sent a
[54:58] prophet but like I said around 1977 that
[55:01] cave that took a tremendous change and
[55:05] it was basically our brother lavell that
[55:09] he started to emphasize the message he
[55:12] said God has sent a prophet but why and
[55:15] what about the message he says that that
[55:17] prophet brought what was the message
[55:19] that prophet left us and from there on
[55:22] the ministry started to get into the
[55:23] message a man so and line up with the
[55:26] message not just the revelation God sent
[55:29] the Prophet that's getting to the
[55:30] message that God gave us through the
[55:33] Prophet a man and faith comes by hearing
[55:36] the word a man by the Word of God the
[55:39] Lord for your day the word for your our
[55:41] faith came to Luther by by catching the
[55:44] revelation of what was ordained for his
[55:46] age and the West is a Salvation Army the
[55:49] Pentecostal age a man but what about
[55:52] your age and mine a man what is the
[55:54] revelation of the word that we need amen
[55:57] so we're getting into into it we've been
[55:59] into it we're going to continue with it
[56:01] today and there's going to be maybe a
[56:03] few more services concerning a prisoner
[56:07] of Jesus Christ and when I did some
[56:10] little more study I was surprised to
[56:12] find out how much emphasis the Prophet
[56:15] was putting on a prisoner of Jesus
[56:18] Christ a man I'll share some of those
[56:20] thoughts with you because it was after
[56:23] the opening of the seals that he got
[56:25] into it a man the seals of course was in
[56:28] March or April and he preached of course
[56:31] marriage and divorce he preached another
[56:32] sermon another sermon and he said now he
[56:35] said this is a further revelation on the
[56:37] mystery of the seven seals a man and
[56:40] brother according to heard the emphasis
[56:41] that he was putting on on the prisoner
[56:44] of Jesus Christ and also is a revelation
[56:47] and a further revelation of the mystery
[56:50] of the seven seals
[56:51] they met he's not just an ideas not just
[56:53] a thought it's a revelation and I was
[56:57] surprised when I described
[56:58] that the profit not only preached
[57:00] preached sedessa worry in 1963 July but
[57:04] he went on and he put emphasis on it and
[57:06] yeah again in late later in July he put
[57:09] emphasis on in August a mad and other
[57:12] messages here and there I was surprised
[57:14] at the number of times that he was
[57:17] putting the emphasis on being a prisoner
[57:19] of Christ a man not in jail but in this
[57:22] in this body amen and to be ender and to
[57:26] reflect the the revelation of our Lord
[57:28] Jesus Christ God help us brother we need
[57:31] to catch this further revelation on the
[57:33] mystery of the seven seals or we know
[57:36] that this was the seven seals this was
[57:38] the seven seals but then he came and
[57:40] preached marriage and divorce that he
[57:42] preached this he preached that a man and
[57:44] this is in 1963 now listen here this and
[57:47] he went on and he preached Paul a
[57:49] prisoner he preached Christ as the
[57:51] mystery of God revealed and perfect
[57:53] faith and in all these messages he's
[57:56] emphasizing being a prisoner of Christ a
[57:58] man and finally it came to the in when
[58:01] he was nearing the end of 1963 the the
[58:05] Lord came down and said brother Branham
[58:07] you've got a return to evangelism a man
[58:10] because the purpose of his ministry was
[58:12] fulfilled in what in that he had come he
[58:15] had first pole second pole and then it
[58:17] was climax with the third pole the
[58:19] opening of the word the revealing of the
[58:21] mystery of the seven seals and a few
[58:24] others that he preached in 1963 and then
[58:27] God said that's it it was over with so
[58:29] he said now he said go back to
[58:31] evangelism and at the end of 1963 with
[58:35] on the master last message that he
[58:36] preached he said now he said ere I go he
[58:39] said back into evangelism a man he moved
[58:42] from evangelism into a prophetic
[58:44] ministry and now God was moving in from
[58:47] the prophetic ministry back to
[58:48] evangelism a man why to do because the
[58:52] word was laid in now the seed would
[58:55] raise up that would feed on that word a
[58:58] man that that word was ordained for as
[59:01] he said he said now he said I know it's
[59:03] not striking you what right he's just
[59:05] not striking me right because why
[59:07] because it wasn't the time it wasn't
[59:10] that hour but
[59:11] now we're moving into that hour that
[59:13] revelation of the resurrection rapture
[59:15] now the only the seven seals and the
[59:18] other revelations of 1963 ought to be
[59:21] striking us right a man and I ought to
[59:24] be having a greater and greater
[59:25] influence on us than it did before by
[59:28] the grace of Almighty God a man that
[59:31] it's gonna strike us now the way it
[59:33] should and what is it going to do if it
[59:35] strikes us the way it should it's going
[59:37] to it's going to give us resurrection
[59:38] and rapturing faith amen it's going to
[59:41] go beyond knowledge when it comes to God
[59:44] did this God said this God said that but
[59:46] back back 40 years ago we never had the
[59:49] revelation that we have now we didn't no
[59:52] no back 40 years ago 150 years ago it
[59:54] went on and on and on God has sent a
[59:56] prophet God has sent a prophet God has
[59:58] sent a prophet but finally as I said met
[1:00:01] the believers begin to get into the
[1:00:03] revelation of message a mayor so I pray
[1:00:06] grace that we are into the message and
[1:00:09] the message is in us a man god bless you
[1:00:12] listen this thing only believe as we go
[1:00:15] into the word concerning prisoner and
[1:00:18] Christ the mystery of God reveal a man

[1:07:02] Oh
[1:07:14] [Music]
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:44] amen god bless you turn with me to
[1:07:46] Philippians chapter 2 amen best within
[1:07:57] the last couple of days I saw the
[1:08:00] testimony of a certain black singer in
[1:08:03] the United States and it was a woman and
[1:08:07] she gave her testimony she said well she
[1:08:11] said I got saved at 12 years old but she
[1:08:16] said I still went on and did what I
[1:08:17] wanted to do yeah it was the influence
[1:08:20] of her father to get her to place and
[1:08:23] accept Christ as their Savior but she
[1:08:26] said it was some years later before he
[1:08:29] became my lord
[1:08:30] a man I said God bless her Lord I said
[1:08:33] she's got revelation so he said she said
[1:08:36] he's got to be more than my Savior she
[1:08:39] said he has to be my Lord he said the
[1:08:41] country says to control my thoughts and
[1:08:43] my words and my deeds
[1:08:44] so she's I'm led by his spirit a man and
[1:08:48] brother there's a lot of believers that
[1:08:50] they recognize Jesus as their Savior but
[1:08:52] he's not their Lord a man and their life
[1:08:55] proves that he is not their Lord that I
[1:08:57] proved proves that he's not up there not
[1:09:00] a prisoner of Jesus amen and another
[1:09:02] thought that I wanted to wanted to share
[1:09:05] with you today is is a the attributes of
[1:09:08] those who are prisoners of Jesus amen
[1:09:11] and that the Bible says that you're
[1:09:13] working out Europe your salvation with
[1:09:15] lot oh just just by the word this
[1:09:18] doctrine that doctrine no Paul says you
[1:09:20] got to work it out with fear and
[1:09:22] trembling amen praise the name of the
[1:09:25] Lord I said Lord I said this is this is
[1:09:27] the increasing the revelation of being a
[1:09:31] prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:09:32] now I say during her
[1:09:33] to to work at our salvation with fear
[1:09:36] and trembling a man you're constantly on
[1:09:41] your guard am i right am i in the in the
[1:09:43] in the presence of god am i in the will
[1:09:46] of God constantly morning noon and night
[1:09:48] your you want to do that so it's with
[1:09:51] fear and we're travelling unless we get
[1:09:53] out of the will of God a man and we're
[1:09:56] fear and trembling we want to make sure
[1:09:57] we are in the will of God we stay in the
[1:10:00] will of God this is God's will that's
[1:10:01] God's will amen the life I live is by
[1:10:04] the grace of God for the word of God
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:07] and and again it's tremendous brother
[1:10:09] it's not just going to church there's
[1:10:11] other things God wants to do in your
[1:10:12] life there's other things God wants to
[1:10:14] do in my life there's other things that
[1:10:16] Jesus wants you to be a witness of and
[1:10:18] testimony up a man not just going to
[1:10:20] serve not just that he's my Savior
[1:10:22] but he's my Lord amen so brother
[1:10:25] hallelujah with the grace of God in his
[1:10:30] lordship so the Lord be with you I want
[1:10:33] to go in praise the Lord
[1:10:35] to another thought concerning being a
[1:10:37] prisoner of Jesus Christ number one
[1:10:41] thing that we're going to express and
[1:10:42] and show is fear and trembling in our
[1:10:45] everyday life making sure we are
[1:10:48] Christians making sure that we are a man
[1:10:51] Christ like a man Christian not
[1:10:54] churchgoers but Christ like sons and
[1:10:57] daughters of God Christ like a man
[1:10:59] praise the Lord
[1:11:00] brothers and sisters in the faith and so
[1:11:03] also and if and if we are prisoner of
[1:11:06] Christ and we do have that spirit in
[1:11:08] that anointing of fear and trembling
[1:11:10] working at our salvation on daily basis
[1:11:13] what does it do it brings us to a place
[1:11:15] of being addicted a man have been
[1:11:18] addicted to the Lord being addicted to
[1:11:21] his word brothers sister we know what it
[1:11:23] means to for somebody to be addicted to
[1:11:25] this to drugs to liquor and alcohol and
[1:11:28] all these things a man because they just
[1:11:30] can't live without it they want it and
[1:11:32] they're constantly doing this doing this
[1:11:34] to get it and maybe they got to go out
[1:11:36] and get some extra money so they can buy
[1:11:37] it are they going to get this so they
[1:11:39] can get get get get the liquor get the
[1:11:41] the
[1:11:42] the beer or so on and why because
[1:11:45] they're indicted to it but are addicted

[1:17:35] god bless his words you may be seated
[1:17:41] there with me to Ephesians chapter six
[1:17:44] just back one book their visions chapter
[1:17:49] six often I'm sorry Ephesians chapter
[1:17:53] four and verse one we're familiar with
[1:18:03] with the other verses concerning the the
[1:18:05] fivefold ministry but Paul is
[1:18:11] highlighting the importance of prisoner
[1:18:14] ship and fear and trembling I therefore
[1:18:19] the prisoner of the Lord
[1:18:21] this eats you that's what worthy of the
[1:18:25] vocation wherewith ye are called
[1:18:28] a man this is tremendous we need to take
[1:18:32] the scripture more serious than just
[1:18:33] reading an essay well that's the Bible
[1:18:35] and that's the word of as the word of
[1:18:38] the Lord through Paul but let's apply it
[1:18:42] to our lives make our calling and
[1:18:44] election sure a man to confirm that we
[1:18:47] are prisoners of Jesus and that we are
[1:18:50] addicted to his word a man so he said
[1:18:53] walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye
[1:18:56] are called what does God require in
[1:19:00] walking worthy of the vocation verse 2
[1:19:03] with all lowliness and maintenance with
[1:19:08] long-suffering forbearing one another in
[1:19:12] love amen there's a way God is looking
[1:19:16] for in yours in your life why are you
[1:19:19] looking for you to reflect these
[1:19:20] attitudes a man to him and to one
[1:19:24] another so as with all lowliness and
[1:19:26] meekness with long-suffering forbearing
[1:19:29] one another in love a man bearing with
[1:19:33] one another in love God elvis
[1:19:37] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:19:40] Spirit in the bond of peace praise the
[1:19:44] Lord hallelujah when I there to bring
[1:19:48] division when I dare to separate but
[1:19:51] there to unite a man and to encourage
[1:19:55] the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
[1:19:58] peace because he said verse 4 there is
[1:20:01] one body and one spirit even as ye are
[1:20:07] called in one hope of your calling amen
[1:20:11] we really need to take it serious our
[1:20:15] relationship with the Lord our
[1:20:17] relationship with the word our
[1:20:19] relationship with each other and it says
[1:20:22] one Lord one faith one chisholm one God
[1:20:29] and Father of all who is above all a man
[1:20:34] praise the Lord
[1:20:35] and through all and in you all a man
[1:20:39] that proves the oneness of the God by
[1:20:42] the grace of God is just like this
[1:20:44] bookmark and it says the words 1 God are
[1:20:49] mentioned seven times in the entire King
[1:20:52] James Version of the Bible
[1:20:54] one God seven times and it says that we
[1:20:59] not all one father the Bible says it a
[1:21:03] man and not one God created us yes why
[1:21:10] do we deal treacherously every man
[1:21:12] against his brother by profaning the
[1:21:15] Covenant of Our Fathers a man Malachi 2
[1:21:19] and the scribe said unto him well master
[1:21:22] thou has said the truth for there is one
[1:21:24] God a man and there is none other but he
[1:21:29] mark 12
[1:21:31] and it says seen it is one God which
[1:21:34] should justify the circumcision by faith
[1:21:36] and the uncircumcision through faith a
[1:21:39] man one God and that is Christ Romans 3
[1:21:45] but to us there is but one God the
[1:21:48] Father of all of them all are all things
[1:21:53] and we in him and one Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:56] by whom are all things and we in him 1st
[1:21:59] Corinthians 8 and again one God and
[1:22:03] Father of all who is above all and
[1:22:06] through all and in you all we just read
[1:22:09] Ephesians 4:6 for there is one God and
[1:22:14] one mediator between God and man the man
[1:22:17] Christ Jesus how can you make a trinity
[1:22:21] of it it's not three persons as one amen
[1:22:26] it says I believe it said there is one
[1:22:29] God and I do as well the poles also
[1:22:32] believe and tremble a man James 2:19 God
[1:22:38] help us a man to have the revelation of
[1:22:41] one God the oneness a man of our
[1:22:44] relationship with God and a oneness of
[1:22:46] our relationship with each other
[1:22:49] by the grace of God amen
[1:22:52] turn with me to Philippians chapter 2
[1:23:02] beginning to read at verse 1 so here the
[1:23:05] word of the Lord here the scriptures
[1:23:07] apply it to your life
[1:23:09] apply it to your soul apply it to your
[1:23:11] spirit to see if we are truly born again
[1:23:14] the sphere we are truly sons and
[1:23:16] daughters of God because we are we are
[1:23:19] prisoner two crates where a prisoner to
[1:23:21] the word a man and we have that fear and
[1:23:23] trembling a man before God and we are
[1:23:26] addicted to Christ and it worked
[1:23:29] amen if there be therefore any
[1:23:33] consolation in Christ if any comfort of
[1:23:36] love and fellowship of the Spirit if any
[1:23:40] bowels and mercies or emotions and
[1:23:43] mercies fulfilling my joy that she be
[1:23:48] like-minded is a tremendous challenge to
[1:23:50] our faith is a tremendous challenge to
[1:23:53] our everyday living not just our
[1:23:57] attendants on a Wednesday or a Sunday
[1:23:59] Sunday service but it is everyday living
[1:24:02] there we are in him and he is in us by
[1:24:06] the grace of God
[1:24:07] so he said fulfilling my joy that she be
[1:24:11] like-minded and having the same love
[1:24:14] being of one Accord and of one mind this
[1:24:18] is tremendous a man sir are we living
[1:24:20] for Jesus are we living one another are
[1:24:23] we living for ourselves a man we were
[1:24:26] born again we're living for Christ and
[1:24:28] living for the body of Christ and he
[1:24:31] said let nothing through strife or
[1:24:34] vainglory a man see again keep your
[1:24:38] attitude right and your spirit right by
[1:24:42] the grace of god this is Scripture and
[1:24:44] it says let nothing be done through
[1:24:46] strife or vainglory god help us again
[1:24:51] let's examine our lives make sure that
[1:24:54] we're not we're not doing anything with
[1:24:56] strife or vainglory we're not causing
[1:24:58] anything any strife among the saints no
[1:25:02] therefore that were there for the unity
[1:25:04] amen were there to encourage the unity
[1:25:07] were there to improve the unity were
[1:25:09] there yes to bring unity amen
[1:25:13] so let each esteem the other better than
[1:25:15] themselves is amazing
[1:25:17] amen you're better than me amen you you
[1:25:21] you consider that your brother next to
[1:25:23] you or your sister next year is better
[1:25:24] than you amen you are what you are by
[1:25:27] the grace of God they are what they are
[1:25:29] by the grace of God grace for me grace
[1:25:31] for you for them amen hallelujah praise
[1:25:35] the name of the Lord I tell you there's
[1:25:37] a prisoner place hallelujah and addicted
[1:25:40] to Christ in his word brother big and
[1:25:42] makes us reflect Christ amen it gives us
[1:25:45] the image of Christ the character of
[1:25:47] Christ the motives of the objections of
[1:25:49] Christ living amen
[1:25:52] this is tremendous I the Lord I said if
[1:25:55] we need to take these things serious and
[1:25:57] I just say oh you know the Bible says
[1:25:59] the Bible says the Bible it's God saying
[1:26:01] it and it's God revealing it to you and
[1:26:04] me as God wanted to make it flesh in you
[1:26:06] and me by grace a man see both other if
[1:26:09] God is looking for anything is for
[1:26:11] Christ revealed in you and not crazy in
[1:26:14] your head or you got the knowledge of
[1:26:16] Christ I know Christ I know this and I
[1:26:18] know that amen does he know you
[1:26:20] amen just consider again the the foolish
[1:26:23] virgins when they Kate I don't know you

[1:26:46] were there and if he knows you he said
[1:26:48] he does have and he continues to have an
[1:26:50] intimate relationship with you amen
[1:26:52] not you that lives as Christ living this
[1:26:55] is a brother/sister don't take it as the
[1:26:57] letter of the word but take it as a
[1:26:59] revelation that God is imparting to us
[1:27:01] God wants us to see God wants us to hear
[1:27:04] it God wants to seriously consider it
[1:27:06] it's not me that lives it's crazy living
[1:27:08] than me it's a challenge to our faith
[1:27:10] the challenge to your faith oh I'm a
[1:27:12] Christian but it's Christ living in you
[1:27:15] you give me a Christian word and her
[1:27:19] certainly said some deeds but not the
[1:27:21] truth the whole truth and nothing but

[1:27:26] Christ
[1:27:27] controlling you not to the extent of
[1:27:29] being a prisoner of Christ a prisoner of

[1:27:39] believers and most of them are addicted

[1:28:30] his resurrection and the Fellowship of
[1:28:33] his suffering see most just want the
[1:28:35] power of his resurrection Eve my Savior
[1:28:37] yeah but he said your Lord that you will

[1:28:43] fellowship of is suffering do you want
[1:28:47] fellowship with a suffering a man o my
[1:28:51] brother's sister there's more most

[1:29:00] oh yeah they think grace hope thank you
[1:29:03] Lord for that grace thank you for that
[1:29:04] yeah but what about there's another
[1:29:06] grace to just grace for this reason it's
[1:29:09] grace for that reason whole grace does
[1:29:12] this yeah you can have that and go to

[1:29:39] going to make me happy it's gonna make
[1:29:41] me this that no no I said
[1:29:46] misunderstanding and that's a
[1:29:47] misinterpretation of grace anymore it's
[1:29:51] a revelation of grace that goes so far
[1:29:52] but let's go the whole ways brother
[1:29:55] Grace in the beginning grace down
[1:29:57] through the ages grace grace for the
[1:29:59] search ages amen brother
[1:30:02] because what what is God what is God

[1:39:20] of a servant and was made in the
[1:39:23] likeness of men just like God came down
[1:39:26] as a servant amen the devil wanted it
[1:39:30] wanted to hell evade him put him up pop
[1:39:32] him up make him look big and good in the
[1:39:35] eyes of man but Jesus said no to God be
[1:39:38] the glory

[1:40:21] a power Satan guy he's got an anointing
[1:40:25] oh yeah yeah
[1:40:28] you could have the anointing of God all
[1:40:32] over you got what we needed in us but
[1:40:35] you can add the anointing of the devil
[1:40:36] in you or you can have the anointing of
[1:40:38] the devil on your flesh oh yeah this is
[1:40:41] all mine Lord my lord just consider what
[1:40:44] what what the devil did to Jesus what's

[1:40:51] under control of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:53] make sure that we're prisoners of Jesus
[1:40:55] not prisoners of the devil amen

[1:41:13] word the word amen and not just

[1:41:41] father and so on and it's was absolute
[1:41:43] oneness with you Jesus and the father
[1:41:46] what does your life for click that does
[1:41:51] your spirit reflect that does your
[1:41:53] attitude reflect that or does just
[1:41:57] reflect a religious spirit or is it the
[1:41:59] Holy Spirit are you God in flesh are you
[1:42:04] the father are you the son are you the
[1:42:08] Holy Ghost manifested in flesh they're
[1:42:10] all one so is Christ in me
[1:42:13] it's the father's in me the Holy Ghost
[1:42:16] was in me
[1:42:21] wonder that such revelation is going to
[1:42:25] give bride the bride rapturing faith the
[1:42:29] resurrection faith and no wonder at all
[1:42:33] that is going to be very very very few
[1:42:37] living Saints go in the rapture and it
[1:42:44] says he made of himself of no reputation
[1:42:46] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:42:49] servant we want others to serve us know
[1:42:53] you serve them that's the Spirit of
[1:42:56] Christ and was made in the likeness of
[1:43:00] men and being found in fashion as a man
[1:43:03] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:43:06] unto death even the death of the cross
[1:43:08] we humble ourselves become obedient unto
[1:43:11] death to die to ourselves a man
[1:43:15] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[1:43:18] him and given him a name which is above
[1:43:20] every name a man that at the name of
[1:43:24] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[1:43:27] heaven of things in earth and things
[1:43:29] under the earth and that every tongue
[1:43:31] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:43:34] to the glory of God the Father
[1:43:37] hallelujah Saints as sons and daughters
[1:43:41] of God we are we surrender as prisoners
[1:43:44] to our Lord Jesus Christ and give him
[1:43:47] absolute control of our lives that's as
[1:43:51] a challenge does he have absolute
[1:43:54] control of your life your thoughts your
[1:43:56] words and your deeds what you have done
[1:44:02] and what you will do today is it Christ
[1:44:05] in you or is it you
[1:44:12] it is the evidence that we are
[1:44:13] absolutely addicted to Jesus Christ in
[1:44:16] thought word indeed am i addicted to
[1:44:19] Jesus am i addicted to the word if we
[1:44:27] are indeed addicted to our Lord Jesus
[1:44:29] Christ we are under the control of a
[1:44:32] strong hunger and thirst in thought word
[1:44:35] and deed if we're addicted to him then
[1:44:39] we have a oh the anointing upon us
[1:44:43] creating in us a hunger and a thirst for
[1:44:45] more and more and more of God amen
[1:44:49] not this world we don't want this we're
[1:44:53] finished with this world work tired of
[1:44:55] it
[1:44:55] oh yeah the Prophet brings that out in
[1:44:57] his emphasis on a prisoner of Christ a
[1:45:01] pressure of Christ he said doesn't know
[1:45:04] this world and doesn't like this world
[1:45:08] oh my again it's amazing that the
[1:45:13] Prophet would go on so long preaching a
[1:45:16] prisoner again not just this message but
[1:45:22] other messages so brother it's a further
[1:45:27] revelation of the mystery of the seven
[1:45:29] seals we got this mystery in that
[1:45:32] mystery do we have this mystery that we
[1:45:34] are prisoners of Christ amen and if we
[1:45:39] are addicted to the things of God we're
[1:45:44] under the control of the spirit of
[1:45:47] hunger and thirst and thought and
[1:45:49] thought rather in thought word and deed
[1:45:51] to continually reflect Jesus Christ in
[1:45:54] our thoughts in our words and in our
[1:45:56] deeds
[1:45:57] that's what we want to do whether say
[1:46:00] you're in your job again no matter where
[1:46:01] it is whatever you say will express God
[1:46:06] in thought word and deed you know it is
[1:46:14] unfortunate that most professing
[1:46:16] believers are more addicted to the
[1:46:18] natural things of life rather than the
[1:46:21] spiritual things of God
[1:46:25] the prophet of God said sometimes I
[1:46:29] speak rough to the people but he said
[1:46:34] you've got to cut loose the worldly
[1:46:36] things things and become a prisoner to
[1:46:43] Christ amazing and amazing keep cutting
[1:46:52] loose until the last lines are cut loose
[1:46:57] amen
[1:46:58] he said I speak rough but you got to cut
[1:47:02] loose the worldly things and become a
[1:47:04] prisoner to Christ and keep cutting
[1:47:06] loose onto the last lines are cut amen
[1:47:11] bear with me in the message Paul a
[1:47:16] prisoner hear the word of the Lord the
[1:47:19] prophet of God was pray let me share
[1:47:25] with you a few thoughts before he gets
[1:47:27] into the text of being a prisoner and he
[1:47:31] says speak to us Lord and warm our
[1:47:36] heartstrings that we would know how to
[1:47:39] discipline ourselves not discipline
[1:47:43] somebody else discipline yourself a man
[1:47:46] and discipline ourselves
[1:47:49] heesu for the great time that lays ahead
[1:47:51] as we believe we are making are nearing
[1:47:55] rather the coming of the Lord and we
[1:47:59] thank thee for people now beginning to
[1:48:02] find faith dear to them and knowing what
[1:48:05] faith means or to many faith is just I
[1:48:10] believe in God no it's believing God is
[1:48:14] believing the word believing this
[1:48:16] revelation that revelation amen
[1:48:18] this is what pleases God if you believe
[1:48:20] what he reveals to you a man so he said
[1:48:24] they're beginning to find faith dear to
[1:48:26] them and knowing what faith means and
[1:48:29] knowing you so we are thinking you law
[1:48:31] for our thanking you for services yet
[1:48:34] ahead
[1:48:35] and believing it you're going to do
[1:48:37] something Lord we're waiting with
[1:48:39] anticipation like the days of old
[1:48:41] believing that the time is near when
[1:48:43] you're going to just raise up the
[1:48:46] windows of heaven and pour Oh promises
[1:48:49] that God has promised in the last days
[1:48:51] and that's what God has done brother
[1:48:53] he's poured it out by the grace of God
[1:48:56] amen
[1:48:59] and continuing in prayer he said chasing
[1:49:02] us Lord
[1:49:03] oh you pray that you want the Lord to
[1:49:07] chasing you correct you chasing us Lord
[1:49:16] with thy spirit chasing us but thy word
[1:49:21] that we might discipline ourselves
[1:49:24] obedient servants again discipline
[1:49:27] yourself what for to get you to line up
[1:49:31] with the word of God your heavenly
[1:49:32] Father as you discipline your children
[1:49:34] to line up with with with your with your
[1:49:37] instructions as their father and mother
[1:49:39] or grandfather and grandmother he said
[1:49:44] let us remember and try to think in our
[1:49:46] hearts what the early Christian did what
[1:49:49] type of people we meet if we met those
[1:49:51] who had personally been in contact with
[1:49:54] you how their lives must have been the
[1:49:57] Living Word of God just written a
[1:49:59] pistils read of all men as they walked
[1:50:03] in among the people Amen just think they
[1:50:08] were the word well this is the word
[1:50:11] yeah that's written in a book but you're
[1:50:15] the Word made flesh a man it's Lord and
[1:50:20] what's written here and what I've just
[1:50:23] read concerning the right attitude right
[1:50:26] spirit right anointing the life of
[1:50:28] Christ and spawn that's what that's what
[1:50:30] you're going to reflect there's going to
[1:50:32] be the word in you is not oh we read it
[1:50:35] and it's there no no is there now yeah
[1:50:39] it was here now it's here God takes the
[1:50:42] word and makes the word flesh amen and
[1:50:45] he said may our lives be so submitted to
[1:50:48] thee
[1:50:49] that the Holy Spirit will live itself
[1:50:51] through us and speak through us Granite
[1:50:54] Lord may we remember in our minds as we
[1:51:00] walk upon the streets and rub arms with
[1:51:03] the world that were not supposed to be
[1:51:05] like those in the world no and we step
[1:51:10] aside and give them the place Lord and
[1:51:13] their rightful position here on earth
[1:51:15] and we'll take the back seat knowing we
[1:51:19] are delegates from another world and we
[1:51:22] have a kingdom that's coming into power
[1:51:24] Lord and our great king will soon arrive
[1:51:28] amen and will reign with him a thousand
[1:51:34] years and be with him forever amen god
[1:51:39] help us to believe what God is doing and
[1:51:42] that were a part of what he's doing amen
[1:51:45] and then he's working it out in you and
[1:51:48] in me by grace amen
[1:51:56] again he said I believe the Lord has
[1:51:58] somehow he'd given me a little say
[1:52:01] insight on the reasons why there are
[1:52:03] some people that are not healed I
[1:52:05] believe it's a lack of understanding and
[1:52:10] he said I believe and will speak on that
[1:52:16] Sunday morning he cares do you care you
[1:52:21] know
[1:52:22] most caring about their natural lives
[1:52:25] but not the spiritual he spy believed
[1:52:28] one of the great things that I find in
[1:52:30] this day is the lack of sincerity of
[1:52:32] what we believe and if God in the days
[1:52:34] of John Wesley would have done it in
[1:52:36] that day what he has done today what
[1:52:39] would it have done because they were so
[1:52:41] sincere amen
[1:52:44] in the days of Martin Luther as we as
[1:52:49] what we see I'm doing both proven by the
[1:52:52] church by the spirit by science and
[1:52:54] remove and he said God's Word here
[1:52:58] declaring it and telling it before it
[1:53:00] comes to pass
[1:53:01] and then moving upon and prophesying and
[1:53:05] doing the very things that he said would
[1:53:07] come to pass perfectly exactly what he
[1:53:10] said and still we sit kind of slothful
[1:53:13] as if we wonder wonder if that could be
[1:53:18] mean me wonder that could be just a
[1:53:21] church as a whole and what I if I'm
[1:53:23] really included in this I think Sunday
[1:53:26] morning I'll try to talk on some of
[1:53:28] those principles that might enlighten us
[1:53:30] a little and he preached the message
[1:53:31] again he cares do you care
[1:53:34] amen and then he moves on to the message
[1:53:39] Paul a prisoner I thought it's Lord
[1:53:41] maybe I should do his brotherly veil did
[1:53:44] a man and he someone said to me oh
[1:53:49] you're not a preacher I said no okay and
[1:53:55] all he said you're not like brother Vail
[1:53:58] he says he takes one message and he'll
[1:54:00] preach 70 70 messages on it and so on
[1:54:03] and I did like I said I preached a
[1:54:07] message one time and I preached 69
[1:54:09] messages on that one thought one the
[1:54:12] revelation so I did say to somebody I
[1:54:15] said does that does that equal me with
[1:54:17] brother Vail a man Amen because you can
[1:54:22] go on and on and on and on with the
[1:54:24] revelation of the word by the grace of
[1:54:26] God a man so and brotherly Bell did take
[1:54:30] a message and he just took it one line
[1:54:32] at a time one line at a time and when he
[1:54:34] was finished he had preached sick or 70
[1:54:36] messages on that one sermon see how the
[1:54:41] law the Lord will do it concerning Paul
[1:54:44] a prisoner and again I thought we'd just
[1:54:48] go through some thoughts here because I
[1:54:50] thought this was the only message that
[1:54:51] he was putting the emphasis on being a
[1:54:53] prisoner of Christ but I discovered that
[1:54:56] there was other messages and that he had
[1:54:59] mentioned being a prisoner of Christ
[1:55:01] over and over and over and over again
[1:55:03] and Justin in in just a maybe three or
[1:55:07] four messages or four or five messages
[1:55:09] that he had referenced being a prisoner
[1:55:12] of Christ oh my
[1:55:15] almost a hundred times I said Oh Lord
[1:55:18] it's a revelation that we need I said to
[1:55:22] to pay attention to a man we want to
[1:55:26] it's a revelation everybody need to take
[1:55:28] serious and to make sure that we are a
[1:55:30] prisoner of Christ we're not a prisoner
[1:55:32] to that or just to the message a
[1:55:34] prisoner to william branham because
[1:55:36] people call it they might call us random
[1:55:38] lights or whatever we're not we're
[1:55:39] Christians christ-like not random like
[1:55:42] any man
[1:55:44] there's too many our Brenham look and
[1:55:47] they want to follow this to follow that
[1:55:49] no no follow Christ because we didn't
[1:55:51] read him didn't point us to himself we
[1:55:53] didn't been appointed us to Jesus amen
[1:55:56] and again nearing the end of the of his
[1:56:00] ministry under seven seals if there's
[1:56:03] anything that he wanted to dilate was
[1:56:04] our relationship with Christ because
[1:56:07] I'll tell you this the only way we're
[1:56:08] going into rapture in the resurrection
[1:56:09] is that we got to enter into a oneness
[1:56:11] with our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:56:14] he's got to be not just our Savior he's
[1:56:16] got to be our Lord amen and brother he's
[1:56:19] the lord of the bright amen
[1:56:22] I pray that it's his lordship in control
[1:56:25] of you and again brother brown Stix was
[1:56:32] only just for five or six words when he
[1:56:37] read it there in the book of Philemon
[1:56:39] and we read it and he said Paul a
[1:56:42] prisoner of jesus christ and he stopped
[1:56:45] that's all
[1:56:47] he didn't read as much as i read today
[1:56:49] and he said that's what i want to use
[1:56:52] tonight as a text the Lord willing and I
[1:56:55] said why he wanted to preach on a
[1:56:56] prisoner and now he says you can hardly
[1:56:59] imagine Paul with Guardium self a
[1:57:01] prisoner a born free man filled with the
[1:57:04] Holy Ghost yet he calls himself a
[1:57:07] prisoner and now we find out that he's
[1:57:09] addressing the Corinthians as an apostle
[1:57:12] of Jesus Christ
[1:57:13] a man a servant of Jesus Christ and a
[1:57:18] prisoner of Jesus Christ so he said the
[1:57:23] prophet of God said Lord Jesus any man
[1:57:25] that's physically able can
[1:57:27] pull back the pages of the Bible but
[1:57:30] only the Holy Spirit can interpret it in
[1:57:33] the light that is meant to be a man we
[1:57:36] can read it and turn the pages and read
[1:57:39] it oh thank you Lord that's good yeah
[1:57:41] but we need the Holy Ghost to make it
[1:57:45] flesh in you and me we need the Holy
[1:57:47] Ghost to give us the revelation that we
[1:57:50] need of what we read amen
[1:57:53] so that he can apply it to our lives
[1:57:55] it's not not just storing it up in our
[1:57:57] heads
[1:57:58] no no it's planting the seed of the word
[1:58:01] in our hearts watering it continually so
[1:58:05] it's going to bring forth and bring
[1:58:06] forth and bring forth amen
[1:58:10] so he said Lord any man physically able
[1:58:14] can pull back the pages of this Bible
[1:58:16] but only the Holy Spirit can interpret
[1:58:19] it in the light that it's meant to be
[1:58:21] that's true we asked him to come and now
[1:58:23] help us understand he said this great
[1:58:28] mighty prophet Paul yet he called
[1:58:30] himself a prisoner and may the Holy
[1:58:32] Spirit reveal it to us as we wait on him
[1:58:36] in Jesus Christ's name a man then he
[1:58:39] went on and they listened to these
[1:58:41] thoughts and he said I can imagine Paul
[1:58:44] when he wrote his letter to Philemon how
[1:58:47] he was sitting in jail down there in the
[1:58:49] dungeon of this city a prisoner and he
[1:58:53] could well know by his position what the
[1:58:56] word meant and then again I believe that
[1:58:59] the Apostle meant just a little not
[1:59:01] exactly addressing it to his present
[1:59:03] condition as being a prisoner of his
[1:59:06] physical being sitting here in this jail
[1:59:08] but I believe he was referring to his
[1:59:11] spirit he said being a prisoner to Jesus
[1:59:14] Christ not a prisoner to the government
[1:59:17] not a prisoner to those that had put him
[1:59:20] in jail but he was a prisoner to Jesus a
[1:59:22] man and now he said we will all be born
[1:59:26] a free moral agent to make decisions he
[1:59:29] said we wish to God just justly does it
[1:59:33] because he must put every man on the
[1:59:35] same basis so he put the first man on
[1:59:39] the wrong basis he
[1:59:40] that he put on the free moral agent and
[1:59:44] he said we're just exactly tonight like
[1:59:46] Adam and Eve and there's no difference
[1:59:48] right or wrong that's either one of us
[1:59:51] and he's a life or death we can make our
[1:59:55] choice it's up to you the choice you
[1:59:58] make to accept it or reject it to
[2:00:02] believe it or not believe it what god is
[2:00:04] ministry he brings that I would be
[2:00:13] serious why because he discerns
[2:00:17] or sometimes we don't desert he saw what
[2:00:21] we didn't see you know well he preached
[2:00:24] this he's challenging the people's faith
[2:00:27] whether or not they were just you know
[2:00:29] prisoners to this or that or they
[2:00:31] prisoner of Jesus or they are they
[2:00:34] prisoners at all
[2:00:35] oh Christ has set me free Christ has
[2:00:38] done this Christ has done that yeah but
[2:00:41] free from sin to become a prisoner to
[2:00:43] him a man under his control
[2:00:47] and under his leadership if you're a
[2:00:49] prisoner you're under another control
[2:00:51] you're under somebody else's leadership
[2:00:53] not your own and for Paul it was Jesus
[2:00:57] well God already told him my grace is
[2:01:00] sufficient for you Paul don't don't ask
[2:01:04] you to do this don't ask me to do that
[2:01:05] you this you want that no law and all of
[2:01:08] that my grace is sufficient we want God
[2:01:10] to do this one God it listens my son my
[2:01:13] daughter my grace is sufficient to take
[2:01:15] you through all of that my grace is
[2:01:17] sufficient to help you to endure all
[2:01:19] these things know but there's so many
[2:01:23] believers they want everything they want
[2:01:26] the road paved in gold we're going
[2:01:30] somewhere streets shall be as pure gold
[2:01:33] but we wanted here and all we got it we
[2:01:37] got to endure this and suffer this to
[2:01:39] get there by the grace of God amen so as
[2:01:46] as your pastor I'm not here to condemn
[2:01:48] or to criticize you I'm here to share
[2:01:50] with you a revelation
[2:01:52] to challenge your thoughts or to
[2:01:54] challenge your faith or to get you to
[2:01:57] meditate on to get you to worry again to
[2:02:00] work out your salvation with fear and
[2:02:01] trembling make your calling and election
[2:02:04] sure and this is how you got to do it
[2:02:07] just could what judge yourself by the
[2:02:09] word Lord does that mean sorry Lord I
[2:02:12] don't mean to I don't mean to leave that
[2:02:14] I don't mean to admit that I don't mean
[2:02:15] to forget that lord I need I need more
[2:02:17] of your anointing or so so that I'm
[2:02:19] gonna go and live it I'm gonna go and
[2:02:21] reflect Jesus not just in my thoughts
[2:02:24] but in my words and my deeds and other
[2:02:27] people they want to reflect Jesus and
[2:02:29] their thoughts I sometimes and their
[2:02:31] words but not their deeds it's the life
[2:02:33] you live he's is up to you to make the
[2:02:40] choice he says your life will prove
[2:02:48] exactly what side you are on your life
[2:02:52] what you do how you do it when you do it
[2:02:57] the spirit and attitude you got that
[2:03:00] reflects the side you're on
[2:03:03] yeah he said I don't care what side you
[2:03:07] say you're on he said what you do every
[2:03:10] day proves what you are yeah it does he
[2:03:15] says you've heard the old saying he said
[2:03:18] your life is so loud I can't hear your
[2:03:20] testimony see your actions just speak so
[2:03:24] loud they meant is it reflecting the
[2:03:28] word the message god help us
[2:03:32] he said I've always believed in shouting
[2:03:35] and jumping but I've always said don't
[2:03:38] jump no higher than what you live amen
[2:03:43] because the world is going to watch that
[2:03:46] you must jump just as I usually so
[2:03:49] because somebody is watching you be on
[2:03:52] your guard
[2:03:54] amen don't reflect your own nature
[2:03:58] reflect Jesus it's not reflecting
[2:04:00] journalist they're not reflecting yet
[2:04:03] mark copier or your brother Weiser there
[2:04:06] no no it's reflecting Jesus oh I wanted
[2:04:10] to all this is me this is me no it's
[2:04:12] Jesus this is tremendous
[2:04:15] what a challenge to our faith what that
[2:04:20] what they see is Jesus not me not that
[2:04:25] one with that person that was born of
[2:04:26] this mother and father or this
[2:04:27] grandmother grandfather no no born again
[2:04:29] of Jesus amazing so he said don't jump
[2:04:36] any higher than you live because the
[2:04:38] world is going to watch that and see you
[2:04:41] must jump just as I usually so because
[2:04:44] somebody watching you and when people
[2:04:46] don't want from the church and some of
[2:04:49] them not coming our sincere people and
[2:04:52] they see so much corruption in the
[2:04:54] church until they don't want to have
[2:04:56] anything to do with it and many times
[2:04:59] we're speaking on a correct thought and
[2:05:01] you can't hardly blame them because the
[2:05:05] way people that call themselves
[2:05:06] Christians he said they're the greatest
[2:05:08] stumbling block in the world the world's
[2:05:10] God that's true you call yourself a
[2:05:13] Christian but you're not living like one
[2:05:16] you might reflect the church but not
[2:05:19] Jesus a man is the stumbling block and
[2:05:24] he said as a man and a woman who profess
[2:05:26] to be a Christian and lives something
[2:05:28] different from their professions now he
[2:05:30] said for the disappointments they'd be
[2:05:33] becoming at the judgment not now he said
[2:05:35] the sinner the bootlegger the gambler
[2:05:37] the adulteress he won't be to support it
[2:05:40] to hear his sentence
[2:05:41] read to depart into everlasting fire he
[2:05:44] won't be disappointed but that fellow
[2:05:46] who is trying to hide himself behind
[2:05:48] some kind of a church profession don't
[2:05:52] try to hide yourself behind the message
[2:05:53] of William Branham no where do we hide
[2:05:58] ourselves in Christ
[2:06:04] he said that's the boy that's going to
[2:06:06] be disappointed the day of judgement who
[2:06:08] is trying to hide himself behind the
[2:06:10] church or trying to hide himself behind
[2:06:13] the doctrine a third theology no it's
[2:06:16] got to be Christ in you the word all
[2:06:20] they ask the word the word the word yeah
[2:06:21] a me yeah well where's Jesus what do you
[2:06:24] mean is he in you do you think about it
[2:06:28] do you fellowship with him what no yeah
[2:06:34] if it's Christ in you you fellowship
[2:06:35] with him you go through the day and you
[2:06:37] and Chrysler are community
[2:06:39] you don't Christ our fellowship me yes
[2:06:40] that's right sister amen why because
[2:06:43] you're born again and his seed is in you
[2:06:47] his nature is in you and you're gonna
[2:06:50] communicate with him and he'll commit he
[2:06:51] wants to fellowship with you raise the
[2:06:55] Lord it's just like again the sister
[2:06:59] that was praying and praying and praying
[2:07:02] for a fellowship and this was a and real
[2:07:08] and so she got up one day and she was so
[2:07:11] lonely she could laid then under Scott
[2:07:13] and slept and the door rang oh she got
[2:07:20] up when they were looking for something
[2:07:23] no she said just go down the street did
[2:07:25] you get that they'll be good for you
[2:07:27] down there and then the door rang after
[2:07:29] a while I can ringing again she opened
[2:07:31] the door and there was a beggar there
[2:07:33] and he was looking for food oh no she
[2:07:35] said you go down the street you'll get
[2:07:37] some food dear that's fine and I don't
[2:07:40] know how many came to the door but
[2:07:42] finally at the end near the end I guess
[2:07:43] she said Lord you said you were going to
[2:07:45] come have ever supper with me a meal
[2:07:48] with me today but he said she said I've
[2:07:50] been waiting and she said you haven't
[2:07:51] come and the Lord said sister our
[2:07:55] daughter
[2:07:56] he said I'd knocked at your door two or
[2:07:59] three times today
[2:08:00] and you sent me on you're never invited
[2:08:03] me why she didn't recognize that as
[2:08:08] Jesus do you recognize your brother your
[2:08:11] sister as Jesus Christ
[2:08:13] oh she wouldn't she didn't want that one
[2:08:15] in she didn't want to invite the other
[2:08:16] one in no no no she took one she turned
[2:08:19] them down she turned down Jesus he came
[2:08:23] as a beggar to her door yeah god help us
[2:08:30] please
[2:08:31] that's rich but you better respect one
[2:08:33] another keep it right add two very
[2:08:35] spirit cuz you the Bible says you would
[2:08:37] entertain angels unaware how many have
[2:08:40] done that and not really entertain them
[2:08:42] but just push them out god help us real
[2:08:53] is God to us probably God did say it's
[2:08:58] going to go on and on and on in the last
[2:09:00] days until it said you're very faith in
[2:09:03] God it's going to be tested and
[2:09:06] challenged oh yeah your faith do you
[2:09:13] really believe in God
[2:09:24] he said it's better for him to that he
[2:09:27] never did make any kind of a profession
[2:09:30] than the saves a Christian but not live
[2:09:33] as a Christian always he said don't
[2:09:37] judge your life by how much power you
[2:09:39] have to perform miracles he said we
[2:09:42] don't judge ourselves by how much
[2:09:44] knowledge you have of the word
[2:09:45] he's a look back and take an inventory
[2:09:49] of what kind of a fruit that the life
[2:09:51] you presently live is now bearing well
[2:09:56] are you bringing forth the life of
[2:10:00] Christ and the problem referred to a
[2:10:05] mirror and you see a reflection in the
[2:10:09] mirror he told about the story of the
[2:10:17] young boy that had not ever seen a
[2:10:19] mirror until he went to a certain house
[2:10:22] with his mother and he was walking
[2:10:25] around and all of a sudden he walked
[2:10:28] past a mirror he saw somebody in the
[2:10:31] mirror and two finally he went back and
[2:10:36] he did this and he did that do that so
[2:10:40] did the guy in the mirror and he went
[2:10:44] back he said oh he said mom that looks
[2:10:47] like me
[2:10:49] it would the reflection was him but he
[2:10:52] didn't know because he didn't know
[2:10:54] anything about mirrors he says me and it
[2:11:00] was so now it's Jesus Jesus can look in
[2:11:05] that mirror and see himself in anyway oh
[2:11:10] praise the Lord hallelujah amen are you
[2:11:15] the mirror of the revealed word
[2:11:16] reflecting Christ amen the question walk
[2:11:20] past you and oh praise the Lord I'm
[2:11:24] there I made pleasure that one that's
[2:11:27] myself amen and he said I said that too
[2:11:33] we too are reflecting something
[2:11:37] our life is reflected and if we lived in
[2:11:40] the days of Noah what side would we had
[2:11:42] to take it in the days of Moses what
[2:11:45] side on the days of Elijah the Prophet
[2:11:48] when all the world was gulped up in a
[2:11:50] great mass of modernism
[2:11:53] they met would you have taken the site
[2:11:57] up molarity or would you have stood with
[2:11:59] Elijah amazing and in the days of the
[2:12:04] Lord Jesus what side would you have
[2:12:06] taken your life that you live now
[2:12:08] reflects now just what you would have
[2:12:11] done them because you still possess with
[2:12:15] the same spirit see he said the devil
[2:12:19] takes his spirit he just goes off from
[2:12:21] one man to another God never takes his
[2:12:24] spirit he said it goes from one to
[2:12:27] another so the very spirit that was on
[2:12:30] the on Elijah came on Elijah and the one
[2:12:33] that John the Baptist so forth the Holy
[2:12:35] Spirit that was about Christ came upon
[2:12:37] his disciples and still on the people so
[2:12:43] God never takes his spirit so there we
[2:12:46] are left to make a choice and I can't
[2:12:48] see here where Paul was regretting
[2:12:52] anything saying he was sorry he was a
[2:12:56] prisoner but he was addressing himself I
[2:12:59] believe he said as he wrote this letter
[2:13:02] with the pen that was the and it was the
[2:13:05] Holy Spirit causing him to write it and
[2:13:08] he said that maybe even to this night
[2:13:10] that we might call out of the text to
[2:13:13] show why Paul did this and I believe
[2:13:15] that sitting in this dingy old jail that
[2:13:19] Paul wrote it
[2:13:20] calling air that his brother that he was
[2:13:23] a prisoner of Jesus Christ so he could
[2:13:25] express it by seeing what was around him
[2:13:28] now he was in jail but that wasn't what
[2:13:31] he was speaking to his servant of Christ
[2:13:33] have Minister with him he speaking that
[2:13:36] he was a prisoner to the word of Jesus
[2:13:39] Christ because Christ is the word amen
[2:13:45] bear with me I won't be able to go
[2:13:47] through all of it because I want to I
[2:13:51] hate the fact that it's not the prisoner
[2:13:52] in the jail it's the prisoner in the
[2:13:55] word and you'll come a prison prisoner
[2:13:59] to the word and to highlight again to
[2:14:01] bring out what he's emphasizing here in
[2:14:03] these other messages after in July in
[2:14:07] August 63 and brother is emphasizing
[2:14:10] emphasizing emphasizing Christians or
[2:14:12] prisoners Christians are prisoners
[2:14:14] they're prisoners of Jesus Christ and
[2:14:16] he's challenging the people's faith are
[2:14:19] you a prisoner oh yeah one of those
[2:14:23] message book summary brings out
[2:14:34] now this quote but another quote
[2:14:36] somewhere might be Crystal Christ the
[2:14:42] mystery of God revealed there was a
[2:14:51] great three full purpose of Christ to
[2:14:57] express himself identify himself with
[2:15:00] human beings and to reveal himself in
[2:15:02] Christ secondly to have the preeminence
[2:15:05] in his body of believers that is is
[2:15:08] bright that he might live in the people
[2:15:11] and he could do that in a domani but sin
[2:15:14] separated them so now here had to be
[2:15:17] somewhere to get back again by the grace
[2:15:20] of God amen
[2:15:23] but again it's not the quote that I was
[2:15:26] thinking of believe it we'll find it
[2:15:35] amen by the grace of God it's a serious
[2:15:39] quote concerning being a prisoner of
[2:15:41] Christ if you're not a prisoner of
[2:15:44] Christ or not a Christian maybe not a
[2:15:47] person of Christ you're not the right no
[2:15:49] no because to be a prisoner you're going
[2:15:51] to follow the one that you're a prisoner
[2:15:54] to he's got control he's going to do
[2:15:56] this he's going to do that he's going to
[2:15:58] do that in your life amen
[2:15:59] grace of God therefore he said Paul was
[2:16:05] a prisoner from his objective that he
[2:16:07] had in life and he became a prisoner of
[2:16:09] Jesus Christ who was the word and he
[2:16:12] said the words of Damascus changed Paul
[2:16:15] a man has the word changed you that some
[2:16:22] of the Saints here that received the
[2:16:23] word forty years ago as it changed you
[2:16:26] now not it's not just to like I said to
[2:16:30] public God says you can come out of a
[2:16:31] church and still and still at the same
[2:16:33] spirit still be be a church person
[2:16:36] because you got the spirit of that
[2:16:38] church but brother if you really come
[2:16:40] out by the word you leave that spirit
[2:16:42] behind a man you get into the word and
[2:16:45] you got the spirit of the word
[2:16:46] amen that's right
[2:16:50] amazing the probably God recognize many
[2:16:53] a commodity denominations but they're
[2:16:55] still part of it because they still had
[2:16:57] denominational spirits he said oh my
[2:17:02] what the prophet knew and what the
[2:17:04] prophet saw what the Prophet realized
[2:17:07] and like he said I got not see my heart
[2:17:10] he said by the way I'll go to my grave
[2:17:12] he'll take it to his grave you wouldn't
[2:17:15] tell them oh I guess there are certain
[2:17:17] things he could tell us that would
[2:17:18] frighten us I would what's going on in
[2:17:23] the world now he's prophesied it as we
[2:17:25] mentioned in our talking with our
[2:17:27] fellowship with our brother David
[2:17:29] concerning this someone got sick with
[2:17:31] this got sick with this Sigma this rule
[2:17:33] well the prophet of God said there's
[2:17:35] gonna be a germ warfare oh yeah
[2:17:38] Satan's come down with drat and that's
[2:17:41] why he's causing this and causing this
[2:17:42] and causing that and so on
[2:17:43] and God let him do it but brother I
[2:17:46] trust by the grace of God will be like
[2:17:47] Jo and all the in all this job didn't
[2:17:50] see him he didn't charge God foolishly
[2:17:52] he didn't blame it on God no not but not
[2:17:57] by any means but but the Christian goes
[2:17:59] forth by faith trusting the Lord Amen
[2:18:04] and I know it's unfortunate that that
[2:18:08] too many are getting caught up with the
[2:18:10] tree of knowledge of good and evil
[2:18:11] that's the internet the internet is a
[2:18:15] tree of knowledge of good and evil
[2:18:17] brother whatever we get involved with
[2:18:20] there or what do we see there while we
[2:18:22] contact there stay with the word and
[2:18:24] keep your faith moving forward because
[2:18:29] they're going by what going by this
[2:18:30] going by that but they're not going by
[2:18:32] faith or they believe this oh yeah I
[2:18:37] believe that yeah but one with the word
[2:18:39] do you bleeds word god help us ever an
[2:18:45] hour that our faith is being challenged
[2:18:47] our faith in God is this our
[2:18:53] he said the road to Damascus changed
[2:18:57] Paul going down he's at about 11 o'clock
[2:19:01] perhaps for the day that he was stricken
[2:19:04] down and he heard a voice Saul why
[2:19:07] persecutest thou me and he looked up and
[2:19:10] looking up being a Jew and knew that the
[2:19:13] pillar of fire was the Lord and that had
[2:19:16] led the children of Israel because he
[2:19:18] knew that was what it was basically must
[2:19:24] mean something terrific for Paul he said
[2:19:28] to find out that all at once he had been
[2:19:30] persecuting his ambitions that Drott him
[2:19:33] further away from the main thing that he
[2:19:36] meant to do and and what a great shock
[2:19:39] it must have been to the apostille when
[2:19:42] he said he said I am Jesus whom thou
[2:19:45] persecute us the very one that he was
[2:19:48] persecuting why persecutest thou me
[2:19:51] another little quotation we ought to
[2:19:54] drop in here he said you see as they
[2:19:56] make fun of the church they're not
[2:19:58] really making in front of the church
[2:19:59] they're making fun of Jesus why
[2:20:04] persecutest thou me
[2:20:05] how could paul then with all of his
[2:20:07] intellect believe that this was this
[2:20:10] this group that he was persecuting was
[2:20:12] the very god that he was claiming to
[2:20:14] serve and i think he said without going
[2:20:17] in the detail I think we're all well
[2:20:19] trained enough to know what I mean here
[2:20:21] he said the same thing is happening
[2:20:23] today and that's the truth there are
[2:20:27] those that will persecute the truth
[2:20:28] persecute the word and persecute the
[2:20:31] bride he said what a thing it must have
[2:20:34] been for Paul
[2:20:35] he said now he knew that he had an
[2:20:38] experience see here is another good
[2:20:41] lesson for us that experience alone
[2:20:43] isn't enough it's got to be an
[2:20:45] experience according to the Word of God
[2:20:48] a man where's your experience according
[2:20:55] to the word
[2:21:00] so once seeing this and knowing that it
[2:21:04] was a great something that somebody else
[2:21:06] had received it before him he took three
[2:21:08] years and six months down in a desert in
[2:21:12] Arabia taking the Bible as it was then
[2:21:15] and going down there to compare this
[2:21:17] experience that he had and see if it was
[2:21:20] scriptural yeah after he had that
[2:21:22] experience he went three years and
[2:21:24] studied the word over three years see
[2:21:31] three years and a half down there lay
[2:21:34] lying in the word and finding out that
[2:21:36] the very God that called him was taking
[2:21:39] him back and changing all of his
[2:21:41] intellect changing all that he ever
[2:21:42] thought all that he was trained to be
[2:21:45] just wiped it away from him and he
[2:21:48] become a prisoner the love of God has
[2:21:52] been so tremendous and such a revelation
[2:21:54] that he could not get away from it
[2:21:57] that's the true experience of every
[2:22:00] believer who meets God Amen it's a
[2:22:04] revelation of the divine love of God
[2:22:07] amen today a service of Christ we become
[2:22:15] ernest hooked up and we can't go without
[2:22:18] it being an artist to the word no matter
[2:22:21] what anybody else says you are earnest
[2:22:23] to the word and he so there's something
[2:22:26] about it that you just can't get away
[2:22:28] from and he had leaned on the backside
[2:22:33] of the arabian desert with all the
[2:22:35] former things and experiences and
[2:22:37] ambitions and he been stripped of those
[2:22:40] things and now that's where we find
[2:22:43] today that we must be stripped first and
[2:22:46] people don't want to be stripped the
[2:22:50] methodist brother wants to hold a little
[2:22:51] of his methodist teaching the baptist
[2:22:55] brother wants all a little bit of his
[2:22:57] baptist teaching but he's you've got to
[2:22:59] be absolutely be stripped of everything
[2:23:02] and just born again afresh and take up
[2:23:07] from here as the Holy Spirit leads you
[2:23:09] you can't say well my daddy said
[2:23:13] when he got it in the church he shook
[2:23:15] hands with the pastor he's a real good
[2:23:17] loyal member that might have been all
[2:23:19] right for his race but we're in another
[2:23:22] race a man we come back to the Bible
[2:23:26] times for this day the priest was honest
[2:23:29] too but you see they come over into the
[2:23:32] another dispensation and they failed to
[2:23:34] strip off their old Ernests and put a
[2:23:37] new ernest and the same thing we find a
[2:23:40] day we did come through a denominational
[2:23:42] age and we as we through the church ages
[2:23:45] the Bible and so forth but he said we
[2:23:48] have come to a free age where the Holy
[2:23:51] Spirit Himself comes down vindicates
[2:23:53] himself makes himself known makes every
[2:23:56] promise that he promises come to pass
[2:23:59] what a great time we're living in he
[2:24:02] knew he could not go to places that
[2:24:06] being honest to this ambitious missions
[2:24:08] drew him amongst brethren where he was
[2:24:13] invited to come and yet he was pressed
[2:24:16] in the spirit it wasn't his own he was a
[2:24:21] prisoner a finish here well God make us
[2:24:30] prisoners from our own selfish ambition
[2:24:37] from our own judgments and our better
[2:24:41] way of thinking to be a prisoner of
[2:24:46] Jesus Christ amen
[2:24:49] I think that was a great statement that
[2:24:52] Paul made I am a prisoner to Jesus
[2:24:55] Christ amen
[2:24:58] now he said he could not go certain
[2:25:00] places that he wanted because why did
[2:25:03] the spirit forbade him he was a prisoner
[2:25:06] of Christ
[2:25:07] you remember many times that I was
[2:25:09] trying to go someplace thinking there is
[2:25:11] where I could have a great meeting but
[2:25:13] the Spirit forbade him amen and brother
[2:25:17] sometimes we have failed to do this bill
[2:25:20] to do that but the Holy Ghost is there
[2:25:22] if we're a prison of Christ the Holy
[2:25:23] Ghost is there to stop us
[2:25:26] amen not to do our own will but to do
[2:25:29] the will of God the whole host is there
[2:25:31] as we are prisoners of Christ to keep us
[2:25:34] in the will of God by the grace of God
[2:25:36] amen
[2:25:40] and he addressed it to the venom
[2:25:43] tyrannical he said Oh tonight if we as
[2:25:47] the Branham tabernacle could only become
[2:25:49] prisoners to our selfish means to our
[2:25:54] own ambition that we could completely
[2:25:57] surrender ourselves and be yoked to
[2:26:00] Christ no matter what the rest of the
[2:26:03] world thinks while the rest of the world
[2:26:05] does we are yoked with fitters of love
[2:26:08] we are prisoners and my feet are yoked
[2:26:11] to Christ amen
[2:26:14] he said it turns my head my heart is so
[2:26:17] yoked to him and in love to him I can't
[2:26:21] have love for this world anymore my will
[2:26:25] is so yoked to him till I don't even
[2:26:28] know what my ambitions are just whatever
[2:26:32] you lead I'll follow Lord I will be a
[2:26:36] pretty a man not my will don't be done
[2:26:40] amen
[2:26:41] grace of God that we are Lord willing
[2:26:44] eventually finished the quotes in Paula
[2:26:46] prisoner but again to follow the same
[2:26:49] thought in the message on Christ as the
[2:26:52] mystery of God revealed and perfect
[2:26:54] faith amen
[2:26:56] thank God and brother it's another
[2:27:00] mystery of the seven seals
[2:27:01] I believe God did this because just
[2:27:05] shortly after this as I said the Lord
[2:27:08] said brother branham that's it that's it
[2:27:11] that's finished now he said go back into
[2:27:13] evangelism and he did until the Lord
[2:27:16] took him home amen thank God for the
[2:27:19] word this day
[2:27:27] again just make sure we keep all the
[2:27:31] Saints in prayer and it's an including
[2:27:34] our brother Bob's sister Brenda and
[2:27:36] brother Matthew and sister amber the
