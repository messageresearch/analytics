[47:30] the bread but grace to us to give us the
[47:33] revelation of what it means grace to
[47:36] give us the revelation of what it
[47:37] represents your many gonna take it but
[47:40] it's just a form of godliness amen and
[47:43] they're going to take it as as the Bible
[47:45] indicates in Corinthians they're gonna
[47:48] take it casually you know and many many
[47:51] will take it casually why it's just it's
[47:53] just a tradition they've done it so
[47:56] often it become common to them but for
[47:59] the true believer brother it brings it
[48:01] brings us to Calvary a man the reality
[48:04] of Calvary in our hearts a man by the
[48:07] grace of God so we're not going to join
[48:10] to a tradition it's just not just always
[48:12] just a bring cup cup of wine and and
[48:15] it's just some unleavened bread no
[48:19] brothers sister in our hearts it's
[48:22] revealing a revelation of what it

[48:26] of our Lord Jesus Christ and what he did
[48:30] to redeem us what he did to bring us
[48:32] here tonight today Amen by the grace of
[48:35] God to fellowship one with another with
[48:38] a hope not not just a religious form but
[48:42] it is the Blessed hope of eternal life
[48:44] why because we've been redeemed hey man
[48:48] I've been redeemed you
[48:50] a man we want to show the Lord we
[48:52] appreciate it
[48:53] a man by doing this in remembrance of
[48:56] him by the grace of God so God be the
[48:59] glory
[49:00] so by trust that your heart will be in
[49:02] it not your head but your heart not just
[49:04] your hands and your mouth but your heart
[49:06] a man we're going to predict of the
[49:09] natural bread the natural wine my
[49:11] brother it's going to want to have a
[49:13] revelation in our hearts by the grace of
[49:16] God we're going to tell you with
[49:18] understanding we're going to take it
[49:19] with revelation we're going to tell you
[49:21] with an experience with with the one
[49:24] that it represents that I've had an
[49:26] experience with Jesus a man and the life
[49:28] of the blood that He shed is in me and
[49:31] the life of the blood that He shed is in
[49:33] you by the grace of God that is the
[49:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the life of
[49:38] the blood coming in to us amen
[49:41] so I trust we have the baptism of the
[49:43] Holy Ghost I trust we have the evidence
[49:45] of the Holy Ghost believing believing
[49:47] God believing the word walking in the
[49:50] light a man representing reflecting
[49:53] Jesus Christ so that it's not you the
[49:55] lives is Christ that liveth in you he
[49:58] said I'll not leave you comfortless I
[49:59] will come to you as I said that brother
[50:02] one time a certain pastor and he was
[50:05] trying to prove to me a Trinity and
[50:08] again he gave me that verse in John and
[50:11] he said I pray the Father this is what
[50:14] he quoted he said one and he Jesus was
[50:17] one he said I pray the Father - he said
[50:20] give you another comforter three and
[50:22] that was his evidence as far as he was
[50:26] concerned it proved that God is in three
[50:28] persons it is a Trinity until finally I
[50:32] went back and I said brother you should
[50:34] have went on a little further a man you
[50:36] should have read I said a few more
[50:38] verses I stood the whole truth nothing
[50:40] but the truth
[50:41] a man man shall not live by bread alone
[50:43] but the word of all the Word of God and
[50:45] I said don't add to it and don't take
[50:47] from it so I said now go on down and
[50:50] Jesus said I'll not leave you
[50:52] comfortless and he said I will come to
[50:54] you a man and so I said then he said you
[50:58] will I said there'll be a relationship
[50:59] there have been experience he said
[51:01] you'll know that I'm in the father the
[51:03] father of me I
[51:04] you you and me a man so praise the name
[51:07] of the Lord is not three persons is one
[51:09] and he's just moving one to the other
[51:11] because Phillips had show us the father
[51:13] he said you mean you don't know me
[51:16] he said he that sees me sees the father
[51:18] a man so thank God for the word brother
[51:21] it's basic it's simple so we think of
[51:24] for bringing us to the revelation Oh
[51:27] the guardian a man so that when we
[51:30] brother were going from time to eternity
[51:32] we know who to look for
[51:33] amen we know who we're going to see and
[51:36] it's Oh what it's going to be the father
[51:38] and there's gonna be the son that gonna
[51:39] be the Holy Ghost well it's gonna be
[51:41] Jesus it's gonna be our Lord our Savior
[51:43] Jesus Christ amen
[51:45] so he said I and the father 1:3 brings
[51:48] in it brings us into a oneness with him
[51:50] as well by the grace of God so thank God
[51:53] for the revelation a man so help us to
[51:57] be sincere help us to appreciate what
[51:59] God has done but appreciate what God's
[52:02] doing
[52:02] amen for if you recognize what he's done
[52:05] you'll recognize what he's doing a man
[52:08] truly honestly sincerely by the grace of
[52:10] God so let's be in prayer every going to
[52:14] the word and going from the word to the
[52:17] communion and I'll try not to be too
[52:19] long and I was thinking of going into
[52:26] doing God a service without his will
[52:28] because I felt that was going from
[52:31] hearing and seeing the word I have heard
[52:34] but now I see but here at God's Way see
[52:36] it God's Way and I said you've got to
[52:38] have a right motive a right objective
[52:40] and so on if not God doesn't recognize
[52:42] it a man and I'm going from there to
[52:46] doing God a service why are why are we
[52:48] going to do this where are we going to
[52:50] do to do that we're hearing this we're
[52:52] seeing that and we got this motive and
[52:54] this objective and brother why why are
[52:57] you here why do you believe this why are
[52:59] you living this why are you taking this
[53:01] this stand for the Word of God a man
[53:04] brothers good you got to have a right
[53:06] motor right objective and the right
[53:08] motive and the right objective in our
[53:09] hearts is for the glory of God amen you
[53:13] know what it is is to give him the glory
[53:15] for what he's done
[53:17] for what he's doing a man don't take it
[53:20] casual don't take it for granted
[53:21] by the grace of God amen but just just
[53:25] take it really serious and and let let
[53:28] our lives reflect that we've got the
[53:30] experience of Calvary in us they met
[53:34] that as he died laid down his life so we
[53:37] lay down our lives for him a man and he
[53:39] gave us his life to pick up amen to go
[53:42] from time to eternity by the grace of
[53:45] God so I trust that it's real to us that
[53:48] it's just not religion it's just not a
[53:50] doctrine it's not a fairy tale oh it's a
[53:52] nice story and so on no no it's a
[53:55] reality it's a revelation a man of God
[53:59] we're dealing with a real God we're
[54:02] dealing with the real Lord Jesus Christ
[54:04] brother is not history he's not back
[54:06] there 2,000 years he's here a man he
[54:09] said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[54:11] you so that same Jesus brothers sisters
[54:15] that laid down his life the same Jesus
[54:17] that suffered what he suffered and
[54:20] endured what he endured sirs for our
[54:22] salvation he's here
[54:24] amen because what he did he's here to
[54:27] make it flesh in you and me amen
[54:29] so again again and again through the
[54:32] Scriptures is not me or you that lives
[54:35] is Christ that's living in you so the
[54:37] life that you have lived this week was
[54:39] it Jesus in you was that Christ living
[54:42] in you was a Christ using your mind your
[54:45] thoughts your feelings brother amen so
[54:47] that they're looking at you and say well
[54:49] that's not natural that's not that's not
[54:52] them no no it's another power is another
[54:54] anointing and that's why we have the
[54:56] attitude that we have we have the spirit
[54:58] that we have we have the we react the
[55:00] way we react or act the way we act why
[55:03] because it's another life on the inside
[55:05] of us it's another life in our souls and
[55:08] again forget mom and dad and grandma and
[55:11] grandpa we don't want their natures we
[55:13] want the nature of Christ amen by the
[55:16] grace of God and brother the communion
[55:19] is causing us to go back and remember
[55:22] how that we get the nature of Christ
[55:25] amen now that I am what I am by the
[55:28] grace of God
[55:31] man to God be the glory so the Lord

[56:35] getting worse people are getting worse

[1:08:59] Matthew's Gospel chapter 26 a man you
[1:09:07] can keep it in mind to see what the Lord
[1:09:08] will do in Israel today because it's the
[1:09:13] today they're going to have a Feast of
[1:09:15] Trumpets a man and the prophet of God
[1:09:19] said that the seventh seal is for the
[1:09:22] bride for the Gentiles he said the
[1:09:24] seventh trumpet assists for Israel a man
[1:09:27] so god blessed them as they observed
[1:09:30] this Feast of Trumpets a man to God be
[1:09:33] the glory a man it is later than we
[1:09:36] think and in verse 26 of Matthew 26 and
[1:09:41] as they were eating Jesus took bread and
[1:09:46] blessed it and brake it and gave it to
[1:09:51] the disciples and said take eat this is
[1:09:59] my body and he took the cup and gave
[1:10:03] thanks and gave it to them saying drink
[1:10:07] ye all of it for this is my blood of the
[1:10:13] New Testament which is shed for many for
[1:10:18] the remission of sins thank God that
[1:10:22] he's got he's taking our sins away thank
[1:10:25] God that he's cast our sins into the sea
[1:10:29] of his forgetfulness and verse 29 but I
[1:10:33] say unto you I will not drink it's worth
[1:10:37] of this fruit of the vine until that day
[1:10:41] when I drink it new with you in my
[1:10:44] father's Kingdom and he's drinking he
[1:10:50] said of this fruit of the vine praise
[1:10:54] the Lord this is what his life produced
[1:10:57] this is what he did in his life to
[1:11:01] redeem us a man and when they had sung
[1:11:05] and him they went out into the Mount of
[1:11:09] Olives god bless his words you may be
[1:11:12] seated
[1:11:16] turn with me to first Corinthians
[1:11:18] chapter 10 first Corinthians chapter 10
[1:11:29] and as I indicated I was maybe thinking
[1:11:34] of going further with a message of doing
[1:11:37] God a service without his will wrong
[1:11:42] motive wrong objective not hearing and
[1:11:46] seen the word the way that God would
[1:11:49] want us to hear and see it so we end up
[1:11:51] doing God a service but not according to
[1:11:53] his will not according to his word the
[1:11:56] will of God is the word of God they met
[1:11:58] but we'll get to build we'll get back to
[1:12:00] that in another service but so it's not
[1:12:04] to take too long this afternoon that I
[1:12:07] want to share with you again some
[1:12:10] thoughts from again the last message
[1:12:13] that brother Branham preached and it was
[1:12:17] communion and really it wasn't a sermon
[1:12:21] that he preached because brother Perry
[1:12:24] Greene had preached and brother Branham
[1:12:27] was asked to come up because they were
[1:12:29] going to have communion and brother Han
[1:12:31] came up and made some comments and some
[1:12:34] thoughts concerning communion this was
[1:12:37] after our brother Perry Greene had
[1:12:39] ministered in Tucson Tabernacle but this
[1:12:43] was December the 12th 1965 and it was
[1:12:49] six days later that brother Branham
[1:12:53] experienced the accident
[1:12:54] when he was on his way from Tucson to
[1:12:57] Jeffersonville six days after he spoke
[1:13:02] concerning communion it's amazing that
[1:13:05] the last message it didn't have to do
[1:13:07] with the seals it didn't have to do with
[1:13:10] the the church aegis it didn't have to
[1:13:13] do with that he was ministering to the
[1:13:14] bride a man who had come out of all
[1:13:17] these things and was entering in more
[1:13:20] and more into the Word of God a man by
[1:13:23] the grace of God so he ministered on
[1:13:25] communion and again as I said I want to
[1:13:30] highlight that God still requires us to
[1:13:33] take communion a man I know that there
[1:13:37] are believers who don't take communion
[1:13:40] and they feel that we don't have to take
[1:13:42] communion and they feel that we have
[1:13:44] entered by the opening of the word and
[1:13:46] the revelation of the seals that we have
[1:13:48] entered into a spiritual communion and
[1:13:50] we are feasting spiritually on the word
[1:13:53] and drinking the word brother than
[1:13:56] eating the word but again
[1:13:59] nowhere are we instructed to stop taking
[1:14:03] the bread and the wine while we are yet
[1:14:05] in this less a man well we're yet in
[1:14:08] this flesh and where we are yet
[1:14:10] experiencing sin and unbelief even in
[1:14:13] our flesh and all around us we need to
[1:14:15] take this representation a man of our
[1:14:18] deliverance from the influence of sin
[1:14:21] from the influence of the world the
[1:14:24] flesh and the devil
[1:14:26] a man brother we're gonna as I've said
[1:14:28] as for as long as we are in this body
[1:14:31] been in this flesh that was born in sin
[1:14:34] as shaped in iniquity we need communion
[1:14:38] we need to remind ourselves a man of
[1:14:42] what God has done a man to redeem us of
[1:14:45] what God has done to take away our sin
[1:14:48] and what God has done to cast our sin
[1:14:51] into the sea of forgetfulness what God
[1:14:53] has done to bring us to a place where as
[1:14:56] the Providence said or the Bible says
[1:14:58] that no man can lay a charge against
[1:15:00] God's elect why is because of what he
[1:15:04] did 2,000 years ago and because of
[1:15:08] we're going to remember a man through
[1:15:10] the bread and the wine and the same God
[1:15:12] for a man this is our Redemption praise
[1:15:17] the name of the Lord we're not going by
[1:15:19] just by the letter of the word by going
[1:15:21] by the spirit of the word and brother
[1:15:23] the Holy Ghost reveals to us yes what
[1:15:26] God has done and what God is doing what
[1:15:29] God will do but the Holy Ghost is
[1:15:31] revealing to us our redemption through
[1:15:33] Calvary a man oh what I'm redeemed there
[1:15:36] I'm redeemed there but again there's no
[1:15:38] redemption without Calvary there's no
[1:15:41] redemption without what Jesus did a man
[1:15:44] this in the third pull of his ministry a
[1:15:47] man he came and he did this he did that
[1:15:50] just thing his ministry was only three
[1:15:53] and a half years a man and then he then
[1:15:56] he had come to the third pole and he
[1:15:58] knew he knew what he had to do and
[1:16:00] brother there was a change in in Jesus
[1:16:03] when he was in flesh and brother they
[1:16:06] ought to be a change in the bright as
[1:16:07] long as we are in this race as we
[1:16:10] approach the third pole brother of the
[1:16:13] word of God for this hour burger that
[1:16:15] the world autumn's knew a change in us
[1:16:17] our families ought to see a change in us
[1:16:19] brother we ought to see a change in one
[1:16:21] another we ought to know that something
[1:16:22] is about to happen as brother they'd
[1:16:25] they they saw a change in Jesus the
[1:16:27] disciples saw a change in Jesus brother
[1:16:29] he even the scribes and the Pharisees
[1:16:31] and the Jews and those that Jesus
[1:16:34] administered true they saw a change in
[1:16:36] him when he was approaching the third
[1:16:38] pull of his ministry a man but there's
[1:16:41] not just settling in and say yeah I
[1:16:43] believe God did this I believe God did
[1:16:44] that so yeah it's all over now we're
[1:16:46] just waiting for the resurrection
[1:16:48] waiting with the rapture but as I said
[1:16:49] God is waiting for you God is waiting on
[1:16:52] me amen because why'd the resurrection
[1:16:55] rapture is in me as well as it was back
[1:16:58] then we're waiting on Jesus the whole
[1:17:00] world was waiting on Jesus the father
[1:17:02] was waiting on Jesus ain't mad buff and
[1:17:06] the Holy Spirit as they were waiting
[1:17:07] waiting for this to happen but it had to
[1:17:10] happen there was no other way that it
[1:17:12] could be done amen and Jesus went in and
[1:17:16] he said as the worse he sweat as it were
[1:17:18] great drops of blood a
[1:17:20] and yet cemani he was so stressed with
[1:17:23] what with the revelation of what he knew
[1:17:26] was going to happen so stressed with the
[1:17:28] revelation of what he knew that that he
[1:17:30] had to experience a man not just in not
[1:17:34] just on Calvary but on his way to
[1:17:36] Calvary even he was going to suffer much
[1:17:39] brothers for the Bride of Christ in this
[1:17:41] are we're going going to experience that
[1:17:44] stress a man for the resurrection that
[1:17:47] stress when the rapture and getting at a
[1:17:49] time into eternity because I turned to
[1:17:51] this for that to happen in our lives
[1:17:53] we're gonna live that we're gonna have
[1:17:54] the yield amen to the prophecy a man of
[1:17:58] this hour in this age a man listen it's
[1:18:01] going to be so serious that he said if
[1:18:03] he didn't shorten time there be no flesh
[1:18:05] say and it's going to be so serious that
[1:18:07] Jesus said he said when the Son of Man
[1:18:09] comes will he find faith on the earth a
[1:18:11] man oh yes brother we got faith we
[1:18:14] believe in what God has done no no no no
[1:18:17] no there are many and I would say most
[1:18:19] belief so-called believers today are
[1:18:22] under under under Malachi 4 they don't
[1:18:24] really believe the message they don't
[1:18:26] really really believe what God has done
[1:18:27] they don't really believe what God is
[1:18:29] doing but then it's gonna get fewer and
[1:18:32] fewer and fewer as I say there's
[1:18:34] something like 2 million or more around
[1:18:35] the world that say they believe Malachi
[1:18:38] 4 that say they believe God has sent a
[1:18:40] prophet and so on but like I said so
[1:18:42] does the devil but again the devil is
[1:18:45] not going to live it
[1:18:46] but brother Jael impersonate it a man
[1:18:49] and he's going to head to it he's going

[1:29:01] grandfather Goldie and he oh yeah it you
[1:29:05] know he couldn't he wouldn't go to read
[1:29:08] this book but he read this one oh yeah
[1:29:13] they they there's no good to give him
[1:29:14] any any any other books he wouldn't be
[1:29:17] to read them he couldn't read but they
[1:29:20] says he would spend all day reading the
[1:29:21] Bible oh yeah
[1:29:24] and I remember when I was there one time
[1:29:26] and where he was living you any of
[1:29:28] course he was sister Goulding's mother
[1:29:30] father-in-law and so on and I was there
[1:29:33] and he came out and I would see I could
[1:29:36] see him now and he was leaning on and on
[1:29:37] a stove on the oven and then he said
[1:29:40] Earl I got a question and he said it's
[1:29:43] in the Bible and he said he was just
[1:29:46] reading in the Bible
[1:29:47] and he says it refers to God as being
[1:29:49] terrible and any and he said is God
[1:29:53] terrible I said yes he is but I said
[1:29:57] that that terrible doesn't mean I it
[1:29:58] doesn't mean I said what we think it
[1:30:00] means I said in the English I said when
[1:30:02] it comes to the bio it means he's great
[1:30:04] and that means a he's powerful he says
[1:30:06] he's a high above all the rest
[1:30:08] and I said that means he's so terrible
[1:30:10] in in his power so terrible in his

[1:40:27] enter in to the joys of the Lord amen
[1:40:31] brother we got to have the right
[1:40:33] password and it's not William Brennan
[1:40:35] and it's not just so over the seven
[1:40:37] seals it is not this or that read this
[1:40:40] revelation of what God has done
[1:40:41] don't other agents are done in this age
[1:40:44] and God has revealed this and God has
[1:40:46] revealed that no brother I tell you
[1:40:48] regardless of his Luther's age
[1:40:50] it was justification in Christ his faith
[1:40:54] was in Christ
[1:40:55] Wesley Christ amen the baptism of the
[1:40:58] Holy Ghost is Christ yes a man and now
[1:41:01] the oatmeal the word that mighty angel
[1:41:03] descending from heaven with a shout its
[1:41:04] Christ our faith is not just in what
[1:41:08] they did it's in the word amen
[1:41:12] because they're under the control of the
[1:41:14] word and brothers sister I trust what we
[1:41:18] got the Passover got the past word
[1:41:20] rather by the grace of God amen
[1:41:23] as we go into the communion God grace
[1:41:28] Passover
[1:41:33] listen brothers is serious and if
[1:41:40] there's anything very serious I think
[1:41:42] when it comes to brother Brennan was
[1:41:44] communion he did say to our brother from
[1:41:47] Africa one time and he said well he said
[1:41:49] maybe this church is better than us he
[1:41:51] said because they take communion every
[1:41:52] month or take me and every Sunday rather
[1:41:55] and he said we only do it once a month
[1:41:58] maybe we should take it every Sunday he
[1:42:00] said you know and so on why because he
[1:42:03] recognized the significance and the
[1:42:06] importance of the communion God forgive
[1:42:09] us for delaying it as long as we have if
[1:42:12] we need to be reminded more and more and
[1:42:14] more of the price that was paid
[1:42:17] we got see if you're going if you're
[1:42:20] gonna live in humility brother is the
[1:42:22] constant revelation of what he did to
[1:42:25] redeem us that humble you amen
[1:42:29] Lord I was born this way but you had to
[1:42:31] do this to get me back
[1:42:33] you did it Lord to show your love now
[1:42:37] lord help me to do it to show my love
[1:42:40] for what you did to show my love for you
[1:42:43] amen to show our love for one another by
[1:42:46] the grace of God so brother let me say
[1:42:50] again six days after he exhorted on this
[1:42:54] was the accident and we know that sister
[1:42:59] Branham was killed in the accident she
[1:43:04] died but just think the proper God he
[1:43:10] told his son brother Billy Paul he said
[1:43:12] put my hand on her he couldn't do it
[1:43:15] himself but Billy Billy Paul reached out
[1:43:18] and got brother Browns right hand and he
[1:43:20] laid it on her and he prayed and she
[1:43:23] came back to life yeah Billy Paul told
[1:43:28] the round she's gone she's not breathing
[1:43:30] and she did but he prayed God bring her
[1:43:34] back
[1:43:35] I don't doubt what brother Brown felt in
[1:43:37] himself that he was going a man because
[1:43:41] six days after after this sermon is the
[1:43:45] accident at six days after the accident
[1:43:48] the prophet went home to be with the
[1:43:52] Lord amen so I don't think these
[1:43:56] thoughts right here are just coincidence
[1:44:00] or just so that just happened just
[1:44:03] before he died that's all no no I
[1:44:06] believe it was for a reason amen because
[1:44:09] when he had come to the end of all
[1:44:11] things he needed communion amen he
[1:44:14] needed the life of the blood that was
[1:44:16] represented in the wine a man we needed
[1:44:20] a life of the blood of the body that's
[1:44:22] represented in the bread please God help
[1:44:26] us to believe he was wounded for our
[1:44:28] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:44:31] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:44:33] was upon him and with His stripes we are
[1:44:36] healed
[1:44:37] even unto the change of our bodies the
[1:44:41] prophecy if you can't believe for divine
[1:44:43] healing how can you believe for the
[1:44:44] rapture and the devil is getting us more
[1:44:50] and more caught up with natural things
[1:44:51] than spiritual Satan is getting getting
[1:44:54] us caught up with those things what for
[1:44:56] it is to weaken and do away with our
[1:44:58] faith for healing you know we want to
[1:45:03] heal ourselves now more and more and
[1:45:10] more Peter getting caught up with that
[1:45:12] yeah brother sister I tell you the more
[1:45:18] and more the devil put your emphasis on
[1:45:20] this and this and this and this
[1:45:22] that's the less and less and less faith
[1:45:24] we have because we got this much faith
[1:45:27] and the devil saying no this okay this
[1:45:31] my straight no and and faith is getting
[1:45:33] less and less and less no wonder Jesus
[1:45:36] said when he can't really find faith on
[1:45:37] the earth and you know what our brother
[1:45:40] Scofield said
[1:45:42] that faith was he said faith he said
[1:45:45] belief in the whole body of revealed
[1:45:48] truth
[1:45:48] I let be honest there's not many I
[1:45:52] believe in it the whole body of revealed
[1:45:55] truth they're gonna believe concerning
[1:45:58] the seals but they won't believe
[1:45:59] communion it's amazing they're gonna
[1:46:06] believe concerning the seal but there
[1:46:07] and believe all I see it and I hear it
[1:46:10] and so on no no they're not hearing it
[1:46:12] or seeing the way God wants them to if
[1:46:14] they hear it and see it the way God
[1:46:16] wants you to hear and see it you're
[1:46:17] gonna produce the life that God wants to
[1:46:21] see grace to us he said I believe he
[1:46:35] said I want to say this before we start
[1:46:36] the communion and I believe that we are
[1:46:39] we have seen enough in our day that we
[1:46:42] live in that we ought to really give all
[1:46:45] of our being to God don't just give him
[1:46:49] your time for Sunday and Wednesday and
[1:46:52] oh your prayer and the more your your
[1:46:54] your grace at the table no no you got to

[1:47:09] daughters are gotta led by the Spirit of
[1:47:11] God not just Sunday and Wednesdays

[1:47:23] we should really serve God okay are you

[1:48:33] Scripture he said we are not blind we
[1:48:39] are here we've arrived and he said we
[1:48:43] can look around and see that the way
[1:48:45] that the human mind is leaving the
[1:48:47] people oh my what would he say today he
[1:48:51] said that we can't stay too much longer
[1:48:54] he said we be in a complete insane
[1:48:57] institution and we would it's like I
[1:49:05] said when someone that I know went into
[1:49:09] the Waterford hospital and they were
[1:49:13] nervous they're going to visit somebody
[1:49:17] they said oh he said I can I go with I
[1:49:22] want something with me to protect me
[1:49:25] and she saw two people going up the
[1:49:30] aisle dressed a certain way
[1:49:31] oh he said to their Christian they
[1:49:35] belong to a certain church so she went
[1:49:38] up and got between them and walked down
[1:49:41] the aisle only to discover that they
[1:49:46] were also two patients but she didn't
[1:49:49] know that yeah I'll tell I'll tell them
[1:49:53] she got down the aisle somewhere and
[1:49:55] they did someone identified them as two
[1:49:58] patients what
[1:50:00] oh yeah they were dressed the way they
[1:50:03] were because of something wrong with
[1:50:04] their minds yeah so brother-sister we're
[1:50:09] living in an insane as an institution
[1:50:11] yeah I see that insanity like I said
[1:50:15] everywhere would no matter where I go
[1:50:17] and again we were even at a supermarket
[1:50:22] the other day and I saw saw this lady go
[1:50:25] by while she's dressed like the world
[1:50:28] but I never seen it before the way she
[1:50:35] had her hair personally
[1:50:38] I don't think it was her hair she me she
[1:50:42] was leaving the impression that it was
[1:50:43] you know the way it was everything was
[1:50:45] done on her head but I'll tell you it
[1:50:47] was way up and I said what in the world
[1:50:49] is that never seen it before
[1:50:52] I said that's insane and it is oh yeah
[1:50:57] it was back here like that
[1:50:59] and it looked like her hair was all you
[1:51:00] know were platted and and wrapped here
[1:51:03] and here and there sticking up there
[1:51:04] sticking up there and goodness that's
[1:51:07] the Lord I said the world is insane I
[1:51:10] said want me it is not going to be it is
[1:51:15] oh yeah he said we being in a complete
[1:51:23] and sane institution the whole world
[1:51:25] would be we are at the end time and he
[1:51:30] says brother green ended up there seeing
[1:51:32] these things are true and they are true
[1:51:34] they're not a myth he said they are not
[1:51:37] just something that we imagine there's
[1:51:40] something that's been directly given to
[1:51:41] us by the Word of God and manifested
[1:51:44] publicly before us and we know we are
[1:51:47] here we are at the time a man it is the
[1:51:52] time of insanity and brother that shows
[1:51:56] the devil's taking control grace to us
[1:52:05] he said anything
[1:52:07] as a beginning as an end but he says
[1:52:09] that which had not a beginning has no
[1:52:11] end and we're fixing to observe
[1:52:13] something here that's really sacred and
[1:52:16] he said I call on a few days ago but
[1:52:20] some very fine Christian gentleman
[1:52:22] that's never had this and he understood
[1:52:24] that we take communion literally and
[1:52:26] they take it what they call spiritual
[1:52:29] communion yeah just believers that feel
[1:52:31] that they're taking spiritual communion
[1:52:33] but they want take it literally they
[1:52:38] don't feel we got to do that now but
[1:52:41] again let me say as long as we're in
[1:52:43] this flesh we got to take it long as
[1:52:45] we're fighting sin and an unbelief we
[1:52:48] got to take communion
[1:52:49] amen because our faith is in the
[1:52:52] finished work of Calvary we got the
[1:52:55] victory through Calvary and he said that
[1:52:59] reason I'm saying this so that you would
[1:53:02] understand what you're doing and he said
[1:53:04] you walk into into anything blindly and
[1:53:06] you don't know what you're doing if you
[1:53:09] can't even have a confidence if you
[1:53:11] don't know what you're doing but you
[1:53:14] must understand that you are doing what
[1:53:17] you are doing and why you are doing it
[1:53:20] you must understand what you're doing
[1:53:24] not just a tradition or a church thing
[1:53:28] no no it's the reality to me is Lord
[1:53:34] this represents you what you said
[1:53:36] represents your blood and the bread were
[1:53:38] ever sending your body and brother I'll
[1:53:40] tell you it was beaten as I said before
[1:53:43] when it comes through pictures of the
[1:53:45] crucifixion most pictures the
[1:53:47] crucifixion are not the way they should
[1:53:49] be
[1:53:50] because he was totally red with blood
[1:53:56] remember he shed his blood and brother
[1:53:59] not being satisfied with all the all the
[1:54:02] everything on his but on his body where
[1:54:05] where they whipped him and whipped him
[1:54:07] and whipped him and he bled and bled and
[1:54:09] bled brother they went and drove that
[1:54:11] spear into his side so that the blood
[1:54:15] wasn't just on the cross but the
[1:54:17] province of the blood went down to the
[1:54:19] earth
[1:54:19] he said to redeem there and he said the
[1:54:24] he said the life of the blood comes back
[1:54:25] to you and me how many really recognize
[1:54:30] the life of the blood in you and they
[1:54:32] really appreciate it and they are really
[1:54:38] grateful with the reality of the life of
[1:54:42] the blood cardi Alice he said you must
[1:54:49] understand why you're doing it and why
[1:54:52] you are doing it you must understand not
[1:54:55] just tradition it's not a church
[1:54:57] tradition but to a lot of people's
[1:54:59] tradition yeah and if we take the Word
[1:55:05] of God isn't that God that we are taking
[1:55:07] and I said exactly right sir that's true
[1:55:11] but we read here Paul taught taking the
[1:55:15] literal Lord's Supper this do in
[1:55:18] remembrance of me
[1:55:19] this do not this or this or this he said
[1:55:23] this a man
[1:55:26] well I gonna take the word yeah but this
[1:55:30] was what the word did the word was in
[1:55:33] the beginning was the word the Word was
[1:55:34] made flesh and dwelt among us by the
[1:55:36] grace of God so he said we are to take
[1:55:43] it but Paul said the thing in order and
[1:55:46] he was a prophet of the New Testament
[1:55:48] see he said right there we are taken and
[1:55:51] this is the last instruction he gives to
[1:55:53] the bride how can we walk away from it
[1:55:56] we can't do it
[1:55:58] under there they had the sacrificial
[1:56:01] lamb and that Israel kept that for a
[1:56:03] memorial and it was actually used one
[1:56:05] time coming out of Egypt but then they
[1:56:09] kept that as a memorial all down through
[1:56:11] the age well if the law being a shadow
[1:56:14] of things to come they took it now he
[1:56:17] said I do believe that communion is the
[1:56:21] Lord's Supper and we only have three
[1:56:25] physical divine orders left to us
[1:56:28] communion feet washing water about
[1:56:33] he said that's the only three that's
[1:56:35] perfection and he said that's the only
[1:56:39] three orders we have and now he said we
[1:56:42] would say communion should be just
[1:56:44] taking the word yeah he said I don't
[1:56:47] believe anyone has a right to take the
[1:56:49] Lord's Supper until they have taken the
[1:56:52] word into his heart a man so he said
[1:56:58] because I'll read something in a few
[1:57:00] moments
[1:57:01] Ethan on the same basis we could
[1:57:04] absolutely justify the Salvation Army
[1:57:06] and they said they do not believe in any
[1:57:08] form of water baptism they said we don't
[1:57:11] need it and now he said we don't need
[1:57:14] what about Chisolm why are we baptized
[1:57:16] said the water can save you and the
[1:57:18] blood saves you I agree the blood saves
[1:57:21] you not the water but we must take the
[1:57:23] water as an outward emotion that an
[1:57:25] inward work of grace has been done amen
[1:57:29] so we must we also beyond the communion
[1:57:33] when we have taken the Lord our
[1:57:36] sacrifice into us as a matter of
[1:57:38] spiritual birth into us his body
[1:57:42] we live by him by the word we also
[1:57:45] should symbolize it because it's a
[1:57:47] commandment repent every one of you and
[1:57:49] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:51] for the remission of your sins and you
[1:57:55] see there are three things we must do as
[1:58:01] symbols the Lord's Supper people washing
[1:58:05] water baptism now he said the salvation
[1:58:10] army takes it from the point the dying
[1:58:12] thief when he died he wasn't baptized
[1:58:15] Jesus said he would be in heaven that's
[1:58:17] exactly the truth but you see he only
[1:58:20] recognized Jesus right there in the hour
[1:58:22] that he was dying and he said that's the
[1:58:25] only opportunity he was a thief he was
[1:58:28] always out and he was out and he said he
[1:58:32] as soon as he seen that light he
[1:58:35] recognized it Lord remember me that was
[1:58:39] true but you can't use that as an excuse
[1:58:41] to say I don't have to be baptized I
[1:58:43] don't have to take
[1:58:45] you know I don't have to do this what
[1:58:47] brother there's a lot of things that we
[1:58:51] would say we didn't have to do if we
[1:58:53] wanted to use that as an excuse
[1:58:55] brother praise the Lord brother we've
[1:59:01] been on that long we've been on the go
[1:59:03] for a long time beyond what the when it
[1:59:06] comes to Jesus the arm what the thief
[1:59:08] knew he was he was judged by what he
[1:59:12] knew he was judged by history Israel his
[1:59:14] reaction to what was going on and to the
[1:59:17] Christ that was him crucified a man oh I
[1:59:21] believe if he lived he would have been
[1:59:23] baptized if he lived he would have took
[1:59:26] communion most definitely amen
[1:59:30] oh yeah he'd have a greater maybe a
[1:59:32] revelation of appreciation for it than a
[1:59:34] lot of so-called believers today
[1:59:35] considering what he saw and considering
[1:59:38] what he experienced amen the other thing
[1:59:41] just cast Jesus down but that one
[1:59:44] brother what a revelation seed of God
[1:59:48] for him to look at Jesus they didn't
[1:59:50] listen this done this man has done no no
[1:59:52] no bad thing he said we deserve this he
[1:59:56] said to the other thing we deserve this
[1:59:58] but he said he won't but he did it he
[2:00:01] did it for him he did it for you he did
[2:00:06] it for me what are we willing to do for
[2:00:11] him life you don't want to do nothing
[2:00:14] they just want all he's gonna bless me
[2:00:17] he's gonna give me this he's going to
[2:00:19] give me that now that he did that I
[2:00:20] don't have suffer night well we got
[2:00:24] identify with him in his suffering but
[2:00:28] in the Fellowship of his suffering but
[2:00:29] not only in his death that's right there
[2:00:32] that's like brother be like I said
[2:00:34] always said when we're in Pentecost he
[2:00:36] said we only we only took the first part
[2:00:38] of the verse to identify it with him and
[2:00:40] he in his in his death where he laid
[2:00:43] down his life for us picked it up again
[2:00:45] but the Bible but he said go on and he
[2:00:48] said and that Fellowship of his
[2:00:50] suffering they want the first
[2:00:55] but not the less grace to us just a few
[2:01:03] moments he said but to you I you know
[2:01:10] that we should be baptized and refused
[2:01:13] to do it
[2:01:13] that'll be between you and God the same
[2:01:16] thing in the communion you know you
[2:01:19] should do it if you don't he said
[2:01:20] between you and God and when we take
[2:01:24] this communion it isn't just a thing
[2:01:26] saying I'm coming up here and I'm going
[2:01:28] to eat some bread and I believe I'm a
[2:01:30] Christian but if you notice the Bible
[2:01:32] said he that eateth and drinketh
[2:01:34] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:01:36] and blood of the Lord and that word on
[2:01:39] worldly means casually if you drink it
[2:01:43] and eat it on just casually like a
[2:01:45] tradition no he said you're guilty of
[2:01:51] the blood and the body of the Lord and
[2:01:56] instead of redeemed you will be
[2:01:58] condemned
[2:02:00] your attitude got me right your spirit
[2:02:03] can't be right your motive got to be
[2:02:05] right your objective got to be right for
[2:02:07] the glory of God see you've got to live
[2:02:13] a life before the people and before God
[2:02:17] and the people and that shows that you
[2:02:20] are sincere now just a moment longer and
[2:02:23] he's in the Old Testament when the
[2:02:26] sacrifice or a statue or ordinance he's
[2:02:29] the soy's water baptism and ordinance so
[2:02:32] his feet washing and ordinance so is the
[2:02:35] Lord's Supper an ordinance he said
[2:02:37] blessed blessed is he that does all his
[2:02:40] ordinances and keeps all of his statutes
[2:02:43] and all of his commandments that he
[2:02:45] might have a right to enter into the
[2:02:47] Tree of Life amen
[2:02:57] he said he died in our stead he did but
[2:03:02] we're how many of dog did since then
[2:03:06] yeah did physically but not spiritually
[2:03:09] and if Jesus didn't do what he did all
[2:03:14] the seed of God be dead cut off from God
[2:03:17] completely but thank God God from the
[2:03:21] beginning started with blood is able oh
[2:03:24] yeah blood sacrifice blood sacrifice
[2:03:28] blood sacrifice and their faith
[2:03:30] recognized greed they needed redemption
[2:03:32] through the true ritual blood and they
[2:03:35] knew that God was gone one day said the
[2:03:37] perfect sacrifice the lamb slain before
[2:03:41] the foundation of the world yeah if he
[2:03:47] wasn't slain before the foundation of
[2:03:48] the world and God had to wave it all off
[2:03:50] and start again but it was before the
[2:03:53] foundation of the world in the mind of
[2:03:55] God hallelujah but he said when I come
[2:04:07] to communion he said they kept on going
[2:04:12] under finally it become a tradition and
[2:04:16] it is and he said there's no sincerity
[2:04:20] there's no understanding and he said we
[2:04:23] don't want to take communion like that
[2:04:27] we want sincerity and understanding
[2:04:32] hallelujah
[2:04:33] we must come with this deep conscience
[2:04:36] of what we're doing not just because
[2:04:39] it's in it's an order he says you go to
[2:04:43] church many times you give out an old
[2:04:46] soda cracker something break it up like
[2:04:48] bread break it up
[2:04:50] people who smoke drink and everything
[2:04:52] else because they are member of the
[2:04:54] church and they're come and take the
[2:04:56] Lord's Supper he said that's filthiness
[2:04:58] before God he
[2:05:03] even the sacrifice your holy days your
[2:05:05] sacrifice become a stench in my nose
[2:05:09] saith the Lord yet he ordained them to
[2:05:12] make that sacrifice but the way they
[2:05:14] treated it it become a stench and he
[2:05:18] said that's the way we take the word to
[2:05:20] many Christians he said does that a man
[2:05:23] and it's a stench in the nostrils of God
[2:05:26] I pray that what we do today will not be
[2:05:28] a stench in the nostrils of God a
[2:05:32] reverence and respect your spirit and
[2:05:34] your attitude when you take of that
[2:05:37] bread and drink of that car so he said
[2:05:44] you don't take the Lord's Supper by a
[2:05:46] tradition you take it because it's the
[2:05:48] love of God in your heart my lord and
[2:05:51] mercy
[2:05:51] amen in keeping the commandments of God
[2:05:54] and he said that's what you take it for
[2:05:58] and he says you've got to be sincere and
[2:06:01] God wants the depths of your heart you
[2:06:04] remember the very God that brought you
[2:06:06] here on earth and that is the one that
[2:06:08] you are serving and if you're doing this
[2:06:10] because he said so because it's his
[2:06:13] order and then we want to come up with
[2:06:15] deepness of sincerity knowing that by
[2:06:17] God's grace we have been saved and we
[2:06:21] are and we love him and we feel his
[2:06:23] presence and we see it change our lives
[2:06:25] and we're different people
[2:06:27] we don't live like we used to and we
[2:06:30] don't think like we used to
[2:06:32] he said like in the Bible and the spot
[2:06:35] he said there was talking I said the two
[2:06:38] books becoming one the book of life the
[2:06:40] first book of life coming up when you
[2:06:42] were born he said that was your natural
[2:06:45] birth but there's then there's a
[2:06:47] spiritual birth a man
[2:06:56] he was talking about being borne by his
[2:07:04] natural parents he said what was it that
[2:07:09] was there was another William Branham
[2:07:11] and he said a little spot of eternal
[2:07:14] life down there the genes of God the
[2:07:17] word of God that was placed in there a
[2:07:19] man the natural William Branham was born
[2:07:22] in sin but there was a spiritual William
[2:07:25] Branham had the seed of God in his soul
[2:07:37] but he said once he said I looked up and
[2:07:40] I said I am NOT the son of Charles and
[2:07:45] Ella Branham he said there's something
[2:07:48] calling like my little eagle he said oh
[2:07:52] he said I'm not a chicken there's
[2:07:55] something yonder all great Jehovah
[2:07:57] whoever you are open up I want to come
[2:08:01] home amen there's something in me
[2:08:04] calling and then I was born again that
[2:08:08] little life was laying there the life of
[2:08:10] water was poured upon it and then it
[2:08:12] began to grow and he said brother been
[2:08:14] around snaps his fingers and they said
[2:08:17] that uh that old life was forgiven put
[2:08:20] in the sea of God's forgetfulness to
[2:08:22] never be remembered against me no more
[2:08:25] and now we just stand justified as
[2:08:28] though we had never seen that's
[2:08:30] tremendous
[2:08:31] that's a tremendous faith that you stand
[2:08:34] before God as if you've never seen
[2:08:38] amazing thank God thank God old brother

[2:09:01] sea of God's forgetfulness to be never

[2:09:06] stand justified as though we had never
[2:09:09] sinned in the presence of God amen he
[2:09:22] said in this communion just something I
[2:09:24] go up for an order and say well the rest
[2:09:27] of them take this I will do it's a
[2:09:29] revelation that I am part of him and I'm

[2:11:04] love you and I love him we're taking
[2:11:07] together as a symbol of our love to God
[2:11:09] our love and fellowship to one another
[2:11:11] as tremendous why is he ministering
[2:11:15] those things because he's seeing less
[2:11:16] and less of it it's getting less and
[2:11:20] less and less as I said he didn't the
[2:11:23] Saints were no longer feeling bad when
[2:11:25] they good service come to an end and
[2:11:26] their fellowship ended and that's why
[2:11:29] they cried he said oh I won't see you
[2:11:31] now into Sunday Wednesday and Wednesday
[2:11:33] they cry again I want to see you now to
[2:11:34] Sunday and so on yeah he felt he said
[2:11:41] that and now he said also he said he
[2:11:43] felt something else taking place he saw
[2:11:45] it what was it it was the older Saints
[2:11:48] that used to be on fire and filled with
[2:11:50] the power of God the anointing of God
[2:11:52] the love of God and now he said dirge
[2:11:55] right he said they're dry right dry sit
[2:12:00] now it's just okay god bless you go on
[2:12:03] that's it grace I'll finish he said what
[2:12:18] are you he said you're a Christian the
[2:12:22] Bible says let a man examine himself and
[2:12:24] so leader media let'em eat of that bread
[2:12:28] and drink of that Cup for either eight
[2:12:30] of them drink it unworthily eateth and
[2:12:31] drinketh damnation to himself not
[2:12:33] discerning the Lord's body
[2:12:36] and he said you're a Christian you live
[2:12:40] before everybody as a Christian and he
[2:12:43] would take that and don't live as a
[2:12:45] Christian you're not discerning the
[2:12:47] Lord's body you're putting a stumbling
[2:12:50] block in somebody else's way and I tell
[2:12:55] you if we get into this message here on
[2:12:56] doing God a serve without as well
[2:12:59] oh he's challenging the faith not of
[2:13:06] those out there he's challenging the
[2:13:08] faith of those in Panem tyreq oh he's
[2:13:12] challenging the faith of those who
[2:13:14] profess to believe his word and believe
[2:13:16] the message oh yeah because he sees that
[2:13:19] they are depending on this - depending
[2:13:22] on that they're leaning on theirs
[2:13:23] leaning on that and they judge
[2:13:25] themselves by this oh yeah I got this I
[2:13:26] got this I had this I have that no do
[2:13:31] you have do you have the will of God yes
[2:13:38] you can do God a service without his
[2:13:42] will oh yeah and there's many today that
[2:13:46] are doing God's service we're come to
[2:13:48] believers they do this do this oh yeah
[2:13:49] I'm doing this for the Lord
[2:13:50] no but do you have his will there's like
[2:13:55] I said hearing seen the way that God
[2:13:57] wants you to hear and see having the
[2:13:59] right motive and the right objective for
[2:14:01] what you do and so on probably God said
[2:14:07] you can do something but had the wrong
[2:14:08] motive and wrong objective amen
[2:14:12] but by the grace of God he said you can
[2:14:18] do this you can do this you can do this
[2:14:20] for God for God for God for God but he
[2:14:23] said is it the will of God there's many
[2:14:28] doing a lot of things but it's no
[2:14:30] there's not for the will of God
[2:14:32] grace brother grace
[2:14:39] when we take this it shows to the church
[2:14:42] that I believe every word of God I
[2:14:44] believe he is the bread of life they
[2:14:46] come down from God out of heaven and I
[2:14:48] believe every word that he says is the
[2:14:50] truth and he said I do not swear I do
[2:14:56] not curse I do not dare do those things
[2:15:00] because I love the Lord and the Lord
[2:15:01] knows it bears me record amen remember
[2:15:07] when Israel was the type of this they
[2:15:09] had journeyed 40 years in the wilderness
[2:15:11] and their clothes never wore ever wore
[2:15:13] out oh my and they come out with one
[2:15:18] people one among them without one people
[2:15:22] one among them and he said with two
[2:15:26] million as a type of this Oh as I said
[2:15:30] two million professing to believe this
[2:15:31] message around the world and he's there
[2:15:35] with two million as a type of this well
[2:15:38] what will the anti-type do the body of a
[2:15:41] sacrificial animal did that for them
[2:15:43] what would the body of Jesus Christ
[2:15:45] Immanuel do for us brother yeah if they
[2:15:51] threw a lamb in Egypt and put the water
[2:15:54] over the doors over the door all over
[2:15:56] the fence posts and so on they had to go
[2:15:58] this way and that way like a cross you
[2:16:03] know her brother if that if the blood of
[2:16:06] that lamb brought God on the scene and
[2:16:08] bless Israel and did this and did that
[2:16:11] all the power the anointing what ought
[2:16:13] the blood of Jesus do for us man look
[2:16:17] what a dud for them probably Gossard
[2:16:19] they came out and they drank the water
[2:16:21] out of the rock they came out did this
[2:16:24] they came out and did that yeah they
[2:16:28] went through the river on dry land yeah
[2:16:31] how those tried to do it and got drowned
[2:16:35] they weren't being the plan of God hey
[2:16:39] man so brother we got to make sure we're
[2:16:42] going to do it according to the will of
[2:16:44] God amen
[2:16:46] the communion according to the will of
[2:16:48] God in your life and in
[2:16:51] whatever else we do for the Lord make
[2:16:53] sure it's according to his will is not
[2:16:56] just a religious spirit on you it's the
[2:16:58] Holy Ghost in you controlling you oh my
[2:17:03] again it's amazing how the Prophet
[2:17:05] brings this out to his own church to his
[2:17:08] own people because why because he
[2:17:10] witnessed a lot of people that were
[2:17:13] doing things but it wasn't according to
[2:17:15] the will of God they were doing doing
[2:17:21] God a service but they never had the
[2:17:23] will of God so you want to do something
[2:17:26] for God make sure it's the will of God
[2:17:28] in your life well I'm gonna do this I'm
[2:17:30] gonna do that
[2:17:31] I'll tell there's not many believers
[2:17:32] today they're doing the will of God no
[2:17:34] they you know I find a lot of a lot of
[2:17:38] excuses I can't do this and I can't do
[2:17:40] that and I can't do that because because
[2:17:42] because well you change it for this one
[2:17:45] you're changing for that one why not
[2:17:47] change it for the Lord oh yeah oh people
[2:17:51] make plans for this make plans for that
[2:17:53] plan for that yeah yeah I'm gonna do
[2:17:55] this I'm gonna do this but you know
[2:17:56] comfort of doing something for the Lord
[2:17:57] oh I can't do this I can't do this yeah
[2:18:03] God give us the Holy Ghost brother to be
[2:18:07] spiritually minded they were gonna make
[2:18:10] sacrifices for him as he made for us by

[2:32:25] said that was as close as anyone that
[2:32:27] looked like what he saw in in his garden
[2:32:32] when he saw the division of Jesus
[2:32:34] standing there and looking at him he
[2:32:37] said this was as close as he could get
[2:32:38] to anybody and of course they say also
[2:32:41] that our brother Tom Brown that he also
[2:32:45] looked like the Jesus that Jesus saw at
[2:32:48] the girth a man so thank God that he
[2:32:52] revealed himself in this day in this
[2:32:53] hour that he's real he's not a he's not
[2:32:57] a fairy tale and not just a 2000 year
[2:32:59] old story it's the reality of Christ
[2:33:02] down through the ages and in this last
[2:33:04] stage he revealed himself to his bride

[2:33:12] barber leaders true
[2:33:13] [Music]
[2:34:04] a heavenly father Lord with the deepness
[2:34:11] of sincerity is the Prophet taught us
[2:34:13] Lord we approach father as part of the
[2:34:15] service
[2:34:16] - thank you Lord for your grace to us
[2:34:18] horn - thank you Father for loving us
[2:34:20] when we were unlovable father Lord to
[2:34:23] realize father that that before the
[2:34:25] world even began Lord you knew we'd be
[2:34:27] here father Lord when our heads and
[2:34:30] hearts bound Lord to the earth father
[2:34:31] from which we were taken Lord that their
[2:34:34] father well you knew father that you had
[2:34:37] to manifest Lord your attribute is to
[2:34:40] save your father
[2:34:40] even back then knowing Lord that we
[2:34:42] would fall but father knowing Lord that
[2:34:44] that this was all part of a great plan
[2:34:47] Lord to bring us back father into Lord
[2:34:50] your presence father to be with you
[2:34:52] forever so Lord we thank you Lord that
[2:34:55] you've given us father representation
[2:34:57] before the throne and Lord you you
[2:34:59] showed us father Lord through your word
[2:35:01] father and by calling us Lord like you
[2:35:03] did father that we do have a place Lord
[2:35:06] in eternity so we thank you for that
[2:35:08] Lord and pray father that should help us
[2:35:10] to live worthy father and to sacrifice
[2:35:13] Lord day that you made for us father for
[2:35:16] truly Lord no man can even really
[2:35:18] understand or identify with the pain
[2:35:20] Lord that you went through father the
[2:35:22] suffering that you undertook Lord the
[2:35:24] burden that you bore father that man
[2:35:26] Lord would have a way back into eternity
[2:35:29] so Lord father at humbles us Lord to
[2:35:31] realize that the God of heaven would be
[2:35:33] mindful enough of us father to come down
[2:35:36] and make that sacrifice
[2:35:37] so Lord we father pray Lord that you'd
[2:35:39] forgive us of our sins our mistakes our
[2:35:41] weaknesses Lord for where you may have
[2:35:44] offended or hurt each other Lord God
[2:35:46] forgive us Lord and help us father to
[2:35:48] always remain under the blood of Jesus
[2:35:50] Christ for that we said that we might
[2:35:52] have that love one for another father as
[2:35:55] Lord when that pressure comes down
[2:35:56] father when completely comes down Lord
[2:35:59] that father we're going to cry for each
[2:36:01] other Lord we're going to yearn for each
[2:36:03] other father I wanted to gain that
[2:36:05] comfort Lord that only we can give each
[2:36:07] other more because of your grace in our
[2:36:09] lives so Lord be with us we pray father
[2:36:11] throughout this service Lord we thank
[2:36:13] you for what you do for us all
[2:36:15] I never want to take for granted all the
[2:36:17] blessings Lord that you bestow upon us
[2:36:19] father never lords I'll help us we pray
[2:36:22] father - just really appreciate Lord all
[2:36:25] that's been done for us Lord so father
[2:36:28] we pray that you would bless these
[2:36:29] emblems Lord may they be blessed and
[2:36:31] sanctified father Lord would father by
[2:36:34] the power of the Holy Spirit Lord and
[2:36:36] that we realize father that if we have a
[2:36:38] need today if there's healing needed or
[2:36:40] whatever it might be there's healing in
[2:36:42] the cup Lord and probably pray Lord that
[2:36:44] you would help us to have that faith
[2:36:46] that as we take it it's not in vain but
[2:36:48] father we draw closer to you closer to
[2:36:51] each other father so be with us we pray

[3:14:02] attend you with us through this day and
[3:14:04] through another week maybe we never lose
[3:14:07] the revelation of Calvary a man we need
[3:14:14] to keep be mindful constantly praise the
[3:14:18] Lord that I not that I will be redeemed
[3:14:20] I am redeemed by the grace of God and he
[3:14:26] testimony of grace is Calvary he laid
[3:14:31] down his life but picked it up again in
[3:14:36] the book of John it's written when
[3:14:40] therefore he was risen from the dead his
[3:14:44] disciples remembered that he had said
[3:14:46] unto them concerning the temple and they
[3:14:54] believed the scripture and the word
[3:14:57] which Jesus had said now when he was in
[3:15:01] Jerusalem at the Passover in the feast
[3:15:04] day many believed in his name and when
[3:15:08] they saw the miracles which he did but
[3:15:13] Jesus did not commit himself unto them
[3:15:19] because he knew all men and he knows you
[3:15:24] and he knows me he will commit himself
[3:15:29] unto those that have committed to him
[3:15:31] they may but he knows whether or not we
[3:15:35] have committed ourselves in our souls to
[3:15:37] him he's not in our physical beings and
[3:15:41] religious lives no but it's in the new
[3:15:46] creatures in Christ
[3:15:47] a man we have committed all things unto
[3:15:51] Him not my will father
[3:15:55] thine be done not my will Lord Jesus
[3:15:57] your will that's what we're living for
[3:16:00] the will of God the will of Christ but
[3:16:03] to those that emit after his
[3:16:06] resurrection 2000 years ago it says they
[3:16:09] believed in
[3:16:10] his name when they saw the miracles
[3:16:13] which he did but the faith wasn't based
[3:16:18] on the Word of God it was based on the
[3:16:20] works but as believers our faith is
[3:16:24] based on the word we believe the word
[3:16:26] we're not putting the emphasis on the
[3:16:29] signs and wonders but we're putting the
[3:16:31] emphasis on him
[3:16:32] the word it is if word made flesh if
[3:16:37] what God promised God was doing in
[3:16:39] Christ through Christ
[3:16:40] redeeming us amen remember again that
[3:16:43] the angel told would have items' to stop
[3:16:47] using those signs
[3:16:48] he said you're causing the people to
[3:16:51] lean on a signpost he was ordained he
[3:16:55] was predestinated to use the sign but
[3:16:57] then to get them to believe the word
[3:16:59] yeah but they kept believing believing
[3:17:02] the sign and that's why they they
[3:17:04] constantly pulled on the signs that's
[3:17:07] what they wanted to finally he wouldn't
[3:17:11] do it even in the prayer lines if I told
[3:17:16] you this he said would you believe see
[3:17:19] God is testing our faith God wants us to
[3:17:22] believe his word they man it's not just
[3:17:26] signs and wonders and that man got
[3:17:27] assigned that man God's got wonders and
[3:17:29] so on he'll do this and you'll do that
[3:17:31] there they were more into brother
[3:17:33] Branham than into Jesus that's why he
[3:17:36] did ask the Lord that question he's a
[3:17:39] lord and he's in the hotel he said Lord
[3:17:42] they want to come to the hotel he said
[3:17:45] his is to see me or see you they want to
[3:17:48] come to see with him realm they want to
[3:17:51] talk to him breath they wanted me to run
[3:17:53] to pray for them they want to be healed
[3:17:55] but again he's like he brought out him
[3:17:58] in the message either hearing
[3:18:04] I heard but now I see but I think was
[3:18:06] the other message that we brought out
[3:18:08] too and went through me and concerning
[3:18:15] don't have it there see inside it was
[3:18:18] another message concerning the motives
[3:18:20] and objectives you know but their motive
[3:18:23] wasn't right their objective wasn't
[3:18:24] right and he said even in that book you
[3:18:26] know he said he said why do you want to
[3:18:29] be heel for what do you want God to do
[3:18:33] this for he said just because you're
[3:18:35] sick and you want to meet well oh no no
[3:18:38] that's not your right motive not your
[3:18:41] right objective the right moral
[3:18:42] objectives is for the glory of God if
[3:18:46] you want to give the glory to Jesus amen
[3:18:49] by the grace of God so no matter what we
[3:18:51] want to do whether we want it for the
[3:18:54] glory of God amen you want God to do
[3:18:57] this for you oh yes oh I'll be better no
[3:19:00] get you have your vote of change your
[3:19:03] motives change your objective Lord I'll
[3:19:04] give you the glory amen
[3:19:06] I'll testify and give you the glory
[3:19:08] thank you thank you thank you
[3:19:10] amen so we'll give give the glory to
[3:19:13] Jesus you might you have we all got
[3:19:15] needs
[3:19:16] we've all got needs so when the lord
[3:19:19] meets that need give him the glory amen
[3:19:22] praise the Lord no matter what it is
[3:19:24] give him the glory amen
[3:19:27] we'll give the glory to Jesus and tell
[3:19:30] of his wonderful law but and brother if
[3:19:34] he knows your motive is right your
[3:19:35] objection was right your spear is right
[3:19:38] then eat on the heel healed acknowledge
[3:19:40] you yeah you'll commit you'll commit
[3:19:43] himself to you if you commit himself
[3:19:45] yourself to him you got to commit
[3:19:47] yourself to him he'll commit he'll
[3:19:49] commit himself to you yeah oh yeah
[3:19:52] because he can trust you
[3:19:53] he knows you're gonna be there too to be
[3:19:56] his witness his testimony amen so Jesus
[3:19:59] did not commit himself unto those that
[3:20:01] believe because they saw the miracles
[3:20:03] because he knew all men and needed not
[3:20:06] that any should justify all men for he
[3:20:09] knew what was in man you knew it then he
[3:20:12] knows it now he knows what's in you now
[3:20:15] amen so we pray the grace of God that he
[3:20:19] what he sees in us is acceptable in his
[3:20:21] presence what he's recognized in you and
[3:20:24] me a man
[3:20:26] it's again it's a reflection of His
[3:20:30] grace and His mercy and his love and his
[3:20:32] Redemption amen
[3:20:34] because why because we have a right
[3:20:36] attitude and a right spirit and it's
[3:20:38] free it's revealed in us it's made flesh
[3:20:40] in us amen
[3:20:42] he never said he recognizes that that
[3:20:44] we're living to serve Jesus amen give
[3:20:48] him the glory god bless you this thing
[3:20:53] what can wash away my sin nothing but
[3:20:56] the blood of Jesus what can make me
