[37:08] announcements so I I announced different

[37:15] Andrew Glover so our camp dates are

[38:11] to see the changes and and the
[38:13] improvements that are made
[38:15] hey man let's turn to the scripture
[38:16] Psalm chapter 16. Psalm chapter 16 verse
[38:19] 7 says I will bless the Lord who hath
[38:22] given me counsel my Reigns also instruct
[38:26] me in the ninth season notice there it
[38:29] says my Reigns instruct me
[38:31] Reigns are for a horse
[38:34] it says my Reigns instruct me means
[38:35] somebody else directs me in the night
[38:37] season when I can't see it there's one
[38:40] that gives me direction there was one
[38:41] that that shows me the path there's one
[38:43] that makes it clear which way I should
[38:45] go even when I don't know which way to
[38:46] go there's something that's instructing
[38:48] me when what I have fails me it says I
[38:51] have set the lord always before me
[38:53] because he is at my right hand I shall
[38:57] not be moved therefore my heart is glad
[38:59] and my glory rejoices my flesh flesh
[39:03] also shall Rest In Hope amen God bless
[39:06] you can have your seats may God bless
[39:08] the reading of his word and I'm taking a
[39:10] bit of a detour today and we're still on
[39:12] that thought of her day
[39:13] and brother Matt for the vice I've got a
[39:15] fair bit of uh rebound coming up here if
[39:18] we can tune that out a bit but um taking
[39:20] a bit of a detour here and I've been
[39:22] dwelling on this thought for quite some
[39:24] time and I've talked to my wife about
[39:25] and I've talked to a few different ones
[39:27] about this is coming this is coming and
[39:28] and just sharing some of the things that
[39:30] the Lord's put on my heart but we're
[39:32] still on that that thought of redemption
[39:34] but we're gonna just stop for a point
[39:35] here and I want to preach on this this
[39:37] title I shall not be moved and this this
[39:41] sock came to me as we are preaching on
[39:42] the adoption of the children of God and
[39:44] we looked at Jesus life on Earth and and
[39:47] we we saw his adoption on Mount
[39:49] Transfiguration we know that there was a
[39:51] shift in his ministry after that thank
[39:53] you brothers that there's a shift in his
[39:55] ministry after that and I just want to
[39:57] touch on this as a a starting point to
[39:59] set a foundation for the service this
[40:01] morning and in Luke chapter 9 it says
[40:03] and it came to pass about an eight days
[40:05] after these Saints he took Peter and
[40:07] John and James and went up into a
[40:09] mountain to pray and as he prayed the
[40:11] fashion of his countenance was altered
[40:13] and and his raiment was white and
[40:15] glistening and behold there talked with
[40:18] him two men which were Moses and Elias
[40:20] who appeared in glory and spake of his
[40:23] decease which he should accomplish at
[40:25] Jerusalem and I noticed there it says
[40:27] that he should accomplish I jumped over
[40:29] to the Amplified there and it says they
[40:31] were speaking of his exit from Life
[40:33] which he was about to bring to
[40:36] realization at Jerusalem and I want to
[40:39] dwell on that thought for a bit because
[40:40] if you see the meaning there it's not
[40:42] just something that's going to occur and
[40:44] I think that's something we have to
[40:45] realize is when we're stepping into the
[40:47] word it's not just something that's
[40:49] going to occur because the word said it
[40:51] but there's a portion for us to play and
[40:54] as Moses and Elijah are talking with
[40:56] Jesus what happens is they're saying
[40:58] this is what you have to do
[41:01] it's not just because the word is
[41:03] written but you've got to do it you've
[41:05] got to make a choice you've got to step
[41:07] into this and there's a path you've got
[41:09] to take and you're going to bring to
[41:11] pass what's going to happen as it was
[41:13] written in the word so Jesus wasn't just
[41:16] standing around and events were
[41:17] happening but he had to step into it he
[41:20] had this he had to turn his face towards
[41:23] Jerusalem he had to now start to put
[41:25] into action the word that was given him
[41:27] he had to put into action the purpose
[41:30] that was prepared for him to go into
[41:32] what was expected by him and we see that
[41:34] virtually immediately after this he does
[41:37] something very interesting and in Luke
[41:39] this is just a few verses later it says
[41:41] and it came to pass when the time was
[41:43] come that he should be received up
[41:45] pointing to his Ascension it says he
[41:48] steadfastly set his face to go to
[41:51] Jerusalem in other words he turned from
[41:53] everything that he had been doing and he
[41:55] set his face and he said his feet and he
[41:57] was going now to Jerusalem to fulfill
[42:00] the final portion of his Ministry now in
[42:03] most of the gospels they don't talk a
[42:05] whole lot about what he did after this
[42:06] because it almost goes immediately to
[42:08] the Passover and the preparation for it
[42:10] and these different things but in the
[42:12] Book of Luke we have chapter after
[42:13] chapter of what he did there because
[42:15] remember the voice said hear ye him
[42:18] that meant there was something that he
[42:20] had to say it meant that there was a
[42:21] Ministry that had to occur after his
[42:23] male Transfiguration experience after
[42:25] his adoption and his journey would take
[42:28] him we see in Luke through many many
[42:29] villages on his way to Jerusalem he's
[42:33] here and he's got to go here to
[42:34] Jerusalem but in between there's a bunch
[42:36] of dots that have to be touched and we
[42:38] see that what happens here is he sends
[42:40] out Messengers ahead of him to let the
[42:43] villagers know I'm coming
[42:45] because as he's going on the path to
[42:47] Jerusalem he's going to stop and he's
[42:49] going to touch a life here and he's
[42:51] going to touch a life there and he's
[42:52] going to preach here and he's going to
[42:53] preach there and many of those Villages
[42:56] received him but we see that what
[42:58] happens he comes to a village in Samaria
[43:00] and they look at him and because he is
[43:03] acting as if he's going on they say we
[43:06] don't want you to come in in the first
[43:08] place
[43:09] he sent Messengers he sent a way that
[43:12] was prepared and he's letting them know
[43:14] he's coming but because of their
[43:17] complexes because they were in Samaria
[43:19] and this was a place of mixed people
[43:21] they had a complex perhaps they they had
[43:25] been turned down by the prophets they
[43:27] have been ignored by the ministry and so
[43:29] he comes along and because his focus is
[43:31] to move on they say well you don't stop
[43:34] here then you're just like the rest of
[43:36] them perhaps you're just going to the
[43:38] Jews you don't have any time for us in
[43:40] Samaria but he had sent Messengers
[43:42] saying I'm going to stop on my way
[43:43] through it reminds me when brother Aaron
[43:45] Oglesby was here and I don't know if he
[43:47] said it over the pulpit or if he was
[43:49] talking in private but he talks about
[43:51] that woman who had the blood issue if
[43:52] you remember and what happened was Jesus
[43:55] was on his way to Jairus daughter
[43:58] Jesus face was set towards jairus's
[44:00] daughter but on the way that woman's
[44:03] Faith stopped him in his tracks and she
[44:06] was healed why because on the bay on his
[44:09] his path to where he was going he had
[44:12] enough love and compassion to respond to
[44:14] somebody that was on the way
[44:16] what I'm saying is sometimes we get so
[44:18] caught up in our mission for today that
[44:21] we don't take time to stop and help
[44:22] somebody that's right along the path
[44:24] amen sometimes we're so focused on what
[44:26] we're doing and what we're supposed to
[44:28] be doing and we don't stop and say is
[44:30] there someone I can help along the way
[44:32] but Jesus even though his face was set
[44:35] steadfastly towards Jerusalem to go to
[44:37] his death to go to the whipping post to
[44:39] go to his trial and all these things yet
[44:42] along the way he stopped to help the
[44:44] people that were there but their complex
[44:46] stopped them from getting a blessing
[44:49] that day because he stopped he was
[44:50] prepared to preach he was prepared to
[44:52] talk he was prepared to to share his
[44:55] ministry with them
[44:56] we're talking on the side of I shall not
[44:59] be moved and and my point here is that
[45:01] though you are focused on what you're
[45:03] supposed to be doing don't forget our
[45:05] biggest our biggest purpose is to spread
[45:07] the gospel amen we're here to preach the
[45:09] gospel we're here to live a gospel and
[45:11] let's not be so caught up in our in our
[45:13] religion if I could put it that way
[45:15] right that we forget that we are here to
[45:18] share a gospel with people along the way
[45:20] and no matter how busy we are no matter
[45:22] how tired we are no matter that we're
[45:24] looking to make a resurrection and a
[45:26] Rapture let's make sure we stop along
[45:28] the way to help the people that are in
[45:30] need along our life's path amen God puts
[45:33] people that have needs in our path so
[45:35] that we can be the ones that can help to
[45:37] meet it that's why he puts people there
[45:39] so that we can do something for them
[45:40] that nobody can can do for them amen
[45:43] but there's a as Jesus is heading to his
[45:46] his crowning achievement which is his
[45:49] his death burial and Resurrection I want
[45:51] to to poke or to point out the
[45:53] steadfastness the immovability of him in
[45:56] these last few days because it's
[45:57] something I want to unpack for us a bit
[46:00] this today and and maybe even over the
[46:02] next few Services if the Lord would will
[46:03] but we go to the Garden of the
[46:05] Gethsemane and Jesus has spent the
[46:07] evening in prayer and he's gone and he
[46:09] said Lord if this if it's possible let
[46:12] this cup pass for me if it let it pass
[46:14] let it pass I really don't want to do
[46:15] this and then at the end he says but
[46:17] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[46:20] done and he surrenders himself to it and
[46:23] once he surrenders he goes back and he's
[46:25] with the disciples and then remember
[46:26] that Judas comes up with the the the
[46:29] soldiers from the priesthood and and the
[46:31] the different ones and he comes up and
[46:33] he betrays Jesus with a kiss and then it
[46:35] wakes everybody up and we see a a scene
[46:38] here because Peter gets into a bit of a
[46:40] kerfuffle and in Matthew 26 it says and
[46:43] behold one of them which were with Jesus
[46:45] that's Peter stretched out his hand and
[46:47] Drew his sword and struck a servant of
[46:49] the high priest and smote off his ear he
[46:51] cut off his ear
[46:53] he wasn't aiming for his ear I can tell
[46:55] you that
[46:56] and then said Jesus unto him put up
[46:58] again thy sword into his place for all
[47:01] that take the sword Shall Perish with
[47:03] the sword
[47:04] now listen to Jesus his thought process
[47:07] his mind here he says thinketh thou that
[47:09] I cannot now pray to my father and he
[47:12] shall presently give me more than 12
[47:14] Legions of angels He says but then how
[47:17] shall the scriptures be fulfilled that
[47:20] thus it must be so Peter Jesus tells
[47:23] Peter he says Peter you don't understand
[47:25] what's going on in here they're not
[47:27] taking me I'm giving me he says don't
[47:31] you realize that if I pray for it 12
[47:34] Legions of angels could come here they
[47:36] could wipe them all out and I could walk
[47:37] free I am not being bound because they
[47:40] just choose it I'm being bound because I
[47:42] choose it I'm giving myself to them I'm
[47:45] letting it be and he says Peter if
[47:47] you're successful in your fight then the
[47:50] word won't be accomplished so put your
[47:51] sword away so that my portion of the
[47:54] word can be fulfilled don't interfere
[47:56] with my walk
[47:57] that's what he's saying Peter don't
[47:59] interfere with my walk what's got to be
[48:01] has got to be so don't get all full of
[48:03] zeal here to take it away God has put
[48:06] this God has put me in this position to
[48:08] fulfill his word so don't stop my trial
[48:10] don't stop my arrest don't stop this
[48:13] hard thing that I'm about to go to why
[48:15] because he had surrendered his will
[48:18] he didn't need Peter's help
[48:21] he didn't need Peter's help
[48:23] he was on his own path and God had
[48:26] already told him what he was going to do
[48:27] Moses and Elisha our Elijah had already
[48:30] told him what was going to happen and so
[48:32] he said I'm putting myself into what God
[48:35] has ordained for me in this thing I'm
[48:37] stepping into the word not only that he
[48:39] says I'm pressing into it that's what
[48:41] he's doing he's pressing into it he's
[48:43] putting his own body on the line he's
[48:44] putting his life on the line because
[48:46] that was his role for that time in the
[48:48] Kingdom
[48:49] then they take him into the Hall of
[48:51] judgment and they accuse him of many
[48:52] false things we know and in Matthew 26
[48:54] just to lay a foundation that says now
[48:57] the chief priests and elders and all the
[48:59] councils sought false Witnesses against
[49:01] Jesus to put him to death but found none
[49:06] now notice this it says yea though many
[49:08] false Witnesses came yet found a nun in
[49:11] other words they couldn't get two false
[49:13] witnesses to agree with each other you
[49:15] talk about a kangaroo court you talk
[49:17] about a pretended
[49:20] to death they couldn't even find two
[49:22] people to lie the same way that's how
[49:25] bad it was church if it was us we'd be
[49:27] sitting there in that Hall and as soon
[49:29] as we realized what was going on and
[49:30] we'd say now he just contradicted him
[49:32] and she's not matching up with what he
[49:34] said and we'd have Twisted them up in
[49:36] their words and we just said and now
[49:37] you've got to let us go free we'd have
[49:39] fought back we'd have used their their
[49:40] own testimony against them to prove what
[49:42] was in their hearts
[49:44] but Jesus didn't do that it said at the
[49:46] last came two false Witnesses and said
[49:49] this fellow said I'm able to destroy the
[49:51] temple of God and to build it in three
[49:53] days and the high priest arose and said
[49:55] unto him answers thou nothing what is it
[49:58] which these witness against thee it says
[50:01] but Jesus held his peace
[50:05] nothing that they said was was factually
[50:07] true
[50:09] nothing that they said was
[50:11] representative of what he said it was
[50:13] twisted at best or else it was
[50:15] completely false other than that but
[50:17] they said he stood there and they
[50:18] falsely accused him and they slandered
[50:20] him and they tried to tear his
[50:21] reputation down and do all these things
[50:23] and yet Jesus answered nothing amen why
[50:27] because he was steadfast in his purpose
[50:30] he was steadfast in his position he
[50:32] would steadfast in what the word said
[50:34] about him that he didn't need to answer
[50:36] anything because he knew this had to
[50:39] happen for his portion of the word to be
[50:40] fulfilled what was he saying I won't be
[50:43] moved by what you do
[50:45] I won't be moved by what you say I won't
[50:48] be moved by how you lie how you twist
[50:51] things against me he wasn't worried
[50:52] about what they had to say because it
[50:54] was all apart and parcel of his journey
[50:57] if we read in Isaiah 53 it says he was
[51:00] oppressed and he was afflicted yet he
[51:03] opened not his mouth he is brought as a
[51:06] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[51:08] before her shearers is dumb so he
[51:11] openeth not his mouth he was taken from
[51:14] prison and from judgment and who shall
[51:16] declare his generation for he was cut
[51:18] off out of the land of the living and
[51:20] for the transgression of my people was
[51:22] he stricken and he made his grave with
[51:25] the wicked and with the rich in his
[51:27] death because he had done no violence
[51:29] neither was any deceit in his mouth
[51:34] church sometimes we speak the word we
[51:37] share the word we stand on the word and
[51:39] people are going to say things about us
[51:41] people are going to Harbor feelings
[51:43] towards us people are going to twist our
[51:45] motives and objectives they're going to
[51:46] assign things to us that have nothing to
[51:48] do with what's in our heart and we've
[51:50] got to be able to stand there and say I
[51:52] shall not be moved
[51:54] I don't care what people say I don't
[51:56] care what people think I don't care what
[51:58] people put on social media I don't care
[52:00] how they cut me I don't care how they
[52:01] cut me off I don't care if they
[52:03] disfellowship I'm going to stay with
[52:04] what the word says
[52:06] and that's what Christ was doing but not
[52:08] only what the word says but what the
[52:09] word said about him
[52:11] because that's why he was silent was
[52:13] because the word said you've got to stay
[52:15] silent amen amen we've got to be
[52:17] standing firmly on our word
[52:19] you've got to have a word for where
[52:21] you're at in each situation with each
[52:23] relationship you have with each person
[52:24] you've got to be able to stay this is
[52:26] where I'm standing right now and it's on
[52:28] his word and it's written about me and
[52:30] for me for the situation amen we've got
[52:32] to be able to stand firmly because
[52:34] everything in this world is against us
[52:37] now you might think well there's there's
[52:39] people that are that are on the right
[52:40] side and they're on the conservative
[52:41] side no no no church they're not with us
[52:44] they're only with us in a little bit and
[52:46] their motive is completely different
[52:47] than our motive and their morality is
[52:49] completely different than ours and their
[52:51] purpose for even believing and saying
[52:52] the things that they do is completely
[52:54] different than ours
[52:55] we'll maybe touch on that a little bit
[52:57] later
[52:58] but why did Jesus not speak
[53:01] we say well he was he was fulfilling the
[53:02] word
[53:03] and he was doing what he had been told
[53:05] to him but I want you to understand that
[53:07] there's an overarching reason for all of
[53:08] this and that is love
[53:10] he stayed silent out of love
[53:13] because this whole thing this whole
[53:15] thing of redemption this whole process
[53:18] of redemption is a love process and so
[53:20] he stood there and he he held his mouth
[53:23] quiet he had he stayed quiet now listen
[53:26] he had a gift of discernment he had an
[53:27] open Vision Ministry he knew the
[53:29] thoughts of them he could have gone
[53:31] there and he could have torn them all to
[53:32] shambles he could have showed exactly
[53:34] what was going on he could have said now
[53:35] you met with this one in this room and
[53:37] you talked about this one and you
[53:39] witnessed you came from this place and
[53:40] they paid you this much money to do this
[53:42] and that and the other thing and he
[53:43] could have he could have revealed the
[53:44] whole kangaroo court that was going on
[53:46] there but yet love kept his mouth shut
[53:48] he could have completely tied them in
[53:50] knots he could have completely exposed
[53:52] them but love kept his mouth shut
[53:55] that's what kept Him in a place where he
[53:57] would take a beating where he would take
[53:59] a whipping where he would stand still
[54:01] while they would press those Thorns down
[54:03] into his head while they would slap him
[54:05] while they would punch him in the face
[54:06] it was love that kept his mouth quiet it
[54:09] was love that kept him standing it was
[54:10] love that kept him from calling on those
[54:12] 12 Legions of angels
[54:15] even before the governor
[54:17] a man that had nothing to do with this a
[54:19] man that wasn't persecuting him he
[54:21] stayed quiet and we read about in
[54:23] Matthew 27 it says and Jesus stood
[54:25] before the governor and the governor
[54:26] asked him saying art thou the king of
[54:28] the Jews and Jesus said unto him thou
[54:30] sayest and when he was accused of the
[54:33] chief priests and Elders he answered
[54:34] nothing then said pilate unto him here's
[54:38] thou not how many things they have
[54:39] witnessed against thee it says and he
[54:42] never answered him and he answered to
[54:44] him never a word in so much that the
[54:47] governor Marvel greatly love kept his
[54:50] mouth shut church love kept him bound to
[54:52] that place love kept him from offering a
[54:55] defense
[54:56] love kept him headed towards the
[54:58] whipping post where he paid for our
[54:59] healing love kept him standing in that
[55:01] place while they said everything about
[55:04] him that wasn't true love kept him there
[55:07] even it's amazing to me that in that
[55:09] moment the clarity of Jesus mind because
[55:12] remember pilate would say don't you know
[55:14] that that I can kill you and he says you
[55:16] don't have any power except God gave it
[55:18] to you
[55:19] I'm not scared of you I'm not scared of
[55:22] your response so when we're standing in
[55:24] the word when somebody tries to do
[55:26] something to us then what are we worried
[55:28] about they have no power of us over US
[55:30] unless God would give it to them
[55:32] they have no influence over US unless
[55:34] God will give it to them and so we can
[55:36] stand there in assurance that we're in
[55:37] what his perfect will and his love is
[55:40] what's going to keep us standing there
[55:42] and taking whatever it is that comes our
[55:44] way church he went there and they didn't
[55:45] have to hold his his arms down with
[55:47] their knees on it when they pounded them
[55:49] into the cross why love
[55:51] love nailed those hands to the Cross he
[55:55] laid them willingly there and he didn't
[55:57] move them as they drove those Nails into
[55:58] the cross that was his overarching
[56:00] reason for other this why am I saying
[56:03] this church because as he loved we must
[56:04] love
[56:05] and we stand on the word and we speak
[56:07] the word but our reasons for doing it
[56:09] always have to be in love
[56:13] I shall not be moved from his love
[56:16] I shall not be removed and step into my
[56:19] own flesh and step into my own reason
[56:21] these different things when we're
[56:22] standing on the word of God we're
[56:24] standing on it out of love and when we
[56:26] say what we say and do what we do love
[56:28] has to be the reason that we're doing it
[56:31] and I'm going to get into this a little
[56:32] bit because we can get these things
[56:34] twisted around amen our our position our
[56:37] immovability our unwillingness to move
[56:40] from the word of God is on the basis of
[56:42] love our greatest attribute therefore is
[56:44] that we love someone and we do it by
[56:47] staying with the word
[56:48] the greatest love you can show somebody
[56:50] is to stay with the word of God Amen we
[56:53] hold fast in love always but we get it
[56:56] twisted and I want you to catch us today
[56:58] because we can get into this place where
[56:59] we say well the word says such and such
[57:01] and and that's what I'm going to do but
[57:03] what happens when we do that is we get
[57:05] our backs up
[57:07] and we get into a defensive mode because
[57:09] we know that often a battle is coming
[57:11] and we know that maybe we're going to be
[57:13] rejected and we know that somebody's
[57:15] going to disagree with us or somebody's
[57:17] not going to like us after we stand on
[57:19] the word and so we go into it with our
[57:21] Shields up and our backs stiff and our
[57:24] weapon out and that's not the way Jesus
[57:26] did it
[57:27] he didn't go in there all backed up and
[57:29] ready for a fight but he went in willing
[57:31] to absorb the abuse that came with
[57:34] standing on the word in love amen when
[57:37] our motive is love we can stand on the
[57:39] word and we're doing it for the sake of
[57:41] the person in front of us
[57:43] it's for their reason it's for their
[57:46] good that we're doing these things we
[57:47] don't do it for ourselves we stand on
[57:49] the word because we believe it but we
[57:51] stand on the word for the sake of the
[57:52] person that's in front of us that's
[57:54] hearing us that's watching us live
[57:56] whatever it might be amen he sent a word
[57:58] to us and it's not just a word on pages
[58:01] and it's not just a word in print but
[58:03] it's a Living Word and we live that word
[58:06] out of love in hopes that somebody else
[58:08] will catch the love of God that's coming
[58:10] out of our Lives amen our attitude so
[58:12] often and this is our downfalling is
[58:14] determined by our our feelings and our
[58:17] anticipation of what's about to happen
[58:21] and so we go into this and we stand on
[58:24] the word of God and we hold the fast or
[58:26] we hold fast of what we've been taught
[58:28] and when we refuse to to compromise we
[58:31] get into that defensive mode and we know
[58:33] that battle's coming in we know we're
[58:35] going to pay a price for following the
[58:37] leadership of the Holy Spirit as it
[58:39] quickens his word to us and what we get
[58:42] those Shields up
[58:43] and we're preparing for the battle
[58:45] rather than being willing to absorb the
[58:48] damage
[58:49] there's a price that we pay for living
[58:51] this word church
[58:53] what is it we can be standing on the
[58:55] word of God and have a completely wrong
[58:57] attitude in anticipation of being
[59:00] rejected
[59:02] how many of us have talked to somebody
[59:04] have witnessed and gone into it and said
[59:06] no I'm pretty sure they're going to
[59:08] accept this
[59:09] it's not a common thing is it and so
[59:12] after rejection after rejection after
[59:14] rejection what happens is we tend to get
[59:16] into this mode where we're just well
[59:18] we're almost like here's what the word
[59:20] says and we got a shield here and a
[59:22] sword there and our backs are up and the
[59:24] people can see that we're not really
[59:26] presenting this in love
[59:28] because we're too stressed out we're too
[59:30] nervous about what's going to happen
[59:33] and that's not the way the gospel is
[59:35] going to be affected amen
[59:37] Jesus is standing in the hall of
[59:38] judgment and given the opportunity to
[59:40] defend himself he stays silent and love
[59:43] keeps him silent to absorb the abuse of
[59:45] everyone that's coming against him why
[59:47] he knew who he was
[59:50] he knew who he was church there are
[59:52] there's a couple men that I've met in my
[59:54] life and and I don't mind naming them
[59:56] brother philma rugby some of you would
[59:57] know him from Calvary wonderful colored
[59:59] brother and he was the calmest coolest
[1:00:02] most collected Christian I believe I've
[1:00:05] ever met
[1:00:06] and you could be yelling at him and not
[1:00:08] that I did but he dealt with people in
[1:00:10] such a way that they could be so worked
[1:00:12] up and so angry and so stressed and he'd
[1:00:16] just sit there and he'd stand there and
[1:00:18] he could talk them through it and he
[1:00:20] never moved why because he was so
[1:00:22] convinced of where he was standing was
[1:00:24] on the word of God that what they said
[1:00:26] had nothing that would impact him
[1:00:28] that's where Christ was he was standing
[1:00:30] there he knew who he was he knew he
[1:00:32] where he where he was supposed to be and
[1:00:34] because he was in the will of God he
[1:00:37] couldn't have any doubts about it all
[1:00:39] the doubts had disappeared fear couldn't
[1:00:41] enter because there was no doubt there
[1:00:43] he was standing there fully in faith
[1:00:45] amen and in that place of Faith he was
[1:00:48] full of love he was full of compassion
[1:00:49] and he could take everything that they
[1:00:51] threw his way and all he all they would
[1:00:53] have seen was a gentle acceptance
[1:00:56] that you don't even realize what you're
[1:00:57] doing
[1:00:58] but I know what I'm doing and so because
[1:01:01] I know what I'm doing I'm able to accept
[1:01:02] what's going on in this situation even
[1:01:04] on the cross his words were father
[1:01:07] forgive them
[1:01:08] they know not what they do
[1:01:11] that's the kind of love we're talking
[1:01:12] about when when we won't be moved from
[1:01:14] the word they were crucifying their hope
[1:01:16] they were crucifying their God they were
[1:01:18] crucifying the very Messiah their very
[1:01:20] hopes and dreams and anticipation was on
[1:01:23] the cross and they were doing it and yet
[1:01:25] he said father forgive them
[1:01:28] what was he he was refusing to be moved
[1:01:30] from the word in love
[1:01:32] and he said don't hold it to their
[1:01:34] account they had to do this we know they
[1:01:36] had to do it
[1:01:38] so don't charge it to their account
[1:01:40] let it go this time
[1:01:43] very familiar scripture in first John 4
[1:01:45] says there is no fear in love
[1:01:49] no fear in love
[1:01:52] but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:01:55] because fear had torment he that feareth
[1:01:59] is not made perfect in love we love him
[1:02:02] because he first loved us if a man say I
[1:02:05] love God and hateth his brother he's a
[1:02:07] liar for he that loveth not his brother
[1:02:10] whom he had seen how can he love God
[1:02:12] whom he had not seen
[1:02:14] and this commandment have we from him
[1:02:16] that he who loveth God love his brother
[1:02:19] also
[1:02:21] I want to start with that first portion
[1:02:22] that says there is no fear in love but
[1:02:25] perfect love casteth out fear and say
[1:02:27] this a decision made out of fear is
[1:02:30] never
[1:02:31] ever
[1:02:32] a Godly decision
[1:02:35] if you are making a decision if you have
[1:02:37] made a decision if you're about to make
[1:02:38] a decision out of fear out of worry
[1:02:40] about concern of what will happen
[1:02:42] otherwise then it is not a Godly
[1:02:44] decision
[1:02:45] even if you've made it on the word of
[1:02:47] God
[1:02:49] because fear taints
[1:02:52] fear brings in a desire to control
[1:02:55] to mitigate
[1:02:57] to put something off see and it taints
[1:02:59] it and where fear is Faith Can't Be
[1:03:01] so the minute you introduce fear then
[1:03:03] faith has gone out the door and so fear
[1:03:05] taints the decision and it will take you
[1:03:07] off the word of God just that little
[1:03:09] smidge and God can't honor it because
[1:03:11] it's not a Godly decision amen because
[1:03:13] fear brings compromise every single time
[1:03:17] every single time if you're scared
[1:03:19] you'll compromise amen if you're scared
[1:03:21] something will happen you're going to be
[1:03:23] off the word of God because a Godly
[1:03:25] decision decision is always made in
[1:03:27] faith not in fear and I want to flesh
[1:03:29] this out a bit I want to spend a bit of
[1:03:30] time on this because when push comes to
[1:03:32] shove we can stand on the word all day
[1:03:34] long but we need to check our motive we
[1:03:36] need to check our objective we need to
[1:03:38] check our attitude as we go into these
[1:03:40] things otherwise Satan can get in and he
[1:03:42] can infect it just with those three
[1:03:44] little things
[1:03:46] I want to take us back to a well-known
[1:03:48] story
[1:03:49] and this is the story the Rich Young
[1:03:51] Ruler in Mark chapter 10
[1:03:53] and Jesus is talk this man comes to talk
[1:03:55] to Jesus and he has an opportunity now
[1:03:58] to share the gospel it says and when he
[1:04:00] was gone forth into the way there come
[1:04:02] one running
[1:04:03] and kneeled to him and asked him good
[1:04:05] master
[1:04:06] what shall I do that I may inherit
[1:04:08] eternal life
[1:04:09] and Jesus said unto him why call us thou
[1:04:11] me good there's none good but one that
[1:04:13] is God thou knowest the Commandments do
[1:04:16] not commit adultery do not kill do not
[1:04:18] steal do not bear false witness defraud
[1:04:21] not honor thy father and thy mother and
[1:04:23] he answered and said unto him master all
[1:04:25] these have I observed from my youth he's
[1:04:28] a good man
[1:04:29] we meet people like this don't we you
[1:04:32] can go around the world and you'll meet
[1:04:33] them and and some of them are professing
[1:04:35] Christians and some of them aren't
[1:04:38] but they lead what we would call good
[1:04:39] lives they they have good morals they
[1:04:42] they they they they're they're careful
[1:04:43] they're considerate they're
[1:04:44] compassionate in all these things
[1:04:47] but that's not what's going to get us
[1:04:48] eternal life
[1:04:51] it's not what's going to do we'll read a
[1:04:52] quote later that talks about this but
[1:04:54] Watch What Happens here
[1:04:56] because we're talking about I shall not
[1:04:58] be moved and we're talking about I shall
[1:05:00] not be moved under the the rainbow of
[1:05:02] love if I could put it that way it says
[1:05:04] then Jesus beholding him loved him
[1:05:08] now Church what would love look like to
[1:05:10] most of the world do you think in this
[1:05:12] situation
[1:05:13] because God's love is not the same as as
[1:05:15] the world's love and God's love is not
[1:05:18] the same as natural love so I want you
[1:05:19] to catch here that as this is going to
[1:05:22] be love projecting this is God's love
[1:05:24] projecting and watch how this love is
[1:05:26] shown because we want to bring it down
[1:05:27] to where we live at today it says and
[1:05:30] Jesus beholding him loved him and said
[1:05:34] love have words it said one thing thou
[1:05:37] lackest
[1:05:38] go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and
[1:05:43] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[1:05:45] treasure in heaven
[1:05:46] and come take up the cross and follow me
[1:05:52] and he was sad at that saying and went
[1:05:54] away grieved for he had great
[1:05:56] possessions and Jesus looked round about
[1:05:59] and saith unto his disciples how hardly
[1:06:01] shall they which have riches enter into
[1:06:04] the kingdom of God Church what did love
[1:06:06] look like that day
[1:06:08] love was not an affirming love that day
[1:06:11] was it
[1:06:13] love was the word made flesh telling
[1:06:16] that man what he needed to know
[1:06:18] that's what love looked like that day
[1:06:20] the word was standing in flesh and the
[1:06:22] word in love gave him directly the
[1:06:24] answer that he was seeking for his life
[1:06:27] it's so easy to compromise in these type
[1:06:29] of situations church because we're
[1:06:31] dealing with people often that have good
[1:06:33] intentions
[1:06:35] that have a good attitude that are open
[1:06:37] to conversation that are open to witness
[1:06:40] and often the first thing they do is
[1:06:42] they bring I have done this
[1:06:44] and I have done that and I'm here and
[1:06:47] I'm there and this is what I'm doing
[1:06:48] with my money and this is what I do with
[1:06:49] my church or this is what I do with my
[1:06:51] family and what is so easy to do there
[1:06:54] is to sit there and affirm what they've
[1:06:56] done and leave it at that
[1:06:59] but Jesus doesn't do that to this young
[1:07:01] man notice Jesus doesn't take away his
[1:07:03] witness
[1:07:04] Jesus doesn't take away his testimony
[1:07:06] his own testimony of his own life amen
[1:07:08] he didn't beat him over the head with
[1:07:10] his answer he didn't punch him between
[1:07:11] the eyes he didn't preach a fire and
[1:07:13] brimstone service he just said one thing
[1:07:16] you lack
[1:07:17] just one thing charged if he could ever
[1:07:19] say there's only one thing I'm missing
[1:07:21] I'd be happy
[1:07:22] but the thing is when he tells me what
[1:07:24] it is will I take it
[1:07:26] because it's hard because usually the
[1:07:28] thing we lack is the greatest thing that
[1:07:30] we are holding on to ourselves just like
[1:07:32] this young man did amen
[1:07:34] love said one thing thou lackest
[1:07:37] love went to the need
[1:07:40] love went to the root of the problem
[1:07:43] straight to it and it told him the truth
[1:07:47] it told him the truth and I don't think
[1:07:50] I have it in in my in my quotes here but
[1:07:53] I had it and I took it out I know where
[1:07:54] brother Brown said the holy spirit will
[1:07:56] tell the truth on you
[1:07:58] the holy spirit will get to the root of
[1:08:00] the issue the holy spirit will come
[1:08:02] right down and touch that point in my
[1:08:05] life that needs to be fixed
[1:08:07] he doesn't pull punches but he does it
[1:08:10] in love and whether it comes over this
[1:08:12] Pulpit whether it comes in devotions
[1:08:14] whether it comes to a spouse a brother
[1:08:16] or sister in this church it will come in
[1:08:18] love because it will not be compromised
[1:08:21] by what you're going to feel with that
[1:08:23] truth
[1:08:24] now that young man was a good young man
[1:08:26] he was a ruler he was a man of prestige
[1:08:28] he was a man that was recognized in that
[1:08:30] time but we're preaching on love shall
[1:08:33] not be moved and we see here that love
[1:08:36] does not change based on the receiver
[1:08:41] the truth doesn't change based on the
[1:08:43] receiver we're dealing with people
[1:08:45] sometimes and the truth is literally 180
[1:08:48] degrees opposite of what that person
[1:08:50] believes or has been taught or these
[1:08:52] different things but if we compromise
[1:08:54] because of what we are worried about
[1:08:55] they're going to do
[1:08:57] then what we have is natural love not
[1:08:59] godly love
[1:09:01] because natural love will compromise
[1:09:03] every time what is it trying to hold on
[1:09:05] to the relationship trying to hold on to
[1:09:09] the connection trying to hold on to
[1:09:11] catch this trying to hold on to the
[1:09:12] opportunity to continue to witness to
[1:09:14] them down the road
[1:09:17] sometimes what happens is we're looking
[1:09:20] for the second opportunity so we
[1:09:22] compromise the first
[1:09:24] Jesus never did that the apostles never
[1:09:27] did that you come with a question
[1:09:28] they'll give you the answer and they'll
[1:09:30] give it to you with the full word not
[1:09:31] just the part of the word amen sometimes
[1:09:33] what happens is we want to soften the
[1:09:35] impact
[1:09:37] we want to soften the impact we don't
[1:09:39] want the person to get their back up and
[1:09:42] so we back off on the truth a little bit
[1:09:44] we round off the sharp edges Church the
[1:09:47] word is a double-edged sword
[1:09:50] it cuts going and it cuts coming back
[1:09:53] but it does it clean
[1:09:55] I may have told this story before when I
[1:09:57] was in Texas working with Halliburton on
[1:10:00] a co-op work term and I was doing some
[1:10:03] electrical work which was my first
[1:10:04] mistake but I was working and I was
[1:10:07] cutting some conduit and it was up in
[1:10:08] the air like this and I was again second
[1:10:11] mistake I was cutting it with a brand
[1:10:13] new exacto knife and it's this this uh
[1:10:16] this this this uh plastic
[1:10:20] um uh you know conduit for for wiring
[1:10:23] and I went and I was cutting and I was
[1:10:25] cutting and I was almost through and I
[1:10:28] pushed hard and it went through and it
[1:10:29] sliced right into right into the the
[1:10:31] palm of my hand
[1:10:32] and I've bled for 150 feet it took me
[1:10:35] all on the floor to get to the first aid
[1:10:38] station 150 feet just blood gushing out
[1:10:40] of that hand
[1:10:42] but it didn't hurt
[1:10:44] and it took him about a they took me
[1:10:46] from there took me to the nurse from a
[1:10:48] nurse to a doctor which was about two
[1:10:50] hours later perhaps and and the doctor
[1:10:52] came in and he shot it full of needles
[1:10:55] and he stitched it up but before I did
[1:10:56] it I said doc it doesn't hurt I said
[1:11:00] is there something wrong did I cut a
[1:11:02] nerve he said well what did you cut it
[1:11:04] with I said I cut it with an X-Acto
[1:11:06] Knife he says was it a new blade or was
[1:11:09] it an old blade I said it was brand new
[1:11:10] I just taken it out of the package he
[1:11:12] says it'll never hurt he says it's a
[1:11:14] perfect cut he says because a perfect
[1:11:16] blade doesn't tear he says it's tearing
[1:11:19] that causes pain and muscle he says but
[1:11:21] when you have a something like a scalpel
[1:11:23] he says it doesn't hurt because it cuts
[1:11:25] it so perfectly that it can join right
[1:11:27] back up together again
[1:11:29] that's the way the word works
[1:11:31] you know you've been cut
[1:11:33] but the pain doesn't come with it
[1:11:35] because it does it so perfectly but what
[1:11:37] happens you take something away from
[1:11:39] that word what does it do it puts a burr
[1:11:41] on the edge
[1:11:43] The Edge is not perfect anymore
[1:11:45] and so now when you cut you actually
[1:11:47] hurt them worse than if you gave them it
[1:11:48] the raw truth with the full Cutting Edge
[1:11:51] of that word amen
[1:11:53] what is it this world hates absolutes
[1:11:56] have you noticed that this world doesn't
[1:11:58] like an absolute answer and when someone
[1:11:59] asks us a question we have an absolute
[1:12:02] we have an absolute and it's right here
[1:12:05] so I can quote from this and get
[1:21:40] serpent seed is the litmus test
[1:21:43] that's not what we're supposed to be
[1:21:44] doing going around making it as
[1:21:46] difficult as possible for people but
[1:21:48] when they ask and answer give them ask a
[1:21:50] question give them the full word answer
[1:21:51] that's all give them the full word we
[1:21:53] have a full word we have an open Word
[1:21:56] and it was for rapturing Faith it was to
[1:21:58] get us off this Earth so let's give them
[1:21:59] a full word answer let's not pull our
[1:22:01] punches because we're scared we're going
[1:22:03] to hurt them
[1:22:04] but if we can do it in love they'll see
[1:22:06] it's in love and they'll see the
[1:22:07] sincerity of our hearts they'll see our
[1:22:09] attitude and they'll be able to accept
[1:22:10] these things out of us
[1:22:12] amen the truth doesn't delude itself to
[1:22:15] make it palatable
[1:22:16] ever
[1:22:17] and that's what we see today is a is the
[1:22:20] nature of compromise trying to make this
[1:22:22] gospel palatable
[1:22:24] and the more you you look around and see
[1:22:26] what's going on in churches these days
[1:22:28] the more you see they're trying to make
[1:22:30] it palatable
[1:22:31] they're trying to make you comfortable
[1:22:33] with where you're at and the real word
[1:22:35] is the most uncomfortable thing you'll
[1:22:36] ever experience because it takes you
[1:22:38] from where you are to where God wants
[1:22:39] you to be and that's an uncomfortable
[1:22:41] place because it's always resting on
[1:22:43] faith we don't have our our thing
[1:22:45] anymore but the basis for the Christian
[1:22:46] walk is always faith that means you've
[1:22:49] got to walk out like Abraham not knowing
[1:22:51] where I'm going
[1:22:53] that's not comfortable
[1:22:56] like I said the greatest compromise we
[1:22:58] have is when we seek the answer we have
[1:22:59] rather than the answer in the word of
[1:23:02] God and why do we do that
[1:23:04] because we don't want to let go because
[1:23:05] we're fearful
[1:23:06] we're fearful we're fearful of the
[1:23:08] response we're fearful of of undoing
[1:23:11] something we've already done many times
[1:23:12] if we were to be honest with ourselves
[1:23:13] we fear the consequences of a word
[1:23:15] decision We Fear the rejection of those
[1:23:18] that are going to be impacted by it
[1:23:19] especially if we've made the wrong
[1:23:21] decision before this
[1:23:22] and then compromise in the past is the
[1:23:25] hardest thing to correct today
[1:23:27] if I've compromised in my life if I've
[1:23:30] compromised in my home if I've
[1:23:32] compromised in my family then that
[1:23:33] compromise has produced fruit and if I
[1:23:36] go back and I finally take the word in
[1:23:37] its fullness and now apply it to my home
[1:23:39] what do I have to deal with all the
[1:23:41] vines of compromise that have grown in
[1:23:43] my home and that's the hardest thing is
[1:23:45] to stand there and say Daddy was wrong
[1:23:47] Daddy was wrong daddy didn't take the
[1:23:49] full word or daddy liked it
[1:23:52] daddy liked it
[1:23:54] but Daddy don't like it no more
[1:23:58] and we have to Humble ourselves
[1:24:01] and it takes Grace for us and from us to
[1:24:04] go in and rip out those roots of
[1:24:06] compromise that we have in our own lives
[1:24:08] what to go in and say I shouldn't have
[1:24:10] done it shouldn't have allowed it
[1:24:11] shouldn't have brought it in the house
[1:24:13] shouldn't have said it shouldn't have
[1:24:14] given you this it was my fault I'm
[1:24:17] responsible for it I've had to do it in
[1:24:19] my own family no doubt I'll have to do
[1:24:20] it again where we let things in
[1:24:22] unsupervised
[1:24:24] where we gave way just for a moment just
[1:24:26] for a day and the next day it's a little
[1:24:27] bit more and a little bit more and a
[1:24:29] little bit more
[1:24:30] what is it that compromise gets there
[1:24:32] and it starts to
[1:24:34] starts to grow in our lives the famous
[1:24:37] dandelions I've talked about they're
[1:24:38] foot and a half tall in some place on my
[1:24:40] lawn and I only molded on on Wednesday
[1:24:42] night
[1:24:43] they grow so fast compromise grows so
[1:24:46] fast and it infects everything inside of
[1:24:48] our life
[1:24:49] usually the things we're fighting are
[1:24:51] because of a compromise
[1:24:52] we let something in just a little bit
[1:24:54] and it grows into a big thing and then
[1:24:56] we wonder how did that get in it was a
[1:24:58] little compromise a week or two ago or a
[1:24:59] month ago or a year ago in some cases
[1:25:03] we've got to be able to say I moved off
[1:25:05] the word
[1:25:07] but now I'm coming back to the word and
[1:25:09] I'm not going to be moved from it I
[1:25:10] shall not be moved from this and if I
[1:25:12] got to make things right I'll make
[1:25:13] things right
[1:25:14] now if I got to bow down and I've got to
[1:25:16] repent and I'll repent now if I've got
[1:25:18] to make myself small and humble myself
[1:25:20] I'll do it
[1:25:22] otherwise what compromise will continue
[1:25:24] to grow and it starts to get into every
[1:25:26] aspect of your life
[1:25:27] because you'll fill one room and then
[1:25:29] he'll grow into the next and then he'll
[1:25:30] grow into the next and he'll grow into
[1:25:32] the next we've got to root it out
[1:25:35] but I want to take it even beyond that
[1:25:37] because Jesus example was in love for
[1:25:40] what
[1:25:41] to pass it on to us
[1:25:43] it was to be shed abroad
[1:25:45] it was to be shared with others amen
[1:25:47] we've got to start in our own life
[1:25:49] because we can't give what we don't have
[1:25:53] you know how hard it is to testify to
[1:25:54] somebody about a compromise you made
[1:25:59] you can't talk to somebody about well we
[1:26:01] don't have TVs when you just told them
[1:26:02] you watched a movie yesterday
[1:26:05] can you
[1:26:06] because I say well how does that work
[1:26:08] you don't have a TV but you watch movies
[1:26:10] and you've got no ground to stand on
[1:26:14] well we don't do this and we don't do
[1:26:16] that but
[1:26:17] but I just saw you there yesterday
[1:26:20] you've got to get it clear in your life
[1:26:21] before you can give it to somebody else
[1:26:23] amen you got to straighten up your life
[1:26:25] you've got to make sure that the whole
[1:26:26] word is operating in your life before
[1:26:28] you can give it to somebody else because
[1:26:29] otherwise they'll see through the
[1:26:31] hypocrisy
[1:26:32] which is what it is they'll see through
[1:26:34] the hypocrisy right in an instant the
[1:26:36] world is great at seeing hypocrites
[1:26:39] they lack Grace though
[1:26:41] but they'll catch us out every single
[1:26:43] time
[1:26:45] but we've got to be able to say I'm
[1:26:47] standing immovable on the word of God in
[1:26:49] my life
[1:26:51] but once we have that
[1:26:55] look at this first Corinthians 13.
[1:26:59] though I speak with the tongues of men
[1:27:01] and angels
[1:27:02] and have not charity I am become a
[1:27:05] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol
[1:27:10] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[1:27:12] and understand all Mysteries and all
[1:27:15] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:27:18] that I can remove mountains and have not
[1:27:20] charity I am nothing now I want you to
[1:27:22] notice this
[1:27:24] because Paul is pointing out to things
[1:27:26] that we would say I have
[1:27:28] I have a gift of Prophecy I understand
[1:27:31] all Mysteries I have all knowledge I
[1:27:34] have all faith
[1:27:36] so these are attributes these are
[1:27:37] characteristics that you could say I
[1:27:39] have or I am
[1:27:41] so he says if you don't have love and
[1:27:44] you am all those things he says you are
[1:27:48] nothing
[1:27:49] but Paul says I am nothing I like how he
[1:27:52] says it about himself
[1:27:54] let's not put it on the person next to
[1:27:55] us if I don't have it I am nothing I'm
[1:27:59] not worried about brother Josh I'm
[1:28:01] worried about me
[1:28:02] because I got to get it for me before I
[1:28:04] can ever do a thing for brother Josh and
[1:28:05] brother Josh can only do it for me once
[1:28:06] he's got it for himself amen
[1:28:09] he says I am nothing
[1:28:11] but watch now we transitions in verse 3
[1:28:13] and says and though I bestow all my
[1:28:15] goods to feed the poor and though I give
[1:28:17] my body to be burned and have not
[1:28:19] charity it profits me nothing so now
[1:28:22] we're into works because some people
[1:28:24] don't have a whole lot but they'll say I
[1:28:25] do a lot
[1:28:26] and I pay my tithes and I give to to
[1:28:28] these things and I go to to this place
[1:28:30] and I help with the orphans and I go do
[1:28:32] meals at the the the food bank and these
[1:28:35] different things and I do all these
[1:28:36] things and Paul says though you do all
[1:28:39] those he says it profits you nothing
[1:28:42] it has no benefit
[1:28:45] it has no benefit
[1:28:46] eternally and it has no benefit in God's
[1:28:48] eyes this is one of the things I share
[1:28:50] with with brother vicel's friend was
[1:28:52] that these thoughts of good works
[1:28:55] the only good works that you get
[1:28:57] recognition for when it all comes down
[1:28:59] to it is those that you did to the bride
[1:29:01] of Christ did you know that
[1:29:03] because remember he'll say when I was in
[1:29:05] prison you visit me when I was naked you
[1:29:07] clothed me when I was thirsty you gave
[1:29:09] me a cup of water when I was hungry you
[1:29:10] fed me and they'll say Lord when did I
[1:29:12] ever do that and he says when you did it
[1:29:14] under these the least of my brethren you
[1:29:17] did it unto me
[1:29:18] that's the only ones you get recognition
[1:29:20] for you can do it to everyone in the
[1:29:22] world if you don't do it to a member of
[1:29:24] the bride of Christ he says depart from
[1:29:25] you that work iniquity you did great
[1:29:27] things you did them in supposedly my
[1:29:29] name you did it for your own reasons but
[1:29:31] unless you do it to somebody
[1:29:33] that I love that is a part of me it
[1:29:35] doesn't count
[1:29:37] it doesn't count
[1:29:38] he draws the line there and Paul's
[1:29:40] saying you can do all these things but
[1:29:42] without charity it profits you nothing
[1:29:44] God doesn't recognize it doesn't even go
[1:29:46] on your account
[1:29:50] he says charity suffereth long
[1:29:55] but I hate that word and
[1:29:57] anybody else hate the word and in the
[1:29:59] scriptures
[1:30:00] because it means there's more
[1:30:03] you're held to a higher standard sister
[1:30:05] Mori
[1:30:07] amen charity suffereth long
[1:30:10] and is kind oh no
[1:30:14] no
[1:30:16] we suffer well
[1:30:19] how kind are we in our suffering
[1:30:23] church that's a high standard
[1:30:27] tell you in myself I don't have that
[1:30:30] I don't have that
[1:30:32] I don't cut that I I don't hit that Mark
[1:30:34] Amen to suffer and be kind
[1:30:37] simultaneously take something greater
[1:30:39] than I've got
[1:30:40] in myself
[1:30:42] he says charity envieth not
[1:30:46] charity vonteth not itself is not puffed
[1:30:49] up and the Amplified it says is not
[1:30:51] boastful or vainglorious and does not
[1:30:54] display itself hotly
[1:30:56] it does not behave itself unseemly
[1:30:59] seeketh not our own it says that word
[1:31:01] seeketh not her own says does not on sit
[1:31:05] not does not insist on its own rights or
[1:31:08] its own way for it is not self-seeking
[1:31:12] you get this kind of love
[1:31:14] you're not looking out for yourself no
[1:31:17] it says is not easily
[1:31:20] thinketh no evil
[1:31:22] thinketh no evil that means it does not
[1:31:25] take or pay attention it does not take
[1:31:27] offense or pay attention to a suffered
[1:31:31] wrong
[1:31:32] wow
[1:31:33] somebody does you wrong and it says
[1:31:36] father forgive him he doesn't know what
[1:31:38] he's doing father forgive her she
[1:31:40] doesn't know what she's doing
[1:31:42] listen to this
[1:31:44] program says in all the time these
[1:31:46] people are going on the spirit of the
[1:31:49] Living God is striving with flesh trying
[1:31:51] to get men away men away from his own
[1:31:53] achievement trying to get man away from
[1:31:55] his own selfish motives and objectives
[1:31:57] to a plan which God has laid down
[1:32:01] and as long as man Works in his own plan
[1:32:03] he will be a
[1:32:06] failure
[1:32:09] and as long as man Works in his own plan
[1:32:11] he will be a failure and a man can only
[1:32:14] achieve right when he comes back with
[1:32:16] the right objective with the right of
[1:32:18] motive and that is according to God's
[1:32:21] plan for
[1:32:23] him
[1:32:26] he says any other Foundation is on
[1:32:29] sinking Sands
[1:32:31] going back to our love chapter it says
[1:32:33] charity rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[1:32:36] rejoiceth in the truth
[1:32:39] now look at the capability of Charity in
[1:32:41] verse seven it beareth all things
[1:32:46] it believeth all things
[1:32:49] it hopeeth all things
[1:32:52] Earth all things
[1:32:57] you tell me what charity can't do
[1:33:01] it can do everything
[1:33:04] it can go through any situation can deal
[1:33:07] with any relationship deal with any
[1:33:08] person
[1:33:09] deal with any heartache deal with any
[1:33:11] sickness
[1:33:13] in your life or in somebody else's
[1:33:15] but look at verse 8. charity never
[1:33:20] faileth
[1:33:22] church that's a place I want to stand
[1:33:25] I want a love that doesn't fail
[1:33:28] I want a love that doesn't hit them you
[1:33:30] get to the bottom of the bucket and
[1:33:31] you've got nothing left to give anymore
[1:33:34] I want a charity that doesn't back down
[1:33:37] because it's not being received
[1:33:40] I want a charity that keeps going when I
[1:33:42] can't go
[1:33:43] that's greater than anything I've got in
[1:33:45] my in my own self amen it says but
[1:33:48] whether there be prophecies they shall
[1:33:50] fail
[1:33:51] whether there be tongues they shall
[1:33:52] cease and whether they're being
[1:33:54] knowledge it shall vanish away
[1:33:57] Prophet God said this he says the
[1:33:58] Christian loves the Lord and he loves
[1:34:01] him in such a way that Paul said neither
[1:34:03] death sorrow neither perils or
[1:34:04] imprisonments and anything can separate
[1:34:07] us from the love of God that's in Christ
[1:34:08] Jesus he said in my brother when you get
[1:34:11] that in your heart with that type of
[1:34:13] love that will beat anything else you
[1:34:16] could substitute for
[1:34:18] that's exactly right I don't care how
[1:34:20] much you spoke with tongues how much you
[1:34:22] shouted how many great Services you've
[1:34:24] had or been in how well your name's on
[1:34:26] the book how many times you've been
[1:34:28] baptized in which way he says it will
[1:34:30] never amount to one thing until that
[1:34:33] real genuine Holy Ghost love sinks into
[1:34:36] your heart till you first love him above
[1:34:39] everything else there is in the world
[1:34:40] right he says we put so much stress on
[1:34:43] the evidence of the Holy Ghost the
[1:34:45] Methodist said you had to shout for you
[1:34:47] got it a lot of Methodist shouted and
[1:34:49] didn't have it the Pentecostal Smith
[1:34:51] speak with tongues when you got it a lot
[1:34:52] of them spoke in tongues and didn't have
[1:34:54] it that's right but brother when you
[1:34:56] come to a place where you God love it
[1:34:59] will never fail it will never fail he
[1:35:02] didn't say I won't fail in my flesh
[1:35:04] didn't say I won't fall down didn't say
[1:35:06] I wouldn't step away but it will never
[1:35:08] fail
[1:35:10] they have its perfect work through you
[1:35:12] it will never fail
[1:35:15] it takes time
[1:35:18] you got to have patience for this kind
[1:35:19] of love
[1:35:20] but it will never fail because it's not
[1:35:24] yours it's his amen
[1:35:28] it says for we know in part
[1:35:30] and we prophesy in part gifts and
[1:35:33] understanding are all partial here
[1:35:34] Church
[1:35:35] we don't have it all yet we got to wait
[1:35:37] to the other side to get that full
[1:35:38] understanding we only know and
[1:35:40] understand as much as is needful for our
[1:35:42] journey here
[1:35:43] no one man has it all no one Ministry
[1:35:46] has it all no one church has it all it's
[1:35:48] a global body amen it's an elected bride
[1:35:51] of Christ he says but when that which is
[1:35:53] perfect is come then that which is in
[1:35:56] part shall be done away
[1:35:58] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:36:01] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:36:03] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:36:06] childish things for now we see through a
[1:36:09] glass Darkly but then face to face now I
[1:36:12] know in part but then shall I know even
[1:36:15] as also I am known he says in that
[1:36:19] hope and charity these three but the
[1:36:22] greatest of these is charity
[1:36:28] yo brother Eugene Braun taught me two
[1:36:30] very important things and one of the
[1:36:32] greatest ones that I I hold on to this
[1:36:34] day is he says God's love
[1:36:36] is based on your spiritual growth
[1:36:40] God's love is not here to put money in
[1:36:42] the bank
[1:36:43] it's not here to put Health in your body
[1:36:45] it's not here to make your relationships
[1:36:48] great in your family great your
[1:36:49] relationship with God is based on a love
[1:36:51] that takes you back to him
[1:36:54] look what he did to job
[1:36:56] how thou consider my servant job there's
[1:36:58] none like him in all the land a more
[1:37:00] perfect man than job did not exist at
[1:37:02] that time
[1:37:03] and what did God do took everything away
[1:37:06] from him for what his spiritual growth
[1:37:09] to give him a revelation of the
[1:37:10] Resurrection
[1:37:13] that's the kind of love we're talking
[1:37:14] about we'll cover maybe someone in the
[1:37:17] in some future services but brother
[1:37:18] Brandon would say he says he says the
[1:37:20] way we look at love is the way we look
[1:37:22] at compassion
[1:37:23] he says and we go around and we look at
[1:37:25] every single need and think that I've
[1:37:26] got to take care of that need because
[1:37:28] that's what God would do and he says
[1:37:29] that's not God's compassion God's
[1:37:31] compassion is elective and it's for the
[1:37:33] best thing for you
[1:37:35] always
[1:37:37] it's for your spiritual growth
[1:37:39] but we look at this word charity
[1:37:42] and we say what is charity
[1:37:44] we're a charitable organization we're a
[1:37:46] registered charitable organization today
[1:37:49] so people would say what is Charity well
[1:37:50] charity is giving charity is love
[1:37:52] charity is Good Will charity is helping
[1:37:54] charity is sacrifice and the apologists
[1:37:57] listed in the scriptures before and said
[1:37:59] all those things are not charity he says
[1:38:01] all of those things without charity are
[1:38:02] no good
[1:38:03] so that's not what charity is
[1:38:05] but we go back to the Greek and that
[1:38:07] that word charity is the word Agape
[1:38:09] which is the noun
[1:38:12] and then there's the word Agape which is
[1:38:14] the verb
[1:38:16] and we hear that so much we talk about
[1:38:18] agapo love agapo love is the active love
[1:38:20] of God
[1:38:22] it's God's love in action and Agape is
[1:38:25] just the the noun of it it's what it is
[1:38:27] but agapao is what it does it's how it
[1:38:30] works in these things but this is God's
[1:38:32] Own love and it's not a natural love
[1:38:33] it's not natural affection and it
[1:38:35] doesn't work the way our love does
[1:38:38] we're talking about I shall not be moved
[1:38:40] and we're talking about what God's love
[1:38:42] does for our life amen our loves makes
[1:38:44] excuses for The Giver
[1:38:46] and the receiver
[1:38:47] all the time we're making excuses for
[1:38:49] these things our love will compromise to
[1:38:51] soften an argument or allow somebody
[1:38:53] even to hold on to something that's not
[1:38:55] according to the word of God because we
[1:38:57] want to hold on to the relationship
[1:39:00] church we do it if we stop and look so
[1:39:02] many times we won't give the full truth
[1:39:05] because we value the relationship
[1:39:07] how can we value a relationship more
[1:39:09] than the word of God
[1:39:11] that's what we're doing when we do that
[1:39:12] when we pull our punches that way when
[1:39:14] we refuse to give a straight answer what
[1:39:16] we're saying is I value you more than I
[1:39:18] value the word of God and it's a
[1:39:20] compromise
[1:39:21] it's a compromise and we're being moved
[1:39:23] off of it
[1:39:24] sometimes we lose a connection
[1:39:27] anybody else lost a connection because
[1:39:28] you told somebody something straight
[1:39:31] it happens even within our own ranks
[1:39:34] but in time because that person is a
[1:39:36] child of God they come back around
[1:39:39] every time
[1:39:40] every time they come back around but
[1:39:43] what is it they're growing in God's love
[1:39:46] and God's love takes you to his word
[1:39:47] every time so that you've got a strong
[1:39:49] foundation in every situation amen the
[1:39:52] love that Paul's talking about here is
[1:39:53] completely different because our love
[1:39:54] fails
[1:39:55] our love is dependent on whether we had
[1:39:57] our coffee this morning whether we slept
[1:39:59] well last night whether somebody's been
[1:40:01] loving on us
[1:40:03] it's so dependent and therefore it's
[1:40:05] cyclical
[1:40:06] we've got good days of love and we've
[1:40:08] got low days of love in ourselves don't
[1:40:10] we
[1:40:10] but this is a love that he's talking
[1:40:12] about that never fails
[1:40:14] never fails there's nothing that can can
[1:40:16] take it there's nothing that can exhaust
[1:40:17] today man
[1:40:18] it's never failing how many of us can
[1:40:21] say our love is never failing
[1:40:24] I can't say my natural love is that's
[1:40:25] for sure it fails
[1:40:27] as I get tired as I get worn out
[1:40:30] maybe I ought to take up some coffee
[1:40:33] but it what it Ebbs and flows in and out
[1:40:35] good days bad days but this charity has
[1:40:38] Paul says this charity never fails it
[1:40:41] never fails
[1:40:42] amen church I need more of that kind of
[1:40:44] love I need something that doesn't fail
[1:40:47] day in and day out I believe I've got it
[1:40:49] I believe I've got it I'll tell you why
[1:40:51] as we start to close here amen but I
[1:40:54] want a love that honors the recipient
[1:40:56] enough to keep loving them even when
[1:40:59] they don't like what I've got for them
[1:41:01] because when we give somebody the word
[1:41:03] we're giving them the antidote to this
[1:41:04] world
[1:41:05] we're giving them the medicine that they
[1:41:07] need for this life and guess what
[1:41:09] sometimes children spit out medicine
[1:41:12] don't they sometimes adults spit out
[1:41:14] medicine too why because they don't like
[1:41:17] the taste and they're more concerned
[1:41:18] about how it tastes and how it feels and
[1:41:21] how it sits on them rather than the
[1:41:23] effect and so they start to fight you
[1:41:25] over it amen
[1:41:26] but what this is a love that never fails
[1:41:28] because I'm doing it for you not for me
[1:41:32] that's how you know it is this is about
[1:41:34] you and that's why I'm continuing to
[1:41:36] love you that's why I'm continuing to
[1:41:37] give the word I honor you enough I
[1:41:39] appreciate you enough I love you enough
[1:41:41] to keep giving you the word because
[1:41:43] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:41:44] fix you it's the only thing that's going
[1:41:45] to fix your situation
[1:41:47] Paul would say this in Romans he says in
[1:41:49] Hope maketh not ashamed
[1:41:52] but this is where this love comes from
[1:41:53] this charity we're talking about he says
[1:41:55] because the love of God is shed abroad
[1:41:57] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:42:00] given to us so it's not our love it's
[1:42:03] his love
[1:42:04] it's by the Holy Ghost and it's given to
[1:42:07] us that means it's outside of us and
[1:42:09] comes into US it means you don't
[1:42:11] naturally possess it it's something that
[1:42:12] has to be delivered to you it's
[1:42:14] something that has to be given to you
[1:42:15] it's something that has to be sealed
[1:42:16] inside of us and that's something that's
[1:42:18] going to take us forward no matter what
[1:42:19] we're feeling or thinking or doing that
[1:42:21] day amen
[1:42:23] you want to love your family with this
[1:42:25] kind of love
[1:42:26] get the Holy Ghost
[1:42:28] you want to love your brothers and
[1:42:29] sisters get the Holy Ghost you want to
[1:42:32] love this world the way they need to be
[1:42:34] loved get the Holy Ghost it's the only
[1:42:35] way we'll do it otherwise we'll
[1:42:37] compromise for all sorts of other
[1:42:38] reasons amen this love will give them
[1:42:41] what they need and you can't give it to
[1:42:42] them unless you've got it yourself
[1:42:45] you can't give them what you don't have
[1:42:47] because they won't believe it unless
[1:42:48] they see it
[1:42:54] Revelation 2 19.
[1:42:58] this is a thyatiran church age I believe
[1:43:00] it says I Know Thy works
[1:43:02] and love and service and faith and thy
[1:43:06] patience and thy works again
[1:43:09] and the last to be more than the first
[1:43:13] Brother Brad would say this he says in
[1:43:14] this verse he is commending his children
[1:43:16] because they were living changed lives
[1:43:20] their Works testified to a new spirit
[1:43:22] within men saw their good works and
[1:43:25] glorified God he said yes sir if you are
[1:43:27] a Christian you are going to do what is
[1:43:30] right your Works will show that your
[1:43:33] heart is right
[1:43:34] this is where Works come in he says and
[1:43:36] it won't be something you put on for you
[1:43:39] will do his will when no one but God
[1:43:41] sees you and you will do his will even
[1:43:44] if it costs you your life
[1:43:47] even if it costs you your job even if it
[1:43:50] costs you your relationship even if it
[1:43:53] costs you your family
[1:43:57] why you got a new family
[1:44:00] you've got a new home
[1:44:02] you got a new job you got a new purpose
[1:44:05] those things come and go but this is a
[1:44:08] love that never fails it never leaves he
[1:44:10] says I know your love service faith and
[1:44:13] patience he says you will note that
[1:44:15] their love is placed between works and
[1:44:17] service and that is the right place for
[1:44:19] it because without love our works are
[1:44:22] not accepted before God and neither is
[1:44:25] our service
[1:44:28] he says Paul speaking to the Corinthians
[1:44:30] said without love I am nothing and
[1:44:32] whatever I do is without prophets profit
[1:44:35] unless it is done in love now you can
[1:44:37] see right here that these Believers
[1:44:39] weren't in that Nickelodeon in the right
[1:44:40] focus it won't put in the right time it
[1:44:42] won't put in the right motive won't put
[1:44:44] in the right of objective and because of
[1:44:46] that it won't have the right effect
[1:44:48] you need the Holy Ghost to love somebody
[1:44:50] right
[1:44:52] it's the only way you can do it
[1:44:54] because it's a love that will love
[1:44:56] whether they receive it or not whether
[1:44:58] they believe it or not whether they want
[1:45:00] it or not
[1:45:01] regardless of how they respond the Holy
[1:45:03] Ghost will keep you loving that person
[1:45:07] it'll make you love the unlovable
[1:45:09] brother Brandon would say he says that
[1:45:10] that filio love that natural love he
[1:45:13] says would see a man come over and and
[1:45:15] touch your wife and you go pull a gun
[1:45:17] and shoot him because you loved your
[1:45:19] wife
[1:45:20] he says but agape love God's love he
[1:45:23] says we'll have you put your arm around
[1:45:24] that man and pray for his lost soul
[1:45:28] sometimes we get rising up
[1:45:30] because we love our family so much we
[1:45:32] love this one so much we love that one
[1:45:34] so much and we're forgetting that
[1:45:36] there's a greater love than all of that
[1:45:37] that's supposed to guide our responses
[1:45:40] regard our actions our reactions all of
[1:45:44] these things that's what we need in
[1:45:46] these situations we can get so stubborn
[1:45:49] and say I shall not be moved
[1:45:51] but is it love that's motivating your
[1:45:54] position
[1:45:55] because you can stand there stubborn
[1:45:58] obstinate
[1:45:59] proud
[1:46:00] hottie here I am
[1:46:05] right
[1:46:06] that's not God's love
[1:46:08] it's not God's love
[1:46:10] but if you say I won't move because if I
[1:46:12] move then you don't get his love the way
[1:46:14] you need it
[1:46:15] that's going to have an effect
[1:46:17] when you tell someone that we've dealt
[1:46:18] with it with children
[1:46:20] I'm only doing this because I love you
[1:46:24] right I'm only spanking you because I
[1:46:26] love you
[1:46:27] I'm only not letting you have a
[1:46:28] chocolate bar at 9 00 PM because I love
[1:46:31] you because I want you to get your sleep
[1:46:33] because I want you to do this and that
[1:46:34] and as we're dealing with each other as
[1:46:36] we're dealing with people around this
[1:46:37] world we've got to be able to say I'm
[1:46:39] only doing this because I love you
[1:46:41] I'm only telling you what the Bible says
[1:46:43] because I love you enough to give you
[1:46:45] the opportunity to accept what God's
[1:46:46] doing
[1:46:47] to make a wrong choice right
[1:46:50] to make a wrong situation right to give
[1:46:52] you the opportunity to step into God's
[1:46:54] will instead of your own will
[1:46:56] it's the hardest thing to do sometimes
[1:46:58] is to tell somebody nothing's going to
[1:47:00] work until you make it right with the
[1:47:02] word of God
[1:47:04] it's the only thing that's going to work
[1:47:05] and otherwise fear will stay in your
[1:47:07] life stress will stay in your life
[1:47:10] you'll lose your sleep you'll use your
[1:47:11] health you'll gain your weight you'll do
[1:47:13] this you'll do that and nothing's going
[1:47:15] to change until you say Lord I'm not
[1:47:17] going to be moved from your word
[1:47:19] and where I have moved I'll come back
[1:47:22] amen
[1:47:23] you do that now you can start helping
[1:47:26] the brother next to you now you can
[1:47:27] start helping the sister next to you now
[1:47:28] you can start helping your kids now you
[1:47:30] can start helping your spouse now you
[1:47:31] can start helping your family when
[1:47:32] you've got a love that never fails
[1:47:34] because it's shed abroad by the holy
[1:47:35] spirit in your life according to the
[1:47:38] word of God and according to the leading
[1:47:39] of God I love how brother Brown said
[1:47:41] earlier he says it's God's will for you
[1:47:45] guess what brother Dale's got love to
[1:47:47] give to the world and his will be
[1:47:49] different than mine because he's got a
[1:47:50] different path than I do
[1:47:52] brother Josh got a different one
[1:47:54] and and Selena and Justine they have
[1:47:57] different paths because they're in
[1:47:58] different spheres of influence they've
[1:48:00] got these different things and God gives
[1:48:01] them leadership to do things in certain
[1:48:03] ways according to the word and it's to
[1:48:05] have an effect it's to spread that
[1:48:07] gospel amen but even amongst ourselves
[1:48:11] I can't help you if I don't give you the
[1:48:13] word of God
[1:48:14] that's why our fellowship is around the
[1:48:16] word
[1:48:17] not around feelings you know that it's
[1:48:19] so easy to compromise and I don't know
[1:48:20] why I'm continuing
[1:48:22] it's so easy to compromise because you
[1:48:24] understand
[1:48:28] you can say I've been there
[1:48:30] I know what that feels like
[1:48:33] I know how that hurts
[1:48:36] we can even say you're justified in
[1:48:38] feeling that
[1:48:41] but that doesn't justify you taking the
[1:48:43] course of action you're doing
[1:48:47] we're so willing to empathize
[1:48:50] but that's not God's love
[1:48:53] that's not God's love
[1:48:55] God's love is
[1:48:57] I understand
[1:49:00] but there's a way out
[1:49:02] there's a higher plane there's a greater
[1:49:04] love there's a deeper love
[1:49:07] there's a higher faith
[1:49:09] there's a great arrest there's a greater
[1:49:10] peace hey have you heard about
[1:49:12] forgiveness
[1:49:14] let me tell you about forgiveness
[1:49:18] whatever it is to take it to that to
[1:49:20] that person in a way to say I understand
[1:49:23] where you're at
[1:49:25] but that ain't where God is
[1:49:28] and to say here's where God is God is in
[1:49:30] his word so here's what he says to
[1:49:31] resolve it here's how he says to help it
[1:49:34] you know I I've joked
[1:49:38] as men when we're dealing with wives
[1:49:41] so often they want our understanding
[1:49:44] they want to listen near
[1:49:46] and you know what us men want
[1:49:48] we want to fix it
[1:49:51] but that happens in all sorts of
[1:49:52] relationships
[1:49:54] listening to my wife won't fix it but a
[1:49:56] lot of times it fixes a lot of the issue
[1:49:58] but if there's a root problem my
[1:50:00] listening is not enough
[1:50:02] I still have to bring a solution
[1:50:04] but sometimes I do have to gain that
[1:50:06] trust
[1:50:07] I have to listen I have to see where
[1:50:09] you're at
[1:50:10] before I can give you the answer but in
[1:50:12] the end if I don't give you the answer I
[1:50:13] haven't done anything for you except
[1:50:15] solidify you where you're at
[1:50:17] rather than point you to where God wants
[1:50:19] you to be amen
[1:50:20] amen let's bow our heads if we would
[1:50:23] Heavenly Father
[1:50:27] Lord we want to be effective
[1:50:31] Lord we want to love like you love
[1:50:34] Lord and that means we want to speak
[1:50:35] like you speak we want to think like you
[1:50:37] think we want to move like you move
[1:50:39] Lord we want to respond and react the
[1:50:42] way that you respond and react
[1:50:44] and Lord we can only do that as your
[1:50:46] holy spirit is shed abroad in our heart
[1:50:48] Lord that abroad means it's spread into
[1:50:50] every nook and cranny every corner of
[1:50:52] every room Lord it goes through every
[1:50:54] door it goes through every window Lord
[1:50:57] it saturates our life it saturates our
[1:50:59] hearts it saturates our souls it
[1:51:01] saturates our beings Lord God and God we
[1:51:04] can't give it unless we've got it
[1:51:06] so Lord I'm praying that you'll give us
[1:51:08] more of your Holy Spirit Lord I'm
[1:51:10] praying you'll give us more of that
[1:51:11] Divine love Lord that puts us into
[1:51:13] action according to your word Lord that
[1:51:16] puts us into action in a way that makes
[1:51:18] us effective for the community around us
[1:51:20] Lord that puts us into action for the
[1:51:22] good of the brothers and sisters that
[1:51:24] are gathered here and around this world
[1:51:25] as well Lord we're praying that your
[1:51:28] spirit will move in our heart sword and
[1:51:30] that when it moves or we would say I
[1:51:32] shall not be moved nor that we don't
[1:51:35] compromise Lord that we don't change our
[1:51:37] stance Lord that we don't pull our
[1:51:39] punches Lord but in love Lord we give
[1:51:41] each one your truth
[1:51:43] Lord for Thy word is truth
[1:51:46] Lord your word is truth
[1:51:48] Lord would you help us to stand strong
[1:51:51] Lord give us Faith Lord take out all
[1:51:54] fear
[1:51:55] give us words for the moment Lord to
[1:51:57] give a lord lord an explanation lord of
[1:52:00] the hope that lies within us
[1:52:03] Lord help us to be your Witnesses
[1:52:06] in our homes
[1:52:08] in this body of Believers Lord into a
[1:52:10] dying and sick world we pray
[1:52:13] Lord let us always act in love
