[28:58] We're able to go up and take the country
[29:03] about Joshua and Caleb.
[29:09] It was the Lord of hosts that led us out
[29:12] of Egypt sand. And he led us through the
[29:16] Red Sea by his mighty hand, never
[29:20] halting in the wilderness, but his
[29:24] command gave assurance we were able to
[29:28] possess the land.

[29:40] sea.
[29:43] And though Giants told me there a way to
[29:46] hinder,
[29:48] God will surely give the victory.
[29:53] When the spies brought back this
[29:55] message, this is what they said. Against
[29:59] giants and war cities, we cannot be led.

[30:40] land, we found wine and oil and milk and
[30:44] honey riches fruit abound. Sparkling
[30:48] fountains and the showers come upon the
[30:52] ground. We were able. Hallelujah. Let
[30:56] God's praise resound.
[30:59] Amen.
[31:02] and take the country
[31:04] and possess the land. Praise the Lord.
[31:10] And the giest beyond
[31:13] hinder,
[31:15] God will surely give the victory.
[31:20] There's no thirsting for old age since
[31:23] we're in this way. And we care not what
[31:27] the critics or the 10 spies say. For the
[31:31] land of thousands and plenty and we're
[31:34] here to stay. Won't you come and join
[31:38] us, brother? Enter in today.
[31:43] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[31:46] Amen.
[31:48] And possess the land from Jordan to the
[31:51] sea.
[31:53] The giants call be there a way to
[31:56] hinder.
[31:58] God will surely give the victory.
[32:03] And we are able to go up and take the
[32:07] country
[32:09] and possess the land from Jordan to the
[32:12] sea.
[32:14] From the giants to be there awaiting,
[32:19] God will surely give the victory.
[32:25] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[32:28] Amen.
[32:31] Let's not let the giants get in our way.

[32:41] this place.

[32:53] of the Lord

[33:17] see glory

[34:54] on each face.
[34:57] Surely

[36:05] Little girl was lying there. The people
[36:10] all were weeping.
[36:14] They just laughed at Jesus when he said
[36:18] she's only sleeping.
[36:22] As he took her by the hand,
[36:25] she began to live again.
[36:29] Some began to praise the Lord. And some
[36:33] began to say,

[40:51] We're thankful you've dwelt in these
[40:53] houses,
[40:54] Lord. That you've cleaned us out, filled
[40:57] us up,
[40:59] Lord, made us a dwelling place of the
[41:01] most high God.
[41:03] Lord, I pray we get a greater revelation
[41:05] this evening, Lord, that all darkness
[41:06] has to flee.
[41:08] Sickness has to flee,
[41:12] Lord. Every
[41:15] element of sin
[41:19] is up for destruction,
[41:23] Lord. Nothing can stand before us when
[41:25] you're with us. So Lord, I pray you take
[41:28] this service again, Lord. That you would
[41:31] speak, Lord, you would do what you do,
[41:35] Lord. That you'd minister to our hearts,
[41:37] our lives, our situations.
[41:40] Lord, that we walk out tonight and say,
[41:42] "It was wonderful to be in your presence
[41:45] once again.
[41:46] Lord, bless your people now. We pray in
[41:49] Jesus Christ's name we ask it." Amen.
[41:52] Amen. God bless you. Turn if you would
[41:54] to First Corinthians the third chapter.
[41:57] 1 Corinthians the third chapter. Good to
[41:59] see everybody here today. Amen. Enjoy
[42:02] the song service today as well. God
[42:04] bless you each one.
[42:08] Amen. Good to see sister Joan. Brother
[42:10] Bob made it to us. She texted and said,
[42:12] "We're not sure if we're going to make
[42:13] it to church. There's too many things to
[42:15] photograph."
[42:17] But she was joking, of course.
[42:20] But photography is a close second behind
[42:21] the Lord in their lives. So anyways,
[42:25] good to see you here. Amen. God bless
[42:27] you. 1 Corinthians 3 verse 10. This is
[42:32] Paul speaking. He says, "Now according
[42:33] to the grace of God, which is given unto
[42:35] me as a wise master builder, I have laid
[42:38] the foundation and another buildth
[42:40] thereon. But let every man take heed how
[42:43] he buildth thereupon. For other
[42:45] foundation can no man lay than that is
[42:48] laid, which is Jesus Christ." Amen. God
[42:51] bless. You can have your seats this
[42:53] evening. And we're continuing again, as
[42:54] you might have guessed, on our series on
[42:56] the Holy Ghost and absolute power once
[42:58] again. And we've been talking about this
[43:00] for quite some time. And and I I think
[43:02] you're probably about to the point where
[43:04] you say, "Brother John, you need to move
[43:05] on." But I'm taking my time in it
[43:08] because I want to close it out. And I
[43:09] want to close it out uh as perfectly as
[43:11] I I know how. And we know that we're
[43:14] looking at this power and we see that
[43:15] this power comes at a cost. The power
[43:18] comes with the cost of self. self-
[43:20] ideas, self-will, self- ambition,
[43:22] self-plans, self-thinking,
[43:24] self-religious ideas. Even this all has
[43:26] to die if we're going to come to a place
[43:28] of of experiencing this absolute power.
[43:30] And I'm not saying we haven't. Amen. I
[43:32] believe we sing the song, he's in the
[43:34] house. That's what the absolute power
[43:36] is. It's Christ dwelling inside of you
[43:38] and I. That's the absolute power we're
[43:40] talking about. But for that power to
[43:41] have effect, there's got to be a dying
[43:43] out daily. There's got to be a
[43:45] crucifixion daily. Amen. And so when we
[43:47] look at this, when we receive power in
[43:49] our life, it's not because of what we
[43:51] have. It's actually because of what we
[43:52] lay down, of what we give away about
[43:55] what we die out to and then we can
[43:57] receive Christ. And that's the thing
[43:58] that matters most is is when we can
[44:00] receive him. But I want to take two
[44:02] elements of this tonight on how do we
[44:04] come to a place of absolute power. If we
[44:07] were to say what is absolute power,
[44:08] remember what brother Bram said. He said
[44:09] the anointing is is to know exactly when
[44:11] and how or what and how. And we're
[44:14] talking about spoken word authority.
[44:16] We're talking about the adoption of sons
[44:18] and daughters of God and these different
[44:19] things. But there's two things that have
[44:21] to be be established in our life before
[44:23] we can ever come to that place. And this
[44:25] is really a part of the new birth, but
[44:27] it's the part of our Christian walk too
[44:29] as we're going through life. Amen. And
[44:30] the first thing that we we realize, the
[44:32] first element to absolute power is
[44:34] recognizing that the word of God is
[44:36] truth. Not that the word of God is true,
[44:39] but that the word of God is truth.
[44:42] Because we're going to talk about this a
[44:43] little bit today. There's a difference
[44:44] between true and truth because there's
[44:47] something that is always true and that
[44:49] is truth. And then there's something
[44:50] that is true for now or for a time or
[44:52] for a season or for a person and that is
[44:54] true but it is not truth. Amen. So we
[44:57] want to come to that. So we realize that
[44:58] it is God that is the absolute. It is
[45:00] the word of God that is the absolute and
[45:02] that word is truth because it is the
[45:05] absolute. Amen. It does not yield. It
[45:07] doesn't bend. It doesn't change. It does
[45:09] not flex based on where we are at in
[45:10] this life based on society based on
[45:13] politics. based on need. So often that's
[45:16] when we ch try and move the word of God
[45:18] is when we have a need and we don't like
[45:19] the way the word tells us to go. But the
[45:21] word of God doesn't change. It is
[45:23] inflexible. Amen. And to come to
[45:25] absolute power, we must realize there is
[45:27] an absolute. And for the believer, the
[45:29] absolute is the word of God. Amen. It's
[45:31] not the absolute is not joining a
[45:33] church. It's not doing what the pastor
[45:35] said. Those things are good, but they
[45:36] won't hold you. Amen. They won't take
[45:39] you all the way through. But there has
[45:41] to be a personal revelation that the
[45:43] word of God is an absolute. It is the
[45:46] absolute. It is perfect. It is entire.
[45:49] It lacks nothing. It has everything that
[45:51] we have need of to get off of this
[45:52] planet and go to be with Christ and then
[45:54] come back to with him to rule and reign.
[45:56] Amen. But until we come to a place where
[45:58] we recognize the word as an absolute.
[45:59] And when I mean recognize, I don't mean
[46:01] recognize here. I mean that there's a
[46:03] personal revelation in your soul that
[46:05] causes you to act on what you think you
[46:07] think rather than just thinking what you
[46:10] think. Amen. It'll cause us to act a
[46:12] certain way. Now remember what Jesus
[46:14] said. He said, "Sanctify them through
[46:16] thy tr through thy truth." And he says,
[46:18] "Thy word is truth." And then in Romans
[46:21] 3, Paul would say, "God forbid, yay, let
[46:24] God be true, but every man a liar." He
[46:27] says, "Why? that thou mightest be
[46:29] justified in thy saints and mightest
[46:31] overcome when thou art judge. Remember
[46:34] when we are faced with with issues we
[46:36] are justified because we speak what the
[46:38] word says not because of what I think or
[46:41] not because of what I determine or my
[46:43] feelings or my intellect or my
[46:45] education. But our justification is I
[46:47] stayed with the word. I speak the word
[46:50] back. What I said was truth. It was
[46:53] absolute. And therefore you are not
[46:55] judged but the word is judged. And you
[46:57] cannot judge an absolute. An absolute
[46:59] judges you. You cannot judge it. Amen.
[47:01] It overcomes it all because remember
[47:03] what brother Bram said an absolute is.
[47:04] He said it's it is the ultimate. He says
[47:07] it is the final word. So when you say
[47:09] the final word, you cannot be judged
[47:11] because you are a part of it. You've
[47:13] attached yourself to an absolute.
[47:15] Prophet of God would say this. He says
[47:17] God is the absolute. He said let every
[47:20] absolute otherwise than mine be a lie.
[47:22] Mine is the truth. He says, "So there is
[47:25] the absolute to Christianity. That's the
[47:27] end of all arguments. The Bible said so.
[47:30] That makes it right." But we see today
[47:32] so many people are trying to change the
[47:33] Bible because otherwise they would have
[47:35] to change. Nobody wants to change
[47:38] anymore. Everyone wants society. They
[47:40] want the economy. They want the way
[47:42] people work. They want the way that
[47:43] people make money. They want it to all
[47:45] wrap itself around their little whims
[47:47] and desires and ideas. I saw a candidate
[47:50] now in California for the US Senate
[47:52] believes that we should have a $50 an
[47:54] hour minimum wage.
[47:58] Wow. But what is she doing? She wants to
[48:00] bend reality
[48:02] to her thoughts. Now, we laugh at that.
[48:05] That woman is insane. That that you make
[48:08] $150,000 a year minimum in Cal in in
[48:11] California. But she is completely
[48:13] convinced she's right. Why? Because her
[48:16] thoughts are her absolute. Her ideas are
[48:18] her absolute. Wherever she got them
[48:20] from, however she came up with it, she
[48:21] believes that it's an absolute. Amen.
[48:23] But remember, humanity prefers to bring
[48:26] things to them rather than bend
[48:27] themselves to what is right or true or
[48:29] real. And so that's where we end up.
[48:31] That's how we end up the way we are
[48:32] today. Amen. Humanity likes to bring
[48:34] everything subject to itself because
[48:36] we're the apex of this world. And we
[48:38] think everything bows to us. And it does
[48:40] except for God. God is above all of
[48:43] this. And his word stands this. Amen.
[48:45] But with an absolute, we have to subject
[48:46] ourselves to it. Now listen to what the
[48:48] brother says. This is in the message and
[48:50] absolute. We'll quote a fair bit out of
[48:51] this tonight. He says, "In the day that
[48:53] we're living in now, everything is
[48:55] breaking up. It's so fragile and carried
[48:58] away. I think that this message would be
[49:00] a very appropriate thing, especially to
[49:03] Christians when they are going through
[49:04] their deep waters." Now, this is in
[49:06] 1963. It's after the preaching of the
[49:08] seals. And he says, "I think this
[49:10] message is necessary.
[49:12] this message on an absolute.
[49:15] He says the Christian church is passing
[49:17] through the deepest water it's had for
[49:20] the last 2,000 years. We are coming to a
[49:23] spot to where there's something
[49:25] presented to Christianity, something
[49:27] they have to make a decision on. And I
[49:29] think that the Christian church ought to
[49:31] have something that they know that they
[49:32] are tied to instead of just floating
[49:34] about like a leaf upon the water, the
[49:37] wind. He says, "As the Bible said,
[49:40] carried about by every wind of doctrine.
[49:42] The winds come and blow a little leaf
[49:44] this way, then another wind comes and
[49:46] the north wind, the south wind, the east
[49:48] wind, the west wind." He says, "You'll
[49:49] never get anywhere. You're not stable."
[49:52] Then he says these words, the Christian
[49:53] life should be a stable life. He says it
[49:58] should be something that's a principle
[50:00] that you are tied to that is more than
[50:03] life itself. Catch this. what you're
[50:06] holding on to is more stable than the
[50:08] very life you're going through. That's
[50:10] what we have need of. He says, "This is
[50:12] something that's needed for the church
[50:13] today because we're going through waters
[50:15] deeper than they've ever gone through."
[50:17] Why? Because evil is greater than it's
[50:19] ever been. Darkness is greater than it's
[50:22] ever been. Sickness is greater than it's
[50:24] ever been. Delusion is greater than it's
[50:26] ever been. And yet, religion is greater
[50:28] than it's ever been. We're surrounded by
[50:30] a an army of things that are coming
[50:33] against the Christian today. And he
[50:35] says, "You need to be stable to go
[50:37] through this. Deep waters produce really
[50:41] big waves
[50:43] in storms,
[50:45] hard situations." He says, "You need to
[50:48] be, it ought to be stable." And there's
[50:50] only one thing that's stable, church,
[50:51] and that is that which does not change.
[50:54] That's the only way that it works.
[50:55] Remember how Jesus would preach the
[50:57] parable of those two houses and he says
[50:59] one was built upon a rock?
[51:03] A rock doesn't move. Bedrock doesn't
[51:06] move. If you build a house on bedrock,
[51:08] it's never going to move. But if you
[51:10] build a house on sand now, you're going
[51:12] to have to worry because it'll sold
[51:14] it'll hold itself for a while in sand.
[51:16] But remember, he says they built the
[51:18] houses and for a while everything was
[51:20] okay. But then the rain and the flood
[51:22] and the storms came and nothing happened
[51:25] to the house that was built on a rock.
[51:27] Why? Because the foundation was stable.
[51:30] The house wasn't stable. It was the
[51:32] foundation that was stable. You can
[51:34] build anything on a rock and it'll
[51:36] stand. Because your foundation stands
[51:39] sure. But notice the exact same
[51:41] environment, the exact same conditions
[51:43] on the house that was built on a sand
[51:46] destroyed that house. And it says that
[51:48] the ruin of that house was great.
[51:52] It was funny when I looked up that word
[51:54] great. The word there is the Greek word
[51:56] mega. We use the word mega a lot. In
[51:59] other words, the ruin of that house was
[52:01] mega. It was exceedingly large. It meant
[52:03] building the the the building on the
[52:06] wrong thing makes the biggest mess
[52:09] because you build it so far. You build
[52:11] it as far as it will fail.
[52:14] And some things you can build really
[52:15] tall before they fail, but they're going
[52:18] to fail nonetheless if the foundation
[52:20] won't support it. There's a a place down
[52:22] in Florida, I believe, and they built
[52:24] this this large building on it, and it's
[52:26] sinking 3 in a year, I think, and
[52:29] they're doing everything they can do to
[52:30] pump up that foundation and reinforce
[52:32] it, but they can't do anything about it.
[52:34] It's built on shifting sands. They
[52:36] didn't do the foundation right. If you
[52:38] give it enough that time, that that
[52:40] building will sink into the ground and
[52:41] you'll never see it again.
[52:43] Great is the ruin thereof. Why? Because
[52:46] they built on something that was
[52:47] shifting, not something that was stable.
[52:50] Amen. Brother Bram says he never you
[52:52] never you notice here and in Jesus
[52:54] parable it's the same thing. He never
[52:56] said there won't be storms. But what he
[52:58] said was the Christian life is stable no
[53:01] matter what. That's what we're looking
[53:02] for in our lives. Amen. Why? Because
[53:04] it's tied to an absolute. It's anchored
[53:07] to something stronger than itself.
[53:09] That's how we're going to get through
[53:10] this. Now, as we've preached this
[53:12] before, we know there can only be one
[53:14] absolute because an absolute stands
[53:16] alone. It has all that it needs within
[53:18] itself. It references no one or thing.
[53:20] It's entire and complete in itself.
[53:23] Amen. So, that means our absolute can't
[53:25] be man-made. It can't be intellectual.
[53:27] It can't be theological. Amen. It'll
[53:30] never work. And if we build on those
[53:31] things, then the room whatever of
[53:33] whatever is built on it is going to be
[53:35] very great. And I have it here in my
[53:38] notes. Sometimes we need to recognize
[53:40] that we're building on something that's
[53:42] unstable.
[53:44] And what do you do when you're building
[53:45] on something that's unstable, church?
[53:48] In the in the financial world, they call
[53:51] it sunk costs. You get to a certain
[53:54] point and it doesn't matter if you move
[53:57] forward or go back. You're never getting
[53:58] your money back on what you've done. But
[54:00] you look at it and you say, "Is it still
[54:02] worth it to continue? Or is it better to
[54:04] just take our losses and go start again
[54:06] or go do something else?" And it's way
[54:09] better, church, if you're building on an
[54:11] unstable foundation, if you're not built
[54:13] on an absolute, to tear it down and walk
[54:16] away rather than keep building and
[54:18] building and building. Because the more
[54:19] you build, the greater the ruin that's
[54:21] on it. And that's the hardest thing to
[54:24] do is when you come to a place where you
[54:26] say, "I put I may have put weeks. I may
[54:28] have put months. I may have put years
[54:30] into building this and I realize it's
[54:32] not the Lord's will. Anyone else ever
[54:35] done that? You start down a path and you
[54:38] go a fair ways and then you realize
[54:40] God's not in it. And what do we do? Do
[54:43] we press on because we've invested so
[54:46] much time and effort? Maybe we've got a
[54:48] lot of of this facade of our our
[54:51] influence or or what people think about
[54:53] us built into this and we say, "I can't
[54:55] lose face and I can't back down." You
[54:57] know what? Great is the ruin thereof.
[55:02] We've got to be able to humble ourselves
[55:03] and say, "Sometimes I misstepped. I
[55:06] misspoke.
[55:07] I moved too fast. I moved in the wrong
[55:09] way."
[55:11] And just back up and say, "Lord, I'm
[55:13] sorry." And you kind of have to let the
[55:16] chips fall where they may. And what does
[55:17] it do? It humbles us. And it keeps us
[55:20] now a little more closely subject to God
[55:22] because we misstep so much. Amen. I'm
[55:25] speaking from experience. Amen. That
[55:27] loss is painful to do now, but it'll be
[55:29] way more painful if we let it keep
[55:31] going.
[55:32] So with that recognition that there is
[55:34] only one absolute, that the word of God
[55:37] is the absolute, there comes a second
[55:39] element of that whole thing, which is
[55:41] that I cannot be the absolute.
[55:45] If there's only one and it's not me,
[55:48] then I can't be it. Now that might seem
[55:50] obvious and yet so many times in life, I
[55:54] turn myself into the absolute. We turn
[55:55] ourselves into the absolute. We turn our
[55:58] mind, we turn our thoughts, we turn our
[56:00] feelings, we turn our emotions, we turn
[56:02] our perceptions into an absolute and we
[56:06] declare what we feel, think, believe,
[56:08] see, perceive, discern, whatever it to
[56:10] be, the truth and we don't bring it
[56:12] subject to the word. And what we do is
[56:14] we make ourselves an absolute. Amen. But
[56:17] if we are truly looking at God as the
[56:19] absolute, his word as the absolute, then
[56:22] if I can't be a part of it, as in I
[56:24] cannot add to it, then I cannot take
[56:27] away from it. Then that means I can't
[56:29] control it. I can't advise it.
[56:32] I can't manipulate it. I can't build it
[56:36] up. I can't tear it down. I only have
[56:40] one thing to do with an absolute. Listen
[56:43] and obey. That's the way it works for an
[56:45] absolute. And maybe in there I might be
[56:47] able to learn a few things as well. But
[56:49] it's not reliant on my learning. It's
[56:51] reliant on my obedience.
[56:54] He never said you know it all. But he
[56:55] says you need to obey it all. His
[56:57] requirement to us is to listen and obey.
[57:00] Amen. And that's what we do in the
[57:01] presence of an absolute. And when we
[57:03] look at Christianity today, what is it
[57:05] that has made us unstable?
[57:08] I'm not saying us. I'm saying the the
[57:09] the the declared Christian world. It's
[57:13] that humanity has made themselves the
[57:15] absolute. They have come up with better
[57:18] ways, better ideas, better methods of
[57:20] preaching. It's funny how I get ads. Uh
[57:23] somehow it's uh you know, it's figured
[57:25] out that I'm a preacher. And so I get
[57:27] ads on on software and methods to make
[57:30] my sermons better. And I'm a little
[57:31] curious to see what they're offering,
[57:34] but I don't have time to really go down
[57:35] that road. You're stuck with the way I
[57:38] am, folks.
[57:40] But I'm really curious as to what's out
[57:42] there. Because I'm curious what they
[57:44] would say is the best way to preach, the
[57:47] best way to develop a sermon. You know,
[57:49] when we were at the the First Baptist
[57:51] Academy there for the graduation, there
[57:53] was a preacher from from Burnern, I
[57:55] think it was, and he says, you know,
[57:56] there's three ways to do it. One is to
[57:58] to ask a question, one is to tell a
[58:00] story, and there was there was one other
[58:02] thing. And he said, I'm going to use all
[58:03] three today just to make sure I get your
[58:04] attention. But he was kind of he was
[58:06] kind of making light of it. But but this
[58:08] idea that that we know how to produce
[58:12] Christ better than Christ himself.
[58:16] It's it's insanity. But yet that's why
[58:19] we have 30,000 plus professing Christian
[58:22] denominations today is because every
[58:24] single one of them thinks that they know
[58:26] how to do things better than the Holy
[58:27] Spirit. I've been listening to the
[58:29] message choosing of a bride and brother
[58:31] Bam says that God gave us one thing to
[58:34] carry the church through to teach the
[58:36] church and to lead the truth. He says
[58:38] and that's the Holy Spirit. That's it.
[58:40] And if you have that, everything else
[58:42] will take care of itself. That's the way
[58:44] it's going to work. Amen. But the the
[58:46] the world has gotten to the place,
[58:48] Christians have gotten to the place
[58:49] where they have made themselves an
[58:51] absolute. And when they did that, what
[58:53] happened? Kab was written over the door.
[58:55] The glory of the Lord has departed. and
[58:57] they're worshiping Satan while preaching
[59:00] a partial word.
[59:02] They've got social religion now. That's
[59:03] what it is. It's a social religion
[59:06] that's brought the word subject to their
[59:08] ideas and therefore the word is no
[59:10] longer an absolute because if you
[59:12] correct an absolute that makes you the
[59:13] absolute now they have become their own
[59:16] absolute and they'll judge themselves
[59:19] because they rose themselves above the
[59:21] word. You know, we look in the book of
[59:22] Judges especially, and it has this
[59:24] phrase, "And every man did that which
[59:26] was right in his own eyes." That's where
[59:29] we're at today, church. That's where
[59:31] we're at in the message in many places.
[59:34] I hate to say it that way, but remember,
[59:36] it's got to come down into our ranks
[59:40] because there's a great falling away.
[59:41] And the great falling away is not just
[59:43] for outside. There's an inside falling
[59:44] away that's too. And what is it? It's
[59:46] men and women that are doing what is
[59:48] right in their own eyes. and they will
[59:50] not come subject to the word of God for
[59:51] this hour. And they'll come up with
[59:54] doctrines and they'll come up with walls
[59:55] and they'll come up with barriers and
[59:57] they'll come up with things to make you
[59:58] in and things to put you out and who's
[1:00:00] saved and who's not. And what is it?
[1:00:02] It's Kabad written over the door. The
[1:00:03] glory of the Lord has departed because
[1:00:04] you've made yourself the absolute.
[1:00:07] We've got people questioning the
[1:00:09] prophet,
[1:00:11] people refusing to quote the prophet,
[1:00:14] people refusing to acknowledge him as a
[1:00:16] prophet.
[1:00:18] And that man is the Holy Ghost speaking
[1:00:20] to us for this age. That's what the book
[1:00:22] of Revelation says in the third chapter.
[1:00:24] He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[1:00:26] the spirit say to the churches through
[1:00:27] what? An angel messenger.
[1:00:30] God help me if I ever stop quoting a
[1:00:32] prophet from behind this pulpit. If I
[1:00:34] do, kick me out immediately.
[1:00:37] Amen. Because he brought us back to the
[1:00:40] absolute of an open word. I'm not
[1:00:42] listening to a prophet. I'm listening to
[1:00:44] the Holy Spirit taking me back to the
[1:00:46] absolute power of the original
[1:00:48] Pentecostal church and beyond because it
[1:00:51] will take us into a resurrection and a
[1:00:52] rapture. That's what I'm here for. I'm
[1:00:54] not here to acknowledge a prophet. I'm
[1:00:56] here to acknowledge the message that he
[1:00:57] brought from Almighty God that restored
[1:00:59] us back to the faith of the original
[1:01:01] fathers. Amen.
[1:01:03] But what do we have today in
[1:01:04] denominations? We have a race to hell
[1:01:07] because they've made themselves an
[1:01:09] absolute and they turned away from God
[1:01:11] and they're going down, down, down.
[1:01:12] Remember, brother Bram saw that vision.
[1:01:14] He says, "And they were going down,
[1:01:16] down, down.
[1:01:18] Where is the bride going? Up, up, up."
[1:01:21] That means there must be a difference
[1:01:23] between our message and theirs. Because
[1:01:25] we're going in completely different
[1:01:27] directions.
[1:01:29] This is why surrender is so important.
[1:01:32] The first element of recognizing an
[1:01:34] absolute is to recognize it's there. But
[1:01:37] if we truly believe it and accept it, we
[1:01:40] will surrender to it. Amen. We must
[1:01:43] surrender to it. We must die out to what
[1:01:45] we think and believe and what we figured
[1:01:47] out. You know, my sister-in-law when she
[1:01:49] was here, she shared a funny story about
[1:01:50] her dad after he had left, of course,
[1:01:53] and and when he was uh you know, he's a
[1:01:56] successful businessman. and he's done
[1:01:57] very well in his life. But after I think
[1:01:58] about 20 or 30 years of running his
[1:02:00] business, he's a he's a professing
[1:02:02] Christian now or or I don't know when he
[1:02:04] was or if he was throughout, but he
[1:02:06] decided to read the book of Proverbs one
[1:02:07] day. And he found that every every
[1:02:11] business principle that he applied
[1:02:13] successfully in his business to make him
[1:02:15] successful was in the book of Proverbs.
[1:02:19] And it was like, if only I'd have read
[1:02:22] this 20 or 30 years ago so I could have
[1:02:24] just done it rather than figured it out
[1:02:26] on my own by trial and error. Why?
[1:02:29] Because even though he was perhaps a
[1:02:31] professing Christian, his absolute was
[1:02:33] not the Bible. His absolute was how he
[1:02:35] was living his life and the things that
[1:02:36] worked. But the Bible had already told
[1:02:39] him how to run a successful business.
[1:02:41] Our brothers here, they have it easy.
[1:02:42] They just need to read the Bible to make
[1:02:43] a successful living. Business is not
[1:02:45] hard, is it, Brother Joe?
[1:02:48] But the principles are there. And you
[1:02:50] can find people today that are that are
[1:02:52] running their businesses. They
[1:02:53] themselves may not be a Christian or or
[1:02:56] a professing Christian, but they know
[1:02:58] the principles of the Bible. And they'll
[1:03:00] use them and they will have a successful
[1:03:01] business because why? They're going by
[1:03:03] an absolute if only for that narrow
[1:03:05] portion of their life.
[1:03:07] You know what, church? God will bless
[1:03:09] you as much as you give him room to
[1:03:10] bless you. And if you obey the word,
[1:03:13] he'll give you what he promises in that
[1:03:15] section of the word. The problem is is
[1:03:17] if we don't let it have its full effect,
[1:03:19] we don't get the full effect. And the
[1:03:21] full effect is a resurrection and a
[1:03:22] rapture. So I don't just want it in my
[1:03:25] finances.
[1:03:27] I want it in the whole thing cuz that's
[1:03:29] what's going to get me out of here.
[1:03:31] That's what's going to give us the full
[1:03:32] effect of this. Amen. Now that's very
[1:03:34] simple. It relates to money and earning
[1:03:36] a living. Amen. And people will do that.
[1:03:39] But why do we surrender to an absolute?
[1:03:42] Why are we here doing things, saying
[1:03:44] things, believing things
[1:03:46] that make 99.999999%
[1:03:49] of the world look at us and say, "She's
[1:03:51] weird.
[1:03:53] He's missing out.
[1:03:55] He's antiquated. She's old-fashioned.
[1:03:59] Why do they have that spare tire on
[1:04:00] their head? Why do they dress that way?
[1:04:04] Why don't they do this? Why don't they
[1:04:05] do that?" We have all these things that
[1:04:07] we do that make us stand out, that make
[1:04:09] us weird, that set us aside. Why would
[1:04:11] we do it? Why would we accept an
[1:04:13] absolute that can make things so
[1:04:14] uncomfortable, even painful in our
[1:04:17] lives?
[1:04:19] Why are we here tonight?
[1:04:21] Why are we here tonight?
[1:04:27] Because we know he loves us.
[1:04:30] Because we know he loves us. Because
[1:04:32] there's something that draws us to this.
[1:04:34] Amen. There's only one reason to
[1:04:36] surrender to an absolute and it's
[1:04:38] because of love.
[1:04:40] But realize church, it is not because of
[1:04:42] my love. It's because of his love. It is
[1:04:46] that eternal love. It is that
[1:04:47] predestinated love. It is that perfect
[1:04:49] love. It is that pure love
[1:04:52] that makes me accept this as an
[1:04:54] absolute.
[1:04:56] That's the only thing that will work. My
[1:04:58] love for him won't do it. It's got to be
[1:05:00] his love for me that will do it. Amen.
[1:05:02] That's the cornerstone attribute of a
[1:05:04] child of God is that they can accept the
[1:05:06] word no matter how difficult it is. Why?
[1:05:10] Because they love him.
[1:05:13] But why do we love him?
[1:05:15] Remember what Jesus said? We love him
[1:05:18] because he first loved us. Amen. Our
[1:05:23] absolute is the only one that loves us,
[1:05:26] that loved us, and will love us always
[1:05:29] in exactly the way that we need to be
[1:05:30] loved. And that's why we will hold him
[1:05:33] as an absolute is because we've preached
[1:05:35] on this before. Romans 2:28, everything
[1:05:37] that absolute does is for our good.
[1:05:41] He's not just in it for himself. He's in
[1:05:43] it for us. And so that's why we would do
[1:05:46] that. Amen. Everything that we do in our
[1:05:49] life is wrapped in this scripture. This
[1:05:50] is the whole redemption story right
[1:05:52] here, church. That he loved me when I
[1:05:55] was unlovable. He loved you before you
[1:05:57] ever loved him. And in that love is our
[1:06:00] redemption. It's our salvation. It's our
[1:06:02] cleansing. It's our justification, our
[1:06:04] sanctification. It's the preparation for
[1:06:06] the infilling of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:06:08] then it's the Holy Ghost, the love of
[1:06:09] God itself that lives within us is
[1:06:11] because he first loved us.
[1:06:15] There's an absolute and then what makes
[1:06:18] us accept it is that we know that
[1:06:19] absolute loves us. That's why we accept
[1:06:22] it today. Amen.
[1:06:24] So we have this absolute of the word of
[1:06:26] God and it directs us and it shows us
[1:06:28] his will. But wrapped around that is the
[1:06:30] love of God. Amen. which assures us that
[1:06:33] everything that's going on in our life
[1:06:35] if we are in his will is for our good.
[1:06:38] That simple. That simple. So whether the
[1:06:41] word is hard one day or whether it feels
[1:06:44] easy and loving and comforting, it
[1:06:46] doesn't matter. We still take it as an
[1:06:49] absolute because we trust his love to
[1:06:51] us. Amen. We trust his love. Amen. We
[1:06:54] surrender because what we want is what
[1:06:56] he has for us. Not what I think I want.
[1:07:00] not what I think I need. Amen. And it
[1:07:03] can't be because of what I want because
[1:07:06] sometimes what he gives us is what he
[1:07:07] wants. And it's not easy for us. It's
[1:07:09] hard. It's hard sometimes what God wants
[1:07:12] for us, isn't it? It's hard to walk away
[1:07:14] from family. It's hard to walk away from
[1:07:16] opportunity. It's hard to turn down
[1:07:18] relationships. It's hard to turn down
[1:07:20] opportunities.
[1:07:22] But every time, he's got something
[1:07:23] better for us for our eternal good. Not
[1:07:26] just down here. Amen. But it takes a new
[1:07:29] birth. Amen. It takes the indwelling of
[1:07:30] the Holy Spirit to replace our desires
[1:07:32] with his desires, our plans with his
[1:07:35] plans. Amen. Our opinions for his truth
[1:07:37] and all these things. It takes the
[1:07:38] working of Almighty God. And that's what
[1:07:40] this whole series has been on is what
[1:07:42] does the Holy Ghost do in the mind and
[1:07:44] in the body and in the soul of a
[1:07:46] believer. And I want to just walk us
[1:07:48] through this a little bit tonight. And I
[1:07:50] want to do it in a table form. I'm
[1:07:51] channeling my inner brother Mark here a
[1:07:53] little bit. Amen. Because I think it's
[1:07:55] easier when we look at this in this
[1:07:57] form. Amen. And so we see here on the
[1:07:59] left side, we've got
[1:08:01] our heritage. So our bloodline, our our
[1:08:04] personality, our spirit, we call it our
[1:08:05] nature, the inward man. We have our
[1:08:07] controlling influences. And then we have
[1:08:09] the fleshly desires of the outward man.
[1:08:11] So these are the the primary elements
[1:08:13] that the new birth deals with. And so if
[1:08:15] we look at our natural birth, now notice
[1:08:17] I've called it here. Our natural birth
[1:08:19] is true. It is not truth, but it is
[1:08:22] true. And it is of the will of man.
[1:08:25] Amen. So our bloodline under our natural
[1:08:27] birth
[1:08:29] is that we are a child of dad and mom.
[1:08:32] And when we look at the scripture, it
[1:08:33] says that we are children of wrath.
[1:08:37] This is our natural bloodline whether we
[1:08:40] realize it or not. Now what about our
[1:08:42] our inward man? Our nature. When we look
[1:08:45] at Ephesians 2:2, it says that we are
[1:08:47] under a spirit of disobedience.
[1:08:50] Doesn't matter if you're raised in the
[1:08:52] message. Doesn't matter if you're raised
[1:08:53] in a Christian home. under your natural
[1:08:55] birth, you are under a spirit of
[1:08:57] disobedience to the word of God. Then we
[1:09:00] look at what are our controlling
[1:09:01] influences. And we look here and the way
[1:09:04] I'll put it is they are inconsistent and
[1:09:06] variable.
[1:09:08] We have our emotions, we have our
[1:09:10] environment, we have our relationships,
[1:09:12] politics, money, sensuality. And these
[1:09:15] things can be of God or they can be of
[1:09:17] Satan. We can be under the influence of
[1:09:20] God in our natural birth. Absolutely we
[1:09:23] can. Absolutely we can.
[1:09:26] But we can't be fully yielded.
[1:09:30] But we can be influenced by that. You
[1:09:31] can see people that were under the
[1:09:33] influence of God and yet they were
[1:09:35] completely lost. Look at Balum. Look at
[1:09:38] Judas. Still under the influence but not
[1:09:41] under a new birth.
[1:09:43] But this this idea of controlling
[1:09:45] influence is an interesting one because
[1:09:47] we've got a world influence. that's
[1:09:48] global now that says you can to
[1:09:51] everything that you say. Whatever you
[1:09:53] think, whatever you want, whatever you
[1:09:55] believe, they say, "Yep, that's good.
[1:09:56] You can do it." And what is it? The word
[1:09:58] of God will come behind and says, "No,
[1:09:59] you can't."
[1:10:01] We're stuck in this idea that if we
[1:10:03] believe we can do it, we can do it. And
[1:10:05] guess what? We can't. We can't change
[1:10:07] anything in this column in and of
[1:10:09] ourselves.
[1:10:10] We can't change the truth of it. We
[1:10:13] can't change the way it was done. We
[1:10:14] can't change where we come from. We
[1:10:16] can't change the way we react. We can't
[1:10:17] change any of these things on our own.
[1:10:19] Amen. We're doomed in our own humanity.
[1:10:22] And then we look at our fleshly desires
[1:10:24] and we have five inner senses and we
[1:10:26] have five outer senses.
[1:10:29] Amen. And that's Romans 7:23 tells us
[1:10:31] that. But now we come to the new birth.
[1:10:34] And when we look at the new birth, our
[1:10:36] heritage changes now. We go from a
[1:10:38] natural birth that is true and now we
[1:10:41] come to a new birth. And this is what I
[1:10:43] say is truth because this is of the will
[1:10:46] of God. It is by an absolute. It is not
[1:10:49] by the will of mom and dad. Amen. And
[1:10:52] that's John3. Who are born not of the
[1:10:54] will of man but of the will of God.
[1:10:58] Okay? That's our natural birth. So our
[1:11:01] our our new birth. So with that, you've
[1:11:03] got to see what's happening. Now when
[1:11:05] you go into a new birth, it changes your
[1:11:07] focus. It doesn't just change your
[1:11:09] focus. It changes the reality that you
[1:11:11] get to live in because we went here from
[1:11:14] true to truth.
[1:11:17] I can't change. It's true that I was
[1:11:19] born to Lanny and Sandy Klette. But that
[1:11:23] is true. But the truth is that I am born
[1:11:26] of God. And that takes precedence. That
[1:11:28] is absolute above and beyond anything
[1:11:31] that I get from Lanny, anything I get
[1:11:33] from Sandy. It is subject to the
[1:11:36] absolute of my new birth. Because that
[1:11:38] was before I am. That was before I did
[1:11:42] anything, before I inherited anything. I
[1:11:45] was this.
[1:11:47] So this is the power of the new birth is
[1:11:49] it turns you back to the absolute for
[1:11:52] yourself. And you can see yourself now
[1:11:55] as part of the absolute.
[1:11:58] It's not just a new birth. It's a
[1:12:00] restoration back to the original place
[1:12:03] that you came from. It shows you the
[1:12:05] seed source of who you are today.
[1:12:08] That's what the new birth is about. It's
[1:12:10] to restore you to truth.
[1:12:13] Not just which was, but because of it,
[1:12:16] that which shall be. And that which even
[1:12:18] is today, even if we don't see it.
[1:12:21] That's what the new birth does. That's
[1:12:23] what the Holy Spirit does. Now, watch
[1:12:25] our bloodline. We're a child of mom and
[1:12:28] dad. But now, we come in and we see what
[1:12:30] we are a child of God. And that takes
[1:12:34] precedence now over whatever hold mom
[1:12:36] and dad have on us. Whatever influence,
[1:12:39] whatever rights they have to us, God has
[1:12:41] a higher right because it is under an
[1:12:43] absolute of truth, not under the will of
[1:12:46] man.
[1:12:48] What about our nature, the inward man?
[1:12:51] We come from a spirit of disobedience.
[1:12:53] Now we come into a new spirit. Brother
[1:12:55] Graham says it's one that can get along
[1:12:57] with God. It's compatible with God. And
[1:13:00] that we see that in Ezekiel 36:26 or
[1:13:03] Romans 7:22. We have a new spirit.
[1:13:07] That is a new nature.
[1:13:10] That is a new way of responding to
[1:13:12] things.
[1:13:14] And it is better. But it is not best.
[1:13:18] But it allows you to get along with God.
[1:13:19] It gives you the nature of a dove
[1:13:21] instead of a wolf.
[1:13:24] Now we look at controlling influences.
[1:13:26] We said before they were inconsistent
[1:13:28] and variable.
[1:13:29] One day we could say it this way. God is
[1:13:31] influencing you. The next it's Satan.
[1:13:33] Sometimes it's within the same hour.
[1:13:35] Sometimes it's within the same minute.
[1:13:37] Okay? But now what happens is under the
[1:13:40] new birth, we come under a different
[1:13:42] influence. And our influence is the
[1:13:44] absolute because it is the literal
[1:13:46] spirit of truth. That's what Jesus
[1:13:48] called it. Amen. It is the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:51] It is God himself dwelling inside. Now
[1:13:54] you have somebody in the control tower
[1:13:56] at all times because he is sealed into
[1:13:59] your soul. There is no moment in and
[1:14:02] out. Your soul is sealed. He can't get
[1:14:05] out and nothing can get in. Your soul is
[1:14:07] sealed to the day of your redemption.
[1:14:08] The scripture says you are under the
[1:14:10] absolute control of the Holy Spirit in
[1:14:13] your soul. Okay.
[1:14:16] Then we come to this last one, fleshly
[1:14:19] desires.
[1:14:21] And this is where we hit a snag
[1:14:25] because the fleshly desires never
[1:14:27] change.
[1:14:30] You want to read that, go to Romans
[1:14:31] 7:23.
[1:14:33] We've read it before, preached on it, so
[1:14:36] I won't do it again today. But in all of
[1:14:38] that, the only thing that doesn't change
[1:14:40] are those fleshly desires. And if we
[1:14:42] look at this row on the right now, the
[1:14:44] new birth, you would say, you know what?
[1:14:45] I'm set for success. And you are. How
[1:14:49] can you lose with that? You can't lose.
[1:14:51] You're not going to lose. You will not
[1:14:52] lose. You're going to win. You're going
[1:14:53] to overcome. Amen.
[1:14:56] That's a winning combination. But it's
[1:14:58] that last woo. That's the fly in the
[1:15:00] ointment, isn't it? It's the fly in your
[1:15:03] soup. Everything's good until you see
[1:15:05] that fly. And you say, "We've got a
[1:15:07] problem. We've got a problem." And it's
[1:15:10] a really big problem. Amen. Because the
[1:15:12] only thing that doesn't change under the
[1:15:14] new birth is the desires for of this
[1:15:17] body. It just doesn't. And I'm going to
[1:15:20] go into that just for a moment so you
[1:15:21] don't misunderstand me. Amen. I'm not
[1:15:23] saying the new birth doesn't change our
[1:15:25] desires. It does. And if you haven't had
[1:15:28] your desires changed, you haven't had a
[1:15:30] new birth.
[1:15:33] Such were some of you. Right? This was
[1:15:35] Paul said to the Corinthians, "Your
[1:15:37] desires have been changed." But yet you
[1:15:40] look in Romans 7 and Paul says, "Listen,
[1:15:41] when I would do evil, when I would do
[1:15:43] good, evil's with me. And that which I
[1:15:44] would do, I don't do. And that which I
[1:15:46] wouldn't do, I do." This is the Holy
[1:15:47] Ghost fililled prophet of the age. He's
[1:15:49] the angel messenger to the Ephesian
[1:15:51] church age. And Paul says, "And I think
[1:15:53] I have the Holy Ghost." He did have the
[1:15:56] Holy Ghost, but yet he b he battled
[1:15:59] every single day of his life. Prophet of
[1:16:01] God, angel, messenger. So what doesn't
[1:16:04] change
[1:16:06] is your fleshly desires. Amen. Now
[1:16:09] remember what brother Bram says. He
[1:16:10] said, "I smoke as much as I want to. I
[1:16:12] drink as much as I want to." And I say
[1:16:13] the same thing. I smoke and drink and
[1:16:15] curse as much as I want to. Which is
[1:16:17] what? Not at all. I don't have a desire
[1:16:20] for that. I It's not even a a desire I'm
[1:16:24] conquering. It's not there. Okay? It's
[1:16:28] not there. But I've never had a real
[1:16:30] taste of alcohol or smoking or partying
[1:16:33] or anything. Never really had a desire
[1:16:35] for it in the first place. So, I would
[1:16:37] say it's grace that's holding me. I
[1:16:39] haven't conquered anything. But some of
[1:16:40] you have had alcohol. Some of you have
[1:16:43] smoked. Some of you have partied. Some
[1:16:44] of you have done these things maybe that
[1:16:46] we not maybe that we shouldn't be doing
[1:16:48] that we shouldn't be doing but you did
[1:16:49] them anyways.
[1:16:51] Right. That's right. We all have these
[1:16:53] little things we've done. Some of us
[1:16:54] have done bigger things. Amen.
[1:16:57] But there's there's a difference between
[1:16:59] the inward man and the outward man.
[1:17:02] Okay. So I say I don't have any desire
[1:17:05] to to to party or drink or curse or any
[1:17:08] of those things. Amen. But that doesn't
[1:17:09] mean I can't be tempted by something I
[1:17:12] don't actively desire.
[1:17:14] Now that sounds like a paradox, but let
[1:17:16] me explain it simply. Amen. I don't want
[1:17:19] to listen to worldly music. I can say I
[1:17:22] don't have a desire for worldly music.
[1:17:24] Okay? But when I was a young person, I
[1:17:27] listen to a lot of worldly music on the
[1:17:29] slide. I listen to certain types of
[1:17:32] worldly music. I have favorite bands. I
[1:17:34] have favorite singers. today. If you
[1:17:36] told me a a certain song that you know
[1:17:38] that I used to listen to, if you give me
[1:17:40] enough time, I can probably come up with
[1:17:41] the lyrics to it or at least a portion
[1:17:44] thereof. Okay. What does that tell me,
[1:17:47] church? In your unconverted state, your
[1:17:50] flesh will tell you what your flesh
[1:17:51] desires and you'll do it. So, what that
[1:17:54] tells me,
[1:17:56] I hope I'm not shocking anyone tonight,
[1:17:58] is that brother John Curlet, your
[1:18:01] pastor's body likes certain types of
[1:18:04] worldly music. That's what it was drawn
[1:18:06] to and that's what it fed on. It didn't
[1:18:08] feed on things it didn't like. I can't
[1:18:10] stand rap music. Can't stand it. But
[1:18:12] listen, I know believers that listen to
[1:18:14] rap music before they got saved, but
[1:18:17] that was their fleshly desire. Okay? So
[1:18:22] I say this today, God knows my heart. I
[1:18:25] don't have a desire today to go listen
[1:18:27] to worldly music. I don't have a desire
[1:18:29] to add it to my Spotify list and listen
[1:18:31] to it when nobody else is around. I
[1:18:33] don't. Okay. But if I walk into a into a
[1:18:37] a place that is playing that music that
[1:18:39] I specifically listen to and if I dwell
[1:18:43] on it, then what happens? I remember
[1:18:46] what it was like. I remember how it felt
[1:18:50] and my body will say, "Hey, I like
[1:18:53] that." My body will say that.
[1:18:56] Absolutely. If I stay there long enough,
[1:18:59] my body will remember, "Hey, this was
[1:19:01] good stuff back in the day." Okay.
[1:19:05] But what happens is when I walk out of
[1:19:07] that store,
[1:19:09] the music stays there. It doesn't come
[1:19:12] with me. Okay? Why? Because my body
[1:19:16] responds to it, but my soul does not. It
[1:19:19] is a desire. It is not a hunger.
[1:19:23] There's nothing in here looking to feed
[1:19:24] on. Amen. Why, church? Because that
[1:19:26] music is at war with my soul.
[1:19:29] Hallelujah. That's why I don't want it.
[1:19:31] Is because there's something inside of
[1:19:33] me that is greater than what this flesh
[1:19:35] would desire. And the one that's on the
[1:19:37] inside wins over the one that's on the
[1:19:38] outside. There is no hunger there. Why?
[1:19:41] Because I've passed from death unto
[1:19:43] life. But that doesn't mean if I stayed
[1:19:46] there long enough, this body wouldn't
[1:19:47] start to enjoy it. Amen.
[1:19:51] But it wars against my soul. Now, I'm
[1:19:54] going to speak to men because I'm a man.
[1:19:56] I know how men are. You put a beautiful
[1:19:58] woman in front of a man and showing off
[1:20:00] her body. I don't care who you are, your
[1:20:02] body will respond. Your flesh will enjoy
[1:20:04] that. That is the nature of our bodies.
[1:20:07] We're hardwired to be that way. Okay?
[1:20:10] That's the way it is. But if you are a
[1:20:12] son of God, you'll do one thing.
[1:20:15] Turn your head.
[1:20:18] Why? Because the flesh would desire to
[1:20:19] look at it, but the soul says, "That's
[1:20:21] not for me. I'm saving myself. I have
[1:20:24] somebody at home waiting for me."
[1:20:25] Remember what brother Brown said? I've
[1:20:27] got someone waiting at home with me
[1:20:28] that's trusting me to turn my head.
[1:20:31] That's why we do it. There's something
[1:20:32] inside of us that do it. But let me
[1:20:34] share you. If you don't believe me, can
[1:20:36] I share with you what your prophet said?
[1:20:37] He's mine, too. Listen to this. Okay?
[1:20:40] He's talking about dancing and he's
[1:20:42] talking about a man that would take
[1:20:43] another woman into his arms or just a
[1:20:45] woman into his arms that's not his wife.
[1:20:47] Look how he says this. He says, "I don't
[1:20:49] care how saintly a man is as long as
[1:20:52] he's human. He cannot take the other sex
[1:20:54] in his arm, a female, without having a
[1:20:57] human sensation." He says, "And I don't
[1:21:00] care. You tell me that and I'll tell you
[1:21:02] you're telling a story." So if anybody
[1:21:05] was shaking their head while I was
[1:21:07] saying these words, you just told on
[1:21:08] yourself. He says, "If you're a man,
[1:21:10] you're going to feel something." He
[1:21:12] says, "And if you're a red-blooded man,
[1:21:14] if you're really a man, it's that way."
[1:21:15] He says, "You can't help it. You're a
[1:21:17] human." But catch this now. He says, "I
[1:21:20] don't say you do anything wrong now, but
[1:21:23] the sensation's there just exactly the
[1:21:26] same." In other words, he's saying
[1:21:28] you're not wrong for what you're feeling
[1:21:31] cuz the body's going to feel it no
[1:21:32] matter what you do. Amen. The flesh is
[1:21:36] hardwired. says the sensation is there,
[1:21:38] but it's just a sensation. But what
[1:21:40] makes it wrong? What makes it wrong is
[1:21:43] that it's feeding a sensation in your
[1:21:45] body that's only belonging to one other
[1:21:47] person. You know, it's wrong to have
[1:21:49] that sensation with that other woman or
[1:21:52] that other person. And that's what makes
[1:21:53] it wrong is that sensation is dedicated
[1:21:56] to one woman and that's your wife.
[1:21:59] Whether or not you have one, it's for
[1:22:00] your future wife.
[1:22:02] We preserve ourselves, men and women
[1:22:04] alike, for those things. Amen.
[1:22:06] doing it, knowing the reaction you're
[1:22:08] having is what makes it wrong.
[1:22:12] Amen. Knowing what your intentions or
[1:22:14] motives were in doing that, that's what
[1:22:16] makes it wrong. The body likes it and
[1:22:18] that's all there is to it. And there's
[1:22:20] never anything that's going to take that
[1:22:21] away until you get a perfect body. Cuz
[1:22:23] remember, Brother Brand, when he went on
[1:22:24] the other side, he says they came up and
[1:22:25] they hugged him. He says, "And I felt
[1:22:27] nothing." And this is what he's
[1:22:29] referring to. I felt no sensation, my
[1:22:32] precious brother.
[1:22:35] Amen. It'll take a body change to get
[1:22:38] rid of that sensation.
[1:22:41] Amen.
[1:22:44] Listen to what James said. He says,
[1:22:45] "Every man is tempted when he's drawn
[1:22:47] away of his own lust and enticed." Amen.
[1:22:51] So notice now there's a temptation
[1:22:52] that's of our own making.
[1:22:55] In other words, we put ourselves in the
[1:22:56] situation knowing what's probably going
[1:22:59] to be there or knowing what's definitely
[1:23:01] going to be there. And because we know
[1:23:02] our bodies will enjoy it, we put
[1:23:04] ourselves in a situation to do that. And
[1:23:07] what do we do? We go to a place that's
[1:23:09] got the wrong atmosphere. It's got the
[1:23:11] wrong music. It's got the wrong people.
[1:23:12] It's got the wrong scenery. And we know
[1:23:14] it's not right to be there, but we do it
[1:23:16] anyways. James says that's when you're
[1:23:17] tempted. And you are enticed and you're
[1:23:20] drawn into something you ought not to do
[1:23:22] because you knew going in what was going
[1:23:23] to be there. And you went anyways. That
[1:23:25] wasn't God tempting you. That was you
[1:23:27] tempting you.
[1:23:29] Sometimes we don't set ourselves up to
[1:23:30] be tempted. Amen. We don't control our
[1:23:34] environments at all times, do we? You go
[1:23:36] to work, listen, sometimes people are
[1:23:38] going to talk about certain things.
[1:23:39] They're going to play certain types of
[1:23:40] music. They're going to try and show
[1:23:42] things. They're going to get you to look
[1:23:43] at things. And what do you have to do?
[1:23:44] You got a choice. Do I stay or do I go?
[1:23:48] And sometimes the temptation is because
[1:23:49] we elect to stay rather than use our
[1:23:51] feet for discernment. Remember what
[1:23:53] happened with Joseph? Joseph's in the
[1:23:54] house alone. Piper's wife comes. She
[1:23:56] tries to seduce him. He says, "No, your
[1:23:59] your your your husband has given
[1:24:00] everything into my hands except you, and
[1:24:02] I can't I can't do anything that would
[1:24:04] dishonor him." And what did he do? He
[1:24:05] used his feet for discernment. And the
[1:24:07] scripture says he fled. He ran away. He
[1:24:11] didn't stick around. Sometimes the
[1:24:12] victory we need, church, is to run away.
[1:24:16] Not fighting at all is the victory we
[1:24:17] need. Many times to overcome is to turn
[1:24:21] Satan down. That's what we're looking
[1:24:23] for. Amen. Turn him down. Don't get
[1:24:26] entangled in it. You know, they've got
[1:24:27] that saying, discretion is the better
[1:24:29] form of valor.
[1:24:31] You know, Jesus, do you know Jesus
[1:24:32] preached that? He said, remember what
[1:24:35] king? He says, going to battle with
[1:24:37] 10,000 soldiers coming up against
[1:24:40] another king that has 20,000 sits down
[1:24:42] and figures out, can I win with my
[1:24:44] 10,000? And he said, if I can't if he
[1:24:47] can't win with that 10,000, what does he
[1:24:49] do? He says, while he's still a long
[1:24:50] ways off, he sends out ambassadors for
[1:24:52] peace to try and come to terms. Why?
[1:24:55] because he knows he's not going to win.
[1:24:57] In other words, discretion is better
[1:24:59] than fighting knowing you're going to
[1:25:00] lose. Don't get in the fight in the
[1:25:02] first place. Amen. Don't let the fact
[1:25:06] that you're a Christian make you think
[1:25:08] you can you can overcome any temptation
[1:25:11] because it is of if it is of your own
[1:25:13] making, you're going to fall. That's
[1:25:15] what James says. But now we have a
[1:25:18] temptation that's of God. And that
[1:25:20] temptation is very different. But let me
[1:25:21] let me finish this thought real quickly
[1:25:23] before we move on. Now, Brother Bram's
[1:25:25] talking about this because if we put
[1:25:26] ourselves in a place where our flesh is
[1:25:28] weak and we don't have the Holy Ghost,
[1:25:30] let me tell you, we're going to lose. If
[1:25:32] we do have the Holy Ghost, now it's up
[1:25:35] in the air
[1:25:37] because we lose with the Holy Ghost
[1:25:38] sometimes because what do we do? We
[1:25:40] suppress him. We push him away. We go
[1:25:42] against what he wants us to do. We know
[1:25:44] what we're getting into and we do it
[1:25:46] anyways.
[1:25:48] I can't say what God does in those
[1:25:49] situations. I've seen it go both ways.
[1:25:51] Now, watch this. He's talking now about
[1:25:53] a young man that wants to live right but
[1:25:55] has not had the new birth. He says,
[1:25:57] "Here's a little lady twisting herself
[1:25:59] down the street and here's a young
[1:26:01] fellow. His eyes catch it. He's a member
[1:26:03] of the church, but the first thing you
[1:26:04] know, he says there's no tie post in
[1:26:07] there." In other words, this young man
[1:26:08] has not received the Holy Ghost. She'll
[1:26:10] say, "Hello." He's got curly hair, kind
[1:26:13] of nicel looking, straight shouldered
[1:26:14] young man, maybe tried to live right. He
[1:26:17] says, she starts walking up to him, even
[1:26:19] a preacher. The first thing you know, he
[1:26:21] says, "What is it?" He says, "This out
[1:26:23] here, the flesh desire, and the spirit
[1:26:26] down here, yet anointed, saying, don't
[1:26:28] do it. Don't do it." Notice there's two
[1:26:32] desires that are waring. Now,
[1:26:35] the inner man under the influence of the
[1:26:37] Holy Spirit is saying, "Don't do it.
[1:26:39] Walk away." And yet the flesh, the the
[1:26:41] physical body, the flesh, is saying,
[1:26:42] "You know, you want to stay around. This
[1:26:45] could be good." Okay? It's a it's a
[1:26:48] paradox. And yet even as a child of God,
[1:26:51] that paradox can exist in your body that
[1:26:53] your soul is screaming no by the spirit
[1:26:56] of God inside of you. And the flesh is
[1:26:58] screaming yes, yes, yes.
[1:27:02] That's what Paul told us. When I want to
[1:27:04] do good, evil's with me.
[1:27:07] And sometimes I do that which I would
[1:27:09] not do. And what I want to do, I don't
[1:27:11] do it. There's a paradox. There's a
[1:27:13] battle. There's a war. That's why we
[1:27:15] have a war every day is because we're
[1:27:17] fighting things that this flesh wants
[1:27:18] every day. That's why Paul said, "I
[1:27:20] crucify my flesh how often."
[1:27:23] Every single day. Because there's a
[1:27:26] battle. There's a fight every day.
[1:27:28] Remember, for a child of God, this is
[1:27:31] tough. For a child of hell, it's no
[1:27:33] contest, church. He's going to go down
[1:27:34] in flames.
[1:27:36] He says, "But what will it do?" He says,
[1:27:38] "It'll move right around there." Hold.
[1:27:41] There it goes. What the? He says, "This
[1:27:44] is a man that is a young man that has an
[1:27:46] anointing on him, maybe even anointed to
[1:27:48] preach, but there's no typost. He has
[1:27:50] not received the new birth." He says,
[1:27:52] "And so he'll stick around to see what
[1:27:54] happens. He'll enjoy the opportunity."
[1:27:55] He says, "First thing you know, he's
[1:27:57] trying to make a date with her." Now,
[1:27:59] I'm preaching to the young people
[1:28:00] tonight. I want you to understand the
[1:28:02] battles you're in. And I want you to
[1:28:04] understand that the fact that you're
[1:28:06] tempted does not make you not a child of
[1:28:08] God.
[1:28:10] Temptation is not a sin. The scripture
[1:28:14] says Jesus was tempted.
[1:28:16] It says he was tempted without sin. And
[1:28:20] if he is our example, if he's the first
[1:28:22] of many brethren, that means that you
[1:28:24] too as a child of God can be tempted
[1:28:26] without sin. Why? Because the body wants
[1:28:30] what the body wants. And that's
[1:28:33] hardwired in. And there's no getting rid
[1:28:34] of that until you get a new body. But
[1:28:37] what is it going to take? It's going to
[1:28:39] take an absolute. It's going to take a
[1:28:40] changing of the inward man. the desires
[1:28:43] that matter there that are greater than
[1:28:45] that of the flesh to cause us to come to
[1:28:47] a place of overcoming in these
[1:28:48] situations.
[1:28:50] Amen. Every child of God will have
[1:28:53] fleshly desires that are contrary to the
[1:28:55] word.
[1:28:57] Every child of God will have fleshly
[1:28:59] desires that are contrary to the word.
[1:29:01] That's why this flesh has to be changed.
[1:29:05] You notice nothing else has to be
[1:29:07] changed when we're caught up. Soul's
[1:29:09] already been sealed. We got a new spirit
[1:29:11] that'll work just fine over there. We
[1:29:12] got the spirit of God. We got everything
[1:29:14] we need except what? This stinking
[1:29:16] flesh. There's a reason it has to be
[1:29:18] changed because it's got its own mind.
[1:29:20] It's got its own will. It's got its own
[1:29:22] desires.
[1:29:24] But look,
[1:29:26] temptation itself is not wrong. It's
[1:29:28] just a choice. That's all temptation is,
[1:29:30] is a choice. And there are temptations
[1:29:32] that are of God, and there are
[1:29:34] temptations that are of ourselves. We
[1:29:36] read what James said, but look at what
[1:29:37] Paul said, and this is in the the CSB
[1:29:39] version of the Bible. It says, "No
[1:29:41] temptation has come upon you except what
[1:29:43] is common to humanity." He says, "But
[1:29:46] God is faithful. He will not allow you
[1:29:48] to be tempted beyond what you are able.
[1:29:51] But with the temptation, he will also
[1:29:54] provide the way out so that you may be
[1:29:57] able to bear it." So temptation of God
[1:30:00] always shows you the exit. It shows you
[1:30:03] a way out. The way out is not to fight.
[1:30:05] The way out is to walk away. You You
[1:30:08] fight temptation by walking away, not by
[1:30:10] trying to overcome it.
[1:30:13] You disengage. You use your feet for
[1:30:15] discernment. You get yourselves out of
[1:30:17] the situation.
[1:30:19] And I can say this because I've been
[1:30:21] there. There are ways we do things in
[1:30:23] life where we know this is what's going
[1:30:25] to happen if I keep doing this tonight
[1:30:28] or when nobody's home or when I'm here
[1:30:31] or when I'm with that person. I know the
[1:30:33] way it's going to go because you fall
[1:30:35] once, you fall twice, you fall three
[1:30:36] times. You learn the patterns with your
[1:30:38] own flesh. I'm speak I'm preaching from
[1:30:40] experience, church. And so what do you
[1:30:42] do when you see you're taking the first
[1:30:44] step? You say, "Uh uh uh, we're walking
[1:30:46] a different direction." And you go in a
[1:30:48] completely different direction. You use
[1:30:51] your feet for discernment. You walk away
[1:30:52] from the opportunity. And that's the
[1:30:54] daily choice. Amen. But if we put
[1:30:56] ourselves in a position to be tempted,
[1:30:59] that's not of God. Amen.
[1:31:01] And if we do that knowing the weakness
[1:31:02] and desires of this body, then it's on
[1:31:04] us what happens after that. And we've
[1:31:07] we're going to reap what we sow in those
[1:31:08] things. Amen. But as we've said before,
[1:31:11] you might be able to go places and do
[1:31:13] things and be around people that I
[1:31:14] can't. And that's perfectly okay. I'm
[1:31:16] not here to tell you what's right and
[1:31:17] wrong in your life. I'm here to preach
[1:31:18] the word. God will apply it by the
[1:31:21] spirit in your life as to what's right
[1:31:22] and wrong with you. I can't work at a
[1:31:24] car dealership because I guarantee you
[1:31:26] every year I'd have a deal I couldn't
[1:31:28] pass up when I come home with the latest
[1:31:29] and greatest and most beautiful car
[1:31:31] because I like cars. I can't work at a
[1:31:33] donut factory.
[1:31:35] Can't work at a potato chip factory.
[1:31:38] Some people can listen. I go into these
[1:31:40] fast food restaurants and you see people
[1:31:42] that are that are skinny and you say,
[1:31:43] "How in the world are you skinny?" Now,
[1:31:45] if you ask them, it's usually it's my
[1:31:46] first day here.
[1:31:48] But occasionally there's that relic
[1:31:50] that's been there for a long time and
[1:31:51] they're still skinny. Why? They can
[1:31:53] handle it. But I couldn't handle working
[1:31:55] at a Tims or a doughnut shop or
[1:31:57] something like that. Amen. Why? Because
[1:31:59] those are chinks in this armor. Whether
[1:32:01] you believe it or not,
[1:32:04] but you've got chinks in your armor.
[1:32:07] And brother Bram says those are things
[1:32:08] you got to keep up keep covered by one
[1:32:10] thing, prayer. Which means you have to
[1:32:13] acknowledge that the is there in
[1:32:15] the first place. that you are not so
[1:32:18] absolutely im impenetrable that Satan
[1:32:21] can't get to you. And let me add this,
[1:32:24] if you'll allow me, cover it with prayer
[1:32:27] and intentional actions.
[1:32:30] Think before you move and say, "Why am I
[1:32:34] doing this?" Like I said, because if
[1:32:36] we're truly honest with ourselves, we
[1:32:37] know the steps we take to fall into
[1:32:39] temptation.
[1:32:42] Amen.
[1:32:44] But why is it we don't go down this
[1:32:46] road? Why don't I work in a donut
[1:32:47] factory today? It's because I've
[1:32:50] accepted an absolute.
[1:32:53] It's because we've surrendered to an
[1:32:55] absolute. Amen. We've given up the
[1:32:57] opportunity to find out if we like
[1:32:59] something for the promise of that which
[1:33:02] has caught our attention.
[1:33:04] Amen. I'm going for an inheritance
[1:33:06] incorruptible,
[1:33:08] above and beyond what we could ever ask
[1:33:10] or think. Eye has not seen. ear has not
[1:33:15] heard what God has prepared for those
[1:33:17] that love him. I'll take that over that
[1:33:20] which does canker and rust,
[1:33:23] burn,
[1:33:25] fall apart.
[1:33:27] I'll take that every single day. But
[1:33:29] I've ought to do it because I've
[1:33:30] accepted an absolute because I believe
[1:33:32] something that's greater than what's
[1:33:34] offered me here today. So, we give up an
[1:33:36] opportunity to find out if we'd like
[1:33:37] something. Now, here's the thing. I'm
[1:33:39] telling you, as a child of God, in the
[1:33:40] long run, you wouldn't. Anyways, I've
[1:33:43] always said I was always worried about
[1:33:44] what would happen if I gave my heart to
[1:33:46] the Lord and would I like being a
[1:33:47] Christian. Remember me saying that?
[1:33:49] Well, of course I'd like it because I'm
[1:33:51] miserable the way I am.
[1:33:55] But somehow we put it off because we
[1:33:56] think, well, I don't know. I don't know
[1:33:58] if I'll like it. I don't know if I can
[1:34:00] do it. Church, if there's a call there,
[1:34:02] respond to it. There's a reason it's
[1:34:04] there is because there's something
[1:34:05] inside of you that wants to be what God
[1:34:07] is calling you to be and do in your
[1:34:09] life. Amen. So yes, we turn things down,
[1:34:13] but I say we absolutely gain things
[1:34:14] here, too. You remember when remember
[1:34:16] when uh Peter and the apostles, Jesus
[1:34:18] said, "No man, you know, can come except
[1:34:20] he give up everything. But if he does,
[1:34:22] then then he'll have all these things."
[1:34:24] And Peter says, "Hey, we've we've given
[1:34:26] up everything for you. What about us?"
[1:34:27] He says, "You will have a hundfold here
[1:34:30] and in the kingdom to come." And I look
[1:34:33] around and I see we have more than most.
[1:34:36] I look at the marriages. I've talked to
[1:34:38] some of the brothers here. some of you
[1:34:40] with good marriages.
[1:34:43] And guess what? We have better marriages
[1:34:45] than most,
[1:34:48] whether we realize it or not. We have
[1:34:51] better children than most. We have
[1:34:54] better finances than most. We have a
[1:34:57] better balance than most. We have better
[1:34:59] health than most. Why? Because when we
[1:35:02] live by an absolute, it does what's best
[1:35:04] for us. And it keeps us in a healthy
[1:35:06] state of balance by the word of God. We
[1:35:09] benefit here above and beyond. And the
[1:35:11] things that most people really wish
[1:35:13] mattered in their life.
[1:35:15] And the things that they love the most
[1:35:17] are the things that destroy the things
[1:35:18] they wish they had most. You know, I I I
[1:35:22] there's a a man I see walking around my
[1:35:24] neighborhood from time to time and he's
[1:35:26] a big big man. Big man. And he's wearing
[1:35:31] the big some of the biggest shirts I've
[1:35:32] ever seen. And yet when he walks it
[1:35:34] still it still only comes to about here.
[1:35:36] And so he's got about 3 in of belly
[1:35:38] hanging out under a shirt at all times.
[1:35:40] And what's he doing? He's out walking
[1:35:41] with his wife trying to be healthy.
[1:35:44] His desire is to be healthy, but he's
[1:35:47] got a greater desire for something else
[1:35:48] in his life. And it's completely
[1:35:50] conquered him. What a shame. What a
[1:35:53] shame that he's missing out on something
[1:35:55] because he has what? Yielded to an
[1:35:57] absolute that has total power over him.
[1:35:58] Now,
[1:36:02] why are we better here? Not better
[1:36:04] people.
[1:36:06] Why do we have a greater inheritance
[1:36:07] here?
[1:36:09] Because we've surrendered to an
[1:36:11] absolute. That's why. It's the only
[1:36:13] reason why. Amen. And with that power,
[1:36:16] with that absolute comes power to live a
[1:36:18] life that works for your good according
[1:36:22] to the will and word of God. But if we
[1:36:24] look back at this table, we look at that
[1:36:27] last row and we see that that last row
[1:36:28] is the great weakness.
[1:36:31] And we're talking about absolute power.
[1:36:33] And when we look there, we've got to
[1:36:34] understand one thing. For this power to
[1:36:36] work, that has to become subject. It's
[1:36:38] the only way that this can work. Amen.
[1:36:40] It's our greatest weakness. Everything
[1:36:42] else has been changed. When you look at
[1:36:44] the influence that's changed, our inward
[1:36:45] man, our bloodline, our heritage,
[1:36:47] everything's changed. That's
[1:36:48] supernatural. You're a supernatural
[1:36:50] people tonight. You're a supernatural
[1:36:52] bride tonight. But yet, we're still in a
[1:36:54] battle. And yet, church, and this is
[1:36:57] where we're going with this series. And
[1:36:59] yet we're coming to a place where what
[1:37:01] we speak happens.
[1:37:03] What we desire comes to pass.
[1:37:07] What we judge is judged as we judge it.
[1:37:12] Yet in that per imperfect fleshly body,
[1:37:16] how's it going to happen?
[1:37:19] That's what we're going to get into.
[1:37:20] Amen.
[1:37:24] These bodies are still subject to those
[1:37:26] five inner and outer senses if we let
[1:37:28] them have it. Amen. And it's because of
[1:37:31] that weakness that we cannot be the
[1:37:34] absolute. We can tie ourselves to the
[1:37:36] absolute. We can let an absolute work
[1:37:39] through us, but we cannot be it
[1:37:40] oursself. Now, we can be, we're going to
[1:37:42] get into how we can be, but but but in
[1:37:45] our totality, we can't be a part of the
[1:37:46] absolute that way here. we're going to
[1:37:49] go be a part of it. But here there's a
[1:37:51] limitation on what we can do. We've got
[1:37:54] a limitation of the spirit because
[1:37:55] there's a limitation of the flesh. Now,
[1:37:58] it's not going to hold us back. But what
[1:38:00] it does is it has to come to a place
[1:38:02] where it's replaced.
[1:38:05] It's it's not even repaired. Scripture
[1:38:07] says it's going to be swallowed up.
[1:38:09] Every trace of sin will be swallowed up
[1:38:12] when we're completely swabbed in eternal
[1:38:14] life. That's what's going to happen to
[1:38:16] this body. Amen. Because why? This flesh
[1:38:18] in and of itself is completely incapable
[1:38:21] of pleasing God or producing the word in
[1:38:25] itself. It cannot do it. Remember what
[1:38:27] Paul said. He said, "I know that in me,"
[1:38:30] and he clarifies. He says, "That is in
[1:38:32] my flesh dwelleth no good thing. For to
[1:38:36] will is present with me, but how to
[1:38:38] perform that which is good, I find not."
[1:38:42] So this is what gets in the way of
[1:38:44] absolute power. This is what gets in the
[1:38:46] way of God working through us is the
[1:38:48] nature of our flesh. Amen. And so the
[1:38:50] only hope we have is to take flesh out
[1:38:52] of the equation.
[1:38:54] It it's funny. When I was in university,
[1:38:56] they were they were uh you know they're
[1:38:58] teaching us mathematics of course from
[1:39:00] an engineering standpoint and we're
[1:39:02] going through all these things and they
[1:39:03] have different ways to make assumptions
[1:39:05] to make equations easier to solve. And
[1:39:07] the idea is to get rid of the really
[1:39:09] clunky things so that it's really
[1:39:10] straightforward. And so they told a
[1:39:12] joke, you know, and they they've got a a
[1:39:14] uh a physicist in in the uh they've got
[1:39:18] three guys that are in a in a on a on an
[1:39:21] island, and they each have a can of of
[1:39:24] food, but they have no tools to open it.
[1:39:27] And one is a one is a physicist, one is
[1:39:29] an engineer, and one is a mathematician.
[1:39:32] And so they they arrived, you know, they
[1:39:35] were rescued a few days later and they
[1:39:38] saw two of the cans were open and and
[1:39:40] one of them wasn't. And they come up to
[1:39:43] the physicist. They said, "How'd you get
[1:39:44] your can open?" He says, "Well, I'm a
[1:39:47] physicist." He says, "I know the the the
[1:39:48] the rules of of mechanics." He said, "I
[1:39:52] understood exactly what I needed to open
[1:39:55] this up. I I knew how this was going to
[1:39:57] work." So he said, "I just I just
[1:40:00] cracked it on a rock exactly where it
[1:40:01] needed to go and boom, it popped right
[1:40:02] open. It was it was easy."
[1:40:05] They talked to the engineer. They said,
[1:40:06] "How'd you get yours open?" He said,
[1:40:07] "I'm an engineer." He says, "I can do
[1:40:10] stress analysis in my head. I just found
[1:40:11] the weakest point. Hit it there and it
[1:40:13] popped open." Says, "Then they went to
[1:40:15] the mathematician. They said, "How come
[1:40:17] you couldn't get your your can open?"
[1:40:19] And he says, "Well," he said, "I started
[1:40:21] with the assumption that the can is open
[1:40:24] to make it easy."
[1:40:26] That's what mathematicians do. They try
[1:40:28] and simplify. They do things easy. He
[1:40:30] took the can out of the equation, but
[1:40:32] that doesn't work when the can's the
[1:40:33] only thing in the equation. Right?
[1:40:35] Assume the can is open. Assume the can
[1:40:38] is open. Doesn't work. Right? That's
[1:40:41] what sometimes we're doing is we're
[1:40:42] sitting here saying, assume the flesh
[1:40:44] doesn't exist. You can't do that. You
[1:40:48] got to deal with it. You got to deal
[1:40:50] with it. We're in a battle, church.
[1:40:51] We're in a fight. We're in a fight. You
[1:40:54] can't just take it out of the equation
[1:40:55] by saying it's not there. I don't have
[1:40:57] desires I fight. I don't have habits I
[1:41:00] struggle with. I don't have besetting
[1:41:01] sins. I don't have things that are from
[1:41:03] my past I keep trying to come up.
[1:41:04] Church, you do that, you've lost
[1:41:06] already. Amen. You take it out of the
[1:41:08] equation by crucifying it daily by the
[1:41:11] power of the Holy Spirit in your life.
[1:41:12] That's the only way it's going to work.
[1:41:13] Amen. Paul's here saying here, he's
[1:41:16] saying, "I'm built to fail.
[1:41:18] I'm built to fail. There's nothing here
[1:41:21] that can do what I want to do. I am
[1:41:25] completely void of doing good. That's
[1:41:28] what the prophet of the age said. Ever
[1:41:30] feel that way?
[1:41:32] Ever have a day where you just think, I
[1:41:35] am not built to do what I'm doing?
[1:41:39] Not built to be a husband. Not built to
[1:41:40] be a wife. Not built to be a
[1:41:42] businessman. Not built to be a pastor.
[1:41:45] Not built to homeschool kids.
[1:41:48] Not built to be a mom. Not built to be a
[1:41:51] song leader, musician,
[1:41:54] whatever it is we're doing. Not built to
[1:41:56] be an ops manager. Matt,
[1:41:58] hey, we have days where it seems like we
[1:42:01] have nothing that we need to get the job
[1:42:03] done, and we're just an abject failure.
[1:42:05] Can't even take care of ourselves, much
[1:42:07] less everybody else. Anybody else ever
[1:42:09] feel that from time to time? Anybody
[1:42:11] else feel that all the time? Me and Joe,
[1:42:14] two hands up.
[1:42:16] The more you take on, the more you feel
[1:42:18] that way. You know, ever feel like you
[1:42:21] just keep reaching and you never grab
[1:42:23] hold. Remember, you ever see that
[1:42:26] picture of the carrot that's on the
[1:42:28] stick out in front of you and you can
[1:42:29] never get the carrot? It's like the
[1:42:31] greyhounds when they race,
[1:42:34] they're chasing something that they're
[1:42:35] never allowed to catch. It's a
[1:42:37] mechanical rabbit is what it is. But
[1:42:39] they say if they ever catch it, they'll
[1:42:41] never race again cuz they've done it.
[1:42:43] They've achieved it. But here's the
[1:42:45] thing. God does not leave us in a place
[1:42:47] where we don't achieve. Amen.
[1:42:50] Listen, if you feel
[1:42:53] that you're failing more than winning,
[1:42:56] that you can't just get there, let me
[1:42:58] tell you, you're in good company because
[1:43:00] it's you and the Apostle Paul in the
[1:43:02] same boat. Okay? Listen to this.
[1:43:07] He says, ' Unless I should be exalted
[1:43:09] above measure.
[1:43:11] Through the abundance of the
[1:43:12] revelations, there was given to me a
[1:43:13] thorn in the flesh, the messenger of
[1:43:15] Satan to buffet me, lest I should be
[1:43:17] exalted above measure. For this I
[1:43:19] besought the Lord thrice that it might
[1:43:21] depart from me. Paul prayed for
[1:43:23] deliverance for healing three times. Now
[1:43:24] that's two more than he would normally
[1:43:25] have to pray.
[1:43:27] He says, "And he said unto me, my grace
[1:43:30] is sufficient for thee,
[1:43:33] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:43:36] weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I
[1:43:38] glory in my infirmities, that the power
[1:43:40] of Christ may rest upon me." He says,
[1:43:43] "Now, therefore, I take what? Pleasure."
[1:43:48] This is another one of those groan
[1:43:50] portions of the sermon. Oh, man.
[1:43:54] I take pleasure in infirmities,
[1:43:57] in reproaches, in necessities, in
[1:44:00] persecutions, in distresses for Christ's
[1:44:03] sake. For when I am weak, then am I
[1:44:06] strong. Why, church? How did he get the
[1:44:08] flesh out of the way? He recognized it
[1:44:11] had nothing to profit in the first
[1:44:12] place.
[1:44:16] He realized that the trying was the
[1:44:17] thing that he needed to stop doing.
[1:44:22] Paul's prayer was based on the fact that
[1:44:24] his issue in his body, they believe he
[1:44:26] had an eye problem. He couldn't see very
[1:44:27] well. Okay? And he was praying because
[1:44:30] he said, "Lord, this is holding back my
[1:44:32] ministry." Was it holding back his
[1:44:34] ministry? Absolutely, church. If you
[1:44:37] can't see, it holds you back in every
[1:44:38] aspect of your life pretty much. So,
[1:44:40] yes, it was holding him back. But if we
[1:44:42] look at the Bible, did it keep him from
[1:44:45] completing his job? No. So it was it was
[1:44:50] an it was a nuisance
[1:44:53] but it had no power over him.
[1:44:56] It was there. It was a daily struggle
[1:45:00] but it never stopped Paul from getting
[1:45:02] the job done. Okay?
[1:45:06] Why? Because the weakness of Paul
[1:45:09] doesn't stop the strength of God.
[1:45:12] That's what we're looking for. My
[1:45:15] strength will never get me where I need
[1:45:16] to go.
[1:45:18] I'm better off being weak and let the
[1:45:20] power of God work in me to get the job
[1:45:22] done. And we look at Paul, whether he's
[1:45:24] on the road, whether he's being
[1:45:25] shipwrecked, whether he's in prison,
[1:45:27] where he whether he's in freedom,
[1:45:28] whether he's in Arabia, whether he's in
[1:45:30] Jerusalem, it doesn't matter. Wherever
[1:45:32] Paul is, church, he's getting his job
[1:45:34] done regardless of his condition. Amen.
[1:45:40] What was it? It was the weakness of Paul
[1:45:43] that allowed God to use him yet more
[1:45:45] mightily.
[1:45:47] And what did it do church? It increased
[1:45:49] Paul's testimony.
[1:45:52] That if I can do it as nearly blind,
[1:45:56] anyone can do it. Our limitation is not
[1:45:59] God's limitation. Our power does not
[1:46:02] dominate. It is taken out of the
[1:46:04] equation so that his power can reign
[1:46:06] supreme in our lives. Amen. Sometimes
[1:46:09] the issue we have is the same as Paul's
[1:46:12] is we're saying, "God, make me more
[1:46:14] able."
[1:46:16] And God's saying, "How about you let me
[1:46:18] do it for you? How about you let me open
[1:46:21] the door? How about you let me make the
[1:46:24] way? How about how about you let me give
[1:46:26] you the patience, the strength, the
[1:46:29] tenacity, the commitment, whatever it is
[1:46:31] we're need, it may be health."
[1:46:36] How about saying, "Lord, work beyond the
[1:46:38] health.
[1:46:40] Lord, work beyond my mental weakness.
[1:46:43] Lord, work beyond the things that drag
[1:46:45] me down day by day."
[1:46:47] And say, "Lord, I'm looking for you to
[1:46:49] be able, not for me to be able."
[1:46:53] See, we want to be part of what's
[1:46:55] happening. And that's not a bad thing.
[1:46:56] But the power has to be through him, not
[1:46:58] through me. The power has to be him, not
[1:47:01] through you. Amen. We want God to make
[1:47:04] us strong rather than God to be strong
[1:47:06] in us.
[1:47:08] That's never going to work. Amen. We
[1:47:10] want to know rather than letting God's
[1:47:13] wisdom stand and just following him in
[1:47:16] simple obedience. Amen. Brother Brown
[1:47:19] would say this. He says one of the most
[1:47:22] one of the important things we must
[1:47:24] master. Then he says, "Now remember
[1:47:26] this, and especially you young preachers
[1:47:28] and lay members alike, I like that
[1:47:30] church." What's he doing? He's telling
[1:47:32] you, you and me, we're on the same
[1:47:33] plane. There's no difference here. We're
[1:47:36] all fighting the same battles. We still
[1:47:37] got the same issues. We're still in
[1:47:39] flawed flesh. Amen. We're all fighting
[1:47:41] the same battle from the pulpit to the
[1:47:43] back door.
[1:47:45] He says, "Now lay members alike." He
[1:47:47] says, "If there's one thing that we've
[1:47:49] got to master if we expect to fulfill
[1:47:52] God's desire in our life, how many want
[1:47:54] to fulfill God's desire in their life?"
[1:47:57] Here's your answer. He says, "We must,
[1:48:00] we have to what? We've got to master the
[1:48:02] thought of human ability.
[1:48:07] In other words, that you're going to get
[1:48:08] it done or I'm get it done because we
[1:48:11] have this ability built into us to do it
[1:48:13] in the first place. I've said it before,
[1:48:16] if we could, we'd have already done it.
[1:48:18] But we can't. He says, "If we ever get
[1:48:22] to a spot where we think that we can do
[1:48:24] it with our own intelligence and our own
[1:48:26] abilities, we've got to master that in
[1:48:29] such a way that we can get rid of the
[1:48:30] thing and lay it aside so that God can
[1:48:33] use us." That's right. He says, "And
[1:48:35] make a complete surrender."
[1:48:38] We're talking about getting the flesh
[1:48:39] out of the equation.
[1:48:41] And the hardest thing with this is when
[1:48:43] you have gifts. If you don't have gifts,
[1:48:45] if you don't have abilities, there's not
[1:48:46] much to lay down. But you got to lay it
[1:48:48] all down nonetheless. But if you do, you
[1:48:50] lay it down. And if he picks it up,
[1:48:52] that's on him. Just make sure I'm not
[1:48:55] the one picking it up. He says, "And
[1:48:57] make a complete surrender." We cannot
[1:48:59] use one ability. We've got to make a
[1:49:03] complete surrender.
[1:49:05] He says, "And to come to God, you've got
[1:49:07] to surrender to him. Soul, body, and
[1:49:10] spirit. Everything that you are has to
[1:49:12] be surrendered to God in order that he
[1:49:14] can work his will in you and in me." He
[1:49:16] says, "Now that's hard." I know. Is it
[1:49:19] hard? Is it hard to lay your career in
[1:49:22] his hands,
[1:49:24] church? I have done that my entire life.
[1:49:28] It's funny. I um I use a particular
[1:49:30] software and they sent me a survey today
[1:49:33] and they they asked me to fill it out
[1:49:34] and and offer me a $10 Amazon gift card
[1:49:37] if I would. So, I said, "Okay, I'll do
[1:49:38] that."
[1:49:39] And it was very in-depth because they're
[1:49:41] wanting to know what professionals do
[1:49:44] and what they believe and what they're
[1:49:46] seeking for and what they're trying to
[1:49:47] do. And they had all these things they
[1:49:49] wanted you to rank what's important and
[1:49:50] what's not important.
[1:49:52] And so they had in there uh you know
[1:49:55] building professional connections
[1:49:58] to ensure that you have a a strong
[1:50:01] career.
[1:50:03] Not at all important
[1:50:06] doesn't matter to me. Okay, they talked
[1:50:10] about ambition. Not important. Why?
[1:50:12] Because that's not going to get me
[1:50:14] anything except in trouble.
[1:50:16] But what I have found is if I will do
[1:50:18] what he wants me to do, he'll raise me
[1:50:21] as high as I can handle.
[1:50:25] That's it.
[1:50:27] They they have this thing called the the
[1:50:28] Peter principle, which is you you you go
[1:50:31] as high as you can fail and then you
[1:50:33] stay. Well, really what you need to do
[1:50:35] is go one level down from where you're
[1:50:36] failing because that was the last thing
[1:50:38] you could do in your job. But let me
[1:50:40] tell you, with my ambition, it'll take
[1:50:42] me all the way to failure.
[1:50:45] But if I can do what he wants, he'll
[1:50:47] take me exactly where I need to go to
[1:50:50] hold my life in balance, to hold my
[1:50:51] family in balance, to hold my finance in
[1:50:53] balance, he'll keep me content there.
[1:50:56] Everything I have need of is if I will
[1:50:58] just lay that ambition over to him.
[1:51:00] I'm sure somebody over there when they
[1:51:02] look over that result is going to be
[1:51:03] very confused because I have competing
[1:51:05] things because for me I I I have a a
[1:51:08] strong um uh focus on on financial
[1:51:10] well-being. I like to manage my money
[1:51:13] well. I don't like to waste money. I
[1:51:14] like to stay on budget. I like to do all
[1:51:16] of these things. And so I have that as a
[1:51:17] high priority, but then my ambition is
[1:51:19] low. And they're probably saying, "This
[1:51:20] guy's going to have problems." But I
[1:51:23] don't because one has nothing to do with
[1:51:26] the other.
[1:51:27] And I should probably be letting go of
[1:51:29] some of the the financial things as
[1:51:31] well. It's not that I don't, but I'm
[1:51:34] just trying to say there are things that
[1:51:35] we don't have to worry about. We don't
[1:51:37] have to fight for. We don't have to
[1:51:38] struggle for cuz God provides those as
[1:51:41] much as we have need of it. And I've
[1:51:43] seen it in the I've seen the lives of
[1:51:44] many of us where God at the drop of a
[1:51:47] hat will make a change in your life that
[1:51:48] gives you exactly what you need at the
[1:51:50] moment you need it.
[1:51:53] He says, "But that's hard. I know cuz
[1:51:54] we're always wanting to put our part in
[1:51:57] something. We know we know that we want
[1:51:59] to do it. It's this isn't a bad thing.
[1:52:01] It's not like we're trying to take over.
[1:52:03] It's just that we want to be involved.
[1:52:05] If you got a heart for God, you want to
[1:52:08] do something. I believe that's what he's
[1:52:10] talking about here. You got a heart to
[1:52:12] do something for God. But he says, we
[1:52:14] say, "Well, I just know it should be
[1:52:16] done this way." Now, that's where
[1:52:17] stubbornness comes in.
[1:52:19] He says, "But as long as you're doing it
[1:52:21] that way, it's going to be wrong. And
[1:52:26] God will never use that effort."
[1:52:32] Paul came to the place where he said,
[1:52:33] "God, I'm going to praise you all the
[1:52:36] more because it doesn't matter what
[1:52:38] condition I'm in, where I'm at, whether
[1:52:41] I'm in the sea cuz I'm shipwrecked cuz
[1:52:43] whether I'm shaken off a snake cuz I
[1:52:45] finally got onto land, whether I'm in
[1:52:47] chains, whether I'm in prison, whether
[1:52:49] I'm free, whether I'm in the sand,
[1:52:50] whether I'm in the water, it doesn't
[1:52:52] matter. Wherever I go, you use me." And
[1:52:55] you get the job done through this broken
[1:52:57] vessel. Despite everything that I could
[1:53:00] I could hinder it with, you still get
[1:53:02] the job done. How? Crucify the flesh
[1:53:05] daily. That's all he's doing. Amen.
[1:53:10] Paul's sitting there, you know, he says,
[1:53:11] "I've written this large letter
[1:53:15] there." They say it's because the letter
[1:53:16] was big because he had to write in such
[1:53:18] big letters because his eyesight was so
[1:53:20] bad. He says, "This one I've written
[1:53:21] with my own hand." A lot of Paul's
[1:53:23] letters he didn't write himself. He had
[1:53:24] a scribe there to help him out. And
[1:53:25] he'll sometimes he'll name that man that
[1:53:27] did it for him. But Paul comes to the
[1:53:29] place, remember, so he's got this
[1:53:31] problem in his body. He's got this flaw
[1:53:32] with his eyesight. And yet Paul comes to
[1:53:34] the place where he says, "I can do all
[1:53:35] things through Christ who strengthens
[1:53:37] me.
[1:53:39] He still uses me. He still gets the job
[1:53:42] done even with my weaknesses." I say
[1:53:45] hallelujah this evening that he can use
[1:53:47] an old stubborn mule like me to preach
[1:53:49] the word.
[1:53:51] They can use some of you in ways that
[1:53:54] before you never could have been used.
[1:53:56] And yet here you are as a blessing to
[1:53:58] the body of Jesus Christ today. Why?
[1:54:01] Because you've laid it down and you've
[1:54:04] let him flow through you.
[1:54:07] Some in the most simplest of ways.
[1:54:10] And yet it's still the absolute power of
[1:54:11] God working in your life to be a
[1:54:14] blessing, to be a help to the body of
[1:54:16] Christ. And then we're preaching on
[1:54:18] absolute power. And the key we're seeing
[1:54:19] is that we've got no part to play.
[1:54:21] Strengths and weaknesses do not enter
[1:54:23] into it. See, we think strengths should
[1:54:25] be in it and then we say think then we
[1:54:27] think that our weaknesses would keep us
[1:54:28] out of it. No. One doesn't get us in and
[1:54:31] one doesn't keep us out. They are both
[1:54:33] of no value to God.
[1:54:35] That's not what's getting us there. It's
[1:54:37] when we surrender and lay down and we
[1:54:39] say, "Lord, just use me as you can and
[1:54:42] as you will." That's when we're going to
[1:54:43] get the results in these things. But our
[1:54:46] strength and our power comes from one
[1:54:47] thing. It's based on an absolute that
[1:54:50] was before we ever were and that will
[1:54:53] continue for eternity.
[1:54:55] I want to read again from that CSB
[1:54:57] version of the Bible. It says, "God
[1:54:58] isn't a man that he would lie or a human
[1:55:01] being that he would change his mind. Has
[1:55:04] he ever spoken and not done it or
[1:55:06] promised and not fulfilled it?" Amen.
[1:55:10] That's our anchor. That's our absolute.
[1:55:12] That's our power this evening is that we
[1:55:14] know that his word can't fail. Two
[1:55:16] quotes as we close. Brother Bram says,
[1:55:18] "I'm tied to the ultimate." He says,
[1:55:20] "That's the end of all strife."
[1:55:23] You're fighting tonight. You're dealing
[1:55:26] with the situation.
[1:55:28] Got you all worked up. Got you all
[1:55:29] worked down. Beat down. Beat up.
[1:55:33] Isn't that funny how English works? You
[1:55:34] can be beat up and beat down and it
[1:55:36] means the same thing.
[1:55:39] going through the mill
[1:55:43] all topsyturvy, twisted up and spit out.
[1:55:46] He says, "That's the end of all strife.
[1:55:48] Find your place in the word. Find what
[1:55:51] God said about it." He says, "I'm tied
[1:55:52] to it." He says, "That's my life." He
[1:55:55] says, "I was a sinner when Christ saved
[1:55:57] me and I met something and since that
[1:55:59] came into me, it's been different. I'm
[1:56:01] tied to it. Everything that I am is tied
[1:56:03] right there." And then God separating
[1:56:06] his life and let me live in him and him
[1:56:09] and me. He says, "Then we're tied." See,
[1:56:11] this is where we're going for the next
[1:56:12] service. He says, "It's you and me. Me
[1:56:16] and you." Oh, you're a part of the
[1:56:18] absolute.
[1:56:21] That's the revelation. This is you are a
[1:56:22] part of the absolute, but you're a part.
[1:56:27] You're a part.
[1:56:30] But it's it's better to be a part than
[1:56:32] not a part. Let me tell you that for
[1:56:34] sure. You're a part of the absolute.
[1:56:37] It's Christ in you and you in Christ. He
[1:56:40] says it doesn't matter. Doesn't make any
[1:56:43] differences what others want to believe.
[1:56:45] To the individual, you are tied to that
[1:56:47] word church. This church is not going in
[1:56:49] a rapture. Individuals are going in a
[1:56:53] rapture. He says that's your ultimate.
[1:56:57] That's the last word. And then if he is
[1:56:59] the word, then this must be the last
[1:57:01] word. This must settle it. He's talking
[1:57:03] about his Bible. He taps on it there. I
[1:57:05] took that out. He says, "Whatever that
[1:57:07] says, that's that scarlet thread. That
[1:57:10] is Christ. And anything contrary to
[1:57:13] that, I know nothing about it." He says,
[1:57:17] "That's what we want to know is what
[1:57:19] this word says. For I am tied to Christ
[1:57:22] and Christ is the word." Amen. God bless
[1:57:25] you. Let's stand. You know, I find this
[1:57:30] I know I keep saying it simple,
[1:57:33] but the principles of the Christian walk
[1:57:35] are simple. And the principle of the
[1:57:37] Christian walk is this. You take the
[1:57:40] word, you believe the word, you act on
[1:57:44] the word, you become the word. That's
[1:57:47] the principle. You hear it, you believe
[1:57:49] it, you act on it, you become of it.
[1:57:52] Amen. If you act on the word of God,
[1:57:54] then the word of God will do what it
[1:57:55] says it will do. Amen. You know, many
[1:57:57] times we're praying and we should. Many
[1:58:00] times we're believing and we should, but
[1:58:03] we stop there instead of acting on what
[1:58:05] we're praying for and believing for. We
[1:58:08] don't talk. We don't confess. We don't
[1:58:10] testify about it. Amen. If we try, if we
[1:58:13] truly believe, we need to act on what we
[1:58:16] believe. Amen. We need to speak on it
[1:58:19] every day. Now, I'm not talking about
[1:58:20] saying words every day, though we ought
[1:58:22] to. I believe we ought to say what the
[1:58:24] word says. Amen. But sometimes our
[1:58:26] attitude is the real testimony.
[1:58:29] Sometimes our attitude really shows, do
[1:58:30] I believe or do I not believe?
[1:58:33] It really shows what influence we're
[1:58:34] under right now. And whether the flesh
[1:58:37] is winning because Satan's trying to
[1:58:38] beat us up through the flesh, or whether
[1:58:40] the soul is winning because the spirit
[1:58:41] is working out through the word. Amen.
[1:58:43] The way we handle things, the way we
[1:58:45] keep moving forward, the way we press
[1:58:46] on, the way we can stay cheerful and
[1:58:48] content even when it's not going the way
[1:58:50] we want it to go. Even when it's not
[1:58:52] going the way the word says it's going
[1:58:53] to go. Remember Abraham against all hope
[1:58:56] believed in hope. Ignoring those things
[1:58:59] that were, he confessed those things
[1:59:01] that were not as if they were
[1:59:04] and was mighty in God in faith. Our
[1:59:08] attitude is our greatest testimony. I
[1:59:11] find we can say a lot of things because
[1:59:14] as believers, we know the right words,
[1:59:16] but our attitude will show whether we
[1:59:18] really believe those words and whether
[1:59:19] we're tied to those things. Amen. I say
[1:59:22] tonight, let's let our attitude speak.
[1:59:25] Amen. Speak the right words. I'm not
[1:59:26] saying not to, but let's let our
[1:59:28] attitude speak as to where we're at,
[1:59:30] what we believe, what we've confessed,
[1:59:33] where we're at with the word of God.
[1:59:34] Amen. I say, God, let our attitudes
[1:59:36] reflect what we say,
[1:59:39] not just our words. Amen. Let's bow our
[1:59:41] heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:59:46] Lord, I am so thankful you provided a
[1:59:49] way, Lord, to take this flesh out of the
[1:59:51] equation,
[1:59:53] Lord, that we could come, Lord, not just
[1:59:56] in strength, but we could come in
[1:59:58] weakness,
[1:59:59] Lord, in any condition. And if we will
[2:00:02] surrender to you, you can use us. Not
[2:00:05] just you can use us, Lord, but you said
[2:00:06] you would use us, Lord. you'd use us to
[2:00:09] be Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[2:00:12] today, and forever to this world today,
[2:00:16] Lord. We're looking to be used,
[2:00:19] Lord. And that means we've got to stop
[2:00:20] trying.
[2:00:22] Stop trying to use, Lord, and start
[2:00:25] letting go and letting us be used,
[2:00:28] Lord. I pray your grace to help us,
[2:00:31] Lord. We do so many different things in
[2:00:32] our lives, Lord. We have different
[2:00:34] responsibilities. is we've got different
[2:00:36] things that take our time and our
[2:00:37] attention and our energy.
[2:00:40] Lord, I pray you help us be surrendered
[2:00:42] to your purpose and your will, Lord. And
[2:00:45] when we inevitably come up against a
[2:00:46] wall, against a mountain, against a door
[2:00:49] that doesn't want to open, against an
[2:00:51] enemy that doesn't want to back up,
[2:00:54] Lord, I pray you give us strength to
[2:00:55] stand there.
[2:00:57] Stand there and say, "I'm not backing
[2:01:00] up.
[2:01:01] Greater is he that's in me than he
[2:01:03] that's in the world. I can do all things
[2:01:05] through Christ that strengthens me,
[2:01:07] Lord, and to not lay our sword down,
[2:01:09] Lord, but to just hold it high and go to
[2:01:11] hacking, Lord. To take the word, the
[2:01:14] absolute that you've given us, that
[2:01:16] undefeated word, Lord, and to hold it
[2:01:18] fast in our hands, Lord, until we see
[2:01:21] victory on the other side, Lord. Help us
[2:01:23] to have an overcomer's attitude,
[2:01:26] Lord. That victory is on the horizon,
[2:01:29] Lord. That when we can't see it, it's
[2:01:31] still there, Lord. It is as inevitable,
[2:01:34] Lord, as the sun rising as in the
[2:01:36] morning. Lord, I pray you bless your
[2:01:38] people, Lord. Encourage us, strengthen
[2:01:40] us, Lord. Give us the right attitude
[2:01:42] tonight and into the moral, Lord, as we
[2:01:45] face these difficult times, Lord. This
[2:01:47] world that's so dark, trying to suppress
[2:01:49] us, Lord, trying to beat us up, trying
[2:01:51] to shake us down, Lord, trying to tear
[2:01:53] us apart, trying to make us doubt. Lord,
[2:01:55] I pray we feed on the right things.
[2:01:57] Lord, keep us from temptation. Deliver
[2:01:59] us from evil, Lord, for yours is
[2:02:01] certainly the power,
[2:02:04] Lord, but you've given it to us this
[2:02:05] evening that we could go forth and
[2:02:07] conquer. Be with us, Lord. Strengthen
[2:02:10] us, we pray. In Jesus Christ's name we
[2:02:12] ask it. Amen.
[2:02:15] Amen. I've only got one song. By his
[2:02:17] word, 1260.
