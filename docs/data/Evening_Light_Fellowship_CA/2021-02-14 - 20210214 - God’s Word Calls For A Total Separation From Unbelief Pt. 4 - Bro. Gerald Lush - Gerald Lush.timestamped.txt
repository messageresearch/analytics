[41:34] and that was believers i'm not sure
[41:36] whether it's in china or in russia
[41:38] but they had pictures of them there and

[41:48] and into the wilderness and but it was a
[41:51] rainy day

[43:56] and uh and they came in to
[43:59] witness the services to witness the
[44:01] meetings and to hear the word
[44:03] and i remember that something that was
[44:05] preached
[44:06] struck him and well i guess they had
[44:09] never heard anything like that before
[44:11] and i was talking about solomon's
[44:14] rededication of the temple
[44:16] and i said oh they had this many sheep
[44:19] this many goats this many of this
[44:21] there's many of that
[44:22] and there were thousands i said that
[44:24] they that they sacrificed
[44:26] for the rededication of the temple and
[44:30] i said i'm not sure what the group was
[44:32] back then that was fighting the
[44:34] newfoundland
[44:35] new flanders out there trying to catch
[44:36] seals and they stopped
[44:38] and they of course they stopped it so
[44:40] now they're not allowed to go and catch
[44:41] seals
[44:42] but there was a certain group in
[44:44] newfoundland and maybe part around the
[44:46] world
[44:47] you know and uh they we're fighting it
[44:50] and i said well
[44:51] i said it's a good good thing i said
[44:53] that they weren't there when solomon i
[44:55] said dedicated
[44:56] the template rededicated the temple
[44:57] again they would fight that for sure
[45:00] and say that they wouldn't they're not
[45:02] allowed to sacrifice these sheep
[45:04] not allowed to do this not allowed to do
[45:05] that but thank god

[53:01] amen praise the lord god bless you turn
[53:03] with me to the book of genesis
[53:05] chapter 13.
[53:08] amen god bless you
[53:11] praise the lord
[53:16] genesis chapter 13 and i want to share
[53:18] with you some thoughts
[53:21] that the prophet god has brought to us
[53:25] in a message entitled god's word
[53:29] we're going to read the word and god's
[53:31] word calls
[53:33] for a total separation
[53:36] amen from unbelief
[53:40] and the prophet god highlights it with
[53:42] the scriptures in genesis 13
[53:44] the situation with abraham and lot
[53:48] amen and now that god had to bring a
[53:51] separation between abraham and lot
[53:53] to bring abraham to the promise amen
[53:57] of the land that he was to give abraham
[53:59] and to his seed
[54:01] but not to lot it is to the true seed of
[54:04] abraham that believe god
[54:05] it is to throw seed of abraham that
[54:07] trusts god
[54:08] that put their absolute confidence in
[54:10] god amen
[54:12] again it's not again it wasn't abraham
[54:14] that was living it was god in abraham
[54:17] amen was god with abraham praise the
[54:19] lord oh brother that's
[54:20] that's just not in the new testament
[54:22] that rather you go back to the old
[54:24] testament
[54:25] and it was it was god with this one it
[54:26] was god with that one god in this one
[54:28] god with that one amen
[54:29] so i trust we have the same testimony
[54:32] that again is not you and me living
[54:33] it's not you and me responding here it's
[54:36] god amen is christ in us the hope of
[54:38] glory
[54:39] amen it was it was christ with abraham
[54:42] amen
[54:43] and we know that abraham when god called
[54:45] him out
[54:46] from among his people god called him out
[54:50] not just the town he lived in not just
[54:51] the country he lived in
[54:52] but he had to separate from the people
[54:55] amen why
[54:56] because god wanted to deal with abraham
[54:58] and god wants to deal with you and me
[55:01] so so so that it's not going to be
[55:03] interfered
[55:04] with you know we're all this one got our
[55:06] attention that one got our attention
[55:07] that was looking for this looking for
[55:09] that no
[55:10] all god separates us so that's our our
[55:12] concentration is on him
[55:14] our concentration is on his word our
[55:15] concentration is on lord
[55:17] what what do you want to do amen lord
[55:20] just
[55:21] grab me the revelation of your will how
[55:23] do you want me to do this where
[55:24] when and so on oh my so god called
[55:27] abraham
[55:28] out but when he came out well he should
[55:31] have come out just with him and his and
[55:33] his immediate
[55:34] family but he was influenced
[55:37] some way you know a lot came with him
[55:39] and not a lot but his father
[55:41] even his father and and god separated
[55:46] and remember god never spoke after he
[55:48] come out god never spoke to him
[55:50] until his father left
[55:53] and went back amen and yet well yet
[55:56] still god never never gave abraham what
[55:58] he wanted to give abraham
[55:59] still god never revealed to abraham what
[56:01] he wanted to reveal to him
[56:03] the what god had promised what god in
[56:04] his mind that he was going to do with
[56:06] abraham
[56:07] and boy because lot was there so god had
[56:10] to separate
[56:10] lot from abraham and abraham from lot
[56:12] amen praise
[56:14] i trusted amen just to show that we are
[56:16] abraham's seed
[56:17] i wonder if we would if we would make
[56:20] the
[56:20] the choices that abraham made if we were
[56:23] just like abraham gave lot to the the
[56:25] pre
[56:26] or you do this lot whatever you want you
[56:29] do and
[56:30] and he said if you go down there i'll
[56:32] stay here if i go down
[56:33] if you stay here i'll go down there and
[56:35] so on praise the lord
[56:37] so brother i trust that we're going to
[56:38] give god the the preeminence
[56:40] amen not this not that not what i want
[56:43] it's what jesus wants
[56:44] it's what god wants in me and this is
[56:47] this is what god was dealing with in
[56:48] abraham
[56:49] was his was god's will not abraham's
[56:52] will
[56:52] not lot's will not his father's will god
[56:55] oh my
[56:56] when they come out he had to wait till
[56:58] oh it's
[56:59] god never talked to him until his father
[57:01] was gone amen
[57:02] and god still never confirmed to abraham
[57:05] the promise
[57:06] until lot separated oh yeah so brother
[57:09] sometimes that
[57:10] oh there might be this one that we got
[57:12] to too close to fellowship with
[57:13] we got too close to this too close to
[57:15] that we're giving them too much
[57:16] preeminence
[57:17] no no you've got to come to where it's
[57:19] you and god
[57:20] amen you and god that's walking talking
[57:23] living
[57:23] amen it's just you and god god in
[57:26] control
[57:27] amen whether whether in your job whether
[57:29] it's in your home whether it's
[57:30] uh just in in the world in the town
[57:33] you're in in general
[57:34] well it's got to be god in control
[57:35] you're not going to be influenced by
[57:37] this one this one this one
[57:38] no no you're influenced by god amen by
[57:41] the
[57:41] and so god had wait till abraham was
[57:44] totally separated
[57:45] and then god will speak to you god will
[57:48] give you what you need
[57:49] god will give you the revelation need oh
[57:51] yeah because
[57:52] that can interfere with the revelation
[57:55] because if
[57:56] we're too too united with this to too
[57:58] much contact with that
[57:59] then god god can't do what he wants to
[58:01] do in your life so i pray grace in the
[58:03] name of jesus
[58:04] that we'll be totally separated unto the
[58:06] lord amen that god is that real
[58:09] that god is more real to us amen than
[58:11] the physical
[58:12] amen all right guys brother god i pray
[58:15] grace
[58:16] god become more real to to abraham's
[58:18] seed us
[58:19] amen than to the natural seed grace to
[58:22] us
[58:24] amen so i want to share with you the
[58:26] scripture that brother branham
[58:27] read to preach the message god's word
[58:30] calls
[58:31] for a total separation total separation
[58:34] from unbelief oh well well uh
[58:37] unbelief is just that spirit there oh
[58:39] you know sometimes that unbelief is a
[58:41] spirit
[58:41] in this one or in that one it's somebody
[58:43] else you know it could be
[58:45] individuals it could be this church or
[58:46] that church but god's
[58:48] calls for a total separation from it
[58:50] amen
[58:51] so it doesn't control you not going to
[58:54] interfere with what god
[58:55] wants to reveal to you not an interfere
[58:57] with the faith that god wants to
[58:59] find in you and me amen so grace to us
[59:03] five four here and those online
[59:07] amen we never ever dreamed i guess we
[59:09] come to this place
[59:11] but it's gonna get worse amen oh it's
[59:13] definitely gonna get worse
[59:14] so you better make sure that you have
[59:16] faith amen
[59:18] and the faith is in your heart not in
[59:20] your head
[59:21] amen and in genesis
[59:26] 13
[59:31] in genesis 12 he did say the lord said
[59:33] unto abram
[59:35] get thee out of thy country amen
[59:38] and from thy kindred and
[59:41] from thy father's house onto a land that
[59:44] i
[59:44] will show thee look at the promise of
[59:47] god
[59:47] and he said i will make of thee a great
[59:50] nation
[59:51] and i will bless thee and make thy name
[59:54] great
[59:55] and thou shalt be a blessing amen and
[59:58] god has given us a promise to be the
[59:59] bride of the lord jesus christ
[1:00:01] to sit with him in his throne amen to
[1:00:04] partake with him of the marriage supper
[1:00:06] of the lamb
[1:00:07] amen so brother has god called abraham
[1:00:10] totally separated from unbelief
[1:00:11] so god is calling after a total
[1:00:14] separation of non-belief in your life
[1:00:16] and in mine don't think oh as jesus did
[1:00:18] this jesus did that
[1:00:20] yeah well he did it so it's bring us
[1:00:22] into a greater separation
[1:00:23] amen praise the lord and he said i will
[1:00:27] bless them that bless
[1:00:28] thee and curse him that curseth thee
[1:00:32] and in thee shall all families of the
[1:00:35] earth
[1:00:35] be blessed amen and abraham
[1:00:38] departed as the lord had spoken unto him
[1:00:42] but it says and lot went with him
[1:00:45] but not that he called it a lot but lot
[1:00:48] saw what was going on saw what he was
[1:00:50] doing amen he must have recognized
[1:00:52] something in abraham
[1:00:54] he wanted to be part of it yeah no
[1:00:57] so god would bring a separation between
[1:00:59] abraham and lot
[1:01:01] and in genesis 13
[1:01:04] and abraham went up out of egypt
[1:01:08] he and his wife and all that he had
[1:01:11] and lot was with him into the south
[1:01:15] and abraham was very rich in cattle
[1:01:19] in silver and in gold abram
[1:01:22] not abraham amen but brother we come to
[1:01:26] the place where
[1:01:27] like abraham our name changed praise the
[1:01:30] lord
[1:01:31] and he went on his journeys from the
[1:01:33] south
[1:01:34] even to bethel onto the place where his
[1:01:37] tent
[1:01:37] had been at the beginning between bethel
[1:01:40] and hai
[1:01:42] unto the place of the altar which he had
[1:01:44] made
[1:01:45] there at the first and there abram
[1:01:49] called on the name of the lord
[1:01:51] hallelujah
[1:01:53] god's grace that will not lose
[1:01:55] revelation
[1:01:56] amen of our fellowship with god
[1:02:00] and lot also which went with abram
[1:02:03] at flocks and herds and tents
[1:02:06] and the land was not able to bear them
[1:02:09] that they might dwell together for their
[1:02:13] substance
[1:02:13] was great so that they could not dwell
[1:02:16] together and god permitted it
[1:02:18] god allowed it amen what for to bring
[1:02:21] separation
[1:02:23] amen and god allows things in your life
[1:02:26] and in our lives amen
[1:02:27] to us here to those online god allows
[1:02:30] things to what for
[1:02:31] oh lord why is this why is that he wants
[1:02:33] to bring a greater separation
[1:02:35] amen because we got to be totally
[1:02:39] separated
[1:02:40] amen and that's the nasa message he
[1:02:42] preached
[1:02:43] he calls for not separation he calls for
[1:02:46] a total separation
[1:02:48] from unbelief amen god don't want as the
[1:02:51] problem god said be careful
[1:02:53] he said you can go and have so
[1:02:55] fellowship with this one fellowship with
[1:02:56] that one
[1:02:57] and he said their spirit can get on you
[1:02:58] but your spirit won't get on them
[1:03:01] amen amen because they resist the death
[1:03:04] resist the lord
[1:03:05] amen but satan is there to influence
[1:03:08] amen god has prayed grace
[1:03:10] amen we're going to recognize his
[1:03:12] leadership when it comes to separation
[1:03:14] amen don't go by your emotions don't go
[1:03:17] by your feelings you go by your faith
[1:03:19] amen god wants to do this god wants to
[1:03:21] do that
[1:03:22] let's trust the lord amen
[1:03:27] and lord also which went with abram had
[1:03:30] flocks and herds and tents
[1:03:32] and the land was not able to bear them
[1:03:34] that they might dwell together
[1:03:36] for their substance was great so that
[1:03:39] they could not dwell together
[1:03:41] and there was a strife between the
[1:03:43] herdman of abram's cattle
[1:03:45] and the herdmen of lot's cattle and the
[1:03:48] canaanite
[1:03:49] and the perizzite dwell in
[1:03:52] the land and abram said unto lot

[1:04:00] between me and thee your spirit's gonna
[1:04:03] be right
[1:04:04] amen but you encourage them to keep

[1:04:12] and between my herdmen and thy heard me
[1:04:16] for we be brethren and he said is not
[1:04:19] the whole land before thee
[1:04:21] amen
[1:04:25] he said separate thyself i pray thee
[1:04:27] from me
[1:04:28] and if thou wilt take the left
[1:04:31] and then i will go to the right
[1:04:35] and and then i will go to the left
[1:04:40] if thou depart to the right then i will
[1:04:42] go to the left
[1:04:44] and lot lifted up his ice and beheld
[1:04:48] all the plane of jordan that it was well
[1:04:52] watered everywhere before the lord
[1:04:55] destroyed sodom and gomorrah
[1:04:57] even as the garden of the lord he said
[1:05:00] like the land of egypt as thou comest
[1:05:03] into zore
[1:05:05] amen and brother the enemy is there to
[1:05:08] get you to

[1:05:15] i'll go there no
[1:05:17] you better wait on the lord get his
[1:05:18] leadership amen
[1:05:22] then lot chose him all the plain of
[1:05:24] jordan and lot journeyed east
[1:05:26] and they separated themselves the one
[1:05:29] from the other
[1:05:30] amen and abraham dwelled in the land of
[1:05:34] canaan
[1:05:35] and lot dwelled in the cities of the
[1:05:37] plain
[1:05:38] and pitched his tent towards sodom
[1:05:42] don't pitch your life towards sodom amen
[1:05:45] so you're interest you're looking to the
[1:05:46] things of the world
[1:05:48] again it says you love the world or the
[1:05:51] things of the world the love of god's
[1:05:53] not
[1:05:53] in you amen and brother it's not
[1:05:56] necessary love for sinful things
[1:05:58] is love for that which is contrary to
[1:06:00] the will of god for you
[1:06:02] amen oh i want to do this i want to go
[1:06:04] here i want to go there
[1:06:05] oh yeah but no maybe maybe it's not the
[1:06:08] will of god
[1:06:10] find the will of the lord by his grace
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:14] but again people people he saw
[1:06:17] sodom and gomorrah but what he liked was
[1:06:19] the land
[1:06:20] what he loved was was oh my the the the
[1:06:22] richest and the water and everything
[1:06:24] else oh it looked good
[1:06:26] amen that maybe he wouldn't have to do
[1:06:28] much you know for his cattle will do
[1:06:29] much for this too much for that he'll
[1:06:31] get he'll become even
[1:06:32] even more rich and wealthy if i do it
[1:06:35] this way
[1:06:36] yeah but again he did he wasn't seeking
[1:06:39] the will of god
[1:06:40] it was his will amen and brother
[1:06:43] if you're a christian if you're a
[1:06:45] believer if you're a bride
[1:06:46] you just you're focusing on the will of
[1:06:48] god amen
[1:06:50] if god wants you to have a lot of
[1:06:52] finances he'll do it
[1:06:53] and if he doesn't he'll take he'll take
[1:06:55] it from you oh yeah
[1:06:57] but people feel no no i got to do this i
[1:06:58] got to do that not
[1:07:00] and not many are going to say not my
[1:07:03] will
[1:07:03] time to be done i'll tell you this the
[1:07:06] bride's going to say it
[1:07:07] amen because we focus on the spiritual
[1:07:10] not the natural by the grace of god amen
[1:07:14] and the lord said unto abram after that
[1:07:17] lot was separated from him
[1:07:19] he lift up lift up now thine eyes and
[1:07:23] look from the place where thou art
[1:07:26] northward and southward and eastward and
[1:07:29] westward amen
[1:07:31] for all the land which thou see is to
[1:07:34] thee will i give it
[1:07:35] and to thy seed forever
[1:07:39] amen god bless you may be seated
[1:07:44] amen and brother brown ministered on
[1:07:47] this that god's word calls for a total
[1:07:49] separation from unbelief
[1:07:50] and god proved it in his word amen
[1:07:54] from genesis to revelation there is the
[1:07:57] call
[1:07:58] for separation
[1:08:01] not partial separation but absolute
[1:08:04] complete separation
[1:08:05] from unbelief so that we're putting
[1:08:07] we're putting our more and more emphasis
[1:08:09] not on the
[1:08:10] natural part of our lives but on the
[1:08:12] spiritual
[1:08:13] amen because the natural passes away
[1:08:16] but the spiritual goes on to eternity so
[1:08:19] i'm praying god
[1:08:20] by grace will find that total separation
[1:08:24] in you and in me amen that you'll find
[1:08:26] in you and me
[1:08:27] that spirit that anointing that's
[1:08:29] looking for that separation
[1:08:31] amen that wants that separation is more
[1:08:33] than willing
[1:08:34] amen to enter into god's call to total
[1:08:37] separation
[1:08:38] amen and it's it's go let god do the
[1:08:41] work in you not you make the decisions
[1:08:42] let god make them
[1:08:44] and sometimes we think oh that that
[1:08:46] can't be the lord if that was god he
[1:08:47] would do this
[1:08:48] that was god he would do that well but
[1:08:50] you better go back and check it with the
[1:08:52] word
[1:08:52] amen because god god was at a promise
[1:08:56] that he had given to abraham
[1:08:57] and god knew but abram knew too and he
[1:08:59] should have stayed with that word
[1:09:01] not going with family going with this
[1:09:02] going with that amen
[1:09:04] god brought it he separated him from his
[1:09:07] father
[1:09:07] and his natural family separated him
[1:09:09] from lot amen
[1:09:11] and when god separated them amen then
[1:09:13] god called him up into the mountain
[1:09:15] and then god said abraham he said look
[1:09:18] he said look here look here look here
[1:09:20] he said all this he said give to you and
[1:09:22] your seed
[1:09:23] amen it was and a lot lot wasn't
[1:09:25] included in that for sure
[1:09:27] amen because why because god when it
[1:09:30] comes to abraham's seed
[1:09:31] it's a spiritual seed abraham said
[1:09:33] believes god
[1:09:34] abraham say trust god abraham said is
[1:09:37] going to give preeminence to the lord
[1:09:39] amen and they're looking for the will of
[1:09:41] god and not brother not the natural
[1:09:43] things of life the spiritual
[1:09:45] are they getting richer and richer with
[1:09:47] the lord amen
[1:09:48] more and more spiritual with the lord
[1:09:50] amen and less and less caught up with
[1:09:53] the with the natural things
[1:09:54] we're getting caught up more and more
[1:09:55] with the spiritual amen
[1:09:57] and and this is what god wanted abraham
[1:09:59] to put the emphasis on
[1:10:00] and the focus on amen was his
[1:10:03] relationship with god
[1:10:05] amen and the promise that god had made
[1:10:07] input put your focus on on that on the
[1:10:09] word of god
[1:10:10] praise the lord on god's plan and god's
[1:10:13] will for your life
[1:10:15] by the grace of god amen oh brother
[1:10:18] brother we could go through the
[1:10:19] scriptures and we could highlight
[1:10:21] those that god was calling out of their
[1:10:24] own will into
[1:10:24] israel amen and just consider that the
[1:10:28] changes
[1:10:28] that god was making in their lives amen
[1:10:32] and that the influence of god was one
[1:10:34] thing the influence of the devil was
[1:10:36] another
[1:10:36] amen brother and it comes right on down
[1:10:40] from genesis right on down to revelation
[1:10:42] amen we're a god where again jesus went
[1:10:44] in to consider
[1:10:45] the the spiritual seed of abraham oh but
[1:10:48] they were focusing more and more on the
[1:10:50] natural things
[1:10:51] and they did and they said why because
[1:10:53] jesus said oh you see you say
[1:10:55] he said you are rich increased with
[1:10:57] goods and have needed nothing
[1:10:59] oh yeah that was and yet they they felt
[1:11:01] religious
[1:11:02] they felt oh yeah we're the church and
[1:11:05] we're this and we're that and we're
[1:11:06] and because we're we're the seed of god
[1:11:09] oh and the seed of abraham oh we're rich
[1:11:11] and increased with goods and that needed
[1:11:12] nothing
[1:11:12] but brother it wasn't god it was the
[1:11:14] devil amen
[1:11:16] or the satan can bless you like that
[1:11:18] satan can do this they can give you this
[1:11:19] take give you that
[1:11:20] amen he can make you richer make you all
[1:11:22] depends on the will of god
[1:11:24] god but god if you're the seed of god
[1:11:26] god will uh
[1:11:27] he can't do nothing to the seed without
[1:11:29] god's permission
[1:11:30] oh yeah so but sometimes to bring us
[1:11:33] back in line
[1:11:34] like he did with abraham god step back
[1:11:36] and let this happen and this happened
[1:11:38] this happened
[1:11:38] amen why to get us to call on the lord
[1:11:41] again
[1:11:42] amen to let us recognize that we need
[1:11:44] the lord
[1:11:45] by the grace of god amen that's why from
[1:11:48] the beginning
[1:11:49] god's word god himself calls us
[1:11:52] for to a total separation from unbelief
[1:11:56] amen and again the prophet highlights
[1:11:59] are concerning what happened in genesis
[1:12:01] and adam and eve now he said adam could
[1:12:03] have could have could have stayed
[1:12:04] separated
[1:12:05] god adam could have done this could have
[1:12:06] done that but adam did that
[1:12:08] with lot with it with eve rather amen
[1:12:11] but brother but after god came down with
[1:12:15] the promise of redemption
[1:12:17] he's going to do this he's going to do
[1:12:18] that then he called for that total
[1:12:20] separation
[1:12:21] believe what he promised abraham but
[1:12:24] remain stay separated
[1:12:25] amen abram did that to bring up the
[1:12:28] promise of god
[1:12:29] abraham did that to bring up the will of
[1:12:31] god amen and after it was revealed
[1:12:33] god went on to call for total separation
[1:12:36] from unbelief
[1:12:38] and he's still calling for that total
[1:12:40] separation by the grace of god
[1:12:42] amen so he said now he should he said i
[1:12:45] he said i would call it a text he said
[1:12:48] right here in the scriptures
[1:12:49] and he said i wouldn't know whether to
[1:12:51] call it a text or not
[1:12:53] but he said just for a text and i want
[1:12:55] to take this thought
[1:12:56] he said god's word calls for a total
[1:13:00] separation from unbelief
[1:13:02] so are we walking in obedience to that
[1:13:04] part of the word
[1:13:05] amen that god called for a total
[1:13:09] separation on belief here
[1:13:10] god called for a total separation from
[1:13:12] the prophets amen for the god prophet
[1:13:14] our lord jesus christ
[1:13:16] amen and on down to this these last days
[1:13:19] to jesus knocked at the door and he's
[1:13:21] calling you to separate
[1:13:23] he said knock open the door and come
[1:13:25] fellowship with me
[1:13:26] and feast with me and and and i with you
[1:13:29] amen
[1:13:30] by the grace of god so god wanted to get
[1:13:33] abraham separated from the influence
[1:13:35] of those others in his life amen and god
[1:13:39] and god all through the ages have been
[1:13:41] separating the the bride
[1:13:43] from the influence of the natural things
[1:13:46] so that he would have the influence in
[1:13:48] their lives he would have the control of
[1:13:50] their lives
[1:13:51] amen and so he said i'm going to
[1:13:54] preach on it because he said god's word
[1:13:56] calls for a total
[1:13:58] separation from unbelief amen
[1:14:02] but again there are those that are there
[1:14:03] too and and are sincere
[1:14:06] and they honor you and respect you well
[1:14:07] that's good and god will bless and honor
[1:14:10] them
[1:14:10] by the grace of god amen but brother if
[1:14:14] they don't believe
[1:14:15] really sincerely truly believe then
[1:14:18] brother just
[1:14:19] hello goodbye hello nice to see you
[1:14:22] we'll do what you can
[1:14:23] we can for you amen but
[1:14:26] you're more in contact with believers
[1:14:28] than unbelievers
[1:14:30] amen grace of god
[1:14:34] and as he read the scriptures he said
[1:14:35] now he said the thought of god's word
[1:14:38] calling
[1:14:38] a total separation brother one time
[1:14:42] i experienced it and witnessed it down
[1:14:44] through the years
[1:14:45] that there was a total separation from
[1:14:47] unbelief
[1:14:49] there's a total separation from
[1:14:51] unbelievers
[1:14:52] amen and again our spirit was right our
[1:14:55] attitude was right
[1:14:56] but as time went on i began to realize
[1:14:59] that everything was changing
[1:15:00] amen and there was compromise and people
[1:15:02] began to go in and people began to go
[1:15:04] and
[1:15:05] and all get closer to this one closer to
[1:15:07] that one amen
[1:15:08] whereas when they first came to the word
[1:15:10] it was total separation
[1:15:12] their spirit was right their attitude
[1:15:13] was right but then after a few years
[1:15:15] it was compromise amen oh i witnessed it
[1:15:18] in a lot of believers
[1:15:20] and i witnessed the results of it so i
[1:15:22] pray the grace of god
[1:15:24] that brother inaudible if god is going
[1:15:25] to require total separation
[1:15:27] it's going to be now the closer we get
[1:15:29] to the resurrection
[1:15:30] and the rapture amen so that why
[1:15:34] so that to god is in total control amen
[1:15:37] you're totally under the revealed word
[1:15:38] you're going to stay with the word
[1:15:39] you're going to
[1:15:40] focus on the word concentrate on what
[1:15:42] god has done what god is doing
[1:15:44] and what god will do amen and brother
[1:15:46] for god to
[1:15:48] to do it and for god to move on brother
[1:15:50] with it he's got
[1:15:51] you've got to be separated amen he
[1:15:54] wanted he wanted to do this with abraham
[1:15:55] wanted to give
[1:15:56] this to abraham but he had to move his
[1:15:59] father away
[1:16:00] he wanted to do this he had to move lot
[1:16:02] away amen
[1:16:03] praise the name of the lord brother the
[1:16:05] separation that god was
[1:16:07] wanted here god wants here amen
[1:16:11] why he doesn't want the enemy to to
[1:16:13] interfere
[1:16:14] with the word that he's given you to
[1:16:15] give the faith for the rapture
[1:16:18] amen oh yeah the devil's the devil is
[1:16:21] there
[1:16:21] oh yeah this is the message this is the
[1:16:23] message this is the message
[1:16:25] amen but is it bringing the total
[1:16:28] separation that god wants
[1:16:30] so that we're going to focus only on
[1:16:32] what god is doing
[1:16:35] we're going to focus only on what god
[1:16:37] wants us to believe for
[1:16:39] amen like pentecost and all the rest
[1:16:43] when
[1:16:43] when god did this oh they just went in
[1:16:45] and that's all they focused on
[1:16:47] amen whether it's luther or wesley or
[1:16:49] the pentecostals
[1:16:50] amen what god revealed to them that's
[1:16:52] all they focused on
[1:16:54] amen and they kept praising the lord
[1:16:56] well what what what what what
[1:16:57] what are you praising god for oh the
[1:16:59] just shall live by faith thank god amen
[1:17:02] and their lives were wrapped around that
[1:17:04] revelation amen
[1:17:06] and the sanctification amen the baptism
[1:17:08] of the holy ghost the gifts of the
[1:17:09] spirit
[1:17:10] their lives are wrapped around what god
[1:17:12] was doing
[1:17:13] amen but brother but what god did
[1:17:16] was to move him on to what he was going
[1:17:19] to do
[1:17:20] amen but the thing of it is that like i
[1:17:22] said the third or fourth generation
[1:17:24] amen or they got into what god was doing
[1:17:27] but then another generation rose up and
[1:17:29] they were just
[1:17:30] they were just oh that that's what god
[1:17:32] did
[1:17:33] so we thank the lord amen praise the
[1:17:35] lord and they make a denomination out of
[1:17:37] it
[1:17:38] oh we believe this we believe that yeah
[1:17:40] that's our doctrine that's our creed
[1:17:42] and so on amen amen but they
[1:17:45] they they got that intellectually but
[1:17:47] still
[1:17:48] they got the influence of the devil in
[1:17:51] other areas of their life
[1:17:52] satan is there to influence this
[1:17:54] influence that oh yeah oh lord i believe
[1:17:56] your word yeah
[1:17:58] let the word have control amen no
[1:18:01] they feel all i gotta do is believe it
[1:18:03] in my head
[1:18:04] and so on amen and but then the enemy
[1:18:07] comes in and starts to influence
[1:18:09] you he gets you to do this could you do
[1:18:10] that but god don't want it
[1:18:12] amen the enemy was trying to influence
[1:18:14] abraham do this do this do this

[1:18:18] today abraham heir is the law here's the
[1:18:20] promised land

[1:19:04] amen and god got our attention and god
[1:19:07] got our focus on the word but then he
[1:19:09] brought us on up to what he's do what he
[1:19:11] was
[1:19:11] what he's doing amen as the prophet said
[1:19:14] the rapture is already on
[1:19:16] the rapture is going on now he said amen
[1:19:18] praise the lord
[1:19:20] hey oh yeah and he said what god has
[1:19:22] done and the mysteries that god has
[1:19:23] revealed he says to give us rapturing
[1:19:25] faith
[1:19:26] amen what happened to the other
[1:19:28] denominations only a day just went back
[1:19:30] and and made justification a creed
[1:19:33] they made sanctification of creed they
[1:19:35] made the gifts and
[1:19:37] and the anointing and what pentecost did
[1:19:39] and that became a creed we believe this
[1:19:41] we believe that
[1:19:42] amen yeah but what about why did god do
[1:19:46] it what's he pointing you to
[1:19:47] does he want to move you on oh yeah yeah
[1:19:50] well
[1:19:50] we believe there's going to be there's
[1:19:52] going to be there's going to be no not
[1:19:53] going to be
[1:19:54] it is a resurrection it is
[1:19:57] the rapture at the prophet of god and i
[1:19:59] i
[1:20:00] i might again bring some quotes on these
[1:20:02] things regarding the rapture he said the
[1:20:04] rapture is going on all the time
[1:20:06] and he said the rap and he said what god
[1:20:08] has done is to give us rapturing faith
[1:20:10] amen see what's god focusing on just
[1:20:13] this doctrine
[1:20:14] or to a lot of people it's the trinity
[1:20:16] oh yeah we don't believe the trinity
[1:20:17] there's only one god
[1:20:19] or a lot of people oh yeah as long as
[1:20:21] you get baptized in the name of the lord
[1:20:22] jesus christ
[1:20:23] amen that is the father that is the son
[1:20:25] that is the holy ghost
[1:20:27] amen but it goes beyond that amen why
[1:20:30] all that god has done
[1:20:32] is bringing us into a more personal
[1:20:34] relationship
[1:20:35] with jesus amen and more personal
[1:20:38] amen relationship with the word amen
[1:20:42] praise the lord brother because amen
[1:20:46] again we're we're getting into a
[1:20:48] spiritual revelation of who we are
[1:20:50] a spiritual revelation that we are the
[1:20:52] sons and daughters of god
[1:20:55] amen by the grace of god so god elvis
[1:20:58] amen brother that we're going to allow
[1:21:01] the revelation to control us
[1:21:03] amen we're going to allow the revelation
[1:21:05] to guide us and lead us amen
[1:21:07] amen so that we're going to do we're
[1:21:09] going to talk only as the seed of god
[1:21:12] amen we'll walk as the seed of god we're
[1:21:15] going to live as the seed of god
[1:21:17] amen not followers of willem ranum
[1:21:20] amen not by any maids brother
[1:21:24] but again there there's too many
[1:21:26] believers that are just followers of
[1:21:28] william branham
[1:21:29] oh yeah and now as i said oh luther
[1:21:32] became the founder of that religion
[1:21:34] wesley that religion willing booth that
[1:21:36] religion pentecostals certain
[1:21:38] pentecostals that that religion
[1:21:40] amen and now among the message there's
[1:21:42] too many
[1:21:43] or they're the followers of william
[1:21:45] branham oh yeah god sent william branham
[1:21:47] william branham william branham no
[1:21:49] amen brother i tell you william branham
[1:21:51] wants to get his name out of it
[1:21:53] and get christ into it oh yeah and again
[1:21:56] again that's what he said what
[1:21:57] tremendous because he saw the spirits
[1:22:00] that were moving among believers amen
[1:22:02] and he said that's your problem
[1:22:04] he said you can't see the other angel
[1:22:06] amen
[1:22:07] they only saw the angel that stood in
[1:22:09] the pulpit and that was william branham
[1:22:11] oh yeah and that's why that brother put
[1:22:13] that note in his pocket
[1:22:14] and said oh william brandon is my lord
[1:22:16] what
[1:22:18] what what what an influence what what an
[1:22:20] anointing that was on that brother
[1:22:22] it wasn't jesus no like i said the
[1:22:25] prophet said if you keep that up he said
[1:22:27] i'll leave the ministry.
[1:22:28] aysan all right he said because you're
[1:22:30] making me he said antichrist
[1:22:33] and there's still there's still a lot of
[1:22:34] believers today that's making william
[1:22:36] branham
[1:22:37] antichrist amen brother let's put the
[1:22:40] focus on jesus
[1:22:41] amen this brother focus on the word
[1:22:43] because the prophet did highlight it
[1:22:45] over and over again
[1:22:46] that what god has done regarding the
[1:22:49] mystery of god and the mystery of the
[1:22:50] word
[1:22:51] reveal he says to give us faith for the
[1:22:54] rapture
[1:22:55] amen and how many are focusing on it
[1:22:57] concentrating on it
[1:22:58] they're still focusing on doctrine of
[1:23:00] this doctrine this doctrine
[1:23:01] and even the rapture becomes a doctrine
[1:23:03] amen resurrection is a doctrine
[1:23:05] oh the yeah this is the what we believe
[1:23:08] concerning the resurrection
[1:23:09] is what we believe concerning the
[1:23:10] rapture no no brother
[1:23:13] we got to believe what god is doing
[1:23:16] not what he did amen for the rapture for
[1:23:19] the resurrection
[1:23:21] amen and so he said when he read the
[1:23:24] scriptures
[1:23:25] now he said i i the thought of god's
[1:23:28] word
[1:23:28] calling a total separation amen
[1:23:32] and i recognize down through the years
[1:23:34] all the time that i've been
[1:23:35] around the message and near the message
[1:23:37] and so on amen
[1:23:39] that the total separation is what's
[1:23:41] lacking
[1:23:42] in a lot of believers they're not
[1:23:46] totally separated unto the lord amen
[1:23:50] oh they separated from a denomination
[1:23:52] and say i believe the message of william
[1:23:53] branham
[1:23:54] i believe that the revelation of this
[1:23:56] mystery of that mystery and so on
[1:23:58] amen but mainly it becomes doctrine
[1:24:01] a creed what do you believe oh i believe
[1:24:03] this
[1:24:04] oh well we believe we're the bride of
[1:24:08] christ
[1:24:08] we believe that god is working on us
[1:24:11] increasing
[1:24:12] our faith for the rapture increasing our
[1:24:15] faith for the resurrection
[1:24:16] we've got to because brother as we go
[1:24:18] into the word
[1:24:19] any man become one with the lord one
[1:24:21] with his word then the resurrection and
[1:24:23] the rapture
[1:24:24] ought to be coming more and more and
[1:24:25] more real to us
[1:24:27] more and more precious to us brother
[1:24:29] because we want it
[1:24:30] we need it amen only that god wants it
[1:24:33] god needs it to get us out of time and
[1:24:35] into eternity why
[1:24:37] because there's judgment coming and so
[1:24:40] he's got to get the bride out
[1:24:41] by grace amen and what we're witnessing
[1:24:45] today is concerning the coven issue
[1:24:47] brother it's there's other things going
[1:24:48] to happen
[1:24:50] most definitely amen i pray grace
[1:24:54] amen that we're recognizing this when it
[1:24:56] comes to all that's going on
[1:24:58] again it's god allowing it right brother
[1:25:00] this
[1:25:01] oh my just constant just think it it's
[1:25:03] to give us a greater revelation
[1:25:05] of what god is doing and what the devil
[1:25:08] is doing
[1:25:09] amen just saying satan has come down
[1:25:11] with a great wrath knowing his time is
[1:25:13] short
[1:25:13] amen and he's going to do this and he's
[1:25:15] going to do that god permits this and
[1:25:16] god is going to permit that
[1:25:18] amen brother and what and he permits it
[1:25:21] why
[1:25:21] to bring out the spirit is on the on
[1:25:23] this individual that individual
[1:25:24] and yet to bring out the resurrection
[1:25:26] and rapturing faith of the bride
[1:25:28] amen because he said he told us in the
[1:25:31] word
[1:25:32] that this is going to happen that's
[1:25:33] going to happen but he told us that when
[1:25:35] you see it
[1:25:36] look up amen brother and what do you
[1:25:39] mean
[1:25:40] okay it means that you're you're you're
[1:25:42] thinking and believing about the rapture
[1:25:44] and the resurrection
[1:25:45] amen so when this happens it's going to
[1:25:47] bring out our faith do we really believe
[1:25:49] it do we really are we really looking
[1:25:51] for it or is it just a doctrine
[1:25:53] in our church amen well if you're the
[1:25:56] seed of god
[1:25:57] when all this begins to happen this is
[1:25:59] falling down on the world that's falling
[1:26:01] on the world amen
[1:26:02] then brother we're getting more and more
[1:26:04] and more conscious
[1:26:06] or we're at the end come on let's get
[1:26:08] ready we're going we're leaving
[1:26:10] get ready for the rapture amen but still
[1:26:12] but
[1:26:13] a lot of believers are going to focus
[1:26:15] more and more on the natural things
[1:26:16] so we want we want everything to be all
[1:26:18] right we want everything to be in line
[1:26:20] we want to have this we want to have
[1:26:21] that no let it all go
[1:26:23] amen amen let's let's let's
[1:26:26] see what god wants to give us let's say
[1:26:29] what god wants to do in us now

[1:26:33] for this faith for that well
[1:26:35] yeah that's all you're gonna have
[1:26:38] that's all you're gonna have what what
[1:26:40] do you have faith for the rapture
[1:26:41] well people got more faith for the
[1:26:43] natural things than you do with
[1:26:44] spiritual
[1:26:46] but god is trying to get our attention
[1:26:47] from the natural to their spiritual
[1:26:50] amen praise the name of the lord uh
[1:26:53] brother
[1:26:53] it's going to make you a oddball yeah

[1:27:27] spiritual not religious
[1:27:30] amen
[1:27:34] he said god's word calls ray total
[1:27:37] separation

[1:37:51] explaining how this is going to happen
[1:37:52] that's going to happen
[1:37:53] everybody said we got to come into
[1:37:54] awareness with jesus and he said
[1:37:57] praise the name of the lord oh yeah he
[1:37:59] said we are one with jesus
[1:38:01] his attitude his spirit is is and his
[1:38:04] nature
[1:38:04] and so on and now now you're ready for
[1:38:07] the rapture

[1:38:10] oh yeah we we're
[1:38:11] we're the body of christ christ in us
[1:38:14] the hope of glory
[1:38:15] and he was saying yeah he said but he
[1:38:17] said oh if you're in the body of christ
[1:38:19] he said
[1:38:20] you're not going to say the eye is not
[1:38:21] going to say to the fingers oh i don't
[1:38:23] need you
[1:38:24] and he said he said and this part of
[1:38:26] your body up here your shoulder is not

[1:38:34] you

[1:38:39] so he said so this has got to be the
[1:38:40] attitude he said between
[1:38:42] all the members of the body of christ is
[1:38:44] you got to respect
[1:38:46] he said he said up here you got to
[1:38:47] respect your feet
[1:38:49] down there defeat's going to respect
[1:38:50] your head and he said again he said
[1:38:52] there he said you're going to respect
[1:38:53] your respect the small finger and the
[1:38:56] big fingers respect the small one
[1:38:58] you're gonna you're gonna have to
[1:38:59] respect your eyelids oh yes he said why
[1:39:01] because it's all there for a reason amen
[1:39:04] but and he knew but he said when it
[1:39:06] comes to christianity and
[1:39:08] things today he said there's there's
[1:39:10] that lack of respect
[1:39:11] amen even wrong so-called christianity
[1:39:14] he said look down their nose at this one
[1:39:15] look down at that look down at that one
[1:39:17] listen he said they're all there for a
[1:39:18] reason
[1:39:19] amen he said even your ears need your
[1:39:21] feet
[1:39:22] and he said even your hands he said you
[1:39:24] need your legs amen
[1:39:26] you need your toes and so on amen let's
[1:39:29] have respect
[1:39:30] he said for one another as christians
[1:39:33] asian amen because he said we are all
[1:39:36] part of the body of christ
[1:39:38] amen let's all believe that we're part
[1:39:40] of the bride of christ
[1:39:42] amen so we're going to respect this
[1:39:44] brother respect that sister amen
[1:39:46] oh yeah they might have again the bible
[1:39:49] says
[1:39:49] that there's those with his
[1:39:50] understanding and this understanding
[1:39:52] that understanding amen and he said let
[1:39:55] the strong
[1:39:56] support the weak amen you're there to
[1:39:58] encourage one another
[1:39:59] by the grace of god amen grace
[1:40:03] brother to me when we when we failed to
[1:40:07] do that we fail to recognize that
[1:40:09] we haven't been separated from unbelief
[1:40:11] we're not believing this
[1:40:12] not believing that but god moves in
[1:40:14] mysterious ways his wonders to perform
[1:40:18] amen brother thank god he's not going to
[1:40:20] move in our way it's his way
[1:40:22] it's not what not how we do it it's what
[1:40:24] he how he does it
[1:40:25] amen and brother yes it's amazing
[1:40:29] that god separated abraham from his
[1:40:30] father and god separated
[1:40:32] abraham a lot from abraham amen god does
[1:40:35] and all the way if you go through the
[1:40:36] scriptures you'll find god separating
[1:40:38] separating separating
[1:40:39] amen and i'll tell you if there's
[1:40:41] anything god's got to do and god wants
[1:40:43] to do
[1:40:44] what more to take us into the
[1:40:46] resurrection rapture is bring separation
[1:40:49] amen
[1:40:50] by the grace of god because again let me
[1:40:54] highlight
[1:40:54] that he calls for a not separation total
[1:40:58] separation
[1:40:59] from unbelief amen
[1:41:03] praise the lord and brother sometimes
[1:41:06] that you you'll feel that spirit in a
[1:41:08] non in a believer
[1:41:10] professing believer amen but like i said
[1:41:12] whereas one time
[1:41:14] i was associated with a with a with a
[1:41:16] gentleman
[1:41:17] and he was an anglican man and oh
[1:41:20] and he would come and to get something
[1:41:23] that we had there for him in the natural
[1:41:25] and oh and he was he was getting i guess
[1:41:28] he was my age
[1:41:29] and he was in his 70s at the time
[1:41:32] and i said oh i said god bless you and
[1:41:35] oh he was oh
[1:41:36] he was spiritual i said spiritual
[1:41:40] and yeah i said rather i knew it and he
[1:41:43] said
[1:41:43] he said god bless you and thank you he
[1:41:45] said for your encouragement to keep
[1:41:47] believing and keep pressing on
[1:41:49] and just basic as the lord would reveal
[1:41:51] it to me and so on
[1:41:53] and uh and like i said another time he
[1:41:55] came
[1:41:56] and he handed me handed me that envelope
[1:41:58] and i opened the envelope and it was a
[1:42:00] it was tithing and
[1:42:04] 300 check for tithing i said what
[1:42:08] i said oh i'll send that overseas no no
[1:42:10] no
[1:42:11] he said it's for you he said i want to
[1:42:14] thank you
[1:42:14] for what you've done for me and he said
[1:42:17] you've helped me
[1:42:18] oh i said that's good praise the lord he
[1:42:20] said praise the lord amen thank you
[1:42:22] he was spiritual like i said i said what
[1:42:25] church do you attend he said my church
[1:42:27] are on topsail beach and he said i go
[1:42:30] down there
[1:42:31] every day sit and i walk over that rock
[1:42:33] and i get up on that rock and i pray
[1:42:35] and i worship the lord amen oh i said
[1:42:38] god bless you he was spiritual
[1:42:40] amen of course
[1:42:43] a few months later a couple years later
[1:42:45] we did hear him and he was
[1:42:47] the lord took him on he was gone amen
[1:42:50] but amen but i couldn't say i i don't
[1:42:53] need him
[1:42:54] no god i got adam there for a reason
[1:42:57] oh for a reason to be a witness and he
[1:42:59] was a witness to the church he attended
[1:43:01] oh yeah because the number of the people
[1:43:03] come and say oh it's wonderful praise
[1:43:05] the lord
[1:43:06] they said you ought to be the preacher
[1:43:08] and not your brother
[1:43:10] his brother was with a pastor or not or
[1:43:12] a clergy
[1:43:13] and uh and not him but but other
[1:43:16] members of the church would come and say
[1:43:18] you you should be preaching
[1:43:20] why because they recognize that
[1:43:22] anointing and that spirit on them
[1:43:23] that revelation that understanding that
[1:43:25] he had this
[1:43:26] oh i believe that they saw the anointing
[1:43:28] of god in his life
[1:43:30] amen and when it comes to witnessing old
[1:43:33] is wonderful
[1:43:34] yeah and then and to them concerning the
[1:43:37] word of god he was spiritual

[1:45:15] word

[1:45:33] the love of god
[1:45:34] what god did for us what god's doing for

[1:46:10] that were living in luther's day and
[1:46:12] believe in luther's message to gather
[1:46:13] with them
[1:46:14] and the others gathered with the

[1:53:56] two
[1:53:58] but god got a dozen parts
[1:54:02] praise the lord
[1:54:05] so let me leave you again with the
[1:54:06] understanding that what god requires in
[1:54:09] you and in me
[1:54:10] god's looking for total separation from
[1:54:12] unbelief
[1:54:14] and sometimes you got to bring total
[1:54:16] separation
[1:54:18] from friends yeah it does
[1:54:22] you keep your attitude right your spirit
[1:54:23] right you know
[1:54:25] but you don't go out of your way if they
[1:54:26] want if they want to go out of their way
[1:54:28] and and have some fellowship with you
[1:54:29] that's one thing but not you go out of
[1:54:31] their way
[1:54:32] by the grace of god or it takes the
[1:54:35] anointing
[1:54:36] of the holy ghost
[1:54:39] but he said god separated the light from
[1:54:42] the darkness
[1:54:44] in creation so he said the word of god
[1:54:48] began to separate the light from the
[1:54:49] darkness
[1:54:50] from the beginning so does it remain
[1:54:52] till this day
[1:54:56] and he said e being the word
[1:54:59] said knowest thou not that i must be
[1:55:02] about
[1:55:03] my father's business amen
[1:55:09] and he says so the word is always
[1:55:11] corrective
[1:55:12] and always right and the word will
[1:55:15] correct
[1:55:16] every wrong always amen
[1:55:21] and he said god separated the light from
[1:55:23] the darkness
[1:55:24] and it's been doing that ever since
[1:55:27] separating light from darkness amen
[1:55:31] he's separating light from darkness
[1:55:32] naturally and spiritually
[1:55:36] in our lives by the grace of god
[1:55:43] he said even the water was separated
[1:55:45] from the land
[1:55:47] amen he said god speaks every word with
[1:55:50] a meaning
[1:55:51] and something that he is trying to
[1:55:53] achieve and will achieve
[1:55:55] by his word and he's when god says
[1:55:57] anything
[1:55:58] he must back up what he says amen
[1:56:01] and when the word of god has been
[1:56:03] vindicated amen
[1:56:05] vindicated he said it is light
[1:56:08] now he said the word itself
[1:56:12] isn't light until it's vindicated
[1:56:15] light in your word in your life amen
[1:56:19] so what is your life reflecting to your
[1:56:21] family friends and neighbors

[1:56:26] neighbors to see it see something

[1:57:35] word is vindicated
[1:57:36] the word for the hour is vindicated and

[1:57:48] resurrection
[1:57:50] and they're going to see in you that

[2:00:14] then that that is light
[2:00:16] vindicated in you and it's when the word
[2:00:18] is vindicated
[2:00:19] the word for the hour is vindicated amen
[2:00:23] praise the lord we're not re we're not
[2:00:25] reflecting what happened 100 years ago
[2:00:27] 200 years ago
[2:00:28] we're reflecting what god is doing not
[2:00:31] what he did
[2:00:33] the rapture the resurrection amen
[2:00:37] luther went on justification
[2:00:38] justification justification trying to
[2:00:40] get
[2:00:41] others to to to see it and to believe it
[2:00:43] pentecostal went on with the baptism and
[2:00:45] the gifts
[2:00:46] got trying to get others to see it and
[2:00:47] experience it experience it
[2:00:50] and now is moving on to the rapture and
[2:00:53] the resurrection
[2:00:54] by the grace of god amen encouraging
[2:00:57] others
[2:00:58] to experience the resurrection and the
[2:01:00] rapture
[2:01:02] what an experience that we have i pray
[2:01:05] god that you got that experience of the
[2:01:06] resurrection in your heart
[2:01:08] and you had the quicken made alive
[2:01:13] spiritually what's that's what we need
[2:01:16] to focus on our spiritual life
[2:01:19] amen you at the and made alive
[2:01:22] and we and you at the raptured and
[2:01:25] brought up to the
[2:01:26] up to christ amen what for
[2:01:29] to get the revealed word to give you
[2:01:32] faith
[2:01:33] amen to give you faith so that you're
[2:01:35] going to be resurrected and raptured
[2:01:37] into a body a glorified body amen
[2:01:42] amen
[2:01:48] he said in genesis he said god separated
[2:01:51] life from death and if we believe the
[2:01:54] word of god it's the word of life
[2:01:56] to us but if we question the word of god
[2:02:00] it's death to us don't question it
[2:02:03] believe it
[2:02:04] accept it let it digest in your soul
[2:02:08] amen he said god also had an atonement
[2:02:13] be merciful to us he accepted a
[2:02:16] substitute death for their death
[2:02:18] and he separated life from death in the
[2:02:21] garden of eden
[2:02:22] he did it by his word and he is still
[2:02:26] speaking his word of life
[2:02:28] to those who want to believe it
[2:02:32] amen you recognize what you need
[2:02:35] and it's by the word jesus has
[2:02:39] constantly told us
[2:02:41] that there is a separation and we find
[2:02:43] that the last thing that is
[2:02:45] that's predicted to the human race
[2:02:48] before the great and final day when we
[2:02:50] ascend into the presence of god
[2:02:52] there will be a final separation and he
[2:02:56] will separate
[2:02:57] the sheep from the goats amen
[2:03:00] and god will continually has been
[2:03:02] separating separating
[2:03:04] and that's what he's doing tonight he
[2:03:06] said amen that's what he always does
[2:03:09] he said he separates faith from unbelief
[2:03:13] amen and now as we find out in the
[2:03:16] numbers the sixth chapter
[2:03:18] that an azerite call was to separate
[2:03:21] themselves
[2:03:22] from all the world to the word of god
[2:03:25] that is a nazarite call separation
[2:03:29] amen it is total separation
[2:03:33] and we're not to go back into the world
[2:03:35] no more or have anything to do with the
[2:03:37] world
[2:03:38] but claim only unto god amen
[2:03:41] and jesus is coming after a bride a
[2:03:43] woman a church
[2:03:44] that's separated from the things of the
[2:03:46] world the cares of this world
[2:03:49] she is separated from fashions of this
[2:03:51] modern age that we live in
[2:03:53] i've noticed now that even believers are
[2:03:56] getting more caught up with the fashions
[2:03:58] of this world
[2:03:59] because i've i've been into certain
[2:04:01] public buildings and i see the people
[2:04:03] going and common going to come
[2:04:04] and i've even seen just the worldly
[2:04:07] people out there i guess
[2:04:08] and i've seen the old seniors old
[2:04:13] and i said what
[2:04:16] what's she dressed like that for you
[2:04:18] know even though
[2:04:19] even the old people are caught up just
[2:04:21] shows that where what it's insane
[2:04:23] because the word prophet said the world
[2:04:24] is going to go insane and all that's
[2:04:26] going on in the world today is insanity
[2:04:29] yeah and i said it's unbelievable i said
[2:04:32] my you would never see an old woman
[2:04:35] dressed like that
[2:04:37] and not only in her clothing but even
[2:04:40] her hair
[2:04:41] the way she had her hair and i said what
[2:04:45] i said oh she must be crazy she's got to
[2:04:48] be insane
[2:04:49] you know because ordinarily you just see
[2:04:51] senior citizens you see them
[2:04:52] you know they might dress worldly but
[2:04:54] it's just basic clothes
[2:04:56] but not the foolishness that that lady
[2:04:58] had on oh yeah it was
[2:05:01] it absolutely amazed me and knowing that
[2:05:03] i'm seeing like like
[2:05:04] like in their hair do they they're
[2:05:06] hairstyles
[2:05:08] no i said lord
[2:05:11] i said that's insanity well because your
[2:05:13] hair is just
[2:05:14] you know all out over here all out over
[2:05:16] there pushed over here oh dear hanging
[2:05:18] out there hanging out somewhere else
[2:05:21] that's insanity and not only that but
[2:05:24] now you see believers
[2:05:25] acting that way and some of the clothes
[2:05:27] that believers put on is just
[2:05:29] just crazy and and their hair cells it's
[2:05:31] just crazy
[2:05:33] it's not a style it's anything but a
[2:05:35] style
[2:05:36] yeah amazing i trust
[2:05:40] by grace of god that you've got that
[2:05:42] revelation and you're walking through
[2:05:43] this world
[2:05:44] and you see this and see that i trust by
[2:05:46] grace you're going to have the
[2:05:46] revelation that it's insanity
[2:05:49] amen so i pray the grace of god to give
[2:05:52] the believers
[2:05:53] amen our sisters a holy ghost revelation
[2:05:58] to keep it normal keep your hearing off
[2:06:00] just keep it normal
[2:06:03] god have mercy help us
[2:06:07] amen
[2:06:11] he says and the husband and the wife is
[2:06:13] one he said so the bride of christ
[2:06:16] and christ is one the bride and the word
[2:06:19] become one
[2:06:20] for the word is living through the bride
[2:06:23] so
[2:06:24] amen so i pray the grace of god to our
[2:06:27] sisters
[2:06:28] that'll be the word in simplicity amen
[2:06:31] living through them praise the lord the
[2:06:34] word and our brothers

[2:06:44] brother it's like all again someone
[2:06:46] highlighted about
[2:06:48] faith and laying that lane out of hands
[2:06:53] and brother brown was was reminded to
[2:06:55] lay hands all because

[2:07:22] great faith
[2:07:24] amen speak the word only
[2:07:27] and he said my servant whole servant
[2:07:31] today they become more with their with
[2:07:33] their sons and daughters mothers and
[2:07:34] fathers grandmother grandfathers
[2:07:36] but that was a centurion's roman soldier
[2:07:40] and his servant was sick nigh unto death
[2:07:45] my that centurion he had a nice spirit
[2:07:49] oh oh he he felt right
[2:07:52] and why because his heart was going out
[2:07:54] to his service servant maybe his
[2:07:55] servant's family
[2:07:56] and so on and all mine and so he when he
[2:07:59] heard that jesus was over there
[2:08:01] somewhere
[2:08:01] oh he he went he went out look find
[2:08:04] jesus
[2:08:06] and he called on jesus yeah
[2:08:09] and jesus said you have great faith i
[2:08:12] haven't found so great faith no not in
[2:08:14] israel would he find such great faith in
[2:08:17] newfoundland
[2:08:21] speak the word only
[2:08:24] and my servant will be healed
[2:08:28] and he was amen grace of god
[2:08:32] the prophet highlighted that again he
[2:08:33] says see great faith
[2:08:36] amen do we have great faith for the
[2:08:38] resurrection
[2:08:40] great faith for the rapture speak the
[2:08:42] word
[2:08:43] only amen
[2:08:47] hallelujah he said the only credential
[2:08:50] that a believer has
[2:08:51] is the word of god living in him
[2:08:54] amen declaring jesus christ lives in
[2:08:58] that person
[2:08:59] that's a separated nazarite unto the
[2:09:01] lord separated
[2:09:03] for the word's sake he said the first
[2:09:06] adam he says separated himself
[2:09:07] from the word to his wife now he could
[2:09:10] have stayed with the word
[2:09:12] if he wished to but he separated himself
[2:09:14] from the word to wish
[2:09:16] with his wife why because he believed
[2:09:18] that redeeming him
[2:09:20] god would redeem his wife now
[2:09:26] that's exactly what the common carnal
[2:09:28] church member does today
[2:09:30] separates themselves from the true
[2:09:32] living word to hold to
[2:09:33] their church but god help us
[2:09:37] to separate from the church stay with
[2:09:39] the word
[2:09:41] amen god be with us
[2:09:46] let me finish with this now he should
[2:09:49] the first man
[2:09:50] separate himself the first adam from the
[2:09:53] word
[2:09:54] to go with his wife and question whether
[2:09:56] god
[2:09:58] kept his word or not what a perfect type
[2:10:01] of the lukewarm carnal-minded believer
[2:10:04] today
[2:10:05] that still wants to cling with what
[2:10:07] their tradition says
[2:10:09] instead of taking what the word says
[2:10:11] amen
[2:10:12] god help us to stay with the word
[2:10:16] amen i want to finish right there
[2:10:19] amen and i thought i would be able to do
[2:10:22] it one service but
[2:10:23] we'll wait till maybe another service or
[2:10:26] two
[2:10:27] god help us we're living in a spiritual
[2:10:31] warfare
[2:10:33] definitely don't let the devil win
[2:10:37] i pray god by the holy ghost is going to
[2:10:38] win the victory over
[2:10:40] over our senses in our flesh amen
[2:10:43] so that we're going to walk in the
