[51:10] we are found
[51:12] complete and how that we sing Lord As
[51:15] and we're a prayer I Love You
[51:19] Lord because you first loved
[51:23] me and sometimes I don't understand Lord
[51:27] how that all
[51:29] works but I know that somewhere in this
[51:33] life you found
[51:37] me as it were a crippled and broken
[51:40] spirit in
[51:42] life not knowing where to turn not
[51:44] knowing what to do and seeking all of my
[51:47] own ways and my own things and when I
[51:50] found there was nowhere else to
[51:53] go you came to me and brought me
[51:59] home and to this day Lord over 50 years
[52:03] ago that draw is still
[52:07] there that
[52:09] Life of Christ still lives in this
[52:12] man and forever
[52:15] will and for that I'm
[52:18] grateful and above all I want to say
[52:20] thank
[52:22] you and I thank you for bringing me
[52:24] before this
[52:25] people to share that
[52:29] life so we love you and I'm sure there I
[52:32] know there's others here who love you
[52:35] and desire to be of service to you in
[52:38] any way that is found possible in our
[52:41] lives so I give you this service now and
[52:44] as it's said the best thing a preacher
[52:47] can do is get himself out of the way
[52:49] we've travel a long
[52:51] distance but I want to leave again for
[52:53] the next however long you you would
[52:55] choose to
[52:57] speak because I want it to be your words
[53:00] and not my
[53:02] own so we give you this
[53:05] service for your honor and Glory as
[53:07] always in the name of our precious Lord
[53:11] Jesus
[53:13] Christ
[53:15] amen God bless
[53:17] you I'm glad to be back again this
[53:21] morning we
[53:23] uh I've enjoyed being here with you very
[53:26] much uh and the brother given us
[53:28] complete Liberty we've spoken on a few
[53:31] things
[53:33] that to me are are deeper than a lot of
[53:36] times we get to go uh when we're on the
[53:39] foreign field as we explained the other
[53:42] night I think it's 30 countries or maybe
[53:45] 31 that we've spoken in now and often
[53:48] times it's
[53:49] uh kind of rugged I thought we I had
[53:53] them put up we'll put up a couple just
[53:55] just a few pictures go ahead and be
[53:56] seated for a few minutes
[54:00] here and as you look at these things
[54:03] this morning I just a few pictures that
[54:06] we've taken along the way and I only
[54:09] chose the ones that uh out of because
[54:14] whether you know it or not you helped
[54:16] finance this particular Journey that
[54:19] we're
[54:20] on and I wanted you to look at this lady
[54:23] because uh God along the way does some
[54:27] very unusual and tremendous things I had
[54:32] met her two years
[54:33] before in h she's from Honduras and
[54:37] where as you can see simple lady and
[54:39] she's actually standing in the mud
[54:41] because the hurricane had come in the
[54:43] night before we went down to this place
[54:45] to baptize a couple of sisters and this
[54:48] woman when we arrived in
[54:51] Honduras brother Eric guo and I think we
[54:55] might have one of his a picture of him
[54:58] uh was helping to sponsor us there in
[55:00] Honduras when we arrived we were going
[55:03] to we were there for a youth meeting and
[55:06] for that youth meeting uh they were only
[55:09] expecting maybe 40 to 50 kids something
[55:12] like that because the youth meetings
[55:15] were scheduled right after the country's
[55:18] election and over the last few elections
[55:21] they've had a lot of violence because
[55:23] essentially there's two parties or two
[55:25] men and they have a lot of fighting
[55:29] after whoever winds up with the election
[55:31] in this particular election they had a
[55:34] woman also on the ballot well people are
[55:36] so uh fed up with them fighting and
[55:39] killing people over the elections the
[55:42] woman was overwhelmingly
[55:44] elected so there was no violence and uh
[55:49] so when they the other pastors he'd
[55:51] invited quite a few other churches with
[55:53] the young people and and when uh they
[55:56] found out wow day one day two no no
[55:59] violence no violence and so by day three
[56:02] which was
[56:04] Wednesday uh and I think that was
[56:06] Wednesday night was when it was supposed
[56:08] to start they these pastors started
[56:10] calling and
[56:12] said can we bring our our kids and he
[56:15] said well yes they had rented a large
[56:17] School uh area and he said yes we have
[56:22] room we bought bought a lot of food and
[56:25] and so we wound up with I think about
[56:27] 250
[56:29] kids and as the other pastors came so
[56:32] because of that they went to three
[56:34] meetings a day
[56:36] now three meetings here for a person
[56:39] that does what I do a lot well what's
[56:44] the big deal three
[56:46] services but it's a different draw it's
[56:48] a different pull and so I said well if
[56:51] we're having all these pastors show up
[56:53] why don't you know I'll just take the
[56:55] evening services and then they can have
[56:58] you know the other two Services each day
[57:01] and so that's what we did and that's
[57:02] what we went went to but when I arrived
[57:05] this particular woman was very sick uh
[57:10] the doctors had given
[57:12] her maybe 3 to 5 days to live if that
[57:17] because her kidneys had shut down her
[57:19] liver had shut down she was
[57:23] essentially I guess you could say like
[57:25] living dead they had taken her home and
[57:30] uh laid her on a bed they said she had
[57:32] not moved for TW about 20 days that's
[57:36] their testimony I I wasn't there and so
[57:39] for 20 days they said she had not even
[57:42] moved on the
[57:43] bed and when I got there Eric explained
[57:46] it to me briefly and uh like I said I
[57:50] had met this woman the year before and
[57:53] her kind of her job that she takes on
[57:56] she makes tamali really good tamali and
[58:00] sells them in the marketplace and and uh
[58:03] shares them with people
[58:05] and uh Eric said we need to you know try
[58:08] to get to her and pray for her and well
[58:10] when all these extra youth started
[58:12] showing up there was so many things
[58:15] going on we didn't make it that was like
[58:18] I think he told me I arrived I think on
[58:20] Tuesday and and we didn't make a Tuesday
[58:23] we didn't make it Wednesday and then we
[58:25] had three services a day going on and
[58:27] 250 young people and it was
[58:33] just there was no time cuz she lives out
[58:36] aways from the city there and so Sunday
[58:40] then I had gone down for the morning
[58:42] service into the capital city to Gig
[58:45] gaala and I came back to do the evening
[58:47] service Sunday night and
[58:51] uh Sunday night I happen to think about
[58:54] her and I I asked him wow are we going
[58:56] to be a is she still alive cuz they
[58:59] didn't expect her to live and he said he
[59:02] had called the family and they said well
[59:03] yeah she's still alive she's still
[59:05] breathing more or less and I said well
[59:10] when and he goes I don't know because
[59:12] they had to clear all the stuff out of
[59:13] the school because they're going to have
[59:15] school again so we had to do that clean
[59:17] up on Monday I believe it was Tuesday
[59:20] night before we got to go out there and
[59:24] I had my niece with me and uh she's
[59:28] fluent in Spanish so she was having a
[59:31] good time with the youth and he said
[59:34] well let's go out and see and when we
[59:37] went to the house all the family was
[59:40] gathered in the house because they're
[59:42] expecting her to pass at any
[59:45] time and I got down on the bed and I had
[59:48] to put my ear right down next to her to
[59:51] even hear her breathe and I mean it was
[59:53] like
[59:59] and that well she's still
[1:00:02] breathing sort of and uh so we prayed
[1:00:07] for her and I asked of course my niece
[1:00:10] and brother Eric and his wife and the
[1:00:13] four of us prayed for
[1:00:15] her and she didn't really do anything
[1:00:18] maybe moved just
[1:00:20] slightly and so about that time here
[1:00:24] came the whole family into the room and
[1:00:25] it was a fairly big room they had her in
[1:00:27] and they were all gathered around
[1:00:29] watching they didn't know what was going
[1:00:30] on and so we began to explain to the
[1:00:33] family well we're here we believe in
[1:00:35] prayer for the sick we believe God can
[1:00:37] raise people up and uh he's a
[1:00:41] Healer and so as we're explaining this
[1:00:44] to
[1:00:45] them I just felt well why don't we as
[1:00:49] the whole family pray for her
[1:00:51] again and so they were you know they had
[1:00:55] this like wow okay so the whole family
[1:00:58] gathered around the bed and we prayed
[1:01:00] for her a second time and when we when
[1:01:03] we did she stirred in fact she stirred
[1:01:06] to the point that she turned her head
[1:01:09] and kind of whispered to me help me I
[1:01:12] have faith for this were her
[1:01:16] words and so we talked just a few more
[1:01:22] words and stuff with the family and then
[1:01:25] I turned to brother Eric and I said
[1:01:27] let's pray one more time so we laid
[1:01:30] hands on her and I told him that the
[1:01:32] testimony kind of like the five stones
[1:01:35] that David used you know with his
[1:01:37] stripes she's healed uh he sends his
[1:01:40] word that's why we're here is to bring
[1:01:42] the word to her and heal the people he's
[1:01:45] the god that heals all of our diseases
[1:01:48] Believers lay hands on the sick they
[1:01:51] shall recover and so we we told that to
[1:01:55] the family and we prayed and when we
[1:01:57] prayed the third time she began to try
[1:02:00] to sit up and said help me and we helped
[1:02:03] her sit up and she moved to the edge of
[1:02:06] the bed and said and instructed her
[1:02:09] family get me a chair so they went and
[1:02:12] brought her a chair and we had to help
[1:02:14] her off the bed but she walked of her
[1:02:17] own accord and sat in the chair and
[1:02:19] began barking orders to her family bring
[1:02:22] the stuff so we can make visitors
[1:02:26] tamali
[1:02:29] now to me that was an absolute Miracle
[1:02:33] but I didn't know her side of the story
[1:02:35] until I went back this last time and you
[1:02:38] were the sponsors or a big part of the
[1:02:41] sponsorship for this meeting and this is
[1:02:43] the woman and we were G had gone here
[1:02:47] for a baptism and you notice the little
[1:02:50] fireplace that she's making tamales and
[1:02:52] coffee you know some of us like like
[1:02:55] coffee and so she's Oh Brother David you
[1:02:58] know do you want some coffee and so
[1:03:00] she's making coffee and tamal's and
[1:03:03] other stuff for the people and I got to
[1:03:06] hear her side of the
[1:03:08] testimony that happened just a little
[1:03:10] bit before Christmas when we prayed for
[1:03:12] her and they said at New Year's when she
[1:03:15] went to they had a New Year's
[1:03:17] service they said she was dancing and
[1:03:20] testifying of what God had done for her
[1:03:24] and her side of the story was she said
[1:03:26] she was somewhere she said I don't she
[1:03:29] didn't really know where it was just
[1:03:31] that it was a very pleasant
[1:03:34] place and that the first time we prayed
[1:03:36] she said she
[1:03:38] heard heard someone praying for her and
[1:03:42] she said she turned
[1:03:44] back and then she said the second time
[1:03:47] that we
[1:03:48] prayed she re-entered her
[1:03:52] body and when she re-entered her body
[1:03:55] the third time we prayed she said the
[1:03:57] strength came to get up off of that bed
[1:04:01] to come back and get off the bed and
[1:04:04] this is the woman and she's very active
[1:04:06] in still making tamali and coffee and
[1:04:10] those kind of things and so I wanted you
[1:04:12] to see that picture because you're part
[1:04:14] of
[1:04:16] this and people think oh he's a
[1:04:19] missionary he just wants money cuz he
[1:04:21] wants to go do no I like like to see the
[1:04:24] glory of God
[1:04:26] manifested and that's a picture of it so
[1:04:30] I don't know you can go ahead and go to
[1:04:31] a different slide but you're part of
[1:04:34] that
[1:04:36] that's I like to think of it you know
[1:04:38] these guys that sell you the MLM or
[1:04:41] multi-level marketing yeah you're in on
[1:04:44] this one okay you got a downline so
[1:04:48] anyway well I just wanted you to see
[1:04:50] that if you want to go ahead and click a
[1:04:51] few more I put this was one of the Cong
[1:04:54] congregations we spoke to in Honduras uh
[1:04:56] kiaga I believe was the name of the city
[1:05:00] go ahead another one uh City about 10 or
[1:05:05] 15 miles away uh forgot the name of that
[1:05:10] particular city boy there's a yeah you
[1:05:13] get to a lot of them but another
[1:05:15] congregation there this is some of the
[1:05:18] uh the Warfare that we speak sometimes
[1:05:21] when we go to these places we were in
[1:05:23] the jungle there in Panama this was from
[1:05:25] Panama this was just after I believe it
[1:05:28] was Honduras or just prior to Honduras
[1:05:31] and we'd been back in the jungle
[1:05:32] ministering to some people and they have
[1:05:34] these wonderful little bugs they call
[1:05:37] sandflies oh man I tell people I guess
[1:05:41] it's because oppositive blood type is a
[1:05:43] universal donor somehow the bugs
[1:05:48] know because everybody else will have
[1:05:51] two or three bites and I'll be just
[1:05:53] eating up
[1:05:54] so those are what the uh sandflies do to
[1:05:57] you go ahead and change it but uh next
[1:06:02] picture yeah it's not all jungles and
[1:06:05] stuff that's Panama City they call it
[1:06:07] New York and we did some Street meetings
[1:06:09] in Panama City go ahead uh this was one
[1:06:13] of the kind of a house Street meeting
[1:06:16] that we had there were sever people that
[1:06:18] came to Christ from this meeting that I
[1:06:22] know of and it might have been nine
[1:06:24] there were two others that I think
[1:06:25] perhaps had been backsliders and they
[1:06:27] came forward too that we prayed with and
[1:06:30] the lord gave a special touch to it so
[1:06:33] we did quite a few meetings this style
[1:06:35] of meeting kind of inside outside of
[1:06:40] houses uh I think when the as the trip
[1:06:45] went on we'd been there 21 days and I
[1:06:47] think we spoke 23 times so but it's
[1:06:52] interesting to jump from like what we've
[1:06:55] been doing with you which is I call it
[1:06:58] you know missionary or as Apostolic
[1:07:01] because Bible in Ephesians says the
[1:07:04] prophets and apostles are what bring you
[1:07:06] the Mysteries and then it becomes the uh
[1:07:09] responsibility the pastors evangelist to
[1:07:12] break those Mysteries down to the people
[1:07:16] and so but when we're out there we'll
[1:07:17] wind up doing evangelism for one service
[1:07:19] and then I'll go to like those other two
[1:07:22] churches where they're more mature and
[1:07:24] you can so you're kind of jumping in and
[1:07:27] in and out brother brandom called it
[1:07:28] changing gears one on one tape where
[1:07:32] when he was talking about having to go
[1:07:34] from Divine Healing into visions and
[1:07:37] then from that into evangelism and it
[1:07:39] really is it's kind of
[1:07:41] like changing gears and uh so that was
[1:07:45] one of the house meetings next slide
[1:07:47] there this was where we were at up in
[1:07:50] the jungle area it's with the embara PE
[1:07:53] people they're are native tribal people
[1:07:56] this was the kids from the tribal people
[1:07:58] that came to the services there and next
[1:08:02] s next slide there the the little kids
[1:08:06] are have their Sunday school underneath
[1:08:08] the church and that's the brother
[1:08:10] they're giving the the Sunday School
[1:08:12] lesson to the little ones and then uh
[1:08:16] this is the actual church service and
[1:08:18] then uh that's the
[1:08:22] church so and that is like I said in a
[1:08:25] jungle area and
[1:08:27] uh it's just different how do how do I
[1:08:31] explain that if you've never been there
[1:08:34] it's uh wonderful people we uh spent
[1:08:38] about 3 or 4 days with them up there and
[1:08:40] uh did multiple Services
[1:08:43] there and I don't know if I gave you any
[1:08:45] more than that or not go ahead that's
[1:08:47] some of the sisters they I don't know if
[1:08:50] they actually make the material for
[1:08:53] those skirts but they all wear that
[1:08:55] particular style skirt or most of the
[1:08:58] time at least for all the services uh
[1:09:01] very beautiful very colorful and they're
[1:09:03] called the embara people and before I
[1:09:05] left I I didn't put uh a picture of it
[1:09:08] up I don't think but they had it looks
[1:09:10] like a tattoo that's as people ask me
[1:09:12] what I eat well that's the local
[1:09:16] 7-Eleven I guess you call it or
[1:09:20] the the corner grocery store that's the
[1:09:23] kind of we eat a lot of that kind of
[1:09:25] stuff and so I think one more maybe two
[1:09:27] more I put on there this was another one
[1:09:30] of the street meetings we held at a
[1:09:32] school there in right on actually in a
[1:09:36] city that's kind of connected to Panama
[1:09:38] City they had uh quite a few different
[1:09:43] and the brothers down there are doing a
[1:09:44] lot of this in that country very
[1:09:48] different Spirit there among the people
[1:09:50] and they will get many visitors often
[1:09:54] for these kind of meetings and uh Lord
[1:09:57] is still moving Lord is still calling
[1:10:00] people out and that's one of the things
[1:10:02] that keeps us going so go ahead I think
[1:10:05] there might be one or two more
[1:10:08] uh that's it okay and so but I started
[1:10:12] to talk about the embar people they have
[1:10:15] a stuff a blue stuff that's kind of like
[1:10:18] a medicine to me or to them that they uh
[1:10:22] put on it looks like a
[1:10:24] tattoo and it comes from a particular
[1:10:27] tree that grows up on the mountains
[1:10:29] there kind of in the upper part of the
[1:10:32] Jungle there and for they put on my arm
[1:10:37] it looked like this kind of a strange
[1:10:39] tattoo but the stuff it uh if you're
[1:10:43] accepted by the tribe and you're
[1:10:44] considered a tribal friend or almost
[1:10:46] like a tribal member they give you this
[1:10:48] tattoo so they tattooed us three
[1:10:51] brothers but the stuff is so strange
[1:10:54] you can't get it off I mean it looks
[1:10:57] like a regular tattoo it doesn't come
[1:10:59] off and so I've got this uh you know
[1:11:03] this tattoo on my arm and uh but for I
[1:11:08] get some kind of dry skin stuff because
[1:11:12] of just because I guess and and so they
[1:11:15] said well this will really be good for
[1:11:17] your you know your dry skin and so they
[1:11:19] so I've got blue
[1:11:21] arms and this tattoo on my upper arm
[1:11:24] when I go back to Panama City and but
[1:11:27] this blue stuff you can't get it off it
[1:11:30] doesn't come off but it just goes away
[1:11:34] on the seventh
[1:11:36] day it just goes away you can't wash it
[1:11:40] off even soap and water but on the
[1:11:42] seventh day it
[1:11:44] disappears and I thought wow but so when
[1:11:48] we went to service and of course down
[1:11:49] there you're wearing short sleeves cuz
[1:11:51] it's hot and I have blue arms because
[1:11:54] they've rubbed it all over my arms and I
[1:11:56] have this Blue Tattoo and I told people
[1:11:59] I said you know I never thought I'd come
[1:12:00] to Panama and leave like an alien and I
[1:12:03] held up my blue
[1:12:05] arms but uh we get into some really
[1:12:08] strange ones uh some very beautiful ones
[1:12:12] and this was just the two countries that
[1:12:15] you helped us with last year and uh
[1:12:18] thank you and God bless you there was we
[1:12:21] baptized I think four at the embara
[1:12:24] village and then two sisters in Honduras
[1:12:29] and I think they baptized well I know
[1:12:31] they baptized a few from that one house
[1:12:33] meeting that I showed you of that seven
[1:12:36] after we left so God's still moving he's
[1:12:40] building your downline so God bless you
[1:12:42] and thank you from them and from me and
[1:12:46] of course our little church there at
[1:12:48] home
[1:12:49] uh it means a lot to us and and I trust
[1:12:55] it means a lot to the Lord Jesus
[1:12:58] so I will just mention one other story I
[1:13:02] spent uh this was from a couple you well
[1:13:05] you know the pre scamdemic pandemic
[1:13:09] however you view that situation but uh
[1:13:13] we had been in South Africa and I spent
[1:13:16] I think it was about nine days with uh
[1:13:19] Zulu
[1:13:21] people and for me it was kind of treat
[1:13:24] they
[1:13:25] uh um they didn't quite know what to
[1:13:28] think about me uh but we had such a good
[1:13:32] time and about 18 years ago actually
[1:13:36] this month this
[1:13:39] November I was struck with a an
[1:13:41] infection that went into my backbone
[1:13:44] that was serious enough I knew I was
[1:13:46] sick and I'd been to the doctor once and
[1:13:48] they gave me some medicine and the
[1:13:50] medicine kind of it was bad enough they
[1:13:52] had these big pink pills and the drug
[1:13:55] wouldn't even get near the car we did
[1:13:57] the drive-thru window and he goes who is
[1:14:00] this for and I was in the back seat and
[1:14:02] my leg was
[1:14:03] black and my kids are in the front and
[1:14:06] they said just pointed to me in the back
[1:14:08] seat and he goes I don't know what you
[1:14:11] got but here and he threw the pills into
[1:14:14] the into the back seat well eventually
[1:14:17] that wound up in my backbone it was an
[1:14:20] infection from the leg originally
[1:14:24] and
[1:14:26] uh brother Dr gyrus there and he pastors
[1:14:30] a little church in Roseberg Oregon uh
[1:14:34] he's a regular medical doctor he told
[1:14:37] the uh my wife because I had this fever
[1:14:40] that would come and go and come and go
[1:14:43] it had been that way for over a month
[1:14:45] almost a month and a
[1:14:47] half and they had changed and given me
[1:14:50] some different medicine and it kept it
[1:14:53] at Bay but it never went away and he
[1:14:56] told my wife if that high fever ever
[1:14:59] comes back get him to ER as fast as you
[1:15:02] can get him there because something's
[1:15:05] wrong and uh that night I I told my wife
[1:15:09] she kept telling me you need to go back
[1:15:10] to the doctor you need to go back to the
[1:15:12] do she's pretty good at keeping track of
[1:15:15] me and uh Lord bless her this
[1:15:19] morning and I told her honey we had
[1:15:22] three weeks worth of meetings planned
[1:15:24] ahead that we've been working on to get
[1:15:26] together uh special meetings in three
[1:15:30] different places and I said once we get
[1:15:31] those meetings done I said I'll go back
[1:15:34] to the doctor but I don't want to go
[1:15:35] back now because if I go back now he's
[1:15:37] going to want me to go to the hospital
[1:15:38] and I'm not going to do that because I
[1:15:40] have three weeks worth of
[1:15:42] meetings so at the end of the third the
[1:15:45] last meeting we were in Salem Oregon or
[1:15:48] just south of Salem There Brother Rich
[1:15:51] Cobbs and when gyrus told her that we
[1:15:54] started home that night and about uh 2
[1:15:58] hours up the road I went while I was
[1:16:01] driving from about you know 99 to 104 in
[1:16:06] the car and my wife stop the car I am
[1:16:10] taking you to the hospital now what
[1:16:14] hospital do you want to go to and the
[1:16:16] only hospital I could think of cuz we'
[1:16:18] been staying with the kids near Kenwick
[1:16:21] Washington or Richland C they call it
[1:16:24] Tri Cities and there's a hospital there
[1:16:27] called
[1:16:28] Cadillac and they deal with all of the
[1:16:31] nuclear people on the Hanford research
[1:16:35] and reactors and all that stuff I said
[1:16:38] take me to Cadillac because I think
[1:16:40] they're probably pretty
[1:16:42] smart because they deal with all the
[1:16:44] radiation people and so she took me
[1:16:47] there and that night as The Story Goes
[1:16:49] because when I got there I thought the
[1:16:52] ER was full and I thought oh no I don't
[1:16:57] know how long I can make it sit here but
[1:17:00] the nurse got up from the desk and said
[1:17:02] come with me she took me back to the
[1:17:05] back and said
[1:17:08] uh you know sit here and I said can I
[1:17:11] lay down and she said yes she was going
[1:17:13] to do the blood pressure and how they
[1:17:15] start the different stuff and about
[1:17:18] there I passed
[1:17:20] out and I don't remember a whole lot for
[1:17:23] the first couple of days but my wife's
[1:17:25] story is that just how God arranges
[1:17:30] things and how that that particular
[1:17:34] night since it was going into you know
[1:17:36] the US Thanksgiving
[1:17:38] holiday everybody wanted to be with
[1:17:40] their families everybody's gone the best
[1:17:44] back
[1:17:45] surgeon supposedly in the Pacific
[1:17:48] Northwest was on duty that night in
[1:17:52] ER and he immediately checked me and
[1:17:55] sent me to uh an MRI and that kind of
[1:17:59] stuff told my wife we've got to do
[1:18:01] emergency surgery we don't know at that
[1:18:05] point they didn't know what was causing
[1:18:07] it but he said it's turning your
[1:18:09] husband's backbone into like
[1:18:12] jello and it had at that point it had
[1:18:15] crushed my spinal cord to where I had no
[1:18:17] legs left I I just there was no feeling
[1:18:22] and and I couldn't walk I couldn't
[1:18:24] anything and so he got with a couple
[1:18:27] other doctors and and they uh her terms
[1:18:32] is that the doctor and the
[1:18:35] anesthesiologist almost got in a fight
[1:18:38] because my vitals had gone so low the
[1:18:41] anesthesiologist said that uh if I put
[1:18:43] him to sleep I may not be able to wake
[1:18:45] him up and she said the doctor finally
[1:18:49] convinced him if you don't put him to
[1:18:51] sleep he's probably not going to
[1:18:54] live until morning because if that
[1:18:58] infection by then they'd figured out it
[1:18:59] was an
[1:19:00] infection pierces the outer coating of
[1:19:03] the spinal cord it was crushed it or was
[1:19:05] holding it like this uh but if it pieres
[1:19:09] the spinal cord he's gone in 45 minutes
[1:19:12] because it'll go straight to the brain
[1:19:13] and
[1:19:14] finished so they did surgery they took
[1:19:17] out part of my backbone I'm about two
[1:19:19] inches shorter than I used to be and I
[1:19:22] keep trying to get back up there but
[1:19:25] there's just pieces missing there's just
[1:19:28] and uh their prognosis was if I survived
[1:19:33] the
[1:19:34] surgery I would I might be in bed
[1:19:37] perhaps for the rest of my life because
[1:19:39] sometimes it turns people to vegetarian
[1:19:42] status vegetable status and and but if
[1:19:46] you know
[1:19:47] after a year 2 years this was they had
[1:19:50] different predictions that you know I
[1:19:53] might be able to get into a wheelchair
[1:19:55] with tons of therapy and all those kind
[1:19:58] of
[1:19:59] things we
[1:20:04] had my daughter started putting
[1:20:07] out you know showing
[1:20:10] pictures of us there in the
[1:20:13] hospital with just brief emails to
[1:20:16] different countries that I'd been
[1:20:18] to there were people praying for us from
[1:20:22] around the world
[1:20:24] and how God works with these kind of
[1:20:27] predictions and pretty much they didn't
[1:20:29] think we would ever walk
[1:20:31] again and uh I guess long story short we
[1:20:36] walked out of the hospital on the
[1:20:37] seventh day using one of those little
[1:20:40] metal
[1:20:42] Walkers the hospital said it was so
[1:20:46] impossible that when we went to make
[1:20:48] arrangements to start paying an
[1:20:51] $80,000 us
[1:20:53] hospital bill they gave us a little te
[1:20:57] letter that said the board of directors
[1:20:58] says you owe us nothing just go away
[1:21:02] because they'd never seen or anything
[1:21:05] quite like that in that hospital and so
[1:21:09] when I gave this story to this Zulu
[1:21:12] brother there that we were staying with
[1:21:15] he said would you please give this
[1:21:17] testimony to my uh my people because we
[1:21:21] have some people and some that are quite
[1:21:24] serious and so I told them that uh we
[1:21:29] gave the testimony and they have
[1:21:32] jumpers uh I want to I can't think of
[1:21:35] the the name of what they are but in the
[1:21:37] services they'll jump and they'll
[1:21:39] whistle and they'll do kind of a sufis I
[1:21:43] guess they call them they're a tribe
[1:21:45] that's there with the the with and
[1:21:47] around the Zulus and and so they will
[1:21:49] jump and they'll shout and sing in
[1:21:51] church and and so we were having I'm
[1:21:53] just having a good time I love these
[1:21:56] folks uh and so when I got to the end of
[1:22:00] given this the testimony of how God
[1:22:02] raised this up uh I said so if you've
[1:22:05] never seen one seen a miracle I said
[1:22:08] they look like this and I jumped about
[1:22:10] three times and H they got so excited
[1:22:15] and when I got ready to leave the
[1:22:18] country the deacons they stopped by this
[1:22:20] one Deacon's house and there was they
[1:22:23] were kind of having a fellowship there
[1:22:26] and one of the deacons comes up and he
[1:22:28] said we like
[1:22:30] you I said well that's nice that's good
[1:22:34] well sometimes in those countries
[1:22:35] because they're so poor when they start
[1:22:38] saying that is they're wanting money and
[1:22:41] I understand because it's the poor
[1:22:44] countries and and so I said well that's
[1:22:46] that that's nice God bless you brother
[1:22:48] so then a little later one of them comes
[1:22:51] up to me again and he said we really
[1:22:53] like
[1:22:54] you I'm
[1:22:57] going okay that's nice and when I got
[1:23:02] right before we got ready to leave a
[1:23:04] couple of them came up and and uh kind
[1:23:08] of cornered me as I was going out the
[1:23:10] door and they said no we really like you
[1:23:13] and what they were hoping is was that
[1:23:15] we'll get back there sometime but he I
[1:23:18] said well why do you keep telling me
[1:23:19] this and cuz I said I don't have any
[1:23:22] money I'm by the time I got home I had
[1:23:25] about $12 in my pocket to my name and uh
[1:23:30] so I said why do you keep telling me
[1:23:32] this and he said well we've only ever
[1:23:34] had two other white men come to our
[1:23:36] church before come to and stay with us
[1:23:39] and they said white man can't jump and
[1:23:41] you jump we like you so that's Africa
[1:23:47] it's a whole different story a lot of
[1:23:49] most of what we've been doing the last
[1:23:51] few years partly because of the coid
[1:23:54] situation has been in Central and South
[1:23:56] America and there are wonderful
[1:23:59] Believers all over this world we spent
[1:24:04] uh I think I've been to Madagascar eight
[1:24:07] times when we first went there it was
[1:24:11] uh as far as we knew even the gospel any
[1:24:15] kind of gospel there was a few Catholic
[1:24:17] churches and a few uh I believe it's
[1:24:20] 7eventh Day Adventist
[1:24:22] that had been able to make a few
[1:24:25] inroads another one that they call FMJ
[1:24:28] which is Full Gospel
[1:24:31] Madagascar and but very little even
[1:24:35] religious stuff going on
[1:24:39] because uh at some point back in history
[1:24:42] there was a queen that threw all
[1:24:44] Christianity out of the country
[1:24:46] completely and it took
[1:24:47] him years and years and years and years
[1:24:50] for anybody to even be allowed back in
[1:24:52] the country but now I know that as far
[1:24:54] as the message of the hour there are
[1:24:57] churches many churches there and one
[1:25:01] place I was told we held open air
[1:25:03] meetings brother nanded and myself and a
[1:25:06] couple other brothers from
[1:25:08] Madagascar we held it in a in a rundown
[1:25:11] broken down uh soccer
[1:25:14] stadium and where we held those meetings
[1:25:17] now they said there's a message Church
[1:25:19] of about a thousand people
[1:25:23] God is still moving God is still doing
[1:25:26] things and he's still calling out the
[1:25:28] bride of Christ so these are kind of
[1:25:30] things we do
[1:25:32] uh when we can and as we can and as the
[1:25:35] Lord directs us and you're part of it
[1:25:39] thank you and God bless you so with that
[1:25:44] in mind you know last night we talked
[1:25:47] about the water I heard there's a few
[1:25:48] visitors here this morning and we talked
[1:25:51] about the water and and how this it's in
[1:25:53] this
[1:25:55] carrier and there's you know water in
[1:25:58] the bottle and the water is there and it
[1:26:01] being transitive in other words you can
[1:26:02] move it around I can move it in the
[1:26:04] bottle or I can move it from the
[1:26:09] bottle and what happened to the water
[1:26:12] well I swallowed some the water's part
[1:26:14] of me and I'm part of the water now but
[1:26:18] with it and I didn't have to ask I
[1:26:20] didn't have to go to the bottle and say
[1:26:21] hey what water I know that for human
[1:26:25] beings there's life in you for me no
[1:26:29] just by drinking it the life comes and
[1:26:32] that's how the word of God should be to
[1:26:34] us as we consume the word of God the
[1:26:39] life comes with
[1:26:41] it and there we didn't really have time
[1:26:43] to get into it last night but there's
[1:26:45] another interesting thing when you go
[1:26:47] into Hebrew and even to a certain extent
[1:26:49] with the
[1:26:50] Greek and if if you you know you have a
[1:26:53] a Hebrew or Greek dictionary you run
[1:26:55] into places where it'll say uh
[1:26:58] superimposition it'll use that word or
[1:27:01] it'll use
[1:27:03] reversals and so as we think of the word
[1:27:06] of God and that's it's actually another
[1:27:09] concept we didn't get
[1:27:11] into but it's the reversal here is okay
[1:27:15] The Water Gave me Life when I drank it I
[1:27:18] didn't have to ask for it it just gives
[1:27:20] it to
[1:27:21] me
[1:27:24] but the reversal or the concept of
[1:27:27] reversal is now that life is being part
[1:27:31] imparted to
[1:27:32] you through his
[1:27:38] life and it's kind of like that door
[1:27:41] back there the brothers sitting
[1:27:44] by and you'll find many things in the
[1:27:46] scripture that it is way when they talk
[1:27:49] about the coming of the Lord
[1:27:52] it's also a going because when you came
[1:27:56] through that door this morning you were
[1:27:58] going away from somewhere
[1:28:01] else so your coming here was a going
[1:28:05] depending on the location which you put
[1:28:08] it and the now the superimposition or
[1:28:12] superimposed that that's pretty easy and
[1:28:14] we've been talking about that how the
[1:28:16] gospel has different layers to it and
[1:28:19] simply what it means is this Bible is
[1:28:22] now superimposed or on top
[1:28:25] of this Pulpit which is superimposed
[1:28:28] upon that carpet which is superimposed
[1:28:31] upon the
[1:28:32] floor so it's easy to see in that
[1:28:36] respect there's different
[1:28:38] levels and so it is with the gospel we
[1:28:42] find it in different levels and
[1:28:44] sometimes it can have
[1:28:45] reversals that we go wow that life
[1:28:48] didn't just come this way but now it
[1:28:51] goes back this way way and it can do it
[1:28:53] at the same
[1:28:54] time that's a paradox to me I just go
[1:28:58] wow Lord how amazing is that so we'll
[1:29:02] get uh let's stand for a moment we'll
[1:29:04] read a couple of
[1:29:05] scriptures and uh now that you know a
[1:29:08] little bit about us and what we do God
[1:29:11] bless you
[1:29:13] and thank you for your service to the
[1:29:16] Lord we'll start with
[1:29:20] uh let's just pray first gracious
[1:29:23] Heavenly Father we there's much
[1:29:26] information laid before us and uh tried
[1:29:30] to fill in those that are visitors or
[1:29:32] those who weren't with us last night or
[1:29:34] the night before whatever it might have
[1:29:36] been but
[1:29:38] father I'm asking you to take Divine
[1:29:41] control of this
[1:29:43] service as we approach this word this
[1:29:46] word is superimposed Upon Our
[1:29:49] Lives superimposed within us as even it
[1:29:55] said the kingdom of God is in
[1:29:58] you so allow that Kingdom of Jesus
[1:30:02] Christ now to come from within us to
[1:30:04] feed your sheep take this vessel get me
[1:30:07] out of the way and Speak Lord that they
[1:30:10] can be filled with your life that they
[1:30:13] too can reverse it and give it to
[1:30:15] someone else we thank you and Praise You
[1:30:19] In The Name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:30:22] in Psalms the 33rd
[1:30:38] chapter and we'll pick it
[1:30:42] up at the sixth
[1:30:45] verse so Psalms
[1:30:48] 33:6 by the word of the Lord were the
[1:30:51] heavens made in the host of them by the
[1:30:53] breath of his mouth he gathers the
[1:30:56] Waters of the sea together as a heap he
[1:30:58] lays up the depth in storehouses let all
[1:31:01] the Earth fear the lord let all the
[1:31:04] inhabitants of the world stand in awe of
[1:31:08] him I do that a lot for he spoke and it
[1:31:12] was done he
[1:31:14] commanded and it stood
[1:31:16] fast gracious Heavenly Father we've read
[1:31:19] your word may you grant us strength
[1:31:21] strength and life through Jesus Christ
[1:31:24] amen please be
[1:31:28] seated so we have again a concept and
[1:31:32] and as we spoke the first night I find
[1:31:35] most of the time I don't read a lot of
[1:31:37] quotes I use a lot of scriptures because
[1:31:39] they reinforce the
[1:31:42] concept and the concept here is that
[1:31:44] whenever God speaks something it's done
[1:31:47] amen it will come to pass it might not
[1:31:51] come to pass the way I think it is or
[1:31:53] the way you think it is but God will
[1:31:55] bring it to pass and once it goes into
[1:31:58] the universe or into what we think of as
[1:32:01] the
[1:32:02] universe it continues and continues and
[1:32:06] continues like the light we spoke about
[1:32:09] we mentioned the light and how that the
[1:32:11] light when he said let there be light it
[1:32:13] never
[1:32:15] stopped the word of God is still
[1:32:18] creating light here this
[1:32:20] morning it's in this case it it's not
[1:32:23] natural light but outside those windows
[1:32:25] it's natural light there's all different
[1:32:28] forms of light that have gone out and
[1:32:30] they're continuing in these lights that
[1:32:32] are on right now it's not even the same
[1:32:34] light that you experienced when you
[1:32:36] walked in the
[1:32:37] service because the word of God is
[1:32:40] continuing and continuing to create
[1:32:44] light and so when God speaks it it says
[1:32:47] it's done and he commands it and it
[1:32:51] stands
[1:32:52] fast well a lot of times people kind of
[1:32:54] put the period there and say that means
[1:32:57] it's done with no if I'm standing here
[1:33:00] well you know if we put it into time you
[1:33:03] know I've probably been too long already
[1:33:05] I don't know but it's it Lord will and
[1:33:09] it's going to
[1:33:12] continue and how that and how
[1:33:16] that it continues through time it
[1:33:19] continues to develop and God can use
[1:33:22] those same words over and over and
[1:33:25] over to display this different things
[1:33:29] they it can be a prophecy of a of a
[1:33:31] particular moment a particular time but
[1:33:34] that also can show itself as prophecy
[1:33:37] going through time and repeating over
[1:33:41] and over and being reversed and go going
[1:33:44] into reversal and going back to what was
[1:33:47] originally said to show us a nature to
[1:33:51] show us
[1:33:53] the mind of God behind it or the soul
[1:33:56] which is the nature so let's turn to
[1:33:58] Genesis the 49th chapter and just take a
[1:34:01] look at how some of this
[1:34:06] works we mentioned this part of this the
[1:34:09] other
[1:34:10] night and that was when David got on top
[1:34:14] of the Philistine uh uh Goliath and cut
[1:34:17] off his head and we use the eth verse of
[1:34:20] chapter 49 Judah Thou Art he whom thy
[1:34:23] Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be
[1:34:25] in the neck of the enemies which
[1:34:26] literally means to sever the head and
[1:34:29] thy father's children shall bow down
[1:34:31] before thee and how that David fulfilled
[1:34:35] all three of those portions of that
[1:34:37] scripture in the life of David because
[1:34:40] his brother his Brethren praised him he
[1:34:43] cut off the head of the enemy and the
[1:34:45] children bowed down before him in
[1:34:50] Chronicles when both both uh Judah and
[1:34:53] Israel come together and they anoint him
[1:34:55] King they bow before David as king so we
[1:34:59] see here was a scripture in Genesis
[1:35:03] that's going out from the prophet Jacob
[1:35:05] to his son
[1:35:07] Judah and but we find it
[1:35:10] fulfilled I guess roughly 600 years
[1:35:14] later and so we're going to look just
[1:35:17] for a moment to see this again just a
[1:35:21] above there because it's a different
[1:35:23] it's almost more of a curse than a
[1:35:26] blessing and it's to Simeon and
[1:35:29] Levi Simeon and Levi are Brethren I'm
[1:35:32] starting in verse 5 are Brethren
[1:35:34] instruments of Cruelty are in their
[1:35:37] habitations that's not the nicest thing
[1:35:39] to say about
[1:35:40] them oh my soul come not thou into their
[1:35:44] secret unto their assembly mine honor be
[1:35:48] not thou United for in their anger they
[1:35:51] slew a man and in their self-will they
[1:35:54] dig down a wall cursed be their anger
[1:35:56] for it was fierce their wrath for it was
[1:35:59] cruel I will divide them in Jacob and
[1:36:02] scatter them in Israel that was the
[1:36:06] prophecy to Simeon and Jacob that I mean
[1:36:09] to Simeon and Levi that came through
[1:36:13] Jacob what a prophecy well we know that
[1:36:17] that prophecy actually goes back to to
[1:36:21] event that had happened that they had
[1:36:23] participated in in their anger they slew
[1:36:26] a man their
[1:36:28] self-will it says they dig down a wall
[1:36:31] so that was something that they had
[1:36:35] performed that was in them and now this
[1:36:39] prophecy that's coming from God through
[1:36:42] Jacob to give them to give a description
[1:36:45] of
[1:36:46] them the power of God to make that
[1:36:50] prophecy not just to cover what they've
[1:36:53] already done but to cover what's going
[1:36:56] to come to pass if God said it we read
[1:36:59] it then he brings it to pass he's going
[1:37:03] to bring to pass this prophecy through
[1:37:07] Simeon and Levi well we know he did 400
[1:37:11] years later after they get out of Egypt
[1:37:14] uh when they're coming out of
[1:37:17] Egypt we know that he uh they were
[1:37:20] scatter Ed in
[1:37:22] Israel the Levites were never given a
[1:37:25] portion of the land they were only given
[1:37:28] the Cities of Refuge and those Cities of
[1:37:31] Refuge were scattered throughout the
[1:37:33] land so we see the power behind this
[1:37:36] prophecy and how God brought it to pass
[1:37:40] later on but it even goes beyond that
[1:37:44] because the soul or the nature that's
[1:37:47] being expressed through this
[1:37:50] prophecy it said in your
[1:37:53] uh in your anger you slew a man now
[1:37:58] that's the nature that we find in Levi
[1:38:03] and in Simeon but we're going to deal
[1:38:05] mostly just with Levi here for a few
[1:38:08] moments well what happened future since
[1:38:12] 400 years you know because after this
[1:38:14] prophecy after this scripture they went
[1:38:17] down into Egypt it says for 400 years so
[1:38:21] for 400 years they are in Egypt and this
[1:38:27] prophecy's laying there but it's not
[1:38:30] just laying there and
[1:38:32] finished God is using all of the
[1:38:37] events and all of creation is coming
[1:38:41] into uh
[1:38:43] submission as it were to this
[1:38:47] prophecy them being in Egypt that's part
[1:38:50] of of this prophecy cuz God had made a
[1:38:53] pro another prophecy to Abraham and said
[1:38:55] your seed's going to go down in a
[1:38:57] Strange Land for 400 years afterwards he
[1:39:00] said I will bring them
[1:39:03] out so he said God is going to bring
[1:39:06] them out but there's a 400e time span
[1:39:09] between when this is you know over 400
[1:39:12] years from the time that this prophecy
[1:39:14] is given until something else happens
[1:39:18] with Levi can I take this off
[1:39:22] I told the people at home I I don't wear
[1:39:25] suit coats very often so the last time I
[1:39:27] did I said take a picture because it's
[1:39:30] probably going to be a while again
[1:39:31] before you see me in one of those and
[1:39:34] now here I go again back with the
[1:39:36] sleeves this means we're getting
[1:39:40] serious and
[1:39:42] so here it is like over 400 years later
[1:39:47] this prophecy still exists and the power
[1:39:51] behind this prophecy is about to take a
[1:39:56] new
[1:39:57] turn because when you go into the book
[1:40:00] of Exodus and remember this is 400 years
[1:40:04] later it talks
[1:40:07] about and there went a man of the house
[1:40:10] of Levi I'm in Exodus chapter 2 and
[1:40:14] there went a man of the house of Levi
[1:40:16] and took to a wife a daughter of
[1:40:19] Levi whoa oh that's pretty pretty
[1:40:23] levitical strain yes a man of Levi and
[1:40:28] he takes a wife of Levi and the woman
[1:40:31] conceived and bear a son and when she
[1:40:33] saw him that he was a goodly child she
[1:40:36] hid him three months what are we talking
[1:40:38] about who is this speaking
[1:40:41] of what is Moses he is a levite he is a
[1:40:47] son
[1:40:48] generationally of this prophecy
[1:40:51] that God gave through Jacob 400 years
[1:40:56] previous and the
[1:40:58] nature behind the
[1:41:02] prophecy well we know that Moses was
[1:41:04] spared the you know from the crocodiles
[1:41:07] from the Crocs as we say when we're
[1:41:10] overseas he spared from the Crocs and
[1:41:13] and uh that how he was taken into
[1:41:17] Pharaoh's household all of these things
[1:41:20] but when it comes to a certain place in
[1:41:26] time when he sees his Brethren and his
[1:41:30] children these Hebrews those who were as
[1:41:34] we looked at that definition last night
[1:41:36] one from Beyond these were people that
[1:41:40] from The Eyes Of God they're with him
[1:41:42] they're his children and so when he sees
[1:41:46] them in this bondage and he sees how
[1:41:48] they're be being treated and he
[1:41:52] realizes that there is also a seed of
[1:41:55] Deliverance in him why I'm the great
[1:41:58] Moses I'm second you know to to
[1:42:01] Pharaoh a and I have all this power and
[1:42:05] all this stuff and so I'm going to
[1:42:08] deliver the children of Israel he
[1:42:10] doesn't exactly maybe know how at that
[1:42:12] point in time but what's the first thing
[1:42:14] he does he slays a
[1:42:19] man think about it
[1:42:21] the prophecy was in your anger you slew
[1:42:24] a man then when he saw that man beating
[1:42:27] one of the Hebrew children his anger he
[1:42:31] slew a
[1:42:32] in that's the life of that prophecy
[1:42:36] moving through
[1:42:38] history but it doesn't stop there well
[1:42:41] we know because of that anger and
[1:42:43] because of that this is how God can turn
[1:42:46] around even the he can reverse the
[1:42:49] things what looks like a bad
[1:42:52] scene you know I don't know what the uh
[1:42:56] I'm thinking an an Egyptian killing a
[1:42:58] Hebrew you know that might have had a
[1:43:00] death penalty we don't exactly know but
[1:43:03] Moses had to get out of
[1:43:05] there and we know how he went into the
[1:43:08] Wilderness he was there 40 years and uh
[1:43:12] then God gets a hold of
[1:43:14] him God gets a hold of Moses he we we've
[1:43:17] heard the story The Burning Bush and how
[1:43:20] that Moses was there before the burning
[1:43:22] bush and and God spoke to him and said
[1:43:25] you're going to go down and you know I'm
[1:43:27] going to deliver the people but you're
[1:43:29] going to be the way I do
[1:43:31] it Moses go down and be a God to those
[1:43:35] people so Moses goes
[1:43:38] down and he
[1:43:40] does the you know there's this plague
[1:43:43] and that plague and all those things
[1:43:44] that happen and that comes to a place
[1:43:48] again where
[1:43:52] God's getting tired but he's getting
[1:43:55] tired of what's going on with Egypt and
[1:43:58] Israel because Pharaoh would try to
[1:44:00] repent he would try he was a good make
[1:44:03] believer okay I Repent please please
[1:44:06] just take the frogs away man I can't
[1:44:08] deal with these frogs
[1:44:11] anymore but then a few days later well
[1:44:14] when he saw that the frogs were all
[1:44:16] piled up and stunk and were bringing
[1:44:18] flies on all into his country he all a
[1:44:20] sudden well no I don't repent you're not
[1:44:22] going anywhere and so
[1:44:26] Moses there came a place where that
[1:44:29] prophecy comes again and he said you'll
[1:44:32] not see my
[1:44:33] face again and what happened was
[1:44:36] judgment fell on the firstborn of
[1:44:41] Egypt so God has taken from this
[1:44:44] prophecy brought it through a man we saw
[1:44:47] it manifested once now we see it
[1:44:49] manifested it again because Moses has
[1:44:52] had enough he said you're your firstborn
[1:44:56] they're
[1:44:57] dead because he's had
[1:44:59] enough and then we know how that
[1:45:02] salvation was given unto Israel through
[1:45:05] the Passover Lamb we discussed that a
[1:45:08] little bit last night but we see it
[1:45:10] again and so the whole firstborn of
[1:45:13] Egypt were slain through the mouth of
[1:45:18] Moses a levite who has this trait
[1:45:22] following his
[1:45:24] life you
[1:45:26] understand okay
[1:45:30] so but it doesn't even stop there
[1:45:33] because this is the
[1:45:35] nature of God being expressed through
[1:45:39] his
[1:45:42] prophet and they get into the Wilderness
[1:45:44] they're they get
[1:45:46] out and how that you know this Mighty
[1:45:49] Deliverance God moves the red the Red
[1:45:52] Sea and the armies go in and again
[1:45:54] there's Egyptians slain in the Red Sea
[1:45:58] and how this trait is following this
[1:46:01] levite and how when they get in the
[1:46:03] wilderness now this is the same man that
[1:46:06] killed an Egyptian because of how the
[1:46:10] Hebrews were being treated and they get
[1:46:12] in the wilderness and they begin to CH
[1:46:14] with
[1:46:16] him you brought us out here to
[1:46:19] die wow would that we had stayed in
[1:46:22] Egypt you know Moses what what are you
[1:46:25] doing and so when they begin to chide
[1:46:28] with
[1:46:29] Moses he gets angry
[1:46:32] again and this time God tells him Moses
[1:46:36] go speak to the
[1:46:38] Rock but Moses doesn't speak to the Rock
[1:46:42] he takes his staff and he smites The
[1:46:45] Rock and he not just once he smites it
[1:46:49] twice yeah we know from the message of
[1:46:52] the hour what is that the rock is of
[1:46:54] course Jesus Christ and he is signifying
[1:46:59] the death of Jesus Christ through his
[1:47:03] anger and he said he never should have
[1:47:05] hid it twice because that means that the
[1:47:08] Gentiles would do the same thing that
[1:47:11] the Jews did have you ever heard a
[1:47:13] message called Where They Crucified him
[1:47:17] where the most religious country they
[1:47:19] the most religious people crucified put
[1:47:23] to an open shame him the word of God he
[1:47:26] said who did it was the
[1:47:28] preachers the
[1:47:31] Levites you see that prophecy rolling
[1:47:34] through history well and we go back to
[1:47:37] even the time when Jesus Christ was on
[1:47:41] Earth and how
[1:47:43] that that in his anger he slew a man and
[1:47:48] there from there and here it's that
[1:47:50] trait that is it's moving moving moving
[1:47:53] all the way through history and it comes
[1:47:55] down to Jesus Christ and here are these
[1:47:58] scribes and Pharisees the Levites the
[1:48:01] the the preachers the ministers as it
[1:48:04] were and and here's Jesus Christ on the
[1:48:07] scene the very Messiah and in their
[1:48:11] anger in their jealousy in in all of
[1:48:15] that what did they do they killed a
[1:48:18] man they killed him
[1:48:21] they killed Jesus Christ because that
[1:48:24] seed that was sown in Genesis has now
[1:48:28] moved all the way through history and
[1:48:31] the Levites kill the Lord Jesus
[1:48:37] Christ whatever God says it stands fast
[1:48:41] and then it moves all the way through
[1:48:43] the times of the Gentiles until God
[1:48:46] sends as it were the pillar of fire back
[1:48:51] he sends it to the Gentiles it was there
[1:48:54] in the days of Paul and he brings it
[1:48:55] back in our
[1:48:58] day and how that through denominational
[1:49:02] Creed and dogma and all those
[1:49:04] things the way he said it he said they
[1:49:07] have made the word of God of none
[1:49:10] effect they have made it to where people
[1:49:14] don't or won't receive the fullness of
[1:49:19] what this word of God God is doing
[1:49:22] they've killed the word of God
[1:49:26] again and how that for those that we
[1:49:30] call it the select or uh the elected as
[1:49:34] it calls it in the book of Ephesians for
[1:49:37] those that can receive it it is eternal
[1:49:41] life it is well it's Rapture to be what
[1:49:45] is the most common word used or
[1:49:48] change or
[1:49:51] uh what's the it's not transcend but uh
[1:49:55] transformed that's another word another
[1:49:58] words that's a changing
[1:50:01] process like they take electricity that
[1:50:04] on those great big lines and they
[1:50:06] transform
[1:50:08] it until you can plug your cell phone in
[1:50:11] without blowing it
[1:50:13] up because it's the life that's in that
[1:50:16] electricity electric energy being
[1:50:19] transformed down to where it's usable
[1:50:21] for you and I and the word of God does
[1:50:25] that over and
[1:50:29] over and
[1:50:35] so started
[1:50:37] out this morning early as we were
[1:50:41] studying through a few things if we were
[1:50:43] to give this message a name this
[1:50:46] morning I would just simply call it
[1:50:49] delivered
[1:50:51] and we'll go
[1:50:53] now if we're in full understanding of
[1:50:56] this concept of how God can put it out
[1:50:59] there and the nature of that word
[1:51:01] concerning those particular
[1:51:03] people continues that nature goes on and
[1:51:07] on and on and on but there is like we
[1:51:09] said with the light it'll produce light
[1:51:12] throughout eternity unless God says
[1:51:14] stop and for the Levites There's Hope
[1:51:17] because in Zachariah it says he shall
[1:51:21] purify that's a refining fire the sons
[1:51:25] of Levi for them there's a
[1:51:28] stop so praise the Lord for that
[1:51:31] one but that's just how God can take and
[1:51:35] use something over and over and he can
[1:51:37] even
[1:51:38] reverse as it were the uh
[1:51:43] consequences for the
[1:51:45] elect and so I'd like to read from yeah
[1:51:49] man we're just getting into the message
[1:51:51] brother he told me to take my Liberty
[1:51:57] but and let's go to Isaiah for just a
[1:52:00] moment since I said we we'll call this
[1:52:02] delivered and I think in a minute you'll
[1:52:04] see or in a few moments you'll see why
[1:52:07] 66
[1:52:10] Isaiah and we're
[1:52:12] preaching Concepts or a
[1:52:16] concept of God's word being used over
[1:52:19] and over
[1:52:20] and having different layers this is
[1:52:22] layered on top of this on top of that
[1:52:25] and the word of God is that
[1:52:28] way and so in Isaiah
[1:52:31] 66 we'll start at the sixth
[1:52:36] verse he says a
[1:52:39] voice of noise from the city a voice
[1:52:42] from the temple a voice of the Lord that
[1:52:45] render with recompense to his enemy and
[1:52:48] immediately we can see three different
[1:52:52] levels or three different manifestations
[1:52:56] of this voice one's in the temple one's
[1:52:58] in the city and one is to bring
[1:53:01] recompense to the rendering recompense
[1:53:04] to the
[1:53:06] enemies and so then we go into verse 7
[1:53:10] and it says before she travailed
[1:53:12] travailed she brought
[1:53:14] forth and there's those another concept
[1:53:17] there those two dots has a time frame
[1:53:20] before her pain came she was delivered
[1:53:22] of a Manchild who hath heard such a
[1:53:25] thing who hath seen such things who
[1:53:28] shall the Earth be made to bring forth
[1:53:30] in one day or shall the nation be born
[1:53:32] at once for as soon as Zion prevailed
[1:53:34] she brought forth her children and we
[1:53:37] see it again here's four
[1:53:41] questions who's heard this who's seen it
[1:53:45] and the word there I believe relates to
[1:53:46] a vision so we know it's moved from
[1:53:50] who's heard it in the natural or who has
[1:53:52] perceived it as it
[1:53:55] were uh by natural understanding who's
[1:54:01] seen it who's or who's heard it who's
[1:54:03] seen it so it takes it to the
[1:54:05] supernatural level and then it takes it
[1:54:07] back to another level as of the whole
[1:54:10] earth in one sense shall the uh shall
[1:54:15] the Earth be made to bring forth in one
[1:54:18] day but then we look back and we see
[1:54:22] friends we're made from this
[1:54:24] Earth we are part of this prophecy
[1:54:28] because we're
[1:54:29] part of the earth bringing forth God
[1:54:33] bringing forth
[1:54:35] himself in earn
[1:54:38] vessels but dropping up just before that
[1:54:41] and and again think about reversals and
[1:54:45] how God can change things around and we
[1:54:47] talked a little bit last night about
[1:54:49] Hebrew and how we read right to left but
[1:54:51] they read left to right and how brother
[1:54:53] brandham said you can change the
[1:54:55] position of the words and he says it
[1:54:57] doesn't uh necessarily change the
[1:55:00] meaning but it changes the way that we
[1:55:03] look at what it
[1:55:04] says and in verse 7 I find it
[1:55:07] interesting because if you reverse the
[1:55:09] second half of that that
[1:55:12] prophecy instead of a before her came
[1:55:15] came she was delivered of a Manchild it
[1:55:17] would be she was delivered of a
[1:55:21] Manchild before her pain
[1:55:28] came that puts us in a double Paradox if
[1:55:33] you just reverse it because not only
[1:55:37] does she bring forth a Manchild she is
[1:55:40] delivered of the
[1:55:43] Manchild where does our deliverance come
[1:55:47] from the Manchild Jesus Jesus
[1:55:50] Christ but it says before she travailed
[1:55:54] she's already brought forth the
[1:55:57] child regardless of which direction you
[1:56:00] look at it she hasn't even travailed yet
[1:56:05] and the word travail there I find it's
[1:56:07] very interesting because it can mean to
[1:56:09] twist to wind together also means rest
[1:56:13] and pain and uh to bring forth or beget
[1:56:17] children to Bear Young
[1:56:21] but it's also the same word that's used
[1:56:25] when uh it says that I was
[1:56:28] conceived in my mother's womb in sin and
[1:56:32] iniquity I think it's Psalms I probably
[1:56:35] wrote it down you 51 we can look at it
[1:56:39] real C quick
[1:56:42] like because it's the same
[1:56:45] word that's used
[1:56:48] there is used
[1:56:52] here praise the
[1:56:56] Lord
[1:56:58] 51 yes behold I was shapen in iniquity
[1:57:02] and in sended my mother conceived me
[1:57:05] it's the same word in that particular
[1:57:09] place as far as this travailing or
[1:57:12] bringing forth so then it says
[1:57:15] uh when it uses the word they're
[1:57:18] delivered
[1:57:20] she was delivered of this
[1:57:25] child the word there is not necessarily
[1:57:29] what we think it
[1:57:30] is because it literally means to slip
[1:57:34] away or to escape I'm back in 66
[1:57:38] Brothers I'm
[1:57:41] sorry before she trailed she brought
[1:57:45] forth and she was delivered of a
[1:57:47] Manchild she slipped away she escaped
[1:57:50] escaped she was smooth and
[1:57:53] slippery she brought forth or she left
[1:57:57] out or she was let go so what do we be
[1:58:02] begin to see we're talking about a bride
[1:58:04] of Jesus Christ delivered by a
[1:58:08] Manchild and yet she is the one that
[1:58:11] brought forth this Manchild if we turn
[1:58:13] it back around so we see the double
[1:58:16] meaning or the reversal of how God can
[1:58:19] take one thing and make it more than one
[1:58:23] make it have as it were a double meaning
[1:58:27] she was delivered she leapt out she was
[1:58:30] let go she
[1:58:32] escaped of this
[1:58:35] Manchild and when it talks about the
[1:58:38] Manchild there the word again it means
[1:58:41] remembered or called to mind recorded or
[1:58:45] a
[1:58:47] memorial so this Manchild has a
[1:58:52] memory a recorded
[1:58:55] memory and this bringing forth or this
[1:58:58] Deliverance comes and we look at
[1:59:01] Ephesians to find out what was this all
[1:59:05] about this Manchild that this bride or
[1:59:08] this woman is bearing has as it were
[1:59:12] been
[1:59:14] remembered and the word there in
[1:59:17] Ephesians the first chapter
[1:59:23] goes like
[1:59:27] this says according blessed be the God
[1:59:31] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:59:33] hath blessed us with all spiritual
[1:59:34] blessings and Heavenly places in Christ
[1:59:37] according as he hath chosen Us in
[1:59:40] him before the foundation of the world
[1:59:45] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:59:48] before him in love of being
[1:59:50] predestinated having predestinated us
[1:59:52] under the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:59:54] Christ to himself according to the good
[1:59:56] pleasure of his will so there is a
[2:00:00] memory within this child and we find
[2:00:03] that I believe in uh when the the thief
[2:00:06] on the cross they the thieves and
[2:00:09] they're railing on Jesus and finally the
[2:00:11] one Thief turns to the other and he said
[2:00:13] are you crazy we deserve what we're
[2:00:15] getting but he doesn't deserve it and he
[2:00:18] turns and he said Lord remember me he
[2:00:22] touched on the memory of
[2:00:27] God and the
[2:00:29] predestination of God according to his
[2:00:33] good pleasure and he took good
[2:00:36] pleasure to turn to that thief and said
[2:00:39] this day you'll be with me in
[2:00:45] Paradise he touched the memory of God
[2:00:50] and when he touched that memory it
[2:00:52] brought him eternal life we talked about
[2:00:55] him the other night can you imagine
[2:00:56] getting over to the other side and
[2:00:58] there's all these people and all these
[2:00:59] testimonies they go how did you get here
[2:01:02] I don't
[2:01:03] know I just said the right thing I guess
[2:01:05] to the right person at the right time
[2:01:08] and here he is with no testimony
[2:01:10] testimony his testimony was being a
[2:01:12] thief but here he is in
[2:01:15] heaven by the grace and the power of God
[2:01:21] so we' said these things and I I'll give
[2:01:24] you one more part of that Prophecy from
[2:01:27] Isaiah because it said when
[2:01:29] Zion uh I better read it because I'll
[2:01:32] get it backwards
[2:01:37] here for as soon as Zion travailed she
[2:01:40] brought forth her children and Zion
[2:01:43] there actually means a parched place
[2:01:46] it's prophetic word for Jerusalem a
[2:01:48] mountain Mountain a signpost a monument
[2:01:51] dryness drought Barren desert a solitary
[2:01:55] place and Jesus when he was going up to
[2:02:00] Calvary and the the women were bewailing
[2:02:02] him he said don't don't wail for me he
[2:02:06] said wail for yourselves because if this
[2:02:08] is what they're doing to the tree when
[2:02:10] it's green what are they going to do
[2:02:13] when it's
[2:02:14] dry remember that scripture
[2:02:17] yes he said what are they going to do to
[2:02:20] that tree when it's dry friends we're in
[2:02:22] the age of the dry
[2:02:24] tree the dry
[2:02:28] Vine and
[2:02:31] so uh but we're in this also this
[2:02:35] travailing period in which the male is
[2:02:39] being born in us that we can bring forth
[2:02:42] the male again through the life that's
[2:02:47] in the water
[2:02:49] of this
[2:02:50] book the word of
[2:02:53] God so with that
[2:02:56] concept not too much
[2:02:59] longer but
[2:03:01] delivered let's look at second
[2:03:04] Timothy and bring this down to our age
[2:03:07] because right now we we've kind of been
[2:03:08] jumping around different ages and and
[2:03:11] things so let's
[2:03:13] watch how God can take that same
[2:03:17] word and bring bring it right down to
[2:03:20] where we're living right now and that's
[2:03:23] in second
[2:03:25] Timothy and if you never been here this
[2:03:28] morning I'm sure some of this might you
[2:03:30] might be scratching your head going
[2:03:32] what's this guy talking about well God
[2:03:36] bless
[2:03:37] you in second Timothy the 4th
[2:03:42] chapter and the 16th verse it's talking
[2:03:46] here uh the Apostle Paul has been
[2:03:49] uh rewarded as it were he's been had
[2:03:52] much evil done to him by Alexander the
[2:03:57] coppersmith and he comes down to verse
[2:03:59] 16 and he says at my first answer no man
[2:04:02] stood with me but all men forsook me I
[2:04:05] pray God that it might not be laid to
[2:04:07] their
[2:04:08] charge what is happening in this
[2:04:11] scripture now Paul as we know him as our
[2:04:15] first church age Messenger to the
[2:04:17] Gentiles because most of this new
[2:04:19] testament uh beyond the four gospels is
[2:04:23] written by the Apostle Paul and we know
[2:04:25] it's Christ there on the scene in a
[2:04:28] different form am morha in the pillar of
[2:04:31] fire Paul said I was born out of season
[2:04:34] I never got to meet that fleshly man of
[2:04:37] Jesus but I met the the man that came to
[2:04:40] me was in as it were a light a pillar of
[2:04:43] fire however you want to view that and
[2:04:45] it even blinded him and he had to be
[2:04:47] prayed for to get part of his eyesight
[2:04:51] back and but he said that light spoke to
[2:04:54] him I am Jesus when Paul said who and
[2:04:58] Jesus said I am Jesus Paul why do you
[2:05:00] kick against against the Pricks why are
[2:05:03] you doing this and we see now here Paul
[2:05:06] under
[2:05:08] persecution says nobody stood with me
[2:05:11] who's speaking
[2:05:13] this this is Christ speaking through
[2:05:17] Paul the Christ of that Pillar of Fire
[2:05:20] this time the god of the
[2:05:23] Gentiles Jesus of the Gentiles is now
[2:05:26] speaking nobody stood with me all men
[2:05:30] forsook me Jesus Christ was absolutely
[2:05:34] forsaken by Earth and by heaven when he
[2:05:37] hung on Calvary as he hung between
[2:05:41] heavens and earth and he was completely
[2:05:44] forsaken by man and he was forsaken by
[2:05:48] God by his own words my God my God why
[2:05:52] hast Thou forsaken
[2:05:54] me yes okay so he is speaking by way of
[2:06:00] the spirit of God and what was the last
[2:06:03] thing I believe it was that Jesus said
[2:06:05] father forgive them they don't know what
[2:06:08] they're
[2:06:09] doing and here is God speaking again God
[2:06:14] don't lay this to their
[2:06:17] charge it's Christ brother
[2:06:21] sister God lay it not to their charge
[2:06:24] and it's also showing us that this
[2:06:26] Apostle Paul has the spirit of Christ on
[2:06:31] him and it's Christ bringing himself
[2:06:34] through history from the natural fleshly
[2:06:37] man into the supernatural man of the
[2:06:39] pillar of Fire or the light that came to
[2:06:42] Paul and Paul is now how do we know that
[2:06:45] because it's displaying the same nature
[2:06:48] just like like with Levi that displayed
[2:06:51] the same nature all the way through
[2:06:52] history now Christ is displaying his
[2:06:56] nature through the Apostle
[2:06:59] Paul but then he goes on to say not
[2:07:02] withstanding the Lord stood with me and
[2:07:04] strengthened Me That by my by me the
[2:07:09] preaching might be fully known and that
[2:07:11] all the Gentiles might hear what's the
[2:07:14] purpose of God doing this with Paul and
[2:07:17] with this spirit ir and this nature of
[2:07:20] this spirit being with Paul it's so that
[2:07:23] all the Gentiles might hear did not
[2:07:26] Jesus say until this gospel has gone to
[2:07:29] Every Creature every tongue Every Nation
[2:07:31] every
[2:07:33] tribe this was what Paul was all about
[2:07:37] displaying Christ so that Christ could
[2:07:40] be seen that's what these letters Titus
[2:07:43] Timothy Hebrews all those things are
[2:07:46] about God wants to display play his
[2:07:49] nature to the entire
[2:07:52] Earth that by me the preaching might be
[2:07:55] fully known that all the Gentiles might
[2:07:58] hear and then there's those two dots
[2:08:01] again and we know that denotes a time
[2:08:03] frame we don't know how long those time
[2:08:06] frames are the one that I'm most
[2:08:08] familiar with was when uh the priest
[2:08:11] gave the book to uh brother Branham
[2:08:15] brother William Branham and he spoke
[2:08:20] he said there's two 2,000 years between
[2:08:22] those two dots because Jesus only read
[2:08:25] so far and then sat down and he said but
[2:08:28] now we are to speak judgment and he said
[2:08:32] as he read the rest of that prophecy in
[2:08:35] Isaiah he said there was 2,000 years
[2:08:37] between those two dots so we see a time
[2:08:40] frame here and the last thing he said I
[2:08:43] was
[2:08:44] delivered out of the mouth of the Lion
[2:08:49] what a strange
[2:08:50] scripture here he's talking about he's
[2:08:52] been in under persecution and he's
[2:08:54] saying forgive him Lord they don't mean
[2:08:57] to be doing this a and nevertheless
[2:09:01] you've been you stood by me and I and
[2:09:03] we're doing this preaching so that all
[2:09:05] the Gentiles might hear and then there's
[2:09:08] this time frame and the last thing he
[2:09:11] said I was delivered out of the mouth of
[2:09:13] the lion do you know what he's talking
[2:09:16] about in the natural sense of the word
[2:09:20] when he was in Ephesus I think it's in
[2:09:22] Corinthians Corinthians that he talks
[2:09:24] about it he goes I fought with the
[2:09:26] beasts in
[2:09:28] Ephesus and God delivered him so from
[2:09:32] the natural sense he's saying I was
[2:09:35] delivered from the mouth of those
[2:09:38] Lions but it goes beyond
[2:09:41] that because as we understand from the
[2:09:44] lions in Amos 3 we can look at it for
[2:09:49] uh
[2:09:55] quickly believe it or not we're almost
[2:09:58] done I think in verse 4 Amos 3:4 will a
[2:10:02] lion roar in the forest when he hath no
[2:10:04] prey will a young lion cry out of his
[2:10:06] den if he's taken nothing and he goes on
[2:10:10] down and said surely God will do nothing
[2:10:12] but he Reveals His secrets to his proph
[2:10:15] servants the prophets in verse 7 the
[2:10:17] lion have roared who will not fear the
[2:10:20] lord God hath spoken who can but
[2:10:23] prophesy so what's this
[2:10:26] lion what is this lion it's the
[2:10:31] prophecies that give us the nature of
[2:10:36] God and Paul said I was delivered out of
[2:10:39] the mouth of the
[2:10:44] lion well in a natural sense Paul was
[2:10:48] absolutely delivered from the beasts
[2:10:50] that he had to face in
[2:10:53] Ephesus but as we begin to understand
[2:10:56] and if we went back to Genesis 49 again
[2:10:59] because that there in verse 9 I believe
[2:11:01] it is it says that he was a young lion
[2:11:03] speaking of the LI the tribe of Judah
[2:11:05] the lineage of Judah he was the Young
[2:11:07] Lion then he's the resting lion and then
[2:11:10] he
[2:11:11] is the lion that says who will call him
[2:11:15] on the scene Rouse him up that's the
[2:11:18] word it uses so we see that's three the
[2:11:22] three comings or three comings of the
[2:11:25] Lord Jesus he's the Lion's WEP from
[2:11:28] because he became the prey and from the
[2:11:30] prey what happened he was resurrected
[2:11:33] and ascended on high he went up he
[2:11:36] stooped down he couched as a lion and if
[2:11:38] you get and as an old lion and when you
[2:11:40] look at that particular verse he was
[2:11:43] when it says couched he was at rest
[2:11:47] what's our rest it's the baptism of the
[2:11:49] Holy Ghost three comings in one
[2:11:53] scripture and what's the last one who
[2:11:55] shall Rouse him up and where do we find
[2:11:57] that you go to the Song of Solomon and
[2:11:59] said don't Rouse him until he's
[2:12:05] ready are you with
[2:12:07] me wow you're really quiet
[2:12:10] today I just got to remember the Sheep
[2:12:13] are
[2:12:15] feeding do you understand how that he
[2:12:18] takes one scripture and he uses that one
[2:12:20] scripture to show us the Life of Christ
[2:12:24] the nature of Christ is to be the Lion's
[2:12:27] wealth to be our rest and to be a
[2:12:30] rapturing
[2:12:33] bridegroom who will Rouse him up or
[2:12:35] bring him on the scene so that we can be
[2:12:38] taken up with
[2:12:43] him praise the Lord you still love me
[2:12:48] are we been too long we're almost done
[2:12:50] actually I know I keep saying that my
[2:12:53] wife says don't tell them that they're
[2:12:55] too
[2:12:57] nice but so as we see the it's this was
[2:13:03] prophecy this is the lion this is Judah
[2:13:06] the
[2:13:07] lion the lion of the tribe of
[2:13:10] Judah and here it's given forth as a
[2:13:13] nature in Prophecy we saw that verse 8
[2:13:18] was
[2:13:19] fulfilled by David and David was as it
[2:13:23] were God showing himself what his
[2:13:25] kingship would look like through the
[2:13:27] life of David and now we come to this
[2:13:30] place and Paul said I was delivered or
[2:13:32] my Deliverance
[2:13:34] came from the mouth of the lion what's
[2:13:38] the lion who can but prophecy
[2:13:42] prophesy the lion is the words of
[2:13:46] Prophecy with the nature of of God
[2:13:48] behind
[2:13:50] them and those prophecies are going to
[2:13:53] Pro produce or to manifest the
[2:13:57] life and the nature of the god that
[2:14:01] speaks
[2:14:02] them and so we see and he said I was
[2:14:05] delivered out of the mouth of the
[2:14:07] lion his Deliverance came out of
[2:14:12] Prophecy and we go to Revelations
[2:14:16] 5 we think of Revelations 10:7 and how
[2:14:21] it said that there would out of the days
[2:14:24] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[2:14:25] he should begin to sound the mystery of
[2:14:27] God should be
[2:14:29] finished from Revelations 10:7 but then
[2:14:32] we come back to now to Revelations chap
[2:14:36] 5 and if we back up just a little
[2:14:39] further he gives us we're familiar most
[2:14:42] everyone here is familiar with the seven
[2:14:44] Church ages and how that in the last age
[2:14:47] of Le oia which means or lady oia means
[2:14:50] people's
[2:14:52] rights and how that we get to the end to
[2:14:56] that Revelation Revelations chapter 3 to
[2:14:58] him that overcome will I grant to sit
[2:15:00] with me in my throne even as I also
[2:15:03] overcame and I'm sat down with my father
[2:15:05] in his throne he that hath an ear let
[2:15:08] him hear what the spirit saith to the
[2:15:13] churches how did Jesus overcome
[2:15:20] he's saying to him that overcome even as
[2:15:24] I overcame friends this is very
[2:15:27] important because if this is how we
[2:15:30] overcome is the same way that Jesus
[2:15:35] overcame how did Jesus
[2:15:39] overcome he
[2:15:41] overcame by the prophecies concerning
[2:15:45] him thou wil not leave my my soul in
[2:15:48] Hell nor suffer my Holy One to seek
[2:15:52] corruption and he could take from that
[2:15:56] prophecy tear this Temple down three
[2:15:59] days I'll raise it up he could look back
[2:16:02] at the prophet Jonah and when they said
[2:16:06] we need a sign he said the only sign you
[2:16:09] get is the sign of the prophet
[2:16:13] Jonah he's prophesying of
[2:16:15] himself he is using using the nature or
[2:16:19] the lion of Prophecy to bring forth his
[2:16:24] own
[2:16:29] Resurrection think about
[2:16:31] it and even when he was on the cross
[2:16:34] they're looking at him going you know
[2:16:36] come down off that cross and they said
[2:16:38] he helped others can he help himself and
[2:16:41] it's hey you know Great Master there on
[2:16:46] Calvary but no
[2:16:48] he was resting in the
[2:16:51] prophecy about him you know tear this
[2:16:56] Temple down I'll raise it up and he was
[2:17:00] looking back at all the prophecies that
[2:17:03] concerned him so much even I believe
[2:17:05] it's Psalms 22 where he said all my
[2:17:08] bones were out of joint I am poured out
[2:17:10] like water pretty much everyone that's a
[2:17:13] Christian believes that talking about
[2:17:15] Jesus
[2:17:16] Christ
[2:17:18] and he was
[2:17:20] resting on those
[2:17:22] promises he was resting on the Promises
[2:17:26] to the
[2:17:28] lion all the way back to Genesis 49
[2:17:33] knowing he becomes the
[2:17:36] prey but he's going to raise again
[2:17:39] because from the prey I go
[2:17:42] up he was risking or betting however you
[2:17:47] want to say said his life that the power
[2:17:51] in that prophecy was enough to pull him
[2:17:54] out of the
[2:17:55] ground because in that prophecy is the
[2:17:58] nature or the power of
[2:18:02] God that's how Jesus
[2:18:05] overcame he recognized himself in this
[2:18:10] book bride of
[2:18:13] Christ and he prophesied his own
[2:18:17] Resurrection
[2:18:18] ction that's how Jesus
[2:18:22] overcame was in the power of the
[2:18:26] Resurrection that he spoke by his own
[2:18:31] mouth that's not skin
[2:18:35] milk we have a spoken word promise a
[2:18:40] third
[2:18:41] pull what are we
[2:18:43] prophesying oh Jesus help me Jesus help
[2:18:46] me or is it it I am a Son of God you are
[2:18:51] Sons you are Daughters of God and the
[2:18:55] power of
[2:18:56] God dwells within
[2:18:59] you so before
[2:19:02] we well let's go ahead and look
[2:19:05] then at chapter
[2:19:09] five because this is actually kind of a
[2:19:12] keynote to
[2:19:15] Deliverance chapter 5 and we'll start
[2:19:17] there at uh verse
[2:19:19] one and I know you've had many good
[2:19:23] preachers here I know that and he said I
[2:19:26] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[2:19:28] the throne a book written within and on
[2:19:30] the backside sealed with Seven Seals and
[2:19:32] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[2:19:35] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[2:19:37] book and loose the seals thereof and no
[2:19:39] man in Heaven Nor in Earth nor under the
[2:19:43] Earth was able to open the book neither
[2:19:45] look thereon there are people that say
[2:19:47] say William brandham opened the seals no
[2:19:50] I beg to differ with you because this
[2:19:53] says no man was sound worthy who opened
[2:19:57] the book was when the angel of the Lord
[2:20:00] came down and used the gift from a
[2:20:02] prophet's
[2:20:04] message and even told that Prophet no
[2:20:07] you're looking at it wrong you got to
[2:20:09] come around this other way to understand
[2:20:12] these Seven Seals and so and there's
[2:20:16] we'll let brother Jonathan talk more
[2:20:18] about that especially to the visitors
[2:20:20] this morning he said so no man was found
[2:20:23] worthy and I wept much because no man
[2:20:26] was found worthy he he repeats it which
[2:20:28] means it's of importance to open and to
[2:20:31] read the book neither to look thereon
[2:20:33] and one of the elders saith unto him
[2:20:35] weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[2:20:40] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[2:20:43] to open the book and loose the Seven
[2:20:45] Seals thereof
[2:20:48] now wait a
[2:20:51] minute
[2:20:52] the the the lion of the tribe of Judah
[2:20:57] well we just had the scripture on the
[2:20:58] board a minute ago what was the lion of
[2:21:00] the tribe of Judah he was the Young Lion
[2:21:03] he was the resting lion and he's the
[2:21:05] lion that's to be roused
[2:21:08] up and wherever he said oh I'll never
[2:21:11] leave you or forsake you wherever I am
[2:21:13] you are
[2:21:16] there
[2:21:19] you're there with him wherever he is and
[2:21:24] I think it's in
[2:21:28] in John Book of John and when he prayed
[2:21:31] in the garden he said that I I'm doing
[2:21:35] this I will so that where I am they may
[2:21:39] be also I know you're familiar with
[2:21:42] these scriptures they're not new to
[2:21:44] you and so here is this lion
[2:21:48] that has
[2:21:50] prevailed and when we
[2:21:53] see and it's prevailed to loose the
[2:21:56] Seven Seals to loose them to open them
[2:21:58] up to make
[2:22:02] that creative power of God available to
[2:22:07] finish the
[2:22:09] book The
[2:22:11] Lion The Prophecies of the lion all the
[2:22:15] way from Genesis now come down to our
[2:22:19] age and the Revelation or the mystery of
[2:22:23] the Seven Seals are
[2:22:26] broken and he said and I beheld in verse
[2:22:29] 6 and lo in the midst of the throne and
[2:22:31] the four beasts and in the midst of the
[2:22:34] elders stood what a
[2:22:38] lamb stood a lamb as it had been slain
[2:22:43] having seven horns seven eyes which are
[2:22:44] the seven spirits of God sent
[2:22:48] forth into all the world what did the
[2:22:51] Prophecies of the lion
[2:22:54] produce what was the nature behind the
[2:22:59] lion was the
[2:23:04] lamb and we are
[2:23:07] delivered from the mouth of the lion was
[2:23:11] what Paul said in second Timothy our
[2:23:14] deliverance comes from from the mouth of
[2:23:18] the lion or the prophecies
[2:23:21] concerning the lion that became the
[2:23:27] lamb it's the power of God and we find
[2:23:31] in Ephesians and I really we're really
[2:23:35] we're finishing up I thank you brother
[2:23:38] for the Liberty to speak on these things
[2:23:41] normally this would be something I'd
[2:23:43] just do at home but he told me take your
[2:23:46] Liberty
[2:23:47] thank you brother it means a lot to me
[2:23:50] and to have a congregation so willing to
[2:23:52] listen thank
[2:23:55] you in
[2:23:58] Ephesians when it talks about this
[2:24:03] power what is this power that he's
[2:24:05] talking
[2:24:07] about
[2:24:09] well says in Ephesians the 1 chapter I
[2:24:12] believe it might be the second here no
[2:24:15] it's the first and what is the exceeding
[2:24:18] greatness of his power to us word this
[2:24:20] is Ephesians 1: 19 what is the exceeding
[2:24:23] greatness of his power to us word who
[2:24:26] believe according to the working of his
[2:24:29] mighty power which he wrought in Christ
[2:24:32] when he raised him from the dead and set
[2:24:34] him in his own right hand in the
[2:24:36] Heavenly places what is it talking about
[2:24:39] the power of
[2:24:43] Resurrection that's the power of God to
[2:24:46] take something something that's dead or
[2:24:48] to take something that's
[2:24:50] nothing and make something out of
[2:24:53] it God only used the womb of
[2:24:57] Mary he took something that was nothing
[2:25:00] and by word created in Mary in the womb
[2:25:03] of
[2:25:04] Mary what we call Our Savior Jesus
[2:25:08] Christ the power of the Resurrection in
[2:25:11] one other place John the first
[2:25:15] chapter we've definitely taken a walk
[2:25:18] through scripture
[2:25:20] I when he talks about in the beginning
[2:25:24] was the word the word was with God John
[2:25:27] 1 and one uh word was with God the Word
[2:25:31] was God and we're all familiar with this
[2:25:34] all things were made by him without him
[2:25:35] was not anything made and we drop down
[2:25:37] to the 12th verse and to me this is one
[2:25:41] when I hear people
[2:25:43] preach I wonder why they don't use this
[2:25:45] scripture more often because in verse 12
[2:25:48] it says but as many as received
[2:25:51] him that's not a message that's not a
[2:25:53] Doctrine that's a personal presence in
[2:25:58] our lives the life that's in this water
[2:26:01] when we receive him the life behind this
[2:26:05] book it says when we receive him to them
[2:26:08] he gave power to become the sons of God
[2:26:12] even to them that believe on his
[2:26:14] name the power is in the receiving him
[2:26:20] drink just drink and the power and the
[2:26:25] life come with
[2:26:27] it the creative power of the
[2:26:30] resurrection and the
[2:26:32] life Jesus when he went to the tomb of
[2:26:36] Lazarus said I am she she said oh if you
[2:26:39] had been here my brother would have
[2:26:42] lived and he said I am the resurrection
[2:26:47] and the
[2:26:48] life it's not there'll be an event we
[2:26:51] call Resurrection but where does it
[2:26:53] start it starts with the life of Jesus
[2:26:57] Christ inside of us I am the
[2:27:01] resurrection it's a
[2:27:02] person and if you receive that person
[2:27:06] you have the power to become the sons
[2:27:09] and in their case Daughters of
[2:27:13] God because once God speaks it
[2:27:17] it forever stands let's stand God bless
[2:27:21] you tonight or it's probably is tonight
[2:27:24] now I don't know how long we went
[2:27:26] shouldn't have told me how long those
[2:27:28] batteries were good for brother but you
[2:27:31] know sometimes I'll apologize for length
[2:27:35] because I'm
[2:27:37] not yeah I don't know how long we went I
[2:27:40] I don't even know but to get the concept
[2:27:43] that Christ in you is the resurrection
[2:27:46] Christ in you brother bam said once
[2:27:48] you're born again and you have not gone
[2:27:50] to the bar
[2:27:52] recently because you don't have any
[2:27:54] desire once that desire has been changed
[2:27:56] he said that proves the resurrection's
[2:27:57] already in
[2:28:01] you praise the Lord gracious Heavenly
[2:28:05] Father Lord I might as it were apologize
[2:28:09] for the length because of these Earthly
[2:28:11] bodies but I cannot apologize for the
[2:28:15] content because it's you it's the Life
[2:28:18] of Christ and I trust that we've showed
[2:28:21] you enough places in the scripture that
[2:28:24] you can manifest your honor and your
[2:28:26] glory through your children here this
[2:28:28] morning their kindness Lord sometimes
[2:28:32] the simplest word the simplest
[2:28:34] smile can bring you on the scene so we
[2:28:38] love you we thank you in the name of
[2:28:40] Jesus Christ as we give you this service
[2:28:45] amen so thank you for having us here
[2:28:51] I I love you or I wouldn't have gone the
[2:28:55] way these Services have
[2:28:57] gone uh although I'm not a very good
[2:29:00] evangelist
[2:29:01] anymore but
[2:29:05] uh we is it okay if I sing one more song
[2:29:08] and I I can I can do this one without
[2:29:11] the words because the words are in the
[2:29:14] book when I first gave my heart to
[2:29:16] Christ I'd been in both folk groups I
[2:29:19] toured Europe as a young man at 18 years
[2:29:21] old with a folk singing group for one
[2:29:23] whole summer and also I played in a rock
[2:29:26] band for I don't know four years from
[2:29:29] the time I was like seventh or eighth
[2:29:31] grade when I came to the Lord I didn't
[2:29:33] even sing or play for actually quite a
[2:29:37] while cuz I heard brother brandom say
[2:29:38] you lay that gift aside until God's
[2:29:41] ready to use it and this particular song
[2:29:44] that if the sister will allow me one
[2:29:46] once
[2:29:47] more uh was actually the first song that
[2:29:50] he gave me after I had given my heart to
[2:29:56] Christ and you can find it in
[2:30:00] Thessalonians chapter 3 chapter 4 I'm
[2:30:02] sure you'll recognize it when I start to
[2:30:06] play
[2:30:06] [Music]
[2:30:15] it
[2:30:24] for this we say unto you by the word of
[2:30:29] the
[2:30:31] Lord that we which are alive and remain
[2:30:36] unto the coming of the
[2:30:39] Lord should not
[2:30:42] prevent them which
[2:30:45] are
[2:30:56] sleep for the Lord himself shall descend
[2:31:00] from heaven with a
[2:31:04] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[2:31:09] with a trump of
[2:31:12] God and the dead in Christ CHR shall
[2:31:21] rise
[2:31:26] [Music]
[2:31:34] first then we which are alive
[2:31:40] and
[2:31:42] remain shall be caught up together
[2:31:46] together with
[2:31:47] him in the
[2:31:50] clouds to meet our Lord in the air and
[2:31:55] so shall
[2:31:58] [Applause]
[2:32:01] [Music]
[2:32:03] we
[2:32:04] be with the
[2:32:09] Lord
[2:32:11] ever
[2:32:15] be
[2:32:16] with the
[2:32:19] [Music]
[2:32:25] Lord praise the Lord God bless you thank
[2:32:28] you I didn't mean for you to keep
[2:32:30] standing but God bless you thank you
[2:32:33] sister Lord bless you God bless you
[2:32:37] brother please you
[2:32:41] know the quarterback or whoever's they
[2:32:44] have to hand the brother take the ball
[2:32:48] please God bless you thank
[2:32:52] you we come to the
[2:32:54] End
[2:32:56] Amen I love how we started he said the
[2:32:58] Lord
[2:32:59] spoke it was
[2:33:02] done then you put those two dots there
[2:33:05] the completion is because he said it not
[2:33:07] because it's finished it's because when
[2:33:10] he says it it's as good as done and then
[2:33:13] you have that period of time for it to
[2:33:14] come out and for to happen but it was
[2:33:17] done when he said it because his word
[2:33:18] can't return unto him void and then he
[2:33:21] talked about Simeon and Levi and they
[2:33:22] killed a man in Anger remember what
[2:33:24] Jesus said to the priest he said you are
[2:33:26] just as your father for he was a
[2:33:28] murderer from the beginning and we go
[2:33:31] back and what that tells you is that the
[2:33:33] seed of Cain had continued through the
[2:33:36] nature of Cain had continued even into
[2:33:38] that priesthood all through there's none
[2:33:40] of us clean there's none of us good our
[2:33:43] family name means nothing our family
[2:33:45] lineage our bloodline
[2:33:46] we've all been born in sin shaped in
[2:33:49] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[2:33:51] sorry about that Brothers but as he
[2:33:53] talked about it you know brother Brandon
[2:33:54] would say you murder a man's
[2:33:56] influence and it's the same as you put a
[2:33:58] knife in his back or you killed that man
[2:34:00] amen he talked about the birth before
[2:34:02] travail and you continue there in Isaiah
[2:34:04] he says will the Lord basically make you
[2:34:06] pregnant and then not give you a child
[2:34:09] will he put you through all of that
[2:34:10] effort and and then leave you hanging he
[2:34:13] won't he won't I I loved what how sister
[2:34:16] sang this morning you know what that was
[2:34:17] that was a sacrifice of
[2:34:20] praise a sacrifice of praise in times of
[2:34:23] disappointment and and un unsureness and
[2:34:25] these different things there's a
[2:34:27] sacrifice there when we say Lord I
[2:34:29] believe Lord I trust Lord I'm looking to
[2:34:31] your word and no matter what the
[2:34:33] situation looks like it's that lying
[2:34:35] vanity he spoke of last night and I
[2:34:37] believe your word Amen brother BR said
[2:34:39] God loves to hear us repeat his word
[2:34:42] back to him amen that's the thing that
[2:34:45] takes us through is is is the word I
[2:34:47] love that thought of the thief touch the
[2:34:48] memory of
[2:34:50] God you you can't go to heaven unless
[2:34:52] you were in there in the first place in
[2:34:54] the mind and the predestinated purpose
[2:34:56] of God Amen and then he talked about
[2:34:59] that Lion's Roar and that prophecy and
[2:35:00] it reminded me of the scripture in
[2:35:02] Revelation where it says they overcame
[2:35:05] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[2:35:07] of their testimony Jesus said because I
[2:35:10] live you shall live also why because if
[2:35:14] the same spirit that raised Christ from
[2:35:16] the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your
[2:35:18] mortal bodies it'll make you live and
[2:35:20] you cannot die once you get that spirit
[2:35:23] inside of you amen and then he said Paul
[2:35:25] would say because we are Sons because we
[2:35:28] are children of God then we cry ABA
[2:35:31] father then we repeat the word back then
[2:35:32] we say God fulfill the word that you've
[2:35:35] given for our time fulfill the word that
[2:35:37] you've given for our age fulfill the
[2:35:38] word that you've given for my life and
[2:35:40] for my family and all these different
[2:35:41] things and we come back and we say God
[2:35:43] do it just like a child coming to the
[2:35:46] father saying feed me provide for me
[2:35:49] protect me deliver me as the case may be
[2:35:52] whatever it is because he's our father
[2:35:54] we go to him and we have access to
[2:35:56] everything that he's promised amen and
[2:35:58] he finished with Ephesians the exceeding
[2:36:00] greatness of his power is what we're
[2:36:03] trusting in amen amen I'm trusting we're
[2:36:06] blessed this morning that I'll leave it
[2:36:07] there but let's sing that song just
[2:36:10] before we close you talked about seeing
[2:36:12] who we are so let's sing that song who I
