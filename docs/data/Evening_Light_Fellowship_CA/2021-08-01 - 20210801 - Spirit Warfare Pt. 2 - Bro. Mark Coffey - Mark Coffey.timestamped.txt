[38:49] all if we can turn in your bibles
[38:51] we'll just have a reading of the word
[38:53] here in revelation chapter
[38:55] 13 thank you musicians
[39:02] they meant revelation 13 verse 1 and
[39:05] we'll just read down to
[39:07] verse 10. just to
[39:10] give us some
[39:14] some background here
[39:18] revelation 13 first one and i stood upon
[39:22] the sand of the sea
[39:24] and ice and saw a beast rise up out of
[39:27] the sea having
[39:29] seven heads and ten horns and upon his
[39:32] horns
[39:32] ten crowns and upon his heads the name
[39:36] of blasphemy and the beast which i saw
[39:40] was like unto a leopard and his feet
[39:43] were as the feet of a bear and his mouth
[39:45] as the mouth of a lion and the dragon
[39:48] gave him his power and his seat and
[39:50] great authority
[39:52] this is certainly a beast and i saw one
[39:55] of his heads
[39:56] as it were wounded to death this is uh
[39:59] we
[40:00] touched a little bit on this this is uh
[40:02] rome here now
[40:03] and his deadly wound was healed this is
[40:06] pagan rome
[40:07] and and it was healed and became paper
[40:09] rome and all the
[40:11] world wandered after the beast and they
[40:13] worshiped
[40:14] the dragon which gave power unto the
[40:16] beast and they worshipped the beast
[40:18] saying
[40:18] who is like unto the beast who is able
[40:21] to make
[40:22] war with him and there was given unto
[40:24] him a mouth speaking great things and
[40:27] blasphemies
[40:28] and power was given unto him to continue
[40:30] forty and two months and he opened his
[40:32] mouth
[40:33] in blasphemy against god to blaspheme
[40:36] his name and his tabernacle and then
[40:40] that dwell in it in heaven and it was
[40:43] given
[40:44] unto him to make war with the saints
[40:46] this is not us saints this is
[40:48] this happens after the rapture so it's
[40:50] talking about foolish virgins
[40:52] and to be overcome them and power was
[40:54] given him
[40:55] over all kindreds and tongues and
[40:57] nations
[40:58] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[41:00] worship him whose names are not written
[41:02] in the lamb lamb's book of life
[41:06] slain from the foundation of the world
[41:08] if any man have an ear
[41:10] let him hear he that leadeth into
[41:13] captivity shall go into captivity
[41:15] he that killeth with the sword must be
[41:17] killed with the sword
[41:18] here is the patience and the faith of
[41:21] the saints amen may the lord as blessing
[41:23] to the reading of his word you may be
[41:25] seated at this time
[41:29] so we did cover a bit of
[41:33] hello we did cover a bit of this
[41:38] on wednesday so we got so far and
[41:41] this is kind of part two so i'm just
[41:43] going to run over the front of it
[41:45] again just to uh just to make sure that
[41:48] all of us
[41:48] kind of back up together as we go into
[41:52] the new part of it
[41:54] so we are looking at spirit warfare uh
[41:57] just having a view
[41:58] what's happening you know in the other
[42:00] realm and we know that there's
[42:02] great war taking place it's not uh we
[42:04] don't have much to do with it
[42:06] uh except it goes on in our heads in our
[42:09] minds and
[42:10] and those things and we're certainly
[42:12] under attack but it's between god and
[42:13] satan
[42:14] in this age is is the main
[42:18] main ones in the battle and much there
[42:21] is
[42:21] much confusion in the world today we see
[42:23] it it's just not
[42:24] uh uh it's just getting worse and worse
[42:27] as we see
[42:28] and it is a funny thing for generations
[42:31] because you see
[42:31] in your age in your generation what it's
[42:34] like
[42:35] and then you know the older you get you
[42:37] got more to compare but if you're
[42:38] growing up in this age you don't
[42:40] really see well this is the way it is
[42:41] it's always been they don't have much to
[42:43] compare with but
[42:44] you know the older you get you see how
[42:45] it was and how it is now and you can
[42:48] get to compare so you have two different
[42:50] kinds of views then of you know
[42:51] well it's not that bad really well you
[42:54] know uh
[42:55] it's it's just continually just getting
[42:57] worse all the time
[42:59] so there's much confusion in the world
[43:01] and there's uh
[43:02] we see just things breaking and things
[43:05] you know it's coming to an end and we
[43:06] know the
[43:07] the seventh seal has been revealed and
[43:10] once that's revealed uh
[43:12] things that uh that that
[43:15] are not part of the plan of god in this
[43:17] the final age
[43:18] things that don't that have an ending
[43:20] are going to end
[43:22] they're starting to end and he said
[43:24] first would be the uh
[43:26] the denominations the churches they
[43:29] would they would
[43:30] end and we were seeing that and we're
[43:32] seeing it just
[43:33] crumbling the crumbling apart with what
[43:36] they're starting to believe and turn to
[43:37] it's just
[43:38] just uh just outrageous you know in
[43:41] terms of
[43:42] the uh things that you know god
[43:45] has had set up in the beginning for his
[43:46] church we're certain to see that and
[43:48] it's just crumbling and we we know that
[43:51] it's come to an end because you know you
[43:53] don't see the
[43:54] the any uh you know during during
[43:57] you know the last many many years you
[44:00] see
[44:01] many churches and many denominations you
[44:03] know starting up and new denominations
[44:05] there's no such thing anymore you don't
[44:07] see
[44:07] hair of any major denomination anymore
[44:10] it's just
[44:10] it's come to it's come to an end that
[44:12] thing is not happening anymore and
[44:14] the nominations that have been are are
[44:16] ending so
[44:17] you're seeing it in the earth you've
[44:19] seen the changes the things that are
[44:20] happening you're seeing it in the family
[44:22] life you're staying in the business
[44:24] you're saying in the politics it's all
[44:25] just coming to an end you know we're
[44:27] just on a very fine line here when it
[44:29] comes to financial and they're just
[44:31] printing money you can see what's going
[44:33] on in the politics you know if you pay
[44:35] any attention to that it's just getting
[44:38] really
[44:39] really bad you know and uh you know
[44:42] there's just not a nation that's
[44:44] not you know in financial trouble right
[44:47] now you know and
[44:49] printing money is not the solution as we
[44:50] know we know all those things so
[44:52] so we see it and brandon saw it he's
[44:55] thought in seed form we're seeing
[44:56] reality coming now
[44:57] and it's really starting to happen and
[44:59] it's just different
[45:01] from you know generation seeing things
[45:04] getting worse this is really the end
[45:06] time so
[45:08] uh so we want to really kind of take a
[45:10] little closer look and see what's
[45:11] happening here
[45:12] from different angles there's many many
[45:14] angles but uh
[45:16] you know we as we said before we're in
[45:18] satan's eden
[45:19] and this is uh this is the time for us
[45:22] when
[45:22] satan is going to be given power for a
[45:24] short time upon the earth to
[45:26] really to finish things so uh
[45:31] so i just want to do uh like just a
[45:33] quick
[45:35] quick review uh you know in this world
[45:37] as uh
[45:38] bran did preach birth pains and and
[45:41] those things
[45:42] happening uh uh you know which we would
[45:45] see
[45:45] you know the earth you know just
[45:47] starting to
[45:48] go through these uh this uh delivery
[45:50] process where it's gonna
[45:52] be a new earth you know it's going
[45:54] through these birth pains and it will
[45:55] deliver
[45:56] a a new thing at the end so it's all
[45:59] the earth is part of god's plan and we
[46:02] in the seven seals you know it was part
[46:04] of it
[46:05] in the uh in the seals so
[46:08] it was in the mind of god and will
[46:09] continue those things that were in the
[46:11] mind of god in the
[46:12] in the beginning will continue so i'll
[46:14] just uh
[46:15] just have a quick run through run
[46:17] through this here
[46:19] and just see so we're not just going to
[46:22] go through the
[46:23] animation here we're just going to this
[46:26] with slides we saw last time i'll just
[46:27] flip to them fast so we talked about the
[46:29] times of the gentiles
[46:31] and uh that and we talked about
[46:35] uh you know what would be the beginning
[46:38] the end of this
[46:39] timeline and it was starting in daniel 2
[46:42] with the
[46:42] with division that we saw of the
[46:45] four kingdoms and right up two and we
[46:48] talked about
[46:49] the abomination that make it desolation
[46:51] which was the mosque of omar
[46:53] and that would be the final end to the
[46:55] times of the gentiles
[46:57] when israel would then come to
[47:00] a power they don't have full power now
[47:03] they're still
[47:03] uh you know waiting for the bribe as we
[47:06] talked about to move out of the way
[47:07] and then the uh the jewish nation
[47:11] israel will come in and be a totally
[47:14] independent
[47:15] nation when they have that temple mount
[47:18] back and god will
[47:19] then deal with fully with israel
[47:23] he can't he he he's not now he's done
[47:26] things to get them
[47:27] gathered together and he had a long
[47:29] process as we know to do that
[47:31] and uh he he released those demons we
[47:35] talked about in order to bring israel
[47:37] into its homeland in in the second world
[47:40] war
[47:41] and uh and it was a time when uh there
[47:44] was just
[47:45] uh you know just uh you know
[47:48] just total confusion in in the world but
[47:50] god was
[47:51] had a plan and he was a plan to move
[47:53] those to open up israel again
[47:56] which hadn't happened since uh 70 a.d
[47:58] when they lost control of it under titus
[48:00] that time and the whole temple was
[48:02] destroyed
[48:03] and now they were back it was a major
[48:04] spiritual spiritual
[48:06] uh happening in the world which is
[48:09] forgotten now
[48:10] it's been a long time but the bride
[48:12] still remembers because it's a
[48:14] key point in the timeline of the end of
[48:17] the world
[48:18] and uh for sure at this time
[48:22] we were going to see israel taking place
[48:25] and then
[48:26] you know you know what israel i mean
[48:28] it's the same
[48:29] nothing happens unless they're in that
[48:31] land that god gave them you know that's
[48:32] their land you know and you see it with
[48:34] abraham as soon as he stepped off that
[48:36] land
[48:37] you know he you know that time it with
[48:39] egypt and he was down in egypt and the
[48:41] king there was going to take his wife
[48:43] from that and god said whoa you know i
[48:45] can't have this happen
[48:46] and he goes down and he has to
[48:48] straighten it up and like i said it's
[48:50] it's
[48:50] real it shows predestination because i
[48:53] have to have this
[48:54] woman here to deliver this and this all
[48:57] got to take place so god is very active
[48:59] he's not sitting back
[49:01] you know just waiting for all this to
[49:03] happen and let it happen itself
[49:05] he's engaged and he's doing these things
[49:08] so you see it and he wanted abraham
[49:10] back in that land get in you know around
[49:12] those borders inside those borders
[49:14] and he could deal with him he wouldn't
[49:16] even speak went in when he
[49:18] abraham went to egypt he didn't even
[49:19] speak to him he was speaking to the king
[49:21] there
[49:21] and he said tell abraham you know this
[49:23] this you know he had to
[49:25] so he wouldn't even speak to him so
[49:27] israel gets spoken to when they're
[49:28] inside those borders and he's gathering
[49:30] now for
[49:30] many years getting them into into israel
[49:34] and he is going to deal with him and he
[49:36] deals them
[49:36] as a nation we're dealt individually but
[49:39] he deals with israel as a nation so it
[49:41] will be
[49:41] all happening very it's in and it will
[49:44] be seen
[49:45] you know it'll be those things to be
[49:46] seen because it's more in the physical
[49:48] the the israel so at that time
[49:52] the bride is gone uh the
[49:55] the gentile powers come into full force
[50:00] and they and it goes through the three
[50:01] and a half years of tribulation while
[50:04] while the bride is in the marriage
[50:06] supper
[50:07] and then once all that's over the course
[50:10] the earth is
[50:10] burned over and cleared and then the
[50:13] it makes time for revelation 19 when the
[50:17] final battle happens and armageddon then
[50:20] the burning of the earth and then
[50:21] then it will be the millennium and it'll
[50:23] be the bride and the
[50:25] 144 000 at that time which we see
[50:28] in revelation chapter 7.
[50:32] okay so here we'll see the fullness of
[50:34] the gentiles
[50:36] well it happened from daniel right up to
[50:38] the time when
[50:40] israel was really up into revelation 11
[50:42] and
[50:43] the mosque of omar is finished now we
[50:46] went through this and this is the
[50:48] four kingdoms that were depicted by the
[50:50] king nebuchadnezzar's
[50:52] dream that he had and he looked at all
[50:54] the
[50:55] the world powers and these would be the
[50:57] powers that will be
[50:58] in the in the earth and there'd be none
[51:01] others none of
[51:01] these kingdoms that god would be dealing
[51:04] with
[51:05] through these ages and we we know that
[51:08] three three of these have gone on and
[51:10] the fourth one was rome
[51:12] and uh it was the roman empire
[51:15] the pagan roman empire which had a great
[51:18] uh great control of the the earth at the
[51:21] time
[51:22] and and then it
[51:25] it was of course defeated
[51:28] it went under and
[51:32] what came up then was a spirit another
[51:35] spirit of that roman empire which was
[51:37] instead of pagan rome it was paper roman
[51:39] that's what we just read there
[51:41] when it was wounded unto death so we
[51:44] kind of covered a good bit of that and
[51:46] then in
[51:47] daniel's dream uh vision in in chapter
[51:51] seven
[51:52] uh he we talked here about the anointing
[51:55] that was on
[51:56] those kingdoms and each of them was
[51:58] represented
[51:59] by these uh creatures these beasts and
[52:02] they were ferocious beasts and we know
[52:05] that there's an accu
[52:06] always an accumulating effect so these
[52:09] beasts once they come the next one takes
[52:12] on the
[52:12] the attributes of the one before until
[52:15] in the final one the fourth one
[52:16] has the attributes of all the four
[52:18] beasts so it makes it more powerful
[52:20] more ferocious and that happens all the
[52:23] time we see it with the horse riders in
[52:25] revelation
[52:26] 4 that the white horse rider and the
[52:30] the red horse and the black horse all
[52:33] accumulate into this pale pale
[52:36] uh horse and this horse rider and that
[52:40] has all the powers of the previous one
[52:42] and it happens with the
[52:44] also in this age you know we know with
[52:46] justification
[52:47] you know we we go through justification
[52:49] brother brown says you know the
[52:51] the germ that we have started back
[52:53] before
[52:54] luther's time that's that's when it
[52:56] started it was four generations and he
[52:57] uses
[52:58] like when he's talking about levi
[53:01] and levi paid tithes
[53:05] back in abraham because his his germ was
[53:07] in abraham four generations back and he
[53:09] said it's the same spiritually
[53:11] so our germ really it starts back
[53:14] before luther's time and then that seed
[53:18] us
[53:18] in us accumulates then the the
[53:22] justification sanctification baptism of
[53:24] the holy ghost
[53:25] and we have all of that when when you
[53:28] come
[53:28] and are born again when you take on that
[53:30] spirit you already
[53:32] have justification all those built into
[53:34] it that's how it works it's accumulating
[53:36] thing that god does
[53:37] and it's uh it's amazing you know it's a
[53:39] great mystery uh revealed in this time
[53:41] but we need those
[53:43] uh four things and do it you know do you
[53:46] ever hear anyone talking about that i
[53:47] never heard anyone i was talking to
[53:49] uh when we were up uh friday and i was
[53:52] talking mr piggett
[53:53] and he was you know we were talking
[53:55] about justification you know he just
[53:56] couldn't get past
[53:57] justification wonderful thing yeah but
[53:59] you know that's that's that's just
[54:01] that's as much as they go you know there
[54:03] wasn't
[54:04] you know there is some sanctification
[54:06] but that's it you know and that's
[54:07] as far as they go they're just stopped
[54:09] in time you know and
[54:10] and i you know was talking you know
[54:12] going you know let's keep going here you
[54:15] know and
[54:15] it's just not there you know
[54:19] they're just talk different so so
[54:23] you know it's a great message as we know
[54:27] thank god for for it yeah and he he
[54:30] like i said before he passed billions of
[54:32] people to get to you guys
[54:33] to us you know amen
[54:38] uh so i just touched on the isms a bit
[54:42] and program was very uh uh you know uh
[54:46] he would get almost i don't know it was
[54:49] angry but he would certainly preach it
[54:51] that in his quote here he said communism
[54:54] ain't nothing
[54:55] it's a tool in the hands of god to bring
[54:57] revenge upon the earth for the blood of
[54:59] the saints it was never meant to be a
[55:00] power upon the earth
[55:02] like like one of the four powers in
[55:04] daniel was never meant to be
[55:05] that way even though we saw communism
[55:07] and fascism and
[55:08] nazisms all the isms and
[55:12] you know there's certainly a power you
[55:14] know you see it in russia
[55:16] and how it just you know just takes a
[55:18] whole lot of people and just destroys
[55:20] a nation you know just destroys a nation
[55:23] and you see it in the u.s
[55:25] you know you see it just uh happening
[55:27] there that spirit that's
[55:28] that's in there that's looking to take
[55:31] the
[55:32] to control the people large government
[55:34] take full control
[55:35] you know culver certainly gave us gave
[55:37] all of that leverage you know to the
[55:40] to the government's uh and it's a it's a
[55:42] communist spirit you know
[55:43] but it's not the one that will take over
[55:45] in the end but we know who will destroy
[55:47] the vatican
[55:48] and it probably said it in the end it
[55:50] will be russia
[55:51] and it will be because communism is a
[55:54] tool to revenge upon the
[55:55] earth for the blood of the saints right
[55:57] so he'll he'll still use it right up to
[56:00] the very end so
[56:01] not a thing that you know it's uh
[56:05] it's going to frighten us uh you know in
[56:08] that
[56:08] sense that it's going to be the
[56:10] dominating power it's not it'll
[56:12] always be rome the roman
[56:15] church and we mentioned it
[56:18] uh just shown here at the conversation
[56:21] on the top
[56:22] top of uh of the mountain when jesus was
[56:25] in a fast for 40 days
[56:26] and satan said and here and the devil
[56:29] said unto him all
[56:30] in the in the bowl of this power will i
[56:33] give thee
[56:35] and the glory of them for this is
[56:37] delivered unto me and
[56:39] and to whomsoever i will give it so he
[56:41] had control he's shown he's he had
[56:42] control of it
[56:44] here in this and you know he said and
[56:47] the glory of them so it was a glorious
[56:49] thing right you know to look at in the
[56:50] physical but
[56:51] as we looked at the anointings of these
[56:53] beasts upon these powers it was
[56:55] ferocious right it was
[56:57] to a goal that would just just destroy
[56:59] the people right
[57:00] and you saw it was wrong they had
[57:02] nothing you know they had nothing just
[57:04] living for nothing
[57:05] you know just working and paying taxes
[57:08] and
[57:09] being told what to do and their lands
[57:10] taken and you see
[57:12] see just such problems going on in the
[57:15] world with all of this and
[57:16] evil evil uh groups you know that try to
[57:20] control
[57:20] mexico for being one i mean it's just
[57:23] how much they
[57:23] just take control of everything you know
[57:28] uh here's the map and i was just shown
[57:30] there uh i
[57:32] meant to leave that one out but just
[57:33] shown where we were in
[57:35] in revelations what we're going to touch
[57:36] on but it's uh it's
[57:38] you know really uh it's just so good for
[57:41] the
[57:42] uh revelations just touches all the
[57:45] bible it's right from genesis you know
[57:47] right to
[57:47] jude you know it just covers so much in
[57:49] there you know because it all
[57:51] branches out from there and it's been
[57:54] open to us right it was never open
[57:55] before it was closed you know
[57:57] to john john didn't even understand it
[57:59] he was only saying well
[58:01] i saw this symbol and this symbol and
[58:03] this symbol he didn't know what it was
[58:05] he was saying he wasn't same with daniel
[58:06] he was there in chapter 12 saying
[58:09] you know i don't know what it is you
[58:10] know and uh so now it's it's all being
[58:14] revealed in this age to the bride
[58:17] you know that's it you know so it's uh
[58:21] it's uh just a blessing to
[58:24] see those things and understand those
[58:26] things that are happening right because
[58:27] it gives you
[58:28] uh the word being revealed that gives
[58:30] you faith right
[58:32] and you know so it's
[58:35] builds your faith so here is just uh now
[58:38] showing really of uh
[58:40] the uh church ages and the true church
[58:43] false church and what goes on at that
[58:44] time we know
[58:45] it's it's just you know a battle
[58:48] every bit of it much like you know bo
[58:50] john uh preached in
[58:52] with uh joshua you know you you you
[58:55] fought for every inch right
[58:56] and uh it's just not handed over to you
[58:59] and you're up against a lot of
[59:00] warfare spiritual warfare in this right
[59:03] and we see you know the chairman's over
[59:05] here and then the
[59:07] white horse riders the two anointings
[59:09] that are in our age
[59:11] going against the church church in the
[59:14] last age and we know that the uh
[59:17] cherubims
[59:18] were the ones set to protect uh the
[59:22] their guardians they're protecting the
[59:25] the way to the tree of life because
[59:26] someone is going to feed off that tree
[59:28] of life and it has to be protected
[59:30] right and there are powerful angels
[59:34] to protect god's promises there
[59:38] so moving on quickly is this quick
[59:40] enough here so
[59:42] we just read revelation and what we
[59:45] tried to show there is the same thing
[59:46] daniel saw
[59:47] in his vision in in daniel 7. he saw the
[59:50] same beast coming up
[59:52] and and then now john is seeing the same
[59:54] beast coming up uh oh
[59:56] you know i've seen this before oh so
[59:58] something's back here
[1:00:00] and it's going to be a present in the
[1:00:02] world it's going to be obvious now
[1:00:04] in the world and especially after the
[1:00:06] bride goes
[1:00:07] who especially after the bride goes then
[1:00:10] you know they'll see it on the last of
[1:00:13] the gentile
[1:00:15] kingdom in the last three and a half
[1:00:16] years when this when this
[1:00:18] uh beast rome and this anointing
[1:00:22] has power over over
[1:00:25] all the earth at that time and it will
[1:00:28] all
[1:00:28] eventually as we know end up going
[1:00:30] against israel
[1:00:32] and will come into the uh battle of
[1:00:35] armageddon
[1:00:36] which will be the final final uh show
[1:00:39] here in the earth i'm not going to spend
[1:00:42] too much time this fourth king was drawn
[1:00:44] into itself and the anointing is all the
[1:00:45] previous three kingdoms as i mentioned
[1:00:49] so not to go through these quotes but uh
[1:00:50] just uh
[1:00:54] just to show here
[1:00:57] i'm showing here to 200 000 000 demons
[1:01:01] that were
[1:01:01] released so quickly what happened is
[1:01:04] really uh as we know brother branham
[1:01:08] spends a lot of time explaining this
[1:01:10] that in this
[1:01:11] in the first world war that war ended
[1:01:14] quickly they didn't know really why it
[1:01:17] ended you know
[1:01:18] on november 11th uh in you know
[1:01:22] in on that time in the first world war
[1:01:25] the war ended suddenly and god took a
[1:01:29] halt to it because
[1:01:30] it was it was going it was going too far
[1:01:33] to what they wanted and what happened is
[1:01:36] that brother brown says
[1:01:37] because he it was it was starting to go
[1:01:41] into the sixth seal
[1:01:43] and the six seal program says cracked
[1:01:45] open and you see those seven angels in
[1:01:48] the four angels in revelation seven
[1:01:50] holding back the winds well that was
[1:01:52] starting to
[1:01:53] that was starting to let go you know as
[1:01:55] that's the thumbs funny but
[1:01:57] he he explains it all and he said it had
[1:02:00] to stop
[1:02:01] and it was called a halt and uh
[1:02:04] because because israel wasn't in their
[1:02:07] homeland
[1:02:08] and before revelation 7 it starts to
[1:02:11] uh be fulfilled they have to be in their
[1:02:13] homeland
[1:02:14] and we know they they never got into
[1:02:16] their homeland until the second world
[1:02:18] war
[1:02:18] right and these these were had to be
[1:02:20] released
[1:02:21] to get israel into uh get the jews back
[1:02:25] to
[1:02:26] israel the ones that he needed to be in
[1:02:28] there the 144 000 to be
[1:02:30] ready so he could go back and open open
[1:02:33] up
[1:02:34] to israel so so
[1:02:37] uh the war was stopped so technically
[1:02:40] the sixth seal opened
[1:02:42] it opened uh open then but it had to be
[1:02:45] halted and so anyway
[1:02:49] uh here in the second world war
[1:02:52] god gave permission to have these to
[1:02:55] satan to release these two hundred
[1:02:57] thousand thousand demons
[1:02:59] and you know you know what happened you
[1:03:01] know during the sequel war
[1:03:02] it was just horrific wasn't it i mean it
[1:03:05] was horrific what
[1:03:06] happened to the jews and everything and
[1:03:08] but they did get back into their
[1:03:09] homeland
[1:03:10] they were forced out of where they were
[1:03:12] because
[1:03:13] they did they were laid back they were
[1:03:15] just relaxed they
[1:03:17] they were wealthy they were doing really
[1:03:19] well and they weren't going to move
[1:03:20] you know it just wasn't going to happen
[1:03:22] so god forced that move
[1:03:24] to move them in in a horrific way
[1:03:27] and he moved them so that they did end
[1:03:30] up in israel and declared a nation
[1:03:32] in in 1948.
[1:03:35] so then in 1948 when they as soon as
[1:03:38] they declared
[1:03:39] then war was declared on them and five
[1:03:41] nations came against them the next day
[1:03:44] and they had nothing you know and the
[1:03:46] youth uh the us
[1:03:47] was very very uh a great ally to them
[1:03:50] and gave them
[1:03:51] uh arms and all of that and
[1:03:54] uh and they staved off you know egypt
[1:03:57] all those other nations
[1:03:59] in there and that was in america in
[1:04:01] itself and then it went to the five-day
[1:04:02] war and then the yom kippur war
[1:04:04] and they won every one of those and it
[1:04:06] was miraculous
[1:04:09] and then it's kind of forgotten then it
[1:04:11] just kind of forgotten because god is
[1:04:12] waiting and he's waiting on the bride
[1:04:14] that's
[1:04:14] that's what he's waiting for right now
[1:04:16] but then these
[1:04:17] these there's nowhere where it shows
[1:04:19] that these 200 000 demons were locked
[1:04:21] back up
[1:04:22] and you can see if you read it in
[1:04:23] chapter nine we don't have time
[1:04:25] but yeah in here in nine that's when
[1:04:28] they were
[1:04:29] released and loosed and god god
[1:04:31] permitted that
[1:04:32] so where's those 200 000 demons that
[1:04:34] were released i'm sure there was a lot
[1:04:36] of
[1:04:36] demons on the earth before they were
[1:04:38] released and
[1:04:40] these two hundred thousand but random
[1:04:41] sets are going to the bride
[1:04:43] you know they they're uh after the bride
[1:04:45] now right
[1:04:46] so that's why you know bertrand says you
[1:04:48] know you don't
[1:04:49] he says down here and you you don't it's
[1:04:52] not the same and
[1:04:53] and the spirit and the anointing and the
[1:04:55] prayer life and all of those things
[1:04:57] are hampered by these uh demons and just
[1:04:59] bringing pressure on the people right
[1:05:02] uh to to and it's the same as in the the
[1:05:04] jews were
[1:05:05] especially as we get closer to the end
[1:05:08] especially on the foolish virgins
[1:05:10] at that time i mean there would be just
[1:05:12] you know
[1:05:14] a terrific pressure on the people you
[1:05:16] know and how much before
[1:05:18] you know the bride will feel so much for
[1:05:20] sure and definitely more in some
[1:05:22] countries in other countries
[1:05:23] that's that's kind of typical but there
[1:05:25] will be pressure from these demons that
[1:05:27] are upon the earth now
[1:05:28] god is god is there the chairman
[1:05:32] the chairman is there to make sure that
[1:05:35] there's no harm you know comes there
[1:05:37] unless god permits it and
[1:05:39] satan can't do anything he had power he
[1:05:41] doesn't have any power upon the bride
[1:05:43] you know
[1:05:43] that doesn't happen you know so so
[1:05:46] unless god permits it
[1:05:47] you know god has to permit it and and
[1:05:50] amen showed us
[1:05:51] that's uh that's good for the bride so
[1:05:54] that was the idea that but it was an
[1:05:55] important
[1:05:56] important point is that kind of clear
[1:05:58] kind of clear so
[1:05:59] so berman said that the thing is that
[1:06:02] the sixth seal was cracked
[1:06:04] open and there were things that brother
[1:06:05] brown said in the six
[1:06:07] that were happening under the sixth seal
[1:06:10] that you kind of think oh i thought
[1:06:11] the bride had to be gone for the sixth
[1:06:12] seal so there's a couple of things that
[1:06:14] that explains so the last slide here we
[1:06:17] said the 200 000 demons have been
[1:06:19] released on the bride and the anointing
[1:06:21] of the white
[1:06:22] red and black uh uh horserider is
[1:06:25] saturating the churches and compromising
[1:06:27] the word and deceiving uh
[1:06:29] and they're being deceived on the word
[1:06:31] and the pale horse rider
[1:06:33] at this time the power for that that
[1:06:35] that that last writer will have
[1:06:37] had not been released god hasn't given
[1:06:39] full power
[1:06:40] you know of satan upon that horse rider
[1:06:43] to do what it has to do in the last days
[1:06:45] and the bride has to be gone for that
[1:06:47] because we see in in revelation 12
[1:06:50] that the satan is kicked out of heaven
[1:06:53] when the bride goes up
[1:06:54] because they're accused of brethren
[1:06:56] right and he will not have the bride up
[1:06:59] there and him accusing the brethren
[1:07:00] while they're up there so
[1:07:02] him and his angels are sent to the earth
[1:07:04] and that's when that happens when a
[1:07:06] pale horse rider and all these are just
[1:07:08] symbolic
[1:07:09] will have their power laid the scene
[1:07:12] powers that are gathering in the
[1:07:13] churches in the world
[1:07:14] council of church to bring the harlot
[1:07:15] dollars into their completion so
[1:07:17] when rome rose first there was no
[1:07:19] protestant nation
[1:07:20] uh protestant denominations involved
[1:07:23] with this
[1:07:23] this is really under the protestant side
[1:07:26] to bring it all the
[1:07:27] christian religions in under rome at
[1:07:29] this time so that's what that is
[1:07:31] in revelation 13 they're going to turn
[1:07:33] themselves back under the agency of the
[1:07:35] pope again
[1:07:36] and so so that anointing is already in
[1:07:38] their land and that's called the
[1:07:40] ecumenical movement to bring all those
[1:07:41] denominations under
[1:07:43] and that's happening now we see it you
[1:07:45] can go in you you can go in
[1:07:46] to the world council of churches uh
[1:07:48] website and you see them all there
[1:07:50] you know they're all listed there you
[1:07:52] know i mean it's uh
[1:07:54] it's not hard to hard to see it
[1:07:58] and all this anointing and we battle
[1:08:00] every bit of it
[1:08:01] but we've been given power greater is he
[1:08:03] that is in you than he does in the world
[1:08:05] and if you notice with
[1:08:06] the lutheran church and the 500
[1:08:09] the edicts how many was there 99 was it
[1:08:14] you know when luther put the edicts up
[1:08:16] you know they declared a little while
[1:08:18] ago that
[1:08:19] that's all cleared up or
[1:08:23] there's no more difference between us
[1:08:25] and the catholic church anymore
[1:08:27] right and that's not a good thing you
[1:08:30] know
[1:08:32] so all this anointing and we battle
[1:08:34] every bit of it but we've been given
[1:08:36] power greater is he that's in you that's
[1:08:37] he that's in the world right
[1:08:39] and uh we are in a warfare and you have
[1:08:42] to have the word
[1:08:43] you know the word is everything right
[1:08:46] the word
[1:08:46] in the beginning was the word and god
[1:08:49] god is
[1:08:50] the word and he there was a time when
[1:08:52] god wasn't god because there was no one
[1:08:53] to worship him you would know that right
[1:08:55] there was no one there to worship him so
[1:08:57] he wasn't god but he was the word
[1:09:00] he always was the word right amen
[1:09:04] so carrying carrying on this is the new
[1:09:07] stuff
[1:09:08] oh again no more time
[1:09:13] so i was asked a few people asked me
[1:09:15] about
[1:09:16] angels and the angels and i said things
[1:09:20] with different ages so i i'm gonna stick
[1:09:22] this in here this is
[1:09:23] this is sunday school now right so we're
[1:09:25] in sunday school here this is sunday
[1:09:27] school
[1:09:28] part so uh
[1:09:32] the angels you know the chairman's
[1:09:33] relate to the the tree a tree of life
[1:09:36] you know these are guardians so i'll
[1:09:39] just say
[1:09:40] just a couple of scriptures here and out
[1:09:41] of the ground i'm bet i'm better down
[1:09:43] here i think
[1:09:44] i feel so
[1:09:48] and out of the ground made the lord god
[1:09:50] to grow every tree
[1:09:51] that is pleasant to the sight and good
[1:09:54] for food
[1:09:55] the tree of life also in the midst of
[1:09:57] the garden and the tree of not
[1:09:59] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:10:01] evil so
[1:10:02] that we we all know about the three the
[1:10:04] tree in the garden of eden in the
[1:10:06] beginning
[1:10:07] and the way would not be lost because
[1:10:10] god was going to promise some people
[1:10:12] you will eat of that tree you see that
[1:10:14] in revelation right in each age
[1:10:17] what is the tree of life there is only
[1:10:19] one source of life and that is jesus
[1:10:21] christ
[1:10:22] so the the tree of life is christ
[1:10:24] himself
[1:10:25] okay so we know that christ is the word
[1:10:28] you know so it's not jesus nazareth that
[1:10:31] was one
[1:10:32] one uh time when jesus was born when
[1:10:35] christ was born
[1:10:36] when a man was born of a woman and that
[1:10:39] was jesus of nazareth
[1:10:41] this is not jesus nazareth that was in
[1:10:43] the garden that came later right this is
[1:10:45] christ
[1:10:45] and this is the revelation of the seal
[1:10:47] this is the the message
[1:10:49] to what was revealed is that christ was
[1:10:51] in different forms in the word
[1:10:53] right up through and took form in in
[1:10:55] moses or
[1:10:56] or joseph right up to the old testament
[1:10:58] you know and
[1:10:59] came as as son of man in in
[1:11:03] as jesus nazareth in that time and then
[1:11:06] now back
[1:11:06] as christ the word in another office you
[1:11:09] know as the son of god
[1:11:11] in the church ages and then son of david
[1:11:13] and so he takes different forms but it's
[1:11:15] god right and the name of god is jesus
[1:11:18] christ
[1:11:19] ephesians 3 9.
[1:11:25] revelation 2 14 blessed are they that do
[1:11:27] his commandments
[1:11:28] that they may have right to the tree of
[1:11:31] life
[1:11:32] and may enter in through the gates into
[1:11:34] the city
[1:11:37] that they may have right to to christ
[1:11:40] the word
[1:11:40] right the pattern of heaven is what is
[1:11:43] repeated
[1:11:43] on earth the old testament gives much of
[1:11:46] it in symbol
[1:11:47] right and we know that it's very much
[1:11:50] symbols but
[1:11:51] it does help in the new testament you
[1:11:53] know to see those
[1:11:54] to understand those symbols in
[1:11:56] revelation
[1:11:57] and revelation 22 1 2 this is the
[1:12:02] at the end here and he showed me a pure
[1:12:04] river of water of life
[1:12:06] claire's crystal proceeding out of the
[1:12:08] throne of god and of the lamb in the
[1:12:09] midst of this
[1:12:10] of the street of it and on either side
[1:12:13] of the river was there the tree of life
[1:12:16] right at the beginning right at the end
[1:12:18] tree of life right up through but
[1:12:22] beer which bare 12 manner of fruits
[1:12:25] and yielded her fruit every every month
[1:12:28] and the leaves of the tree were for the
[1:12:30] healing of the nation
[1:12:34] cherubs are the guardian to the throne
[1:12:36] in heaven
[1:12:37] so that's that's where you see him so
[1:12:39] i'll get into just the layers of
[1:12:42] angels there just shortly and they there
[1:12:45] are gardens at the gate
[1:12:46] in eden and the ark of the covenant and
[1:12:48] different things and i'll i'll
[1:12:50] get into that there there in a second
[1:12:52] they are
[1:12:53] there are guardians of the four gospels
[1:12:56] and that protect
[1:12:57] the book of acts and their guardians
[1:13:00] their guardians also of the word through
[1:13:01] the father ministry
[1:13:03] which brother brown deals with all are
[1:13:06] keeping the way
[1:13:07] and the goal don't lose the way to the
[1:13:09] tree of life that's the cherubim's goal
[1:13:11] right there i am the way
[1:13:16] the truth and the life amen
[1:13:21] ezekiel 1 1 how now now we're going to
[1:13:24] talk about
[1:13:25] cherubims in the old testament these
[1:13:27] cherubims and where they showed up
[1:13:29] now it came to pass in the 13th year
[1:13:33] in the fourth month in the fifth day of
[1:13:34] the month very specific
[1:13:36] and i was among the captives by the
[1:13:39] river
[1:13:40] shabar remember that that the heavens
[1:13:42] were opened
[1:13:43] and i saw visions of god this is ezekiel
[1:13:45] 1 1 how
[1:13:46] the book opens here and he drove out the
[1:13:49] man
[1:13:50] and he placed at the east of the garden
[1:13:52] of eden cherubims and the flaming sword
[1:13:54] which turned away
[1:13:55] turned every away to keep the way of the
[1:13:58] tree of life we just
[1:13:59] put that up and i looked and behold a
[1:14:02] whirlwind
[1:14:03] came out of the north a great cloud
[1:14:06] and a fire holding itself and a
[1:14:08] brightness was about it
[1:14:10] and out of the midst thereof as the
[1:14:12] color of amber
[1:14:14] out of the midst of fire and brother
[1:14:16] brown said the color of god
[1:14:18] is amber and you see it you see it over
[1:14:21] here
[1:14:21] you know you'll see more like
[1:14:24] this here you know this i hope that's
[1:14:26] amber
[1:14:28] and thus you'll see you know in brother
[1:14:30] branham's ministry
[1:14:31] that that coloring also you know the
[1:14:33] same is what ezekiel saw
[1:14:35] and ezekiel was much like barbarian
[1:14:37] believe it or not
[1:14:38] and if you if you look at it the way he
[1:14:42] saw things and visions and the pillar
[1:14:44] fire and all of that
[1:14:45] you know there was a lot of similarities
[1:14:47] with tuta
[1:14:51] also out of the midst of thereof came
[1:14:53] the likeness of four
[1:14:54] living creatures and this was their
[1:14:58] appearance
[1:14:58] they had the likeness of a man and
[1:15:01] everyone had four faces and everyone had
[1:15:04] four wings and their feet were straight
[1:15:06] feet
[1:15:06] and the sole of their feet was like the
[1:15:08] soul of the cat's foot and they sparkle
[1:15:11] like the color of
[1:15:12] burnished brass brass judgment so
[1:15:15] these you know this is the way they
[1:15:18] appear in a vision they're they're in
[1:15:20] it's a spirit right these are spirits
[1:15:22] these are
[1:15:23] angels they're anointings you know so
[1:15:26] and this is the way they appear to to
[1:15:28] ezekiel how he saw it you know
[1:15:31] so it's it's just like i said the new
[1:15:34] testament is very symbolic it uses a lot
[1:15:36] of symbols there
[1:15:37] now we are about to see this unfold now
[1:15:40] we are seeing a better picture of the
[1:15:42] cherubim
[1:15:43] that we had seen thus far so up to this
[1:15:45] point because
[1:15:47] you can see it in exodus there's a lot
[1:15:50] of references to cherubims when they
[1:15:52] were doing the tabernacle in the
[1:15:54] wilderness and
[1:15:55] they were on the curtains and all of
[1:15:56] these things but this is just more
[1:15:58] clarity
[1:15:59] here so let's just skip in a bunch if
[1:16:01] you're going to do cherubims you would
[1:16:02] go into exodus and those
[1:16:04] those uh chapters and the chair rooms
[1:16:07] were lifted up
[1:16:09] and this is the living creature that i
[1:16:11] saw by the river of
[1:16:12] chavarra so he's now pointing it back to
[1:16:16] chapter one here he's on chapter 10 now
[1:16:18] and he's he's shown that
[1:16:19] just the same one i saw before you know
[1:16:21] so you can kind of take that description
[1:16:23] that description and get more of a
[1:16:24] picture right
[1:16:28] ezekiel 10 and the living creature that
[1:16:30] i saw under
[1:16:31] the god of israel by the river of chabar
[1:16:35] and i knew that they were the cherubims
[1:16:37] everyone had four faces of peace and
[1:16:39] every one
[1:16:40] four wings and the likeness the hands of
[1:16:42] a man was under their wings
[1:16:44] and the likeness of their faces was the
[1:16:46] same faces which i saw
[1:16:48] by the river of shabar their appearances
[1:16:51] and themselves they went everyone
[1:16:54] straight
[1:16:55] forward but mentions that you know with
[1:16:56] the gospels because
[1:16:58] they guided the gospels and they would
[1:17:00] go straight forward you know he mentions
[1:17:01] that in the quotes i don't have it here
[1:17:03] but he does
[1:17:04] the living creatures are cherubim they
[1:17:07] have four faces their wings are
[1:17:09] are without and touching each other two
[1:17:11] wings up they have two wings up and two
[1:17:13] wings cover
[1:17:14] they cover them they're down but they
[1:17:16] cover themselves with the wings they
[1:17:17] have
[1:17:18] four wings
[1:17:21] and their feet were straight feet and
[1:17:23] they
[1:17:24] sparkle like the color of burnished
[1:17:27] brass brass has always
[1:17:28] signifies judgment and
[1:17:31] and he and now we'll go over to
[1:17:33] revelation and it's describing
[1:17:35] uh christ in in the
[1:17:38] first chapter and his feet like unto
[1:17:40] fine brass
[1:17:41] as if they burned in a furnace and his
[1:17:43] voice as the sound of many
[1:17:45] waters people right water is always
[1:17:47] people
[1:17:48] so a judgment here again you know
[1:17:50] showing the
[1:17:52] likeness christ again now in this age
[1:17:55] as he is coming as a judge girded about
[1:17:57] the ways that the judge is girded
[1:17:59] and the brass has to do with judgments
[1:18:01] powerfully are and then cherubs and then
[1:18:03] the regular angels right although
[1:18:06] gabriel is the you know head of all the
[1:18:08] angels right
[1:18:11] so that's that's just what what i just
[1:18:13] conjured up so here's the one reference
[1:18:15] there to the
[1:18:15] seraphims in the year that king uzziah
[1:18:18] died
[1:18:19] from earlier scripture i saw also the
[1:18:20] lord sitting upon the throne high and
[1:18:22] lifted up and his train filled the
[1:18:23] temple
[1:18:24] and it stood the seraphims each one had
[1:18:27] six wings with
[1:18:28] two he covered his face and with twain
[1:18:31] he covered
[1:18:32] his feet and with twain he did fly and
[1:18:35] and
[1:18:36] one cried unto another and said holy
[1:18:38] holy holy is the lord of hosts and the
[1:18:39] whole
[1:18:40] earth is full of his glory and the post
[1:18:42] of the door
[1:18:43] moved at the voice of him that cried and
[1:18:46] the house
[1:18:46] was filled with smoke so it kind of
[1:18:50] symbolic here in the mercy seat here in
[1:18:52] the ark of the covenant just a picture
[1:18:54] of it
[1:18:57] so i think that was it that's how just a
[1:19:00] kind of a brief
[1:19:01] brief uh view of uh cherubims
[1:19:05] so just clarify some things it was just
[1:19:08] some people just don't don't always kind
[1:19:10] of get it cleared there so
[1:19:12] i just did a bit of research on this
[1:19:15] hope it helps i hear it
[1:19:16] uh thought it was at the end but here
[1:19:19] you see
[1:19:20] uh pictures of angels here and of course
[1:19:22] the same one here
[1:19:23] on the things and so different different
[1:19:25] curtains and things if you go back and
[1:19:27] exodus describe
[1:19:28] different embroidery that's done on the
[1:19:30] curtains and things
[1:19:32] in the uh in the temple in the
[1:19:35] wilderness right
[1:19:37] and the ark of the covenant and et
[1:19:39] cetera et cetera so
[1:19:40] shown you know what what they saw in
[1:19:42] heaven is what
[1:19:44] was made here on earth so they could see
[1:19:46] the real
[1:19:47] the real ones were there up in heaven
[1:19:50] around
[1:19:50] the throne and things like that so that
[1:19:53] was the idea of it
[1:19:56] the chairman a two of them are
[1:19:57] embroidered under curtains in the
[1:19:59] tabernacle of the
[1:20:00] in the wilderness on the veil just
[1:20:02] before you go into the holy of holies
[1:20:04] here there are two large cherubim there
[1:20:06] embroidered under curtains
[1:20:08] you know and in exit and thou shalt make
[1:20:11] a
[1:20:11] veil of blue purple and scarlet and fine
[1:20:14] twined linen of cunning work with
[1:20:18] cherubims shall it be made and thou
[1:20:20] shall hang it
[1:20:21] upon four pillars of shooting wood
[1:20:24] overlay with gold their hooks shall be
[1:20:27] of gold
[1:20:28] upon the four sockets of silver so a
[1:20:31] whole bunch of things in there
[1:20:32] around cherubims and that different
[1:20:34] things
[1:20:36] so do you so just a little bit more here
[1:20:39] from the
[1:20:40] new testament side of it and what
[1:20:42] brother brian said do you think that god
[1:20:45] don't put a guard around his words see
[1:20:48] if that oxlon man eagle
[1:20:50] isn't still sitting at those gates right
[1:20:52] here on earth right now
[1:20:54] here's the gospels the four gospels and
[1:20:56] you notice every
[1:20:57] every way they went they went straight
[1:20:59] forward that's the cherubims
[1:21:01] go straight forward right and they don't
[1:21:03] contradict one another
[1:21:05] they stay with one another one goes with
[1:21:07] the shrewdness of a man
[1:21:09] the other one goes with the swiftness of
[1:21:11] the eagle the other one's a pastor
[1:21:13] wanted one's evangelist to fly like
[1:21:16] evangelists that's
[1:21:17] kidri thinks and see the other ones
[1:21:21] pastors the other one's sturdy the other
[1:21:24] one shrewds he guarded on every side
[1:21:27] guard god guarding the holy ghost gospel
[1:21:30] believe it brother all right shown you
[1:21:33] know it's it's
[1:21:34] it's a it's a guardian right you know
[1:21:36] and it guards the five-fold ministry and
[1:21:38] they're different the five-fold ministry
[1:21:39] is different to
[1:21:40] each one has a different uh job to do
[1:21:44] in the in the in the body and they're
[1:21:46] they're all
[1:21:47] chained together it's a fold you know
[1:21:49] like here you fold like it's a
[1:21:51] you know it's folded five ways and it's
[1:21:53] but it's all together
[1:21:55] it's all one you know so you know it's
[1:21:57] used for the edification and the
[1:22:00] bride the body needs all of that just
[1:22:02] like
[1:22:03] you know it's like in nourishment it's
[1:22:05] all down in five you know
[1:22:06] protein and all and all of that you eat
[1:22:09] and it goes down into a chemical and
[1:22:11] helps your body
[1:22:12] right but you need all those chemicals
[1:22:13] and you need all these chemicals as well
[1:22:16] you know it's the same same concept you
[1:22:19] know that
[1:22:20] can't be just one right
[1:22:23] it's like you're eating carbs all the
[1:22:25] time you know or something you know you
[1:22:27] need
[1:22:28] those different things you need teachers
[1:22:29] you need evangelists you need
[1:22:31] those things for different needs right
[1:22:34] god dressed up in his church these
[1:22:37] offices and god's dress where
[1:22:39] when they see those officers pastors
[1:22:41] teachers evangelists what is that that's
[1:22:43] god's
[1:22:43] dress where god's presence god's spirit
[1:22:46] working
[1:22:47] through man right putting on the whole
[1:22:48] armor of god
[1:22:50] amen so that's
[1:22:53] so that's uh the cheer from sunday
[1:22:55] school
[1:22:56] now this is uh the second part of the
[1:22:59] sun
[1:23:00] this is sunday school today right so uh
[1:23:03] and i'm a sunday school teacher so so uh
[1:23:06] it's where i'm comfortable so in this
[1:23:09] this here we're just gonna
[1:23:10] just gonna run through a little bit of a
[1:23:13] church age uh things just to kind of
[1:23:15] show the what's happening in the church
[1:23:19] ages
[1:23:20] just a little bit just church ages in
[1:23:23] uh once you know
[1:23:26] the apostles really start going off the
[1:23:28] scene
[1:23:29] so you see dave pentecost then there was
[1:23:32] a period
[1:23:33] and the church ages never really started
[1:23:35] till brother bryan put it like 56 a.d or
[1:23:38] something so
[1:23:39] from say if if if you go at the
[1:23:42] day of pentecost being 33 a.d there's
[1:23:44] about 20 or 30 years in there
[1:23:46] where the apostles were working and
[1:23:48] things like that they started going off
[1:23:49] the scene of course
[1:23:50] and then john wasn't john was still here
[1:23:53] he died of natural death he was the only
[1:23:54] apostle did
[1:23:56] and he john when john
[1:23:59] went to the art of patmos and which was
[1:24:02] uh
[1:24:02] you know a pill colony and he
[1:24:06] saw the for two years the visions of
[1:24:08] revelation
[1:24:09] that were shown them paul was gone there
[1:24:11] and you know and there was a lot of them
[1:24:12] gone so
[1:24:13] right then it was the start of the
[1:24:15] church age so so
[1:24:16] and we're seeing how quickly things
[1:24:18] happen so if we want to turn we're going
[1:24:20] to turn for this one
[1:24:21] revelation two mighty my notes
[1:24:31] and just just read a bit of this and
[1:24:33] just just see the falling away that
[1:24:35] happened in here really quick and it was
[1:24:38] all
[1:24:39] planned of course we know that
[1:24:43] and just see how we do with this so
[1:24:47] revelation chapter 2 and verse 1
[1:24:52] and this is the ephesian age the first
[1:24:53] age and we'll just read a little bit of
[1:24:55] this just to give us an idea here so
[1:24:57] just
[1:24:57] help you a little bit if you're doing
[1:24:58] your own reading too right so unto the
[1:25:00] angel of the church of the ephesus right
[1:25:03] these things saith he that holds the
[1:25:05] seven stars in his right hands who
[1:25:07] walked in the midst of the seven golden
[1:25:09] candlesticks
[1:25:10] so that first line he's going back to
[1:25:12] chapter one and jesus has shown
[1:25:14] himself and he he he addresses all the
[1:25:17] seven ages
[1:25:18] with things from the first chapter he
[1:25:20] puts these in because
[1:25:21] he's going to be there in a certain
[1:25:23] capacity and he
[1:25:24] and he shows what kind of capacity he's
[1:25:27] going to be there in the
[1:25:28] in the in the first stage in the first
[1:25:31] chapter and
[1:25:32] he has he has different uh we know that
[1:25:36] the uh the ages was a portion
[1:25:39] of of the word you know each age and it
[1:25:42] was only in this age
[1:25:44] when the uh when all the ages came in
[1:25:47] together to the full word
[1:25:49] so at this point when john came off the
[1:25:51] whole thing was sealed
[1:25:53] and christ was there in the in the
[1:25:55] church and the cherubims you know there
[1:25:57] was
[1:25:57] this was the white the white horse rider
[1:25:59] was uh uh
[1:26:00] moving in this period but also
[1:26:03] the lion was there on the chair that
[1:26:05] that part of it was there
[1:26:07] to protect for three ages you know the
[1:26:10] saints that were in there and to protect
[1:26:12] and guard
[1:26:13] that path to the tree of life so he
[1:26:17] god was there in a portion he was there
[1:26:19] just in a
[1:26:21] attribute you know it wasn't the
[1:26:22] fullness it was just
[1:26:24] part and there were seven parts and all
[1:26:26] came together and we know it all came
[1:26:28] together because
[1:26:28] when brother brown saw that that that
[1:26:31] vision up here
[1:26:32] he and it and also in a couple of his
[1:26:34] visions he saw the
[1:26:36] seven seven coming the seven back
[1:26:39] together again they were all grouped
[1:26:40] together
[1:26:40] you know so he sort of knew the fullness
[1:26:43] was back together it was the full
[1:26:44] word but at that point like luther
[1:26:46] didn't have the full word
[1:26:48] you know and and he wasn't a prophet
[1:26:51] either you know so
[1:26:52] but in paul and and brother branham
[1:26:55] you know it was a prophet and it was it
[1:26:58] showed the full word was there right
[1:27:01] little uh introductory so so there's a
[1:27:04] uh he gets a a condemnation to every age
[1:27:08] except philadelphia
[1:27:09] to philadelphia he makes no criticism of
[1:27:11] the philadelphia age
[1:27:13] and and there is a commendation
[1:27:16] to every age except laodicea said
[1:27:19] nothing good about laodicea
[1:27:21] right christ didn't in his intros
[1:27:25] so christ was he was like i said he was
[1:27:27] displayed all through the old testament
[1:27:29] it wasn't jesus of nazareth in the old
[1:27:31] testament who was born of a woman
[1:27:33] when jesus nazar was born he was the
[1:27:35] same person as as the one in the old
[1:27:37] testament
[1:27:38] the life that was in it was the same
[1:27:40] person he wasn't another person
[1:27:42] it was all one person right through you
[1:27:44] know when he was here on earth when the
[1:27:46] old testament new testament
[1:27:47] it was the same same person he was
[1:27:49] revealed himself by measure
[1:27:51] as in moses and joseph was christ in
[1:27:54] measure and
[1:27:55] carried on until it came in the fullness
[1:27:57] of the godhead bodily and was manifested
[1:28:00] in jesus christ so verse 2 and i know
[1:28:03] thy works and thy labor and thy patience
[1:28:07] and how thou canst how thou canst not
[1:28:10] bear bear them which
[1:28:14] are evil and thou has tried them which
[1:28:16] say they are apostles and are not
[1:28:18] and has found them liars so we're into
[1:28:20] the second verse
[1:28:22] here and and it's full of liars
[1:28:25] you know it's already infiltrated you
[1:28:28] know
[1:28:28] so you can see the spirit warfare that's
[1:28:31] going on
[1:28:31] and what they had to deal with so very
[1:28:34] quickly and paul
[1:28:35] paul warned of it and he said you know
[1:28:37] he said that uh
[1:28:40] you know that you know
[1:28:43] we'll be in infiltrated you know with
[1:28:46] with uh
[1:28:47] false apostles and things like that
[1:28:49] peter was also the same way
[1:28:50] all the apostles were warning that these
[1:28:52] times coming and you see it in the first
[1:28:54] age that that legalism really was
[1:28:57] starting to
[1:28:58] to come in and it was starting to creep
[1:29:00] into the church
[1:29:01] and and brother brown says watch
[1:29:05] actually sorry about that i got i got
[1:29:08] this up here
[1:29:09] i've done that before i had a whole
[1:29:11] whole uh
[1:29:13] presentation and i never got off the
[1:29:15] first slide and realized i had these
[1:29:18] and then only then did i click the
[1:29:20] button again
[1:29:22] so here's here's just what i was going
[1:29:25] through here
[1:29:27] so the second verse and legalism is is
[1:29:30] already starting to come in i just
[1:29:32] remembered that i had i had that up so
[1:29:34] brother brown says
[1:29:35] watch uh watch on all all the cults
[1:29:39] of of non-meat eating
[1:29:42] and a legalist that that says i got to
[1:29:45] do so and so
[1:29:46] if i don't speak with tongues if i don't
[1:29:48] do this if i don't shout if i don't
[1:29:50] dance there's something wrong with me
[1:29:52] that's legalism
[1:29:53] we are saved by grace through faith
[1:29:56] right so legalism you know it's yourself
[1:30:00] you know it's not getting yourself out
[1:30:01] of the way and letting christ come in
[1:30:03] you know it's you
[1:30:04] you know who's trying to organize this
[1:30:06] and keep all the score and everything
[1:30:08] like that you know and then oh
[1:30:10] what's that person over there doing and
[1:30:12] there is some
[1:30:13] you know how are all the other people
[1:30:14] doing you know compared to me and you
[1:30:16] know are they doing it right
[1:30:17] i'm doing it right but they're doing it
[1:30:18] wrong you know that kind of things that
[1:30:20] in the church and that could be a light
[1:30:23] you could have a lifetime of that in the
[1:30:24] church but
[1:30:25] you know there's usually a period of
[1:30:26] that there's there's some legalism that
[1:30:28] you look at yourself because you're
[1:30:30] trying to
[1:30:30] line yourself up and and i know lonnie
[1:30:33] jackson said that with legalism you know
[1:30:35] it's okay to use on yourself for a while
[1:30:37] but don't use it on other people
[1:30:39] you know you know you know he
[1:30:42] kind of needed a bit to you know in line
[1:30:45] get yourself lined up in the beginning
[1:30:46] you know but
[1:30:47] you realize that it's christ you know
[1:30:49] you have to get yourself out of the way
[1:30:50] it's not you it's not about me it's not
[1:30:51] about
[1:30:52] what plans i got i got no plan right you
[1:30:55] know i mean
[1:30:56] you can think of something and put it
[1:30:58] before god and
[1:31:00] and go with it but you know it's it's
[1:31:02] got to be according to the word
[1:31:04] right you know the word you know it
[1:31:07] can't be contradictory to word what your
[1:31:08] plans are you know because we're like
[1:31:10] children
[1:31:11] you know and the little children don't
[1:31:12] have this big plan you know in their
[1:31:14] life
[1:31:14] you know at an early age and that's all
[1:31:16] we are spiritually it is
[1:31:18] and you don't have to be by the word i
[1:31:19] remember a minister talking about
[1:31:22] uh it was someone who newly got came
[1:31:25] into the message and
[1:31:27] and they had dance had a dream that they
[1:31:29] were going to be baptized in the name of
[1:31:30] the father-son holy ghost that was a
[1:31:32] dream and she
[1:31:33] really believed it and when it came
[1:31:35] these guys these guys came into the
[1:31:37] message and they had to get re-baptized
[1:31:39] and
[1:31:39] and she she was all for cut the message
[1:31:42] but
[1:31:42] she wanted to get baptized that way
[1:31:44] because god had shown her that
[1:31:46] she was going to get baptized by the
[1:31:48] name of the father son holy olson
[1:31:50] you know that was false because it
[1:31:52] didn't line up with the word if
[1:31:54] it was it was an experience and we don't
[1:31:56] go by experience we go by the word right
[1:31:58] word takes preeminence over experience
[1:32:00] so
[1:32:02] so if not you you'll fall into legalism
[1:32:04] you know because
[1:32:05] you just keep a view of yourself so
[1:32:12] uh just got it in there
[1:32:15] uh nothing what you you've you've done
[1:32:18] it's what he did
[1:32:19] he did what you couldn't do if you could
[1:32:21] have saved yourself
[1:32:22] then he would have he would have had to
[1:32:25] die
[1:32:26] he wouldn't have had have had to die but
[1:32:29] he died in order to save you
[1:32:31] where you could not save yourself right
[1:32:34] so
[1:32:34] it's all about you you it was all about
[1:32:36] him
[1:32:37] not you so the whole thing is
[1:32:42] is there
[1:32:48] so just uh
[1:32:52] carry on here i know thy works in thy
[1:32:55] labor
[1:32:56] and my patience
[1:32:59] same verse so brother bryan is
[1:33:01] indicating that this is where legalism
[1:33:03] is starting to creep into the church
[1:33:05] when you can know
[1:33:06] by that to to mean that the church was
[1:33:09] it was never founded on legalism
[1:33:10] right because he's rebuking it and he's
[1:33:12] saying oh this
[1:33:14] you know uh we're starting to see this
[1:33:16] come in it wasn't there in the beginning
[1:33:18] so it's
[1:33:18] we're not built on legalism you know
[1:33:20] this one that says
[1:33:22] not not interceding for ignorance
[1:33:24] anymore he's interceding for his family
[1:33:26] so it now in this age you know he's
[1:33:29] he's he's uh he's still under throne
[1:33:32] you know uh brother brent says
[1:33:34] revelation 5 is
[1:33:35] wasn't an action chapter and uh he's
[1:33:38] he it comes a time when when there was
[1:33:42] he the blood covered for ignorance you
[1:33:44] know like in luther's
[1:33:45] day you know he said it was just a sprig
[1:33:48] that was out of the ground that's how
[1:33:49] much word they had
[1:33:50] and uh and and they and and he
[1:33:53] talks about here later a little bit but
[1:33:55] it talks about justification
[1:33:57] and and that they had nothing it was
[1:34:01] you know the beast had taken the whole
[1:34:02] thing away they had nothing everything
[1:34:04] was up for sale right
[1:34:05] you know the balances you know uh there
[1:34:08] you know they were weighing
[1:34:09] everything out you know you got to pay
[1:34:10] for this you know whatever you know
[1:34:13] prayer anything that god had freely
[1:34:15] given everything was paid for and
[1:34:17] we came right down to justification and
[1:34:20] and luther then
[1:34:21] who needed someone to take the
[1:34:23] revelation of that and get that back
[1:34:26] you know to be restored right before it
[1:34:28] was all gone there was nothing left
[1:34:30] you know so that that um
[1:34:33] so for the other things that with luther
[1:34:36] it was covered by the blood
[1:34:37] you know he had the holy ghost luther
[1:34:39] martin luther
[1:34:40] had the holy ghost john wesley had the
[1:34:42] holy ghost brother brown says
[1:34:44] but they were covered by the blood
[1:34:46] because just for ignorance because the
[1:34:47] full word was not revealed we're still
[1:34:49] into a partial word but now it's the
[1:34:51] full word
[1:34:52] and he's he's just not ignorance anymore
[1:34:56] right it's all revealed now it's all
[1:34:58] opened up
[1:34:59] but do we understand it all no we don't
[1:35:02] and we go by faith right but it is
[1:35:05] opened up
[1:35:05] it's all revealed you know he's
[1:35:08] interceding
[1:35:09] for his family right that's who he's his
[1:35:12] seed now he's
[1:35:13] he's uh uh that grace is starting to
[1:35:16] slip off here
[1:35:17] you know now starting to pull away from
[1:35:19] the earth and as the bride goes
[1:35:20] all of it goes right you know the less
[1:35:23] and less bride the less and less grace
[1:35:25] but we're you know he's he's still on
[1:35:27] the throne interceding
[1:35:29] for the bride of jesus christ his family
[1:35:32] but iran said that that he must continue
[1:35:34] in that office until the last name is
[1:35:36] brought in right once that's declared
[1:35:38] upon the earth that's it it's over right
[1:35:41] and thou has tried them which say they
[1:35:43] are apostles
[1:35:44] he's commending the church that they're
[1:35:46] still willing to to back and try spirits
[1:35:49] according to the word not by experience
[1:35:52] but by word
[1:35:53] brother brown said away with the
[1:35:55] experience as your measuring line right
[1:35:56] we just covered that right so
[1:35:58] it's not experienced so word is the
[1:36:00] measuring line word the word is god the
[1:36:02] word is christ
[1:36:04] and that comes first and thou has tried
[1:36:06] them that say they are
[1:36:08] apostles and they're not and has found
[1:36:10] them liars you see this is the ephesians
[1:36:12] church right i mean this is uh
[1:36:14] this is the best church here best church
[1:36:16] age right
[1:36:18] brother brenham and we see it here you
[1:36:20] know like there's
[1:36:21] there's darkness and light here you know
[1:36:23] right up to here where there's really no
[1:36:25] really in essence no light at all you
[1:36:28] know so
[1:36:29] brother brown said the the way that they
[1:36:31] did it was they
[1:36:32] they would judge them by the by what
[1:36:35] paul taught
[1:36:36] that's our measuring line today we
[1:36:37] believe with the message we have that
[1:36:39] anyone that teaches contrary to that
[1:36:41] message is not teaching what paul
[1:36:42] taught right this message that came to
[1:36:45] us is the restoration of paul's teaching
[1:36:47] completely sealed in
[1:36:48] john's days unsealed in this day
[1:36:52] liars showing that deception in the
[1:36:54] church right so
[1:36:55] we we you know brother brown says you
[1:36:57] know uh
[1:36:58] you know when he was in beyond the
[1:37:00] curtain of time and they said
[1:37:02] uh you know
[1:37:05] in his uh vision and he said you know
[1:37:07] well he taught what
[1:37:08] palti and and and then he heard the
[1:37:10] response you know we're counting on that
[1:37:12] right so
[1:37:13] that was uh that's what we do today with
[1:37:17] you know there's nothing
[1:37:18] blurred right added nothing new to the
[1:37:20] word he can't right
[1:37:22] you know it was ordained
[1:37:25] and thou has found them liars he's he's
[1:37:28] commending the age you have
[1:37:29] cut liars in your midst and you're
[1:37:31] you've identified them and you were
[1:37:33] right well done
[1:37:35] and this is uh it's actually actively
[1:37:38] operating through the church because
[1:37:40] he didn't send a prophet in to say you
[1:37:42] know in that age they didn't have a
[1:37:43] prophet and to say
[1:37:44] you know to discern said this one's
[1:37:47] wrong and that one is a liar and this
[1:37:49] one
[1:37:49] he's a jew and he's really not and god
[1:37:52] didn't need to do that because the bride
[1:37:54] had the discernment of spirit within her
[1:37:56] you know that was different in that age
[1:37:58] right
[1:37:58] and by her life she's proving that she
[1:38:01] can in an
[1:38:02] active manifestation of what he said he
[1:38:04] would be in chapter one and that exists
[1:38:05] today for the bride right we still have
[1:38:07] that through all of the ages
[1:38:08] is is the spirit in the bride it's him
[1:38:10] and the bride who's doing these things
[1:38:12] and not necessarily a separate prophet
[1:38:14] right when they saw
[1:38:15] you know things like the jews coming in
[1:38:16] and say well we have this and this so
[1:38:18] we're above
[1:38:19] uh you know the gentiles and all those
[1:38:21] kinds of things that was going on in the
[1:38:22] church ages
[1:38:24] so i'm just i'm just going through a
[1:38:25] couple of verses there just kind of give
[1:38:27] you an idea
[1:38:28] of the condition of that church and in
[1:38:31] in verse 3
[1:38:32] here it says and and and has borne and
[1:38:35] has patience and for my name's sake has
[1:38:37] labored
[1:38:37] and has not fainted these are difficult
[1:38:39] times you know being described right
[1:38:41] he says for my sake and so you're taking
[1:38:43] a stand for for
[1:38:45] true christian baptism and in in future
[1:38:47] ages
[1:38:48] he'll come up and he'll come up and say
[1:38:51] you know in the future ages you have a
[1:38:53] name for which you think you're saved
[1:38:54] but you're dead by that time the trinity
[1:38:57] has taken over in the future ages right
[1:38:59] so there's nothing left of
[1:39:00] the name or the the baptism as we know
[1:39:03] it today it doesn't get restored until
[1:39:05] the end
[1:39:06] that baptizing in those titles of father
[1:39:08] son and holy ghost but here's the
[1:39:09] ephesian church age
[1:39:11] that for my name's sake has labor in it
[1:39:13] and has not fainted so you know
[1:39:14] in this age in that age it was it was
[1:39:17] good they kept up the
[1:39:18] the name nevertheless i have somewhat
[1:39:21] against thee because
[1:39:22] thou has left thy first love right in
[1:39:24] verse four
[1:39:26] thou already you know in in the early
[1:39:28] age you know just leaving their first
[1:39:30] love now this is the age where they
[1:39:31] began to lose their first love and he's
[1:39:33] noticing its works and labors is coming
[1:39:36] in right
[1:39:36] it's legalism brother brandon points to
[1:39:38] legalism creeping in and we find out
[1:39:40] by our human nature that that we easily
[1:39:43] fall into legalism it's human nature to
[1:39:45] keep a scorecard of your life we have to
[1:39:47] continue to be reminded of the grace of
[1:39:49] almighty god and that's the
[1:39:51] natural way we are and we have to fight
[1:39:52] that today you know is those things
[1:39:54] right
[1:39:55] we have to get out of the way it's not
[1:39:56] about us right you know it's the word
[1:39:59] you know and you know the word has been
[1:40:01] given
[1:40:02] paul peter and jesus spent a lot of time
[1:40:04] talking about the grace that comes
[1:40:06] from god they were beginning to relax
[1:40:10] the standards of what the new birth
[1:40:11] meant and what it would
[1:40:13] would take to receive the new birth
[1:40:15] paul's doctrine is already
[1:40:16] starting to creep in individuals are
[1:40:18] already starting to make
[1:40:20] more out of themselves and you get
[1:40:22] kingdom builders already rising up
[1:40:24] people saying you can't listen to john
[1:40:25] this is the spirit warfare
[1:40:27] right that's going on in the ages right
[1:40:28] that's happening
[1:40:30] peter had to face ananias and sapphira
[1:40:32] simon faces the sorcerer who had
[1:40:34] all this influence amongst the people
[1:40:36] and paul was constantly
[1:40:38] constantly battle against the judiciary
[1:40:40] judas
[1:40:41] jew desire
[1:40:44] right and you see that in galatians
[1:40:47] there you know he
[1:40:48] speaks to them
[1:40:52] paul calleth called it after that after
[1:40:56] my departing shall grievous wolves
[1:40:58] enter in among you not sparing the flock
[1:41:00] in acts
[1:41:02] holy the holy spirit interprets
[1:41:10] i get that the holy spirit interprets it
[1:41:12] in john's prophecy that you're going to
[1:41:14] leave your first love
[1:41:15] you're going to start having legalism
[1:41:17] coming and you're going to be all about
[1:41:19] works right and of course that's that's
[1:41:21] the problem world today is works right
[1:41:23] the whole thing is works it's gone over
[1:41:25] the works right you know when
[1:41:27] you meet people and like well you know i
[1:41:29] did this and this if that's not good
[1:41:30] enough for god well why
[1:41:32] they'll try my best you know that's the
[1:41:33] way it is right you know
[1:41:35] i got i got to i got to do it right
[1:41:39] and if that's not good enough well what
[1:41:40] am i going to do
[1:41:46] and you you really used to see that in
[1:41:47] the catholic church it was all works but
[1:41:49] now it's it's just you know
[1:41:50] every you you notice it was talking to
[1:41:52] other people nevertheless i have
[1:41:54] somewhat against thee
[1:41:55] because thou has left thy first law of
[1:41:57] still on that thy tire
[1:41:59] that's all they got left was works they
[1:42:01] had nothing left by the time the fourth
[1:42:02] age came
[1:42:04] with the red horse rider the age is so
[1:42:07] dark i
[1:42:08] i won't even put everything else upon
[1:42:12] you
[1:42:15] he said in the in that age the catholic
[1:42:16] church had turned into
[1:42:18] wax candles purgatory praying to saints
[1:42:21] rosary beads virgin mary et cetera right
[1:42:23] the whole thing was corrupt
[1:42:24] we know that luther has given the
[1:42:26] command to get a hold of that last
[1:42:27] element
[1:42:28] that the just shall live in christ by
[1:42:31] his faith strength
[1:42:32] that which is about to die right
[1:42:35] that has never been threatened again
[1:42:37] since the dark ages because that's what
[1:42:39] all protestants establish on soul once
[1:42:41] god gave that that was it that
[1:42:42] that was in there he'll never take it
[1:42:44] back and justification is there i know i
[1:42:46] heard about it friday
[1:42:48] it's still there you know
[1:42:51] that's established you know that that
[1:42:53] will never change right
[1:42:57] god complaining to the church you're
[1:42:59] falling away from the purpose of my
[1:43:00] dying
[1:43:01] you're falling away from grace you're
[1:43:03] falling away from the fact that i love
[1:43:04] you your f you're trying to serve me
[1:43:06] by works and you'll never do it israel
[1:43:08] couldn't do it i only gave them the law
[1:43:10] to prove that they couldn't do
[1:43:12] keep it man cannot live by bread alone
[1:43:15] right
[1:43:16] you know amen they need him they need
[1:43:18] the spirit right
[1:43:22] spoken word is your original seed now
[1:43:23] for the birth of the word
[1:43:25] is christ not of polluted not of
[1:43:27] polluted with denominations the early
[1:43:30] church
[1:43:30] no denominations just the word and the
[1:43:33] spirit
[1:43:34] irrigated god laid the word down
[1:43:38] like that and the holy spirit irrigated
[1:43:40] it
[1:43:41] and there she went she brought forth
[1:43:44] children
[1:43:44] certainly amen so denominations
[1:43:48] you know is is when man's ideas come in
[1:43:50] right
[1:43:51] when it's no longer the pure word as
[1:43:53] soon as man ideas come in
[1:43:56] then it goes to a denomination and the
[1:43:58] spirit moves away
[1:43:59] you know and usually it's just five
[1:44:01] years that's kind of what the number
[1:44:03] they kind of give it to it doesn't take
[1:44:04] long
[1:44:05] before they organize and to get
[1:44:07] everything organized but brother bram
[1:44:09] says it's logical but you cannot
[1:44:11] come up with your own and the accompli
[1:44:13] all it is is compromise because you may
[1:44:14] have
[1:44:15] you end up with two two different ideas
[1:44:18] and they got a compromise
[1:44:20] right and you know they got two ways of
[1:44:22] looking at the word and what that means
[1:44:24] and ends up with your own
[1:44:25] right so it's very easy to fall into
[1:44:27] that
[1:44:28] but the church can't do it she's too
[1:44:31] denominate
[1:44:32] too denominated she can't do it she's
[1:44:34] got the world
[1:44:35] mixed up with her right
[1:44:40] and we definitely see that today in this
[1:44:42] you know last age right
[1:44:46] anytime you allow the world to be mixed
[1:44:48] with your fate you become sterile
[1:44:50] and cannot produce the life of krait it
[1:44:52] affects effectively hinders you
[1:44:55] right and this is what happened in the
[1:44:56] ages right from the beginning
[1:44:58] and you see the decline here you know
[1:44:59] you see with the light going right
[1:45:02] all the time right so it's uh
[1:45:06] it's a good view of all of it oh a
[1:45:08] little bit one more
[1:45:10] he that heads in here let him hear what
[1:45:11] the spirit saith unto the churches he
[1:45:13] that overcometh shall be hurt of the
[1:45:15] second death
[1:45:16] if we keep the flus cleaned out and keep
[1:45:18] your heart pure then god
[1:45:20] in you is able to handle anything you
[1:45:22] can face
[1:45:24] we have to have the sword with two edges
[1:45:27] because that's the only thing that will
[1:45:29] stop a devil
[1:45:31] that's going to stop the devil from
[1:45:33] taking your home your family your
[1:45:35] marriage your finances and your health
[1:45:37] right that's that's that's the only
[1:45:39] thing you got
[1:45:42] are rewarded in the last day is what
[1:45:44] we'll be granted to
[1:45:46] that we'll be granted to eat of the tree
[1:45:48] of life and have a crown and be seated
[1:45:50] with christ
[1:45:52] if you're a believer today you've
[1:45:54] already overcome
[1:45:56] we have already understood and overcome
[1:45:58] and the only thing
[1:45:59] that we're going that we're doing here
[1:46:01] is daily
[1:46:02] allowing christ to live more and more in
[1:46:05] our lives
[1:46:09] end time evangelism the end time message
[1:46:12] is to get the bride ready and prepared
[1:46:14] for the rapture
[1:46:16] what can it do according to malachi 4 to
[1:46:18] bring them back to the faith that was
[1:46:20] once delivered to the saints
[1:46:22] bring them back to the faith of the
[1:46:23] fathers the pentecostal part
[1:46:26] in the restoration time i will restore
[1:46:28] saith the lord
[1:46:29] that's real event end time evangelism
[1:46:33] amen that's it we're at the end
[1:46:37] we've seen and accepted the last sign
[1:46:41] to the gentile right that's how late
[1:46:43] late we are
[1:46:44] right just a couple of quotes here on
[1:46:46] brother brown said about the
[1:46:48] sign at the end right and he said
[1:46:51] she run into the city we know who that
[1:46:53] is at the woman at the well in in john 4
[1:46:55] and said
[1:46:56] come see a man see a man told me
[1:47:00] that i've done isn't that the very
[1:47:03] messiah
[1:47:04] if that was the sign of the messiah to
[1:47:06] the jew and to the samaritan
[1:47:08] he is no respecter of persons the same
[1:47:12] yesterday today
[1:47:13] and forever and that was the ending
[1:47:16] when god stopped dealing with jews and
[1:47:19] samaritans
[1:47:20] and this is the end end of the gentile
[1:47:22] dispensation
[1:47:24] when he has come up through reformers
[1:47:26] and so forth to the end and promised
[1:47:28] as it was in the days of abraham so
[1:47:30] shall it be
[1:47:31] when the son of man is being revealed to
[1:47:34] the gentiles
[1:47:35] in the last day he would return again
[1:47:38] amen
[1:47:43] now look i want to ask something what
[1:47:45] what he does
[1:47:48] i'm cutting off here just today jamming
[1:47:51] too much in
[1:47:56] what if he does come tonight oh say he
[1:47:59] isn't coming
[1:48:00] i don't know whether he is or not this
[1:48:03] is the last sign
[1:48:04] remember thus say it to the lord did you
[1:48:06] ever hear me say
[1:48:08] that but what it was true you are seeing
[1:48:11] you're seeing your last sign it's
[1:48:12] brother i'm standing up there in the
[1:48:14] meeting and he's saying
[1:48:15] you're seeing your last sign right here
[1:48:18] that's scriptural
[1:48:19] you've seen your last sign pentecost
[1:48:21] don't get mixed up now with what he
[1:48:23] promised
[1:48:24] israel after the rapture that he that
[1:48:26] ain't you
[1:48:28] you're done then now is your day now is
[1:48:31] your sign now is your time don't reject
[1:48:33] it
[1:48:33] don't do it you've better come you'd
[1:48:36] better come you believe
[1:48:38] me to be god's servant remember so that
[1:48:40] was the last
[1:48:41] there's no sign there was no sign after
[1:48:42] that you were not looking for anything
[1:48:44] right
[1:48:45] the next thing is the coming of the
