[42:43] amen god bless us amen we welcome us all
[42:46] to the service this morning and pray the
[42:48] lord bless you amen
[42:50] in the going forth of the word and i
[42:52] pray god bless you in the receiving of
[42:54] the word amen and the lord willing this
[42:56] morning we're going to hear the prophet
[42:58] of god
[42:59] minister
[43:00] and
[43:01] the sermon that we that i've chosen
[43:04] it is a part of the revelation of jesus
[43:06] christ
[43:07] amen and when it was first published it
[43:10] was published as who is william branham
[43:13] and so that wasn't the correct title and
[43:16] of course the brother brown takes a very
[43:17] serious stand here
[43:19] in this message concerning
[43:22] well the revelation of jesus christ and
[43:24] and now they've entitled it uh bruce
[43:27] serpent
[43:28] well he gets in there and he begins to
[43:30] highlight the the attitude of the people
[43:33] and even in his own tabernacle as i've
[43:34] said there's too many times that the
[43:36] prophet god has had to rebuke branham
[43:38] tabernacle he's had to rebuke
[43:41] a lot of the believers there because of
[43:42] their attitude and because of the spirit
[43:45] that they had not just toward the word
[43:47] not jewish toward the message but toward
[43:48] him amen and he does highlight it again
[43:51] here in this message that the the idea
[43:54] and the thoughts that they were saying
[43:56] about william branham oh
[43:58] he really took his stand
[44:00] and he was he was very very very serious
[44:03] and of course he did before and he did
[44:06] here i believe i like that he maybe
[44:09] would would leave the ministry why
[44:11] because of the attitude that people had
[44:14] because of what people were thinking
[44:16] about him and he said no he said you do
[44:18] that you're going to make me antichrist
[44:21] and he said i'm not going to do that he
[44:22] said he would step out of the ministry
[44:25] if they insisted on it oh yeah he took a
[44:28] serious stand so brother and i'll tell
[44:30] you this he'd be taking a serious stand
[44:32] in this hour too
[44:33] oh yes after all these years since he's
[44:36] been gone amen and and god is still
[44:38] requiring of us the message
[44:41] oh yes you're requiring of us to reveal
[44:43] word so brother what is our attitude now
[44:46] toward the word not just back then but
[44:48] what is our attitude now after uh well
[44:51] almost 60 years since well yeah 60 years
[44:54] since he ministered this one
[44:56] so and it's been almost way around i
[44:58] guess 55 years since the god has called
[45:00] him uh yeah more than that
[45:03] quite a quite a number of years off the
[45:04] scene
[45:05] so where's what what faith do we have
[45:07] now
[45:08] amen god was looking for a great faith
[45:10] then he's looking for a greater faith
[45:12] now when we consider all that we have
[45:15] heard and all that we have read and
[45:18] concerning the message of the hour oh
[45:20] brother
[45:21] the bible god did i like
[45:24] and he said back way back in the in in
[45:26] the early 60s again he said now he said
[45:28] i know he said that this message he said
[45:31] is not striking your right amen it's
[45:34] just not striking me right
[45:36] well even what concerning what
[45:38] concerning what god had done concerning
[45:40] what god was doing and concerning our
[45:42] are facing the reality of the hour that
[45:45] we're living or it didn't really strike
[45:47] them then is it really striking that's
[45:49] not now concerning the end
[45:52] concerning that it's over concerning
[45:54] that it is finished amen concerning that
[45:57] god has brought his last message to the
[46:00] gentiles amen that there's not another
[46:03] revival coming no no brother we're
[46:06] supposed to be in the bride revival
[46:08] that's taking us into the rapture
[46:10] taking us into the resurrection so
[46:12] brother how is the word that was the
[46:14] message of the hour striking you
[46:16] amen brother i trust by grace that we're
[46:18] not just like any denomination and as i
[46:21] said all this this oh this is a creed uh
[46:24] we believe this and they get another
[46:26] message book oh we believe that we
[46:27] believe this
[46:28] and to a lot of believers there's no
[46:30] more than a creed
[46:31] that's right but to the right it's faith
[46:35] to the right it's absolutely real
[46:37] genuine faith they got a revelation of
[46:39] what god is doing amen not just what he
[46:42] did two too many this is what he did
[46:45] 1961. yeah when he preached the series
[46:49] on the revelation of jesus christ oh
[46:51] yeah and and first when it was printed
[46:53] they printed the the title who is
[46:56] william branham
[46:57] well he wouldn't he wouldn't appreciate
[46:59] that not by any means
[47:01] right and again the
[47:04] they they also printed it and they read
[47:06] this one right here and and they've
[47:08] entitled it bruised serpent no that's
[47:11] not what he preached on
[47:13] not the brute serpent not who is william
[47:15] branham no no it was revelation chapter
[47:18] 5 and it's the revelation of god
[47:20] revelation of christ in these last days
[47:23] amen so what revelation do you have of
[47:26] jesus what does jesus mean to you
[47:29] amen to many it's not jesus as william
[47:32] branham oh he too really took his stand
[47:35] against it and he blasted it oh yeah
[47:38] threatening to leave the ministry if
[47:40] they kept up
[47:41] saying oh william branham it was jesus
[47:43] william ran him as the united messiah
[47:45] william branham is there no he said he
[47:47] was just a messenger
[47:48] amen
[47:50] oh yeah because again he said that's why
[47:52] he said that the message is not striking
[47:54] you right
[47:55] he said because he says not striking me
[47:57] right
[47:58] well that was william branham himself
[47:59] that was the messenger amen how did he
[48:02] know that amen by by the attitude action
[48:05] reaction of the people oh yeah he knew
[48:08] it should do this it should do that but
[48:10] they were just getting just getting in
[48:12] involved in william branham just getting
[48:14] involved you know they wanted william
[48:15] branham why they wanted william branham
[48:17] for more of the signs and wonders amen
[48:20] not the word not the message but again
[48:23] brother when when he was commissioned he
[48:25] was he was commissioned he was ordained
[48:28] to get the people to believe the message
[48:31] to believe the word amen he said go do
[48:34] this go to he said i'll give you this
[48:36] sign i'll give you that sign he said get
[48:38] the people to believe amen and not just
[48:41] a sign but to get their attention to the
[48:44] word and get them to believe the word
[48:46] so brother sister are we believing the
[48:48] word
[48:50] are we believing the message are we
[48:52] believing what god has done we have
[48:54] praise the lord good
[48:56] are we believing what he's doing
[48:58] amen oh there's too many still caught up
[49:01] with what he's done because they they
[49:03] they didn't get into it the the living
[49:05] word the living revelation no no brother
[49:08] because if you really get into it you
[49:10] really recognize what god did you know
[49:12] what he's doing
[49:13] like why because what he did is pointing
[49:15] us on to what he's doing amen and what
[49:17] he's doing is going to move us on to
[49:19] what he will do
[49:20] and brother there's only one thing left
[49:22] and that's the rapture
[49:24] the only one thing left that's the
[49:25] change of our bodies we want to get out
[49:27] of here

[49:48] need spiritually right brother
[49:51] amen but i'll tell you if anything we
[49:54] need now is the rapture

[1:04:30] finding nothing wrong
[1:04:32] i said you know
[1:04:34] we got talked about back when we were
[1:04:36] boys
[1:04:37] and i said well
[1:04:38] doc i don't know just how long i'm going
[1:04:41] to be around we're both in our 50s and
[1:04:45] he said that's true bill
[1:04:47] i said but all these years about 31
[1:04:50] years of ministry now i have
[1:04:53] kept my heart prepared for that hour
[1:04:55] when he comes so it doesn't matter when
[1:04:57] he comes
[1:04:59] so
[1:04:59] he said that is true i said the greatest
[1:05:02] thrill i have is living for others
[1:05:05] and he said that's what life is makes
[1:05:08] life real
[1:05:09] it's when you not what you can do or
[1:05:12] accomplish for yourself but what you can
[1:05:15] do for others
[1:05:17] that's when you're really living
[1:05:20] and if there happens to be someone among
[1:05:22] us who has never did that
[1:05:25] tried to live for somebody else
[1:05:27] give that a try and you'll see how much
[1:05:30] more life holds for you when you will
[1:05:33] not live for what you can get yourself
[1:05:35] out of life but what you can give
[1:05:37] someone else in life
[1:05:40] and you'll find that it's more blessed
[1:05:42] than riches or anything all
[1:05:45] it can be the thought of is what you can
[1:05:48] do for someone else
[1:05:52] to make life's burdens which life in
[1:05:55] itself is a burden
[1:05:57] and it will make it a little lighter for
[1:05:59] someone else you just don't know the joy
[1:06:02] unless you've tried it once to do
[1:06:04] something for someone else
[1:06:07] then
[1:06:08] that uh
[1:06:10] brings me a thinking of
[1:06:12] 31 years will be soon of ministry for
[1:06:16] the lord
[1:06:18] and i guess every man thinks of some
[1:06:21] time when he has to come to his last
[1:06:24] service and come to his
[1:06:26] uh last hour
[1:06:28] and look back down the path and see what
[1:06:31] has been accomplished
[1:06:33] see what's went on have you did anything
[1:06:37] and if i just said it's what you do for
[1:06:39] others that counts
[1:06:41] i
[1:06:43] often wonder what would be when i got to
[1:06:45] the end of my road
[1:06:47] which we don't know what time that will
[1:06:49] be none of us
[1:06:51] so i thinking about looking back down
[1:06:54] along the trail or i've come to life and
[1:06:57] seeing the different
[1:06:58] hills and briar patches and rocks and
[1:07:02] hard places and smooth runnings and
[1:07:05] what i did in those kind of times it'll
[1:07:07] all show up one of these days at the
[1:07:09] hour am i going away
[1:07:12] and it'll do that on each one of us we
[1:07:14] will all
[1:07:16] be
[1:07:17] sure of that that it'll it'll show up to
[1:07:20] each one when that time comes
[1:07:24] and
[1:07:25] that
[1:07:26] brings me or leads me to say
[1:07:30] something that
[1:07:31] i
[1:07:34] would rather
[1:07:36] run than say
[1:07:38] amen
[1:07:39] it leads me to say something that i
[1:07:44] it grinds my heart to the bottom to say
[1:07:47] it
[1:07:49] but what i say i am forced to say
[1:07:56] realizing that this is being taped in
[1:07:58] the world here
[1:08:01] but i have uh
[1:08:03] left the ministry
[1:08:06] for uh
[1:08:09] a cause that i'm sorry that i have to
[1:08:13] leave far
[1:08:15] and perhaps many of you have heard it i
[1:08:18] closing my office and so forth and
[1:08:21] leaving the field
[1:08:25] i don't know where our lord will lead me
[1:08:28] to
[1:08:29] and that i have no control of or
[1:08:32] whatever he will have for me to do
[1:08:36] but i'm thinking at the end of the road
[1:08:41] where i must come
[1:08:44] down along life's journeys i have made
[1:08:48] so
[1:08:49] many mistakes
[1:08:52] that i am very
[1:08:55] sorry from my heart off
[1:08:59] because of
[1:09:01] i guess being human in weakness and so
[1:09:04] forth causes a person to do things or
[1:09:07] say things that and even act that they
[1:09:10] would not want to act otherwise but
[1:09:13] being the weakness of a human being
[1:09:16] while we
[1:09:17] we have those times
[1:09:20] but
[1:09:22] there
[1:09:23] if there's anything that has been in my
[1:09:27] heart to do
[1:09:29] was to
[1:09:31] hear those words of our lord jesus at
[1:09:34] the end of this journey
[1:09:37] to say it it was well done
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:09:40] my good and faithful servant
[1:09:44] and many times i have said i'd like to
[1:09:46] been standing there when he said come
[1:09:48] unto me
[1:09:50] but i did desire to hear it say well
[1:09:54] done
[1:09:55] that i did not hear the voice in the
[1:09:58] original sake come unto me back in the
[1:10:01] times of the writing of the bible
[1:10:03] but i do desire to hear it say well done
[1:10:07] and if anything i always wanted to be
[1:10:11] and desires in my heart to be
[1:10:13] was a true servant to jesus christ
[1:10:17] my lord and savior
[1:10:20] i want my testimony to be clean clear
[1:10:24] cut
[1:10:26] that i stood in all my mistakes i yet
[1:10:29] loved him with all my heart
[1:10:32] and i do that this morning with all my
[1:10:34] heart and because of that it forces me
[1:10:38] to say
[1:10:39] i'm leaving the ministry
[1:10:43] is because that
[1:10:45] there is something arose up
[1:10:48] amongst the people that's caused me to
[1:10:50] do it
[1:10:51] that is that i have been taken from a
[1:10:54] bracket of a minister our brother and
[1:10:57] been called jesus christ
[1:11:00] and so
[1:11:01] uh call and that would brand me as an
[1:11:04] antichrist
[1:11:06] and i'll meet god as a quitter before i
[1:11:10] would meet him as an anti-christ
[1:11:12] to take away from him
[1:11:15] uh i heard of it a few years ago and i
[1:11:19] thought it was a joke
[1:11:21] and i met a couple brethren which i
[1:11:23] don't see neither one of them
[1:11:25] in the meeting this morning two or three
[1:11:27] of them one time in a fishing trip
[1:11:29] and they approached me by the subject of
[1:11:31] saying brother branham aren't you the
[1:11:33] anointed messiah the christ
[1:11:37] and i put my arms around the neck of
[1:11:39] both brethren or all of them and i said
[1:11:42] brethren
[1:11:43] as much as i have tried to be a true
[1:11:45] servant of christ
[1:11:47] i would not that you would say such a
[1:11:49] thing as that and if it would ever be
[1:11:52] set off me then i will leave the field
[1:11:57] with a clear conscience and you who do
[1:12:00] that will be responsible for every soul
[1:12:04] that i would have saved during that time
[1:12:06] see
[1:12:07] for taking me from the field
[1:12:09] and i thought that ended it and i heard
[1:12:12] it a few more times but it wasn't so
[1:12:15] and the other day in canada
[1:12:18] a brother showed me a little ticket of a
[1:12:20] thing he's packed in his pockets that
[1:12:22] william branham is our lord
[1:12:25] baptizing in the name of william branham
[1:12:27] and a little a precious fib in an enemy
[1:12:30] if he'd been my enemy i would have known
[1:12:32] it was a joke
[1:12:33] but a precious darling brother come up
[1:12:36] to confess his sins and his wrongs and
[1:12:39] his faith in me as being jesus christ
[1:12:43] and i have got
[1:12:44] letters at home and calls from chicago
[1:12:47] and different places asking me if i
[1:12:50] believe that dogma now i got all kinds
[1:12:53] of letters that's come in the last few
[1:12:55] days and calls from different places
[1:12:57] so
[1:12:59] uh
[1:13:00] saying that i was christ
[1:13:03] brethren
[1:13:05] that is a horrible disgraceful
[1:13:09] ungodly
[1:13:11] lie of the devil
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:14] i am your
[1:13:16] brother now
[1:13:18] that would run any person from the field
[1:13:22] that would make anyone that loves christ
[1:13:25] run from the very thing
[1:13:27] i went to the lord here not long ago
[1:13:29] when i first heard it about a year ago
[1:13:32] and then i went to the lord and he
[1:13:34] referred to me to the scripture that
[1:13:36] when john came forth of preaching that
[1:13:40] they hadn't had a prophet on the earth
[1:13:41] for so many years until it would uh
[1:13:45] there's all amazed in their hearts
[1:13:46] thinking maybe john was the messiah
[1:13:49] so then i
[1:13:51] john they went and asked him and he said
[1:13:53] that he was not
[1:13:55] you read that luke the third chapter 15
[1:13:58] first
[1:13:59] and so
[1:14:01] then
[1:14:02] but that kind of quietened down so i let
[1:14:04] it go like that
[1:14:05] but then when it comes to this
[1:14:08] then i know that something must be done
[1:14:11] now i say this that the visions
[1:14:14] and the angel of the lord that appeared
[1:14:17] at the river
[1:14:18] if this is to be my last message or last
[1:14:21] thing to the church to the world those
[1:14:24] things are truth
[1:14:27] as far as the age of the lord
[1:14:30] and i stood still if people call me a
[1:14:32] prophet many times because the prophet
[1:14:34] in the english testament is just a
[1:14:36] preacher
[1:14:37] a prophesier foreteller of the word and
[1:14:40] so forth i'd stand for that because you
[1:14:42] could just kind of push that down but
[1:14:44] when it comes to be calling anointed
[1:14:46] christ or something
[1:14:48] that was too much for me so i just
[1:14:50] couldn't stand that and so then about
[1:14:54] i come after leaving the meeting at
[1:14:57] canada i
[1:14:59] found out that way up in the eskimos or
[1:15:01] the indians up there it got among them
[1:15:05] and so it just tore me all up in the
[1:15:07] hunting trip that i had planned so long
[1:15:10] i could not take it
[1:15:11] i was afraid of a hunting accident if
[1:15:14] you understand what i mean
[1:15:15] i got so shaky worse than i am standing
[1:15:18] here now
[1:15:19] and i just couldn't stand it any longer
[1:15:20] to think that 31 years of ministry went
[1:15:24] down the devil's gutter pipe into the
[1:15:26] when i'm gone what would it say there he
[1:15:28] is that's exactly what it was all the
[1:15:30] influence that i had upon the people
[1:15:32] then you see where to be i'd be an
[1:15:34] antichrist now i just couldn't stand it
[1:15:37] i thought i'd rather die here in the
[1:15:38] woods
[1:15:39] like i fell on my gun or something and
[1:15:41] and i seen i was then i thought about my
[1:15:43] little joseph and so forth that had to
[1:15:45] be raised and
[1:15:46] i was no condition to hunt so i just
[1:15:48] left the woods and come home
[1:15:51] and i've been for about eight or ten
[1:15:53] days and such a fix out of i thought i
[1:15:55] was losing my mind
[1:15:57] and i just asked everybody to stay away
[1:16:00] from me and let me alone because i'm in
[1:16:03] such a fix and nervous and upset and all
[1:16:06] toward the pieces
[1:16:08] and i wondered if it would have been
[1:16:09] some enemy of mine it would have been
[1:16:11] all right but
[1:16:13] i would just laugh at it went on but
[1:16:15] when it come to be precious brothers
[1:16:18] precious sisters then that's what hurt
[1:16:21] me and i said lord the great things too
[1:16:23] great for me i'll just have to walk out
[1:16:25] leave it in your hands i i don't know
[1:16:27] nothing else to do a few nights ago to
[1:16:30] make it sure
[1:16:32] i had a
[1:16:33] visitation from the lord
[1:16:36] and i seen
[1:16:37] a precious one
[1:16:39] a baby a serpent which was yellow and
[1:16:42] black
[1:16:43] and telling me and right along and the
[1:16:45] thing struck me on the leg
[1:16:47] but
[1:16:48] the blood was so rich it didn't take
[1:16:50] effect on me and i looked down there's
[1:16:52] where been bit before
[1:16:54] and i turned quickly with a gun and shot
[1:16:56] the thing and it hit it right in the
[1:16:58] middle of the thing and the brother said
[1:17:01] i've turned with my gun to shoot its
[1:17:03] head off and he said don't do that just
[1:17:05] pick up the stickling in their body you
[1:17:07] want to turn my back to pick up the
[1:17:09] stick it wiggled into some water just a
[1:17:11] small puddle of water
[1:17:13] i said well it can't hurt very much
[1:17:15] longer now because i believe
[1:17:17] the brother realizes the brethren that
[1:17:19] what would happen i said it it's morally
[1:17:22] wounded so it'll die
[1:17:24] and
[1:17:25] i asked
[1:17:27] many of my members of my church here
[1:17:30] in this tabernacle with brother neville
[1:17:32] and i has come approaching me with that
[1:17:34] same question
[1:17:37] brothers
[1:17:38] sisters
[1:17:40] haven't i tried to be a true servant of
[1:17:42] christ before you i'm not trying to be
[1:17:45] your brother
[1:17:48] wherever it is it's a spirit
[1:17:50] on precious people
[1:17:53] many people has asked me that but it's
[1:17:56] it's a spirit
[1:17:58] but i hope that today that it receives a
[1:18:01] deadly wound and will die out quickly so
[1:18:04] i can return back to the ministry
[1:18:07] until then
[1:18:09] i'll ask you each one
[1:18:11] pray for me
[1:18:12] i don't know what i'll do
[1:18:15] not place up for sale i just can't stand
[1:18:18] it i i stay around i'll go completely
[1:18:21] start mad and
[1:18:23] i ask you pray for me and remember if
[1:18:25] you've ever believed me
[1:18:28] if you've ever believed me to be a
[1:18:30] servant of christ remember that
[1:18:33] is an era
[1:18:36] it's falsely thus saith the lord
[1:18:40] it is wrong have nothing to do with it

[1:19:12] lord and to all
[1:19:14] and up there and that precious darling
[1:19:17] people may they see their air on what
[1:19:20] they have did lord to break the heart of
[1:19:22] their brother and to
[1:19:25] not only the brother but our savior
[1:19:29] our heavenly father
[1:19:31] i pray that you
[1:19:33] forgive us of our era's law
[1:19:36] let the holy blood of christ now draw
[1:19:40] our us beings together lord and blessed
[1:19:43] be the tithe that binds our hearts in
[1:19:45] christian love and fellowship

[1:19:51] brothers and our sisters
[1:19:53] may it receive the deadly wound that
[1:19:55] cannot
[1:19:56] exist any longer may it just die away
[1:20:00] lord

[1:20:03] to the field again
[1:20:05] but until then lord i am your
[1:20:07] heartbroken servant waiting

[1:20:13] tears and with crying and with
[1:20:14] persuading i tried lord hard you know my
[1:20:17] heart

[1:20:21] went beyond anything i could do so

[1:20:26] from this pulpit to where i preached for
[1:20:28] all these years i committed into your
[1:20:31] hand now you see to it father in your

[1:21:46] uh don't i i'm i'm 52 years old but i
[1:21:49] think maybe if god spares me i've got a
[1:21:51] little life left and i want to spend
[1:21:52] every ounce of my time for christ amen
[1:21:55] so
[1:21:56] remember i'm leaving because i'm driven
[1:21:59] to do it
[1:22:00] now

[1:22:03] fourth chapter where we left off the
[1:22:05] other day when we were in the study

[1:23:12] we talk the church ages the last seven
[1:23:15] church ages and then
[1:23:17] um now i believe some of them are trying
[1:23:20] to go write this up
[1:23:22] the church ages then we come into the
[1:23:25] fourth chapter
[1:23:27] of the book of the revelation of what is
[1:23:29] this the revelation of
[1:23:32] jesus christ the revelation
[1:23:35] called in the latin the apocalypse which
[1:23:38] means to be revealed taking the the
[1:23:41] cover off of to show to
[1:23:43] expose to bring out the
[1:23:47] revelation
[1:23:48] of jesus christ which was is and shall
[1:23:52] come the root and offspring of david
[1:23:54] now
[1:23:56] in the fourth chapter we find out that
[1:23:59] john was caught up into heaven actually
[1:24:01] seen the church ages just giving a
[1:24:04] little background now and then we'll
[1:24:06] maybe be best to read a few verses of
[1:24:08] the fifth chapter and then we'll start
[1:24:10] writing with the background
[1:24:12] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[1:24:14] set up on the throne a book written
[1:24:16] within and the backside seal was seven
[1:24:19] seals
[1:24:21] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:24:24] with a loud voice
[1:24:25] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:24:28] loose the seals thereof
[1:24:31] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[1:24:34] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:24:37] the book neither to
[1:24:40] look there on and of wept because no man
[1:24:45] was found worthy to open
[1:24:48] and read the book neither to look there
[1:24:50] on and one of the elders said unto me
[1:24:53] weep not
[1:24:55] behold
[1:24:56] the line of the tribe of
[1:24:59] the
[1:25:00] of judah the root of david has prevailed
[1:25:04] to open the book and to loose
[1:25:07] the seven seals thereof and i'll be held
[1:25:10] in low in the midst of the throne
[1:25:13] and the four beasts and in the midst of
[1:25:15] the elders stood a lamb and it had been
[1:25:17] slain
[1:25:19] having seven
[1:25:21] horns and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:25:24] spirits of god sent forth unto all the
[1:25:28] earth and he came and took the book out
[1:25:31] of the right hand of him that set up on
[1:25:33] the throne that's the first
[1:25:35] seven verses
[1:25:38] now now in the
[1:25:41] third
[1:25:43] chapter of revelations we find the
[1:25:45] ending up of the church age which ended
[1:25:48] with the lady austin the lukewarm church
[1:25:52] age
[1:25:53] then we find out that immediately after
[1:25:56] that john was caught up in the spirit
[1:25:59] up into the heavens
[1:26:01] and he saw
[1:26:03] things that was and was to come
[1:26:08] and things that had been
[1:26:10] now we find out the church doesn't
[1:26:12] appear anymore until the 19th chapter of
[1:26:16] revelations and she returns with her
[1:26:19] lord amen gloriously
[1:26:22] washed in the blood
[1:26:24] now
[1:26:26] in this last quotation for a little
[1:26:28] background to get set where john is now
[1:26:31] we found out that
[1:26:33] in the last message i was just briefly
[1:26:35] looking over it yesterday
[1:26:37] some of the context that i'd spoken on
[1:26:40] and john was carried up into heaven and
[1:26:43] saw those things
[1:26:45] and i noticed in there that he gave me a
[1:26:47] revelation that
[1:26:48] you know after his resurrection
[1:26:51] manny was with him and some said what
[1:26:54] will happen to this man that's leading
[1:26:55] up on your bosom john
[1:26:57] jesus turned and said what is it to thee
[1:27:00] if he carries till i come amen so he
[1:27:04] never then there when a doctrine out see
[1:27:06] how easy can start everyone are
[1:27:08] doctoring out that
[1:27:09] john wasn't going to die until he seen
[1:27:12] jesus coming
[1:27:13] until the second coming the bible said
[1:27:15] there's a doctrine went out of that
[1:27:17] hobby it jesus never said it that way
[1:27:20] he said what is it to you if he carries
[1:27:23] till i come
[1:27:24] now we find out that he was lifted up
[1:27:26] into the heavens and saw from then until
[1:27:31] the coming of the lord as though he had
[1:27:33] been there and seen it all happen john
[1:27:35] himself did not live he lived to be 90
[1:27:38] something years old and then died and
[1:27:41] a natural death the only one of the
[1:27:42] apostles after coming from his exile
[1:27:45] from our apartments
[1:27:47] now there's one outstanding point that i
[1:27:50] would i think they've taken my the
[1:27:52] blackboard down but i would like to
[1:27:55] emphasize on a little before we strike
[1:27:57] this vital thing oh this is glorious
[1:28:01] a wonderful wonderful chapter
[1:28:04] and then the very next chapter begins
[1:28:07] with opening up these seals
[1:28:10] oh my then we have to skip from there
[1:28:12] and go different places in the bible to
[1:28:14] get these seals when they open and what
[1:28:16] the mysteries of them are oh they are
[1:28:18] glorious just
[1:28:20] rich with spiritual vitamin
[1:28:23] now
[1:28:25] we see that one of the great outstanding
[1:28:27] things i'd like to bring your attention
[1:28:29] to
[1:28:29] was the living creatures of the last
[1:28:32] part of the fourth chapter
[1:28:34] that john saw
[1:28:36] watching that art of the covenant
[1:28:40] remember how they were fixed just like
[1:28:42] israel in its march
[1:28:44] they had uh
[1:28:45] uh oh there was a face of the living
[1:28:48] creature and we found out that these
[1:28:50] preachers were not angels
[1:28:53] neither were they man
[1:28:57] they were turbans
[1:28:59] and we found them in the old testament
[1:29:01] with the ark
[1:29:02] we find them in the new testament
[1:29:05] and then we find them over in the coming
[1:29:08] of the lord again
[1:29:10] cherubians
[1:29:12] guarding
[1:29:13] the mercy seat
[1:29:15] the mercy seat which no one could
[1:29:18] approach
[1:29:19] unless there was an atonement there for
[1:29:21] that person amen only way that the
[1:29:24] sanctuary when it was sprinkled of the
[1:29:27] blood then it became a mercy seat but
[1:29:30] after the blood was taken off and it
[1:29:32] became a judgment seat
[1:29:34] and oh my no one could stand the
[1:29:37] judgments of god
[1:29:38] the only thing that we can look for is
[1:29:41] mercy
[1:29:43] not judgment not righteous
[1:29:46] righteousness we cannot approach is a
[1:29:48] justice
[1:29:49] because as justice you'll have to keep
[1:29:52] his word
[1:29:53] and keeping his word the day either of
[1:29:56] that day you die
[1:29:59] who would want justice i don't want
[1:30:01] justice i
[1:30:03] call for
[1:30:04] mercy my that's the mercy of god and the
[1:30:08] mercy seat sprinkled
[1:30:10] but there was a time of the cleansing of
[1:30:13] the sanctuary when it was a judgment
[1:30:16] seat as long as the blood was off of the
[1:30:18] seat
[1:30:19] now we're approaching that time now
[1:30:23] we are now approaching in this age
[1:30:26] a cleansing of the sanctuary
[1:30:30] and the judgments
[1:30:32] coming up on the earth
[1:30:34] see as long as blood is there god cannot
[1:30:37] destroy the earth long as blood is there
[1:30:40] nobody is a sinner before god
[1:30:42] everybody's right because there's an
[1:30:44] atonement for everybody but if you fail
[1:30:46] to accept that atonement and go into his
[1:30:48] presence then you are a sinner you're
[1:30:50] beyond that mercy
[1:30:53] then you've judged yourself
[1:30:55] but now while there is mercy but when
[1:30:58] the cleansing of the sanctuary comes the
[1:31:01] blood goes off the mercy seat and then
[1:31:04] the wrath of god falls upon the earth oh
[1:31:07] my god be merciful to us that we be not
[1:31:11] in that day found without mercies of god
[1:31:15] now we see in there i'll try to
[1:31:18] uh kind of spiritualize it here draw it
[1:31:21] for you by my hands
[1:31:23] that there were four corners how israel
[1:31:27] uh camped themselves they put the the
[1:31:29] ark in the center
[1:31:31] and on the four sides of the tent
[1:31:34] was three tribes of israel and three
[1:31:36] fours is twelve or four threes rather
[1:31:39] twelve
[1:31:40] and each
[1:31:41] three had a head and each head of the
[1:31:45] tribe one of them was
[1:31:47] reuben he always camped to the
[1:31:50] the south
[1:31:52] he was the head of man
[1:31:54] and
[1:31:55] ephraim was to the west with three
[1:31:57] tribes
[1:31:58] he was uh the ox the
[1:32:02] then on the east was judah
[1:32:04] which is the line
[1:32:06] and on the north was dan which was the
[1:32:10] eagle
[1:32:11] now notice you remember all of you
[1:32:13] remember well how he had him brought out
[1:32:15] the eagle and the ox
[1:32:18] and the
[1:32:19] the man and the lion now you notice
[1:32:22] judah guards the eastern gate
[1:32:26] and christ is the line of the tribe of
[1:32:30] judah
[1:32:32] he shall descend from the eastern sky
[1:32:35] enter in by the way of the gate
[1:32:38] he comes from the eastern gate from the
[1:32:41] tribe of
[1:32:43] judah
[1:32:44] and he's the lion of the tribe of judea
[1:32:46] and we find out over in our coming
[1:32:48] message this morning that he still is
[1:32:51] proclaimed the line of the tribe of
[1:32:55] judah the root the very beginning of
[1:32:58] david david was the king eternally and
[1:33:01] christ sets on the throne of david in
[1:33:04] the millennium which is eternal king
[1:33:07] there will never be one faith
[1:33:11] hallelujah
[1:33:13] never be one failed david god promised
[1:33:16] that
[1:33:17] said none would ever fail david that one
[1:33:20] he said what about today where's those
[1:33:22] jewish judges he still has the seed
[1:33:25] christ is his son
[1:33:28] according to the flesh there once said
[1:33:30] sir david shall not fail
[1:33:33] that's right
[1:33:34] and christ is that line of the tribe of
[1:33:38] judah from which david sprang from
[1:33:42] now
[1:33:44] we find out that they were the guards to
[1:33:47] the mercy seat they watched the mercy
[1:33:49] seat nothing come to it it crossed over
[1:33:53] the tribes first before to get to the
[1:33:55] mercy seat every man willing to give his
[1:33:58] life
[1:33:59] every israelite camp would die before
[1:34:02] anything that enter into that camp over
[1:34:04] there and take that mercy seat
[1:34:06] and now we find out that was the old
[1:34:08] testament order and in the new testament
[1:34:11] order we find the same thing
[1:34:14] that it was guarded the mercy seat
[1:34:17] oh i hope you get it
[1:34:20] the mercy seat is still guarded
[1:34:24] still got the guards
[1:34:26] we found out that those guards were
[1:34:28] matthew mark luke and john guarding the
[1:34:33] book of acts
[1:34:34] uh acts of the holy spirit done amongst
[1:34:38] the apostles which is the the book of
[1:34:40] acts of the
[1:34:41] new of the new testament and
[1:34:44] the four writers of the
[1:34:47] gospels matthew mark luke and john all
[1:34:51] guard that mercy seat to show that it is
[1:34:54] god
[1:34:55] the holy spirit today each scripture
[1:34:59] matthew mark luke and john everyone will
[1:35:01] back up the true gospel of the lord
[1:35:03] jesus christ and the acts of the holy
[1:35:05] spirit now when we get beyond that then
[1:35:08] that's not it but it backs up the true
[1:35:10] message
[1:35:11] like we find out then
[1:35:14] uh acts 2 38 will repent and be baptized
[1:35:17] in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:35:20] remission of your sins in the day they
[1:35:21] adopted the name of father son and holy
[1:35:24] ghost to be baptized in there's no
[1:35:26] scripture for that there's no background
[1:35:29] there's no there's nothing to guard that
[1:35:31] not a thing
[1:35:33] you say matthew said it matthew guarded
[1:35:35] it matthew 28 1 18 says the birth of
[1:35:38] jesus christ is on this wise when his
[1:35:41] mother mary was exposed to joseph before
[1:35:43] they came together she was bound with a
[1:35:45] child are the holy ghost amen
[1:35:48] this is all done while
[1:35:50] joseph her husband rather being a just
[1:35:52] man not willingly to make her public
[1:35:54] example was minded that the putter away
[1:35:56] privately on this one but while he
[1:35:59] thought on these things behold the angel
[1:36:01] lord appeared to him in a dream saying
[1:36:03] joseph thou son of david fear not to
[1:36:06] take unto thee mary thou life for that
[1:36:08] which is conceived in her is all the
[1:36:10] holy ghost
[1:36:12] and the holy ghost and god the father is
[1:36:14] the same person already had two fathers
[1:36:17] so you see and she shall bring forth a
[1:36:19] child call his name jesus and this is
[1:36:22] done that might be fulfilled spoken a
[1:36:23] prophet
[1:36:25] god would be with us called emmanuel
[1:36:27] which is god father son and holy ghost
[1:36:30] in one name jesus christ
[1:36:31] [Music]
[1:36:33] against era
[1:36:36] a few days ago in chicago before a
[1:36:38] ministerial association of chicago
[1:36:40] greater chicago
[1:36:42] i knew the holy spirit got me up the
[1:36:44] night and told me stand by the window
[1:36:46] said there is a group of ministers in
[1:36:48] there fixing the breakfast for you said
[1:36:50] be careful they're going to attack you
[1:36:52] up on this i said thank you lord you
[1:36:54] showed me where it would be set and i
[1:36:56] went and told some ministers
[1:36:58] brother carlson brother tommy hicks how
[1:37:00] it would be i said the place that you've
[1:37:02] ordered it won't be like that we're
[1:37:03] going to be in another place told how
[1:37:05] dark for me to be set and how colored
[1:37:07] man would come in set this weight all
[1:37:08] about it
[1:37:09] then that morning they said my son said
[1:37:12] to me he said daddy are you going over
[1:37:13] there next plus i said i'm going to
[1:37:14] refuse i'm going over anointed with the
[1:37:17] holy
[1:37:18] spirit with a word of god that will
[1:37:20] guard that mercy seat
[1:37:22] as long as he's there
[1:37:24] so when we got down there before they
[1:37:26] even had a chance to ask one thing the
[1:37:28] holy spirit spoke to him he said now is
[1:37:30] the time to say it i said i know why
[1:37:31] you're here
[1:37:33] now i said now brother hicks and you
[1:37:34] brother carlson the head of the
[1:37:36] christian businessman i said isn't
[1:37:38] everything just exactly where the holy
[1:37:40] spirit told me day before yesterday that
[1:37:42] you did not get that room with me over
[1:37:43] here
[1:37:45] and this got it that morning
[1:37:47] god said now look at everybody's place
[1:37:48] just the way it said it would be
[1:37:50] i said the thing you want to approach me
[1:37:52] on is on the name of jesus christ for
[1:37:54] baptism
[1:37:55] and when we the holy spirit begin to
[1:37:58] take the word of god and reveal it
[1:38:01] didn't interpret it down like that when
[1:38:03] all those bunch of trinitarian ministers
[1:38:05] sat there reaching on the table shaking
[1:38:08] hands with one another tears running
[1:38:09] down their cheeks and i understand that
[1:38:11] 72 of them is coming down here to this
[1:38:13] tabernacle for me to baptize them in the
[1:38:15] name of jesus christ
[1:38:18] the mercy seat is guarded
[1:38:21] see the holy spirit guard and the mercy
[1:38:24] seat
[1:38:25] we must keep it just exactly let that
[1:38:28] word of god then great messenger sitting
[1:38:31] there matthew mark looking john that
[1:38:33] backs up every act out that
[1:38:35] new testament
[1:38:38] and now not
[1:38:39] that's exactly what i said in the first
[1:38:41] part of this morning's message let's
[1:38:43] keep it right there guarded by the
[1:38:46] gospel amen
[1:38:47] keep it right there where the gospels
[1:38:49] will guard it
[1:38:51] now
[1:38:52] we find out in there they were guarding
[1:38:55] god's mercy seat in the old testament
[1:38:58] and there matthew mark luke john all of
[1:39:01] them and even the line of the tribe of
[1:39:04] judah laid down his life
[1:39:09] to guard that mercy seat let it be
[1:39:11] sprinkled with his own blood and there
[1:39:13] he stands this morning today the great
[1:39:16] conqueror who shall descend from the
[1:39:18] east someday and we shall see him now we
[1:39:21] turn quickly because i know there's a
[1:39:23] baptismal service
[1:39:25] what is this seven sealed book
[1:39:29] oh
[1:39:30] what a great thing did you notice how it
[1:39:32] says here it was seven seals on the back
[1:39:37] of the book
[1:39:38] it's something oh may god help us now
[1:39:42] and give us courage and maybe sooner or
[1:39:44] later i can get it to you look
[1:39:47] this is not written in the word
[1:39:51] it's sealed on the back of the word the
[1:39:54] book was sealed by these seven seals
[1:39:57] the whole mystery of the book is sealed
[1:39:59] up in these seven seals
[1:40:02] this is one of the most greatest
[1:40:04] chapters in the whole book of the
[1:40:06] revelation look and i saw in the right
[1:40:09] hand of him that set up on a throne a
[1:40:11] book
[1:40:12] written within and
[1:40:14] written within inside's written that's
[1:40:16] what we're reading this morning and the
[1:40:18] backside sealed with seven seals
[1:40:22] outside the bible what the bible doesn't
[1:40:24] even say it's sealed in here with seven
[1:40:26] seals
[1:40:28] the mysteries of
[1:40:30] god
[1:40:31] now
[1:40:33] what is it
[1:40:35] now notice
[1:40:38] a seal represents a finished product
[1:40:43] something that has been already tested
[1:40:46] proven and then sealed
[1:40:50] where is we have the earnest of our
[1:40:53] salvation now
[1:40:54] by being
[1:40:56] sealed with the holy spirit
[1:41:00] that is the earnest of our salvation
[1:41:03] let's go back just a minute i've got a
[1:41:05] scripture written down here several of
[1:41:07] them i don't have time to get to all but
[1:41:09] let's go back to ephesians just a moment
[1:41:12] and read the in the first chapter of
[1:41:14] ephesians so that you might
[1:41:17] get the real meaning
[1:41:20] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[1:41:22] will of god
[1:41:24] to the saints which are at ephesus and
[1:41:27] remember john had this letter addressed
[1:41:30] to the ephesians
[1:41:32] the ephesus and the faithfully christ
[1:41:35] the ones that paul had preached to and
[1:41:38] brought up
[1:41:39] nurtured with the gospel
[1:41:42] the ephesus and to the faithful in
[1:41:45] christ that's those who are already in
[1:41:48] christ how do we get in christ by one
[1:41:51] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:41:54] which is the body of christ
[1:41:56] grace be unto you and peace from god our
[1:41:58] father in the lord jesus christ
[1:42:01] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:42:02] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[1:42:04] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:42:07] places in
[1:42:08] christ jesus
[1:42:11] think of it now
[1:42:13] he has blessed us with all
[1:42:15] heavenly grace
[1:42:18] blessings
[1:42:19] as we assemble together in christ jesus
[1:42:24] as the believers the elected church
[1:42:26] called out set aside
[1:42:29] he sealed us in by his holy spirit and
[1:42:32] now
[1:42:33] is revealing to us
[1:42:37] all the things
[1:42:39] that is in the future for us now we're
[1:42:42] up to the seven seals
[1:42:45] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:42:48] before the foundation of the world that
[1:42:51] we should be holy and without blame and
[1:42:53] love having predestinated us into the
[1:42:55] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[1:42:58] himself according to his own good
[1:43:00] pleasure
[1:43:01] what a beautiful
[1:43:04] thought this is let's just read on just
[1:43:05] a minute i want to get down here
[1:43:06] especially to the 12th first and 13th
[1:43:08] 14th that we should be
[1:43:12] to the praise of his glory
[1:43:15] who first trusted in him in
[1:43:18] whom
[1:43:20] he also trusted after that you heard the
[1:43:23] word of truth
[1:43:25] and the gospel of your salvation whom
[1:43:29] after ye believed you were
[1:43:31] sealed
[1:43:33] with the holy spirit of promise
[1:43:37] after ye believe
[1:43:40] oh my baptist brother how could you say
[1:43:44] that isn't so
[1:43:45] you say you receive the holy ghost when
[1:43:47] you believe
[1:43:49] it's that after you believe then you
[1:43:51] were sealed with the holy spirit of
[1:43:54] promise
[1:43:55] notice
[1:43:58] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:44:01] until the redemption of the purchase
[1:44:04] procession onto the praise of his glory
[1:44:08] now
[1:44:09] we find out then that
[1:44:12] a seal means that it is a
[1:44:15] finished
[1:44:16] thing with god it's already
[1:44:18] settled and every believer
[1:44:22] was sealed with
[1:44:25] this promise from the very beginning
[1:44:27] because
[1:44:28] before the foundation of the world we
[1:44:31] were predestined unto the adoption of
[1:44:35] sons
[1:44:37] before the world ever begin
[1:44:39] oh wow i hope that makes us rest
[1:44:42] steadfast and sure i anchor to the soul
[1:44:46] not tossed about here and there but
[1:44:49] anchored in christ
[1:44:51] a hope that sure
[1:44:53] predestinated us before the foundation
[1:44:56] of the world to the adoptions of
[1:44:59] sunlight jesus christ
[1:45:05] i love that
[1:45:06] finished work with god now let me just
[1:45:09] quote another scripture to you
[1:45:10] all that he foreknew he has called
[1:45:15] all that he called he justified
[1:45:18] all that he had justified he hath
[1:45:21] glorified
[1:45:23] all the way from the beginning god in
[1:45:25] his great
[1:45:27] infinite mind foresaw his church
[1:45:30] and predestinated it unto the adoption
[1:45:33] of children to jesus christ
[1:45:37] [Music]
[1:45:38] what a beautiful praise
[1:45:41] brother neville that just makes me feel
[1:45:42] lots better
[1:45:44] adoption
[1:45:46] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:45:49] now
[1:45:50] notice as we go on
[1:45:52] uh
[1:45:55] now we know it's a finish we are
[1:45:57] predestinated with the lamb the holy
[1:45:59] spirit is our seal the earnest means
[1:46:02] more is yet to come
[1:46:06] we only have the earnest of it now
[1:46:09] the earnest is just the down payment
[1:46:13] oh
[1:46:13] how beautiful just the down payment that
[1:46:18] holds it in secures it and anchors it so
[1:46:20] no one else can touch it
[1:46:23] it's the earnest of our adoption
[1:46:27] amen
[1:46:28] the holy spirit is now the earnest of
[1:46:31] god in our hearts
[1:46:32] seal
[1:46:33] the adoption of sons awaiting us at the
[1:46:36] end of the road
[1:46:38] sons and daughters of god let's turn to
[1:46:40] another scripture right quick i got
[1:46:41] written down on this other picture
[1:46:42] romans 8 22 i think it's beautiful
[1:46:45] now
[1:46:47] in studying yesterday i kind of wrote
[1:46:49] out a few scriptures here that i'd like
[1:46:51] to refer to
[1:46:52] we know
[1:46:54] that
[1:46:55] we know that the whole
[1:46:58] creation
[1:47:00] growth
[1:47:01] and surveillance in teens together until
[1:47:05] now
[1:47:07] and not only they but
[1:47:10] ourselves also
[1:47:12] which have the first fruits of the
[1:47:15] spirit even
[1:47:16] we ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:47:20] waiting
[1:47:21] for the adoption to with the redemption
[1:47:25] of our bodies
[1:47:28] oh do you see it
[1:47:30] all
[1:47:31] creation is groaning said paul
[1:47:35] everything
[1:47:36] is groaning
[1:47:38] look at the trees how they struggle
[1:47:41] look at the flowers how they struggle
[1:47:43] for life just for the frost to tear them
[1:47:46] down
[1:47:47] look at the trees how they struggle to
[1:47:49] hold their branches out to say glories
[1:47:52] of the god
[1:47:53] see everything all nature
[1:47:56] all animals all birds
[1:47:58] how he flies from the enemy quickly and
[1:48:00] gets away everything groaning and we
[1:48:03] ourselves said paul we've grown too with
[1:48:07] them
[1:48:08] or we're waiting for the redemption of
[1:48:11] our body but now
[1:48:14] amen now they did all those years until
[1:48:17] now now we have the earnest of our
[1:48:21] inheritance
[1:48:26] what do we have we have the evidence
[1:48:30] that god lives
[1:48:31] we have the evidence that god is with us
[1:48:35] we have the evidence that god is not
[1:48:38] forsaking us
[1:48:39] that we are his and he is ours because
[1:48:42] we
[1:48:43] in our bodies we now tabernacle the holy
[1:48:47] spirit of god it cries out as our father
[1:48:50] and there's nothing can ever take that
[1:48:52] away
[1:48:53] we are anchored in christ
[1:48:56] now the trees does not have it nature
[1:48:59] doesn't have it but yet we are still
[1:49:01] groaning with them because as yet we
[1:49:04] haven't received the fullness of our
[1:49:06] adoption
[1:49:07] but we have the earnest of it
[1:49:10] amen that we were picked up from the
[1:49:12] things of the world and now become sons
[1:49:15] and daughters of god
[1:49:17] what kind of people should we be
[1:49:19] oh
[1:49:20] my when we think of that
[1:49:23] now we have the earnest
[1:49:25] our spirits groaning for the full
[1:49:27] adoption
[1:49:28] but now we have the earnest of it as we
[1:49:30] receive the holy spirit it is the
[1:49:34] earnest of our complete adoption our
[1:49:36] complete salvation
[1:49:38] oh how beautiful
[1:49:40] i just love that all right
[1:49:43] we are waiting for the foolish of
[1:49:45] adoption this will take place when at
[1:49:48] the first resurrection hallelujah that's
[1:49:52] when our bodies will be
[1:49:54] changed from these vile creatures that
[1:49:56] we are and we'll have a body like his
[1:49:58] own glorious body
[1:50:00] for we shall see him as he is and we
[1:50:04] will be like him
[1:50:06] when he appears we appear in his
[1:50:08] likeness
[1:50:09] we will have a body like his a glorious
[1:50:12] glorified body and all the trials and
[1:50:15] struggles of life will fade off into a
[1:50:17] little myth and blow aways and never be
[1:50:19] no more and these earthly tabernacles
[1:50:22] which we now have grown in we are
[1:50:23] waiting for that earnest
[1:50:26] that earnest uh for this salvation fully
[1:50:29] in its fullest to come but now in these
[1:50:31] tabernacles of clay we have
[1:50:34] something that tells us that we have
[1:50:36] raised
[1:50:41] [Music]
[1:50:47] now
[1:50:48] watch when we love the things of the
[1:50:49] world once when we sinned and went about
[1:50:52] doing things to the world and cared not
[1:50:53] for god we were alienated from him
[1:50:55] without god without christ in the world
[1:50:57] now god sent his holy spirit and through
[1:51:00] that we are lifted up from those things
[1:51:06] we have the earnest that we know that we
[1:51:08] pass some death under life
[1:51:10] amen
[1:51:13] here
[1:51:13] as i was trying to show this like this
[1:51:16] here's where the ordinary center runs
[1:51:18] down here on the bottom
[1:51:20] now
[1:51:22] the christian goes up a little higher
[1:51:24] than this he rides above all that stuff
[1:51:27] that's the earliest of his salvation
[1:51:29] now that you might know when what
[1:51:31] visions do to you so help me god being
[1:51:34] my judge i never intend to have another
[1:51:36] one if it does i'll keep it to myself
[1:51:37] see because i see what it does the
[1:51:39] people are not ready for such a ministry
[1:51:41] so you just have to let it go you see go
[1:51:43] on back here if i ever come to feel
[1:51:45] again i'll be in advances but look here
[1:51:47] on this year coming back in here up in
[1:51:50] here you go up into this heavenlies up
[1:51:52] in here you live right up around in
[1:51:53] those rims there you go beyond anything
[1:51:56] that man can think of beyond anything
[1:51:59] and it brings you up into them spaces
[1:52:01] there but you see now we have by the
[1:52:04] holy spirit the earnest of our
[1:52:07] inheritance
[1:52:08] because we've been lifted up from the
[1:52:10] things of the world and we ride right
[1:52:12] along with the world but we are above
[1:52:14] the world
[1:52:19] god be merciful
[1:52:21] and grant to the church of the living
[1:52:23] god when we ever get to a place to think
[1:52:26] that the church a beautiful church
[1:52:28] that we're trying to compare with the
[1:52:30] things of the world we're trying to have
[1:52:32] a better basketball team than they got
[1:52:35] we got to have a better feeling we've
[1:52:37] got to have a better bunko game we've
[1:52:39] got to have better this and better that
[1:52:42] what can we ever compare with the
[1:52:45] glamour and the glisten of the world
[1:52:48] we are not the gospel isn't a glisten
[1:52:50] it's a glow
[1:52:53] there's a difference between a glitter
[1:52:54] and a glow
[1:52:56] see we just go around as i've said
[1:52:58] taking one uh one corpse from one more
[1:53:01] to another changing members and things
[1:53:03] like that well what good does it do us
[1:53:06] and we're trying to make it glittery big
[1:53:08] times people's great big fine places we
[1:53:10] got to have a better than the methodists
[1:53:12] are better than the baptists and we're
[1:53:14] all trying to compete with the catholic
[1:53:15] and we're having bunk hole games and
[1:53:17] parties and suppers and entertainments
[1:53:20] and everything the church can never
[1:53:22] compare with the world how can your
[1:53:24] church entertainment ever compared with
[1:53:25] the masonic lodge or any of those people
[1:53:28] who can entertain
[1:53:29] that's their grounds don't try to go
[1:53:31] over on their grounds but we've got
[1:53:33] something to happen
[1:53:35] we've got jesus
[1:53:42] we have jesus they okay can't have jesus
[1:53:45] watch how they come over here
[1:53:47] and when we get over there we're all for
[1:53:48] his ground
[1:53:50] don't try to glitter go and you can't go
[1:53:53] you got to let it go through you
[1:53:56] the little glowworm he doesn't go
[1:53:58] because he wants to go because he does
[1:54:00] glow it's something that he's blowing
[1:54:02] it's in itself it's himself dude
[1:54:05] something inside of him is glowing
[1:54:07] through
[1:54:08] well that's the way it is with the holy
[1:54:10] spirit we don't have to be peculiar be
[1:54:12] different be anything more just let
[1:54:14] loose and live a godly life and he said
[1:54:16] god
[1:54:18] that'll go for the gospel
[1:54:21] not glitter glitter that makes monkeys
[1:54:24] jump at things like that any glitters
[1:54:26] you know they're always jumping for
[1:54:27] something shiny but glow is a soft
[1:54:30] mellow sweetness of the of the holy
[1:54:32] spirit
[1:54:33] now
[1:54:34] we are waiting for that resurrection but
[1:54:37] now do you understand say amen if you do
[1:54:39] what i mean by saying the earnest we've
[1:54:42] been we know we have passed some death
[1:54:44] in the life because we're lifted up
[1:54:46] we are lifted up not in ourselves but
[1:54:48] lifted up from the things of the world
[1:54:50] that we love everybody and god loves us
[1:54:53] and we know it and we watch our lives
[1:54:55] and see that it is the holy spirit
[1:54:57] because we don't more care for the
[1:54:58] things of the world amen there you are
[1:55:02] as long as you love the world and things
[1:55:03] of the world than the love of god not in
[1:55:05] you
[1:55:06] but as long as you're above that then
[1:55:08] you know you have your inheritance
[1:55:11] you're on your road to your full
[1:55:13] redemption
[1:55:14] and now that will not come you see until
[1:55:16] we have first first we must see jesus
[1:55:20] and when he comes then we'll have a body
[1:55:22] like his body and will be made like him
[1:55:25] all right
[1:55:27] now we see something
[1:55:29] that was lost here because the bible
[1:55:31] said so and in the book here that
[1:55:34] that has redeemed us
[1:55:37] what are we redeemed from something we
[1:55:39] must have lost
[1:55:41] before you can be redeemed there must be
[1:55:43] something that redeemed us back and all
[1:55:45] the inheritance that we had has been has
[1:55:48] been redeemed back then we must have had
[1:55:50] something one time that we do not have
[1:55:52] now that this lamb come to redeem amen
[1:55:56] see
[1:55:57] we had something was lost from
[1:56:00] now notice
[1:56:02] what did we lose
[1:56:04] well it was given to adam to have
[1:56:06] eternal life
[1:56:07] as long as he eat from the tree
[1:56:09] he had eternal life
[1:56:11] and we uh notice again that adam was the
[1:56:14] uh he inherit the earth he was a like a
[1:56:18] an amateur god over the earth the earth
[1:56:20] was his everything was given into his
[1:56:22] hand he could do with whatever he wanted
[1:56:24] to he named it and called it and done
[1:56:26] whatever he wanted to he was truly a son
[1:56:29] of god
[1:56:30] now in the fall
[1:56:32] adam
[1:56:33] farfart the title deed to that amen
[1:56:37] he forfeited it to satan
[1:56:40] satan took the title deed
[1:56:43] adam
[1:56:44] was very soulful and he did not redeem
[1:56:47] his rights for he could not redeem his
[1:56:49] rights
[1:56:50] but satan which does not rightfully own
[1:56:53] it but he possesses that he is the god
[1:56:57] of this earth
[1:56:59] amen
[1:57:00] he possesses that not because he that he
[1:57:04] he really rightfully gets it but he
[1:57:07] possesses it
[1:57:08] now do you get it amen satan possesses
[1:57:11] that he holds it into his hand
[1:57:13] death is in his hands the earth is in
[1:57:16] his hand the world belongs to you every
[1:57:18] nation belongs to you he governs and
[1:57:20] controls the whole world and everything
[1:57:22] in the world amen satan does
[1:57:24] but thank god we're not all the world
[1:57:27] you are see
[1:57:29] i don't mean the church you don't
[1:57:30] control the church he just controls the
[1:57:32] world
[1:57:33] he said there were his and he's the god
[1:57:35] of the world jesus said he was and he is
[1:57:38] he's the god of this earth that's blind
[1:57:39] the eyes of the people the god of this
[1:57:42] earth he's the god of heaven and now he
[1:57:44] rightly don't own this he does not own
[1:57:47] it but he's forfeit
[1:57:49] and adam forfeit the title deed to it to
[1:57:53] this all this stuff that we own eternal
[1:57:55] life and the inheriting of the earth
[1:57:58] jesus said in matthew 5 blessed are the
[1:58:01] meeks for they shall inherit
[1:58:03] yeah see now we don't have it now and
[1:58:08] look it wasn't that adam or any of his
[1:58:10] seeds
[1:58:12] adam's seed absolutely lost everything
[1:58:14] too it's not the seed of adam
[1:58:17] no matter how much we try to beautify as
[1:58:19] the world and how much we try to make
[1:58:20] big fine homes and things that still
[1:58:22] doesn't belong to adam's seed
[1:58:25] no sir amen it did not go to adam seed
[1:58:28] no sir because satan tucket lock stock
[1:58:31] and barrel
[1:58:35] [Music]
[1:58:38] yes
[1:58:39] so many things could be said i just
[1:58:41] don't want to take too much of time now
[1:58:42] so we have to baptize
[1:58:44] all right
[1:58:45] he possesses it but he does not
[1:58:47] rightfully own it satan does
[1:58:49] when the rifle owner rifle owner owner
[1:58:52] lost it there's only one way that it can
[1:58:54] be redeemed
[1:58:56] now
[1:58:57] that's by our near kinsman
[1:59:00] is the only one who can rightly redeem
[1:59:02] it now of course this week i have in the
[1:59:05] virgin birth of jesus christ now i want
[1:59:07] to say something here the first thing
[1:59:10] that we want to go back to
[1:59:11] is if we go back in the in the old
[1:59:13] testament you know i believe i got it
[1:59:14] wrote down here somewhere in leviticus
[1:59:16] 25 little bit because 25 23 and 24 you
[1:59:19] can get the laws of redemption you who
[1:59:20] are putting down
[1:59:22] to redeem anything
[1:59:24] while a man when god gave israel it's
[1:59:26] divided this land up to
[1:59:28] joshua
[1:59:30] each tribe and each fellow was given a
[1:59:32] land well his children inherited what
[1:59:35] his possession
[1:59:36] now if this man got poor and lost
[1:59:39] anything to another man
[1:59:41] this uh only way to be redeemed would be
[1:59:44] by a near kinsman but it finally must
[1:59:47] come back this man only holds it for a
[1:59:49] certain amount of time it must come back
[1:59:51] to the original owner
[1:59:54] right
[1:59:55] you must go back to the original owner
[1:59:57] if it was out of the tribe of judah if
[1:59:59] it was if he was there and this was
[2:00:00] allotted to his father then it was to
[2:00:02] him or some near kinsmen could take it
[2:00:06] but now nobody else could right they
[2:00:09] could hold it they could hold the deed
[2:00:10] on it they could hold the deed until the
[2:00:13] debt was paid but when the right wind
[2:00:15] come along the person that say for
[2:00:18] instance if i owned a piece of property
[2:00:20] and i lost it
[2:00:22] and i sold it over to brother neville
[2:00:24] which is of another tribe of judah or
[2:00:27] maybe sold it to an alien and he
[2:00:29] rightfully owned and he only he could
[2:00:30] come in there and farm it and take the
[2:00:32] goods off of it and so forth but really
[2:00:34] he just held the deed he could not own
[2:00:36] it that was a law in israel
[2:00:39] now you really re read the benefits 25
[2:00:42] and you'll see that they could not
[2:00:44] rightfully open it he just held it well
[2:00:46] now for instance my son wanted billy
[2:00:48] back there wanted to take my
[2:00:51] come by this ground well then if uh the
[2:00:54] alien or brother neville or some other
[2:00:56] person owned it was holding a deed to it
[2:00:59] now if this was my next kinsman
[2:01:02] was my blood relation he could not hold
[2:01:04] it any longer amen
[2:01:06] no sir he had to give it over
[2:01:09] yes sir when that price was paid yeah
[2:01:12] when he gave him say twenty five
[2:01:14] thousand dollars for the pizza property
[2:01:16] one and say uh brother tony would come
[2:01:18] over and say uh brother neville i buy
[2:01:20] brother bran's property he couldn't do
[2:01:21] it
[2:01:22] brother would say no sir i don't want to
[2:01:24] sell it
[2:01:25] what'd you get for 25 000. well i'll
[2:01:28] give you 35 000 i'll give you someone so
[2:01:30] i don't care what you want i don't want
[2:01:32] to sell it i'll keep it but billy paul
[2:01:33] could come along and say i want my
[2:01:35] daddy's possession here's your 25 000.
[2:01:38] he had to let it go am i trying because
[2:01:41] that was the law
[2:01:42] oh
[2:01:43] hallelujah
[2:01:44] praise god
[2:01:47] i hope you christian says we
[2:01:50] are the salt of the earth
[2:01:52] [Music]
[2:01:54] god gave this to his sons
[2:01:57] he gave us the jewish teachings over all
[2:01:59] nature
[2:02:00] all animals all life everywhere
[2:02:03] but adam our father
[2:02:07] decision
[2:02:08] [Applause]
[2:02:09] but where does it fall to the right
[2:02:11] corner god who made it
[2:02:15] no wonder john said he wept bitterly
[2:02:19] before he could find no man who was
[2:02:20] worthy to redeem it
[2:02:22] the man must be worthy john said i wept
[2:02:25] bitterly when no one was able to take
[2:02:27] the book or to look on it or loose the
[2:02:29] seals out he said well no man in heaven
[2:02:31] no man on earth no man beneath the earth
[2:02:33] no man everywhere
[2:02:35] no man now he never disregarded angels
[2:02:38] remember this earth wasn't given to
[2:02:40] angels
[2:02:41] it's the inheritance of man
[2:02:46] sure somebody else is worthy michael
[2:02:49] might have been not as he might have
[2:02:50] been worthy to do it but there was no
[2:02:52] man worthy amen
[2:02:55] see
[2:02:56] and john went
[2:02:58] amen
[2:03:00] someone said because he found himself
[2:03:02] not worthy that isn't so the man's under
[2:03:04] the influence of the holy ghost he
[2:03:05] couldn't make an arrow like that but he
[2:03:07] he was
[2:03:08] he was he was he wasn't him not only
[2:03:10] worthy he could find nobody worthy
[2:03:13] so just saying he says
[2:03:15] a elder came for their strong angel
[2:03:19] said we not
[2:03:21] amen far away in the tribe of judah
[2:03:24] there is over
[2:03:27] [Applause]
[2:03:29] [Music]
[2:03:38] remember he hadn't seen him up to this
[2:03:40] time
[2:03:41] why he was set it on a seat on a throne
[2:03:43] in their god's throne he was on the
[2:03:45] inside the sanctuary he hadn't seen him
[2:03:46] at this time so john was expecting to
[2:03:48] see a lion come forth but he saw him
[2:03:53] lord there you are
[2:04:05] [Music]
[2:04:08] still be a servant of christ
[2:04:10] that's a conqueror
[2:04:13] now i said he has prevailed
[2:04:15] and he's worthy to take the book and
[2:04:18] open it into lucille's arab now we're
[2:04:20] going to find out why maybe not today
[2:04:23] but what these seven seals hold what
[2:04:25] they did now let's take a little bit on
[2:04:27] redemption before
[2:04:30] before this person could be
[2:04:32] uh could redeem the first thing he had
[2:04:35] to be worthy
[2:04:36] he had to be the right kind of person
[2:04:39] so this was accomplished when jesus
[2:04:41] christ was born a virgin birth
[2:04:44] for he was god
[2:04:46] he was god himself made a man
[2:04:49] he was god in human flesh he had to be
[2:04:52] worthy and the virgin blood of jesus
[2:04:55] christ made him worthy
[2:04:57] now we find out if you want to go to the
[2:04:59] scripture of it the first peter 1
[2:05:02] 18 to 20 if you're keeping the
[2:05:04] scriptures down he had to be worthy and
[2:05:06] he was because he took upon him the form
[2:05:08] of man
[2:05:10] he became man god became kin folks to us
[2:05:13] and there we find then the beautiful
[2:05:15] part of god jehovah made flesh and lord
[2:05:18] among us as the worthy one amen
[2:05:22] he prevailed
[2:05:24] god took on the form of human flesh and
[2:05:27] came to the earth was born a little baby
[2:05:29] and walked among us and through his holy
[2:05:31] blood he prevailed now
[2:05:34] in the old testament how a man was to
[2:05:36] proclaim his own what did he do he took
[2:05:39] an uh elder 10 elders and went to the
[2:05:41] gate and introduced what he was doing to
[2:05:43] redeem what he had been lost and sold
[2:05:46] who he was and his give a witness we
[2:05:48] find a beautiful story here as i had a
[2:05:50] little note wrote here so i wouldn't
[2:05:52] forget it being nervous this morning up
[2:05:55] on ruth the kinsman and boaz we went
[2:05:58] through it not long ago i want you to
[2:06:00] notice the three stages now
[2:06:02] of this resting i want you to notice the
[2:06:04] resting of the church just exactly the
[2:06:07] same thing now watch the first place we
[2:06:09] find as we've all been through that
[2:06:11] sermon
[2:06:11] the kinsman redeemer god was made flesh
[2:06:15] in order to become the redeemer he was
[2:06:17] the one here in the fifth chapter in the
[2:06:19] fifth chapter said and no man in heaven
[2:06:22] nor in earth neither under the earth was
[2:06:24] able to open the book neither to look
[2:06:27] there on and i wept much because no man
[2:06:30] was found worthy to open the book or to
[2:06:32] read or to read the book neither to look
[2:06:34] their own
[2:06:36] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[2:06:38] not behold the lion of the tribe of
[2:06:40] judah the root of david has prevailed to
[2:06:43] open the book and to loose the seven
[2:06:45] seals thereof
[2:06:47] he's the one
[2:06:49] he's that one we're looking at
[2:06:51] notice how ruth
[2:06:54] how in uh naoma
[2:06:56] is just boaz
[2:06:57] perfect picture how neoma in a time of
[2:07:01] famine
[2:07:02] left the church left the country went
[2:07:04] over into the mobernite land to dwell
[2:07:07] during sojourn in there she lost all she
[2:07:09] had and when she went away her husband
[2:07:12] amelie died while i was over there so
[2:07:14] that left his inheritance to fall to
[2:07:16] anyone
[2:07:17] then when we come when she comes back
[2:07:19] she brings back the beautiful young
[2:07:21] mobinite willow with her and when boy i
[2:07:25] saw this widow a type of christ
[2:07:28] he fell for her
[2:07:30] and he loved her so he had to redeem the
[2:07:32] only way he could ever get her to be
[2:07:34] wife was to redeem what his brother
[2:07:37] amulek had lost
[2:07:38] and so then he asked his other brother
[2:07:40] if he would redeem it one question he
[2:07:43] couldn't do it so he went down to make a
[2:07:45] perfect
[2:07:47] uh
[2:07:47] example of the laws of god he went to
[2:07:51] the gates and he kicked off his shoes
[2:07:53] and so let it be known this day that i
[2:07:55] have redeemed all that knee on my hand
[2:07:59] all that she has all that hamlet my
[2:08:02] brother lost i am the next kinsman now
[2:08:05] and i'm the one that can redeem it so i
[2:08:07] have come to claim it if there's any man
[2:08:10] here can show or just call why are
[2:08:12] anybody close to me let it be known and
[2:08:14] everybody kept their mouth shut so he
[2:08:16] kicked off his shoe and thought it for a
[2:08:17] testimony i have redeemed
[2:08:21] that our brother emily's had why he was
[2:08:24] a kinsman
[2:08:25] he was a kin spokes redeemer oh how
[2:08:28] beautiful it is it's such a beautiful
[2:08:29] story and then
[2:08:31] all this time ruth was resting and
[2:08:34] waiting to find out how it would come
[2:08:36] out
[2:08:37] then he comes back no one can give a
[2:08:39] testimony against it he come back and
[2:08:41] talk uh neoma and talk ruth the
[2:08:44] beautiful moment girl and they were
[2:08:47] married and lived on this possession
[2:08:49] what a beautiful story there's three
[2:08:51] stages of ruth ruth uh
[2:08:56] uh
[2:08:57] ruth deciding
[2:08:59] she's deciding whether she would make
[2:09:00] the decision or not to go back into the
[2:09:02] homeland just like the church
[2:09:04] ruth serving when she went out to glean
[2:09:07] ruth resting that's what ruth is doing
[2:09:09] now the church now
[2:09:11] ruth rewarded now that's where the next
[2:09:14] thing happens is the reward of the
[2:09:16] church now we're going to have time
[2:09:18] because you've got a baptismal service
[2:09:20] and it's quarter after 11 now but maybe
[2:09:23] we'll pick this up next sunday or some
[2:09:24] other sunday in the future the lord
[2:09:26] willing and i'd like to take this down
[2:09:28] here to show these seven horns and seven
[2:09:30] eyes and exactly it was seven seals
[2:09:32] seven ministries seven angels of the
[2:09:35] church seven stars said oh this old
[2:09:37] spirit and right here ties the whole
[2:09:39] thing together yes sir had to be worthy
[2:09:42] so jesus is worthy
[2:09:46] at his return we will fully enjoy all
[2:09:49] the fullness of redemption blessings
[2:09:51] meat shall inherit the earth men and
[2:09:54] women shall be back sons and daughters
[2:09:55] of god and the complete millennium swing
[2:09:59] will be what a beautiful thing
[2:10:01] and the strong angel with a loud voice
[2:10:05] proclaiming who is worthy who is able to
[2:10:09] do this and then the elder said don't we
[2:10:12] for the line of the tribe of judah he is
[2:10:14] worthy and he has overcome and he tucked
[2:10:17] the book and opened the book and loosed
[2:10:19] the seals thereof and never told what
[2:10:21] happened to them when we hit them seven
[2:10:23] seals being opened right down through
[2:10:24] the bible watch what took place
[2:10:26] right in this seventh seal book that
[2:10:28] we're in and out holds a whole mystery
[2:10:30] of all the redemption blessings of god
[2:10:33] remember he is the lamb
[2:10:35] he's the only one that redeemed it and
[2:10:37] remember it's sealed on the backside of
[2:10:39] the book not written within amen it's
[2:10:42] sealed on the backside
[2:10:44] and it's not written within and he was
[2:10:46] the only one was able to even open the
[2:10:48] book or to reveal the book or to reveal
[2:10:51] the seal
[2:10:52] the only one that could do it so this is
[2:10:55] one thing they might squabble about this
[2:10:57] in here about what it is but he's the
[2:10:59] one that divinely interprets it but on
[2:11:01] the back side here there's no one can do
[2:11:03] it it belongs to him and him alone and
[2:11:06] he's the one that can reveal those seven
[2:11:09] mysteries out and watch every bit of it
[2:11:12] his own redemption
[2:11:14] how the church was redeemed and what
[2:11:15] will be the redeeming
[2:11:17] oh let us just love him with all of our
[2:11:19] hearts do all that we can
[2:11:24] a certain writer was writing a story
[2:11:26] just before close and turn the service
[2:11:28] back to brother neville do you enjoy
[2:11:29] revelation
[2:11:30] [Music]
[2:11:30] [Applause]
[2:11:32] amen we just got by three verses of it
[2:11:34] this morning but we'll pick it up again
[2:11:36] notice we just
[2:11:39] a writer was writing a book
[2:11:41] about a young
[2:11:43] girl that was trying to find god
[2:11:47] so many times that we
[2:11:49] uh hunt for god and look for god and
[2:11:53] if god was just everywhere and he had a
[2:11:55] great be well if he had a great big
[2:11:57] throne sitting up here somewhere
[2:11:58] everybody would believe in god then if
[2:12:00] god set up on a big drone here somewhere
[2:12:02] say he sits in this certain city and
[2:12:04] here he is this is god you go to me
[2:12:06] turn it like that well everybody would
[2:12:08] believe him then faith would be void we
[2:12:11] wouldn't have to have any faith at all
[2:12:12] and see that would be that will be in
[2:12:14] the millennium
[2:12:16] but now he's calling and trying to find
[2:12:18] out those who it looks mysterious and
[2:12:20] dark and you don't know how to do it but
[2:12:23] by faith we believe it
[2:12:24] we believe that's jesus did you
[2:12:27] understand that brother elmer see that
[2:12:28] now if god set up on the throne and said
[2:12:30] well here there here's god he lives down
[2:12:33] a certain place we'll go down there and
[2:12:34] say uh
[2:12:36] dear sir god uh would you do it yes i'll
[2:12:38] do it and it'd be done see well of
[2:12:40] course that's god well we see that so it
[2:12:43] would be faith would be made by
[2:12:45] faith's no good when you're positive
[2:12:47] what if every person in this world was a
[2:12:49] christian
[2:12:50] what if everybody was a spirit-filled
[2:12:52] christian
[2:12:54] well we wouldn't need any faith no more
[2:12:56] amen wouldn't need any faith at all and
[2:12:58] faith is a very is a very thing that
[2:13:00] we're saved by i think and that's reason
[2:13:02] it has to be some disagree with it so
[2:13:04] that we can exercise faith
[2:13:07] do you understand it now yeah you've got
[2:13:09] to have the other side see you've got to
[2:13:11] have a bad woman to make a real one
[2:13:12] stand out right
[2:13:14] see
[2:13:15] you got to be alive make the truth
[2:13:16] positive make it shine good if
[2:13:18] everything was truth it would just be so
[2:13:20] common
[2:13:22] but you see it's something wrong with
[2:13:24] something real when truth and faith and
[2:13:27] so forth now there we are
[2:13:29] now
[2:13:30] we've got to have these pro and cons
[2:13:32] that's the way it goes you've got to
[2:13:34] have good days to make you enjoy it or
[2:13:36] bad days make you enjoy the good you
[2:13:38] have to have a little sickness to make
[2:13:39] you enjoy good health see and you have
[2:13:41] to have your valleys to make you enjoy
[2:13:43] the mountaintops and so then some of
[2:13:45] these days will all be mountain tops
[2:13:46] they'll all be healthy they'll all be
[2:13:48] gone we'll all be joined there'll be a
[2:13:51] unending joys but until that time see we
[2:13:54] got to have this pro and con now
[2:13:56] everybody understands that say amen
[2:14:00] this girl was telling that she was
[2:14:01] trying to find god
[2:14:03] everywhere she went she'd go to this
[2:14:04] church in that church and whatever more
[2:14:06] but she couldn't find it
[2:14:07] once she found going down the road

[2:14:12] a little fella and he had a whole big
[2:14:14] cathedral on his back

[2:17:01] speaking to us about
[2:17:02] we asked it for god's glory through the
[2:17:04] name of his son jesus christ and while
[2:17:06] we have our heads bowed
[2:17:22] for the word
[2:17:24] again
[2:17:26] to understand
[2:17:27] more clearly some of the things he did
[2:17:28] say he was moving on to the revelation
[2:17:31] of the seven seals
[2:17:32] amen and that burden was on his on his
[2:17:35] heart it's on his shoulders as it were
[2:17:37] to move on with god not exactly knowing
[2:17:40] when it was going to take place i was
[2:17:41] going to take place
[2:17:42] amen but he wanted to be led by the
[2:17:45] spirit amen that's the same thing with
[2:17:47] you and me in this hour brother
[2:17:49] what are we looking for
[2:17:51] oh we're not looking for the suit yes we
[2:17:53] are
[2:17:54] because the problem of god or did
[2:17:57] explain to us that the revelation of the
[2:18:00] seven of the of the seven seals the
[2:18:02] revelation of what god was going to do
[2:18:04] in the ministry of william branham it
[2:18:06] was to give us rapturing faith
[2:18:09] give us the faith that we need amen all
[2:18:12] down through the ages god sent a
[2:18:14] messenger with a message to give them
[2:18:15] the faith that they needed in the age
[2:18:17] they lived oh yeah whether it's luther's
[2:18:20] age or wesley's or the pentecostal age
[2:18:22] and so on god said sent the the
[2:18:25] messengers with the message
[2:18:27] oh yeah
[2:18:28] and whether it was luther to give them
[2:18:30] the faith of
[2:18:32] justification wesley the faith of
[2:18:34] sanctification the pentecostals the
[2:18:36] faith of the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:18:38] the gifts of the spirit
[2:18:40] but praise the lord as i said but what
[2:18:43] was left after god finished with the
[2:18:45] pentecostals
[2:18:46] what else was left what was god going to
[2:18:48] do next amen
[2:18:50] we were justified sanctified filled with
[2:18:52] the holy ghost given access to the gifts
[2:18:55] of the spirit
[2:18:56] well lord what else is there well the
[2:18:58] only thing or anything else that was
[2:19:00] left left for god to do was the
[2:19:02] resurrection and the rapture amen and he
[2:19:05] was to send a messenger with a message
[2:19:07] to give us
[2:19:08] faith for the resurrection
[2:19:10] faith for the rapture amen
[2:19:13] brother god
[2:19:14] well
[2:19:15] yeah thank god for justification
[2:19:18] thank god he sanctified us thank god he
[2:19:21] filled us with the holy ghost and he
[2:19:22] gave us access to to the gifts of the
[2:19:24] spirit amen but brother now what is god
[2:19:26] required of us
[2:19:28] but that was previous ages that was
[2:19:30] previous believers amen it was the bride
[2:19:33] of christ in every age now again
[2:19:35] understand this many are called if you
[2:19:36] were chosen
[2:19:38] amen don't and don't condemn all that's
[2:19:40] called
[2:19:41] amen just just rejoice at your your
[2:19:43] number with the children
[2:19:45] amen the bride because again even the
[2:19:48] call they're going to be there as i said
[2:19:49] they'll be outside the city the chosen
[2:19:51] is the bride that'll be in the city so
[2:19:54] and again as i said i've had to preach
[2:19:56] it for years for believers to keep your
[2:19:58] attitude right keep your spirit right
[2:20:00] toward those out there amen and and god
[2:20:04] had to even even rebuke the prophet
[2:20:05] himself
[2:20:06] amen because uh
[2:20:08] because of his attitude toward those
[2:20:10] that oh they weren't pentecostals they
[2:20:12] weren't this they weren't that they
[2:20:13] didn't believe the message
[2:20:15] and oh and there were certain of the of
[2:20:18] the of the sisters or the ladies there
[2:20:20] and he would look at him and condemn
[2:20:22] them and the angel said brother brown
[2:20:24] don't you do that
[2:20:25] oh yeah
[2:20:26] he said because he says some of them are
[2:20:29] my children
[2:20:30] amen
[2:20:32] so brother sister keep your attitude
[2:20:34] right keep your spirit right thank god
[2:20:35] for what he has done and what he is
[2:20:37] doing in your life
[2:20:38] amen thank god for what he has done
[2:20:40] through the revealed word to give us
[2:20:42] resurrection and rapturing faith
[2:20:45] amen brother like i said he's not
[2:20:47] requiring what what he gave luther
[2:20:49] wesley the pentecostal we got that it's
[2:20:51] there amen praise the lord thank you
[2:20:54] jesus
[2:20:55] but and but now oh lord what are you
[2:20:58] requiring now for the resurrection oh
[2:21:02] and that's why he that's why there was a
[2:21:03] malachi 4.
[2:21:05] amen the ministry of malachi 4 the
[2:21:07] opening of the seals the revelation of
[2:21:09] the mystery of god
[2:21:11] amen
[2:21:12] and brother the mystery of god was going
[2:21:14] beyond justification sanctification the
[2:21:17] baptist the holy ghost the gifts of the
[2:21:19] spirit
[2:21:20] amen brother we're
[2:21:22] entering into the great mystery
[2:21:24] of the resurrection
[2:21:25] the rapture
[2:21:27] by the grace of god
[2:21:28] and brother the ministry of the word now
[2:21:31] is to folk get us to focus on the
[2:21:33] resurrection focus on the on the on the
[2:21:36] rapture to get out of here because that
[2:21:38] is what god is requiring of us
[2:21:41] amen
[2:21:42] so he's not just saying oh lord thank
[2:21:44] you for the prophet thank you for the
[2:21:45] prophet thank you for repeating this
[2:21:47] mystery of this mystery and that mystery
[2:21:49] well that's good
[2:21:50] yeah what's it doing for you
[2:21:52] and what are we doing for it
[2:21:54] amen
[2:21:56] praise the lord are we living for it
[2:21:58] amen that we're healing ourselves to the
[2:22:01] to the mystery of god in these last days
[2:22:03] amen and if we are
[2:22:05] more and more we're we're under the
[2:22:07] influencing money look up look up oh
[2:22:10] lord we're looking for the resurrection
[2:22:12] lord we're believing for the rapture
[2:22:13] we're believing for the change amen
[2:22:16] because lord you've done everything else
[2:22:18] this is the only thing left
[2:22:20] amen grace keep pressing on by the grace
[2:22:23] of god amen
[2:22:26] and of course in 1961 it's around this
[2:22:29] time that god was dealing with william
[2:22:31] branham and causing him to an anointing
[2:22:33] him to to move away from the first and
[2:22:35] second pull of his ministry to a third
[2:22:38] pull
[2:22:38] amen
[2:22:40] and even even brother bamwood
[2:22:43] was it was a mystery to him oh yeah and
[2:22:46] god had to deal with him deal with him
[2:22:48] let go let go let go leave that move on
[2:22:51] move on move on amen and and god had to
[2:22:55] allow this to happen in his ministry
[2:22:57] that to happen in his ministry to get
[2:22:59] him to
[2:23:00] leave that the first poll leave the
[2:23:02] second pull
[2:23:03] and
[2:23:04] basically
[2:23:05] eventually
[2:23:07] that's what a lot of people still wanted
[2:23:08] william branham for
[2:23:10] was the first and second pull
[2:23:13] and finally they turned him down because
[2:23:15] why because god got a hold of him and he
[2:23:17] stopped using the first and second
[2:23:19] gif as gifts that got to get signs
[2:23:23] yeah
[2:23:24] discerning the thoughts and intentions
[2:23:25] of the heart and doing this and oh yeah
[2:23:27] the sign in his hand and so on
[2:23:29] so he stopped using it
[2:23:31] yeah what for because god had to bring
[2:23:34] the people to the place to believe
[2:23:37] not signs and wonders but to believe
[2:23:40] believe the word amen and he was the
[2:23:43] prophet was moving on to the to give us
[2:23:45] the faith for the resurrection and the
[2:23:47] rapture
[2:23:48] oh yeah
[2:23:49] brother
[2:23:50] god wasn't the lane on the veins wasn't
[2:23:52] going to produce the resurrection and
[2:23:54] put us in the resurrection put us in the
[2:23:56] rapture no it was believing the word
[2:23:59] amen believe us thou this
[2:24:02] amen will come that hour
[2:24:05] to believe that jesus is the
[2:24:06] resurrection and the rapture
[2:24:09] he challenged martha
[2:24:11] why delight to raise lazarus or she said
[2:24:14] oh you'll rise you'll come up in the
[2:24:16] resurrection you'll be up there no he
[2:24:18] said i am the resurrection
[2:24:21] yeah now
[2:24:23] not will be
[2:24:24] now
[2:24:25] amen god help us to have the present
[2:24:27] tense revelation of the resurrection
[2:24:30] and the rapture
[2:24:32] not oh yeah i believe you'll do this
[2:24:34] you'll do this no son i want you to do
[2:24:36] it
[2:24:37] i want you to do it
[2:24:38] amen
[2:24:40] yeah well well you lord you you'll do
[2:24:42] the resurrection no he said i'm get i've
[2:24:44] given you the word i've given you the
[2:24:46] faith
[2:24:46] for the resurrection for the rapture i
[2:24:49] want you to do it
[2:24:50] that's why again and again i've said it
[2:24:52] so often that's why the prophet said he
[2:24:54] said god is waiting on us
[2:24:58] yeah and the dead in christ he said are
[2:25:00] waiting on us
[2:25:03] what they're waiting on us
[2:25:05] lazarus for waiting on jesus
[2:25:08] but if he if he stayed with martha he
[2:25:10] wouldn't have done it
[2:25:12] i don't know but he did it
[2:25:14] to show to show martha that he was the
[2:25:16] present tense resurrection
[2:25:19] not a future he said i am that i will be
[2:25:21] he said i am the resurrection praise the
[2:25:24] lord and brothers the same thing now is
[2:25:26] not oh
[2:25:28] we will be in the resurrection we're
