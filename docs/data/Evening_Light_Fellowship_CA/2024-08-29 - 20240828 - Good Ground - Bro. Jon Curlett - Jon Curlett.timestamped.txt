[40:42] with the camp meetings I think it was
[40:44] just an absolutely wonderful time in the
[40:46] Lord amen so I appreciate each one
[40:49] that's made the lazy lasagnas that has
[40:52] cut up and prepared the food beforehand
[40:55] that went and set up audio visual
[40:57] equipment and set up chairs and tables
[41:00] and took things apart and repackaged it
[41:03] and brother Chad entered the ministry
[41:05] this
[41:06] weekend the ministry of
[41:08] transportation did all the hauling back
[41:10] and forth took his time and his vehicles
[41:12] and his gas and his employees and these
[41:14] different things
[41:15] and my it was just a wonderful time
[41:18] wasn't it amen but we thank the Lord
[41:20] most of all for his presence for his
[41:22] faithfulness amen for preparing these
[41:24] things and ordaining it and I think I I
[41:26] just have to believe the Lord had his
[41:28] way amen that it was a wonderful time
[41:31] but thank you each one that that puts it
[41:33] all that time in again Especial thanks
[41:35] to brother Paul and sister Kimberly for
[41:37] their extra effort above and beyond and
[41:40] you know there's is an unpaid gig like
[41:43] most of the offices in the church but
[41:45] they've really put their time and energy
[41:47] on the line and we sure appreciate that
[41:49] what they've done amen God bless you
[41:51] Mark 4 and: 2 this is Jesus and it says
[41:55] and he taught them many things by
[41:56] parables and said unto them in his
[41:58] Doctrine hearken behold there went out a
[42:02] sewer to sew and it came to pass as he
[42:04] sewed some fell by the wayside and the
[42:06] fowls of the air came and devoured it up
[42:08] and some fell on Stony ground where it
[42:11] had not much Earth and immediately it
[42:13] sprang up because it had no depth of
[42:16] Earth says but when the sun was up it
[42:18] was scorched and because it had no root
[42:21] it withered away and some fell among
[42:23] thorns and the Thorns grew up and choked
[42:26] it and it yielded no fruit and others
[42:28] fell on good ground and did yield fruit
[42:31] that sprang up and increased and brought
[42:33] forth some 30 and some 60 and some 100
[42:38] and he said unto them he that have ears
[42:41] let him hear amen God bless you can have
[42:44] your seats this evening and you I was
[42:46] talking to brother Aaron about this that
[42:48] I think the toughest surface to preach
[42:50] is the one that's right after camp
[42:52] meeting because we've come there and
[42:55] it's the people have out you know they
[42:56] come out with such a great attitude and
[42:58] that warmth and anticipation they're
[43:00] basking in the goodness of the things of
[43:02] God and it's a wonderful thing and we
[43:04] love it and we appreciate it but then
[43:06] the preacher has to come up behind
[43:08] afterwards and we can feel pressure if
[43:11] I'm to be honest this evening amen
[43:13] because what happens is we've got to
[43:15] keep moving forward amen we've got to
[43:17] keep pressing on and it's good to talk
[43:19] and fellowship and share our experiences
[43:21] and boy if we have a testimony we ought
[43:23] to be telling it to everybody that'll
[43:24] listen to us telling your testimony will
[43:27] encourage you it'll it'll anchor it
[43:29] it'll settle it in your heart the more
[43:31] we talk about the things of God then the
[43:33] more those things become a reality in
[43:34] our life and it helps give us faith and
[43:36] it helps us to hold on the things that
[43:38] we've gotten amen and you I was talking
[43:40] with brother Paul and Sister Kim and I
[43:42] said I just wish we could stay in Camp
[43:43] all the time you know and it's it's it's
[43:46] 99% Believers and and everyone's just
[43:49] pulling together and it's it's a just a
[43:51] little taste of Heaven I think it's a
[43:53] preview of what we'll have on the other
[43:55] side even though we're in these sinful
[43:57] bodies that get tired and occasionally
[43:59] cranky or a little wore out and these
[44:01] different things but we know we don't
[44:02] get to do that and we have to come back
[44:04] to real life and we have to come back to
[44:06] the Daily Grind and we have commitments
[44:08] and all of these different things and we
[44:10] have to raise our families and go to our
[44:12] jobs and whatnot and sometimes it's that
[44:15] first few days after camp that can be
[44:16] the toughest the first few days after
[44:18] special meetings the first few days
[44:19] after a wonderful experience with God
[44:21] and you know I was just thinking about
[44:23] this and I I looked up what brother Bram
[44:25] said because he talks about this
[44:26] transition time of of coming back to the
[44:28] way you have to live your day-to-day
[44:30] life amen we don't really get that that
[44:32] that permanency of of being in the
[44:34] presence of God and the people of God
[44:36] until we get to the other side and
[44:38] brother bam talks about this and he says
[44:39] then I wonder sometimes I get so
[44:42] discouraged the prophet of God with the
[44:44] signs and wonders the the the the
[44:46] Fantastic Ministry that he he had he
[44:48] says I get so discouraged it's a wonder
[44:51] my wife can put up with me I go around
[44:54] and after the meeting I feel so moody I
[44:56] Cry a while and walk around a while and
[44:58] say oh I'm a total failure I don't see
[45:01] why the Lord ever had anything to do
[45:03] with me he says it's coming out from
[45:05] under that anointing you see he says
[45:07] when you're up there when you're up on
[45:09] the platform you could pack the world
[45:11] away and when you're down here or what
[45:13] when everything's kind of drained away
[45:16] he says you're down here it's all right
[45:19] when when everything's kind of moved
[45:20] back to normal he says it's all right
[45:22] but it's coming between the two he says
[45:24] he he says see that's where it gets you
[45:28] it's it's not that that when you're up
[45:30] here that it's it's all good and and
[45:32] down here it's all bad because down here
[45:34] it's not bad the Walk of the of the
[45:36] Christian daily is an overcoming walk
[45:38] it's a Victorious walk but there's a
[45:40] transition of the feeling a and the just
[45:43] the overpowering of the anointing of God
[45:46] and he says it's when you're coming down
[45:48] off of it that's where the real struggle
[45:50] is and he point to Elijah and he has a
[45:52] Mount Caramel experience and God comes
[45:55] down and he he proves himself by fire
[45:58] and he proves his word and he proves his
[46:00] prophet and then the prophet goes and he
[46:02] calls for rain and at his word rain
[46:04] comes and he kills the prophets the
[46:07] false prophets of Jezebel and
[46:09] everything's going so good and then he's
[46:11] got still that much strength and his
[46:13] legs and his body that he can outrun
[46:15] ahab's Chariot down the mountain he's
[46:17] had a supernatural experience in the
[46:19] presence of God and then brother Braham
[46:22] says what happens he goes and he ends up
[46:24] running away from a woman's voice
[46:27] it's that transition away from from the
[46:30] highs of the experience of of the
[46:32] blessings of God now walking down to
[46:34] where we walk day by day and it's not
[46:36] that we can't have those things day by
[46:38] day it's just that we don't tend to have
[46:40] those things day by day because we're
[46:41] not committed day in and day out to be
[46:43] spending our time around the people of
[46:44] God and the word of God we've got to
[46:46] work we've got to focus on other things
[46:48] we've got to make a living amen and you
[46:50] know sometimes the hardest thing for me
[46:52] is driving the ministers and and their
[46:54] spouses to the airport because when I do
[46:56] it seems like we're just dropping off a
[46:58] part of the experience we're dropping
[47:00] off a part of our little family here and
[47:02] it just seems like a part of your heart
[47:04] goes with them so that was why I was
[47:06] kind of glad when brother Chad agreed to
[47:07] do it or he asked to do it actually he
[47:09] didn't agree to do it he offered to do
[47:10] it and it allowed me to get some sleep
[47:13] yesterday and and and wake up I had to
[47:15] study all day to prepare for service and
[47:16] back to work and these different things
[47:19] but but as good as those things are
[47:21] we've got to keep moving forward amen
[47:23] we've got to press forward and we can be
[47:24] thankful for those things they they
[47:26] become a part of our our Christian walk
[47:28] they become a part of our testimony they
[47:30] become of growing in Christ in Grace and
[47:32] in love but we have to keep going from
[47:34] those things even brother Aaron was
[47:36] saying this week you can't look back to
[47:37] what you had you have to press forward
[47:39] to what is going to be what God has for
[47:41] you you I was talking with brother Aaron
[47:43] for quite some time on Sunday evening
[47:45] and he shared something a minister once
[47:47] said to him and this is a a well-known
[47:49] Minister a very Dynamic Minister he's
[47:51] not a you know a fuddy duddy that
[47:53] doesn't believe in the moving of the
[47:55] spirit or or these sorts of things
[47:56] things but they'd had some great
[47:58] services that weekend and and the
[48:00] brother said you know he said every
[48:01] service can't be like those kinds of
[48:04] services we want those Services we love
[48:07] those Services if we are honest most of
[48:08] us would probably prefer those types of
[48:11] services he says but there's a problem
[48:13] with with having those Services all
[48:15] those times he says because those
[48:16] services are often a harvesting of
[48:20] something there's been a battle there's
[48:22] been a struggle there's been a seeking
[48:24] there's been a pressing there's been a
[48:25] praying there's been an expectation and
[48:27] then finally everyone comes together the
[48:29] presence of God comes down and he
[48:31] answers us he says but the thing is if
[48:33] you're always doing that he says you're
[48:35] never
[48:36] planting you're never planting see we've
[48:39] got a plant there's a cycle remember we
[48:40] preached those Services where where we
[48:43] said that that the word of God is in a
[48:45] cycle and it's not always maturing it's
[48:47] not always uh producing that fruit it's
[48:50] not always getting the benefits because
[48:52] there's got to be a planting time and a
[48:54] dying out time and a growing time and a
[48:56] maturing time and then there's a time
[48:58] where where things just have to
[48:59] completely dry out to come out and be
[49:01] that that mature fruit and then there's
[49:03] a harvest time so we've got to have all
[49:06] of these different things and and this
[49:08] Pastor said he said I would be concerned
[49:10] if every service was like
[49:13] that amen it's not the way it's supposed
[49:15] to be we have Services of worship and
[49:17] praise and victory but we also need
[49:19] Services of repentance and sorrow
[49:22] remember brother bam he has that service
[49:24] it might be convinced and concerned I'm
[49:25] not sure and the and the people are just
[49:27] in a state of repentance and it's very
[49:29] sober and I remember brother Gerald
[49:31] repeating this many times he says we
[49:33] need to have more services like this
[49:36] amen where there's a dying out where
[49:38] there's a putting aside there's a
[49:39] separation we need Services where
[49:41] there's a deep inward searching amen
[49:44] where we compare where we're at with
[49:46] what the word says we need Services of
[49:48] healing we remember when brother Joe
[49:50] Adams was here and his whole Ministry is
[49:52] on Faith and Healing we need services
[49:54] like that but we can't have every
[49:56] service like that amen it can't all be
[49:59] that we need Services of correction we
[50:00] need Services of encouragement we need
[50:03] Services of discernment where the Lord
[50:04] is just moving throughout the the the
[50:06] body of Christ in these different things
[50:09] remember what Paul said to Timothy he
[50:10] said all scripture is
[50:13] given I've got an issue here okay
[50:16] brother Matt she's coming down for you
[50:18] in 2 Timothy 3:16 Paul said all
[50:21] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[50:25] and it's profitable for doctr
[50:28] oh that's
[50:29] teaching he says then for reproof that's
[50:33] correction that's not just correction
[50:35] that's saying you know better then he
[50:37] says for instruction in righteousness
[50:39] that's how to live that's how to how to
[50:42] have an overcoming life that's how to be
[50:44] pleasing in God's eyes so in other words
[50:46] the word is given for all sorts of
[50:48] purposes and that means it's delivered
[50:50] in all sorts of different ways for those
[50:52] different purposes and we ought to be
[50:54] able to rejoice in all of it I love love
[50:56] how brother Aram brought that out i'
[50:58] never seen it that way where he said
[51:00] that David said thy rod and thy staff
[51:02] they comfort me that the correction that
[51:06] the guiding of God in our lives is a
[51:08] comfort because it means he's there and
[51:11] he's concerned about what we're doing
[51:13] amen and it's a comfort and he was
[51:14] talking about how when God steps on your
[51:16] toes when the preacher steps on your
[51:18] toes when the word comes into your life
[51:20] and it makes something uncomfortable we
[51:22] ought to say hallelujah to those moments
[51:24] because it means that God cares about
[51:25] where we're at and what we're doing and
[51:27] what's going on inside of our Lives amen
[51:29] it's good when God comes down do those
[51:31] things and and it brings us to a place
[51:33] of Victory it brings us to a place of
[51:35] healing it brings us to a place of
[51:36] Deliverance because when we can live
[51:38] where his word is then we can be blessed
[51:41] amen we can't enjoy the goodness of God
[51:43] living a life of our own leading it's
[51:45] got to be his leading that does it and
[51:47] the guidance and correction of God the
[51:48] teaching of God takes us into his
[51:51] goodness you know and really life is
[51:53] defined by
[51:54] contrast you'll notice that people that
[51:57] that are working all the time all they
[51:59] want is the weekend and and but yet when
[52:01] you give them the weekend all the time
[52:03] they go into retirement so many of them
[52:04] struggle because there's no contrast
[52:07] every day is the same it's the work that
[52:09] makes the weekend en that much more
[52:11] enjoyable you know we don't like
[52:13] sickness but sickness is what makes our
[52:15] health that much more enjoyable we don't
[52:17] have much money and then we have more
[52:18] money and the contrast of those things
[52:21] is is the way that God is so many times
[52:23] and even in the beginning the the second
[52:25] verse of the Bible says God he he
[52:27] divided the light from the darkness and
[52:30] he dwells in that light the scripture
[52:32] says there's no no no variableness in
[52:34] him there's no shadow of turning there's
[52:36] he's just pure light he's he he's Purity
[52:39] in itself and everything else is
[52:41] darkness is not God but there's a
[52:43] contrast between him and everything else
[52:46] amen and our lives are defined by those
[52:48] contrasts and so if we have Services all
[52:51] the time that are those shouting
[52:53] praising there's no contrast there and
[52:56] we find they actually don't have the
[52:57] effect that they're supposed to have
[52:59] because we don't have anything else to
[53:00] put them up against
[53:02] amen Solomon knew this by inspiration in
[53:06] Ecclesiastes he said to everything there
[53:08] is a season and a time to every purpose
[53:11] under the heaven a time to be born a
[53:14] time to die a time to plant a time to
[53:17] pluck up that which is planted A Time to
[53:19] Kill and a time to heal a time to break
[53:21] down a time to build up a time to weep
[53:24] and a time to laugh a time to MN and a
[53:27] time to dance a time to Cast Away Stones
[53:30] a time to gather Stones together a time
[53:32] to embrace a time to hug a time to be
[53:34] close and a time to refrain from the
[53:37] embracing he says a time to get and a
[53:39] time to lose a time to keep and a time
[53:42] to Cast Away a time a to Rend a time to
[53:45] tear a time to sww a time to keep
[53:48] silence a time to speak a time to love
[53:51] and a time to hate a time of war and a
[53:54] time of
[53:55] Peace So our lives are defined by these
[53:58] contrasts and we'll see that the word of
[54:00] God brings those contrasts into our
[54:02] lives and let me say this this this
[54:04] evening if you're in the time that
[54:06] doesn't feel so good know this there's a
[54:08] time of good that's coming and if you're
[54:10] in the time that's so good then guess
[54:12] what there's going to be a battle that's
[54:14] coming as well life is constantly
[54:16] changing and having an overcoming life
[54:18] does not mean that the circumstances are
[54:20] always good but what it means is that
[54:22] there's an anchor there's a rest in our
[54:23] heart and soul that is unchanging
[54:25] regardless of what those circumstances
[54:27] are inside of our life amen so this is
[54:30] my Prelude I want to take a just a
[54:32] service this evening on good ground good
[54:35] ground and because I want to help us to
[54:38] build off the experiences that we have
[54:39] with God not just this weekend but
[54:41] hopefully every week amen that that we
[54:44] can go by because we know the Rapture is
[54:46] a process amen we're not just going to
[54:48] walk through this life and then one day
[54:50] we're going to have rapturing faith that
[54:52] we're going to be walking around and
[54:53] we've got no overcoming power we've got
[54:55] no Victory we've got no arment and then
[54:57] tomorrow we go in a Rapture that is not
[54:59] going to happen God is building a body
[55:02] he is tying the people together under
[55:04] his headship and that is how we're going
[55:06] to go into raptures we're coming into a
[55:09] place of maturity amen I want to be able
[55:11] to look back and say God I see how I'm
[55:14] growing God I see how we're maturing
[55:16] brother Aaron and sister Lydia were
[55:17] saying how much the church has changed
[55:20] even in the last two years that they've
[55:21] been here that's a good thing we don't
[55:23] see it so often because we're around
[55:25] each other all the time but you get
[55:26] somebody that's been here and then they
[55:28] come in and they say oh my goodness
[55:30] things are so different now we say
[55:32] praise the Lord for that amen it shows
[55:34] that he's working inside of our lives
[55:37] but I want to keep going I want to keep
[55:38] pressing I want to keep maturing I want
[55:40] to keep growing as he challenges me I
[55:42] want to rise to the occasion by faith in
[55:44] the word and say Lord I'm ready to grow
[55:46] some more you know I was reading in my
[55:48] devotions this morning first
[55:49] Thessalonians 4:10 and Paul says we
[55:52] beseech you Brethren that ye increase
[55:55] more and
[55:56] more in other words you're doing great
[55:59] but don't stop don't rest on that keep
[56:02] going keep growing keep keep maturing in
[56:04] Christ amen so I want to go back to this
[56:07] parable of the S and we opened up in
[56:10] mark But I want to read the
[56:12] interpretation of it in Luke because
[56:14] Jesus gives a little more uh a little
[56:16] more detail here than he does in the
[56:18] others I
[56:19] felt Luke 8:11 says now the parable is
[56:22] this the seed is the word of God and
[56:24] you'll notice one thing as we look at
[56:26] this Parable the seed is never the
[56:28] problem the S is never the problem
[56:32] there's nothing wrong with the seed
[56:33] there's nothing wrong with the swer the
[56:35] problem is always with what the seed
[56:37] lands on that's where the problem always
[56:39] is amen the the the failures are a
[56:41] reflection of where the word lands not
[56:43] what the word is and brother Brian would
[56:45] say this he says God is his word do you
[56:48] believe God is his word he says every
[56:51] word of God is a seed you believe that
[56:54] he says now it's just like a seed you
[56:55] planted and if it's wheat it'll come up
[56:59] wheat he says every Divine promise of
[57:02] God will come to pass exactly now watch
[57:06] what he
[57:07] says if you'll put it in the right kind
[57:12] of
[57:13] ground and let it grow so it's got to
[57:17] come in the right kind of ground but
[57:19] we've got to work to do here he says
[57:21] you've got to let it grow you've got to
[57:24] let it become what it is
[57:26] you've got to let it mature into what is
[57:28] inside of it he says do you believe that
[57:30] place it there and say Lord by his
[57:32] stripes I was healed I'm Healed I accept
[57:35] it Lord and I'll never say nothing else
[57:37] I tell you brother that spits the dust
[57:39] in the devil's face right there for it's
[57:41] thus sayi the Lord I'll stay right there
[57:43] live or die I'll stay right there he
[57:45] says that's my convictions that's my
[57:48] stand on Christ the solid rock I'll
[57:50] stand all other ground is sinking SS he
[57:52] says stay right with it yes indeed it'll
[57:55] prod produce just what it said we're
[57:59] talking about good ground and he says
[58:01] it's got to be in the right kind of
[58:03] ground he says and you've got to let it
[58:05] grow in other words we've got something
[58:07] to do with this it me it's not just that
[58:10] this word is a magic potion that comes
[58:12] into our life and it just does something
[58:14] but we've got a part to play here and he
[58:16] says we've got to prepare the ground
[58:18] we've got to make sure the ground is
[58:19] good and then we've got to let the word
[58:21] do its job inside of our lives and our
[58:24] part is to make the ground ready
[58:26] that's what we're supposed to do our
[58:28] part is to set the conditions of our
[58:30] life such that life can come forth that
[58:33] we can control the environment that we
[58:35] can take something that's been planted
[58:37] and let it grow up inside of our lives
[58:39] and we'll talk about this a bit as we go
[58:41] through so he continues he says those by
[58:44] the
[58:44] wayside are they that hear this is the
[58:47] rocky ground he says but then cometh the
[58:49] devil and taketh away the word out of
[58:51] their hearts lest they should believe
[58:53] and be saved now there's one thing we
[58:55] know even though we're not Farmers is
[58:57] you can't grow wheat on rocks it doesn't
[59:00] work amen it needs ground to grow and
[59:02] Stones aren't part of what Farmers would
[59:03] call a good ground you know if you're
[59:06] ever around a farmer's field I've seen
[59:07] them in Newland out in the gouls here
[59:10] where they'd have a sledge or a sled
[59:11] behind their tractor and every spring
[59:13] they go through and what are they
[59:14] pulling out of the ground rocks the
[59:18] biggest crop that Newland has is
[59:20] rocks and you can go through that field
[59:23] and it can be pristine after you take
[59:26] your harvest in the fall and you'll come
[59:28] back in the spring and you've got rock
[59:30] after Rock after Rock why the frost th
[59:33] the the freeze thaw cycle brings these
[59:35] rocks to the surface and they mess up
[59:37] your field and so they got to go all
[59:39] through there and clean that again
[59:40] before they plant a new
[59:42] crop now I don't want to turn this into
[59:45] a Negative Nancy sermon and believe me
[59:47] that's not what we're here for tonight
[59:48] but I'm here to help you hold on to what
[59:50] you've received that's what we're
[59:52] talking about amen talking about the
[59:54] background will let us see where the
[59:55] traps and and the pitfalls are before we
[59:57] get to what the good ground is and so we
[59:59] see here that if you're living a life
[1:00:01] that produces spiritual rocks then guess
[1:00:03] what just because it's the word of God
[1:00:05] does not mean it's going to come to
[1:00:07] life you've got to have a place where it
[1:00:09] can come in and dig down into the soil
[1:00:11] amen God does his part he sends his word
[1:00:14] amen he sends his anointing Behind these
[1:00:16] things and we just expect it to do
[1:00:18] amazing things because it's God but
[1:00:20] Jesus says no you've got to have a
[1:00:22] ground prepared in order for the word to
[1:00:25] take effect amen a seed doesn't get
[1:00:27] planted grow mature and get harvested in
[1:00:30] a moment or in a day it's a cycle of
[1:00:33] time amen and God's word is no different
[1:00:35] time and time again the scripture calls
[1:00:37] the word a seed or it Compares it to a
[1:00:39] seed and so that's how we understand how
[1:00:42] it works I took a whole service on this
[1:00:44] remember on the cycle of the word and
[1:00:46] how it has to be planted and rooted and
[1:00:48] then grow and then break through the
[1:00:50] surface and then it really starts to
[1:00:51] grow then it has to
[1:00:53] mature and then it has to ripen
[1:00:56] and then there's a harvest and all of
[1:00:58] these things so we've got to make a
[1:01:00] place for the word to grow inside of our
[1:01:03] lives and he says they on the Rock are
[1:01:05] they which when they hear receive the
[1:01:07] word how with
[1:01:11] joy he says and they have no root which
[1:01:13] for a while believe but in time of
[1:01:16] Temptation fall away this is the
[1:01:18] trickiest of all the conditions that a
[1:01:20] person can have because it says that
[1:01:22] they receive the word with joy they love
[1:01:25] the pr preaching of the word they love
[1:01:27] the worship they love the presence of
[1:01:29] God they love when the spirit of God
[1:01:31] comes down they love the atmosphere they
[1:01:32] love the fellowship it's so good it's
[1:01:35] wonderful and they're glowing after the
[1:01:39] service but then Temptation comes and
[1:01:41] they don't have
[1:01:43] Victory he says Temptation and
[1:01:45] Temptation here that that word means the
[1:01:48] trial the testing the proving of a
[1:01:51] person's integrity and
[1:01:53] commitment so in other words when the
[1:01:55] word is asked to be put into action in
[1:01:58] their life what happens is their living
[1:02:01] doesn't match up to their
[1:02:03] worship their experience doesn't match
[1:02:06] the decisions that they start making in
[1:02:08] their life anden there's a separation
[1:02:10] from their Church experience and their
[1:02:12] day-to-day experience they receive it
[1:02:14] with joy remember brother bam talks
[1:02:16] about when he was looking into you know
[1:02:18] he trying to understand how two men
[1:02:20] could have true gifts and they would be
[1:02:22] perfect in their operation but he says
[1:02:24] one was a real believer and one was and
[1:02:26] he says and God showed him that the rain
[1:02:28] falls on the just and the unjust and the
[1:02:30] weeds enjoy the rain just as much as the
[1:02:32] wheat enjoys the
[1:02:34] rain and so we can sit here and we can
[1:02:36] enjoy the preaching of the word but if
[1:02:39] we are not truly
[1:02:41] sincere if we're enjoying the moment but
[1:02:44] the ground isn't prepared then what
[1:02:46] happens when the hard time comes then we
[1:02:48] lose the
[1:02:49] victory we lose the word we lose the
[1:02:51] effect of the word brother Bram says it
[1:02:53] this way he says I've seen a lot of camp
[1:02:54] meetings people people go they'd shout
[1:02:56] the victory for a little while while the
[1:02:58] camp meeting was going on and then
[1:03:00] before the day was over with the night
[1:03:02] coming close they'll worry along and say
[1:03:04] well you know I wish I could keep the
[1:03:05] victory
[1:03:08] Hallelujah Oh my he says my I wish I
[1:03:12] just had the victory oh my says it's
[1:03:14] because you're not in the right place to
[1:03:16] eat the Mana that's right he says
[1:03:18] salvation only lasts as long as Faith
[1:03:23] lasts Divine Healing lasts as long as
[1:03:27] Faith lasts you don't go by your
[1:03:31] feelings
[1:03:32] amen can we say it together you don't go
[1:03:36] by your feelings he says I never was
[1:03:39] saved by my feelings I say praise the
[1:03:41] Lord for that because my feelings even
[1:03:44] as stable as I tend to be they still do
[1:03:47] this some of you go up and down like
[1:03:50] this and some of us go up and down like
[1:03:52] this but we all go up and down and our
[1:03:54] feelings come and go from good to bad
[1:03:55] don't they he says I never was saved by
[1:03:58] my feelings I wasn't saved because I
[1:04:01] felt good he didn't say we don't feel
[1:04:03] good we feel good don't we but he says
[1:04:06] that's not our saving he says I'm saved
[1:04:09] because I met God's promise he says
[1:04:12] that's right the devil can beat you
[1:04:14] around the stump on feelings but he
[1:04:17] can't speak on thus sayeth the Lord and
[1:04:20] condemn it he said I've done what Jesus
[1:04:22] said I'm saved tonight because I met
[1:04:24] God's requirement
[1:04:26] I'm Healed tonight amen we stand on thus
[1:04:30] sayith the Lord not on how we're feeling
[1:04:32] after it's all said and
[1:04:33] done amen as we go through life this
[1:04:36] life has a way of beating down our
[1:04:38] feelings but if we got the victory in
[1:04:40] here if the word is settled he says then
[1:04:42] he's not going to beat us up on that
[1:04:44] because we're resting on thus sayeth the
[1:04:47] Lord what is he comparing this rock to
[1:04:51] feelings that but there's a lack of real
[1:04:54] spiritual depth there's a lack a real
[1:04:56] Faith it's shallow ground they can't
[1:04:58] grow roots there's enough there for
[1:05:00] something to start but not enough for it
[1:05:02] to finish am me there's just a there
[1:05:05] there's a process that starts under the
[1:05:07] preaching of the word but this this type
[1:05:09] of a person doesn't want to go all the
[1:05:11] way they believe but only to a point
[1:05:15] right they agree but only to a point
[1:05:18] they want God in their life but only to
[1:05:20] a point And now when the test comes then
[1:05:23] they say sorry I didn't sign up for this
[1:05:25] and it falls away out of their life and
[1:05:27] they lose what they thought they had he
[1:05:30] said that's he said that's the way the
[1:05:31] word went and goes out some hear the
[1:05:33] word go out birds come along pick it up
[1:05:35] see they don't do no good at all but
[1:05:37] catch how he he phrases this now he says
[1:05:40] others come up
[1:05:41] overnight oh they're going to do great
[1:05:44] things and when the trials begin to come
[1:05:47] it chokes them down what's he talking
[1:05:49] about overnight
[1:05:51] Sensations right they have all the
[1:05:53] energy they have all the passion and
[1:05:55] then as soon as it has a personal
[1:05:59] impact in some way they say
[1:06:02] sorry it's not for
[1:06:06] me they're enthusiastic about the
[1:06:09] idea but they don't like the
[1:06:11] reality amen remember what John said or
[1:06:15] he quotes in Revelation 10 I think it's
[1:06:17] 8 where the angel says go and take the
[1:06:20] book go take the open book and he says
[1:06:22] eat it and he says it'll be sweet in
[1:06:25] your mouth
[1:06:26] but it'll be bitter in your belly and we
[1:06:29] can see that through the Christian walk
[1:06:31] is that there's an an enthusiasm and a
[1:06:34] passion that comes under the hearing of
[1:06:36] the word the receiving of the word but
[1:06:38] when we go to put into the action the
[1:06:40] digestion is not so easy anymore is it
[1:06:44] it's not so easy to do these things amen
[1:06:47] it doesn't feel good but one thing we
[1:06:49] know the results are always worth it but
[1:06:51] you've got to be able to do it brother
[1:06:52] BR would talk so many times he says if
[1:06:55] the medicine doesn't make you feel sick
[1:06:56] then it's not doing you any good in the
[1:06:58] first place if it tastes good then it's
[1:06:59] not medicine in the first
[1:07:01] place listen I church I believe in the
[1:07:03] changing power of the Holy Spirit I was
[1:07:05] changed in one moment amen when when I
[1:07:08] met Christ when I gave my life fully and
[1:07:10] completely to Christ I was completely
[1:07:12] changed in a moment
[1:07:15] absolutely absolutely but that didn't
[1:07:17] mean that I didn't have battles and
[1:07:19] struggles and fallings away and ups and
[1:07:22] downs and all these things inside of my
[1:07:24] life amen we believe that people that
[1:07:26] are truly meeting Christ that receive
[1:07:28] the new birth they're not who they used
[1:07:30] to be and it does it is a work of a
[1:07:32] moment but the proving of that moment
[1:07:34] takes a lifetime amen it takes real life
[1:07:37] to test those things and passion won't
[1:07:39] do the job passion will not get us
[1:07:42] through this amen now let's be very
[1:07:44] careful here I'd rather some Wildfire
[1:07:47] than no fire at all amen if we sit here
[1:07:50] like a lump on a
[1:07:52] log God help us amen we ought to be able
[1:07:55] to worship we ought to be able to
[1:07:57] respond to the word of God Amen but it
[1:07:59] ought to be a fire that reflects a
[1:08:01] reality in our life a sincerity in our
[1:08:03] life rather than just enthusiasm about
[1:08:06] what's going on Amen we want people that
[1:08:09] are enthusiastic because they know what
[1:08:11] it means to live what they're
[1:08:14] amening Amen in other words we want
[1:08:17] people that are enthusiastic about the
[1:08:19] effect not just the idea that's the
[1:08:22] reason why we keep coming back to hear
[1:08:24] the word and we accept it is wise
[1:08:26] because we've tasted and seen that the
[1:08:27] Lord is good we didn't say it was all
[1:08:29] sweet and sugary all the time but we've
[1:08:31] tasted and seen that the results are
[1:08:33] worth the pain and the TR struggles and
[1:08:35] the trials that we go through amen
[1:08:37] because as brother Bram said our
[1:08:38] feelings of Salvation our feelings of
[1:08:40] overcoming our our feelings of Victory
[1:08:42] won't won't hold us in times of stress
[1:08:45] in times of trial in times of testing
[1:08:47] and difficulty it takes an anchor in the
[1:08:49] soul amen it takes something deep inside
[1:08:52] of us amen knowing that he's with me
[1:08:55] that I didn't just hear a word I
[1:08:57] received a word and the word responded
[1:08:59] to the word and that's what's bubbling
[1:09:00] up inside of my life brother B says this
[1:09:03] he says what does the bible say that we
[1:09:05] are if we cannot stand the chastisement
[1:09:07] of God he says then we become
[1:09:09] illegitimate children so-called children
[1:09:11] but not real children of God he says the
[1:09:14] children of God know exactly where they
[1:09:17] stand where do they stand they stand on
[1:09:20] the word of God he says they know where
[1:09:23] they put their hope their faith their
[1:09:26] trust and nothing will ever shake them
[1:09:29] from it amen I say Lord help us to rest
[1:09:31] in that place because here's the thing
[1:09:33] has anybody ever had a moment of
[1:09:35] enthusiasm and then got it followed by
[1:09:38] disappointment all 10 fingers are are
[1:09:41] twinkling up here
[1:09:42] today listen if nothing else I
[1:09:44] disappoint
[1:09:46] myself time and time again I'll say Lord
[1:09:49] I thought I was further ahead than
[1:09:51] that but yet it's not about the
[1:09:54] enthusiasm men but it Victory is not
[1:09:57] about me Victory is about whether the
[1:09:59] word is kept in preeminence scripture
[1:10:01] says a just man falls seven times and
[1:10:04] get it up again it's not about my
[1:10:06] perfection it's not about my my great
[1:10:08] track record it's not about my my
[1:10:11] knowing all things but Victory is
[1:10:13] whether I can keep the word in
[1:10:14] preeminence in my life and say Lord
[1:10:17] that's where my rest is I'm standing on
[1:10:19] your word and I'm trusting your Holy
[1:10:21] Spirit to bring me all the way through
[1:10:22] to full and total Victory amen and how
[1:10:25] many times have I had to say Lord I'm
[1:10:28] sorry Lord I'm sorry I missed the Mark
[1:10:32] again and guess what church whether
[1:10:35] you've already fallen since that camp
[1:10:37] meeting whether you're going to fall
[1:10:38] tomorrow whether it'll be a month or
[1:10:40] whether it'll be a year at some point
[1:10:42] we're going to lose at some
[1:10:44] point that's the reality of living in
[1:10:47] this
[1:10:48] flesh and it may be in the smallest way
[1:10:51] but here's the thing the more mature you
[1:10:52] get the greater those small things hit
[1:10:54] you anyways
[1:10:55] and so you'll have a bad response you
[1:10:57] might say something that's not quite the
[1:10:58] way you meant it however that might be
[1:11:00] or you might have a big failing or
[1:11:01] falling out that is not where our rest
[1:11:05] is our rest is is that we've received
[1:11:07] the word it's engrafted in our heart and
[1:11:09] it's doing a work in our lives that's
[1:11:11] going to produce an overcoming Amen in
[1:11:14] our lives not everything I pray for
[1:11:16] happens sometimes our disappointments
[1:11:18] are on un on in unanswered prayers or it
[1:11:20] doesn't happen the way I thought it
[1:11:21] should amen but our Focus ought to be
[1:11:24] that we're resting on the word not on
[1:11:26] what we think the word is going to do
[1:11:28] that God does all things well I loved
[1:11:30] how brother Aram brought it out I had
[1:11:31] spoken about it as well he said that one
[1:11:33] of the greatest weapons given to a
[1:11:34] Believer is a committal of the thing to
[1:11:37] God to just say Lord I've done
[1:11:40] everything I
[1:11:41] can and I still don't have it I'm still
[1:11:44] not there the Situation's not worked out
[1:11:46] the money's not in the bank whatever it
[1:11:48] is and say Lord I'm just going to do
[1:11:51] exactly what your word says and trust
[1:11:54] you to sort the whole whole thing out
[1:11:57] amen but I want you to see something
[1:12:00] here as we look at this scripture here
[1:12:01] real quick well we'll stay there because
[1:12:06] in the SP in the parable the ground he
[1:12:08] says is they it's people people are the
[1:12:12] ground and you know as we look at this
[1:12:14] sometimes we can look at it and we can
[1:12:16] make it an absolute and say well brother
[1:12:18] Mark is good ground sister Moren is
[1:12:21] Rocky ground and brother Matt is shallow
[1:12:23] ground and brother Paul is the the
[1:12:27] Wayside but that's not the way that
[1:12:29] Jesus is necessarily talking
[1:12:32] here because we'll look at our lives and
[1:12:35] we'll see all sorts of areas where we
[1:12:37] may have really good
[1:12:39] ground remember you you can only take a
[1:12:41] type so far amen so I'm trying to take
[1:12:44] you here to see the bigger picture here
[1:12:46] amen not everybody that has it has Rocky
[1:12:50] ground is people that are doomed to
[1:12:52] never receive the word that people that
[1:12:54] are never going to have a real walk with
[1:12:56] God Amen people that can't stand up for
[1:12:58] the word will never stand up that's not
[1:12:59] what we're talking about church if we
[1:13:01] look through the Bible there's tons of
[1:13:02] people that looked like they had no good
[1:13:04] ground and all of a sudden they stood on
[1:13:05] the word of God and they they got
[1:13:07] exactly what they were needing Gideon
[1:13:09] was a wimp for the longest while he was
[1:13:11] hiding out threshing grain in the wine
[1:13:13] press because he was
[1:13:15] scared amen you look at Peter Peter deny
[1:13:21] Christ we're not looking for Perfection
[1:13:23] here amen Abraham kept leaving the land
[1:13:26] of promise when things got tough and he
[1:13:28] kept stepping into God's plan and making
[1:13:29] a mess of it I'm not here to say if you
[1:13:32] can't receive it or if you haven't
[1:13:34] received it you'll never receive it I'm
[1:13:35] saying each one of us has places in our
[1:13:37] life without doubt where we've got
[1:13:39] nothing we've got rocky soil we've got
[1:13:41] shallow soil and then we got places with
[1:13:43] good soil and the idea is we've got to
[1:13:46] be able to recognize those things amen
[1:13:48] so where you are today does not is not
[1:13:50] where you have to be tomorrow that's
[1:13:52] what I'm
[1:13:53] saying you don't have to say well this
[1:13:56] is where my life's at and therefore
[1:13:57] that's the way it will always be no the
[1:13:59] point is to prepare the ground so that
[1:14:00] the word can have an effecten I'm
[1:14:02] talking about making our lives a
[1:14:04] welcoming place so that when the word
[1:14:06] lands it produces itself amen that it
[1:14:09] comes forth it develops into maturity so
[1:14:11] that we take away those rocks of
[1:14:13] indifference amen and and we that
[1:14:15] shallow ground of just saying that now I
[1:14:17] lay me down to sleep
[1:14:19] prayers of casual Church
[1:14:22] attendance of putting other things
[1:14:24] before the word of God that's what
[1:14:26] builds up on the ground is the cares of
[1:14:29] life and these different things amen if
[1:14:31] we have a wonderful time at camp but we
[1:14:33] come home to a life that's shallow then
[1:14:35] guess what we're going to lose the
[1:14:37] victory because it's the day to day
[1:14:39] where your Victory is not the moment by-
[1:14:41] moment
[1:14:42] experiences amen the feeling will fall
[1:14:44] away and we're going to be disappointed
[1:14:46] every time that's the way these things
[1:14:48] work but we have to realize we're a work
[1:14:50] in progress and we have areas of our
[1:14:53] life where we are so easily surrendered
[1:14:55] to God and I would say we're
[1:14:58] mature we're in a place where God can
[1:15:00] use us God can move people can stamp all
[1:15:03] over us in that area of our life and we
[1:15:04] just take it and move on no big deal and
[1:15:07] then we've got areas of our life If
[1:15:09] we're honest where we are completely
[1:15:11] like that Wayside where there is no
[1:15:12] depth whatsoever and we need somebody to
[1:15:14] come and till that ground
[1:15:15] up amen we all have areas of strength we
[1:15:18] have areas of weakness we've got doors
[1:15:20] of Our Lives that are If we're honest
[1:15:22] are somewhat closed and doors that are
[1:15:24] wide open in God done a wonderful work
[1:15:25] and everyone can see
[1:15:28] it we've all got these areas in our life
[1:15:31] amen I might have a great prayer life
[1:15:33] and I can connect and get close to God
[1:15:35] but I might be horrible at reading my
[1:15:37] Bible some of us can worship like it's
[1:15:39] nobody's business and then the preaching
[1:15:42] comes and we can't respond to it some of
[1:15:45] us are great
[1:15:47] spouses and horrible
[1:15:49] parents I I'm using contrast here
[1:15:54] usually what we are is we're really good
[1:15:55] and not so good but in a couple areas
[1:15:58] guess what I'm horrible and those are
[1:16:01] the areas where I need him more than
[1:16:03] any and that takes a real a real honesty
[1:16:07] before the preaching of the word of God
[1:16:09] and before the studying of the word of
[1:16:10] God to see those things amen but my
[1:16:13] point is I don't want any of us any of
[1:16:15] you to look at this Parable in their own
[1:16:18] life and say oh my goodness I've got no
[1:16:20] no good ground there and I'm just doomed
[1:16:22] to never have it no that's not what
[1:16:23] we're talking about and then the the
[1:16:25] preacher comes and he brings the word
[1:16:26] and it's anointed and he starts talking
[1:16:28] about those areas of our life where the
[1:16:30] word really isn't having effect and
[1:16:31] we've got to say Lord that's me that's
[1:16:34] me and then now Lord I'm going to
[1:16:36] prepare the ground so that as I've
[1:16:38] received that word I've acknowledged
[1:16:40] it's for me I've acknowledged that I
[1:16:41] need the life that it has now I'm going
[1:16:43] to prepare the ground so that it can
[1:16:45] come out and it can produce the light
[1:16:47] the word in our lives amen we don't want
[1:16:48] to be hearers only we want to be doers
[1:16:51] as well amen the spirit of God ought to
[1:16:53] rise up in us and say hey that's what
[1:16:55] the word says I need to be what the word
[1:16:57] says and it produces something in us
[1:16:59] that calls out and that's that Abba
[1:17:00] Father spirit that says Lord make father
[1:17:03] make me just like you amen make me who
[1:17:05] my real father is and take away all
[1:17:07] these other
[1:17:08] things in Luke 8 he says that which fell
[1:17:10] among the Thorns are they which when
[1:17:13] they have heard go forth and are choked
[1:17:16] with cares and riches and pleasures of
[1:17:18] this life and bring no fruit to what
[1:17:22] perfection
[1:17:25] this is people that will take it
[1:17:28] 90% of the
[1:17:30] way and then Fall by the way
[1:17:33] sign areas of our life where we go
[1:17:35] almost all the way and then something
[1:17:38] will take it and it'll snatch the
[1:17:39] victory right out of our hands now we
[1:17:41] look at that scripture and we when we
[1:17:43] talk about riches and pleasures of life
[1:17:44] we'd say that's a leot toan condition
[1:17:47] that that that's the classic Le Dean
[1:17:49] right there if you go to Revelation 3
[1:17:51] amen and and we we would look at that
[1:17:53] and say well it's talking about people
[1:17:54] people that have it all or people that
[1:17:56] think they have it all but I want you to
[1:17:58] notice it doesn't start with riches and
[1:18:00] Pleasures it says we're choked with
[1:18:02] cares that's the first great issue that
[1:18:06] we face and those cares are
[1:18:10] anxieties and worries and it's exactly
[1:18:13] the word that the scriptures use when it
[1:18:14] says casting all your care on him
[1:18:17] casting all your anxiety casting all
[1:18:19] your worry on him he says for he carth
[1:18:23] for you his careth for you is not
[1:18:25] anxiety and worry his care is a concern
[1:18:28] for our well-being so he says take your
[1:18:30] anxiety take your worries take your
[1:18:33] stresses give them to me and I'll take
[1:18:36] them on and it's a responsibility at he
[1:18:38] shoulders that's the the Key of David on
[1:18:40] his shoulder if you see that in the
[1:18:41] scripture is the responsibility for the
[1:18:44] bride's wellbeing that's his to carry
[1:18:46] church not ours to carry amen he owns
[1:18:48] the cattle on a thousand hills anden we
[1:18:51] don't have to worry about our needs he
[1:18:53] says seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:18:55] I'll add everything else to these things
[1:18:56] to you as you have need of it I say
[1:18:58] praise the Lord to that if I'll give him
[1:19:00] the preeminence he'll take care of my
[1:19:02] cares and I was talking to somebody the
[1:19:04] other day about a situation that I know
[1:19:06] in great detail and I said if that
[1:19:08] person only knew what I know and this is
[1:19:12] a situation where I know exactly what is
[1:19:14] possible not what is possible what would
[1:19:16] happen to that person if they would only
[1:19:18] do what the word said I said they'd stop
[1:19:20] what they're doing today and they'd do
[1:19:21] what the word says and they come right
[1:19:23] into everything they've been missing out
[1:19:27] how sad it is when we let our cares
[1:19:30] drive us away from the things of God
[1:19:32] rather than hand them to him and say
[1:19:34] Lord I'll give you the preeminence in my
[1:19:36] life I'll tell you if we ever see people
[1:19:39] turning a corner church we ought to be
[1:19:40] in there just encouraging them with
[1:19:42] everything we've got we can probably
[1:19:45] look in all of our lives and see areas
[1:19:47] where we could use some help and when
[1:19:48] you see somebody making that corner get
[1:19:50] in there and encourage them really get
[1:19:53] in there and put your shoulder to the
[1:19:54] wheel and get them to turn that corner
[1:19:56] to make that decision or change that
[1:19:58] habit or that issue that they have in
[1:20:00] their life but the thing is this we
[1:20:02] can't convince them
[1:20:04] in that brother that sister I'm talking
[1:20:06] about in that situation I can't go tell
[1:20:09] them that because otherwise they're
[1:20:10] doing it because I told them rather than
[1:20:13] in response to Faith in the word they've
[1:20:15] got to do it by faith in the word
[1:20:16] otherwise somebody will convince them
[1:20:18] right out of it when things change yet
[1:20:19] again because what if they take the word
[1:20:22] in faith and it produces what it says
[1:20:24] they'll make the right decision time and
[1:20:26] time and time again because they've seen
[1:20:28] that it
[1:20:29] works but notice what he says here that
[1:20:31] this this the word comes down and it
[1:20:34] grows until fruit is produced but it
[1:20:36] doesn't come to
[1:20:38] maturity nobody likes to eat fruit that
[1:20:40] fruit that's not ripe you ever bite into
[1:20:43] a an apple or the worst are like
[1:20:45] pears and a a pear that's not ripe it
[1:20:48] might look good on the outside but you
[1:20:50] bite into it it's like eating an apple
[1:20:51] it so hard and there's no sweetness to
[1:20:54] it there's no ju to it he says this is
[1:20:56] what these people are like is the only
[1:20:58] fruit they have is not the way we want
[1:21:00] it or we need it and he says what
[1:21:03] happens they're
[1:21:05] choked and the thing about choking is
[1:21:07] that it's a slow process you go out and
[1:21:10] you pull this plant up now this is a
[1:21:12] this is a dead plant maybe not the best
[1:21:13] example it's fake but if I want to kill
[1:21:16] this plant I just have to pull it
[1:21:18] out and it's as good as dead right then
[1:21:21] because it has no nutrition it can't
[1:21:23] drink water and I just throw it in the
[1:21:25] garbage that thing is dead but choking
[1:21:28] takes time it's a slow process and when
[1:21:31] it comes to plants it's Progressive
[1:21:32] because it starts as almost nothing
[1:21:35] because that plant is growing but what
[1:21:37] happens now is a thorn comes in beside
[1:21:39] it and it starts to pull the nutrients
[1:21:42] away it starts to pull the blessings
[1:21:43] away it starts to pull pull away the
[1:21:46] resources that it needs to grow and at
[1:21:48] first The Thorn is just growing a little
[1:21:50] bit and the tree or the the plant is
[1:21:52] saying well that's no big deal but as
[1:21:54] that thorn takes more and more and it
[1:21:57] gets bigger and bigger it starts to suck
[1:22:00] every little bit of what is needed for
[1:22:02] the other plant the good plant to grow
[1:22:04] and so what happens is the plant comes
[1:22:06] up and it's so close and then it's
[1:22:08] stunted and it can't go any further and
[1:22:10] then it starts to
[1:22:12] backtrack and so choking is just the
[1:22:15] slow process of
[1:22:17] backsliding you know what choking is
[1:22:19] it's backsliding with good
[1:22:21] intentions but not feeding your life not
[1:22:24] feeding your Christian
[1:22:27] walk you know we had that service a
[1:22:29] couple years ago when that when that
[1:22:30] couple from Ontario came brother
[1:22:34] Michael and we preached on that idea
[1:22:37] that if you come to church to get a step
[1:22:39] forward you've got to keep making steps
[1:22:42] forward because otherwise every day
[1:22:43] you'll take a step back you come to
[1:22:46] church and let's say you get two steps
[1:22:47] forward you come to church on a Sunday
[1:22:48] you get two steps forward you make some
[1:22:50] real progress but if you don't make
[1:22:52] progress on Monday what happens you go
[1:22:53] back a step the prophet of God said if
[1:22:55] you're not moving forward you're
[1:22:56] backsliding so if you take those two
[1:22:58] steps but you don't make any more
[1:23:00] progress really what you're doing is on
[1:23:02] the Monday you step back once Tuesday
[1:23:04] you step back again well Wednesday you
[1:23:06] come back and you take two steps forward
[1:23:07] and guess where you are right where you
[1:23:09] were on Sunday you have made no progress
[1:23:12] so you're backsliding then what happens
[1:23:14] is we go Thursday Friday
[1:23:18] Saturday and then we come up and we take
[1:23:20] two steps on Sunday and where are we if
[1:23:22] you've done the math we're now one step
[1:23:23] behind where we were or the week
[1:23:27] before your growth cannot be only in the
[1:23:30] services you can't do it it will not
[1:23:33] work Church it doesn't work I've seen it
[1:23:36] I've experienced it you cannot do those
[1:23:38] sorts of things amen you know what
[1:23:40] happens we become Camp
[1:23:42] Overcomers that's all we are and all
[1:23:44] we're doing is brother oh I love that
[1:23:46] phrase he said this weekend he called us
[1:23:48] message leod
[1:23:49] Deans right we think we've got it
[1:23:52] because we believe it and yet we're
[1:23:53] slowly going backwards little bit by
[1:23:56] little bit message lay it a scene is a
[1:23:59] contradiction of terms backsliding
[1:24:01] Christian that's a contradiction of
[1:24:03] terms the person being choked doesn't
[1:24:06] die right away but they just slowly go
[1:24:09] back and it's just one step a week one
[1:24:11] step a week but guess what God's moving
[1:24:13] on with his word God's moving on with
[1:24:15] his bride and pretty soon you can't
[1:24:17] connect with the people you can't
[1:24:19] connect with what's coming over the
[1:24:21] pulpit you can't connect in the worship
[1:24:22] I was talking to some people and I'm
[1:24:24] saying this because I've been there you
[1:24:25] can get so distance from God that you
[1:24:28] get you get uncomfortable under the
[1:24:31] anointing of the Holy
[1:24:33] Ghost that when people are worshiping
[1:24:36] when people are praising when the word's
[1:24:37] going forth you are uncomfortable
[1:24:39] because you are so far away from the
[1:24:41] presence of
[1:24:44] God what is it you've been choked out
[1:24:47] and you're in a backslidden condition
[1:24:48] even though you know
[1:24:50] everything and we don't realize it
[1:24:54] you don't like the effect of the word
[1:24:56] you don't like your toes being stepped
[1:24:57] on you don't like being called up higher
[1:24:58] you want to stay where you are and to
[1:25:00] stay where you are is always death for
[1:25:02] the Christian walk we've got to keep
[1:25:04] moving forward and then we come to
[1:25:05] church he says we're choked out by the
[1:25:07] cares of Life what happens is we give
[1:25:09] everything we've got to our day today
[1:25:12] and then we come to church and we have
[1:25:13] nothing left to give and guess what if
[1:25:15] you got nothing to give if you've got
[1:25:17] nothing to give then you've got nothing
[1:25:18] to get you got no space left in your
[1:25:20] life you've given every aspect of what
[1:25:22] you've got in your life to your your
[1:25:24] dayto day and we come into church and
[1:25:26] then we're surprised we don't get
[1:25:27] anything again I've been there I'm
[1:25:30] speaking by experience I'm not preaching
[1:25:32] at you I'm saying this is the way it
[1:25:33] goes amen we give our energy our time
[1:25:35] our mind our strength to the cares of
[1:25:37] life and then we come to hear the word
[1:25:39] and we're so tired and beat out that we
[1:25:40] can't get anything out of it anybody
[1:25:42] ever don't raise your hands anybody ever
[1:25:45] go to bed and you've intended to pray
[1:25:47] and read your Bible and you look at the
[1:25:49] words and they just seem to just flow
[1:25:51] one into another and you just you're not
[1:25:53] getting anything out of it
[1:25:56] and then you go to pray and you might
[1:25:58] get nine words out before you're
[1:26:02] out that's not going to be an overcomer
[1:26:05] life and when we give so much to the
[1:26:07] dayto day and we leave nothing for
[1:26:09] Christ what happens we get choked
[1:26:13] out and This
[1:26:15] World brother Eugene BR I remember he
[1:26:18] says he says the devil's done a real
[1:26:19] good job of making us make bricks
[1:26:21] without
[1:26:22] straw you Brothers
[1:26:25] so many of us are on single incomes here
[1:26:28] we have to work and we've got to work
[1:26:31] and we've got to work but guess what our
[1:26:34] provision is not in our working our
[1:26:36] provision is in the god of our souls and
[1:26:39] our Salvation amen that's the rest that
[1:26:42] I have is that he said I'll take care of
[1:26:44] you he said if I would do what he wanted
[1:26:47] he'll pour out a blessing that I can
[1:26:49] contain my needs will be supplied I may
[1:26:53] not have a lot but my need needs will be
[1:26:54] supplied and I'll tell you in the end I
[1:26:56] was I was listening to what brother B
[1:26:58] was talking about he said you know if I
[1:26:59] had $100 million here he says what would
[1:27:02] I pay what would I buy with that $100
[1:27:05] million he said I'd like to meet see my
[1:27:07] dad again I'd like to see this one he
[1:27:09] said I'd like to see another Soul saved
[1:27:11] he says what does that tell us about
[1:27:12] what that money is really
[1:27:14] worth if all it takes us back to is the
[1:27:16] Salvation or the Eternal destination of
[1:27:19] another person that we
[1:27:20] love
[1:27:23] amen we can get so caught up in what we
[1:27:25] have to have that we forget there's only
[1:27:28] one Pearl a great price and that's
[1:27:30] Christ himself
[1:27:32] Amen brother Bram says
[1:27:35] this he he's praying he says oh Eternal
[1:27:38] God in the quietness of this worship now
[1:27:41] after the message has gone forth do not
[1:27:43] let these seeds of Thy word Lord fall
[1:27:45] upon Stony ground do not let the message
[1:27:48] Lord fall in briers and Thorns that the
[1:27:51] cares of this life and he says like lot
[1:27:54] might choke it out at the end and become
[1:27:56] a Castaway he says but oh blessed God
[1:27:58] let it fall on good fertile grounds on
[1:28:01] penitent hearts and I M also Lord that
[1:28:04] we might all look through God's glass of
[1:28:06] looking and see the rejected Church of
[1:28:08] the Lord Jesus the rejected people the
[1:28:11] rejected way and then he says and may we
[1:28:14] walk in this glorious way the rejected
[1:28:19] way the harder way because you have
[1:28:21] chosen the harder way amen he says this
[1:28:25] is he says it's like lot what was lot's
[1:28:28] problem church he saw the well-watered
[1:28:30] plains of Sodom having walk through the
[1:28:32] desert for way too long and he saw all
[1:28:35] the struggles and he saw all the trials
[1:28:37] of doing things the way God told you to
[1:28:38] do it and he came out and he says that
[1:28:41] place is going to make it really easy to
[1:28:44] get and hold on to
[1:28:46] wealth and he made that
[1:28:48] choice and you know what his choice was
[1:28:51] limited and Abraham comes out and God
[1:28:53] comes to abrah he says look around he
[1:28:55] says everything you see here belongs to
[1:28:59] you every bit of it belongs to you lot
[1:29:02] missed out because he went the easy way
[1:29:04] rather than the word way amen the desert
[1:29:08] was a whole lot more work for
[1:29:10] him it's a lot harder to feed sheep and
[1:29:12] goats and cattle in the desert but he
[1:29:14] looks down at sodom's wellwater Plains
[1:29:16] and he doesn't have to go very far to
[1:29:18] hold on to everything that he's ever
[1:29:19] built up amen he saw the opportunities
[1:29:23] he saw the comforts
[1:29:24] of Sodom he saw the conditions of the
[1:29:27] environment there and he says I can do
[1:29:28] that and he loved Easy Living more than
[1:29:30] the word of God he loved the
[1:29:32] opportunities more than the word of God
[1:29:34] and the scripture you remember it says
[1:29:36] it vexed lot's righteous soul to be in
[1:29:39] Sodom and yet he could never
[1:29:42] leave as much as he hated where he was
[1:29:46] yet the draw what happened it choked out
[1:29:49] his desire to be separate until he got
[1:29:52] to the place where he became a big shot
[1:29:53] in the city of of Sodom and he sat in
[1:29:55] the city gate and he actually entered
[1:29:57] into the very system that vexed his soul
[1:29:59] and he served the citizens of that
[1:30:01] City it got to the place he couldn't get
[1:30:04] himself out and it took an Angelic
[1:30:06] visitation for him to even save his life
[1:30:10] and those of his two daughters but who
[1:30:11] paid the price his wife had gone too
[1:30:14] far and even though an angel told her
[1:30:17] don't look back she couldn't take the
[1:30:20] word serious and she turned back
[1:30:22] thinking it wouldn't do anything to her
[1:30:24] and she died and was turned into a
[1:30:26] pillar of salt right then and
[1:30:28] there church it gets serious when we get
[1:30:32] to the place where we say the word
[1:30:34] doesn't
[1:30:35] matter we'll never say it but our life
[1:30:38] will say it
[1:30:41] amen you say brother John are you saying
[1:30:43] this this has seemed a little hard
[1:30:44] tonight we're getting to the good part
[1:30:46] but we've got to see the traps and the
[1:30:48] pitfalls so that we can be the good part
[1:30:51] amen we've got to be where we want to be
[1:30:53] amen I'm helping saying this to
[1:30:54] hopefully help you hold on to what
[1:30:56] you've gotten over this weekend that you
[1:30:58] can keep your Victory so you can grow in
[1:31:00] God so you can experience more of him
[1:31:02] and not just at church not just at camp
[1:31:04] but in your daytoday life amen that it's
[1:31:08] not just a a camp we're not just Camp
[1:31:10] Christians or Camp Overcomers but we've
[1:31:12] got a day-by-day experience that feeds
[1:31:14] us into the word and its effects amen
[1:31:18] now we get to the good
[1:31:20] part he says but that on the good ground
[1:31:23] are they which in an honest and good
[1:31:26] heart
[1:31:29] honesty sometimes that means we aren't
[1:31:31] as good as we think we
[1:31:32] are sometimes it means we have to say I
[1:31:35] need more or I don't have or I'm in lack
[1:31:39] the good ground is not a life that's
[1:31:41] perfect it's a life that is ready to
[1:31:44] receive amen he says having heard the
[1:31:47] word they keep it and bring forth fruit
[1:31:51] with what patience
[1:31:55] patience is the trial of our faith
[1:31:57] remember the time between the promise
[1:31:59] and the Harvest that's the trial of our
[1:32:01] faith there's a time of waiting and
[1:32:04] remember now this is where we wanted to
[1:32:05] get tonight there was always an Abraham
[1:32:08] in contrast to lot remember this is a
[1:32:10] law of contrast we've got lot in there
[1:32:12] and he's getting choked out by the cares
[1:32:14] and the riches of this world and Abraham
[1:32:16] is outside of Sodom completely separate
[1:32:20] Abraham's not perfect but he's in a
[1:32:22] place where God can meet him amen that's
[1:32:26] what matters you're in a place where God
[1:32:28] can meet him that's what good ground is
[1:32:30] is a place where God can meet you a
[1:32:32] place where God can plant the word and
[1:32:34] it's clearing out all the obstacles and
[1:32:36] all the things that build up and all of
[1:32:38] the things that hold us back and
[1:32:40] throwing it aside and saying Lord I'm
[1:32:41] ready to meet you I'm ready to receive
[1:32:44] the promise we're speaking on good
[1:32:46] ground tonight and I'm not saying you
[1:32:47] have to have a perfect life I'm saying
[1:32:49] the good ground is people that have
[1:32:51] cleared out and prepared their lives for
[1:32:54] the word of God we get to choose that
[1:32:57] that's our day today you know I just for
[1:32:58] the sake of time I didn't put it in my
[1:33:00] notes brother B remember he talks about
[1:33:02] that Lake that was going through a storm
[1:33:04] and it was all whipped up and he said
[1:33:06] that lake is going through a
[1:33:09] Revival and the guy looked at him a
[1:33:11] Revival he says yeah he says do you
[1:33:13] notice what a Revival is and what it
[1:33:15] does he says what a Revival does is it
[1:33:18] clears out all the
[1:33:20] trash he says but there's not a little
[1:33:22] there's not even a little bit more rain
[1:33:24] and water in that Lake than there was
[1:33:26] before that came he says and what does
[1:33:29] it takes it takes a Pentecostal wind it
[1:33:31] takes a moving of the spirit it takes
[1:33:33] the word coming forth and stirring up
[1:33:35] what's there to get the trash out and
[1:33:38] clean the water up he says and that's
[1:33:39] what a Revival is you don't have any
[1:33:41] more than what you had before but what
[1:33:43] does it do it brings to life that which
[1:33:45] was already there there seeds planted
[1:33:47] we've got the Eternal SE Gene of God in
[1:33:49] our hearts but it takes a Revival
[1:33:51] sometimes to bring those things out and
[1:33:53] get all of that stuff out of our
[1:33:55] Lives brother Brown puts it this way he
[1:33:57] says any
[1:33:59] seed has to have its ground of course
[1:34:03] now he takes us back to scripture
[1:34:04] therefore all he fornew he did
[1:34:06] predestinate them he did predestinate he
[1:34:08] justified Sanctified glorified we've
[1:34:09] read this in many services he says see
[1:34:12] he already knew what was going to happen
[1:34:15] see Jesus said again about the seed some
[1:34:18] fell on rocks others in mixed grounds
[1:34:21] see over where there's Thorns thistles
[1:34:22] and everything else it couldn't grow he
[1:34:24] says but and others on good ground good
[1:34:28] ground good soil which have been already
[1:34:32] prepared Hallelujah Church what I'm
[1:34:34] saying is when the word comes forth he's
[1:34:36] not sewing it for the Thorns he's not
[1:34:38] sewing it for the thistles he's not
[1:34:40] sewing it for the rocky ground he's not
[1:34:41] swing it for the shallow ground but he's
[1:34:43] sowing it because he knows there's good
[1:34:45] ground to receive it amen we don't have
[1:34:47] services like we have because we don't
[1:34:49] have good ground we receive services
[1:34:51] like that because there is good ground
[1:34:53] there's a people that's there to receive
[1:34:55] that word and it's going to come forth
[1:34:57] and it's going to produce what he
[1:34:58] promised amen that's what I wanted to
[1:35:00] get to you tonight we have those
[1:35:02] Services because there's good ground but
[1:35:04] let's also see if we've got some places
[1:35:06] where the ground wasn't quite ready and
[1:35:08] we backed
[1:35:10] away but he's always got a place
[1:35:12] prepared remember he says when I send my
[1:35:14] word out it can't come back to me void
[1:35:16] there's always a place for the seed of
[1:35:18] the word to produce what it says it's
[1:35:20] going to do amen he knows Above All
[1:35:22] Things there's always good ground to
[1:35:24] receive it it's like the scripture talks
[1:35:27] about the parable he says it's like the
[1:35:28] the net that's cast out and and it's the
[1:35:31] gospel it brings out a lot of fishes but
[1:35:33] there's only one fish in there that they
[1:35:34] want and the rest get thrown away and
[1:35:37] that's the way the gospel goes there's
[1:35:38] always a witness we read before that God
[1:35:40] always has somebody that's going to
[1:35:42] receive it amen God didn't send it
[1:35:45] because no one would receive it God sent
[1:35:46] it so that some because he knew somebody
[1:35:49] would receive it amen God sent it
[1:35:50] because people were ready people were
[1:35:52] prayed up people were were willing
[1:35:54] people were anticipating people had set
[1:35:56] their lives aside to say God come down
[1:35:58] and preach to us come down and teach us
[1:36:00] come down and help us come down and
[1:36:01] Deliver us that's why these things
[1:36:04] happen amen God always has good ground
[1:36:06] available amen and that's why he's
[1:36:08] sewing is solely for the good ground
[1:36:11] church you enjoyed it because you had
[1:36:13] good ground you received it because you
[1:36:15] have good ground you received it because
[1:36:17] your heart was open you received it
[1:36:19] because you were sincere in your prayers
[1:36:20] you received it because you had put the
[1:36:22] time in beforehand to prepare your
[1:36:24] hearts and your lives for it amen and
[1:36:26] let me help the rest of us out you
[1:36:28] didn't get it because you were so good
[1:36:30] you got it because he ordained you to
[1:36:31] get it Hallelujah that even when I'm not
[1:36:34] ready he comes by in His Marvelous Grace
[1:36:36] and he says Hey here I
[1:36:39] am and by God's grace I'm able to open
[1:36:42] up and I'm able to receive that word
[1:36:44] even if I haven't maybe done the job
[1:36:46] that I thought I should have done listen
[1:36:48] Rahab didn't know she was good ground
[1:36:49] until the word came her way the woman at
[1:36:52] the well didn't look like a piece of
[1:36:54] good ground to the rest of us but when
[1:36:55] the word in flesh came her way she
[1:36:57] realized guess what I can receive this
[1:36:59] and it produced an immediate result in
[1:37:01] her life and it stuck and I believe she
[1:37:04] was one of the ones that got the Holy
[1:37:05] Ghost in Samaria when Peter and John
[1:37:07] came over not too many days
[1:37:09] later amen he sends it because there's a
[1:37:12] people that's willing to receive it the
[1:37:14] disciples were nobody they were ignorant
[1:37:16] they were unlearned they weren't chosen
[1:37:17] by the other rabbis and teachers and
[1:37:19] looking at them we'd say that's not good
[1:37:21] ground but God knows his own and the
[1:37:23] word comes to the word amen praise the
[1:37:26] Lord what makes that ground good or what
[1:37:28] makes it shallow Church there's only one
[1:37:31] thing makes good ground and that's
[1:37:32] surrender to the word of God that is the
[1:37:35] only thing that'll do it Doctrine
[1:37:37] doesn't make it
[1:37:38] good surrender makes it good because
[1:37:42] surrender gets all the rocks out it gets
[1:37:45] all the sticky things out it gets the
[1:37:47] things that hold us back those things
[1:37:49] that hinder our walk with Christ it's
[1:37:50] the little SP foxes that are spoiling
[1:37:52] The Vines it's that surrender that says
[1:37:54] Lord I'm going to take those and I'm
[1:37:55] going to lay them aside because I
[1:37:57] believe what you have for me is way
[1:37:58] better than what I get out of those
[1:37:59] different things that's the only way the
[1:38:02] word can be effective is if it has full
[1:38:04] and Total Control in the ground
[1:38:08] otherwise things will come
[1:38:09] in it has to be sowed in faith it has to
[1:38:12] be received in faith it has to have
[1:38:14] faith in patience and then you get to
[1:38:17] harvest it in faith amen faith is a
[1:38:19] revelation that the word of God is true
[1:38:21] for me your faith is a revelation that
[1:38:24] the word of God is true for you and
[1:38:26] that's how we receive it that's how we
[1:38:27] get our lives cleaned up and that's how
[1:38:29] we can commit our situations our
[1:38:31] finances our jobs our spouses our
[1:38:33] families our ministry whatever it is to
[1:38:34] God and say God I'm just going to let it
[1:38:36] come forth in my life brother B puts it
[1:38:38] this way he says see you must first let
[1:38:41] the word fall in the right type of faith
[1:38:43] and then that Faith produces what the
[1:38:45] word said because the word is a seed the
[1:38:48] word of God right here is a seed that a
[1:38:50] swer SWS and every seed will produce
[1:38:53] produce its kind
[1:38:55] period no he says every seed will
[1:38:59] produce its kind if it's put in the
[1:39:01] right
[1:39:02] atmosphere and the right
[1:39:07] condition church can I get to what I'm
[1:39:09] trying to get
[1:39:11] at when you have meetings like we have
[1:39:13] so many times you know what it is it's
[1:39:16] actually a
[1:39:17] planting it's a planting it's a start
[1:39:21] it's a new portion of the word coming
[1:39:23] out in your life and it has all the
[1:39:25] feelings that come with
[1:39:28] planting you know it takes a certain
[1:39:30] atmosphere to conceive
[1:39:32] life doesn't it it takes a different
[1:39:35] atmosphere to produce that life into a
[1:39:38] baby and then it takes another different
[1:39:40] atmosphere to keep that baby alive and
[1:39:42] grow it into maturity and it's no
[1:39:44] different with the word of God it takes
[1:39:46] an atmosphere to plant it to get it to
[1:39:48] start growing to Quicken it to make it
[1:39:50] burst forth but it takes a continuation
[1:39:53] of the right environment for that word
[1:39:55] to now come forth in our lives in other
[1:39:58] words you have to feed your experience
[1:40:02] you have to feed that plant you know we
[1:40:04] so many of us I think in in elementary
[1:40:06] school we all given a little what was it
[1:40:08] a bean I think it was a bean wasn't it
[1:40:11] just a little
[1:40:13] bean and every one of us we had to take
[1:40:15] it and the first thing we did was we put
[1:40:17] it in a damp uh paper towel and every
[1:40:21] day we go and we just put a bit of water
[1:40:22] on that b damp paper towel and pretty
[1:40:25] soon we lay it in the window so that it
[1:40:26] had the the heat in the
[1:40:28] sun then after a while we'd look
[1:40:30] underneath it what would we see we'd see
[1:40:32] that that little bean had Little Sprouts
[1:40:33] coming out of it little roots and it was
[1:40:36] starting to rot and then we take it and
[1:40:38] we put it into what we transplant it now
[1:40:41] it just needed the watering of the word
[1:40:43] at first but now it needs more it needs
[1:40:45] soil it needs nutrition it needs all
[1:40:47] these other things and so we put it in
[1:40:48] there and for a while we wouldn't see
[1:40:50] anything but then after a while some
[1:40:53] come in they say hey mine's come up
[1:40:54] through the
[1:40:55] dirt and everything we' done to that
[1:40:57] point with no evidence that it was
[1:40:59] continuing to grow yet all of a sudden
[1:41:00] it popped up and we were always so
[1:41:02] envious of that person that got the the
[1:41:03] bean that came through first but guess
[1:41:06] what that wasn't the Harvest that was
[1:41:08] just hey it's
[1:41:10] working and we never unfortunately got
[1:41:12] to take it all the way to a bean Harvest
[1:41:13] but if you were growing beans then you'd
[1:41:15] let that whole thing grow until you
[1:41:16] produced beans and you'd you you'd
[1:41:19] manage the conditions you'd manage the
[1:41:21] environment and that's what we have to
[1:41:23] do with these things amen it the the the
[1:41:25] planting is where all the good feelings
[1:41:28] are but the producing life is where the
[1:41:31] real hard work starts setting the
[1:41:33] atmosphere setting the conditions amen
[1:41:35] and it's a whole different work the fun
[1:41:38] is always at the beginning and the work
[1:41:39] comes after that we'll find out so you
[1:41:41] have to have the right atmosphere you
[1:41:43] have to have the right conditions for
[1:41:44] growth of what was
[1:41:46] planted yes it has to be good ground but
[1:41:48] that good ground needs to be inside of a
[1:41:51] good environment you've got to water it
[1:41:52] with the word of God
[1:41:54] you can't get away from that you've got
[1:41:55] to warm it with the presence of God
[1:41:57] you've got to feed it with praise and
[1:41:59] worship and prayer you've got to
[1:42:00] encourage it with thoughts that are in
[1:42:02] line with the word of God Amen you've
[1:42:05] got to protect it from weeds and Thorns
[1:42:08] you know scripture says if anything
[1:42:09] offend your eye pluck it if if your eye
[1:42:11] offend the pluck it
[1:42:12] out in other words if you've got
[1:42:15] something and sometimes again I speak
[1:42:18] this by experience we'll go around and
[1:42:21] around the mountain right we think we
[1:42:22] got the victory in the and we don't we
[1:42:23] think we got the Victory and we don't
[1:42:24] and what happens is we're not realizing
[1:42:26] there's something there that we're not
[1:42:28] we're not
[1:42:28] addressing and that's the Thorns that's
[1:42:31] the Briars that catch on to these things
[1:42:32] and so what we've got to do is we've got
[1:42:34] to see what's hindering us now what was
[1:42:37] it that's hindered me before so many
[1:42:40] times we will go in and we want a
[1:42:41] victory and then we come out and we
[1:42:43] haven't addressed the thing that was
[1:42:44] causing us to have defeat in the first
[1:42:45] place you've got to address the thing
[1:42:48] that's defeating you so that the victory
[1:42:49] can come forth and produce full maturity
[1:42:51] so it can be the real deal in your life
[1:42:53] you got to go strengthen yourself in
[1:42:55] other words this is my go-to scripture
[1:42:57] after camps I think I do it every year
[1:42:59] but if we go to the book of First Kings
[1:43:01] 20 amen because Satan's going to
[1:43:04] come if he hasn't already he's coming
[1:43:07] you can't have a weekend like we had and
[1:43:09] Satan take it lying down he's going to
[1:43:11] be coming for each and every one of us
[1:43:13] to take our peace to take our joy to
[1:43:15] take our Victory to try and kill kill
[1:43:17] that experience before it comes into a
[1:43:18] fullness of in our life but remember
[1:43:21] what happened here in First Kings 20 it
[1:43:22] says says the king of Israel went out
[1:43:24] and smokee the horses and chariots and
[1:43:26] slew the syrians with a great Slaughter
[1:43:28] in other words they had a camp meeting
[1:43:30] and they had worship and praise and they
[1:43:32] had Victory and they had shouting they
[1:43:33] had dancing and everyone was clapping
[1:43:35] their hands and it was a wonderful time
[1:43:37] in the Lord but Watch What Happens and
[1:43:41] the prophet came to the king of Israel
[1:43:42] and said unto him you got
[1:43:46] it no he said go strengthen thyself and
[1:43:50] Mark and see what thou doest for at the
[1:43:53] return of the year the king of Syria
[1:43:55] will come up against thee in other words
[1:43:57] he says yes you've won but he's coming
[1:43:59] again and you've got to get ready for
[1:44:01] the next attack you've got the victory
[1:44:04] but he ain't dead yet Satan ain't dead
[1:44:07] yet Church we're not going to have a
[1:44:09] total victory until we get out of here
[1:44:11] and that means we're going to battle
[1:44:13] every single day of our life until we go
[1:44:15] into a resurrection or a
[1:44:16] Rapture but I want you to see what that
[1:44:19] that underlined portion of the Amplified
[1:44:21] in the Amplified says go fortify
[1:44:24] yourself and become strong and give
[1:44:28] attention to what you must do so if they
[1:44:30] went out and they fought maybe they lost
[1:44:33] men they've got to recruit and train
[1:44:34] more men maybe they lost weapons maybe
[1:44:37] they they lost horses maybe they they
[1:44:39] had areas of their their army that got
[1:44:41] destroyed in part he says you got to go
[1:44:43] back and rebuild you got to prepare
[1:44:45] because he's going to come back again
[1:44:47] and you've got to be ready for
[1:44:49] it Satan's not going to leave you alone
[1:44:54] but B puts it this way he says you take
[1:44:55] good grains and put it in good ground on
[1:44:57] the right condition it'll bring forth a
[1:44:59] h hundredfold so is the word of God when
[1:45:02] it's brought into the human heart with a
[1:45:04] faith undying faith in the Lord Jesus
[1:45:07] Christ he says with the Holy Spirit and
[1:45:10] the power of God there to water it it'll
[1:45:12] germatize
[1:45:13] that's what's happened for many of us
[1:45:17] some of us got a harvest this
[1:45:18] weekend but I think many of us also just
[1:45:21] got a planting and I don't say just a
[1:45:23] planting I mean you got a planting
[1:45:25] there's nothing small about it it's a
[1:45:26] wonderful thing amen but he says now you
[1:45:29] need the Holy Spirit the power of God
[1:45:31] there to do what to water it so it'll
[1:45:33] germatize and bring forth everything it
[1:45:36] said it would do he says it's a word
[1:45:39] it's God's word now I'm a broken record
[1:45:42] on this but the prophet of God would say
[1:45:44] you want to get close to God what do you
[1:45:49] do go ahead sister Justine
[1:45:53] read your Bible and
[1:45:56] pray you don't do it you ain't going to
[1:46:00] win you may not have to listen you don't
[1:46:02] have to read your Bible brother Chad you
[1:46:05] can listen to your Bible you can listen
[1:46:07] to preaching you can listen to messages
[1:46:08] you don't have to read it you can listen
[1:46:10] to it but somehow someway you've got to
[1:46:12] get a delivery system so the word can
[1:46:14] come into this body and we can't sit
[1:46:17] here on our excuses of we don't have
[1:46:19] time we don't have energy listen
[1:46:25] if we don't have time for that we're not
[1:46:27] going to have time for a
[1:46:28] Rapture it's a simple truth you can pick
[1:46:31] them now or you can pick them later and
[1:46:34] listen I don't want to go to the white
[1:46:35] Throne judgment I'd rather get the
[1:46:37] victory now I'd rather set these things
[1:46:39] aside now and take the pain that maybe
[1:46:41] comes with choosing God over those other
[1:46:43] things because it's going to have an
[1:46:44] eternal effect on me rather than just a
[1:46:47] temporary pain in the of these things
[1:46:49] that we see amen this is about communion
[1:46:51] with God it's about raising up the
[1:46:53] standard of the Holy Spirit saying I
[1:46:55] need to do
[1:46:56] more we're not here for
[1:46:59] performance but for goodness sake we've
[1:47:01] got to be able to water that experience
[1:47:02] with the word of God we've got to be
[1:47:04] able to get in his presence so that the
[1:47:05] warmth of his presence draws the life
[1:47:08] out amen it's about feeding the
[1:47:11] experience so that the experience
[1:47:13] becomes a reality so that sticks around
[1:47:16] remember what those those ones that were
[1:47:17] choked out the fruit came but it
[1:47:19] couldn't come to Perfection amen I want
[1:47:21] to come to Perfection I want to come to
[1:47:23] maturity this evening amen we don't want
[1:47:24] to
[1:47:25] presume we don't ever want to
[1:47:28] presume brother Braham says this let's
[1:47:31] be the hund folds you know it says some
[1:47:34] produce 30 some produce
[1:47:37] 60 and some produced a hundredfold he
[1:47:40] says let's be the hund folds let's go
[1:47:43] way
[1:47:46] over that's what passion does that's
[1:47:49] what Fanatics do we're supposed to be
[1:47:51] Fanatics for the word of of God it's
[1:47:54] amazing anytime I've been at a sporting
[1:47:56] event the Fanatics you see yeah I
[1:47:59] remember seeing the Oilers going to the
[1:48:00] Oilers hockey game and you have o i l e
[1:48:04] r s you have six chubby hairy men with
[1:48:08] no shirts on with an O an i an L an e an
[1:48:12] r and an S and they've got their faces
[1:48:14] painted and they've got hockey helmets
[1:48:18] on brother B saying let's go way over
[1:48:22] let's be that kind of crazy for the
[1:48:23] things of God you you sing that song I
[1:48:27] am a c I am a c I am a c r i i
[1:48:32] n we need to be a
[1:48:35] fanatic we need to be fanatical about
[1:48:38] the things of God that's where we need
[1:48:40] to be fanatical amen you
[1:48:43] know if if if an Oilers if that man
[1:48:46] walked in from that Oilers game into our
[1:48:48] church you know what he'd say you guys
[1:48:50] are Jesus fans
[1:48:53] that's what he'd say isn't it he'd see
[1:48:56] brother Chad yelling he'd say now that
[1:48:59] guy he's a fanatic he'd see brother
[1:49:01] Grant there with his arms up shouting
[1:49:03] he'd say That's my kind of
[1:49:06] fanatic he'd see sister shaking their
[1:49:09] hands and praising the Lord he'd say
[1:49:10] That's my kind of fanatic hey how about
[1:49:12] you guys come to the Oilers game with
[1:49:17] me but the thing is in the moment
[1:49:19] everybody's a fanatic but you'll find
[1:49:21] with the Oilers Lots lot of people have
[1:49:23] fallen away why because they don't win
[1:49:26] they can't win but these guys are die
[1:49:29] hards that's what Christ is looking for
[1:49:32] die hards they have sold out to the
[1:49:36] things of God he says let's go way over
[1:49:39] sell out everything from the world and
[1:49:41] look to Christ and believe him with all
[1:49:44] our hearts he says that's how these
[1:49:49] things
[1:49:50] happen brother Aaron talked about a
[1:49:52] total Victory you know what that
[1:49:55] requires Church a total
[1:49:59] sellout he says that's how Visions come
[1:50:02] that's how the power of God moves among
[1:50:04] us no roots of bitterness everything's
[1:50:06] cleared out cleaned out and the Holy
[1:50:09] Spirit can work through us he says then
[1:50:11] we become a channel let me finish with
[1:50:15] one scripture and a set of quotes here
[1:50:16] this
[1:50:17] evening you want to set the right
[1:50:19] atmosphere how many want the right
[1:50:21] atmosphere in their life
[1:50:23] most of
[1:50:28] us you want to set the right
[1:50:30] atmosphere guard your
[1:50:34] thoughts remember we preached on this
[1:50:36] now we know it the battle is right here
[1:50:40] the atmosphere is set right here whoever
[1:50:43] wins here sets the atmosphere amen so
[1:50:46] you've got to guard your thoughts you
[1:50:47] got to guard what's what you're dwelling
[1:50:50] on and then the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:50:52] doesn't have a negative thought as it
[1:50:54] relates to the word amen so that means
[1:50:57] get ready for the negative thoughts get
[1:50:59] ready for the unbelieving thoughts get
[1:51:00] ready for the critical thoughts get
[1:51:02] ready for the worrisome thoughts get
[1:51:03] ready for the unsure thoughts and when
[1:51:05] they do say Satan you're
[1:51:12] identified I loved what brother Aaron
[1:51:14] said he says Satan always lies and yet
[1:51:16] we keep listening to
[1:51:18] him and let me say this church if it's
[1:51:20] contrary to this word there's only one
[1:51:23] influence behind it and it's satanic
[1:51:26] amen we ought to know when it hits us
[1:51:29] but you know when it hits us
[1:51:31] church when the feeling's gone isn't it
[1:51:35] when the feeling of Victory when the
[1:51:36] feeling of healing when the feeling of
[1:51:38] Deliverance when the feeling of knowing
[1:51:39] you're saved is gone that's when it hits
[1:51:41] us and that's when we're at our weakest
[1:51:44] guard your thoughts you know the
[1:51:47] scripture I'm going to go to but I'm
[1:51:48] going to read it anyways as we start to
[1:51:50] close Paul said finally brethren
[1:51:53] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[1:51:57] things are honest whatsoever things are
[1:51:59] just whatsoever things are pure
[1:52:01] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[1:52:03] things are of good report if there be
[1:52:05] any virtue he says if there's any
[1:52:06] strength if there be any praise he says
[1:52:08] Get It by thinking on these things
[1:52:11] church let me say this I found the
[1:52:13] easiest way to get out of my head is to
[1:52:16] let the word of God flow over
[1:52:18] it and if I can't read and I can't
[1:52:21] listen to it put a song on put some good
[1:52:24] music on put a service on if I can't get
[1:52:26] there myself then put on something
[1:52:29] that'll take me into that listen
[1:52:31] anointed singing took Saul out from
[1:52:34] under the influence of an evil
[1:52:36] spirit if it can do that temporarily for
[1:52:38] a son for for a son that's lost the
[1:52:41] anointing then what ought it to do to
[1:52:42] Holy Ghost filled children of God Amen
[1:52:44] set yourself up if you know that you're
[1:52:47] prone to thinking negatively if you know
[1:52:49] that you're prone to to losing That
[1:52:51] Loving Feeling
[1:52:54] set yourself up you know the easiest
[1:52:57] thing to do if you're if you if you're
[1:52:59] trying to get ahead is make a plan for
[1:53:01] when the failure tries to come
[1:53:03] in make a plan for when you are going to
[1:53:06] be weak if you're struggling to lose
[1:53:08] weight you know what you do you have a
[1:53:09] snack ready that is good for you so you
[1:53:11] don't have to go to the big the chip bag
[1:53:14] right if you know that your struggle is
[1:53:17] in these things then set yourself up and
[1:53:19] say I've got a song ready to play I've
[1:53:21] got a message ready to play I've got a
[1:53:23] service ready to play I've got a person
[1:53:25] ready to speed dial and get there and
[1:53:28] say Satan not today and you go right to
[1:53:31] that thing that's anointed and watch
[1:53:33] what it'll do in your life it'll pull
[1:53:35] you right out of those things amen but
[1:53:37] there's only one thing that's true
[1:53:39] there's only one thing that's honest
[1:53:40] there's only one thing that's pure and
[1:53:41] it's the word so it's got to be the word
[1:53:44] that you go back to it's got to be an
[1:53:46] anointed word to pull you out of these
[1:53:48] things cuz church I'll tell you Satan is
[1:53:50] going to come hard after the week
[1:53:52] weekend we had I'm not doing that to get
[1:53:55] you down I'm doing that to get you ready
[1:53:57] prepare for battle amen he wants to take
[1:54:01] back every bit of ground that we took
[1:54:02] this weekend he wants to take your
[1:54:04] experience he wants to take your joy he
[1:54:06] wants to take your peace he wants to
[1:54:08] take every little bit of it away and he
[1:54:11] is going to come hard for it and the
[1:54:13] only way you're going to hold it is you
[1:54:14] get back behind that umbrella that God
[1:54:16] gave Adam and Eve at the beginning and
[1:54:17] that's his word and you say Lord I'm
[1:54:19] going to stay right here and I'm going
[1:54:21] to confess it I'm going to speak it I'm
[1:54:23] going to sing it I'm going to pray it
[1:54:24] I'm going to put it on my lips day in
[1:54:27] and day out and push those things aside
[1:54:30] amen two quotes and we'll
[1:54:33] close brother Bram takes us through the
[1:54:35] whole in just a short thing now he takes
[1:54:37] us through the effect of belief he says
[1:54:40] now when you believed you were saved
[1:54:42] sitting in your seat wherever you were
[1:54:44] you accepted it and began to confess and
[1:54:47] tell people you were
[1:54:49] saved confession goes a long ways a
[1:54:52] testimony goes a long ways church if God
[1:54:54] did something for you this weekend go
[1:54:56] tell somebody about it it'll help anchor
[1:54:58] that thing he says now he says well you
[1:55:01] kept on saying I'm
[1:55:04] saved the people said there isn't no
[1:55:07] difference in you now catch you're
[1:55:10] saying one thing and everybody else is
[1:55:11] saying a different thing cuz they can
[1:55:13] only see what they can see but you know
[1:55:15] what's been done in your life so you're
[1:55:17] confessing based on what you've received
[1:55:20] they're confessing based on what they
[1:55:22] see and guess what the two don't always
[1:55:24] match up
[1:55:25] immediately he says but you he says they
[1:55:29] said there's no difference in you but
[1:55:30] what did you do but you believe there
[1:55:34] was he says is that right and you kept
[1:55:38] with your
[1:55:40] confession that's our part stick with
[1:55:43] your confession he says and immediately
[1:55:46] it worked
[1:55:48] righteousness does anybody see what I
[1:55:51] said what he said there he did not say
[1:55:53] that he said and you kept with your
[1:55:55] confession and after a while it worked
[1:55:59] righteousness in other words your
[1:56:01] confession came out and was visible to
[1:56:04] everybody else he says then all your
[1:56:07] neighbors and everybody knows you're
[1:56:09] saved now why because you believed it
[1:56:12] and you confessed it remember scripture
[1:56:14] says out of the ab abundance of the
[1:56:16] heart the mouth the mouth speaketh if
[1:56:18] you've receiv received something in your
[1:56:19] heart if youve received something in
[1:56:20] your soul confess it but notice there
[1:56:23] what happened amen is that the work was
[1:56:25] done but it took a while to come
[1:56:29] out life was quickened the word was
[1:56:32] quickened but it took a while for
[1:56:34] everybody to realize hey he's different
[1:56:37] wow she really is
[1:56:38] saved catch what he says now he says why
[1:56:42] what happened what changed you it says
[1:56:45] he's the high priest of your confession
[1:56:48] sitting at the right hand of the father
[1:56:51] making good what you're
[1:56:54] confessing scripture says whatsoever
[1:56:56] things are
[1:56:58] good he said now that's the same thing
[1:57:01] it is by healing you accept him as your
[1:57:03] healing and what do you do renounce your
[1:57:07] feelings God help us to renounce our
[1:57:09] feelings he says it's not by feelings
[1:57:12] it's by faith say you're healed believe
[1:57:15] you're healed act like you're healed
[1:57:18] associate with those who believe in
[1:57:19] healing and God will bring you right out
[1:57:22] to a perfect soundness of health will
[1:57:26] not fail hallelujah amen let's stand
[1:57:31] together if we would you may not have
[1:57:33] asked for healing this weekend you may
[1:57:36] not be praying for healing you may be
[1:57:37] praying for somebody's salvation you may
[1:57:40] be pray be praying for provision you may
[1:57:42] be praying for a spouse you may be
[1:57:44] praying for direction you may be praying
[1:57:46] for a loved one that's in a serious need
[1:57:49] and you may have been praying for
[1:57:50] healing he says
[1:57:52] what say it believe it act it and
[1:57:57] associate with those that believe the
[1:57:59] very same thing you're confessing we
[1:58:00] need each other amen my feelings may
[1:58:03] give out but guess what you may be the
[1:58:04] strength that I need in these times and
[1:58:06] I might be the same thing for you amen
[1:58:08] he says it will bring you right out to a
[1:58:11] perfect soundness of Health it'll bring
[1:58:13] you to exactly what God promised he says
[1:58:16] it will not fail amen isn't God good
[1:58:23] amen he who started the work will be
[1:58:26] faithful to complete it in you amen hold
[1:58:31] your confession Church feed your
[1:58:34] experience be around people that believe
[1:58:37] the same things you do and don't like
[1:58:39] let a Negative Nancy come in and try and
[1:58:42] tear it away from you Abraham called
[1:58:45] those things that were as though they
[1:58:46] were not and those things that were not
[1:58:48] as though they were that's what
[1:58:49] believers do and we take these moments
[1:58:52] we take those you know Camp a lot of
[1:58:54] times what what camp and special
[1:58:56] meetings are is you get to do eight or
[1:58:57] 10 steps in a row you really get to jump
[1:59:00] ahead and there's real growth and
[1:59:02] there's real opportunity but now we got
[1:59:04] to fight to hold on to those steps amen
[1:59:06] and that's a day-by-day work that we
[1:59:08] choose to do it's not a magic pill amen
[1:59:12] we've got to fight scripture says that
[1:59:14] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[1:59:16] and the violent take it by force we've
[1:59:18] got to be as violent with the things
[1:59:19] that Satan throws at us as he tries to
[1:59:21] be with us
[1:59:22] Amen to be as so so focused and
[1:59:25] particular about what about what we're
[1:59:26] kicking out as we are about what we're
[1:59:28] allowing in to make sure that ground is
[1:59:30] ready it's prepared and that there's a
[1:59:32] right environment for the word of God to
[1:59:34] grow in our lives amen amen God bless
[1:59:37] you each one let's bow our heads
[1:59:39] Heavenly

[1:59:52] and we know there's a process here we
[1:59:54] know there's a cycle but Lord we don't
