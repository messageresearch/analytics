[37:59] in jesus christ's name we ask it amen
[38:02] amen amen thank you musicians that'll be
[38:04] it
[38:05] then god bless you if you'll turn into
[38:07] scriptures this evening to genesis
[38:08] chapter 17.
[38:11] then genesis chapter 17 and while you're
[38:13] turning
[38:14] uh quick update on brother abe from bc
[38:17] he's out of the hospital back
[38:19] at his home now and and uh writing
[38:21] sermons and things like that so
[38:23] uh he certainly improved beyond where he
[38:25] was he's got some
[38:26] some movement back in his left side
[38:28] again and that so he's slowly making his
[38:30] way back to recovery so
[38:32] very thankful for prayers and for
[38:33] answered prayer amen
[38:35] amen certainly appreciate the song
[38:37] service this evening it was
[38:38] it was good it is well in line with what
[38:40] we're going to talk about here tonight
[38:41] amen
[38:42] amen thankful for the service on on
[38:45] sunday
[38:46] amen god is so good god is so sovereign
[38:48] you know it's not what we've done
[38:50] sometimes we can do everything and
[38:52] nothing happens and sometimes you could
[38:53] do nothing and everything happens
[38:55] and then but a good service usually
[38:56] everybody's doing their part
[38:58] it's not just a minister that's prepared
[39:00] it's a people that have come in prepared
[39:02] and dedicated and sanctified their lives
[39:04] and men and god moves in a special way
[39:05] in those things
[39:06] and everybody's then in unity amen the
[39:08] preacher's not fighting the people the
[39:10] people aren't fighting the preacher
[39:11] the holy spirit just has free reign to
[39:13] move and we're so thankful
[39:14] for that amen let's let's read genesis
[39:16] 17 verse 19.
[39:19] it says and god said sarah thy wife
[39:21] shall bear thee a son indeed
[39:22] and thou shalt call his name isaac and i
[39:25] will establish my covenant with him for
[39:27] an everlasting covenant
[39:29] and with his seed after him amen you can
[39:31] have your seat
[39:32] this evening amen tonight we want to
[39:34] start another portion of the royal seed
[39:37] brother branham when he preached on this
[39:38] he called it possessing the enemy's
[39:39] gates
[39:40] a couple other different ones but for me
[39:42] i want to call it the battle for the
[39:43] gate
[39:44] and there's a reason why we're going
[39:45] singular with that but amen this will be
[39:47] a multi-part series
[39:49] yet again i had way too many notes and i
[39:51] was really really struggling
[39:54] i didn't know where to go i was i was
[39:56] you know about two-thirds of a way
[39:58] through a sermon and then there was just
[39:59] so much more left and i said i can't
[40:01] i can't try and cram it all down their
[40:03] throats in in one service so we're just
[40:04] gonna
[40:05] take it easy here tonight try and like i
[40:07] said to a bit of a booster shot of faith
[40:09] and encouragement for us
[40:10] and i've got a lot of quotes and a lot
[40:12] of scriptures i'm not going to do so
[40:13] much talking but i'm going to let the
[40:14] prophet and the scriptures do it for me
[40:16] here tonight amen so just stick with me
[40:19] amen trusting that the lord will bless
[40:20] it this evening amen
[40:22] and then brother branham as i said he he
[40:24] really started with possessing the
[40:25] enemy's gates but this is all part of
[40:26] the greatest battle ever fought
[40:28] the patriarch abraham the mighty
[40:30] conqueror all those different messages
[40:32] because
[40:32] he's he's trying to he's trying to take
[40:34] us to so many different areas and you
[40:36] can't do that in one service
[40:37] you know and so with these thoughts you
[40:39] kind of have to pull from all different
[40:40] areas to really get the depth of what he
[40:42] was getting getting into amen but what
[40:44] we want out of all of this is not just
[40:46] head knowledge
[40:47] and it's not just an understanding in
[40:49] our minds of what god has said or what
[40:51] god has promised but we want a living
[40:52] reality
[40:53] of what he has said that's living within
[40:55] us amen
[40:56] and then we're going to cover some
[40:57] familiar ground here just a little bit
[40:59] to start
[41:00] i've been over this but again if anybody
[41:02] missed it or
[41:03] just to set the uh the tone here for for
[41:05] what we're going to do so
[41:07] as we went through here it says and god
[41:08] said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a
[41:10] son
[41:10] indeed and thou shalt call his name
[41:13] isaac and i will establish my covenant
[41:15] with him for an everlasting covenant
[41:17] and with his seed that's a singular seed
[41:20] after him amen we know that
[41:21] in the scriptures it was only isaac that
[41:23] was to be the beneficiary of this
[41:25] abraham had other children but he sent
[41:27] them away to the east bearing gifts
[41:29] and then he just held isaac there alone
[41:31] in the land of canaan because that was
[41:32] the land of promise
[41:33] isaac was the son of promise and now god
[41:36] comes and confirms this
[41:37] to abraham and says in isaac i'm going
[41:39] to confirm my covenant it's not for
[41:41] anybody else
[41:42] you have other children you're going to
[41:43] have other children but this is for
[41:44] isaac and
[41:45] isaac alone amen and we know that from
[41:47] there there's the idea that there is one
[41:49] seed there is one line
[41:50] and it's not a bloodline it's not just
[41:53] isaac's bloodline that was going to be
[41:54] blessed because there's many in isaac's
[41:56] bloodline that weren't blessed
[41:57] we read about nabel amen he's coming
[41:59] down through a different lineage he's
[42:01] coming down through through the
[42:02] israelite line but he's a dog
[42:04] right he's he's a crude man he's a man
[42:06] that has no
[42:07] godliness in him we hear of even jacob's
[42:09] sons and how many of them fell by the
[42:11] wayside amen there's
[42:12] there's nothing in there that says that
[42:14] every one of them was going to be a son
[42:15] of god
[42:16] but he said in isaac is where i'm going
[42:18] to bless the line regardless amen
[42:20] and we know that that's a part of us
[42:21] then that it's a spiritual lineage not
[42:23] just a
[42:24] natural lineage and if we can find
[42:26] ourselves in there then we know that the
[42:27] blessings are for us amen
[42:30] genesis 22 it continues and now this is
[42:32] god expanding on the covenant and this
[42:34] is where we start talking about
[42:35] possessing the gates of
[42:36] the gate of the the enemy and verse 15
[42:39] says and the angel of the lord called
[42:40] unto abraham out of heaven the second
[42:42] time
[42:43] and said by myself have i sworn saith
[42:46] the lord
[42:46] for because thou hast done this thing
[42:48] and has not withheld thy son thine only
[42:50] son
[42:51] this is right after he put isaac on the
[42:53] altar right and so he's got the promise
[42:55] in front of him and god says kill the
[42:56] promise
[42:58] take the life of the promise and abraham
[43:00] we know prophesy before
[43:01] he ca he went up on the mountain he said
[43:03] i will return with the
[43:05] with my son with the lad god had told me
[43:07] he was going to kill him but he knew
[43:08] that the promise had to be fulfilled
[43:10] and so he was willing to take his life
[43:12] knowing that god would have to raise him
[43:13] up if indeed he did kill him amen amen
[43:16] and now the angel says he called out the
[43:18] second time so he told him to kill him
[43:19] and now he calls out second time
[43:21] says don't do it or the first time he
[43:22] says don't do it and then he says
[43:24] because you've done this thing and
[43:25] haven't held
[43:26] withheld thy son thine only son that in
[43:28] blessing i will bless thee
[43:30] and multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[43:33] as the stars of the heaven
[43:35] and as the sandwiches upon the seashore
[43:37] and thy
[43:38] seed singular shall possess the gate
[43:41] singular amen of his enemies plural
[43:45] there's only one gate but there's many
[43:47] enemies you'll notice and as we get we
[43:49] won't get into it so much this service
[43:50] but in the coming services
[43:52] whenever i'm up here next we'll talk
[43:53] about why that's a single gate
[43:55] amen there's many enemies that come
[43:56] against us and we're going to conquer
[43:58] them but there's a single gate
[43:59] that has to be overcome and when that
[44:01] gate is overcome everything else falls
[44:03] by the wayside
[44:04] he says and in thy seat against singular
[44:06] shall all the nations of the earth be
[44:08] blessed
[44:09] because thou hast obeyed my voice
[44:12] and then so this again is talking about
[44:14] a particular lineage
[44:15] and this is the royal seed that he's
[44:17] talking about it was interesting when i
[44:18] was studying for this
[44:19] and you look at the con the the the
[44:21] mentions of royal seat by brother
[44:23] branham
[44:23] and the vast majority of them are after
[44:25] 63.
[44:27] he's talking about the opening of the
[44:28] word he's talking about the title d
[44:30] being read and taken and read now
[44:32] and all of a sudden he starts talking
[44:33] about the royal seed more and more and
[44:34] more because it's being quickened to
[44:36] them
[44:36] what this means what this means to be a
[44:39] member of the of the
[44:40] faithful abraham seed amen
[44:43] so isaac receives now an expansion of
[44:45] the covenant he doesn't just have a
[44:47] blessing now but god says you're going
[44:48] to possess the gate of
[44:50] every single one of your enemies they
[44:52] will not be able to hold their own place
[44:54] they will not be able to hold anything
[44:55] that you claim
[44:56] ever you will stand in the gate and you
[44:58] will possess everything that they have
[45:00] tried to come against you with amen
[45:02] amen this is not just for isaac again
[45:05] this is not just talking about
[45:06] the the natural kingdom but this is
[45:08] talking about the spiritual canaan
[45:10] and this is talking about the bride of
[45:11] christ and that she's got a place where
[45:13] she's going to have to stand
[45:14] and hold back when the enemy comes in to
[45:16] take a possession back from her
[45:19] listen to what brother branham says this
[45:20] was a beautiful opening prayer
[45:22] in possessing the enemies gates in 59 he
[45:24] says and now father god
[45:26] we would not only pray for these here
[45:27] but for those stretched out across the
[45:29] world
[45:30] that are needy both spiritually and
[45:32] physically
[45:33] give to them o lord the desires of their
[45:35] hearts
[45:36] because thy children are struggling in
[45:38] these days
[45:40] the oppression of the enemy is so strong
[45:43] but thou
[45:43] art stronger for it is written greater
[45:46] is he that's in you
[45:47] than he that's in the world and he says
[45:50] by this
[45:51] we overcome amen greater is he that's in
[45:53] you than he that's in the world and when
[45:55] we get into the next
[45:56] portion of this series and in the next
[45:58] couple weeks or whatever we'll
[46:00] understand what it means to say greater
[46:01] is he that's in you and why it says
[46:03] in you amen and then why he says and
[46:06] that's
[46:07] how we overcome by this we overcome
[46:10] again i'm just setting us up here i know
[46:11] this is very familiar
[46:13] for all of us but just to set us in the
[46:14] scriptures i'll read it quickly we've
[46:16] read it before it says christ has
[46:18] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[46:20] be made a curse for us for it is written
[46:22] cursed is everyone that hangeth on a
[46:24] tree
[46:24] that's calvary for us that the blessing
[46:27] of abraham might come on
[46:28] to might come on the gentiles through
[46:30] jesus christ
[46:31] and that we might receive the promise of
[46:34] the spirit through faith
[46:36] brethren i speak after the manner of men
[46:38] though it be but a man's covenant
[46:40] yet if it be confirmed no man
[46:41] disanolather added there too he says
[46:43] when man makes a covenant nobody breaks
[46:45] it
[46:45] if it's written down nobody can touch it
[46:48] he says and now we're talking about a
[46:49] different covenant and it's a godly
[46:51] covenant
[46:51] and he says not to abraham and his seed
[46:53] where the promise is made
[46:55] and he saith not and to seeds as of many
[46:58] but as of one and to thy seed which is
[47:01] christ so he says the net
[47:02] the the fulfillment of the royal seed is
[47:04] in christ christ is where you look when
[47:06] you say what is the one that is the seed
[47:08] of abraham
[47:09] because that's the lineage that's going
[47:10] to track down all the way through and
[47:12] that's why you can have rahabs and
[47:14] that's why you can have these different
[47:15] ones pulled in
[47:16] is because it's not a bloodline now it's
[47:18] a it's a it's a spiritual line
[47:20] of pulling people from all places from
[47:22] the highways and the byways and the
[47:24] hedges
[47:25] and the ditches and these different
[47:26] things because there was a seed in them
[47:28] from the beginning and god has to pull
[47:29] them in
[47:30] even when he's dealing with the jews
[47:32] alone even when he's dealing with the
[47:33] jews alone you still see him pull in
[47:35] those gentile women especially from here
[47:37] and there and showing what's going to be
[47:39] coming down the road
[47:41] amen amen so we're counted paul paul
[47:43] makes no
[47:44] there's there's no muddy in the waters
[47:46] here he says you are a part of the royal
[47:48] seat of abraham
[47:49] and therefore you have the covenant and
[47:51] the covenant won't be broken because god
[47:52] made the covenant
[47:53] and so it's for each one of you brother
[47:56] brown continues he says and i'm so glad
[47:58] that i have the opportunity
[47:59] and can bring one of the greatest
[48:01] treasures to the people
[48:03] that there is in the world to tell them
[48:05] that we are heirs with abraham of this
[48:07] promise
[48:07] we are abraham's children and how do we
[48:10] do it by joining the church
[48:12] no by being dead in christ dead in
[48:15] christ
[48:15] receiving the holy spirit then we are
[48:17] abraham's seed
[48:18] and our heirs with him according to the
[48:20] promise he says don't fail to get it
[48:22] christian friends
[48:23] stay with it what he's saying is stay
[48:25] with what death in christ and the
[48:27] baptism of the holy spirit don't let a
[48:28] church tell you something different
[48:30] don't let some denomination try and pull
[48:32] you and say if you do this or you do
[48:33] that then you're saved and you're
[48:35] a member of the bride or you're a member
[48:37] of the church he's saying stick with the
[48:39] holy spirit stick with staying dead in
[48:40] christ
[48:41] and let that take you all the way
[48:42] through so we know that christ
[48:45] was the royal seed amen he was the one
[48:48] that received everything but we also
[48:50] know that
[48:50] isaac was a type of christ isaac was the
[48:53] one that was going to receive the
[48:54] benefit of abraham's faith
[48:56] right of abraham's promises from god in
[48:58] these different things
[48:59] brother bram talks about isaac here and
[49:01] he says now there's three comings of the
[49:03] lord
[49:04] the lord jesus came first to redeem his
[49:06] bride he comes second to receive his
[49:08] bride
[49:09] he comes third with his bride see he
[49:11] don't come on the earth in the next
[49:13] coming we're just caught up to meet him
[49:14] in the air
[49:15] see the beautiful story of rebecca and
[49:17] how that she got on the camel and went
[49:19] to meet isaac with eleazier
[49:20] and isaac being the type of christ the
[49:23] son of god
[49:24] which he was the son of abraham who fell
[49:26] heir to all of abraham's goods and all
[49:28] that he had
[49:28] because christ is there to all things he
[49:30] says isaac's the type of christ because
[49:32] isaac is the beneficiary isaac is the
[49:34] one that has the inheritance
[49:36] abraham didn't get it isaac was the one
[49:37] that had that that had the continuation
[49:39] through him
[49:40] now listen here he says he was out in
[49:42] the field in the evening time
[49:45] not in the morning not in the afternoon
[49:46] but in the evening time
[49:48] he's walking through the field he's
[49:50] meditating the scripture says
[49:51] wandering around out in the field when
[49:53] he saw the beautiful rebecca coming on
[49:55] the camel
[49:57] now brother brown says oh my that just
[49:59] makes chills go
[50:01] through me now why does that make chills
[50:03] go through brother branham it's just a
[50:04] story of isaac and rebecca in the
[50:05] evening time
[50:08] but there's a different isaac and
[50:09] rebecca that we're talking about now
[50:10] because brother adams brother ram love
[50:12] to paint a picture
[50:13] he loved to tell you why this is
[50:15] important to you and he loved to throw
[50:16] you
[50:17] into that picture so that you'd
[50:18] understand why this is in the scripture
[50:20] in the first place amen
[50:21] so he's saying this isn't about isaac
[50:23] and rebecca what i'm talking about here
[50:25] is not about
[50:26] isaac and rebecca he says it's about you
[50:28] you have to see yourself in the story
[50:30] you have to see yourself in the place
[50:32] that christ wants you to remember he
[50:34] said if you can't see christ in every
[50:35] book
[50:36] in every page of the bible then reread
[50:38] it again but if you can see christ then
[50:39] you have to see how that ties into you
[50:41] as well and then you've got to be able
[50:43] to see yourself in the book of the bot
[50:45] in the books of the bible
[50:46] not just in revelation or these
[50:48] different ones or in the new testament
[50:49] but you've got to see yourself all the
[50:50] way through
[50:51] because if christ is there then the
[50:52] bride is going to have to be typed right
[50:54] there along with them amen
[50:56] so we want to see ourselves in the story
[50:58] so he gets chills as he thinks about
[51:01] eliezer coming back with rebecca on the
[51:04] camel
[51:05] and then isaac sees her and he says oh
[51:07] that just puts chills through me and i
[51:08] was
[51:09] studying this just in there really quick
[51:11] and it just came to me
[51:12] and i didn't have time to throw it in
[51:13] there but i'll read it out to you and
[51:15] this is in
[51:16] genesis 24 if you'll just turn there
[51:18] quickly genesis 24.
[51:22] just a few pages forward because brother
[51:23] branham says i get chills
[51:25] going through me when i'm thinking about
[51:27] this isaac and rebecca story
[51:29] because brother branham sees himself
[51:31] very clearly in what's happening now
[51:33] right he understands what's going on and
[51:35] he's got a place in it but this struck
[51:36] me when i read this
[51:38] this is abraham this is this is
[51:41] eleazar talking about what abraham said
[51:44] to him before he left
[51:46] so now genesis 24 37 it says and my
[51:49] master made me swear saying
[51:51] thou shalt not take a wife to my son of
[51:53] the daughters of the canaanites in whose
[51:55] land i dwell
[51:56] and then he's got a peculiar bride to
[51:58] take out of a different people
[52:00] but thou shalt go unto my father's house
[52:04] and to my kindred and take a wife unto
[52:07] my son
[52:07] so abraham says you can't just take it
[52:09] from anybody don't take it out of the
[52:11] canaanites
[52:11] take it out of my bloodline take it out
[52:14] of the chosen people
[52:16] and i said to my master pear adventure
[52:18] the woman will not go with me
[52:19] he understands women well they might not
[52:21] go they might not say yes
[52:24] she might not want to go with me now
[52:26] listen to what now this is this is him
[52:28] relaying what abraham said to him
[52:30] and he said unto me the lord before whom
[52:33] i walk
[52:34] will send his angel with thee
[52:37] and prosper thy way and thou shalt take
[52:40] a wife for my son of my kindred
[52:43] and of my father's house we know brother
[52:46] brandon was the eleazar here
[52:48] and it says i will send my angel before
[52:51] thee
[52:52] to do what to prepare the situation so
[52:54] that the bride is going to recognize
[52:56] what's going on
[52:57] she's going to recognize this messenger
[52:59] she's going to accept what he has to say
[53:02] and then she'll come away without
[53:03] knowing anything really about this man
[53:05] except
[53:06] what the messenger says but the angel
[53:09] goes to prepare the way and the angel is
[53:11] beside him and brother branham would say
[53:13] he'd always bring the people from the
[53:14] right why angel of the lord standing
[53:16] right there and preparing the way
[53:18] right setting the people's hearts
[53:20] performing signs and wonders proving
[53:22] the riches of the father in heaven that
[53:24] was calling a bride for his child amen
[53:26] calling the bride for christ amen
[53:30] amen hallelujah it's so beautiful when
[53:33] you see this
[53:33] i mean we we talk so much about other
[53:35] people and we talk about christ and all
[53:37] these things
[53:38] but when you can see what he's doing
[53:39] here to reinforce to the bride
[53:41] i've made a way i've made a way i've got
[53:43] an idea here and i'm going to make it go
[53:45] all the way through nothing's going to
[53:46] stop it
[53:47] and i've thought about you way before i
[53:49] ever called you out of a people amen
[53:51] we're talking about way before he's just
[53:53] calling the jews here
[53:55] and he's already telling the gentile
[53:57] bride i've got a place for you in this
[53:59] and i'm going to call you and i'm going
[54:00] to send an angel to you
[54:01] and i'm going to prepare the way so that
[54:02] you'll accept me
[54:04] when i come in your place amen
[54:07] amen we see then that christ
[54:11] he conquered everything this is what he
[54:14] was talking about here with christ
[54:16] and and he he says you know he conquered
[54:18] everything
[54:19] there was nothing he faced that he
[54:20] didn't conquer and he comes as the
[54:22] mighty conqueror and he takes the bride
[54:24] as the mighty conqueror
[54:25] and then he comes back with her and they
[54:26] conquer everything on you know
[54:28] everything's put under their feet for
[54:29] the millennium and these different
[54:30] things
[54:31] amen but it's interesting how we think
[54:34] that christ
[54:35] had an edge on us and somehow that means
[54:37] he didn't have to go through the things
[54:39] that we do
[54:40] and then he comes through and he has a
[54:42] body that's without sin
[54:44] and that's the only advantage that
[54:45] christ had but he still was tested in
[54:48] every way that we were
[54:50] amen i'm going to read some scriptures
[54:52] i'm going to read some quotes here to
[54:53] kind of set this a bit because i want us
[54:55] to
[54:55] understand that he didn't just glide
[54:57] through because he was the fullness of
[54:58] the godhead bodily
[54:59] when he took on human flesh he had to
[55:01] deal with every emotion
[55:03] every thought every influence that we
[55:05] have to deal with
[55:06] and then being in a human body did not
[55:08] mean that he didn't have emotions
[55:10] that he didn't have you know people
[55:12] coming against them when they did that
[55:14] that didn't cause
[55:15] something potentially to flare up in him
[55:17] you know that his back might stiffen a
[55:19] little bit when somebody
[55:20] you know slighted him or besmirched his
[55:22] character these different things
[55:24] he was a man that had to deal with the
[55:25] human emotions that we do
[55:27] hebrews 4 15 says for we have not in a
[55:30] high priest which cannot be touched
[55:32] with the feeling of our infirmities not
[55:35] just with our infirmities but with the
[55:37] feeling of our infirmities
[55:38] what does it feel like to be sick what
[55:40] does it feel like to be tired
[55:41] what does it feel like to be stretched
[55:43] thin when he died he looked like a 50
[55:45] year old
[55:46] that's how hard his life was i don't see
[55:48] anybody in here that's
[55:49] that's 33 years old and they're calling
[55:52] you a 50 year old
[55:53] that's how difficult his life was and
[55:54] that's the toll it took on a sinless
[55:56] body
[55:57] was it added another 20 years to his his
[55:59] appearance
[56:00] that's how difficult it was so it says
[56:02] he was he was can be touched with the
[56:04] feeling of our infirmities
[56:06] but was in all points tempted like as we
[56:08] are yet without sin
[56:10] so that says he went through everything
[56:12] that we faced not necessarily the exact
[56:14] same situation but the temptation
[56:16] or the difficulty of that situation he
[56:19] faced every single one of those things
[56:20] amen
[56:23] and even to the point now that he didn't
[56:25] not only did he conquer but he gave
[56:27] himself willingly to those things
[56:29] and in the end he gave up his life
[56:31] willingly
[56:32] and then he walked right up that road to
[56:34] calvary and laid his life
[56:36] down for us amen after all of that
[56:39] testing out of all that rejection out of
[56:40] all those trials
[56:41] yet he could still walk up and say it's
[56:43] worth it to me i'm going to lay my life
[56:45] down
[56:46] willingly john 10 says therefore does my
[56:49] father love me because i lay down my
[56:51] life
[56:52] that i might take it again no man taketh
[56:54] it from me
[56:55] but i lay it down to myself amen in the
[56:57] garden of gethsemane
[56:58] he said not my will but thine be done he
[57:01] says i don't want to do it
[57:02] in this flesh in the sinless flesh i
[57:04] don't want to do it i don't want to go
[57:06] through what i'm going to have to go
[57:07] through
[57:08] i was telling someone the other day when
[57:10] when you look at that thing that says he
[57:11] was more marred than any man
[57:13] it says his visage his face was so beat
[57:16] up that he was no longer recognizable as
[57:18] a human
[57:19] that's how beaten jesus was when he went
[57:21] there and then they ripped him to shreds
[57:23] with the whips
[57:24] that's what he went through and he says
[57:25] i don't want to go through that in this
[57:27] flesh
[57:28] but because of the joy before me i'll do
[57:30] whatever you tell me to do
[57:32] not my will but thine be done so he says
[57:34] no man taketh it from me
[57:36] but i lay it down of myself i have power
[57:39] to lay it down
[57:40] and i have power to take it again amen
[57:42] they didn't kill him with the spear
[57:43] they didn't kill him with all the blood
[57:45] draining out he laid down his life
[57:48] he gave it away when it was done he said
[57:51] it is finished and he died
[57:52] what did he do he literally gave up his
[57:55] life
[57:56] gave it up amen he says i have power to
[57:58] take it again
[57:59] this commandment have i received my
[58:01] father
[58:02] for the brahman describing this he says
[58:04] man was refused from heaven the highway
[58:06] was closed
[58:07] there was no highway but where there was
[58:09] no highway he came to make one oh my the
[58:12] first line was demons of doubt
[58:14] the next was prejudice the next was
[58:15] selfishness this earth was covered over
[58:18] with lines of demon power
[58:19] then sickness and diseases but when he
[58:21] began to ascend up to heaven
[58:23] last night we had him coming out of hell
[58:25] with the keys of death and hell on his
[58:27] side this morning we are taking him up
[58:29] hallelujah
[58:30] when he rose he was triumphant and as he
[58:32] went up he broke every devil power that
[58:35] holds over man
[58:36] he ascended on high and gave gifts to
[58:38] men the gifts of the holy spirit
[58:41] he says the mighty conqueror he stands
[58:43] alone this morning
[58:44] and between him and every believer is
[58:46] the blessed old highway of holiness
[58:48] that the righteous shall walk on there's
[58:50] not a way of escape there is only one
[58:52] line cut down from glory
[58:54] he left the bloody footprints as he
[58:56] walked through the corridors of the
[58:58] demon powers
[58:59] and made a highway for us all the way
[59:01] through he sets this morning as the
[59:03] mighty conqueror
[59:04] he says his people are having a jubilee
[59:08] tens of thousands of them around the
[59:09] world are shouting
[59:11] the victory amen bloody footprints
[59:14] leading the way
[59:15] through the gates of hell to take those
[59:16] keys and walk up and say there's a door
[59:18] open in heaven and there's a path
[59:20] and that way is called the way of
[59:21] holiness amen and we can walk on that
[59:24] and we can go to be with him amen
[59:26] now remember we're talking about the
[59:28] gate of our enemies as we start to dig
[59:30] in now that's the foundation amen
[59:32] but brother branham kicks off in an
[59:34] interesting way
[59:37] because when we talk about conquering
[59:39] what do we go straight to we go to
[59:41] sickness
[59:42] and healing of sickness right we go to
[59:44] salvation and these different things and
[59:45] we talk about deliverance and
[59:47] demon powers and we start looking at all
[59:49] the miracles that jesus did in his life
[59:51] in his short three and a half year
[59:53] ministry that's where we go
[59:55] but watch what brother branham does here
[59:57] as he starts to talk about possessing
[59:59] the enemy's gates
[1:00:00] because he doesn't go into healing and
[1:00:01] sickness necessarily
[1:00:03] he says he conquered temptation when the
[1:00:07] enemy spit in his face smote his jaw he
[1:00:09] turned the other side
[1:00:10] when they jerked beard from his face and
[1:00:12] spit on him he never
[1:00:14] riled back he conquered the gate of
[1:00:16] temptation
[1:00:17] and took it amen so he's talking about
[1:00:20] where we live
[1:00:21] day to day he's talking about reactions
[1:00:24] to actions
[1:00:25] he's not talking about he conquer you
[1:00:27] know cancer
[1:00:28] and diabetes and these different things
[1:00:30] he says he conquered temptation
[1:00:32] to respond back in an unchrist-like way
[1:00:34] that's the first thing brother brahm
[1:00:36] goes to is that he conquered
[1:00:37] what himself he conquered the response
[1:00:40] to people that were ungodly that had no
[1:00:42] idea what they were doing
[1:00:43] in ignorance they were crucifying the
[1:00:45] king of glory and he says he responded
[1:00:47] not back to it
[1:00:48] but he continued in the path he says
[1:00:50] then you say
[1:00:51] my temper won't let me do it my temper
[1:00:54] won't let me act that way i've got too
[1:00:56] big of a problem
[1:00:57] he says you seed of abraham yes sir he
[1:01:00] conquered
[1:01:01] it for you amen he leaves us no excuse
[1:01:04] for where we sit with our genetics
[1:01:06] with the way we're built with the way we
[1:01:07] were raised the way my daddy was the way
[1:01:09] my mommy was
[1:01:10] he says it doesn't matter he has
[1:01:12] conquered every single thing
[1:01:14] that you are going to face in your life
[1:01:16] amen
[1:01:17] how by the holy spirit amen the holy
[1:01:20] spirit's the only thing that can do that
[1:01:22] in your life
[1:01:23] they talk about you know nature over
[1:01:25] nurture or nurture over nature and these
[1:01:27] different things the holy spirit sends
[1:01:29] all of those things to the side
[1:01:30] and says we can do all things through
[1:01:32] christ with strengthen us amen
[1:01:34] that's exactly what we're talking about
[1:01:35] what is it the christian is defined not
[1:01:37] by what happens to them but how they
[1:01:39] respond back to it
[1:01:40] that's what christ was showing was he
[1:01:42] conquered the temptation to do
[1:01:44] something back we've talked about
[1:01:46] meekness and meekness is what
[1:01:48] the ability to do something and not do
[1:01:50] it the the pow
[1:01:51] having the power to do something and
[1:01:53] choosing not to do it
[1:01:54] and that's what jesus had there was he
[1:01:56] was the ultimate show of meekness
[1:01:57] because he could have called 12 legions
[1:01:59] of angels down
[1:02:00] wiped them all up and said this isn't
[1:02:02] worth it i'm gone
[1:02:03] but he took it because that was his role
[1:02:06] and then that was his purpose
[1:02:08] brother band puts that right in our lap
[1:02:10] and says if he did it you can do it
[1:02:12] amen if he can take that nobody's up
[1:02:14] here ripping my beard out
[1:02:16] right i don't have a crown of thorns
[1:02:17] nobody's whipping me he says if he can
[1:02:20] deal with that
[1:02:20] and you've got the same life in you and
[1:02:22] he conquered it already then you can
[1:02:24] conquer it as well
[1:02:26] amen when he was riled up he riled not
[1:02:29] back
[1:02:29] when he was made fun of he held his
[1:02:31] peace when he was called the devil
[1:02:33] he held his peace he had one business
[1:02:36] and that's the father's business and he
[1:02:39] went about doing that as long as you
[1:02:40] weren't going to keep him from doing the
[1:02:42] father's business
[1:02:43] he wouldn't worry about you but if you
[1:02:45] stood in front of him and he was on the
[1:02:46] father's business lookout
[1:02:48] and we see him do that time and time
[1:02:49] again when things stood in front of him
[1:02:51] he'd push him aside because he was in
[1:02:52] the father's way
[1:02:54] amen but you're just trying to get him
[1:02:56] going he doesn't worry about it because
[1:02:58] he's focused on
[1:02:59] his father's business he's focused on
[1:03:01] what his purpose was amen
[1:03:04] what a perspective that gives us you
[1:03:06] know we think about these signs shall
[1:03:07] follow them
[1:03:09] but then we won't do anything about
[1:03:10] what's happening in our in our character
[1:03:12] and our nature
[1:03:13] in in the genetics that we have that
[1:03:15] keep us from you know
[1:03:16] from getting close in a relationship or
[1:03:18] that snap at our children or
[1:03:20] you know that can't hold a job or
[1:03:21] whatever it is these things we don't
[1:03:23] look at that and say
[1:03:24] we've got to conquer that we're all busy
[1:03:26] trying to lay hands on people and get
[1:03:27] them
[1:03:28] get them better but no he's saying look
[1:03:30] he he conquered himself before he
[1:03:32] that was the final conquering he did was
[1:03:33] he conquered himself before he walked up
[1:03:35] to calvary amen
[1:03:37] amen you think it didn't burn him when
[1:03:38] people said things
[1:03:40] you think he wasn't hurt when the the
[1:03:42] prince of glory the messiah
[1:03:44] was standing in front of them and they
[1:03:45] were calling him everything but that
[1:03:47] when they called him a bastard when they
[1:03:49] called him a wine bibber
[1:03:51] amen when they said that there was no
[1:03:53] way he could be it when they got his
[1:03:54] birth city wrong
[1:03:56] when they called his mom names right
[1:03:59] all these things you think that didn't
[1:04:00] have an issue in his body
[1:04:03] that those emotions didn't flare up and
[1:04:05] that didn't hurt him
[1:04:06] right he sat over jerusalem he said
[1:04:08] jerusalem jerusalem
[1:04:10] how long y'all would have gathered you
[1:04:12] to myself right what was he doing he was
[1:04:14] crying over it it broke his heart that
[1:04:16] they have rejected him
[1:04:17] and yet we think that he doesn't
[1:04:19] understand what we're going through
[1:04:20] the pain that we feel the rejections
[1:04:22] that we have if anyone knew it it was
[1:04:24] him
[1:04:24] because he came into his own and his own
[1:04:26] received him not amen
[1:04:29] brother braham says also temptation he
[1:04:31] was tempted in every manner like we were
[1:04:33] what did he do he conquered it and what
[1:04:36] did he say to us
[1:04:37] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:04:39] you
[1:04:40] just says resist him he didn't say
[1:04:42] defeat him didn't say beat him up he
[1:04:44] said resist him and he'll flee
[1:04:46] you don't have to beat him you just have
[1:04:47] to resist him and he'll have to leave
[1:04:50] he conquered sickness for us he
[1:04:51] conquered temptation force
[1:04:53] and broke down the gates he took the key
[1:04:55] away from the tempter
[1:04:56] and handed it over to the believer the
[1:04:59] believer controls the gates now not
[1:05:01] satan
[1:05:02] handed over to the believer of abraham's
[1:05:04] seat and said if he tempts you resist
[1:05:06] him
[1:05:06] and he will flee from you oh my
[1:05:09] resistance
[1:05:10] resist him and then he's talking about
[1:05:12] the gate of your enemies he's talking
[1:05:13] about temptation he's talking about
[1:05:15] temper he's talking about hitting back
[1:05:17] he's talking about revenge he's talking
[1:05:18] about getting riled up forget about
[1:05:20] death hell in the grave and just
[1:05:22] focus on those and say what excuse do we
[1:05:24] have today
[1:05:25] amen if we will only yield ourselves if
[1:05:27] we will only humble ourselves to the
[1:05:29] holy spirit to let him come through us
[1:05:31] then we can conquer those things amen in
[1:05:33] our marriages in our relationships
[1:05:35] that's where we're going to see the
[1:05:36] the the effect of those types of things
[1:05:38] if we're in that day in and day out and
[1:05:39] if the holy spirit's not conquering that
[1:05:41] and we want to go out and we want to do
[1:05:42] the greater works i'm sorry it's not
[1:05:44] going to happen
[1:05:45] it's got to happen where you walk day to
[1:05:46] day before you want to see miracles
[1:05:48] coming
[1:05:48] let's let's focus on where we walk every
[1:05:50] day and then see what he'll do in his
[1:05:52] sovereign way on the rest of it amen
[1:05:54] amen
[1:06:00] he said on the day of pentecost he sent
[1:06:02] down the holy ghost
[1:06:03] to continue not to start but to continue
[1:06:07] through the gentiles
[1:06:08] to take out a seed of promise to give to
[1:06:10] the gentiles the
[1:06:12] offcast to give them the baptism of the
[1:06:14] holy ghost to bring them into the
[1:06:15] promise
[1:06:16] now we have a right to conquer all
[1:06:18] sickness
[1:06:19] then he says we don't have to conquer it
[1:06:22] it's already conquered
[1:06:24] we just have to claim the promise and go
[1:06:26] take it
[1:06:27] it's already conquered death is
[1:06:30] conquered
[1:06:30] hell is conquered sickness is conquered
[1:06:33] temptation is conquered all devils is
[1:06:35] conquered hell is conquered death is
[1:06:36] conquered the grave is conquered
[1:06:38] we stand in the gate taking it and don't
[1:06:41] have to fire a shot
[1:06:42] the price it's already been paid for
[1:06:46] he's pointing out the believer's
[1:06:47] position you're not here to do that
[1:06:49] battle
[1:06:50] you are not there to defeat them you're
[1:06:52] there to dispossess them
[1:06:53] you're there to push them out of your
[1:06:55] land to push them out of what belongs to
[1:06:57] you
[1:06:57] he says christ has conquered everything
[1:06:59] we face so you don't have to conquer
[1:07:01] anything else death hell in the grave so
[1:07:02] anything that comes out of hell
[1:07:04] death itself and even dying if even if
[1:07:07] you're in the grave he says none of
[1:07:08] that's going to hold you back
[1:07:09] so anything from hell that's coming
[1:07:10] against you the battle is not to defeat
[1:07:12] it
[1:07:12] the battle is to push it off your land
[1:07:15] it's already defeated and so it's now a
[1:07:17] claim of do you have a right
[1:07:19] amen is this mine or is this yours and
[1:07:20] if you can point to the word and it says
[1:07:22] this is mine
[1:07:23] then you can push him off every single
[1:07:25] time
[1:07:26] amen
[1:07:30] coming back to rebecca and the bride and
[1:07:32] men so christ conquered
[1:07:34] but we're not christ in that sense we
[1:07:37] didn't go to calvary in that sense
[1:07:38] brother brown says we were in him right
[1:07:41] and by that that
[1:07:42] that identification we go through but we
[1:07:44] don't have a memory of that we don't
[1:07:45] have a memory of that conquering of
[1:07:46] those trials and temptations that christ
[1:07:48] went through
[1:07:49] this is our trial and our temptation now
[1:07:50] is when we're in this world amen
[1:07:53] but we're the bride of christ amen we're
[1:07:55] the rebecca in that story we're not the
[1:07:56] isaac
[1:07:57] and how do we fit into that so brother
[1:07:59] branham starts to talk about rebecca he
[1:08:01] says so they called the young girl
[1:08:02] rebecca
[1:08:03] and perhaps the conversation was
[1:08:04] something like this rebecca you've
[1:08:06] we fed you and raised you to the best of
[1:08:08] our knowledge to be a virgin girl and
[1:08:10] that you are
[1:08:10] but here comes a stranger among us with
[1:08:13] some evidence that there is a rich man
[1:08:15] who's going to give to his son all these
[1:08:17] blessings do you wish to go with him now
[1:08:19] or do you wish to wait for about 10 days
[1:08:21] till you make up your mind
[1:08:23] now remember the servant said i want to
[1:08:25] be on my way god has given me good favor
[1:08:27] and i'm ready to be on my way
[1:08:29] see he sees god's moving in the
[1:08:30] situation he says let's just keep this
[1:08:31] party going
[1:08:32] right let's not stand around and think
[1:08:34] about is this makes sense or is this
[1:08:35] right or wrong
[1:08:36] it's good god's made a way let's get out
[1:08:38] of here
[1:08:39] he says don't ever put off tomorrow what
[1:08:41] you can do today
[1:08:43] that's the way the message is when it's
[1:08:45] preached you hear of a king
[1:08:47] god who his son christ falls there to
[1:08:49] all things
[1:08:50] and we've got a little foretaste of it
[1:08:52] by the holy spirit
[1:08:53] what do you think about him have you got
[1:08:56] faith in him
[1:08:57] so amen you're rebecca here and he says
[1:08:59] you've got a foretaste of
[1:09:01] christ and that's the holy spirit in you
[1:09:03] he says remember she
[1:09:06] had to choose by faith it
[1:09:09] always starts with faith i keep coming
[1:09:11] back to it you can't escape from it
[1:09:12] it always starts with faith she had
[1:09:15] never seen the man
[1:09:16] she had to choose by faith and the words
[1:09:19] of a servant
[1:09:21] brother branham showed us christ in a
[1:09:22] way that nobody else has shown since
[1:09:24] christ was here as far as we know
[1:09:27] brother brown said the only difference
[1:09:28] between christ then and christ in his
[1:09:30] time
[1:09:31] was the corporal body he said he is here
[1:09:33] in every way except the corporal body
[1:09:36] and he stood there and with that messiah
[1:09:38] sign he did everything that christ did
[1:09:40] raising the dead deserving the thoughts
[1:09:41] and intents of the heart healing the
[1:09:43] stick
[1:09:43] sick casting out demons all of these
[1:09:46] things amen he called the people out
[1:09:48] right he broke down the religious
[1:09:50] barriers everything that christ
[1:09:52] did in his first one in the second one
[1:09:54] christ is standing there
[1:09:55] in the message of william branham and
[1:09:56] he's doing the exact same thing over and
[1:09:58] over and over again
[1:10:01] what choose it by faith and the words of
[1:10:03] a servant
[1:10:05] that's the same way you'll have to do
[1:10:07] because that's the only way there is to
[1:10:08] do it god sends out his servants
[1:10:10] and they preach the word faith cometh by
[1:10:12] hearing what do you think about it
[1:10:15] that's up to you to make your choice i
[1:10:17] would advise you not to put it off
[1:10:19] you say well i have always longed to
[1:10:20] receive the holy spirit i better think
[1:10:22] it over
[1:10:23] don't think it over this is the time
[1:10:25] it's the truth
[1:10:26] i believe that god would heal me someday
[1:10:28] as long as you keep that
[1:10:30] in your mind you're a defeated person
[1:10:33] god healed you 1900 years ago
[1:10:37] he says now is the day of your decision
[1:10:40] when you hear the message that christ
[1:10:42] was wounded for your transgressions
[1:10:44] with his stripes you were healed this is
[1:10:46] the time now
[1:10:47] to believe it so god wants immediate
[1:10:50] action if you love him
[1:10:51] throw everything else aside and take him
[1:10:54] if you believe his word cast everything
[1:10:56] else away and take his word
[1:10:58] it's a time of decision you have to make
[1:11:00] your mind
[1:11:01] he's talking about a showdown amen the
[1:11:03] mount carmel showdown
[1:11:04] where elijah's up there and he says look
[1:11:07] pick one
[1:11:08] god or baal whichever one answers
[1:11:11] follow that one and we know of course
[1:11:12] that god answered by fire consumed the
[1:11:14] entire sacrifice
[1:11:15] and bale of course was sleeping because
[1:11:17] he didn't exist amen but he says you've
[1:11:19] got to make a choice
[1:11:21] and if you don't make a choice that's
[1:11:23] making a choice
[1:11:24] because he says you've got to pick and
[1:11:26] if you don't pick then that's not
[1:11:27] picking
[1:11:28] and that means you've rejected christ so
[1:11:30] there is no neutral ground here like i
[1:11:31] said
[1:11:32] if you're on the fence the fence belongs
[1:11:33] to satan right you have to be on
[1:11:35] christ's ground which is the word you
[1:11:37] have to accept what he says
[1:11:38] and what he says alone amen you can't
[1:11:41] waver back and forth
[1:11:42] you've got to make a stand on what you
[1:11:44] believe but watch the effect of this
[1:11:46] decision
[1:11:47] this is the scripture now genesis 24 60
[1:11:50] and they blessed rebecca
[1:11:52] and said to her thou art our sister
[1:11:55] be thou the mother of thousands of
[1:11:57] millions
[1:11:59] and let thy seed possess the gate of
[1:12:01] those
[1:12:02] which hate them brother braham said this
[1:12:05] and rebecca which was to be the mother
[1:12:07] of this
[1:12:07] noted promised weighted son when she was
[1:12:11] called to the final test of a strange
[1:12:12] man that she had never seen before
[1:12:14] only she seen the working of the holy
[1:12:17] spirit he's saying she
[1:12:18] caught what was happening in this
[1:12:20] situation eleazar the angel of the
[1:12:22] lord's going before him and preparing
[1:12:24] away
[1:12:24] and she recognizes that this is not just
[1:12:27] happenstance
[1:12:28] this is not just a man come from
[1:12:29] somewhere and i happen to be the one
[1:12:31] that was there to to to do that work
[1:12:33] maybe she said i don't normally do that
[1:12:36] maybe she wouldn't have normally done
[1:12:37] that but she recognized something was
[1:12:39] going on brother brown says
[1:12:40] she saw the working of the holy spirit
[1:12:42] and when her parents could not fully
[1:12:44] decide whether she should go with this
[1:12:45] stranger or not
[1:12:46] to be the wife of a man she'd never seen
[1:12:49] she was brought
[1:12:50] to the final test we'll get the damsel
[1:12:52] and let her speak
[1:12:53] we'll hear from her mouth whether she
[1:12:55] will go yes or no
[1:12:57] he says that's the way it's brought to
[1:12:58] all the seed of god it's got to be your
[1:13:01] mouth
[1:13:01] god wants to hear from you amen your
[1:13:04] parents don't decide that you serve
[1:13:05] christ your spouse doesn't deserve that
[1:13:07] you
[1:13:09] doesn't make the decision that you serve
[1:13:10] christ but you have to say i will go
[1:13:13] i will marry him i have accepted what
[1:13:15] his servant said
[1:13:16] i believe that the gifts are a
[1:13:17] representation of a reality that's
[1:13:19] waiting for me and i will go and i will
[1:13:21] marry him and i will leave everything
[1:13:22] else behind
[1:13:24] he says so when she was put to the test
[1:13:26] she never hesitated a minute
[1:13:27] she said i will go i like that not
[1:13:30] let me make up my mind let me study it
[1:13:32] over she was
[1:13:34] fully persuaded that's the people that
[1:13:37] god can use when you're fully persuaded
[1:13:39] that god will keep his promise
[1:13:41] said i'll go and are people then
[1:13:44] so anointed maybe they did not know it
[1:13:46] but they prophesied as they laid their
[1:13:48] hands upon their sister
[1:13:50] and their daughter this beautiful young
[1:13:52] jewish girl as they placed her upon the
[1:13:54] camel and sent her to a strange land
[1:13:55] among strange people but there was
[1:13:58] something
[1:13:59] capital s on them they said let thy sea
[1:14:02] possess the gate of their enemy
[1:14:04] be thou the mother of thousands of
[1:14:07] millions
[1:14:08] can you see yourself there we're talking
[1:14:10] about somebody that prophesied over her
[1:14:12] that was an idol worshiper
[1:14:14] laban was an idol worshiper right
[1:14:16] remember when jacob left
[1:14:17] and they laban's following up because
[1:14:19] somebody stole his idols
[1:14:20] this is the kind of person we're talking
[1:14:22] about this is not a godly man
[1:14:24] but yet he prophesies over the bride
[1:14:27] and says the exact same thing that the
[1:14:29] lord had said to abraham already
[1:14:32] rebecca independent of isaac
[1:14:35] independent of abraham has her own
[1:14:38] confirmation of the exact same covenant
[1:14:40] to her
[1:14:40] so if you can't see yourself in christ
[1:14:42] today
[1:14:44] if you can't see yourself identify with
[1:14:45] him like we've talked about you should
[1:14:47] still be able to see yourself at least
[1:14:48] as rebecca
[1:14:49] and see that there is still a special
[1:14:51] promise the exact same promise given to
[1:14:52] abraham
[1:14:53] is given to rebecca before she ever
[1:14:55] marries amen that there's a prophecy
[1:14:57] over her
[1:14:58] that she will possess the gate of her
[1:15:00] enemies amen amen
[1:15:02] hallelujah like i said god's sitting
[1:15:03] there and this is way before the
[1:15:05] gentiles are called out and he's already
[1:15:07] said
[1:15:07] i've chosen you and i've picked you and
[1:15:09] i've made a way for you
[1:15:10] and you are going to be victorious and
[1:15:12] you're going to conquer everything that
[1:15:13] comes your way
[1:15:14] and you're going to be identified with
[1:15:16] me because of it amen
[1:15:18] it's the only way you can anyways you're
[1:15:19] not going to be a victor without christ
[1:15:21] and she couldn't be without isaac but
[1:15:23] because she made the decision the
[1:15:24] prophecy comes forth
[1:15:25] and links her to isaac completely amen
[1:15:28] even before she sees him
[1:15:29] amen romans 8 16 says the spirit itself
[1:15:33] beareth witness with our spirit
[1:15:35] that we are the children of god and if
[1:15:37] children then heirs
[1:15:38] heirs of god and joint heirs with christ
[1:15:41] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:15:43] that we may also be glorified together
[1:15:47] what's he saying everything that christ
[1:15:49] has is yours
[1:15:50] yes even to sitting in the throne with
[1:15:52] him
[1:15:53] he says you'll sit in the throne with me
[1:15:56] everything's under your feet
[1:15:57] everything that he's offered me i'm
[1:15:58] offering to you why you're my wife
[1:16:01] we're one we're the same thing so we get
[1:16:03] the same authority we get the same love
[1:16:05] we get the same joy we get the same
[1:16:06] peace we get the same power in our lives
[1:16:09] amen all of it's ours why because we're
[1:16:12] associated with him because we've
[1:16:13] committed to that marriage
[1:16:14] with him amen we're anointed exactly as
[1:16:17] he was
[1:16:17] just in a little lesser way amen
[1:16:21] brother branham hammered pretty hard
[1:16:23] there on rebecca he said she didn't stop
[1:16:25] to think about it
[1:16:26] she didn't stop to dwell on it why
[1:16:28] because intellectual capacity is never
[1:16:29] going to take you towards god
[1:16:31] right we're not going to sit here and
[1:16:33] and reason and logic our way into christ
[1:16:36] right especially in this age especially
[1:16:38] in this age you're never going to get
[1:16:39] there
[1:16:39] by just knowing what god has done it
[1:16:41] meant sitting in a message pew in a
[1:16:43] message church
[1:16:44] and listening to a preacher tell you
[1:16:45] what brother branham said or reading the
[1:16:47] scriptures and the light of that message
[1:16:48] is not going to take you in amen it got
[1:16:51] not just because you know it
[1:16:52] amen but you have to know the one that
[1:16:54] sent it there has to be a reality a
[1:16:55] living reality behind it
[1:16:58] but the brown says after two thousand
[1:16:59] years has passed two thousand years
[1:17:01] and still here he is in our midst the
[1:17:04] mighty conqueror that rent the veil and
[1:17:06] two
[1:17:06] that took every sickness every disease
[1:17:08] everything upon himself
[1:17:10] and bore our infirmities to the cross
[1:17:12] and our sickness and our diseases and
[1:17:14] triumphed over them and raised up for
[1:17:16] our justification
[1:17:18] and stands alive after two thousand
[1:17:20] years to manifest himself
[1:17:22] as a living jesus christ amongst the
[1:17:24] royal seed of abraham
[1:17:25] who are heirs of all things oh my those
[1:17:29] who go through the test
[1:17:31] get the promise of the word if you can
[1:17:33] believe the word then you are also the
[1:17:35] seed of abraham
[1:17:36] that's how you came to it why amen how
[1:17:39] by believing
[1:17:40] the word amen
[1:17:44] so where does that leave us he conquered
[1:17:46] everything we have access to everything
[1:17:48] that he has
[1:17:50] he's done everything for us so where
[1:17:51] does the bride stand today where does
[1:17:53] rebecca stand after that prophecy as
[1:17:54] soon as she's married to isaac she's in
[1:17:56] the channel now
[1:17:57] to receive every little thing amen what
[1:17:59] was isaacs is hers and she has the same
[1:18:01] power and authority now with her
[1:18:02] that isaac had under that promise
[1:18:05] brother branham says no matter how
[1:18:07] little
[1:18:07] you are every devil is under you
[1:18:12] how little you are whatever little faith
[1:18:15] you have whatever little experience you
[1:18:17] have whatever little reality you have
[1:18:19] if you have the holy spirit in your life
[1:18:21] he says every
[1:18:23] devil is under you every devil is under
[1:18:26] you
[1:18:27] why our great conqueror has conquered
[1:18:29] every sin
[1:18:31] everything every sickness even death
[1:18:33] itself that's right
[1:18:34] we are more than conquerors in him so
[1:18:37] like i said we're not battling
[1:18:38] to defeat the enemy we're battling to
[1:18:40] move them off our possession because
[1:18:42] they've already been defeated
[1:18:44] they have no weapon that can be formed
[1:18:45] against us that will stand that will
[1:18:47] prosper against us
[1:18:48] and all we're doing is pushing them off
[1:18:50] of our property
[1:18:51] out of the gates that god has already
[1:18:53] given us amen amen
[1:18:55] so what does the devil do if he's
[1:18:58] defeated what's he got to do
[1:18:59] to be successful he's got to make you
[1:19:02] think that you don't have a right to the
[1:19:04] land he's on
[1:19:05] he's got to make you think that it has
[1:19:07] something to do with you
[1:19:08] rather than him right he's got to make
[1:19:10] you think that you're not worthy
[1:19:12] that you're a sinner that you have
[1:19:14] faults that you have flaws and on the
[1:19:16] basis of who you are you have no right
[1:19:17] to be where he is standing
[1:19:19] right he wants to get you looking at him
[1:19:22] brother branham continues he says he
[1:19:24] will conquer the gates of his enemy
[1:19:26] to those seed he stands here alive to
[1:19:28] vindicate himself to who
[1:19:30] those predestinated seeds that can see
[1:19:32] it he conquered that who after his test
[1:19:35] of the promise of the word
[1:19:36] they were sealed by the holy ghost into
[1:19:38] the body of christ
[1:19:39] to them confirmed what hebrews 13 8 to
[1:19:42] be so what is hebrews 13
[1:19:43] 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:19:46] and forever
[1:19:47] they are sealed in there by the holy
[1:19:48] ghost that holy ghost which was by
[1:19:51] abraham foresaw it and by faith he
[1:19:53] believed it
[1:19:54] and now we receive it looking back to
[1:19:56] the promise of what he said
[1:19:58] and john 14 12 is made confirmed in
[1:20:00] these last days by the rhythm conqueror
[1:20:02] himself
[1:20:03] which john 14 12 he that believeth on me
[1:20:06] the works that i do shall he do also and
[1:20:08] greater works than these shall he do
[1:20:09] because i go to my father amen
[1:20:11] that's what he said earlier he says he's
[1:20:12] going to continue the work in the
[1:20:14] gentile bride amen
[1:20:16] not some system but a person christ the
[1:20:18] conqueror
[1:20:19] not my church and again not my message
[1:20:22] church right let's put ourselves in
[1:20:25] there let's not pretend that there isn't
[1:20:26] a denominational following in the
[1:20:28] message
[1:20:29] amen don't just say because i attend
[1:20:30] here that makes it all good
[1:20:32] no individually it has to be good not
[1:20:34] just as a group
[1:20:35] not my church not my baptist church or
[1:20:37] your presbyterian methodist or the
[1:20:39] pentecostals
[1:20:40] not by that but by jesus christ he lives
[1:20:42] today
[1:20:43] he rolls over that for our justification
[1:20:46] and because he lives we he said we live
[1:20:49] also men don't by live by bread alone
[1:20:51] but by
[1:20:51] every word not part of the word right
[1:20:54] and we've got a fully open word today
[1:20:55] there's no room for ignorance now
[1:20:57] everything's been revealed that we have
[1:20:58] need of there is no room for ignorance
[1:21:00] amen there's no excuse for it
[1:21:03] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:21:04] mouth of god i am the resurrection and
[1:21:06] the life he that believeth in me
[1:21:08] though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:21:10] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:21:12] shall never die believe us thou this
[1:21:15] take the gate of every enemy amen
[1:21:18] it's all on the basis that you have
[1:21:19] christ in you the hope of glory amen
[1:21:22] amen but when you start reading that
[1:21:24] title deed
[1:21:27] how many of us have ever looked at the
[1:21:28] deeds for our property you look on the
[1:21:30] deed it's very specific about what's
[1:21:32] yours isn't it
[1:21:33] it gives the location it gives the exact
[1:21:36] points
[1:21:37] latitude longitude right they have a
[1:21:38] surveyor comes in and he marks out
[1:21:40] everything and he gives you to the
[1:21:42] inch where your property is and when you
[1:21:45] can read that you can see this is all
[1:21:46] mine
[1:21:47] if it's within that boundary it's all
[1:21:49] mine and as long as my name's on the
[1:21:51] title deed
[1:21:52] i can protect that property i have
[1:21:54] rights with that property not the same
[1:21:55] as they do in the us unfortunately
[1:21:57] but i have rights to that property and
[1:21:59] nobody is allowed to come on that
[1:22:00] property
[1:22:00] unless i say so amen right and as long
[1:22:03] as my name's on that title deed
[1:22:05] then i'm good to go and anything that's
[1:22:07] marked in there or within that belongs
[1:22:09] to me and nobody else can take that away
[1:22:10] nobody else can come in and say that's
[1:22:12] mine nobody else can come in and say i
[1:22:13] have a right to that
[1:22:14] if that's a clear abstract title deed
[1:22:16] and there's no liens on it there's
[1:22:18] nothing against it from anybody else
[1:22:20] that belongs to you and the borders are
[1:22:21] clearly marked for you to say
[1:22:23] this belongs to me and when we start to
[1:22:26] read through the bible
[1:22:28] and he says every promise in the book is
[1:22:30] yours
[1:22:31] right if you can read it in here it
[1:22:33] belongs to you
[1:22:35] anything you read in here belongs to you
[1:22:37] if it is for the gentile bride and we're
[1:22:38] not talking about what happens after we
[1:22:40] get off the earth and that
[1:22:41] but every redemptive promise in this
[1:22:43] book belongs to you if you have the holy
[1:22:44] ghost
[1:22:45] amen that's what he promised to us
[1:22:48] but abraham says this he says now we are
[1:22:50] more than conquerors through him that
[1:22:51] loved us and give his life for us
[1:22:54] being the royal seed of abraham with the
[1:22:56] same spirit of god in us that was in him
[1:22:58] we are more than conquerors every great
[1:23:01] every gate
[1:23:02] has been conquered for us amen he says
[1:23:05] you're thinking about
[1:23:07] taking the enemy's gates but he's saying
[1:23:08] they're already conquered
[1:23:10] they've already been knocked down they
[1:23:11] can't be closed against you somebody has
[1:23:13] to stand in there
[1:23:14] they've been defeated and they haven't
[1:23:15] been rebuilt somebody's just going to
[1:23:17] try and stand there and pretend that
[1:23:18] they've got a place to stay
[1:23:20] that they have a right to be there the
[1:23:21] only thing we have to do
[1:23:23] is possess it it's already conquered
[1:23:25] sickness is conquered death is conquered
[1:23:27] hell is conquered the grave is conquered
[1:23:29] everything is conquered and we hold the
[1:23:31] keys by his grace
[1:23:32] then he puts it in our lap and says are
[1:23:34] you afraid to stick them in the lock
[1:23:36] what
[1:23:37] the promises and say i come in the name
[1:23:40] of jesus christ
[1:23:41] he says ask the father anything in my
[1:23:43] name
[1:23:44] i love him he says amen what would
[1:23:47] trigger you to do that
[1:23:48] what triggers you to take the promise of
[1:23:50] god and put it on your lips to put it
[1:23:51] into the lock
[1:23:52] and say you can't be here what is this
[1:23:55] that pulls us out of our comfort zone
[1:23:57] that asks us to do something
[1:23:59] supernatural like this and take our
[1:24:00] faith and put it on our lips
[1:24:02] and say lord i'm going to claim it what
[1:24:04] is it that does that
[1:24:06] brother branham says when it's revealed
[1:24:08] to you
[1:24:09] that's the answer was revealed to you
[1:24:12] you can't make it happen it's got to be
[1:24:14] revealed to you
[1:24:15] then you don't even consider anything
[1:24:17] else how impossible it is
[1:24:19] don't consider what the doctor said you
[1:24:20] don't consider what mama said what papa
[1:24:22] said what the preacher said
[1:24:24] what anybody else said you just consider
[1:24:27] what god said
[1:24:29] so where does it say in there you'll get
[1:24:31] healing when you're worthy of healing
[1:24:33] you'll get deliverance when you're
[1:24:34] worthy of deliverance you'll get love
[1:24:35] when you're worthy of love you'll get
[1:24:36] joy when you're worthy of joy
[1:24:39] there's nothing in there that has
[1:24:40] jonathan corlett written as the
[1:24:42] requirement for any of these things
[1:24:44] he did it it's a finished work and so i
[1:24:46] can't look at myself in any of this
[1:24:48] i mean if i've got a check of heaven in
[1:24:50] there it's not my name on the bottom
[1:24:52] right hand corner is it
[1:24:53] it's jesus christ for every one of them
[1:24:55] jesus christ jesus christ and it's
[1:24:56] written in his blood
[1:24:58] and so when i start looking at that and
[1:25:00] that check why would i start saying but
[1:25:01] i'm not worthy to cash the check
[1:25:04] the one that gave it to me deemed me
[1:25:05] worthy that's why i get to
[1:25:08] take it to the bank of heaven is because
[1:25:09] he gave me the check and said write in
[1:25:11] whatever amount you want and i'll give
[1:25:12] it to you
[1:25:13] and then the bank of heaven has
[1:25:14] unlimited funds
[1:25:16] amen the government of canada thinks
[1:25:18] they too the bank of heaven
[1:25:20] does right cattle on a thousand hills is
[1:25:22] not going to run out for us
[1:25:24] so if he's giving it to you if he's
[1:25:25] deemed you worthy by giving you the
[1:25:27] check then why are you saying
[1:25:28] i'm not worthy to cash the check amen it
[1:25:31] has nothing to do with you it has
[1:25:32] nothing to do with me
[1:25:34] amen says if you would realize that your
[1:25:37] sons and daughters of god
[1:25:38] by the death of christ yes
[1:25:42] no i went too far i think
[1:25:45] oh
[1:25:48] yes if you would realize that you're
[1:25:50] sons and daughters of god by the death
[1:25:51] of christ and you have a checkbook in
[1:25:53] your hand to draw any
[1:25:54] dividends out of calvary that christ
[1:25:56] died for amen that's right don't be
[1:25:58] afraid put it to work let your faith get
[1:26:00] started one time
[1:26:02] and turn it loose let your faith get
[1:26:05] started one time and turn it loose
[1:26:07] and you watch god answer that and then
[1:26:09] all of a sudden that builds up a little
[1:26:10] bit more
[1:26:11] a little bit more a little bit more and
[1:26:13] all of a sudden the next promise is
[1:26:14] rolling your way and you're saying i'll
[1:26:15] take that one to the bank
[1:26:17] right and all of a sudden you start
[1:26:20] writing checks
[1:26:22] and writing checks and writing checks
[1:26:24] why because he's giving it to you
[1:26:26] he's given it to you to write those
[1:26:27] checks amen
[1:26:31] third john verse two says beloved i wish
[1:26:33] above all things that thou mayest
[1:26:35] prosper
[1:26:36] and be in health and all the prosperity
[1:26:38] gospel people said amen
[1:26:41] right because that's where they look
[1:26:43] prosper and be in good health
[1:26:45] but he says even as thy soul prospers
[1:26:48] right john ties health and prosperity to
[1:26:51] spiritual wellness
[1:26:52] and we've just spent three services
[1:26:53] talking about spiritual growth
[1:26:55] and maturing and john says if you're
[1:26:58] doing that
[1:26:59] then you don't have to worry about the
[1:27:01] prosperity and health because if god's
[1:27:03] growing you that means that the
[1:27:04] prosperity and wealth is going to follow
[1:27:06] and health is going to follow along
[1:27:08] we're not talking prosperity gospel with
[1:27:09] lots of money in the bank and nice cars
[1:27:11] and this and that and the other
[1:27:12] but your needs are going to be met right
[1:27:15] and now remember we're talking about
[1:27:16] children of god now
[1:27:18] because rank sinners could come up in
[1:27:19] brother branham's services
[1:27:21] and get healed because why there's a
[1:27:23] different requirement for them
[1:27:25] it's always belief you have to have
[1:27:27] faith but for them he made no
[1:27:29] requirement
[1:27:30] of are you a christian necessarily there
[1:27:32] were people walked up there with
[1:27:33] diseases that they only got by doing
[1:27:35] things they shouldn't be doing
[1:27:36] right but he they would be healed
[1:27:38] because it was a part of that ministry
[1:27:40] to give people the faith to do it but
[1:27:42] now when we talk about a child of god
[1:27:44] now we've got to deal with conscience
[1:27:46] we've got to deal with are you in your
[1:27:47] position are you on your land
[1:27:49] because if you're out there like the
[1:27:50] prodigal son right
[1:27:53] there's no hope for that prodigal son
[1:27:54] until he comes back to the father he's
[1:27:55] got to be in his place he's got to be on
[1:27:57] his land
[1:27:58] in his position but he says look if
[1:28:00] you're spiritually prospering if you're
[1:28:02] doing well with god
[1:28:03] if your relation with god is
[1:28:05] relationship with god is open and clear
[1:28:07] then you have nothing to worry about you
[1:28:09] have nothing to worry about
[1:28:10] he's got everything taken care of and i
[1:28:13] would that you prosper and be in health
[1:28:15] even as god continues to grow you and
[1:28:17] he'll match that with your growth
[1:28:18] because if he goes too fast on the
[1:28:20] prosperity and health side sometimes
[1:28:21] then we run away from our maturity and
[1:28:23] we get ahead of him man
[1:28:26] what is it when you start seeking the
[1:28:28] kingdom of god and you stay seeking the
[1:28:30] kingdom of god and he says all these
[1:28:31] other things i'll add to you
[1:28:33] everything will add unto you amen not a
[1:28:35] thing left behind he says
[1:28:36] all these things will be added unto you
[1:28:38] if you'll seek first the kingdom of god
[1:28:42] says he conquered death in hell he
[1:28:44] conquered what the others couldn't
[1:28:45] conquer
[1:28:46] because they're of the natural seed
[1:28:49] we're all of the natural seed if we try
[1:28:51] to do it ourselves and that's what he's
[1:28:52] saying if you try and do it yourself you
[1:28:53] won't conquer
[1:28:54] that's when you fall back on the natural
[1:28:56] seed instead of the spiritual seed
[1:28:57] inside of you
[1:28:58] he says this is the spiritual seed he
[1:29:01] conquered the gate of the grave
[1:29:03] and rose up on the third day for our
[1:29:04] justification now we are more than
[1:29:06] conquerors and we just
[1:29:08] walk right into it as an inheritance
[1:29:11] again we're not walking in to battle for
[1:29:13] it
[1:29:13] he says walk into it as an inheritance
[1:29:15] you're reading the title deed
[1:29:17] you're reading the will and it says
[1:29:18] jonathan corlett has the right to the
[1:29:20] healing in the name of the lord jesus
[1:29:22] christ
[1:29:22] under the shed blood of calvary so he
[1:29:24] says you walk into that as an
[1:29:26] inheritance
[1:29:27] your name's written there and therefore
[1:29:28] you have a right to it it's yours to
[1:29:30] inherit
[1:29:31] more than conquerors now we're dealing
[1:29:32] with the defeated enemy
[1:29:34] sickness is defeated death is defeated
[1:29:36] hell is defeated everything's defeated
[1:29:38] he says oh my i wish i was twice my size
[1:29:41] now maybe
[1:29:42] i feel twice as good we are disputing
[1:29:45] with
[1:29:45] a conquered enemy amen that ought to
[1:29:48] give us an encouragement tonight that as
[1:29:49] we deal with these things
[1:29:51] that it is a conquered enemy and all
[1:29:53] it's trying to do is bluff you out of
[1:29:55] your position
[1:29:56] and bluff you out of recognizing that he
[1:29:59] doesn't have
[1:30:00] anything to stand on he's trusting you
[1:30:02] to forget what god has said
[1:30:04] what god has done what god has promised
[1:30:07] and to stand there and somehow look at
[1:30:08] him
[1:30:09] as if he's bigger and stronger or that
[1:30:11] you are smaller and weaker amen
[1:30:13] look at yourself or see him in a light
[1:30:15] that he really doesn't have
[1:30:17] and then brother ron spencer talks about
[1:30:18] saying boo devil you know i think
[1:30:20] brother brown
[1:30:21] didn't brother brown tell the story
[1:30:22] about boo devil and the devil was
[1:30:23] talking to the man and he kept getting
[1:30:25] smaller but then he said boo devil back
[1:30:26] and all of a sudden the devil started
[1:30:27] getting smaller
[1:30:29] right where's your faith going to go is
[1:30:31] it going to go against him or is it
[1:30:32] going to go against yourself
[1:30:35] ephesians 6 10 says finally my brethren
[1:30:37] be strong in the lord and in the power
[1:30:39] of his might
[1:30:40] but on the whole armor of god that ye
[1:30:41] may be able to withstand
[1:30:43] against the wiles of the devil why he's
[1:30:46] trying to trick you
[1:30:47] right you think he comes in with force
[1:30:49] but the force is there to take your
[1:30:51] your mind and take your heart off the
[1:30:52] idea that he doesn't have anything on
[1:30:54] you
[1:30:55] that he can't do anything he's trying to
[1:30:56] make himself look big and strong
[1:30:58] and muscular and bring in as much
[1:31:00] pressure as he can so you don't look at
[1:31:02] that and say
[1:31:02] whether there's one of you or whether
[1:31:04] there's a million of you you're all
[1:31:05] defeated
[1:31:06] and guess what it's easy to beat a
[1:31:08] defeated enemy because you're already
[1:31:09] defeated
[1:31:10] so get out he's trying to get you off
[1:31:12] the idea that you stand there
[1:31:14] as a victorious son or daughter of god
[1:31:17] amen so our battle is not
[1:31:18] natural right our battle is supernatural
[1:31:22] and its influences and principalities
[1:31:24] and powers
[1:31:26] amen and the rulers of darkness of the
[1:31:28] world against spiritual wickedness
[1:31:30] in high places spiritual wickedness
[1:31:32] remember when daniel was praying and the
[1:31:33] answer was delayed because there was a
[1:31:35] battle of angels in heaven
[1:31:37] he says i was delayed we heard the
[1:31:39] prayer your prayer was heard on the
[1:31:40] first day but it took him weeks to get
[1:31:42] to you
[1:31:42] because i had to fight my way through
[1:31:44] demon powers amen
[1:31:46] it's a spiritual battle to get those
[1:31:48] answers through sometimes
[1:31:49] amen there's something else that's going
[1:31:50] against us so when we feel those things
[1:31:52] well up what is it
[1:31:53] that satanic power trying to influence
[1:31:56] us to do what we ought not to do to push
[1:31:58] us off of our ground and onto his ground
[1:32:00] because the minute we get onto his
[1:32:02] ground he's no longer defeated
[1:32:03] because he has a right to his ground and
[1:32:06] then we talked last week about politics
[1:32:08] right you start getting dragged into
[1:32:09] politics at satan's ground and you're
[1:32:11] going to get beat
[1:32:11] up there you start dwelling on education
[1:32:14] you start looking at these different
[1:32:15] things and all of a sudden you're on his
[1:32:17] land
[1:32:17] and he's got a right to beat the snot
[1:32:19] out of you because you're not supposed
[1:32:21] to be there
[1:32:22] get back on the word get back in your
[1:32:24] position as a son or daughter of god
[1:32:26] and that's where he's defeated but you
[1:32:27] start going into bar rooms trying to
[1:32:28] beat up satan look out
[1:32:30] right you start trying to do it through
[1:32:32] your tv look out
[1:32:34] that's not where you belong amen step
[1:32:35] onto god's word and that's where he's
[1:32:37] defeated amen
[1:32:40] amen we're talking about worthiness
[1:32:44] very familiar scripture revelations five
[1:32:47] and i saw in the hand of him that sat on
[1:32:49] the book
[1:32:49] on the throne a book written within and
[1:32:51] with and on the backside sealed with
[1:32:53] seven seals
[1:32:54] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:32:56] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:32:58] the book
[1:32:59] and to loose the seals thereof and
[1:33:01] nobody said our names
[1:33:03] nobody said our names
[1:33:06] and no man in heaven nor on earth
[1:33:08] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:33:10] the book neither to look thereon
[1:33:11] and i went much because no man was found
[1:33:13] worthy to open and read the book neither
[1:33:15] to look thereon
[1:33:16] but brahm says that's the lamb's book of
[1:33:17] life that's a title deed to the earth
[1:33:20] amen to the seed of god and one of the
[1:33:23] elders said unto me weep not behold the
[1:33:25] lion of the tribe of judah the root of
[1:33:26] david
[1:33:27] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[1:33:29] loose the seven seals thereof
[1:33:31] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:33:33] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[1:33:34] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:33:36] had been slain
[1:33:37] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:33:39] are the seven spirits of god sent forth
[1:33:41] to the earth
[1:33:41] amen we saw one in our age that was the
[1:33:44] seven messengers
[1:33:45] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:33:47] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:33:48] throne
[1:33:49] and when he had taken the book the four
[1:33:51] beasts and the four and twenty elders
[1:33:52] fell down before the lamb
[1:33:54] having every one of them harps and
[1:33:55] golden vials full of odors
[1:33:57] which are the prayers of saints and they
[1:33:59] sung a new song
[1:34:00] saying who's worthy thou
[1:34:04] art worthy to take the book and to open
[1:34:06] the seals thereof
[1:34:08] for thou was slain and hast redeemed
[1:34:11] us this is the only place we appear here
[1:34:14] thou hast redeemed us to god
[1:34:18] by thy blood out of every kindred and
[1:34:21] tongue
[1:34:21] and nation and people and nation
[1:34:25] if you're looking for worthiness that's
[1:34:26] the place you find it that's right there
[1:34:28] he was worthy to open that lamb's book
[1:34:30] of life he was worthy to take the
[1:34:32] title deed and say i'm coming to claim
[1:34:34] every single one of those that belongs
[1:34:35] to me
[1:34:36] amen and within that is every divine
[1:34:38] promise of god
[1:34:40] right within there is everything that he
[1:34:41] promised to us as well and he takes that
[1:34:43] down he's given that to the bride
[1:34:44] because we saw later
[1:34:46] what does he tell john he says go and
[1:34:47] take the book out of him that has it
[1:34:49] amen and he took it and he ate it he
[1:34:52] made it a part of himself amen
[1:34:55] so i didn't have any part there except
[1:34:56] to be the redeemed one
[1:34:58] right i was wasted i was ruined i was
[1:35:00] hopeless i was
[1:35:01] i was weak i couldn't do anything when
[1:35:04] we look at what's done here it's not
[1:35:05] because we had any sufficiency in
[1:35:07] ourselves
[1:35:08] but it is all christ from start to
[1:35:09] finish amen and it was god that did it
[1:35:11] it was christ that took the book and
[1:35:13] it's christ that's come
[1:35:14] now to redeem a bride amen amen brother
[1:35:17] braham says this that's the way it is
[1:35:18] today
[1:35:19] we're guilty unworthy and should die
[1:35:23] that's us guilty unworthy should die
[1:35:25] we're not worthy of living we're not
[1:35:27] worthy to come to christ
[1:35:28] we're not worthy to ask anything but god
[1:35:31] never looks at your unworthiness
[1:35:33] he looked at the lamb now if he can't
[1:35:35] find no fault in christ then you're free
[1:35:38] see he died in your stead now if there's
[1:35:40] any fault with him you're not free yet
[1:35:42] but god doesn't examine you he examines
[1:35:44] the land you say i'm not worthy to walk
[1:35:46] out of this wheelchair tonight this is
[1:35:47] in a prayer line he's talking to a man
[1:35:49] that's sitting there in a wheelchair and
[1:35:51] he's saying i'm not worthy to walk out
[1:35:53] of this wheelchair tonight
[1:35:54] that's right you're not but god doesn't
[1:35:56] examine you he examined
[1:35:58] past tense christ and if he's worthy
[1:36:02] then you can walk
[1:36:05] see that's right depends on what you
[1:36:07] think about it
[1:36:10] don't say well the doctors say i'll
[1:36:11] never be well that's what the doctor
[1:36:14] says because that's what doctors say
[1:36:15] now the man's a scientific man he looks
[1:36:17] the way nature's running and he sees you
[1:36:19] can never be well
[1:36:20] that scientifically shows him that and
[1:36:22] that's what he's looking at
[1:36:24] now if you look at the same thing you'll
[1:36:26] never be well
[1:36:27] but don't look at what he said don't
[1:36:29] look at how you're diminishing
[1:36:32] the man sitting there and every day he's
[1:36:34] getting worse and worse and
[1:36:35] shriveling up in these different things
[1:36:37] he says don't look at how you're
[1:36:38] diminishing
[1:36:39] but look at your sacrifice that's it and
[1:36:41] remember your abraham seed and heirs
[1:36:43] with him
[1:36:44] and if you are stay with the promise
[1:36:47] accept him as your healer
[1:36:49] just stay right there nothing we can do
[1:36:52] to deserve this
[1:36:53] it's all by grace amen when christ died
[1:36:57] at calvary that's what gave us the right
[1:36:58] to take this back no
[1:37:00] amen it's all by grace from start to
[1:37:01] finish
[1:37:04] but remember we're talking about
[1:37:06] children we're talking about the royal
[1:37:08] seed of god
[1:37:09] amen like i said we're not talking about
[1:37:10] some joe schmoe that walks off the
[1:37:12] street
[1:37:12] we're talking about people that god is
[1:37:14] growing and maturing and bringing to a
[1:37:16] place
[1:37:17] amen where he can trust them with
[1:37:18] everything in his word and brother
[1:37:20] banham says
[1:37:21] that there's always a trial in these
[1:37:23] things for us
[1:37:24] this is at the very beginning of
[1:37:27] possessing the enemy's gates
[1:37:28] listen what he says he says now i would
[1:37:30] like to take if it should be called a
[1:37:31] text my subject this morning first
[1:37:34] testing before promised gates
[1:37:37] and the subject is possessing the
[1:37:39] enemy's gates
[1:37:40] but he says testing's first possession
[1:37:42] second god had been testing the
[1:37:44] patriarch because he had given him a
[1:37:46] promise
[1:37:47] and when god makes a promise he wants to
[1:37:49] be sure that the person
[1:37:50] is worthy of the promise before he
[1:37:53] fulfills what he said
[1:37:55] or what he promises
[1:37:58] now we just said you're not worthy and
[1:38:00] then brother brahms says
[1:38:02] he was testing abraham to see if he was
[1:38:03] worthy so when my writer was
[1:38:05] brother branham right we'll see what
[1:38:08] that means amen
[1:38:09] but this isn't the kind of worthy that
[1:38:11] we are talking about like abraham you've
[1:38:13] done so good and you've done so well and
[1:38:15] you live your life this way and you say
[1:38:17] this and you say that
[1:38:18] because when we look at abraham he
[1:38:19] wasn't worthy in that sense we covered
[1:38:21] that exhaustively before
[1:38:22] abraham made plenty of mistakes so this
[1:38:24] is not the worthiness he's talking about
[1:38:26] but listen to what brother branham says
[1:38:27] here
[1:38:28] he says so abraham had been promised
[1:38:30] through his seed that the whole world
[1:38:32] would be blessed
[1:38:33] that he would have a son and this son
[1:38:36] out of him should come forth a seed that
[1:38:38] would bless the whole earth and abraham
[1:38:40] when the promise was given to him
[1:38:41] was 75 years old and sarah his wife was
[1:38:44] 65 years old
[1:38:45] but the bible tells us that abraham
[1:38:47] staggered not at the promise of god
[1:38:49] through unbelief
[1:38:50] but was strong giving praise to god now
[1:38:53] we start to see what worthiness means
[1:38:54] and god time after time tested him but
[1:38:57] he had
[1:38:58] come to that final test before the
[1:39:00] blessing was going to happen
[1:39:01] now he's talking about taking isaac up
[1:39:03] to sacrifice him he's already got the
[1:39:05] promise in hand and then god says no
[1:39:06] we're going to test you one more time
[1:39:08] to see if you'll be worthy
[1:39:12] and that's the way it is with all the
[1:39:13] seed of abraham god gives us that final
[1:39:15] test
[1:39:16] just before he gives the promise he's
[1:39:18] talking the fullness of the promise
[1:39:21] and if it was possible i'd like to say
[1:39:23] something here personally
[1:39:24] but i'll withhold that i wish sometimes
[1:39:27] he didn't tell us that because you're
[1:39:28] like what
[1:39:29] what did he hide we need to know we need
[1:39:33] to know today
[1:39:34] that final test to see how you'll react
[1:39:37] upon it
[1:39:38] and when he had given abraham this test
[1:39:40] he found abraham
[1:39:41] just as true as when he started
[1:39:45] that's abraham's worthiness there that's
[1:39:47] what he's talking about
[1:39:49] what a blessing it would be this morning
[1:39:51] if we who take his promise of healing
[1:39:53] would stand just as true as we did
[1:39:56] when we stood here and accepted it
[1:40:00] no matter what the doctor said stand
[1:40:02] just
[1:40:03] as true amen so abraham's worthiness was
[1:40:06] not
[1:40:07] did he live a good life it was did he
[1:40:09] believe and did he keep believing
[1:40:11] and even after the promise did he hold
[1:40:13] on to that all the way until
[1:40:15] god confirmed it the final time did he
[1:40:17] believe believe
[1:40:18] believe believe believe and did he
[1:40:20] change anything off of that
[1:40:22] no he believed he believed he believed
[1:40:24] and that's the same test we faced today
[1:40:26] for any promise of god
[1:40:27] amen we look at this like i said we're
[1:40:29] going to take a rapture
[1:40:31] you have to believe you're going to take
[1:40:32] a rapture and your faithfulness your
[1:40:35] worthiness is what god's looking at
[1:40:37] there is do you believe
[1:40:38] despite the impossibility of it because
[1:40:41] there's only been a couple did it before
[1:40:42] and none of us have talked to them
[1:40:44] we're going to do the same thing so are
[1:40:46] you worthy of the promise of the rapture
[1:40:49] is will you keep believing it when
[1:40:51] things get worse
[1:40:52] and worse and people fall away and
[1:40:54] people fall away there's going to come a
[1:40:56] greater falling away from this message i
[1:40:57] guarantee you
[1:40:59] there is going to come more and more and
[1:41:00] more fall away scripture says
[1:41:02] brother jail quotes it time and time
[1:41:04] again when the son of man comes will he
[1:41:05] find faith on the earth
[1:41:06] it's only going to be a few that hold
[1:41:08] through to the end and that is their
[1:41:09] worthiness is that they were
[1:41:11] faithful and they overcame amen amen
[1:41:14] amen
[1:41:15] think of john ryan do you remember john
[1:41:17] ryan that brother branham talked about
[1:41:18] he was a blind man
[1:41:19] that came up and he was prayed for him
[1:41:21] brother branham said
[1:41:22] you're healed john ryan comes back the
[1:41:25] next day
[1:41:26] still blind and says i thought you said
[1:41:28] i was healed
[1:41:30] brother brahm said i thought you said
[1:41:31] you believed you were healed
[1:41:35] you're stuck right either you believe or
[1:41:37] you don't so he said yes i believe so
[1:41:38] he's out on the corner he's selling
[1:41:40] prayers
[1:41:40] or he's selling papers and he's saying
[1:41:42] he's talking about his healing how the
[1:41:44] lord healed him of being blind
[1:41:45] and people are coming up and i'm sure
[1:41:46] they're doing this and doing the punch
[1:41:48] to the face and really blinking all that
[1:41:49] and he can't see he's blind as a bat for
[1:41:52] two weeks he's blind as a bat
[1:41:54] now there were plenty of people walk
[1:41:56] through that that prayer line
[1:41:57] that were healed and healed instantly
[1:42:00] but john ryan for some reason wasn't
[1:42:02] why we don't know god's sovereign i
[1:42:05] trust that he was a child of god
[1:42:06] and god was putting his faith to the
[1:42:08] test that's prob that would be the way i
[1:42:10] would answer it
[1:42:11] but for two weeks he endures people
[1:42:13] making fun of him and saying
[1:42:14] if you're healed why can't you see
[1:42:17] there's a disconnect here
[1:42:19] what you're saying does not match up
[1:42:20] with what you are
[1:42:22] how often do we see that how often do we
[1:42:25] see that
[1:42:27] and then what he's sitting in a barber's
[1:42:29] chair getting a haircut or a shave i
[1:42:31] think it was a shave
[1:42:32] and his eyes come open like that
[1:42:36] he testified for two weeks he took the
[1:42:38] abuse he took the teasing
[1:42:40] he took being made fun of he took being
[1:42:42] called out probably called a hypocrite
[1:42:44] right these christians they're so crazy
[1:42:47] right look at him he can't see he knows
[1:42:49] he can't see
[1:42:50] but he's telling us that he's healed
[1:42:52] that he can see
[1:42:54] right he's saying i hear all about my
[1:42:56] healing
[1:42:57] he's telling the crowds he's not just
[1:42:59] telling his spouse or his church buddies
[1:43:01] he's on the corner saying i'm healed and
[1:43:03] they can see that he's not healed
[1:43:05] as in he does not have his eyesight and
[1:43:07] then two weeks later
[1:43:08] i don't know where god gives him his
[1:43:10] sight why testing
[1:43:12] are you worthy of what i'm about to give
[1:43:13] you and he does that with his children
[1:43:15] that ought to be a confirmation to john
[1:43:17] ryan
[1:43:17] that there was something special in him
[1:43:19] that was maybe different from some of
[1:43:20] those others because god tested him
[1:43:22] before giving him the fullness of that
[1:43:23] healing amen
[1:43:25] like that quote brother paul sent me the
[1:43:26] other day he said what
[1:43:28] if you say this mountain be moved and
[1:43:29] don't doubt it in your heart it's going
[1:43:30] to move
[1:43:31] he said it would move but he didn't say
[1:43:33] when
[1:43:35] and your worthiness is will you hold to
[1:43:36] that promise until that mountain moves
[1:43:39] amen amen amen why because he's looking
[1:43:42] for victory in us
[1:43:44] before he brings victory to us amen he's
[1:43:47] got to get the victory on the inside
[1:43:48] and then it pushes itself out and
[1:43:50] manifests itself on the outside amen
[1:43:52] he says if you're abraham's seed you'll
[1:43:54] look at the promise of god
[1:43:56] what god said to do about it that's it
[1:43:58] abraham's seed we look
[1:44:00] at a promise i don't care how many falls
[1:44:02] this way and how many falls that way
[1:44:04] the promise remains true why
[1:44:07] the faithfulness is not judged by
[1:44:09] whether they stick to it it's does god
[1:44:11] stick to it
[1:44:12] you've got to come through those
[1:44:14] testings
[1:44:15] see yes abraham first tested then sealed
[1:44:19] then given the promise that his siege
[1:44:20] should possess the enemy's gate
[1:44:22] i like that then they possessed their
[1:44:24] enemies gates after
[1:44:26] they were tested and then we talked
[1:44:28] about john ryan and how that promise
[1:44:29] didn't come easily
[1:44:30] when you look at promised children they
[1:44:32] don't come very easily in the scripture
[1:44:34] right you look at isaac took 25 years
[1:44:36] and a body change
[1:44:38] right after that rebecca rebecca has a
[1:44:41] promise of thousands of millions of
[1:44:43] people coming down through her lineage
[1:44:45] and isaac has to pray for her in order
[1:44:48] for her to have the baby
[1:44:50] how does that make any sense god gives a
[1:44:51] promise and then she's barren
[1:44:54] god gives a promise and then he doesn't
[1:44:56] give them what he promised
[1:44:57] and isaac has to specifically go to god
[1:45:00] and pray for her to have a baby before
[1:45:02] she would have a baby you think she'd be
[1:45:03] fertile myrtle
[1:45:04] you think that she'd be popping them out
[1:45:06] left right and center because that's the
[1:45:07] promise
[1:45:08] but it's not he has to go and pray for
[1:45:10] the promise to come forth
[1:45:12] and then god blesses her with the twins
[1:45:14] and only one of them is a child of god
[1:45:17] right she's got a 50 win ratio
[1:45:20] right gives her the promise and she
[1:45:21] still has to deal with a child of hell
[1:45:24] amen amen but look at that
[1:45:27] and i want you to gather something from
[1:45:28] it because this will if you can sink
[1:45:30] into this it'll help you when you're
[1:45:32] dealing with something
[1:45:33] when you're waiting and that's that the
[1:45:35] trial the length of the trial
[1:45:38] has nothing to do with the amount of
[1:45:40] faith that you have
[1:45:42] because by all standards abraham had no
[1:45:44] faith because it took 25 years for the
[1:45:46] promised child to come
[1:45:48] amen elizabeth remember when she was
[1:45:51] pregnant with john the baptist she gets
[1:45:52] pregnant in her old age
[1:45:54] and then for six months that baby
[1:45:56] doesn't move and the first time it moves
[1:45:58] is when the name of jesus is first
[1:45:59] spoken
[1:46:00] amen amen you'll see that the trial of
[1:46:02] your faith can be long
[1:46:04] or it can be short but it's not because
[1:46:05] of your faith that you get healing that
[1:46:07] you get deliverance quick
[1:46:08] or that it takes a while it's up to god
[1:46:10] to determine what that timeline is
[1:46:12] because again
[1:46:13] he's working to grow and mature his
[1:46:14] people amen so if he chooses long
[1:46:17] are you going to stay worthy if he
[1:46:19] chooses short we say praise the lord
[1:46:21] right we love a short quick answer don't
[1:46:23] we but if he takes a long time to do it
[1:46:25] that doesn't make him any less god and
[1:46:26] that doesn't make you any less a child
[1:46:28] of god
[1:46:28] amen if you're out of your position if
[1:46:30] your conscience is bothering you you've
[1:46:32] got to make those things right because
[1:46:33] god deals with his children different
[1:46:34] than he deals with an unbeliever in
[1:46:36] these situations
[1:46:37] but if your conscience doesn't bother
[1:46:38] you if your heart is open towards god
[1:46:41] then the only thing that's holding it
[1:46:42] back is god's timing
[1:46:44] he doesn't worry about timing the way we
[1:46:46] do because he's a he's of eternity
[1:46:48] amen and so he's sitting there and he's
[1:46:49] just waiting for things to go the way he
[1:46:50] wants it to
[1:46:51] and when that junction hits boom it
[1:46:53] happens look at elena
[1:46:54] look at atlanta she's claiming her
[1:46:56] healing and in one moment
[1:46:58] weeks later one moment she runs around
[1:47:01] says i am healed
[1:47:02] goes to the doctors the next day and
[1:47:04] everything is off of her
[1:47:05] right there is not a single thing
[1:47:06] showing on her x-ray why
[1:47:08] one moment but she had to go through
[1:47:10] weeks and weeks
[1:47:11] and weeks of weakness not being able to
[1:47:14] get up she'd sit down for an hour and a
[1:47:16] half to get strength to get up for 20
[1:47:17] minutes
[1:47:18] hour and a half before she could get up
[1:47:20] and just do 20 minutes of anything
[1:47:22] not not real work or anything don't just
[1:47:24] be up for 20 minutes she had to go
[1:47:25] through
[1:47:26] that day in day out day in and day out
[1:47:29] day in and day out
[1:47:30] and then in a moment god quickens to her
[1:47:32] and she's running around
[1:47:33] this is not a woman that can run in her
[1:47:35] condition she runs around
[1:47:36] gives her glory to god says i'm healed
[1:47:38] she knows she's healed
[1:47:39] goes to the doctors and they confirm at
[1:47:41] the very next day amen
[1:47:43] look at ron spencer amen does anybody
[1:47:45] here think that ron spencer is not a man
[1:47:47] of faith
[1:47:48] and he's going on a year of cancer right
[1:47:51] most of it's gone
[1:47:52] but he's still dealing with issues isn't
[1:47:53] he is that because he's not a man of
[1:47:55] faith
[1:47:56] no it's because god's got a plan and
[1:47:57] god's got a purpose and god's growing
[1:47:59] ron spencer there
[1:48:00] right and god's gonna show his great
[1:48:02] hand in all of this and we know that
[1:48:04] but that means he's still got to go
[1:48:05] through the trial and testing because
[1:48:06] god's got something better for him
[1:48:08] waiting on the other side of it amen
[1:48:10] the length of the trial is not
[1:48:11] reflective of your faith it's reflective
[1:48:13] of god's plan and purpose in your life
[1:48:14] amen
[1:48:16] amen
[1:48:25] isaac had to pray for rebecca to bring
[1:48:27] the promise
[1:48:32] that that blows my mind that god
[1:48:34] wouldn't just give that to them you know
[1:48:36] you think that being in the line of
[1:48:37] promise and the royal seed that things
[1:48:39] would just kind of follow naturally
[1:48:41] pretty easily
[1:48:42] you know you think she'd be pregnant
[1:48:43] pretty quick honestly but she's barren
[1:48:45] she's barren she's bare until
[1:48:46] isaac goes to go and says hey what about
[1:48:48] this you promised
[1:48:50] can we have our children now please and
[1:48:52] all of a sudden she gets it you know
[1:48:54] but it took me back to gethsemane
[1:48:56] because we had a man that prayed for us
[1:48:58] and then we had a man that took us to
[1:49:00] prayer and said there's something that's
[1:49:02] supposed to happen and i need to pray
[1:49:03] about it
[1:49:04] this is what he did this is in
[1:49:06] gethsemane this is jesus
[1:49:08] struggling with and going through the
[1:49:10] final temptation of will he accept his
[1:49:12] purpose
[1:49:13] and will he take the final step and go
[1:49:15] all the way to the cross
[1:49:16] or will he walk away and in all of that
[1:49:19] he prays for us and i want to read the
[1:49:22] entire prayer here
[1:49:24] john 17. this is jesus talking he says
[1:49:26] now they have known that all things
[1:49:28] whatsoever thou has given me
[1:49:30] are of thee for i have given unto them
[1:49:32] the words which thou gave us me
[1:49:34] and they have received them that's us we
[1:49:36] have received the words that he's given
[1:49:38] us amen
[1:49:38] and have known surely that i came out
[1:49:40] from thee and that they have believed
[1:49:42] that thou did send me
[1:49:44] i pray for them i pray not for the world
[1:49:48] but for them which thou has given me for
[1:49:50] they are thine
[1:49:51] and all mine are thine and all and thine
[1:49:54] are mine and i'm glorified in them
[1:49:56] amen and i am no more in the world but
[1:49:59] these are in the world and i come to
[1:50:01] thee holy father
[1:50:03] keep them through thine own name those
[1:50:05] whom thou has given me that they may be
[1:50:07] one as we are one
[1:50:09] this is his prayer and that agony
[1:50:11] remember when he went there and he asked
[1:50:13] them pray for me i need
[1:50:14] i need prayer i need strength and they
[1:50:16] fell asleep fell asleep he's there
[1:50:18] praying
[1:50:18] just for them after all that's over he's
[1:50:21] praying for them he's not thinking about
[1:50:23] himself he's thinking
[1:50:24] about us you know we have that song when
[1:50:26] he was on the cross i was on his mind
[1:50:28] guess what way before he was on the
[1:50:29] cross you were on his mind because he
[1:50:31] made a decision
[1:50:32] and then he prayed for you when really
[1:50:33] he should have been praying for himself
[1:50:35] for more strength
[1:50:37] he says while i was with them in the
[1:50:39] world i kept them in thy name
[1:50:41] those that thou have though gave us me i
[1:50:43] have kept and none of them is lost
[1:50:45] but the son of perdition that the
[1:50:46] scripture might be fulfilled
[1:50:48] and now i come to thee i'm leaving and
[1:50:51] these things i speak in the world that
[1:50:52] they might have my
[1:50:54] joy fulfilled in themselves i have given
[1:50:57] them thy word
[1:50:58] and the world has hated them because
[1:50:59] they are not of the world even as i am
[1:51:01] not of the world
[1:51:02] i pray that thou shalt take them out of
[1:51:04] the world
[1:51:05] but thou i pray i pray not that thou
[1:51:08] should take them out of the world
[1:51:09] but thou should just keep them from evil
[1:51:13] we had to stay right he says i'm not
[1:51:15] asking you to take them out i'm asking
[1:51:16] you to keep them from evil
[1:51:18] they are not of the world even as i am
[1:51:20] not of the world sanctify them through
[1:51:22] thy truth
[1:51:24] for thy word is truth amen as thou has
[1:51:27] sent me into the world even so
[1:51:29] have i also sent them into the world and
[1:51:31] for their sakes i sanctify myself
[1:51:34] that they may also be sanctified through

[1:52:30] before the foundation of the world o
[1:52:33] righteous father the world had not known
[1:52:35] thee
[1:52:35] but i have known thee and these have
[1:52:37] known that thou has sent me
[1:52:39] and i have declared unto them thy name

[1:53:10] reminding you of the promise
[1:53:12] and as you gave the promise to me now

[1:54:40] warning on the devil that he's got his
[1:54:42] nasty self
[1:54:42] camped on god's property he says yes if
[1:54:46] he don't want to get out
[1:54:48] just call on the authorities of heaven
[1:54:50] god's law
[1:54:51] agent the holy ghost he will throw him
[1:54:53] out yes sir

[1:54:58] belongs to every christian when you're
[1:55:01] saved god gives you a checkbook
[1:55:03] at the bottom of the page it's got jesus
[1:55:05] name
[1:55:06] signed on every check amen my name's not
[1:55:08] on there
[1:55:09] i'm only there to fill in the amount he
[1:55:11] says any redemptive blessing belongs to
[1:55:13] you
[1:55:14] are you afraid to fill it out and
[1:55:17] abraham's children
[1:55:18] are you afraid he won't recognize the
[1:55:20] name of jesus
[1:55:22] whatever you ask him the father in my
[1:55:24] name
[1:55:25] that i will do
[1:55:29] that's the promise you're abraham's
[1:55:31] children
[1:55:32] you're not afraid to fill it out the
[1:55:34] bank of heaven will recognize the name
[1:55:36] of jesus on any
[1:55:37] redemptive blessing that his body
[1:55:39] sitting at the right hand of god making
[1:55:40] intercessions for
[1:55:42] that's what he died for it
[1:55:45] hallelujah what a place to stand every
[1:55:48] redemptive blessing is on that check and
[1:55:52] all you have to do is fill it in
[1:55:54] and dispossess the enemy amen the
[1:55:56] musicians will come as we close amen
[1:55:59] we overcome not by our good deeds amen
[1:56:02] we overcome not by our reputation
[1:56:05] we don't overcome by who our dad is who
[1:56:07] our mom is who our pastor is
[1:56:10] and then we overcome by the blood of the
[1:56:11] lamb amen amen we have a risen
[1:56:14] savior that lives within us to make
[1:56:16] those things live in us every single day
[1:56:17] amen
[1:56:18] we'll pick up on this next time i'm up
[1:56:20] here i'm not sure when that's going to
[1:56:21] be
[1:56:22] but we want to dig into this deeper
[1:56:23] because brother adam goes into quite a
[1:56:25] bit of depth
[1:56:26] and we don't just want to leave it at
[1:56:27] that you know it's sometimes it's enough
[1:56:29] to say well this is what god said and
[1:56:30] just take it
[1:56:31] and we want to be able to have that
[1:56:33] simple faith you know but he starts to
[1:56:34] dig into what it is that holds us back
[1:56:37] and the gates that are within us and the
[1:56:38] ways that the enemy comes in at us
[1:56:40] and what it takes to push the enemy off
[1:56:42] of your property
[1:56:44] and he brings a deeper understanding to
[1:56:45] and i really want us to get down into
[1:56:47] that
[1:56:47] amen we want to have simple faith where
[1:56:49] we just take the promises and move
[1:56:51] but sometimes we've got to recognize
[1:56:52] where the battle is and that's what
[1:56:54] we've got to push them out of sometimes
[1:56:55] we're pushing at the wrong area
[1:56:57] and we've got to push at the right area
[1:56:58] and say this is really where the battle
[1:57:00] needs to be taken and this is where the
[1:57:02] enemy has to be dispossessed amen
[1:57:04] amen let's just stand together if we
[1:57:06] would
[1:57:07] let's just stand together amen pray
[1:57:12] lord jesus lord what a book of promises
