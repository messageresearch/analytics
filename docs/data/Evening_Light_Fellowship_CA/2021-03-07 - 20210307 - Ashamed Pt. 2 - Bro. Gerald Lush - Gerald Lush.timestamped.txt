[20:14] the turn of the century
[20:17] like you know 1900s and he talked about
[20:21] being depressed
[20:22] and he was in prison and he was
[20:26] he was having a really rough time but
[20:30] one thing he said in his book against
[20:32] against the tide
[20:34] he said there was one day he was so
[20:37] depressed that he got out into the open
[20:39] and he just started praising god and he
[20:41] said he didn't feel like it
[20:42] at first but after a while that
[20:44] anointing struck and he kept
[20:46] praising it didn't matter what kind of
[20:48] situation he was in
[20:49] god looked after him and god was
[20:52] assuring him
[20:53] that he was with him and he just
[20:55] continued to praise the lord
[20:57] so it doesn't matter what tomorrow

[48:37] something that brother david got
[48:38] produced
[48:39] and this and what is it
[48:43] it's this and it's down to this
[48:46] amen it is the hymn book that he took
[48:49] somewhere and he got somebody to
[48:51] redo it and this is what they did amen
[48:54] i think we would maybe need it to be
[48:56] done a little bit larger
[48:58] when it comes to the the lettering here
[49:01] but again if you've got good eyes you'll
[49:03] see it amen
[49:04] so we thank the lord for maybe he laid
[49:07] it on our brother
[49:08] brother david to to go somewhere and get
[49:10] just to check on and see if they could
[49:12] do it
[49:13] and so it it is everything even the
[49:15] index
[49:16] of all the hymns amen so god's grace
[49:19] and we'll see as the lord leads us and
[49:22] also to
[49:22] express thanks for sister maureen
[49:24] special amen
[49:26] praise the lord be thankful for his
[49:28] presence be thankful for all he's done
[49:30] amen to god be the glory and also i want
[49:34] to express
[49:34] thanks again to our brother jonathan
[49:36] corlett for the ministry of the word
[49:39] and uh blessed with the ministry of the
[49:41] word
[49:42] when he ministered to us concerning
[49:43] faith and so on well you know it's
[49:46] amazing we think faith is a feeling
[49:48] but faith got nothing to do with
[49:50] feelings or i sense this and sense this
[49:52] yeah faith god well faith comes by
[49:55] hearing
[49:56] airing by the word amen so it's as
[49:58] simple as receiving the word
[50:00] it is god in simplicity i believe amen
[50:04] and it's not again it's not emotion it's
[50:06] not none of that no it's just it's just
[50:08] rest
[50:09] he said faith is rest faith is peace i'm
[50:11] persuaded i know it i believe it thank
[50:13] you lord
[50:14] and you don't have to work it up just go
[50:16] on amen and god will honor your faith
[50:19] amen and god will bless you amen in
[50:22] response
[50:23] to your faith but it's so it's simple
[50:25] it's simple
[50:26] again oh i feel this i feel no it's your
[50:29] anything you feel is peace amen anything
[50:32] you feel is peace
[50:33] god in all circumstances all situations
[50:35] gives you peace
[50:37] and god is giving us in these
[50:38] circumstances right now what's going on
[50:40] around the world
[50:41] god has given us peace to god be the
[50:44] glory
[50:45] amen so that the world is getting caught
[50:47] up with it the world is getting upset
[50:49] with it
[50:49] and so on they're warning about this
[50:51] wondering of that but the bride is
[50:52] looking out oh lord we're getting closer
[50:54] we're on
[50:54] we're on our way home lord amen praise
[50:57] the name of the lord
[50:59] and as i've heard of the ministry a
[51:00] minute sometimes to point us to
[51:02] he said when we started out he said it's
[51:04] still there and he said that's the gate
[51:07] it's the gate is down there to enter in
[51:09] amen that's right
[51:10] so you keep your eye on the gate and
[51:12] because the angels are there
[51:14] any but the enemy is there to get us to
[51:16] go off here go off there go off here
[51:18] he's not not denying the word but adding
[51:20] to the word or he's taken away from the
[51:22] word
[51:22] but like i said it's like like the tree
[51:24] you know god plants it
[51:26] but what god's looking for is the is
[51:28] what the what the tree produces not
[51:29] what's
[51:30] not what's grafted in and i tell you the
[51:33] devil has grafted a lot in
[51:35] to the tree amen answers anything the
[51:37] devil has turned us off on
[51:39] amen god will bring us right back and go
[51:41] on straight again
[51:42] until it's an original branch original
[51:44] branch so you come to the fruit
[51:46] amen it's going to produce this this and
[51:48] this but it's all because look now god
[51:51] looking for the fruit but again it's
[51:53] like the brothers said and brother brown
[51:54] brought it out
[51:55] but the man that went somewhere to visit
[51:57] somebody
[51:58] and oh and he saw he saw a tree there
[52:02] and he saw this fruit dead fruit dead
[52:04] fruit
[52:05] what's that what kind of a tree is that
[52:09] and he looked up to where it brought out
[52:11] natural branches
[52:12] and he said that's that one right there
[52:14] this is what it's producing
[52:16] well how come it's growing this is
[52:17] growing this and growing that
[52:19] oh that was that was grafted in amen
[52:22] so it could be it can be identified with
[52:24] the original tree
[52:25] but it's not a man a right and it's
[52:28] experiencing the life of the tree
[52:30] but just go to show that what's on the
[52:32] inside is coming out in reality
[52:34] and it's not the fruit of that original
[52:35] tree amen but i tell you this
[52:38] god is endeavoring to us to get us to
[52:40] bring forth the fruit of the original
[52:42] tree
[52:42] that he planted amen not religion
[52:45] not this church or that church this
[52:47] denomination that denomination no it's
[52:48] the word of god
[52:50] and brother again it struck me as our
[52:52] brother jonathan was preaching he
[52:53] bringing up scriptures
[52:55] oh faith faith faith oh i said lord
[52:57] that's amazing
[52:58] i said yeah it's simple oh it's simple
[53:01] what is it
[53:02] always believe in what god reveals right
[53:04] it's believing what's in the word
[53:05] oh i accept the lord amen praise the
[53:08] lord and you go on you don't doubt it
[53:10] you're not going to listen to the devil
[53:11] to add to it or take from it you take it
[53:13] away god gives
[53:14] it and that's faith that's the faith
[53:16] that pleases god
[53:17] it is god in simplicity thank god for
[53:20] the prophet to come
[53:21] and and and reveal those things to us
[53:23] because people think oh well god is this
[53:25] god is that and and
[53:26] and god is this they're making it this
[53:28] yeah
[53:29] and sometimes if god is this they're
[53:31] making us even smaller you know
[53:33] but let's take the way the bible reveals
[53:35] it
[53:36] god hidden and god revealed in
[53:39] simplicity
[53:41] praise brother that's why he sent the
[53:43] prophet so we would recognize god
[53:45] not religion oh not this this idea that
[53:48] idea
[53:49] god so he said what is it he says keep
[53:51] going towards the
[53:52] door keep going towards that gate you
[53:55] can see it
[53:56] amen we're going to glory by the grace
[53:58] of god
[53:59] amen don't take your eye off the gate
[54:02] and if you lose it sometimes and you're
[54:04] praying you're sincere
[54:05] god will bring you back in amen to the
[54:08] original tree
[54:09] amen so the lord bless us
[54:12] amen and again god bless our brother
[54:14] jonathan amen god help us brother when
[54:17] it comes to faith
[54:18] it is the word of god hearing the word
[54:21] of god
[54:22] amen hearing it yeah oh i i heard it
[54:25] yeah yeah but you accept it yeah you
[54:28] said yeah amen lord that's your word
[54:29] thank you lord amen and is giving me
[54:32] more faith
[54:33] brothers god and simplicity amen you
[54:36] god reveals it you just go and do it
[54:38] amen but too many are adding this to it
[54:40] adding that to it
[54:41] emotion and so on so we pray the grace
[54:44] of god
[54:44] help us believe the word the power is in
[54:47] the word
[54:48] amen whatever god's going to do is in
[54:51] his word
[54:52] and you believe the word god well god's
[54:53] going to do it if you don't believe it
[54:54] god
[54:55] push you out and keep on going with
[54:57] those that believe
[54:58] amen it is it is such a simple thing
[55:01] and we pray the grace of god yes and i i
[55:04] don't know if i've done it yet but to
[55:06] bring greetings of course
[55:07] uh to the saints here he asked me to do
[55:10] it
[55:11] and that was brother george smith
[55:12] because a few days ago he called me
[55:14] and uh i don't know if he's in tennessee
[55:17] right now or
[55:18] in another country that he was planning
[55:19] at that time to go
[55:21] but he had to get a blood test to make
[55:23] sure it was negative
[55:24] yeah and uh and that he would be
[55:27] permitted to fly on
[55:28] on the airplanes but they needed that
[55:30] test result first
[55:32] so we pray grace to be with brother
[55:33] george amen he's pressing on in
[55:36] in in spite of all that's going on in
[55:38] the world all that's going on in the
[55:40] united states
[55:41] he's pressing on to do the will of god
[55:43] and he's been going around tennessee
[55:45] and so on so we pray grace to him as he
[55:47] feels led of the lord
[55:48] to go minister to some saints and not
[55:50] chores as central or south america
[55:52] or where it is right now but we pray god
[55:55] bless our brother and his ministry amen
[55:59] and he asked me to pass on greetings to
[56:01] the saints here i said brother we'll be
[56:03] praying for you
[56:04] amen and uh also
[56:08] our brother earl ellsworth just asked
[56:10] you to keep him in prayer because
[56:11] he will be arriving here again tomorrow
[56:14] and he will be staying with us
[56:16] and uh the lord willing i'll be taking
[56:18] him to see a doctor or two a couple of
[56:20] doctors
[56:21] at the health science center on tuesday
[56:23] morning
[56:24] i think his appointment is nine o'clock
[56:26] tuesday morning
[56:27] and that's why they have to come to
[56:30] back to the city on monday so the grace
[56:33] of god be with brother earl
[56:35] amen and as they travel and the grace of
[56:38] god be with them as they go to visit the
[56:39] doctor
[56:40] to god be the glory amen well i'm so
[56:43] glad
[56:44] you know we were discussing with
[56:45] somebody and i know we brought out what
[56:47] the prophet said
[56:48] that he said god heals through doctors
[56:51] and god heals through medicine
[56:52] amen he does and he did sell that doctor
[56:55] he said brother
[56:56] he said i believe there's a there's a
[56:58] place in heaven for you
[57:00] for what so those doctors who are who
[57:03] are doing it in the name of the lord
[57:05] oh yeah they're going by the wisdom of
[57:07] god and of course we
[57:08] we we've already been identified with it
[57:11] are dr
[57:11] mcondo and dr keller uh
[57:16] columbo they all love kays
[57:19] in africa amen so we pray god bless them
[57:23] amen praise the lord i don't know if our
[57:25] brother visually has gone into case no
[57:27] okay it's from india to god be the glory
[57:30] amen and again i've been in contact with
[57:33] another brother in india
[57:35] and he's been requesting prayer and will
[57:37] remember him
[57:38] as the name that he identifies with me
[57:41] is not
[57:41] exactly the indian name but it's samuel
[57:45] a brother samuel in india and he's been
[57:47] having some problems
[57:49] in the last few days a man so we pray
[57:51] the grace of god to give him wisdom
[57:54] in dealing with those issues and i have
[57:56] connected him with the voice of god
[57:58] representative
[57:58] in india and i've been in contact with
[58:01] that brother for a number of years
[58:03] and so we pray the grace of god to him
[58:06] because not all that long ago uh our
[58:09] brother's
[58:09] wife was taken to glory amen she's
[58:12] passed on
[58:14] by the grace of god so we we're we we've
[58:17] remembered
[58:18] that brother in prayer amen and he
[58:20] appreciated it
[58:21] so the god god's grace be with them as
[58:24] he
[58:24] he will help that brother that i was in
[58:26] contact with
[58:27] help him to give him the wisdom that
[58:30] he's looking for
[58:31] he wants to know what should i do in
[58:33] these circumstances what should i do how
[58:35] should i do it when should i do it
[58:37] because of the issues that he's dealing
[58:38] with so god bless
[58:40] brother samuel amen and the other needs
[58:43] as well so god be with us all
[58:45] amen in first john chapter 2
[58:50] and again the lord willing i would like
[58:52] to be able to finish the thoughts
[58:54] concerning the message that the prophet
[58:56] preached in july 1965
[58:59] and it is in entitled ashamed
[59:03] amen it's amazing that the prophet god
[59:05] would find in the scripture
[59:07] a rev a message on ashamed
[59:10] and again as i said it's it's amazing
[59:13] the number of times that the bible
[59:14] references
[59:15] being ashamed amen ashamed of god
[59:18] maybe being ashamed of the word may be
[59:20] ashamed of your testimony and so on
[59:22] so he brother the prophet felt amen
[59:25] because i believe that's what's going to
[59:27] change a lot of attitudes toward the
[59:28] message
[59:29] is that people are going to be ashamed
[59:31] of the message amen
[59:33] so and they're going to avoid this and
[59:35] avoid that to finally they just
[59:37] avoid the message really so the grace of
[59:39] god be with us
[59:40] amen that will not be ashamed
[59:44] amen but we're going to stay with the
[59:46] word regardless
[59:48] it is for the glory of god and for the
[59:50] salvation of our souls
[59:52] again first john chapter 2
[59:56] and beginning to read at verse 21.
[1:00:02] it says i have not written unto you
[1:00:04] because ye know not the truth
[1:00:07] but because you know it and that no lie
[1:00:11] is of the truth amen
[1:00:14] who is a liar but he that denieth that
[1:00:18] jesus
[1:00:18] is the christ is antichrist that denieth
[1:00:23] the father
[1:00:24] and the son and whosoever deny it the
[1:00:27] son
[1:00:28] the same as not the father but he that
[1:00:31] acknowledgeth the son
[1:00:32] at the father also praised the name of
[1:00:35] the lord
[1:00:36] hallelujah what a relationship that we
[1:00:39] have
[1:00:39] with god verse 24
[1:00:42] let that therefore abide in you which ye
[1:00:45] have heard
[1:00:47] amen from the beginning and if that
[1:00:50] which you have heard from the beginning
[1:00:52] shall
[1:00:52] remain in you ye also shall continue
[1:00:56] in the son and in the father
[1:00:59] praise the lord hallelujah and this is
[1:01:02] the promise that he
[1:01:04] hath promised us even eternal life
[1:01:08] and these things have i written unto you
[1:01:11] concerning them that seduce you
[1:01:14] god help us but the anointing which ye
[1:01:18] have received of him
[1:01:19] abideth in you grace grace grace that we
[1:01:24] got the anointing in us the holy ghost
[1:01:26] in us
[1:01:27] amen and it says the anointing which you
[1:01:30] have received of him abideth in you
[1:01:32] and ye need not that any man
[1:01:36] teach you but as the same anointing
[1:01:39] teaches you of all things and is truth
[1:01:42] and is no lie and even as it has taught
[1:01:45] you
[1:01:46] ye shall abide in him amen
[1:01:51] and now little children you need no one
[1:01:53] to teach you the basics
[1:01:55] but god has got the ministry there to
[1:01:57] teach you
[1:01:58] to mature amen as the sons and daughters
[1:02:02] of god
[1:02:03] amen to highlight the things that maybe
[1:02:05] you're not seeing as you should see
[1:02:07] amen not acting as you should act or
[1:02:10] reacting
[1:02:10] amen so the prophet of god highlighted
[1:02:14] this when somebody
[1:02:15] endeavors to persuade the prophet that i
[1:02:17] don't need any teachers
[1:02:19] i don't need any pastor i don't need any
[1:02:21] ministry and so on he said the bible
[1:02:23] says this
[1:02:24] but the prophet says he said you've
[1:02:26] you've skipped one thing
[1:02:28] that what god is doing here he's doing
[1:02:30] it through the ministry
[1:02:31] amen so there is a ministry that god has
[1:02:34] got
[1:02:35] to bring you to this place amen by the
[1:02:37] grace of god
[1:02:40] and again when it comes to the the
[1:02:42] fightful ministry
[1:02:44] and there are those that come to the
[1:02:45] seals and they feel that they don't need
[1:02:48] any other ministry because the seals
[1:02:50] were revealed the prophet was here
[1:02:52] and all we have to do is listen to the
[1:02:53] prophet well
[1:02:55] as i've said and highlighted it some
[1:02:57] time ago they need to go back to the
[1:02:59] revelation of the seven seals
[1:03:01] and especially to the questions and
[1:03:02] answers on the seals
[1:03:04] because one of the questions that are
[1:03:06] asked the prophet
[1:03:08] is does the bride have a ministry amen
[1:03:11] and he said she sure does and he says
[1:03:14] been in her since the day of pentecost
[1:03:15] and right from the beginning
[1:03:17] and he said it is the five-full ministry
[1:03:19] and he highlighted it amen
[1:03:21] but yet there are so-called believers
[1:03:23] that feel the bride doesn't need
[1:03:25] the fightful ministry and that's why you
[1:03:27] find that there are certain ones that
[1:03:29] are
[1:03:29] are just listening to tapes where the
[1:03:31] proud of god said if they
[1:03:33] played that tape probably god said he
[1:03:35] see you young ministers
[1:03:36] is your ordained to take the bride on to
[1:03:39] resurrection and rapturing faith and so
[1:03:41] on unto
[1:03:42] the coming of the lord amen that we're
[1:03:45] looking for
[1:03:46] so brother you can't you can't deny it
[1:03:48] if you deny that then you're going to
[1:03:50] deny the rest of the seals
[1:03:52] so god help us that we're going to
[1:03:53] accept the mystery of god
[1:03:55] believe the mystery of god stay in line
[1:03:57] with the mystery of god
[1:03:58] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:04:01] hallelujah
[1:04:04] and again ver which was it verse 25
[1:04:08] 28 oh we'll start with 27 again
[1:04:11] but the anointing which ye have received
[1:04:13] of him abideth in you
[1:04:15] and you need not that any man teach you
[1:04:18] amen no when it comes to the basics
[1:04:21] because your god has brought you in by
[1:04:23] the again was through the ministry
[1:04:25] bring it to repentance amen and you lay
[1:04:28] down your life
[1:04:29] amen but by the holy ghost you pick it
[1:04:31] up again praise the lord
[1:04:33] amen you're a new creature now in christ
[1:04:37] amen but does the same anointing teaches
[1:04:40] you of all things
[1:04:41] and is truth and is no lie even
[1:04:45] as it has taught you ye shall abide in
[1:04:48] him amen and now little children abide
[1:04:52] in him
[1:04:53] that when he shall appear we may have
[1:04:56] confidence and not be ashamed amen
[1:04:59] before him at his coming god bless his
[1:05:03] word you may be seated
[1:05:06] amen and turn with me again to first
[1:05:08] peter chapter 4
[1:05:11] amen and the grace of god that
[1:05:16] you would keep sister betty in prayer
[1:05:18] she was really
[1:05:19] not feeling well yesterday or last night
[1:05:22] and
[1:05:23] most of the day she had it hard through
[1:05:25] that through that
[1:05:26] saturday night or friday night i should
[1:05:28] say amen
[1:05:30] so pray the grace of god that the lord
[1:05:32] will according to his will
[1:05:34] bring her into contact with the doctor
[1:05:37] that that's ordained to look after her
[1:05:40] amen and it's been quite a while so we
[1:05:42] pray grace that the
[1:05:44] the lord will improve it amen more
[1:05:47] quicker by the grace of god
[1:05:51] and sold it and also in first peter
[1:05:53] chapter 4
[1:05:55] and reading verses 12 to 19.
[1:05:59] and the lord willing what i would do is
[1:06:01] to read the scriptures
[1:06:02] and again my not it's not a problem but
[1:06:05] down
[1:06:07] my ministry when it comes to dealing
[1:06:09] with these
[1:06:10] issues that i read the scripture and
[1:06:12] stay with the scripture read the
[1:06:14] scripture and stay with the scripture
[1:06:15] then we'll read another one and another
[1:06:17] one and another one
[1:06:19] and so by the time we're finished with
[1:06:20] the with the scriptures
[1:06:22] that we didn't have time to get into the
[1:06:23] message and give you the quotes
[1:06:26] concerning the message that i'm
[1:06:27] preaching on now and it's
[1:06:29] ashamed and brother brown was
[1:06:31] challenging the faith
[1:06:32] of the people he's challenging our faith
[1:06:34] he's challenging your faith
[1:06:36] he's challenging my faith are we ashamed
[1:06:38] of this or ashamed of that
[1:06:39] and i have noted down through the ages
[1:06:41] and down through the years rather
[1:06:43] that i've noticed that there's been many
[1:06:44] and brother and sister
[1:06:46] that have been ashamed of this part of
[1:06:48] the word shamed of that part of the word
[1:06:50] they're they're there to believe oh i
[1:06:51] believe god sent a prophet
[1:06:53] oh i believe god opened the seals and i
[1:06:55] believe god did this
[1:06:56] but brother what he the reason he did it
[1:06:58] was to give us the faith for the
[1:07:00] resurrection
[1:07:01] he gave us the faith for the rapture and
[1:07:03] he and again that's only for the bride
[1:07:05] that's that's not for all of there the
[1:07:07] prophet god's again said
[1:07:09] now he said we're not going to get this
[1:07:10] message to everybody no
[1:07:12] but if you're gonna get it to the bride
[1:07:14] amen because when it comes to the
[1:07:16] message
[1:07:17] the purpose of it and the reason why god
[1:07:19] has ordained it and predestinated it
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:22] well that's not what god's looking for
[1:07:23] in those out there
[1:07:25] but it's what he's looking for in the
[1:07:26] bride amen
[1:07:28] so brother and again because he said the
[1:07:30] problem god highlighted it
[1:07:32] and i said we won't get to everyone with
[1:07:34] the message but
[1:07:35] he said that when it comes to the
[1:07:36] revelation of jesus and he said as our
[1:07:39] lord and savior
[1:07:40] he said that message is going to go to
[1:07:42] all the world amen
[1:07:43] northeast south and west is going to go
[1:07:45] everybody's going to get that witness
[1:07:47] but not the message because that message
[1:07:50] is only ordained
[1:07:51] for the bride and to give the bride
[1:07:53] resurrection and rapturing faith
[1:07:55] to give the bride the faith that she
[1:07:57] needs to get out of time and into
[1:07:59] eternity
[1:08:00] whereas the others again as the bible
[1:08:02] said many are called
[1:08:03] but few are chosen and as i've said the
[1:08:06] calls are not lost
[1:08:07] amen but again the caller not ordained
[1:08:10] and predestinated for the
[1:08:11] rapture not by any means so brother
[1:08:14] they're there
[1:08:15] by by the grace of god and they will be
[1:08:18] there and that's that again
[1:08:20] when it comes to this hour in this age
[1:08:22] that is the many that are going to lay
[1:08:23] down their lives in the great
[1:08:25] tribulation
[1:08:26] but the bride is going to go up and be
[1:08:28] united with their bridegroom
[1:08:30] amen as the problem of god said he said
[1:08:33] we're not going to a marriage we're
[1:08:34] going to a marriage supper
[1:08:36] amen because he's being united now with
[1:08:38] the bride and the bride's being united
[1:08:40] with him
[1:08:41] amen they praise the lord and when it's
[1:08:44] completed when it is absolutely finished
[1:08:46] according to the last one amen then
[1:08:49] brother the rapture is going to take
[1:08:50] place
[1:08:51] amen the resurrection of the bride
[1:08:53] that's gone on and the
[1:08:54] and the and the ch and the rapture of
[1:08:56] the bride that's still living
[1:08:58] by the grace of god so brother i pray
[1:09:00] grace god help us
[1:09:01] in the name of jesus to recognize it to
[1:09:04] acknowledge the hour that we're living
[1:09:06] amen to acknowledge what we believe god
[1:09:08] has done
[1:09:09] and to acknowledge what god is doing
[1:09:12] amen
[1:09:13] and there there's many out there they
[1:09:15] feel that god has done this and god is
[1:09:16] doing this
[1:09:17] and but that's why they're still out
[1:09:19] there but i'll tell you this
[1:09:21] that if they're not bright they're still
[1:09:23] going to be faithful to what god has
[1:09:24] revealed to them
[1:09:25] amen and they believe that they are the
[1:09:28] sons and daughters of god
[1:09:30] amen and they're going to live outside
[1:09:32] the city but the bride is going to live
[1:09:34] with him
[1:09:35] in the city praise the lord and the
[1:09:37] bride is going to sit with him
[1:09:39] in earth for any strong amen now all the
[1:09:42] others are not going to sit with him
[1:09:43] but each the bride and the bridegroom
[1:09:46] they're going to rule
[1:09:47] and reign over the earth and they're
[1:09:49] going to rule and reign
[1:09:50] over those that are outside the city so
[1:09:53] again
[1:09:55] as i said to keep your attitude right
[1:09:57] keep your spirit right to those
[1:09:59] that that are not message believers amen
[1:10:02] just encourage them to believe god just
[1:10:04] encourage them to just to keep
[1:10:06] by having faith in god and god will
[1:10:08] bless you god will do this for you god
[1:10:10] is still your healer
[1:10:11] god is still your savior amen and god is
[1:10:14] still your lord amen but again
[1:10:16] they're not bright so brother i thank
[1:10:18] god for that revelation
[1:10:20] amen we need it and brother i tell you
[1:10:22] this god ordained it thus
[1:10:24] so as to keep our spirit right and keep
[1:10:26] our attitude right amen
[1:10:28] toward everyone oh my and i know that
[1:10:31] they're
[1:10:31] believers when they come to this message
[1:10:34] oh yeah not all but most
[1:10:36] believers that i've experienced through
[1:10:37] the years they came to this message and
[1:10:39] they were looking down their noses at
[1:10:41] anybody oh they go to this church they
[1:10:42] go to that church they go to that church
[1:10:44] you know
[1:10:44] we were there too one time and brother
[1:10:48] that's that's the
[1:10:48] the level of the revelation that god is
[1:10:51] dealing with them
[1:10:52] amen but still he's looking for them to
[1:10:54] surrender to him
[1:10:56] amen and not to not to his revelation as
[1:10:58] a bride
[1:10:59] bridegroom no no but as as their lord
[1:11:02] and savior
[1:11:03] amen but we're here because we are
[1:11:06] believed that we are the bride of christ
[1:11:08] amen and he is our bridegroom amen
[1:11:11] and what god has done and what god is
[1:11:13] doing
[1:11:14] is for the bride what god has done what
[1:11:16] god is doing
[1:11:17] is to give us the faith that he's
[1:11:19] looking for in the bright
[1:11:21] praise the lord amen so god elvis said
[1:11:24] we're going to believe
[1:11:25] amen and the more we believe we're going
[1:11:27] to get into the word and the more we get
[1:11:28] into the word
[1:11:29] the greater and greater we're going to
[1:11:30] have the revelation that we are the
[1:11:32] bride of christ
[1:11:34] amen and that god is looking for the
[1:11:36] attributes of a bride
[1:11:38] amen not just christians that god is
[1:11:42] satisfied with out there
[1:11:43] there's one as a christian that's a
[1:11:44] christian when it comes to being
[1:11:46] christ-like
[1:11:47] amen in their nature christ like to the
[1:11:50] level that
[1:11:51] they they have the revelation amen so
[1:11:54] brother i'm not looking for them to have
[1:11:56] the revelation that we have and we're up
[1:11:58] here somewhere
[1:11:59] but i believe that they have a
[1:12:00] revelation of god as their lord and
[1:12:02] savior
[1:12:04] our lord jesus christ amen and they
[1:12:06] might be on this level or whatever
[1:12:08] but the strong is there to support the
[1:12:10] weak
[1:12:11] amen and the bible does teach that there
[1:12:14] are those
[1:12:14] there are those uh right down here amen
[1:12:17] then
[1:12:18] that according to them when it comes to
[1:12:19] the calling of god in their hearts and
[1:12:21] in their souls
[1:12:22] amen somehow they have this
[1:12:24] understanding this revelation of god and
[1:12:26] what he's done and what he's doing
[1:12:28] and others got this revelation but the
[1:12:29] bride has got the entire revelation
[1:12:32] the fullness of the goddess bodily in
[1:12:34] the bride
[1:12:35] amen the fullness of god amen the word
[1:12:39] in flesh in her flesh and the power of
[1:12:42] god delight led us
[1:12:43] when he said he said the fullness of the
[1:12:45] god at bodily is now
[1:12:46] in the bright it was in the break room
[1:12:49] but now he said it's in the right
[1:12:51] amen and brother i truly list for the
[1:12:53] fullness of the god of bodily in the
[1:12:55] break room
[1:12:55] amen he laid down his life and he picked
[1:12:58] it up again
[1:12:58] and he had power over the world the
[1:13:01] flesh the devil
[1:13:02] amen and it's the same thing with the
[1:13:04] bride amen
[1:13:05] in these last days because of what god
[1:13:08] has done and what god is doing
[1:13:10] amen that he praise the lord he's giving
[1:13:13] us
[1:13:13] the victory over the world and he's
[1:13:16] given us the victory over the flesh
[1:13:18] amen and victory over the devil amen
[1:13:22] praise the name of the lord oh well they
[1:13:25] the those out there
[1:13:26] oh lord look they're doing this they're
[1:13:28] doing that they're doing this yeah but
[1:13:29] they don't have no other revelation
[1:13:31] amen they'll live on base on based on
[1:13:33] the level of the revelation that god has
[1:13:35] given them amen
[1:13:36] and brother it's it's going to be very
[1:13:38] difficult
[1:13:40] and maybe i believe that the that the
[1:13:43] greatest number when it comes to even
[1:13:44] even this listen there's been millions
[1:13:47] and millions and millions that god have
[1:13:48] raised and and
[1:13:49] brought into his his presence down
[1:13:52] through the years
[1:13:53] amen but you know what in in among among
[1:13:56] them all there's been a bride
[1:13:58] amen and brother when it comes to the
[1:14:00] resurrection
[1:14:01] it doesn't mean that all those in
[1:14:03] luther's age wesley's age
[1:14:05] and other ages all all the
[1:14:08] those that didn't believe luther's
[1:14:09] message or they're lost they're gone
[1:14:11] they're going to hell

[1:14:22] things the

[1:14:25] are going to hell
[1:14:26] even though they choose that amen it's
[1:14:29] not god's choice it's their choice
[1:14:31] amen god gave them a choice and and he
[1:14:33] knew what they were going to do
[1:14:34] amen with their spirit and their
[1:14:36] attitude amen
[1:14:38] but again brother let's keep our spirit
[1:14:40] right toward them

[1:14:43] because brother
[1:14:44] as he jesus loved us we want to love
[1:14:46] them
[1:14:48] as he reveals himself to us amen so we
[1:14:51] want to go out and
[1:14:52] reveal the same revelation to them amen

[1:15:12] that they'll take a strong firm stand
[1:15:15] for you

[1:15:18] looking for in you and me
[1:15:20] on to the separation from from the world

[1:15:36] for this and to a lot of people they
[1:15:38] would be ashamed of this ashamed of that
[1:15:40] and so on no
[1:15:41] no no not the bride and to me a believer
[1:15:43] is not going to be ashamed
[1:15:44] of what god has revealed to them and
[1:15:47] they'll take their stand
[1:15:48] for what god's revealed whether it's on
[1:15:50] this level that level or another level
[1:15:52] amen and the bible does tell us and the
[1:15:54] providence isolated it
[1:15:56] that we are to be there to encourage the
[1:15:58] others
[1:15:59] amen not to condemn them to encourage
[1:16:01] them
[1:16:02] amen that's right thank god he didn't

[1:16:14] daughters of god
[1:16:15] oh he's called us to a greater
[1:16:17] revelation that we are the bride

[1:16:22] thank god
[1:16:23] hallelujah and pray by grace that we're
[1:16:26] not ashamed
[1:16:27] of being separated as the bride amen
[1:16:31] and others feel they don't want to do it

[1:16:33] that
[1:16:34] amen but brother by the grace of god
[1:16:38] we want it because we know the end
[1:16:40] result
[1:16:41] is pride and bright group amen
[1:16:45] the end result is the marriage supper of
[1:16:47] the lamb and so glad the prophet as i
[1:16:49] highlighted it
[1:16:50] and as i said that sister copy did come
[1:16:53] to me and said brother that's the
[1:16:54] greatest
[1:16:55] wonderful most wonderful revelation or
[1:16:57] ministries that i've enjoyed
[1:16:59] he says good because i spent so many
[1:17:01] sermons
[1:17:02] on that on that those thoughts of being
[1:17:06] what of the bridegroom meeting the bride
[1:17:09] of the bridegroom and the bride being
[1:17:11] engaged
[1:17:12] amen and then being united
[1:17:16] and then going to the marriage supper of
[1:17:17] the lamb amen because as i said in 1962
[1:17:21] oh he said we're engaged to the
[1:17:22] bridegroom and this
[1:17:24] and this and this he mentioned that in a
[1:17:25] certain message and then in 1964
[1:17:28] he said we're not going to a marriage
[1:17:31] we're going to a marriage supper
[1:17:34] amen because we are united with emir
[1:17:37] amen after they owe me the seven seals
[1:17:40] is the revelation of god
[1:17:41] coming down to be united with his bride
[1:17:44] amen and we're united with him as the
[1:17:47] bridegroom
[1:17:47] amen but the world in general the
[1:17:49] religious world in general
[1:17:51] is not recognizing the coming of the
[1:17:53] bride oh it's the coming of jesus
[1:17:55] it's the coming of our lord the coming
[1:17:56] of our savior but they're not
[1:17:58] identifying him
[1:17:59] as a bridegroom amen because he's not
[1:18:02] their bridegroom
[1:18:03] and they are not his bride but they're
[1:18:04] going to be outside the city
[1:18:06] but the bride is in the city with the
[1:18:08] bridegroom thank god
[1:18:09] amen so don't lose that revelation
[1:18:13] amen keep your heart your mind your soul
[1:18:15] focused
[1:18:16] on that revelation of who you are amen
[1:18:20] and i believe that if you're bright
[1:18:21] you're not going to be ashamed of the
[1:18:23] bridegroom
[1:18:24] you're not going to be ashamed of the
[1:18:25] revelation of the bright group you're
[1:18:27] not going to be ashamed
[1:18:28] of what he's asking for in you and in me
[1:18:30] and what he's looking for
[1:18:31] in you and in me amen what what
[1:18:34] why why is the temptation there that
[1:18:36] maybe we might be ashamed
[1:18:38] is because of the total separation from
[1:18:40] unbelief
[1:18:41] amen that amen the influence of the word
[1:18:44] the influence of what god has done the
[1:18:46] influence of what he's doing
[1:18:47] is bringing us to a greater and a
[1:18:49] greater and a greater separation
[1:18:50] amen and for there are those that will
[1:18:53] be ashamed of
[1:18:54] it amen oh yeah i've witnessed that down
[1:18:56] for the years
[1:18:57] they're ashamed amen of this or i don't
[1:19:00] want i don't want to
[1:19:02] go that far with it i don't want to go
[1:19:03] you're going to go all the way god wants
[1:19:04] you to go
[1:19:06] and there are those that said they think
[1:19:07] oh i'll go this way i'll go this way
[1:19:09] yeah it's like one time a number of
[1:19:11] years ago there was a young man
[1:19:15] in central newfoundland and well i
[1:19:17] called him young
[1:19:18] because he might have been in his late
[1:19:19] 40s or early 50s and
[1:19:22] uh he was a believer and so one
[1:19:25] one day that he was out doing certain
[1:19:27] things
[1:19:28] in the wilderness there and it was it
[1:19:30] was
[1:19:31] near the the transcanada highway and
[1:19:34] one time this i i believe was even some
[1:19:37] believers drove by
[1:19:38] and they looked up on the hill there
[1:19:39] somewhere and there was this brother
[1:19:41] and and one point there they looked and
[1:19:44] he was just sitting down
[1:19:45] amen and he they waved to him and he
[1:19:48] waved to them but
[1:19:50] just shortly after that he died
[1:19:54] because he had a heart attack and he
[1:19:55] died amen
[1:19:58] and of course he was buried in life
[1:20:00] tabernacle in bishop falls
[1:20:02] and i had to i had to go in and take
[1:20:04] control of the of the funeral service
[1:20:07] and uh the song servers and the prayers
[1:20:09] and
[1:20:10] and and all the issues that when it
[1:20:12] comes to a funeral service
[1:20:13] and as i said the building was full and
[1:20:16] i would say maybe there might have been
[1:20:18] almost 300 people there and like i said
[1:20:21] we had to have chairs brought in so
[1:20:22] others could sit
[1:20:24] and they weren't all believers but and
[1:20:27] again in a sense they were believers but
[1:20:28] not message believers
[1:20:30] and because he had he was a member
[1:20:33] of the of that bishop falls council
[1:20:37] oh yeah he was a member for a number of
[1:20:39] years
[1:20:40] of that council and all and and the
[1:20:42] whole council
[1:20:43] town council was there oh yeah they came
[1:20:46] in
[1:20:46] and they were sitting here they were
[1:20:48] sitting there praise the name of the
[1:20:49] lord
[1:20:50] and to the ex to the place where i had
[1:20:52] to and i know a lot of believers maybe
[1:20:54] wouldn't
[1:20:54] when it wouldn't do this but i said uh
[1:20:57] well i said god bless us
[1:20:58] but i said i'm going to ask now all any
[1:21:00] ministering brethren
[1:21:02] that are here and i said you might be a
[1:21:04] salvation army
[1:21:05] officer you might be a pentecostal
[1:21:07] pastor or whatever i said
[1:21:09] if you're a ministering brother i want
[1:21:11] you to come and sit on the platform
[1:21:14] and i said so that we're going to give
[1:21:15] more room to those that are coming in
[1:21:17] the door there
[1:21:18] amen and you know what oh my there was
[1:21:21] this
[1:21:22] preacher there was this preacher this
[1:21:24] pastor this one this
[1:21:25] officer of salvation army oh there was a
[1:21:28] number that came up
[1:21:29] and we had two of these large seats
[1:21:30] there on the platform and they were
[1:21:32] sitting there
[1:21:33] but i noticed that there was a message
[1:21:36] believer there a pastor
[1:21:37] and he didn't come out and i said oh i
[1:21:41] said oh yeah brother
[1:21:42] i said i'm going to ask you i said to
[1:21:43] come up and so somebody else can take
[1:21:45] your seat
[1:21:46] no wouldn't come out and i said oh my
[1:21:49] i said okay god bless you amen so i left
[1:21:53] that with the lord
[1:21:54] amen but that's not the right attitude
[1:21:56] of a believer
[1:21:57] amen if you want to let somebody come in
[1:21:59] praise the lord let them be
[1:22:01] literally receive the witness amen
[1:22:04] of what we believe concerning funerals
[1:22:06] amen
[1:22:07] and concerning our brother that had gone
[1:22:09] on amen
[1:22:10] and brother to god be the glory after
[1:22:13] that funeral service
[1:22:14] and we were all going out to go to the
[1:22:16] cemetery
[1:22:18] a number of people from the council
[1:22:21] approached me
[1:22:23] because brother manuel preached the word
[1:22:24] and then they said oh they said
[1:22:26] excuse me pastor they said just want to
[1:22:28] tell you this is one of the
[1:22:29] most wonderful funerals that i've ever
[1:22:33] attended
[1:22:34] they said this is oh this is wonderful
[1:22:36] thank you
[1:22:38] thank you for what you said it was
[1:22:40] wonderful and they said
[1:22:41] it it it it's what we needed amen
[1:22:44] it's not what our brother needed he was
[1:22:47] going on
[1:22:48] amen but they felt it was what they
[1:22:50] needed
[1:22:51] amen to god be the glory praise the name
[1:22:54] of the lord
[1:22:55] so brother let's not be we're not
[1:22:56] ashamed of it amen i wasn't ashamed to
[1:22:59] do this it wasn't ashamed to do that
[1:23:01] but emmanuel wasn't ashamed to preach
[1:23:02] this and preach that amen
[1:23:04] but i tell you brother i guess more of
[1:23:07] these so-called
[1:23:08] unbelievers they believed it than the
[1:23:10] believers
[1:23:11] to god be the glory amen
[1:23:14] praise like i said it'll be a funeral
[1:23:16] service that that maybe
[1:23:18] if the others are still alive maybe a
[1:23:20] funeral service that they still remember
[1:23:21] and they'll always remember by the grace
[1:23:24] of god
[1:23:25] amen so let us go forth with that kind
[1:23:27] of a spirit
[1:23:28] and that kind of an attitude and that
[1:23:29] kind of a life amen and opinions
[1:23:32] that they'll respect it by the grace of
[1:23:35] god
[1:23:35] as i've said that in what i've done and
[1:23:38] where i work
[1:23:39] amen they've come to me says oh we know
[1:23:41] you're a christian
[1:23:43] amen oh yeah and you weren't ashamed to
[1:23:46] take your stand
[1:23:48] but they knew that you had a right
[1:23:50] spirit and right attitude
[1:23:51] and that's why we come and respect you
[1:23:53] amen
[1:23:54] we thank you we thank you we thank you
[1:23:56] amen so bro hallelujah
[1:23:58] so brother you go forth and live that
[1:24:00] kind of a life because you've got a

[1:24:06] amen you're there to lift them up
[1:24:08] amen you're not there to condemn them

[1:24:15] grace to this gentleman that gentlemen
[1:24:17] lord grace in these situations have
[1:24:18] mercy lord
[1:24:20] the prophet and again the prophet of god
[1:24:21] reminded us that as long as the bride is
[1:24:24] on the earth there is
[1:24:25] grace amen because the bride is a
[1:24:28] testimony of grace
[1:24:30] and the and the bride's testimony is
[1:24:32] grace amen
[1:24:33] because it's the grace of god that has
[1:24:35] called us it's the grace of god that is
[1:24:37] dealing with us
[1:24:38] asa hallelujah and making us one with
[1:24:40] the word
[1:24:41] and brother we're reaching out to them
[1:24:44] and again i'm so glad as i heard a
[1:24:47] certain ministering brother and i guess
[1:24:48] he's
[1:24:49] close to 80 years old now for sure and
[1:24:51] uh in
[1:24:52] still in western canada and
[1:24:55] as he i've heard preach a number of
[1:24:58] things and i agree with it
[1:24:59] you know i know most preachers and most
[1:25:01] believers today won't have nothing to do
[1:25:02] with it
[1:25:03] and or or to to to acknowledge it and to
[1:25:07] thank god for
[1:25:08] that that spirit or that that time that
[1:25:10] age
[1:25:11] but he did say and he said oh you know
[1:25:15] it's unfortunate that so-called met so
[1:25:16] many believers
[1:25:17] he's preaching even pastors preaching
[1:25:20] the word he said the message
[1:25:21] and he said he said they think god got
[1:25:23] you hanging over hell with a thread
[1:25:25] oh yeah i said they leave believers with
[1:25:27] an impression you're hanging over hell
[1:25:29] with a thread and the least mistake that
[1:25:30] you make
[1:25:31] gone you're gone he said that's not the
[1:25:34] gospel
[1:25:35] amen praise the lord because he oh well
[1:25:39] they take it out of context there where
[1:25:41] and i think it might be in john
[1:25:42] and it says the the the saints are not
[1:25:45] going to sin they won't sin
[1:25:46] but he did say he said if we sin
[1:25:50] if we sin praise the lord we have an
[1:25:52] advocate
[1:25:53] with the father jesus christ the
[1:25:55] righteous amen
[1:25:57] because he's there because we're born in
[1:25:59] sin the nature we're living by is sin
[1:26:02] amen it's a sinful nature amen and he's
[1:26:05] there to intercede for us
[1:26:07] hallelujah praise the lord to bring us
[1:26:09] to that place where we're going beyond
[1:26:11] out of this old body and into a
[1:26:12] glorified body amen
[1:26:14] and there's going to be no sin there and
[1:26:16] i'll tell you i'm longing for that place
[1:26:18] amen through the new birth we're putting
[1:26:21] contact with that place and that place
[1:26:22] is in contact with us
[1:26:24] amen but still we got to deal with and
[1:26:26] fight the
[1:26:27] fight the good fight of faith amen
[1:26:29] overcoming the
[1:26:30] the flesh to give amen to get victory
[1:26:34] over this victory over that
[1:26:35] sometimes that's why he said if we sin
[1:26:37] amen because of that flesh
[1:26:39] he said we got an advocate with the
[1:26:41] father jesus christ the righteous
[1:26:42] amen and he's there hallelujah to get
[1:26:45] forgiveness
[1:26:46] amen by the grace of god so brother
[1:26:49] again
[1:26:49] keep your attitude right keep your
[1:26:50] spirit right it's by grace through faith
[1:26:53] you're saved
[1:26:54] and brother that grace and that faith is
[1:26:55] there to them and he's
[1:26:57] as far as god will lead them amen and
[1:26:59] again it's like that
[1:27:01] that sister and she was a preacher
[1:27:04] that was caught questioning us some
[1:27:08] years ago
[1:27:09] because she was in the same senior's
[1:27:10] home that sister dunford was in a
[1:27:12] that sister shade he was in sister sadie
[1:27:15] dicks
[1:27:15] amen and they recognized sister shady's
[1:27:18] testimony that recognized her faith
[1:27:20] you know in her attitude and her spirit
[1:27:22] it was so right
[1:27:24] amen and she had discernment and
[1:27:27] uh so on and it's like one time she was
[1:27:29] visiting with another old lady there in
[1:27:31] her in her room
[1:27:32] and of course sister said he was in a
[1:27:34] private room and
[1:27:36] then all of a sudden something struck
[1:27:37] her
[1:27:39] and the lady said well what's wrong oh
[1:27:41] she said there's somebody
[1:27:43] in my room and they're they're taking my
[1:27:45] money
[1:27:46] oh yeah she said what oh yes she said
[1:27:49] the lord just revealed it to me
[1:27:51] amen she wasn't ashamed not by any man
[1:27:55] she wasn't ashamed of the gospel she
[1:27:57] wasn't ashamed of jesus
[1:27:58] amen she wasn't ashamed of us we're
[1:28:01] going there to be a witness
[1:28:02] amen not by any maids so she just got up
[1:28:05] and she walked out the door walked down
[1:28:07] the aisle and her room was right down
[1:28:09] the end there and she went in
[1:28:10] sure enough her handbag was there and it
[1:28:13] was open
[1:28:14] and the money was gone amen oh yeah
[1:28:17] i said that's what oh yeah she said
[1:28:19] that's what happened but she said i
[1:28:21] should have responded earlier
[1:28:23] amen and then she would have stopped but
[1:28:26] she gave god the glory
[1:28:27] amen praise the lord she wasn't ashamed
[1:28:30] amen knowing that but all the other
[1:28:32] residents and even the
[1:28:34] the management they knew she wasn't
[1:28:36] ashamed
[1:28:37] no she loved the lord and she didn't
[1:28:39] mind testifying
[1:28:40] amen and there's one sister there
[1:28:42] another sister there that died a few
[1:28:43] years later
[1:28:44] and and they come into her one day and
[1:28:47] they said oh
[1:28:48] excuse me we want to cut your hair no no
[1:28:50] no no she said not cutting my hair no
[1:28:52] more
[1:28:53] no why oh she said well she said aunt
[1:28:56] shade he told me
[1:28:57] she said that's not right according to
[1:28:59] the scriptures amen
[1:29:00] the the bible forbids a woman to cut her
[1:29:03] hair it's their covering
[1:29:04] amen from the lord a and they said oh
[1:29:08] you believe that yes she said i believe
[1:29:10] it she said i believe aunt sadie i
[1:29:11] believe that
[1:29:12] amen so she was a tremendous testimony
[1:29:15] amen
[1:29:16] amen what was her address wanted she
[1:29:18] wasn't ashamed
[1:29:19] amen she wasn't ashamed to take her
[1:29:21] stand for this
[1:29:23] for this for this amen to god
[1:29:26] be the glory amen and as i said
[1:29:29] oh praise the lord what a testimony amen
[1:29:32] because she wasn't ashamed
[1:29:33] to say this do this be this witness and
[1:29:36] that witness
[1:29:37] no because when that when that clergy
[1:29:40] there that was the head of that that
[1:29:41] home at the time
[1:29:42] and he was running the home and he
[1:29:44] called me aside he said oh he said
[1:29:46] pastor
[1:29:47] is everyone in this home was like aunt
[1:29:49] sadie and that's why everybody called
[1:29:50] her aunt sadie
[1:29:52] yeah and they said everybody in this
[1:29:54] room was like her this would be heaven
[1:29:57] what this would be heaven well what kind
[1:30:00] of testimony does she give
[1:30:02] amen but her testimony the life that she
[1:30:05] was living her attitude
[1:30:06] and her actions and reactions it was
[1:30:09] pointing to jesus
[1:30:11] amen it was plenty of glory pointing to
[1:30:13] god
[1:30:14] giving god the preeminence praise the
[1:30:16] name of the lord
[1:30:17] that was her attitude that was her
[1:30:18] spirit amen
[1:30:20] and what brought her to this message oh
[1:30:22] yeah
[1:30:24] it's hard to believe it that somebody
[1:30:26] would come to this message
[1:30:28] based on the revelation amen
[1:30:31] what was it the wedding all concerning
[1:30:34] marriage
[1:30:34] oh yeah marriage marriage and divorce
[1:30:36] and so on the prophet preached
[1:30:38] one of the last sermons that he preached
[1:30:40] amen and he said this is another
[1:30:41] revelation of the seven seals
[1:30:43] amen and then sadie well
[1:30:46] when she heard she wanted to know
[1:30:48] because we used to go from sister
[1:30:49] dunpher's house
[1:30:50] and we just walked a little ways from
[1:30:52] there up to the house that sister sadie
[1:30:54] was living in with her sister and her
[1:30:55] brother-in-law
[1:30:56] and they they were getting old then oh
[1:30:59] yeah
[1:30:59] and she was spiritual at pentecostal
[1:31:03] and she said and she said oh my one
[1:31:06] minute now i gotta
[1:31:07] put this in the mail and but before she
[1:31:10] put anything in the mail
[1:31:11] she would bow ahead and pray she wasn't
[1:31:13] ashamed
[1:31:14] amen brother that was down by them by
[1:31:16] the mailboxes
[1:31:18] and she go down there and hold the
[1:31:20] letter and bow her head and pray
[1:31:21] she she wasn't ashamed amen no matter

[1:31:32] and so eventually after that we went
[1:31:34] over and fellowship with her talk with

[1:31:36] and and eventually all conversations
[1:31:39] ended up
[1:31:40] on the word we talked about the natural
[1:31:42] things of life
[1:31:43] but then the spiritual and finally

[1:33:35] the lord jesus
[1:33:36] christ amen to god be the glory
[1:33:39] we're not ashamed amen and the power of
[1:33:42] god is alien
[1:33:44] that brother that what god did all down
[1:33:46] through the ages
[1:33:47] he said there were those who were
[1:33:48] ashamed of it and those who weren't
[1:33:50] ashamed of it
[1:33:51] but god was looking for those who
[1:33:53] weren't ashamed amen
[1:33:54] your attitude was right your spirit the
[1:33:56] word the word was right
[1:33:57] amen amen that you weren't you weren't
[1:34:00] born of a church you were born of jesus
[1:34:02] you were born of god amen
[1:34:04] and you are more than willing to lay
[1:34:06] down your life as he lay down his
[1:34:09] by the grace of god amen he said yes
[1:34:13] he said it shows you are not sure of
[1:34:15] this or sure that
[1:34:16] if you're embarrassed he says so you
[1:34:19] would rather
[1:34:19] not discuss the subject and if you're
[1:34:22] going to be ashamed of it
[1:34:23] he said you wouldn't want to discuss it
[1:34:25] you will hold back
[1:34:27] but he said if you're a christian you're
[1:34:28] not ashamed of it amen you want the
[1:34:31] truth
[1:34:32] you're going to stay with the truth amen
[1:34:34] and yet there are certain issues
[1:34:36] and there are certain teachings that
[1:34:37] believers are ashamed

[1:34:40] of that i wouldn't i won't i won't let
[1:34:42] them this tell them this i won't tell
[1:34:43] them that

[1:34:47] let them
[1:34:48] listen to marriage and divorce we
[1:34:50] certainly wouldn't give them that tape
[1:34:52] we would think we'll give them this and
[1:34:53] wait till they come in the message after
[1:34:55] a while they believe this believe this
[1:34:56] then we'll give them marriage and
[1:34:57] divorce
[1:34:59] but sister don't forgive him the first
[1:35:01] one because she thought it was such a
[1:35:03] tremendous truth
[1:35:05] amen and she knew that one of the
[1:35:07] greatest problems that the world was
[1:35:08] dealing with
[1:35:09] was marriage and divorce and this would
[1:35:12] answer the questions
[1:35:13] amen i'm sure that sister said he had
[1:35:15] praise the lord
[1:35:16] and of course she was a widow for many
[1:35:18] years amen

[1:42:43] brother again because they knew my faith
[1:42:45] and knew this and that
[1:42:47] even though they weren't this or they
[1:42:49] weren't spiritual
[1:42:50] all together but they knew oh yeah they
[1:42:53] respected began what i was believing and
[1:42:56] they were
[1:42:57] water is this all right is this all
[1:42:58] right to do uh gerald
[1:43:00] you know that's what they were calling
[1:43:02] me and as
[1:43:03] as christians does god want this or does
[1:43:07] god don't want that
[1:43:08] and so i had to explain to them what
[1:43:10] what the attitude should be
[1:43:11] of workers there and so on amen
[1:43:15] oh what a tremendous testimony they were
[1:43:18] pulling out of your servant

[1:43:26] giving god the glory
[1:43:28] amen amen let's give god the glory
[1:43:31] in your testimony and you understand
[1:43:33] your taking by the grace of almighty god
[1:43:36] amen so that you're not ashamed
[1:43:39] to be a witness when it comes to family
[1:43:42] friends and neighbors
[1:43:43] amen whether it's at work at school as
[1:43:46] university you're not ashamed
[1:43:48] no amen you're going to be a witness

[1:43:57] jesus in you
[1:43:58] amen so the grace of god be with us
[1:44:00] brother god requires your testimony
[1:44:03] at home you know god requires your
[1:44:06] testimony
[1:44:06] in the midst of family and friends and
[1:44:09] then
[1:44:09] sometimes it's not necessarily what
[1:44:10] you're saying it's what you're living
[1:44:13] and what you do and what you don't do
[1:44:15] and they know it and they respect it
[1:44:17] by the grace of god amen so god of us
[1:44:20] that we're not ashamed
[1:44:22] to be a witness to family friends or
[1:44:24] neighbors
[1:44:25] we're going to take our stand in the
[1:44:28] midst of family
[1:44:29] friends and neighbors and i thank god
[1:44:32] that for the witness that we've given
[1:44:35] and that family is not necessarily
[1:44:36] pulling away from us
[1:44:37] but they just put themselves under guard
[1:44:39] when they when when they're with us
[1:44:41] or where we are with them amen because
[1:44:44] they respect us
[1:44:45] and justice just again when myself and
[1:44:48] sister betty was visiting
[1:44:49] it was family and we weren't
[1:44:53] being overly s religious
[1:44:56] in talking to saying this and saying
[1:44:58] that no but
[1:45:00] yeah well the wives of one of our
[1:45:03] brothers
[1:45:04] oh blasted us
[1:45:08] yeah and i said what's wrong with her
[1:45:11] she must have a spirit honor for sure
[1:45:14] and she will be religious herself
[1:45:16] and oh she blasted us for this and
[1:45:18] blasted us for that
[1:45:19] and uh and her husband was was there and
[1:45:21] he said hey hey hey
[1:45:22] wait wait he said you leave that alone
[1:45:26] he says that's what they believe this is
[1:45:28] what we believe they said they'll
[1:45:30] respect us
[1:45:31] you respect them so he said hold your
[1:45:33] peace
[1:45:35] and that was a number of years ago and
[1:45:37] she's never
[1:45:38] never criticized us or condemned us
[1:45:42] since
[1:45:43] amen do god be the glory amen
[1:45:47] so brother what are they doing brother i
[1:45:50] tell you
[1:45:51] there's sometimes there's a spirit there
[1:45:53] to crucify the word
[1:45:54] in you yeah he was crucified in jesus
[1:45:58] and he's crucified in the bride amen
[1:46:01] because the bride is going to lay down
[1:46:02] her life
[1:46:04] for him lay down her life for what god
[1:46:07] wants to do
[1:46:08] and that's the resurrection and the
[1:46:09] rapture praise the lord
[1:46:12] and we're going to lay down our lives
[1:46:13] for the revelation of what god
[1:46:15] is doing amen
[1:46:18] the grace of god be with us again the
[1:46:21] scripture

[2:05:26] was that there was some years ago i
[2:05:28] mentioned it
[2:05:30] about going to heaven and someone had
[2:05:32] the dream or a vision of something going
[2:05:34] to heaven and
[2:05:34] all the angel was there outside the gate
[2:05:37] and uh
[2:05:38] the gate was closed and he come they
[2:05:40] come up they always said
[2:05:41] what's your faith oh i'm
[2:05:44] i'm what i call it
[2:05:48] i'm this and i'm that and oh
[2:05:51] i'll come soon what are they
[2:05:55] yes yep

[2:06:07] believe this
[2:06:08] oh you believe that yeah
[2:06:12] oh well very good i'm glad you believed
[2:06:15] it so you just stand aside that's still
[2:06:16] not still on what your faith is in
[2:06:19] well my faith isn't what god did through
[2:06:20] them oh yeah
[2:06:22] but there's there's a faith that god's
[2:06:23] looking for to open that gate
[2:06:26] and so they went over and stopped
[2:06:28] talking to somebody else another one
[2:06:29] come off
[2:06:30] oh what do you believe oh uh i believe
[2:06:32] in i'm sanctified
[2:06:34] yeah and so on i believe in that okay
[2:06:38] that you expect that to get you into
[2:06:39] heaven yes yes
[2:06:41] yeah no he said you better go over there
[2:06:43] with the mormon
[2:06:44] with the with the luther's
[2:06:47] group and talk to them and uh so then
[2:06:51] the pentecostal came up they said oh
[2:06:53] what is what is your password to open
[2:06:55] the gate
[2:06:56] oh he said uh i believe in the baptism
[2:06:59] of the holy ghost i believe in the gifts
[2:07:01] of the spirit
[2:07:01] all you do and that's your salvation yes
[2:07:04] your redemption yes yes yeah
[2:07:06] praise the lord oh he said very good he
[2:07:09] said but that's not what we're looking
[2:07:10] for
[2:07:11] he said go over there there's something
[2:07:14] that
[2:07:15] the lutherans and the methodists and the
[2:07:16] pentecostals and all the others
[2:07:19] would have in common that would open the
[2:07:22] gate
[2:07:23] and they finally came up this young boy
[2:07:26] and he the angel said to him he said
[2:07:28] excuse me son
[2:07:29] he said what is your password
[2:07:33] and he said oh my password is i
[2:07:36] trust in the blood of our lord jesus
[2:07:38] christ
[2:07:39] he redeemed me amen through calvary
[2:07:44] well and the angel didn't ever say
[2:07:46] anything the gate opened
[2:07:48] amen and he went in yeah
[2:07:52] why oh he might have been a methodist he
[2:07:54] might have been a baptist he might have
[2:07:55] been a pentecostal
[2:07:56] he might have been some other church
[2:07:57] amen but his faith
[2:07:59] wasn't in the these this doctrine that
[2:08:02] doctrine
[2:08:02] his faith was in jesus amen
[2:08:06] jesus the finished work of calvary and
[2:08:09] the gate
[2:08:09] automatically opened the angel didn't
[2:08:13] have to do it
[2:08:14] amen and he went on into glory amen
[2:08:18] so brother amen the same with us oh well
[2:08:22] uh i i believe this oh i believe the
[2:08:24] seals are open
[2:08:25] i believe this and i believe that oh
[2:08:27] yeah well that's good glad good
[2:08:29] but what's your faith in that'll open
[2:08:31] the gate there
[2:08:33] the revelation of of justification won't
[2:08:35] open the gate the revelation of
[2:08:37] sanctification won't open the gate
[2:08:39] the the baptism and the gifts of the
[2:08:41] spirit that revelation you can declare
[2:08:42] it all you want not going to open the
[2:08:44] gate
[2:08:45] where's your faith amen
[2:08:48] in jesus that brought you to those
[2:08:50] revelations amen
[2:08:52] and oh well i believe god sent a prophet
[2:08:54] i believe the seals are open oh
[2:08:56] that won't open the gate and the thing
[2:08:58] of it is
[2:08:59] who revealed it who did it
[2:09:02] willem brown no no no no sorry that
[2:09:06] won't open the gate
[2:09:08] jesus did it amen
[2:09:11] praise the lord and with his stripes i'm
[2:09:13] healed and he was wounded for
[2:09:15] my transgressions he was bruised for my
[2:09:20] iniquities
[2:09:21] and the chastisement of my peace was
[2:09:23] upon him it's all jesus
[2:09:25] amen not william branham not martin
[2:09:27] luther not john wesley not william booth
[2:09:29] not this one that one amen now it's
[2:09:32] jesus
[2:09:33] again as the prophet said you know what
[2:09:35] your problem is
[2:09:37] he said you can't see the other angel
[2:09:40] he said i am not the son of man
[2:09:44] he said i am a son of man he said but
[2:09:48] i'm revealing
[2:09:49] the son of man jesus and that's the one
[2:09:52] he wanted them to see
[2:09:53] with jesus not william brennan and
[2:09:56] that's why god had to take him off the
[2:09:58] sea
[2:09:59] amen because they were focusing more and
[2:10:01] more and more
[2:10:02] on william branham they wanted him they
[2:10:04] wanted all the signs and wonders you did
[2:10:06] oh no he says that me it's jesus he said
[2:10:08] i can't do this
[2:10:10] no he and he told him that over and over
[2:10:12] again i can't do it he said
[2:10:14] i'm just waiting on him he said he'll do
[2:10:16] it grace of god
[2:10:19] amen and uh
[2:10:23] you know it's amazing that your faith in
[2:10:26] jesus can bring that look at what
[2:10:28] john look what uh jack coe
[2:10:31] did yeah
[2:10:35] and you know what i saw i was just
[2:10:36] looking at a film a couple days ago
[2:10:39] and jack cole i said oh
[2:10:44] jack cole and
[2:10:47] he was talking there and and the and the
[2:10:50] brothers behind him oh i said that's the
[2:10:54] same place
[2:10:55] it's the same pulpit i said that brother
[2:10:57] branham was preaching in
[2:10:58] and the same people are behind him
[2:11:02] and this time it was jacob and it was in
[2:11:03] washington
[2:11:06] and it was because they went they
[2:11:09] they turned their camera at one point
[2:11:11] there and
[2:11:12] toward the balcony and they were
[2:11:14] standing all stood up
[2:11:16] and there was one person that was stood
[2:11:17] up william branham
[2:11:21] yeah that film was on on the internet
[2:11:22] there and it was william branham
[2:11:26] and i think brother jack cohen did make
[2:11:28] a reference when he was preaching there
[2:11:29] he made a reference to william branham
[2:11:31] and so on and what brother brahma said
[2:11:34] and what brother ram had done and so on
[2:11:35] and so he started prayer line brother
[2:11:38] jack cole this is amazing
[2:11:41] absolutely amazing the power the
[2:11:43] anointing the faith
[2:11:45] that was being manifested he's just
[2:11:49] there and
[2:11:50] praying for and and well i guess the
[2:11:52] devil was afraid of him
[2:11:55] for sure why because he really
[2:11:58] rebuked the devil he really kicked the
[2:12:00] devil out he really you know
[2:12:02] forced the devil and he just always
[2:12:04] satan come out in the name of jesus
[2:12:06] you're gone
[2:12:07] yeah and he lays on that person and
[2:12:10] claimed the victory and they're gone
[2:12:11] healed
[2:12:12] the next one comes up and he all your
[2:12:14] scream at that old devil
[2:12:16] gone they're healed yeah amen
[2:12:20] but again he was evangelist amen but
[2:12:23] brother brown was a prophet
[2:12:25] my brother brown just talked quietly
[2:12:28] and you know he didn't have the ball
[2:12:31] like brother jack cole
[2:12:32] amen just talk quietly said all right
[2:12:35] satan in the name of jesus
[2:12:39] move out of this child in the name of
[2:12:41] jesus move away from this woman
[2:12:43] we're pleading the blood of jesus get
[2:12:45] away satan and of course
[2:12:46] satan was gone they were healed praise
[2:12:49] the lord
[2:12:50] amen well it's online jack called yeah
[2:12:53] and you when you see it you'll see
[2:12:55] exactly the same thing that was there
[2:12:57] when brother bannon
[2:12:58] was preaching praise the lord
[2:13:01] and brother brown did highlight it he
[2:13:03] got it william branham well brown did
[2:13:04] highlight him a couple of times
[2:13:06] amen jack cole and how you said you you
[2:13:08] look up and you when he sees the
[2:13:11] one in the balcony and he's one of them
[2:13:14] is william
[2:13:15] watching jack coe amen
[2:13:19] oh god help us my brother that was good
[2:13:22] jackal was good but he was gone when he
[2:13:24] was only 38 39 years old lord took him
[2:13:27] off the scene
[2:13:28] amen amen because god was moving william
[2:13:30] brown i mean
[2:13:32] amen and some of those ministries that
[2:13:34] god took would it would have taken the
[2:13:36] distract the people from william branham
[2:13:38] from other preachers
[2:13:39] to that brother amen but like the
[2:13:43] problem of god said there was three
[2:13:44] ministering brethren and it was jack not
[2:13:47] jacob
[2:13:48] with oral roberts billy graham and
[2:13:50] william branham
[2:13:52] and he said this was oral robert's
[2:13:54] testimony
[2:13:55] this was billy graham's testimony and he
[2:13:57] said this was the testimony of the
[2:13:59] prophet
[2:14:00] amen by the grace of god god helped us
[2:14:02] to believe
[2:14:03] that it was him it was jesus in control
[2:14:08] amen i got a finished oh my
[2:14:14] and again verse 18 he said if the
[2:14:16] righteous scarcely be saved
[2:14:18] where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[2:14:20] appear
[2:14:22] god help us amen wherefore let them that
[2:14:26] suffer according to the will of god
[2:14:29] commit the keeping of
[2:14:30] their souls to him in well-doing
[2:14:34] as unto a faithful creator
[2:14:38] hallelujah new creatures in christ
[2:14:42] praise the lord amen and i thought for
[2:14:44] sure i go up and read the scriptures and
[2:14:46] finish the quotes well that's different
[2:14:50] that's my thoughts not his thoughts god
[2:14:52] help us
[2:14:54] let me finish with these thoughts here
[2:14:58] in the message ashamed
[2:15:03] and he said you should see those people
[2:15:09] that word is sinking in where sometimes
[2:15:11] we don't know it
[2:15:14] and a brother had just testified to
[2:15:16] brother branham concerning
[2:15:18] all the offerings that he had taken
[2:15:21] from the people for brother branham he
[2:15:24] said brother brown
[2:15:25] this is what the people give us to give
[2:15:28] you
[2:15:29] and it was a lot of offerings brother
[2:15:32] brown was shocked
[2:15:34] and he said see those people that word
[2:15:36] is sinking in where sometimes we don't
[2:15:39] know it
[2:15:40] and he said when he said no matter how
[2:15:42] much the world is against it
[2:15:44] is your denominations are against it and
[2:15:46] god is proving it to be the truth
[2:15:48] and he said when the great hour finally
[2:15:50] strikes
[2:15:52] he says things will happen maybe
[2:15:55] that we didn't think about and that's
[2:15:58] the truth
[2:15:59] i tell you what god did in the ministry
[2:16:01] of william brown
[2:16:02] things were happening that they didn't
[2:16:04] think about they didn't know god was
[2:16:06] going to do this
[2:16:06] god was going to do that they weren't
[2:16:08] aware of the opening of the seven seals
[2:16:10] and god finishing the mystery of god no
[2:16:13] they just thought god was going to go on
[2:16:14] and on and on
[2:16:15] with an oral roberts ministry of billy
[2:16:17] graham ministry a.a allen ministry
[2:16:20] t.l osborne ministry signs and wonders
[2:16:22] signs and wonders signs and wonders
[2:16:24] yes but god had ordained the ministry of
[2:16:27] a prophet
[2:16:28] amen to reveal the word that would give
[2:16:30] us rapturing faith
[2:16:32] amen not faith just for more signs and
[2:16:34] wonders but faith to get out of here
[2:16:37] faith to go home to be with the lord
[2:16:40] amen that's the truth
[2:16:43] because i remember back there 55 years
[2:16:45] ago
[2:16:46] that that this ministry was there that
[2:16:48] ministry was there we were all listening
[2:16:50] to
[2:16:50] a allen listening to t.l osborne
[2:16:52] listening to oral roberts
[2:16:54] and occasionally like i said we missed
[2:16:56] we would listen to our brother billy
[2:16:57] graham
[2:16:58] and as i said that's that's what we
[2:17:00] listen to every every sunday when we're
[2:17:02] having our supper
[2:17:03] my my father would go over and turn the
[2:17:05] radio on and listen to billy graham
[2:17:08] amen so brother but then then there was
[2:17:10] a oral roberts and there was a a allen
[2:17:12] there was still also osborne we were
[2:17:13] getting their magazines
[2:17:15] and we're seeing what god was doing in
[2:17:16] their ministry signs and wonders
[2:17:18] amen but then the prophet came on the
[2:17:22] scene
[2:17:23] amen oh yeah and here was sister branham
[2:17:27] that had a she had a record that was the
[2:17:30] old-fashioned records back then
[2:17:32] and somebody had loaned her a record
[2:17:33] they said oh sister burns
[2:17:35] you're going to love this this is
[2:17:37] brother william branham's testimony
[2:17:40] now they weren't recognizing a prophet
[2:17:42] but they're recognizing a man that was
[2:17:43] used of god
[2:17:44] to do this to do that and they gave
[2:17:47] sister burns the record
[2:17:48] of brother brown's life story and
[2:17:52] sister byron listened to it and she
[2:17:54] loved what she was hearing she was
[2:17:56] praising god
[2:17:57] amen and then later on
[2:18:00] not not very long after that that she
[2:18:02] had heard that record
[2:18:03] amen she was she was receiving
[2:18:08] magazines from like teal osborne a.a
[2:18:12] allen
[2:18:13] and other magazines i'm not sure it was
[2:18:15] what one it was
[2:18:16] but there was one that she received and
[2:18:20] she was shocked when she opened it and
[2:18:22] saw it on the cover
[2:18:24] in memory of william branham
[2:18:28] and the dates of his birth the date of
[2:18:29] his death sister brennan was shocked
[2:18:33] and it struck her and she cried
[2:18:36] oh yeah she was sitting in her home and
[2:18:38] she cried oh my lord
[2:18:40] what have you done you have taken him
[2:18:42] off the scene
[2:18:44] and lord the ministry that he had always
[2:18:46] struck her
[2:18:47] and she i think she went back and to
[2:18:49] listen to the record again
[2:18:51] amen and it that was in in
[2:18:54] april or may or march or april when the
[2:18:58] no you it was not december 65
[2:19:02] and yes this was in 1966 she got the
[2:19:05] magazine
[2:19:06] and they honored reverend william
[2:19:08] branham gone to be with the lord
[2:19:11] and from there on apparently they
[2:19:13] started to get more and more into
[2:19:15] search william brown's testimony william
[2:19:17] brown's witness and so on
[2:19:19] amen until finally someone sent them
[2:19:22] more information
[2:19:23] of william branham the prophet you know
[2:19:26] and that's what brought us into the
[2:19:28] message amen
[2:19:30] oh yes what happened was she met
[2:19:33] somebody
[2:19:34] that her brother barnes met certain
[2:19:36] person
[2:19:38] and i know who that person was and there
[2:19:40] was a person that had a store
[2:19:41] not far from brother burns and brother
[2:19:44] barnes went up that went into the store
[2:19:45] to buy some groceries and food and
[2:19:47] things
[2:19:48] and the gentleman that was behind the
[2:19:50] counter serving and he owned it all
[2:19:52] and he said
[2:19:55] oh he said you you people are like uh
[2:19:58] are like the believers in central
[2:20:00] newfoundland so what
[2:20:02] where he said bishop falls he said
[2:20:06] they believe what you believe they're
[2:20:07] like that they're not denominational and
[2:20:09] so on
[2:20:10] oh so that's what that's what
[2:20:13] sold the seed for brother burns to
[2:20:15] eventually get in contact with him
[2:20:17] and brother as i said i was in gamble
[2:20:19] for the first
[2:20:22] cottage meeting that those those
[2:20:24] brethren held
[2:20:26] brother brother cater was there with the
[2:20:28] films and
[2:20:29] of course he rented the the the theater
[2:20:31] that was in dark cope gamble
[2:20:33] he rented the theater and i remember
[2:20:36] being in the theater and watching the
[2:20:38] films of brother branham
[2:20:39] then we went on with brother emanuel
[2:20:41] after that and we had a cottage meeting
[2:20:43] in sister golding's house
[2:20:45] a man and uh of course the brother burns
[2:20:48] was there sister burns was there and i
[2:20:50] was there
[2:20:51] and the first sermon i heard was serpent
[2:20:53] seed
[2:20:55] yeah the original scene and so on what
[2:20:57] was going on they said what you heard
[2:20:59] that one first yeah
[2:21:00] i said it struck me and i said amen i
[2:21:01] believe it
[2:21:03] and i was just just a teenager i said i
[2:21:05] believe that
[2:21:06] i said i'll say it the lord amen that's
[2:21:09] good
[2:21:10] so from there on we started to grow and
[2:21:12] mature in the word
[2:21:13] amen to bring me to this place
[2:21:16] amen and now many of them most of all of
[2:21:19] them
[2:21:20] are gone so i pray the grace of god to
[2:21:23] take us on to the rapture
[2:21:25] amen brother it's been 55 years
[2:21:29] god help us amen
[2:21:32] but i pray yeah god took the prophet
[2:21:35] brother we now we want him to take us
[2:21:39] into the resurrection into the rapture
[2:21:41] by the grace of god
[2:21:43] amen yes
[2:21:47] why lord are we still here i think
[2:21:49] brother jonathan must mention 55 years
[2:21:53] and why are we still here now amen
[2:21:57] trust by grace said that all the seed of
[2:22:00] god the bride of christ
[2:22:01] is in the word brothers not just calling
[2:22:04] christians
[2:22:05] no no that's out there god got them out
[2:22:08] there doing that as the problem god said
[2:22:10] let me say it again he said now he said
[2:22:12] we won't get this message to
[2:22:14] to all out there to the world no no
[2:22:17] but but it's only for the bride amen
[2:22:21] so as as all the bride been gathered in
[2:22:24] as all the bride been called amen and
[2:22:27] it's to get our attention
[2:22:28] to the resurrection and rapture to give
[2:22:30] us the faith that pleases god now
[2:22:32] not faith to go to another church not
[2:22:34] faith just to do this just to do that no
[2:22:36] faith for to get out of here how many
[2:22:39] want to get out of here
[2:22:41] god help us i tell you
[2:22:44] because of the worldly conditions and
[2:22:47] everything there are fewer and fewer who
[2:22:49] really
[2:22:49] want to get out i believe if you want to
[2:22:52] get out you're going to put more
[2:22:53] emphasis on it
[2:22:55] you want to get out you're going to
[2:22:56] start praying more talking to the lord
[2:22:58] about it
[2:22:58] lord where's the resurrection even
[2:23:00] concerning what's going on out here now
[2:23:02] around the world i tell you the
[2:23:05] brightest is focusing not on that
[2:23:07] the bride's focusing on the resurrection
[2:23:09] lord the hours come please take us home
[2:23:11] lord
[2:23:12] we want to go home we want to go home
[2:23:16] how many really want to get out of here
[2:23:19] amen not because of what's going on
[2:23:21] there but because what's going on in our
[2:23:23] souls
[2:23:24] amen
[2:23:29] so he said
[2:23:33] how can a man who is filled with the
[2:23:34] holy spirit
[2:23:36] the holy ghost how can a man full of the
[2:23:39] power of god
[2:23:40] the love of god in his heart talk to a
[2:23:43] man a few minutes
[2:23:44] and not mention something about that
[2:23:47] love that is in
[2:23:48] your heart amen
[2:23:51] of your true relationship with jesus
[2:23:55] amen he said must be that
[2:23:58] he said this is must be that evil day
[2:24:01] that jesus was speaking of
[2:24:03] and he said people are ashamed of the
[2:24:06] word
[2:24:07] amen and of the spirit of god that acts
[2:24:10] within them but when the truth is made
[2:24:14] plain
[2:24:15] to the people god himself
[2:24:18] is revealing himself through the word
[2:24:21] amen
[2:24:23] so he said in the last days the spirit
[2:24:26] will be so close
[2:24:27] it would deceive the elect if possible
[2:24:31] amen but he said when it comes to a
[2:24:33] genuine alter to unadulterated word of
[2:24:35] god
[2:24:36] confirmed by god it seems to even
[2:24:39] embarrass
[2:24:40] the other group amen
[2:24:43] listen he said there is an embarrassment
[2:24:47] about it well
[2:24:50] ashamed those that are ashamed they feel
[2:24:53] embarrassed
[2:24:54] having to take their stand for this or
[2:24:56] for this or for that
[2:24:57] they feel that's not necessary god's not
[2:25:00] in this god's not in there oh yes he is
[2:25:02] amen remember he said in the beginning
[2:25:05] god did this and god did that
[2:25:07] and then at the end he said concerning
[2:25:09] the revelation of god
[2:25:10] he said don't add to it don't take from
[2:25:12] it
[2:25:14] amen and that's why again john prayed
[2:25:16] the grace of god to us
[2:25:18] because there's people still wanting to
[2:25:20] add to their relationship with god they
[2:25:22] want to take away their
[2:25:23] from their relationship with god oh lord
[2:25:26] i don't believe you want to support the
[2:25:28] emphasis on this they're on that nor
[2:25:30] shall we we'll just lay that aside no
[2:25:31] god wants you to keep it amen don't add
[2:25:34] to it don't take from it
[2:25:36] amen i tell you hallelujah
[2:25:39] if there's anything that brighter that
[2:25:41] the message is creating today
[2:25:43] it's the call in the bride this remember
[2:25:46] the bible says
[2:25:47] the spirit and the bride say come
[2:25:51] amen praise the name of the lord
[2:25:54] so i pray i pray that we're under the
[2:25:56] anointing of the spirit
[2:25:58] we're the bride amen come
[2:26:02] for all things are ready by the grace of
[2:26:05] god
[2:26:06] amen
[2:26:10] i'll just say do another quote
[2:26:15] and he said you listen
[2:26:18] to it not whether my wife as a christian
[2:26:22] good christian or my husband is a good
[2:26:24] christian but he said i
[2:26:26] am am i right with god that's it
[2:26:29] are you right with god yeah
[2:26:33] is your attitude toward god right your
[2:26:35] attitude toward jesus right
[2:26:37] amen do you really really truly
[2:26:40] have a personal relationship with jesus
[2:26:42] not an intellectual knowledge of jesus
[2:26:44] an intellectual revelation of jesus but
[2:26:47] a spiritual
[2:26:48] experience with jesus amen remember
[2:26:51] we need a spiritual experience so that
[2:26:54] he's in us
[2:26:55] to take us out amen we've got to have an
[2:26:58] experience with jesus of the
[2:27:00] resurrection
[2:27:00] and the rapture i've been born again
[2:27:04] yeah i'm a new creature in christ in my
[2:27:07] soul
[2:27:07] but lord where's my body
[2:27:10] where's the new body amen
[2:27:13] amen that's what we're believing for a
[2:27:16] new body
[2:27:17] jesus laid down is and picked it up
[2:27:20] again
[2:27:20] amen we couldn't do that amen
[2:27:24] but we can lay down in our faith
[2:27:27] believing that jesus is going to raise
[2:27:28] it again in a new in a glorified body
[2:27:31] boy because jesus picked up his body
[2:27:33] come back to share the life of that body
[2:27:36] with us amen praise the lord
[2:27:39] because we're going to receive a new
[2:27:41] body like onto his glorious body
[2:27:45] amen
[2:27:48] and she said i have i met jesus not
[2:27:51] because i shouted
[2:27:52] not because i spoke in tongues but
[2:27:54] because i met him as a person
[2:27:57] then he said you will never be ashamed
[2:27:59] of that there is something
[2:28:01] that's so perfect and pure and true
[2:28:04] and remember you you might meet a spirit
[2:28:08] that would
[2:28:09] act like god you might meet a spirit
[2:28:11] would do this or the other
[2:28:13] follow it a little bit and see how it
[2:28:16] compares with the word of god
[2:28:18] he said you might meet a spirit that
[2:28:20] would tell you you are saved
[2:28:23] and give you a glorious feeling and you
[2:28:25] would shout
[2:28:26] and scream and then he said when it
[2:28:29] comes to denying the word
[2:28:31] how can the holy spirit that wrote the
[2:28:33] word deny the word
[2:28:36] so they got an experience with god but
[2:28:38] they can have it in their flesh
[2:28:40] yeah in their spirit but not in their
[2:28:41] soul god help us
[2:28:44] we preached on that the three kinds of
[2:28:46] believers amen
[2:28:48] god help us make sure you're a believer
[2:28:51] and you're a believer out of your soul
[2:28:53] by the grace of god amen
[2:29:00] again you might meet a spirit that will
[2:29:02] tell you you are saved
[2:29:04] give you a glorious feeling and you will
[2:29:06] shout and scream
[2:29:09] and then when it comes to denying the
[2:29:10] word how can the holy spirit that wrote
[2:29:13] the word
[2:29:13] deny his own word if he's in your soul
[2:29:17] he won't deny it
[2:29:18] that spirit must punctuate every promise
[2:29:21] of god with an amen
[2:29:23] if it hasn't if it isn't then you never
[2:29:26] met god
[2:29:27] he said you meet a deceiving spirit the
[2:29:30] world
[2:29:31] is full of those deceiving spirits today
[2:29:35] god help us amen so i pray the grace of
[2:29:38] god
[2:29:40] that will not be deceived amen with a
[2:29:42] wrong spirit
[2:29:44] a false spirit but we'll stay with the
[2:29:46] word by the grace of god
[2:29:48] amen and no matter what god requires of
[2:29:51] us no matter what god wants to do
[2:29:52] through us
[2:29:53] we're not going to be ashamed of it no
[2:29:56] god wants us to do this and act like
[2:29:58] this and live like that we're
[2:30:00] going to do it lord jesus lead us and
[2:30:01] we'll follow we're not ashamed of it
[2:30:04] amen so grace grace grace
