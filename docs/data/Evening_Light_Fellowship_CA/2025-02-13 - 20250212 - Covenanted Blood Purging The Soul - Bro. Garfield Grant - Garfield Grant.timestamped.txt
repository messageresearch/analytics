[50:29] Bibles to the book of Deuteronomy
[50:37] 30 and verse
[50:43] one and it
[50:47] reads and it come and it shall come to
[50:51] pass when all these things are come upon
[50:54] thee the blessing and the
[50:57] curse which I have set before thee and
[51:01] thou shalt call them to
[51:04] mine among all the nation where the Lord
[51:08] thy God has driven
[51:11] thee and shall return unto the Lord thy
[51:16] God and shall obey his voice according
[51:19] to all that I commanded thee this day
[51:22] thou and thy children with all thine
[51:25] heart
[51:27] and with all thy
[51:29] soul and then the Lord thy God will turn
[51:33] thy
[51:35] captivity and have compassion upon thee
[51:39] and will return and gather thee from all
[51:41] the nations whether the Lord thy God has
[51:44] scatter of
[51:45] thee and you know I I'd like to point
[51:48] out here
[51:50] that all that God is doing is his job is
[51:55] he himself s doing the restoration
[52:00] work and he said and he the Lord will
[52:02] restore us to a true position verse four
[52:05] it
[52:06] says and if any of thine be driven out
[52:11] onto the uttermost part of Heaven from
[52:15] then will the Lord thy God will gather
[52:18] thee and from then will he fetch
[52:22] thee by his Sovereign Grace you know we
[52:25] we know tonight that God will go after
[52:28] us amen because we belong to
[52:31] him
[52:34] amen praise God verse five we say that
[52:38] and the Lord thy God will bring thee
[52:41] into the land which thy father as
[52:44] fathers possess and thou shalt possess
[52:48] it and he will do thee good and multiply
[52:51] thee above thy
[52:53] fathers and the Lord thy God will ser
[52:56] circumcise thy
[52:58] heart and the Art of thy of thy seed to
[53:03] love the Lord thy God and with all thine
[53:07] heart and with all thy soul that thou
[53:10] mayest
[53:12] live amen verse 7 and the Lord thy God
[53:17] will put all these curse upon thine
[53:20] enemies and upon them that ate thee
[53:23] which persecuted thee
[53:26] and thou shallal return and obey the
[53:29] voice of the Lord and do all the
[53:31] Commandments which I command thee this
[53:34] day praise God you may be seated
[53:40] tonight you know just
[53:43] to think of this work of restoration or
[53:47] the work of
[53:48] redemption that God didn't committed to
[53:52] a prophet or to anybody but the Lord
[53:54] himself will take the role of
[53:57] restoration of his of his
[53:59] people and you know to bring them back
[54:03] exactly to where God want his people to
[54:05] be restored so the complete Act of
[54:09] restoration uh restoring his bride you
[54:12] know it was done by the Lord
[54:15] himself now that is very important to
[54:18] understanding to the the the work of God
[54:21] or what God had planned for you and I
[54:23] tonight that we are in safe hands
[54:28] praise
[54:29] God and that God made a promise he made
[54:33] a committ to himself that he will
[54:35] restore that he will bring amen a
[54:37] complete
[54:38] restoration and he said there that he
[54:41] will gather Us in other word wherever we
[54:43] are wherever we we we found ourself God
[54:48] will go after his people and God will
[54:51] gather us back to unto himself verse six
[54:55] of the
[54:59] verse
[55:03] six it says here and I quote and the
[55:08] Lord thy God will circumcise thine art
[55:11] and the Art of thy seed to love the Lord
[55:14] thy God with all thine heart and with
[55:17] all thy soul and thou shall
[55:21] live amen praise God so it's this work
[55:25] of God this restor restoration of God
[55:27] Amen to bring you back but not just to
[55:30] bring you back but also to circumcise
[55:33] your heart you know to to to BR give you
[55:36] a new heart to to change the person of
[55:39] who you are from your art and that that
[55:43] changing is not just amen it's not just
[55:45] you doing a work but God working on you
[55:48] really you know God circumcising the
[55:51] Earth so when he brings you back amen he
[55:53] brings you back for one purpose and that
[55:54] is to to circum size your art amen
[55:58] praise God Amen that you will that you
[56:00] will obey God and that you will follow
[56:03] him after his his perfect word are you
[56:05] there with me church and so brother
[56:08] Brenham in the
[56:13] message I
[56:17] me get right
[56:34] let me go a little bit further bear with
[56:37] me a little
[56:43] bit okay uh let me quote it see come
[56:50] here in the message the position of the
[56:53] believer in
[56:55] Christ brother bam said brother bam was
[56:57] quoting from Paul in the book of Hebrews
[57:01] chapter 9 he said for the law having a
[57:03] shadow of good things to come and not
[57:06] the very image of the things can never
[57:09] make those things those sacrifice that
[57:12] offered here by here continually make
[57:15] the Comm unto Perfection now this is
[57:17] brother I'm quoting Paul so bam said
[57:21] that now the subject is perfection
[57:24] because now if God is going to
[57:26] circumcise Your Heart Right God is going
[57:29] to bring us into Perfection that's the
[57:32] purpose why he's working on us really
[57:35] and that is to bring us into Perfection
[57:38] so brother bam said now the subject is
[57:41] perfection now he said how can a moral
[57:44] man ever become perfected he said and
[57:48] yet God said in his word that we that he
[57:51] chose us to be holy perfected before the
[57:54] foundation of the world he said always
[57:57] going to do
[58:01] that he said Jesus said be thou perfect
[58:05] even as your heavenly father is perfect
[58:09] and so this circumcision this is God
[58:12] working on us to perfect us right God
[58:15] bring bringing us into that in in the
[58:17] position of
[58:19] perfection right and so brother Pam said
[58:22] that's exactly what is going to happen
[58:23] to us you see this age in which we're
[58:27] living in church it's an age that God
[58:31] requires
[58:32] Perfection and this Perfection is not
[58:35] just you coming to church but God
[58:39] Hallelujah by his own work by his own
[58:41] Grace you know God is bringing us into
[58:43] this Perfection and so but I'm how can
[58:46] God look at us Church look at look at
[58:48] where we are and what we are tonight but
[58:51] but I'm ask a question how can we be
[58:53] become become perfect well let me tell
[58:56] you tonight that when God works on us
[58:59] when God Chang the heart when God
[59:01] circumcised the heart Hallelujah then
[59:05] God will perfect Us by the circumcision
[59:07] of our
[59:08] heart amen so we say tonight Lord work
[59:12] on me work on me Lord now this
[59:16] Perfection that we speak of you know
[59:19] brother bam speak off that we must
[59:21] attain
[59:24] onto I think I'm right spot there
[59:28] right I'm going to paraphrase uh you
[59:32] know Hebrews chapter 9 coming down to
[59:34] where we at now but we find
[59:40] that Hebrews chapter 9 speaks of you
[59:44] know it speaks of uh the the the the
[59:47] priesthood or or the the the Levites you
[59:49] know they were given a a a job you know
[59:52] by by God you know they administer the
[59:55] office you know they they they they were
[59:57] given that role you know by God for them
[1:00:00] to perform but we find that even though
[1:00:03] in that capacity where you know these
[1:00:06] you know the priests were were given you
[1:00:08] know the office but yet still the Bible
[1:00:11] said Paul said but it could not bring
[1:00:14] Perfection and you know we we find Paul
[1:00:17] in Hebrews chapter 9:6 he said and when
[1:00:20] these things with us are he said the
[1:00:22] priest went into the first Tabernacle to
[1:00:25] accomplish the service of God now we
[1:00:28] understand that when they were given
[1:00:30] this responsibility you know where where
[1:00:33] you know they were to administer the
[1:00:35] office and do all of these things that
[1:00:36] according to what God told them to do
[1:00:38] right the Bible said which was to
[1:00:40] accomplish the service of God but yet
[1:00:42] still you know we look at all of that
[1:00:44] and in in in the eyes of the priest they
[1:00:46] were justifiable to say that well God
[1:00:49] told me to do do this it was God's
[1:00:51] ordinance up upon their lives you know
[1:00:54] to to carry out the the function of of
[1:00:56] of the or to administer the the the the
[1:00:59] the the office of of of priesthood but
[1:01:01] the Bible said but with all that that
[1:01:03] which they were doing it could not bring
[1:01:06] Perfection so I'm saying to us tonight
[1:01:08] that what is this Perfection that God is
[1:01:12] requiring what is it that God is
[1:01:14] requiring for you from you and I because
[1:01:17] if if someone can present a statement to
[1:01:20] say that well God told me to do do this
[1:01:22] but God is looking at the office that
[1:01:24] into which they were doing it and God
[1:01:26] was saying that that listen it could not
[1:01:28] bring
[1:01:29] Perfection and
[1:01:31] so we find that because it was being
[1:01:35] administered by the hands of men and so
[1:01:39] it could not bring the Perfection that
[1:01:41] God was looking for the Bible said in in
[1:01:44] verse 7 that but unto the second went
[1:01:46] the high priest even Aon the Bible said
[1:01:49] that he went the second uh the second
[1:01:52] went into the high priest
[1:01:54] alone that's uh Hebrews
[1:01:57] 9:7 and he said alone once every year he
[1:02:00] said not without blood which he offered
[1:02:03] for himself and for the error of the
[1:02:06] people but the Bible said in verse
[1:02:11] 8 right verse eight it's it's displaying
[1:02:14] yes thank you Lord it says there in
[1:02:17] verse 8 that but the Holy Ghost is
[1:02:20] signifying but the way into the holiest
[1:02:23] was not yet made manifest why the first
[1:02:26] Tabernacle was yet
[1:02:28] standing in other
[1:02:30] word with all of that all the works are
[1:02:35] performed but because the Holy Ghost was
[1:02:38] not yet given it could not bring
[1:02:42] Perfection because you see it was it was
[1:02:45] done and truly it was done spiritually
[1:02:47] according to what God told them but
[1:02:50] because the Bible said because the way
[1:02:53] into the holiest was not made known
[1:02:55] because because the Holy Ghost was not
[1:02:57] yet given and so it could not be
[1:03:00] perfection without the Holy Ghost
[1:03:02] there's no Perfection
[1:03:05] really amen and so the Bible said let me
[1:03:08] read again verse 8 it said the Holy
[1:03:10] Ghost does signify that the way into the
[1:03:13] holiest was of all was not yet made
[1:03:17] manifest while the first Tabernacle was
[1:03:21] standing and so the priests they
[1:03:23] administering the office doing all the
[1:03:25] God told them to do but
[1:03:28] because there was a greater meaning
[1:03:32] Hallelujah than just simply doing
[1:03:34] exactly you know they were doing it but
[1:03:38] it wasn't according to amen they were
[1:03:41] doing it but it it the Holy Ghost was
[1:03:43] not yet given and so it could not reach
[1:03:46] to to the extent of what God had
[1:03:47] intended for and so the works that were
[1:03:50] being performed amen it could not bring
[1:03:53] Perfection church because it was L by
[1:03:56] human hands it could not produce the
[1:03:58] works that God was expecting for for it
[1:04:00] to be done and verse 9 it says which was
[1:04:04] a figure for the time then in which were
[1:04:07] offered both gifts and sacrifice that
[1:04:09] could not make him that do the service
[1:04:11] of God perfect as pertained to the
[1:04:15] conscience now this is where I want to
[1:04:17] go tonight because you see to bring
[1:04:19] Perfection really the conscience will
[1:04:22] have to be
[1:04:23] clear Hallelujah to bring Perfection God
[1:04:27] it had to had to be it had to move from
[1:04:30] just simply doing a work by human hands
[1:04:33] and it have to go straight into the
[1:04:35] heart and and so the conscience the
[1:04:39] consciences were being record the Bible
[1:04:41] said that every year they went and they
[1:04:43] do the same thing the Bible said there
[1:04:45] was a remembrance of of of of the same
[1:04:48] thing that was done every here and for
[1:04:51] the fact that there was a remembrance it
[1:04:52] mean that the sin the offering couldn't
[1:04:55] not reach the heart to change the
[1:04:58] heartart all right and so am and so the
[1:05:01] conscience were being recall that there
[1:05:04] was not a change that has taken place
[1:05:06] from the
[1:05:08] inside and the Bible said that all that
[1:05:11] they were doing the Bible said which
[1:05:13] stood only in meat and drink and diverse
[1:05:16] washing and carnal ordinances imposed
[1:05:19] upon them until the time of reformation
[1:05:28] praise the
[1:05:30] Lord just bear with me a little
[1:05:43] bit and verse 12 it said never by the
[1:05:45] blood of goats and
[1:05:47] calf but by his own blood he enter once
[1:05:52] into the holy Place having obtained
[1:05:56] Eternal Redemption for
[1:05:59] us for if the blood of bull and
[1:06:04] goat and the ash of the effers
[1:06:07] sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the
[1:06:10] purifying of the flesh it said how much
[1:06:13] more shall the blood of Christ who
[1:06:16] through the eternal spirit offer himself
[1:06:19] without spot unto God purging your
[1:06:22] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[1:06:25] living
[1:06:26] God and so
[1:06:29] God he promised that he would clear the
[1:06:35] conscience but how could he do
[1:06:37] that it's only when he reaches the
[1:06:42] heart right and so he said that he's
[1:06:45] going to he's going to purge that
[1:06:47] conscience really from dead works
[1:06:50] because you see all that they were doing
[1:06:52] really it could not bring life
[1:06:54] Hallelujah to to the to the worshipper
[1:06:56] it could not it could not reach their
[1:06:58] heart and so they were doing the same
[1:07:00] thing over and over and over but God
[1:07:03] said he's going to send a restoration a
[1:07:06] Perfection that can clear the conscience
[1:07:09] from dead Works to serve the Living God
[1:07:13] and so to get to God's Perfection really
[1:07:15] there got to be a purging of the
[1:07:19] soul from from sin before the conscience
[1:07:23] could be clear in other words they have
[1:07:25] to be a
[1:07:26] circumcision or a a a changing of the
[1:07:29] heart which speak to receiving the
[1:07:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost you see church
[1:07:34] if I may you know get bear with me as I
[1:07:37] seconding you know but but you see the
[1:07:40] thing is
[1:07:41] that we we recognize that you know we H
[1:07:46] it's easy to to to to do things you know
[1:07:50] to to to to participate in church or to
[1:07:53] be be a part of that spiritual you know
[1:07:56] but you know but the reality is that God
[1:07:59] does not just want you just to be a part
[1:08:01] of a spiritual he wants Hallelujah the
[1:08:04] conversion of the heart you know he
[1:08:07] wants the heart to be converted and the
[1:08:10] only way that the heart can project The
[1:08:14] Works that are acceptable unto God right
[1:08:17] the Holy Ghost has to go inside and when
[1:08:20] the Holy Ghost go inside he purges on
[1:08:22] the inside of the conscience he Chang
[1:08:25] changes Hallelujah it perform the works
[1:08:27] of the inside and so the conscience from
[1:08:30] the inside will do exactly what God
[1:08:33] wants us to do are you there with me
[1:08:35] church and so amen and so yes it is good
[1:08:39] to participate yes it is good to be in
[1:08:41] church yes but you must receive Christ
[1:08:45] on the
[1:08:46] inside right you must receive Christ on
[1:08:49] the inside so to get to God's Perfection
[1:08:52] there got to be a purging of the Soul
[1:08:55] you see the
[1:08:57] conscience depicts the work of what is
[1:09:01] happening on the
[1:09:02] inside and so if your conscience if your
[1:09:06] soul is not converted your conscience
[1:09:09] will reflect that you will see by the
[1:09:13] works that follow in other words the
[1:09:15] reason why there was a
[1:09:17] continuation of of the sacrifice it was
[1:09:20] because that something was not touched
[1:09:23] on the inside but God said in order to
[1:09:27] bring back his people to perfection in
[1:09:30] order to restore his people in order to
[1:09:32] bring us back to where God said he wants
[1:09:35] us God said I God will restore you in
[1:09:38] other words he going to take it off just
[1:09:41] the works that we perform and God is
[1:09:43] going to go all the way on the inside
[1:09:46] and reach that place there that that
[1:09:49] that the blood of the animal sacrifice
[1:09:51] could not reach in other words it's not
[1:09:54] by works it's not by might it's not by
[1:09:56] power but he said but by it's by my Holy
[1:09:59] Spirit say the lord it's by
[1:10:03] spirit and God said and high God is
[1:10:06] going to restore you in know what it's
[1:10:08] going to go beyond Hallelujah your
[1:10:11] mortal flesh it's going to go beyond
[1:10:14] your your mortal spirit and it's going
[1:10:16] to go Hallelujah into your soul and
[1:10:20] convert it so God is looking for
[1:10:23] Perfection not in your flesh but he's
[1:10:26] looking for perfection in the
[1:10:28] soul so brother bam
[1:10:33] said said in the the
[1:10:37] message uh the position in Christ said
[1:10:41] but this
[1:10:42] man he said not the whole law Paul
[1:10:45] separating law From Grace but he said
[1:10:48] but this man after he had after he had
[1:10:51] offered one sacrifice for sin however he
[1:10:54] sat down at the right hand of God and so
[1:10:59] Jesus he died to do what Hallelujah to
[1:11:04] release his spirit that his Spirit can
[1:11:07] go on the inside and bring that
[1:11:10] conversion right and so the Bible said
[1:11:13] and when he does that when he paid the
[1:11:15] price of redemption the Bible said and
[1:11:17] he went up and he said andp expecting
[1:11:21] until all its enemies are made his foot
[1:11:24] stool
[1:11:26] in other word when Jesus died and he was
[1:11:30] ascended he knows exactly that the work
[1:11:33] that he did was
[1:11:35] perfect your salvation was completed in
[1:11:38] Christ but now he's resting because now
[1:11:42] brother said when he went up he came
[1:11:44] back down in the form of the baptism of
[1:11:46] the Holy Ghost because the work never
[1:11:48] stopped when he died because now he had
[1:11:51] to come not just in a Corporal body but
[1:11:54] in a spiritual body in in in the form of
[1:11:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost right and
[1:11:59] so he's resting but say he's resting on
[1:12:02] the thr but he sent about the Holy
[1:12:05] Ghost and he's going to bring all his
[1:12:07] enemies where where the enemies of
[1:12:11] Christ we are they there are those
[1:12:15] Hallelujah who are hindering you from
[1:12:17] your Perfection but God said Hallelujah
[1:12:20] but because the sacrifice was perfect
[1:12:24] and the sacrifice was accepted by God it
[1:12:27] will bring exactly what God said it will
[1:12:30] bring in other word your Redemption
[1:12:33] cannot fail because God cannot
[1:12:37] fail glory to
[1:12:42] God so we see the Bible
[1:12:50] said you bear with
[1:12:53] me my first time
[1:13:01] I'm going
[1:13:03] to too far
[1:13:09] back
[1:13:11] Speeders I've gone back too
[1:13:22] far I think probably just gone
[1:13:30] and so the Bible said in Hebrews chapter
[1:13:31] 1 verse
[1:13:33] 1 the Bible said who God atent to time
[1:13:37] and in diverse manner has spoken in time
[1:13:40] pass unto the fathers by the prophets
[1:13:43] but as in these last days spoken unto us
[1:13:47] by his son
[1:13:57] whom he had appointed here of All Things
[1:14:00] by whom also he made the world who being
[1:14:03] the brightness of his glory and the
[1:14:06] express image of his person and
[1:14:09] upholding All Things by the word of his
[1:14:11] power the Bible said when he had by
[1:14:15] himself purged our sins sat down at the
[1:14:19] right hand on majesty and high so he's
[1:14:25] he has done the work of their
[1:14:27] Redemption but now it has to be applied
[1:14:31] Church it has to bring forth exactly the
[1:14:35] perfect work to bring that Perfection
[1:14:38] but how can God do that because you see
[1:14:41] you see and and I'm saying all of this
[1:14:44] with the thought of you know this age in
[1:14:46] which we're living in because it's
[1:14:48] easier to adopt spiritual principles
[1:14:51] it's easy to come to church and to sing
[1:14:53] the the songs of Z to apply the
[1:14:56] spiritual side of things but you know
[1:14:59] what but that does not guarantee a
[1:15:02] sufficiency of perfection remember the
[1:15:05] word of the church today is that God is
[1:15:08] requiring us hallelujah Perfection
[1:15:10] listen without Perfection it is
[1:15:12] impossible to step into into you know
[1:15:15] into heaven really god require
[1:15:17] Perfection to get there and so
[1:15:21] listen it doesn't matter how much spirit
[1:15:25] we want to become it doesn't matter we
[1:15:27] sing like angels and all of that however
[1:15:31] God is
[1:15:32] requiring Perfection which is the Holy
[1:15:35] Ghost upon the heart the only person the
[1:15:39] only Perfection that God is is expecting
[1:15:43] the church to have is he himself living
[1:15:46] on the
[1:15:48] inside so that takes it off all of us
[1:15:52] it's not me it's it's not brother John
[1:15:54] it's not brother Mark it's him it's
[1:15:56] Christ the Perfection and so he said
[1:16:00] that when he rose he committed the work
[1:16:03] of Grace he went up but he came back
[1:16:06] down to do what to live on the H side
[1:16:10] because now as said and if he's living
[1:16:13] on the inside the house he must Express
[1:16:16] himself if he's there H but how can he
[1:16:20] do that because you see the adoption the
[1:16:23] thought is that every every one is
[1:16:25] taking the spiritual form it's very hard
[1:16:27] to differentiate brother John everybody
[1:16:30] you know there's so much so much
[1:16:32] anointing out there but the reality is
[1:16:36] that Hallelujah but God Hallelujah in
[1:16:39] this day he promised something different
[1:16:41] for the
[1:16:43] bride and so H he's living on the inside
[1:16:46] church that's what he wants to take the
[1:16:50] preeminence on the
[1:16:53] inside amen
[1:16:58] I think I'll just use the
[1:17:00] quotes as they
[1:17:02] come so listen he's not sitting in
[1:17:06] heaven doing
[1:17:07] nothing but when he went up he came back
[1:17:11] down and God continues
[1:17:15] work because now if God is living there
[1:17:19] he promised that he will Purge your
[1:17:22] conscience from dead work it must come
[1:17:25] alive not just in a spiritual way but in
[1:17:29] a way in obeying truth it must come
[1:17:33] alive in a way where the from your heart
[1:17:36] you recognize Hallelujah and expresses
[1:17:39] God from your heart Hallelujah so much
[1:17:42] so Hall that God will be living on the
[1:17:46] inside and the Bible said to do what to
[1:17:48] get his bride perfect this Lamb by his
[1:17:52] own perfect promise you know he said he
[1:17:55] promised to sanctify the soul you know
[1:17:59] to it was God you know getting his life
[1:18:02] by the Holy Ghost living inside of us
[1:18:06] right and so the soul have to come alive
[1:18:08] in him you just forgive me a little bit
[1:18:11] you know I have so much of this here but
[1:18:14] but but it is Christ and that's what I
[1:18:16] want you to get tonight because now to
[1:18:19] get you get that man on the inside to
[1:18:22] express God in the way that God is
[1:18:25] expecting him to be
[1:18:27] expressed right there got to be a birth
[1:18:30] something got to happen on the inside
[1:18:32] and what I'm trying to do tonight is I'm
[1:18:34] trying to differentiate the church from
[1:18:37] the bride I'm trying to differentiate a
[1:18:40] man that to depict that that that Christ
[1:18:43] is there by by showcasing a spiritual
[1:18:47] you know uh manifestation I'm trying to
[1:18:50] show you that when he's there he brings
[1:18:52] that conscience alive
[1:18:55] is he become alive by God's
[1:18:58] word and
[1:19:00] so just a definition of
[1:19:05] of by the definition of your conscience
[1:19:08] I have it there he said the Saul as
[1:19:12] distinguishing between what is morally
[1:19:14] good and bad pumping to do the former
[1:19:17] and Sh the
[1:19:19] latter commending the one condemning the
[1:19:23] other conscience
[1:19:25] which joins moral and spiritual
[1:19:28] consciousness as part of being created
[1:19:31] in the
[1:19:33] Divine in the Divine image accordingly
[1:19:37] it's all people of this God's given
[1:19:39] capacity to know right from wrong
[1:19:43] because each is a free moral
[1:19:46] agency in other
[1:19:48] word by our own free moral
[1:19:51] agency we can adopt good principles
[1:19:55] you know we we see you know Christians
[1:19:59] they dress right they sing right they do
[1:20:01] all of these things that are right but
[1:20:04] on the basis of moral
[1:20:07] principle that doesn't mean that there's
[1:20:10] a conversion of the
[1:20:12] heart right that doesn't mean that you
[1:20:15] know that the holy ghost that blood that
[1:20:18] perfect sacrifice has reached the
[1:20:21] heart there's a little bit more than
[1:20:23] that
[1:20:25] and that is what is
[1:20:27] required I pray God that tonight we go
[1:20:30] into
[1:20:31] it but it is required because it is
[1:20:34] God's Perfection for his
[1:20:37] church so brother Ram
[1:20:42] said he said it is the beautiful picture
[1:20:46] of a moralist he said as we would think
[1:20:50] today of a man that tries to think is
[1:20:53] going to heaven just because but he quit
[1:20:56] gambling or maybe he quit running with
[1:21:02] running with woman and wasn't it was
[1:21:05] that wasn't his wife I stop is drinking
[1:21:09] he said h a New Year's Day are turning
[1:21:12] over a new leave and join church he said
[1:21:14] see you see he said it it doesn't it
[1:21:18] doesn't really it's it's a he really
[1:21:21] isn't
[1:21:22] converted he's just
[1:21:25] moralist and the devil use using
[1:21:28] moralist just is said just to go out and
[1:21:31] make a foolish representation he said
[1:21:33] when really he said the the real power
[1:21:36] of the living Christ isn't
[1:21:39] there no you can't imagine brother J you
[1:21:42] see all of that and it's
[1:21:46] good you know you sit among you come
[1:21:49] among a congregation and you adopt and
[1:21:51] it's good
[1:21:54] but he's
[1:21:55] saying that still is not
[1:22:00] enough and we have seen it you know many
[1:22:04] persons come in and they they just fall
[1:22:06] in line they they take on the church
[1:22:09] spirit and it's
[1:22:11] good but it requires a
[1:22:16] conversion because the blood got to
[1:22:18] reach the heart to change it to bring it
[1:22:22] into God's Conformity for perfection
[1:22:26] so brother bam
[1:22:27] said it's just a moral moralist and said
[1:22:32] and the devil using mless he said just
[1:22:34] go out it said and make foolish
[1:22:37] representation so when really the real
[1:22:40] power of the living Christ isn't there
[1:22:42] he say see the world is wanting to see
[1:22:46] Christ he said Jesus said I am the vine
[1:22:49] here are the branches and the branch
[1:22:52] bear record of the Vine because it draw
[1:22:55] its energy and life from the vine and
[1:22:59] well it said well the first Vine first
[1:23:02] branch that come from the vine he said
[1:23:05] they wrote a book of Acts behind that
[1:23:09] Branch he said we see the way the Holy
[1:23:11] Spirit acted in that first
[1:23:14] church it said the Church of Pentecost
[1:23:18] and they it said we believe that if they
[1:23:21] if the original vine have put forth
[1:23:23] another Branch they will write another
[1:23:26] book of Acts behind it because it's the
[1:23:29] same life in the in the
[1:23:33] vine
[1:23:35] Hallelujah and so if the holy spirit is
[1:23:38] acting to the church which I believe
[1:23:40] that there there's going to be another
[1:23:41] book of Acts written again in this same
[1:23:43] time and so if there's another book of
[1:23:46] Acts then the holy spirit will have to
[1:23:49] act himself Hallelujah from the inside
[1:23:52] out
[1:23:54] praise
[1:23:56] God
[1:24:01] Amen I quote again but said all right
[1:24:05] brother so you got your ecclesi
[1:24:09] ecclesiastical vest on he said listen
[1:24:12] for by one offering he said not every
[1:24:16] year it said not every Revival but by
[1:24:19] one offering he perfected he said
[1:24:22] perfected
[1:24:24] said till the next Revival he said he
[1:24:26] had perfected forever them that are
[1:24:31] Sanctified Hallelujah that therefore by
[1:24:34] the Holy Ghost also is a witness the
[1:24:37] Holy Ghost is a witness Hallelujah that
[1:24:40] something that had happened on the
[1:24:43] inside
[1:24:45] Hallelujah and he
[1:24:47] said do you get it Christ dying once for
[1:24:51] The Sinner and The Sinner once coming
[1:24:54] through the blood
[1:24:57] cell it said of the Dead lamb then the
[1:25:00] holy spirit that was in the cell of the
[1:25:03] Lamb returned back upon the believer as
[1:25:06] the Holy Ghost is a bearing record to
[1:25:10] our Sanctified belief in Christ God has
[1:25:14] perfected forever and he said
[1:25:17] amen it's a it's not by one who shake
[1:25:21] hand it's not by one emotion
[1:25:24] he said it's not by it's not the one
[1:25:28] time speaking with tongues or 10 times
[1:25:31] or a billion times it's a it's not the
[1:25:33] casting out of spirit it's it's not the
[1:25:37] preaching of the Gospel but the Living
[1:25:41] Sacrifice he said the Lord Jesus he
[1:25:44] brought in Fellowship forever those who
[1:25:47] are sanctify the god in time pass under
[1:25:51] the shadow just it's a Justified
[1:25:53] believer God saved but could not take
[1:25:57] away the guilt he said of the desire he
[1:26:00] said he said not desire he said said but
[1:26:04] the guilt of sin it said the guilt was
[1:26:07] there there was nothing for it to
[1:26:10] overcome
[1:26:11] by and so hallelujah amen and so it's
[1:26:17] not about the shaking of hands said it's
[1:26:20] not about speaking in tongues Hallelujah
[1:26:24] but God has given us a perfect
[1:26:28] sacrifice Hallelujah the sacrifice is
[1:26:31] perfect but said God does not see you
[1:26:34] and
[1:26:36] I he see the
[1:26:39] sacrifice because the sacrifice is
[1:26:42] perfect and you know what and because
[1:26:45] that the sacrifice was
[1:26:48] accepted and so your work can be
[1:26:51] accepted if you accept the sacrifice
[1:26:54] if we live with the sacrifice which is
[1:26:57] Christ the word on the
[1:27:00] inside then God will accept Hallelujah
[1:27:03] you not seeing you but seeing
[1:27:07] him we are living by his
[1:27:10] Perfection they very be church
[1:27:14] amen and so the Bible
[1:27:18] said this age the one that we're living
[1:27:22] in Paul he wrote in Hebrews 11 he said
[1:27:27] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:27:30] you see this is the age of
[1:27:33] perfection so it's not about our work
[1:27:37] it's his
[1:27:38] work it's his
[1:27:40] blood is his cross it's his
[1:27:45] sacrifice is his death his burial his
[1:27:50] resurrection in other word this what I'm
[1:27:51] doing church I'm taking it off from us
[1:27:55] it's him Christ it's what he has done
[1:28:00] and so we can Rejoice not because we are
[1:28:02] good because he is good because what he
[1:28:07] had done and if you're sacrifi said we
[1:28:11] must be identified with the sacrifice we
[1:28:14] must be identified with Christ Our
[1:28:17] sacrifice and if we're identified with
[1:28:20] him Hallelujah you know what when he
[1:28:23] comes on the inside he comes Hallelujah
[1:28:27] to live and to express himself out which
[1:28:30] is where I want to go quickly tonight
[1:28:32] before I close I want to show you
[1:28:35] tonight if he's living
[1:28:37] there he must produce perfect
[1:28:41] work the work that is being performed
[1:28:44] that will be produced by him it won't be
[1:28:47] you anymore is Christ in you the hope of
[1:28:52] Glory Hallelujah because God have
[1:28:55] accepted that blood God have accepted
[1:28:58] but said there it is but said it's not
[1:29:02] you it's a it's him God don't even see
[1:29:07] you
[1:29:09] amen me see if I have
[1:29:11] it right he said God don't even see you
[1:29:16] he sees him he said don't you he said
[1:29:19] you don't have to die he died in your
[1:29:23] pace
[1:29:25] so if we have Perfection by the
[1:29:29] sacrifice living inside then you know
[1:29:31] what we can reach God's
[1:29:34] expectation Hallelujah because we can
[1:29:37] live by his
[1:29:39] Perfection so we say that the blood the
[1:29:43] covenanted blood H in the Old Testament
[1:29:46] it brought
[1:29:48] Perfection you see when we speak of
[1:29:51] perfection it's not just perfection
[1:29:54] living H subjected to the Perfection
[1:29:58] that put you into the path of
[1:30:01] overcoming because we know that the
[1:30:04] blood of the sacrifice cannot
[1:30:07] fail we saw in the Old Testament and you
[1:30:10] what I'm saying to you tonight church we
[1:30:12] saw in the Old Testament when though
[1:30:15] they had the blood of the sacrifice
[1:30:18] under the Old Testament and it wasn't
[1:30:22] something that could have brought
[1:30:23] perfection because it could not reach
[1:30:25] the soul because there was a remembrance
[1:30:27] of that right but even though they held
[1:30:31] on to
[1:30:32] it and by the Covenant of the test
[1:30:37] Testament it brought Redemption for
[1:30:40] them he said brother what are you saying
[1:30:43] to me I'm saying to you that the blood
[1:30:47] brings Perfection it works
[1:30:50] Church Hallelujah and there's power in
[1:30:53] the blood
[1:30:56] you see in the Old Testament they held
[1:30:58] on H to the Covenant the believe the
[1:31:03] sacrifice and all the ritual and all
[1:31:06] that they were doing they believed it
[1:31:09] and so when they died Hallelujah though
[1:31:12] they could not have gone in the presence
[1:31:14] of God but God acknowledged the work of
[1:31:18] Grace and so when they died the Bible
[1:31:21] said when Jesus the perfect sacrifice
[1:31:23] came came and when Jesus died the Bible
[1:31:27] said and the graves of those who slept H
[1:31:32] was ripped open and the dead came out
[1:31:35] why because the blood
[1:31:38] prevails and they came out Victorious
[1:31:42] why because the blood
[1:31:45] prevails hallelujah hallelujah Moses
[1:31:49] Hallelujah Abraham Abraham and Sarah
[1:31:53] came from the
[1:31:54] why because the blood
[1:31:57] prevails and so we know that this the
[1:32:01] the the the the sacrifice of the blood
[1:32:04] Hallelujah was able to take them all the
[1:32:06] way you said where did they went go
[1:32:09] after where they were resurrected but
[1:32:12] said Hallelujah they did not just go
[1:32:14] into the sixth
[1:32:16] Dimension but the blood Hallelujah of
[1:32:19] the Covenant it brought Perfection it
[1:32:22] brought them all the way from the dust
[1:32:24] to the
[1:32:25] Stars it brought them into the presence
[1:32:28] of God hallelujah so they overcame by
[1:32:33] the blood though it was not
[1:32:36] perfected but Church what about you and
[1:32:39] I tonight when we have that perfect
[1:32:43] sacrifice and if the blood can give them
[1:32:46] victory in the Old Testament then the
[1:32:48] blood H with that life that we have
[1:32:51] tonight living on the inside
[1:32:54] remove and Conquer by the
[1:32:57] blood hallelujah praise God because the
[1:33:01] blood
[1:33:03] prevails it brought
[1:33:05] Perfection it brought
[1:33:07] Resurrection it brought truth it brought
[1:33:09] healing it brought
[1:33:12] Deliverance how you there it me church
[1:33:15] and they overcame by the blood of the
[1:33:19] Lamb Hallelujah it took them all the way
[1:33:22] to the seventh dimension
[1:33:25] that's
[1:33:28] beautiful so when that sacrifice comes
[1:33:31] and living on the
[1:33:33] inside he comes to take us from this
[1:33:37] Mortal condition all the way into God's
[1:33:43] Perfection but you know what he's doing
[1:33:46] he's working on
[1:33:48] me he comes at the inside and he's
[1:33:51] changing me from the inside out
[1:33:54] right he's bringing the Perfection
[1:33:57] Hallelujah to take me all the way back
[1:34:00] into his
[1:34:01] presence complete restoration and
[1:34:06] Redemption Hallelujah so we know the
[1:34:09] blood of power Church power to save
[1:34:13] power to heal and power to
[1:34:15] deliver and so
[1:34:17] Paul quickly as we come down Paul you
[1:34:21] know in first Thessalonians
[1:34:24] 4 Paul said for this this this verse
[1:34:29] 15 I have it
[1:34:32] oh okay I
[1:34:35] think okay let me quote
[1:34:41] it 1 Thessalonians 4:1 15 that this we
[1:34:45] know we say unto you by the word of the
[1:34:49] Lord that we which are alive and remain
[1:34:52] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[1:34:54] prevent them which are asleep for the
[1:34:57] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:35:00] with a shout with the voice of the
[1:35:03] Archangel with the Trump of God and the
[1:35:06] dead in Christ shall rise first then we
[1:35:09] which are alive and remain shall caught
[1:35:11] up together with with them in the cloud
[1:35:15] to meet the Lord in the he and so shall
[1:35:18] we ever be with the
[1:35:22] Lord so to our
[1:35:25] perfection in this in time in this last
[1:35:29] days Paul brother
[1:35:33] Bram
[1:35:35] spoke that the
[1:35:37] Lord
[1:35:39] himself no I don't know if you feel
[1:35:42] special but I feel I am feeling
[1:35:45] special that God did not send an angel
[1:35:49] to restore me to my true
[1:35:52] estate but the Lord himself the Bible
[1:35:55] said will descend and have
[1:35:59] descended right to do what to bring me
[1:36:02] back to my eternal
[1:36:04] home right and so when he descended what
[1:36:06] he came down where to do where to live
[1:36:09] he came down to live in you and so
[1:36:12] Hallelujah when he comes he comes to you
[1:36:17] he comes to live in you he comes
[1:36:20] Hallelujah to start to bring you to the
[1:36:22] process of of your Redemption how that
[1:36:26] you can be perfected by him living on on
[1:36:29] the
[1:36:31] inside so it's not us it's him because
[1:36:35] he has descended the perfect sacrifice
[1:36:39] the perfect blood the perfect Christ has
[1:36:43] descended to do what Hallelujah to come
[1:36:46] and dwell on the
[1:36:48] inside to do the work of redemption from
[1:36:51] the inside
[1:36:54] Hallelujah and so brother said so we see
[1:36:59] him by The Works he
[1:37:02] does they don't they couldn't believe
[1:37:04] that he was
[1:37:06] God so he said if you can't believe me
[1:37:10] believe the works that I do for the
[1:37:13] works that I do testify that the father
[1:37:16] sent
[1:37:17] me they couldn't believe a man being God
[1:37:21] that said just look at the Works he said
[1:37:25] if you do not if you do not the work of
[1:37:28] my father he said what did he meant by
[1:37:32] that he said I do if I do not the work
[1:37:35] of my father he said believe me not but
[1:37:39] if I do the work of my father then
[1:37:41] believe me he said the father testify of
[1:37:45] me he said what was the work of the
[1:37:48] father he said but said watch how
[1:37:51] accurate everything he said he said look
[1:37:55] exactly what he said and what he
[1:37:58] prophesied he said it was
[1:38:02] perfect you see
[1:38:07] church God came down to our prophet in
[1:38:11] the same
[1:38:13] time and God gave bream and H
[1:38:18] book it was the sword in hand
[1:38:23] which was the perfect interpretation of
[1:38:26] the
[1:38:28] word there's never been one instance
[1:38:31] brother testified of brother Mark he
[1:38:33] said show me one time one time it has
[1:38:37] ever
[1:38:38] failed it cannot
[1:38:40] fail because it's not brother Bram it's
[1:38:45] Christ God was living inside a
[1:38:50] man and because Christ was living there
[1:38:54] when he spoke thus said the Lord when he
[1:38:57] said when he prophesied it could not
[1:39:00] fail because God gave him the perfect
[1:39:04] work the perfect word to speak what am I
[1:39:08] saying to you tonight
[1:39:09] church I'm saying to you that the bride
[1:39:12] have received thus said the Lord that
[1:39:15] when brother left the scene he did not
[1:39:17] take Christ with him but Christ is here
[1:39:21] tonight to do what Hallelujah he said
[1:39:25] this bride must step into a
[1:39:27] Perfection she The Works must be
[1:39:29] performed again and it must be accurate
[1:39:33] it have to be
[1:39:35] truthful it have to be perfect and the
[1:39:38] only way the bride can bring forth
[1:39:41] perfect work Christ will have to be
[1:39:45] there but let me tell you tonight Church
[1:39:48] Hallelujah better said that the ministry
[1:39:51] of Jesus Christ that the bride has it
[1:39:54] and the bride will bring forth the work
[1:39:56] of Christ by the
[1:39:58] ministration that she will do the work
[1:40:00] of Christ Hallelujah and the work of
[1:40:03] Christ Hallelujah because it is
[1:40:06] perfection it will bring her into
[1:40:11] Perfection we are seeing
[1:40:14] imperfection but God is not seeing the
[1:40:18] imperfection God is not judging you and
[1:40:20] I by our imperfection
[1:40:24] but God is judging it by the
[1:40:27] sacrifice are you very and if Christ is
[1:40:29] living on the inside he will do the
[1:40:32] perfect
[1:40:33] work you know in these days
[1:40:37] really I I see it that God will do a
[1:40:41] work among the bride a perfect
[1:40:45] work and he will bring this bride into
[1:40:47] the position where she's ordained to
[1:40:50] step into because
[1:40:54] hallelujah it's no longer her it's him
[1:40:58] coming on the scene you remember what
[1:41:00] John said John said for high must
[1:41:05] decrease Hallelujah and he must
[1:41:09] increase so it's not us bringing ourself
[1:41:13] on the scene it's us stepping aside and
[1:41:16] bringing Christ on the
[1:41:19] scene you talk about victories and and
[1:41:22] healing and and virtues and power and
[1:41:25] all of these things all that the bride
[1:41:27] need is in her right
[1:41:30] now and The Works must be
[1:41:34] performed Jesus said the works that I do
[1:41:36] I don't do it of myself but the father
[1:41:39] that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[1:41:42] work and so this end time is calling for
[1:41:46] for the perfect
[1:41:48] work the perfect
[1:41:51] interpretation the per perfect
[1:41:54] God living in a in in a vessel of human
[1:41:58] flesh to bring forth himself to manifest
[1:42:02] himself and so when he does that you see
[1:42:04] the conscience must be a record that is
[1:42:08] there and the conscience how is that
[1:42:12] part of your soul that demonstrate the
[1:42:14] works or the evidence that Christ is
[1:42:16] living there it's not adopting a
[1:42:19] principle it's taking truth upon the
[1:42:21] word
[1:42:23] your conscience must bear record the
[1:42:26] truth is there and when your conscience
[1:42:29] Hallelujah is touched by that blood it
[1:42:32] brings forth the resurrection it shows
[1:42:35] that it's not a show it's not a public
[1:42:37] show it's Christ that is living there
[1:42:41] and Christ expressing himself on the
[1:42:45] outside so he he is here tonight to
[1:42:47] resurrect our
[1:42:49] consciences from dead Works to serve
[1:42:54] the Living
[1:42:56] God he's alive and well
[1:42:59] Church the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:43:02] Hallelujah in our heart right now not
[1:43:06] when we reach to heaven right now the
[1:43:09] Bride of Jesus Christ God is living in
[1:43:12] Earth
[1:43:14] now by the Holy
[1:43:16] Ghost you know I in
[1:43:19] closing I had the experience in speaking
[1:43:24] with a lot of I've been to a lot of
[1:43:26] churches and I've seen a lot of things
[1:43:30] you know and I know exactly you know the
[1:43:35] information that is out there
[1:43:37] really but I've never seen another set
[1:43:40] of people that the Bride of Jesus
[1:43:44] Christ her love and her dedication to
[1:43:49] Christ the word it surpass everything
[1:43:52] that you can ever
[1:43:55] imagine I have no problem speaking about
[1:43:58] the Bride of Jesus Christ in the humble
[1:44:00] way of the under the leadership by the
[1:44:03] Holy Spirit you know why because I
[1:44:06] believe that God before the foundation
[1:44:10] of the world Hallelujah has ordained
[1:44:13] this bride to reflect himself by his
[1:44:17] perfect
[1:44:18] work and the words that are on the pages
[1:44:22] that must be reflected through her I
[1:44:26] believe that she has come alive by the
[1:44:29] word of God and so I'm I'm proud H to
[1:44:33] speak about the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:44:36] you know I I remember brother Mark I was
[1:44:38] speaking to a friend of mine you know
[1:44:41] and you know telling inviting him to
[1:44:43] church I said
[1:44:45] listen our sisters are clean they dress
[1:44:48] right we don't have to tell them how to
[1:44:50] dress or anything like that they know
[1:44:52] exactly what to do you know why why they
[1:44:54] know that because Christ is living on
[1:44:58] the inside we don't have to worry you
[1:45:00] know you know sometime back home you
[1:45:02] know you you know you'll have you know
[1:45:04] people who they they will hide and do
[1:45:07] things and so you know like when they
[1:45:09] see Pastor coming they will start
[1:45:10] singing Christian songs and start you
[1:45:13] know shouting H Allelujah and all of
[1:45:14] that you don't have to do that really if
[1:45:17] Christ is there he will Express himself
[1:45:20] you sing Hallelujah pastor don't have to
[1:45:23] worry about the way you dress you why
[1:45:25] because you're living by the
[1:45:27] word and so if he's there tonight Church
[1:45:30] Hallelujah he comes to do a perfect work
[1:45:34] and by the perfect sacrifice he will
[1:45:37] bring you into Perfection God bless you
[1:45:40] tonight amen
[1:45:58] amen he's already making me look bad by
[1:46:00] finishing an under an
[1:46:01] hour so I'm going to take up his six
[1:46:04] minutes that he left for
[1:46:05] me amen that was wonderful I enjoyed
[1:46:08] that you know how I am I always have a
[1:46:11] couple things I like to to pull out
[1:46:12] there and I love how he started because
[1:46:14] when we start talking Perfection we can
[1:46:16] start putting pressure and the first
[1:46:19] thing he said is perfection is God's
[1:46:21] work it's not yours
[1:46:23] it's not yours it's letting go that's
[1:46:25] our work it's his work to work it's his
[1:46:28] work to do and those different things
[1:46:30] but as he was talking about the
[1:46:31] conscience and he didn't touch on it I
[1:46:33] was glad because it it left something
[1:46:34] for me to talk about he was talking
[1:46:36] about how the blood purges your
[1:46:38] conscience do you know at the end of
[1:46:40] this age everybody's going to have a
[1:46:42] clear conscience but it'll be by two
[1:46:45] different works one will be by the blood
[1:46:48] or one will be by the Searing of your
[1:46:50] conscience but either way there's going
[1:46:52] to be two groups of people and each one
[1:46:54] of them will do what they do by a clear
[1:46:57] conscience but one of them will be
[1:46:58] seared and one of them will be purged by
[1:47:00] the blood of God you know how we do it
[1:47:02] you know how we know who's who he said
[1:47:05] it he says the blood will take you to a
[1:47:08] path of
[1:47:09] overcoming cuz what I'm seeing today so
[1:47:11] much I everywhere everywhere is people
[1:47:15] are saying I can do whatever I want to
[1:47:18] and they do things that are contrary to
[1:47:20] the word why because they can't overcome
[1:47:23] it therefore it must be okay for me to
[1:47:25] do it but the blood comes in and it says
[1:47:27] no I can change your desires and then
[1:47:29] we've got a battle and if you'll let me
[1:47:31] do it we'll win the battle on a daily
[1:47:33] basis you won't desire to do the things
[1:47:35] that you used to do but this flesh is
[1:47:37] never converted and there'll be a battle
[1:47:38] but I'll give you overcoming Power by
[1:47:40] the Holy Spirit that's how you know your
[1:47:42] conscience has been purged rather than
[1:47:44] seared is you've come into overcoming
[1:47:47] rather than giving
[1:47:49] excuses amen you'll accept the word and
[1:47:52] you'll let it do a work work inside of
[1:47:54] you amen he said uh the blood prevails
[1:47:58] it works I don't know if you know what
[1:48:00] song I'm going to sing but I'm going to
[1:48:02] tell you now we're going to sing There
[1:48:03] Is Power in the Blood amen when the
[1:48:05] musicians come but it works and I I
[1:48:07] think that's one of the most beautiful
[1:48:09] things and you know I've talked I know
[1:48:11] brother Mark about this a lot this idea
[1:48:14] of we can over complicate what God does
[1:48:18] acts
[1:48:19] 238 has worked since the first day that
[1:48:22] the Holy Spirit was given and it hasn't
[1:48:24] stopped doing hasn't stopped working
[1:48:28] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:48:30] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[1:48:32] shall receive the Holy Ghost it works
[1:48:34] this word works this message Works we're
[1:48:36] not preaching a new message we're
[1:48:38] preaching Paul's message we're preaching
[1:48:40] the apostolic message we're preaching
[1:48:42] the original Pentecostal message and it
[1:48:44] still works today and I see it works
[1:48:46] because the works are here and it's his
[1:48:48] work it's not our work but I was
[1:48:50] listening to brother brandham the other
[1:48:53] morning and he said what holds him back
[1:48:56] he says what holds him back is that we
[1:48:58] can't wait and we try and manufacture
[1:49:01] the work that's his and his alone that's
[1:49:03] right and and too often I'm worried that
[1:49:06] I'm seeing that because we know what's
[1:49:08] supposed to happen we try and make it
[1:49:10] happen but it's got to be his time his
[1:49:13] way his season his strength his Spirit
[1:49:16] his word that does it you know when you
[1:49:19] look in the Book of Revelation the 2 and
[1:49:21] third chapter it says to him that
[1:49:23] overcometh and what did they have to do
[1:49:25] they had to receive what God sent for
[1:49:27] them and that did the work in their life
[1:49:31] that's all we have to do take what God
[1:49:33] has given us let him do the work and
[1:49:36] then he declares us perfect I don't
[1:49:39] declare myself perfect when he says
[1:49:41] you're perfect you're perfect whether or
[1:49:43] not you realize it whether or not you
[1:49:45] think it whether or not you believe it
[1:49:47] you're perfect when he says you are
[1:49:49] perfect and he said I'm going to have a
[1:49:50] bride that is without spot and without
[1:49:53] wrinkle and his word will perform what
[1:49:55] he said he would do amen God bless you I
[1:49:57] certainly enjoyed that tonight brother
