turn over to brother Gerald and he'll introduce brother then so being prayer for him as he brings the word tonight and if the fellowship we had past couple of days as any indication were in for a real meal tonight I'm looking forward to it amen praise the Lord so when he comes if he hears me saying it was there's no lines in the den tonight he before he was wondering about that as there's no lines in the den tonight brother you know so let's sing it all hail King Jesus murder overcome [Applause] [Music] Noorie [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] a man praise the name of the Lord hallelujah god bless you you just want to take just a moment of time before our brother comes again in the liberty to say what he wants to say as the Lord leads them and they can nice - brother you can minister as long as you want and again as the Lord anoint seem by the grace of God so we'll we'll just take take it as being from the Lord as also our brothers visit and our sisters visit with us from from Tennessee and we thank the Lord for our brother Ben Nora and sisters Samantha sister Samantha so the Lord blesses and we have we have experienced a very kindred spirit with our brother and sister a very common spirit the Bible says they had all things common when the Holy Ghost fell on them so as the bride and all the members of the bride they have all things common - because why we had the same anointing and the same spirit by the grace of God our brother he comes as not as a pastor but as an evangelist to minister to us and I remember another evangelist administered for us some years ago and well the new Philander's know him and many others know him and it was our brother Bill Leggett and he said I thank God he said that he made me an evangelist and not a pastor so he said all I've got to do he said has come preach lay it in and leave and he said now he said it's up to the pastor he said after I'm gone he said - I'm here to drive in the nails because the Bible does refer to driving nails into the house of God so he said I'm going to drive in the nails and after I gone he said the pastor can clench them or he said he can pull them out so he said I'm gonna leave that with the pastor so we want our brother then Nora tonight to have that attitude that spiritual alien drivin the nails a man and God by the Holy Ghost is going to clinch it or or if necessary God by the Holy Ghost will pull up the nail but we'll leave that with the Lord because we believe our brother is going to minister the word to us a man and this is not in a denomination oh there we've been called out of that so he can he can minister what God wants us to minister you got ministry what God wants him to minister you got Minister what you need to hear a man not what the church wants you to preach but what God wants you to preach by the grace of God so be in prayer for our brother Bhim as he comes tonight and as I said before he will minister for us on Friday as well and on Sunday morning and Friday night the service will be seven o'clock now 7:30 was seven o'clock and the regular says time on Sunday morning so being prayer for our brother tonight being prayer for the service on Friday and on Sunday amen and giving them the Liberty say whatever God puts on your heart brother preach it lay it in I said because it will be what we have need up by the grace of God so we're going to stand and sing I love him and we're going to turn it over to our brother bin glad to have him here amen again how we feel that kindred spirit I'll fellowship with our brother and sister amen so we thank the Lord for that and our brother and sister understand is going to sing a couple of songs for us tonight as well and the brothers put the effort into getting the piano changed and for our brother and sister so that we'd have this piano here instead of the old one and that they took out just just just this last week I guess so we pray God will bless it for our brother and sister as they sing and play by the grace of God hey man so this list lets believe with all of ours that God is with us and listen there are two voices they're trying to get your attention tonight it's now me and brother Ben it's not me or brother Bob but Satan and Jesus which voice are you listening to and I trust by the grace of God that you're listening to the voice of Jesus amen now remember Saints voice is going to sound good you try to justify this justify that and just drop in a negative word here or there but let's believe with all of our hearts and let's listen to Jesus amen let Jesus speak and if there's anything Jesus is going to respond to it'll be his word amen so I pray the grace of God that that anointing will be upon you the anointing of the Holy Ghost the anointing of the of our Lord Jesus Christ not the Antichrist anointing remember the Antichrist anointeth he does not all we think that's out there no he can be right here to get us to deny one word that is the Antichrist anointing so I pray the grace of God that will be under the Christ anointing a man not the Antichrist anointing that we believe the word of God the word that's ordained to call us out yes but it's ordained to get us ready to earth for the going in of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ let's go out but let's not be left behind let's go in amen be ready for the resurrection and the rapture the climax the change amen so let's believe that God's going to increase our faith tonight amen let's sing it as our brother bin comes and we welcome him all of us welcome our brother tonight god bless him amen and his ministry and fellowship with us amen [Music] me [Applause] [Music] the mission of the word in the beginning was the word the very last job

gonna make it tonight Amen let's turn to Colossians chapter 1 verse 15 man I'd like to speak to you tonight at the Lord help us on the new race new race any times brother brems spoke about a race of people that would be both God and would be both man that's what we're gonna talk about tonight tonight and Friday the Lord helping us I've got about Oh 25 pages worse for this this week and from what I understand you're pastoring one of these guys that gets the lifesaver and he puts the button in so that that made me feel real good at him I'd like to take my time too the word ain't something we should hurry through anyways is it Washington's one verse 15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he y'all getting the idea that God wants to take this church over for himself all these he's makes you wonder it's not about a church not about a prophet or a preacher it's about he don't know how to say a man now here don't you okay just check it right watch now in all things you might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell when having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him are you getting the message yet this is about him hey man that's right is it whether they be things and earth or things in heaven I mean let's pray together of the word well your heads are bad if you just like to be remembered and prayers some special needs you have in your heart just let me know by the lifting of your hand if you would please Amen my hands up to Lord Jesus we so appreciate Father the opportunity to come into thy house and Lord as we bow our heads to your presence we are coming in a humble manner Lord and humbling and belittling ourselves before your presence knowing that before me stands tonight the purchase of your blood I have no ability within myself Lamb of God to help these people or to encourage or do anything Lord of a supernatural manner being a natural man but lord I pray that you would come and anoint that little deposit of yourself down in my life tonight the Lord I could get myself out of the way that you could use me to speak to these your children Lord God I pray that you would anoint their eyes and their ears that they might be receptive all that you would want to speak to us tonight Lord I pray that you would just have your free course and that Lord if there be anything at all that you'd want to lead me in another direction off my notes in a different channel I submit myself to you tonight to do all and everything you desire to do Lord Jesus if you want to keep us here all night long until tomorrow morning let the little glory of God falling around Lord we won't look at the clock we won't be anxious we won't be nervous we'll set ready listening and father for all that you will speak to our hearts and Lord God I believe we'll leave here saying our hearts have burned within us I pray that you would anoint the needs of the requests of your children standing here tonight every hand that was lifted every heart that would have a precious need upon it up your spirit would just be mindful of those things and I commit the service now both speaker and listener to thy hands in Jesus name Amen god bless you may be seated [Applause] when you go to looking at this what Paul speaks of in the first chapter of this book of Colossians it really illuminates the position of the body of Christ and the position of Christ himself and for many of the chapters that you will read in Colossians Ephesians Galatians and the different text that deals with Christ's headship this here in these verses that we've read seems to be the one that has the most elimination to it and for whatever reason that God directed the Apostle Paul to speak these words just in this manner he not only just speaks of Christ's headship but he actually goes all the way to the beginning of creation and he closes it off at the end showing the three-fold purpose of God showing the development if as it were of the body of Christ showing the creation the virgin-born creation of the Lord Jesus he takes all of these things and wraps them together and these few verses that we read here now what's wonderful about the way that Paul says this is he is giving to us an understanding of more than just Jesus coming to the earth now we realized that of course that before Jesus was actually born that God record by the Redman hears the smoke as a paragraph 88 that God was forming himself he said toward flesh and they're the logos or the theophany of God became the image of God who was the image of the invisible now you pick this up in verse 15 now Paul is describing that just in that manner that he is the image of the invisible God but then he goes on this next a little part if you're looking at it they're the firstborn of every creature now right there in just a few little sampling of words we have Genesis chapter 1 all the way back before creation and now we're bringing it all the way up to Matthew chapter 1 all the way into Revelation chapter 1 in just a few words right there on that first verse now by the help of the Lord tonight I want to try to break down some of these parts and go back into that and show for example how that God started as we say now we know the Lord is eternal of course but in our mind as human beings we always look for a place to start and as we go and look at the creation as the creation begins to unfold as the Holy Spirit begin to open up as brother brems said God had a thought in his mind they begin to dwell on that thought and brother BAM said the thoughts of God became his desires and as he thought on certain things he desired after him you know what that's like when you had a certain and purpose or achievement something you really wanted to do it just seemed like the more you thought about it the more of a hunger started developing inside of you and the more your thought and the more you thought the worse it got anybody know what I'm talking about well that's the way it was with the Lord Jesus Almighty God before the foundation of the world begins to thank brother brems said of what things would be now remember before there was creation Sun Moon star Jupiter Mars Saturn Pluto all of these planets we see around us all of the creation on the earth before there was angels before there was anything God himself was the great eternal now we know that this eternal being never did begin never did end and yet he dwelt there for the bem said with his thoughts all he could think of on a daily basis as we would think of it is just these thoughts that he had in his mind and as God began to think and want to fellowship with these thoughts he realized that the only way that he could truly fellowship with these thoughts it would have to go beyond meditation it would have to go beyond just simply thinking upon these things but would have to actually manifest that which was in his mind he said for the man I know all this oh I know you do but we need to hear it again sometimes because I think we fail to see that the very purpose of creation itself was based upon God's desire to fellowship with you his whole desire his whole unction everything about him was he wanted to fellowship and share his eternal life with humankind now we realized that when the Spirit of God begins to move as we see him there in Genesis 1 he moves on the face of the waters there's always a purpose when God begins to move we've seen there in Genesis 1 begin moving and we watch him down through the creations of time down through the dispensations of time he's always moving that's the thing about the Lord Jesus he's never stopped he's never went backwards he is always moving forward never moving backwards his plan and his program is ticking right along just like it should be there's nothing out of cater I know we get to think it in our mind that sometimes things are out of order I Got News for you there is not one single thing tonight that is falling out of order it is moving exactly the way that the Spirit of God desired that it would move before the foundation of the world praise the Lord somebody the devil hasn't pulled anything over on God friends trudeau or Obama or Trump or Hillary or none of them have got any kind of a special understanding that God don't have the Holy Spirit knows the very end from the beginning amen praise the Lord for that now notice again look at verse 15 I just want to take my time for a little bit break some of this down and then either help the Lord will run like we're our hair's on fire and we're not a mile from water now watch again who is the image of the invisible God now here as we see the very breaking of creation we go back into the book of Genesis and we hear brother Branham say that God began to a create as he begin to create you said the first creation was light somebody there was over Grand Falls past Sunday you heard me preaching on this now that God began to form himself into an image that man could see and you say brother bin see absolutely in Houston we get a picture of the pillar of fire we could seem we could actually view him with our eyes we can feel him with our flesh do you realize that the Spirit of God so long for you to be able to come in contact with him that when that first little breaking of the light of God that first little breaking of that little halo that little logos that broke I imagine the heart of Almighty God was just bursting the joy knowing he was only just a few minutes away in eternity if a thousand years is like a day in his mind he thought I'm only a few minutes away from being able to become so tangible that my children will be able to handle me they'll be able to speak to me they'll be able to feel I will be able to feel for them oh my that's the kind of God he wanted to be to you and I he didn't want to be a judge he didn't want to come down and just be a judge ready to throw us in hell for any little mistake or anything we've done wrong but he wanted to become tangible hallelujah that we could feel the presence of God that we could converse that we can fellowship with him Oh [Applause] oh that ought to make a message person shout watch us now look again the image of the invisible God now if we take that little section right there now you have Genesis all the way to Malachi he was God above us he was God above us not God with us as of yet but he was God above us they would see him in the temple he would become so great they couldn't even minister because of the outbreak of his presence he would become an image that they would be able to see descend down into the tabernacle as the sacrifice would go up they'd be able to look and say that's gone back there but there was so much more he had in his heart then just to be viewed from a distance you understand what I'm trying to prove see you tonight I want you to know that this God that we claim we serve he wants to become very personal to you tonight he wants to be more than just a book that you read come on somebody he wants to be more than a song that you sing he wants to be more than just something we talk about his Sunday dinner but he wants to become the very life source of your heart Oh hallelujah to the Lamb of God he wants to become something that absolutely can become the essence of who you genuinely are I hear but the men saying Christ is a mystery he is the center of life of the revelation and he said Christ's life in you makes him the center of your life is wet yeah and then he flips it around and he said in Christ's life and you makes you the center of the life of the revelation you understand heaven and earth came down and embraced and hugged and kissed and guess who got caught in the middle of the smack ha ha ha whoo praise the lord senba honey amen that's right the Holy Spirit absolutely embraced humanity now watch him now as he brings it down to the firstborn of every creature now this is where we want to go along for just a little bit if you turn me in Matthew chapter 1 verse 22 now let's just review just a little bit some of these more simplistic things that we already know but just to get a picture of where I want to try to go tonight Matthew chapter 1 verse 22 now notice as Matthew begins to relate the picture of the virgin birth I love how he opens this up with his reflection upon the Prophet saying now watch now all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child now watch and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is what God with us now could you imagine in your mind what this must have made God feel like when he moved on this prophet many hundreds of years prior to the prophecy coming in where God spoke out and said a virgin shall conceive brother BAM said let's think of Isaiah he might have been actually a little bit embarrassed when God said it because for the human mind it doesn't make sense that a virgin would conceive everybody is pretty well acquainted with how we got here and last I checked virgins don't conceive praise the Lord so there had to be a program laid out that God would bring himself into humanity hallelujah and he would bring himself tangible to humanity and he would do so in a way that would be above the fall in the Garden of Eden now you go back to the beginning you realized that the sexual program is what broke the thing in the beginning whenever Eve come it's adultery with the serpent she turns and gives to her husband but them said she never the serpent that morning her husband that night one act he said to children now because of this this this first transgression this fall in the Garden of Eden then every person that comes to this earth comes as a breaker of God's Word already he said the day you eat thereof is the day you die so the moment you take the breath of life you have already broke the word of God it doesn't matter how many churches you join or how religious you might get or how many quotes you might memorize the moment you break the matrix of your mother's womb you have already broke the word of God to move somebody and by breaking that word of God he that is guilty of one he is guilty of every bit of it you understand we come to this world without even a prayer without even a chance at anything whatsoever but there was a prophecy hanging out there a virgin shall conceive praise God he desired he wanted to know what it would be like to experience what we go through in this life what it would be like to be a human being but he knew that he could not come to sexual route or he would be a breaker of the word himself and I'm gonna go on record and say something right now Joseph was not his father Mary was not his mother God was his father God was his mother if not you and I are still in the sin tonight praise the Lord somebody yeah that's exactly right now you said we better be it oh no she never provided not one falling cell not one germ not one cell not one atom not one molecule of the human body could be transmitted to Jesus or else we are absolutely insane all together he was created the fall he was created above the fall in the Garden of Eden so when he spent there he can say who can accuse me of sin nobody could cast the stone at me that's how you could keep the word like he was because he was virgin more me don't you understand if we would have come to the through the virgin route as it were we would have never been breakers of God's Word we would have come just like he came the whole group were hey hey man but once we received this this engrafting of the fall that took place in the garden of Eve we're already a breaker of God's work and we don't even have a chance but here this virgin to be conceives Jesus I made this remark many times the devil might have been doubting who he was he sees Mary standing there cooking you called him buns we call them biscuits mm-hmm she might have been cooking some sausage and biscuits and all of a sudden the smell hits her nose is she the devil says I've seen that before about three or four months down the road she starts swelling in her stomach the devil says I've seen that before after so long the braxton-hicks start in she starts having the pre birth pains and she'll cry out the devil says I've seen that before goes along right to the birthing part water blood life placenta umbilical cord the devil said I've seen all that before but you see friends the mystery wasn't what was on the outside the mystery was what was on the inside come on somebody the mystery was hiding on the inside when you see me you really don't see me but you see the outside that holds the real mystery oh my notice he said he was the creator of those things that were visible or invisible Oh glory to God now watch here in verse 23 again behold a virgin shall be with child shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which is being interpreted God with us then Joseph being raised from sleep and did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him took unto him his wife and he knew her not until she brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus this was his firstborn God's firstborn now this one son is going to bring many sons under repentance but they're under the Covenant of this old race you see brother mem tells us in condemnation by representation every one of us was represented by Adam and being the head of this human race were under that canopy of sin there's no way that we can escape but you understand there's not enough religion in the world to change the way you were born there's not enough self-help books there's not enough psychology there's not enough preachers there's not enough nothing to change the way that you were born and this worked we all come the same route so that goes to prove friends it's gonna take the grace of God to get us out of here it's gonna take more than being a good reformer a reformed type person oh I don't smoke I don't drink I don't cuss but how was your born resort somebody oh I don't lie but how was your born oh I'm a church member but how was your bar because your birth will tell who is your headship now go back to Colossians chapter 1 let's look at that just a little bit look at again verse 15 now watch now Paul is beginning to show us that with a new birth we get a new headship you understand there's not a Muslim there's not a Buddhist there's not a Sikh a Jain or a Christian or a Catholic that ain't in the same boat every one of us before religion is even introduced into our life every one of us is born into this sexual program there's no way in the world you can escape it last I checked ain't no test-tube baby's been born yet First Lord ain't open no genetic modifications and if they do so they take sinful life and they modified to do something else even if they get smart enough to almost recreate in a sense it's still sinful mankind producing a body don't you understand there's no hope except for the new birth of the Lord Jesus Christ to become indoctrinated that's good it might make you a moral person but moral people don't go to heaven save people do please God oh my look at her get in verse 15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature here we go he's becoming now into the image of the invisible God and the image of this invisible God is now born think about it the image is now birth before they could see him in the temple they could look over there and see him stick it and stickiness his wings out as it were the Holy Spirit and flying out there above that Tabernacle but now he's a baby the image of Jehovah is now dwelling in a blood cell over to God no wonder Satan despised that prophecy in some much until he moved on modern day politics to try to stop the move of that deliverer because he knew if that blood could be created that if God could embody himself and God could dwell amongst humanity that he could save humanity from their conditions don't kid yourself friends the devil had some knowledge about what was going to happen because in pilots all you have two men standing there and they say what shall we do with this Jesus called the Christ remember who was there with him don't you Barabbas but that was not his first name Barabbas was his surname his first name was Jesus somebody please tell me how did the devil know the redemptive name of God it goes to prove he has some understanding and what was getting ready to happen he knew somehow he had the ability to look into the prophecies of the hour to look at the cycle of God's moving and realize God was about ready to visit humanity he was about ready to power and power in the humanities way to be able to birth us into a different channel every prophet in the Old Testament foreshadowed it Ezekiel said I'm gonna put my spirit within your spirit and no doubt the devil stopped and thought in that how's he gonna do that how is he gonna put his spirit within their spirit they've got a sinful heart they came to the world with a sinful nature that old man that they was born with that thing has got to die but if they die how will they ever be reborn he had no understanding of death burial and resurrection no understanding that God who was the Great Creator he was gonna actually Tabernacle on the inside when he looked at this Tabernacle here he didn't realize it represented a man that would one day be full of the Holy Ghost but man tells us an Auburn Kentucky he said just as the ark dropped into its proper sockets he said so as the Holy Spirit dropping into his proper channel that's into the heart of man it will oh thank you Lord Jesus now notice as he becomes born this invisible God now becomes birth look verse 16 for by him we're all things created now watch here heaven earth visible invisible he said what you say if you saw the Son of Man ascending and descending and angels up and down before Abraham was I said how can you been a man 50 years old how can you say before Abraham was you were because Jesus had a revelation of who he was that's how he knew just like I can say that when I hear that the very word of God is eagle food I leave this other thing out here in the world I've been been formed the living image of the Living God I hear from a theophany you say how can you say that because I've got a revelation of where I came from come on somebody I've got a revelation of where I came from I'm not the son of homeroom women or Manning car by the Holy Ghost I've been placed here I've been born an image Genesis 1:26 point 7 laughs make man and Adam steps on the earth brother brems said he had his toes sticking in the ground his arms sticking out like a dead tree and blasphemous names a prophet of God said he had breath because he breathed his lungs breathed but he said you didn't have a living soul until God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life well think about it friends there'd be many people on this earth sitting right here tonight message searches that's got breath in their lungs but they ain't got no holy breath they've got breath to be able to use their breath to quote quote says repeat scriptures but they ain't got no breath inside of their soul to make him a living being with Christ all things were created by him and for him amen he is before all things and by oh things consist all right now watch now that just as soon as he breaks in to the birth part watch what he starts doing he starts reclaiming the headship over his body in verse 18 he is the head of the body friends nobody in the Old Testament talked like this nobody talked about him being headship why there was no headship as far as long as they were under the animal sacrifice how could he truly be their head when a man would walk in and they would kill the lamb he would paint over their sin and that sin was still laying inside of his heart how could he ever truly genuinely be their headship but all what is Paul telling us that there will come an hour when he will be not only just the invisible God and in the image of the invisible God not only will he be the Creator but he will become the head of his body now last I checked my head and my body are the same right I got a Benjamin head I know it's ugly but I don't have a duck body I don't have an elf body I don't have a chicken body I may act like a chicken every now and then but I'm human being last I checked ah praise the Lord come on now don't be afraid to say a man it ain't gonna hurt you none come on now I might have a human head but I don't have an alligator body why my body is the same as my head so if the head was virgin-born if the Hat was the image of the invisible God sighs does the body have to be the same as the head so I here for them said rising in the Sun she is him Oh hallelujah as the husband and wife or one so is she wanted him watch his the head of the body the church what's that who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead now I like this next part verse 20 if you look at this again having made peace through the blood of his cross now I'm gonna say something I won't don't want you misunderstand me but we speak of the cross of Calvary how wonderful it is thank God they'll never get away from the cross you needed all the days of your life I still need to revisit it from time to time I don't know some of you hold the chairman's in here maybe you don't even know what I'm talking about but rest of us human means we understand I need the cross of my life now don't misunderstand what I'm getting ready to say but really it was not the rugged cross that saved me really in a way but it was a deeper cross than just that cross because any man could hang on a tree and die a crucifixion death but now listen close it was a deeper cross than that that caused my salvation it was when God crossed himself with humanity and when God crossed himself with humanity to become one of us it was really that cross that produced my salvation at the other cross I hope you hear what I'm saying to you any man could die any man could shed his blood but there was only one that was that blood cell broke open that the power of the Holy Ghost could break back on humanity and birth them into a new race altogether it was more than just a man dying on a piece of wood but it was the cross from them said God stretched out his tent he [Applause] stretched out his jet and he crossed himself with mankind that's really the cross that saved me because without that cross there would have been no other cross brother Gerald without that cross that would have been no other manifestation all there was two themes dying on the other side of him and when they said it is finished when their life went out of their body it didn't produce salvation for you and I why there was no cross between God and man but the man in the middle also what I fell in love with his cross is what produced life and salvation for you and I hang on everybody but unless you become cross with God you ain't getting out of here either you've got to cross yourself with him he became me that I could cross myself with him come on somebody come on somebody preach with me yes I have to cross myself with him can become like him how are you a sex born man how are you going to become virgin born well you see I'm not like Nicodemus I don't plan on climbing back into mamas womb but there's another womb he's working on the womb of my heart the womb of my mind the womb of my chat my soul my headquarters as it were the very control tower of Who I am that's the part he's working on the inside [Applause] mmmm said if he could ever get you to agree with the word he said he would burn out kill out that old nature you were born with friends I'm afraid to many people think that the Church of God is a reforming station hello they think it's a social club they come here to get psychological help they come here to get a psychological understanding to be revamped in their brain the way they think about things that's not salvation praise Lord I can help other people another situation but that's not receiving the Holy Ghost receiving the Holy Ghost comes by one way death burial and resurrection oh I wish somebody would help me preach I'm talking about death Bharath and that's your women to die and the other way you can die is you got to pick up another cross you got to pick up another cross not a cross between your mom and your dad not a cross between you and the preacher but you've got to cross yourself cry stop stop with that word so that you can become one with him excuse me praising lemon confit had he made peace through the blood of his cross now you realize Jesus walking down the street he could have stumbled fell scraped his knee blood run out that was not the reconciliation of my sins why there was no death attack to it remember atonement could only take place when death was attached to the shedding of blood as a boy he might have been working on something cut his finger the blood run out that was not for the remission of my sins why no death attached to it that's why I had to go to the cross because the only way you can birth a new race there's got to be a death first are you hearing me there's got to be a death first if there was no death there can be no atonement attached to it so he had to die you say I wish he wouldn't have but he had to he had no choice but to die so that the blood could be attached the shake could be attached to the atonement could be attached to the shedding of blood it wasn't good enough for that priest to walk up her and just cut the back of the leg of that lamb let it bleed a little bit and say well you've done your religion you got the token mommy and daddy I believe for you go on mm-hmm praise the Lord Lord y'all got real quiet maybe I hit a nerve there come on now it had to be more than that it had to be more than just a slight shedding of blood but remember said when Abel took his lamb and threw him on the altar he said he took a rock and hack him to pieces why because only resurrection comes at the time of giving of all life is the only way you can bring forth resurrection that's why you cannot halfway give yourself and expect to be all the way resurrected you can't just come to church and be a social member and expect to have full resurrection you've got to lay yourself open before that word and say okay God any part of me be it my soul my spirit my memory my imagination my conscience my reason whatever it is you hack me to pieces you've got to cut me if you've got to slice me and dice me you've got to tell me why do what you got to do so I can attain to resurrection oh my made peace through the blood of his Christ by his cross rather by him to reconcile all things unto himself so the only way I can be virgin-born is I've got to be a part of the virgin bore one that's why the Bible said we're hid in Christ to God if he saw me for the Bob what do i what am I gonna offer to him all I have to do is pull my pedigree and he can tell where I was born and when I was born and where I was born hat I have no other credentials as a human being outside of my birth certificate what else could I offer there would be any higher any greater you understand why that Catholic doctor doctrine of apostolic succession could never be true because you've got a man barred in sand saying that he was born in such a way that he can be infallible absolutely impossible if you believe the doctrine of serpent seed at all there's not even a prophet that can be born there wasn't born understand not a prophet not a preacher not a pastor not nobody every single one of them were born under this sin veil the sin canopy our pedigree chases back to how we were born all but listen to me there's something that the devil could do to Jesus when it was time to lose loose his assault on him he could hack at him spit on him pulled his beard he could even cut his arms and his legs off if God would have permitted him plucked his eyes that done all manners of evil if God would have permitted him but there's one thing the devil couldn't touch his birth hallelujah come on somebody he couldn't touch how he was born he was the virgin born son of God there was no way you could touch that pedigree and if you are in Christ and you have been blind again you supersede everything that that fell in the garden to be utilized by man who said that when you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said God takes you across to the other side of the chasm you go all the way back before Adam if you're a son of God watch this now I hallelujah Romans chapter 8 verse 28 let's look at something for just a moment Romans 8 verse 28 my preaching that faster you listen in that slow which one god bless you new fees hard I look out there and your hair is blown white back oh good that's all right I never hurt nobody yet yet yet Romans 8:28 just the devil that's all I heard now this is familiar to us but I want to I want you to read it with me in the context of what we're talking about we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and that's wonderful he doesn't stop there to them who are the called according to his purpose now notice how Paul begins to describe the purpose of God verse 4 not for whom he did foreknow you say that's the purpose of God full knowledge was a part of his purpose to know what you would do before you done it that was part of his foreknowledge oh oh my goodness he also did oh there's that word again predestinate brother babe said that's a bad word to use with an untrained congregation and that's right because many folks take that word pretty yet well glory to God I can live anywhere I wanna I'm predestinate hallelujah I'm gonna be there always ask predestinated to what right to be conformed to watch our predestination is to be conformed to the image of his son so the entire purpose of God was he wanted us to take on the image of his son do you understand this is why that we're trying to be like Jesus we are trying to be like Jesus because that's the entire path the entire mystery of God was so that you could be like him and he could be like you that's why I say friends God's mystery had nothing to do with just opening seals or sounding trumpets that's wonderful but the real mystery behind all that was you I'll give you an example of what I mean let's let's just assume this is the Lamb's Book of Life right every name it was ever going to be honor this bride members was placed on that book before the foundation road you believe us right this is the Lamb's Book when Adam lost it God put seven seals around that book he hid the potential and the predestinated value of who you were he hid it underneath seven seals and underneath them seals everything you would ever be was hiding in that book so when he brought those seals what was really the purpose of breaking those seals because of who was hiding underneath those seals you understand the coming of the Lord is not an event the coming of the Lord is just another further part of my relationship with jesus christ the rapture the resurrection is just a non-stop part in the personal revelation that i have between him and i as well the people said well i hope to make the rapture Monday well I'm not hoping I've got confidence that if I can follow him today when there ain't no wraps are ahead of us if I can follow him right now when there ain't no squeeze coming on but I can follow him right now when I'm on the mountaintop then I've got a pretty much cuz I've got a I'm pretty well convinced that when things get bad if I can following I can follow them do the bad stuff too and if I can follow them through the bad stuff it might be 500 years before the rapture resurrection please God don't say that's true but I might could be a hundred years for all we know before rapture resurrection but I'm not looking for an event as though I would miss a party somewhere it's an everyday walking with Him and when it comes time to go to the rapture that's just another step in my walk with whoo glory to God now listen Jimmy Enoch walked with God and he was not there's been cosmonauts there's been astronauts he was the first was not right he walked with God he had this testimony they please God do you understand Enoch wasn't even looking for a rapture when God took him he woke up every morning just like he always did read his Bible he prayed he focused on the Lord God and decided whatever he wants today that's what I want his dying of his will and his opening up to the will of God and God said in hockey I like you so much boy I'm not gonna wait all these hundreds of hundreds of years to get you out of paradise what you just come on talk to me for a little while oh hey man he wrapped him or he took him or raptured him up why because he had a testimony that he was pleasing to the Lord now look at what Paul said he said that he might be the firstborn that he might have the headship had the preeminence glory to God have a body that would be pleasing unto him for whom he did foreknow he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover he did predestinate whom he did then he also called and whom he called y'all still got jesus' telephone number you got to have the right number to call because if you don't got the right number you'll miss the phone call there's a lot of somebody God give us the divine instructions of his divine phone call it starts with Malachi 4:5 Luke 1730 revelation 10 7 st. John 3 and 3 you got to know the right buttons to push or you get the wrong number some people are going to dial up one day and then wind up with the Pope and the mark of the beast but there's gonna be a bride on this earth that's gonna know is divine phone number oh yeah - I love it I said in first Thessalonians 4 let it say we'll come down with a shot and a bus the Greek word for voice is spelled pH o n e I want to let you know a little secret unless you're hooked up to this divine phone call when it comes time for rapture Resurrection you'll miss the call Shores the world oh but the elected that are hooked up on that divine phone call come on somebody that are listening that away the devil might be said they're saying y'all having that sermon see ya they will hold on a minute I've got to answer this phone call yes when the rapture comes resurrection come the bride will be hooked up into a divine channel he'll be moving so quickly people can't even seem I understand said over objects move at 1 billion miles per second he said they could pass through one another he said that's the way it is of the coming of the Lord Jesus will be moving at 1 billion miles per second hey y'all they never made a camera fast enough to catch that there's not a crystal there's not an internet and Ethernet there's not another kind of net that can catch him but the bride's got her niche hey man she's hooked up in the revelation of the eye and she's watching she knows what of the thought that it might be the firstborn among many brethren then he predestinated he called and whom he called oh I'm so glad I answered the phone amen then he also justified and whom he justified he has also glorified do you know what justified really means as though you never did it in the first place how can you be justified if you've still got a pedigree that chases back to your birth date you don't have a pet if you're a child of God full of the Holy Ghost your pedigree don't just chase back to your birth date you've got another pedigree they tell me that a racehorse that you can take it to this pedigree line and chase it all the way back to its great-great great-great great-great-grandfather it can prove that it's bloodline is pure that's why it's a thoroughbred racing horse move em send adoption that's what I love about our true Christian they're like a thoroughbred racehorse they can prove it's fabulous to the foundation of the world oh my let's turn on Ephesians chapter 1 oh praise the Lamb of God just get warmed up to start preaching here any minute hallelujah amen thank you Lord Jesus o children of God aren't you glad you answered the phone I'm so so glad that I answered the phone Alyce let's look for just a moment now I don't want to take your mind to something here for just a minute how that Paul makes this from Martin at it is you just hold your place up let me read you Romans 5:17 18 for by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ their force by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation that's you and I and we can't escape it we're absolutely born into condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men on the justification of life now the word did you hear justic eight justification means the act of God declaring men free from guilt and acceptable to him you might have had enough guilt to float a boat if guilt was like water it might have floated it down the river huh absolutely you know what I'm talking about surely you remember when are you as a center hmm Dipendra when you was out in the world and one more like that you weren't looking for God you had no interest in God but thank God he was looking for you I would just walking along minding my own business and I kept hearing the phone ring someone huh where's that phone coming from thank God I found out where it was that notice declares you free from guilt how Christ Himself brings to you a releasing of that first pedigree god oh don't miss that he releases you from that first birth or that first nature Oh God and he actually marries you to this nature of Jesus Christ Prince Annette what Peter told us he said that we would be partakers of the divine nature I'm not partaking of your nature you're not protecting a mine we're not for taking a brother branham Christians aren't branham's or Luthor's or Wesley's they're children of God their sons and daughters of God come on now that pedigree has nothing to do with flesh what do tell us in st. John one not born by the will of flesh not born by blood but born by the power of the Holy Ghost now I want you to watch this for just a moment going into Ephesians chapter 1 now you'll notice that as Paul begins to describe what happens when a Christian really hears the voice of God now there's a process that a man and a woman has to go through in order to really receive God's redemption in their heart now I'm not preaching just now just receiving the Holy Ghost but there's a hidden or invisible part that lays down inside of much of this that we need to look in order to understand it fully there is a process but when first a person believes God absolutely has faith in the Word of God they hear the word of God they leave all the worldly and so forth like that there's something that happens from the time they hear to the time they're sealed now what we're getting ready to read Paul makes it sound like that is just a instantaneous thing sometimes it absolutely is but if you'll notice I just love how it says this let's drop down fusions chapter 1 let's just pick it up here at verse 13 so much of that we could read but just to conserve time now now watch in whom ye also trusted now watch these little steps after you heard the word of truth stop right there I want you to stop now what happens after a person hears truth now think for a moment Jesus tell us about it he just as Luke 8 mark 4 Matthew 13 talks about the parable of the seed in the sower works his faith expressed by them said that the ground was prepared or predestinated before the seed could fall into it so if they were to bring forth 50 fold or a hundredfold ever what it was their ground was predestined you say but I want to be a five-time it person God Mabel to made you one that doesn't mean you're less than the body of Christ because I've seen somebody with one time it'd be a bigger blessing than a guy with five Berni that reminds you about the woman they cleaned out the stable when Dwight Moody got saved for his little heart you know the story I'm talking about she feels led by the holy ghost to have a meeting so she goes and rinses stable and hires a preacher and she cleans out the stable nobody shows up for the revival except for one little long-haired boy by the name of Dwight Moody mmmm said he led a million people to Jesus Christ for one time and had a whole lot more benefit than some of the guys sit in the big Cathedral with five legs Lord somebody why the ground was predestinated to bring forth the way God wanted him to break ball you can't help but be what you are [Music] can I say something that's the problem a lot of people in this message friends I don't mean to sound like a critic I'm just making a general honest observation that's the problem a lot of folks in this message they're not satisfied with God made them you can do a whole lot better job just being what God made you then try to make yourself something that you're not there's an old southern expression for the bad news you can't be nothing you hate you know how y'all drop your Aegis we pick them up we pick up what the new fad Newfoundlands if they drop off that's right then Southern's and say you can't be not natural hind that's right that's right if God makes you be a certain thing you cannot break that mold jesus said a man cannot to a stature by taking thought yes what he is by the grace of God that's why certain housewives in the message who feel like they should be preachers or private clothes closeted deacons hey friends we got a lot more people in the clouds around this message and homosexual we've got closeted deacons and closeted pastors and closeted trustees and closeted song leaders and they do all their work behind the scenes you know insanity well that man he may he may have the title Deacon but sometimes he gets home and that little woman explains to him how to run the church uh-huh you know what you're doing you're not doing what God called you to do God called you to put one lip on the other and pray and hold that man up in prayer not get into men's business and run the church whoo thank you Jesus don't know where that come from but it came anyhow come on now you understand what I'm saying to you like that preacher one time was preaching away and God said this and God said that and said in God and God said honey I just cannot read your writing can you make this more plain as we go and whom also after that you heard the word of truth after you hear it the word falls on that ground if you're not true able to take the seed of God it doesn't matter how much that man preaches to your what he preaches to you he could be the most eloquent or he could be the worst in the bunch and that's a matter how many quotes he quotes are how many scriptures he reads or the lack thereof it's the ground whether it's gonna be able to receive that word or not some of the greatest preachers in the world because I wish brother Bama brother Brad was here he couldn't change it he couldn't affect you any more than what you are right now because the word of what you are if it can't be effected through me or brother Gerald or some other preacher ever how God would called me in every who had called where he would call him from if you can't effect that word in your life coming from a nobody like me brother BAM wouldn't help you not because it's the same word might be the different vessel but it's the same word come on church it's the same word of God so if you can't be affected here you would be affected over there people so a lot find him and brother Branham was here well what are you doing about it now because what you are now is what you have been down because how you are prepared that is who you are like it or not we are who we are hey I've done exam come to terms a long time ago I'm ugly and probably gonna remain ugly be quiet Sam I'm not gonna let you breathe hurt I have church splits over that all the time but watch oh I just love the way he says this after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also her that she believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise okay no way you go to matthew samara excuse me March 16 he said he that believes his baptized to save he that believes not his damned that doesn't mean simple believing like Paul's say in here but brother Bremen tells us in March 16 that the believer is actually the nature part of that person so as he said Jesus said Matthew 16 they believe in their baptized he said that's because by nature that person is a believer he said are you a human he said yes said the human things follow you said yes he says so do these things follow a believer because that's what they are it's a part of their makeup as a Christian they speak with new tongues they raise the dead they cast out devils if they take up deadly things it doesn't harm if they drink deadly things it doesn't hurt them that's the nature of that person but now Paul is saying after you heard he indicates to us that somehow there's a search that goes on to try out whether or not you are truly a believer all right now let's go into the invisible part of God the sermon goes forth the man here's what's being preached he says hey man I believe that's the truth God does a search at the very moment that he believes and he goes back and he searches through the pages of the Lamb's Book of Life and if his name is not tied to that title deed then there is no reciprocated evidence on the other side you understand his evidence his title deed says he'll have the Holy Ghost because that Holy Ghost is promised to a believer so after he hears the word of truth this is why that people don't get the Holy Ghost when they believe because when they believe there's no search that goes on are you hearing me when they believe there's no search that happens but sure they believe God goes back and he does a title search is this alright gerald lush says he believes right here he is on the Lamb's Book of Life the moment that the title search and his name is tied back to that title deed then the Holy Ghost reciprocates back to him the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then he is sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise do you understand this is the reason why some people can not get the Holy Ghost there's no name on the title deed they can cry they can scream they can holler they can beat at the altar they can have 15 people lay their hands on them if their name is not on that title deed of redemption before the foundation of the world no matter what they may act like there will be nothing that can be reciprocated because the Holy Ghost is an inheritance to the elect I'll never saw that before the Holy Ghost is an inheritance to the elect of God oh my it is my right to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is my inherited right sure see the indwelling us so he ties it back to the steed an angel of God with mem said the judging angel the marking angel says did he hear it yes he heard it did he believe it yes he believed it all right title search now is his name on the book no no it's not revenge you just said he believed you can believe every day of your life and still die and go to hell that pinched you a little bit didn't you believing ain't gonna get you there we are not Baptist that's your cue to say a man I'm just giving you a spot we are not Baptist we don't believe the moment you believe you got it what did Paul say there in Acts chapter 19 he said telling about the Holy Ghost under a policy I've got all this teaching and they said you see the Holy Ghost said she believes that we'd haven't heard there was a Holy Ghost is it how was you baptized if probably believing was it then why don't you look at them believing Christians and say well you got it already anybody Jesus is the Son of God don't you want to sure we believe that pallas taught us that much he taught us that the Messiah was come to remember the brother M said that when he met that group in acts 19 that Apollo's was formerly their pastor Paul takes them over they become the Ephesian Church later how to lose somebody but believing was not the criteria well glory to God we will have a staring contest or what that's up to you you can either say a man to what's right or you can hold on to that little tradition you got in your brain believing does not get you there oh I believe God sent a prophet the devil believes God sent up wrong do you realize that the devil believes that Jesus is the Son of God he runs the Bible said he trembles at such a belief but believing ain't gonna get you in the rapture oh I agree you got to believe unto you can't have doubt I agree with you there but believing by itself doesn't make a title search there's got to be a title search it goes on and says is his name on the book and he says that in Calamba he believes that's time back in there yes there he is lady you see in church H he's a part of that 3rd 4th generation comes along believing that message yeah right there he is in the book hallelujah send him the Holy Ghost what happens if their foolish virgin no title deed that's why the door comes up and shot they want it with everything they've got inside of them but they can't get it they have no name on the book with no inheritance y'all are looking at me like you don't even know what I'm talking about I know I'm pinching you on that because you said ho but we got to believe we got to believe but what happens after you believe I'm challenged you do not to think on this and not you ain't gonna back me up I ain't gonna get nervous you quit praise the Lord absolutely all you say but if they believe the message they can believe the message day and night it doesn't bring a change unless the Holy Ghost comes down and says yes they believe it hmm three a man's two eye blinks couple head nods do it okay all right hang on everybody future home a 264 remember Saturday when you accept the Holy Ghost is when the Holy Ghost accepts you how do you know it accepted me he's done a title search he's all dude was my faith matching the Word of God did my faith tie back into this word could he go back in there and say yes his name is on that title cuz if he couldn't there's no way you can receive the baptism the Holy Ghost don't you understand that's why brother Branham said when this book is lifted in the form of the bride and she's raptured resurrected out of here that they're going having altar calls but nobody can get saved why there's no more book to be saved with you there's no more members that's on that book to be safe every name has been splashed underneath that coal rock so I feel like preaching now oh every name has been splashed underneath the crops of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and there's no he's got to claim on in the form of redemption I set it up here in grandpa's let me say down here there's a difference in being saved and being redeemed you step out here on this park I'm on tonight and you see a cellphone say it's brother Gerald cellphone I grabbed him brother Gerald you dropped your phone brother here here's your phone I've saved it I kept it we're getting stepped on but let's say we walk out there on the parking lot I pick it up and say hey Ben you dummy you lost your cell phone laying on the parking lot I didn't save it I redeemed it why it belonged to me originally being saved is one thing but to be redeemed you had to be up there before the foundation of the world you had to be on that book by the atom before there was a speck of Stardust automatic your name had to be represented with that title deed redemption for the remm said the first name it went on it was his own the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus Christ placed his name there he said he dipped in this blood he laid on them on the pages of the Lamb he said he put every name and I put on my oh no wonder I got to be baptized in his name live in his name walk in his name preached in his name cast out devils in his name overcome the enemy in the last days name with his name before there was a world but just my you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise verse 14 which is the earnest of our inheritance y'all thought there's this good wait until we get just a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more Oh mine too the full downpayment comes this is just a little tiny bit of what it is and brother if it feels this good now I can't wait to see I can't wait to see what this full thing is going to be when God gives it to us it is the earnest of our inheritance on to the redemption of the purchased possession let me say again who is that purchased possession you now why can't I get people to see that our home the purchase under the prize of his lorry that he might have the preeminence is amongst the Box he's gone oh listen to this and serves we'd see Jesus God is the divine healer and all that God can do for you he did it in Jesus Christ your work of redemption for soul and body is already completed what good would it do to put me in my soul in eternal life into my soul and give me a body that dies what good would it do me to have eternal life in my heart and not have a body that follows so part of my redemptive promise in my inheritance is he works on soul first then body follows lady don't you worry about him gray hairs on him stooped shoulders it may turn gray or turn loose one of the other but don't you worry about it he said every hair of your head is numbered why he's got it recorded in the title deed of redemption come on somebody he's got it recorded in that deed what you look like but then said God took a picture of you before the foundation of the world when you were at your best and he stuck it in his file so that he could know that he could be able to reflect back what you were supposed to look like at your change everybody hang on now this is a 15 gallon bucket but they're quoting the 10 gallon bucket y'all don't know gallons you know leaders only but brother Mannis says even to your rapture is already completed I am so glad he did not say V rapture because that is an event that I may or may not participate in but it didn't say the rapture he said your reps that's what I'm talking about this is a personal extension of my already walk with God the same God that brought me resurrection in my heart amen is the same God all right that's gonna bring rapture in my body later on it's not just an event all the rapture is an event the rapture is an event I hear people say that stuff so much I feel like I'm signing up for a rally somewhere another it's not an event it's an extension of my walk with him when there's nothing else he can get me down here in time he'll say there's only one thing else I can give to you you've possessed everything listen brother brems said that before the people of God go out of this world they're gonna go out overcoming everything that there is to overcome listen to me death itself is gonna be overcome before we leave here hello somebody we are gonna put our foot right on the neck of death lower the gun we are going to put our right on the neck of death before we get out of here I'm not waiting to die before overcoming death I'm already overcoming it you said what you're getting stupid shoulders your hair is starting to fall out here that may be but listen what Jesus said st. John 5:24 he that hears my word and believes on him that sent me once the title search is done he shall not come into the judgment but he has passed already past tense he's passed from death unto life I am NOT waiting for I'm not waiting for that day when we all of a sudden becomes sons of God I'm not waiting for a squeeze for the power of God to be manifested the very thing we've been waiting on it's right here before our eyes and it's been laying in the revelation of the word I'm not waiting on 3rd pullback it's already here you might disagree with this next thing but I don't believe the bride is gonna go out of here speaking squirrel's I don't believe she's gonna go out of here speak in the storms I believe she's gonna go out of here an absolute possessor of this old enemy that she's been packing around this first generation birth this first pedigree I'm not worried about controlling storms I'm worried about controlling the temper and impatience and this tongue and these thoughts if I can get myself under divine control hey hey the prophet of God said a man far I surrendered to God he is a man that is omnipotent [Applause] I've said it many times a real key to becoming a Christian is let go and let God you want to be a real Christian that's the only way you can be a real Christian let go and let God but we're trying to hold on too much you don't think so look around some of these churches around the message they're holding on to everything even preachers around this message building million-dollar buildings and preaching the rapture is just above us there y'all didn't shout too loud about 10 but that matters truth anyways people talking about wanting to get out of here their life doesn't prove they want to get out of here because they're holding on to everything they can hold on but a real child of God my brother my sister and somebody that wants to let go and let the Holy Ghost have total control you want third pull power learn how to control that nature you were born somebody said to me one time we're the band that's your problem they said you just absolutely believed that the bride is gonna be an invincible army I said I don't want to believe it I believe I'm part of it another fella said to me you mean to tell me you think the bride is undefeatable I said that's what the Prophet said he said smoke emergency she can't be defeated I said do you believe what Paul said he said I guess I said do your don't you said yeah I believe it I said then what did Paul say he said not famine not peril not sword not destruction not the devil not sickness not denomination not even your sap can separate you amen from the Lamb of God that is in Christ Jesus nothing can separate you from his life [Music] Amen if I'm here then I'm not the devil's that's simple but that's profound if I'm hears I'm not the devil's God listen to this improving his word God he God came down after going through this time not human life now every son said you eating her born of that natural sexual birth the way you come when it comes to a place where you go through water baptism Holy Ghost baptism he said then the Holy Ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims this creation the same as it did him oh I don't want you missed this he said the Holy Ghost and God is the same spirit so it comes down and claims this body for the resurrection do you realize that when you receive the Holy Ghost God stakes a claim in you it doesn't matter they feed you the lines that stake is on the earth it doesn't matter if they drop you in the sea if there was any believers in that wreck over there in Titanic and they're laying underneath the ocean there's a stake down at the bottom of the ocean with their name on it glory to God cut off sematic there's no way you can set or no way you can tell him app so when it comes time to claim all that was resumed that was laid in God's mark when it comes time he just looks for those claims the devil says but I got him they came through that sexual Channel you sisters excuse me for this I gotta say the way brother I'm saying these things but if she come to that that first birth that natural Channel oh my why you were born off that tree of knowledge of good and evil and the devil said I've got a claim on them but then God turns around and says that your claim came after my claim [Applause] because they're claimed goes all the way back before the foundation before you is even created I don't know I don't think you got that in somebody before the devil was even created there was already a claim come on somebody oh thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord that was a claim oh he had claim on your life before the devil was even created before it could even cause trouble there was already a claim so Satan comes on says but I got there aided the tree of knowledge of good and evil he says they might have done it but that was just the flesh part there's a part that goes beyond that flesh if we could get the Church of the Living God to understand those two laws you would see some overcomers in the body of Christ the problem of people in this message friends I'll say this is an evangelist because I've been around a few places every now and then I can tell you this the problem a lot of people miss message friends is they've got an infallibility belief about themselves and nobody they can make mistakes and I believe they can do anything wrong they believe they're infallible every word they say does this say the lotus1 they have a you know sometimes spiritual whatever it's just that's god it's God not every spiritual thing that happens is God sometimes the devil could give you spiritual things hello Church brother I said everything that comes spiritually he said you check it out with the word of God and make sure it fits with the Word of God hey man if it doesn't dovetail it didn't come from God it came from the devil all the way we got to sin that ability believe the best of the message see with the elite with the elite we're the ones that walks on water and speaks squirrels and existence glory to God and we can't even keep hate out of our heart half the time hey man we've got this idea that everything we do is God no wonder the Lord Jesus has to reach over and pull the rug out from underneath us sometimes just to prove to us we ain't the one in charge and brother I want to tell you he's gonna keep on pulling the rug out from underneath us until we learn who's really the boss around this situation and I'm here to tell you it ain't me they brother branham it ain't Joseph Brennaman ain't no other Brennaman over nor on and Smith and whatever it's Almighty God I think somebody said the other day somebody asked them where their headquarters was said in heaven that's where my headquarters is at hand I don't answer to Arizona I don't answer to to Indiana I don't answer to some other place I answer to him that's why it's brother Gerald said I can come in here and preach the gospel free we're not a denomination we're led by the Spirit of God they that are led by the Spirit of God they are that sons have got man I don't have to check with the President or a bishop overseer is it okay for me to preach holiness is it okay for me to preach about women not cutting their hair is okay for me to preach okay be rich all I have to do is get on my knees for the jobs of Lord Jesus is this pleasing to you tonight and said yes my son it is and go preach it hallelujah I'm not here to please nobody but him hey man my mind pleases Almighty God well we've got this elitist mentality we walk higher than everybody else that's why we look down our nose at sinners and look down our nose at other people because we believe we're higher than them last I checked you got two arms two legs two eyes hopefully a brain like everybody else hallelujah come on aha there's somebody say preach it like that right right you're the same as everybody else times your birth differ from anybody else's birth my granny had an expression you put your pants legs on one leg at a time like everybody else but I believe the Prophet I believe the message I believe I believe I believe and by that we try to say that somehow God will honor our own personal faith just because we say we believe really it's not when we wouldn't say we believe it but it's when God can look down on the inside of me and say that Ben he genuinely believes every word that I said he has confidence in what I said to be the truth like a man said one time God said so I believe in that settles I said brother not to be different but whether you believe it or not that settles it anyways well he can look at me and say he believes he absolutely believes with all of his heart that this word is right and God comes down with fiery baptism and he seals me with a holy spirit of promise and what does that mean it means he puts his seal approval or his a man over my life that is my child that is my bride that is my wife I a man her life some people in church don't believe in a man in the very way they got to hold it goes as God said a man that's my bride that's my child Oh glory oh my that's what makes us a man it's him a man in through that's right oh my listen to this man tells us just different places oh so many places I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to find a place to jump off pick yourself Friday but you just looked so many different spots that I could just pull in here brother I'm talking about we was in the chicken yard you don't remember the story he said we were egos all along you remember you that chicken yard here in Mama's voice didn't turn you from a chicken poof and you become an eagle he was already an eagle praise the Lord he was already an eagle that's the reason when you heard the voice for the Bob you said oh that's what I've been looking for that sounds like to me now if you've been a chicken chicken there would have been no poof this is not Benny Hinn this has been eagle the hens are for the hens but we're talk about Eagle food brother yes sir hey the Holy Ghost absolutely calls you to be watch you were before the foundation of the world there is no escaping the fact that if you were a member of the body of Christ you always was a member of the body of Christ how could you change that because if you come from God you couldn't have been some sinner or something come out of God and then turned over into a saint there you know sin and God come on church if it was God and he was the father then every son's gotta be like town dog produces a dog and a cat produces a cat somebody tell me what God produced but mom used this type he called it in the science that's good the one place he said there a chip off the old block notice this oh thank you Lord Jesus can I go just a bit further yeah god bless you thank you so much this is this in 2nd in 6 verse 2 he say if I have heard thee in a time accepted and the day of salvation have us Accord thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day the salvation Galatians 4 3 even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but what happened God sent forth his son made in the likeness of a woman he came in this likeness of sinful flesh he took on the cross the real cross so that he could take on an old rugged rugged cross that by the death of one the testimony has no effect of the testator's dead once he died he goes into the ground brother brems said he descends down to the regions of the loss he takes the keys from hell and death from the devil he goes over and empties out paradise huh after he goes back up in his sins he leads captivity captive remember said he has a private resurrection presents himself as the Lamb of God the sacrifice he comes back down Mary tried to touch him said don't touch me I haven't yet ascended he said but I go to my father and your father I go to my god and your God do you notice how he laced them together why the work of redemption had already been completed it was no longer just God above us but it was my god and your God my father in yah why now we're becoming one and members in particular there's only one body Luther they might have been a different group from us but there's still a part of us once they might have been a different part but there is still a part of us and do I even dare mention 1906 in the restoration of the gifts some people this message pass out when you talk about gifts in the first place but that's just as much a part of me as any other part of Revelation in the Word of God somebody said do you believe in speaking in tongues I said yes I believe God has a tongue so what do you believe in the gift of faith I said that's how I believe God has faith you believe in the gift of wisdom yes I believe God has wisdom amen if we yield ourself to the things of God we don't just become a part of it just one and so in a great while but we become absolute conduit say man that it can channel his life and his power through us my under the rudiments of this world look again Luke 17 and the day that Noah entered in the ark verse 26 through 30 in the days of son of man it be the same way they ate they drank they married wives gave in marriage huh in the days of lot they ate they drank they bought they sold they builded they planted it what in the world has this got to do with the sinful generation don't you see they had their minds on everything else except for becoming one with Jesus Christ there were more concern with planting and building and this and that the other and to stop and to hear the message of Noah crying out of the window that Ark out there standing on the door saying it's going to rain it's going to rain God revealed to me it's going to rain is gonna flood the entire world and those that aren't in this art they're gonna embarrass are gonna be destroyed get in for the saving of your household they said all Noah we've considered today but I gotta go finish building my house down the road down there I've got to go marry somebody yeah I gotta go bury somebody you know what Jesus said he said a man that would do that and turn his face from the cross he said he's not even widely to follow me but man picks it up in July for the gospel and he said a life that is widely the gospel is a life without excuses come on somebody if we're going to be one with God we've got to drop the excuses I can't I shouldn't I won't I'm not able to listen the Holy Ghost series he said that's what the Holy Ghost come to do has to take all them cans away from you but he become one so that we could become one he became intertwined with humanity that we could become intertwined with the oh thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah just a little bit further relevant said look these churches these grafted vines you can grab citrus fruit you can take an orange tree put lemon I'm telling you we could go on all night like this there's just so many of these places lemon and it'll grow man grafted in organizations grafted into it he says what man done he said slimming all the time it'll grow because it's stuck out in the church's name he said but let me tell you if that tree ever puts forth another branch if it was an orange tree in the beginning when that branch comes forth it would be an orange in the end he said into the power of God ever puts forth another Church somebody say hey man he said it'll be another Pentecost write another book of Acts will be wrote behind it because it's the Church of God why this was the purpose of God that he might get preeminence God into Christ Christ into the church getting preeminence over the whole body I feel like speaking in tongues right now talk about speaking in tongues I feel like changing my language altogether here for a little while oh oh take it out that he might have one gather at what Paul said one of the invisible visible Thrones principalities they might gathered wild things in Christ Jesus one that's why when he takes this Lamb's Book of Life and he breaks him seals off there it wasn't just those on the earth rejoicing John but it was those in that other dimension looking on there was rejoicing why it's time for oneness invisible and miserable is coming together that's why I don't mind telling you mom and dad may have gone on great grandma and grandpa might have went on but if they died in the faith they're only a breath in that other dimension it's just a little bit faster than our eyes brother mom said there's three heavens he said the first ones out here that we fly in a plane you know I flew into heaven on the way over here your first one the second heaven the solar system he said that third is that faster dimension oh my he said Jesus will pass through the clouds when he returns back how will he do it he'll be passing so fast moving so quickly through the third heaven second heaven first heaven that the world won't even see him passing oh but there'll be an elected bride standing on the earth ready with their garments you hear the wagon wheels in the distance Oh am i the Pentecostal Baptist methis will be laughing they'll be saying why don't you sit down and wait she says I can't I might wrinkle my dress I got to keep on spotted unwrinkle from the things of the world she'll hear the rancher son coming in the distance ah and she'll say that I told you that promise to get me and then it'll be the third showdown [Applause] listen to me we're gonna go home if you're really a child of God you don't have to prove yourself because if you're really his he'll prove who you are if I preach the word of raising the dead and God believes his word through me I don't have to stand around and say oh you're raised the dead it raised the dead when it comes time for God to raise the dead God will prove his own word is right I don't have to get on these websites and defend the word and defend the message and defend this and defend that if God's a God of his word he'll defend his own words as a matter of fact it's beneath me as a son of God to belittle myself down two o'clock and fight with the chickens when I should be sailing in the heavenlies of God amen he said the pants don't Scott I'm full of the real you saved you Pentecostal from the top of my head to the soles of my feet because brother BAM said Pentecost was God yo was shot until I said that uh-huh you know why we get afraid of that word Pentecost but if he never puts forth another branch he said in rebel unit the visible you in the brightest editor bring forth some of them screaming shouting tongue speak in acts 2:38 youngins people only believe in the supernatural in the church are waiting for brother Branham to put up a tent or shoot a brown bear but I'm telling the power of God is here right now Jesus Christ the same yesterday forever he's sitting right here in this building right now not to do what he's not he's not here to do both quick in a denomination he's here to quicken the bride back to the word that she came from in the bag again his whole purpose of being here right now why did he descend so that he could quicken the seeds the seeds in the ground he wants to quicken he come down 1963 it was a head right didn't Paul say he's a head then had no body just a head you know what the head was looking for rest of his body but REM said his searches looking longing begging looking for somebody's heart that he can make love to I wonder are we going to end this search tonight are we gonna end this search he's been looking since the opening of the seals for a body that would become like his own glorious spot for a doctrine that we become like his own glorious doctrine for a faith that would become like his own glorious faith pour out for a power that we become like his own glorious power come on somatic well she could have been life with his life let me understand it's that back Church hit on 16 7 so I ride in the end time have to do the very same thing because she'll be another branch put forth sage on 15th and the vine you are the branches son can do nothing in himself with what he sees the father doing why he's energized by the main core the roots have the power the roots brings it up through the body the body produces the branches here Amen that's right I don't have the power to raise the dead neither to you I don't have the power to see visions neither to you but if that life of God ever gets stirred up inside of me and he wants to put me asleep even to show me a vision brother been said sometimes they'll close my eyes - show me a vision your old men will dream dreams and your men will see visions and so forth like that and upon my my handmaid and so forth I pull that pour out my spirit why they have to be energized by the branch to bring forth the life of God I'm coming out a new race now a new race of people that's not worn by the first pedigree that doesn't follow the first nature but they're born by the Holy Ghost by the power of God above and they will have life of his life power bout sanctions of the substance she will be him she will be here live and said like in stature perfectman saying this and we're gonna go home he said it'd be God walking into shoes God walking him a shoe leather you want to see Jesus look right here oh you say that's awful bold but if you've got him inside of you you can say the same thing you know you got Jesus because I got faith like in Bert's you like him temperance like him wisdom like him knowledge like him patients like him I got brotherly kindness like he did I got perfect love like he did you say how do you know because I'm manifesting from the vine everything that was inside of him we're just about ready to have Church in here yes sir that he was he's pouring it through the life of the bride of Jesus Christ somebody say he's pying it out to the bride of Jesus Christ she's becoming an extension of his very virtue in life nice things to be like Jesus to be like cheese on earth I long to be like him the devil says I want to be like him too I want to be like him too I want to be God I want to be worshipped like him but he'll just be a cheap impersonator will be the original article yeah I go to the store sometimes my mom used to buy me them old fakey diet Pepsi's you know what I'm talking about old names generic brand I said I don't want that I want the original aFAIK knockoff ain't got nothing like the original and it come on somebody you ever drink an RC Cola on a Moonpie what part of Tennessee y'all from anyways that's right you ever sit down oh you don't want them knockoff brands they ain't got the right sugar it I'm you know I'm not the taste ain't the same way come on now when you get a bite of the irrational Oh dad told me when he goes in behind the holy of holies and get that original word not a knockoff people in the message are producing all kinds of knockoff Christians and knockoff this and knockoff that but this Brides gonna be the original when God's done with her there's gonna be a beauty of holiness that proceeds out of her ain't gonna be no Envy ain't gonna be no strife praise the Lord ain't gonna be no hatred anger me no jealousy ain't gonna be no emulation ain't gonna be running this way and running that way and Hollywood here and Hollywood there she's going to be standing dressed in the robes of his righteousness oh there is revelation one he said that he's standing there Girt about the paps he said why he said because there's a feminine designation in that representation as well look at him East answer that Sevenfold person just not just Christ there but his voice is what a voice of many waters the bride preaching down through the ages his feet like judgment judgment begins at the house of God Paul said don't you know that the Saints will judge angels even everywhere you look bride groom bride groom bride she will be one and she won't just be one in the sense of when you see a husband and wife but should be one in the sense of like Jesus was with God jesus said when you see me you've seen the father and the bride will be that kind of oneness with him when you see me you see the very representation of his character of his life come on oh come on friends if you can't understand the shitty - behold it goes to help you right now you got to understand this is what the bride is coming to this is the culmination of the revelation of the owl we're living in this hour is not about God sent a prophet come on now this hour is not a matter of am coming back setting up a tent it's about who is on the earth today may I say with all humility and respect to God in His Word and to His Prophet as relevant still on the set on the earth going into the desert he said it's time for us to recognize who is in our city today may I say the same thing right down here amen in st. John's mass hating you who is in the city today is the Lord Jesus Christ and bride for manifesting the promised word list and hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah listen to this matthew 26:55 the same hour jesus said to the multitudes are you come out against the thief of swords and stabs ISAT daily with you daily teaching in the temple daily Acts chapter 2 verse 42 they continued steadfastly in Apostles doctrine and fellowship breaking of bread and prayers daily daily fear came upon every soul signs and wonders many signs and wonders were done by the apostles all that we believed were together and had all things in common sold their possessions Goods part of them all men has ever had need and their continuing daily daily in one Accord in the temple breaking house from brick and bread from house to house rather did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart P praising God having favor with all the people in the Lord added to the church daily such as to be saved a man what was it the reason they could come into the things of God like their words because it wasn't just a Sunday religion for him come on now but it was a daily lifestyle listen to me carefully if this message is not your habit it is not your life if it is not the essence of your soul if it is not what you live and breathe and drink and live and live and die by then you don't really have a revelation of this message because if this message really sinks in your heart tell me how you could go back to a Nazarene or a Baptists or a Pentecostal or a Methos or go back to the world for that matter after you drank from the clear waters of eternal life turn around go back to a cesspool it proves you never had the revelation in the first place st. john 6:66 they went out from us because they wasn't a part of us but that bride turned to Peter and said hey are you gonna go you said where could I go this is my life I ain't got nothing else but this that's how God could reveal to him

man it's just like this this brother of that brother another brother is Christ in the pastor is Christ in the evangelists his trace in the teacher of the Apostle and the Prophet he made his Christ he's the one that's ministry to you a man we got to look beyond the man and we got to see God amen I thank God for that word tonight it was I believe with all my heart he was the word of the Lord by the grace of God and when I watch this or need to do it's ordained to give us faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word a man this is not just wasting time this is not just giving increasing your intellectual knowledge of this and that I don't know it's good sense to increase your faith so you could just and got more you're going to believe in God more and more and more and more believe it's now this will leave us how this believers are this amen again they again that's right sway you know maybe the Lord did lead delayed this and ordain of that's our brother to come at this hour and this time this year not 2000 or nothing that was fi but now you know why again God has got his gun at all predestinated I like the way they brought it out God God or a God had this in his mind oh that was wonderful they made God's plan God's purpose God's pattern yet and all in his mind he made his predestinated I and then I'd be with brother preached in here some years ago and he says not an area of your life but it's predestinated amen the thing of it is things to get into it a man is saying to do that you've got a home by yourself and be led by the spirit son of the daughters of God led by the Spirit of God amen and so on into the will of God for your life and we know it all day all line up with this in line up with this word let openness work none of it is hurt a man by the grace of Almighty God and just highlight again what he was saying about your name on the Lamb's Book of Life laying slain from the foundation of the world what is it yeah you look at you and come back here oh yeah that's right amen that's the word for the Aged he's living amen he's lining up with it as the part of God said in the seals he said it doesn't say leave it's going to be safe it doesn't say he said what's his name Norman Ellis could be saying hey man he said buddy see what's in the book he said it's the word he said that calls them and it's the word that they identify with it's the word they represent is the word that they become the word has made flesh in them by the grace of God hallelujah hey man hey that's why that's exactly right brother and you look at all I'm a believer you look and say well well wait a minute don't set your life here with this right Amen yeah yeah it does and it's something it's from the soul amen has their brother but is from the inside out amen another legend misplacing you the hope of glory it's wonderful amen it's God in control a man if you've learned anything tonight learn that he was guarding the trees over a new race amen brother we're not of this world I trust way crazier you got that revelation Amen that we we were a divine race by the grace of Almighty God amen where they were absolutely totally different we had and we are outdated this if you got the Holy Ghost your names on the book I'll turn to this that you're you're you are a pilgrim and you're a stranger and he brought it out and you're a Pokemon a stranger you're not going to get caught up with the natural things of life you guys you're going to deco amen god help us so that we're not putting the emphasis on money and property and possessions that all these Satan definitely not Amy what are we putting the emphasis on a bracelet or go to the kingdom of God going to worship Him we're going to get a new body oh yeah praise the name of the Lord we're program and God again was giving us more faith more revelation of that what what he wants us to do what he wants us to desire hunger for thirst for hey God started it now God is finishing now okay and I trust my grace mother sister you go back and we'll put the the DVDs out here and listen do it again hey man so as you get the revelation and then the judge yourself by what you heard tonight judges shop by the word Amen so the grace of God to bring our brother to bring this out now hey man and like I said before back years ago years ago all they were preaching was God's than a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a promise that was a nun to nineteen and 77 you want to know the significance of 77 that's one of the significance and that's where that's when that's when the begin to get into the hearts and minds of the people about why God sent a prophet and what he had when he come what he did when he came why was that again and then the move from the messenger to the message right by the grace of Almighty God and there's anything we heard tonight it was the message hey man when you talk about a revelation of a mystery there are two Aeneas the bride will understand with our brother Ben preach tonight but I turn that just religious people not going to understand that oh the bride is going to catch it's not for them it's for you because this is this kind of preaching and this kind of kinky there's going to get us out of here we gotta believe it we gotta stand on it and say that's that's that's not just the saying brother band and thus saith the Lord a man a man a man god help us to recognize God in his ministry hey man not just God he William Branham but God in the ministry because now a the public God said he said Oh someone said in the seals will that will the bride ever ever ever ministry he said yes he says the fivefold ministry exist Minear versus the day of Pentecost and it's gonna be right there right on to the end God said the Prophet but now the ministry has taken an eye and brother--he any and you talk about Revelation it was revelation tonight God ministering the mystery of God tonight to us again hallelujah there was tremendous rather than a ganda the the angle that I which he approached the angle a which he brought it out amen we heard this we heard that we heard this which I said well I believe this I believe that well God brought it out man I'd ever away tonight yeah I need it brother God brother a different way tonight and he was challenging do you really believe it do you really believe it and he'll bring it out again and again amen - finally it'll manifest a true faith possibility for head of the Bride of Christ amen I'll stop like a cool one maybe for another two or three hours or whatever then that's good as prophet of God see if you're all believers should go on demand under daybreak what's it a man sure you can because we know that our faith is depending on the word we receive that's given us it's not just not just the letter of it he's got to have a ministry to break it down expound this as it was broken down expounded today thank you bye because in neither why because as I said the problem of God saying we don't catch the the mind of God ourselves he gotta get a profit of there to catch the mind of God and he said the father comes down and he expose it to the ministry and he said the ministry gonna give it to you in a language you understand and that's what God was doing the night amen by the grace of God it was tremendous I did it should be the same God for the word when he went back there it started with the mind of God the tops of God I say well hallelujah oh praise the Lord a wonderful hallelujah but you got to recognize yourself as one of the thoughts of God yeah you gotta add you gotta you gotta not see the reality of who you not physically you brought out enough for that let you know that you're nothing physically no no thank god he's looking on the inside yeah praise the Lord you talk about a new creature praise the Lord and what any of the proposition you brought it out I believe he said he said gods give birth to God's yeah a man a man a man thank God that you are what you said the Messiah amen we are God's a man with the sons and daughters of God think of that thank you that I I agree with your brother and I've sent it to listen the devil believes the message sure you know sure he does he buddies the message here you know he knows God what he knows his time is short I heard you let by the scripture fulfilled so he believes the message so we got to believe it but at the same time we gotta have the life of it we got Avenue house in our soul hallelujah not yet not your beard we never they're talking to somebody right yeah you talk somebody tuck yourself blue in the face with the message and go to hell right why because she because the life on the inside doesn't match it yeah a man god help us brother sister Lord bless you let's sing again the first verse verse Amazing Grace Amen the powder God said being prayer for the service Friday hey man they got minister to us again Friday and increase our faith I trust to grow with more faith stronger faith by the grace of Almighty

[Music] [Music] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus we were in heavenly places tonight hey man look for the god this reminds me a lot of a quote in spoken word is the original seed where your prophet said when God told Adam replenish and multiply the earth your prophet said that Commission that uncoming promise was never fulfilled because Lord God Eve got deceived the serpent got into the womb of a deceived woman before her head Adam got there but your prophet carried on and said Lord that that Commission that he gave Adam was an eternal purpose which could not fail and in this day we had a prophet who said why is Satan howling why is he ingredient why does he want to tighten up the bride it's because the head has come down to the body the great head in 1963 has found another Eve that's pretty estimated not to fall oh that your prophet said God just nice what people feel in the womb of every one of us Lord in this Eve has predestinated not to fall we purchase yourself as father we purchase your worthiness for God for your prophet says here's the secret the word is in the bride like it wasn't Mary a virgin bride clothes she will not be deceived we love you know where do you live thank you Jesus thank you that God food whisper your love secrets tonight a man but God as we walk out five when we woke up for the renewed Lord what father the Lord that's knowledge Lourdes that we are God's Lord amen that we are your image reproduced father that eternal purpose Lord is fulfilled in a super race yes our church under the super sign the Word made flesh in her we love you Lord gracious be glorified as we come back on Friday Lord we pray father that you feed your children once again yes we put all this into your hands hey in Jesus precious name Amen and
