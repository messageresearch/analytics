my SCE are Str my source of Hope is Christ the Lord amen amen praise the lord we get to see each other one more time amen I was attending Services here when we had your when you had your dedication meetings and uh I managed to get in the first two and I went home that Thursday night and to my brother's place I was there by myself and uh I made myself a coffee and a sandwich and and uh I felt a little something going on here and I thought well it's a heartburn maybe I ate something or something you know and it was 10:00 at night and so I made my sandwich had my coffee and and I decided to go to bed but I couldn't get I couldn't get comfortable at all CU it just going on in my chest there and uh so I got up got dressed and went to the kitchen table and so I thought well something's going on in my chest I don't know I have no idea what it is but I phoned the ambulance and they came two young girls and uh she laid me in the stretcher and in the ambulance right out in front of the house there and she says you're having a heart attack so so they put the lights and all that stuff on and the way we went and and ended up one of my arteries was 100% blocked and and they they did the procedure right away and or tried to and um put a tried to put a stint in there right and it was too blocked they couldn't do it so they did some kind of a uh you go ahead have your seat for a moment and uh and uh they did some kind of electric procedure where they blasted you know electric pulse I guess or something like that but anyways it was 100% blocked so it ended up it's 80% blocked after that procedure so I'm thinking Lord uh am I just living on 20% of my original capabilities or what my heart should be putting out 100% And it's only putting out 20% now cuz the other 80% still blocked so I say whatever the Lord has in store for me it's it's been working well ever since you know and uh I've been exercising a little bit through walking and watching my food intake and that sort of thing but uh but uh that was in August and I went home and I was using my nephew's car while I was here before the heart surgery and uh he's 65 he was a professor at the University here Memorial University he's a physicist so he he he rose to Great Heights in the world and very popular man with his students and and his co-workers and so on and uh and he he he helped a lot of uh people out during his lifetime you know 65 years and uh I could go through his life at that's that's not important this morning now but uh he did live a good life and and after I went back home I found out that uh he just got diagnosed with the liver cancer and pancreatic cancer so it uh kind of put a death sentence on them you know so I text him and and it was it was in the time when brother John Andy's back at West there was having some meetings they have summer meetings at the in in uh Lyon Washington they it's a fair type of thing and they have a booth set up where they they witness all what God has done in our generation you know and all that that on all the Miracles that took place in different individuals lives there Brothers and Sisters in Christ and uh so uh Rick was dealing that's my nephew Rick was dealing with this uh was all brand new to him and he wasn't expecting that I don't believe nobody's expecting that right so he uh he was dealing with it and night and I text him and I said you know realizing his condition and so on I and I told him I have these testimonies that I can forward to you you know of the healing virtue of God's grace that a person can grasp you know and and be healed but uh he didn't he didn't want to have that at the moment and he said he was just dealing with the issues at hand the cancer and so on and just hold off he just told me to hold off on it and now I come down to his funeral to his memorial service you know and that's how quick life you know you never know that scripture life is a vapor you know it's here in a moment's time it's like a cloud going over your life and it is gone in a moment in a blink and uh so I thank the Lord for you know we can't go until the purpose of God is fulfilled in our lives and and uh so just remembering his family his wife had two children and his siblings my sister Mary is a is his mother and uh we just want to remember that little family this morning and and their turmoil you know I was reading a scripture invite oh it's okay if I read a scripture uh I just Ed brother Bob's uh U Bible here this morning I was just reading this while I was sitting behind Bob there [Music] he's got his Bible marked up pretty good in Psalm 71 verse 7 it says I am as a Wonder as a Wonder unto many but Thou Art my strong Refuge amen if you cross reference that in your schoolfield Bible takes you over to 1 Corinthians chapter 4: 9 I believe or verse 5 maybe I don't remember quite but Paul says I am weak but you're strong right so you know uh you you take your life in the Holy Ghost and and take just a little group of people here this morning that God has dealt with so wondrously why are we few in number no because we're God's seed amen why do we get to rejoice when we look at people around us they don't have anything to rejoice in and the very thing that would make make them Rejoice they cast it off or don't want it I say Lord thank you for your grace thank you for your love thank you for your mercy when I was weak he was strong amen when I was lost he was the one that came and found me amen when I was down he was the one that picked me up he was my all- encouraging one let's just stand and

dedicated to your worship Lord that as your word would now come forth Lord that we'd be able to feed on it Lord that this wouldn't just be a church experience Lord that this just wouldn't be a a ritual or a habit Lord but it would be a time where we feed Lord and we get filled up on the good things of God Lord that we take it in Lord so that it can produce itself inside of us Heavenly Father each one Lord we're asking you to come by your word this morning Lord that it would have the preeminence in our midst this morning Lord not just the word Lord but the spirit of the word Lord that we would be Lord the spirit would connect with the spirit within us Lord and it would produce itself all over again we pray Lord and in doing so it would push out everything contrary to your word Lord that it would push out every doubt every fear Lord every concern every worry every stress every sickness Lord everything that would come up against that Kingdom within us Lord we pray your word would have full control this morning Lord Jesus Lord forgive us for our shortcomings Lord forgive me where I fall Lord forgive me where I fail forgive me where I won't move Lord but I pray that you'd help me to do better today and tomorrow Lord as we walk this path with you Lord strengthen us for battle Lord give us courage Lord give us Faith to take you at your word we pray Lord for we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Hebrews chapter 13 Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 20 amen good to be here this morning sure blowing a gale out there feels like newf land again amen but we're certainly glad to be here good to see brother Jim douly he uh he he just dropped in on us this morning no advaned warning which means he probably didn't want to preach and honestly in his condition we probably wouldn't push him to do it but it's good to see him looking fit and healthy amen we thank the Lord for sparing him amen sister Melody and brother Kingsley are back home of course with their their young son again and uh similar to what it was with Josh and Michelle we won't see Sister Sister melody or their boy for about a couple months until they get the baby fully vaccinated that's just the way they do things so um she'll be home for a while we may see brother Kingsley from time to time but my wife will send out an email to the sisters on how they can help if they want to help concerning their dietary needs their preferences those different things but they're also waiting on her mother to come into the country and they're waiting on a visa to be approved for her so we want to pray that that'll come through and she'll stay for at least six months usually it's for a year I don't know if they'll get a visa for that long but once her mother comes in she will kind of take over those things but if you want to help then my wife is the one to talk to about that amen amen Hebrews chapter 30 and verse 20 says this now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen God bless you you can have your seats again this morning we're continuing the series on the Holy Ghost and we started a a subt topic of our Assurance last service on Wednesday night and we're going to continue that thought this morning and we talked last service how that God came down to deliver Israel in Egypt to redeem them to take them out of slavery and into Liberty and he did so under a promise amen God judged Egypt and he brought the plagues on Egypt and he kept Israel safe from those first nine plagues but on the 10th plague which was death God said you've got to come through this one and you have to do what I tell you to do in order to be safe and so God made a provided way for them so that they they could get through it but they had to take his way they couldn't come their own way they had to take God had his word and it was a new way it was something they'd never done before something they'd never been taught before but they did it in faith because God said it to do it and if they did it that way then they'd be okay and God required them to kill a perfect lamb and take the blood of that lamb and put it on the lentil on the doorpost on the front door of their home and it was a public testimony and me that was where God drew the dividing line was will you will you admit that you're a Believer and will you commit to being a Believer not just in the privacy of your own home but to the people walking down the street to the ones that are outside that could persecute you for it in these different things and so the testimony was that they believe the word of God Amen that's really what that blood testified is that they believed the word of God Amen and we read this scripture in Exodus 12:13 where we get this this thought on the token in our Assurance this morning it says and God said and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the hous is where you are and we taught that a token is something that proves that a price has been paid amen we don't really do it these days because everything's digital but in the old days if you were going by bus then you would have a token or you could have if you you were going on a train you'd have a token and it was just a piece of metal that would show that you had paid the price and so God says this is the token this is the proof that the price is paid is the blood on your doors he says and when I see the blood when I see the token I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt so God said that blood is the token that's what I'm looking for I need to see that the price has been paid I need to see the proof that you believe and you've obeyed my word and if I see that you can't be touched by this plague you can't be touched by my judgment amen and God required that token you couldn't take the blood of another animal and it would work you couldn't take the blood of an imperfect lamb it had to be exactly the way God said to do it it or God couldn't recognize it amen if it wasn't done according to his word you couldn't hold him to his Covenant you couldn't hold him to his promise amen but we know that everything that was done in the Old Testament is a type it's a shadow it's pointing to something coming down the road it's a representation of what's coming under the new testament which is the New Covenant amen under the Old Testament things were imperfect it was a temporary Confidant it was a temporary agreement for Humanity amen until God would come down as our savior and pay that full price and the blood of those lambs and goats and Bulls couldn't pay the price but it could cover the sin amen it couldn't pay the price for sin but it would cover that sin but the problem was the sin Deb kept building up and building up and building up amen but when Christ came and died for our sins he didn't cover the sin he paid for the sin he erased the sin he separated it from us amen he was a perfect human he lived a perfect life he was a perfect sacrifice for our sins and he gave his own life voluntarily so that our sin debt could be paid it was amazing yesterday as I was listening to a Catholic priest don't ask me why I was listening to a Catholic priest but I was listening to him and he said now they believe he says Protestant Protestants believe that Christ became sin he says but we believe that his work was so perfect that God accepted it versus our sin but the scripture says he became sin who knew no sin see God came down in flesh and he took our place he literally became you and I so that we could become you and him amen and in doing so he fulfilled the law how do you fulfill the law remember what a covenant is a covenant is a contract and what was required to fulfill that contract was a life for a life amen that's the promise God had made God said there has to be a life for a life so when he came came down and with his perfect love his perfect life he shed his blood and gave his life for us he fulfilled the contract that means you are not held to that contract anymore you're not held to a contract of where your conduct is what God's judging you by now God's judging you by did you do what my word says because your sin is not what holds him back now what holds him back is whether you'll take him at his word amen so he moved us forward when Christ died for us and shed his blood he paid the price he fulfilled the law he fulfilled the first contract and now he opens up and that blood opens up a way now to the New Covenant the New Testament the new contract with God Amen and we went from law now to Grace law means you had to do it Grace says you have to receive it that's the difference between the two now Paul talks about this in Hebrews 10 and we're going to spend most of the service in Hebrews 10 this morning he said for the law having a shadow of good things to come in other words it wasn't what was coming but was it was a reflection of it but it wasn't it it was pointing to good things it was pointing to an effective solution he says and not the very image of the thing so it was not the the actual thing it was a shadow of the actual he says that that law can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect so the people that came and offered sacrifices year after year after year in perfect agreement with the law could not not be made perfect it couldn't do that work that's because the law was not there to make them perfect the law was there to cover them until they could come to a place of being made perfect so jumping to verse four it says for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins that was what was required the sins had to be divorced from The Sinner and if the sinner has no sin then is it a sinner anymore no that's where you can come into Perfection is when the sins are divorce from the believer and then Christ is born between Verses 4 and N if we could put it that way and he's the answer to sin amen he's the one that will conquer sin completely see we didn't need a covering we needed a conqueror amen that's really what we needed we needed something that could take us Beyond sin in our lives and so Christ comes and he says in verse 9 then said he lo I come to do thy will o God he takes away the first that he may establish the second he's taking away the first Covenant the law that he may establish the second Covenant the second testament the second agreement amen and now he says in verse 10 by the which we are all are Will by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the blood of the body of Jesus Christ once for all now I want to break that down because he says by the which will we are because he did what was required we are Sanctified we are cleansed we are made pure through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all that means it doesn't have to ever be done again it was done once it's a finished work amen it's a complete work you don't have to do it anymore you don't have to worry or Fred about your life you can move on into the grace of the New Covenant amen he says and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sin so under the law the ministry was there over and over day and day and they had to be diligent if they didn't offer those sacrifices people died people were separated eternally from God they had to be diligent but it was just an a covering for sin they had a purpose God had called them God had placed them but they were just in a holding pattern they were just holding back the wrath of God by those sacrifices cuz Redemption couldn't move forward until the sin debt was paid amen Redemption was at a standstill all throughout the Old Testament yes God was moving towards it but it couldn't do anything it was just keeping them safe until God could do something about it but then we come to verse 12 he says but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering he had perfected had have perfected past tense how long Church forever he has perfected it's a finished work Forever Until the End of Time all of them that are Sanctified do you realize what we just said church that we are in this little bubble of time but in the eyes of God we are perfect we are cleansed we are saved we are glorified we are Justified everything that we have need of that we're looking for in this life is already done in God's eyes when Christ died and paid the price that was it it was a finished work for you and I now we just have to walk through the script this morning by faith and say Lord I'm trusting you that that was a perfect work for me for my family for my house for my church family that's what we're looking for this morning amen when Christ offered himself it was a total and complete work done done done amen that's my rest this morning is it's a finished work of Calvary amen everything we have need of this morning is found in the offering of Jesus Christ at Calvary everything that we have need of Amen notice it's not just it doesn't say by one death it says by one offering cuz he didn't just come and give his life but he gave so much more amen he offered his body he offered his back he offered his head and his face as an offering he offered his very Spirit to us as part of a total offering that day at Calvary amen so it's not just the body it's not just the blood remember what it says in Isaiah 53 it says surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows he took our place it says yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted for he was wounded for our transgressions his death was not for that his wounding was for my transgressions says he was bruised for our iniquities when I do something and I know not to do it that's why he stood there and let them punch him repeatedly in the face it says the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed see he had to do so much more than give his life he had to go there and stay at the whipping post he had to let them press the Thorns into his head he had to let them pull the beard from his face he had to let them punch him and mock him and say who punched you if you're Prophet tell us why so that you and I could be healed we could be forgiven that it could cause God to look past us when we do that which we ought not to do and then he gave his life amen that's what happened at Calvary amen when Christ offered himself in the flesh he held nothing back he gave everything he had Body Soul and Spirit for you and I this morning amen and he exchanged places with you and I so that we could become him as he took our place amen why that offering was to be our total Deliverance it was our Perfection it was our maturing it was taking us back into relationship and position with God Amen Jesus Christ is the open door for our Redemption that's what he is he the open door to bring us back upon that path that takes us all the way back to the beginning amen when he died at Calvary he gave everything he had so we could receive it that's why he gave it up as so that you and I could receive it this morning and take it all the way back into the presence of God and every bit of pain and every bit of suffering he went through even to his very death was so that you and I could stand today as free sons and daughters in Christ receiving the blessings of God Amen remember he became us so we could become him amen there was an exchange there he took on sinful flesh so that we could take on his Perfection and be accepted in the presence of God that's why Hebrews 10:14 says he has perfected forever he has perfected forever because God dwelt in that flesh and he turned it around and said now God can dwell in you that's our Perfection amen Perfection was in Christ and when he came and gave himself at the cross that Perfection came over to you and I and now we get to have exactly what he has amen Paul said it's forever he has perfected forever Hallelujah forever you know what that takes the worry out of it doesn't it that takes the performance out of it that takes the Fring out of it this morning it means it's not working it's not it's not relying on Jonathan klette this morning it's already been done by Jesus Christ amen that's my rest this morning remember what Paul said in Romans 8 he says this there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Jesus Christ no condemnation I don't have to walk around with a with a conscience that's that that that that's active all the time listen he gives me a conscience to bring me to repentance but when I have repented and insincerity insincerity okay this is not something to be messed around with God help us but insincerity when we mess up we go and we say Lord Jesus I am sorry and we put it under the blood and we say help me not to do it again and we can go forward as if we never did it because in his eyes we never did it in the first place amen but he says there are no there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ now watch what defines that that that phrase to them that are in Christ amen is it to people that go to church is it to people that say they're Christians no those that are in Christ he says are those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit those these are those that live the life of Christ and are led by the SP Spirit of Christ that's what determines those who are in Christ Jesus now catch this verse two he says for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death now the law of sin and death could only condemn the law of sin and death could only condemn but he says now there's a different law here and it's the law of the spirit of life and there's a whole sermon in itself here but I'll just keep it short this morning it's not a law where you have to do it or else this is the law of life not only life but the spirit of life amen so it's not legalistic but what it means is that the life in you will Express itself so Paul says for the law of the life that's in me will Express itself that's what's made me free from the law of sin and death I'm not bound by sin because I've been set free from sin I've been born again I'm a new creation a new creature in Christ and there's a life inside of me that's producing something and I couldn't stop it if I tried that's the beauty of being born again is you're a new creation and what you are is what you will produce sheep don't try and produce wool they just produce wool That's the Law of the spirit of life of a sheep and so when you have the law of the spirit of the life of God what does it produce it produces God all over again that's the life that's inside amen why we don't have to have any condemnation because we've been set free from sin we're a new creat creature in Christ by the Spirit dwelling in US amen and it's power it's sin cleansing power it's overcoming power this morning if you have the Holy Ghost amen we're going to dwell on that much more in a future service but I want to read a little later in Romans 8 so you can see where you're living in Christ today I don't church I'm sick and tired of putting things off to the future if we're in the end times and we are then that means God's wrapping up everything that means god is looking to fulfill his total and complete word in you and I this morning so what are we waiting for I say be it unto me according to Thy word amen so let's see what Paul says not what you will be what you are amen he says in Romans 8:28 we know this scripture by heart I'm sure and we know that all things say it with me this morning all things all things brother John it's tough this morning isn't it brother Garfield it's tough but all things work together for our good this morning brother John my children are out it's for your good you say how can that be it's for their good look at Rahab what a life she lived and yet she was in the perfect place that when they came she could put the token on the door and out of that entire city of unbelievers her and her family were saved God put her in the perfect place at the perfect time to produce himself that's it all things are working for good all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren that's you and I many Brethren is you and I this morning he's the first we the we the ones that come behind him he says now moreover he says not just those that He pred he says he doesn't stop at predestination whom he did predestinate them he also called so if God has ordained you to be saved if God knows you as his child then he's going to call you the greatest thing you can have this morning is a call to God because there are people walking around this Earth that have nothing in them to be drawn to God and if he doesn't call you scripture says no man can come to me except the father draw him first when God is p on you church that is the greatest evidence you have that you are a child of God at the start amen but we got to go through the complete process because sometimes what people get caught up in is the feeling of the call rather than the call itself because at some point the call gets difficult and that's where we see if there's really a deep calling to the Deep if there's something inside us being drawn back to God Amen so he said moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified this is not future tense this is all past tense and whom he justified them he also glorified so this is already done the offering of Christ perfected us forever that was a finished work at Calvary that redeemed us that redeeming work put us back into perfection in God's eyes but we're stuck down in this little bubble of time and we've got to go through this process of being redeemed but the work is already finished in God's eyes amen and it's through the blood of Jesus Christ that he can't see our sin he can't see our faults he can't see our failures amen through that veil of blood all God can see is a Justified Sanctified glorified people that's where you're sitting this morning hallelujah amen God's not waiting as we said a few Services ago God's not waiting to see how you'll do before he moves from justification to sanctification ification and sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and from there into glorification he's not waiting on that God starts a work because he's going to finish a work and God doesn't start it if he's not going to finish it amen it's already there amen that's through a perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ and because God knows it's a finished work he declares it in his word that's the Declaration of it he says what then what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us that ought to has change the way that we testify or confess maybe is a better word that when things are difficult when things are hard when things are tight when life isn't so easy when we're failing in sickness and health when it struggles in our marriage whatever it might be we ought to be able to say if God is for me who can do anything to me amen that's the that's what that scripture is saying if God's for us who can do anything ain't nobody can be God the only way anything can touch you this morning is because God lets it in there to help you produce some character to prove who you are that's the only thing it's not there to overcome you it's there to prove you that you are an overcomer amen if God is for us this morning why do we fret why do we worry listen I'm not saying you don't get weary in the battle but I'm saying why are we worrying where we're human we're flesh we get tired but why are we worried if he's for us nothing can hold us back except he allows it for a period of time and everything's only for a season it's only for a portion of time amen that doesn't mean we have to sit back by no means do I preach that amen we don't sit on our couch and say I'm a Believer and God's going to take me all the way to a resurrection and Rapture no we've got to be active in the the kingdom of God but the simple fact is this if you are about his business then God will take you through no matter what amen Paul said all things work together for our good all things work together for our good and that's the rest that I have and that's the rest you have this morning as a Believer he's working all things for my good everything amen if we could only sit back and remind ourselves of that I think that probably be one of the best scriptures you can put on your fridge when you go home today all things work together for good to them who are the called according to his purpose so whether things are good in your eyes or bad in your eyes you can read that and say but he's in it nonetheless we've been speaking about our Assurance this morning and God's trying to tell us I've got this I've got this it's already done it's already finished what you worrying about what's the struggle what's the fight here yes you've got to battle but let me let you know he's letting you know the victory is already assured the answer's on the way way amen God's in control don't worry just sit back and say Lord I believe Lord I believe amen it's like brother Hank said so you know last year when I was there he said we're just in a movie The Script is written and what's the script Church the script is the word of God and it's written and all God has there us as actors to write out something that's already declared from start to finish he's saying you're the good guys you're the Overcomers you're the children of God just keep doing what's written in the script and you'll make it all the way to the end don't worry about it don't deviate amen so he said for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified he says whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us that we whereof means of this so in other words it means the Holy Ghost is also a witness to us of this of what what what's the Holy Ghost a witness to us of it's a witness that we are perfected amen not just perfected perfected forever amen not just a temporary thing the Holy Ghost is the evidence it's the proof that we are perfected forever in other words the Holy Ghost is the token amen it's the proof that the offering has been made the offering has been applied and the offering has been accepted amen it's proof that we're in a New Covenant now that we're in a new testament amen what's a witness for why do we need Witnesses you know if you've ever been in a car accident you need a witness because otherwise it's them against you but what you're looking for is that second witness that will confirm what happened man that's what a witness is for it's used to confirm something I remember when I lived in Alberta and I was out hunting with with my hunting partner out there and we are coming home and we are on this long straight road and you You Could See For Miles and probably about a kilometer away maybe 3/4 of a kilometer away I saw something come out of the ditch and it was tall it was completely black it was very smooth very agile and it came up and it crossed the a a two-lane road in about three or four strides okay so I'm about like I said 750 maybe a th000 meters away so it walked like a man it acted like a man but it was way bigger than a man okay I'm not I'm not trying toe prach some strange Doctrine this morning but I wasn't sure what I saw and so I didn't say anything and then my hunting buddy looked over me he said did you see that and I said I didn't say yes here's what I saw I said what did you see because see you can't put words into a witness's mouth it has to testify on its own and so I said what did you see and he described the exact thing that I had just said and we looked at each other and then he put his foot down on the accelerator and we got there in a hurry to see if we could see this thing and when we got there it had completely disappeared now I'm not preaching that I believe in a Sasquatch or Bigfoot but that's the only thing that made sense there it was the weirdest thing and if you know me I'm not into these things at all but this thing crossed the road in three or four steps and then disappeared gone and it didn't have a whole lot of places to hide either we couldn't believe it anyways we still talk about to this day but if he wasn't there I wouldn't have said anything about it but he was a witness and of his own mouth without me prompting him he told me exactly what I had seen with my own two eyes that's what a witness is there is to confirm Paul says the Holy Ghost is a witness to us it's a confirmation to us that what we believe has happened has actually happened that's what it is amen it's the second Witness that's required for anything to be proven the scripture says out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses let a thing be established I witness I've received it and the Holy Ghost Witnesses I've received that what the New Covenant the new the the the new contract the New Testament amen that Holy Ghost is a con it's a confirmation it's an assurance that I have passed from Death unto life amen it's the assurance that I become a new creation that you become a new creation a new creature in Christ now remember when Israel was getting ready to leave Egypt the blood was proof of a price that was paid but until that price was put on the door it didn't do them any good amen the Covenant of God the promise of God was only effective if they did what God had said to do in his Covenant amen they couldn't say when that death angel came down God knows my heart that doesn't work anymore Church it never really worked but you can't say God knows my heart I lived a good life that did not turn away the death angel what turned away the death angel was the blood on the door that was the only thing that worked God didn't say when I see your heart I'll pass over you God didn't say when I see your good works I'll pass over you God said when I see the token of the blood I will pass over you and until that was there the Covenant had no effect on you you can say I read it I believe it I accept it but until that blood was on the door you had no you had no assurance that the that the death angel was going to pass amen but remember in the Old Testament it's just a shadow and the blood the token back then was just protection from judgment that's all it did it was protection it was holding back the wrath of God but now we come into Hebrews 10 and we see a different effect of the blood now we see a different effect of the Holy Ghost as the token for our life amen because now it's not just protection from the wrath of God because the blood completes the the law it fulfills the law it pushes the wrath of God away completely but now it's not just protection but it's access amen the token the Holy Ghost is access amen the blood of God was the key that open the door to Redemption and now that gives us the spirit that takes us along the path all the way back to God Amen that's what allows us to come back into relationship the blood opens the door but it's the spirit that takes us in if I can put it that way way now we see from the scripture that the Holy Ghost is proof positive that's what it is a witness is proof positive that God has accepted the sacrifice of Christ amen and it shows him you that he has accepted your sacrifice of what faith faith simple belief in his word amen that you've repented you've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and then as a confirmation that you have followed his word he fulfills the rest of his word by giving you his very own spirit and now you're on the road back we're on the road to we're on the boat to China as brother Mark says we're going back and nothing's going to get us off the boat it's going to go all the way through so he said whereof the Holy Ghost also is made a witness to us for after that he had said before remember God fulfills his word God doesn't just come up with a bunch of new stuff he says the Holy Ghost is a witness to us and this is because he said he was going to do it there's nothing new happening in other words when it comes to the Holy Spirit it was prophesied before in Ezekiel 3 six amen he said he put his new spirit in them and and we'll cover that in a moment but if you want to see where you're supposed to be today you've got to find it in the word because Paul's saying we're in the time of Ezekiel 36 we're in the time of Joel 228 that was the day of Pentecost that was their message for their day and if they had tried to continue on in the law which is what he was trying to get them out of in Hebrews right in Hebrews 4 he's trying to get them away from the Sabbath and into Christ who is our Sabbath trying to to get them away from a day and get them into the Eternal all these different things he was trying to get them away from death and bring them into life and it's through the Holy Ghost amen and he's saying there is a prophecy given that this Holy Ghost would come upon you and if you can accept that this is your day and your message then you can have what God has for you today it's that simple we've got to know the day we're living in so we can know the message we're supposed to be sitting under so we can know what we're supposed to be doing and receiving it all goes together and he says for this for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days so he had a covenant under the law but there's a covenant coming now that's different he says that that I will make with them after these days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them so God said it back in Ezekiel 36 and that made it a promise and a covenant When God says anything it's a covenant cuz God can't lie amen we cover that last time but he had to fulfill his first Covenant before he could enter into the second Covenant you can't have two contracts that are contrary to one another simultaneously you've got to satisfy the first before you can go into the second and then he says and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more remember what Paul said perfected Forever This is the Fulfillment of it or this is the the prophecy of it he says now where where there is remission now where remission of these is there is no more offering of sin that word remission means full forgiveness and full separation so he says where there's full forgiveness and Liberty you don't have to keep coming back and begging God to forgive you amen the Roman Catholics will preach you got to pre you got to say a bunch of hail marries listen you go once and it's done and you don't have to hail Mary or anybody else there's only one mediator between God and man and that is the man Jesus Christ amen you don't have to pray your family out of purgatory there there is no such a thing me you don't have to come back and forth you don't have to pay a price Christ paid the price you just have to take that payment that's it that's it amen everything else is false religion Christ paid the complete price so that we can accept it and move forward with God Amen we don't have to keep coming back to things in our past we don't have to do it now what is this supposed to do for us verse 19 says having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus he's talking about the holy of holies in the temple and that was the place where the Ark of the Covenant was that's where the the the Mana was that's where Aaron's Rod was the Almond rod and that was where the dwelling place of God Was His shikina glory the presence of God was there in that Temple and only one person could come twice a year into that twice on the same day and it was the high priest so one person on one day of the year could go into the holiest of holies and he had to come in with blood for himself to cover his own sins and then if God accepted that then he would go out and then he would come in again with blood for the s for the sins of the people and he would pour it over on the altar uh or the seat that was on the Ark of the Covenant and he would turn the Judgment seat into a Mercy Seat but the presence of God was there and if you came in and you were not the high priest if you came in and you didn't have blood or you came in aside from that one day of the year God struck you dead immediately it was judgment to enter the presence of God and then Paul comes here in verse 19 and he says have boldness to enter the holiest what they could only enter one person once a year he says everybody can go in and you can come in boldly you can come in with expectation you don't have to be cringing and looking around and is he going to kill me come in because he's invited you in when Christ died that day of Calvary he tore the veil to say what it's open it's open you don't have to go through a man you don't have to go through a Ministry Christ has opened the way through his sacrifice amen he says enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus but what does that look like he says by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh so Paul's saying there's a new way of living and you've never lived this way before Jews amen you've never done this before he says you might have lived good by the law but this is not legalism now but this is a new way it's a living way and it's not your life now but it's another life inside of you that's going to produce this what is it it's the Holy Spirit the witness inside of us that we passed from Death unto life that's our witness that's our token that's our assurance that we passed from death into life and we can come into the presence of God freely and with boldness amen that's our Assurance of life is that we have the Holy Spirit living inside of us Paul says in Galatians he says I'm crucified with Christ he says I died just like he did now did Paul die just like Jesus did no Paul's speaking here he's still alive but he's saying I've Crucified My Flesh I've crucified my mind I've crucified everything he's also saying that I was in him when he died I was in him but then he says this nevertheless I live there's a New and Living Way yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live where in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me it's a New and Living Way and he says it's by Christ Living In Me by the Holy Spirit brother Bram says this he says God is your joy God is your strength he he says knowing the message knowing the truth that's our sufficiency now he is my all sufficiency in him all things I have need of are in him that's our strength My Help Cometh From The Lord he says you Christians Look to Him for your joy Look to Him for your strength Look to Him for your happiness he is my peace he is my joy he is my love he is my life he says that's a covenant the token upon the door amen so when you receive the Holy Spirit into your soul it's not just an experience in a church service amen it's not just a confession of your heart and your mouth amen but when it's a true dying out of self and Christ is living inside of you that's the greatest event you will have in this flesh until you get a body change because it's deity what condescending to live in flesh again amen it's the greatest thing because you passed now from death into life oh this breath can go out of this body but you just go directly into what a glorified one a Celestial one first and then you'll come back in the resurrection you'll pick up this Earthly body and it'll be glorified amen now you have access to the tree of life now you have access to the full word of God now you have access to the presence of God the person of God if we could put it that way and what does it do Paul says it changes your approach because now we have boldness instead of fear now we have confidence and Assurance instead of worry and doubt that's what the Holy Ghost does for us amen it changes our attitude because not only has he forgiven you but now you have an assurance that what you're a part of him that you always were a part of him and that he's bringing you back to him amen it's all wrapped up in one big thing but watch how Paul finishes this portion in Hebrews we're speaking on our Assurance this morning and let's see what Paul says that we should have he says in having an high priest over the house of God let us do what draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith he says having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water and I want to break that down a bit this morning he says draw near he's saying don't hold back don't let anything hold you back from the presence of God used to be it was death to go in now the spirit of God is driving you back to it so don't push back don't hold back don't let this hold you back from that don't let this hold you back from that and we'll address how he does that in in a little bit but he says get close to God Access is made available this is where life is get close to God don't pull back but watch the qualifier here Paul doesn't say everyone should approach him confidently he says draw draw near with a True Heart amen I'm telling you I've seen an awful lot of people speaking confidently about what God supposedly telling them and giving them and they're 100% contrary to the word of God I sharing some things recently with some some folks at our home and we're seeing the twisting of scriptures to massive proportions to where they are calling what the scripture says is good as evil and what the scripture says is evil is good it's happened we're already here been here for a long time amen but people are trying to get others to believe their Ministry to accept their gift and in that give them their power give them their money give them their rights and all it's doing is building up the kingdom of a man or a woman as the case may be but Paul says you got to come into His presence with a true heart I look that up and it's beautiful it says a true heart is that which has not only the name and resemblance he says but it's the real nature corresponding to the name in every respect corresponding to the idea signified by the name it's true and genuine now that's kind of fancy words what's he saying he's saying you've got to come in to the presence of God with the nature of God a lot of people call themselves Christians this morning but he says you can't come in because you have the name you have to come in because you have the nature and there's only one way you get that nature it's by the indwelling presence of the holy spirit amen you have to have the nature of God to come into His presence Paul's saying when you have the Holy Spirit you can come into God's presence because you're coming in as he is amen so how do we approach it he says with full Assurance of Faith amen why because if he's changed our life he's changed our attitude he's changed our desires he's changed our Focus Focus he's changed our approach he's changed everything so why would we not expect him to keep changing why would he we expect him to not keep working to keep producing himself in our lives to keep us growing and maturing of meeting our needs in these different things amen that's what he does and then he says in verse 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering you go into his presence and you get Faith and more faith and more faith and Paul says when you go out keep saying what you said in there keep saying what you said in there in church we have all Faith don't we in special meetings we have all Faith but he says now you've got to keep you got to keep that Faith now when you walk out you got to keep that profession that confession upon your lips let your mouth keep saying what your experience was and it'll produce the word again in your life but what is what is the reason that we can have faith he says for he is faithful that promised he didn't say I was faithful he said he was faithful that's my rest I'm up and down church and maybe the ups and downs are getting a little flatter by God's grace but I'm still up and down and sometimes I feel like I'm a little bit in and out but that's not my rest my rest that Paul said is that he is faithful that promised that's my rest this morning amen what is our Assurance we have the spirit of God in us as a witness that we're a part of him but what does that Holy Spirit do it points us back to the promises of God it points us back to the word of God not some ISM not some f not some fancy idea not some uh you know uh Prosperity Doctrine it points us back to the richness of the true word of God and says he promise you can rest your life on it you can rest your soul on it you can rest your finances on it you can rest your family on it you can rest your job on it you can rest your education on it you can rest your very being on that because he's promised who faithful Paul saying stick with it stick with it don't back away don't let circumstances push you back raise a standard of the word and say you promised you promised and I'm staying here until you give me what you promised That's The believer's Stance you said it I believe it and I'm not going to move by God's grace having done all to stand stand we've done so much work Paul says ye did run well what hindered you don't let it push you back we work so hard to grow in Christ don't let Satan knock us back with circumstances just proves that he sees the work that's going on Amen but we come into His presence under those conditions with a True Heart a changed life a changed nature and that gives us confidence that he'll receive us and then what does the spirit do it always points us to the word of God Scripture says he'll lead you into all truth that's what the spirit of God does it leads you into all truth and it's a changing truth amen because we read in last in our last service that God cannot lie he's not a man that he should lie and so I can sit there and I can sayl I'm trusting you don't lie that's it every single day amen our rest is that he promised it and therefore he will do it so we see then from this that the purpose of the holy spirit is to draw us into the presence of God to open the word to our lives so that I can produce the word that's what he's trying to do get us into his presence so we can read the word of God the promises of God and then bring our life into alignment with it amen remember what he said in Ezekiel he said I will cause you to walk in my statutes I'll cause you to live by my word amen and that's what the holy spirit's doing in our lives amen so we'll be living by the word whether we're in training whether we're in testing whether we're in persecution whether we're in character development but also whether we're in healing Deliverance leadership provision all those things it's all the word of God producing our life amen because it's not just causing us to change but it's leading us into the realities of the word of God every single day that's what the holy spirit's trying to do amen everything we have need of is found in Christ the word amen it's all through him it didn't start at Calvary amen The Book of Revelation says that it was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world God knew what was going to happen God had a plan God had a remedy God had a solution prepared before we ever needed it amen so God knew everything from start to finish and he made a plan to get us back to him but that Redemption plan wasn't put into effect until Christ came everything was in a holding pattern up till then but I want you to see something here before we go too far as we go into the last third of this service perhaps Christ came and he shed his blood and we claim that blood don't we we claim that blood we claim that blood for different things it's for forgiveness of sins for instance but the blood is not the complete answer answer it's not just the blood see the blood of Christ opens up the way for this Covenant but the blood is not the Covenant it's the blood of the Covenant but it's not the Covenant amen the blood of Jesus shows us that the price was paid but that's what starts or initiates the New Covenant it's the door it's the access to the New Covenant but remember what a covenant is a covenant is a promise or an agreement amen we'd say today it's a contract that's a the modern word be a contract it's a it's a it's a it's a promise to do something or to exchange something and it's an illegal document if you sign a contract then it's enforceable they can take you to court and they can force you to do what you said you were going to do that and God's covenant to us was not that he would shed his blood only God's covenant to us according to Ezekiel 36 was that he'd change us the Covenant is that he'd change us amen the mechanism is the blood the blood is the way to do it everything comes through the blood amen God was trying to get us to a place where we could live uh a life that was pleasing to him so I want to read this in Ezekiel 36 so we can see what the Covenant is he says then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you that's justification that's removal of your sins and that's what the blood does the blood is a cleansing effect amen then he says a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh this is sanctification it's a changing of your desires and it's giving you a nature that can get along with God Amen it's a nature that's teachable that's trainable it's not stubborn it's not pushy it's a life-changing experience but it's not life itself amen you want to get to this point but this is not the end of the contract this is not the end of the Covenant the end of the Covenant is verse 27 he says and I will put my spirit within you you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them everything verse 25 and 26 is to get you to verse 27 that's the Covenant the Covenant is I'll put my spirit within you Amen to be filled with the spirit of God to be led by the spirit of God and to be put into action by the spirit of God to live according to the word of God and unless you get to verse 27 you have not received the Covenant you're on the away but you're living under your privileges that's God's covenant that's God's full Covenant he'll take away your sins he'll change your nature and then he'll put himself in that's the full contract that's Clause 1 2 and three you'll see here he didn't say I'm going to give you the blood he said I'm going to give you my spirit how does he give us the spirit through the blood the blood's the mechanism it's it's the Catalyst it's the thing that starts this whole thing amen but God's covenant is that he would change you and so this morning we have a right by contract if we are children of God to go to God and say God I need you you know we sang that song fill my cup Lord what are we saying we're saying God I need more of you and we can do that by contract he promised to put his Spirit within us so the only thing that's holding him back is who this guy that's the only thing holding him back as much as I open he'll fill as much as I let him empty out he'll fill with his spirit amen as much as I let him work in my life that's how much he'll work God didn't say I'll give you my blood God said I'll give you my spirit but the blood is what brought us that amen he shed his blood and the life of that blood is what comes back on us if he didn't shed the blood we can't get the life from it amen he had to shed that amen he didn't promise US blood alone but he promised us life and more abundantly Christ said amen life and more abundantly and so that God said we come from a law way to a living way a living way and that's by the spirit amen it's by the spirit and we'd be changed from the inside light inside out our our covenant is for new life a living way eternal life not just a sin cuffing amen now in the book of Exodus God made a promise he made a a covenant a contract to the Israelites and he says if you put put the blood of the Lamb on the doorpost death can't touch you and God gave them a way to bypass judgment but remember what Paul said it's just a type it's just a shadow it's just pointing to something amen and God ordained all sorts of sacrifices and God ordained all sorts of blood offerings for things that they dealt with if they had committed sin if they were unclean if they were sick if they had touched a h a dead person's body if they had come in contact with a gentile all these things all these little issues with life God had a sacrifice for it but when Christ died at Calvary that contract was fulfilled and now you didn't have to do that amen now there's a new covenant a new contract between man and God and it's completely by grace and now it's a contract that brings you into a new spirit a new birth a new creation that's what's God's promised here amen as we read in Ezekiel and he's going to do it the way he did the first one by Blood by Blood amen the blood is the thing that signs the contract it's the one that puts the contract into action it's the one it's the stamp of approval of God's contract is the blood that was shed God said when I see that blood I'll pass over you amen we would say today that the blood is the payment it's what ratifies it it's the one that signs off on that contract it's a part of it but it signs it off and in Hebrews 13 this is our opening scripture as we start to close he says now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant it's a part of it but it's not it it's a part of it it's not everything the blood's the mechanism for what God's trying to do and what is that Covenant going to do church it's going to make you perfect in every good work to do his will what did E Ezekiel say to cause you to walk in my statutes this Covenant is going to bring you into alignment with the word of God and what does it say it's doing it's working in you the Covenant is working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Christ Jesus to whom be glory forever and ever this Covenant is producing The Life of Christ back in us again making us what acceptable and pleasing before God I'm going to wrap it up with a rather long series of quotes this morning from the message a token he says now in Hebrews 13:20 it's called the Everlasting Covenant he says why wasn't it called Eternal Covenant because that it wouldn't be eternity when we're redeemed it's all over then it's Everlasting which means it's for a certain amount of time till time is out there'll never be another one when time runs out we won't need any Covenant but until the time runs out we need the Covenant he says God's bloodbound promise promise makes us free from sin amen there's no sin in him sin sell for flesh worship him and show forth his promised power God's bloodbound token bound Covenant people have the spirit of Jesus Christ in here that he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also he's saying what displaying the Covenant see the New Testament means the New Covenant the Old Testament was the old under the lamb that the life could not come back on the believer the life of a natural lamb couldn't come back on us he says the New Testament was the Lamb of God and his life comes back on us it's the blood's life blood is life in the New Testament see the life is from the blood of the Lamb which means the New Testament the New Covenant the life is it but it's through the blood he says that God said after those days will I write my laws upon the fleshly tables of their hearts see not upon the Stony tables with the Lamb's blood which you had to say yeah I got the blood over here now what does it say to do he says he's saying that under that he says under the blood of the natural lamb you'd accept that and then you'd say well what am I supposed to do now and it was la la la la law he says but now it's upon the tables of your heart see the spirit Covenant will I make with the people see the blood what it released the spirit it released the life out of it and that brings us into a living way not just a covering but it's a living way he says and it displays his power John 14:12 says he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also Christ said lo I come to fulfill what's written of me in the book in the the word of God that's the same thing we're going to do he says and the same thing we are doing he says New Testament is New Covenant New Life shows that Jesus has met every requirement for us that God required to make us back truly Sons and Daughters of God under the blood where there is no more condemnation he says Romans 8:1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in not those who are believing it but those who are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the SP spirit and he says and my word is spirit and life you can't say you're walking according to the Holy Spirit and be living contrary to the word of God that's what he means he says there's no more condemnation we're free from sin we're free from the cares of the world no condemnation he says why to them that have been by one Spirit baptized into one body there the blood of the Lamb has been applied the god of Heaven has accepted you his life is in you and you are sons and daughters of God he says your character is God's character he says what is that a little pushover no sir God's a god of judgment he's a god of correctness it must be on the line it must be in line with the word nothing else will do that's the kind of character you are because you're the character of your father now watch remember what Paul says you got to come in with a true heart he says the life now watch when the life is taken for the blood see the life itself is taken the blood was applied and the life could not come on the believer then for the life of an animal but see instead of a human being he's speaking of Christ it was a super super super human being see and that makes the human now not only a human being but he's a son and daughter of God of the super super super super life that was in him it comes back upon you and changes you from a sinner and the things of the world a church member see where we can't rely on the fact that we go go to church amen church membership isn't how we get into heaven it's not it has nothing to do with it he says it gets you it changes you from a church member and a denominational goer to a born again Christian filled with the spirit and he says what does this look like it's the life of God just flowing from you like Sparks from an anvil what's an anvil an anvil is a big piece of metal that a blacksmith uses to shape metal and what do you do with metal to shape it you beat it you pound it you heat it up and what happens is as you're striking that metal with your Hammer he says it's the sparks flying what is it it's Christ in you producing himself and it's a constant work it's a constant work and there's pressure with it and there's there's trials and there's tests and there's all these different things he says but it's like Sparks from an anvil as you walk full of virtue and love and gentleness and as the holy spirit's moving and speaking oh my there you are he says and with hearing the message watching the pillar of fire and the Blessed assurance that I've passed from Death unto life he says note therefore there's no condemnation at all but he says if our hearts condemn us not then we can have our petition he's quoting scripture he says see we know but if sin is in our heart then it condemns us we might as well not not even start you can't go into God's presence and ask for something if you've got condemnation in your heart if your conscience is bothering you you can't do it because what doubt will be there you don't know where you're standing you don't have Assurance but remember what he says he says if our hearts don't condemn us then we know that he hears us and we can have what he says but then Paul says but if our hearts condemn us if we go into his presence and there's something hanging over us Paul didn't say you got to get out he said God is greater God is greater than our condemnation and he knows all things in other words God can get you through it God can clear your conscience God can take that thing that's hanging over you away so that you can come in with full confidence listen we've got a conscience for a reason but the answer to the conscience is always what repentance and if you repent and put it under the blood now you can come in with full confidence in other words God will get you past whatever you need to get past amen through forgiveness if needed and a cleansing of your conscience he says you've got to get free from sin and the only way you can get free from sin is get in him that's the only covering there is for sin is Christ because remember you can be justified you can accept the blood of Calvary that pays for your sin but your nature hasn't yet changed and so you can't get away from your conscience you got to deal with the conscience and that's only by a New Birth by the Holy Spirit you got to get in Christ and there's only one way he says remember the Covenant blood is not recognized without the token you cannot you will not you say well I've been Sanctified from things he says that's not the token he says it's the spirit is the token the spirit of Christ upon you he says believe it now look he says the word assures us of the promise remember what we read where he says he is faithful who promised it he says now look the word assures us of the promise the word assures us of the promise because it the Holy Spirit that's the living word amen my words are spirit and life because it is the promise the word is the promise the word is God and the word is ours and we become the word and the word becomes us if you abide in me and my word is in you then see it just becomes one great big family see it assures us because why he says well it's part of us see it becomes part of us and it assures us the promise he says the token is the sign that the purchase has been made and it's been accepted he says now you can't get the token from the railroad Fair until you pay the price and the only way you're going to pay the price is pay it there's no other way to pay something except to pay it he says that's right and what he says what's the price you've got to pay what's the price that I've got to pay he says our payment is to believe it accept it full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token full obedience to the word of God will get you the Holy Spirit that's what he's saying full obedience not the part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ now listen to what he says here now what if you just all in but your feet are hanging out he says most of us are all most all of us in but the heart is hanging out see the hearts in the world yet but we don't do that he says full complete obedience puts you and the word as one he says you believe it every bit and all of it's in you and you watch it working through you see the holy spirit is not something that I control it's something that controls me I'm not trying to create I'm not trying to produce I'm not trying to make things happen he says you watch it working through you I've got to get myself out of the way and let God have control that's my rest is that he's got it all in control and I'm not trying to force it amen I'm not trying to make things happen it's all him he says you don't go around with a bunch of carrying on see you're a Christian no matter what anybody says they'll never touch you you're in Christ you're as safe as can be When Death knocks at the door it has no hold see not at all why it's just stepping out of here into there age means not a thing you've passed from age you're in eternity because you're in him and he is eternal that's why we don't worry if we're going to die that's why we don't worry as we see ourselves getting older and grayer and things starting to slip that's why brother brother brother Jim du is not worried about heart attacks this morning he's passed from Death unto life anden he knows that if he passes from here he's got a greater thing waiting for him over there and then it's going to bring him back here that same Spirit it'll lift him up into the presence of God that's our rest this morning he says it doesn't mean a thing whether you're young old middle AG or whatever you are okay that's all of us pretty ugly short fat what it doesn't matter a thing praise the Lord amen you don't go around he says it doesn't you don't go around and all these other things you have passed from that you're dead your life is hidden in God through Christ you're sealed in there by the holy ghost walking in Christ the only object you see is Christ that's all he's not looking at me why should I be looking at me let your word be born in me look at him Church everything we have need of is in Christ the word I'm going to close with a scripture and one small quote I took this from Hebrews 6 and I read this in my devotions the other morning that just jumped out of me and I I loved what the Amplified says and it's a bit wordy but I want you to just listen to this this morning as we close out it says accordingly God also in his desire to show more convincingly and Beyond doubt to those who were to inherit the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose and plan he's trying to convince us he's got this all in control he's trying to convince us it's all going to plan that he's got a purpose in all of this he said he intervened with an oath and this was so that by two unchangeable things his promise and his oath see for men we need to say it and then we need to swear it and he would say in those days that's how they confirmed it is they would give a promise and then they confirm an oath and they'd say you know let me be as this animal we've sacrificed if I don't do my part and that's the thing that satisfies men is not just when we give a promise but when we give an oath to back it up and God said this is the only way they're going to accept it is if I do it the way they do it so he says I am going to do it I'll give them my promise which I'm going to do no matter what but then I swear it by an oath he says in which it is impossible for God ever to prove false or deceive us we who have fled to him for Refuge might have this great thing mighty indwelling strength and strong encouragement to grasp and hold fast The Hope appointed for us and set before us this confident Assurance we're preaching on our Assurance this morning this confident Assurance we have as an anchor of the Soul watch this description church I cried when I saw this it cannot slip and it cannot not break down under whatever pressure Bears upon it Hallelujah I'm going to read that again he says it this confidence Assurance we have as an anchor of the Soul this is the Covenant of God to you sealed by the holy spirit that it cannot slip listen we slip we fall we fail this cannot slip it is surefooted nothing can trip it nothing can knock it down nothing can pull it back it stands unmoving and it cannot break down it cannot it is impossible that it can break down whatever pressure Bears upon it Hallelujah he says a safe and steadfast hope that enters the very certainty of the presence of God within the holy place that's not out there church know ye not that ye are the Temple of the Holy Ghost this steadfast confident assurance that cannot slip that cannot break no matter what comes on our lives that's the witness we have this morning that's the Assurance as something keeps holding me when I can't even hold myself that's what lifts me up again he never fell I fell he never failed I failed but he's standing there and he never slips and he never fails even when I do Hallelujah this confident Assurance he says prove all things the Bible said I can't make him do it but he promised to do it he says that's where I hold it he promised that he would do it amen hallelujah let's stand this morning amen do you believe him this morning amen church I know we've gone through rough times we're going through rough times we've got challenges we've got things that are coming against us we've got uncertainty we've got people that are tearing us down we've got family that's ripping into us we've got all sorts of things going on this is my rest this confident assurance that it cannot slip it cannot break down whatever pressure Bears upon it amen I'm not trusting in me I failed me many times this week amen but he's never failed me yet amen he stands there he is our Assurance he is our Rock he is our shade he is our provider he's our healer amen he is my rest he is my Assurance and I don't have to go to some Temple anymore I don't have to go to some some City I don't have to go to some man because I carry this assurance with me by the holy spirit that he'll never leave me he'll never forsake
