the name of our Lord Jesus Christ grace Jesus now I believe all things are possible concerning what God has done rather what God's doing now we believe traceable I [Music] Oh fainter possible [Music] [Music] [Music] possible amen god bless you turn with me in your Bibles to st. Matthew's Gospel chapter 13 st. Matthew chapter 13 the grace of God has been going to the word and endeavoring again to bring it to a conclusion regarding what we have started on hearing and seen the way that God wants us to hear and see and the right motives and the right objectives a man and everything comes down to hearing and seeing everything comes down to having the right motive and a right objective based on what we're hearing and seeing a man this is what God is looking at are we hearing it the way God wants us to hear it are we seeing it the way God wants us to see it and do we have the right motive and the right objective toward the revelation amen where are we really truly on green and thirsting to get out of here a man Mostar to cut up with the natural things of life that brother they don't really don't want to go yet but I tell you you gotta want to go when you want to go you'll go amen by the grace of God so god help us again to give us the right spirit the right attitude the right motive the right objective a man in what we believe and brother again let me say it again there's many that say they believe the word they believe the message but they don't have a right motive and a right objective I've seen that as I said for over 50 years and still seen it but it's getting worse amen so the grace of God be with us as we go to conclude hopefully that tonight or on Wednesday concerning these thoughts but in st. Matthew's Gospel chapter 13 and beginning to read at verse 13 therefore speak I to them in parables because they seeing see not than I've seen as God wants them to see it and it says earing they hear not and neither do they understand guy wants to us to see the way that he sees it the way that he hears it a man the way they wants us to see it an arat a man and if it's that way then we'll have the understanding and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah was saying by hearing ye shall hear and not shall not understand seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive they're not going to hear it or see it the way they should or they need to to give them the faith that they need for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of airing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart a man and should be converted and I should heal them a man to be healed spiritually to be healed in our souls a man going beyond the natural heating to the spiritual so again he said ear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them and it says but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear a man for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which he hear and have not heard them a man god bless his word you may be seated I pray the lord help me to stick to the notes or to stick to the quotes concerning what God has said through his servant the prophet and again understanding this that it wasn't William Branham it was God a man it was God doing what II by grace wanted to do for you and me in the hour that we are living brother is not that God wanted to come back with what Luther had in Wesleyan and the Pentecostals but no it is it is to bring it all to a conclusion and it is it is the cap it off it is to crown it and as he said in 1965 that he said my menace my message is the crowning he said of the Pentecostal message it is the crowning of what God did in the early days of the Pentecostal revival a man than it is for the calling out of the bride it is for the resurrection it is for the rapture it is for the change it is brother Ezra bring everything to a conclusion a man and is to take us from time to eternity a man now the brother according to history the Pentecostals the early Pentecostals of over a hundred years ago they really believe many of them back they and really believe that that the message that God had give them and what God was doing in them and what God was doing through them they believed that God was going to it was going to bring the resurrection and the rapture her brother the faith that God gave under the Pentecostal message was not resurrection and referring faint it was the faith of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it was the faith of the gifts of the Spirit a man as weak as we clearly discern and see what God has done that the revelation of the faith that he gave them getting that he gave them back in the days of Luther it was the faith of the revelation of justification because that's what they needed they didn't need the faith that God is giving you and me a man concerning the resurrection rapture because it was in the hour for the resurrection it was in the hour for the rapture it was the hour for man to be justified because God said I will restore seeing the Lord and to restore he would have to begin with justification a man he would have to justify his seat he would have to justify the elect and the very elect of God and so he began at beginning with Martin Luther and he gave them the revelation of justification he given the revelation - Wesley of sanctification of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit brother what power what anointing was on the earth and in the earth and it was on the saints of God and in the saints of God down through those ages and down through those years because I can I can look back and remember the moving of the Spirit of God I can look back and sense the anointing in the atmosphere a man morning noon and night the anointing was there morning noon and night not just in church it was out there a man no matter where you were you know you could have been at your job you could have been in school you could have been in your home the anointing was there a man but that anointing is now there like it used to be a man because moving away from the Pentecostal message and into the bride message we're getting Ida out of the loud of C&H and into the bride age so what is what it wasn't what God did in in the previous ages is one thing and what he's doing in this age is another and not only that but the number of believers said we're in existence man is one thing but the number of believers that are here now is another a man there were maybe thousands that during the Pentecostal revival but they're very very very few during in the right revival a man that it is getting less and less and less and less no doubt that we could we could identify maybe thousands in Luther's day thousands and thousands in Wesley's name and there were thousands that identified with the Pentecostal revival and the Pentecostal message a hundred years ago and maybe even back back to 50 or 60 years ago a man but then we came out of that the bride did and we came into the revelation of the mystery of God the finish of the mystery of God a man back him back in the in while for the believer it was in the end of in the 60s and maybe in the late 60s as we approach the seventies I believe there was anything any any area that is a or time that is important for us to behold and to see what God was doing and what God did it is in the late sixties and the seventies because again those that were in the Pentecost revival identify with the Pentecost revival and what God did and what God was doing that was coming to a conclusion after the going of the Prophet and we were seeing less and less of the Pentecostal revival we were experiencing less and less of the anointing of the Holy Ghost a man it just wasn't there like it used to be a man brother but in it wasn't on the number of people that he used to be on and there were thousands experiencing the power of God thousands experiencing the baptism of the Holy Ghost thousands were experiencing the gifts of the Holy Ghost but it began to begin to dwindle down because by Pentecost like all the rest they became a denomination amen they organized and in what God had done in the early nineteen hundreds to them he was just becoming a doctrine and it was becoming just theology or God did this and God did that a man it was all past tense a man anyway they were they were moving into that realm in a all of their lives a man that what God had done really they couldn't identify where God is doing because to them it was back then no no what he started back then he was continuing and the thing of it is to identify with it and become a part of it you have to walk in the spirit a man praise the Lord see Wesley he was walking in the spirit that started in the days of Luther a man because again as they've expressed it at ly I trust will understand it a man they Wesley came to the revelation of sanctification a man as Luther came to the revelation of justification well and where did Luther Wesley get his revelation it was in a cottage meeting a man where they were where they were praising God for what he did sue Martin Luther a van is now a wasn't John Wesley at the time but John Wesley was there a man because John Wesley was hungry and thirsty for sanctification amen and where though there were for justification God gave it to Luther and God was bringing Wesley into a position where he would receive the revelation that he needed a man for the generation that he was going to minister to and hear any and after he received it he would preach five times a day amen but not five times a day there's dude there's many today they would they don't even want to have five services a week they wouldn't want to get into the place where they won't even have a service a week a man is going to get to that place mother sister and as the part of God sent in you you you will go there and you'll go there looking for God a man to talk to the Lord oh yeah that's good good when it comes to worship and all these things are going to get less and less and less and as say many a believer is going to going to come under under a denominational spirit a man then I could be rejoicing in this rejoicing that because it's all going to be past tense and as well as Luther and his message was past tense and Wesley and his message with past tense the Pentecostals and their messages past tense amen certainly not what's going on today of the Pentecostal church it's not what's going on today in the Methodist or the Lutheran Church hey man and brother what God did in bringing out bringing out the message believers in this our brother what God was doing 50 years ago or 40 years ago or 30 years ago that's not going on in messy churches today because as all the others organized fall and what God did just became this became past tense nothing was in the present tense so it's the same now regardless whether be on our guard a man as brothers and sisters of like precious faith be on our guard concerning what we believe because only what God has done and because only what God is doing in us with us through us amen brother beyond regardless ruthlessly become a past tense amen and then again to many it is past tense God did to this God did do that oh yeah willing ran away morning 1909 a man who anyway when he was this age you know the here's the pillar fire and the voice of God in in a tree and then as he got to get up to an older age in 1933 the oh yeah the the pillar of fire came down pitched and and they did this they did this they did that it's all past tense the first pull the second pull past tense amen but brother the third pole is to be prison tense amen it is not to become a past tense the third pole is to be the present tense amen brother the popular continuity and he that God is going to do this god is doing this God is doing that and he knew he said he wanted to be in the resurrection he wanted to be in the rapture and he said if God wanted him to go before it struck and he said I'll go he said I'll be satisfied ain't man and he knew that I was coming when God was going to take him off the scene because as he said to leave ale and he said even the older generation in William branham's day he said they're going to be taken off the scene because they they will not believe that that faith of the Resurrection they will be able to have that faith of the rapture and so on no no so he said that's what God is going to take them off the scene and God is going to raise up another generation that will believe the third pole another generation that will believe the revelation of the resurrection the revelation of the rapture another it will not be a past tense thing will be a present tense amen but yet so many believers are past since God did this God did this God did that and brother the fact that they're that many believers just feel the all they got to do is read a book or all they got to do is or listen to a tape a man yes past tense let's get into what God's doing let us let us get under the ministry they did that's done as ministry on what God is doing amen and again in the seals or they say it's the seals this this is this and so we all I've got to do is listen to the tapes no no they be listening to the tapes rather when the bride is gone that's exactly the truth I said and I said this here bad back in 1985 in brother of the fortress Church a man I said listen I say when I said when the bride is gone they were still here i sir preaching Malachi 4 the bride is gone to be silly or preaching the goddess and a prophet when the bride is gone to be still here approaching oh the said the mystery of God is shreddies the mystery of God is revealed hey yeah I said whether brighter be gone because she entered and became one with the mystery of God one with the revelation of the mystery of God she identified with it not now and not just William Branham but she identified with Christ a man praise the name of the Lord for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout amen now William Branham it was the Lord and again it was the ace of the man revealing these from a man and he said gets your problem he said I am NOT the son of man he said I am a son a man revealing this on a man and he said you know your problem he said he said you can't see the other angel a man that was revealing the son of man to the bride that he had come down for the bride yes but he had come down what to bring to a conclusion is unity with a bright and he is union with the bride is marriage with a bright and then we're going to a marriage supper Amen see the bride all the way down through the ages my brother when you come to a conclusion of it ain't man and the brightest finished a bride is concluded well what's the next the next thing is the marriage supper praise the name of the Lord but too many are looking for God to do this got to do it God do that no brother God's done it amen the bride of the regular have United the bride and the bridegroom is one a man and he has come down to give us that faith he has come down to give us that revelation so brother I saw that and we're not going to look in the past we're going to we're gonna identify what God is doing what Jesus is doing in the present a man oh I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we have that revelation of God is pieces with us here is she's an innocent Caesars in you amen it's Jesus Jesus controlling your thoughts it's good Jesus controlling your actions and reactions amen so again it is not you that lives and not the bride that's living this Christ living in the bride amen this is brother this was a tremendous revelation and I tell you if we got the revelation what God is I'll tell you one thing you're going to be humble that's right you're going to humble yourself to under that revelation just to think God a God has done this but God is doing their Lord you mean to tell me you have come down a man and you are here and you are uniting with me you're bringing me into a relationship with you as of a marriage the bride and the bridegroom a man and you're getting me and my brothers and sisters ready for the marriage supper Lord nor elbows to see it the way you want us to see it and elders to hear it the way you want us to hear it amen brother I trailerthis aware we just go back to tapes and we go back to just even to the intellectual knowledge of the books we're not seen it the way God wants us to see it we're not hearing the way God wants us to hear it a man because brother anyway if we do brother word go were gone beyond the tape because why God has spoken on the tapes what God did in the ministry with a Branham brother he is made flesh in you and me a man that the bride is because is the Word of God in this our made flesh a man old God did this in will in Wrentham God did this in the old me of the seals yellow what's he doing now is in the revelation of the bright a man he did that in the poverty did he did that in this this ministry that ministry that anointing the Malachi for anointing hey man but now what's he doing now now he's making it flesh in the bride praise the Lord hallelujah tripping ER back there thinking God is doing this God is doing that yeah but but he's going to do it in you he's got to make it flesh in you amen why God had promised seen or 60 or 70 or 80 or hundred years ago God made flesh in William Branham a man brother sister thee oh yeah they they recognized his ministry but they didn't recognize his message a man oh there they recognize Jesus ministry but they didn't recognize his message they recognized the promise ministries but they didn't recognize their message amen and God has always done this amen to get their attention to the message they get their attention to his word God did this God did that hey man praise the name of the Lord the way God was doing it Noah during an Abraham that what God was doing to the prophets hey man it was together attention to the message that God was going to give through his servants amen the message was to give them the faith the revelation of God amen so that they God would reveal and let them know who is covering they let them know what he is God let them know where he is a man a man and he was calling on them to humble themselves calling on them to repent call him then to enter into a oneness with him amen all the way down through God revealing himself a man so that he would bring out what's in his seed he would bring out what is in his sons and daughters and again they would love him for himself a man and that we are here because we love God we are we are testifying or what we believe because we love God amen we would and live the lives we live because we love God amen considering what he did for us we want to do this for him a man and brother not the least we want to go on and on and do as much as we can whatever we can Lord give me the grace in order to do this for you considering what you did for me there's no comparison Lord but I want to do it amen I want to serve you I want to show my love for you because of what you've done now Lord let Daddy let that come out of me amen and I'm gonna die to my own ideas I'm gonna die to my own leadership my own thoughts I want your thoughts I want your leadership Amen Lord what do you want me to do father what do you want me to say a man Yeah right exactly you're gonna be late sons and daughters of God and led by the Spirit of God amen so that you'll know when God wants you to do this you know when God wants you to say that you know when God wants you to you know that had reveal this reflect this whatever and again it's like when we were in fellowship with somebody yesterday and and oh yeah and they were at some things their news things on the television and they were highlighting concerning their the meteor meters I guess or whatever they come meteors in in space there that are heading towards the Earth and they were saying oh yeah it's going to come down to the earth and destroy the earth and and the place where we were there was these grandparents but there was also a couple of grandchildren and there was an eleven-year-old girl there and a grandchild and she saw that and she was serious she said destroy the earth she said what are they going to destroy the earth for she was very serious but I didn't say anything at the time I said lord I start waiting on you I still let you let me know what to say and when to say it and I said for the time being I'll leave that with her grandmother and her grandfather because they know a man because they know what what we stood for Tinley knew what we believed by by the but the atmosphere was was absolutely quiet a man maybe they saw their brother drove was going to say this but the truth was going to say that and explained what God is doing but I didn't but I've been I was thinking that yeah Lord then you're there you're going to destroy the heaven of the earth why because in the Bible you promised a new heaven and a new earth amen and the Prophet said and knew in what ways is the same thing the same way that you and I become new we are new creatures in Christ by being born again a man so he said NNN he said God changes our nature from the inside out so isn't the same thing he said with the earth and he said because God is going to get a new heaven and a new earth and he said like we're born again the heaven and the earth is gonna be born again amen and he said God is gonna throw it into the end of the Sun Amen brother I tell you this science is beginning to see well you know what Natan Nature has taken a tumble got signs we begin to see anything can happen now to the earth and again as that are there that's great they're one of the greatest scientists in in this this century he's not the greatest Einstein was the greatest but this other follow that yo they reverence for ever sign Stein he respected Einstein but before is going before he was taken off the earth did this other scientist and he warned the scientists he said make the make Mars livable he said because it's coming to a place he said we won't be allowed and won't be able to live on the earth Amen brother they there they're seen they're seen in the natural way you and I are seen in the spiritual there in the natural and this was happening this was happening that's happening in the natural but brother we believe what God has done in the spiritual and it is a sign that God is about to create a new heaven and a new earth a man the bride is finished the the the health of the Omega is finished when it comes to God's God's plan of redemption Lord brother from Genesis to Revelation we have come to the end amen praise the name of the Lord and going God if God is taking us off the earth brave will praise the Lord hallelujah amen brother why is God doing this why is God doing that we're brothers see what the prophecies are concerning the the the the old heaven and the Old Earth because of what is God going to do to the two there to the ER but it got going to do the to heaven a man because why because the devil is there up there and then his seed is down there so brother to wipe the whole thing out God has got to got to create a new heaven and a new earth amen brother the seat of God was owner was under the under the anointing of Satan hey man beginning with with even the Garden of Eden hey man he do the tree of knowledge of good and evil a man from not just in the Garden of Eden but right on down through what are known through under finally of course now his tree of knowledge of good and evil again a man that the devil is getting getting the this seat actually need oh they eat off of that tree amen but the seat of God is eating up the tree of life amen brother that's the promise that God give in the church agents okay and he said because you did this because you do that I will give you the right to eat of the tree of life amen neither knowledge of good and evil that we don't need brother all we need is the knowledge of good all we need is to learn what's right that's not trying to get into what's wrong that's go there anything that's going to go to weaken your faith and I treated the dead man say that's where the devil was doing the he she had faith but the devil wanted to weaken her faith after he said I'll tell you this I'll tell you this do this do this and you will be like gods amen knowing good and evil brother there's things we need to know thing we don't need to know a man supposedly let's find out what we need to know let's learn what we need to know let's get an understanding I mean what we need to know amen brother concerning what God has promised and God did this God did this now God God like I said destroyed it the the heavens because that's where the devil and his angels when when they descended from the highest heaven and they came down to this hamon and who influenced those on the earth and so on so God is going to God he got to old brother/sister he's going to take it back to what it was in the beginning no sin a man there's going to be a new heaven and a new earth and again to remind you of the Prophet said it's going to be borned again like you and I are born again and we are we are new creatures in grace brother where we got we got the thoughts of Christ we got the attitude of Christ we got the motor from the ejection of Christ we think like him we act like him we talk like him we walk like him amen in the spirit praise the name of the Lord even the world one recognizes but God will recognize us amen God is going to know who you are amen because of the nature that you have a man and it's learning not just on Sunday not just as I said you know morning noon and night I will just say the Grace and so on it's gonna be 24 hours a man it's going to be Christ in you it's gonna be the word in you 24 hours amen and when God it wasn't what's he doing he's bringing to a conclusion all all these Saints her brother we're not looking for that not looking for that not looking for that we're looking for the end will be with the resurrection we're looking for the rapture we're looking with a new heaven and the new earth ain't I and praise the name of the Lord God help us that we have that we have the revelation as we ought to have the revelation and we got the revelation as we ought to have it it's going to be in control amen it's going to be in control this weather is what's going to govern you thought word and deed amen old brother sisters just think of what they did and how they did under their Pentecost and in the first church age when the anointing of the holy God just saying again our brother George broadened out you know concerning the the one that persecuted the church says the one God chose and predestinated as early as the messenger of that first age a man Paul and a lot of messengers and out of their believers were oh my they were shocked to think oh we I listen to Paul he killed he killed the believers he killed this when he killed him he was watching over this one even the first martyr so on a man by Yeti was God's chosen vessel this is amazing brother sister we gotta leave it with God hey man not my will they meet our Lord hey man yes in the old we think over gave these guys I got to do this God is good yes jisuk god is good all right he says God's the judge yeah he's a good judge prophet brought that out he said people want to preach old God is good god is good god is good you know what it what they're thinking human goodness intellectual goodness what is the goodness of righteousness he said whether prophecy God is good but not in the eyes of man because he said he's a judge he's not he doesn't goody she's not gonna let this go on let that go let that go no no he's gonna take his stand against this against this and against that oh but Lord you're good so you won't judge me for this woman if it's contrary to my word II well it's worthy well yeah a man so brother let's get when it comes to goodness let's see goodness is God's season Amen this understand goodness says God understands it amen Oh what I want the goodness of God we're good you're if you got the goodness of God you're born again amen and if you're born again amen you're living a different kind of a life amen amen amen and brother you ain't in the eyes of the world you might not seem good a night why because you're gonna push you gonna stay with the truth you're gonna take your stand against not the people but against that what what Satan is doing through them you take your stand against this against this against that no no oh you you're not ashamed boy and you can't help if you're born again you you can't help it it's your nature you don't have oh well I got to do this no you don't you do it not that you got to do it you will do it because it's your nature just like in the natural we got it we got to be on our guard in the natural because we might glue it and do things and act act like mom and dad or grandma and grandpa yeah no no we want to we want God to take control of that so I'm going to go out and act like Jesus MA I'm gonna glutton act like God I'm gonna go ahead and talk like God amen I'm gonna go ahead and walk like God by the grace of God amen for the images on what God is putting the emphasis on amen Lord it's not mine Willis your will whatever you want me to do I'll do a lot no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna let the devil you know you know tempt me buddy oh why you you should you should judge it now see if if this is the will of God it'll be good for you good in what way if he's a will of God it'll be good for us because we're in the will of God we may not think we're in the run of God oh the Lord if this is your will you know I would experience this I would feel this I would feel that no no no if it's the will of God it's gonna be country to the census of the flesh it was the will of God it's in contra contrary to your human reasoning yeah you gotta cast down reasoning oh yeah cast down those things to believe the will of God again O Lord as he got himself showed it God Himself reveal it when he when he was in Gethsemane oh he pray knowing what was going to happen no he was gonna he prayed I prayed and prayed that maybe maybe even God would think of another way maybe even God would do it another way but no as he prayed and prayed and prayed no doubt he was the word so they knew the word so he had to stay with the word unto finally he cried and he sweat as a great word great drops of blood just to this believers today don't sweat water little own blood oh yeah not what comes to the burden of the word not when it comes to the burden of bearing a witness of the truth I'm not gonna sweat like Jesus did god help us rather then will he sweaters were great drops of blood and he said not my will time be done I'll tell you this because he had that anointing here that way with him in the flesh angel came and ministered to him there was a manger there to strengthen him to encourage you a man just think no doubt the angel knew this was God in flesh and the problem was the flesh brother it wasn't God even with the flesh in control he would have changed it but he didn't change it thank God hey man we're here because he said not my will then be done that's why we're here amen that's why that Luther did what he did Wesleyan and on down through the pentecostal now into the bride age a man and brother we're not going to experience it like the Pentecostals experience it sense of like the Pentecostals experience it or Luther or Wesley oh yeah because they added in their souls but they also experience it in their flesh and they they had feelings off beaming the anointing they felt the anointing as I said you can feel the anointing in your soul and brother what I felt in my soul one time I felt all around if I went outside it was still there it was there if I went to meet this brothers and sisters it was the anointing was there oh yeah and that's why the anointing was with you that's why yet then he even when you work with unbelievers back years ago even they recognize there was something different you created an atmosphere and it was newest t99 you Amen you create an atmosphere in school you create an atmosphere no matter where it is that where you're working and so on Amen because the anointing is on you and you're in the spirit hey man don't get out of the spirit because you're because you're gonna go to school don't get out of the spirit because you're gonna go to work don't get a despair because you're going to visit this one or that one when you stay with the spirit the anointing a man and I'll tell your brother if there's any spiritual in any way they'll recognize it and respect it they will so brother we got to do it because that's what God wants us to do not my will die and be done amen brother he said works is faith testimony and they said when they see you acting like you're healed then they'll know you got faith that you are healed amen works is faith expressed so what works are you doing what works are you manifesting is it not not just good works are going to church is what you're doing every day how you doing it when you do it where you do it and so on that's the works that God is looking at that's the works that God is influencing because it's not you living these cry is God living in you so brother has God in you is God doing this is God doing that because intellectually the devil oh you should do this because that'll be better for you no God honors you do sometimes why god what what God wants to do might in our mind might seem worse for us but at least it's going to improve our relationship with him amen so what why it's good is God testing our faith oh yeah God teste our faith I'll bring out a quote in a moment I I think and I saw my team I received from brother Matthew a brother Karsan but as a quote of the Prophet and it's in again I thank God for bringing us back to this message I have heard but now I see there's a reason for it because there's things in it that I didn't I liked and as I did in the last message here and there's another issue right here that this this is like a quote from her brother Isaac and and it's from the message right here or I have heard but now I see concerning what God does and how God does it before the test our faith amen gotta put you through the test to test your faith Carlo this Saturday they had to heaven what for to test your faith a man and brother it seemed like us or that's not so good but that's the prophet brought oh dear it was good for them that God was testing he didn't come out so good for those that he told about they are wells why because they they were selfish they want to do this they want to do that God wanted to do a certain way but they want to do it their way they want to make a big business out of it God no I just want them to do it so that they be blessed but God gave it to somebody else because their motive and their objective was wrong amen again this way and I brought it out and now and I think it was good he taught me those that were dead look looking for healing and he said why do you want to be healed what is your motor what's your objective many like I said they're there heal and go to hell but if your motor is right what what is your motive for the glory of God give God preeminence give God the glory not just so you can go to one I'm healed now so I can go do this I go to that know that God be glorified oh brother sister but the Prophet is bringing out concerning faith and works and orders so much he said work is testimony when they see you acting like you're healed they know you got faith that you are healed and he said if you're intellectuals always said here's a stinger if you're intellectuals does tell you that this is the truth God is the healer of sickness your mind go witness that that is the truth but if there is not the betting ground in your heart faint to fall him to express it will not happen they that's got to fall into the betting ground in your heart Amen now he said you remember he said you're in a cycle of three and he said you're one person and he said like Father Son and Holy Ghost he said cycle of three but he said one person and it said three attributes of the same God he said fatherhood and so on and he said three officers like him fatherhood sonship and Olli goes and he said you were a cycle of three as well and he said you our body spirit and soul amen if we're born again we'll focus on the soul not the body if you're not born again you're gonna focus more and more on your body and the natural life but not the spiritual and if you're born again you love the Lord and you love the family of God amen if you're born again and anything you want is fellowship amen by the grace of God oh yeah it's like I said that's not like it is now because there's the anointing the uniting the brighter 90 is less and less and less and one time we did where as I told my brother Billy Paul when I met him and he's all god bless you brother for what you've done as a brother I said all my life I said we have lived for this message I said we didn't live I said so we could do this and do this do they naturally I said we live to do what we could do for the Lord I said we we really we wanted waiting for this time so I could go down fellowship with this one waiting for that time so I'm going I fellowship with over whether it's the the the Saints in gamble the Saints in st. John's or let's say John's was the same thing in Fisher Falls the Saints that I western Newfoundland I said well all that's all we wanted to do and I said the believers live for that they were constantly on the go constantly undergo for one from one cottage to another from one group to another one group to another why cuz that's all they wanted and they talked about the Lord to talk with the word worship them praise the Lord I said but now I said there's very little of it they're too caught up with the natural world not the spiritual yeah brother it shows the lack of the new birth oh yeah that's why the father of God was experiencing his day when he said I got no friends why one time he it was always there but I was getting to the place where it was fewer a fewer of pure getting less right now we're living in that hour because people are more caught up with the natural things of life in the future we had in the in the early church who started this while ago he's an early church oh they went from house to house to house amen breaking the bread and doing this and fellowshipping and worshiping praise the Lord Alleluia oh yeah but the the bridal had that anointing but not all believers but the bride will and it controls the right brother what cycle is covered governing you father son Holy Ghost or is it the body the spirit or the soul and most are controlled by their body and the census of the body he said the outside body has five inlets to it to contact your earthly home see taste feel smell hear and he said the inside which is a spirit has five senses he said conscience love and so forth but inside of that the soul as one thing and he said that's where you live is in your soul and what is the sense of the soul faith the soul is only governed by faith it controls you by faith you're going by faith the revelation of the will of God for your life amen what is God's will for your life not my real father thine be done amen and brother the census of the soul of the Spirit rather is imagination conscience memory reason affection but we got to go beyond that to faith and sometimes faith is going to be is going to be contrary to all the senses contrary to the senses or instincts of your spirit and contrary to the instincts of your flesh brother faith is going to line us up with the Word of God the will of God amen perfect faith so he said the foal has one thing and he said that's where you live and it is faith and he said the spirit can come out and not you to do certain things and you do it but that don't mean you're saved he's to think of it k ephesus prophesied judas cast out devils and the spirit anointed him and there's rain falls on the just and the unjust and the weeds can rejoice with the wheat but it's what it is at the core amen brother you go there you wonder what's in your garden well water it give it some soil it's the fertilizer yeah and then and let them get the sunshine it's not enough just the water it's got to have sunshine hallelujah and the Sun will go down and warm it and warm it and warming and and break the seed and the cedar come forth amen oh who planted that the weeds well this disc we're hoping all the seeds go to bring forth grass no someone's gonna bring four weeds and I turn to this brother the ministry got a lot of mowing to do to get rid of the weeds because I tell you there's a lot of weeds yeah you can water it and it come up water come off water come up grass to come to but so will the weeds oh yeah just think what what what it gonna make the the grass come forth it's gonna make the good the weeds come forth oh yeah definitely a man and they're gonna be there like the prophet of God warned us there's always three kinds of believers amen so brother sis I trust were believers in our hearts in our souls by the grace of God amen borned again and we're not going by feeling now we're going by faith so that's why back van there was fate but it but the atmosphere you would feel this you would feel this annoy me feel that annoy sense it you know around you everywhere but now that's gone so the bride is going by faith not by feelings a man but if you got it in your soul regardless feelings or no feets you're still gonna live same life you're still gonna stand this for this is for the same thing that you stood for when you first came to this work oh yeah you're gonna have the same zeal same enthusiasm and it's really it's going to increase you get more and more why because you know by faith you know hallelujah you've known by faith that you're getting closer to the resurrection and the rapture hey and you're gonna hunger and thirst for it I'll call for it oh my you you got that that thirst on the inside the rain falls on the just and the unjust and that they both come for come for come for but brother whatever the seed is inside that's what's going to come outside hey man grace of God and he said the weeds can rejoice with the wheat I trust 101 or weeds there make your call Dean election sure make sure your grass not weed hey man well how do i how do I make sure that make sure well what are you manifesting what are you revealing how are you acting how do you talk how do you think a man so brothers brothers and sister amen so let's hope we're not going to the hack think and talk like weeds hey man this make sure we're going to active think and talk like grass and grass is very simple it's very basic he meant and sometimes God said gotta use the mower a man to keep us on the right level by grace a man and we got to go round sometime with a I've got I've got one in my home there and it's a weed dealer there's you hold on you push it down twist it and pull the weed up not just the weed itself but the root that's what you want to get is the root I just plucked the weed and throw it out because it's gonna grow again cuz the roots are still there and it's not gonna change it's still gonna be a weed whatever the seed is in you that's what you're gonna manifest amen they always the engrafted seed of the word of God praise the Lord and it's bringing forth the sons and daughters of God and the Bride of Christ amen so knowing this oh yeah why is this seed there why is that see there because God planned it but the devil came behind in planted weeds oh yeah there's lots of weeds Oh that'll help us to better understand our life better understand the walk we're in a man the message were identified with when you look right on your we look out your window on your grass now you'll think about that now where am i over there I trust that I'm not one of those weeds I'm trust I trusted I'm the rich grass that's coming up hallelujah praise the name of the Lord he said the weeds can rejoice with the wheat but it's what it is at the core he said there's where you can intellectuals can accept and say oh sure that looks good I believe that that still don't do it and the Spirit can actually he said make witness of it and still it isn't so because if that soul hasn't come from God it can make all the impersonations out here but it cannot be real trusting by grace that we are the seed of God amen he says you can Act evening you can act like you have you can act like you have received it Christians can act like they are Christians and act and be ever so good at it but that don't mean they're saved he said that's actually right the Spirit can be there the real genuine spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you and that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside soul that never dies he said it's got eternal life it always was eternal he said life it come from God it goes to God it's your soul that's the part that God is working on it's the soul a man so when you go out and you live this life you act this life you've got this testimony of this witness and so on what brother and again it's not you it's God in your soul he's in control amen oh brother sister let's hear it the way God wants us to hear it let's see it the way God wants us to see it and let's have the right motive and the right objective as I said I think of a brother Matthew our latest on scripture there concerning the rich young ruler his motive was right his objective was wrong he didn't want he didn't want to have to pay the price that God Jesus told him he had to pay he didn't want do that he felt you know well god bless me God will do this and God do that yeah but he had to be in the will of God you got to have a right motor and a right objective he had the yeah the emphasis on himself amen but Jesus wanted to put the emphasis on the Lord give preeminence to the Lord in your life so it's not you it's God why does this brother this sister do this why do they act this way why do they talk like that why are they doing this well it's the Lord it's not the way human beings wouldn't intellectually do this in lecture did that no but brother you're not controlled by the end of like you're controlled by the soul the spirit the Holy Spirit you consider the way that God has ladies set his sons and daughters down through the ages Old Testament read consider and today believers st. oh if we got God God what we want to have to endure that we wanted to experience that oh yes brother I'll tell you this if you go what we want joy hallelujah we want to we want to love the Lord won't be guden and enjoy this and enjoy it yeah well if you got the Holy Ghost you enjoyed in here yeah it's like that like that woman where they said if you don't repent recant we're gonna kill your daughter well she said kill her she said I'll meet her in glory yeah any man she was rejoicing she was praising the Lord and again like I told you about the man that they were stretching and stretching the stretching to wait until he would break apart man they looked at him and he wasn't crying he was just happy oh my wasn't he happy oh yeah and people think today that God is gonna make me happy God's gonna God is gonna make make this good and this Gooden and in here Oh everything will be for my favor no it's the grace of God not the grace of the devil another grace of man and so on or they think of this I'll be good no that's not a brother or that the brother I lighted that in this quote right here from the message I have heard but now I see we go conclusion ah I'll give you that I'll share that quote with it Amen so God give us the faith so we're being led by the spirit not being led by the flesh amen led by the Holy Ghost not being led by the human nature you got a man by the grace of Almighty God brothers sister god help us again as I said go through and you see what God what God does how God does it but yet it gives joy to the believer oh yeah they joy and rejoice that their that the Lord count them worthy that they would suffer for his name's sake thank you Jesus it's joy unspeakable and full of glory like I said we think joy and good and not happy is when we we think everything is there to please the flesh no no what brings us happiness only goes happiness is what pleases the soul amen during right what you're in right standing with God that's why you're happy amen you all may not look and see this good app and this good happen in your in your physical being but they don't make it ever so long as long as I mean in the will of God praise the Lord O God help us to have a right mind Alvis have a right spirit Alfa's to have revelation Holy Ghost revelation Amen not natural the spiritual praise the Lord he said there's where your can intellectuals can accept and say oh sure that's good I believe that that still don't do it and the spirit actually make witness of it and it still isn't so because if that soul hasn't come from God it can make all the impersonations out here but it cannot be real you can act healing you can act like you have and act like you receive it Christians can act like they are Christians and act and be ever so good at it but that don't mean you're they're saved the spirit can be there the real genuine spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside soul that never dies it's got eternal life it's always was eternal life and it comes from God it goes to God it's the soul amen but see when it's direct directed from the inside it throws all the rest of it together and he said that's the guidepost that's the control tower the inside of the inside the soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body amen grace of God amen he said if your faith doesn't produce works with it you can't make anyone believe that you're healed amen God have mercy on us he said all be rugged Christians he said like we should be and if we were man and women you take God at His Word you can't do it on til it's revealed to you amen you take God at His Word you don't stay here at the promise of God through unbelief but you give praise to God and know that it's got to happen I don't care what the doctor says everything else will come in all kind of a way but don't you believe it it's a lie of the devil heesu faith goes about to get with works to create the promise a man the promise of God and I know this is of God because this another scripture point to this hour revelation 10 and he said in that in the hour of the seventh angels message when he begins to sound forth his message not in a healing service but the message that follows the healing service amen what follows the healing service the faith of the Resurrection and the rapture we're getting out of that signs and wonders for the natural man into the spiritual the natural wants healing that's that's why that they put so much emphasis on Billy Oral Roberts rather his ministry signs and wonders and healing and the public God did put the emphasis on the first two signs they men remember the angel said you'll do this you do this but he said get the people to believe that was to get their attention now get them to believe the revealed word amen and even Oral Roberts came to brother Branham and he said brother Branham he said you've got to stop preaching those things that you preach yeah and he said just just use your sign just go pray for the sick and brother Branham said brother he said he said where the graham said leave it Billy Graham but or Robert she said leave it with the leader with the pastors and the ministry and he said well he said brother what if the ministry is not preaching he says somebody gotta preach it so he's talking about a preacher and that's eating around the message now to preaching doctrine and theology but really not preaching what God requires of the bride for the resurrection and the rapture well yeah it's a lining out remember the last as I mentioned on Wednesday the last vision the prophet of God was screaming to the bride the last message to the bride my stay in line that was his last message to the right because he saw some of them getting out of life and many a believers gotten out of line grace to us and he said when that meant angel that seven angels message when he begins to sound for these message not in a healing service but the message that follows the healing service amen to get us to believe the word amen and that's what Jesus did in his ministry signs and wonders and then he given the word and they turned down the word amen the accuse them of being a false prophet but he said you're fewer you're false he said just think what Jesus said nearing the end of his ministry how hard it gets he said you are of your father the devil what area is talking to the ministry and they had this Jews religious Jews and so on you're of your father the devil what amazing that's what it comes down to that's what everything is is as come down when it's coming down to more and more you're under either under God's influence or the devil's influence grace to us amen we need third pull faith and that's the faith that doesn't question God just believes God regardless he said I can't make you believe neither can you make yourself believe God has got to give it to you it's a gift of God to believe not your faith God's faith your intellectual faith might believe it fine but unless the faith of God is in is down in your heart your intellectual faith can accept to do that and just keep believing it with all your heart under God does reveal it to you just keep believing it until God reveals it amen keep believing the resurrection rapture till God makes it a reality in our lives and in the invisible union of the breath of the church the bride to Christ that messenger is here now which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever a lot of people think is William Brennan no it's Jesus William Graham didn't do that Jesus did it it was Christ revealing himself a man price praise the name of the Lord thank God for the revelation of Christ brother if we see Christ in the reveal word we're hearing it the way God wants to stare at see it the way God wants us to see it and I'll turn to this it'll produce the right mode of an objective in our lives that we're not living for ourselves we're not living just for to show off to the others we're living for the Lord to give preeminence to Jesus by the grace of God amen Oh we'll have to get back to great motor of an objective maybe on Wednesday and try to finish it amen in the message doing God a service without his will the God says were in the end time the Lord bless you richly he said I get started and he said we're going to fade pretty quickly into eternity amen well that's what's going on now the right is fading into eternity that's why we don't feel the anointing like they used to out there in the atmosphere and around everywhere because the anointing was on the Pentecostals everywhere 90 was maybe in Luther West they stay on the Methodists everywhere and you could sense that anointing it was it was all over the world and the anointing of the prophets of Malachi for the anointing was all of the world but now it's gone now it's just in the bright Amen so we said we're going to fade pretty quickly into eternity he said notice the scripture that says in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of man but it says they worship Me this makes sure we're not worshipping God in vain amen as God blessed us into going forth of the song service and the an you worshiped and you praise the Lord praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus let's make sure it is not in vain amen he said God sovereign and he said we see here what David done in the scripture reading of 1st chronicles 13 and his intentions were good but God does not give us mirrors on good intentions he said there's only one way to serve God and that's why doing his will at his command and God being sovereign there's no one to tell him what to do or how to do it he does it his way he knows the right way to do it and that makes me feel good and it ought to make all of us feel good he said for one would have it coming in this way and one would have it going that way and one the other way but one great thing again about God has not left us now without knowing what's the truth and how to do it it says God knows what's best God knows when to do it and God knows outer to it we have our ideas but he knows is a man it's his idea not ours that's what we got to allow to govern us and he said old brother listen what time are we living in what's the age what's the hour that we are in it's not time for it for these things that they are talking about these are less passed and he said judgment is on end right now and he says you can see it breaking and you remember the rock upon the mountain judgment hour you remember the revelation of the vision of the bride just keep her in step don't better get out of step we're living in the judgment hour that's why we pray grace to family friends and neighbors because the Prophet said as long as the bride is here there's grace so it's you representing the grace of God and we're looking for what we're looking for that last predestinated seat or as william branham said some years ago in that if that last seed were to come in either tonight he said he said it might have been in Florida or some might be up in Washington he said he said we'll go on preaching and he said Derby nobody saved he's the last one is he in he still be nobody saved and he said we'll go on preaching and he said for a period of time until that that last one in he said comes to maturity to recognize God recognize his word and maybe were here waiting for seed of God here these these our young sisters and our young brothers waiting for them to come to maturity this relief pitcher elected seed your predestinated see and God's waiting for you to come to the maturity to believe God believe his word recognized it accepted Amen and live it and he said we could go on preaching he said they could go on preaching for two hundred years he said there won't be another one saved amazing brother it doesn't surprise me considering the hour were living thank God for the young people in this church even as I said before visiting ministers I think that that sort of shocks them when they look and they see our Zhong sisters here worshiping their hands raised and then and and the children in the church today and one brother said brother well you don't see too many churches like this I said good nice - thank the Lord I said that we haven't by grace of God a man and of course he was shocked a - and when one brother was here and he noticed one of our young brothers was up there helping brother Matthew that was brother Adam son Daniel Daniel yeah and so on amazing that that's on earth I mean most of most churches yeah so thank God for the anointing please keep pleading the token for one another and keep pleading the token for the children for your sons your daughters yes or for the for your grandchildren yes God God's expecting you to do that see in your hands is in your hands a man the grace of God brother I try to bring it to a conclusion yes there's five mas I want you to enter these no matter how sincere a man may be in doing it doing God a service he said they said these five mus must be there if you ever do God a service not without his will if you're gonna do it with his will there's five months it must be his time to do it amen it must be according to his word that has been spoken so make sure it's God's time whatever you do wherever you feel led to do make sure it's God's time make sure it's according to the word that's been ministered and preached and he said it must be given according to the person he has chosen to give it by don't see that and it must come first to his prophets so what we're preaching did come first two prophets a man and the Prophet must be a vindicated by the word he men and he was it wasn't just the Ministry of a man it was the Ministry of God in the Prophet amen he said we are in the last days were standing near the judgment and we're trying to eat an old man of the fill back yonder fifty years ago the Pentecostal church the Holiness Church is trying over 200 years ago the Lutheran's about three or more hundred years ago and he said there eat trying to eat old manner but no we need to come into the Holy of Holies to get the fresh manna of the revealed word hallelujah how if Jesus did anything you know what he did he took the veil down when he did when he laid down his life God ripped the veil in the temple that was between the holy place and the holy of holies that shocked the priesthood what because they weren't allowed in there only the high priest would go in once a year and he had to have a rope on him and he had to have chimes on his leg there so when he would he would walk and do make a certain sound and if anything happened they would add the drag amount why because in there was the Ark of the Covenant and was to angels and the purifier in between those angels a man and then they were see there was the in manner right there yeah that they had put in there and and and the high priest could take a bit of that in mana and eat it he had never got never got bad or anything not in there the presence of God brother and how God has brought us into the Holy of Holies praise the Lord so that we can eat the hidden manna of the revealed word this is tremendous this is a whole scriptural this is exactly according to the Bible according to the Word of God a man thank God for the Holy of Holies and brother in the Holy of Holies we become one with the pillar fire one with Christ praise the Lord they don't have to worry about dragging us out he's gonna drag us in and he's going to take us into into the resurrection into the rapture praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so we're standing near the judgment we're trying to eat old manna that fell back yonder 50 years ago the Pentecostal church the Holiness Church was people trying to eat hidden manna at home and I hidden manna old manna that well basic message doctrines and theology and teaching from 50 years ago or even 40 years ago we need to get into the revelation now brother what God did God is making flesh in the bright house not gone when Brad was gone goddess Taylor Jesus still there he's in his bride it lets go forth as Jesus a man he says find out if David if any of the rest of them would only consulted the bread of the hour if the priests and prophets and preachers and theologians and schools and denominations would have only consulted the hour and but now it won't do them no good it done moved out it won't help a bit and if she's gone now she's crossed that line about five years ago between repentance judgment and mercy five years ago that would have been 1960 you know 1960 she crossed the line between mercy and judgment brother God's grace to us well I believe churches have crossed the line governments across the line and that's why that we're in the our judgment and we see the fire falling that's why they're talking about the meters from outer space they're coming to strike the earth we're getting to the place where there's gonna be a new heaven and a new earth please let's be let's be ready for it let's be on our guard let's be ready for it let's love the Lord anything God looking for in this hour he's looking for you to love him he is again that's like Peter I said Paul look look I knew God chose to be the messenger Paul and now they'll go he chose two big preach the first message on the day of Pentecost Peter he had more trouble with Peter than yet he knew with the rest we know we know that we're not even told any there any issues that he had with Judas it's very very little until he went to betray him but and any of the other disciples well with Peter Peter was always questioning this questioning that what about this what about that what did you do this what would you do that and to finally when he come back he said yes why he asked him three times lovest thou me more than these they men until he talked to talk to the finally concluded with divine law that's what he was looking for in Peter Peter added and human love but he was looking for divine law so when he came back and from the resurrection and he went to Peter and they fellowship and talked he brought out of Peter divine law a man it's amazing just consider those whom God uses I'll tell you this it's not what we choose not what you would choose but I tell you find out who God chooses yeah-oh him/her no yeah be careful except that people care could be the one God is using to bless you to help you to encourage you to teach you yeah amazing you type of God hidden and God revealed in simplicity we want to make it this person this person that person no God said moved that one side take this one what yeah I want Peter yeah he knew Peter's heart god help us any new Paul's heart Oh Paul he's cruel he's killed Oh many many believers he's killed and so on and he was on his way to kill more when God called him God stepped on the scene a man a man a man brother I'll tend to this you talk about we are sinners saved by grace Paul that was real to Paul I believe it was real to Peter he said watch the vision the other night exactly the same bride comes this side come to this side after that prostitutes pass with their own gowns and little old things just this way dancing Roy rock and roll calling themselves the church and you say well we don't do that that's the way God sees you it ain't what you see you're your own self it's the way God sees you no man sees himself wrong so how do you see yourself in all circumstances situations please if there's anything you do or don't do don't ever consider yourself to be better than anybody else you know they're sinners saved by grace you're a sinner saved by grace yes concluded all under sin that he may have mercy on all why so they'd all had the same attitude in the same spirit that's right oh I didn't do this I didn't do that no but you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking like well I'm going to you what do you think you're so good there's none righteous no not one it's only Jesus and it's our by our faith he appears his righteousness to us let's give the glory to God he says not the years in preparation but it's when he begins to sound the message these mysteries will be revealed well God has done that it's revealed down and God's looking for the manifestation and what he has done he's looking for the manifestation in the bright by the grace of God grace he said the word evening message must-carry evening results the evening message must sow evening seeds not morning seed evening seed it is evening results and he said the beginning message showed the beginning result made creation he made his son in his own image in the midday and in the evening time he makes a bride for the son he said he makes the bride by his word amen he said don't never start or try an organization don't try to build up anything but stay humble before the Lord your God for it looks like the gates may open on to the promised land soon and then let us go in with true singing and rejoicing when the bride and the groom takes its place at the throne live humble and he said loving love one another don't never get nothing among you if you see something come up in your heart against somebody he said get it out right then and Satan will do his best to get among you don't you let that happen some slick dumb fellow may come along and try to take you away from it and he said you think they could talk Moses out of the presence of God where he stood there and seen it no sir no we don't take from from it or add to it just keep it the way the Lord said it and he said we don't want no denomination we don't want an organization we don't want no malice we don't want no strife we want God and II is the word a man he said look with a spiritual high he said don't do you done what you said look Lord far be it from us trying to make it any littler or to try to make it any bigger just keep it the way that it is you made it just walk humble and follow you and my and Lord may our hearts continually be set on thee we know Lord that money prosperity property things of the world have no meanings just so temporal all of them must go our jobs our places our friends everything must go no matter how rich or poor a popular a lone popular with that we are it all must go but there's only one thing that our be near is centered around and that is Jesus Christ he said so God let us lay aside everything that secondarily and hold to him he is the word is the vindicated word of the hour well it's a question as he got near the end of his message yeah he knew he was dealing with a congregation that was caught up with the natural things of life oh I gotta do this I gotta do that and he said how he said have you forgotten about dinner oh it's dinner time no he said have you forgotten about dinner he wanted them to forget dinner focus on the Lord he said have you forgotten whether the kids are all right out in the car or not have you forgotten all about the past and realized what that is your feeling right now it's materializing before you day and night and let that be the center he's Alette the rest of the things go away he said they're going to perish anyhow and he said just keep following him as Elijah followed Elijah let's follow him for we must be taken up to some day we see the chariot of fire that lifted him out of the grief we feel it now among us and some day he's going to be going to on hook and the horses from the brushes we are going hop amen well it was the AUSA's chariot and horses of theophanies that coddle Idaho well it's gonna be theophanies that's gonna catch the brighter the alpha niece of the saints that are gone on and your theophany might theophany that's waiting for us in that dimension amen again I'll finish with this scripture we read it before hey man the old I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed a man in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump amazing for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed brother were into the faith and revelation of the resurrection and the rapture what's going on right now brother the resurrection is going on now the rapture is going on now brother because we've heard the last Trump it has sounded and the dead of Christ are being raised incorruptible and then we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality amen the quote that I said I was going to give you and it's from the message I have heard but now I see and his quote one 11111 and he said now we find that in the those hours of real stress I might have he under stress but he's sitting in those hours of real stress he said that's usually when the Spirit of God moves him amen and he let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace before he ever moved a hand they didn't see him until they got there so in our situations circumstances we don't see him we don't sense his presence with us until we're right in the midst of distress oh yeah we're right in there if we think all of God's with me you won't let me go through that but he does to bring up your faith this stress this test so on to bring out your faith and through the three blue children they we're gonna eat it seven times hotter weather that's fine we're still not going to do this we're not gonna do that and they they hated it so much that when those that threw the children in they died for the truth is amazing that the children that didn't feel it the heat struck them so hard that the soldiers died but the cerebral children just when Arnie did throw them into the furnace they didn't feel no heat and the finally they looked around and here was God he was the fourth corn and he was he was walking around with them yeah and the King said all he's I heard you through three and he said I see four down there walking Amen when we're in when we're in stress when we're going through a hard time and rough times how many does the devil see just you or you and God just you are you and Jesus Amen well he said he let the Hebrew children walk right on into the fiery furnace before he ever moved a hand but he said listen when he moved he moves when God moves he moves he's there amen so what God moves into in your life he moves a man so sometimes it's not in terms when everything's going well we thought go go good good good good you know sometimes when things are seeming the bad bad bad all his hard hard hurt but Jesus is there to encourage you they see Jesus was there to help you a man Jesus there to give you relief going through this trial going for this test but I'm relieved praise them or spiritually because Jesus is here with me and I know these won't take me through it by the grace of God no matter what the test is no matter what you're experiencing Christ is there with you I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you amen so god help us again to keep our motors rate and our objectives right when we come here to church you keep your motive right your objective right when you go out a man trusting by grace you've earned it the way God wants you
