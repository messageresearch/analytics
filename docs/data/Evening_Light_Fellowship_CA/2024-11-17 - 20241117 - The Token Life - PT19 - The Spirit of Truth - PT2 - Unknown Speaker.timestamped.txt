[38:53] you and shall be in you amen God bless
[38:55] you you can have your seats again this
[38:56] evening we're continuing this series on
[38:58] the Holy Ghost and we start on Wednesday
[39:00] night with this thought on the spirit of
[39:04] Truth some issues with the clicker
[39:06] brother Matt you can work with me here
[39:08] even the spirit of Truth uh so we're
[39:10] going to take a a second uh service on
[39:12] this idea of the spirit of Truth and I
[39:14] want to take this in quite a different
[39:15] angle from last time because we know
[39:18] that we showed last service that the
[39:19] holy spirit will always point a person
[39:22] back to the word of God Amen you know
[39:24] you're being led by the spirit because
[39:26] it points you back to the word remember
[39:28] what scripture says Jesus said Thy word
[39:31] is truth so if you have the spirit of
[39:32] Truth it will point you back to the word
[39:34] that is truth amen so we know that the
[39:36] truth is always linked to the spirit
[39:38] because the holy spirit is what makes
[39:40] the word live it's what makes truth come
[39:42] to reality in our lives it's the life
[39:44] it's the power it's the strength of the
[39:46] word of God Amen it's all one and the
[39:48] same thing so when somebody says I feel
[39:50] led to do something I L feel led to do
[39:53] such and such or go so you know this
[39:55] place or that place and they're
[39:56] professing Christian what they're trying
[39:57] to say is I believe that the holy spirit
[40:00] is leading me that's what they're saying
[40:02] when they say that amen but we don't
[40:04] blindly accept those words we ought not
[40:07] to amen we ought not to do when somebody
[40:09] says I feel led to do something I we
[40:11] don't we don't say I don't believe that
[40:12] you're not lad but the question we have
[40:14] to ask is are you led by the Holy Spirit
[40:17] and how do we do that we go back to the
[40:19] word of God Amen we take what they say
[40:22] and we compare it to the word of God and
[40:23] it doesn't matter how great their
[40:24] Ministry is how much they've been right
[40:26] in the past how great their life has
[40:28] been to this point we always take
[40:30] leadership back to the word of God
[40:32] because that is always the absolute amen
[40:35] so when somebody says I feel led to do
[40:36] such and such we take it back to the
[40:38] word of God to see if they are being led
[40:40] of God or not amen doesn't matter how
[40:41] much we love that person how much we
[40:43] respect them how much we appreciate them
[40:45] we always take it back to the word of
[40:46] God why because the word of God is the
[40:49] discerner that's the discerner of these
[40:50] different things amen if I can stay with
[40:52] the word of God I always have
[40:54] discernment because the word discerns so
[40:56] I don't have to do it if I can stay with
[40:58] the revealed word of God it cuts through
[41:00] the religion it cuts through the
[41:01] spirituality it cuts through the emotion
[41:03] it cuts through the respect it cuts
[41:05] through the image all of these different
[41:06] things and it brings us down to Solid
[41:08] Ground that's what the word does amen I
[41:11] don't have to know your motives and
[41:12] objectives if I know what the word of
[41:13] God says I don't have to know your
[41:15] character if I know what the word of God
[41:16] says I can take what you're saying and
[41:18] what you're doing and compare it to the
[41:20] word of God and that will tell me where
[41:22] you're at in this decision remember what
[41:24] Paul said in the book of Hebrews he says
[41:26] for the word of God is quick that word
[41:29] means alive amen this isn't a dead word
[41:32] that we believe this morning it's living
[41:34] amen and it's living by the spirit of
[41:35] God Amen for the word of God is alive
[41:38] and powerful and sharper than any
[41:40] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[41:42] dividing the sun of Soul and Spirit and
[41:45] of the joints and Marrow and it says the
[41:47] word is a discerner of the thoughts and
[41:50] intents of the heart so I don't have to
[41:53] judge the people that say and do certain
[41:55] things I'm not judging judging the
[41:57] person but I can judge the action by the
[42:00] word amen we judge the action we don't
[42:03] judge the person they may be
[42:05] fooled they may be intentionally
[42:07] ignoring something amen they may not
[42:09] even have the Holy
[42:10] Ghost we don't know what we don't know
[42:14] am me so many times I mean we can look
[42:15] around uh the body of Christ and we can
[42:18] see people that we absolutely believe
[42:20] 100% that they had the Holy Ghost and
[42:22] yet they walked away
[42:23] eventually Paul says it Deus has
[42:26] forsaken me he he did Ministry with Deus
[42:29] and this one did it because he loved
[42:30] this present world and that one and
[42:32] these and listen Paul had the Holy Ghost
[42:34] and he still worked with these men and
[42:36] in the end they fell away amen but we
[42:39] don't go around judging people amen but
[42:41] what we do is we stay with the word and
[42:43] then the word discerns the situation
[42:45] amen somebody can do the wrong thing for
[42:48] the right reason and we go around and if
[42:51] we start judging that person then we
[42:53] missed the mark because if they are
[42:56] sincere even their wrongness and they're
[42:58] a child of God what will God do God will
[43:01] bring the word to that person and he'll
[43:04] give them the opportunity to see that
[43:06] what they did was wrong and then what
[43:08] happens is if they're a child of God
[43:10] they'll see their error they'll repent
[43:14] they'll change their mind about what
[43:15] they were doing and they'll line up with
[43:17] the word and then the word then has
[43:18] discerned the thoughts and intents it
[43:20] proves that their intention was to do
[43:24] good anyone ever been there we think
[43:27] we've done the right thing and then the
[43:29] word comes along and we say oh I got I
[43:33] got mixed up so if he can do it to me he
[43:34] can do it to you if he can do it to you
[43:37] he can do it to me amen but what happens
[43:39] is when the True Believer sees the word
[43:41] in front of him they humble themselves
[43:44] to the word no matter how much it hurts
[43:46] how much It embarrasses how much it
[43:48] lowers them and they humble themselves
[43:50] to the word and then the word has
[43:51] discerned that they are a True Believer
[43:54] even in their Disobedience they're a
[43:55] True Believer because as soon as they
[43:56] caught the error by the word they go and
[43:58] they humble themselves to it and you see
[44:00] two different groups in this you see
[44:02] Cain remember Cain gave a a a a
[44:05] sacrifice to God outside the garden and
[44:08] Abel gave his sacrifice and God honored
[44:11] it and Cain gave to the best of his
[44:13] knowledge the best of his Revelation the
[44:15] best of his understanding and he gave
[44:17] the best of what he had and God rejected
[44:20] it and remember what God Said to Cain
[44:23] God came down God had a conversation
[44:25] with Cain and he said Cain if you do
[44:28] what Abel did I'll accept you and what
[44:32] did Cain say I'm not interested Cain
[44:35] knew the right and he didn't do it and
[44:39] that's when the word is a
[44:41] discerner amen now you see David on the
[44:43] other hand David the Ark of the Covenant
[44:45] remember I it's not in Jerusalem where
[44:48] he wants it to be and the first time he
[44:50] goes to move it he puts it on an ox cart
[44:53] he doesn't check with the word and then
[44:55] as it's going along the road The Oxen
[44:57] stumble cuz the road is is rough and the
[45:01] Ark starts to slide and oza puts his
[45:04] hand out to steady the ark and God
[45:06] strikes him
[45:08] dead and David was angry that God did
[45:11] that he thought God was unfair but
[45:14] remember what the word said the word
[45:16] said the ark can only be carried by the
[45:19] priests so he neglected to look at the
[45:22] word the word corrected his error and so
[45:24] they left the ark where it was at the at
[45:27] a at a man's house and then months later
[45:29] what did David do he checked the word
[45:32] and the word said the priests have to
[45:34] carry it and so all of a sudden now he
[45:36] takes that and he puts it on the
[45:37] shoulders of the priests and nothing
[45:38] happens see he humbled himself to the
[45:41] word his good intentions cost Aza his
[45:44] life but when he came face to face with
[45:47] the word he humbled himself and he said
[45:49] I'm wrong the word is right and he
[45:51] followed the word from that point on you
[45:53] know I was talking to someone recently
[45:54] and I said we put far too much time into
[45:57] trying to put intentions on people when
[45:59] many times they are simply
[46:02] ignorant the I I I I find this is
[46:05] something that we do too many times I
[46:07] put myself in this group sometimes we
[46:09] put so much effort into saying why
[46:12] somebody's doing it and we have no clue
[46:16] how can we how can we we can't read
[46:18] minds we don't know what's going on in
[46:20] their life and too many times to my own
[46:22] embarrassment I've come on the other
[46:24] side of that situation and I've realized
[46:26] how far off the market I was see we
[46:28] don't have to judge the intentions we
[46:30] can judge the actions by the word and
[46:32] leave it at that and God will discern
[46:34] the hearts amen that's up for him to to
[46:36] to look at amen I am a child of God and
[46:39] you're a child of God and if we are in
[46:41] error God is Duty bound if we're sincere
[46:44] to show us the right amen that's what
[46:47] God's going to do he'll show us the
[46:48] right and he will absolutely teach us
[46:50] and correct us now I we referenced this
[46:52] scripture last service we didn't read it
[46:54] but I want to read it just to close out
[46:55] this little mini thought the morning
[46:57] because I want to remind us as we turn
[46:59] the corner today Jesus said this he says
[47:01] the comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[47:03] whom the father would send in my name he
[47:05] shall do what
[47:08] teach teach you all things and bring all
[47:12] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[47:15] have said unto you one of the purposes
[47:17] of the holy spirit is to teach us what
[47:19] we need in this life amen that means if
[47:22] we need to be taught that we don't know
[47:25] it all from the start we absolutely do
[47:28] not and I don't care how old you are
[47:30] this morning from Brother Gerald back
[47:31] there to 75 years old to Samuel this
[47:33] morning at four years old or Michael or
[47:35] these young ones we don't know it all
[47:38] and we always have to be led we have to
[47:40] be taught amen that means we're ignorant
[47:42] to start students know don't know
[47:44] everything that's why they have a
[47:46] teacher that knows everything they need
[47:47] to know amen the holy spirit is the
[47:50] teacher and so as we go through life
[47:52] we'll find that sometimes others are
[47:54] ahead of us in class you you know
[47:57] there's some people that are really good
[47:58] at math and they might be a a year
[48:00] behind you but they're way ahead of you
[48:01] in their
[48:03] understanding but there's other people
[48:05] are really good in in science or grammar
[48:07] or writing or or arts and these
[48:09] different things and they're being
[48:10] taught but they have an affinity for it
[48:12] and so they can go faster than other
[48:15] people so we can walk through this life
[48:17] and and maybe you would have a situation
[48:19] in life and you deal with it differently
[48:21] than I would because you're further
[48:24] ahead than I am and I haven't caught up
[48:27] but then we have some keeners amongst us
[48:28] that are just so gung-ho for the for the
[48:30] Gospel of Jesus Christ and they
[48:32] accelerate fast and there's young people
[48:34] maybe that act more appropriate than I
[48:36] do at times in certain
[48:37] circumstances God's dealing with them as
[48:40] individuals and he can grow them and
[48:41] mature them at the pace that he wants to
[48:43] amen but the simple fact is we're all on
[48:46] this path together listen some of you
[48:48] are more mature than I am in some areas
[48:50] and some of them I'm more mature than
[48:51] you even if you're older than me and
[48:53] even if you're younger than me we have a
[48:56] a full spe of Christianity of maturity
[48:58] of growth of strengths here that's what
[49:01] this is all about it's a body some of
[49:03] you are going to be stronger than others
[49:05] in certain areas regardless of age
[49:07] regardless of your background how long
[49:08] you've been serving the lord but we're
[49:10] all learning we're all growing and so
[49:12] it's important we don't assign
[49:14] intentions to people just because they
[49:16] may not be where we are because
[49:18] sometimes that's all it is is they're
[49:19] just not where we are we don't know what
[49:21] we don't know you know I'm facing all
[49:23] sorts of situations these days I've
[49:24] never dealt with and guess what I can't
[49:27] sit there and go by a hunch I've got to
[49:29] go in prayer before God I've got to dig
[49:31] into the word of God to see what it says
[49:33] about how to handle these situations now
[49:36] some things I've learned by watching
[49:37] other men and and sometimes even women
[49:39] in certain circumstances on how to
[49:41] handle things and see God use people in
[49:43] those things but in the end I've got to
[49:45] be growing day by day and I've got to be
[49:47] maturing and God's got to be dealing
[49:48] with me to move through situations and
[49:50] guess what sometimes I make mistakes
[49:52] it's just the it's just the nature of
[49:54] the business amen that when we're put
[49:55] into tough situ ation sometimes we don't
[49:57] get it exactly right but we've got to
[50:00] take it back to the word of God cuz
[50:01] that's what will correct us that's what
[50:03] will teach us that's what will grow us
[50:05] when the Holy Spirit comes down and he
[50:07] quickens it amen that's for free this
[50:09] morning amen now we're going to turn a
[50:11] corner on the spirit of truth because so
[50:13] often we look at truth today if somebody
[50:15] said what is truth we look at it as
[50:16] facts or data or information something
[50:19] that's unbiased but truth is more than
[50:21] that because truth is is Purity it's
[50:23] it's absolute it's right it's perfect
[50:27] amen and it has a very specific per per
[50:29] uh purpose for the Christian amen
[50:31] there's a reason why we run to the word
[50:33] of God even when it doesn't always feel
[50:34] good for us Paul said or Jesus said this
[50:37] in John 8 he says as he spoke these
[50:39] words many believed on him Jesus had
[50:42] many great uh sermons in his ministry
[50:46] but watch what he says here he says then
[50:47] said Jesus to those Jews which believed
[50:49] on him if ye do what
[50:54] continue if you continue in my my word
[50:57] then are you my disciples
[50:59] indeed notice it's not who starts that
[51:02] matters it's those that continue all the
[51:05] way to the end that are truly children
[51:07] of God remember what Paul said in the
[51:09] New Testament he says you ran well you
[51:12] were doing so good what did hinder you
[51:14] what stopped you from moving on what
[51:16] stopped you from continuing so often we
[51:19] can sit here and say well I've got a
[51:21] great start I've received the message of
[51:23] this hour I've been baptized in the name
[51:25] of Jesus Christ I've repented of my sins
[51:27] I received the Holy Ghost yes and what
[51:29] have you done since then amen we're
[51:31] supposed to be continuing in the word of
[51:34] God remember the parable of the sewer
[51:36] shows there's a lot of people receive
[51:37] the word but only an elect group goes
[51:41] all the way through to produce the word
[51:43] at the end there's many that receive it
[51:45] with joy there's many that that
[51:48] cultivate it for a while but there's
[51:49] only one group that goes all the way
[51:51] through and produces it and we we see
[51:54] even in the scriptures that Jesus starts
[51:55] with 80 two disciples he picks the 12
[51:59] and then there's 70 that join themselves
[52:01] to him so he's got 82 and then he
[52:03] preaches a hard sermon and the 70 leave
[52:06] him and then Judas leaves on the on the
[52:09] on the night of the Passover so he's
[52:11] left with 11 out of
[52:13] 82 why those were the only ones that
[52:15] continued in the
[52:17] word but watch what he says if you
[52:19] continue he says if you continue in my
[52:21] word you shall know the truth and the
[52:24] truth shall make you free
[52:27] now we look back in the law of Moses
[52:28] that people got in trouble at times and
[52:30] they got into a place where they were
[52:32] bound uh into slavery they were Bound by
[52:34] debts and they lost their land their
[52:36] homes their money their inheritance
[52:37] whatever it was and when they got into
[52:39] those troubles they would commit
[52:40] themselves to serving somebody as a
[52:43] slave and that was to pay off their
[52:45] debts or just have somebody to take care
[52:47] of them for until a certain time but
[52:49] there was an event remember every 50
[52:51] years called The Year of Jubilee and on
[52:54] the Year of Jubilee on that particular
[52:56] particular day at a particular time they
[52:58] would blow a trumpet and as soon as the
[53:01] trumpet was blown every Israelite slave
[53:04] could walk home they could lay down they
[53:06] could their their tools they could walk
[53:08] away from whatever they were doing
[53:11] didn't matter how much their their
[53:12] Master had told them this has to be done
[53:14] today if they didn't get it done it
[53:16] didn't matter because as soon as that
[53:18] trumpet blew they were free to go home
[53:20] they could go home to their family they
[53:22] could go home to their house they could
[53:23] go home to their land their entire
[53:25] inheritance that they got under Joshua
[53:28] could come back to them if they heard
[53:31] the trumpet and responded to it amen it
[53:33] was a reset of the debts of the nation
[53:36] But realize this if they didn't know
[53:38] what the trumpet meant they couldn't go
[53:40] free if that trumpet blew and they said
[53:43] huh I wonder what that's all about and
[53:45] then just went back to hoing guess what
[53:47] they couldn't go free they had to know
[53:50] what the trumpet meant in order for them
[53:52] to be set free amen there was a truth
[53:54] there was a word behind the actions of
[53:56] of that trumpet blower and if they
[53:58] understood what was going on then they
[54:00] could go Free Church do you know why
[54:03] it's so important that we show this
[54:05] world that we don't live the way they do
[54:08] it's to let them know a trumpet's being
[54:09] blown in the land amen you Brothers when
[54:12] you walk away when somebody says do you
[54:14] want to drink we are at a hockey game on
[54:16] on Friday playing hockey that is and the
[54:19] guy said hey there's a cool over there
[54:20] take a beer I said no thanks not
[54:22] interested what am I telling him in my
[54:24] own little way I'm saying a trumpet's
[54:26] been blown you sisters that don't cut
[54:29] your hair that don't wear clothes that
[54:30] pertain to a man what are you saying

[54:40] turn your ears away from the dirty jokes
[54:42] and the filthy conversations your your
[54:44] your co-workers your friends have a
[54:46] witness that a trumpet has been blown in
[54:48] the land and you don't have to be bound
[54:50] by those things amen that's what's going
[54:53] on you're you've been set free and
[54:55] you're saying you have to be there
[54:57] either people say how can you go through
[54:59] life without a drink people live for the

[55:44] free Jesus said he that heareth my word
[55:47] and believeth on him that sent me has
[55:48] everlasting life and shall not come come
[55:51] into condemnation but passed from Death
[55:53] to life he says because he's believed on
[55:56] the Son of God you have to believe it
[55:58] you have to act on it but that slave on
[56:00] that day day or that Year of Jubilee if
[56:02] they refuse to hear the trumpet or if
[56:05] they refused to respond to it what did
[56:07] they do they took him to the
[56:10] doorpost now you got to realize what was
[56:12] on the doorpost
[56:15] before blood the doorpost was Where
[56:18] Mercy
[56:19] was but if you refus to take the mercy
[56:22] if you refused to take the freedom they
[56:25] took you to that place it became a
[56:26] judgment post and they put his ear up
[56:29] against it and they took an all and they
[56:31] just went and they put a hole through
[56:33] his ear and that man could that person
[56:36] could never go free again he couldn't
[56:40] change his mind he had made his choice
[56:42] he turned down Liberty he turned down
[56:44] the trumpet and because of that he had
[56:46] to stay a slave the rest of his life
[56:49] it's the same thing today if you won't
[56:50] hear the gospel you'll stay as slave and
[56:53] it's by choice it's not God's choice
[56:54] it's your choice cuz you refus to heed
[56:56] the trumpet it's a scary thing when we
[56:58] turn down the word it's a scary thing
[57:00] when we turn down the word brother BR
[57:01] says this he says when a man turns down
[57:04] the gospel truth Satan marks him at his
[57:07] ear he deafens him so he can't hear the
[57:09] truth no more and he's finished God have
[57:13] mercy he says he stays with the group
[57:16] that he's with if he won't hear the
[57:18] truth continues in the message Watchman
[57:21] we the night he says you know it's never
[57:23] popular to tell the truth amongst people
[57:25] who want to live live for this present
[57:29] day what it's about the here and now
[57:31] it's about what feels good it's about
[57:33] what makes sense for me today and it's
[57:35] never looking to the Future listen we
[57:38] get 70 years A Little More by reason of
[57:42] strength after that there's a whole lot
[57:44] more waiting for us potentially and we
[57:47] can live this life for the next one or
[57:48] we can live it for this
[57:50] one and if we live it for this present
[57:52] day people aren't going to be very happy
[57:54] with the word of God he says they don't
[57:57] want to believe the truth but the Bible
[57:58] says you shall know the truth I'm so
[58:00] glad of that you shall know the truth
[58:02] and the truth shall make you free he
[58:04] says now you can be a truth rejecting
[58:07] what prisoner you can be a truth
[58:10] rejecting prisoner or you can know the
[58:13] truth and be free when you hear the
[58:16] gospel you've heard good news that's
[58:17] what gospel means it means good news but
[58:20] if you won't hear the good news all
[58:22] that's left is bad news by definition if
[58:25] you won't hear hear the good news all
[58:26] you got left is bad news amen no one
[58:29] wants to hear bad
[58:30] news ever walk up to somebody say I've
[58:33] got good news and bad news what do you
[58:34] want to hear they say I want to hear the
[58:35] good
[58:37] news but we'll find out as we go through
[58:40] this today we'll see that sometimes the
[58:42] bad news for us is making way for the
[58:46] good news for us sometimes we got to
[58:48] know the bad news before we can know the
[58:49] good news that's really what the gospel
[58:52] does to us now listen to this again
[58:54] we're going to continue in John 8 and
[58:55] remember remember Jesus is not speaking
[58:57] to
[58:59] unbelievers we can as we read the
[59:01] scriptures so many times we can say well
[59:03] he's talking to people that aren't
[59:04] children of God but they're professing
[59:06] Christians if we could put it that way
[59:08] they're professing Believers these are
[59:09] churchgoers these are people that read
[59:11] their Bible these are people that pray
[59:12] these are people that have committed
[59:14] their life to the word of God and watch
[59:16] what Jesus says to them these are
[59:18] faithful people to their religion says
[59:21] they answered him and said cuz remember
[59:23] he say uh if you'll hear the truth of
[59:26] the truth will set you free they
[59:27] answered him said we be Abraham's seed
[59:29] and were never in bondage to any man how
[59:32] sayest thou ye shall be made free they
[59:34] said we're already free what do you mean
[59:36] we're going to be set
[59:38] free Jesus answered them verily verily I
[59:40] say unto you who soever committes sin is
[59:44] the servant of sin he says this isn't a
[59:47] natural bondage this is a spiritual
[59:49] bondage and the servant abideth not in
[59:51] the house forever but the son abideth
[59:54] forever if the son therefore shall make
[59:57] you free ye shall be free indeed I
[59:59] preached on this when I was at brother
[1:00:00] Ed hammermeister back in September I may
[1:00:03] preach on it here a little bit later at
[1:00:04] least in portion but I highly recommend
[1:00:07] not because I'm recommending my
[1:00:08] preaching but because it'll give you
[1:00:09] context if you want to go back and
[1:00:11] listen to it I called it from victims to
[1:00:14] Victors and it'll give you some context
[1:00:16] for this scripture amen but the one
[1:00:18] thing I want you to catch out of this is
[1:00:19] when god Set You Free you're really free
[1:00:22] that word indeed means really and truly
[1:00:25] so when God set you free when God gives
[1:00:27] you Liberty you don't have to put it on
[1:00:29] when you go out the door you don't have
[1:00:30] to wrap yourself in a cloak of it when
[1:00:32] you go out you don't have to have this
[1:00:33] facade it's not a shame it's a work
[1:00:36] that's done it's finished it's complete
[1:00:38] amen God's not a god of halfway Works
[1:00:41] God is a god of a perfect finished work
[1:00:43] in The Believer amen so it's not
[1:00:46] something we've got to pretend about if
[1:00:47] God sets you free then you are free
[1:00:50] indeed amen I can testify to that of
[1:00:52] things that I desire before I got the
[1:00:54] Holy Ghost now I don't desire them I
[1:00:57] don't I don't think about them I don't
[1:00:58] crave them I don't look for them I don't
[1:01:00] feed on them why cuz God is a god of a
[1:01:03] complete work listen what the scripture
[1:01:05] says in Deuteronomy he says he is the
[1:01:09] rock am I the rock are you the
[1:01:13] rock no he's the
[1:01:15] rock his work
[1:01:19] is
[1:01:21] mediocre pretty good really good no his
[1:01:26] work is
[1:01:28] perfect for all his ways are judgment he
[1:01:32] says a god of Truth and without iniquity
[1:01:36] just and right is he listen he says he's
[1:01:39] a god of Truth notice how that ties into
[1:01:41] his perfect work because what the truth
[1:01:44] is perfect it's absolute it's righteous
[1:01:47] it's pure it's clean so we see this
[1:01:49] truth and this Perfection go together
[1:01:51] truth is part of the character of God
[1:01:53] it's the attribute of God all that God
[1:01:55] does Is Anchored in truth it's anchored
[1:01:58] in his word which is why it stands a
[1:01:59] test of time but I want you to catch
[1:02:02] this this thought I jumped ahead I gave
[1:02:04] it
[1:02:06] away because we have our up days and we
[1:02:08] have our down days don't
[1:02:11] we three of us five of us and
[1:02:16] Samuel we have our up days and we have
[1:02:18] our down days sometimes we think we're
[1:02:20] in and some days we think we're out
[1:02:21] sometimes we we we
[1:02:23] just this may not make sense
[1:02:26] to the sisters perhaps but there's some
[1:02:29] days when you're playing sports and you
[1:02:31] just can't miss it's like brother Bob
[1:02:33] and corn hole some days it just keeps
[1:02:36] going in the
[1:02:37] hole and you're 10t tall and bulletproof
[1:02:40] in your Christian walk you're just every
[1:02:43] response is right you're full of love
[1:02:44] and peace and joy and nothing gets you
[1:02:47] off you're just walking through life and
[1:02:49] you're like I've got this I am a child
[1:02:52] of God and in some days you just want to
[1:02:55] to go over into your favorite recliner
[1:02:58] and pull your feet up and stick your
[1:03:00] thumb in your mouth and just say
[1:03:02] somebody please help
[1:03:04] me don't we have days like that where
[1:03:06] you just don't feel like facing the
[1:03:08] trial you don't feel like facing the
[1:03:10] enemy you're sick and tired of being
[1:03:12] sick and
[1:03:14] tired but remember we're looking at his
[1:03:16] work not at our work amen so if we take
[1:03:19] this sort of thing remember that God
[1:03:21] doesn't make mistakes God doesn't make
[1:03:25] mistakes amen God doesn't have children
[1:03:27] that are worthless God doesn't have
[1:03:29] children that can't do anything amen the
[1:03:31] scripture says his work is perfect can
[1:03:34] you say Amen to his work is perfect his
[1:03:36] work is perfect if that is true then
[1:03:39] let's read the next
[1:03:41] scripture it says for
[1:03:45] oh
[1:03:47] we you just said amen to his work is
[1:03:50] perfect he says for we are his
[1:03:54] workmanship
[1:03:55] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:04:00] which God had before ordained that we
[1:04:03] should walk in them when you think
[1:04:05] you're not up to the task when you think
[1:04:06] you're not strong enough when you think
[1:04:08] you're not good enough when you think
[1:04:09] you're not smart enough when you think
[1:04:11] you don't have this and that and the
[1:04:12] other when you think the gift isn't
[1:04:14] there then take Deuteronomy 32:4 and
[1:04:17] blend it with Ephesians 2:10 and what
[1:04:19] you come out with is I can do all things
[1:04:22] through Christ which strengthens me why
[1:04:24] cuz we are his workmanship I didn't
[1:04:26] build this up I didn't make this I
[1:04:28] didn't set this behind a Pulpit I didn't
[1:04:31] save myself I've said before I wanted to
[1:04:33] go my own
[1:04:34] way but we are his perfect
[1:04:38] workmanship the thing is we're in a
[1:04:40] period of time remember on the days of
[1:04:43] creation God said on the first day it
[1:04:45] was good and God saw that it was good on
[1:04:48] the second day Third Day fourth day but
[1:04:49] when he gets to the end is when he says
[1:04:51] it's very good we're work in progress
[1:04:54] amen sister you're a good work sister
[1:04:58] Rebecca you're a good work sister Selena
[1:05:00] you're a good work sister Justine you're
[1:05:01] a good work brother Mark you're a very
[1:05:04] good
[1:05:06] work he's near the
[1:05:08] end but here's the thing God's going to
[1:05:11] get you to the point of his Perfection
[1:05:14] which means you are exactly what he saw
[1:05:16] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:05:18] world whatever that might be whatever
[1:05:22] that might be and if you are walking in
[1:05:24] his will if you're walking in his word
[1:05:26] you are perfect despite all that this
[1:05:29] flesh will try and throw up at you day
[1:05:30] by day amen we are his workmanship amen
[1:05:34] we are the creation of God we are the
[1:05:37] Perfection of his
[1:05:39] hands we are the manifestation of his
[1:05:44] truth that's what we are this morning
[1:05:46] amen he built you he formed you and he's
[1:05:49] teaching you and he's preparing you
[1:05:51] perfectly for the good works that he's
[1:05:54] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:05:56] world that you should do them
[1:05:59] amen Paul or Jesus said this he says
[1:06:02] these things have I spoken unto you in
[1:06:03] Proverbs remember he said before there
[1:06:05] are many things I can't tell you now but
[1:06:07] when the Holy Ghost comes I'll tell I'll
[1:06:08] speak through the Holy Ghost later he
[1:06:10] says but the time cometh when I shall no
[1:06:12] more speak unto you in Proverbs but I
[1:06:14] shall shown you plainly of the father so
[1:06:16] Jesus always hid his meanings but he
[1:06:18] says there's coming a time when the
[1:06:19] meanings won't be hidden I'll show you
[1:06:21] very plainly and at that day he says you
[1:06:23] shall ask in my name and I say not un to
[1:06:25] you that I will pray the father for you
[1:06:27] for the father himself loveth you
[1:06:29] because you have loved me and have
[1:06:30] believed that I came out from God I came
[1:06:33] forth from the father and I'm com into
[1:06:35] the world again I leave the world and go
[1:06:37] to the father now watch the disciples
[1:06:39] response the disciples said unto him Lo
[1:06:42] now speakest thou plainly and speakest
[1:06:45] no proverb they said very good now we
[1:06:47] are sure that thou knowest all things
[1:06:49] and needest not that any man should ask
[1:06:51] thee by this we believe that thou camest
[1:06:53] forth from God remember when he'd say
[1:06:55] something they didn't understand they
[1:06:56] started talking amongst each other what
[1:06:58] do you think he means what do you think
[1:06:59] he means hey will you go ask Jesus what
[1:07:01] he meant cuz they never understood it
[1:07:03] now they're saying we don't have to ask
[1:07:04] each other we know exactly what you're
[1:07:06] talking about and look at Jesus Jesus
[1:07:09] kind of claps back he says Jesus
[1:07:10] answered them do you now
[1:07:13] believe he's challenging their faith NOW
[1:07:16] Watch What Happens because remember the
[1:07:18] spirit of Truth has always been there
[1:07:20] with them cuz he said remember I am with
[1:07:23] you and I'll be with in you the Spirit
[1:07:25] of Truth was always there all along amen
[1:07:28] they've just said they believe they just
[1:07:30] said they understand and watch what the
[1:07:32] spirit of Truth says it says behold the
[1:07:34] hour cometh Y is now come that ye shall
[1:07:37] be scattered every man to his own and
[1:07:40] shall leave me alone and yet I'm not
[1:07:42] alone because the father's with me the
[1:07:44] spirit of truth always says what's true
[1:07:47] regardless of our feelings it is not
[1:07:50] bound by our feelings amen the spirit of
[1:07:53] Truth shows us things to come and here
[1:07:56] it is speaking already and Jesus says
[1:07:58] listen you think you believe but there's
[1:08:00] there's a Time coming very shortly where
[1:08:02] you're all going to leave
[1:08:04] me but he never leaves them without
[1:08:08] Comfort he says these things have I
[1:08:10] spoken unto you that in me you might
[1:08:13] have peace in the world you shall have
[1:08:15] tribulation but be of good cheer I have
[1:08:17] overcome the world Listen he says it's
[1:08:19] going to come and it's going to happen
[1:08:22] and you're going to fall but don't worry
[1:08:23] there's overcoming power coming behind
[1:08:26] amen you're going to have to go through
[1:08:27] this guys it's coming your way you're
[1:08:29] not where you think you are but don't
[1:08:31] worry I've got power coming that'll take
[1:08:33] you as far as you need to go I want you
[1:08:35] to see this morning the spirit of Truth
[1:08:37] can't
[1:08:37] bend it can't shape itself to what we
[1:08:40] want it can't compromise for the sake of
[1:08:43] our feelings our emotions our
[1:08:45] preferences or our understanding the
[1:08:47] spirit of Truth is unchanging amen truth
[1:08:49] can't be Blended or compromised
[1:08:51] otherwise it can't be truth amen it
[1:08:53] stands alone we can sit here all day
[1:08:55] long and say I want the Holy Spirit to
[1:08:57] have free reign in my life I want it to
[1:08:59] have full control amen but you have to
[1:09:01] see that when you happens that when that
[1:09:04] happens the truth is going to contradict
[1:09:06] where we
[1:09:07] are because it's trying to lead us into
[1:09:10] more and greater and better things so
[1:09:13] what we have is good but it's trying to
[1:09:14] take us further in our walk with God
[1:09:16] Amen many times that's not going to feel
[1:09:20] very uncomfortable why cuz I'm not an
[1:09:22] absolute and neither are you and we've
[1:09:24] got to be shaken off of what we think
[1:09:26] amen we're not the measuring stick we're
[1:09:29] not the the ultimate amen we are being
[1:09:31] led and taught by the Holy Spirit as I
[1:09:34] said earlier and that means we've got to
[1:09:36] rise rise from where we are rather than
[1:09:39] try and drag it down to where we are if
[1:09:42] we drag truth down to where we are it
[1:09:43] does us no good whatsoever amen that
[1:09:46] makes us the
[1:09:47] absolute David said this in Psalms he
[1:09:49] says Lead Me in thy truth whose truth
[1:09:52] thy truth and teach me
[1:09:56] he says for who is God Thou Art the god
[1:10:00] of my salvation on Thee I do do I wait
[1:10:03] all the Day psalm 40 says withhold not
[1:10:06] thy Tender Mercies from me oh Lord let
[1:10:08] thy loving kindness we all want loving
[1:10:10] kindness don't
[1:10:12] we we love the loving
[1:10:14] kindness and thy
[1:10:17] truth see you can't just take the loving
[1:10:19] kindness you can't take the warmth and
[1:10:21] the hugs and the the cuddly feelings of
[1:10:23] Christ without the truth
[1:10:26] truth he can't split himself like that
[1:10:29] that's not the way it works you got to
[1:10:31] get the whole package or none of the
[1:10:32] package so his loving kindness comes
[1:10:35] with truth and he says remember what
[1:10:37] David says here he says he says it's not
[1:10:39] thy loving kindness that preserves me
[1:10:41] it's your loving kindness and your truth
[1:10:44] because if you live by the word if you
[1:10:45] live within the lines that the word lays
[1:10:47] out you'll be kept safe because now
[1:10:50] you're hiding in him rather than in your
[1:10:53] own way amen he says th loving kindness
[1:10:56] and thy truth continually preserve me
[1:10:58] that means you got to stay in the truth
[1:11:00] to be continually preserved can't just
[1:11:02] have it for a day it's got to be an
[1:11:03] everyday walk amen those are beautiful
[1:11:06] scriptures and they ought to be our
[1:11:07] hearts cry every single day Lord lead me
[1:11:09] in thy loving kindness and thy truth cuz
[1:11:12] that's what's going to keep me safe amen
[1:11:14] but the test for that is when the Holy
[1:11:16] Spirit comes down through the word of
[1:11:17] God and we're found
[1:11:19] wanting and the question is what are we
[1:11:21] going to do with it then what are we
[1:11:22] going to do when we're found wanting
[1:11:24] amen when we're living than what he says
[1:11:26] and we're left with a choice do we
[1:11:27] humble ourselves to the spirit of Truth
[1:11:29] or do we create our own truth that
[1:11:32] allows us to stay where we are that's
[1:11:35] what so many people want today is they
[1:11:37] want to stay where they are but be
[1:11:39] comforted and you can't get that from
[1:11:40] Christ because his loving kindness comes
[1:11:42] with his truth his comfort comes with
[1:11:45] his
[1:11:45] truth remember we're speaking on the
[1:11:48] spirit of Truth this morning and Jesus
[1:11:49] was talking with his disciples and
[1:11:51] remember he had that conversation he
[1:11:52] says who who does who does the world say
[1:11:54] I am what does everybody think I am who
[1:11:55] do they think I am and they gave their
[1:11:57] answers and then and then he asked them
[1:11:59] the same thing and the scripture says he
[1:12:01] saith unto them but whom say ye that I
[1:12:03] am and Simon Peter answered and said
[1:12:06] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:12:08] Living God Peter gave the perfect answer
[1:12:11] the perfect answer and Jesus Remember
[1:12:13] the spirit of Truth speaking now
[1:12:15] answered and said unto him blessed art
[1:12:17] thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood
[1:12:20] had not revealed it unto thee but my
[1:12:21] Father which is in heaven and I say also
[1:12:24] unto thee that thou Peter and Upon This
[1:12:27] Rock I will build my church and the
[1:12:29] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[1:12:30] it Peter gives a perfect answer and the
[1:12:33] spirit of truth comes right behind and
[1:12:34] says that's right now notice he says I'm
[1:12:37] going to build my church on that not on
[1:12:40] Peter I'm going to build it on the
[1:12:42] revelation of Jesus Christ amen but
[1:12:46] watch how the spirit of Truth keeps
[1:12:48] rolling
[1:12:50] here he says I will give unto thee the
[1:12:53] Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and
[1:12:55] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[1:12:57] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:13:00] Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be
[1:13:01] loosed in heaven so the spirit of Truth
[1:13:03] is confirming Peter's Revelation Peter
[1:13:05] got a Heavenly Revelation a spiritual
[1:13:08] Revelation and he confirms that it's
[1:13:10] right and correct and I can imagine
[1:13:12] Peter was having his 10-ft tall and
[1:13:14] bulletproof moment Peter's like I've got
[1:13:16] it I've got it I know who he is and he's
[1:13:19] probably saying hallelujah praise the
[1:13:21] Lord what a meeting we would love to
[1:13:23] have a meeting like this wouldn't we
[1:13:25] where God's coming down he's saying booy
[1:13:27] you're just you're on it you know it you
[1:13:29] got it you got it you're right you're
[1:13:30] right you're right we'd love
[1:13:33] that says then charged he his disciples
[1:13:35] that he should tell no man that he was
[1:13:37] Jesus the Christ and from that time
[1:13:39] forth began Jesus to show unto his
[1:13:42] disciples how that he must go unto
[1:13:44] Jerusalem and suffer many things of the
[1:13:46] elders and chief priests and scribes and
[1:13:48] be killed and be raised again the third
[1:13:50] day so the meeting switches from an
[1:13:52] affirmation of Peter lining up with the
[1:13:54] word to now the what what is it the
[1:13:56] spirit of Truth is showing them things
[1:13:58] to
[1:13:59] come okay watch this same man watch what
[1:14:04] happens then Peter took him and began to
[1:14:07] rebuke him saying be it far from thee
[1:14:10] Lord this shall not be unto thee so
[1:14:14] Peter kind of comes over Jesus and he
[1:14:16] kind of just brings him over says no
[1:14:18] this isn't for you don't do
[1:14:20] this he's trying to correct the spirit
[1:14:22] of Truth watch what the spirit the truth
[1:14:26] says but he turned and said unto Peter
[1:14:29] get thee behind me
[1:14:31] Satan Thou Art an offense unto me for
[1:14:35] thou savest not the things that be of
[1:14:38] God but those that be of men and the
[1:14:40] Amplified says you are a stumbling block
[1:14:42] for me for you are not setting your mind
[1:14:45] on the things of God but on the things
[1:14:47] of man so Mr keys to the kingdom of God
[1:14:51] Peter went from being a blessed man that
[1:14:54] has a keys to the kingdom to being of
[1:14:57] Satan and offensive to
[1:15:02] God according to the spirit of
[1:15:05] Truth he goes from Mr inspirational Mr
[1:15:09] Revelation to stumbling block and carel
[1:15:13] like that and what does the spirit of
[1:15:15] Truth does do Spirit of Truth spoke to
[1:15:18] him in both those situations and the
[1:15:20] first it affirms him because he's with
[1:15:21] the word and the second one it what
[1:15:24] correct him because he's caught up in
[1:15:26] his flesh amen the spirit of truth will
[1:15:31] call us by the
[1:15:34] word he's not there to to Pat you on the
[1:15:37] shoulder and say good job all the
[1:15:39] time if you want to know how to raise
[1:15:41] your kids look at how the Holy Spirit
[1:15:43] works with the
[1:15:44] believer it is corrective in love it
[1:15:47] affirms when you do right and it
[1:15:49] corrects when you do wrong by the word
[1:15:51] of God Amen so the spirit of truth
[1:15:54] always always confirms the word not the
[1:15:57] person and when you're with the word
[1:15:59] then that's fine amen it can't do
[1:16:01] anything else because it's truth it's an
[1:16:02] absolute it cannot change yeah Peter was
[1:16:04] always getting himself caught up in
[1:16:06] these situations if you notice Peter was
[1:16:08] Mr enthusiasm he was Mr passionate he
[1:16:11] was gung-ho he had all the fire and
[1:16:13] brimstone in him Peter was going to go
[1:16:15] get him Peter was going to make it all
[1:16:17] the way Peter was Mr reliable Mr I'm
[1:16:20] going to make it all the way through and
[1:16:22] sometimes he was right on point and
[1:16:24] sometimes he was was completely caught
[1:16:25] up in his flesh but I love how the
[1:16:28] spirit of truth always encourages the
[1:16:30] true child of God look at what Jesus has
[1:16:32] to say this amen Jesus was hard on him
[1:16:35] at times but watch watch how he comes
[1:16:37] back to encourage him and the Lord said
[1:16:40] on said Simon Simon Pete
[1:16:45] Pete Pete buddy he says Satan has
[1:16:49] desired to have you that he may he may
[1:16:51] sift you as wheat hey Church we're all
[1:16:53] in a battle it's no different for you
[1:16:55] than Peter no different for me than
[1:16:57] Peter amen we're all in a battle and
[1:16:59] it's a battle between God and Satan he
[1:17:01] says Satan's trying to just get you
[1:17:03] blown
[1:17:04] away he says but I have prayed for thee
[1:17:08] that thy faith fail
[1:17:09] not there's our
[1:17:12] encouragement and then the spirit of
[1:17:14] truth comes behind and he says and when
[1:17:16] thou art converted strengthen thy
[1:17:18] Brethren sort of a mixed signal
[1:17:20] here
[1:17:22] Pete you got some work to do but I
[1:17:25] prayed for you there's the encouragement
[1:17:27] I prayed for you there's going to be a
[1:17:28] way to made through and when thou art
[1:17:30] converted so we got to take the good
[1:17:32] with the bad he's got to acknowledge I'm
[1:17:34] not converted yet but Jesus is saying
[1:17:37] you're going to be converted and when
[1:17:39] you're converted when you receive the
[1:17:41] spirit of truth then use it to help
[1:17:43] other
[1:17:44] people there's a there's a door opening
[1:17:47] up Pete and you're going to walk through
[1:17:49] it I'll get you through the door but
[1:17:50] there's going to be some hard times
[1:17:51] between now and then and Peter comes
[1:17:54] back he says said unto him Lord I am
[1:17:56] ready to go with thee both into prison
[1:17:58] and to
[1:18:02] death passion and enthusiasm were
[1:18:05] Peter's
[1:18:06] Hallmarks before his
[1:18:08] conversion but was what he said true
[1:18:11] because the spirit of truth will tell us
[1:18:12] if it's true or not and he said I tell
[1:18:15] thee Peter the shall not Crow this
[1:18:17] day before that thou shalt Thrice deny
[1:18:20] that thou knowest me see the spirit
[1:18:22] truth comes right back and says buddy
[1:18:23] you don't have what you think you have
[1:18:25] you don't have it and it's going to
[1:18:28] prove itself
[1:18:31] out but when the word of God is cutting
[1:18:34] church when it's personal and specific
[1:18:37] that's the time we ought to praise him
[1:18:40] all the more because if you want a
[1:18:42] confirmation that you're a child of God
[1:18:44] it's when the word corrects not
[1:18:47] judges Judas it judged Judas it judged
[1:18:52] Peter it corrected Peter it corrected
[1:18:54] amen the greatest confirmation you can
[1:18:56] have on a daily basis is that the word
[1:18:58] corrects you rather than judges you amen
[1:19:02] and it keeps coming back brother Braham
[1:19:04] now speaking of the son being brought
[1:19:05] into adoption he says now when this son
[1:19:07] began to come to school age this tutor
[1:19:10] would go with this son and stay with him
[1:19:11] and bring messages to the father how the
[1:19:13] son was progressing if the son was
[1:19:15] dilatory not about the father's business
[1:19:18] then how that tutor must be ashamed to
[1:19:20] walk up in the face of the father and
[1:19:22] say sir I'm sorry to say but your son is
[1:19:24] not do doing too well he just won't
[1:19:26] learn he doesn't care he says well then
[1:19:29] God when he left the Earth here his
[1:19:31] church he selected a tutor for his
[1:19:33] church he got a razor someone who would
[1:19:37] be honest who would bear the truth the
[1:19:40] right kind of a razor he said it wasn't
[1:19:43] some Archbishop or Pope or general
[1:19:46] overseer he sent the Holy Ghost to be
[1:19:48] the overseer and the tutor of the
[1:19:51] church he says but we adopted Bishops
[1:19:54] and everything else to be tutors of the
[1:19:55] church it isn't God's program the holy
[1:19:58] spirit is our teacher the holy spirit is
[1:20:01] the tutor of the church we've adopted
[1:20:03] every kind of an idea all kinds of
[1:20:05] schools and theologies and everything
[1:20:07] when the Holy Ghost ought to be leading
[1:20:09] us then he says this statement now
[1:20:11] that's the reason why the church is in
[1:20:13] the condition it is tonight it's being
[1:20:16] man Le and not spirit-led matter what
[1:20:19] scripture says sons of God are led by
[1:20:21] the spirit of God the defining feature
[1:20:23] one of them of a child of God is that
[1:20:25] they're led by the spirit he says Sons
[1:20:29] and Daughters you got it right here Sons
[1:20:30] and Daughters of God are led by the
[1:20:32] spirit of God the spirit of God is to
[1:20:34] lead the church now catch this last bit
[1:20:36] he says now man might say
[1:20:39] anything cuz why we want your money we
[1:20:42] want to influence you we want to have
[1:20:44] power we want to have control we want to
[1:20:45] have a big church we want to have people
[1:20:47] give us accolades we want to build up a
[1:20:49] big reputation men will say
[1:20:52] anything okay he said but the the holy
[1:20:55] spirit will tell the truth on you we're
[1:20:57] speaking on the spirit of Truth amen
[1:20:59] we've read it before that the the
[1:21:00] scripture says that Christ is a high
[1:21:02] priest who can be touched by the feeling
[1:21:04] of our
[1:21:05] infirmities he knows how it feels to be
[1:21:07] in flesh he knows the struggle he knows
[1:21:11] the hardship but that doesn't mean he
[1:21:13] bends or shapes the word to give us
[1:21:16] leeway never he always brings us up to
[1:21:19] the standard not brings the standard
[1:21:21] back down to us Amen in other words he
[1:21:24] can't do that because he'd be a liar and
[1:21:26] a deceiver if it changes based on us
[1:21:28] then it's not truth and God has lied
[1:21:31] when he gave us his word so the Holy
[1:21:32] Spirit won't come down and just say oh I
[1:21:34] know you're just that way it's okay
[1:21:36] we're just going to let that go no the
[1:21:39] holy spirit will show you the word and
[1:21:40] it'll say there's power in the word if
[1:21:42] you'll just line up if you'll humble
[1:21:45] yourself and say Lord I see where I'm
[1:21:46] not there and I see where the word is
[1:21:49] I'm asking you to raise me to that level
[1:21:50] then he'll do it but too often what
[1:21:53] we're doing is we're trying to get to
[1:21:54] coddle us and let us stay where we are
[1:21:58] rather than saying Lord Lift Me Up set
[1:22:00] me on a higher plane amen yes this holy
[1:22:03] spirit is a comforter and we'll preach
[1:22:05] on that soon Lord willing maybe even on
[1:22:07] Wednesday night but the Comfort we have
[1:22:09] is not that he comes down and gives us a
[1:22:11] hug the Comfort we have is that he
[1:22:13] doesn't
[1:22:14] change we
[1:22:17] change the comforter changes us not
[1:22:21] himself amen the word never changes us
[1:22:23] amen that's why the the world is so the
[1:22:25] religious world is so messed up is that
[1:22:27] they've taken the word and they've
[1:22:29] changed it to suit themselves and in
[1:22:32] doing so they've taken the power
[1:22:33] completely out of
[1:22:34] it how can something have power if you
[1:22:37] make it work according to your will
[1:22:39] instead of its own it can't do it there
[1:22:41] there there's no power in it amen Jesus
[1:22:43] said that the people by their Traditions
[1:22:46] have made the word of God
[1:22:48] ineffective he says you've added to your
[1:22:51] religion you've taken things that make
[1:22:53] you feel spiritual that make you feel
[1:22:56] saved that make you feel good and you've
[1:22:59] made the word of God completely
[1:23:00] ineffective why cuz we've compromised it
[1:23:03] with our own ideas our own spirituality
[1:23:05] and it led the people of Israel down a
[1:23:07] road of tremendous religious
[1:23:11] fervor and it took them completely into
[1:23:14] apostasy Christ came and they didn't
[1:23:16] they didn't recognize the word because
[1:23:17] they'd gone so far in their own religion
[1:23:19] they'd left the word behind and they
[1:23:20] couldn't receive it
[1:23:23] amen but I want to take for the last 30
[1:23:26] minutes maybe of this service this
[1:23:27] morning this idea of the spirit of Truth
[1:23:29] and bring it down into our time and our
[1:23:31] season because we see in the Book of
[1:23:33] Revelation that the spirit of Truth acts
[1:23:35] exactly like I've spoken about it will
[1:23:37] tell the truth on you amen it'll give
[1:23:40] you the good and it'll give you the bad
[1:23:43] why because the word stands absolute and
[1:23:44] it's comparing you to the word so if we
[1:23:48] look at in Revelation 2 And1 this is
[1:23:50] speaking remember there's seven Church
[1:23:52] ages seven Gentile Church Church ages
[1:23:54] starting with the Ephesian Church age uh
[1:23:57] which was Paul's time and coming all the
[1:23:58] way up to the seventh Church age which
[1:24:00] is today and in Revelation
[1:24:02] 2:1 it
[1:24:06] says I skipped
[1:24:09] that he says that's what we want is the
[1:24:11] truth regardless of where it hurts
[1:24:14] circumcises or who it cuts off we want
[1:24:17] the truth you shall know the truth and
[1:24:19] the truth shall make you free amen we
[1:24:22] want to be changed rather than stay as
[1:24:24] we are
[1:24:25] so he says in Revelation 2:1 now he's
[1:24:27] speaking to the seven Gentile Church
[1:24:28] ages this is the first one Paul's
[1:24:31] age he says unto the angel of the Church
[1:24:33] of Ephesus write these things saith he
[1:24:36] that holdeth the Seven Stars in his
[1:24:38] right hand who walks in the midst of the
[1:24:40] seven golden candlesticks so he's saying
[1:24:42] speak to the angel speak to the
[1:24:44] messenger in the in in Revelations 2 and
[1:24:47] 3 these seven Church ages the angel is
[1:24:49] speaking of a literal messenger and if
[1:24:51] you look in Revelations 1 remember he
[1:24:53] has a seven stars in his hands and he
[1:24:55] says those are the seven angels the
[1:24:57] seven Messengers The Seven men to the
[1:24:59] seven Church ages so who is the Angel
[1:25:02] who was the messenger to the first
[1:25:03] church age it was the Apostle Paul amen
[1:25:06] he was the prophet to the age and he
[1:25:08] established gospel truth above him
[1:25:10] Beyond everyone else even Peter had to
[1:25:12] acknowledge Paul's gospel remember what
[1:25:15] Paul said if anyone including me
[1:25:17] preaches anything other than what I
[1:25:19] brought to you already let that person
[1:25:21] be a cursed right I've said it before
[1:25:23] but it's funny how the Catholic Church
[1:25:25] picks Peter as the first pope but Peter
[1:25:28] was corrected by Paul if you're going to
[1:25:30] pick a pope it should have been Paul cuz
[1:25:32] he had the word for the day but we know
[1:25:35] a pope is wrong anyways there is no such
[1:25:37] thing it was never put in there amen we
[1:25:38] see here that the preeminence is always
[1:25:40] for the Holy Spirit the one walking in
[1:25:43] the church not for the messenger himself
[1:25:45] amen but it's it's always the holy
[1:25:47] spirit that has the preeminence for us
[1:25:49] that's where we find our leadership
[1:25:51] Abraham says this he says The Great I Am
[1:25:53] the almighty God has come as Spirit to
[1:25:55] fill his true church he has a right to
[1:25:58] move anywhere he wants to and upon
[1:26:00] anybody he wants to we don't make any
[1:26:03] holy man amongst us but the whole true
[1:26:06] Congregation of the Lord Is Holy because
[1:26:09] of the presence of the Holy Spirit he
[1:26:11] says it is he the holy spirit that is
[1:26:14] Holy not the congregation of itself they
[1:26:17] call a pope Holy Father and guess what
[1:26:21] there's only one holy and that's God and
[1:26:24] there's only one father and that's our
[1:26:27] father in Heaven scripture says you're
[1:26:28] not supposed to call any man father and
[1:26:30] ain't one of us holy so they they
[1:26:32] they've got him doubly damned by calling
[1:26:34] him a Holy Father he can never match up
[1:26:36] to that amen man we don't raise up men
[1:26:40] but remember in Revelations 2:1 this is
[1:26:42] John on the AL of pus patmas this is 860
[1:26:45] 70 maybe maybe even 80 Paul's
[1:26:49] dead and it's saying write to the angel
[1:26:53] write to the messenger and tell him to
[1:26:54] preach this but Paul's already preached
[1:26:57] so that means you can find what he's
[1:26:59] talking about here in Paul's message
[1:27:01] already in the gospels of the New
[1:27:03] Testament not in the gospels but in the
[1:27:04] books that he wrote in the New Testament
[1:27:06] so this message that he's giving in
[1:27:08] Revelation 2:1 to the Church of Ephesus
[1:27:11] is not so much to Paul CU Paul's already
[1:27:13] received his message but this is for the
[1:27:15] people that are living under Paul's
[1:27:17] message even though Paul's gone it's
[1:27:20] reminding the people of their obligation
[1:27:23] to the word amen it's reminding them of
[1:27:25] the word that they've received and so
[1:27:27] now the the the the spirit of God is
[1:27:29] speaking to them and it says I Know Thy
[1:27:31] works and thy labor and thy patience and
[1:27:34] H how thou canst not bear them which are
[1:27:36] evil and thou Hast tried them which say
[1:27:38] they are Apostles and are not and has
[1:27:40] found them liars and has borne and has
[1:27:42] patience and for my name's sake has
[1:27:44] labored and hasth not fainted so this is
[1:27:47] the first church age and the spirit of
[1:27:48] Truth Now is acknowledging all that
[1:27:51] they've done is good and right he God
[1:27:54] will absolutely encourage us and affirm
[1:27:56] us when we do what the word tells us to
[1:27:58] do and they had done these things
[1:28:00] according to the word that they'
[1:28:01] received from
[1:28:02] Paul but now he comes to verse four and
[1:28:05] he says
[1:28:06] nevertheless but I have somewhat against
[1:28:09] the I've got a little thing against you
[1:28:11] because thou Hast left thy first love so
[1:28:13] the spirit of truth comes and he gives
[1:28:14] them all the
[1:28:16] encouragement families parents if you
[1:28:18] want to know how to encourage your
[1:28:19] children and correct them look at what
[1:28:21] God does he comes and he gives you the
[1:28:23] good news news and then he gives you the
[1:28:26] correction behind
[1:28:27] it we can't always be doing
[1:28:30] this we got to build our kids up and
[1:28:33] then we correct them behind it amen it's
[1:28:36] a good thing to follow but remember the
[1:28:38] spirit of Truth has to tell the whole
[1:28:40] story it has to give us the full picture
[1:28:42] amen they put God aside they left their
[1:28:45] first love and something else had the
[1:28:46] preeminence and so what do they do
[1:28:48] remember the spirit of truth will tell
[1:28:50] you the error but it will give you the
[1:28:51] remedy to the error as well here's the
[1:28:55] remedy he says remember therefore from
[1:28:57] whence Thou Art fallen in other words
[1:28:59] they'd had it before they were living
[1:29:00] right they were living by the word God
[1:29:02] had preeminence he says remember from
[1:29:05] whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do
[1:29:07] the first work so he says go back repent
[1:29:10] of where you're at go back and do what
[1:29:12] Paul told you to do which is let the
[1:29:14] Holy Spirit have control of the church
[1:29:17] get the men get the Traditions away it's
[1:29:19] not that God doesn't use men we'll talk
[1:29:21] about it in a second but he's saying get
[1:29:23] away from religion and get back to
[1:29:24] Christ that's really what he was saying
[1:29:27] or else see there's the remedy but
[1:29:30] there's judgment or else I will come
[1:29:32] unto thee quickly and will remove thy
[1:29:34] Candlestick out of his place except thou
[1:29:36] repent he says you won't receive eternal
[1:29:39] life he says but this thou Hast comes
[1:29:43] back he says you got to get things fixed
[1:29:45] you got to make it right or else but
[1:29:47] then he says but you still got something
[1:29:48] he says Thou hatest the Deeds of the
[1:29:50] nicadan which I also hate now here's the
[1:29:53] spirit of Truth he's commending them
[1:29:54] again for standing up the nickan which
[1:29:56] was the men that wanted control of the
[1:29:58] church for their own
[1:30:00] purposes then he finishes in verse 7 he
[1:30:03] that have an ear let him hear what the
[1:30:06] spirit saith unto the churches and
[1:30:08] here's the promise to him that
[1:30:10] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[1:30:11] tree of life which is in the midst of
[1:30:13] the paradise of God so this is John
[1:30:16] writing but who is speaking it's not
[1:30:19] John it's the holy
[1:30:21] spirit it's not Paul
[1:30:24] it's the holy spirit amen it's using
[1:30:27] Paul to give the message but it's the
[1:30:29] spirit of God that's giving the message
[1:30:31] now watch what brother Braham says about
[1:30:32] this he's talking about the the what
[1:30:34] they did right in the book of EP in in
[1:30:36] the Ephesian church he he says Thou Hast
[1:30:39] tried them that say they are Apostles
[1:30:41] and are not and has found them Liars he
[1:30:43] says my that's a blunt statement thou H
[1:30:45] has tried them who call themselves
[1:30:48] apostles who call themselves believers
[1:30:51] who call themselves ministers who call
[1:30:53] themselves by these things that get them
[1:30:55] influen he says isn't that presumptuous
[1:30:58] what right has a people to try those who
[1:31:00] call themselves
[1:31:02] Apostles do you as the lady have a right
[1:31:05] to judge the
[1:31:07] ministry according to the scriptures you
[1:31:09] absolutely do and you
[1:31:12] must it's one of the things that held
[1:31:15] them he says do and how do they try them
[1:31:19] oh I love this he says here it is in
[1:31:21] Galatians 1:8 though we are an angel
[1:31:23] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[1:31:25] you that which we have already preached
[1:31:27] unto you let him be ACC cursed he says
[1:31:29] it was the apostles who brought the
[1:31:31] original word to the people that
[1:31:33] original word could not change not even
[1:31:36] a DOT or dash of it Paul knew it was God
[1:31:39] who had spoken it to him so he said even
[1:31:41] if I come Paul put himself in the same
[1:31:45] box as everyone else and said even if I
[1:31:46] come and try and give a second
[1:31:48] Revelation try and make one little
[1:31:50] change in what I gave originally let me
[1:31:52] be accursed you see Paul knew that first
[1:31:55] revelation was correct God can't give a
[1:31:58] first revelation and then a second
[1:32:00] Revelation if he did he would be
[1:32:02] changing his
[1:32:04] mind he says now he can give a
[1:32:06] revelation and then add to it as he did
[1:32:08] in the Garden of Eden when he promised
[1:32:10] the seed to the woman and then later
[1:32:12] designated that seed had to come through
[1:32:14] Abraham and then later said it would
[1:32:16] come by the same Bloodlines in David he
[1:32:18] says but it was the same Revelation he
[1:32:20] never changed it it only gave the people
[1:32:24] more information to help them receive
[1:32:27] and understand it he says but God's word
[1:32:30] can't change the same the seed came
[1:32:33] exactly as was revealed he says
[1:32:36] hallelujah he says now here's what those
[1:32:39] see what the false apostles were doing
[1:32:41] they came with their own word what they
[1:32:46] scripture says that they would he the
[1:32:48] people would Heap to themselves teachers
[1:32:51] having itching ears people that would
[1:32:52] tell them what they want wanted but what
[1:32:55] these men were coming in they were they
[1:32:57] were called in scripture wolves and
[1:32:58] sheep's clothing they came in pretending
[1:33:01] to be Believers pretending to be
[1:33:02] Christians but they came in to destroy
[1:33:05] and devour and use the people of God for
[1:33:07] their own benefit and so they came with
[1:33:09] their own word that was calculated to
[1:33:11] benefit them rather than you I've got to
[1:33:15] preach the word for you not for me it's
[1:33:17] for me I'm with you don't don't get me
[1:33:19] wrong but I can't get up here and preach
[1:33:21] a word that benefits me while hurting
[1:33:23] you that would make me a wolf in sheep's
[1:33:25] clothing and that's what they did they
[1:33:26] came with a word that would hurt the
[1:33:28] people that would bind the people to
[1:33:30] them rather than free them by the word
[1:33:33] binding them to men and we see it today
[1:33:35] he says the those Ephesians knew that
[1:33:37] word as Paul had taught it they were
[1:33:39] full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on
[1:33:41] of Paul's hands they looked those false
[1:33:43] Apostles in the eye and said you are not
[1:33:45] saying what Paul said you are therefore
[1:33:49] false
[1:33:51] wow he says oh that sets my heart on
[1:33:54] fire get back to the word it's not you
[1:33:56] that really tries the Apostle and the
[1:33:58] prophet and teacher it is the word that
[1:34:02] tries them remember like I said we're
[1:34:04] not here to judge people we're here to
[1:34:06] stay with the word and then they choose
[1:34:08] do I stay with it or do I walk away from
[1:34:10] it I've talked many times about the
[1:34:12] things that happened in our little
[1:34:13] church in Texas how that Pastor had
[1:34:16] fallen away was living a double life
[1:34:17] while still ministering and fooled so
[1:34:20] many of us for so long and you know it
[1:34:21] would be easy in those circumstances to
[1:34:23] blame the man and believe me he carries
[1:34:26] blame he willingly fooled us he
[1:34:29] willingly lived a double life but when I
[1:34:31] go back in the scripture those people
[1:34:32] always are proven out anyways it's going
[1:34:34] to come out no matter what their fruits
[1:34:36] come out amen but it's easy to point to
[1:34:38] that man and say well he fooled us but
[1:34:40] the thing I always asked myself or the
[1:34:42] thing I asked myself after that was if
[1:34:44] I've got the holy ghost in my life and I
[1:34:47] did and I do how did he fool
[1:34:50] me I don't care how he fooled anyone
[1:34:52] else I ask how did he fool me
[1:34:55] cuz there's error there if the Holy
[1:34:58] Spirit does not discern there's error if
[1:35:01] the word doesn't discern what's going on
[1:35:03] there's a problem and so I asked myself
[1:35:05] how did this happen amen the holy spirit
[1:35:07] is the discerner in our midst by the
[1:35:09] word of God and when I looked at my
[1:35:11] decisions around that man I found
[1:35:13] multiple times where I did not hold him
[1:35:16] accountable to the word of
[1:35:18] God
[1:35:20] period amen if I did he would have had
[1:35:24] to make a clear choice of stay with the
[1:35:27] word or go his own way and he would have
[1:35:30] proved what he was right there but I was
[1:35:32] being
[1:35:33] nice I was being kind I was being
[1:35:35] courteous I was being
[1:35:37] accommodating amen he was a good friend
[1:35:40] of mine I appreciated his ministry I
[1:35:42] appreciated his gift I didn't want to
[1:35:44] have the difficult conversation I was a
[1:35:46] deacon I should have had the difficult
[1:35:48] conversation I failed in my duty in that
[1:35:51] but what happened was I put out the
[1:35:53] discernment of the word to maintain
[1:35:56] relationship that's that that's the
[1:35:58] truth and so that's not God's fault
[1:36:00] that's my fault amen I had no one to
[1:36:02] blame but myself because I had given
[1:36:04] that man that Ministry the preeminence
[1:36:06] over the word of God looking back
[1:36:09] hindsight all the signs were there all
[1:36:12] the proof was there but I was blinded
[1:36:14] because I put away the word for the sake
[1:36:16] of maintaining relationship for the sake
[1:36:18] of having a pastor continue there in
[1:36:20] these different things what was I
[1:36:22] wanting to do I didn't want to judge the
[1:36:25] man but we're not here to judge the man
[1:36:29] but we are here to hold each other
[1:36:31] accountable to the word amen there's
[1:36:33] accountability in a body of group in a
[1:36:35] body of people I didn't want to have the
[1:36:37] difficult conversation so that I could
[1:36:39] Corner him to where he'd have to make a
[1:36:41] clear-cut decision am I for or am I
[1:36:43] against the word of God Amen but
[1:36:45] remember I'm not here to judge you
[1:36:47] you're not here to judge me what you
[1:36:48] hear is you're you're there to lay down
[1:36:49] the word and say what are you going to
[1:36:51] do with it that's it it's so simple
[1:36:54] what will you do with the
[1:36:58] word says no matter how just and upright
[1:37:01] a Christian is before the public how
[1:37:03] gracious he is to his fellow men doing
[1:37:05] nothing but good let him confess Christ
[1:37:07] as his Savior and acknowledge the
[1:37:09] operation of the gifts of the holy
[1:37:10] spirit in tongues prophecy healing and
[1:37:12] miracles and he will be
[1:37:14] condemned the spirit of this world hates
[1:37:17] the spirit of
[1:37:19] God Amen have we seen it I've seen
[1:37:22] people hate me without without a reason
[1:37:25] without a
[1:37:26] reason he says not that they couldn't
[1:37:29] find a
[1:37:31] reason but hated me from the
[1:37:34] get-go why I have something they don't
[1:37:38] have and that means we're in
[1:37:41] Conflict he says and because it can't
[1:37:44] overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries
[1:37:46] to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit
[1:37:48] of Truth dwells persecution and trials
[1:37:51] are a natural normal part of the
[1:37:53] Christian Life can we say
[1:37:56] amen he says there is only one thing you
[1:37:59] can do about them when somebody does you
[1:38:03] wrong when you know that you know that
[1:38:06] you
[1:38:07] know I don't deserve what they're doing
[1:38:10] what do we
[1:38:13] do go all Bruce Lee on them right bring
[1:38:18] down become the sons of thunder right
[1:38:22] fire and brimstone
[1:38:24] shall be thy
[1:38:26] portion that's what we
[1:38:29] do he says there is only one thing you
[1:38:34] can do about it Church remember we are
[1:38:37] under a mercy Covenant as long as we are
[1:38:41] here our ministry is
[1:38:45] come and drink of the Waters of Life
[1:38:47] freely we're sounding a trumpet which is
[1:38:51] what Liberty the next trumpet is
[1:38:54] Judgment for then the next trumpet's
[1:38:56] judgment there's liberty while we're
[1:38:58] here once the bride leaves in the
[1:39:00] resurrection and the Rapture it's
[1:39:01] judgment judgment judgment we are the
[1:39:05] only thing that's holding back judgment
[1:39:07] this morning so our every
[1:39:10] response is
[1:39:12] Mercy every single time there's only one
[1:39:16] thing you can do about them commit them
[1:39:20] all to God judge not and their
[1:39:23] outworking and final judgment to
[1:39:28] him we had an event happen in our home
[1:39:30] this week and I won't go into details
[1:39:32] but somebody outside did something wrong
[1:39:35] to somebody
[1:39:37] inside and you know what we can sit here
[1:39:39] and we can say I'm a Child of God
[1:39:42] they're going to get
[1:39:44] it and you know what that is church
[1:39:47] that's the
[1:39:48] flesh that's the Flesh and I'll tell you
[1:39:51] I've had all sorts of things going
[1:39:53] through my mind I'm not dumb I'm like I
[1:39:56] I'm pretty sure I can get this
[1:39:58] person and never get
[1:40:02] caught and you know what it is it's
[1:40:05] Satan trying to get you worked up about
[1:40:08] not something that is not remotely worth
[1:40:11] a person's
[1:40:12] soul right I've had this happen many
[1:40:15] times because what righteous indignation
[1:40:18] Rises
[1:40:19] up and Satan will take it and he'll turn
[1:40:21] it into anger and judgment rather than
[1:40:24] the mercy and Grace of the holy spirit
[1:40:25] for that person amen hey I'm still
[1:40:28] dealing with this thing this flesh wants
[1:40:33] judgment but when it's my turn what do I
[1:40:35] ask for Mercy grace mercy and Grace come
[1:40:38] on God give me another chance come come
[1:40:40] on Amen I want Mercy but God helped me
[1:40:43] to give it to somebody else the flesh
[1:40:45] never wants to do that that's why we
[1:40:47] need the spirit inside of us Amen to
[1:40:49] give Mercy when there is no reason to
[1:40:52] give it we give it because it's still
[1:40:54] available
[1:40:57] amen Jesus made it very clear how to
[1:41:00] know who is and is not a child of
[1:41:02] God he says why do you not understand my
[1:41:05] speech he's speaking to these priests
[1:41:08] even because you cannot hear my word
[1:41:10] they could literally hear it but they
[1:41:12] couldn't understand it or receive it or
[1:41:13] accept it amen it's not coming to church
[1:41:16] that makes us
[1:41:17] Christians amen it's accepting the word
[1:41:19] of God personally that makes us a
[1:41:21] Christian he says ye are of your this is
[1:41:24] the spirit of Truth speaking now we're
[1:41:25] speaking on the spirit of Truth ye are
[1:41:27] of your father the Devil he's speaking
[1:41:30] to the Ministry Church ye are of your
[1:41:33] father the devil and the lust of your
[1:41:35] father ye will do he was a murderer from
[1:41:37] the beginning and Abode not in the truth
[1:41:39] because there is no truth in him when he
[1:41:42] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[1:41:44] for he's a liar and the father of it and
[1:41:47] because I tell you the truth you believe
[1:41:49] me not why cuz they're tuned to believe
[1:41:52] a lie cuz they're Children Of
[1:41:57] Satan he says which of you convinces me
[1:42:00] of sin and if I say the truth why do you
[1:42:02] not believe me he that is of God heareth
[1:42:06] God's words remember what Jesus said my
[1:42:09] sheep hear my voice and another they
[1:42:12] will not follow it's that simple he says
[1:42:15] ye therefore hear them not because ye
[1:42:18] are not of
[1:42:20] God that's a spirit of Truth speaking it
[1:42:23] couldn't lie to them to make them feel
[1:42:25] good about themselves it called them out
[1:42:27] amen it gave them the evidence by which
[1:42:29] they know they are True
[1:42:30] Believers when we read in Revelations 2
[1:42:32] and 3 of all those messages and in
[1:42:35] Revelation 2 it goes down it does three
[1:42:37] Church ages or four Church ages and then
[1:42:38] in Revelation 3 comes down and does the
[1:42:40] next on all the way through seven and
[1:42:42] then at the end of every message to
[1:42:44] every Church it says the line he that
[1:42:46] has an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:42:48] says to the churches we're talking about
[1:42:50] the spirit of Truth this morning and if
[1:42:52] we look at that then how did the Holy
[1:42:54] Spirit speak to the to the first church
[1:42:57] age through
[1:42:59] Paul yes it spoke through Peter and
[1:43:01] James and these different ones the
[1:43:03] apostles and whatnot but it brought the
[1:43:05] word through Paul amen it was Paul's
[1:43:09] message alone that was guaranteed to be
[1:43:11] true everyone else had to line up with
[1:43:13] that because it was Paul that was taught
[1:43:15] it by the Holy Spirit on the backside of
[1:43:16] the desert remember Paul when he was
[1:43:18] converted he says immediately I
[1:43:21] conferred not with flesh and blood he
[1:43:22] says immediately I didn't go to men I
[1:43:25] didn't go to Ministries I didn't go to
[1:43:26] the disciples I didn't go to the
[1:43:28] apostles in other words he didn't go get
[1:43:30] somebody else's Revelation but the Holy
[1:43:32] Spirit took him out on the backside of
[1:43:34] the desert for years in Arabia and it
[1:43:37] gave him the Gospel of Jesus Christ as
[1:43:40] we read it today in the New
[1:43:42] Testament and so the Holy Spirit spoke
[1:43:44] expressly through Paul and then what
[1:43:46] happened then is the five-fold ministry
[1:43:49] of that day right it's not just a
[1:43:51] prophet You' got youve you got the
[1:43:53] evangelists and you got the the pastors
[1:43:55] and the teachers and the different ones
[1:43:57] they all come down and they start
[1:43:59] preaching the same thing Paul preached
[1:44:02] remember what Paul said to Timothy Paul
[1:44:04] was giving his message to Timothy and
[1:44:05] then he said Timothy commit this message
[1:44:08] to Faithful Men and they'll say the same
[1:44:10] things you're saying which is the same
[1:44:11] thing I'm saying and the Holy Spirit can
[1:44:13] continue to lead the People by the word
[1:44:15] of Truth
[1:44:18] amen so we nobody else could change that
[1:44:20] gospel because it wasn't Paul's gospel
[1:44:23] it was the Gospel of Jesus Christ given
[1:44:25] to him by the Holy Spirit it came
[1:44:26] through Paul but it wasn't Paul's it was
[1:44:28] God's message and that message can't
[1:44:30] change it and so we can't undo it and we
[1:44:32] can't change it because everything else
[1:44:34] changes around us that's where we're at
[1:44:36] today amen because standards have
[1:44:38] changed society's change what's
[1:44:39] acceptable is change listen we got
[1:44:41] people living common law and thinking
[1:44:42] that it's
[1:44:44] okay scripture clearly says you can't do
[1:44:46] it there's all sorts of things we're
[1:44:49] doing today not us by God's grace but
[1:44:51] people are doing today and even going to
[1:44:53] church and sitting there and thinking
[1:44:54] they're okay when the word says you
[1:44:55] can't do it you're not allowed to do it
[1:44:57] the Holy Spirit the spirit of truth will
[1:44:59] take us back to Paul's original
[1:45:03] message or it isn't the holy spirit amen
[1:45:06] God can't change so his word and his
[1:45:08] message can never change but as we close
[1:45:11] let's go to our age the seventh age the
[1:45:13] leoan church age do we want to hear the
[1:45:16] truth we want the truth amen the message
[1:45:19] for every age is to the professing
[1:45:22] believer it's not for the unbeliever
[1:45:24] it's not for the atheist it's for the
[1:45:26] churchgoer the Bible reading person it's
[1:45:29] for the professing Christian the person
[1:45:31] that hears the word okay so let's read
[1:45:34] what R
[1:45:35] says and unto the angel of the Church of
[1:45:37] the leans now remember leod deia means
[1:45:40] people's rights so unto the angel of the
[1:45:43] Church of the people's rights WR these
[1:45:46] things sayith the amen the faithful and
[1:45:49] true witness the beginning of the
[1:45:50] creation of God now notice who he is
[1:45:53] it's always
[1:45:54] Perfection he says the amen the amen
[1:45:56] means so be it he says he's the faithful
[1:45:59] and true witness now faithful and true
[1:46:01] witness always means thus saith the Lord
[1:46:04] because there's only one thing that
[1:46:05] never fails and that's the word of God
[1:46:07] so when he says he's the faithful and
[1:46:09] true Min uh uh witness it always means
[1:46:12] it's a prophetic
[1:46:13] Ministry it's a son of man Ministry not
[1:46:16] just a messenger so the first one was a
[1:46:18] a prophet messenger that means the last
[1:46:20] Church age messenger has to be a prophet
[1:46:22] as well because it's the faithful and
[1:46:23] true witness it's thus sayith the
[1:46:26] Lord he says I Know Thy works okay this
[1:46:30] is our age now that thou art neither
[1:46:33] cold nor hot I would thou were cold or
[1:46:36] hot the leosan church age this last
[1:46:38] Church age this final Church age our
[1:46:40] time today is the only one that the Holy
[1:46:43] Spirit couldn't say a good thing
[1:46:46] about church we're living in darkness we
[1:46:49] are living in a time of the absolute
[1:46:52] pinnacle of sin and unbelief remember
[1:46:55] scripture says it'd be a gross Darkness
[1:46:58] but it says in the evening time there'
[1:46:59] be light the word of God will come how
[1:47:02] by a prophetic
[1:47:04] Ministry but he says I know you're
[1:47:07] you're
[1:47:09] lukewarm how many here would you know
[1:47:12] come over to my house and say brother
[1:47:13] John what I'd really love is a glass of
[1:47:17] lukewarm
[1:47:19] water nobody says
[1:47:21] it they either want it cold or they want
[1:47:24] it
[1:47:25] hot right maybe dip some tea in it if
[1:47:27] it's hot if it's cold maybe whatever
[1:47:30] nobody's asking for lukewarm
[1:47:32] water nobody loves
[1:47:35] it verse 16 so then because Thou Art
[1:47:38] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[1:47:39] spew thee out of my mouth ever have a
[1:47:41] water bottle left in your car when it's
[1:47:43] sunny out and when you left it was
[1:47:46] pretty good you came back an hour later
[1:47:48] and you go and take a swig and you just
[1:47:50] want to do what he says
[1:47:53] it's gross it's
[1:47:56] gross now remember everything in the
[1:47:58] scripture when it comes to Revelation 2
[1:48:00] and 3 is spiritual it's not just
[1:48:03] physical some of it does match up with
[1:48:04] physical for sure but it's spiritual so
[1:48:06] he's talking about spiritual
[1:48:07] lukewarmness and how do you get
[1:48:09] spiritually lukewarm there's only one
[1:48:11] way
[1:48:13] compromise compromise you've got to
[1:48:15] blend the word with something
[1:48:17] else but watch now what happens when
[1:48:20] they start blending see they thought
[1:48:22] they improve their condition when they
[1:48:24] did it we're not stupid we do things
[1:48:28] that we think will make life better for
[1:48:29] us but just because we think it's better
[1:48:31] doesn't mean it is better and what we've
[1:48:34] produced now is is
[1:48:37] compromise now look at the effect of
[1:48:39] this verse 17 because thou sayest I am
[1:48:42] rich and increased with goods and have
[1:48:44] need of nothing so their their
[1:48:47] confession their testimony is I am
[1:48:49] spiritually rich I have all the gifts I
[1:48:52] don't need anything now here's God
[1:48:55] here's the spirit of Truth coming down
[1:48:57] and he says and knowest not that thou
[1:48:59] art wretched miserable poor blind and
[1:49:03] naked so remember the spirit of our age
[1:49:06] is religious
[1:49:08] self-deception amen we're in an age of
[1:49:11] people's rights and the right of
[1:49:12] Christians today is to shape the word to
[1:49:15] match where they're at rather than let
[1:49:17] their lives be shaped by the word itself
[1:49:20] amen their right is to sit in church
[1:49:22] Church in any condition they want to be
[1:49:24] in where the word has no effect and yet
[1:49:26] they are somehow going to eternal life
[1:49:30] and they're somehow Christlike even
[1:49:31] though they don't follow the word of God
[1:49:34] Amen it's delusions of spiritual
[1:49:35] leadership and blessing and what happens
[1:49:38] when you think that you when when you
[1:49:40] put away the word and you match the word
[1:49:42] to yourself rather than the other way
[1:49:43] around you make yourself the absolute
[1:49:46] and that builds
[1:49:47] Pride it builds Pride every single time
[1:49:50] because hey if I get to sent the
[1:49:52] standard I'm going to make myself the
[1:49:55] standard and if I'm the standard
[1:49:57] nobody's better than me sister Justine
[1:50:00] good luck try and sis you're not going
[1:50:02] to do it right and so now it's I'm
[1:50:05] better than everybody else my church is
[1:50:08] better than everyone else my Ministry is
[1:50:10] better than everyone else me me me me me
[1:50:13] I've got it all and you guys don't have
[1:50:15] it and then you've got your own little
[1:50:17] church and you've got your own little
[1:50:18] church and your own little this that the
[1:50:19] other thing and all of a sudden it is
[1:50:20] just pride pride pride and the Hallmark
[1:50:23] of Satan in your life is
[1:50:26] pride remember what he said at the
[1:50:28] beginning I will Ascend I will I will I
[1:50:32] will I will what do Paul tell us to do
[1:50:35] if the Lord Wills if the Lord Wills Lord
[1:50:37] willing I'll do this Lord see he was
[1:50:39] lifted up in Pride and what you have
[1:50:41] here is a people that are so caught up
[1:50:43] in themselves they can't see their real
[1:50:45] spiritual
[1:50:47] condition but it never leaves us without
[1:50:50] hope it never leaves us with without
[1:50:53] hope the spirit of truth will always
[1:50:55] bring a remedy and even this horrible
[1:50:57] Fallen church that God had nothing good
[1:51:00] to say about he still said I'll give you
[1:51:02] a way out of
[1:51:04] this let me say this morning I don't
[1:51:06] care where you are in your walk with God
[1:51:09] there's a way
[1:51:10] made listen you could be living a secret
[1:51:13] double life and I wouldn't know about it
[1:51:16] I've know many people did it for
[1:51:20] years but God knows and if that's where
[1:51:23] you're at he can set you free he always
[1:51:27] makes a way of escape to the True
[1:51:29] Believer here it is Verse 18 I counsel
[1:51:33] thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[1:51:35] that thou mayest be rich and white
[1:51:38] rayment that thou mayest be clothed and
[1:51:40] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:51:42] appear and anoint thine eyes with isav
[1:51:44] that thou mayest see now we preached on
[1:51:46] this before I'm not going to spend time
[1:51:47] on it this morning but what is gold
[1:51:49] tried in the fire you'll notice this is
[1:51:51] the only one you have to buy
[1:51:54] you have to buy this because it's Godly
[1:51:56] character proven through trials and
[1:51:59] testing and as a child of God you can
[1:52:01] choose to go in or you can choose to
[1:52:04] pull back you got to choose to go
[1:52:06] through the trial listen God can lay
[1:52:08] something in front of you and you can
[1:52:09] take you can short circuit it time and
[1:52:11] time again and yes you'll keep going
[1:52:12] around the mountain you'll never
[1:52:13] progress but you've got to pay a price
[1:52:15] for this one because you got to lay
[1:52:17] yourself down you got to let his
[1:52:19] character be made made real in you and
[1:52:21] let everything else of you get beaten
[1:52:23] out that white reignment is God's
[1:52:25] righteousness rather than our
[1:52:28] self-righteousness we've got to Humble
[1:52:30] ourselves you have you ever seen these
[1:52:32] things they've got these t-shirts that
[1:52:33] say Only God can judge
[1:52:36] me nobody's seen them they've got these
[1:52:39] things now saying Only God can judge me
[1:52:41] usually alternative lifestyle
[1:52:43] people let me say this you don't want to
[1:52:46] wait for God to judge you the word is
[1:52:49] here with Mercy why would you ask for
[1:52:51] judgment when mercies here God forbid we
[1:52:55] say Only God can judge me yes only God
[1:52:58] can judge you you don't want to wait to
[1:52:59] that point he sent a message of mercy
[1:53:01] and Grace and forgiveness take it
[1:53:04] otherwise he'll judge you and it's not
[1:53:06] going to end
[1:53:08] well but then look at this last one it
[1:53:10] says isav that you can see and the only
[1:53:14] way you can get there is
[1:53:18] repentance because this is something
[1:53:20] that only God can show you
[1:53:23] and what it is is when the word is
[1:53:25] brought to you you can see your real
[1:53:27] condition and you realize I'm not what I
[1:53:29] thought I was and so repentance brings
[1:53:34] humility which puts you out of the way
[1:53:37] and it allows God to start showing you
[1:53:38] the reality of your life and your
[1:53:40] situation amen repentance always brings
[1:53:43] humility because it requires us to lay
[1:53:45] down our thoughts our ideas our way of
[1:53:48] looking at things verse 19 as many as I
[1:53:51] roll out as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:53:55] chasen
[1:53:57] Hallelujah thy rod and th staff they
[1:53:59] comfort me he says be zealous therefore
[1:54:03] and repent what's the Zeal of this final
[1:54:05] Church age you want to know somebody's a
[1:54:07] zealous Christian what do they do they
[1:54:09] repent they repent they turn around they
[1:54:12] confess and ask forgiveness and they
[1:54:13] walk in the light of the original word
[1:54:16] not with their denomination preaches but
[1:54:18] in the light of the original word
[1:54:20] forsake the denominations forsake their
[1:54:22] tradition of man forsake religion and
[1:54:24] come to Christ the word that's what he's
[1:54:26] trying to get him to do look at verse
[1:54:29] 20 he says behold I stand at the door
[1:54:32] and knock he's outside the church Christ
[1:54:35] is completely outside the church
[1:54:38] now he doesn't say if any men he says if
[1:54:41] any man hear my voice it's an individual
[1:54:44] Affair now he says if any man hear my
[1:54:47] voice and open the door I will come into
[1:54:49] him and will Su with him and he with me
[1:54:53] see he's outside the church that means
[1:54:55] you're not getting in by Church
[1:54:57] attendance by affiliation with some
[1:54:59] group you've got to meet with Christ the
[1:55:02] person amen and he always comes and
[1:55:04] reveals himself through his word through
[1:55:06] the original word of
[1:55:09] God then he always gives the great
[1:55:12] reward he says to him that overcomes
[1:55:14] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:55:17] even as I also overcame and am set down
[1:55:20] with my father in his throne listen
[1:55:22] doesn't give a prize if nobody's going
[1:55:23] to win it do you ever you ever go to the
[1:55:25] fair sometimes and they have these
[1:55:27] things I know when I was at the the
[1:55:28] Bellingham Fair down in uh in Washington
[1:55:30] one time they had uh the military was
[1:55:33] recruiting and so they set up these
[1:55:35] these tall uh horizontal bars and if you
[1:55:37] can hang on them for 2 minutes then
[1:55:39] they'll give you a 100
[1:55:41] bucks ever try and hang by for two
[1:55:43] minutes by your sweaty Palms on a steel
[1:55:46] bar few people can do it there is a
[1:55:48] trick to it but most people can't what
[1:55:50] are they trying to do they're trying to
[1:55:51] get a chance to talk to you the prize
[1:55:54] isn't there because they think someone's
[1:55:55] going to win it it's there to get people
[1:55:57] in God doesn't do that God gives a prize
[1:56:01] because there's a people ordained to win
[1:56:03] it there's a people ordained to get it
[1:56:06] he says you're going to sit with me in
[1:56:07] my throne even as I also am set down
[1:56:10] with my father in his throne he that
[1:56:13] have an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:56:15] saith to the churches remember the
[1:56:17] spirit of Truth is always thus saith the
[1:56:20] Lord it's perfect it's point there is no
[1:56:23] if Sands or buts it is direct it is
[1:56:26] clear you see so many people today
[1:56:29] remember the the real gift is already
[1:56:31] come and gone and so people are coming
[1:56:32] behind it with all these gifts of
[1:56:34] Prophecy and it is so vague I could do
[1:56:38] it so vague why because it is not the
[1:56:42] spirit of God it's a spirit of confusion
[1:56:45] it's a spirit of influence it's a spirit
[1:56:46] of Satan trying to mimic what God's
[1:56:48] trying to do and what God's already done
[1:56:50] and they come down they do these things
[1:56:52] but that the spirit of Truth is always
[1:56:53] thus sayeth the Lord remember what the
[1:56:55] scripture says in the Book of Revelation
[1:56:57] it says the testimony of Jesus is the
[1:57:00] spirit of Prophecy in other words what
[1:57:02] brings the gospel is what a spirit of
[1:57:06] Prophecy God always works through
[1:57:08] prophets it always comes by prophets it
[1:57:11] always has and it always
[1:57:14] will remember John the prophet John the
[1:57:17] Revelator on the aisle of
[1:57:20] patmas he's a prophet
[1:57:23] Christ was foran by a prophet Christ
[1:57:25] himself was a prophet he called himself
[1:57:27] I'm the son of man Paul's a son of man
[1:57:29] and then John the Revelator on the aisle
[1:57:31] of patmas and there's an angel talking
[1:57:34] to him and he goes to worship that angel
[1:57:37] and what is the Angel say don't worship
[1:57:40] me worship God I am of your brothers the
[1:57:44] prophets so God even in the Heavenly
[1:57:47] realm was using a prophet to reveal the
[1:57:50] word that's what the Spirit of Truth is
[1:57:53] it's a spirit of Prophecy showing you
[1:57:55] things to come it's the reality of the
[1:57:57] word for your time and for your season
[1:57:59] amen so that angel said don't worship me
[1:58:02] I know you think I'm God because I know
[1:58:04] all these things but it's not me I've
[1:58:06] just been given a message and I'm just
[1:58:07] sharing with you what he told me one
[1:58:09] last quote he says one of these days
[1:58:12] there's going to come a prophet to the
[1:58:13] lean Church age and you will know if he
[1:58:16] is the real one sent from God or not how
[1:58:19] he says yes you will for if he is of God
[1:58:23] he will be in that word exactly as God
[1:58:26] gave it to Paul he won't deviate from
[1:58:29] that word for a moment not by one iota
[1:58:33] he says in that last age when there will
[1:58:35] be many false prophets appearing watch
[1:58:37] and see how they keep telling you that
[1:58:39] if you don't believe them and what they
[1:58:40] say you will be lost but when that last
[1:58:44] day Prophet comes on the scene see
[1:58:46] they're pointing to themselves he says
[1:58:48] but when that last day Prophet comes on
[1:58:50] the scene if he has ch that prophet he
[1:58:53] will be crying out get back to the word
[1:58:56] or you or lost he says he won't build on
[1:59:00] a private Revelation or interpretation
[1:59:03] but on the word amen and amen amen God
[1:59:08] bless you let's stand if we
[1:59:15] would I was thinking this morning just
[1:59:19] about the ministry of that prophet
[1:59:24] and when you look at so many others you
[1:59:25] look at people like Oral Roberts in
[1:59:27] particular and some of these great faith
[1:59:29] healers that followed that Ministry and
[1:59:31] whatnot what did they do they built up
[1:59:33] this massive following and they built up
[1:59:35] universities and big headquarters and
[1:59:37] multi- multi-million dollar Ministries
[1:59:39] and all these great things and whatnot
[1:59:42] and what did he have he had a little
[1:59:44] trailer with somebody with a
[1:59:46] typewriter and that's what God was using
[1:59:49] for the
[1:59:50] age he could have had Mill millions and
[1:59:52] millions and millions of dollars and
[1:59:55] every time he turned it down because he
[1:59:56] knew it came with strings
[1:59:59] attached what was he saying get back to
[2:00:02] the
[2:00:03] word he never pointed to himself he
[2:00:06] didn't want anything he said get back to
[2:00:09] the word get that token life get the
[2:00:11] Holy Spirit get away from your church
[2:00:13] get away from your denominations get
[2:00:15] away from your Creeds get away from your
[2:00:16] ideas you don't have what you think you
[2:00:19] have come back to the word and the word
[2:00:21] will set you free and he showed what it
[2:00:24] meant to be a free Son of God Amen
[2:00:26] that's where we're at that's why we
[2:00:28] believe this message that's why we
[2:00:29] believe an end time Prophet has come and
[2:00:32] gone is because we've seen the effect of
[2:00:33] it by the word of God not just by
[2:00:36] emotions not just by feelings and
[2:00:38] Sensations hey we love to have a good
[2:00:40] time in church but that's not where it
[2:00:42] starts and that's not where it ends amen
[2:00:44] it's the word living inside of us that
[2:00:46] is the end of all end all and be all in
[2:00:49] our lives amen amen God bless you let's
[2:00:51] bow our heads Heavenly
[2:00:55] Father Lord It's Your Truth that sets us
[2:00:59] free Lord and what a struggle it can be
[2:01:01] in this flesh sometimes to go the way
[2:01:03] that this world would tell us to go to
[2:01:05] manage Our lives our finances our
[2:01:07] relationships Lord even a church Lord
[2:01:10] according to what would seem best and
[2:01:12] reasonable and logical but Lord our rest
[2:01:15] is in your word your unchanging word day
[2:01:17] by day Lord for we have seen the power
[2:01:19] that lies in it if we will just stay
[2:01:21] with it
[2:01:22] Lord I pray that we take our lives and
[2:01:24] run them today through the filter of
[2:01:26] your word Lord and where we see things
[2:01:28] that won't fit through that filter Lord
[2:01:30] that we'd let them go Lord I pray that
[2:01:32] you'd set us free from our own minds our
[2:01:34] own thinking our own opinions Lord even
[2:01:36] the emotions that cloud our judgment so
[2:01:38] many times Lord I pray that you'd help
[2:01:40] us to just sit back lord to not do
[2:01:43] anything too hastily Lord to rest on
[2:01:45] your
[2:01:46] word Lord let us not go to judge but
[2:01:50] Lord let us go and hold all things
[2:01:52] according to your word Lord commit each
[2:01:55] one into your hands Lord and move on in
[2:01:57] Grace Lord in the light that you've
[2:01:59] shown us each one I pray Lord lead us
[2:02:03] guide us Lord I need it we need it more
[2:02:06] than ever heavenly father it's a gross
[2:02:07] Darkness out there but you promised us
