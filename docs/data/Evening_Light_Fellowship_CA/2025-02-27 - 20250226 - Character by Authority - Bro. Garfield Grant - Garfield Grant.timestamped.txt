[49:19] amen amen I just want to do a
[49:24] continuation of the the topic that we
[49:27] were on the the other day um and I spoke
[49:33] with brother Bob after the service and
[49:37] brother Bob said that brother gari
[49:40] there's so much more to that you know so
[49:43] I'm kind of under his advice to you know
[49:46] take it a little bit further and also I
[49:49] was in church um I think it was last
[49:52] Sunday and you know brother John was
[49:55] preaching and he said something there
[49:57] you know and I said yes yes Lord you
[50:01] know I um tonight I'm going to use
[50:03] something that he said but then as a
[50:05] reference or in reference to the topic
[50:07] that I'll be preaching tonight and that
[50:09] is character by
[50:12] Authority you know character
[50:15] by
[50:17] Authority um I will like also to turn I
[50:22] ask Bel visel just to go with me as we
[50:25] you know uh our Bibles to Ephesian 2 and
[50:29] we will read from verses 5 and
[50:33] six and it read
[50:36] thus even when we were dead in
[50:39] sins has quit us together with Christ
[50:44] for by grace are ye
[50:46] saved and has raised us up together and
[50:50] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[50:53] in Christ Jesus you may be see seated
[50:58] tonight
[51:01] amen you know while brother John was
[51:05] preaching the other day and he make
[51:07] reference to to
[51:10] Joseph the Journey of Joseph really and
[51:14] you know it must have been something you
[51:17] know Joseph getting the dream and you
[51:21] know the dream direct exactly the plan
[51:24] of God for him in other word he could
[51:28] see by God's Vision about his
[51:33] destination that God said at the end of
[51:36] it you will sit on the
[51:39] throne all right and but you see we said
[51:42] like this really that God show him the
[51:45] hand but he didn't show him the
[51:48] process and you know and so tonight I
[51:51] like to use uh Joseph as a reference to
[51:55] you know uh a way father
[51:57] because that process is where many of us
[52:00] uh fail really but we would like to see
[52:03] exactly our position for this end time
[52:05] exactly what God has in store for us and
[52:09] so we see for this end time just like
[52:11] Joseph really we saw that you know
[52:14] brother Bram said that God you know had
[52:16] shown us the ending of the display of
[52:19] his attribute really that's what was
[52:20] revealed to us that at the end of it
[52:23] really you know after all the trials are
[52:26] over over after all the suffering and
[52:28] all of this amen hallelujah the bride
[52:31] will
[52:33] overcome you know and and you know it's
[52:35] you know it it Dawn on my heart really
[52:38] because you know the sufferings are real
[52:41] the trials are real but the glory that
[52:44] follows is real amen praise God and so
[52:48] we see God if we can catch a vision
[52:51] exactly what God saw about us really
[52:54] that this journey will end you know he
[52:57] shows the bride or or destiny you know
[53:00] that on that is on the other side or on
[53:02] the Eternal side you know as Jesus said
[53:05] he that overcome you know he will grant
[53:07] to sit with with with me in my Throne as
[53:10] I overcame and I'm sitting with my
[53:12] father you know in his St in other words
[53:14] at the end of it really there's a
[53:16] crowning moment for the bride so it
[53:19] doesn't you know the trial the suffering
[53:21] and all of us is real but at the end of
[53:23] it God said we will over come praise God
[53:29] and so he shows us by the voice of
[53:32] Malaki 4 he shows us exactly what will
[53:36] happen after the ages are
[53:38] completed you know that she was caught
[53:41] up Amen brother bam said in Revelation
[53:43] chapter 4 that she was caught up amen
[53:46] hallelujah after the ages are over after
[53:50] the experience of this life is over
[53:53] after the Suffering The the pain and the
[53:55] walls and all of this Amen brother said
[53:58] that she was caught up Hallelujah and
[54:01] God show her exactly where she will go
[54:05] you know when all of this is over that's
[54:08] a beautiful thing tonight
[54:11] Church
[54:13] Hallelujah and so we saw to the voice of
[54:16] Malachi 4 you know that God showed us
[54:19] really our position that we are now in a
[54:23] condition that you know it is called a a
[54:25] sinful condition we we we're we're in
[54:29] this condition that you know sin
[54:31] Hallelujah has taken us you know into
[54:33] into into a state where we are separated
[54:36] from God but we see
[54:39] that said that sin is really unbelief
[54:42] and this unbelief but what I'm say this
[54:45] is unbelieving the word of God you see
[54:47] Church on the Eternal side before sin
[54:50] came into the picture really all things
[54:53] were perfect because the people of God
[54:55] were living by the word of God as Jesus
[54:58] said man shall not live by bread alone
[55:01] but by every word that proceeded out of
[55:03] the mouth of God and so if we were
[55:06] living by the Eternal Word Hallelujah we
[55:09] would have continued in an eternal State
[55:12] living perfectly by the Eternal Word
[55:15] there would have been nothing of sin
[55:17] Hallelujah to disrupt the order of God
[55:20] but because of sin and what was that sin
[55:23] one word was brought in the change CH
[55:26] the parameter of things one word was
[55:30] brought in and we are here where we are
[55:33] and so because of that we know that for
[55:35] us to get back to the position there
[55:38] have to be a prophet or a word sent to
[55:41] us speaking the Eternal Word to us in
[55:44] other words we have to go back to the
[55:46] Eternal Word and so God sent a prophet
[55:51] Hallelujah to with a with with with a
[55:53] word to the bride to restore us back to
[55:56] eternity can I say to you tonight Paul
[55:59] said and tonight we are seated together
[56:02] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in
[56:04] other word we have received that Eternal
[56:07] Word and right now Hallelujah while we
[56:09] sing and we worship we create that
[56:12] Eternal atmosphere because Hallelujah
[56:15] because we have received that Eternal
[56:16] Word right now Hallelujah the angels are
[56:19] gathered Hallelujah we said the Eternal
[56:22] side is G why because we have heard from
[56:25] eternity
[56:27] and if we have the Eternal world then we
[56:30] can go back home Hall living in that
[56:33] Eternal
[56:34] position I'm trying to show you tonight
[56:37] church
[56:38] that the bride in her overcoming
[56:42] Hallelujah will be restored back to the
[56:45] Eternal
[56:46] world she will be restored back to
[56:49] that and to inner soul hallelujah
[56:53] hallelujah listen Church though we are
[56:54] living in this Mortal body
[56:57] though we are we we are conformed
[56:59] Hallelujah by by the natural phenomenons
[57:01] of this life Hallelujah but God has
[57:04] brought a word in our hearts and in our
[57:08] heart Hallelujah we know Hallelujah I
[57:11] don't know I I heard but Mark said it
[57:13] sometime but sometime you can feel the
[57:15] effect of the presence of the Lord
[57:18] sometime it makes you cry sometime it it
[57:21] makes you shout sometime it makes you
[57:23] dance what is happening eternity is
[57:25] called
[57:28] Hallelujah and so when it calls
[57:30] Hallelujah it create an atmosphere and
[57:33] you when you step into that atmosphere
[57:35] what it does to you Church it makes you
[57:37] feel Hallelujah like you're in Heaven
[57:39] Again Hallelujah we are seated together
[57:42] in Heavenly atmosphere Hallelujah by the
[57:45] Eternal presence of God we are certain
[57:49] Hallelujah that God has sent us a voice
[57:51] in this end time and so Paul in
[57:54] Ephesians 2 2 if I read it again it says
[57:58] even when we were dead in sin and
[58:00] trespasses has he equit us together with
[58:03] Christ we are made we are quitten with
[58:06] Christ We Are Made Alive by the grace of
[58:10] God and tonight church I I I I probably
[58:14] go a little bit slow because there's
[58:15] some some things I want to bring out to
[58:17] you tonight I want to show you our
[58:19] position Hallelujah that we are seated
[58:23] in Heavenly places tonight we are seated
[58:26] in Heavenly places Hallelujah We Are
[58:29] Made Alive and we are seated in Heavenly
[58:31] places in Christ Jesus so we see the
[58:34] position tonight Church Hallelujah that
[58:37] we have received as B said you know and
[58:40] I'm going to use some term that you you
[58:42] follow me a little bit and I'm saying
[58:44] this to you tonight that you understand
[58:46] just like Joseph huah God has shown us
[58:50] exactly what we will inherit and so I
[58:53] want to get that into your into your s
[58:56] tonight but after all of that there's an
[58:58] inheritance that awaits you H Hallelujah
[59:01] and so we speak of it in one sense
[59:04] tonight uh Hallelujah though we have
[59:06] hear this Mortal but but we can still
[59:08] speak uh Hal in the in the perspective
[59:11] of overcoming because we have receive th
[59:13] say the Lord and it cannot fail
[59:17] church amen and so we see for the from
[59:21] disos of the Eternal side we saw that
[59:25] God you know you know he said
[59:29] that the the God you know the The Throne
[59:32] of God which you know say it is the
[59:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost in other word
[59:38] if if I can breing that down a little
[59:39] bit to you you see when Moses met uh met
[59:44] a pillar
[59:45] fire Hallelujah in the form of the
[59:47] burning bush it was God in the form of
[59:51] the pillar of fire all right and so when
[59:54] the pillar of fire came it was at the
[59:56] time was God H was going to take his
[59:59] people out of bondage and he was going
[1:00:01] to deliver them right and so the P fire
[1:00:05] church Hallelujah is the father stone is
[1:00:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is God H
[1:00:12] in a form but you see when they saw God
[1:00:14] in that form they didn't know who he was
[1:00:17] Moses said who must I say that set me it
[1:00:20] said tell them that I am that I am in
[1:00:24] other word it was that the Great Eternal
[1:00:26] God that condescended to them Church
[1:00:29] Hallelujah to and God was getting ready
[1:00:32] to get his people out and to elevate
[1:00:35] them are you there me Church Hallelujah
[1:00:38] and so that pillar fire Hallelujah
[1:00:40] brother John said the other day
[1:00:42] Hallelujah that there was a a person
[1:00:44] that was hiding behind it it was Christ
[1:00:48] the word you know follow me a little bit
[1:00:50] as we go as I break this down a little
[1:00:52] bit so we see bam said but pillar fire
[1:00:56] that that Moses made was Christ he was
[1:00:59] made flesh in the person of Jesus
[1:01:03] Christ he came down he condescended
[1:01:07] Hallelujah in know word at one time we
[1:01:09] we didn't know who he was no one we
[1:01:12] didn't know Hallelujah who this God was
[1:01:15] but when he came down what he was doing
[1:01:17] he was getting ready to reconcile us
[1:01:19] back to
[1:01:20] himself Hallelujah and so when we saw
[1:01:23] him Hallelujah we couldn't bring a
[1:01:25] definition for him Hallelujah but we
[1:01:28] know this one thing but said Hallelujah
[1:01:30] that pillar fire got to be made flesh
[1:01:33] first to do what to redeem and to
[1:01:36] restore us back to
[1:01:39] God and so in St John 13 and verse three
[1:01:42] the Bible said and Jesus know that he
[1:01:45] that the father has given him all things
[1:01:48] in his
[1:01:49] hands he said that he was come from God
[1:01:53] and he went to God in other word god
[1:01:56] Jesus was the manifested God how you
[1:02:00] there me Church H it was God that
[1:02:02] descended it was God that was made
[1:02:05] manifested and Jesus said unto them this
[1:02:08] St John :se 42 he said and Jesus said
[1:02:11] unto them
[1:02:14] but if God were your
[1:02:17] father he would have loved me for I
[1:02:20] proceeded forth and I came forth from
[1:02:23] God neither came I of myself
[1:02:26] but he sent me he proceeded from the
[1:02:31] bosom of the father in other word God
[1:02:34] was made flesh in the person of Jesus
[1:02:38] Christ Hallelujah so the pil fire church
[1:02:42] Hallelujah was really Hal a housing that
[1:02:46] hide the
[1:02:47] person
[1:02:49] Hallelujah and Jesus preceeded the
[1:02:52] bodily form proceeded from the pillar
[1:02:55] fire
[1:02:56] that we look upon and we say that's the
[1:02:58] Son of God that's Jesus how God in his
[1:03:02] manifested form St John 16 verse
[1:03:06] 27 the Bible said for the father himself
[1:03:09] loved you because he have love me and
[1:03:12] have belied that I came out from God and
[1:03:16] I came forth from the father and I'm
[1:03:19] come into the world again I leave the
[1:03:21] world and go to the
[1:03:24] father Hallelujah and so the pill fire
[1:03:29] came down into flesh but Jesus was
[1:03:31] telling them that I am going back
[1:03:34] Hallelujah to what I was
[1:03:36] before are you there me church but now
[1:03:39] the pillar fire is here in the form of
[1:03:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost seated
[1:03:45] where in our hearts church so God the
[1:03:50] same person Jesus Hallelujah that walk
[1:03:53] the shores Hallelujah is here he has
[1:03:56] condescended and he's living in our
[1:03:58] heart by the Holy
[1:04:01] Ghost
[1:04:03] hallelujah praise God and so the Father
[1:04:06] Strong really H is here by the Holy
[1:04:10] Ghost in our
[1:04:12] heart Hallelujah so he came from God he
[1:04:17] went back to God he came from the pillar
[1:04:20] of fire Hallelujah and he was manifested
[1:04:23] in
[1:04:23] flesh Hallelujah but he he went back
[1:04:26] Hallelujah to God when Paul met him on
[1:04:29] his way to
[1:04:31] Damascus Hallelujah Paul after a
[1:04:33] question the same question that Moses
[1:04:35] asked who art thou Lord and he said I am
[1:04:41] Jesus you must be wondering where I'm
[1:04:43] going with all of this normally I Don't
[1:04:45] Preach this technical but I want you to
[1:04:49] understand see what I'm I'm going with
[1:04:50] all of this that the Throne of God came
[1:04:54] to Earth
[1:04:56] and the Throne of God when we saw it
[1:04:59] Hallelujah we could not Define it
[1:05:02] because it was all fire but when the
[1:05:05] Throne of God was made flesh it was
[1:05:07] showing that God Plan of Redemption was
[1:05:10] to move out of the spiritual form into a
[1:05:13] fleshly
[1:05:15] form are you there with me Church
[1:05:17] Hallelujah why did he do that because
[1:05:20] Hallelujah of the perspective of your
[1:05:23] Redemption Hallelujah that you got to be
[1:05:26] seated hallelujah oh he has to be seated
[1:05:29] on your heart and so when he came down
[1:05:33] Hallelujah he was making the way
[1:05:35] preparing for us to go to
[1:05:39] him
[1:05:41] hallelujah praise
[1:05:44] God to the throne
[1:05:47] Church Jesus Christ is living inside of
[1:05:51] you and
[1:05:53] I St Matthew 26
[1:05:56] and verse 6 it
[1:05:59] says that's St Matthew 26 and verse 26
[1:06:03] sorry and as they as they were
[1:06:07] eating hallelujah oh oh let let me
[1:06:10] just go through this a little
[1:06:13] bit you see when Jesus was here before I
[1:06:17] go through the scripture here let me
[1:06:18] just elaborate a little bit on it you
[1:06:21] see when Jesus was here church he knew
[1:06:26] he knew that he had to go back to
[1:06:30] God and so that last moment that last
[1:06:34] communion
[1:06:35] moment it did something that resonated
[1:06:38] our understanding of our
[1:06:40] Redemption that every time when we go to
[1:06:43] the communion table it speak of
[1:06:46] Hallelujah the position to which we will
[1:06:49] the
[1:06:51] place communion is not just heating up
[1:06:54] eating bread and drinking wine there's a
[1:06:57] greater understanding behind it
[1:07:01] Hallelujah and so Jesus in St Matthew 26
[1:07:05] and verse 22 he said and as they were
[1:07:07] eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it
[1:07:10] and break it and gave it to his
[1:07:13] disciples and said take eat this is my
[1:07:17] body and he took the cup and gave thanks
[1:07:21] and gave it unto them saying drink ye
[1:07:23] all of it for this is the blood of the
[1:07:27] new testament which it which is shed

[1:11:40] inherited he said that when he comes
[1:11:43] back in physical
[1:11:45] form oh my I could say a lot right there

[1:12:11] even in you the Bible said and he is the
[1:12:15] spirit of
[1:12:18] Truth he said that's when he comes in
[1:12:21] physical form but he's here now in
[1:12:25] spiritual form working through your body
[1:12:29] and my body that's him now he said so we
[1:12:33] see him by The Works he does they
[1:12:36] couldn't believe that he was God so he
[1:12:40] was so so he said if you can't believe
[1:12:43] me believe the works that I do for the
[1:12:46] works that I do testify that the father
[1:12:50] has sent me they couldn't believe a man
[1:12:53] being God that said just look at the
[1:12:57] works he said if I do not the works of
[1:13:00] my father what did he mean by that he
[1:13:04] said if I do not the works of my father
[1:13:06] believe me not but if you do the works
[1:13:09] of my father then believe me the father
[1:13:12] testify of me it said what was the works
[1:13:16] of the father it said what's oh accurate
[1:13:19] everything he said look exactly what he
[1:13:22] said and what he prophesied is he said
[1:13:25] perfect they know it was God God in us
[1:13:29] the hope of glory it's said oh I just
[1:13:31] love to talk about it oh my amen so
[1:13:36] listen what I'm saying to you church as
[1:13:38] we go break it down a little bit further
[1:13:41] now listen God does not have two
[1:13:46] bodies can I say that again God does not
[1:13:50] have two
[1:13:52] bodies when he took that body had a
[1:13:55] Resurrection it went off the
[1:13:57] scene are you there at the church and so
[1:14:00] the bride tonight is the body of Jesus
[1:14:05] Christ because in that body Hall of
[1:14:08] Jesus Christ God overcame everything and
[1:14:12] when he fought IR wrestle brother
[1:14:14] brother said he wrestled death IR
[1:14:16] wrestle hell IR wrestle grave he
[1:14:19] wrestled the principalities and Powers
[1:14:22] he wrestled all of them but you know
[1:14:24] what and he he
[1:14:27] overcame and when he overcame it in
[1:14:29] other words Church Hallelujah if he set
[1:14:31] the principle for himself he says that I
[1:14:34] set that same principle for you and
[1:14:37] I so he went up Hallelujah and he took
[1:14:40] that body off the seene and it stays
[1:14:43] there until so he comes back down in the
[1:14:46] form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:14:48] do what Hallelujah because Hallelujah
[1:14:52] just as how he overcame he said and if
[1:14:55] the same spirit that raised Christ from
[1:14:58] the dead dwelleth in you Hallelujah he
[1:15:01] that same spirit will quitting H your
[1:15:04] mortal
[1:15:05] bodies the spirit of God is here to

[1:15:23] just as as God cannot fail H your faith
[1:15:26] in the promised word cannot
[1:15:29] fail the bride will
[1:15:33] overcome so he took that body off the
[1:15:36] scene and he went back to the pillar of
[1:15:38] fire that's what I meant when I oh that
[1:15:41] I was mentioning earlier that pillar
[1:15:43] fire hall it had to be made flesh first
[1:15:47] Hal and when he was made flesh we know

[1:15:56] a name we know who he is we know is he
[1:15:59] is that the is the Lord Jesus Christ so
[1:16:03] he went up but now God has but calls her

[1:17:27] kingship Hallelujah to you and
[1:17:31] I he will be Crown but you can't Crown

[1:19:35] position H that the trials are real but
[1:19:38] the glory is
[1:19:39] real are you very church and Jesus is
[1:19:43] saying that this Glory that we speak of
[1:19:46] is not a glory of of un hurly
[1:19:48] inheritance but your glory of an heavly
[1:19:52] inheritance now you there the church and
[1:19:54] soam said in the message in the message
[1:19:57] Masterpiece preached
[1:20:01] 1964 butam said now we find this perfect
[1:20:06] Masterpiece that God has had completed
[1:20:10] now we notice that it was all that it
[1:20:13] was promised to be and all the promises
[1:20:17] all of the prophecies he said everything
[1:20:20] that God had made him a a promise of
[1:20:24] said thy seed shall bruise The Serpent
[1:20:26] and now he could not bruise it with the
[1:20:31] law Hallelujah he could not abuse it
[1:20:34] with the prophet but he did did it when
[1:20:38] the woman's seed became the Masterpiece
[1:20:41] it said Christ is that he was the stone
[1:20:44] that Daniel saw heed out of the mountain
[1:20:48] he was the one that could Smite he is
[1:20:52] the one that could bruise is that br who
[1:20:55] the serpent Ed Hallelujah he said his
[1:20:59] life matches exactly the life of Moses
[1:21:03] his life matches Hallelujah David he
[1:21:06] said let's see he said if it was he said
[1:21:10] if he said he is the matching
[1:21:14] pieces Hallelujah so so butam said that
[1:21:19] Jesus H is the matching pieace now you
[1:21:23] what I'm saying to you Church you see
[1:21:25] this matching piece how the Covenant has
[1:21:28] two parts to it the two parts of the
[1:21:31] Covenant H said it had to DCT tail
[1:21:35] perfectly to become one and the Covenant
[1:21:39] mark it cannot be completed and United
[1:21:42] together Hallelujah and so we know
[1:21:46] Church Hallelujah that you have received
[1:21:49] a part of the Covenant in you right
[1:21:52] now but there's another part of the cant
[1:21:55] that is seated in Heavenly places and
[1:21:58] one day Church the two pieces got to
[1:22:02] come
[1:22:03] together Hallelujah there going to be a
[1:22:06] union of the two pieces but said the two
[1:22:09] pieces got to doct
[1:22:11] tail hallelujah what am I saying to your
[1:22:14] church Hallelujah just like Jesus he
[1:22:17] overcame Church you got to
[1:22:20] overcome because according to the
[1:22:23] prophecy God says ham said the two
[1:22:27] pieces came
[1:22:29] together oh my Hallelujah and so John
[1:22:33] said 1 John 3 he said behold what manner
[1:22:36] of love the father has restored upon us
[1:22:40] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:22:43] he said therefore the world knoweth us
[1:22:45] not because it knoweth not him it's said
[1:22:48] belov it now we are the sons of God and
[1:22:52] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:22:55] but we know that Hallelujah when he
[1:22:57] shall appear we shall be like him for we
[1:23:01] shall see him as he
[1:23:04] is hallelujah when he descended
[1:23:08] Hallelujah for the
[1:23:10] Rapture said that he cannot come to the
[1:23:13] Earth in his Corporal body because God
[1:23:15] can't have two bodies on the earth at
[1:23:17] the same time and so what he did he came
[1:23:20] in the in in the atmosphere and the
[1:23:22] bride will have to leave the hurt and
[1:23:24] meet him for the two pieces to come
[1:23:27] together Hal in the here to become
[1:23:30] one hallelujah praise God and so
[1:23:34] Hallelujah we know church that these
[1:23:36] things are
[1:23:38] real so our Redemption is spoken of I'm
[1:23:42] just trying to show you that it is
[1:23:44] spoken of that that that your child that
[1:23:47] we going through Hallelujah it it mean
[1:23:49] well that God will see us
[1:23:52] through Hallelujah so the Covenant of
[1:23:55] Grace brought
[1:23:57] Perfection it was God's complete work he
[1:24:01] did to bring his bride Hallelujah to get
[1:24:04] her perfected by his own blood and did
[1:24:07] exactly according to the word that was
[1:24:10] spoken by the Lord hallelujah if I might
[1:24:12] show you just one more I know I've been
[1:24:14] on this but I'm I'm emphasizing that you
[1:24:18] understand that the bride has overcome
[1:24:22] and when she overcome she will sit with
[1:24:25] him Hallelujah and the two will become
[1:24:29] one by the Covenant that we have and
[1:24:33] just one more before before I go over
[1:24:35] into other things very important before
[1:24:38] I leave tonight Revelation 4 and verse
[1:24:42] one John said and after this I look and
[1:24:45] behold a door was opened in heaven and
[1:24:48] the first voice which I heard Hallelujah
[1:24:51] was as it were of a trumpet talking with
[1:24:53] me which said come up either and I will
[1:24:56] show you things which must be Hereafter
[1:24:58] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:25:01] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:25:05] one sat upon the throne in know I'm
[1:25:07] going to stop a little bit and break
[1:25:08] this down as we go that's what I do I
[1:25:10] teach and preach sometimes so it's a
[1:25:12] good thing Wednesday night I can do that
[1:25:14] right so John was caught up but said
[1:25:19] after this after the ages are over
[1:25:23] something came alive di in the heart of
[1:25:25] the Bride she knows where she comes from
[1:25:29] she knows where she's going and she's
[1:25:32] caught up into the revelation of the how
[1:25:36] she knows in her heart Hallelujah that
[1:25:39] she comes from God and she knows that
[1:25:42] she's going back
[1:25:45] Hallelujah glory to God and so here the
[1:25:50] Revelation Show
[1:25:52] Jesus Hallelujah that he said behold a
[1:25:55] throne and and I'm sorry that I didn't
[1:25:58] have all this quot you know but preach
[1:26:00] of on this on Revelation chapter 4 you
[1:26:03] know it's it's it's beautiful beautiful
[1:26:06] message you know this least done
[1:26:08] completely you know but for time sake
[1:26:10] I'll just say it
[1:26:12] verb but he said the first thing John
[1:26:15] saw was a throne what was the throne the
[1:26:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost in other word
[1:26:22] this is a chair
[1:26:25] let's go it's not a throne is not a
[1:26:26] chair it's it was the pillar of fire but
[1:26:30] let's say this was the throne and when
[1:26:33] John saw it it was empty no one was
[1:26:37] sitting on it but John like he take a
[1:26:40] second look and
[1:26:42] John got a further revelation of it and
[1:26:46] John said and he that sat upon it in
[1:26:49] other word the throne becomes a person
[1:26:53] it becomes the he that is sitting on the
[1:26:55] throne in other words God unveil more of
[1:26:59] a revelation hand off himself are you
[1:27:03] there church and the Bible said and he
[1:27:06] that no it mooved from just the throne
[1:27:10] the throne to he to he that was seting
[1:27:14] on the
[1:27:15] throne and it said Hallelujah and he
[1:27:18] that was set up on the throne was to
[1:27:20] look up like a
[1:27:21] Jasper h and a sing Stone
[1:27:25] but said it was Reuben and Benjamin in
[1:27:27] other word it was a covenant that was
[1:27:29] given to to Israel and there was a
[1:27:32] rainbow run about the throne in the side
[1:27:35] like an emerald I'm giving you the
[1:27:38] symbols Hallelujah you understand that
[1:27:41] it speaks to your redemption in other
[1:27:44] word there was a rainbow that around the
[1:27:47] throne but this is how I do it I'm just
[1:27:50] like this I'm very inquisitive really
[1:27:52] you know every time when the rain
[1:27:54] because I like to see the rainbow it
[1:27:57] reminds me of the Covenant of God but
[1:28:00] you notice every time you see that
[1:28:02] rainbow is always always an arch it
[1:28:05] never
[1:28:06] complete but this time when all when the
[1:28:10] bride is taken up the Covenant Church is
[1:28:15] completed in other words Church the
[1:28:17] bride has already made it she was seen
[1:28:21] in heaven she already she she was seen
[1:28:25] as an
[1:28:26] overcomer John say she has
[1:28:29] overcome hallelujah praise God so the
[1:28:33] Holy Ghost come down in us
[1:28:36] tonight to bring us into that overcoming
[1:28:40] position
[1:28:42] Hallelujah now let's get to your I
[1:28:45] tonight
[1:28:46] quickly you see the Holy Ghost came down
[1:28:49] to do a
[1:28:50] work and that work Hallelujah is a work
[1:28:54] of Grace on the
[1:28:56] inside because this bride got to be made
[1:29:00] perfect Hallelujah but this Perfection
[1:29:03] brother Mark it had to be God
[1:29:06] himself working on the inside so when he
[1:29:10] went up he came down and he started a
[1:29:13] work Hallelujah on the
[1:29:15] inside
[1:29:17] Hallelujah said but he's here now in
[1:29:20] spirit form working through your body
[1:29:23] and my body he said that's him so we can
[1:29:26] see him by the works that he does in the
[1:29:30] message Easter seal preach 1965 but said
[1:29:35] is Messianic anointed he said once
[1:29:40] believe that what is the he said what is
[1:29:44] the Messiah he said what is the Messiah
[1:29:47] he said Messiah is the anointed
[1:29:50] one and now if he could if he were was
[1:29:54] the Messiah by being the anointed one
[1:29:57] from that day to fulfill the word of God
[1:30:00] he said to be the Redeemer of the
[1:30:03] anointed one and God raised up that body
[1:30:08] and his bride is the anointed for for
[1:30:12] this day is a it's already raised with
[1:30:16] him in the resurrection because these
[1:30:19] two are one
[1:30:24] when he came down Church the anointing
[1:30:28] you know and when I speak like this
[1:30:30] because I know when we speak of the
[1:30:32] anointing is something that is
[1:30:34] overemphasized in this day you know it
[1:30:37] heeds to say that I am anointed by God
[1:30:41] but the anointing the work of the
[1:30:44] anointing of God it wasn't just to be
[1:30:47] poured upon your M natural flesh it
[1:30:50] didn't come to anoint your flesh it did
[1:30:53] not come just to anoint your spirit but
[1:30:57] he comes to anoint your
[1:30:59] soul how you there my church so the
[1:31:02] anointing upon your soul will break the
[1:31:06] Yoke I want to say something to you
[1:31:09] tonight you
[1:31:11] see with all of that Glory that I show
[1:31:14] you but now the real work
[1:31:18] begins because how can God take an
[1:31:21] unclean thing a clean thing out of an
[1:31:24] unclean thing oh can God get us into
[1:31:27] that perfect
[1:31:29] State Hallelujah but he promised by this
[1:31:33] Covenant Hallelujah of Grace brother bam
[1:31:36] said that this Blood Covenant Hallelujah
[1:31:40] is perfect the sacrifice is
[1:31:43] perfect and if that anointing is upon
[1:31:46] your soul Hallelujah and he he begins
[1:31:49] that work the work of transformation
[1:31:52] starts from the soul
[1:31:55] he anoints the soul in transforming it
[1:31:59] Hallelujah so the works Hallelujah
[1:32:02] begins on the inside you know as I break
[1:32:06] this thing down really he said that
[1:32:08] Hallelujah spoke up the the three
[1:32:11] poles Hallelujah you know you know the
[1:32:15] first pole was good it was good it was
[1:32:17] good anointing we saw great stuff from
[1:32:20] it brother John a lot of wonderful works
[1:32:23] and today people are anointed to do just
[1:32:26] the same works and it is presented today
[1:32:29] Hallelujah we saw under the second poll
[1:32:33] Hallelujah we see great anointing can I
[1:32:36] say this to you that the first poll was
[1:32:38] the ministry of Ministry of Christ but
[1:32:40] it did not produce
[1:32:44] Perfection What God want is not just a
[1:32:47] Perfection of an anointing upon your
[1:32:49] flesh our Perfection of an anointing
[1:32:52] upon your spirit
[1:32:54] but he wants Perfection when that
[1:32:56] anointing hit your
[1:33:00] [Music]
[1:33:01] soul so he Hallelujah it was to change
[1:33:05] that inner man when he came down he came
[1:33:08] to change that inner man hallelujah
[1:33:12] praise
[1:33:14] God
[1:33:16] hallelujah hallelujah praise God he was
[1:33:19] to change that inner Man From the Inside
[1:33:22] Out
[1:33:24] hallelujah praise God you
[1:33:28] see when you see these things really you
[1:33:31] know we have been to churches and we
[1:33:33] have seen you know we have seen the
[1:33:36] different platforms where you know there
[1:33:38] are so many prophets on the in the land
[1:33:40] today so many anointing in the land
[1:33:42] today you know Hallelujah but you know
[1:33:45] it wasn't you see to bring this church
[1:33:48] in other word what I'm saying to you to
[1:33:50] bring this it it's not just a work of
[1:33:53] man's and that will bring this
[1:33:56] Perfection can I say that
[1:33:59] again it's not your doing that will do
[1:34:03] it it's
[1:34:06] him can I say something to you tonight
[1:34:10] so if we are going to overcome the age
[1:34:13] into that Perfection that God is
[1:34:15] requiring Jesus Christ got to be
[1:34:18] here hallelujah and he has to be living
[1:34:22] on the inside
[1:34:24] Hallelujah to do what to do the works of
[1:34:27] God to do the works of Redemption on the
[1:34:30] inside hallelujah praise God so it
[1:34:33] wasn't meant for the body it wasn't
[1:34:34] meant for the soul for the spirit it was
[1:34:37] meant for the soul Hallelujah for God to
[1:34:40] bring the soul into a position where God
[1:34:43] can be seated and have the preeminence
[1:34:46] in the
[1:34:48] heart hallelujah praise
[1:34:50] God and I'm saying all of this now as go
[1:34:53] a little bit
[1:34:55] further the Bible said in Hebrews 9 and
[1:34:58] verse 8 the Holy Ghost this signify that
[1:35:03] the way into the holiest of all was not
[1:35:05] yet made manifest while as the first
[1:35:08] Tabernacle was yet standing in other
[1:35:11] word hallelujah it's going to take the
[1:35:13] Holy Ghost to break the cycle of
[1:35:21] sin you see it
[1:35:24] in our human Humanity
[1:35:27] really
[1:35:29] we in our
[1:35:32] hearts there are things that are in our
[1:35:36] hearts that nobody knows about
[1:35:40] it
[1:35:43] thoughts but about sometimes things
[1:35:45] comes in and it's evidence that sometime
[1:35:50] we react to
[1:35:51] it there are things that are hidden a
[1:35:54] way that nobody knows about
[1:35:57] it and to get that Soul into
[1:36:01] Perfection God had to transform it and
[1:36:05] to and to nurture it back in in a form
[1:36:08] where that Soul can reflect
[1:36:13] Christ in other word hallelujah all that
[1:36:16] is on the inside he's got to work on the
[1:36:19] inside to take some of those character
[1:36:23] that is hidden on the inside and bring
[1:36:25] forth a Christ
[1:36:27] character Hallelujah and so the Holy
[1:36:30] Ghost comes to do what to transform oh
[1:36:34] my no wonder he says in this H he said
[1:36:37] behold I stand at the door and knock is
[1:36:41] knocking at the Hard door because he
[1:36:43] want to get on the
[1:36:45] inside because you only can be saved
[1:36:48] when Christ comes on the
[1:36:51] inside hallelujah praise God God and
[1:36:54] when he comes there he comes to live so
[1:36:58] he want to get to that Soul Church to do
[1:37:00] what to transform
[1:37:02] it from what from dead
[1:37:06] Works to do what to serve the Living
[1:37:11] God
[1:37:12] hallelujah oh my and how is he going to
[1:37:16] transform that Soul he promised that he
[1:37:19] will Purge
[1:37:21] it this purging you see why it cannot be
[1:37:25] just an
[1:37:28] anointing the prophets were anointed the
[1:37:31] priests were anointed they were given
[1:37:33] the position and office to operate but
[1:37:37] there was a remembrance of the sin every
[1:37:39] year it means that there was something
[1:37:41] in their heart H that their hide that
[1:37:44] was there that nobody knows about it
[1:37:48] Hallelujah but God comes down the Bible
[1:37:51] said and he knows the imagination of the
[1:37:54] heart when he search he search into the
[1:37:57] heart and he sees the intent of the
[1:38:01] heart H and he's here Hall to change it
[1:38:05] to transform it by doing what by
[1:38:07] entering into it and and pfy it and
[1:38:10] bring it into its own reflection that is
[1:38:13] called
[1:38:15] Perfection
[1:38:16] hallelujah praise God hallelujah and
[1:38:20] that's why today we are seeing all this
[1:38:22] anointing really but the anointing is to
[1:38:24] go to the soul and to purge the man on
[1:38:27] the
[1:38:28] inside Hallelujah the hidden part to in
[1:38:31] and door the secrets Hallelujah you know
[1:38:34] sometime it's just just a reality church
[1:38:38] I have bad habits I have things ways
[1:38:41] that I I get upset sometimes I I get mad
[1:38:44] sometimes I I do see sometimes that it's
[1:38:46] not in my mind sometime I have to go
[1:38:48] back and apologize why is those thing
[1:38:50] coming out why why am I having to stop
[1:38:53] why is this thing Hallelujah why because
[1:38:56] deep down on the inside there are things
[1:38:59] there that need to be
[1:39:01] purged Hallelujah and he's calling to
[1:39:04] the heart that it must be surrendered to
[1:39:07] him that's why he came down he came down
[1:39:11] to do what to bring that Soul into a
[1:39:13] position where it can be
[1:39:16] crowned and God has determined that
[1:39:19] listen that we will overcome Hallelujah
[1:39:22] but overcoming it does not base on our
[1:39:25] own works it's him on the inside
[1:39:28] overcoming doing the work for
[1:39:31] us now you understand why when Joseph
[1:39:35] was placed in prison hallelujah
[1:39:39] hallelujah it wasn't it was a good thing
[1:39:42] to talk about the
[1:39:43] dream but I wonder how he felt when he
[1:39:46] was in prison how you felt when he was
[1:39:48] accused but God was working on him it
[1:39:52] was God's work
[1:39:54] that was to get him into the position
[1:39:56] that God speaks to him that he will
[1:40:00] overcome hallelujah praise God Amen
[1:40:04] praise God Amen I probably just you know
[1:40:08] are so much thing here but let me get
[1:40:10] get me just get to some of the main
[1:40:11] points that I want to
[1:40:13] get you
[1:40:16] see it has to take him on the scene you
[1:40:20] see Jesus was trying to let us know that
[1:40:23] and said that he just didn't understand
[1:40:26] why Jesus Keep On he said that you know
[1:40:30] he keep on refering that the works that
[1:40:32] I do he said I do it not of myself he
[1:40:35] said Jesus Keep on refering to that he
[1:40:37] said it was the father that dwelleth in
[1:40:40] me because Jesus want to take it
[1:40:43] completely off the humanity of
[1:40:45] himself and he want to bring it back to
[1:40:48] the supernatural God that it was God
[1:40:51] that was in him that was doing the work
[1:40:53] you think it was easy to be called be
[1:40:56] elob and standing there not saying
[1:40:58] anything you think it was easy that
[1:41:01] somebody smack you in the face and you
[1:41:03] walk away it's not easy humanly most of
[1:41:07] us would respond to it and that's just a
[1:41:11] reality but God was dwelling on the
[1:41:14] inside and what did he do he brought a
[1:41:17] different response than not than just a
[1:41:19] normal man would have responded right
[1:41:22] and so Jesus now under the first
[1:41:25] anointing first Paul Hallelujah he shows
[1:41:29] the healing and all of that and he shows
[1:41:31] Hallelujah the discernment and all of
[1:41:32] that but when it comes Hallelujah to
[1:41:35] that third pole which is where I want to
[1:41:37] hit tonight and this is what I'm saying
[1:41:39] to you you know it not being like on my
[1:41:41] heart I couldn't sleep because that this
[1:41:42] has been Regita in my heart really you
[1:41:47] see as I paraphrases the scriptures
[1:41:50] there St John 5
[1:41:55] Hallelujah in John 5 Jesus said
[1:42:00] Hallelujah the works that I
[1:42:04] do Hallelujah let me see if I can find
[1:42:06] it I have it here somewhere yes St John
[1:42:08] 5:
[1:42:09] 19 but Jesus said then answered Jesus
[1:42:13] and said unto them ver ver I said unto
[1:42:16] you the son can do nothing of himself
[1:42:19] but what he see the father
[1:42:22] doeth for what things soever he doeth
[1:42:25] these thing ought to doth the son
[1:42:27] likewise in other word he was saying
[1:42:30] that it's not me it's him it's the
[1:42:33] father that was doing the work now it is
[1:42:36] very important that we see that right
[1:42:38] before he brings in that that that
[1:42:41] turple Hallelujah that s John 6
[1:42:45] anointing of the turple Hallelujah he
[1:42:47] first declared to them that it's not me
[1:42:50] it's
[1:42:51] him Hallelujah
[1:42:53] and brother Mark we saw that in under
[1:42:55] that turple Hallelujah there were
[1:42:58] disciples that were with him people
[1:43:03] Believers as they were St John 6 hell
[1:43:07] they follow them they have great
[1:43:09] anointing upon their life great
[1:43:11] Ministries at one time they came back
[1:43:14] with great testimony and said Master
[1:43:18] even the devil was in subjection to us
[1:43:22] but great sign it
[1:43:25] was but when Jesus begin getting to the
[1:43:31] heart when Jesus begin hitting the
[1:43:34] heart Hallelujah he said you are clean
[1:43:38] by the words that I speak unto you he
[1:43:42] was knocking on that hard door he said
[1:43:45] that except you heat the Flesh of the
[1:43:47] son of man and drink his blood you have
[1:43:51] no life in you
[1:43:54] and the same disciples anointed men of
[1:43:58] God walked
[1:44:01] away you
[1:44:04] see this age B Mark is one in pecul it's
[1:44:08] very
[1:44:09] pecul
[1:44:12] because in an in an environment of
[1:44:15] people Everyone are gathered nobody can
[1:44:20] differentiate I can't point from here
[1:44:22] and said brother Mark you will not go or
[1:44:24] sister Mar you will go brother John you
[1:44:26] I can't do
[1:44:28] that but under this
[1:44:31] anointing in this age that we're living
[1:44:34] in the god that descended under the
[1:44:38] revealing of the word is entering into
[1:44:41] the heart and what he's doing is using
[1:44:45] the very
[1:44:46] words and the word that he speak
[1:44:50] Hallelujah hit the heart and cast the
[1:44:52] supper
[1:44:54] reparation Hallelujah in other word what
[1:44:57] I'm saying
[1:44:59] hallelujah there will
[1:45:02] be people who will come will hear and
[1:45:07] they will walk away from it you know why
[1:45:11] because of the word that is
[1:45:14] spoken now what I'm saying to you is
[1:45:16] very
[1:45:17] important
[1:45:19] because I would want to be be the one
[1:45:21] that separate but go that's not it it's
[1:45:24] God that is doing the
[1:45:26] separation and so when the word is
[1:45:29] preached something Hallelujah must hit
[1:45:32] home in the heart Hallelujah so he had
[1:45:38] about 60 disciples there about that
[1:45:40] walked away Hallelujah and when Jesus
[1:45:44] look at them you can imagine how
[1:45:46] sorrowful he must have been in his heart
[1:45:48] they were with him every time that slept
[1:45:51] to them he gave them power he did all of
[1:45:54] this great thing and it was greatly
[1:45:57] appreciated but now when it comes down
[1:46:00] to crunch time when it comes down to
[1:46:03] Redemption of the soul the word must
[1:46:07] bring a separation and it
[1:46:10] will because the word will go into the
[1:46:14] heart to do what to transform it so
[1:46:18] Jesus was there and he was sing them
[1:46:22] except your heat my My Flesh and drink
[1:46:25] my blood you have no life in you in
[1:46:28] other word you will die and when they
[1:46:31] heard it they walk away and walk no more
[1:46:35] with him you can't imagine that walk No
[1:46:38] More Jesus was watching them throwing
[1:46:42] down whatsoever they had and shaking
[1:46:44] their head and said no no no we can't
[1:46:46] accept this we can what was happening
[1:46:49] Church you see when it comes to the
[1:46:52] blessing
[1:46:54] it belongs to the bride and God will
[1:46:57] bring the condition of
[1:47:00] Separation God will bring something in
[1:47:03] that when they hear it they will walk
[1:47:05] away from it they said no no no no no we
[1:47:08] can't take that and Jesus was there
[1:47:10] watching them and so Jesus turned to the
[1:47:14] 12 I mean recite all at all time as if
[1:47:18] you know Jesus was was boasting in
[1:47:20] saying it but but but I felt his
[1:47:24] sorrow when he turned to the 12 and said
[1:47:28] will you also
[1:47:31] go will you accept the word of God will
[1:47:34] you allow the word of God to go on the
[1:47:36] inside and change your life and Peter
[1:47:40] turned and said
[1:47:41] Master where shall we go for you have
[1:47:45] the word of eternal
[1:47:48] life and you know what Jesus said but
[1:47:51] have I not chosen you 12
[1:47:54] and one of you here he said one of you
[1:47:57] among the 12 he said is a
[1:48:00] devil who could have thought that Judas
[1:48:03] was a
[1:48:04] devil Judas did everything right in the
[1:48:07] perspective of the high of
[1:48:09] man but when the word comes it discerns
[1:48:13] the heart there's no secret that is
[1:48:16] hidden from
[1:48:18] him hallelujah what what what am I
[1:48:20] saying to you I had something to read
[1:48:23] you know uh quickly before we close in
[1:48:26] the book of Jud Judges chapter
[1:48:29] 7 verse one he said then
[1:48:33] jabal who is Gideon and all the people
[1:48:36] that were with him rose up early and
[1:48:39] Pitch beside the well of Abra aod so
[1:48:43] that the host of the minites were on the
[1:48:47] north side of them by the hill of Mor in
[1:48:51] the valley and the Lord said unto Gideon
[1:48:54] the people that are with thee are too
[1:48:57] many for me to give the menites into
[1:49:00] into their hand lest Israel v thems
[1:49:04] against me saying mine own hand have I
[1:49:07] saved
[1:49:09] me
[1:49:10] hallelujah hallelujah so it's God was
[1:49:14] saying here listen that listen
[1:49:16] Hallelujah for this Victory Gideon it's
[1:49:19] not you it's not the people it's me I am
[1:49:22] the one that is going to fight your
[1:49:23] battles for
[1:49:24] you hallelujah hallelujah verse three
[1:49:28] said now therefore go go to and Proclaim
[1:49:32] in the ears of the people saying
[1:49:34] whosoever is fearful and Afraid let him
[1:49:37] return and depart early from Mount
[1:49:40] Gilead and their
[1:49:43] return of the people
[1:49:48] 22,000 and there remain it 10,000 and
[1:49:51] the Lord said and to Gideon the people
[1:49:54] are yet too many bring them down unto
[1:49:57] the water and I will try them for
[1:50:00] Hallelujah for for the for the sake and
[1:50:04] it shall be that of whom I say unto thee
[1:50:08] Hallelujah this shall go with thee and I
[1:50:11] want you to understand that it was God
[1:50:13] himself that was making the
[1:50:16] condition it wasn't Gideon anymore it
[1:50:18] was God and God said and I will say unto
[1:50:21] thee and whosoever I I say unto thee
[1:50:25] this shall not go with thee and the same
[1:50:28] shall not go so he brought down the
[1:50:31] people onto the water and the Lord said
[1:50:33] unto Gideon every man that lth after the
[1:50:37] water with his Tong as a dog lapet him
[1:50:41] shall thou set by himself likewise every
[1:50:45] man that bow down on his knee to drink
[1:50:49] and the number of them that lap oh my
[1:50:53] putting their hands in into their mouth
[1:50:56] were three 300 men but all the rest of
[1:51:00] the people bow down unto their need
[1:51:02] needes to drink and the Lord said unto
[1:51:04] Gideon by the by the 300 men that has
[1:51:09] laed will I save you and deliver the
[1:51:12] midianites into thine hand and let all
[1:51:15] the the other the people go every man
[1:51:18] onto his
[1:51:20] place God set the condition
[1:51:24] under this turple under this ministry
[1:51:26] under this
[1:51:28] time the Redemption that God has
[1:51:30] promised to bring the church into the
[1:51:34] perspective
[1:51:36] Hallelujah God is the one as he's doing
[1:51:39] it and he's doing it Church by his own
[1:51:43] word it's one of the most unfamiliar
[1:51:46] thing telling somebody about Jesus
[1:51:48] Christ today about the prophet that was
[1:51:51] sent to us about an anointing that is
[1:51:53] here in the land and you know what they
[1:51:56] sit there and they don't hear
[1:51:59] you you know why because the words that
[1:52:02] you speaking that's spoken to them it
[1:52:05] cannot reach the
[1:52:07] heart so to bring this church in closing
[1:52:10] tonight to bring this church into the
[1:52:13] prospective of
[1:52:15] redemption he promise that he will work
[1:52:18] on the heart the bride will hear God's
[1:52:21] voice Hallelujah and God will come and
[1:52:25] dwell on the inside and God will set the
[1:52:28] work God will stir the Fate God will
[1:52:32] bring the
[1:52:33] transformation God will bring himself
[1:52:35] out the people of God hallelujah who
[1:52:38] hear God's word will come forth and live
[1:52:41] in this end time and by the hands of God
[1:52:45] hallelujah not the hands of man not just
[1:52:48] an anointing but by the presence of God
[1:52:51] he will bring what Hallelujah by his own
[1:52:54] work the the manifestation of him his
[1:52:58] own self through the bride to bring us
[1:53:01] into that position where we can say he's

[1:53:08] Hallelujah so he comes to bring us
[1:53:12] there Hallelujah because the only way we
