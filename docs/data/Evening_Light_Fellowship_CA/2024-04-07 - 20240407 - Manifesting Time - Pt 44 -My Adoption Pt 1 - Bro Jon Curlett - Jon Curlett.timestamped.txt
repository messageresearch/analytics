[45:26] pain that he's taking away in these
[45:27] different things it's wonderful to see
[45:29] her amen it's good to have Marilyn
[45:32] Taylor with us she's an old neighbor of
[45:33] ours old meaning from a long time ago of
[45:37] course amen but uh known to my family
[45:40] for many years and so it's good to see
[45:42] her here this morning amen and then we
[45:44] have sister relle here looking happy and
[45:47] healthy with baby annah amen God bless
[45:49] you it's good to see you as well and man
[45:51] I remember when we had Samuel last and
[45:54] Blanca just kind of went downstairs and
[45:56] she stayed in the spare bedroom for
[45:57] weeks on end and of course Co ended up
[45:59] shutting us down but boy when that baby
[46:01] comes the mama just wants to just settle
[46:03] in with it and leave her alone and just
[46:05] let them Bond and grow together but uh
[46:08] eventually they have to come out of
[46:09] their cocoons and be with the rest of us
[46:10] and so we see you here this morning we
[46:12] say God bless you it's good to see you
[46:14] and see brother Josh standing proudly
[46:16] smiling there as if it was all his work
[46:19] amen amen but it's good to have them
[46:22] here amen certainly appreciate each one
[46:24] that went to the funeral for brother
[46:25] Ivan Brenton this last week and uh we
[46:29] didn't have church on Wednesday here but
[46:30] we had church at the funeral brother
[46:32] Luke Gibson just spoke a tremendous
[46:34] short message there and sure enjoyed
[46:37] that and then coming back we had a
[46:38] blizzard for the last hour and it was uh
[46:41] it was pretty tight going there for a
[46:42] while brother Luke almost lost his truck
[46:44] there he said he had a pretty scary
[46:46] moment called us up and asked what do I
[46:48] do and we said put it in four-wheel
[46:50] drive and you'll you'll get it all
[46:51] worked out so he slowed down and and uh
[46:54] he made it safely and each one of us did
[46:55] so we thank the Lord for that amen we
[46:58] certainly want to remember brother Ron
[47:00] Spencer he had a second heart attack in
[47:02] in hospital they put in three stints now
[47:04] I believe he's home resting but quite
[47:06] weak so we certainly want to remember
[47:09] him as well amen God bless you this
[47:11] morning Ephesians
[47:12] 2:4 we see here the full timeline of the
[47:15] children of God from glory to glory and
[47:17] Paul says this but God who is rich in
[47:19] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[47:22] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[47:25] had quickened us together with Christ by
[47:28] grace are ye are saved he says and ha
[47:30] raised us up together and made us sit
[47:33] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[47:35] Jesus no say raised us up together it's
[47:39] not just one person not just one
[47:42] Ministry it's not just one church amen
[47:43] but it's a body it's a group that's done
[47:45] this he says that in the ages to come he
[47:48] might show the exceeding Riches of his
[47:50] grace in his kindness towards us through
[47:53] Christ Jesus he says for by Grace ye are
[47:56] you saved save through faith and that
[47:58] not of yourselves it is the gift of God
[48:01] not of Works lest any man should boast
[48:03] for we are his workmanship created in
[48:06] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[48:09] had before ordained that we should walk
[48:12] in them amen God bless you you can have
[48:14] your seats this morning and we're
[48:16] getting back to our series we've been
[48:17] talking about the manifestation of the
[48:19] sons of God or the manifesting time and
[48:21] I want to take a title of my adoption
[48:23] and we've been speaking on the adoption
[48:25] of the sons and daughters of God of the
[48:27] children of God and I want to make this
[48:29] personal now as we start to get to the
[48:31] end of this series and the next few
[48:33] Services Lord willing we want to get
[48:35] very personal we want to get down to
[48:36] where you're at where I'm at what our
[48:38] position is what it looks like what the
[48:40] purpose is and these different things
[48:42] and so I want to just read a couple
[48:44] quotes here before we get back into the
[48:46] the meat of this and and he would say
[48:48] you are first born into the kingdom he
[48:51] says by the Holy Ghost how many knows
[48:53] that all right and then he says the next
[48:55] you are predestinated to what adoption
[48:59] what is that he says you're
[49:00] predestinated unto the placing he would
[49:02] say you're baptized with the Holy Spirit
[49:04] you're filled with the Holy Spirit and
[49:05] that's purpose is to take you now to a
[49:08] positional place which is adoption amen
[49:10] we know that adoption in the scriptures
[49:13] just for the sake of those that haven't
[49:14] been sitting here for the last year
[49:15] listening to the preachings on this
[49:17] adoption in the scriptures was not as if
[49:19] you take a child that's outside of the
[49:21] family and bring it in as we have it
[49:22] today but adoption in the Eastern
[49:24] tradition was that you would take a a
[49:26] child that is already a part of the
[49:28] family you would train them you would
[49:29] develop them you would bring them to
[49:31] maturity and then you would adopt them
[49:33] you would place them in a position of
[49:35] responsibility in the family business in
[49:37] the family farm and the family Affairs
[49:39] and they would work as the father did
[49:42] their purpose was to take the authority
[49:43] of the father now and use it for the
[49:46] benefit of the body amen and so then the
[49:48] prophet of God would say this he says
[49:50] God and all creation is waiting for the
[49:52] church positionally to positionally find
[49:55] its place man the scripture says that
[49:57] creation is groaning for the
[49:59] manifestation of the sons of God
[50:01] everything's looking for us to find our
[50:03] place in Christ not find our place as we
[50:05] determine it or the way we think we
[50:07] ought to do it or or the talents we have
[50:09] or the good things we bring to the table
[50:11] but for God to place us where and with
[50:13] whom and in the place that he wants us
[50:16] to be amen that's what spiritual
[50:18] adoption is adoption is not about me
[50:21] it's when I come to a place that he can
[50:23] use me for the sake of the body and a
[50:25] person that comes into a adoption is
[50:27] thinking about others not themselves
[50:29] that's what we'll find is adoption now
[50:31] is for the benefit of everyone around us
[50:33] and so if we're coming to a place where
[50:35] we think we're adopted in in our
[50:37] position in Christ or we're about to be
[50:39] ready and all we can think about is me
[50:41] me me let me say we're not ready amen
[50:43] it's not about me it's about others that
[50:45] are around us amen we're supposed to be
[50:47] living our lives for others and Christ
[50:49] did that and he said that as I've done
[50:51] you should do as well amen that we're
[50:53] supposed to be a servant it says he came
[50:55] down and being Lord of all he made
[50:56] himself servant of all amen that's the
[50:59] nature that we're supposed to have and
[51:01] he would say this he says when we
[51:03] receive the Holy Ghost it isn't to jump
[51:05] up and down and Shout with it isn't just
[51:08] to speak with tongues or run over the
[51:09] floor it isn't to organize a group and
[51:12] say we got it and the rest of you
[51:14] haven't that's a great danger when you
[51:16] have truth is to stand on the fact that
[51:18] you have truth and let that be the
[51:19] deciding factor what have you're doing
[51:21] what are you doing with the truth what
[51:23] has it done to you more importantly
[51:25] anden if you have it and it's not doing
[51:26] anything then is it really the
[51:28] truth he says but rather it's to work
[51:32] the Holy Spirit has given to us to work
[51:34] how with love and humility as Christ
[51:37] come to do he says by this will all men
[51:39] know that you are my disciples when you
[51:41] have love one for another that will
[51:43] cancel out a lot of people that think
[51:45] they've got something special if they
[51:47] can't even love somebody if they can't
[51:49] do what's best for that person if they
[51:51] can't in humility present what God has
[51:53] given to them rather than flare up as
[51:56] soon as it's rejected or as soon as they
[51:57] face hard times of persecution from
[52:00] people but I want to take us back now to
[52:02] Ephesians to settle this thought on our
[52:04] adoption this morning and in Ephesians 4
[52:06] Paul would say this he says but speaking
[52:08] the truth in love he's speaking about
[52:10] the body of Christ we may grow up into
[52:13] him in all things which is the head even
[52:16] Christ he said from whom the whole body
[52:18] fitly joined together and compacted by
[52:21] that which every joint supplieth
[52:23] according to the effectual working in
[52:25] the measure of every part maketh
[52:27] increase of the body under the edifying
[52:29] of itself in love I've always said this
[52:31] is one of the most difficult scriptures
[52:32] to understand it's such a long sentence
[52:34] it's a run-on sentence but I want to
[52:36] take that bit that I've underlined there
[52:37] because that's the part we want to focus
[52:39] on because Paul says we're a whole body
[52:41] that's supposed to be joined together
[52:43] fitly joined together it means we fit
[52:46] without interference we're not rubbing
[52:48] we're there's no friction there but each
[52:51] is in its place and in its season and in
[52:53] its proper function and they get in
[52:55] there and there's no friction now when
[52:57] God does it that's the way that God
[52:59] joins us together and we're compacted
[53:01] everything is tightly knit together I
[53:03] hurt my shoulders many of you know
[53:05] playing hockey about 6 weeks ago and
[53:07] guess what it's not tightly knit
[53:09] together anymore when I hit it the
[53:11] impact stretched the tendons it
[53:13] stretched the ligaments and now this
[53:15] shoulder does things that I don't want
[53:16] it to do and I've got to build it back
[53:19] and strengthen it and restore it back to
[53:20] what it was supposed to be but when God
[53:23] does it God makes everything compact so
[53:25] that it works and it stays in its
[53:27] position but this under part this is
[53:29] what we're looking for when it comes to
[53:31] maturity and adoption he says when each
[53:35] part I'm not responsible for you and
[53:38] you're not responsible for me I'm
[53:40] responsible for me Lord where do you
[53:42] want me to be and what do you want me
[53:43] doing and how do you want me to do it
[53:46] says when each part now it says with
[53:48] power adapted to its need so in other
[53:52] words I have the power I need and you
[53:56] have the power you need and where you
[53:58] need my help I give you what I have to
[54:01] help you do what you need as well if I
[54:03] go to bend over and pick something up
[54:06] I've got to use my arm muscles I've got
[54:07] to use my back muscles I've got to use
[54:09] my stabilizing muscles each one works
[54:12] together and if one of them Works harder
[54:14] than it ought to what causes is
[54:16] imbalance and I'll lean over and either
[54:18] I won't be able to pick up or I'll fall
[54:21] over why because I've overexerted or
[54:24] undere exerted I've applied too much
[54:25] power or not enough and then it's not
[54:28] functional he says but with power
[54:30] adapted to its need is working properly
[54:32] in all of its functions and grows to
[54:35] full maturity building itself up in what
[54:41] love love is the motive Divine love it's
[54:43] the Holy Spirit itself so in other words
[54:46] when we are positionally placed our
[54:48] purpose is always to help the body of
[54:50] Christ to make it operate in its proper
[54:53] function amen the purpose of each one of
[54:55] us being here is to help the body
[54:58] operate now whether we realize it or not
[55:01] we are all here for a purpose and we're
[55:03] not here to be a freak body there's a
[55:06] there's a you see these people and
[55:08] there's a well-known arm wrestler and
[55:10] he's a left-handed arm wrestler and his
[55:12] left arm is freakishly huge it's a
[55:14] genetic um um error in his body that has
[55:17] given him massive muscles on the left
[55:19] side and his forearm is just like this
[55:21] and then he's got this huge
[55:23] bicep and and it's he's a freak that's
[55:26] not the way the body's supposed to be
[55:28] how do we become a freak Body of Christ
[55:30] when we focus on one thing when we say
[55:34] this is the way we like it this is the
[55:35] way we want it this is the way it's got
[55:37] to be and then we just what we
[55:39] absolutely cause a weakness in the rest
[55:41] of the body because it's not developing
[55:44] we're so focused on what we like or what
[55:45] we have natural talents for or where the
[55:47] ease is and so what happens is we build
[55:50] up that which is good and we neglect
[55:52] that which is not and we Overlook our
[55:54] weaknesses and we could become afraid
[55:56] freak and it leads to sickness it leads
[55:58] to strain it it leads to breaks and
[55:59] these different things divisions amongst
[56:01] us amen we're supposed to be a body in
[56:04] balance a body in Harmony and that can
[56:06] only be done by the holy spirit because
[56:09] if the holy spirit's working in you and
[56:10] the holy spirit's working in me then
[56:12] there's no friction we work together and
[56:14] we compliment each other I don't mean
[56:16] compliment as in you look very good
[56:18] today I mean we support each
[56:21] other what you do and what I do is
[56:23] additive rather than destructive
[56:26] that what you do adds to what I'm doing
[56:28] and what I'm doing adds to what you're
[56:30] doing and neither one detracts but
[56:32] everything works together in its in its
[56:34] in its good intentions amen listen to
[56:37] this he says in the church God has set
[56:39] people in the church for different
[56:41] things he says some of them for teachers
[56:43] Apostles prophets Gifts of healing
[56:46] speaking with tongues interpretation of
[56:48] tongues and different gifts that he God
[56:50] has set in the church as it pleased him
[56:52] he says it's all for one purpose to
[56:55] edify the body to edify the church to
[57:00] bring us together to make us love him
[57:03] more when somebody says I have a
[57:07] gift and that gift only points to
[57:09] themselves you know what I say that
[57:11] ain't a
[57:13] gift because you're not edifying the
[57:15] body with it you're edifying
[57:17] yourself that's why Paul would tell them
[57:19] don't speak with tongues all the time
[57:21] you're not edifying anybody you're just
[57:23] causing confusion nothing wrong with
[57:24] speaking tongues it's part of uh of the
[57:26] Christian experience we believe but if
[57:28] you speak in tongues and none interprets
[57:30] he says nobody's edified except for
[57:32] you that's it so the purpose of a gift
[57:35] the purpose of a a person or portion of
[57:37] the body is to edify is to build up
[57:41] that's what it means to edifies to build
[57:42] up to strengthen to support the body of
[57:45] Christ and so the more mature we get as
[57:47] we get into a place of stepping into
[57:49] adoption or as we're adopted our focus
[57:52] is on the benefit of the body and not
[57:54] ourselves amen it's a life of sacrifice
[57:57] it's a life of surrender and I want to
[57:59] speak this morning just to kind of set
[58:01] up us up generally with what God's
[58:03] trying to do with adopted Sons and
[58:05] Daughters of his and what the end goal
[58:06] is because if we can see his purpose we
[58:09] can see how we fit in it see what
[58:11] happens I think with adoption as we look
[58:12] at this is people think it's some lofty
[58:15] thing that can only be attained at the
[58:17] very end of your
[58:18] life and then you wonder what the other
[58:21] 70 years or 60 years are spent doing
[58:23] preparation preparation preparation but
[58:25] if you see in the scriptures you'll see
[58:27] that there's always a time of training
[58:28] and testing but there's a time of
[58:30] walking in your position and you look at
[58:33] people like David you look at people
[58:34] like Joseph you look at Samuel you look
[58:37] at these different ones you look at the
[58:38] the Apostle Paul yes they had times
[58:41] where they were training but God wants
[58:42] to bring us into position because it's
[58:45] needed to help the body function the
[58:47] goal is not to take us to old age and
[58:49] then adopt us the goal is to get us to
[58:51] his position and his placing in the word
[58:53] so that he can use us for the benefit
[58:56] the goal is not to exclude us the goal
[58:57] is to get us working for his kingdom by
[59:00] the power of the Holy Spirit In Our
[59:01] Lives amen I believe God's goal is to
[59:03] get us to that place as quickly as
[59:06] possible but it's in his time and in his
[59:08] season not in ours now Paul would talk
[59:11] about this in Romans 12 now he's talking
[59:13] about the body and the different parts
[59:15] of it he says I beseech you Brethren
[59:17] therefore by the mercies of God that you
[59:20] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[59:23] holy acceptable unto God which is the
[59:25] reason able service you control what
[59:27] comes in and what goes out you control
[59:30] what has access to you and he says
[59:31] that's your reasonable service you
[59:33] protect this Natural Body I was speaking
[59:36] to somebody yesterday and they were
[59:38] asking you know how do these things get
[59:39] on a person how does a Believer get a a
[59:42] demon on them or or get a habit on them
[59:44] and I say there's two ways we can do it
[59:46] we walk through this Earth and we get
[59:48] dirty we talked about this in communion
[59:50] you walk through this life and you get
[59:51] dirty I said you can't I can't walk
[59:53] through them all and not get dirty it's
[59:56] filth everything is filth the music is
[59:59] filth the the ads are filth the clothing
[1:00:01] is filth everything is Satan's kingdom
[1:00:04] it's Satan's Eden and so you walk
[1:00:06] through that and I can't help what I see
[1:00:08] I can help what I see the second time
[1:00:11] but the first time I don't know I don't
[1:00:13] know what's walking around I don't know
[1:00:14] what I'm going to see who I'm going to
[1:00:15] see what clothes they're wearing what
[1:00:16] they're going to be doing and so you
[1:00:18] walk around and you do and you see
[1:00:20] things you're at work you're going to
[1:00:21] see people you're going to hear people
[1:00:23] you're going to get involved in things
[1:00:25] that you have no control over and it has
[1:00:28] access now to your body it has access to
[1:00:30] your life and so sometimes those things
[1:00:32] can jump on and that's why we need the
[1:00:34] continuous washing of the Water by the
[1:00:36] word is to push those things back away
[1:00:38] and say that doesn't belong in a
[1:00:40] believer's life but now if I open up my
[1:00:44] life then Satan's allowed to come in if
[1:00:47] I open it up by entertainment if I open
[1:00:50] it up by music if I open it up by
[1:00:51] relationship if I open it up by whatever
[1:00:54] it might might be and I open that door
[1:00:56] up and I say I'm going to allow this
[1:00:58] into my life then every Spirit attached
[1:01:01] to that has access to my life
[1:01:03] now and all it takes is one hit you look
[1:01:07] at things like cocaine and whatnot one
[1:01:09] hit and people are hooked for life and
[1:01:11] what happens is a habit conform and it's
[1:01:14] by my access I allowed it into my life
[1:01:17] and the only thing that'll put it out is
[1:01:19] when I say I don't want it anymore
[1:01:21] insincerity
[1:01:23] insincerity and that's why we preach the
[1:01:25] word straight we don't pull back we
[1:01:27] don't say well we'll allow this no no no
[1:01:29] if the word says we don't do it we don't
[1:01:31] do it amen and we ought to be able to
[1:01:33] say to each other we ought not to be
[1:01:35] doing this you ought not to be doing it
[1:01:37] I not not to be doing it but that's
[1:01:39] access and that's the things that we
[1:01:40] have Paul says our reasonable C
[1:01:42] sacrifice is or reasonable service is to
[1:01:45] keep our lives clean as much as we can
[1:01:49] but he says and be not conformed to this
[1:01:51] world but be ye transformed by the
[1:01:53] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:01:55] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:01:58] perfect will of God good acceptable and
[1:02:02] perfect only God can do that and you've
[1:02:05] got to tap into his wisdom you got to
[1:02:07] tap into his will to do it he says for I
[1:02:09] say through the grace given unto me that
[1:02:12] to every man that is among you not to
[1:02:14] think of himself more highly than he
[1:02:16] ought to think but to think soberly
[1:02:20] according as God had dealt to every
[1:02:23] man the Measure of Faith see we want to
[1:02:28] read that a Measure of Faith but there's
[1:02:30] a there's a there's a great mystery
[1:02:32] behind what he says here he says The
[1:02:34] Measure of Faith because it isn't just
[1:02:36] The Measure of Faith it is the measure
[1:02:38] of Faith it's specific in where it comes
[1:02:40] from and what it
[1:02:42] is the prophet of God would say this he
[1:02:45] says in Acts 3:16 when Peter was asked
[1:02:47] how the mighty Miracle had taken place
[1:02:49] upon the crippled one at the gate
[1:02:50] beautiful he explained it on this wise
[1:02:53] and his Jesus name through faith in his
[1:02:56] Jesus name Ha made this man this formal
[1:02:58] strong yay the faith which is by
[1:03:01] or from him had given him this man this
[1:03:04] perfect soundness in the presence of you
[1:03:06] all he says see there it is jesus' name
[1:03:09] and Jesus Faith brought about the
[1:03:11] miracle he says Peter did not claim it
[1:03:14] was his own human Faith anymore than he
[1:03:17] claimed it was his own name he said that
[1:03:19] Jesus name used in the faith which is
[1:03:21] from Jesus perform that great work this
[1:03:24] faith is what the Lord was speaking
[1:03:26] about in Revelations 2:13 it was his
[1:03:29] faith it was not faith in him but it was
[1:03:32] his own faith that he had given to the
[1:03:35] Believers amen if there's something we
[1:03:37] need to produce the word in this age
[1:03:38] it's the Faith of Christ amen we have
[1:03:41] salvational faith and you'll see
[1:03:42] salvational faith is unto
[1:03:46] something but now we come in and as
[1:03:48] adopted Sons and Daughters as mature
[1:03:50] Christians that have been filled with
[1:03:51] the spirit of God we don't just have
[1:03:53] faith unto something but we have the
[1:03:55] faith of something we have the faith of
[1:03:57] someone amen we have the Faith of Christ
[1:03:59] why because the same spirit that indwell
[1:04:02] him indwells us and that means the same
[1:04:04] faith that goes along with it must also
[1:04:05] accompany it anden if I have the faith
[1:04:08] of if I have the spirit of Christ Paul
[1:04:11] says now if if I have the spirit of
[1:04:13] Christ and I think I do anden if we have
[1:04:15] the spirit of Christ then the faith that
[1:04:17] comes with that must be in us as well so
[1:04:20] we are not sitting here by our own
[1:04:21] mental Faith by our own human Faith
[1:04:23] we're not acting that but we're acting
[1:04:25] on the spirit of God that brings his
[1:04:27] faith to us that makes all things
[1:04:29] possible amen it's not a faith it's the
[1:04:31] faith so Paul says every single one of
[1:04:34] us has The Measure of Faith when we get
[1:04:38] the Holy Spirit it is God putting his
[1:04:40] own life inside of us and with that
[1:04:42] comes the faith of God as well that all
[1:04:45] things are possible to them who will
[1:04:47] believe now listen to this it says now
[1:04:50] coming from the Holy Spirit now brother
[1:04:51] bam here is talking about the stature of
[1:04:53] a perfect man and he's gone all the way
[1:04:54] through what we have here in second
[1:04:56] Peter 1 and you know you've got your
[1:04:58] faith virtue knowledge Temperance and
[1:04:59] these things he says that's all in a man
[1:05:01] and then a holy spirit comes he says
[1:05:03] then he will give to you Supernatural
[1:05:06] Faith spiritual Faith here at the bottom
[1:05:08] he says you have these attributes and
[1:05:10] they're in you because you're a son or
[1:05:11] daughter of God from the beginning of
[1:05:13] the world Amen you have a word seat
[1:05:15] inside of you he ordained you before the
[1:05:17] foundation of the world Amen he chose us
[1:05:20] in him he says all of that has come out
[1:05:22] and it's a working of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:24] then what happens is the the Holy Spirit
[1:05:26] comes and it's poured in on those things
[1:05:29] and it changes it from what you have to
[1:05:32] what he
[1:05:33] has amen so what happens he says now is
[1:05:36] that you have an attribute by this by by
[1:05:39] the nature that's in you of God you've
[1:05:41] got a seat of God inside of you in the
[1:05:43] Holy Spirit the word brings this out of
[1:05:45] you he says but he's got to come in and
[1:05:47] take it from like God to
[1:05:51] God Amen cuz it's Christ in us the hope
[1:05:54] of glory it's not now going to be my
[1:05:56] faith it's got to be his faith it's not
[1:05:57] going to be my virtue it's going to be
[1:05:59] his virtue that's what takes us through
[1:06:01] the storms of life that's what takes us
[1:06:03] through the difficulties is Christ in us
[1:06:06] not me and me me and me fails me and me
[1:06:09] falls down me and me gets desponded me
[1:06:11] and me falls into despair me and me gets
[1:06:14] offended and hurt and holds ourselves
[1:06:17] back but it's Christ in me that keeps me
[1:06:19] going no matter what amen he says now
[1:06:22] then that spiritual Faith recognizes
[1:06:24] only the word no matter what anybody
[1:06:27] else says it don't do any good that only
[1:06:29] knows the word if somebody says the days
[1:06:31] of Miracles pass that Faith only knows
[1:06:33] the word somebody says there's no such
[1:06:35] thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:37] that Faith only knows the word that's
[1:06:39] real spiritual Faith you see that's
[1:06:42] right see it only knows the word he says
[1:06:44] and that was number one that's your
[1:06:46] faith then he's got to do it with
[1:06:47] knowledge and these things he says
[1:06:48] number one coming to you your mental
[1:06:51] Faith that's what we had really was a
[1:06:53] mental faith it was something in US yes
[1:06:55] it's from God it's a working of God but
[1:06:57] it's just
[1:06:58] this but it's now got to be more he says
[1:07:01] uh your mental Faith here comes the Holy
[1:07:03] Spirit coming down into your mental
[1:07:05] Faith making it a spiritual
[1:07:08] Faith that's what we're looking for
[1:07:10] that's the anchor is when he comes down
[1:07:13] and he seals it and he makes it his it's
[1:07:15] not now my attribute it's his attribute
[1:07:18] it's not my life it's his life it's not
[1:07:20] my power it's his power it's not my
[1:07:22] inspiration it's his inspiration it's
[1:07:24] not my thought it's his thought
[1:07:26] he says then the spiritual Faith only
[1:07:28] recognizes the word he says now in
[1:07:30] number 2 and three all through these
[1:07:32] things he says then you'll have
[1:07:33] spiritual you'll be having the Holy
[1:07:35] Spirit and it will seal all these things
[1:07:37] into you as the Holy Spirit covers this
[1:07:39] from your faith all the way up to the
[1:07:40] Holy Spirit it seals you in with Christ
[1:07:43] then you become at one amen see you and
[1:07:45] Christ live together at that day you'll
[1:07:47] know that I'm in the Father the father
[1:07:49] and me and I and you and you and me see
[1:07:51] he says then that's a sealed unit of the
[1:07:53] Lord God when the Holy Spirit pour pour
[1:07:55] s into our being and seals it all
[1:07:58] together he says that's a sealed unit he
[1:08:00] says now and then they are Vindicated
[1:08:02] and
[1:08:03] placed he says when that time takes
[1:08:05] place then they become Vindicated Sons
[1:08:08] and Daughters of
[1:08:09] God not our he says they become
[1:08:13] Vindicated we always were
[1:08:15] Sons scripture says because you are
[1:08:18] Sons God sends the spirit into US crying
[1:08:21] out Abba Father Abba Father it's because
[1:08:24] we're sons and daughters that he comes
[1:08:25] to us but he says you always were Sons
[1:08:27] but when the Holy Spirit comes in and
[1:08:29] seals these things and turns those
[1:08:31] attributes into his true attributes he
[1:08:34] says now you're Vindicated you're proven
[1:08:37] and you're placed that's what's
[1:08:39] happening in these things amen we're
[1:08:40] positionally placed in Christ by the
[1:08:42] Holy Spirit now Paul says as we read
[1:08:45] earlier that each one of us has The
[1:08:47] Measure of
[1:08:48] Faith but here's the thing I have it in
[1:08:51] a certain level for my life and you have
[1:08:53] it in a certain level for your life you
[1:08:56] we listen to what brother Ron Spencer's
[1:08:58] going through anybody here want to claim
[1:09:00] they've got faith for that four years of
[1:09:03] stage for cancer now he's got double
[1:09:05] heart
[1:09:06] attacks but let me tell you Satan can't
[1:09:08] take you till God's done with you and so
[1:09:10] the faith is there the Revelation is
[1:09:12] there to keep pressing on Amen but we
[1:09:16] have faith for our
[1:09:17] journey we have the measure that is
[1:09:19] required for each and one each and every
[1:09:21] one of us as we said in a service a
[1:09:23] while ago when you need the revelation
[1:09:25] God will give it when you need the faith
[1:09:27] God will give it it's been in you all
[1:09:28] along but it rises up as the need arises
[1:09:32] amen it's there he's already provided
[1:09:34] everything we have need of is in us when
[1:09:36] he gives us the Holy Spirit he's already
[1:09:38] provided every one of our needs amen
[1:09:41] amen but it's it's going to take what
[1:09:43] it's going to take trials it's going to
[1:09:44] take testing it's going to take
[1:09:45] situations to pull these things out we
[1:09:48] shrink so often from the trials of life
[1:09:50] but that is what shows what's in Us in
[1:09:52] the first place amen that we can
[1:09:53] overcome these things amen the purpose
[1:09:56] of this is to take us into the place and
[1:09:58] to be what God has called us to be in
[1:10:00] this age amen God has given to each and
[1:10:03] every one of us the measure of faith
[1:10:05] that we need to make it
[1:10:07] through now Paul would say this he says
[1:10:09] now we've all got The Measure of Faith
[1:10:10] but he says for as we have many members
[1:10:13] in one body he says this body's got lots
[1:10:15] of pieces he says and all members have
[1:10:17] not the same office in other words all
[1:10:19] the parts of our body don't have the
[1:10:21] same purpose my fingers are to pick
[1:10:23] things up they're to point at other
[1:10:25] people
[1:10:26] no they're
[1:10:27] not but they're meant for for fine work
[1:10:30] aren't
[1:10:32] they then you got parts of our body that
[1:10:34] aren't meant for fine
[1:10:36] work it's amazing how long it took them
[1:10:39] to get robots that could run and walk
[1:10:41] the way human does they've got them now
[1:10:43] that can do it but the Dynamics and the
[1:10:45] mechanics of a body are so complex and
[1:10:48] yet we do things almost without thinking
[1:10:50] well we do it without thinking because
[1:10:52] it's meant to do that it's built for it
[1:10:55] amen but each part he says don't have
[1:10:57] the same purpose he says so we be many
[1:11:00] are one body in Christ so he's talking
[1:11:01] to the whole church now he says even us
[1:11:03] we're all members in one body in Christ
[1:11:05] and everyone members one of another in
[1:11:07] the Amplified it says individually we
[1:11:10] are Parts one of another he says we're
[1:11:12] individuals but we're mutually dependent
[1:11:14] on one another listen in the scriptures
[1:11:18] a sheep alone was only called one thing
[1:11:21] lost we're sheep we're supposed to be in
[1:11:24] a group group we're supposed to be in a
[1:11:26] herb we're supposed to be together he
[1:11:28] says we are all members one of another
[1:11:31] the prophet of God would say now God
[1:11:32] creating the creation is expressing
[1:11:34] himself back in the creation and he's
[1:11:37] not a god of just one solid Sears and
[1:11:38] robach Harmony House he's a god of
[1:11:42] variety he makes big hills and little
[1:11:44] Hills he makes the deserts he makes
[1:11:45] Lakes he makes little trees and big
[1:11:47] trees and white flowers and red flowers
[1:11:49] he makes little men and big men
[1:11:51] red-headed women blackheaded women and
[1:11:53] he makes us different why
[1:11:55] cuz he wants us that way what's the
[1:11:58] point of having a bunch of Mees in this
[1:12:00] church
[1:12:02] horrible horrible a bunch of
[1:12:07] Germans I won't I'm going to leave
[1:12:10] it he says he makes us different because
[1:12:13] he wants us that way he's a god of
[1:12:14] variety and he makes some rich some poor
[1:12:18] some in
[1:12:20] between he says but we got a place to
[1:12:22] serve God and that's the place he's
[1:12:24] placing Us in if we'll just abide in
[1:12:28] that place isn't that the challenge
[1:12:30] isn't that the challenge is to stay in
[1:12:33] the place that he's called us to be amen
[1:12:37] it's sometimes you know what the
[1:12:38] challenge is is to look at ourselves and
[1:12:40] say I'm
[1:12:43] important it's easy for the minister to
[1:12:45] do it duh he's definitely
[1:12:49] important but for sister Lydia to say
[1:12:52] I'm
[1:12:52] important little old me
[1:12:57] little Paul sitting back
[1:12:59] there he likes me to mention his name
[1:13:01] over the pulpit right sitting back
[1:13:04] there who am
[1:13:07] I what does it matter if I come to
[1:13:09] church what does it matter if I'm a part
[1:13:11] of this body each and every one of us
[1:13:14] are members of the same
[1:13:17] body did you know the balance of your
[1:13:20] body is run through the little pinky toe
[1:13:24] take the pinky toe away away and you
[1:13:25] lose your balance the little thing
[1:13:28] little tiny toe that big and your
[1:13:31] balance rests on
[1:13:33] that that's how the little things matter
[1:13:36] you take the littlest thing take your
[1:13:37] thumbs try going through life without
[1:13:39] opposable thumbs not fun the tiny things
[1:13:43] make the biggest difference inside of
[1:13:44] the body and when each one is here when
[1:13:48] each one is present and accounted for
[1:13:49] when each one's working it's great but
[1:13:52] one little thing gets out one little
[1:13:54] thing gets hurt one little things get
[1:13:55] set back and what happens is the whole
[1:13:57] body does it just this injury to my
[1:13:59] shoulder when I cough my whole left side
[1:14:01] aches just one little
[1:14:04] injury one little thing can cause so
[1:14:06] much imbalance hurt ineffectiveness
[1:14:11] inside of the body amen so we've got to
[1:14:15] see God has us here for a supernatural
[1:14:17] reason no matter where we are no matter
[1:14:19] what we are we sit back and it's easy to
[1:14:22] do with Ministry or musicians you know
[1:14:24] and you look at this one you say wow can
[1:14:26] they ever play you know brother Andrew
[1:14:28] tashner when he gets on that keyboard
[1:14:31] Boy Who Am I who are you sister Morin
[1:14:34] compared to
[1:14:35] him but guess what he ain't here you're
[1:14:40] here I can sit here and I can compare
[1:14:42] myself to all the men that I consider to
[1:14:44] be great preachers but guess what
[1:14:46] they're not here I'm here so whether we
[1:14:49] acknowledge it or not we're here because
[1:14:52] God placed us here and we're here to be
[1:14:54] effective
[1:14:55] which means we are effective if we step
[1:14:58] into our
[1:14:59] position so don't let Satan say you're
[1:15:01] not
[1:15:02] important you're important you know how
[1:15:04] I'm important you're here if you're here
[1:15:07] and you're present and accounted for
[1:15:08] you're important amen but our what Satan
[1:15:11] will do is he'll say they're so much
[1:15:13] better and he'll get this comparative
[1:15:15] thing
[1:15:16] going which has no place in the body of
[1:15:19] Christ it's not about Better or Worse
[1:15:22] good or bad it's about what's your path
[1:15:23] and what's my path what's your purpose
[1:15:25] and what's my purpose and all he's
[1:15:27] looking for is who's going to be
[1:15:28] faithful that's what matters above all
[1:15:30] is who will be faithful
[1:15:34] amen there are people that can pray the
[1:15:37] lights out there are people that can
[1:15:38] preach the lights out there are people
[1:15:39] that can sing the lights out there are
[1:15:41] people that can play it whatever and we
[1:15:43] look at that and we say I need to get to
[1:15:45] that level you know what'll happen if
[1:15:46] you try that you'll fall flat on your
[1:15:48] face and you'll lose the effect of what
[1:15:51] he's given you already why because
[1:15:53] you're trying to be another man another
[1:15:54] woman
[1:15:55] it doesn't work that way we've got to
[1:15:57] stay in our lane
[1:15:59] amen but Christ says you're
[1:16:01] important and you're a part of the body
[1:16:04] and that means you got to be in your
[1:16:05] position in your place think of it like
[1:16:07] a hockey team you look at a hockey team
[1:16:10] they've got scores they got Playmakers
[1:16:12] and passers they got hitters they got
[1:16:14] offensive players they got defensive
[1:16:15] players they got a goalie that doesn't
[1:16:16] get to move around very much some of us
[1:16:19] have to be goalies and we got to protect
[1:16:21] the home
[1:16:23] net everyone else is running around
[1:16:25] having a good time and you got to sit
[1:16:26] here all weighed
[1:16:28] down but that's the way it is and let me
[1:16:31] tell you this if the hitter tries to
[1:16:33] take the scorers place you know what
[1:16:34] happens he still doesn't score any goals
[1:16:37] but the other team has a Heyday because
[1:16:39] now this guy's not hitting them and
[1:16:40] keeping them accountable for their
[1:16:41] movements you take a playmaker away what
[1:16:45] happens to the scores all of a sudden
[1:16:46] they're not scoring as much we all need
[1:16:49] each
[1:16:49] other it's imperfect balance
[1:16:52] amen but if we start trying to be what
[1:16:55] the other person is the body starts to
[1:16:58] hurt man we're a multi part of a
[1:17:01] multi-member body and we all have a
[1:17:02] specific role to play and we have to
[1:17:05] find contentment in that and be faithful
[1:17:07] in those things Paul would say this he
[1:17:10] says now having then gifts differing
[1:17:12] according to the works that we've
[1:17:16] done is that what it
[1:17:18] says gifts differing according to the
[1:17:22] grace that is given to us whether
[1:17:25] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[1:17:26] the proportion of Faith now that sets it
[1:17:28] in a different light doesn't it you are
[1:17:30] who you are and I am who I am by Grace
[1:17:34] the position you have the position I
[1:17:35] have is by Grace I don't deserve it you
[1:17:38] don't deserve it big or
[1:17:41] small for outward facing inward facing
[1:17:43] it doesn't matter everything we have is
[1:17:45] by his grace by his ordination and he
[1:17:48] says and there's a proportion of Faith
[1:17:50] given you to match your
[1:17:52] role so use what you've got
[1:17:55] where you're at and you'll find it works
[1:17:57] out perfectly well every time but we
[1:17:59] start trying to take somebody else's
[1:18:01] place or try to mimic somebody then our
[1:18:02] faith Falls flat because that's not our
[1:18:04] proportion of Faith we've got to grow in
[1:18:06] our role as he grows us in it but we
[1:18:08] can't presume in these things and man
[1:18:11] we've got to stay where we are not only
[1:18:13] that there's varying gifts within the
[1:18:15] same gift and that's easy to see when
[1:18:17] you look at music you look at preachers
[1:18:19] we got preachers that when they preach
[1:18:20] it's like a house on fire right and we
[1:18:24] love it
[1:18:25] then you got preachers that are calm and
[1:18:27] methodical and you know what some of us
[1:18:30] love that not Everyone likes a preacher
[1:18:32] that preaches like a house on fire some
[1:18:35] people like it calm and simple and we've
[1:18:38] got to be able to appreciate them both
[1:18:40] equally because they both have a
[1:18:43] purpose what does it help if a teacher
[1:18:45] is running around on the
[1:18:47] stage you're not going to get much out
[1:18:49] of a teacher that won't calm down and
[1:18:51] lay it out clearly most teachers Don't
[1:18:53] Preach like a house fire some do but
[1:18:57] again to each is given a way of doing it
[1:19:00] and God works with us as we are and he
[1:19:01] makes us as we are and if we can accept
[1:19:03] them as they come in rather than trying
[1:19:05] to force them into the way we like
[1:19:08] it then we make them
[1:19:10] ineffective we've got to accept it the
[1:19:12] way that God gives it and the way that
[1:19:13] God makes each one of these people so he
[1:19:16] says he says uh he says um Ministry says
[1:19:19] let us wait on our ministry or he that
[1:19:21] teach teaching teacheth on teaching or
[1:19:23] he that exhorteth on assertation he that
[1:19:25] giveth let him do it with Simplicity he
[1:19:27] that ruleth with diligence he that
[1:19:29] showeth Mercy with cheerfulness in other
[1:19:30] words he says he says whatever your
[1:19:32] ministry your service is wait for the
[1:19:35] opportunity and the leadership to use
[1:19:38] it this is a key thing and and I've
[1:19:41] spoken with ministers about this over
[1:19:43] the last year especially just because we
[1:19:46] can doesn't mean we
[1:19:48] should just because I can meet that need
[1:19:51] doesn't mean that I should because sons
[1:19:53] of God are led by the spirit of God
[1:19:55] amen we're supposed to have leadership
[1:19:56] for these things it's not up to me to
[1:19:58] force it and it's not up to me to jump
[1:20:01] into it every single time it comes my
[1:20:02] way we have to prayerfully ask the Lord
[1:20:06] do you want me in this situation because
[1:20:08] otherwise we just get another we get
[1:20:09] another
[1:20:10] Chief right too many chiefs and not
[1:20:12] enough
[1:20:13] Indians and we got too many people
[1:20:15] trying to manage and get into things
[1:20:17] instead of the one that's usually
[1:20:19] ordained by God to do it amen just
[1:20:22] because there's a need doesn't mean I
[1:20:23] have to meet it
[1:20:25] but if it's in my role and if it's in
[1:20:26] the way that God wants me to do it sure
[1:20:28] we step into it but there are often many
[1:20:30] people that have similar gifts and the
[1:20:32] thing is who does God want to do it
[1:20:34] that's why we bring in outside Ministry
[1:20:36] I recognize I can't do it
[1:20:38] all and I need to be fed and I need to
[1:20:41] to sit under those things as well and so
[1:20:42] that's why we bring in different
[1:20:43] Ministries and we bring in ministries of
[1:20:45] faith we bring in ministries of healing
[1:20:46] we bring in ministries of teaching we
[1:20:48] even bring in pastoral
[1:20:50] Ministries what to give us everything
[1:20:52] that we have need of and we accept each
[1:20:54] one as Servants of God as gifts of God
[1:20:58] to us for the benefit of the
[1:21:00] body BR would say this he says we all
[1:21:02] have different parts God has put the
[1:21:05] furniture in the house now watch the
[1:21:07] television say I will just not be
[1:21:08] television no more if I can't be an ice
[1:21:10] box that's an old name for refrigerator
[1:21:13] see the television's out then he says
[1:21:14] but if we all just find Our Calling in
[1:21:16] God and abide there see God knows just
[1:21:19] when to use us and how to use us he says
[1:21:24] and we don't want to be jumping here and
[1:21:25] there but where God put you be original
[1:21:29] be just what God wants you to
[1:21:32] be now don't get in a rut sometimes we
[1:21:36] refuse to change we refuse to grow and
[1:21:38] say well that's the way God made me no
[1:21:40] let's step up into the image he has for
[1:21:42] us amen let's step up into the
[1:21:44] transforming power of the holy spirit
[1:21:45] that the word changes Paul would
[1:21:48] continue he says let love be without
[1:21:49] dissimulation that means let love be
[1:21:52] sincere let it be a real thing don't let
[1:21:55] it just be words Let It Be
[1:21:58] actions he says abhor that which is evil
[1:22:01] and cleave to that which is good be
[1:22:03] kindly affectioned one to another with
[1:22:05] Brotherly Love in honor preferring one
[1:22:07] another now this is what you'll see in a
[1:22:09] body is this this idea of preferring one
[1:22:11] another in other words it allows others
[1:22:13] to step to the front to get the benefit
[1:22:16] and even to get the
[1:22:20] recognition who cares remember Paul say
[1:22:22] he says I planted aul water but it's God
[1:22:25] that gives the
[1:22:26] increase Paul wasn't saying there say
[1:22:28] it's me it's me it's me who cares as
[1:22:31] long as we get the increase as long as
[1:22:33] we see the word being fulfilled as long
[1:22:35] as we see God moving in our in our midst
[1:22:38] amen let's be focused on the Brotherly
[1:22:40] Love side side of things that'll produce
[1:22:42] the right results every time not getting
[1:22:44] the credit for our brotherly love Paul
[1:22:47] would summarize it all very simply in 1
[1:22:48] Corinthians 14 says even so ye for as
[1:22:51] much as ye are zealous of spiritual
[1:22:53] gifts anden we want God to be using
[1:22:56] gifts in our midst each of the nine
[1:22:58] spiritual gifts ought to be available
[1:23:01] inside the Church of God he says if
[1:23:03] you're zealous of it if you want them he
[1:23:05] says seek that you may what Excel to the
[1:23:09] edifying of the church in other words
[1:23:11] that what you do that that that gift in
[1:23:14] you would stabilize would build up would
[1:23:16] support would make healthy the local
[1:23:19] body amen if we want to come to a place
[1:23:21] of adoption we've got to seek to serve
[1:23:24] all always it's a life of service amen
[1:23:27] we don't force our way in we don't try
[1:23:28] and lift ourselves up amen we seek to
[1:23:31] serve and that's how we come to a place
[1:23:32] where God sees a willing heart and the
[1:23:34] character and the humility that's needed
[1:23:36] to use Authority and power properly amen
[1:23:39] a Christian Life is a life of service
[1:23:41] Brother Brad would say when you live
[1:23:42] your life for others you're looking
[1:23:43] heaven in the face right that's what it
[1:23:46] is it's seeking God's leadership now as
[1:23:48] to when and how we move into situations
[1:23:50] but I want to come back to our opening
[1:23:52] scripture here in Ephesians 2 in the
[1:23:54] last last verse that we read is 10 he
[1:23:56] says for we are his workmanship created
[1:23:58] in Christ Jesus un good works which God
[1:24:01] had before ordained that we should walk
[1:24:03] with him walk in them rather now I want
[1:24:05] to break this down as we this will be
[1:24:07] the last half of the service Lord
[1:24:08] willing but he talks here of three
[1:24:10] things he talks about our origin we
[1:24:12] talks about our purpose and he talks
[1:24:13] about our path all within the scripture
[1:24:16] and he starts with our origin he says
[1:24:17] for we are his
[1:24:20] workmanship now I want you to catch
[1:24:22] something because workmanship in implies
[1:24:26] intention when we see our kids sometimes
[1:24:29] go out and they play in the in the sand
[1:24:32] or they they play with wood or you give
[1:24:34] them some nails and some power tools
[1:24:36] they just go and they put things
[1:24:38] together just to see what they can do
[1:24:40] but he says when it comes to God we're
[1:24:42] workmanship in other words whatever he's
[1:24:44] doing is done with purpose you know
[1:24:46] brother Matt's a a machinist he he does
[1:24:49] fabrication work he's a mill right and
[1:24:50] if you are looking at what he's doing I
[1:24:52] guarantee you he doesn't and start
[1:24:54] working with the machines for no reason
[1:24:58] when he does it what does he have he's
[1:25:00] got a drawing or he's got an idea in his
[1:25:03] head and he's using those machines he's
[1:25:05] using his equipment to produce something
[1:25:07] that has a purpose either a client's
[1:25:09] going to pay for it they need it in the
[1:25:11] shop they need a tool whatever it might
[1:25:13] be he's working with purpose amen so we
[1:25:16] don't just go out and do a bunch of work
[1:25:18] for no good
[1:25:19] reason Paul's saying we are his
[1:25:22] workmanship in other words we are out of
[1:25:24] the work that he did with purpose he
[1:25:27] doesn't just do things he doesn't just
[1:25:28] put things in our lives he doesn't just
[1:25:30] take us on a particular path for no good
[1:25:32] reason but God has intention behind
[1:25:35] everything he does in our
[1:25:37] lives
[1:25:39] amen prophet of God would say this he
[1:25:41] says I think our heavenly father has
[1:25:43] people made up in certain
[1:25:45] ways for his own
[1:25:48] benefit he says just like that we do
[1:25:50] things certain ways different each time
[1:25:52] because we have a purpose in doing it
[1:25:55] that's why we do it he says he loved me
[1:25:57] when I was unlovable he loved you when
[1:26:00] you were unlovable but he changed you
[1:26:02] praise the Lord that he's changed us
[1:26:04] amen that I'm not the way I used to be
[1:26:06] he says just like the colored sister
[1:26:08] said that time in her testimony she said
[1:26:09] I'm not what I ought to be and I'm not
[1:26:11] what I want to be but then I'm not what
[1:26:13] I used to be she knew she had come
[1:26:16] somewhere and something had happened he
[1:26:18] says that's the way it is if God when I
[1:26:20] was an alien from him so loved me till
[1:26:22] he stooped down to get me and pick me up
[1:26:24] that gives me confidence that he wants
[1:26:26] to use me why because God doesn't start
[1:26:29] something without intention or purpose
[1:26:32] if he picked you up it was to turn you
[1:26:34] back into what you already always were
[1:26:36] in his eyes he said he's got a purpose
[1:26:39] in doing it he seen something in me he
[1:26:41] seen something in you he had a reason to
[1:26:44] save you he says look at the people
[1:26:46] that's unsaved today you're one in a
[1:26:50] million why are you one in a million
[1:26:52] because he chose you with purpose
[1:26:54] he says look at the millions he could
[1:26:56] have took beside you but he took
[1:26:59] you he says amen no one can take your
[1:27:02] place see that's a revelation he chose
[1:27:06] you because nobody else can take your
[1:27:08] place he says you're in God's economy no
[1:27:11] one can do it that's his love to you
[1:27:14] then won't Your Love reach right back to
[1:27:16] him he says and there's a love affair
[1:27:18] catch this now no matter what the
[1:27:20] situation is its circumstances is govern
[1:27:24] by this love that creates faith that God
[1:27:27] loves you and you love God and you love
[1:27:29] one another and that brings the faith
[1:27:31] all right he says then it what then the
[1:27:34] Faith Can't Keep from bringing out just
[1:27:37] exactly what God promised it would do
[1:27:40] that's our rest is that he loved me
[1:27:42] before I was lovable he saved me before
[1:27:45] I was
[1:27:48] savable everything was already provided
[1:27:51] remember what Paul said he says Those
[1:27:52] whom he called he just ified and those
[1:27:54] who he justified he Sanctified and those
[1:27:56] who he Sanctified them he also glorified
[1:27:58] before we ever did anything it was
[1:28:00] before the foundation of the world a way
[1:28:03] has been made a preparation been made so
[1:28:04] what he's doing is he's coming down he's
[1:28:06] picking up those select ones that he had
[1:28:08] his thoughts about in the beginning he
[1:28:10] says then he says when that comes
[1:28:12] together and you realize that in every
[1:28:14] situation he loves you the only question
[1:28:17] then is do I love
[1:28:19] him and if I love him and he loves me
[1:28:21] then what are we worried about
[1:28:22] everything will work for our our good
[1:28:25] even if it doesn't feel good amen our
[1:28:28] origin is the mind of God and he's the
[1:28:31] the master builder he's the great
[1:28:32] architect he's the
[1:28:36] engineer he's the
[1:28:38] Potter and we're just the product we're
[1:28:41] the finished product amen and then he
[1:28:43] just takes this clay of humanity and
[1:28:46] that we have and when it's all done
[1:28:47] we're formed in his purpose you know I
[1:28:50] was speaking to some brothers at the
[1:28:51] funeral on on Wednesday and we were we
[1:28:53] were talking about looking into our
[1:28:55] lives and looking our past and and
[1:28:57] sometimes the timeline of Our Lives
[1:28:59] doesn't seem to make sense and we say
[1:29:00] Lord why did it take so
[1:29:02] long Lord why didn't you do this here
[1:29:05] why didn't you do this there and it
[1:29:06] seems like events are unnecessarily
[1:29:08] harsh or painful or long and you say
[1:29:12] Lord why and in those situations
[1:29:15] especially before we come to the Lord we
[1:29:18] can sit there and we it can really cause
[1:29:19] a hardship it can put a shell around us
[1:29:22] and those offenses and hurts can really
[1:29:24] cause us to withdraw to ourselves but
[1:29:26] when we're truly saved when we get the
[1:29:28] true New Birth by the baptism of the
[1:29:29] Holy Ghost we look back on those
[1:29:31] situations with a filter of Grace
[1:29:34] because he was we see that he was
[1:29:35] working in our lives all along amen we
[1:29:38] can look at those things and it doesn't
[1:29:40] hold us back I look at my road I've got
[1:29:42] a pretty twisty Road I would think you
[1:29:45] know I've been all over North America
[1:29:46] I've sat under many different Ministries
[1:29:48] and I've met in fellowship with all
[1:29:50] kinds of Believers and I've been hurt
[1:29:52] I've been offended I've been defra Ed
[1:29:54] I've had Ministry fail I've had people
[1:29:56] leave me I've had people leave this
[1:29:58] message amen but I look back on all of
[1:30:01] those things and yet it doesn't bother
[1:30:05] me I don't like
[1:30:07] it but it doesn't hold me back in my
[1:30:09] relationship with God because he kept me
[1:30:14] that's what matters is he kept me amen
[1:30:17] and I'm still able to love him I'm still
[1:30:19] able to worship him I'm still able to
[1:30:21] thank him for all of those things that
[1:30:23] were difficult
[1:30:24] you know we lost I come from a broken
[1:30:27] home where my dad left when I was 10
[1:30:29] that breaks so many
[1:30:31] people but what happened was when I was
[1:30:33] 17 I found my real father and that took
[1:30:36] care of any issues with my Earthly
[1:30:38] father amen and what happens is when we
[1:30:41] come to our place in Christ we realize
[1:30:44] that everything else is
[1:30:46] dead and it's only purpose was to bring
[1:30:48] us to where we are now and then from
[1:30:50] that moment on everything that happens
[1:30:52] is bringing us closer CL and closer to
[1:30:55] our finality in Christ to a resurrection
[1:30:57] to a Rapture to a restoration to our
[1:30:59] eating condition
[1:31:01] amen but how many hurts and pains have
[1:31:03] we suffered even within the body of
[1:31:05] Christ from supposed Believers not
[1:31:07] supposed real
[1:31:09] Believers listen we're going to hurt
[1:31:11] each other absolutely we're going to
[1:31:14] offend each other we're going to lose
[1:31:15] our temper with each other we're going
[1:31:17] to do things sometimes we hurt people
[1:31:19] without intent and it's because they
[1:31:20] have issues in their life that we cause
[1:31:22] pain but yet we cause pain
[1:31:26] it's those that are closest to us that
[1:31:27] hurt us remember when Christ comes back
[1:31:29] and the Jews are going to look at his
[1:31:31] hands they're going to say where did you
[1:31:32] get these wounds he says
[1:31:33] what in the house of my
[1:31:36] friends the ones that can hurt us the
[1:31:38] most are the ones that are closest to us
[1:31:41] the ones that we have the greatest
[1:31:42] expectations on but I love how Paul puts
[1:31:45] this we look at Paul Paul got whipped
[1:31:48] Paul got stoned Paul got thrown in jail
[1:31:50] Paul got cursed out Paul had all sorts
[1:31:52] of things done in his life now listen to
[1:31:55] Paul's attitude he says in everything
[1:31:57] give
[1:31:58] thanks everything without exception give
[1:32:01] thanks he says why for this is the will
[1:32:04] of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[1:32:07] you what we're going through is his
[1:32:10] will if we're walking in the light as he
[1:32:13] is in the light if we're following the
[1:32:14] leadership of the Holy Spirit whatever
[1:32:16] comes our way is his will whether it
[1:32:18] seems good or whether it seems bad we've
[1:32:21] got to see the Harvest before we really
[1:32:23] know what's going good and
[1:32:24] bad and we see it in the end but we've
[1:32:27] got to have faith to hold on Amen we've
[1:32:29] got to stay tight we've got to say Lord
[1:32:30] I love you and you love me and I'll
[1:32:32] Trust you through this no matter what
[1:32:34] this is a very familiar quote he says
[1:32:36] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[1:32:38] no signs of God's disapproval neither
[1:32:41] are bright skies and Still Waters signs
[1:32:43] of his love and approval his approval of
[1:32:45] any of us is only in the Beloved his
[1:32:49] love is elective which he had for us
[1:32:51] before the foundation of the world does
[1:32:53] does he love us he says oh yes but how
[1:32:55] shall we know we shall know because he
[1:32:57] said so number one but catch this and
[1:33:01] manifested that he did love us for he
[1:33:03] brought us to himself Hallelujah he
[1:33:06] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[1:33:10] Spirit placing us as Sons you know he
[1:33:13] loves you because he gave you his own
[1:33:15] life he gave his life for you and then
[1:33:17] he gave his life to you that's how you
[1:33:19] know he loves you he says and how shall
[1:33:22] I prove my love to him him this is our
[1:33:25] part Church by believing what he said
[1:33:29] and conducting myself with joy amidst
[1:33:33] the trials that he in his wisdom allows
[1:33:38] to come to
[1:33:39] pass I look back now over my life see
[1:33:42] hindsight is usually
[1:33:44] 2020
[1:33:46] usually and I look back over my life and
[1:33:49] I say God you know how to you know how
[1:33:52] to prepare a person you know how to
[1:33:54] train a person you know how to get a
[1:33:56] person to where they need to
[1:33:58] be I look at my wife and I say God you
[1:34:01] know how to pick a spouse because here's
[1:34:03] the thing I thought I was
[1:34:05] choosing I did it prayerfully but God
[1:34:08] chose her for me I didn't choose her for
[1:34:11] me he brought her my
[1:34:14] way and what knowing where I would end
[1:34:17] up chose a spouse that would complement
[1:34:19] that
[1:34:20] role I didn't know I was going to be a
[1:34:22] minister never wanted to be why would
[1:34:25] you but he chose a wife for me that
[1:34:29] could shoulder the responsibilities with
[1:34:31] Grace with a willing heart that would be
[1:34:35] supportive and yet still be able to
[1:34:37] maintain everything she has to do as a
[1:34:39] mother and as a wife amen God placed me
[1:34:42] under Ministries and in situations so I
[1:34:44] could learn what not to do and what to
[1:34:47] do and guess what when you're learning
[1:34:49] what not to do because it affects you
[1:34:51] often it's easy to sit there and say why
[1:34:54] lord it's so that you'll learn it's so
[1:34:57] that I'll learn and all of it was
[1:34:59] training I had 16 years of express
[1:35:02] training to bring me to where I am
[1:35:05] today and in the meantime it often
[1:35:08] looks so
[1:35:11] chaotic it doesn't even look like the
[1:35:13] will of God many times and it's easy to
[1:35:16] sit there and say God why God why did
[1:35:19] you do that why did you allow it God why
[1:35:22] does this ke seem to keep happening and
[1:35:25] what is it it's God trying to get us to
[1:35:28] learn the lesson to prepare us because
[1:35:31] what's there is going to be small
[1:35:33] compared to what I'm going to face in
[1:35:34] the future and I've got to learn the
[1:35:35] lesson in the small things so that I can
[1:35:37] hold to it when the big times
[1:35:38] come amen look at Joseph look at David
[1:35:42] look at Daniel can you imagine Daniel
[1:35:45] taken away from his family taken away
[1:35:47] from his religion taken away from
[1:35:48] Worship in the temple and he's taken to
[1:35:51] a land where he's only got three other
[1:35:53] fellows that believe the way he does God
[1:35:57] why
[1:36:01] me that was his lot in life and guess
[1:36:04] what Daniel held the victory the whole
[1:36:07] time without the Holy Ghost a prophet
[1:36:10] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:36:12] world he comes in and he is separated
[1:36:14] from everything that he holds dear and
[1:36:17] yet The Anchor
[1:36:19] Holds that was his lot in life and he
[1:36:21] never begrudged it and God rolls him up
[1:36:24] and God made him a great man look at
[1:36:26] Joseph what did Joseph ever do and God
[1:36:30] put him into slavery he made his
[1:36:31] brothers hate him and then he puts him
[1:36:33] into slavery and then he puts him into
[1:36:35] prison why me Lord because I've got a
[1:36:38] job for you and I need you to learn the
[1:36:40] lessons before we get into the
[1:36:43] job he says that's the way God takes his
[1:36:46] men and beats out all their fears and
[1:36:49] all their
[1:36:50] intellectuals that's the first thing he
[1:36:52] does
[1:36:54] he says and then the Great Master Potter
[1:36:56] puts them on the wheel and begins to
[1:36:58] mold them over again he's got to break
[1:37:03] us down so he can build us
[1:37:05] up he says workmen that are worthy it's
[1:37:08] God's man he says who could trade a man
[1:37:10] more than God himself he says watch the
[1:37:13] way he trains them God knows how to
[1:37:15] prepare us for our purpose we all have a
[1:37:17] purpose which means he's got a
[1:37:18] preparation for that purpose and the
[1:37:20] biggest challenge is will I recognize it
[1:37:22] in the middle of that
[1:37:24] preparation well I recognize it when it
[1:37:27] doesn't feel so good when it doesn't
[1:37:28] look so
[1:37:30] good and recognize that there's a
[1:37:32] breaking down and there's a building up
[1:37:34] and neither one of them feels good
[1:37:37] neither one of them Feels Good Sister
[1:37:39] Betty just got broken down in her hip
[1:37:41] and she got built up it didn't feel real
[1:37:43] good did it sister Betty but the end
[1:37:46] result will be
[1:37:48] better but you have to go through that
[1:37:50] that that pressing time that trying time
[1:37:56] when we're
[1:37:58] sick when Ministry fails when Believers
[1:38:01] disappoint
[1:38:02] us when it seems like the money's not
[1:38:05] there when it seems like the job's not
[1:38:07] there that's when we've got to be able
[1:38:09] to trust how hard is it to worship God
[1:38:12] when things are going
[1:38:14] great but that's not the sign of his
[1:38:16] approval neither the tough times
[1:38:17] disapproval we have ups and downs we go
[1:38:20] through seasons and he's in it all I've
[1:38:22] questioned my decisions many times in
[1:38:23] life because I would be in the middle of
[1:38:25] it and things it just seemed like I
[1:38:28] jumped out of the frying pan into the
[1:38:29] fire I went from one tough situation
[1:38:31] into the next tough
[1:38:33] situation I was on an I was on an
[1:38:35] accelerated growth curve was what it was
[1:38:39] but you sit there and say God where's
[1:38:40] the
[1:38:42] rest can I have a break
[1:38:45] please
[1:38:47] no I've got a job for you so suck it
[1:38:52] up do you trust me job said though he
[1:38:56] slay me yet I'll trust
[1:39:01] him but through it all God was there I
[1:39:05] can look back now and I can I can say
[1:39:07] God was clearly there but I've got to
[1:39:09] have faith I've got to trust that he's
[1:39:12] leading me let me be more honest there
[1:39:15] were times I stepped out on my
[1:39:18] own and things did not work out
[1:39:22] well and I had to be able to step back
[1:39:24] and say that wasn't God's Will and it
[1:39:27] certainly wasn't God's perfect will you
[1:39:29] know how you're not in his perfect will
[1:39:31] you backtrack you've got to
[1:39:34] backtrack you get off on a path you get
[1:39:36] off on a road and what happens is you
[1:39:38] get out here and you realize God's
[1:39:41] nowhere to be
[1:39:43] found he didn't move I left him and I
[1:39:47] know it's not his will because I've got
[1:39:49] to go back to where he
[1:39:50] is and that takes humbling ourselves to
[1:39:53] the word
[1:39:54] and questioning how did I get off in the
[1:39:56] first place and dealing with that rude
[1:39:59] issue so that it doesn't happen again
[1:40:01] down the road that's all it is if I'm
[1:40:03] backtracking it means it wasn't in his
[1:40:05] perfect
[1:40:06] will amen God's will is always go
[1:40:09] forward it's either stand still or go
[1:40:11] forward it's never go
[1:40:13] away stand still or go forward you're
[1:40:15] either waiting on him or you're moving
[1:40:17] with him but you're never moving on your
[1:40:18] own but even in those moments where I
[1:40:21] got out of it God taught me why it went
[1:40:23] the way it went you know the situation
[1:40:26] in Texas what happened and I've said it
[1:40:27] many times I'll say it again for your
[1:40:28] own benefit if you let a person go above
[1:40:31] the word of God it's never going to work
[1:40:33] out well we hold ourselves accountable
[1:40:35] we hold Ministry accountable to the word
[1:40:37] of God the minute you put a man above it
[1:40:39] a woman above it a gift above it a
[1:40:40] Ministry above it a friendship above it
[1:40:42] then what happens is you get into his
[1:40:44] permissive will certainly not in his
[1:40:46] perfect will but even in those moments
[1:40:49] God taught me why it happened and he
[1:40:51] taught me what to do the next time and
[1:40:53] he taught me what not to do the next
[1:40:55] time you know sometimes pain and offense
[1:40:58] are our own fault and God still allows
[1:41:00] that to help us learn I remember way
[1:41:02] back when when uh we were going to the
[1:41:03] 7-Day Venice schools there and they had
[1:41:05] a um they had a graduation and I don't
[1:41:07] remember anything the minister said but
[1:41:09] he told this story he said of a little
[1:41:11] girl that was out and they on a farm and
[1:41:14] and the dad had just put up an electric
[1:41:16] fence for the livestock and she was
[1:41:18] walking towards the fence and her dad
[1:41:20] said don't touch the fence it will hurt
[1:41:22] you
[1:41:24] and she kept walking towards it he said
[1:41:25] don't touch the fence it'll hurt you and
[1:41:27] she kept walking and so what did he did
[1:41:29] he shut up and she went over and she
[1:41:31] touched the fence and then she started
[1:41:33] crying because it really really really
[1:41:34] really really
[1:41:35] hurt but you know what happened after
[1:41:38] that his little boy came out and he
[1:41:40] started walking towards the fence and
[1:41:42] you know what that little girl said
[1:41:43] don't touch the
[1:41:46] fence why she'd learned the
[1:41:49] lesson and he he was using her now to
[1:41:53] send the message you don't want to do
[1:41:55] that you don't want to go down that road
[1:41:58] I've been there I've touched that fence
[1:42:00] it's not good trust me you don't want to
[1:42:02] go down that road and if you do now
[1:42:04] you're forcing your way in and God will
[1:42:06] deal with you as an individual but some
[1:42:08] of us are lessons on what to do and some
[1:42:10] of us are lessons in not what not to do
[1:42:12] and we've got to be humble enough to
[1:42:13] share the what not to do as much as the
[1:42:15] what Tod do amen that's why I try and
[1:42:17] use myself as an example I've tried to
[1:42:19] share what I've learned and how God's
[1:42:20] dealt with me it'll help you when you
[1:42:22] come to those places as
[1:42:25] well but sometimes those things are
[1:42:27] literally by the will of
[1:42:29] God so that when the big trial comes
[1:42:31] later we don't do it remember David when
[1:42:33] nabal said I'm not going to give you
[1:42:35] anything and David's coming down with
[1:42:37] his 400 men he's going to wipe out nabal
[1:42:39] and all of his servants and take
[1:42:41] everything he has and nabal's wife meets
[1:42:43] him Abigail and she stops him there and
[1:42:45] David says he thanks her he says you are
[1:42:47] LED of God to do this because I'd have
[1:42:49] done something I shouldn't have
[1:42:52] done sometimes we're on that road and
[1:42:54] somebody will send a little one our way
[1:42:56] say you don't want to do this it'll
[1:42:58] impact you the rest of your
[1:43:00] life God might be able to bring you back
[1:43:02] around but you'll have a scar there the
[1:43:04] rest of your life you'll have something
[1:43:05] that's going to hold you back and you're
[1:43:07] not going to be able to move past it
[1:43:09] you're going to hit a you're going to
[1:43:10] hit a ceiling because of this you look
[1:43:12] at us as ministers we divorce and get
[1:43:14] married again we can't preach we're not
[1:43:17] allowed we're not allowed to do
[1:43:19] it there are certain things that hold us
[1:43:22] back from responsibility ities and roles
[1:43:23] in the kingdom of God based on our
[1:43:25] actions and that's on us that's not on
[1:43:27] God sometimes we force our way into
[1:43:29] it he would continue this he says the
[1:43:32] proof of his love is election that no
[1:43:36] matter what happened his love was proven
[1:43:38] truly by the fact that they were chosen
[1:43:40] unto salvation because God has chosen
[1:43:43] you to Salvation through sanctification
[1:43:44] of the spirit and belief of the truth
[1:43:48] catch
[1:43:49] this job said though he slay me yet I'll
[1:43:51] trust him he said he he may commit you
[1:43:54] to death as he did Paul he may commit
[1:43:57] you to suffering as he did job that is
[1:43:59] his prerogative he is suffering he is
[1:44:02] Sovereign rather he says but it is all
[1:44:04] with a purpose if he did not have a
[1:44:06] purpose then he would be the author of
[1:44:08] frustration and not a peace so if we are
[1:44:12] sitting in frustration what is the
[1:44:14] problem it's not God it's my attitude
[1:44:18] it's my Approach it's my mindset it's my
[1:44:21] vision of what's going on
[1:44:24] amen cuz God is not the author of
[1:44:27] frustration he says and not of Peace his
[1:44:30] purpose is that after we have suffered a
[1:44:35] while there's always suffering for the
[1:44:37] believer because that's part of training
[1:44:40] every one of us gets
[1:44:41] spanked every one of us goes through
[1:44:43] tests every one of us goes through
[1:44:44] trials he says but after that we have
[1:44:46] suffered a while we would be made
[1:44:48] perfect brother Grant what's the best
[1:44:50] time in the school semester when when
[1:44:53] the tests are over amen he says after
[1:44:56] you've been tested a while after you've
[1:44:59] suffered a while after you've gone
[1:45:00] through that stress after you've gone
[1:45:01] through that difficulty a while he says
[1:45:04] we will be made
[1:45:06] what more
[1:45:08] frustrated tired worn out he says that
[1:45:13] after after we've suffered a while we
[1:45:14] will be made perfect we would be
[1:45:17] established we would be strengthened and
[1:45:20] settled as job said he puts strength in
[1:45:24] us if somebody ought to know that it's
[1:45:27] job lost his family lost his wealth and
[1:45:29] left with a nagging
[1:45:31] wife that's the modern version of
[1:45:35] hell because we know what a nagging wife
[1:45:37] is like
[1:45:40] scripturally not by experience of course
[1:45:44] Brothers but the question is where's our
[1:45:46] strength
[1:45:47] then if it's supposed to establish us if
[1:45:50] it's supposed to strengthen us if it's
[1:45:52] supposed to settle us then where is our
[1:45:54] strength who's telling us you're not
[1:45:57] strong
[1:45:58] enough it ain't
[1:46:01] God Paul said I can do all things
[1:46:03] through Christ which strengthens me so
[1:46:05] we have nothing to fall back on and say
[1:46:07] I don't have enough to go through it
[1:46:10] little old me can't do it I'm no
[1:46:13] good that comparative thing kills us
[1:46:15] every
[1:46:17] time we're formed by God we're shaped by
[1:46:20] God and though he's a supernatural God
[1:46:22] yet he uses the Natural Things of life
[1:46:24] because we're we are supernatural beings
[1:46:25] going through a natural experience amen
[1:46:27] so he uses the natural things he goes he
[1:46:30] takes us through life and situations and
[1:46:31] challenges and events and he uses it to
[1:46:34] mold us into his image and it's always
[1:46:36] with purpose brother Braham said it was
[1:46:37] to make us mature perfect means mature
[1:46:41] established strengthened and
[1:46:44] settled amen anyone that's ever amounted
[1:46:46] to anything in God's kingdom has had to
[1:46:48] go through
[1:46:49] this and the greater the role the
[1:46:51] greater the impact the greater the
[1:46:53] testing and trials and suffering like I
[1:46:55] said you look at Joseph you look at
[1:46:56] David you look at these different ones
[1:46:59] and they had to go through
[1:47:00] hell why so that the character would
[1:47:03] match the role when it all finished up
[1:47:05] but what's our
[1:47:06] attitude when we're going through it
[1:47:08] what's our
[1:47:09] attitude when we're going through these
[1:47:11] trials when we're going through this
[1:47:12] molding process when we're going through
[1:47:14] this preparation what is our attitude to
[1:47:17] it that tells us whether we're ready for
[1:47:19] adoption or
[1:47:20] not Paul would say this in Romans he
[1:47:22] says but oh man who artart thou that
[1:47:24] repliest against God shall the thing
[1:47:27] form say to him that formed it why hast
[1:47:30] Thou made me thus we've got two problems
[1:47:32] that come into our lives one is why am I
[1:47:34] the way I am and that's a comparative
[1:47:37] thing that's a comparative thing is when
[1:47:40] you say why am I different from other
[1:47:41] people why am I not like the popular one
[1:47:44] why am I not by this one why am I not
[1:47:46] like that one I had to get over that
[1:47:48] very early in my Ministry is why am I
[1:47:49] the way I am and when when I feel I
[1:47:51] could be so much more effective as it as
[1:47:53] another type of
[1:47:54] Minister I think every Minister would
[1:47:56] love to be that that Dynamic just you
[1:48:00] know house on fire type
[1:48:02] preaching but we aren't all and for me
[1:48:05] to try and be that would literally cause
[1:48:08] me to fail but we can say Lord why did
[1:48:11] you make me thus remember what Paul said
[1:48:14] he says we have this treasure in Earth
[1:48:16] and vessels that the Excellency may be
[1:48:19] of God and not of us he makes us this
[1:48:22] way so that when it comes out and the
[1:48:24] Supernatural is working in our life we
[1:48:26] are ready and quick to understand this
[1:48:28] ain't me that's doing it it keeps us
[1:48:31] humble he's made us this this way to
[1:48:33] keep us humble and that when we
[1:48:35] surrender we can become
[1:48:37] effective but then the other problem so
[1:48:39] often is not just Lord why have you made
[1:48:41] me thus but why have you made me in this
[1:48:44] path or
[1:48:45] way we look at our life and we say why
[1:48:48] did it have to be that way did I really
[1:48:50] have to go through that trial did I have
[1:48:52] to really lose this did I really have to
[1:48:54] get sick did I have to lose my finances
[1:48:55] did I have to go bankrupt did I have to
[1:48:57] lose my wife whatever it might be you
[1:49:00] see great suffering amongst the people
[1:49:02] of God and we can sit there and say Lord
[1:49:04] couldn't you have done it a little
[1:49:05] easier on
[1:49:07] me no everything he does is his purpose
[1:49:11] we are his
[1:49:13] workmanship and mean he's doing it with
[1:49:15] intent but as we're coming into adoption
[1:49:17] what do we do we start to embrace we
[1:49:20] embrace the way that God's working and
[1:49:22] we say like Mary be unto me according to
[1:49:25] Thy word and we rest that he's got it
[1:49:28] all in control amen that our lives are
[1:49:31] in his hands listen Paul and Silas
[1:49:34] praised God while chained to the stalks
[1:49:36] in
[1:49:37] jail that's the response of a child of
[1:49:39] God that's the response of adopted sons
[1:49:42] of God is that we can Praise Him in the
[1:49:44] storm as much as we can Praise Him in
[1:49:46] the sunshine that we get so rarely in
[1:49:48] Newan land it makes no matter my life is
[1:49:52] in his hands
[1:49:54] God is good all the time we sing it but
[1:49:56] do we believe it do we believe
[1:50:01] it that's our origin we are his
[1:50:04] workmanship we come from his mind his
[1:50:06] thoughts but then we go to the next part
[1:50:09] and it says we are his workmanship
[1:50:11] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:50:14] so here we see our purpose
[1:50:16] amen first thing to see about this is
[1:50:18] that it's in a certain place and it's in
[1:50:21] Christ Our purpose purpose and our
[1:50:23] placing is always in Christ amen we're
[1:50:25] talking about what about adoption about
[1:50:27] the workmanship of God and the effectual
[1:50:30] working of the Holy Spirit places Us in
[1:50:31] the body of Christ that's what 1
[1:50:33] Corinthians 12 says by one Spirit we are
[1:50:35] placed into the body we're baptized into
[1:50:37] the body amen it places us into Christ
[1:50:40] and the purpose of that he says is good
[1:50:43] works now remember what Jesus said Jesus
[1:50:46] said there's none good but
[1:50:48] God remember when the the Rich Young
[1:50:51] Ruler came onto him he said good Master
[1:50:53] Jesus said there's none good but God
[1:50:55] good works means God's works and God's
[1:50:58] work means God's Will and God's will is
[1:51:00] his word so in other words we have been
[1:51:03] created in Christ Jesus unto what doing
[1:51:07] the word of God producing the word of
[1:51:09] God not just obedience in terms of our
[1:51:12] lives but producing it letting it flow
[1:51:14] through us and producing the very life
[1:51:16] and the attributes and the results that
[1:51:19] were in Christ's life that were in the
[1:51:20] disciples life that were in the first
[1:51:22] church is life amen so each one of us
[1:51:25] has a role to play he says we are his
[1:51:26] workmanship each one of us is created to
[1:51:29] do God's
[1:51:31] work each one of us produced to do God's
[1:51:35] work amen and it's so tempting for us to
[1:51:37] try and be like what the person next to
[1:51:40] us is
[1:51:41] doing because we see the results but
[1:51:43] what we don't see is everything that
[1:51:44] went into getting those results I said
[1:51:47] it before the scripture gives us such
[1:51:49] insight into what it takes to become
[1:51:52] great in the Kingdom and it is a total
[1:51:54] and complete humbling and destruction of
[1:51:56] our Humanity laying everything down so
[1:52:00] that he could have the
[1:52:01] preeminence and so often what we do is
[1:52:04] we mimic the the actions without having
[1:52:07] the life behind it without the character
[1:52:08] behind it produce it and so we keep
[1:52:10] failing we keep failing but he says each
[1:52:12] one of us has been created for good
[1:52:14] works for Godly works and there's a
[1:52:16] purpose amen when I try and be like some
[1:52:19] other minister I fail if I it's so
[1:52:22] tempting to go into a church where they
[1:52:24] preach a certain way and try and preach
[1:52:25] a certain way but that will never work
[1:52:28] that will never work cuz I'm not
[1:52:30] anointed that way that's not my ministry
[1:52:32] that's not the way I am amen and if you
[1:52:34] try and influence me to be that way
[1:52:36] that's even
[1:52:38] worse I can't get myself out of it and I
[1:52:41] can't become it just because you want it
[1:52:44] that's why we bring in the others is
[1:52:46] because that's they have it naturally
[1:52:48] why would we want to put something on
[1:52:50] when we can have the real deal
[1:52:53] amen if I want to be a certain way or
[1:52:56] you want to be me me to be a certain way
[1:52:58] you know what that does that makes me my
[1:53:00] workmanship or it makes me your
[1:53:03] workmanship and what happens then is
[1:53:06] that when the supernatural comes into my
[1:53:07] workmanship it fails every time you know
[1:53:11] as an engineer we design pressure
[1:53:13] vessels and the material has to be it
[1:53:16] has to meet a certain test specification
[1:53:18] has to have a certain strength and if
[1:53:20] you build a pressure vessel out of the
[1:53:21] wrong material as soon as the pressure
[1:53:23] comes it'll blow up that's what happens
[1:53:25] with our workmanship when we make
[1:53:26] ourselves into something rather than we
[1:53:28] let him make us into something when the
[1:53:30] pressure hits we just blow up we need
[1:53:34] him to work us and the way that we get
[1:53:36] the strength into those materials as we
[1:53:38] put it under great
[1:53:40] heat and then we bring it out in a
[1:53:42] certain way and it tempers the material
[1:53:45] to give it the properties it needs to
[1:53:46] have the strength to stand up to the
[1:53:48] pressure and then when the supernatural
[1:53:50] tries to express itself through my
[1:53:51] workmanship it never
[1:53:54] works it can't the supernatural needs a
[1:53:56] supernatural
[1:53:58] workmanship brother B say this he says
[1:54:00] how that God trying to place his people
[1:54:03] and when God places one then oh the
[1:54:05] whole church wants to be like that one
[1:54:07] have the same kind of things and do the
[1:54:08] same things he says we are cut out
[1:54:10] different we're made different we are
[1:54:13] natured different and we are
[1:54:14] positionally placed different each one
[1:54:17] for a different work and then he says
[1:54:20] maybe one for just a little kind of a
[1:54:22] work and another for a large work but
[1:54:25] that's not me that decides it it's not
[1:54:26] you that decides it it's God that
[1:54:28] decides it and the whole thing is a
[1:54:30] great preparation for the work that
[1:54:31] we're supposed to do in our lives amen
[1:54:33] we aren't supposed to worry about how
[1:54:35] big our work is remember we we read
[1:54:37] about the parable of the talents a while
[1:54:39] ago some got more than others but the
[1:54:41] question was not how much do you have
[1:54:43] it's what are you going to do with what
[1:54:44] you've got because the Lord was looking
[1:54:46] to see who would be
[1:54:48] faithful he said Well Done thou good and
[1:54:52] faithful servant cuz you took what I
[1:54:54] gave you and you magnified it you
[1:54:57] expanded it you multiplied
[1:54:59] it use what God gives
[1:55:02] you be what God has placed you to
[1:55:06] be and then when he sees you Faithful in
[1:55:08] that you'll find that usually that thing
[1:55:10] you thought was a little work was so
[1:55:12] much bigger than you ever
[1:55:14] anticipated it's like when you're trying
[1:55:16] to you know if you're you're trying to
[1:55:18] you ever see um I think every boy likes
[1:55:21] to do this when you're up on a hill and
[1:55:23] there's a big rock up there what do you
[1:55:24] want to do you want to roll the Rock and
[1:55:27] have it go all the way down the hill and
[1:55:28] just but when you get a really big
[1:55:31] one sometimes they need some help don't
[1:55:34] they and you can sit there and
[1:55:36] everyone's trying to push that rock and
[1:55:38] nothing's moving and then all that needs
[1:55:40] is that little extra pound of force and
[1:55:41] a little kid can come and just touch
[1:55:43] that rock and it'll move sometimes all
[1:55:46] you need is that extra little bit of
[1:55:48] effort from the littlest thing in the
[1:55:50] church and it tips The Rock over and all
[1:55:53] of a sudden it's a finished work that's
[1:55:56] why we all gather that's why we all
[1:55:58] bring our licks of fire that's why we
[1:55:59] all bring our faith because sometimes
[1:56:01] it's the last little one that makes the
[1:56:03] difference so often we're relying on the
[1:56:05] big and the great and we forget it's the
[1:56:08] little one that often makes the
[1:56:11] difference he would say don't let that
[1:56:13] be you just a floater and a Drifter you
[1:56:15] can never amount to anything like that
[1:56:17] let's get up and do something about it
[1:56:18] let's put our shoulder to the wheel
[1:56:20] let's see that our church prospers let
[1:56:22] let's get the kingdom prospering he's
[1:56:23] not talking money he says let's see that
[1:56:26] the sick gets in here let's see that God
[1:56:28] is laid down among the people and great
[1:56:30] signs and wonders take place that'll
[1:56:31] strike the nation I'm satisfied that
[1:56:33] there will be things that happen here
[1:56:35] that will thrill this country that'll
[1:56:36] Shake It for the kingdom of God if each
[1:56:39] one of us will get behind it he says
[1:56:41] what are we doing we're building the
[1:56:44] platform for our
[1:56:46] Lord he says we want to bring him to our
[1:56:49] community we want to bring him in a
[1:56:50] great Revival he says but we've got to
[1:56:53] elect him in our own Hearts see I've got
[1:56:55] to put him in preeminence I've got to
[1:56:57] choose him I've got to vote him
[1:57:00] in not by mouth but by Life by my
[1:57:04] day-to-day actions and decisions he says
[1:57:06] we've got to purpose something get
[1:57:08] something to do with it something to do
[1:57:10] for some purpose you don't don't just
[1:57:12] join the church and drift on you don't
[1:57:14] do it that way you always you got to
[1:57:17] have a purpose in what you're doing now
[1:57:19] don't go make up a purpose that's not
[1:57:22] what he's saying here amen that'll get
[1:57:23] you in trouble but rather see your
[1:57:25] purpose see where you fit in and then be
[1:57:27] faithful to that
[1:57:30] amen tell God I'm here I'm present I'm
[1:57:33] willing I'm able you just need to point
[1:57:35] me in the right
[1:57:36] direction listen to this he says wife
[1:57:38] says well I'm just a
[1:57:40] wife he says get on the telephone and do
[1:57:44] something not
[1:57:46] gossip not chitchat get on the phone
[1:57:50] give a testimony send a scripture to
[1:57:52] somebody let them know you're praying
[1:57:53] for them send them a song that's blessed
[1:57:55] you share something that'll be a witness
[1:57:57] to somebody
[1:57:59] else that's what we can do he says do
[1:58:02] something to help the Lord Jesus now he
[1:58:04] says now there is a time that a man can
[1:58:06] come to a place where he can have a
[1:58:08] purpose and it's something that will
[1:58:10] change him and that is when a man meets
[1:58:13] God he says when a man he says a man can
[1:58:16] never be the same if he ever meets God
[1:58:18] face to face it changed Moses it changed
[1:58:22] change
[1:58:23] Jacob amen he says it will change him in
[1:58:27] spite of anything you can do about it a
[1:58:30] man can never be the same after he once
[1:58:33] meets God he says now that's the
[1:58:36] truth he wants us to be able to see
[1:58:38] where we can be active in the Kingdom to
[1:58:40] see that we have purpose even as
[1:58:42] students we get little opportunities you
[1:58:45] look at doctors you look at nurses you
[1:58:47] look at Engineers we all have our Co-op
[1:58:48] work terms we're not full-blown
[1:58:51] Engineers but we can have little
[1:58:53] opportunities to help the greater good
[1:58:55] and so that's what we do and that's what
[1:58:56] God does is as we're going through life
[1:58:58] and as he teaches us something as he
[1:59:00] gets us settled in something now he
[1:59:02] gives us an opportunity to apply it for
[1:59:04] the benefit of others around you and
[1:59:06] maybe it's as a father as a as a as a
[1:59:09] mother as a wife or as a husband for
[1:59:11] your household for your kids whatever it
[1:59:13] might be but God says okay you got it
[1:59:15] now let's see if you got it and then as
[1:59:17] you go through that things he's saying
[1:59:18] will they respond and act the right way
[1:59:21] right
[1:59:23] and then will we glorify God or will we
[1:59:25] glorify ourselves will you do the right
[1:59:28] thing and then will you have the right
[1:59:29] motive and objective behind it and he'll
[1:59:30] test you in little things and if you
[1:59:32] pass the little things that's how you
[1:59:33] graduate to the big things as an
[1:59:35] engineer I got to do all sorts of
[1:59:37] interesting things as a student engineer
[1:59:39] as a co-op student but as soon as I got
[1:59:41] my degree then I was allowed a greater
[1:59:44] latitude and then once I became a
[1:59:46] professional engineer that gave me even
[1:59:47] more latitude once I became the manager
[1:59:49] then I had all the latitude but there's
[1:59:51] a progression each way and I've got to
[1:59:53] keep going and growing and proving
[1:59:55] myself as I go through so don't turn
[1:59:57] down the little opportunities the little
[1:59:59] opportunities are what prove you're
[2:00:00] ready for the bigger
[2:00:02] opportunities but then we come to the
[2:00:04] end of this
[2:00:05] verse and we come to our path and he
[2:00:08] says we are his workmanship created in
[2:00:09] Christ Jesus under good works now here's
[2:00:11] the path which God had before ordained
[2:00:14] that we should walk in them so God has
[2:00:17] ordained each and every one of us to a
[2:00:19] particular a particular set of things of
[2:00:22] works that he wants us to do Amen in
[2:00:24] other words God has laid out our lives
[2:00:26] in such a way that we are predestinated
[2:00:29] to do God's
[2:00:31] Will and he'll bring us to the
[2:00:33] opportunities he'll bring us to the
[2:00:34] doors he'll take us on a path and it's
[2:00:36] all tied into how he made us in what's
[2:00:39] behind us in the things he's taught us
[2:00:41] the things he's brought us through it's
[2:00:43] all preparing us for what's before us
[2:00:45] and it never stops it never stop it's
[2:00:48] always going God's always building us up
[2:00:50] line upon line word upon word
[2:00:52] here a little there a little everything
[2:00:54] that's behind us is for what's in front
[2:00:55] of
[2:00:56] us so we shouldn't be going backwards
[2:01:00] that's why Paul would said this one
[2:01:01] thing I do forgetting those things which
[2:01:02] are behind I press toward the mark for
[2:01:04] the prize of the high calling in Christ
[2:01:05] Jesus take it and use it but don't dwell
[2:01:08] on it don't rest on those
[2:01:11] things you know we can look at certain
[2:01:13] things and you know you could maybe say
[2:01:16] well I can do it better than that
[2:01:17] brother I can look I can do it better
[2:01:18] than that sister that has nothing to do
[2:01:21] with it that's carnality speaking that's
[2:01:24] carnality speaking because we look at
[2:01:25] our our talents and sat comes in and
[2:01:27] says you've got the
[2:01:29] talent that's not the way God works you
[2:01:32] see nowhere in here where he talks about
[2:01:34] Talent he says we are his workmanship
[2:01:37] and other words we are qualified for our
[2:01:39] Purpose By election not by talent in
[2:01:43] other words we are where we are and we
[2:01:45] will be what we be not by talent but
[2:01:47] because he ordained us to be that and he
[2:01:50] puts in what he needs and he takes out
[2:01:51] what he needs and regardless of the
[2:01:53] talent we have if we don't surrender it
[2:01:55] we can never progress in the kingdom of
[2:01:57] God we've got to come as a little child
[2:02:00] we've got to lay it all down amen we're
[2:02:03] not called to something because we have
[2:02:04] talent we're called to it because God
[2:02:06] has called us to it and when you have
[2:02:08] the right character which is by his
[2:02:09] development then you'll be ready to step
[2:02:11] into that role and then what is it that
[2:02:13] character does it causes us to yield to
[2:02:15] the Holy Spirit it causes us to allow
[2:02:17] the word to have the full effect to take
[2:02:19] the
[2:02:20] preeminence look at what said about
[2:02:22] Jeremiah very familiar scripture he says
[2:02:24] before I formed thee in the belly I knew
[2:02:26] thee before Jeremiah was even a twinkle
[2:02:29] in his daddy's eye God knew him he says
[2:02:32] and before thou camest forth out of the
[2:02:33] womb I Sanctified thee Jeremiah you are
[2:02:36] cleaned up and prepared for service
[2:02:38] before you were ever born he says and I
[2:02:40] ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations
[2:02:43] not a pastor not a priest he was a
[2:02:45] prophet and that was the only place that
[2:02:47] God could use him was as a prophet and
[2:02:49] God had him prepared God had him called
[2:02:51] God had him ordained God had him ready
[2:02:54] to be a prophet before he ever stepped
[2:02:55] foot on this Earth and it's no different
[2:02:58] for each and every one of us God has
[2:03:00] ordained Paul said us unto a set of Good
[2:03:02] Works he's ordained us unto a path
[2:03:05] brother Bram says this he says who that
[2:03:06] taking thought can add one cubit to his
[2:03:09] stature we must do what we can with what
[2:03:12] we have to do with he says what God has
[2:03:15] ordained us to do if you'll stay right
[2:03:16] in your calling and abide there God will
[2:03:18] use you if you try and step over and do
[2:03:21] something else you'll find yourself
[2:03:22] wrecked up somewhere it's always that
[2:03:25] way that's the human rac's thought
[2:03:27] though he says you'll find it doing that
[2:03:29] I think we've all met people that
[2:03:30] believe they're meant to be something or
[2:03:33] do something and it's only in their head
[2:03:36] and what happens is they keep trying to
[2:03:38] do it and they keep
[2:03:40] wrecking and they keep making a mess and
[2:03:43] they keep getting embarrassed why
[2:03:45] because it ain't God doing it it's them
[2:03:47] trying to do it now I'm not saying
[2:03:48] they're not called to do
[2:03:50] it Moses
[2:03:52] got out of God's timeline Moses was
[2:03:54] always a a deliverer but what happened
[2:03:57] was was Moses was always a deliver but
[2:04:00] his timeline his timeline got ahead of
[2:04:03] his character it got ahead of his
[2:04:06] Revelation and so he tried to do it and
[2:04:08] brother Braham says all that he had to
[2:04:09] show for it was one dead egyp Egyptian
[2:04:11] and he lost the respect of his people so
[2:04:15] God had to take him out on the backside
[2:04:16] of the de of the desert and humble him
[2:04:19] and mold him for 40 years we read
[2:04:21] earlier he he beats the fears out of us
[2:04:23] and the intellectuals that we think we
[2:04:25] can do it and then from there he molds
[2:04:27] us back into what we need to be right
[2:04:30] when Moses got humbled when Moses got
[2:04:32] molded then God could use him and that's
[2:04:34] the difference amen when God's ordained
[2:04:36] you for it God has to make you wait on
[2:04:38] him to do it when you're walking in your
[2:04:40] own will you will use
[2:04:44] you come on when I'm walking in my will
[2:04:47] it's me using me and when did that ever
[2:04:50] produce anything Supernatural
[2:04:52] or Eternal no nothing I've got to get
[2:04:56] out of the way raham says this he says
[2:04:58] but I got better hopes of you Brethren
[2:05:00] here this morning that you'll be men of
[2:05:02] God who stay with the word of God and
[2:05:04] let everything else fall right to left
[2:05:06] but stay right with the word don't move
[2:05:08] he says no matter if you're a doormat
[2:05:10] out there be a good doormat he says
[2:05:13] don't try to compete with someone else
[2:05:15] or do this just get right in the word
[2:05:17] and stay right there and God will
[2:05:19] positionally place you into his kingdom
[2:05:21] where you can be the best God's got a
[2:05:25] place for each and every one of us he
[2:05:27] says and when you can find that you'll
[2:05:29] be the best at
[2:05:30] that and we see that but Paul I'm going
[2:05:34] to tell a story on
[2:05:36] you when I first came here I know how
[2:05:39] much brother Paul likes Sunday school
[2:05:41] and brother Mark was talking to me one
[2:05:42] day and he said Paul just loves teaching
[2:05:45] Sunday school like that is his he just
[2:05:47] he's he feels he's built for it he's got
[2:05:49] it it just it's something in him that
[2:05:51] wants to do it and in a moment of
[2:05:55] devilish something I went to Paul after
[2:05:58] one service and I just moved here and of
[2:06:00] course I'm a minister Paul's not a
[2:06:02] minister as far as we know and I went to
[2:06:05] Paul and I said Paul you know I've been
[2:06:07] thinking about it and now that we've got
[2:06:09] a minister here I feel like I should
[2:06:10] take over the Sunday
[2:06:14] school and Paul's face dropped he was in
[2:06:18] shock and that's when I regretted my
[2:06:20] little joke
[2:06:26] but what is
[2:06:27] it we put who's best there because God
[2:06:31] makes them not because I'm a minister I
[2:06:34] can do it better you know what that's
[2:06:36] that would be if I was serious about
[2:06:38] that that would be me saying me big
[2:06:41] Minister you little Sunday school
[2:06:43] teacher me do better
[2:06:46] no it's not that I don't have a desire
[2:06:48] to serve the young people it's not that
[2:06:50] I couldn't do some good but you know
[2:06:53] what I don't ever have to tell him Paul
[2:06:55] make sure you prepare for your Ser for
[2:06:56] your for your your little
[2:06:58] messages Paul you've been
[2:07:01] lagging Paul the kids are saying that
[2:07:03] there's nothing in them anymore that
[2:07:05] you've lost your no no no why because
[2:07:09] there's something in him he's built for
[2:07:11] it he's built for it right what is it
[2:07:15] God will positionally place you in your
[2:07:17] kingdom where you can be the
[2:07:20] best and and when you do that nothing
[2:07:24] pulls you to the right nothing pulls you
[2:07:26] to the left Satan will try and get you
[2:07:29] oh do this do that no way I'm happy
[2:07:32] where I'm at I'm satisfied where I'm at
[2:07:35] I'm built for this I'm built for this
[2:07:38] and even when he doesn't want to do it
[2:07:40] he's still built for it and he keeps
[2:07:43] doing it and he keeps doing it and he
[2:07:44] keeps doing it and the young people
[2:07:46] benefit from it tremendously thank you
[2:07:47] brother Paul very faithful God bless you
[2:07:52] but each one of us are in the same
[2:07:55] thing can we give some roses today this
[2:07:57] isn't anywhere in my notes you never
[2:08:00] have to ask brother Matt to do something
[2:08:02] and you'll always find sister Amber and
[2:08:04] the kids right there behind him helping
[2:08:06] every single time you know what nobody
[2:08:09] comes up and says uh we need somebody to
[2:08:11] do this they just do it don't they you
[2:08:14] never have to prod brother Bob to go do
[2:08:17] stuff around this
[2:08:19] building and who is happily traing along
[2:08:23] behind
[2:08:27] him sister
[2:08:29] Brenda why God puts people that can be
[2:08:32] the best where they are
[2:08:36] right you want to introduce
[2:08:39] somebody you want to bring them in
[2:08:41] there's only one person we go to brother
[2:08:45] Joe maybe brother
[2:08:48] Vel
[2:08:50] right
[2:08:52] you want to have somebody that needs to
[2:08:54] come out of Pentecost who are we going
[2:08:55] to send we send the one that came out of
[2:08:58] Pentecost don't
[2:09:00] we you need a hard
[2:09:03] worker brother
[2:09:06] Dale each one ain't nobody sings like
[2:09:09] brother
[2:09:10] Josh but you know what brother Josh we
[2:09:12] didn't put you in as soon as you came in
[2:09:14] did we brother Josh has proven himself
[2:09:18] faithful being a nothing just sitting in
[2:09:21] the Pew worshiping being the part of the
[2:09:24] congregation and meanwhile what's
[2:09:26] everyone doing they're looking at him
[2:09:28] they're saying he's got a gift does he
[2:09:29] have the character to use it
[2:09:31] properly now to be Grant to be fair
[2:09:34] we've been after him for a while before
[2:09:36] he gave in but here's the thing he's got
[2:09:39] to be led too we can't force him into it
[2:09:43] we see those things and so you see these
[2:09:45] people that are placed there
[2:09:47] amen we have men that handle we have
[2:09:49] someone that handles finances in the
[2:09:51] church
[2:09:52] I guess multiples really can I handle
[2:09:54] the finances yes I've done
[2:09:56] it no problem I'd have no problem
[2:09:59] handling the finances of the
[2:10:00] church but
[2:10:03] listen just because I'm in Authority
[2:10:05] doesn't make me the
[2:10:08] best what it ought to do is give me
[2:10:10] character to see those that can do it
[2:10:12] the best and hand it off to them that's
[2:10:14] what a body is supposed to be let's put
[2:10:16] it where the power is let's put it where
[2:10:19] the purpose is amen brother Brown say
[2:10:22] this he says don't ever try don't never
[2:10:24] try to take the other fellow's place God
[2:10:27] made you a certain thing and you stay
[2:10:29] that certain you just stay where you are
[2:10:32] don't try to impersonate the other
[2:10:33] that's what always ruins the gifts that
[2:10:35] God sends to the world we find so many
[2:10:37] carnal impersonations and we find
[2:10:39] someone who tries to copy after the
[2:10:42] other one we look around and we can see
[2:10:45] God has made us a body and ain't one of
[2:10:47] us the same as the other and I say
[2:10:49] praise the Lord if we're a bunch of
[2:10:51] copycats the spirit of the Lord is not
[2:10:54] here cuz that means we've caught in a
[2:10:56] man's anointing rather than the holy
[2:10:58] spirit because the Holy Spirit develops
[2:11:00] us into a multi-member body with
[2:11:02] multiple gifts multiple functions
[2:11:04] multiple ways of looking at things to
[2:11:07] bring balance to bring Health to bring
[2:11:09] structure the way it's supposed to be
[2:11:11] amen God has placed men here and they're
[2:11:14] tested amen we've got brother Mark
[2:11:16] handling the finances if somebody came
[2:11:18] in today that was a chartered accountant
[2:11:19] we wouldn't just say take over the
[2:11:20] finances the church would we we'd see if
[2:11:23] that man's got character first we'll see
[2:11:25] if he's committed we'll see if he's able
[2:11:27] to be under Authority before we put him
[2:11:28] under before we put them in Authority
[2:11:31] what we're proving them by the word
[2:11:32] before we let them take a place in the
[2:11:34] body every one of us has to sit down and
[2:11:36] be
[2:11:37] quiet right and then as we prove
[2:11:40] ourselves faithful the doors start to
[2:11:42] open and that's not man's works that's
[2:11:45] God's Works cuz he brings them in and we
[2:11:47] see here we see what he's done the ones
[2:11:49] he's brought in I mean he's brought
[2:11:50] brother Josh and and brother Grant from
[2:11:52] from all over the place brother Vel from
[2:11:54] all over the place brother
[2:11:56] Emanuel we got people that are Catholics
[2:11:59] we've got people that were Pentecostals
[2:12:00] we got people that knew
[2:12:01] nothing all here brought here for a
[2:12:05] reason for the edifying of the body and
[2:12:08] things change over time we see that we
[2:12:10] see that happen amen sometimes we move
[2:12:12] into more responsibility and sometime
[2:12:14] it's time for us to move into less and
[2:12:16] that's the way it works amen we serve
[2:12:17] for a while and then maybe we don't
[2:12:19] serve for a while we we go in and out of
[2:12:21] service and sometimes we're done service
[2:12:23] and sometimes when we're done our
[2:12:26] emotions rise up or sometimes because
[2:12:29] we're not put in our emotions rise up
[2:12:32] that's not the Holy Spirit doing that
[2:12:34] that's us that's us that's doing it but
[2:12:36] we have to see God's in it all brother
[2:12:38] says this he says but in the word I find
[2:12:40] that God did not intend for the church
[2:12:42] to be governed by intellectuality by or
[2:12:44] by any Theology of man but the Holy
[2:12:46] Spirit was given to the church to govern
[2:12:48] and control the body of Christ and I
[2:12:50] think in doing that that with that in
[2:12:52] mind and in God's program we'll never be
[2:12:55] successful no matter how good our
[2:12:56] intentions are until we get back into
[2:12:58] the center of God's program amen that's
[2:13:02] why we're not a denomination it's man in
[2:13:03] control he says and yet we put our
[2:13:06] intellectuals mixed with it and then we
[2:13:08] can get a conglomeration of both the
[2:13:10] Holy Spirit and intellectuals he says
[2:13:12] and when the Holy now watch what the
[2:13:13] mess this makes he says when the Holy
[2:13:15] Spirit desires to do a thing he says and
[2:13:17] degrade something or lift something up
[2:13:21] up so in other words he tries to lift
[2:13:23] somebody up but sometimes he tries to
[2:13:25] bring somebody down sometimes there's a
[2:13:28] time to lay it down and sometimes
[2:13:29] there's a time to pick it
[2:13:31] up scripture says that God raises men up
[2:13:34] God takes men down he says and when God
[2:13:38] he says when the Holy Spirit desires to
[2:13:39] do those things it causes petty jealousy
[2:13:41] amongst the people which proves they
[2:13:43] haven't got the holy
[2:13:46] spirit let God be God but see we'll say
[2:13:49] it's a well you got a certain family in
[2:13:52] this church that runs things or there's
[2:13:53] Pol politics in the church or this and
[2:13:55] that and the other thing listen we got
[2:13:57] all sorts of groups and people here and
[2:13:59] not all of us agree with each other on
[2:14:01] everything but yet we've got people from
[2:14:03] all walks of life serving in all
[2:14:04] different aspects of this church it's by
[2:14:06] the Holy
[2:14:08] Spirit the thing is are we looking for
[2:14:10] division or are we looking to get in our
[2:14:13] place he says every man would want to be
[2:14:18] in his place in his place what matters
[2:14:20] more to us that we have recognition that
[2:14:23] we have responsibility that we have
[2:14:24] authority that we have some some big
[2:14:27] reputation or that we're where we ought
[2:14:29] to be that's what's supposed to matter
[2:14:31] for us amen it's hard to let go and I
[2:14:33] don't blame people for not wanting to
[2:14:34] let go I think for pastors especially
[2:14:36] it's very difficult to let go because
[2:14:38] it's their life's work it's their life's
[2:14:40] work they have literally uh given their
[2:14:43] their health their bodies everything to
[2:14:46] preaching the word and then to step away
[2:14:48] from that it seems like what is my
[2:14:49] purpose but their forgetting that their
[2:14:51] purpose was all
[2:14:53] along and now it's time for somebody
[2:14:55] else you know if we're filled with the
[2:14:57] spirit we can see that sometimes we've
[2:14:59] got to let go and sometimes we've got to
[2:15:01] step up amen and it's both the working
[2:15:03] of the Holy Spirit and when we see those
[2:15:05] changes coming and those changes
[2:15:07] happening we ought to be able to say
[2:15:08] praise the Lord amen I've got the utmost
[2:15:11] respect for brother Bob and brother Mark
[2:15:13] for how they stepped aside as
[2:15:15] deacons though they were still the most
[2:15:18] qualified in the church no doubt about
[2:15:20] it
[2:15:21] but yet they stepped aside and they said
[2:15:23] it's time for the younger men to get
[2:15:26] involved for the sake of the Body for
[2:15:30] the sake of the body and listen was it
[2:15:32] all easy did it all go perfectly
[2:15:37] no but we see today the fruit of that
[2:15:41] transition that change of people saying
[2:15:44] it's time for me to let go and it's time
[2:15:47] for somebody else to step up and we see
[2:15:50] that it literally improves the church
[2:15:52] cuz we don't lose the wisdom we don't
[2:15:55] lose the input but what does it causes
[2:15:57] people to dig deeper cuz now more people
[2:15:59] are relying on them brother Gerald when
[2:16:01] he finally resigned what was it he
[2:16:04] decided it's time to let it go and then
[2:16:07] he just did
[2:16:08] it no Fanfare no nothing just said I'm
[2:16:13] laying My Sword Down sends an email out
[2:16:15] and says God Bless you that's it I'm
[2:16:18] done and then he steps back what for the
[2:16:21] sake of the body I've run my course I've
[2:16:25] finished my race and that's it and
[2:16:28] there's nothing wrong with laying it
[2:16:29] down absolutely absolutely nothing wrong
[2:16:32] with
[2:16:33] it why we're not
[2:16:36] selfish we're doing what's best for the
[2:16:38] body I'm going to close with these
[2:16:40] quotes So musicians can come he says
[2:16:43] this church is supposed to be
[2:16:45] predestinated under the adoption of
[2:16:46] children where God can take a man and
[2:16:49] adopt him into the family and give him
[2:16:52] something he says then first try that
[2:16:55] and see if it's right the Bible said try
[2:16:56] the spirit this man claims a certain
[2:16:58] thing try it and see if it's right if
[2:17:00] it's his right move right with it then
[2:17:03] say Lord send us something else let's
[2:17:06] not just rest on what we have he says
[2:17:08] send us something else he says keep
[2:17:09] moving see just keep moving till every
[2:17:12] fellow takes his
[2:17:15] place watch he says then you're going to
[2:17:18] see the Church of God begin to get his
[2:17:20] place when we start to say Lord what's
[2:17:22] your will Lord what's your position
[2:17:24] what's your place where's the
[2:17:25] responsibility you want me to carry Lord
[2:17:27] what's my post of
[2:17:29] Duty he says then the Church of God
[2:17:31] begins to take its
[2:17:33] place he says then is when the
[2:17:36] Philistines will go to backing
[2:17:38] up he says the shorts will go off the
[2:17:40] hair will grow down the faces will be
[2:17:42] washed the cigars will be missing that's
[2:17:44] right when the church begins to get into
[2:17:46] its Mighty power then we have an anas of
[2:17:49] fire and a few of them he says yes sir
[2:17:51] you'll see when that Holy Church stands
[2:17:53] together in his
[2:17:55] power positionally placed as sons of God
[2:17:59] adopted into the family of God a
[2:18:01] powerful Church standing there in its
[2:18:03] Glory he says oh that's what he's coming
[2:18:06] for amen let's stand together if we
[2:18:12] would where
[2:18:14] is the power from in the body
[2:18:18] Unity when your body works together as a
[2:18:21] unit that's when it's most powerful but
[2:18:23] when you sit there and try and do things
[2:18:24] your own way it's got to be my way or
[2:18:27] the highway you know what you are a
[2:18:29] sheep alone you're a part trying to do
[2:18:32] it yourself but he's saying the power
[2:18:33] comes when we will humble ourselves and
[2:18:36] say God what's your purpose what's your
[2:18:38] place what's your plan and then help me
[2:18:41] to get there and stay there and when we
[2:18:43] do that no
[2:18:44] friction everything just works together
[2:18:47] the power goes where it needs to go to
[2:18:50] produce what
[2:18:51] the word for its time and
[2:18:52] season it's people that are led by the
[2:18:55] spirit that can be used by the spirit to
[2:18:58] produce the word of God each in its
[2:19:02] place
[2:19:04] content
[2:19:06] resting trusting satisfied that God
[2:19:10] you're using me that ought to be our
[2:19:12] desire Lord use me then let him choose
[2:19:15] how he uses us and you'll see that when
[2:19:17] you Embrace that the opportunities just
[2:19:20] start to grow grow and grow and grow and
[2:19:22] all of a sudden you'll look back a year
[2:19:23] or two later and you'll say oh my
[2:19:25] goodness just by being that faithful
[2:19:27] little
[2:19:29] wife that child that goes to school and
[2:19:32] won't Bend and won't
[2:19:34] bow that'll stand for what's right that
[2:19:37] man that goes to work
[2:19:39] faithfully and professes that he's a Son
[2:19:41] of God and he lives a life that backs it
[2:19:43] up you'll see fruit from it every single
[2:19:45] time you'll see it in your homes you'll
[2:19:47] see it in your church you'll see it in
[2:19:48] your workplace and we've seen it we've
[2:19:50] seen it that people can see in you and
[2:19:52] us a
[2:19:54] difference why because we found our
[2:19:56] place in Christ that we've recognize
[2:19:59] we've got a purpose we're not walking
[2:20:00] around aimlessly from Pillar To Post but
[2:20:02] we're saying Lord I'm in your will I'm
[2:20:04] in your way and that means that there's
[2:20:05] things that are supposed to be happening
[2:20:07] Lord help me to catch it Lord help me to
[2:20:09] be to give a word in due season Amen to
[2:20:13] step into what you have for me to not
[2:20:15] just run around and think that this is
[2:20:17] just life but to say Lord I'm here as a
[2:20:19] witness to glorify you and testify of
[2:20:21] your goodness and Grace that's what he's
[2:20:23] looking for in adopted Sons and
[2:20:24] Daughters Lord I'm here to do your will
[2:20:27] help me to catch it amen God bless you
[2:20:30] let's bow our heads Heavenly
[2:20:34] Father Lord what rest we ought to have
[2:20:36] that You' called us Lord you prepared us
[2:20:39] you built us Lord for a place for each

[2:20:44] of us that's left out there's not one of
[2:20:46] us that's not important Lord but each

[2:20:55] it Lord when it seems like nothing's

[2:21:10] having no effect Lord let us be able in
[2:21:13] those storms and cloudy days Lord may we
[2:21:16] trust that you're working all things for
[2:21:17] our good Lord that we're not walking
[2:21:20] aimless through this life that we
[2:21:22] haven't just landed here Lord that this
[2:21:25] is not just a a temporary place or post
[2:21:27] Lord but that this is where you would

[2:21:38] aside our own ideas Lord and desires
