[47:08] just one of Ella here I don't think I've
[47:10] had her in service so I moved here in
[47:12] 2020 so it's been a long time coming
[47:14] certainly glad to see you sister
[47:16] trusting God will bless you amen
[47:18] appreciate each one coming out I know
[47:20] it's been a long week and long work and
[47:22] all the cares of life that come up but
[47:24] we come in here to worship a prince of
[47:26] peace amen and almighty God that sees
[47:30] our lives and knows our thoughts and
[47:31] knows our needs it sees the inner things
[47:34] that we don't talk about to anybody else
[47:36] I mean I was praying with brother Dwayne
[47:38] in there and I believe God has sent us a
[47:40] gift
[47:42] does a man and that man is a gift and
[47:44] that man has a gift and the Holy Spirit
[47:46] will use him if you'll trust if you'll
[47:49] believe listen we'll get out what we put
[47:52] in we'll get out what we expect if we
[47:54] come here expecting nothing we'll get
[47:56] exactly that we'll get nothing except
[47:58] for the grace of God
[47:59] remember when we come in and we're
[48:01] pulling and we're drawing and we're
[48:02] expecting and we're saying Lord speak to
[48:04] me speak to my family speak to our
[48:06] situation that's when God moves on the
[48:08] scene amen he loves to hear his people
[48:10] cry out he loves a people that'll say
[48:13] his word back to him and say Lord we're
[48:14] depending on you Lord we're trusting you
[48:16] this evening and this weekend to use
[48:18] brother Dwayne to minister to our hearts
[48:20] and our lives so as he comes I want us
[48:23] to just sing that song Holy Spirit
[48:25] welcome welcome
[48:26] Holy Spirit do we know that one
[48:29] let's sing that and you just put your
[48:31] need before him
[48:32] don't look at the man
[48:34] don't look at the men
[48:36] I've talked with him for an hour today
[48:37] he showed up at 2 30. we talked for an
[48:40] hour and then he went downstairs and had
[48:42] quiet time and studied and prayed before
[48:43] the Lord he knows nothing he knows
[48:45] nothing about anything we caught up and
[48:47] we talked about the weather mostly and
[48:50] how it could possibly change for the
[48:52] better
[48:53] so he knows nothing absolutely nothing
[48:55] tonight so whatever you hear that's for
[48:57] you that's from God that's from God
[48:59] that's what we're expecting that's what
[49:01] the supernatural does in our midst is it
[49:03] sees the things that we don't talk about
[49:04] and it comes in and it touches us it
[49:06] encourages us and then I believe there's
[49:08] healing tonight I believe there's
[49:10] Deliverance I believe there's
[49:11] discernment I believe there's direction
[49:13] there's leadership whatever you have
[49:14] need of tonight encouragement
[49:16] whatever you have need of in this
[49:18] weekend I believe God's here to meet
[49:19] that need amen so let's sing that song

[55:31] have been blessed to have been in a lot
[55:32] of places
[55:33] and brother Dale we go back a long long
[55:37] long ways and of course brother Jonathan
[55:39] I do too but
[55:42] he's starting to get the same kind of
[55:44] haircut that I got but brother Dale and
[55:46] I kind of understand each other and
[55:48] you know we were all yeah I know you
[55:51] sisters you look at me and you know us
[55:54] old men now but we were once young like
[55:56] you guys you know we're here at Jonathan
[56:00] last time him and his wife were around
[56:02] my place you know here they had these
[56:04] couple of children about that big and
[56:06] you know just growing up and and kids
[56:10] and now I look at them and here's this
[56:12] beautiful young lady and and there's
[56:14] Jonathan and he's just about as big as I
[56:16] am of course that's no big
[56:17] accomplishment just in case you're
[56:19] wondering we got all the you know all
[56:22] the young people in our church all you
[56:24] know they all they like to come and
[56:25] shake my hand and they immediately look
[56:27] up to see you know where have I beat
[56:29] them have I got past him yet and and uh
[56:32] well I'm
[56:33] I would like to say if I could have had
[56:36] my way I would like to have been six
[56:37] foot you know you know big strap and
[56:40] handsome you know that's what my wife
[56:41] always wanted big strap and handsome
[56:43] rich
[56:44] I said I don't know what happened but
[56:46] somehow she got none of the above
[56:49] the only thing she got is a uh you know
[56:52] someone that's
[56:55] that the Lord has been able to mold a
[56:57] little character into along the way and
[56:58] I'm sure thankful she stuck with me
[57:00] through it all and I'm happy to have my
[57:02] wife sister Connie with me tonight and I
[57:05] shouldn't normally embarrass her but why
[57:07] don't you just stand so the people at
[57:08] least can have I know I know
[57:11] but we're just a handful and I'll just
[57:13] be honest you know if we're family of
[57:15] God then I just feel like family that's
[57:17] that's how I am and you know it's um
[57:22] I'm not maybe as friendly as her dad no
[57:24] maybe some of you know brother mental
[57:25] freeze and years ago there was a group
[57:27] called The Believers saying you know I'm
[57:31] saying all the gospel songs and and Ritz
[57:33] wrote so many of their own songs and you
[57:35] know for years they were probably one of
[57:38] the only message groups that sang and I
[57:42] just happened to marry
[57:44] um
[57:44] I want to say the main one's daughter
[57:46] but he wasn't he was just one of the
[57:48] singers but he became a pastor of course
[57:50] you many of you know him as a pastor
[57:52] brother mental Friesen from Saskatchewan
[57:54] I had the privilege of marrying his
[57:56] daughter he's pastored now for my 40
[58:01] 243 years
[58:03] something like that I'm guessing and and
[58:06] uh just this last year
[58:09] uh
[58:11] you know he said well you know what
[58:13] um
[58:14] I've put in a lot of time already and
[58:16] it's time for it's time for somebody
[58:18] else to carry the load and it's not like
[58:22] you know it's not like he's hanging up
[58:23] his coat so to speak we still use them
[58:26] still has a ministry that's one thing
[58:29] about you know
[58:30] some of the Saints we get a little older
[58:33] and we think well God's done with us now
[58:34] and and I'll say this
[58:39] um I don't is brother Lush here tonight
[58:41] he didn't come well
[58:43] I sure am looking forward to getting to
[58:45] meet him uh you know those men you
[58:47] saints that have put in I don't want to
[58:49] call it just put in time but it's been
[58:51] you brothers and sisters that have
[58:53] you know you're hewed down out here you
[58:56] blew up the rocks and pulled out the
[58:58] trees and and you made the roads and and
[59:01] now you've given us something to run on
[59:05] you know this glorious gospel what would
[59:07] it be I'll just say this you know there
[59:09] I I really feel this way in my heart
[59:11] there's nothing there's nothing more
[59:13] glorious than for a daddy to be able to
[59:16] look back and see his children
[59:18] following in his footsteps you know
[59:20] that's the desire of every every daddy
[59:22] is to see his children following in his
[59:24] footsteps and you know Brown makes a
[59:26] comment one time and of course I'm in a
[59:28] message church so I can say brother
[59:29] Brandon said I I think that's all right
[59:31] I I'll just be honest I believe that
[59:33] there was a messenger and I believe that
[59:36] we shouldn't be ashamed to use his name
[59:38] I don't believe that he came to point to
[59:40] himself he came to point us right back
[59:42] to Christ who is the word who is still
[59:45] alive tonight
[59:46] and I'm so thankful that he's given us
[59:49] something you know spiritually we have
[59:51] something to run on but but what would
[59:53] happen Brothers if that message never
[59:55] would have caught
[59:56] what would happen is if we would have
[59:58] just remained as a as a Baptist or a
[1:00:00] Catholic or or or a Pentecostal as
[1:00:03] lovely a people as they are and I'm not
[1:00:05] saying anything against the people but
[1:00:07] what would have happened if that message
[1:00:09] would not have caught and dropped into
[1:00:11] your life
[1:00:13] because it took I want to say this it
[1:00:15] took a fresh Flame
[1:00:17] it took a fresh flame Pentecost had
[1:00:19] already burned down and and when you
[1:00:21] begin to look at what that has produced
[1:00:24] in the last 50 years look at where it's
[1:00:27] gone maybe when it originally maybe it
[1:00:28] didn't get too far off but look what
[1:00:30] it's produced in the last 50 years and
[1:00:32] we look at their children and we look at
[1:00:34] at their families and we look at their
[1:00:36] worship and and the complete sodomy and
[1:00:39] the and the horrible things that we see
[1:00:43] right behind the pulpits in their
[1:00:45] churches
[1:00:47] and then we can thank God that God did
[1:00:50] send a message
[1:00:51] we can thank God that there was a that
[1:00:54] the light of God moved and there was
[1:00:55] somebody when the message came there was
[1:00:58] somebody that could receive that message
[1:00:59] and walked live that life live listen
[1:01:03] church I I don't know about you but I've
[1:01:05] I hear this spoken Lawson and now if I
[1:01:08] step on anybody's toes I certainly am
[1:01:09] not meaning to tonight I don't know
[1:01:11] anybody so I'm just going to be me if
[1:01:13] that's all right and and when you don't
[1:01:14] if you don't like it just send me home
[1:01:16] it'll be all right I'll love you anyhow
[1:01:18] and but but I hear this so often you
[1:01:21] know we get to preaching the message the
[1:01:22] message the message the message and I
[1:01:24] believe there's not one of us sitting
[1:01:25] here but doesn't believe the message
[1:01:27] uh but I'll tell you what the message is
[1:01:29] not just a word or a letter or a
[1:01:32] Doctrine the message is a life the
[1:01:35] message is Christ we have listen this is
[1:01:38] the Bible but it can sit on every shelf
[1:01:40] in this country in this part of the
[1:01:42] country and if it does not if the if the
[1:01:45] life of this word does not get into
[1:01:47] somebody it means nothing it's just a
[1:01:50] dead letter
[1:01:51] listen you can have all the tapes you
[1:01:53] want you can have we've got every
[1:01:54] message available to us we are the Most
[1:01:57] Blessed people on the face of the Earth
[1:01:58] but if the life of the word does not
[1:02:01] find a being to live in this the Bible
[1:02:04] says the word was made flesh and you say
[1:02:06] well that was that was Jesus brother
[1:02:07] Dwayne but listen he also he went away
[1:02:10] but the body of Christ now lives and the
[1:02:14] word is still being made flesh you are
[1:02:17] the word of this age God you are the
[1:02:20] manifestation of the sons of God of this
[1:02:22] age and so what would it be if these
[1:02:25] brothers had not taken and received that
[1:02:27] word and their life had not come into it
[1:02:30] and lived in front of you come on
[1:02:32] brother some of you are some of you are
[1:02:34] younger than I and if you hadn't watched
[1:02:35] a life that you could look at and it
[1:02:37] wasn't like brother Branham said you
[1:02:39] know that that drunk man and his little
[1:02:41] boy how they went out at Christmas and
[1:02:43] he was you know he's just in all of his
[1:02:45] uh all he was he just went out to enjoy
[1:02:48] and and fellowship with the neighbors
[1:02:49] and he took his little son with him and
[1:02:51] and you know it went from house to house
[1:02:53] and and there they had a little you know
[1:02:55] they shared their cheers I know each
[1:02:57] each house got another cheer and then he
[1:03:00] had another drink and and then he got
[1:03:01] another drink and pretty soon you know
[1:03:03] he got walking along and you know he he
[1:03:06] just he couldn't quite
[1:03:08] he was trying to walk he thought he was
[1:03:10] walking straight but you know and then
[1:03:12] one at one point he looked back at his
[1:03:14] son and he watched his son doing the
[1:03:16] same things you know kind of
[1:03:21] he's like what are you doing
[1:03:24] what did little boy tell him
[1:03:27] Daddy
[1:03:29] I'm following in your footsteps
[1:03:32] I'm following in your footsteps
[1:03:36] now I thank God
[1:03:38] I want to rest my case I thank God for
[1:03:40] Godly men
[1:03:42] who didn't stagger this way and stagger
[1:03:45] that way but they walked a straight line
[1:03:47] so that you and I
[1:03:49] I'm not talking about these Elders here
[1:03:50] I'm going to look at the the younger
[1:03:52] generation sitting at the back
[1:03:54] sitting at the back my goodness
[1:03:59] only thing I can think is brother
[1:04:01] Jonathan warned you that
[1:04:04] that I drool and slobber and spit when I
[1:04:06] preach and that's probably why I told
[1:04:07] you it all sit at the back so
[1:04:09] you love the Lord tonight
[1:04:11] hey man I I certainly feel the same just
[1:04:14] let me bring you greetings from home
[1:04:17] from Saskatchewan in case some of you
[1:04:19] don't know that's still part of Canada
[1:04:20] we're kind of like tie everybody
[1:04:21] together and uh
[1:04:24] from the church back at home brother
[1:04:26] Meadow and the Saints there just uh you
[1:04:29] know I've
[1:04:32] I guess I've been I've been
[1:04:34] officially voted in to be their Pastor
[1:04:36] now and and so I'm realizing that the
[1:04:40] role as the role changes so does the
[1:04:42] responsibilities and and brother Dale of
[1:04:44] course you knew me when I've traveled
[1:04:45] much when I was on the Evangelistic
[1:04:48] field and so many years ago the Lord
[1:04:50] called me matters of fact um uh you know
[1:04:53] he I can I can tell this testimony now I
[1:04:55] told it I used to tell it I don't
[1:04:57] actually I didn't used to tell I only
[1:04:59] told it a couple times because it's an
[1:05:01] actual reality of my life and but of
[1:05:04] course you know young married and and
[1:05:08] um
[1:05:09] just happy you know I was a happy
[1:05:12] Christian happy in the Lord and had a
[1:05:14] beautiful wife and had a little family
[1:05:16] and then then the Lord you know you know
[1:05:18] how sometimes when
[1:05:20] when you
[1:05:22] when things start changing in your life
[1:05:23] you know you get unsettled and you don't
[1:05:25] understand why and nothing seems to be
[1:05:27] satisfying anymore you can't quite
[1:05:29] understand why and and I you know it's
[1:05:31] not sometimes
[1:05:33] sometimes it's not really anything
[1:05:34] except God trying to get a hold of you
[1:05:36] trying to trying to get your attention
[1:05:38] to do something and and so sometimes we
[1:05:40] get we struggle with those things and
[1:05:43] anyhow I had
[1:05:44] I had I had the Lord
[1:05:47] deal with me in a way you know I was
[1:05:50] Deacon in the church and my wife was the
[1:05:52] piano player and
[1:05:53] of course my father-in-law is the pastor
[1:05:55] and
[1:05:56] a
[1:05:58] I'm just a
[1:05:59] just an average working boy just the
[1:06:01] same as everybody else and and uh
[1:06:05] I was in one of those places where just
[1:06:07] something wasn't setting and I couldn't
[1:06:08] I just couldn't finally I told my wife
[1:06:10] uh you know all my buddies lived out in
[1:06:13] farming country and and there was a
[1:06:16] brother out there who sold farm
[1:06:17] equipment and he used to be a friend of
[1:06:18] my family and so he used to come all the
[1:06:20] time and every time he'd see me say
[1:06:21] brother Dwayne when are you coming to
[1:06:22] work for me when are you coming to work
[1:06:23] for me and I didn't I'm going to be
[1:06:25] honest I my dad had a couple cows when
[1:06:27] we grew up like 20 or 30 cows but I
[1:06:29] didn't know anything about farming or
[1:06:30] farming equipment or anything like that
[1:06:33] but I got to the place in my life where
[1:06:34] where I said you know what um honey if
[1:06:38] brother Dave ever asks I'm gonna go
[1:06:40] and of course she's a flat out City Girl
[1:06:44] you know that likes to shop and likes to
[1:06:46] go for tea and coffee and all those
[1:06:48] things and you know how God puts
[1:06:50] opposites together any of you married
[1:06:52] people ever understand anything about
[1:06:53] that yeah some of you under you know
[1:06:55] what you're talking about God you know
[1:06:57] what you know why because God knows that
[1:06:58] only love
[1:07:00] Only Love Will persist
[1:07:02] and anyhow
[1:07:06] the reality is brother Dave did come and
[1:07:08] ask me again I met him one time and and
[1:07:10] he asked me and I'm like oh my word that
[1:07:12] was about two months after I said that
[1:07:13] to my wife and I looked him in the face
[1:07:15] and I said oh my Lord Brother Dave
[1:07:17] that's exactly the same statement I told
[1:07:19] my wife two months ago and he just
[1:07:21] looked at me said well I want you to
[1:07:22] pray about it and I want you to
[1:07:24] then I want you to make your decision
[1:07:25] let me know because I'd like you to come
[1:07:28] so we moved to a we're about to move
[1:07:30] about two hours away from home
[1:07:32] and um
[1:07:34] I was going to work one morning
[1:07:37] and I was wondering Austin it just
[1:07:39] dawned on me I mean here's my family and
[1:07:41] all the people I love and my wife's
[1:07:43] family in the church and I'm going into
[1:07:45] the middle of nowheres to do something I
[1:07:47] know nothing about
[1:07:49] the people I love
[1:07:51] the church
[1:07:53] it was different than ours and and you
[1:07:56] know and sometimes we we struggle with
[1:07:58] things like that and I'm driving I'm
[1:08:00] driving out of my driveway and I'm
[1:08:02] thinking Lord
[1:08:03] what am I doing
[1:08:06] and God is my witness
[1:08:08] I'll tell you what I had this little old
[1:08:10] beater car
[1:08:12] and uh just driving it to work and I'm
[1:08:14] thinking Lord what am I doing
[1:08:16] two little kids
[1:08:18] a wife a church what am I doing
[1:08:23] and just as clear as I'm talking to you
[1:08:27] of voices to me
[1:08:29] you're going there to preach
[1:08:33] and then it made a statement
[1:08:35] you're going to be the new pastor
[1:08:38] I didn't have nothing like that even in
[1:08:39] my mind ever that was the furthest it
[1:08:41] never even entered my mind that I would
[1:08:43] be preaching the gospel
[1:08:45] and so I laughed out loud
[1:08:48] as awkward as this sounds I I literally
[1:08:51] I was in my car and I was like I
[1:08:53] actually said these words and Lord
[1:08:54] forgive me I I it was so loud it's so
[1:08:57] real to me and I I say it was allowed
[1:08:59] like this it might not have been audible
[1:09:00] but it was that loud in my car
[1:09:03] and it was that loud to me and I started
[1:09:05] I actually laughed out loud and I said
[1:09:07] that's ridiculous
[1:09:12] and I moved to conistino
[1:09:17] at some point
[1:09:19] that never left me
[1:09:22] at what that voice spoke to me never
[1:09:24] left me
[1:09:26] I could never get away from it and
[1:09:28] within a couple years in you know the
[1:09:31] man that was a pastor at the time or
[1:09:32] overseeing the congregation I mean this
[1:09:35] burden was just all over me and I
[1:09:37] thought this is ridiculous I I'm not a
[1:09:39] preacher I'm a I'm a farmer or I'm my
[1:09:41] dad was in all my dad's they're all in
[1:09:43] construction all my family is business
[1:09:45] people I'm not a I'm not a preacher
[1:09:48] I couldn't get away from funny one day I
[1:09:50] threw up my arms I said Lord I don't
[1:09:51] know what to do but if this is you
[1:09:53] calling me then you'll have to ask
[1:09:54] brother Dave to ask me because there's
[1:09:57] no way I'm going to go and ask him
[1:09:59] wouldn't you know it he has an accident
[1:10:02] on his four-wheeler and he ends up in
[1:10:04] the hospital and he's laying in traction
[1:10:06] whether he's my boss and he's
[1:10:08] a big man about 350 pounds and he's
[1:10:10] laying with his leg up in traction like
[1:10:12] this
[1:10:13] and of course we're very good friends so
[1:10:15] I I mean he's my boss but we're friends
[1:10:17] and so when I went into this hospital to
[1:10:19] see him
[1:10:21] I just stood at the door and I started
[1:10:22] laughing and of course you know he rode
[1:10:25] Polaris and
[1:10:26] I wrote something else and so I began to
[1:10:29] just banish her back and forth and he
[1:10:30] just stopped me just like that like
[1:10:32] we're just in the middle of it and he
[1:10:33] just looked at me says when are you
[1:10:34] going to preach for us
[1:10:37] I like to died
[1:10:44] 29 years ago he told me I'd be a pastor
[1:10:49] and today I am
[1:10:52] so that doesn't make me anything any
[1:10:54] different than anybody else
[1:10:57] all I'm saying is that what God speaks
[1:11:01] he keeps his word when God it doesn't
[1:11:04] make me any I'm just the same ordinary
[1:11:06] person that I've always been but when
[1:11:08] God speaks he keeps his word and so I
[1:11:12] told him I would never
[1:11:13] if he's calling me then I'm not the kind
[1:11:15] of person to go and you know it's really
[1:11:17] interesting I don't I don't even know
[1:11:19] why I'm saying this tonight this isn't
[1:11:23] I'm not I was never the kind of person
[1:11:25] that was afraid of anything
[1:11:27] except this
[1:11:34] to hold the purchase of God's blood in
[1:11:37] your hands
[1:11:39] scares me but the Johnson said you get
[1:11:41] nervous I said every time
[1:11:43] every time because I know
[1:11:47] that I don't know how to do this but I
[1:11:49] know he does
[1:11:51] so anyhow you uh
[1:11:55] I trust you came with expectation that
[1:11:57] the Lord will meet your need tonight and
[1:11:58] I didn't say all that I hope I hope I
[1:12:00] hope didn't sound like I was saying that
[1:12:01] to make me something I was just saying I
[1:12:04] didn't never expect to be behind the
[1:12:05] pulpit
[1:12:06] but if God ever speaks something you
[1:12:08] will never run far enough
[1:12:10] listen you might say well God only
[1:12:12] speaks to prophets no he doesn't
[1:12:14] no he doesn't only speak a prophet is
[1:12:16] the Divine interpreter of the word but
[1:12:18] God does not just only speak to prophets
[1:12:20] God speaks to people
[1:12:22] that little still Small Voice Samuel
[1:12:24] Samuel
[1:12:27] what was that
[1:12:29] that same God still lives that same God
[1:12:32] still lives I just believe that with all
[1:12:34] my heart and so tonight
[1:12:36] um if you got your Bibles with you I
[1:12:38] hope that was you got a little idea of
[1:12:40] who I am now and and how oh please don't
[1:12:43] I hope I didn't say it the wrong way I
[1:12:45] get I get all nervous when I say stuff
[1:12:47] like that that it makes me look like I'm
[1:12:49] oh you're I actually never I you know
[1:12:52] when I gave that testimony I told two
[1:12:54] different people
[1:12:56] this is terrible but in my journey
[1:12:58] I told two different people two
[1:13:00] different men that were pastors I didn't
[1:13:02] understand that I was just a boy and
[1:13:05] didn't understand what that meant
[1:13:07] and so I was I was only looking for
[1:13:09] Direction but every time I gave that
[1:13:11] statement
[1:13:13] it would be like
[1:13:16] and that would be the last
[1:13:19] and I would Minister very little
[1:13:21] after that
[1:13:23] so after that I just backed up and I
[1:13:24] thought well Lord I don't know what is
[1:13:25] going on
[1:13:27] but I know you're in control of my life
[1:13:30] and so anyhow I'm not afraid to give the
[1:13:32] testimony anymore because it's history
[1:13:34] and it's true
[1:13:37] and I think I don't know why I said all
[1:13:39] that tonight but I do want to read a
[1:13:41] scripture and it hadn't I see now it
[1:13:42] ties perfectly together and that wasn't
[1:13:44] in my notes at all so would you stand
[1:13:46] with me
[1:13:47] wow
[1:13:48] I'd rather I'd rather have just
[1:13:50] walk down and shaken all your hands and
[1:13:53] got to know you and I guess we'll get to
[1:13:56] do that this weekend anyhow if you got
[1:13:58] your Bibles with you turn over to First
[1:14:00] John chapter 3.
[1:14:05] first John chapter 3.
[1:14:18] why don't we start at verse one and
[1:14:19] brother have you got verse one there by
[1:14:21] any chance you do why don't we start at
[1:14:22] verse one
[1:14:26] I was asking the Lord trying to find the
[1:14:29] mind of the Lord for the weekend and for
[1:14:31] the services and sometimes that's just
[1:14:33] not so easy and
[1:14:34] you know your mind's going every time
[1:14:36] Lord no I just need a Direction Lord I
[1:14:38] need a direction and so
[1:14:40] um
[1:14:41] anyhow why don't we begin to read here
[1:14:43] first John chapter 3
[1:14:46] behold
[1:14:47] what manner of love the father hath to
[1:14:50] bestowed upon us
[1:14:51] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:14:55] and therefore
[1:14:56] the world knoweth us not
[1:14:59] because it knew him not hold on you know
[1:15:02] Saints I I don't think we should just
[1:15:05] read over that
[1:15:07] I think we need to look at that really
[1:15:09] seriously tonight I believe this word of
[1:15:11] God brother I'm told us this is a love
[1:15:12] letter to us there's only going to be a
[1:15:14] certain elect group of people that are
[1:15:16] actually going to understand what the
[1:15:18] spirit is saying and so I I want to go
[1:15:21] back and just read that again and I want
[1:15:23] us to see how the wording is on it
[1:15:25] because this is if God is speaking to
[1:15:27] his elect lady then look at how he
[1:15:29] addresses her
[1:15:31] behold
[1:15:33] what manner of love
[1:15:35] father hath bestowed upon us
[1:15:38] that we
[1:15:40] now you can just put your name in there
[1:15:41] tonight
[1:15:42] that we should be called
[1:15:44] sons of God
[1:15:46] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:15:50] because it knew him not
[1:15:52] verse Two Brothers
[1:15:55] beloved
[1:15:57] now I don't know about you but I think
[1:15:58] that's somebody that cares a lot for us
[1:16:01] beloved
[1:16:02] now are we the sons of God
[1:16:05] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:16:07] be but we know that when he shall appear
[1:16:10] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:16:13] him
[1:16:14] as he is
[1:16:15] let's add a blessing add that God's
[1:16:17] blessing to the word tonight Heavenly
[1:16:18] Father once again Lord we just come
[1:16:21] again looking for your direction tonight
[1:16:23] father knowing Lord that your word is
[1:16:26] life and it is life to us father
[1:16:28] so ask the Lord that you would meet our
[1:16:30] needs according to your the great
[1:16:32] banquet table that you set in Jesus name
[1:16:35] amen and amen God bless you can take
[1:16:38] your seats tonight and yeah you know I I
[1:16:40] think when we get looking at the
[1:16:43] scripture sometimes you know I think our
[1:16:45] Humanity maybe uh gets the best of us we
[1:16:49] read these things and we we almost if
[1:16:51] we're not careful friends we get to
[1:16:53] looking at it we just read over it like
[1:16:54] it's a newspaper and you know and you
[1:16:57] know we just one page after another page
[1:16:59] and while I've done my devotions and I
[1:17:00] close my Bible and and away I go but but
[1:17:03] if we ever get into the spirit of the
[1:17:05] composer if we can ever enter into the
[1:17:08] spirit and I think it's so important
[1:17:09] when we're uh you know as as we're as
[1:17:12] we're walking with the Lord I think it's
[1:17:13] so important that that we take time to
[1:17:16] get in his presence uh you know I know
[1:17:18] there's times when life is busy for
[1:17:20] everybody but you know there's times
[1:17:22] when you're you're driving down the road
[1:17:24] and you've only got 20 minutes so you
[1:17:25] you know you push play or you turn on a
[1:17:28] Bible app and you listen while you're
[1:17:29] driving I think all those things are
[1:17:31] good I got nothing against any of my I
[1:17:33] believe God gives us these things
[1:17:35] because he knew we'd be in a busy world
[1:17:36] but there's times when you need to pull
[1:17:39] away
[1:17:39] I say this I don't believe just twice a
[1:17:42] week or three times a week I believe you
[1:17:43] need to do this on a daily basis we need
[1:17:46] to pull away and we need to get in the
[1:17:47] presence of God and just let the Holy
[1:17:50] Spirit begin to reveal himself to us
[1:17:51] just let them begin to to make himself
[1:17:54] known you you know what I'm talking
[1:17:55] about that real sweet presence of God
[1:17:57] when he comes down it just begins to
[1:17:59] bathe your soul and he begins to make
[1:18:02] himself and all of a sudden the word
[1:18:04] just becomes life it just becomes so
[1:18:07] real to us and
[1:18:08] I got to read in this scripture some
[1:18:10] time ago and and I got to thinking about
[1:18:12] you know we it's it's hard for us if
[1:18:15] we're honest it's hard for us because we
[1:18:17] look at this so much this flesh being
[1:18:20] has uh you know we're so we're so caught
[1:18:23] in these in these senses that we live in
[1:18:25] and everything about this world is
[1:18:27] tangible and if you were honest you got
[1:18:29] up in the morning and and you had a list
[1:18:31] that was that long to do your feet hit
[1:18:33] the floor and already you were engaged
[1:18:36] and I got to get this done and this done
[1:18:37] and this done because tonight he's got
[1:18:38] church coming and we've got to be ready
[1:18:40] for church and we got to leave at a
[1:18:41] certain time and we've got to have
[1:18:42] breakfast and dinner and supper you know
[1:18:45] our mind is just it's everywhere is
[1:18:47] right and and so and in that all of a
[1:18:49] sudden the pressures of it and we get
[1:18:51] under we get under pressure and then we
[1:18:53] find ourselves we slip and we say things
[1:18:55] wrong act wrong and and you know we
[1:18:58] respond wrong and then when we we hear
[1:19:01] the scripture speak like this and now
[1:19:03] are we the sons of God I'll tell you
[1:19:05] what maybe for a veteran it's not it's
[1:19:07] maybe not so hard but for for The Young
[1:19:09] and the middle age growing through
[1:19:11] finding that peace in God in in a time
[1:19:14] when you're wrestling with your flesh
[1:19:16] when you're fighting against listen all
[1:19:18] hell is against what we're standing for
[1:19:20] tonight all hell is against you tonight
[1:19:22] all hell is against you and I coming to
[1:19:25] the Revelation that right now we are the
[1:19:28] sons of God this it does not say
[1:19:30] anything about that you are going to be
[1:19:32] the sons of God listen church we are not
[1:19:35] waiting for a Rapture to make us sons of
[1:19:37] God we are sons of God right now and if
[1:19:41] you're like me you're going to struggle
[1:19:42] with that thought you're going to
[1:19:43] struggle with your flesh and you're
[1:19:45] going to look in the mirror and say oh
[1:19:46] God how could I be a Son of God and look
[1:19:49] at the way I am this this wretched vile
[1:19:52] person you know Paul said the same thing
[1:19:54] he said all this Wretched Man that I am
[1:19:56] we're not going to do good then Evil's
[1:19:59] present and what I want to do I don't do
[1:20:01] and what I shouldn't do I I end up doing
[1:20:03] but listen church that has nothing to do
[1:20:06] with your position in Christ or if we
[1:20:10] could just get if there's one thing that
[1:20:11] Satan doesn't want us to know it's the
[1:20:14] reality that right now this man right
[1:20:17] now despite every mistake I made this
[1:20:20] week has not one thing to do with the
[1:20:22] fact that right now I'm a Son of God
[1:20:24] right now you're a Son of God why
[1:20:27] because why because not just because he
[1:20:29] purchased you if you're a Son of God now
[1:20:31] you was always the son of God
[1:20:34] you would have had been in his thinking
[1:20:36] in order to be a son now you had to be
[1:20:38] in his thinking then
[1:20:40] so when we catch the reality of
[1:20:42] predestination you can say yeah thank
[1:20:45] God I'm a son thank God I'm a son why
[1:20:48] there's a blood sacrifice that stands in
[1:20:51] your stead don't you think Papa God knew
[1:20:54] what kind of condition you and I were
[1:20:55] going to be in when we got here don't
[1:20:57] you think he understood listen you and I
[1:21:00] might not have known this there was a
[1:21:02] time when the sons of God shouted for
[1:21:03] joy and and we might not have known this
[1:21:06] but listen God knew what sin was going
[1:21:08] to do and he knew what kind of a
[1:21:10] situation you and I were going to be in
[1:21:12] therefore the Bible says the lamb was
[1:21:15] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:21:19] he knew what kind of position he knew
[1:21:21] what kind of battles we were going to
[1:21:23] fight and the blood was slain then why
[1:21:25] so that you and I could completely go
[1:21:28] free
[1:21:29] you could say well brother Dwayne I
[1:21:31] don't feel free tonight that is not one
[1:21:33] thing to do with it the reality is the
[1:21:36] blood was shedded if you have one time
[1:21:38] been born again by the spirit of God
[1:21:40] then you are a free man either the blood
[1:21:43] of Jesus Christ is good for everything
[1:21:45] or it's good for nothing you can't say
[1:21:48] the blood is good for SIN number one and
[1:21:50] sin number two and sin number three and
[1:21:53] when it gets to sin number 10 oh my I
[1:21:55] don't think the blood covers that
[1:21:57] there's only one thing the blood doesn't
[1:21:59] cover and that's blaspheming of the Holy
[1:22:01] Ghost every other thing the blood covers
[1:22:04] and I'm not saying make Grace a disgrace
[1:22:06] tonight by no means I don't believe in
[1:22:08] making Grace disgrace God's given you
[1:22:10] Grace you walk in it but as a Son of God
[1:22:13] as a daughter of God you know you're
[1:22:15] going to fall you're going to make
[1:22:17] mistakes you're going to come up short
[1:22:19] and I'm here to encourage you tonight it
[1:22:21] has not one thing to do with your
[1:22:23] Redemption nothing
[1:22:25] listen if you're going to be judged if
[1:22:27] you are going to be judged as the elect
[1:22:29] lady I'm not talking about foolish
[1:22:31] virgin I'm talking about as the elect
[1:22:34] lady if you are going to be judged on
[1:22:36] your works the grace of God was nothing
[1:22:39] it's irrelevant
[1:22:41] uh if if you're looking somehow to work
[1:22:44] your way into heaven and if you and if
[1:22:46] you think that your good deeds or your
[1:22:48] bad Deeds are going to exclude you from
[1:22:50] Glory the grace of God becomes
[1:22:52] irrelevant
[1:22:53] as foolish virgin your Works will have a
[1:22:56] lot to do with it but as the elect Lady
[1:22:59] it's the grace of God and the blood
[1:23:02] covers it all
[1:23:04] oh my aren't you glad tonight he sees
[1:23:07] nothing all he sees you is is that
[1:23:09] brother Brown said this there's a blood
[1:23:11] covering around the world and God can
[1:23:13] all when he looks down at Red through
[1:23:16] red he sees white he sees white and it
[1:23:19] don't matter how often Satan comes and
[1:23:22] bangs on his door so to speak and begins
[1:23:25] to accuse you but says this he doesn't
[1:23:27] see any of it but he does hear your
[1:23:29] voice
[1:23:30] he does hear your voice
[1:23:32] he hears every time that you get down on
[1:23:35] your knees beside your bed or every time
[1:23:37] you get in your car and you're driving
[1:23:38] off to work and the spirit of God
[1:23:40] becomes and not to convict you he
[1:23:42] doesn't come to condemn you he just
[1:23:44] convicts us hey son that wasn't right
[1:23:46] hey daughter
[1:23:48] that was you you shouldn't have been
[1:23:49] there you shouldn't be in those places
[1:23:52] he only comes to convict us
[1:23:54] because he loves us Hallelujah
[1:23:58] you know what Saint John 14 says this at
[1:24:00] that day you shall know that I am in my
[1:24:02] father ye and me
[1:24:04] and I in you
[1:24:06] at that day you shall know that I am in
[1:24:09] my father and ye in me
[1:24:13] and I in you
[1:24:16] you know what so many times we get I I
[1:24:18] maybe like I said I don't know what
[1:24:21] what's been taught or what hasn't been
[1:24:22] taught but I want to say this you know
[1:24:24] sometimes we we find we get to we get to
[1:24:27] hunker down on the godhead in different
[1:24:29] different types of doctrines and and you
[1:24:32] know I was visiting with the brother and
[1:24:33] you know He was discussing his point of
[1:24:35] view and I was like well you know what I
[1:24:36] don't quite see it that way brother
[1:24:37] Brown says it's different and so we're
[1:24:39] just back and forth a little bit and
[1:24:41] when I walked away it was like you know
[1:24:43] what here we are and and you know we we
[1:24:45] got this the Trinity Doctrine out there
[1:24:48] and and completely tells us to come out
[1:24:50] of the pits of hell
[1:24:52] right the Trinity doctor completely come
[1:24:54] out of the pits of hell I said this I
[1:24:56] said you know listen it doesn't matter
[1:24:58] if it doesn't matter if you believe that
[1:25:02] God himself Was Here and Now Jesus is
[1:25:05] here it doesn't matter as long as you
[1:25:07] don't catch the Revelation that Christ
[1:25:09] is in you
[1:25:11] it don't matter you can believe that all
[1:25:13] of God was in Jesus and Satan knows that
[1:25:16] but for you to accept that all that all
[1:25:19] of Christ has been poured into his bride
[1:25:21] Now That's what Satan doesn't want us to
[1:25:24] know that's what uh yeah we can have it
[1:25:26] here but when it sinks down to here now
[1:25:29] we have a problem because now he
[1:25:30] realizes he has nothing he has no hold
[1:25:33] on you anymore you realize I all at that
[1:25:36] day you will know that I am in the
[1:25:38] Father the father in me I you and me and
[1:25:42] I and you what day is he talking about
[1:25:45] when we get on the other side
[1:25:46] as you talk about when we get to
[1:25:48] Millennium
[1:25:49] this is that day this is that day there
[1:25:52] comes an hour when the sons of God
[1:25:54] actually recognize their position who
[1:25:58] they really are listening Brother Brad
[1:26:00] makes a statement I think in the church
[1:26:01] age book he says when she recognizes
[1:26:03] what she is
[1:26:05] you go look it up he's talking about the
[1:26:07] bride he says when she recognizes what
[1:26:10] she is well what is she
[1:26:13] what is she if she's part of him and he
[1:26:16] was God then what is she
[1:26:18] she's called too
[1:26:20] listen the god that is the god it is not
[1:26:22] one two three or or or a million or
[1:26:25] whatever it is he is one and we are part
[1:26:27] of that Oneness of God
[1:26:29] we're part of the Oneness of God so when
[1:26:33] we get to looking at these things we we
[1:26:34] you know we realize Satan doesn't want
[1:26:37] us to realize Who We Are Tonight

[1:28:32] right but listen if we could step back

[1:29:00] absolutely so so here we are we're in
[1:29:03] this great drama and job finds himself
[1:29:05] in the same position
[1:29:07] and I don't know if you all know what
[1:29:09] it's like to lose everything or awful
[1:29:10] close to it but I'll tell you what God
[1:29:13] knows how to take us listen the Bible
[1:29:15] says job was the greatest man on Earth
[1:29:18] the greatest man on Earth turn over Job
[1:29:20] chapter 30 if you got your Bibles I'm
[1:29:22] just going to take you to a situation
[1:29:23] where here's a man that I'd say this
[1:29:25] like this he loved the Lord he was in
[1:29:27] good standings with everybody around him
[1:29:29] God had blessed his life God had blessed
[1:29:31] his home God had blessed his family God
[1:29:33] had blessed his job he was he was a wise
[1:29:36] man he was respected by everybody I mean
[1:29:39] it's the kind of man that we all want to
[1:29:41] be that we all want to be and yet the
[1:29:44] day comes and God and Satan comes before
[1:29:46] God and he Taps him hey where you been
[1:29:49] oh I've been down there down on Earth
[1:29:51] well have you considered my servant job
[1:29:53] and we know the story literally God
[1:29:55] allowed everything
[1:29:57] we allow God literally some we get such
[1:30:00] crazy ideas in our head when things are
[1:30:02] going good we're saying well oh praise
[1:30:04] the Lord I know I'm a Son of God I know
[1:30:06] God loves me I know God cares about me
[1:30:08] but what about when things go wrong what
[1:30:12] about when things go wrong the love of
[1:30:14] God doesn't change but everything about
[1:30:16] how you feel and everything about your
[1:30:19] emotion and everything that thought that
[1:30:22] the enemy can put in your head it can
[1:30:24] all change the way you feel
[1:30:27] but it'll never change your Eternal
[1:30:29] destination
[1:30:30] now let's just jump into Job chapter 30
[1:30:33] and here's a man that you know they used
[1:30:35] to wash his steps with butter if you go
[1:30:37] and read the rest of the book you'll
[1:30:38] find just how wealthy he really was
[1:30:41] we catch job at a low point in his life
[1:30:44] and he says this but now they are they
[1:30:47] that are younger than I have me in
[1:30:49] derisions whose fathers I would have
[1:30:52] disdained
[1:30:55] people are talking about the bottom of
[1:30:57] the barrel
[1:30:58] They're laughing at him now he says
[1:31:01] whose fathers I would have abstained
[1:31:03] I've set with dogs of my flock yea where
[1:31:05] to might the strength of their hands
[1:31:07] profit me in whom old age was perish was
[1:31:11] perished
[1:31:12] for want and famine they were solitary
[1:31:16] fleeing Into the Wilderness in former
[1:31:18] time desolate in waste who cut up
[1:31:21] Mallows by the bushes and Juniper roots
[1:31:23] for their meat they were driven forth
[1:31:25] from among men listen these people are
[1:31:28] this is like this can I is this the
[1:31:31] wrong word to use scum

[1:31:35] lowest end of the Earth
[1:31:37] these people are the bottom of the
[1:31:39] barrel as far as the as far as their
[1:31:41] reputations are concerned and job was
[1:31:43] saying and now these people in my
[1:31:46] position these people laugh at me now
[1:31:48] that I've lost everything these people
[1:31:50] are laughing he says he says they they
[1:31:52] were driven forth among verse five they
[1:31:54] cried after them as a thief to dwell in
[1:31:57] this in the Cliffs of the valleys and
[1:31:58] caves of the earth and in the Rocks
[1:32:00] among the bushes they braid under the
[1:32:03] Nettles they were gathered together they
[1:32:06] were children of fools yea children of

[1:32:21] made job as nothing they talk about job
[1:32:24] like dirt and God spoke about job as the
[1:32:27] greatest man on the face of the Earth
[1:32:30] you see the two differences listen and
[1:32:33] and job is literally he's he's seeing
[1:32:35] what they're seeing God is already in in
[1:32:39] all of his derision in all of his and
[1:32:41] all of his losses and all of his and all
[1:32:43] of the hurt that job has been remember
[1:32:45] job job was saying oh man it's better if
[1:32:47] I wasn't even born he got to the place
[1:32:49] where his life wasn't worth living

[1:38:09] would have been a happy man but I would
[1:38:11] not have gone and preached the gospel I
[1:38:12] would have stayed right where I was so
[1:38:15] he literally had to take it all from me
[1:38:17] what to get my attention now I don't
[1:38:19] believe he needed to get job's attention
[1:38:21] he was just testing job but I know what

[1:38:25] my children taken from me I understand
[1:38:28] that not in the way job did but I
[1:38:31] understand this and Mom and Daddy it's
[1:38:33] not one thing you did if you've raised
[1:38:35] him as much as you knew how if you've
[1:38:37] raised them as good as you knew they
[1:38:39] still it'll take the the almighty power
[1:38:41] of God to save their souls you as a
[1:38:44] daddy will never save your children's
[1:38:46] Soul you as a mommy will never save it
[1:38:49] will take the grace of almighty God and

[1:38:53] line that they can see it Hallelujah but
[1:38:56] I understand it and job sometimes you
[1:38:59] know sometimes you can just get so down
[1:39:01] in a pit in your own life that now
[1:39:04] everything you see above you is just
[1:39:06] darkness and gloomy and black and

[1:51:29] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:51:31] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[1:51:34] as he has chosen us
[1:51:37] as he has chosen us
[1:51:41] in him

[1:52:02] Satan drags your past out and tries to
[1:52:05] haunt you with your past it is
[1:52:07] irrelevant the blood has already been
[1:52:09] shed he already ordained it that you and
[1:52:11] I could sit here tonight and be holy
[1:52:14] as he is Holy be perfect even as I am
[1:52:19] perfect he said Lord why would you ask
[1:52:20] me to be perfect look at my life I'm not
[1:52:23] yes you're perfect you're not perfect in
[1:52:25] your flesh you're perfect through the
[1:52:27] blood Hallelujah be recording as he has
[1:52:31] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:52:33] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:52:36] Without Blame before him in love
[1:52:39] having predestinated us unto the
[1:52:42] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:52:45] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:52:47] of his will
[1:52:48] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:52:50] wherein he hath made us accepted in
[1:52:54] the Beloved
[1:52:55] Hallelujah
[1:52:57] what an hour to live and listen brother
[1:52:59] Brown would say this he'd say speaking
[1:53:01] of I'm speaking of election
[1:53:03] predestination brother Brown would say
[1:53:04] this he said see how this works God is
[1:53:07] all has God always had his thoughts for
[1:53:10] Adam Adam has his thought Adam as his as
[1:53:13] his thoughts was yet unexpressed
[1:53:17] and Psalms 139 speaks of it I'll give
[1:53:19] you a little idea of this of this my
[1:53:21] substance was not hid from thee when I
[1:53:23] was made in the secret and curiously
[1:53:25] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:53:27] that eyes did see my substance yet being
[1:53:29] unperfect and the book uh and in thy
[1:53:32] book were all members written which in
[1:53:35] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[1:53:38] was none of them
[1:53:40] that as I've said I was not written
[1:53:42] about Adam I was not written about Adam
[1:53:45] but it gives you an idea the knowledge
[1:53:47] that the thought was there in his mind
[1:53:49] and that thought was eternal and had to
[1:53:52] be expressed so when Adam was formed of
[1:53:54] the Dust of the earth and his spiritual
[1:53:56] being created by God then Adam listen
[1:54:00] close church then Adam became God's
[1:54:03] thoughts expressed
[1:54:06] then Adam became God's thoughts
[1:54:08] expressed and those Eternal thoughts
[1:54:11] were now manifested down through the
[1:54:14] centuries we could go we find a Moses a
[1:54:17] Jeremiah a John the Baptist and each one
[1:54:20] of these were God's Eternal thought
[1:54:23] expressed in its season God's Eternal
[1:54:27] thought expressed and when we come to
[1:54:29] Jesus the logos he was a perfect and
[1:54:31] complete thought expressed and he became
[1:54:33] known as what we know as the word that
[1:54:36] is what he is and forever will be now in

[2:00:29] window so you got one place to look and
[2:00:31] that's look up listen God don't get in
[2:00:34] one nor seeing what was going on because
[2:00:36] it was death it was destruction it was
[2:00:38] bodies floating and it was everywhere as
[2:00:41] you looked it was people screaming and
[2:00:43] crying and they were drowning and they
[2:00:45] couldn't walk they couldn't climb high

[2:01:03] imagine this here's Noah this Gallant
[2:01:05] prophet of God that was so obedient to
[2:01:07] God and you know sometimes I I preach
[2:01:10] this at home sometimes you know we get
[2:01:12] this little picture of Noah we we we're
[2:01:14] so prone to to artists Renditions and
[2:01:16] stuff you know here that the Bible talks
[2:01:18] the flood is descended the Waters of it
[2:01:20] you know they've abated and of course
[2:01:22] the ark rests down on Mark on on air at
[2:01:25] Mount Ararat or whatever it is
[2:01:28] here's Noah
[2:01:31] puts the Gangplank down now what's the
[2:01:33] artist's rendition
[2:01:35] there's the beautiful rainbow oh my
[2:01:39] God's covenant promise
[2:01:42] and here's the Lush beautiful new Earth
[2:01:44] the green grass

[2:01:55] arcs ramp is down there stands Noah
[2:01:58] looking out over come on Church
[2:02:01] God had literally destroyed every living
[2:02:04] creature on the face of the Earth
[2:02:07] you think Noah was looking at a
[2:02:08] beautiful big you know a green plateau
[2:02:11] and and it was just the birds are
[2:02:13] chirping and singing it come on
[2:02:17] it's reality check
[2:02:19] dead bodies everywhere
[2:02:22] dead bodies ever you think I I used to
[2:02:24] own a meat shop so I have a little idea
[2:02:26] what dead animals smell like
[2:02:29] they stink till they make you throw up
[2:02:31] they may you want to vomit it gets so
[2:02:33] bad
[2:02:35] it's just man of God
[2:02:38] who has stood faithful God has carried
[2:02:41] them over there he is gets out he's
[2:02:43] heard the screams and the cries of his
[2:02:45] friends his family
[2:02:47] has the Boat Lifts off you think he's
[2:02:49] not a man like us you think that
[2:02:51] wouldn't torment them you think it
[2:02:53] wouldn't have bothered him that was his
[2:02:55] family his friend his community
[2:02:58] there he is gets over and the Gangplank
[2:03:00] lays down dead animals dead people dead
[2:03:03] oh my word
[2:03:06] and then we read the story about Noah
[2:03:10] there he is in his tent
[2:03:14] brother Brown would say this and Noah
[2:03:16] died a drunk
[2:03:19] and Noah
[2:03:21] died a drunk
[2:03:24] are you kidding me
[2:03:29] how does that work brother Dwayne
[2:03:31] this man of God
[2:03:33] this man of God who for 120 years stood
[2:03:37] faithful
[2:03:38] never wavered
[2:03:40] there he stood faithful God literally
[2:03:42] kept his promise to him gets on the
[2:03:44] other side and he dies a drunk
[2:03:48] let me tell you something Church Noah
[2:03:51] was no less a Son of God as he laid
[2:03:54] there in the tent that night maybe
[2:03:55] trying to drown his Sorrows maybe trying
[2:03:57] to call me I don't know for what reason
[2:03:59] but he was no less a Son of God than
[2:04:02] when he stood at the door of that Ark
[2:04:04] and said repent because God's going to
[2:04:06] bring a judgment on this Earth you're
[2:04:08] not a son of God today and not a son of
[2:04:10] God tomorrow if you are a son of God you
[2:04:13] are always a Son of God God will not
[2:04:15] listen God's not going to impute
[2:04:17] iniquity unto Noah why but blood is made
[2:04:20] a covering for him God knew he was
[2:04:22] always a son of God
[2:04:23] you cannot be a Son of God if you're if
[2:04:26] God's called you if God is if God has
[2:04:28] put the seed of God in your heart you
[2:04:30] are always a Son of God we look at it
[2:04:33] you look at Rahab the Harlot come on
[2:04:34] Church you look at Rahab the Harlan and
[2:04:37] they're the life that she was living and
[2:04:39] how awful that day after day and all the
[2:04:42] regrets and all the oh all the horrors
[2:04:45] she had to live with it she would have
[2:04:46] to hold her head down and she couldn't
[2:04:48] even walk and look at people she
[2:04:50] couldn't be in people's presence hardly
[2:04:52] you think that you think she was any
[2:04:54] less a daughter of God living in that
[2:04:56] condition than she was the day that that
[2:04:59] that that Joshua and his men came in and
[2:05:01] they rescued her
[2:05:03] God's Own word has her lineage her name
[2:05:05] written right in his word and here she
[2:05:08] was a
[2:05:09] come on a street prostitute
[2:05:12] a street prostitute
[2:05:14] trying to make a living trying to hold
[2:05:16] her whatever she had together it
[2:05:18] rejected by her own family and yet Gods
[2:05:21] would look from on high and say I see a
[2:05:24] seed in that little woman I place the
[2:05:25] seed down in the muck and it's going to
[2:05:27] come out the sound the words going to
[2:05:30] get through it all we've heard about you
[2:05:31] we've heard about the great Army of
[2:05:33] Israel and this God that always he's
[2:05:35] always there fighting their battles and
[2:05:37] there's fear over a whole land but
[2:05:39] listen I believe that message I believe
[2:05:41] what he told me
[2:05:43] God knew where she was all the time
[2:05:45] would make her a queen would make her a
[2:05:48] princess if I could say it that way
[2:05:49] Solomon's daughter Solomon would Solomon
[2:05:52] would take her as a as a wife and there
[2:05:54] they would establish and she would find
[2:05:56] her own name in The Very lineage of
[2:05:59] Jesus Christ
[2:06:00] come on you you can look at your own
[2:06:03] life tonight you can look at him you

[2:06:11] a there was a bloodstream that she would
[2:06:13] hang down a little red scared according
[2:06:15] she would hang out of her window why she
[2:06:18] would Proclaim there's something between
[2:06:19] my sin and the Judgment of God and
[2:06:22] that's this bloodstream she could hold
[2:06:24] it there until she took on the very name
[2:06:27] of Solomon listen Church you're not your
[2:06:30] own tonight you didn't come here in the
[2:06:32] name of a church I don't care if it's

[2:06:49] Living God

[2:06:53] shortcomings
[2:06:55] right now we are the sons of God we're
[2:06:57] not going to be we are right now
[2:07:00] oh you say brother Dwayne I know all
[2:07:02] about those all about those wonderful

[2:07:06] what you say well yeah but look at my
[2:07:08] life okay come on
[2:07:10] let's just let's just bring it home
[2:07:11] let's just bring it home where we live
[2:07:13] here we are preaching out of a message
[2:07:15] of a Vindicated prophet
[2:07:18] one that you and I would die we would
[2:07:20] die for this message you and I would
[2:07:22] hold the banner of it and say I believe
[2:07:24] God sent a prophet William Branham is
[2:07:26] his name not one of us is ashamed to
[2:07:29] make the proclamation we believe God
[2:07:31] sent a prophet and we would look at that
[2:07:33] man and you would look at his life and
[2:07:35] see a supernatural God how God would
[2:07:37] raise up the dead how God would call a
[2:07:39] little fish back to life how God would
[2:07:41] speak to a storm and we would uh you
[2:07:44] know third poem Ministry we would look
[2:07:45] at this man and we would so admire the
[2:07:48] life and how day after day night after
[2:07:50] night he would discern the thoughts that
[2:07:51] was in his heart discern this life tell
[2:07:53] her where she came from and what she'd
[2:07:55] done wrong tell them where he's living
[2:07:56] and what he needs to do and the we'd see
[2:07:59] the Holy Spirit use him in such a great
[2:08:00] way
[2:08:03] but well it's hard that's the Son of God
[2:08:06] that's a that we know that's a Son of
[2:08:09] God that's like the first not the first
[2:08:11] fruit but that's the wave sheep that
[2:08:12] that that's been waived over the
[2:08:14] congregation hey that's what all mature
[2:08:16] sons of God should look like
[2:08:18] we look at it we say oh I know that's
[2:08:21] the Son of God that's a manifested Son
[2:08:23] of God but look at my life
[2:08:26] Lord what am I
[2:08:29] but you just need to
[2:08:31] rewind the movie screen just a little
[2:08:33] bit and take his life as a boy
[2:08:37] born to a drunk
[2:08:40] a man who would murder
[2:08:43] take a little boy whose temper he gets
[2:08:45] so angry
[2:08:46] because somebody ran over his dog that
[2:08:48] he literally wanted to kill him
[2:08:51] a man who would get who's whose wife
[2:08:54] would be taken from him as children he
[2:08:56] gets so depressed he'd crawl up on the
[2:08:58] power pole and say God forgive me for
[2:09:00] this
[2:09:01] reach out his hand to take his own life
[2:09:04] so discouraged so discouraged
[2:09:09] the man would come by and said Billy
[2:09:12] what do you think of your God now
[2:09:14] that's your wife and your baby are gone
[2:09:19] he'd have to say
[2:09:21] it's not me keeping myself it's him
[2:09:23] keeping me
[2:09:27] talk about a young boy that would stand
[2:09:28] there
[2:09:29] after he got beat up stand in the face
[2:09:32] of a half a dozen young boys with his 22
[2:09:34] rifle and say which one wants to die
[2:09:36] first I'm going to pull the trigger and
[2:09:39] literally pull the trigger
[2:09:47] not one shell goes off
[2:09:52] was he still a Son of God then
[2:09:55] come on
[2:09:57] he was always a son of God
[2:10:00] and it don't matter how low you get it
[2:10:02] don't matter where you have been it
[2:10:04] don't matter what you've considered it
[2:10:06] don't matter where Satan is dragging you
[2:10:08] to right now you're a Son of God you're
[2:10:11] not going to be sis you're not going to
[2:10:13] be a daughter you are right now A
[2:10:15] Daughter of God
[2:10:17] Hallelujah
[2:10:18] was so prone to look at our our natural
[2:10:21] being we're so prone to get caught and
[2:10:24] Satan has the access to this he has
[2:10:25] access to our mind so he can come when
[2:10:28] he just begin to the Warfare that goes
[2:10:30] on and not one of us is immune from it
[2:10:31] we all fight with it we all battle with
[2:10:33] it listen if a prophet of God battled
[2:10:35] with it how much more you and I
[2:10:38] he wanted to take his own life
[2:10:40] he wanted to take his own life
[2:10:46] it might not look like a Son of God but
[2:10:48] it was Son of God just the same now
[2:10:51] are we the sons of God
[2:10:53] Hallelujah
[2:10:55] it's okay
[2:11:01] what about Abraham
[2:11:05] this mighty man that God called a friend
[2:11:08] father of the faith
[2:11:12] well that's definitely a Son of God
[2:11:14] because God God come down right down and
[2:11:16] talked to him like Hebrew that's
[2:11:18] definitely a Son of God well it's easy
[2:11:20] to look in the book isn't it
[2:11:22] it's easy to go back and look in the Old
[2:11:23] Testament and say oh yeah that was the
[2:11:24] son of God yep that was a son that was a
[2:11:26] daughter of God yep that was a Son of
[2:11:28] God yep that was a daughter of God
[2:11:30] and a prophet would come to you and tell
[2:11:32] you this Old Testament was written
[2:11:34] for your admonition and for my
[2:11:36] admonition
[2:11:38] you know something about the Old
[2:11:40] Testament

[2:11:45] you can see all their faults
[2:11:48] the great women you could see all their
[2:11:49] mistakes
[2:11:51] but just run over to Hebrews chapter 11
[2:11:53] once
[2:11:56] and not one of them is shown by faith
[2:12:01] why the blood was shed God seen none of
[2:12:03] it
[2:12:04] as long as the bulls and goats it could
[2:12:06] be written but once the blood was shed
[2:12:09] it couldn't even be written

[2:15:16] the mythical platform the eternities and
[2:15:18] rolled the worlds off his hands created
[2:15:19] these things give you a privilege to be
[2:15:22] his son and you are part of him and God

[2:15:29] deity
[2:15:31] Hallelujah

[2:15:48] said I just don't see it brother doing
[2:15:49] them take it by take it by faith because
[2:15:51] he said so take it by faith because he
[2:15:54] said so deity dwells in the man God has
[2:15:57] become a many membered body

[2:17:44] mystery of Christ revealed

[2:18:21] the age we're living in he said that she
[2:18:23] would become she would become so much
[2:18:25] like him
[2:18:26] she would be in his very image why the
[2:18:29] two shall become one
[2:18:31] the two shall become one
[2:18:34] says this he says you know what the
[2:18:36] problem is
[2:18:38] he says if you only know he says that's
[2:18:40] what the matter of the church is tonight

[2:18:55] in here in the next five minutes he said
[2:18:57] the thing of it is you're looking off
[2:18:58] into a millennium for something to
[2:19:00] happen when it's all ready here

[2:19:15] together in Heavenly places in Christ oh
[2:19:17] if you would only recognize that listen
[2:19:19] close the supreme authority
[2:19:23] that Jesus Christ has given to every
[2:19:27] believer

[2:19:34] Grandma are you listening tonight
[2:19:38] well just to the preach just to the
[2:19:40] prophet
[2:19:42] well that's what we said
[2:19:45] well then just to the ministry
[2:19:47] that's not what he said
[2:19:50] every
[2:19:51] believer
[2:19:53] every
[2:19:54] believer
[2:19:57] that means you Mama
[2:19:59] that means you Grandma
[2:20:01] every I can say that because I'm a
[2:20:03] grandpa now every believer
[2:20:06] every believer
[2:20:09] that means you sonny
[2:20:11] you're 10 you're 12 years old that means
[2:20:13] you
[2:20:15] the supreme authority
[2:20:17] is given to every believer
[2:20:19] whatsoever things you desire When you
[2:20:22] pray believe you receive it it'll be
[2:20:24] given unto you
[2:20:25] Mark 11 24 says whatsoever things you
[2:20:29] desire receive it
[2:20:33] why do we get so caught
[2:20:34] I'm speaking I'm speaking from myself
[2:20:36] tonight too I'm just like we're just all
[2:20:39] the same
[2:20:39] we're all the same we're all doing one
[2:20:41] thing fighting the good fight of Faith
[2:20:44] contending for the faith
[2:20:47] but lots of times we find ourselves like
[2:20:49] Gideon there we are you know
[2:20:52] we hear it
[2:20:54] we've been told over and over and over
[2:20:56] Gideon knew he was in Israel Gideon knew
[2:20:58] he was no he knew that he had a position
[2:21:03] he knew he would come from good genetics
[2:21:04] he could trace himself all the way back
[2:21:07] and say I know I'm in the line of God I
[2:21:08] know I'm a son of God
[2:21:10] I've been told my my pastors told me
[2:21:12] this for 30 years I'm a son of God
[2:21:15] and then something goes wrong
[2:21:18] pretty soon the amalekites move in or
[2:21:20] the midianites move in or whoever it is
[2:21:22] moves in and there you know uh you know
[2:21:24] all of a sudden the economy begins to
[2:21:26] change and things aren't happening and
[2:21:28] and now your very testimony is getting
[2:21:30] put on you know it's on the it's on the
[2:21:32] chopping block
[2:21:34] and pretty soon instead of standing bold
[2:21:36] you're you're you're all bowed down and
[2:21:39] and you're busy you know making your
[2:21:41] bread where nobody can see you or
[2:21:42] keeping your testimony to yourself
[2:21:44] because I I just don't I don't think
[2:21:46] anybody really I don't it's probably not
[2:21:48] that important anyhow and listen the
[2:21:50] Bible says they overcame by the blood of
[2:21:52] the lamb and the word of their brother
[2:21:54] Dale their testimony they overcame by
[2:21:57] the blood of lamb and the word of their
[2:21:59] testimony young ladies your testimony
[2:22:01] not Mama's testimony not daddy's
[2:22:04] testimony not brother luscious testimony
[2:22:06] your testimony they overcame by the
[2:22:08] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[2:22:10] testimony
[2:22:11] there's there's you know Gideon there's
[2:22:13] hiding away he's doing what so many of
[2:22:16] us who so many of us do we get down and
[2:22:18] we get discouraged and instead of
[2:22:19] speaking the things of God instead of
[2:22:21] speaking the word of God speaking life
[2:22:23] we begin to speak
[2:22:26] all the wrong things
[2:22:28] uh
[2:22:30] forgive me for this but I used to have
[2:22:31] when I owned a meat shop a little little
[2:22:33] sister walked in one time she'd come to
[2:22:34] visit every occasion pick up stuff and
[2:22:36] every time I would ask her
[2:22:39] hey sis how you doing oh brother Dwayne
[2:22:42] just terrible oh I got this wrong with
[2:22:44] me I got that wrong with me every time
[2:22:46] she'd come in it was something different
[2:22:47] and would you pray for me I'd pray for
[2:22:50] her and I one day she walked in the shop
[2:22:51] and it was something different again she
[2:22:53] asked me will you pray for me I said no
[2:22:57] and she's like well why not
[2:22:59] come on Gideon
[2:23:01] come on Gideon why not
[2:23:04] because your confession you will never
[2:23:07] be healed
[2:23:09] because I've got tuberculosis well I got
[2:23:12] diabetes I got cancer I've got I've got
[2:23:15] I've got as long as you're come you're
[2:23:17] com you're claiming you're claiming or
[2:23:20] complaining about it guess what you own
[2:23:23] it
[2:23:23] you own it but when you begin to Speak
[2:23:27] Life
[2:23:28] hey I might this is what the doctor's
[2:23:30] saying God but by his stripes I'm Healed
[2:23:32] I'm not denying that what the doctors
[2:23:34] are telling me is true but I've got a
[2:23:36] God that heals all my diseases I go to
[2:23:38] God That Forgives all my iniquities I'm
[2:23:41] more than an overcomer in this life
[2:23:42] listen it's not gonna I'm gonna rise up
[2:23:45] above this and Gideon had to have
[2:23:48] somebody to remind him one day listen
[2:23:51] you don't belong now get what you're
[2:23:53] doing with your testimony why are you
[2:23:55] always testifying negative why are you
[2:23:57] always down why you know I'll tell you
[2:23:59] why I'll tell you why brothers and
[2:24:01] sisters I got in the truck one day and I
[2:24:03] got in this this pickup truck and a man
[2:24:04] I love dearly and I respect him to the
[2:24:07] uttermost jumped an instructor ride with
[2:24:09] him and I'm hanging out with him for the
[2:24:10] day and he stops to jump out of his
[2:24:12] truck to go get something in the store
[2:24:13] and I just I don't know why I did it but
[2:24:16] I did
[2:24:17] he jumped out and left the truck so I
[2:24:19] just reached over and pushed his radio
[2:24:20] button I want to know what he's
[2:24:21] listening to
[2:24:23] you know what he's listening to
[2:24:25] he is forever negative I've always got
[2:24:28] to be trying to encourage him and trying
[2:24:30] to encourage him and trying to encourage
[2:24:31] him and trying to I'm like man
[2:24:34] you know what he's listening to talk
[2:24:36] radio
[2:24:38] the prophets of Doom
[2:24:41] the prophets of Gloom because everything
[2:24:44] about talk radio is negative negative
[2:24:47] negative negative negative negative
[2:24:48] negative negative negative and negative
[2:24:50] it's never positive and as you're going
[2:24:53] to feed on that you're going to what you
[2:24:55] eat is what you become I'll tell you
[2:24:57] what all you need to do is get you need
[2:24:59] to shut your radio off and go ahead and

[2:25:33] Sunday morning and if I could make it
[2:25:34] Wednesday I show up
[2:25:38] and I don't know why I have all these
[2:25:39] problems in my life I just can't seem to
[2:25:41] get over it get over it
[2:25:45] sons of God
[2:25:48] guarantee you
[2:25:51] if this country would have known
[2:25:54] if I could if I could jump back 70 or 80
[2:25:56] years and prophet of God would have been
[2:25:58] invited to this country you couldn't
[2:26:00] have got in this place early enough I
[2:26:02] heard him say on a message the other day
[2:26:03] they were there at three in the morning
[2:26:05] waiting for just the door to open just
[2:26:08] so they could get in
[2:26:10] and how do we do well I don't know what
[2:26:12] you hear but I know how they do at home
[2:26:14] and you could live next door to the
[2:26:15] church and they don't show up until just
[2:26:17] about five minutes before church
[2:26:21] we came expecting I can tell
[2:26:24] did you pay for that seat
[2:26:29] you know maybe we ought to
[2:26:31] you know back in I think it was Wesley's
[2:26:32] day or one of those days you know that
[2:26:34] that the rich used to pay to sit on the
[2:26:36] front seats
[2:26:38] I think we need to start charging again
[2:26:42] because now it's almost like they pay to
[2:26:43] sit the back seats
[2:26:46] that's being a little silly but
[2:26:48] we're sons of God

[2:27:18] what does Justified mean as though
[2:27:21] you've never done it in the first place
[2:27:25] it didn't happen

[2:30:36] that God won't keep his word but he's
[2:30:38] not a man that he should lie
[2:30:40] God is God and he will keep his word
[2:30:43] listen we are not called here to be

[2:31:15] high calling such a high calling that
[2:31:17] your children can look and say I you
[2:31:19] know what I know my dad is a Christian I
[2:31:22] know my grandpa's a Christian I know

[2:31:29] ashamed to Fall on Your Knees and take
[2:31:31] your children to prayer they ought to
[2:31:33] know that's how it works they ought to
[2:31:35] know that Daddy holds a sword in his
[2:31:36] hand he wields a sword and when he
[2:31:38] begins to pray that God begins to answer
[2:31:41] mama I always say it I'm going to
[2:31:43] encourage you the same Grandma you take
[2:31:45] those little children pull them around
[2:31:46] you you can still love them and you
[2:31:48] begin to take those advantages
[2:31:50] to talk to them about the things of the
[2:31:52] Lord every little opportunity you get
[2:31:53] and take them around and begin to pray
[2:31:55] and they'll say I know my grandma she
[2:31:57] talks to God and I know God hears her
[2:31:59] prayer why because right now right now
[2:32:02] we're sons of God we're not waiting to
[2:32:04] be we are now the sons of God God said
[2:32:07] just come speak come bring your burdens
[2:32:09] to me and I'll carry him for you why
[2:32:11] because he's a loving father just like
[2:32:13] you daddies do
[2:32:14] you carry your burdens for your children
[2:32:16] so does our heavenly father
[2:32:18] do you love him tonight
[2:32:20] I might as well just close right now
[2:32:22] I might as well just close right now if
[2:32:24] the if the musicians would take the the
[2:32:26] the instruments
[2:32:28] we've been called to a high calling
[2:32:30] Church
[2:32:31] we've been we've been called to a high
[2:32:33] calling
[2:32:34] we might have been you know Gideon might
[2:32:36] have he he might have got to the place
[2:32:37] where you know in all of his in all of
[2:32:39] his anger all of his anxieties and all
[2:32:42] of his fears he might he might have got
[2:32:43] cowered down and I say this sometimes
[2:32:46] Maybe
[2:32:48] maybe we've had things go so wrong in
[2:32:49] our lives too
[2:32:51] and it feels like God just doesn't speak
[2:32:54] anymore
[2:32:56] feels like I pray and there's a block
[2:32:58] and I pray and there's another block and
[2:32:59] I pray and there's another block and I
[2:33:01] can't just can't seem to break through
[2:33:03] and Lord what's the matter with me and
[2:33:05] don't you let that
[2:33:06] devil make you afraid
[2:33:09] remember Daniel
[2:33:12] remember Daniel
[2:33:13] I don't know why I'm here tonight but I
[2:33:15] am
[2:33:15] you remember Daniel
[2:33:18] he prayed earnestly
[2:33:20] and for 21 days he never got a reply
[2:33:25] 21 days he never got a reply but when
[2:33:27] the angel replied
[2:33:29] he said I heard your sis just whatever
[2:33:30] you have on your heart something soft he
[2:33:32] said as he says I heard you the first
[2:33:35] time
[2:33:36] I heard you the first time as soon as
[2:33:37] you prayed I heard
[2:33:40] and so did God hear your prayer the
[2:33:42] moment you prayed
[2:33:45] God heard your prayer the moment you
[2:33:46] prayed
[2:33:48] but we're not just fighting with the
[2:33:49] Demons of Daniel's day
[2:33:51] Daniel fought with the Demons of his day
[2:33:54] but this day
[2:33:56] the lid has been pulled off of hell
[2:34:00] and there's billions
[2:34:02] of demons out there
[2:34:05] I'll tell you what
[2:34:06] and almighty God will bankrupt heaven to
[2:34:10] keep his promise to you
[2:34:11] why
[2:34:12] because you're a son
[2:34:14] because I'm a son
[2:34:16] because you're Daughters of God not one
[2:34:19] time
[2:34:19] not one time I'll say it this way in
[2:34:21] closing when Adam fell in the garden
[2:34:25] nowheres do we read that Adam called
[2:34:28] though for God
[2:34:30] but we hear a prophet of God say this
[2:34:31] that when Adam fell that God literally
[2:34:36] instead of sending an angel
[2:34:40] so he had Mighty Man you talk about
[2:34:41] super beings you talk about incredible
[2:34:44] uh supernatural beings and here's a
[2:34:47] here's here's a son in the garden has
[2:34:48] fallen and God could have just said that
[2:34:50] he said any one wormwood go down and go
[2:34:53] on go to go down and rescue my son
[2:34:55] I'd say wormwood probably wanted to go
[2:34:57] rescue his son but you know God said no
[2:34:59] no this is my son
[2:35:02] I'll go take care of him
[2:35:03] I'll go take care of them
[2:35:06] and God came himself
[2:35:08] for his son
[2:35:10] God will come himself
[2:35:12] for his children tonight God will come
[2:35:15] himself for his children tonight
[2:35:19] get in
[2:35:22] what's your need tonight
[2:35:25] what's your prayer
[2:35:28] you think that the Holy Spirit isn't
[2:35:30] here right now he's here
[2:35:32] he's here
[2:35:34] the lid might have been pulled off hell
[2:35:36] but that wouldn't stop God
[2:35:38] from reaching out to you realize that
[2:35:41] ladies
[2:35:42] wherever you're at in your life
[2:35:45] God knows exactly where you are and he
[2:35:47] cares
[2:35:49] would literally bankrupt heaven
[2:35:52] savior
[2:35:54] to make sure that when this world is
[2:35:55] over that you've got joy unspeakable and
[2:35:59] full of Glory

[2:36:18] and it's the grandchildren

[2:36:30] I'm sorry I'm not up there I
[2:36:35] I'm just getting comfortable when I'm
[2:36:36] not far away from people I
[2:36:41] mean you say when you love God's
[2:36:43] children when you love
[2:36:46] my children

[2:36:51] needs you believe that tonight

[2:37:03] something that somebody that we can do
