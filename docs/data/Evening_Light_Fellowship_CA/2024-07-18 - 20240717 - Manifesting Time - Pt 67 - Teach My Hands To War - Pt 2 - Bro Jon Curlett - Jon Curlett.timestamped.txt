[34:25] my near Kinsman
[34:28] that I need something from you and Lord

[34:32] evening Heavenly Father Lord because she
[34:34] has a need Lord she has a need to be
[34:36] clothed and wrapped in your
[34:38] righteousness Lord that your love would
[34:40] so surround and fill her heavenly father
[34:42] that it would drive out every fear every
[34:44] doubt every bit of unrest Heavenly
[34:47] Father Lord that Faith would rise up
[34:49] within us Lord to lay hold of your word
[34:50] this evening so Lord I pray that we
[34:53] would lay at your feet Lord that we
[34:55] would draw ever closer to you this
[34:57] evening Lord and as we even go out this
[34:59] night Lord may we draw closer to you day
[35:01] by day Lord that we would find the peace
[35:03] and rest Lord that love that Lord that
[35:06] that gives us Lord the overcoming power
[35:08] in every battle that we Face Lord we ask

[35:18] Lord thank you for leadership Lord thank
[35:20] you because the answer is on the way
[35:22] Lord thank you for our finished work in
[35:25] Calvary Lord we just pray our lives
[35:27] would ref Ed this evening each one Lord
[35:30] we ask you to bless your word now in
[35:31] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[35:35] you turn if you would to Psalms chapter
[35:37] 18 Psalms chapter 18 it's good to be in
[35:39] the house of the Lord again this
[35:41] evening amen just trust him we've come
[35:44] in expecting amen amen I know brother
[35:47] Chad's out in Central and just praying
[35:49] God to give them traveling mercies they
[35:51] should be back on tues or on uh on
[35:54] Sunday and then brother Jim and the
[35:56] doues and the briners are back in Sweet
[35:58] Bay but hopefully we'll see them also on
[36:00] Sunday so God's grace to them each one
[36:04] amen Psalms chapter 18 I want to read
[36:06] this Psalm but I want you to focus on
[36:08] what's Happening here because I want you
[36:10] to see where the starting point is and
[36:12] where the finishing point is and and who
[36:14] starts it and who finishes it and who's
[36:16] fighting and who's winning and who's
[36:18] doing a work and who's getting a work
[36:20] because so often we want to put the the
[36:22] pressure on ourselves we want to put the
[36:23] focus on ourselves but you'll see that's
[36:25] not the way the scripture works amen it
[36:28] puts the it it puts the Focus right
[36:30] where it needs to be amen and it shows
[36:32] us who's the Difference Maker so let's
[36:33] read Psalms 18 and: 31 it says for who
[36:36] is God save the Lord and who is a rock
[36:39] Save Our God it is God that GTH me with
[36:43] strength and maketh my way perfect he
[36:46] maketh my feet like hindes feet and sth
[36:49] me upon my high places he teacheth My
[36:52] Hands to War so that a bow of Steel is
[36:55] broken in my arms he's the one that
[36:57] gives us the strength he's the one that
[36:59] that makes us able to even fight in the
[37:01] first place amen he's the one that turns
[37:03] us into Warriors of the faith it's his
[37:05] working that makes us who we are David
[37:07] continues he says Thou Hast also given
[37:09] me the shield of thy salvation and thy
[37:12] right hand hath Holden me up and thy
[37:14] gentleness ha made me
[37:17] great he says Thou Hast enlarged my
[37:20] steps under me that my feet do not slip
[37:23] it's his free gift of Salvation it's his
[37:25] right hand it's his gentleness his
[37:27] patient love loving care that keeps us
[37:29] from falling down amen it the results
[37:31] are because of his work not because of
[37:34] ours but watch watch the results of all
[37:36] of this now we've heard it is God and he
[37:39] and he and thou and thy now watch what
[37:41] happens in verse 37 now David says I
[37:44] have pursued mine enemies and overtaken
[37:47] them neither did I turn again till they
[37:49] were consumed that's our job don't stop
[37:53] don't stop till it's over he says I have
[37:55] wounded them that they were not able ble
[37:57] to rise they are Fallen under my feet
[38:01] total Victory total deliverance and me
[38:04] David's won the war and David says I did
[38:06] it and it seems like maybe we've had a
[38:08] part in it but then David comes right
[38:10] back around in verse 39 he says for thou
[38:13] Hast girded Me with strength under the
[38:14] battle thou Hast subdued under me those
[38:17] that rose up against me thou also Hast
[38:20] given me the necks of mine enemies that
[38:21] I might destroy them that hate me and
[38:24] read even verse 41 and 42 it says they
[38:27] cried
[38:28] but there was none to save them even
[38:29] unto the Lord but he answered them not
[38:32] then did I beat them small as the dust
[38:35] before the wind I did cast them out as
[38:38] the dirt in the streets amen God bless
[38:41] you you can have your seats this evening
[38:42] what an encouraging scripture to start
[38:44] our our service this evening and we're
[38:46] going to take another service on on
[38:48] manifesting time and I want to take
[38:50] another service on this subtitle of
[38:52] teach My Hands to War and the more I
[38:54] study the more the notes keep piling up
[38:56] so we've got at least two more services
[38:58] after this but certainly there's a very
[39:00] special message coming on Sunday I
[39:02] believe that the Lord's just been
[39:03] dealing with me on for quite some time
[39:05] so keep that in prayer but I want us to
[39:08] go back and just by by way of quick
[39:10] review this this evening we talked last
[39:12] service about Canaan was a type of the
[39:13] Holy Ghost and that our battle is to
[39:15] come into the Holy Ghost and then we saw
[39:17] it was a battle to get there and it was
[39:19] a battle to cross over then it was a
[39:21] battle to overcome and then it was a
[39:23] battle to hold on to the land amen it
[39:25] was a battle from start to finish now we
[39:27] know it was a type and Shadow so it's
[39:29] not perfect because we know you can't
[39:30] lose the Holy Ghost once you get it cuz
[39:32] God doesn't make mistakes amen the Holy
[39:34] Ghost is a seal to the day of your
[39:37] Redemption it's the earnest of our
[39:38] salvation and our Redemption Jesus said
[39:41] I won't lose one that the father's given
[39:42] me when he gives you the Holy Ghost it's
[39:44] a seal it's a finished work of your soul
[39:47] and you cannot lose it amen God's work
[39:49] is perfect and that that Holy Spirit is
[39:51] just a confirmation of who you always
[39:52] were amen that you are in Christ that
[39:54] you are in God in the very beginning and
[39:56] it's not a confirmation of your
[39:58] Christian performance it's not a
[40:00] confirmation of your family it's not a
[40:01] confirmation of your pastor it's not a a
[40:03] confirmation of your pedigree it's a
[40:05] confirmation that you are in the
[40:07] thoughts of God before the foundation of
[40:08] the world Amen so he gives you that as a
[40:11] seal but here's the thing we can
[40:12] absolutely step out from under the
[40:14] blessings of the Holy Ghost you don't
[40:17] lose the Holy Ghost but you can
[40:18] absolutely lose the blessings because
[40:20] you choose to go away of your own
[40:22] thinking and your your own making amen
[40:24] but we spoke last service about the
[40:26] Battle for our day and that
[40:27] Battlegrounds in our minds and we tend
[40:29] to think because we are natural
[40:31] creatures so often it seems that our
[40:33] battle is natural and so our five senses
[40:35] want to rear up and we want to fight by
[40:37] those outer five senses by what we taste
[40:39] and feel and and hear and smell and all
[40:41] these different things or or we let the
[40:43] the next five senses of the inner person
[40:45] come in and the emotions and the memory
[40:47] and the affections and these different
[40:48] things but that is not the reality of
[40:50] the situations that we're facing anden
[40:53] we go in and we Face difficult people we
[40:55] Face rough people rough times and and
[40:57] things seem to be just going so
[40:59] difficult and we want to get riled up in
[41:01] this flesh and fight in this flesh but
[41:03] Paul would tell us you've missed the
[41:05] Mark when you think that you're fighting
[41:06] against flesh and blood amen you're not
[41:08] fighting people you're not fighting
[41:10] situations you're fighting a spiritual
[41:12] warfare and the battle is always up here
[41:14] first and foremost amen if we go to
[41:17] Ephesians 6 then Paul would say this we
[41:20] want to understand our situations our
[41:23] battles he says finally my brethren be
[41:25] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[41:28] His might the key is not to be strong
[41:31] the key is to be close to God Amen stay
[41:33] close to him unify with Christ that's
[41:36] where our strength is he says Now put on
[41:38] the whole armor of God that ye may be
[41:40] able to stand against the Ws of the
[41:42] devil that means it's not going to be
[41:45] obvious that what comes first to your
[41:48] mind is probably not right in terms of
[41:51] what you're really facing what's really
[41:52] going on it's tricks it's it's obscure
[41:56] it's hidden it's not obvious what
[41:57] Satan's trying to do so many times and
[42:00] Paul continues he says for we wrestle
[42:02] not against flesh and blood but against
[42:05] principalities against Powers against
[42:08] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[42:11] that is not people that is
[42:14] Spirits that's satanic influences he
[42:17] says and it's against spiritual
[42:19] wickedness in high places so this is our
[42:21] battle it is not natural but the thing
[42:23] is because we see naturally that's what
[42:26] we want to dwell on what we see with
[42:28] natural eyes are just where levers are
[42:30] being pulled in the spiritual realm and
[42:32] you've got God on one side and you've
[42:34] got Satan and his demons on the other
[42:36] and God's pulling his levers and Satan's
[42:38] pulling his and the battle is completely
[42:40] outside of anything that we can see
[42:41] unless God opens our eyes amen we're
[42:44] fighting a spiritual warfare against an
[42:47] influence we are not fighting politics
[42:49] we're not fighting racism we're not
[42:50] fighting people we're not fighting the
[42:52] economy we're not fighting governments
[42:54] or any of these things we are fighting
[42:56] Spirits every every single time we're
[42:58] not even fighting disease we're fighting
[43:01] Spirits all of what we Face are spirits
[43:04] amen now notice now in verse 10 because
[43:05] we're speaking on train My Hands to War
[43:08] and we see that we've got to fight and
[43:10] win there's an element of us that's in
[43:12] there but the key of this that we've got
[43:14] to catch is that our strength is in the
[43:16] Lord amen our strength is in him and the
[43:19] power that we have is in his might not
[43:20] in my own amen we all think we're so so
[43:24] strong so many times we're 10t tall and
[43:26] Bulletproof proof and then the trials
[43:29] hit and we're cowered down behind the
[43:31] wall screaming medic medic or help or
[43:34] mommy
[43:35] Mommy come on let's be honest sometimes
[43:38] the faith is great until the bullet
[43:39] whizzes past your head until sickness
[43:42] hit until the bank account starts
[43:44] dwindling down to zero but we see that
[43:47] if our focus is to be strong in the Lord
[43:49] then that ought to be where we're going
[43:50] is getting close to him not building up
[43:53] ourselves but building our relationship
[43:55] with him day by day because that's the
[43:57] one that's going to hold us remember
[43:59] what they said to brother Bram he you
[44:01] know after his wife and daughter died he
[44:02] said did your religion hold you he said
[44:04] or he said did did you hold on to your
[44:06] religion he said no My Religion held on
[44:08] to me there's something inside of us
[44:11] that's holding us in the battle that's
[44:12] giving us strength even when we don't
[44:14] think we can go on and that's the
[44:16] strength of the lord it's the
[44:17] relationship it's the power of the holy
[44:20] spirit inside each and every one of us
[44:23] remember what John says he says ye are
[44:25] of God little children and have overcome
[44:27] them because greater are you than he
[44:30] that is in the world said no Bible
[44:33] scripture ever it says greater is he
[44:36] that is in you than he that is in the
[44:38] world this is not just a salvational
[44:40] scripture this is for the Holy Ghost
[44:43] filled true son and daughter of God this
[44:45] is for children of God that have been
[44:47] baptized that have been sealed this is
[44:49] not for just people that are walking
[44:51] with God these are people that are
[44:53] tabernacling deity day by day that's
[44:55] what this is about amen this is for
[44:58] those that have God on the inside of
[44:59] them not just a casual relationship or
[45:02] when times of need come but it's the
[45:04] people that walk with him day by day by
[45:07] day amen and then when you realize
[45:09] Christ Is In You by the Holy Spirit
[45:11] that's when you recognize that you can
[45:13] win that you've got a victory inside of
[45:15] you amen our first battle the foremost
[45:18] battle is to recognize who wins this
[45:19] battle and it ain't me it's the one
[45:22] that's inside of me brother R would say
[45:25] this he had such a way of doing this he
[45:28] says just like putting a little baby's
[45:30] arm in a sleeve hole you see he's just
[45:32] up and down and over and everything else
[45:35] we only have one little baby here right
[45:36] now but and they get pretty good at it
[45:38] pretty quick but if you tell a baby to
[45:40] put his arms in his sleeves or he thinks
[45:42] you're trying to do it what does he do
[45:43] his arms are just all over the place and
[45:46] all you're trying to do is get him to
[45:47] sit still cuz his arm is going
[45:50] everywhere except the whole for the
[45:52] sleep he says see you you he's just up
[45:55] and down and everything else he says see
[45:57] he can't do it put on your coat honey he
[45:59] can't do it little arm is up and down
[46:01] around it takes your Steady Hand he says
[46:06] oh how glad I am I can just yield my
[46:08] hand to father and say Lord Jesus I
[46:10] can't get in there you help me put the
[46:13] coat on me he says I quit trying just
[46:16] let him do it how do I train my hand for
[46:19] War I put it in his hand I let him guide
[46:23] my hand I let him guide my life he said
[46:25] if the little baby B keeps trying oh I
[46:28] can do it I can do it and he's just
[46:30] everywhere he can't do it and we say
[46:33] that's obvious brother John and then he
[46:35] says neither can
[46:37] you neither can I the prophet of the age
[46:40] the seventh Church age messenger the
[46:43] restorer of the faith he says neither
[46:46] can I but if we'll just hold still and
[46:50] let him do it just yield to him and say
[46:53] here Lord here I am just let me be
[46:56] nothing I yield you put my hand in the
[46:59] right place he says that's the victory
[47:02] that's overcoming the thing you have to
[47:05] overcome is
[47:06] yourself your idea your thing and
[47:10] surrender yourself to him he overcame
[47:13] for you he knows the way we don't like I
[47:18] said we can build ourselves up so easily
[47:20] many times I'm a mature believer I've
[47:22] been serving him for 20 30 40 maybe even
[47:25] 50 years I know what I'm doing 10t tall
[47:28] and
[47:29] bulletproof but there comes a time where
[47:31] you're going to face something you
[47:33] haven't done before and you don't know
[47:35] what to do and you've got to be able to
[47:38] say I don't know but I know a God I have
[47:42] a God that knows exactly what to do in
[47:44] this
[47:45] situation amen so many times even as a
[47:48] new pastor I feel like I'm Flying Blind
[47:51] because I've not done many of these
[47:53] things before there's no way to get
[47:56] experience outside of experience and the
[47:59] only way I know is to say father I don't
[48:03] know what to
[48:05] do I don't know what to do will you help
[48:08] me and usually he does if I'll just
[48:11] stand still and give him a little bit of
[48:14] time amen amen our battle is is to have
[48:17] courage to stand and let him do the
[48:20] work when everything is whizzing around
[48:22] us when when chaos when sickness
[48:25] whatever it might be is pressing in to
[48:27] just stand still and say God I'm in your
[48:29] hands amen all we've been asked to do is
[48:34] believe and stand on that word amen we
[48:37] don't have to bring down
[48:39] Thunder we don't have to call down
[48:41] angels from the Skies of heaven we just
[48:43] have to say Lord I'm trusting your word
[48:45] and I'm going to stand there and I'm
[48:46] going to stay there amen we have to be
[48:48] confident in our position to know that
[48:51] what I'm doing to know where I'm
[48:52] standing to know what I'm trying to
[48:54] achieve is in his will because he's
[48:56] called me to do it and when we come to
[48:58] that place we've got full confidence
[49:00] that he's going to answer us Amen
[49:02] brother B puts it this way because he
[49:04] said remember greater is he that's in
[49:05] you that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:07] he says you've at least got the baptism
[49:10] of the Holy Ghost if you have the Holy
[49:12] Ghost this morning listen he says this
[49:15] whole group here you raised your hands
[49:17] what's that the greatest weapon you can
[49:19] put in your hands with the word of God
[49:22] behind to back it up you got the Holy
[49:25] Ghost and the word is behind it we'll do
[49:27] a quote later where he says where you
[49:29] got the word and then the Holy Ghost
[49:30] behind it that's the greatest weapon
[49:32] you've got is the Bible in your hands
[49:34] and the Holy Ghost to back it up what
[49:36] does that look like oh people say oh
[49:38] that's power brother that's a spoken
[49:40] word brother yes I believe it is but
[49:43] remember we are only
[49:45] vessels what matters is not the vessel
[49:48] what matters is what's in the vessel in
[49:49] this case amen and so yes it's power yes
[49:52] it's speaking the word but remember the
[49:54] bride will have thus sayeth the Lord or
[49:56] she'll stay silent we'll find his will
[49:59] or we'll be quiet until we find it and
[50:01] we'll be at rest in the waiting amen
[50:06] what matters is not me what matters is
[50:07] inside of me that's the thing that I'm
[50:09] trusting in these things amen I'm just
[50:11] trying to stay out of his way try not to
[50:14] inject my thoughts my ideas the way I
[50:16] think it should be
[50:18] done I'm trying to just let him do his
[50:21] job and just keep me as much out of it
[50:24] amen you know if I could be honest I
[50:25] found and preach
[50:27] the harder I try the worse I
[50:30] do if I come into a service and I've got
[50:33] an
[50:34] intention if I'm trying to get a
[50:36] response out of the people if I'm trying
[50:38] to get Brother David to do a Jericho
[50:40] merch guess what brother David's never
[50:43] going to do a Jericho March because I
[50:44] come in and say that I want him to do it
[50:47] if I want to use my
[50:48] discernment
[50:50] right what
[50:52] happens
[50:54] nothing intellectual stimulation at at
[50:57] best that's it that is all you're going
[51:00] to get out of it that's all that's going
[51:01] to come because what is it it's me
[51:03] trying to use him rather than him trying
[51:06] to use me and it doesn't work that way
[51:09] that is always a failure because how can
[51:11] a man wield God that's not the way it
[51:14] works I've got to get out of the
[51:16] way and say Lord what would you have
[51:19] what would you have me to say and in the
[51:21] Simplicity of that Faith he works time
[51:24] and time and time again and I usually
[51:27] have no clue what he's
[51:29] doing I don't I'm just preaching by
[51:33] faith because of what he's laid on my
[51:36] heart
[51:37] amen otherwise people are just going to
[51:39] get head knowledge and that leads us to
[51:40] religion rather than the Holy Ghost it's
[51:43] no good for us remember we would talk
[51:45] about perfect strength through perfect
[51:47] perfect weakness brother Brown would
[51:49] preach a whole message on that we're
[51:51] going to talk about that a little bit
[51:52] more a lot more on Sunday Lord willing
[51:55] amen but we've got to realize sometimes
[51:57] we we we look at at other believers that
[51:59] are stronger we look at Believers we
[52:02] admire where they are and we think well
[52:03] they've got it easier because they're
[52:05] stronger because they're more gifted and
[52:08] let me put it to you this way the ones
[52:09] that are strongest often struggle the
[52:11] most because they've got a struggle to
[52:13] get out of out of his way the most
[52:15] gifted have to get out of the way and
[52:17] it's a lot harder to get out of the way
[52:19] when you think you bring something to
[52:20] the table that's what Paul had to do
[52:23] Paul came with great gifts great
[52:25] knowledge years and years of training he
[52:28] was the best of the best and he said
[52:30] until I counted it as dung he couldn't
[52:32] do anything with
[52:34] me your strength is not what's going to
[52:36] make you great in the Kingdom your gifts
[52:38] are not what's going to make you great
[52:39] in the Kingdom it's how small you can
[52:41] make yourself brother brandom said how
[52:43] small you can make yourself in these
[52:44] sort of things amen people that are
[52:47] strong they struggle to surrender and it
[52:49] hinders them more than it helps them
[52:51] because they're trying to do it
[52:52] themselves brother B would tell this
[52:53] story about brother Paul Raider who is a
[52:55] missionary over in Africa if you
[52:56] remember remember he got Blackwater
[52:58] fever over there and with Blackwater
[53:00] fever the way brother brandom tells it
[53:02] is you would go into a coma and you
[53:04] would die and he got it and he went into
[53:06] a coma and he wasn't expected to survive
[53:09] and he tells his story and I just wanted
[53:10] to share it this evening to help us out
[53:12] because we can think we're so strong or
[53:15] we think we because we're not strong
[53:17] that we can't get anywhere but listen to
[53:19] this he said he was dreaming he was back
[53:20] up in Oregon again and that was his home
[53:23] where he used to chop the trees he was a
[53:24] very strong man
[53:27] his boss one time told him he was
[53:29] dreaming he said go up on the mountain
[53:31] Paul and cut me a certain sized log and
[53:33] bring it down he said all right boss he
[53:34] ran up the hillside with the spring of
[53:36] Youth in His Feet Again in his dream
[53:39] when he was unconscious and he said he
[53:41] fell the tree right easy he said he
[53:43] could feel the ax as it went down
[53:44] through the soft organ fur and the tree
[53:47] dropped and he trimmed it up like that
[53:48] stuck his ax into the tree and tried to
[53:51] pick it up everything went smoothly he
[53:53] ran up with the with with the feet of
[53:55] Youth he he had the Speed he had the
[53:57] stamina chopped the tree down no problem
[53:59] trimmed it out thunk put his ax into the
[54:02] tree and tried to lift it he says and he
[54:05] said his strength was gone from him he
[54:08] said he done everything he could to pick
[54:10] it up he said well my strength's
[54:11] completely gone brother R says maybe
[54:14] that's where you are tonight your
[54:16] strength completely gone the hope is
[54:18] gone everything's gone he said he toiled
[54:21] and he said well I ought to be able to
[54:23] lift this I ought to be able to pick
[54:25] this up' why I picked them up like this
[54:28] before he says maybe you've been healed
[54:30] before maybe you've been through prayer
[54:32] lines and you've been healed but this
[54:34] time you just can't simply muster enough
[54:37] Faith to get it up the load somehow what
[54:40] you used to be able to do you can't do
[54:42] anymore you got healed before now you
[54:44] don't have faith to get healed maybe
[54:46] you've lost your joy maybe your peace
[54:48] maybe you've lost your worship maybe
[54:50] your trust you had something before and
[54:53] it was a strength for you and now you
[54:54] come to do something you've done so many
[54:56] times before and it doesn't
[54:59] happen and we think we've dropped
[55:02] off we've Fallen back we backslid and we
[55:06] failed we're no
[55:11] good he says he just got completely worn
[55:16] out I know what this is like working on
[55:19] Rusty vehicles in New Finland where I
[55:22] have gone out to do a simple break rotor
[55:25] change on on my car and spent 3 hours
[55:29] trying to get a brake rotor off to the
[55:32] point where I wanted to
[55:35] cry beating on it with the heaviest
[55:38] hammers I've got impact this driver that
[55:42] everything I can do to beat that thing
[55:43] off and it won't move and it should be
[55:46] so simple I've done it many times
[55:49] before and it won't move and you just
[55:52] want to sit there and
[55:55] cry and you know what I've learned pray
[55:59] before you work on cars and new fin L
[56:03] because inevitably after I pray it comes
[56:06] off but I think it's just God teaching
[56:08] me that listen I care about everything
[56:10] you do and I'm in there to help you in
[56:14] everything you do see I don't think I
[56:16] need him to change a break
[56:18] rotor but I do in new fin land I
[56:22] do and so Paul Raider sitting there and
[56:25] he's completely warning out trying to
[56:27] move something that he's always been
[56:29] able to move trying to do something he
[56:31] ought to be able to
[56:33] do he says so he just sat down ducked
[56:36] his head down and started crying said
[56:38] I'm so weak I can't move I've lost my
[56:41] strength and I don't know what I'll do
[56:45] he said he heard the voice of his boss
[56:47] so gentle and kind he said Paul what's
[56:49] the matter he said boss I just haven't
[56:52] got the strength to pick it up I just
[56:54] simply can't get it down there there he
[56:57] says Paul you're just doing it in vain
[56:59] you're just tussling in
[57:00] vain but Lord you said I should be able
[57:03] to do it you told me to do it your word
[57:05] tells me I'm supposed to be able to do
[57:08] it and then he said Paul don't you see
[57:12] that stream down over
[57:14] there he says that stream runs right by
[57:17] the camp said why don't you just push it
[57:20] over in the water and jump on and write
[57:23] it down there's always a way
[57:27] provided see Paul Raider was thinking
[57:29] I've got to do it the way I've always
[57:31] done it but there was always a way he
[57:33] could have done it and he'd never found
[57:35] it because he was relying on his
[57:37] strength now he's come to a place where
[57:39] his strengths run out and this voice
[57:41] says why don't you try it the way I've
[57:42] provided now the easier way was there
[57:45] all
[57:46] along he said and he said when he looked
[57:49] back his boss was Jesus said just pitch
[57:51] it over in the water PW don't try
[57:53] anymore just get on it and ride down he
[57:56] said he just pitched it over in the
[57:58] water jumped in the water be to Splash
[58:00] in the water and the current taking it
[58:02] right on down to Camp he began screaming
[58:05] at the top of his voice that his
[58:07] strength was all coming to him holler
[58:10] I'm riding on it and he said he came two
[58:12] in the room screaming at the top of his
[58:14] voice his wife who had been having her
[58:16] hands laid on her hands laying on him
[58:19] praying said he jumped up in the middle
[58:21] of the room screaming when he come to
[58:22] himself I'm a riding on it I'm a riding
[58:25] on it I'm aiding writing on it he's
[58:28] supposed to be
[58:30] dead his strength's supposed to be gone
[58:32] and he comes out of it and he's got all
[58:33] of his strength back he says brother
[58:36] that's what it is tonight I take Jesus
[58:38] Christ at his promise throw the thing
[58:41] into the Waters of the Holy Ghost and
[58:42] I'll ride on it Hallelujah no matter
[58:44] what takes place I'm riding on it he
[58:47] says right just keep a riding no matter
[58:49] what everyone anybody else says no
[58:51] matter how many times you've tried just
[58:53] push it over and start riding on it God
[58:55] will will take you right down to the
[58:58] place where you ought to be he says
[59:01] don't you believe it see Paul Raider was
[59:04] trusting in his strength Paul Raider was
[59:06] trusting in his Works he was trusting in
[59:08] his past experiences and there came a
[59:10] place where he needed to go beyond all
[59:12] of those things and Jesus said why don't
[59:13] you take my way you can't do this just
[59:16] listen to me do it the way I show you
[59:18] and all of a sudden you'll find you've
[59:19] got exactly what you were looking for
[59:21] amen our Victory is because Christ has
[59:23] already made a way through Calvary he's
[59:26] made a way through the Holy Ghost amen
[59:28] he's made a way through the word and
[59:29] he's just trying to get us to the place
[59:31] where we'll step out and start relying
[59:33] on that rather than trying to force the
[59:35] issue ourselves Amen Brother John Andes
[59:38] just preached a service on we are his
[59:41] victory and he shared this quote and I
[59:43] just wanted to share it with us tonight
[59:45] it struck me as such a beautiful thing
[59:47] he says this we are his victory Train My
[59:51] Hands to War listen you are the
[59:54] victory the war is for you and you've
[59:56] already won he says the church is his
[59:59] victory we come forth in this last days
[1:00:02] with this glorious gospel showing his
[1:00:04] victory he died for this purpose what
[1:00:07] that we would have the victory he's
[1:00:09] already paid the price he's already made
[1:00:11] the way for
[1:00:14] us he says he died for this purpose and
[1:00:17] we are proof of his victory amen when we
[1:00:19] see him coming down and living among the
[1:00:21] church that's his victory shows that he
[1:00:24] couldn't keep him in the grave and
[1:00:25] neither can they keep us that's right
[1:00:27] we're bound right and we're already
[1:00:29] potentially Arisen because we've raised
[1:00:31] from Death unbelief in his word that's
[1:00:33] what death is to disbelieve his word
[1:00:36] from denominational Creeds to his
[1:00:38] eternal word of the Eternal God he says
[1:00:41] which is he himself working through US
[1:00:45] manifesting himself that he is the same
[1:00:47] yesterday today and forever that's the
[1:00:51] victory Train My Hands to War let go and
[1:00:54] let God have his way that's what we're
[1:00:56] talking about this evening we're resting
[1:00:58] on his word on his life on his
[1:01:00] overcoming power on his Word of Promise
[1:01:03] on his very love on the sacrifice on the
[1:01:05] price that he's already paid that's our
[1:01:07] rest this evening and me that's what
[1:01:09] we're leaning on this morning I'm
[1:01:11] winning because Christ said I'd win not
[1:01:14] because I'm a winner but because he made
[1:01:15] me a winner he made me an overcomer he
[1:01:17] said that I would have it in this age
[1:01:19] amen we see that we've got it but we see
[1:01:22] the world has an indwelling presence the
[1:01:23] same way and it's one them
[1:01:26] we are his victory but you'll see the
[1:01:28] world is Satan's Victory today and it's
[1:01:30] a contrary Spirit to what we have amen
[1:01:33] the world's full of demonic spirits and
[1:01:35] and lustful things and and the lust of
[1:01:37] the eyes and the lust of the Flesh and
[1:01:39] it's beastly and it's carnal and it's
[1:01:41] religious even all of these things are
[1:01:43] Satan's influence over us and we're
[1:01:45] fighting those Spirits we're not
[1:01:46] fighting those people we're fighting
[1:01:48] those influences not governments and and
[1:01:50] these different things amen so our
[1:01:51] overcoming is always going to be over a
[1:01:53] spirit not over a person we do not
[1:01:56] attack people
[1:01:58] ever
[1:02:01] ever but we fight a
[1:02:04] spirit and you can fight a spirit
[1:02:06] without fighting a person absolutely
[1:02:09] amen the physical we said before there's
[1:02:12] levers being pulled Satan's pulling
[1:02:13] God's pulling his and Satan's pulling
[1:02:15] his and what we see happening in the
[1:02:17] natural is just a reflection of what's
[1:02:19] happening in the Supernatural in the
[1:02:20] spiritual amen we're a reflection of
[1:02:22] God's work in the spiritual realm and
[1:02:24] we'll see the world is a reflection of
[1:02:26] Satan's work in a spiritual realm that's
[1:02:28] why Paul said we wrestle not against
[1:02:29] flesh and blood but against
[1:02:31] principalities and powers and rulers of
[1:02:32] the darkness of the world and spiritual
[1:02:34] wickedness in high places even Satan
[1:02:36] himself has come down and he's working
[1:02:39] in people if you look in the in the in
[1:02:42] the gospels you see that Jesus said that
[1:02:45] or the word says that Satan entered into
[1:02:47] Judas he gave an intent and he put into
[1:02:51] his his heart to to betray him and then
[1:02:53] at the at the table with Jesus Satan
[1:02:56] literally enters in and he becomes the
[1:02:57] son of
[1:02:59] predition Satan enters into a person and
[1:03:01] today people are completely filled with
[1:03:03] demonic spirits and they have no clue
[1:03:04] what they're doing even to the point of
[1:03:06] thinking they're doing righteousness and
[1:03:08] they're
[1:03:09] not but watch this we're talking about
[1:03:12] Train My Hands to War we're talking
[1:03:13] about how do I win how do I hold how do
[1:03:15] I overcome very familiar quote overcome
[1:03:19] means to recognize the devil in every
[1:03:22] one of his tricks remember we read that
[1:03:24] first scripture where it talked about
[1:03:25] his wife WS the Ws of the enemy it's not
[1:03:29] obvious he says a lot of people say
[1:03:31] there's no devil it's just a thought
[1:03:33] don't you believe that there's a real
[1:03:35] devil and he's just as real as you are
[1:03:37] or anybody a real devil and you must
[1:03:39] recognize him real you must know he's a
[1:03:42] devil then at the same time you
[1:03:44] recognize him know that he's a devil and
[1:03:46] he's against you then to re overcome you
[1:03:49] must recognize that the god in you 1
[1:03:52] John 4:4 greater is he that's in you
[1:03:55] that the god in you is greater and
[1:03:57] mightier than he is that the one that's
[1:03:59] in you has already overcome him already
[1:04:03] overcome him doesn't that change the
[1:04:07] battle when you know there is no battle
[1:04:08] to be won you're facing a defeated enemy
[1:04:12] that nothing can prosper against
[1:04:15] us that completely changes how we look
[1:04:18] at the situation
[1:04:20] now he says that he has already the that
[1:04:23] the one that's in you has already
[1:04:24] overcome him and by his grace hallelujah
[1:04:28] it's by his grace you are more than a
[1:04:31] match for him he says amen that's real
[1:04:34] overcoming when you
[1:04:36] recognize amen when you recognize what
[1:04:40] greater is he that's in me I've got
[1:04:42] something that the world can't give and
[1:04:44] the world can't take it away we sing
[1:04:46] that song Amen there's something inside
[1:04:48] of me that is already overcome every
[1:04:51] single demon every single situation
[1:04:53] every Temptation every lust every
[1:04:56] problem that I face he's already come
[1:04:57] and he's defeated it and now he's in me
[1:05:00] to do what the very same thing it's the
[1:05:03] works of Christ all over again
[1:05:05] overcoming the works and destroying the
[1:05:07] works of Satan last service we we spoke
[1:05:09] of how the most important thing you can
[1:05:11] know is that you're a child of God
[1:05:14] because when you know it then you can
[1:05:15] trust it and when you trust it it can
[1:05:18] start to take effect as brother Jerry
[1:05:19] Fury was talking about this last week I
[1:05:21] don't care if you win $100 million I
[1:05:23] don't care if you become the CEO of the
[1:05:25] of the biggest company in the world the
[1:05:27] greatest thing you can ever have is
[1:05:28] knowing that you're a child of God you
[1:05:30] can rest on that you can take it to the
[1:05:32] bank amen and it's worth 10,000 worlds
[1:05:36] to know who you are amen because when we
[1:05:38] realize that that tells us who our daddy
[1:05:40] is amen my daddy's not Lanny
[1:05:44] klet I was talking to a brother not not
[1:05:47] too long ago and I said the greatest
[1:05:49] thing that happened to me in my
[1:05:50] relationship with my Earthly father was
[1:05:52] when I recognized he wasn't my father
[1:05:54] cuz now my expectations of him can
[1:05:56] change my love to him can change my
[1:05:59] disappointments to him don't have to be
[1:06:00] there the same way why because I've got
[1:06:03] a heavenly father that loves me more
[1:06:04] than my my Earthly father ever could and
[1:06:06] he provides for me in a way that my
[1:06:08] Earthly father never could you that have
[1:06:10] a Godly father praise the Lord you're
[1:06:13] blessed but not all of us do but I'll
[1:06:15] tell you you've got to rest on the
[1:06:16] Earthly father's lineage not your
[1:06:18] Earthly father's lineage
[1:06:20] amen when we know who our father is that
[1:06:23] tells us who our kingdom is it tells us
[1:06:24] who our family is it tells us who our
[1:06:26] weapons what weapons we have it tells us
[1:06:28] who our fellow soldiers are tells us
[1:06:30] what our objective is tells us what our
[1:06:32] rules are it determines everything that
[1:06:34] we do in our life when we know who we
[1:06:36] are and Paul will come back to this in
[1:06:38] Ephesians 6 because he's placing us now
[1:06:41] how we battle against Satan how we fight
[1:06:44] how we train Our Hands to War he says
[1:06:45] wherefore taking unto you the whole
[1:06:47] armor of God that you may be able to
[1:06:50] withstand in the evil day and having
[1:06:52] done all to stand when it's all said in
[1:06:55] done we're still standing nothing else
[1:06:58] is left except the bride of Christ
[1:07:00] that's it right everyone else might
[1:07:03] follow scripture says a thousand will
[1:07:05] follow my side and 10,000 at my right
[1:07:06] hand but it'll not come nigh unto me
[1:07:09] things that will take out everyone else
[1:07:11] can't touch you they can beat on you
[1:07:14] they can battle against you but you're
[1:07:16] left standing if you'll take on this
[1:07:17] Armor of
[1:07:19] God he says stand therefore having your
[1:07:21] loins G about with truth truth doesn't
[1:07:24] mean knowing your
[1:07:26] right that's not what we do not
[1:07:28] wear a girdle that says I am right it
[1:07:32] says wear a girdle of
[1:07:33] Truth amen the word is right and I'm
[1:07:37] standing on the word I'm not wrapping
[1:07:39] myself in my rightness I'm wrapping
[1:07:41] myself with the word of God Amen when
[1:07:43] you're standing on truth you don't need
[1:07:45] to
[1:07:46] fight my wife was sharing with me about
[1:07:50] I don't know when it was but maybe it
[1:07:51] was in the days of Wesley and whatnot
[1:07:53] they wouldn't go out and argue they
[1:07:55] wouldn't have theological debates why
[1:07:57] because they believe that the that the
[1:07:59] truth could stand on its own they didn't
[1:08:01] have to defend it the results come if
[1:08:04] you stay with the truth so you don't
[1:08:06] have to fight about it what could be
[1:08:07] what might be these different things you
[1:08:09] just present the truth and they take it
[1:08:10] or they leave it that's what Jesus told
[1:08:12] them remember he says go in and if they
[1:08:15] accept you wonderful give them the
[1:08:17] blessing if they don't just shake the
[1:08:19] dust off your feet and move on the truth
[1:08:21] will do the work amen after that it says
[1:08:25] having your Lo loins gir about with
[1:08:26] truth and having on the breastplate of
[1:08:29] righteousness now the breast breastplate
[1:08:32] covers your your upper half of your body
[1:08:34] are major organs and remember it's not
[1:08:37] our righteousness that covers Us it's
[1:08:38] his righteousness the robe that we wear
[1:08:41] is his righteousness and so often we
[1:08:43] find truth and righteousness tied
[1:08:44] together because we think we're right
[1:08:46] and therefore we are self-righteous and
[1:08:48] we wrap ourselves with
[1:08:49] self-righteousness and you know what
[1:08:50] that does nothing self-righteousness
[1:08:54] stops no weapons
[1:08:56] in fact it exposes you to everything
[1:08:59] because self-righteousness has no value
[1:09:01] it has no
[1:09:04] strength when we're trying to prove
[1:09:06] we're
[1:09:07] right it's the biggest trap that Satan
[1:09:10] has for a Believer today trying to be
[1:09:13] right rather than standing on truth
[1:09:16] because what it leads to is divisions it
[1:09:18] leads to splits and it leads to a
[1:09:20] religious
[1:09:22] spirit because it's not about me being
[1:09:24] right
[1:09:26] I'll never be
[1:09:27] right right means to be true by the word
[1:09:30] of God with the right motive the right
[1:09:33] objective and guess what we don't have
[1:09:36] that all the time I don't at
[1:09:38] least it doesn't take us anywhere good
[1:09:41] needing to be known as right I've got
[1:09:43] written here says it usually leads to a
[1:09:44] religious spirit rather than the holy
[1:09:46] spirit amen I'm not here to be right I'm
[1:09:49] here to stand with truth and the truth
[1:09:52] will protect itself he says in your feet
[1:09:54] Shaw the preparation of the gospel of
[1:09:57] peace notice the intention of where you
[1:09:59] go is with peace remember the scripture
[1:10:01] says if it be possible as much as lies
[1:10:04] in you live peaceably with all men we do
[1:10:07] not go seeking a fight because if you
[1:10:10] seek a fight you're going to get a
[1:10:11] fight because remember we're we're
[1:10:14] dealing with spirits but the spirits are
[1:10:15] in people so if I go around with a chip
[1:10:18] on my shoulder called being right then
[1:10:21] I'm going to find a battle everywhere I
[1:10:23] go but if I can walk in came with the
[1:10:25] intention of being at peace and
[1:10:28] sometimes peace is because I choose not
[1:10:30] to
[1:10:31] fight sometimes the greatest battle
[1:10:33] you'll fight is walking
[1:10:35] away not choosing to
[1:10:38] engage I don't care who we are we're not
[1:10:40] going to intellectually argue somebody
[1:10:43] into Christ it doesn't work that way
[1:10:46] they need a personal
[1:10:47] revelation and so we can present in
[1:10:49] humility and meekness and let it
[1:10:53] go and then Paul says above all three
[1:10:56] things above
[1:10:58] all he says taking the shield of Faith
[1:11:01] Why without faith it's impossible to
[1:11:03] please him we walk by faith not by sight
[1:11:06] he says above all all he says taking the
[1:11:09] shield of Faith whereby wherewith ye
[1:11:11] shall be able to quench all the fiery
[1:11:13] darts of the wicked Faith stops those
[1:11:16] darts and then it quenches them what is
[1:11:18] it it takes out doubt it neutralizes it
[1:11:24] we don't fire them back
[1:11:26] Faith doesn't take the enemy's arrow and
[1:11:27] then shoot it back at them it stops it
[1:11:30] puts the fire out and then you keep
[1:11:31] walking on it absorbs them says take the
[1:11:34] helmet of salvation what does the helmet
[1:11:37] protect the head the mind the thing that
[1:11:39] keeps us is his grace it's his salvation
[1:11:43] amen that keeps our mind amen the
[1:11:45] Revelation the certainty that I am saved
[1:11:47] I am his I am his elected bride I am his
[1:11:50] chosen children that's what holds me day
[1:11:53] by day brother Steven strew would talk
[1:11:54] about Prest destination he says
[1:11:56] predestination is the chain that keeps
[1:11:58] you tied to
[1:11:59] God it's a beautiful thing you can't get
[1:12:01] away from it you've got some movement in
[1:12:03] there but you can never get away it
[1:12:06] protects the Mind salvation protects the
[1:12:08] Mind amen the battle of the mind is what
[1:12:10] will you take the word or will you take
[1:12:12] Common Sense education reason these
[1:12:15] different things none of those are the
[1:12:16] weapon of the believer the weapon of the
[1:12:19] Believers it is written it is written it
[1:12:21] is
[1:12:24] written he says the he says and then
[1:12:26] take on the sword of the spirit which is
[1:12:29] the word of God there's only one weapon
[1:12:31] that we hold there are many weapons we
[1:12:34] have but there's one he weapon that we
[1:12:36] hold and he says it is the word of
[1:12:39] God Amen the sword of the spirit which
[1:12:42] is the word of the god word of God what
[1:12:44] are Satan's weapons we're going to get
[1:12:46] into this in a second common
[1:12:49] sense that's what brother Bram said it's
[1:12:51] Common Sense intellect reasoning
[1:12:57] Satan says pick up my
[1:12:59] weapon and then we'll have a then we'll
[1:13:02] have a battle that'll never work then he
[1:13:05] says praying always with all prayer and
[1:13:06] supplication in the spirit and watching
[1:13:09] there unto with all perseverance and
[1:13:11] supplication for All Saints you know
[1:13:12] what that means I'm not just in it for
[1:13:14] me I'm here for you you're here for me
[1:13:17] my wife was telling me on the way over
[1:13:19] about one of her cousins that got cancer
[1:13:23] and she reached out to her mom this this
[1:13:25] woman wasn't going to church wasn't
[1:13:26] serving the lord and she said I I know
[1:13:28] that God answers prayer when you guys
[1:13:30] pray and so her mother went and they
[1:13:32] told her to the church and the sisters
[1:13:34] got together and they fasted and prayed
[1:13:35] and God healed that woman of
[1:13:37] cancer we're not just in the battle for
[1:13:39] ourselves I'm not in it for me I'm in it
[1:13:42] for you and you're in it for me right
[1:13:45] right amen we're all in it together amen
[1:13:49] if I've got the victory if things are
[1:13:50] going for me you know what I need to be
[1:13:52] doing praying for the one that's not got
[1:13:53] it so easy right now not relaxing in my
[1:13:56] couch at home you know like the rich
[1:13:59] rich young or the rich ruler that just
[1:14:01] sat back and said you know Soul take thy
[1:14:05] ease you've got money in the bank you've
[1:14:08] got a good
[1:14:09] job you got a beautiful wife your kids
[1:14:12] are all going to
[1:14:13] church sit back That's what Satan loves
[1:14:16] to do get you to sit back While others
[1:14:19] are fighting the battle anden we got to
[1:14:21] get in the battle and help each other
[1:14:22] out amen now we're talking about
[1:14:24] teaching my hands teach My Hands to War
[1:14:27] and we see here in in verse 17 that
[1:14:29] there's only one great weapon given to
[1:14:31] the church spiritually speaking now
[1:14:33] we'll see this as we go into future
[1:14:34] Services where brother br will say the
[1:14:36] greatest weapon is the greatest weapon
[1:14:38] is the greatest weapon is but you'll see
[1:14:40] that those are often attitudes and
[1:14:43] approaches but there is one thing that
[1:14:45] you can use as a literal response to
[1:14:47] Satan every time and it's right there it
[1:14:50] is what it is the sword of the spirit
[1:14:52] which is the word of God it's only one
[1:14:55] work weapon that works against Satan
[1:14:56] himself and that's the word of God it's
[1:14:59] something you can say and it's something
[1:15:00] you can do and that's to put the word on
[1:15:02] your lips it is
[1:15:04] written brother Bram takes us back to
[1:15:06] Jesus and and his in his trial with
[1:15:09] Satan he says that Old Devil now you
[1:15:10] think he's Brazen you think he'll attack
[1:15:12] a child he says he'll attack anything
[1:15:15] and haven't we seen it he doesn't care
[1:15:17] how old your kids are he'll go after
[1:15:19] them won't he if he can't get you he'll
[1:15:22] go after your kids and get you that way
[1:15:24] he says he'll attack anything he
[1:15:25] attacked Jesus
[1:15:27] Christ he's not smart he came at him
[1:15:29] with three wild attacks Satan just don't
[1:15:32] didn't didn't just only attack once
[1:15:34] he'll attack you with a disease then
[1:15:35] he'll come back and attack you and tell
[1:15:37] you the days of Miracles has passed you
[1:15:39] didn't get healed there's nothing to it
[1:15:41] he attacked Jesus three times and with
[1:15:43] three wild attacks he run in on Jesus
[1:15:46] with his unbelief in God's word he says
[1:15:48] now what did Jesus do you're saying
[1:15:50] brother John how do I win Jesus was the
[1:15:53] word of God he was the word now he
[1:15:56] attacked the word Satan did he says
[1:15:58] glory in the beginning was the word the
[1:16:00] word was with God the Word was God and
[1:16:02] the word dwelt and made flesh and dwelt
[1:16:04] Among Us Jesus was the word and what did
[1:16:06] he do he cut him to Ribbons what did
[1:16:10] Jesus do he was the word so with the
[1:16:12] word he cut Satan on his wild attack he
[1:16:14] flew in there like a bunch of
[1:16:16] Stormtroopers or something another like
[1:16:18] that he flew in on Jesus the word like
[1:16:20] that and Jesus took that word and sliced
[1:16:23] him to pieces Hallelujah sure he sliced
[1:16:25] him to pieces defeated him with the word
[1:16:29] we think it's some big
[1:16:31] thing Jesus had three very simple
[1:16:34] answers Jesus did not go on with a 30
[1:16:37] minute
[1:16:38] sermon he took him back to the balance
[1:16:41] of the word every time and that was
[1:16:46] it that's all he had to do it wasn't
[1:16:49] this back and forth he attacked once
[1:16:52] Jesus corrected him with the word he
[1:16:54] attacked again Jesus corrected him with
[1:16:56] the word he attacked again Jesus
[1:16:57] corrected him with the word and it was
[1:16:59] finished he couldn't get past the
[1:17:02] word he says see his attack watch listen
[1:17:06] close this closing his attack is what
[1:17:10] disbelieve God's word that's his attack
[1:17:12] so that's our
[1:17:13] battle believe the word or let Satan
[1:17:17] cause you to disbelieve it he says there
[1:17:20] can you see the greatest battle was ever
[1:17:21] fought there's only two forces Satan and
[1:17:24] God and what is Satan's weapon against
[1:17:26] you is to try and get you to disbelieve
[1:17:30] your weapon he disarms you if he can get
[1:17:33] you to disbelieve your weapon is
[1:17:35] equivalent if he gets you to believe
[1:17:37] that your weapon is not strong enough he
[1:17:40] has disarmed
[1:17:42] you so what do you do if you think that
[1:17:44] your weapon's no good you'll lay it down
[1:17:46] and you'll pick up another one and guess
[1:17:48] what every other weapon belongs to
[1:17:50] Satan and he trains with it and he's
[1:17:53] been training with it for thousands
[1:17:54] thousands and thousands of years so
[1:17:57] guess what I can pick up reason as a
[1:17:59] weapon and Satan will beat me every time
[1:18:03] because I've got 44 years of experience
[1:18:05] I've been practicing reason since I was
[1:18:07] a
[1:18:09] child Satan's been doing it for
[1:18:11] Millennia I can pick up my common sense
[1:18:15] and try and fight him with that and
[1:18:17] he'll beat me
[1:18:18] blue why he's got a a PhD many times
[1:18:23] over in com sense education Satan's
[1:18:27] playground I can never pick up Satan's
[1:18:29] weapons and beat him with it they're his
[1:18:32] weapons I can't beat somebody with their
[1:18:34] own weapons I've got to stick with what
[1:18:36] I've got brother baham says this way he
[1:18:38] says look he's disarmed you when he gets
[1:18:40] you to disbelieve that weapon when you
[1:18:43] lay that down that finishes your
[1:18:47] fight Train My Hands to War hold on to
[1:18:51] the word
[1:18:52] then he says your done so he says hold
[1:18:56] that weapon don't you lay it down can I
[1:19:00] put it this way make sure you pick it
[1:19:03] up you can't lay it down if you never
[1:19:05] pick it up you got to pick it up and
[1:19:07] once you pick it up make sure you don't
[1:19:09] lay it down does it matter if we read
[1:19:11] our Bibles Church does it matter if we
[1:19:14] read all of our
[1:19:15] Bibles when you look at Jesus's answers
[1:19:18] to Satan they did not come from one
[1:19:20] chapter they came from all through the
[1:19:22] Books of Moses
[1:19:25] everywhere he knew his Bible inside and
[1:19:28] out it
[1:19:30] matters not just listen to the prophet
[1:19:33] not just listen to Brother John you got
[1:19:36] to read your Bible because that is the
[1:19:38] only thing that will defeat him it's the
[1:19:40] word of God Amen and that's a day by day
[1:19:44] by day thing it's a day by day by day
[1:19:48] thing you I was reading of David's
[1:19:50] Mighty Men And if you look in the
[1:19:52] scriptures David had some amazing
[1:19:53] Warriors but there was three that stood
[1:19:55] above all and the first one was adino
[1:19:57] the eite and he killed 800 soldiers all
[1:20:00] by himself remember Samson killed a
[1:20:02] thousand granted with a job own of a
[1:20:05] donkey but this guy killed 8,000 or 800
[1:20:08] with a spear all by himself but the
[1:20:10] number two guy is the one I want to look
[1:20:12] at this evening because it says after
[1:20:14] him was elazar the son of Dodo the aloh
[1:20:17] heite came from Hawaii one of the three
[1:20:19] mighty men with David when they defied
[1:20:21] the Philistines that were gathered
[1:20:23] together to battle and the men of Israel
[1:20:25] were gone
[1:20:27] away sometimes even the great warriors
[1:20:30] get on the
[1:20:31] run but this guy's one of the three the
[1:20:34] chief three it says and he
[1:20:38] arose you know what that
[1:20:40] means he probably got knocked
[1:20:44] down can't arise if you're already
[1:20:47] up he got knocked on his
[1:20:49] keester and then finally he said
[1:20:51] enough's enough he said and he smot the
[1:20:54] philis ing until his hand was weary and
[1:20:58] his hand clave unto The Sword and the
[1:21:00] Lord W wrought a great victory that day
[1:21:03] and the people returned after him only
[1:21:06] to spoil notice it says his hand was
[1:21:08] weary he fought until his hand was weary
[1:21:11] but that it says his hand clave unto the
[1:21:14] sword he fought so long that his sword
[1:21:16] became a part of his
[1:21:19] hand you think you're tired get so tired
[1:21:23] that you can't let go of the word
[1:21:25] he fought until his hand became fused to
[1:21:28] the handle of his sword he got so used
[1:21:31] to holding it and so tightly was he
[1:21:33] gripping it that he could not even let
[1:21:36] it go if he wanted to he couldn't change
[1:21:38] weapons if he wanted to his hand was
[1:21:41] clenched around his sword and nobody
[1:21:43] could break that grip no weapon that was
[1:21:46] formed against him could Prosper cuz he
[1:21:47] couldn't even let go of it himself he
[1:21:49] had fought so long with that sword he
[1:21:51] had become one with the sword
[1:21:54] church we need to come to the place
[1:21:56] where we can't let go of it even if we
[1:21:57] want to where this is the only weapon
[1:22:00] that we've got our hand is formed to it
[1:22:03] our hand is tight around it and we can't
[1:22:06] lose it no matter what we try it's there
[1:22:09] until the battle is
[1:22:12] over it's the word of God we've got to
[1:22:15] come to that place where that word's a
[1:22:16] part of our hand and it's the only thing
[1:22:19] we go to amen it is written it is
[1:22:21] written it is written it is written
[1:22:24] listen you don't have to have 12
[1:22:25] scriptures to defeat Satan you just have
[1:22:27] to stick with one that applies to the
[1:22:30] situation that will do the
[1:22:33] job I am the Lord that Health all thy
[1:22:37] diseases I am the Lord that Health all
[1:22:40] thy diseases I am the Lord I am the Lord
[1:22:44] I am the Lord that's
[1:22:47] it I've never seen the righteous
[1:22:49] forsaken nor seed begging
[1:22:52] bread restore unto me the Joy of my
[1:22:55] salvation and renew a right Spirit
[1:22:57] within
[1:22:59] me over and over and over I won't say
[1:23:04] his name because he always says it's not
[1:23:06] me not me but my youngest he latched on
[1:23:08] to that song Break Every Chain from this
[1:23:12] last from this weekend when we had
[1:23:13] Services he was in Costco singing there
[1:23:16] is power in the name of Jesus Break
[1:23:21] Every Chain Break Every Chain Break
[1:23:24] Every Every Chain Break Every Chain and
[1:23:27] then he goes into break every chain and
[1:23:28] he never comes back to the name of Jesus
[1:23:30] but he's latched on to it he's in the
[1:23:33] house and he sings Break Every Chain 93
[1:23:37] times why it's become a part of him
[1:23:41] now it's okay to repeat the verses
[1:23:44] church it's okay to repeat the
[1:23:47] scriptures like we said last service
[1:23:50] it's time Satan started getting
[1:23:51] frustrated with our
[1:23:53] tactics no matter what I do she
[1:23:56] says I am the Lord that Health all thy
[1:24:00] diseases no matter what I do he keeps
[1:24:03] believing and he keeps giving me that
[1:24:05] one stupid
[1:24:07] scripture that I can't get around Jesus
[1:24:10] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:24:14] forever it doesn't take the whole book
[1:24:17] but you got to have faith in whatever
[1:24:18] you're holding you got to know it
[1:24:20] belongs to you it's yours it's not
[1:24:23] Brother John
[1:24:25] only it's not sister Amber's only it's
[1:24:28] not brother Merl's only it's mine it's
[1:24:31] my Bible it's my God it's my word and
[1:24:33] I'm a part of it and it's a part of me
[1:24:36] amen become a broken record Break Every
[1:24:40] Chain there's power in the name of
[1:24:43] Jesus brother Bram says this Satan and
[1:24:45] Eden when he first come to attack a
[1:24:47] person knowing the children of God were
[1:24:50] fortified with this word he says Satan
[1:24:52] attacked the word see he never attacked
[1:24:55] the bean he attacked the word first look
[1:24:57] at that sneaker that lizard what he does
[1:24:59] today the first thing he can lay it on
[1:25:01] and say well that's not a good person he
[1:25:03] can't look at us and say you're not good
[1:25:05] people we are good
[1:25:07] people we are good people we have flaws
[1:25:10] we have failures but we are good
[1:25:12] people he says he can't say that that is
[1:25:15] a good person see but the only thing he
[1:25:17] tries to do no matter how good the
[1:25:19] person is is to get them to deny that
[1:25:21] word that's just o only thing he wants
[1:25:24] want to do is get you to deny that word
[1:25:26] so Satan tried to attack the word in the
[1:25:28] Garden of Eden so he had to have
[1:25:30] something now that he could use to the
[1:25:32] human being would look better than that
[1:25:35] word and do you know what he used he
[1:25:38] says reasoning just what we'd say is
[1:25:40] common sense see so that's what he used
[1:25:43] and he succeeded so that's what he's
[1:25:45] used all along but God can't give
[1:25:47] nothing else but his word because that's
[1:25:49] what he chose first and when God makes a
[1:25:51] decision it has to ever remain that way
[1:25:55] he says Satan took reasonings and took
[1:25:57] the reasonings and attacked the word and
[1:25:59] shook Eve off the path by reasonings by
[1:26:01] human reasonings he says now catch this
[1:26:04] church now the only way that he he said
[1:26:07] she got she'd have got to believe God's
[1:26:09] word it had to be
[1:26:14] appealing who's going to take something
[1:26:16] that doesn't look better than what
[1:26:17] they've
[1:26:18] got so if he can't get you to doubt
[1:26:21] straight up he'll get you to lay it down
[1:26:23] because something else looks better he
[1:26:26] says Satan knows how to make reasonings
[1:26:27] appealing it has to appeal to you and
[1:26:30] sin is very appealing and there's only
[1:26:32] one sin and that's unbelief so it's
[1:26:34] really appealing and Satan makes sin so
[1:26:36] appealing to you can I use an example
[1:26:38] this evening think about tithing I can
[1:26:41] use tithing in this church because we
[1:26:42] don't have a problem with
[1:26:45] tithing it's the most generous people I
[1:26:47] know is in this church so let me take
[1:26:50] tithing why do we pay tithes first we
[1:26:53] pay by
[1:26:54] obedience the word tells us to do it
[1:26:57] amen it's a means of supporting the
[1:26:59] ministering of the word of God it's a
[1:27:01] means for helping to have a building in
[1:27:02] these different things and then we also
[1:27:04] pay ties by faith because there's a
[1:27:07] promise that if you'll pour in your ties
[1:27:09] then he'll pour out a blessing that you
[1:27:10] can't contain but eventually we start to
[1:27:13] pay ties by one other thing and that's
[1:27:15] by experience because we know that when
[1:27:17] we pay ties then he gives us our needs
[1:27:20] every single time amen
[1:27:26] somehow
[1:27:27] magically we're still able to make ends
[1:27:30] meat when we give 10 or% 10% or more to
[1:27:33] God you know what people are scared to
[1:27:35] tithe I'm scared not to
[1:27:38] tithe I am genuinely I am why because
[1:27:42] I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:27:44] nor see bacon bread I've been out of
[1:27:46] work I've lost jobs I've I've lost
[1:27:49] golden handcuffs as we've talked about
[1:27:51] before and God has met my need every
[1:27:53] single time doesn't mean it doesn't get
[1:27:56] tight but it means he's met the need
[1:27:59] every single time and so that's why I
[1:28:02] pay ties but listen Common Sense will
[1:28:05] say we're in a cost of living
[1:28:09] crisis we look at our grocery budget and
[1:28:11] it's growing growing growing every
[1:28:15] month Common Sense would say you can pay
[1:28:17] your house off 5 years earlier if you
[1:28:19] don't pay your tie and put it towards
[1:28:21] your house Common Sense would say you
[1:28:23] can can have a vehicle that's newer than
[1:28:25] your newest one which is 11 years old if
[1:28:27] you'll stop paying your ties and put
[1:28:28] that towards a car
[1:28:30] payment common sense says you can go on
[1:28:33] a wonderful vacation every year if you
[1:28:35] don't pay your
[1:28:37] ties common sense says you can get that
[1:28:40] car you've been looking for for forever
[1:28:42] if you don't pay your ties but here's
[1:28:44] the thing I only look at those things if
[1:28:48] I get my eyes off
[1:28:49] Christ amen because those things are the
[1:28:52] lust of the eyes they're the to the
[1:28:54] flesh it has nothing to do with me I am
[1:28:58] content here right now but if I I get my
[1:29:01] eyes off the word and I start looking
[1:29:03] around at what other people have rather
[1:29:05] than what I need then what happens is
[1:29:07] Satan has a common sense way to access
[1:29:09] my
[1:29:12] life but if I can keep my eyes on
[1:29:15] Christ if I can keep my eyes on what
[1:29:17] he's doing in my life and how he's using
[1:29:19] me then I don't care whether I get that
[1:29:22] car furthermore he keeps the car that I
[1:29:25] have I know people that can't drive a
[1:29:27] car eight eight years without it falling
[1:29:29] apart on them and I've got one that's 11
[1:29:31] and another one that's 12 years old and
[1:29:32] they do just fine by God's
[1:29:36] grace why because I'm trusting him I
[1:29:40] don't need to live a lifestyle like
[1:29:41] everyone else I just need to be where he
[1:29:44] wants me doing what he wants me to do
[1:29:45] and he'll take care of the rest he'll
[1:29:48] add everything that I have need of and
[1:29:51] then I find that he gives us more than
[1:29:52] we ask for just by being faithful to
[1:29:55] what he asks us to do that's his promise
[1:29:57] amen that's his
[1:29:59] promise see we want a word result but if
[1:30:01] we do that we've got to give a word
[1:30:02] response first we get what we put we get
[1:30:05] out what we put in what we plant is what
[1:30:07] we s what we reap later amen if we're
[1:30:09] going to sew by Common Sense we're going
[1:30:11] to reap what common sense says which is
[1:30:12] a blessing that's limited by your
[1:30:14] understanding whereas if I can do it
[1:30:16] God's way now it's above and beyond what
[1:30:18] I could ever ask or think that's what
[1:30:20] happens when I go by the word of God
[1:30:23] brother Bram contines
[1:30:24] this is the message how can I overcome
[1:30:26] he says Jesus showed us how it's done
[1:30:28] how did he do it by the word that's how
[1:30:30] he did it for he was the word same thing
[1:30:33] for
[1:30:34] us he says and Jesus said if you abide
[1:30:37] in me and my words in you he says you're
[1:30:39] back to word again the Word of Promise
[1:30:43] when does The Word of Promise come
[1:30:44] church when you abide in
[1:30:48] Christ that word abide means to live
[1:30:51] continuously in his presence
[1:30:55] daily weekly monthly yearly not in his
[1:31:00] presence when I have a need and then
[1:31:01] back out continuously day by day
[1:31:06] abiding living with him living in the
[1:31:08] word day by day he says when you're back
[1:31:11] to word you're back to the word again
[1:31:13] you're back to the Word of Promise he
[1:31:15] says what is the Word of Promise to
[1:31:17] every Christian greater is he that's in
[1:31:19] you than he that's in the world he says
[1:31:22] then how do I overcome not me but the
[1:31:25] word that's in me the word is God then I
[1:31:28] overcome the things of the world because
[1:31:29] it's the word in me if you abide in me
[1:31:32] my words and you then you ask what you
[1:31:33] will just keep pressing up he says
[1:31:36] you're coming to the top as sure as
[1:31:38] anything see you have to come to the top
[1:31:40] he's not saying you have to come to the
[1:31:42] top he's saying if you keep pressing and
[1:31:44] you keep abiding it will bring you to
[1:31:46] the top it's an inevitability not a need
[1:31:49] it's not a must it's not a command he's
[1:31:51] saying the more you press into his
[1:31:53] presence the more you'll get get closer
[1:31:54] to the top and eventually you'll break
[1:31:56] through that's the simple truth of it
[1:32:00] amen when people are struggling with
[1:32:01] situations the first thing I ask them is
[1:32:03] where is your situation in the word of
[1:32:07] God we've talked about this before we
[1:32:09] have people that are going directly to
[1:32:10] prayer rather than the word of God the
[1:32:12] word of God is to give us Faith it's to
[1:32:14] give us a foundation it's to give us
[1:32:16] confidence that when we go before him
[1:32:18] then we can have what we will it's a
[1:32:20] basis for our our requests to God so God
[1:32:23] gives us that word and so the thing is
[1:32:24] will we use the word to find our place
[1:32:27] if we can find the word and find our
[1:32:28] place in the word then we can abide
[1:32:31] there we can rest there we can put our
[1:32:34] feet down there and say I'm not moving
[1:32:36] from this no matter what Satan says no
[1:32:38] matter what common sense says no matter
[1:32:40] what my banker says no matter what this
[1:32:42] one says I'm going to stay right here
[1:32:44] because here's where the word is and
[1:32:45] here's where the promise is it's the
[1:32:47] only place that God can respond to you
[1:32:48] is when you're in the word amen Jesus
[1:32:52] said you got to abide in in the word
[1:32:54] you've got to be living it you've got to
[1:32:55] be breathing it you've got to be
[1:32:56] dwelling in it you got to be saturated
[1:32:58] in it so that it becomes you and you
[1:33:01] become it amen we've got to know we're
[1:33:03] at our post of Duty I can't abide with
[1:33:05] Christ and be out of my post of Duty
[1:33:08] can't do it can't do it because if we
[1:33:10] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:33:12] that means we're walking in his will
[1:33:13] that means we're walking in his way
[1:33:15] we're walking in his Spirit we're
[1:33:16] walking in his word you can't get out of
[1:33:18] your post of Duty if you're walking with
[1:33:20] Christ amen so if I know I'm at my post
[1:33:22] of Duty brother M says when you know
[1:33:24] you're at your post of Duty you can ask
[1:33:26] what you
[1:33:26] will cuz you're at your post of Duty
[1:33:29] you're about the father's business got
[1:33:31] nothing to worry about you can approach
[1:33:32] god with full confidence brother B says
[1:33:35] this we're starting to close he says the
[1:33:36] greatest weapon was ever put in the
[1:33:37] hands of man is the Bible to be backed
[1:33:41] up with the Holy
[1:33:42] Ghost see you can take this only so far
[1:33:46] you can live by this in the in the
[1:33:49] natural and you can be blessed 100% you
[1:33:52] live by this it'll make you a
[1:33:54] citizen but if you receive this it'll
[1:33:57] make you a child of God there's a
[1:34:00] difference the Holy Ghost turns this
[1:34:03] into life that's what it
[1:34:05] does amen he says the greatest weapon
[1:34:08] ever put in the hands of man is the
[1:34:10] Bible to be backed up with the Holy
[1:34:12] Ghost remember what we said for the that
[1:34:14] the sons of God are led by the spirit of
[1:34:16] God he says that Christ died at Calvary
[1:34:18] to free his church from superstitions
[1:34:21] and fear and doubt and trembling amen
[1:34:25] anybody else having some trembling
[1:34:26] moments these days facing some
[1:34:28] difficulties facing some family uh
[1:34:31] genetics facing some some business
[1:34:34] issues facing some family
[1:34:37] issues he says he lives today he rose
[1:34:40] from the dead He's Alive Tonight hear ye
[1:34:43] him we look in the scriptures at the
[1:34:46] seven sons of SAA and we find that they
[1:34:48] were trying to use the Bible without the
[1:34:50] Holy
[1:34:50] Ghost and what happened was they wanted
[1:34:53] what the apostles had they wanted the
[1:34:55] results of the Apostles without the the
[1:34:57] pathway that the apostles had walked and
[1:34:59] so they jumped into a battle that they
[1:35:00] weren't prepared for using a weapon that
[1:35:02] they hadn't been trained on and when we
[1:35:04] look in the scriptures we see what
[1:35:05] happens in Acts 19 it says then certain
[1:35:07] of the Vagabond Jews exorcists took upon
[1:35:11] them to call over them which had evil
[1:35:12] spirits the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:35:14] saying we adure You by Jesus whom Paul
[1:35:17] preacheth and there were seven sons of
[1:35:19] one CA a Jew and chief of the priest
[1:35:22] which did so these were minister
[1:35:27] ministers you know listening to both
[1:35:31] brother Jerry and brother Paul this
[1:35:32] weekend was very so this the weekend
[1:35:34] before was very sobering because how
[1:35:36] many times did they say these were
[1:35:38] message
[1:35:39] Believers amen not all that say Lord
[1:35:44] Lord are
[1:35:47] mine these are what we see here men of
[1:35:50] the cloth of the priesthood sons of
[1:35:55] Levi it says and the evil spirit
[1:35:57] answered and said Jesus I know Paul I
[1:35:59] know but who are
[1:36:01] you and when and the man in whom the
[1:36:03] evil spirit was leaped on them and
[1:36:05] overcame them and prevailed against them
[1:36:08] so that they fled out of that house
[1:36:09] naked and wounded see they had the
[1:36:11] letter of the word but they didn't have
[1:36:12] the spirit to make it live the
[1:36:15] difference was the Holy Ghost not the
[1:36:17] word it was the Holy Ghost to make the
[1:36:19] word work amen they had a good talk they
[1:36:22] had the right pedigree
[1:36:24] maybe good training but in the end that
[1:36:27] Spirit ripped the clothes off them and
[1:36:29] exposed them for everything that they
[1:36:30] were to those people they were trying to
[1:36:33] do something for somebody else that they
[1:36:34] hadn't received themselves yet that's
[1:36:36] what it was they were Bound by a
[1:36:38] religious spirit and they were trying to
[1:36:40] go against their own kingdom and they
[1:36:42] got
[1:36:43] overcome they were in a condition of
[1:36:45] slavy trying to set somebody else free
[1:36:47] it doesn't work they weren't a new
[1:36:48] creation they were just power hungry men
[1:36:50] trying to manipulate the situation man
[1:36:52] we can't win battles by
[1:36:54] association we cannot win a battle
[1:36:56] because we've received an end time
[1:36:58] message because we believe God sent a
[1:36:59] prophet because we believe there's a
[1:37:01] bride that's been called out called out
[1:37:02] of denomination that's not what makes us
[1:37:06] Overcomers that's a pathway to it but
[1:37:09] the Holy Ghost is the only thing that
[1:37:11] will overcome in this age it's the only
[1:37:13] thing that's it that's all we've got
[1:37:16] amen without the Holy Ghost the true
[1:37:18] baptism the sealing of our souls we will
[1:37:20] never win it takes a new heart a new
[1:37:23] spirit and then his Spirit like he said
[1:37:25] in Ezekiel otherwise we can't win the
[1:37:27] battle brother B puts it this way he
[1:37:29] says men and women what we need today is
[1:37:31] not our names on a church book which is
[1:37:34] perfectly all right but we need to pick
[1:37:36] up that powerful weapon of the holy
[1:37:38] spirit in our heart which changes our
[1:37:40] innermost being and makes us new
[1:37:42] creatures in Christ Jesus and then
[1:37:45] swipes the way through the sinful World
[1:37:47] by the righteousness and power of the
[1:37:49] resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:37:51] we need amen
[1:37:54] catch this I love this I cried when I
[1:37:58] read this he says that's what the church
[1:38:00] needs not a facelifting or a bunch of
[1:38:03] new members but to revive what we've
[1:38:09] got revive what we've got not a new
[1:38:13] message not a new doctrine not some new
[1:38:17] revelation just simply make what we've
[1:38:19] got live again that's it he said says
[1:38:23] and fill with the Holy Ghost and set out
[1:38:26] to fight the enemy to pray for the sick
[1:38:28] to heal the sick to cast out Devils
[1:38:30] freely you've receive freely give these
[1:38:32] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:38:34] Christ put into the hand of man the
[1:38:36] strongest weapon that was ever put to
[1:38:38] human beings was the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:41] Spirit a new heart a new spirit and I'll
[1:38:44] put my spirit in there he says and then
[1:38:46] fight with what's in you until death
[1:38:49] shall set you
[1:38:50] free oh I was
[1:38:53] uh brother John Andy there they they're
[1:38:55] doing these little Snippets from from uh
[1:38:58] the services and he he he was talking
[1:39:00] about this and he this idea that we've
[1:39:02] all got to produce the same thing the
[1:39:05] same amount of the same thing if I could
[1:39:06] put it that way but he says it's not
[1:39:08] scriptural he says that remember in the
[1:39:10] Harvest Time when the when the when the
[1:39:13] The Reaping is done then some of the
[1:39:14] plants brought for 30-fold and some 60
[1:39:16] and some 90 he was talking about it from
[1:39:18] a standpoint of engines which really
[1:39:20] resonated with me he says listen you can
[1:39:21] have a little four-cylinder in your car
[1:39:24] and you can go out on the highway he
[1:39:25] says and you put your foot down and
[1:39:27] those four cylinders are just
[1:39:29] going he says but somebody can pull up
[1:39:32] next to you with a V6 or a V8 and they
[1:39:35] can just put their foot halfway down he
[1:39:36] says and they just go right on by you
[1:39:40] effortlessly but I was talking to him
[1:39:42] this afternoon and I said when I heard
[1:39:44] that I said it made me stop and say am I
[1:39:48] using everything he's given me
[1:39:50] then because what can happen is we can
[1:39:52] look around and we can say well I'm
[1:39:54] doing as much as
[1:39:56] anyone therefore I'm doing
[1:39:58] enough but God has given some of us four
[1:40:01] cylinders he's given some of us six he's
[1:40:04] given some of us eight and he's given
[1:40:06] some of us a quad turbo V16 from a
[1:40:11] buatti that's a brother
[1:40:13] brandham but there's levels that he's
[1:40:15] put in there and so often what we do is
[1:40:17] it's this comparative Christianity I've
[1:40:19] talked about many times is we sit there
[1:40:21] and we say well I'm doing as good as him
[1:40:22] or her guess what God may have given you
[1:40:24] more don't stop because you're level
[1:40:26] with them you keep going until he says
[1:40:28] that's
[1:40:29] enough amen keep pushing keep pressing
[1:40:34] because there's other people are
[1:40:35] depending on us to keep moving forward
[1:40:38] amen but you know so
[1:40:41] often again the battle is not usually
[1:40:44] because we think we've got too much
[1:40:45] sometimes it is but so often we sitting
[1:40:47] there and we're saying like a boxer he's
[1:40:49] got more reach he's got more weight he's
[1:40:51] got more speed how am I ever going to
[1:40:53] win this I can't win this
[1:40:56] fight and if we're looking at it from
[1:40:58] our own abilities we're
[1:41:01] right you know we were talking in the
[1:41:02] car on the way over and about her her
[1:41:05] cousin that another or one that had died
[1:41:07] from cancer and these different things
[1:41:08] and I've had different ones talk to me
[1:41:10] about how many people are dying from
[1:41:12] cancer and they're saying where is
[1:41:13] Where's God in
[1:41:15] this who can defeat
[1:41:19] cancer some
[1:41:21] can and I'm not here to say why they can
[1:41:23] or why they can't but I'll say this God
[1:41:26] knows his
[1:41:27] own and God knows the faith that we have
[1:41:30] and God knows the sincerity of our lives
[1:41:32] but in the end the scripture is not
[1:41:34] remember greater are you than he that's
[1:41:36] in the world it's greater as he that's
[1:41:38] in you amen that is the Difference Maker
[1:41:41] is him time and time again and I just
[1:41:43] want to close with this this one
[1:41:45] scripture and then a a quote
[1:41:48] afterwards cuz we look at situations and
[1:41:51] we think I can't do it there is no way
[1:41:54] I'm coming out of this one either with
[1:41:56] my health with my life with my marriage
[1:42:00] with my praise with my worship with my
[1:42:02] sanity look at my mother look at what
[1:42:05] she
[1:42:06] faced and you see today she's got more
[1:42:08] than a lot of women that didn't have all
[1:42:10] the hardship that she had why God can
[1:42:13] take us through the fire
[1:42:16] amen but look at this this is in 2
[1:42:18] Chronicles
[1:42:19] 20 it says now behold the children of
[1:42:22] Ammon and Moab and mount seir whom thou
[1:42:24] wouldest not let Israel invade when they
[1:42:26] came out of the land of Egypt but they
[1:42:28] turned from them and destroyed them not
[1:42:30] so Israel's facing these these children
[1:42:32] of Ammon and Moab and from Mount seir
[1:42:34] God had spared these families when they
[1:42:36] were coming into Canaan so they're not
[1:42:38] in Canaan they're outside of Canaan and
[1:42:41] remember they're going through and God
[1:42:42] spared them because they were children
[1:42:44] of lot who is related to Abraham so it
[1:42:46] was the relationship to Abraham that
[1:42:48] caused God to spare those
[1:42:50] people but now they're causing trouble
[1:42:52] for Abraham
[1:42:55] children and so the king is saying
[1:42:57] behold I say how they reward us to come
[1:42:59] to cast us out of thy possession which
[1:43:01] thou has given us to inherit he's
[1:43:02] talking to God and he's saying listen
[1:43:03] the ones that you spared now are causing
[1:43:05] us issues and he says Oh Our God wilt
[1:43:08] thou not judge them for we have no might
[1:43:11] against this great company we got
[1:43:13] nothing that will stop them we have no
[1:43:15] hope he says that cometh up against us
[1:43:18] neither know we what to do for our eyes
[1:43:20] but our eyes are upon thee
[1:43:24] that's the way to look at the situation
[1:43:27] it's okay to say they're bigger than me
[1:43:30] but notice now their eyes have turned
[1:43:32] from the situation and they've turned to
[1:43:34] God and they say but we're looking to
[1:43:36] you because if we look at the situation
[1:43:39] we look at ourselves we look at them
[1:43:40] there's no victory in looking at the
[1:43:42] situation but we'll look to you for this
[1:43:46] one it says and all Judah stood before
[1:43:50] the Lord they got serious about it
[1:43:54] it says with their little ones their
[1:43:56] wives and their children nobody exempt
[1:43:59] all of Judah came before God it says
[1:44:02] then upon jeziel the son of Zachariah
[1:44:04] the son of beniah the son of Ja the son
[1:44:07] of mattaniah a levite of the sons of
[1:44:09] Asaf came the spirit of the Lord in the
[1:44:11] midst of the congregation and he said
[1:44:13] hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants
[1:44:16] of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat
[1:44:18] now I want you to catch this church he
[1:44:21] doesn't say mommies and daddies
[1:44:24] cuz who's there from the oldest to the
[1:44:27] youngest is in his
[1:44:29] presence from the little ones to the
[1:44:31] children to the parents to the
[1:44:33] grandparents the Le the ministry the
[1:44:36] Kings the Common People everyone's
[1:44:39] there and he says hearken to me every
[1:44:41] single one of you this is for
[1:44:44] everyone he says thus saith the Lord
[1:44:48] unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by
[1:44:52] reason of the this great multitude for
[1:44:54] the battle is not yours but God's
[1:44:57] Hallelujah every single one from the
[1:45:00] smallest to the oldest this battle is
[1:45:01] not yours it belongs to God he says
[1:45:04] tomorrow you shall go down against them
[1:45:06] you're still going to have to be there
[1:45:08] you will be present for this battle
[1:45:11] behold they come up by the Cliff of ziz
[1:45:13] and you shall find them at the end of
[1:45:15] the brook before the Wilderness of jeru
[1:45:17] he's telling them how this is going to
[1:45:18] play out but he says ye shall not need
[1:45:21] to fight in this battle attle you're
[1:45:23] going to be there but you're not going
[1:45:25] to have to fight you'll be present to
[1:45:28] see the power and demonstration of God
[1:45:31] he says set yourselves and do what stand
[1:45:36] ye still and see the salvation of the
[1:45:40] Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem
[1:45:43] fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out
[1:45:47] against them for the Lord shall be with
[1:45:49] you I love that so much ye shall not
[1:45:53] need to fight in this
[1:45:56] battle Oh Brother John we need to mature
[1:45:59] so much we need to get no no no we need
[1:46:02] to recognize the battle as
[1:46:04] his we'll be
[1:46:06] there remember what brother Brandon
[1:46:08] would say he says I was just there I
[1:46:12] just happened to be there when the angel
[1:46:13] did it just a vessel a yielded
[1:46:18] vessel just a a person that was so
[1:46:21] yielded to the spirit that the Spirit
[1:46:23] could do more than that vessel ever
[1:46:24] could in of itself that's all we'll be
[1:46:27] there but it'll be him that's winning
[1:46:29] the battle
[1:46:30] amen why it's not our battle it's his
[1:46:33] battle we're the Sheep of his Shepherd
[1:46:36] of his pasture we the apple of his eye
[1:46:39] were his chosen children were his elect
[1:46:41] bride we engraved in the palms of his
[1:46:45] hands we're special to him he protects
[1:46:48] us he cares for us brother Brown would
[1:46:51] say this as we are truly closed
[1:46:54] he says and that's the way it is
[1:46:57] anything as long as you're going to do
[1:46:59] it if someone talks about you and you
[1:47:02] talk back about them God can't fight
[1:47:04] your battles you're fighting it
[1:47:07] yourself he says
[1:47:09] see now you say well that's about
[1:47:11] talking back no this goes for any
[1:47:13] battle he says see just let loose and
[1:47:16] let him do it and just commit it to him
[1:47:19] the greatest weapon that I know of of a
[1:47:22] Christian today is a committal to God
[1:47:25] when you can't do nothing about it just
[1:47:28] commit it to him and God will take care
[1:47:32] of it see sometimes this is the problem
[1:47:36] I want to dig into this just for a
[1:47:37] moment are we okay five minutes he says
[1:47:41] just he says when when you realize he
[1:47:44] says that you can't do nothing about it
[1:47:47] just commit it to him see we think what
[1:47:49] that means is that I do everything I can
[1:47:52] and then I realize it's not working and
[1:47:54] then I commit it to him that's not what
[1:47:57] he's
[1:47:58] saying he's saying commit it to him
[1:48:00] because you know it doesn't matter what
[1:48:02] you
[1:48:03] do commit it to him up front and then
[1:48:06] say lord it's in your hands and then
[1:48:08] you're just walking through and letting
[1:48:10] him work the situation out if he wants
[1:48:13] you to talk he'll give you the words if
[1:48:15] he wants you to be quiet he'll zip your
[1:48:17] lip if he wants you to be kind he'll ask
[1:48:19] you to be kind if he wants you to be
[1:48:21] upfront he'll get you to be upfront
[1:48:23] if he wants you to engage he'll get you
[1:48:24] to engage if he wants you to pull back
[1:48:26] he'll get you to pull back it's
[1:48:27] committing it to him before you do
[1:48:29] anything that he's talking about he's
[1:48:31] going to use us we are his hands and
[1:48:33] feet we're his mouth he uses us but the
[1:48:36] key is to commit it to him and say Lord
[1:48:39] I know that I'm just going to mess this
[1:48:40] situation
[1:48:42] up listen I can't even sort my own life
[1:48:45] out how in the world am I going to sort
[1:48:46] somebody else's out without
[1:48:48] him we don't see the root of the issue
[1:48:51] that's what the word does the word is a
[1:48:53] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:48:54] the heart it goes down to the motives
[1:48:56] and objectives it gets down to the root
[1:48:58] of these things amen so he's saying
[1:49:00] you've got to understand that the
[1:49:01] victory comes when you say I can't get
[1:49:03] the victory myself and so Lord I'm
[1:49:06] committing it to you I'm placing it into
[1:49:08] your hands from the start and I'll Trust
[1:49:10] you the rest of the way through and then
[1:49:12] we do what we walk in faith in
[1:49:15] confidence that we are walking with him
[1:49:18] that's it that's
[1:49:21] it he says when you you know you can't
[1:49:23] do nothing about it just commit it to
[1:49:25] him and that's really the start of
[1:49:26] Victory is to realize it's not by me
[1:49:28] it's going to happen as in anything I
[1:49:30] bring to the table we're going to talk a
[1:49:32] lot more about this on on Sunday mean
[1:49:35] amen but we're not in the battle to
[1:49:36] prove ourselves we're not in a battle to
[1:49:39] be right we're here for Souls Jesus the
[1:49:42] Great Commission was go you into all the
[1:49:43] world and preach the gospel he's looking
[1:49:46] for seed he's looking for souls and so
[1:49:49] if we're about that then it's got to be
[1:49:50] about him in the first place I'm not
[1:49:52] drawing people to me I've got to draw
[1:49:54] people to him I can't Point them to me
[1:49:56] I've got to point them to them to him
[1:49:58] I'm not we're not here to to to to build
[1:50:00] big churches and have big programs and
[1:50:02] and do big television Ministries and and
[1:50:04] get worldwide Fame no we're here to do
[1:50:07] his will and it's just a select few that
[1:50:10] we're going to find it's always been
[1:50:12] that way amen I can't do it on my own
[1:50:15] you can't do it on your own this
[1:50:17] committal to God is the greatest weapon
[1:50:19] he says you have in your Arsenal is to
[1:50:21] give it to God from the start rather
[1:50:23] than wait until it spirals out of
[1:50:26] control and we've got it all tangled up
[1:50:28] like spaghetti and then we say I may
[1:50:30] need some help here amen anybody else
[1:50:33] ever done
[1:50:35] that where we get so deep into it that
[1:50:38] we just make a hash out of it and then
[1:50:39] we say I guess I should have invited God
[1:50:41] into this Lord can you help me out and
[1:50:44] you know what he's gracious enough to
[1:50:45] come in and undo all of the mess of the
[1:50:47] spaghetti that we've made but I'm
[1:50:49] learning more and more invite him in at
[1:50:51] the beginning
[1:50:53] then you got some real confidence in it
[1:50:54] amen let's stand together if we would
[1:50:57] you know we don't have time to go into
[1:50:58] the rest of that story but you'll see
[1:51:00] what happens is they don't go out to war
[1:51:05] and and they don't go out with a glum
[1:51:08] face you know with with Dread in their
[1:51:11] heart of oh I've got to face this trial
[1:51:14] they walked out and they walked out with
[1:51:16] the praise and worship band at the front
[1:51:18] of the army they walked out knowing that
[1:51:21] the victory was coming
[1:51:23] knowing there was a battle that was
[1:51:24] going to happen but that there was
[1:51:25] Victory ahead and so they walked out and
[1:51:28] they put the the the the Priestly
[1:51:30] worshippers in front and then they walk
[1:51:33] behind and they literally walk to battle
[1:51:35] giving a testimony of the outcome before
[1:51:37] it ever happened amen that's what
[1:51:40] happens when we commit it to him when we
[1:51:43] take him at his word and we walk with
[1:51:45] him and we say Lord we're trusting you
[1:51:48] we can walk into the battle with Victory
[1:51:51] on our mind vict on our lips and praise
[1:51:54] and worship in our hearts because we
[1:51:56] know we're walking in his will amen amen
[1:51:59] God help us to see let's bow our heads
[1:52:02] Heavenly
[1:52:04] Father Lord what kind of faith is it
[1:52:06] when we can give a testimony of Victory
[1:52:08] before the battle's even started before
[1:52:11] the battle's even over lord God but Lord
[1:52:13] as that song says we've read the back of
[1:52:15] the book and we win Lord we see a clear
[1:52:18] path we see a finished work Lord and
[1:52:20] though we can't see every step and every
[1:52:22] portion of the journey Lord we know that

[1:56:58] you can remind yourself when you can
[1:57:00] remind Satan of where he's standing and
[1:57:02] where you're standing because if you're
[1:57:04] standing on the word he can't be
[1:57:05] contrary to it and have any
[1:57:07] Authority find your place in the word
[1:57:10] find your promise in the word and from
[1:57:12] there build Faith with it and use that
[1:57:14] as a weapon if you can find five
[1:57:17] scriptures do that but go in and find
[1:57:20] your place in the word and then you

[2:05:33] at the end we have little victories in
[2:05:36] our life as we progress towards a
[2:05:38] resurrection and a Rapture but sometimes
[2:05:40] the victory that you don't realize is
[2:05:41] that you're still here you're still
[2:05:43] standing you're still believing against
[2:05:46] all hope and against all uh outer
[2:05:48] evidence maybe sometimes and yet we stay
[2:05:50] here and we believe and we believe and

[2:05:59] that's Victory cuz so many people just
[2:06:01] lay down and just let it go but there's
