[music] [music] We come to [music] you every morning. to [music] every [music] [music] morning. Bless us our hearts. Hallelujah. Oh heavenly father and oh God, Lord God, we are grateful for tonight for the gathering together for your children Lord God around your table Lord God to feast from your hands one more time Lord. Oh God we humble our hearts to you Lord God and we we say thank you Lord God for life. We thank you Lord God for the ability to respond to your word Lord God. And we thank you Lord God for the grace that you have brought upon us Lord. Oh God we recognize ourself in your presence that we are nothing Lord God. That that we can do nothing of oursel Lord God but in total dependence Lord God. We are trusting in your hands, Lord God, that you will come, Lord God, and take our fa frame vessel, Lord God, our feeble effort, Lord, and and that, Lord God, you will bless us, your people, Lord God. And and so God, Lord God, for all the needs that are gathered tonight, Lord, this evening, we ask for your blessing, oh God, upon your children, Lord God. And may God, the experiences that, Lord God, will bring you closer to us, Lord God. And as we reconcile, Lord God, may may you bless us, Lord God. And may you keep us, Lord God. And may our hearts, Lord God, find comfort and refuge in you, Lord. Help us, Lord God. And may, oh God, as we present, Lord God, every sick this evening and all the, oh God, the requestes that are made, Lord God, may you just bless your people, Lord God. And may you be a father, Lord God, to the fatherless, Lord God, a a healer, Lord God, to the sick, Lord God, and a provider to them, oh God, who are in need tonight, Lord. Grant your mercies, Lord God, as we humble our hearts to you. And we say thanks in Jesus Christ's precious name. And we say, "Amen." Praise God. I'm saying, "God, good." Thank you, the Lord. one more time to be here in his presence. Amen. Standing humbly before the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. And also um you know we are grateful for the prayers that have been met for our brethren there in Jamaica. You know for the needs that are there. You know, I spoke with one of the pastor this morning, this evening rather, and you know, they are in the process of putting things together. You know, they are doing a lot of repairing stuff like that. But we pray God's grace upon their lives. Amen. Tonight, we like to turn our Bibles to the book of 1 Corinthians 2. We like to continue on the thought that we had that we were speaking on the last time, you know, but I like how brother Mark will use the word. He said there's so many layers. So we layer it one and then we layer it. So we we're building something. Amen. So that we would like to do that tonight. So let us read 1 Corinthian 2 beginning reading from verse 12. And the topic is the realities of God. We want to look at that really. And it read thus now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things. Yay, he himself is judge of no man. For who knoweth the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him, but we have the mind of Christ. You may be seated tonight. Amen. You know, I I particular choose this topic because I believe that God is bringing us into real experiences, real Christian experiences really. And you know, um it is taking us just from living a mortal life. You know, we are subjected to this mortal life by reason of birth. But I believe you know the the the the the work of the Holy Spirit is to bring us alive to something real you know and I believe that is what you know we are heading into that's what the Bible the scripture is coming alive it's it's feeling more real than before and you know and as we try to find words to express these things really you know the last time we were here and that we looked on the the the quote brother spoke of the the eternal thoughts of God and I like to speak from that really because you know he speaks of those eternal thoughts you know that they're real and you know and so if we can see the realities of God's eternal thought he said the eternal thoughts of God he said let me ask are the thoughts of God eternal he said if you can see this you will see many things he that God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior. We have studied that and proven that already. God is infinite in his abilities. So therefore he as God must be omnisient. He said if he's omnisient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding any adding to his knowledge. He said if he can add to his knowledge then he's not obnisscent. He said the best we can say is that something he will be. He said but that is not scriptural. He said he is omnisient. He said he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thought that he had always had and always will have and said and know the hand from the beginning because he is God. He said thus the thoughts of God are eternal. They are real. Amen. He said they are not simply like a man with a blueprint. And the blueprint is you know the thought of drafting something really. But he said it's not like a man with a blueprint. He had to draw up and which one day will be translated into substance and form. But he said they are already real and eternal and a part of God. And you know he made reference to Abraham. He said God had God always had his thought of ab of Adam and he said and his thoughts was yet unexpressed. You know church when we see that really you know brother spoke of you know God and and the Bible speak of it really he said and God is a spirit. We speak we see the Bible speaks of it when he said the spirit of God and said that the spirit of God he spoke he said it's like an eternal fountain and you know it's it's like using words to express it really you know but he said like a a a fountain of of and when you think about a fountain you think about a spring that that springs up and and and and it keep on going and going and going where he said it's a fountain of life a fountain of eternal life it it never starts nor does it end it keep on flowing. So it's it's a fountain. It's a is an unending flow of life. God is life. Are you there, church? And hallelujah. And this life, brother Mark, is eternal life. Hal, it's an unending flow. It is an unending ending flow of eternal life. Hallelujah. And so we saw, BROTHER BAM SAID THAT ALL THAT GOD WAS, HE POURED it into Christ. HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT GOD WAS DOING, CHURCH, HALLELUJAH, HE WAS BRINGING THE LIFE, HALLELUJAH, INTO MANIFESTATION. BECAUSE OUTSIDE OF GOD revealing himself, UH, HALLELUJAH, IN A FORM THAT HE could be understood, THE LIFE OF GOD COULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD. AND SO WHAT HE DID, HALLELUJAH, AS WE GO OVER THESE THINGS, HALLELUJAH, what he did, HE BROUGHT HIMSELF IN A VISIBLE FORM, HALLELUJAH, CALL the logos of the word of God. THE WORD OF GOD IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE LIFE OF GOD. ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Hal. So we say that Christ is the visible PART CALLED THE SON OF GOD. Now you see that the father that you know in the denominational world when they speak of the SON OF GOD HALLELUJAH THEY BELIEVE THAT GOD HAD A SON BUT THE SUNSHIP OF GOD IS NOT ANOTHER GOD BUT THE SUNSHIP OF GOD SPEAKS OF THE EXPRESSION OF GOD becoming visible. Hallelujah. Are you WITH ME CHURCH? AND SO WE COULD LOOK UPON GOD IN THAT VISIBLE PART CALLED THE SUNSHIP of God. So the sunship uh the son of God is NOT ANOTHER GOD. IT'S GOD in a visible form. But what did he do church? HALLELUJAH. GOD WAS REVEALING THE LIFE. HALLELUJAH. That's where we we are going tonight. We need to see the life BECAUSE HALLELUJAH. THE LIFE IS REALITY. ARE you there church? It's real. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. So the the lifeuh hallelujah this fountain of LIFE WAS POURED was revealed into a body. He was IMMORAL IN A BODILY FORM. HAL IT WAS MADE KNOWN in a bodily form. Hallelujah. Praise God. And so John in 1 John 5 and verse one hallelujah. Hallelujah. The Bible said, "If we receive the witness of man, THE WITNESS OF GOD IS GREATER. For this is the witness of God which he had a testify of his son." Now, this is GOD'S TESTIMONY OF HIS SON. HALLELUJAH. This is his testimony. He said, "He that believeth on the son of God has the witness in himself that and it said he that believeth not on the son of God, hallelujah, that made him a liar because he believeth not THE RECORD THAT GOD GAVE OF HIS SON." It said, "And this is the record." Oh my. HALLELUJAH. THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US ETERNAL LIFE. And this eternal life is in the sun. HALLELUJAH. POINTING TO THE WORD OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. THAT THERE'S LIFE IN THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT JUST DEAD LETTERS, BUT LIFE. GOD'S OWN LIFE IS IN THE WORD. And the word IS GOD. ARE YOU BEAR WITH ME, CHURCH? AND SO GOD BEAR RECORD, HALLELUJAH, OF THE WORD THAT THE WORD, HALLELUJAH, HAS ETERNAL LIFE. WHOSE ETERNAL LIFE? GOD'S OWN LIFE IS IN HIS WORD. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? AND SO THE WORD WE DO NOT SAY WORDS OF DEAD LETTERS, BROTHER MARK, BUT WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE. IT'S AN UNENDING FLOW OF LIFE that proceeded out of the word. Hallelu. No wonder Jesus said, "Search [screaming] the scripture, for in THEM YOU THINK YOU HAVE LIFE AND THEY OF WHICH testify of me." Hallelujah. The word of life. The scripture said, "Allelujah." Verse 11. And this is the record that God has given unto us eternal life. And this life is in his son. He that has the son has life. He that has not the son of God has not life. Hallelujah. These things have I written unto you that that believe on the name of the son of God that he may know. Hallelujah. That he have eternal life and that he may believe on the name of the son of God. Hallelujah. Praise God. We go down to to verse 18 there and it said, "For we know that whosoever is born of God sinn it not because that he is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that which and that wicked [snorts] one toucheth him not." Verse 19 he said and we know that we are of God and the whole world light in wickedness and we know and you you watch that scripture you watch that word it is saying that and you know and and you know it hallelujah it is now a CALL TO CONSCIOUSNESS hallelujah that if you are of God if you belong to God HALLELUJAH THEN THE LIFE THAT IS IN GOD HAL IS ALSO in you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We get there as we go on. It says, "And we know that the son of God is come and has given us an understanding that we may know him." That is true. And that we are in him. That is true. even in his son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. And so the Bible said in verse 21, little children, keep yourself from idols. Hallelujah. So Jesus Christ is the true God &gt;&gt; and the true eternal life. But remember, hallelujah, this life is an expression. Hallelujah. It is God pouring that life. Hallelujah. From a thought into a word. Are you there with me, church? And so, Hallelujah. And so, when when it when he became the word, hallelujah, all that God was was poured out into the word. Are you there, the church? And so, the word is the expression of God. Hallelujah. Praise God. You go with me as we travel tonight. Hallelujah. Amen. So, brother said, "So when Adam was form of the dust of the earth and his spirit being created by God, then Adam become a thought expressed and those eternal thoughts were not were not manifested." and said, "And down through the centuries we could go, we find Moses and Jeremiah and John the Baptist, and each one of these were God's eternal thoughts expressed in its season." He said, "Then we come to Jesus the logos." Hallelujah. And that's what brother expressed him. Hallelujah. He said, "Jesus the logos." Hallelujah. He said he was the perfect complete thought expressed and he became known as the word of God and that what he is and forever will be. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But all of this church is an expression of God. Hallelujah. God bringing forth that eternal life. Hallelujah. bringing the life into a person into a being. Hal into an expression. Hallelujah. The Bible said in first John 1 of St. John 1. Hallelujah. Actually this is first John one is that that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our eyes have handled the word of life. Hallelujah. That's the son of God church. Hallelujah. For the life was made manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the father, and was manifested unto us. Hallelujah. You see, I want you to understand what I'm trying to show you, church. HALLELUJAH. THAT WHEN THE LIFE H IS MADE EXPRESSED, HALLELUJAH. It brings forth had substance. It brings forth material. It bring for something that you can look upon. ARE YOU GETTING ME CHURCH? SO IT'S GOD IS NOT JUST UP THERE SOMEWHERE BUT [screaming] GOD CONSTANTLY UNVEILING HIMSELF. HELLO AND becoming substance and and unveiling and unveiling. ARE YOU THERE me church? But how is he doing it? HE'S DOING IT BY HIS WORD. HALLELUJAH. THE WORD OF GOD holds the mystery. The whole of the word of GOD EXPRESSES GOD the life. HALLELUJAH. THE LIFE unveiling God to us. Hallelujah. And so we see that Christ is the word of God. That was the logos that went out of God called the son of God. Hallelujah. The word of God is a person, an eternal being. Hallelujah. That is settled in heaven. Hallelujah. Now church, the Bible said the word is already settled in heaven. Hallelujah. AND SO ALL THAT GOD IS, ALL THAT ETERNAL THOUGHT, HAL, IT'S ALREADY SETTLED. I wish I could show it to you church. It's like, hallelujah. It's like a book and you have ALL THE CHAPTERS BEFORE YOU AND YOU CAN SEE EVERY PIN, everything that needs to happen, EVERYTHING THAT WILL HAPPEN, IT'S ALREADY THERE. There's no new thought. Are you there with me, church? It's already finished. Hallelujah. So in in this dimension, WE'RE WONDERING, WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER DIMENSION SOMEWHERE. HALLELUJAH. WE ALL IS PERFECT UH BY THE WORD OF GOD. Are you there MY ME CHURCH? THERE'S NOT ONE SICK THERE. THERE'S NOT ONE SIN THERE. THERE'S NOTHING UH BUT THE WORD OF God in its perfect form. ARE YOU THERE MY CHURCH? WHY? BECAUSE IT COMES FROM A perfect source. UH A PERFECT LIFE A PERFECT GOD. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So the word is already settled. It's already done. Hallelujah. In heaven. But now church, hallelujah. That word that is already settled, HALLELUJAH. GOD IS BRINGING that life, hallelujah, into manifestation. In other words, he's pouring out himself, uh, unveiling more of himself to you and I. Hallelujah. But who holds that mystery? Hallelujah. I'm going somewhere. I want you to go WITH ME TONIGHT. WHERE that mystery holds? It is held in the word. Hallelujah. And the word is not just dead letters, church. But the word is a living reality. Hallelujah. A living reality. Hallelujah. And so brother said, Hallelujah. We are living now as we are. Brother Mark, we're living in the shadows of our reality. Hallelujah. Brother Adam said because everything that got to have darkness in it, he said to make a shadow. See, because the shadow has got to possess so much darkness and so much light to make a shadow and it can't be alltogether dark. And it can't be allto together light. It's a if this dark, it's a it's real dark. It's if this light, there's no shadow. Hallelujah. It said nothing can make a shadow. But if it's mixed with dark and light, it make a shadow. Hallelujah. He said, "So we are really shadows of light." Hallelujah. In reference, hallelujah. TO THE LIFE. HALLELUJAH. The life THAT WE'RE LIVING. HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT A LIFE that reflects IN TOTALITY OF THE LIFE OF THE WORD, BUT WE ARE LIVING THE SHADOW OF A LIFE. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? WHY? BECAUSE IN THIS LIFE, BROTHER MARK, WE'RE STILL SICK. WE'RE STILL HUNGRY. WE STILL ARE SUBJECTED. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? BUT BROTHER BAM SAID, HALLELUJAH. And why? He said when you see a TREE HERE, HALLELUJAH, SUFFERING AND SICK, HE SAID THERE'S ANOTHER TREE SOMEWHERE THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? SO WE ARE LIVING A SHADOW AT ONE TIME BUT SAID THIS LIFE IS A SHADOW OF A SHADOW UP A SHADOW OF A SHADOW. IT'S WAY BEYOND the reality. BUT God promised church that he's going to take US BACK TO THE REALITY. HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS THE REALITY? THE REALITY IS LIFE. REAL LIFE WITHOUT SHADOW, WITHOUT SICKNESS, without subjectivities. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HE'S CALLING US BACK TO THE LIFE BY THE WORD. SO YOU GOT TO GET TO THE WORD TO GET TO THE LIFE BECAUSE THERE'S LIFE IN THE WORD, ETERNAL LIFE. HALLELUJAH. So we are really a shadow of light. And we are reflecting life from somewhere. If you are a Christian that this being a shadow, it's only prove there's a life somewhere. Hallelujah. Where you can't die. Come on. Because this life has got death in it. It's a sea, but it's a shadow. Because you are you're a living moving creature with abilities to to see to think to move to talk and that the five senses of the body. BUT YET YOU know that there they are dying and there's so much trouble. You know it can't only be it's a it's a reflection. that there's a life and death mixed together. That's now. Hallelujah. Life and death mixed together. But he said the physical has to die. But if you are reflecting but your mortal life, the light of heaven, it said then you're reflecting THE ETERNAL LIFE IS a is a God. Then when you die, you go no more than go to that light because what you are reflecting. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Church, our eternal life starts here and now. Are you there me church? We when you receive that new birth, you receive eternal life in your soul. HALLELUJAH. AND EVERY NOW AND then you feel that that hunching of of another world calling you. Hallelujah. What is happening to you? Is God want to change your experience? He want TO TAKE YOU OUT OF JUST LIVING INTO THE THE BONDAGE OF THE SUBJECTIVE LIFE. UH BUT HE WANT TO TAKE YOU OUT INTO THE REALITY OF A LIFE SOMEWHERE BEYOND THIS LIFE. HALLELUJAH. AND SO WHILE WE LIVE IN THE SHADOWS, HALLELUJAH. WELL, THESE BODIES FEEL THEY ARE FRAIL AND AND THEY'RE FAILING. WHILE THE NEEDS arising and all of these things, BUT THE REALITY IS THAT SOMETHING HAS COME ALIVE IN OUR HEARTS BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. HALLELUJAH. WHY? PAUL SAID, HALLELUJAH. IN THE DAY WHEN YOU HEARD THE GOSPEL, HALLELUJAH, HE EVEN THE GOSPEL OF YOUR SALVATION, YOU ARE SEALED AFTER YOU BELIEVE. YOU ARE SEALED WITH THE HOLY GHOST of promise. Are you there me church? AND SO WHEN YOU ARE SEALED, [screaming] GOD SEALS ETERNAL LIFE ON THE INSIDE. AND SO IN THIS BODIES, WE ARE FIGHTING, WE ARE FAIL, WE ARE SICK AND ALL OF THESE THINGS. UH BUT IN OUR SOUL THERE'S A PEACEUH HALLELUJAH. IN KNOWING THAT GOD IS MY HEALER, GOD IS MY SAVIOR. GOD IS MY PROVIDER. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. AND SO WE REST assured upon the perfect word of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. So we see that the life hallelujah God was bringing this life his own life to you and I. What we need church is not more of mortal life is not more of mortal experiences. What we need is more of God. MORE OF THE EXPERIENCES BY HIS WORD. Are you there church? We what we need, hallelujah, is to come in contact with SOMETHING THAT IS BEYOND THE HAL THIS MORTAL sense and something that brings us into a into INTO AN ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT RAISES UPH INTO THE UNTHINKABLE into the impossible. Hallelujah. But I have news for you tonight. UH HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT GOD IS DOING. GOD IS CHANGING OUR EXPERIENCES. GOD IS TAKING US FROM THIS MORTAL AS BROTHER MAROS use it is the word the eternal part. HALLELUJAH. WHAT'S THIS CHURCH? IT'S LIFE. HALLELUJAH. AND THE LIFE IS THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. IN OTHER WORD WHAT GOD IS DOING, GOD IS TAKING US back to the word of God. Hallelujah. Now you hear what I'm saying to you tonight. Hallelujah. I feel like I'm doing teaching, not preaching tonight, but you hear me. Hallelujah. But what God is doing, church, you see, when we speak of the word, so we there's no there's no there's no thought in our mind. There's no question in our thought as who the word of God is. Hallelujah. The word of God, HALLELUJAH, IS GOD MADE EXPRESSED. Is the eternal life that is made express. And we say THAT THAT WORD IS ALREADY settled in heaven. But when we SPEAK OF THE WORD, WE SPEAK OF THE WORD IN two context. We speak of the word hal in its longest form. HALLELUJAH. NOW IN THE LONGEST FORM, HALLELUJAH, IT'S already settled in heaven. And we speak of the word in its remma form. We're going to get into that tonight. The logus word and the rema word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Bam said in the message. Hallelujah. The Lamb's book of life. It said the Bible, it said your names were written in the Lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. Do you believe that tonight, church? Hallelujah. He said, "Oh my." The same time THAT CHRIST THAT GOD SAID CHRIST WOULD BE SLAIN, he wrote your name with his. He said, "Hallelujah." Said, "There you are. Your name was written him." He said, "And he and he said, and he deceived all, great, small, so so much were." He said so many were church members and pretended Christian. He deceived all whose name were not written not in the book in the church book. He said in the lamb's book of life. He said when before the foundation of the world, God wrote your name in the lamb's book of life by his spoken word. And he said, "And he sent Christ the sacrifice to buy it to redeem the same group that he had wrote their names in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world." Hallelujah. Are you there, the church? AND SO YOUR NAMES WERE WRITTEN, HALLELUJAH, in heaven, IN THE BOOK OF LIFE. UH, IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. HAL YOUR LIFE, CHURCH. BETTER MARK. YOUR LIFE DIDN'T START when you came here, BUT YOUR LIFE STARTED SOMEWHERE. YOU JUST HAD TO HAVE not come into THE RECOGNITION. HALLELUJAH. AS YET, BUT ONE DAY YOU'RE GOING TO COME INTO THAT RECOGNITION. HALLELUJAH. WHERE YOU STARTED. HALLELUJAH. YOU DIDN'T STARTED WHEN YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER CAME TOGETHER, BUT YOU STARTED IN THE LOGOS WORD. ARE YOU THERE WITH ME, CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. IT mean hallelujah. Praise God. HALLELUJAH. THAT IF GOD POUR ETERNAL LIFE IN THE WORLD AND YOU ARE PART OF THAT WORLD, IT MEAN THAT THERE'S SOME PART OF YOU THAT ALREADY HAVE eternal life. You have representation of predestination. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SO IN THE LOGOS SOMEWHERE, HALLELUJAH. BEYOND THIS MORTAL LIFE. HALLELUJAH. ALL THINGS PERTAINTH TO YOU. IT'S ALREADY SETTLED. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? IT'S ALL OVER. It's finished. It's done. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SO, IN THE LOGOS, IT'S DONE. IT'S FINISHED TO THE HIGHEST OF GOD. IT'S OVER. Oh my. Hallelujah. Because God wrote your name in the Lamb's book of life. Hallelujah. And you won't find Garfield Grant as in prescribed earthly name. But what is there is the revelation concerning you. In other word, hallelujah. Hallelujah. THE EXPERIENCE CONCERNING YOUR LIFE. Just like this mortal life. It's a life, but it's mortal life. It has a BEGINNING AND IT HAS AN END. Are you there, my church? BUT THERE'S ANOTHER LIFE. I I must want TO TELL YOU THAT THERE'S ANOTHER YOU SOMEWHERE. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. THAT IS PERFECT. HALLELUJAH. BROTHER M. THERE'S THERE'S ANOTHER YOU SOMEWHERE. HALLELUJAH. THAT STANDS BEFORE GOD BETWEEN 18 AND 21. YOUNG IN YOUR YOUTHFUL, BUT THERE'S NO GRAY HAIR THERE, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT. It's all perfect according to the WORD OF GOD. ARE you there in THE CHURCH? I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU. HALLELUJAH. THAT THE SMARTER LIFE IS A SHADOW, BUT THERE'S ETERNAL LIFE. That you, Hallelujah, that if you have eternal life, now you always had eternal life. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. [screaming] AND SO, HALLELUJAH. THE DARKNESS THAT COME THAT HOLD YOU CAPTIVE AS PRISON. HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE LIGHT COMES HOME, IT wakes you up. Hallelujah. It points YOU TO WHO YOU are and it cannot hold you. It cannot keep you in this position. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Remember what they did with Jesus? They put a Roman seal upon the tomb. Think that will HOLD HIM. A CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. WHEN LIFE COMES ON THE SCENE, WHAT IT DOES TO IT brings forth a resurrection. THERE'S [screaming] POWER IN THE WORD OF GOD. POWER TO CHANGE CIRCUMSTANCES. Are you there, CHURCH? IT CHANGED THE HARD of things. HALLELUJAH. THIS POWER IN GOD'S WORD. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. So in the logos, it's already done. It's already finished. It's already over. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. M and so first John 5 and verse 19 it says that we may know that we are THE SON OF GOD. THAT'S WHAT IT IS CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. IT'S A REALIZATION. THAT'S what it is. That's all THIS PREACHING IS ALL ABOUT IS GETTING YOU TO REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE IF YOU HAVE THE SON. AND ONE DAY IT'S LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING IN A MIRROR AND YOU'RE SEEING AN OBJECT and and little by little it's getting clearer AND CLEARER AND THE VISION IS GETTING CLEARER AND YOU'RE SEEING HALLELUJAH AND THE MORE YOU SEE THE MORE you become. Are you there me church? Because when you see IT YOU STEP RIGHT INTO IT. HALLELUJAH. And it becomes your experience. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. John said that we may know that we are of God and the whole world light in wickedness. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. that we may know that we are sons of God. Hallelujah. Church, listen. As much as we lived in this mortal life, h but there's a reality somewhere that is calling us back to eternal life. Are you there me church? And it's not your responsibility. ALL WE WE asked to do is just to believe. BUT BUT GOD SAID HALLELUJAH THAT HE'S GOING TO RESTORE YOU. THAT'S GOD'S RESPONSIBILITY. If God said I'm going to HEAL YOU, THAT'S GOD'S RESPONSIBILITY. WHY? BECAUSE GOD SAID WHEN I SAY IT OUT OF MY MOUTH, IT WILL NOT RETURN TO ME VOID, BUT IT WILL ACCOMPLISH AFTER those things that I've said it for. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. And so we see the Bible speaks of A PRODIGAL SON, BROTHER MARK. HALLELUJAH. This prodigal son, WE KNOW THE STORY QUITE WELL. HALLELUJAH. That he was HE HE WAS BORN, HALLELUJAH, IN A LINEAGE, HALLELUJAH, of of a very wealthy, rich, hallelujah, leader. AND SO HOW HE FOUND HIMSELF, HALLELUJAH, INTO A POSITION, HALLELUJAH, WHERE HE WENT TO HIS FATHER AND HE SAID, "FATHER, GIVE ME MY INHERITANCE." HALLELUJAH. I WANT THEM, I want to receive it now. But let me say this to you tonight, church. You see, WE KNOW THE STORY AS THE PRODIGAL SON. BUT BEFORE HE WAS A PRODIGAL SON, he was a son. Are you there with me church? Before he found himself, hallelujah, eating swine food, he was a son. Hallelujah. So let's read about his story. St. Luke 15 and verse 15. The Bible said, "And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into the field to feed swine, and he would faint. He would would faint and filled his belly with the but did heat. And no man gave unto him, oh my, this is a son." And when he came to himself, he said, "How many ire servant my father have bread enough and to spare and I perish with hunger?" He said, "I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, I'm no more I'm no more worthy TO BE CALLED THY SON." HE SAID, "MAKE me one of thy hired servant." And he arose and came to his father. Hallelujah. And many he was YET A GREAT WAY OFF. HIS father saw him and was and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. Oh my. Hallelujah. Just as we are tonight, CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. WE ARE NOT IN A true state, BUT GOD SAID THAT HE'S GOING TO SEND THE WORD. WE ARE LIKE THE PRODIGAL SON. HALLELUJAH. BUT THERE GOT TO COME A TIME THAT WE GOT TO COME BACK TO OURSELF. UH IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN ASLEEP IN AN AMNESIAN IN OUR MINDS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THINGS. HALLELUJAH. But there got to COME A TIME WHILE WE ARE HERE IN this earthly journey. We got to come back TO THE THOUGHT AND THE REALIZATION THAT WE ARE SONS OF GOD. BUT WHAT POSITION DOES THAT PUT put you? It puts you right into THE THE COMPLETE EXPRESS WORD OF GOD. Remember brother said hallelujah if I may quoted again. Brother said that that he said then Jesus which was the logos he said he was the perfect complete thought of God and he be he was known became known as the word hallelujah which he is and forever will be HALLELUJAH SO THE WORD IS ALREADY done it's finished SO IN OUR POSITION SON AS PRODIGALS. There got to COME A TIME WHEN YOU HEAR SOMETHING SOMETHING GOT TO WAKE YOU UP. SOME SOMETHING GOT TO BRING YOU BACK TO YOUR RIGHT SENSE INTO YOUR RIGHT MIND. HALLELUJAH. IT'S A PRAISE THE LORD. GOD PROMISED TO SEND A MESSENGER WITH A WORD TO WAKE THE BRIDE UP. CAN I TELL YOU CHURCH THAT THE BRIDE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE WORD OF GOD by Malachi 4. So the logos, hallelujah, speaks of the complete word. It's done. But where is it? It's in heaven. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. which comes down to the Rema word, brother Mark. Hallelujah. Because you see, there's no difference really between the logos and the Rema. Hallelujah. You see, TO BRING THE WORD INTO MANIFESTATION, you think when Noah was here, Hallelujah. And the Bible said, I think there in Genesis 6, hallelujah, when the iniquity, hallelujah, of of THE HUMAN RACE BECOME SO REJECTFUL THAT GOD SAID, I'M GOING TO DESTROY THE WORLD. BUT GOD FOUND ONE RIGHTEOUS, WHICH WAS NOW, HALLELUJAH. AND WHEN GOD GAVE HIM THE WORD, COME ON, CHURCH. WHERE DID THAT WORD COMES FROM? IT COMES FROM THE LOCUST AND IT BROUGHT HALLELUJAH TO A PROPHET TO DO WHAT? TO MAKE THE WORD LIVE. HALLELUJAH. SO THE REMA IS THE LIVING WORD MADE EXPRESS. HALLELUJAH. Oh my. I wish I could preach it by listen. EACH TIME NOW I TAKE THE HAMMER AND HE WAS NAILING. IT WAS A PART OF THE REVELATION. WHY? BECAUSE HE WAS BRINGING INTO MATERIALIZATION THE perfect thought of God. You could look and SEE WHAT WAS IN THE LOGOS WHEN THE REM WHEN THE REMA WAS MADE EXPRESSED. HALLELUJAH. IT BRINGS GOD IN PRESENT CONDITION. HALLELUJAH. IT TAKE HIM OUT OF HEAVEN AND BRING HIM INTO PEAR MANIFESTATION. HALLELUJAH. And that is important to the bride because we realize HALLELUJAH THAT GOD CHOSE A CHANNEL TO BRING THE WORD in manifestation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so it's not in the heaven church for each dispensation, each season. What was I'm saying to you church? Hallelujah. that which was a part of the mind of God came into expression. There was a time when MOSES WHEN GOD TOLD ABRAHAM, I'm going to send a deliverer. Where was that deliverer? He was in THE MIND OF GOD SOMEWHERE. BUT THERE COME A SEASON WHEN THE MIND OF GOD HAD TO BE MADE MATERIAL, A LIVING EXPRESSION. OH my church OF THE LIVING GOD. WHERE WERE YOU, BILL? YOU WERE PART OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, right Bill? You were there. But when it COMES TIME TO BRING HAL THE LOGOS H INTO MANIFESTATION, GOD TOOK THE MARK AND BROUGHT HIM INTO MANIFEST. AND HERE HE IS A LIVING TESTIMONY THAT THE word of God is living and it's real. It's real, church. Hallelujah. And so the word, every dispensation, GOD has hallelujah, an order, a channel to bring the logos into expression. HALLELUJAH. NO WONDER PAUL WHEN HE WRITES ABOUT HIM, Paul said, "God is is not a God that I WAS, BUT A GOD THAT IS BECAUSE HE CONSTANTLY UNFOLDING HIMSELF." Unfolding himself. Are you with me, church? And so, Brother Brandham looking in the Old Testament when he saw Aaron, HE SAID AARON WAS A TYPE OF CHRIST. WHY? BECAUSE HE CAME FROM THE ETERNAL SOURCE. [snorts] HALLELUJAH. He just came in a season to do what? TO FULFILL THE PORTION OF THE WORD CONCERNING HIMSELF. OH MY. HALLELUJAH. What about you and I? I WAS A PART OF A denominational church. I was there. But when it came my time, MY SEASON, WHEN THE THOUGHT OF GOD HAD TO BE EXPRESSED CONCERNING MYSELF, WHAT GOD DID, GOD RECREATE THE CONDITIONS. HALLELUJAH. THAT I CAN STEP IN THE PERFECT REVELATION of the word. HALLELUJAH. OH MY. SO CHURCH, I can report TO YOU TONIGHT THAT THE WORD OF GOD IS TRULY A LIVING EXPRESSION. HALLELUJAH. When he said, "I AM THE LORD your healer." Hallelujah. It's a living expression. Hallelujah. WHEN HE SAID, "I AM THE LORD YOUR PROVIDER." IT'S A living expression. Hallelujah. And here you are tonight, members of the body of Jesus Christ, a part of the bride of Christ who had would have told you that you would be here. But somehow the life that belongs to you SOMEWHERE SEARCH YOU out and found you. And when it FOUND YOU, IT BROUGHT YOU BACK TO CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. CHURCH, WE ARE GOING BACK TO CHRIST. WE ARE GOING BACK TO THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. AND LITTLE BY LITTLE, BROTHER MARK, IT'S COMING CLEAR. HALLELUJAH. BUT LET CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO you tonight? Hallelujah. BECAUSE THIS REVELATION ONLY come to the seed. Hallelujah. So when you when you read Paul's WRITING ABOUT IT, PAUL SAID IN HEBREWS 11, BY FAITH MOSES, BY FAITH ABRAHAM, BY FAITH SARAH, WHAT WAS HE TALKING ABOUT? FAITH IS A REVELATION OF THE WORD OF GOD. GOD TAKING THE WORD AND BRING IT in revelation, in manifestation in its season. This is your season. This is your day. This is your message. This is your time of the expression of the word of God. Hallelujah. And what we need is NOT MORE CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT MORE. OH CHURCH, WHAT WE NEED IS MORE OF THE revelation of God. Hallelujah. Amen. that this prodigal son have heard the word of God. Hallelujah. Brother Bam said God made a promise. God ought to keep all that promise. If he doesn't keep that promise, then he's not God. that if he's keeping that promise that only that's the only way he can live is by your faith making it live. The word of God is a seed. Hallelujah. And as God gave Abraham the promise and we see and we have had thousands of years of the experience since Abraham but Abraham made but Abraham made the promise to or God made it to Abraham and to his seed after him. He said you understand. I said amen to Abraham and conjunction tie the sentence together. Abraham and his seed after him. It said, "Not his seeds as plural, but his seed, the seed of one that Abraham believed that was coming by faith." Hallelujah. Through that came come Isaac. He said, "Through Isaac come Christ. Through Christ come you and I." Hallelujah. So church, there's really a seed and the seed of God. Halle brother. So the seed is the word. Hallelujah. Are you there with me church? And so if you are part of God, you weren't made a seed when you receive the NEW BIRTH. YOU ARE ALWAYS A PART OF THE LOGOS. HALLELUJAH. BUT THERE COME A time when you got to be made expressed in your season to do what? To bring FORTH THE WORD OF GOD IN YOUR DAY. TO BRING FORTH CHRIST IN MATERIAL. HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT IS HE DOING CHURCH? HE'S TAKING OF THE REALITY OF ANOTHER WORLD AND IT'S BRINGING IT INTO A DYING WORLD. ARE YOU THERE WITH ME, CHURCH? AND WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S CHANGING YOUR EXPERIENCE. It's taking YOU BACK TO YOUR ETERNAL PATH. HALLELUJAH. WHERE YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THAT I AM ALWAYS A SON OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So it belongs to the seed and the seed is not as many as Abraham seeds plural where we could trace his physical bloodline. Hallelujah. And this is so important if we had time enough to get into it tonight. But it is important to understand that the promise belongs only to the seed and it is the seed. Hallelujah. Which is Christ which is the seed of faith. Hallelujah. Listen what I'm saying to YOU CHURCH. THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST GOT TO HAVE FAITH IN THIS END TIME BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IDENTIFIES her being the seed of Christ. Hallelujah. Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. My not so much here. I think I probably move away from this brother. Kind of slowing me down. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But listen what I'm saying to you church. Hallelujah. The there there's a seed, the seed of God. And that seed MUST HAVE FAITH. THAT'S HOW YOU ARE IDENTIFIED. HALLELUJAH. WHAT is faith? FAITH IS A REVELATION. IT'S A REALITY OF THE WORLD. ARE YOU THERE, ME, CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. AND SO Jesus asked a question. When the son OF MAN COME, WILL HE FIND FAITH? WILL HE FIND PEOPLE BELIEVING THE WORD OF GOD? BROTHER, LET ME explain all of that. BROTHER SAID WE ARE WE ARE LIKE A TRIUNAL BEING. WE HAVE BODY, SPIRIT AND SOUL. HALLELUJAH. And soul in your soul. Hallelujah. Is where brother said it's doubt or faith belief or unbelief where in your soul. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE NOW WHEN YOUR SOUL COMES ALIVE TO THE WORD OF GOD, WHAT IT DOES? HALLELUJAH. Oh my. Oh my. This is what I'm saying to you church. WITH YOUR SOUL COME ALIVE TO THE WORD OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. IN YOUR SOUL YOU BECOME AWAKEN. YOU BEAR ME CHURCH. YOU SEE BROTHER SAID YOUR SOUL WAS MADE NOT TO CONTACT the earthly. BUT IT WAS MADE TO CONTACT THE SUPERNATURAL. IT WAS MADE TO HALLELUJAH. TO CONTACT HAL THE MIND OF CHRIST. ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. AND SO WITHIN your soul, WHEN YOUR SOUL COMES ALIVE, CAN I USE AN ILLUSTRATION for you to understand? Hallelujah. THE BIBLE SAID FAITH COMETH BY HEARING AND HEARING THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. WHERE IS FAITH? HERE IS FAITH. YOUR SOUL IS FAITH. AND YOUR SOUL COMES ALIVE WHEN IT HEARS THE WORD. ARE YOU THERE MY CHURCH? AND SO WITHOUT THE WORD, HALLELUJAH, YOUR SOUL WILL NOT BE MADE ALIVE. But when faith is hankered, WHAT IT DOES, it open up THE TREASURES OF HEAVEN. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? WHAT GOD IS DOING, GOD IS WAKING up your faith. HALLELUJAH. UNVEILING MORE OF THE WORD. AND THE MORE the word unveil, the more of the realities of God unveil, the more it changes your experience. The more in YOUR HEART IT BECOMES so real. Oh my, it become so real. Until it become real substance. Are you me church? BROTHER SAID, PAUL SAID, HALLELUJAH, faith is a substance. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? WHAT TYPE OF SUBSTANCE IT IS? HALLELUJAH. It's a real substance. Hallelujah. That allows you contacting the supernatural things of God. And so the seed of God must have faith. How else will you receive the things of God? They're already there, brother Mark. It's already over. It's finished. It's done. But how will you get it? You got to have faith. So your soul got to be made alive to the word. Yeah. You see what I'm saying? Hallelujah. So there got to come a time here. We are hang between a balance. Do I believe this? Do I do? Because here in this mortal life, we're compounded by the real subst circumstances of this mortal life. But in our soul, our soul is made alive by the word of God. Are you there, church? AND SO WHEN THE SOUL BECOMES ALIVE BY THE WORD OF GOD, it create, IT GIVES YOU THAT REALITY EXPERIENCE. HALLELUJAH. And so what we need, church, is to get out of this worldly atmosphere and TO SHUT AWAY WITH GOD AND AND TO EXHAUST THE THE THE THE SPLENDERS OF HEAVEN. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? AND AND TO PULL ON THE RESOURCES OF God because it's already done. It's already there. Hallelujah. But God uses that to identify the seed. If you are Christ seed, you must have faith. You see, one of the challenge that we are confronted with today is there's so much that is before us. We have never seen another time like this one. so many destruction. There's so many disturbances. There's so many struggles and troubles and hallelujah. And brother said, Bible said it's one of the darkest time the world has ever seen. But the Bible said, "But there shall be light in the heathen time." There got to be a people to bring that light to bring a life. Hallelujah. That is beyond this mortal life. That is what identify the seed of God their fate. And the Bible said and we will overcome this world by our faith. We will overcome it by the our faith. And so the seed of God Christ if he's there hallelujah he identify himself being the seed by faith that's what distinguish hallelujah I say this in closing quickly you see when Jesus came brother Mark Hallelujah you know brotherham spoke of he said that there were three races of people that were here the three sons of Nah that represents the the Jews, the Gentile and the Samaritans. And we saw there when he came to his own, he went to the Jews and in his experience with the Jews, even with his own disciples, he constantly saying to them, "Oh, of little faith. Oh, he of little faith. Right. But there was a time when a centurion came to him. Oh my. Which was a gentile. You hear what I'm saying to you? I'm I'm closing. A gentile came to him. a centuran and the Bible said in St. uh Matthew 8 and verse 8, the centurans answered and said, "Lord, I'm not worthy that thou should have come should come under my roof, but speak the word, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me." And I say to to this man, "Go," and he goeth, and another, "Come," and he cometh. And to my servant, "Do this," and he doeth it. And when Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to them that followed, "Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith not in Israel." Oh my, I just want to preach. This what I'm saying, church. Hallelujah. When it comes on to the Gentiles, Hallelujah. There is SOMETHING THAT IS ORDAINED FOR YOU. HALLELUJAH. THAT GOD WILL RECOGNIZE your fate. HALLELUJAH. GOD will accept your fate. NOT THAT HE DIDN'T ACCEPT the faith that was in Israel, BUT THERE'S ALWAYS THIS KIND OF wear and tear and believing, BUT HERE'S A MAN, a gentile, oh my, hallelujah, WHO SAID, "LORD, HALLELUJAH. Speed the word and I believe it." But what was it? What was happening, church? He said, "THE MYSTERY OF THE WORD points to a seed that is to come, a seed THAT WILL WALK BY FAITH, THAT WILL LIVE BY FAITH, THAT WILL TAKE THE THINGS OF GOD BY FAITH." HALLELUJAH. Oh my. Hear the story with the woman of Canaan. Hallelujah. St. Matthew 15 and verse 22. And behold, a woman of Canaan, this was a gentile woman, came out of the same course, and cried unto him, saying, "Have mercy on me, oh Lord, thou son of David." You know what brother Benham said? She did not have any claims on him, a son of David. He said, she said, "MY DAUGHTER IS GRIEF WITH THE DEVIL. But he answered her not a world. Why? Because she didn't approach the right way. But what was happened? And his disciples came besought him, saying, "Send her away, for she cried after us. But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel." Then came she and worship the worship him saying Lord. Oh my. Hallelujah. That's it. HALLELUJAH. WHEN SHE SAID LORD, HALLELUJAH, SHE BRING HIM RIGHT BACK TO THE logos to the Christ of who he is. He had to respond to it. Oh my. Hallelujah. But he answered and said, "It is not made to take the children's bread and to cause it to dogs." And she said, "True, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the master's table." Then Jesus answered and said unto her, "Oh woman, great is thy fate. Be unto thee, even as thou wilt." And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. Oh my. Are you there with me, CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. THERE'S SOMETHING about you Gentiles. HALLELUJAH. THAT GOD HAVE RESPECT TO YOUR FAITH. WHY? BECAUSE YOU SEE, BROTHER MARK, THERE GOT TO COME A GENTILE CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. THAT DOES NOT JUST TAKE THE WORK OF THE WORD, BUT THE FAITH OF THE WORD. ARE YOU THERE AT THE CHURCH? BUT WHERE WAS SHE? HALLELUJAH. So when Jesus was here, HE WALKED AMONG THE THE JEWS AND among the Samaritans. But scriptures got to be fulfilled. There got to come a TIME WHEN THE GENTILE CHURCH GOT TO APPROACH. OH MY. GOT TO COME BACK TO THE WORLD. LISTEN WHAT I'm saying to you church. Hallelujah. FOR ALL OF THIS WAS PREDESTINATED. No one KNEW THAT THERE WAS A GENTILE CHURCH WHO WAS A PART OF THE BLESSING. NO ONE KNEW THAT YOUR NAMES WERE THERE. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? BUT THERE COMES A TIME, HALLELUJAH, WHEN YOU COME IN THE PRESENCE OF HEARING THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. AND THE GENTILE STARTS HAVING FAITH. Oh my. What it does? It changes the hands of God because he had to get to that church. He got to get to that woman. HE GOT TO GET TO THAT GENTILE. SO WHEN THE GENTILE they were coming I'll read this and then we close off in St. John 12 and verse 20. These are when the Greeks went to him and there were certain Greek among them that came to came up to worship at it at the feast. The same came therefore to Philillip which was as the seder of Galilee and desire him says sir we would see Jesus and Philillip came come it and tell it and again Philillip tell Jesus and Jesus answer them saying the hour is come OH MY WHY BECAUSE NOW THE GENTILES hallelujah is now coming to him. AND JESUS NOW DECLARING THE hour is come. What is what is he talking ABOUT CHURCH? THERE GOT TO BE AN HOUR, A TIME WHEN THE THINGS OF GOD IS MADE MANIFESTED. YOU SEE, HE CAME AMONG THE JEWS AND HE DID ALL THE MIRACLES. HALLELUJAH. BUT LISTEN, BUT IT WAS MORE OF WORKS AND AND AND other things. But when it come TO THE GENTILE, IT was faith. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THE SEED THAT there's coming a church. Hallelujah. That will take the word of God by faith. Hallelujah. And so in closing, Paul when he was sent to the Gentile, he was commissioned by God to get that church, that Gentile church. Hallelujah. That nobody knew about. Hallelujah. But what God was doing, church, we're coming down now. What God was doing, there got to come a time when the people rise. Hallelujah. in faith, hallelujah, to take the things of God, to live by the things of God, to experience the things of God, to know the things of God. Hallelujah. But what GOD WAS DOING, HAL, GOD WAS NOT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS A CHURCH, HALLELUJAH, THAT HALLELUJAH, THE THINGS OF GOD, THE INVISIBLE THINGS, THE SUPERNATURAL THING IS COMING AGAIN. ARE YOU CHURCH? WHY ARE YOU HERE? Why are you here? Are you here to warm the benches? No. You're specially called to make the word of God live. And guess what? And you are predestinated to do so. You're specially designated. Hallelujah. So what is it? Hallelujah. And so we saw the first thing he did, brother Mark, to get this GENTILE CHURCH. WHAT HE DID? He sent forth a prophet to do what? To get the seed. Paul was a prophet. Hallelujah. AND A PROPHET BROUGHT FORTH THE WORD, THE SEED. HALLELUJAH. Church of the living God, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SEED. THE FIRST PAUL STARTED with seed. THE LAST BROTHER HAVE TO GO BACK TO SEED. HALLELUJAH. IT GOT TO GO BACK TO SEED. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? BECAUSE IT IS THROUGH THE seed the revelation will come. THE SEED WILL BRING GOD IN FLESH AGAIN. The seed WILL TAKE THE SUPERNATURAL THINGS OF GOD AND MADE THEM BECOMES a natural. Hallelujah. So I'm preaching to you tonight that you will come to yourself. I must come back to myself in my conscious state of mind to recognize who I am. And when the bride recognizes who she is for the market and that she's called to do the greater works, the Bible said the gates of hell can't prevail because what you're doing, you're pulling on the eternal logos, the eternal resources of God. I said the last time while we were while I was here, you haven't seen anything yet. The bride is coming in position. She hears the word. Hallelujah. The word is not somewhere in heaven to be brought down. The word is nye even in thy mouth. Hallelujah. Where's the word tonight, church? It's in your heart. It's a reality. Hallelujah. And she's being awakened to this reality. She's seeing and she's believing and she's experiencing more and more of the supernatural. Hallelujah. It's not to raise a dead or no, no, no. It's to recognize who you are. It's about it's a work of faith. is to bring your faith to a to to a position where it can naturally pull the things of God and manifest them naturally. Brother Mark to make it live live. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can I take about two more minutes? Hallelujah. We are called TO MAKE THE WORLD LIVE. Live how? in a body in the MIDST OF THIS DYING WORLD. HALLELUJAH. Faith is risen again. HALLELUJAH. NOT MORTAL FAITH but eternal faith. THAT POSITION A BRIDE TO THE SUPERNATURAL. HALLELUJAH. You talk about having church. Hallelujah. I believe IN MY HEART. HALLELUJAH. BUT ONE of these days we come here AND IT'S GOING TO BE SO REAL THAT IT GOING TO FEEL AS IF THE ANGELS ARE HERE WHICH THEY ARE. IT'S GOING TO GET SO REAL CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE WHEN THE BELIEVERS CLOSE THEIR EYES AND AND TURN AWAY TO THE HEAVENLY THINGS AND YOU STEP FROM this mortal sense into the immortal sense it become so real church. It feel AS IF IT BECOME substance to you. Faith produces the substance of the reality. Hallelujah. And it's going to be so real until the angels of God begin appearing, until the dead saints begin appearing. You know what will do it? Your faith. It's your faith that is is going to do it. It's going to come so real. Hallelujah. Until one day you step. Brother said and what is the rapture? It's just a change. The other side is going to become so real that one morning between 6 and 9 you just step across. That's all it is. We have been called to the realities of God's word. Church, my final statement, I promise I close. Your faith is being awakened to reality. Accept God's reality by his word. God bless you tonight. Give me this next time as we close.
