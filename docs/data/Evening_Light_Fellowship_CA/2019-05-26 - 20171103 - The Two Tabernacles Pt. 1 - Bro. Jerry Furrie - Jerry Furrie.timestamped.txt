[39:14] God for grace grace you are the elders
[39:18] grace to the young brothers and sisters
[39:21] Lord we bless them amen those that are
[39:25] here and those that are not able to make
[39:26] it the Saints wherever they are God's
[39:29] grace to them but we thank the Lord for
[39:32] the grace that has brought our brother
[39:35] Jerry with us today to minister to us
[39:39] today tomorrow and Sunday amen and
[39:42] having met him around noon today there's
[39:48] little change in our brother well we're
[39:52] looking for a greater change a man is
[39:54] looking for a greater change the the
[39:57] change that I saw was negative a man but
[40:02] I'm sure that we're all hoping for and
[40:04] believing for a more positive change a
[40:07] man because when I met our brother and
[40:09] minister for our brothers some years ago
[40:11] is there wasn't wasn't white as the as a
[40:16] brother sings on the song sometimes he
[40:18] said just to talk about the old house
[40:21] that he dwells in and he said the hinges
[40:23] are there no more good and and he said
[40:26] there's snow on the rooftop and so on so
[40:30] so our brother got snow on the rooftop
[40:33] but he but the the hour is coming the
[40:36] hours fast approaching we're really
[40:38] we're approaching that new body my God
[40:41] to the glorified body of our Lord Jesus
[40:43] Christ and our brother Jerry is not
[40:47] going to look older he's going to look a
[40:49] lot younger a man and and our sister
[40:53] here is going to be much younger a man
[40:55] praise the Lord
[40:57] see if we don't need to go out into the
[40:59] world and look for the things to make
[41:00] you look young you know whether it's
[41:02] clothing and amoled the world looks for
[41:04] is makeup and and all these things so
[41:07] you can look yeah yeah yeah no no no
[41:09] that passes away but regardless of how
[41:12] old you get
[41:13] you know you're gonna need a lot of
[41:15] painting and makeup to cover the old age
[41:18] but we're going to do a body where you
[41:21] won't need it a man a man a mate we're
[41:24] going to do a glorified body a young
[41:27] body that a never girl knows nothing of
[41:30] old mate know nothing of time or or or
[41:33] what goes on in this temporal world
[41:35] praise God
[41:36] we're going into a glorified body a
[41:39] perfect body and that's what God is
[41:41] doing we know what he did in Luther and
[41:44] Wesleyan and then the Pentecostals but
[41:48] with us
[41:49] he's moving us into a different
[41:50] dimension he's moving us into a higher
[41:53] dimension
[41:53] he's moving us into the fulfillment of a
[41:56] greater promise a man the resurrection
[41:58] and the rapture god help us to believe
[42:01] by the grace of God God Elva so that our
[42:04] faith becomes sight spiritually a man we
[42:09] go from looking to the promise to
[42:12] experiencing the reality of it
[42:14] a man so we're not just believing for a
[42:17] glorified body we will we will be in a
[42:20] glorified body by the grace of Almighty
[42:23] God so God help us is my prayer that he
[42:26] will anoint our brother tonight with the
[42:28] Holy Ghost
[42:29] praise the Lord and it's going to bring
[42:32] that word more into a more more reality
[42:35] to the Bride of Christ that's right that
[42:39] it'll be--it'll be as real to us as the
[42:42] promise was to Joshua and Caleb amen to
[42:45] go into the promised land
[42:46] they believe they all believe they're
[42:49] coming out but not all believed in going
[42:51] in same answer by the grace of God I
[42:54] pray God blessing Blair and anoint our
[42:57] brother Jerry fury tonight from Alberta
[43:00] and Ann Elpis brother get us more into
[43:03] that faith that Joshua and Caleb had to
[43:06] go in the Promised Land was more real to
[43:09] them than the others so I pray that the
[43:12] promised land is more real to us than
[43:14] you know all the other churches and all
[43:16] the other denominations and many even
[43:19] so-called professing believers
[43:21] a man that we really believe in the
[43:24] resurrection we really believe in the
[43:26] rapture we really believe in a new and
[43:28] glorified body a man and I pray that by
[43:32] by the hearing of the word that will
[43:34] hear tonight that by the hearing of the
[43:36] word will out of the faith the real
[43:39] faith that makes these things more real
[43:41] than the natural things by the grace of
[43:45] Almighty God so the lord help us brother
[43:48] and i alternative if it becomes a
[43:51] reality in your heart and in your soul
[43:53] you're gonna we're gonna live a
[43:55] different kind of a life I'll guarantee
[43:58] you that
[43:58] we'll think different act different talk
[44:01] different and in the eyes of the world
[44:03] will be foolish in the eyes of the world
[44:05] will will be insane a man and fanatical
[44:09] with God help us he's looking for that
[44:11] he's looking for those people to rise on
[44:13] the earth and I remember again as the
[44:16] prophet said he said God he's waiting on
[44:18] us but there's too many of they're
[44:20] waiting on God took don't wait on God if
[44:24] you wait on God to get judgment but
[44:27] everybody will go on and fulfill what
[44:29] God wants us to do a man we're gonna
[44:31] have the grace of God unto the
[44:33] redemption complete redemption soul body
[44:37] and spirit by the grace of God amen so
[44:41] god help us and let's be in prayer for
[44:43] our brother Jerry as he comes with the
[44:46] word a man and with the faith he's
[44:49] moving into a into a young body a man by
[44:54] the grace of God so and also to be in
[44:57] prayer for the saints that want to make
[44:59] it here tonight but couldn't make it and
[45:02] those since there were some in central

[45:11] that they would try to connect with us

[51:55] [Applause]
[52:02] [Applause]
[52:12] [Music]
[52:15] praise God you believe God that saves
[52:18] you let me just say it this way you know
[52:21] we all want to believe in Rob for your
[52:23] faith amen
[52:24] thing is that one day that's gonna
[52:26] become more of a reality - it is than we
[52:28] are today stand here coming to church
[52:30] because remember the Bible says that
[52:32] Noah walked with God but he only had
[52:35] salvation faith but but Enoch walked
[52:38] with God for 365 years what was a
[52:41] difference he had rapturing faith this
[52:43] bride has Rafi and faith she she doesn't
[52:47] have salvation faith which is a good
[52:50] thing but she has rapture faith a man
[52:53] well thank you brother Jiro for asking
[52:56] me here I'm good to see all the saints
[52:58] here I've I've heard a lot about you
[53:00] over the years of course I knew your
[53:01] brother Adam knew sister Jamie I knew
[53:04] different ones I just met brother mark
[53:05] here today the first time I heard a lot
[53:08] about him over the years brother Bob of
[53:11] course sister brendham known for a few
[53:14] years and so you all probably heard the
[53:18] story gave me a black eye when he came
[53:20] at her out in Delbert so it was kind of
[53:22] like you know it's well you know I said
[53:25] you go back to the friend oh I just
[53:30] wanted to say that I appreciate brother
[53:33] Gerald having me and I evergreens from
[53:35] Alberta from a little congregation
[53:37] outside of Edmonton near Spruce Grove I
[53:39] just wanted to thank God for what he's
[53:42] doing is working our lives because the
[53:45] thing is friends if we realize what
[53:48] we've been called to I'll tell you what
[53:50] we should be more consecrated I'm
[53:52] talking for myself because the thing is
[53:54] being the bride of Jesus Christ is not a
[53:57] light thing because the we talk about
[54:00] grace but you realize grace is an
[54:03] attribute of time it's something that
[54:05] God has put in time in this day so we
[54:07] can be saved one day we won't need grace
[54:10] but we need grace now we need blood we
[54:13] need the covering of the blood we need
[54:14] forgiveness ends all those different
[54:15] things but friends one day it's going to
[54:17] be done away with but in understanding
[54:20] those things grace will lead you the
[54:22] Holy Ghost Grace will get you save grace
[54:25] will do all
[54:26] sings and Friends of things when God
[54:28] opens these revelations in our heart and
[54:30] we walk in those that's when God keeps
[54:32] on opening up because people
[54:34] misunderstand grace grace is not to make
[54:37] a disgrace
[54:38] grace is supposed to be able to do
[54:40] something for you to walk closer to him
[54:43] amen amen I don't know how long I'm
[54:46] gonna be here tonight I just want to
[54:48] start on a subject and if we're how far
[54:51] we get tonight I'll pick it up tomorrow
[54:53] night and I just want to because I put
[54:56] 70 slides on there I says I said the
[54:59] brother Matthew sorry
[55:04] I remember that brother Adam brother
[55:06] Matthew I said the brother Matt got 70
[55:08] slides but we're probably warning come
[55:10] close to getting them done but I just
[55:11] wanted to see how far we're gonna get
[55:13] see how you pull see how God comes down
[55:16] and he delivers it I just wanted to be
[55:17] able to be in his will his leadership I
[55:20] don't want to be able to try to do
[55:24] something because sometimes you can over
[55:26] feed people and you can try to stuff it
[55:29] down their throat and they're done
[55:31] eating and we'll see tonight how how
[55:35] much we how far we get but anyways if
[55:37] you have your Bibles handy we'll turn to
[55:39] Revelation chapter 5 amen and just want
[55:43] to be able to get kind of comfortable
[55:45] here you know we got here about one
[55:48] o'clock in the morning it's morning and
[55:51] got a good sleep but you know how it is
[55:54] you when you travel sometimes you just
[55:57] kind of just you just your wits are not
[56:00] all about you and you know I've told my
[56:03] wife you form kind of getting to the
[56:05] place now on I mean we got some younger
[56:07] brothers in congregation that speak and
[56:09] they go out different places and have
[56:12] outreach meetings which a big supporter
[56:15] of it but the thing is is that when you
[56:17] when you get an older and you travel all
[56:19] the time when I was traveling there
[56:20] quite a bit to Africa and stuff like
[56:22] that it was just I was getting tired and
[56:24] I thought well I just stay home and
[56:25] pastor for a while and but the thing is
[56:28] is that I don't know if the Lord see
[56:31] you're looking for leadership of the
[56:32] Lord I don't know if the Lord wants me
[56:34] to do that but we'll find out and maybe
[56:36] we'll go back
[56:37] go back over to Africa and see what's
[56:39] over there as far as what under
[56:41] leadership of God to get me to a place
[56:43] where because you're always getting
[56:44] brother Jill would know that you're
[56:46] always getting people asking to come
[56:48] over and some of this you feel bad in
[56:51] one way but you feel you want to feel
[56:52] under the leadership of the Lord is this
[56:54] Lord is this you doing this
[56:56] amen amen
[57:00] as a familiar scripture to us Revelation
[57:03] chapter 5 verse 8 you realize a book is
[57:09] closed in revelations chapter 5 but it's
[57:11] opening in Revelations 10 we all know
[57:12] that right so understand this sometimes
[57:17] it can be closed to a person because the
[57:20] book only comes open by revelation it's
[57:23] not open because I said it's open its
[57:27] open by revelation to you I can explain
[57:30] all those things to you but it's got to
[57:32] be open to you personally in your life
[57:34] because what it actually is to you is
[57:36] the Almighty God unveiled in your
[57:39] personal life we know we had a prophecy
[57:43] in this day
[57:44] mighty angel way well we have a mighty
[57:47] angel come down speak through the
[57:49] revelations 10-7 angel brother branham
[57:51] we all know that right
[57:53] and on the unveiling of Almighty God but
[57:56] it doesn't stop there it's got to be an
[57:58] unveiling personally to you to many
[58:01] people in the message are just sitting
[58:05] on message pews absorbing information
[58:08] and not taking in revelation now let me
[58:11] just say it this way we're about three
[58:14] generations since the Prophet went off
[58:16] the scene you know what we're becoming
[58:18] in this message like Hutterites Amish
[58:22] where it just becomes a lifestyle and
[58:25] not a new birth that's what friends
[58:28] that's what we should be after is the
[58:29] new birth God being born as a son or
[58:32] daughter of God that's important and the
[58:35] thing is friends were in an adoption age
[58:37] there's a maturing that goes on in the
[58:39] bride chief Cornerstone comes into your
[58:42] heart and he begins to build his
[58:44] characteristics in your life
[58:46] amen let's read from verse eight and
[58:49] when he had taken the book in the four
[58:52] beasts and the four and twenty elders
[58:53] fell down before the lamb having every
[58:55] one of them harps golden vials full of
[58:58] odours which are the prayers of the
[59:00] saints and they sung a new song saying
[59:02] thou art worthy to take the book and to
[59:05] open the seals thereof for thou was
[59:07] slain and has redeemed us to God by the
[59:09] blood of every kindred and tongue and
[59:11] people and nation and that's made us
[59:14] unto our God kings and priests we shall
[59:17] reign on this earth let's have a word of
[59:20] Prayer father I pray to your God that
[59:22] you just Lord Jesus now father it's it's
[59:26] you father on display we don't want our
[59:29] flesh to get in the way
[59:30] dear God we have these human bodies and
[59:33] father they are frail and Lord they're
[59:36] there that they're full of many mistakes
[59:38] but dear God father you've used man in
[59:41] this day to preach your word and father
[59:43] I pray now dear God that you just use me
[59:46] speak to your people Lord speak to them
[59:49] father straight to their hearts and
[59:50] father let thy word have preeminence in
[59:52] us granted I pray I ask this in the name
[59:55] of Jesus Christ amen you may have your
[59:57] seats
[59:58] amen I just wanted to know it's working
[1:00:01] amen oh you know God uses ministry to
[1:00:06] imperfecta our imperfecta ministry to
[1:00:09] actually perfect the bride you realize
[1:00:12] friends the thing is God always used
[1:00:14] been you know you hear people and I just
[1:00:16] wanted we kind of relaxed myself but you
[1:00:18] hear people say that you know I'm gonna
[1:00:20] go right straight back to the tapes and
[1:00:21] get it off the tapes I don't need to go
[1:00:23] to church I don't need to hear ministry
[1:00:25] I don't need to you know because
[1:00:27] ministry makes so many mistakes but the
[1:00:29] thing is friends that's the way God's
[1:00:31] chosen because you know brother Branham
[1:00:33] told tells us that there's only one
[1:00:36] provided way we got to be because the
[1:00:38] God set the pattern in this in this age
[1:00:40] and our harsh is supposed to be turned
[1:00:42] back to our AAPIs taluk father's right
[1:00:44] that's what the ministry came in this
[1:00:46] day it was a restoration message it was
[1:00:48] a restoration ministry the King honor a
[1:00:50] prophet but the thing is that as the
[1:00:52] bride goes on and begins to become more
[1:00:55] mature in these things she understands
[1:00:57] who
[1:00:57] she is because if I said to you tonight
[1:01:00] who's the book of redemption
[1:01:02] now friends who's who's the book of
[1:01:04] redemption in novel scenario well what
[1:01:07] you realize God's not coming for message
[1:01:10] books and message tapes he's coming for
[1:01:13] a book and it's the book of Jerry it's
[1:01:16] the book of Mark it's a book of gerald
[1:01:18] book a bob on and on now what is if I
[1:01:21] open up the covers of that book what is
[1:01:23] that book readin it should be reading
[1:01:25] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:01:27] and forever see it should not be a book
[1:01:30] of so much of saying that because if you
[1:01:33] read the belt Abraham in the Old
[1:01:34] Testament and you read about him in the
[1:01:36] New Testament totally different man you
[1:01:38] read of all his mistakes but through the
[1:01:40] blood covenant through the Covenant of
[1:01:42] coming through the cross you read about
[1:01:43] Abraham he never failed he was a man of
[1:01:46] faith all those different things that's
[1:01:48] the kind of thing that I want to read
[1:01:50] about me I don't want him sit there and
[1:01:52] just sit you don't become a message
[1:01:54] believer is drying up on a message Pew I
[1:01:56] don't want to be cold for a you know
[1:01:58] just formal and powerless I want God to
[1:02:01] come on the scene in my life and I want
[1:02:03] to see the working of the word in my
[1:02:05] life that's what I want
[1:02:06] and the thing is I understand friends
[1:02:09] the thing is these these human bodies
[1:02:11] are full of frailties they're full of
[1:02:13] mistakes all those different things but
[1:02:15] the same questions been taken care of a
[1:02:17] long time ago see I've never sinned in
[1:02:20] the first place I'm justified here
[1:02:22] tonight I don't take those things for
[1:02:24] granted but I just believe what the Word
[1:02:25] says about me I don't believe what I say
[1:02:28] about myself but I believe what the Word
[1:02:29] says about me that there will be a bride
[1:02:32] that's spotless without blemish you know
[1:02:35] friends will be white as snow all's I
[1:02:37] believe in all those things
[1:02:39] I understand friends you look back on
[1:02:41] your life that you've come over many
[1:02:43] things you look back because you see the
[1:02:44] growth of God in your own life because
[1:02:47] we're coming to maturity here because
[1:02:49] you come for a mature bride he's not
[1:02:51] coming for a for a young girl he's
[1:02:53] coming from a mature bride elect lady
[1:02:55] that's what we are friends now as we go
[1:02:58] on in here watch in 1st Peter says he
[1:03:00] also as lively stones are built up a
[1:03:02] spiritual house a house holy priesthood
[1:03:05] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:03:06] acceptable
[1:03:07] the God by Jesus Christ now 1st Peter
[1:03:10] 2:9 it says but ye are a chosen
[1:03:11] generation a royal priesthood now we're
[1:03:14] talking about us it's about us okay you
[1:03:18] got to identify yourself in these things
[1:03:19] these are not for somebody else this is
[1:03:22] for the end time bride this is about us
[1:03:24] now watch a royal priesthood an holy
[1:03:27] nation a peculiar people that you should
[1:03:29] show forth the praises of him who have
[1:03:32] called you out of darkness into his
[1:03:33] marvelous light which in time past were
[1:03:36] not a people but are now the people of
[1:03:39] God which are not obtained mercy but now
[1:03:41] have obtained mercy now that's speaking
[1:03:44] about us we have obtained mercy this
[1:03:47] isn't for everybody you realize that the
[1:03:49] the nominations read it are the same
[1:03:51] Bibles reread out of but the Bible's not
[1:03:54] written for them it's actually written
[1:03:56] for the bride see it's only the bride
[1:03:58] that actually has understanding because
[1:04:00] the eyes of our understanding God's oxu
[1:04:02] opened up now on Ephesians 1:18 this is
[1:04:05] for the eyes are very understanding have
[1:04:07] been enlightened now these are the
[1:04:09] characteristics of a bride the eyes of
[1:04:12] your understanding being enlightened
[1:04:13] we've been enlightened by the truth of
[1:04:16] this day that you may know what is the
[1:04:18] hope of his glory of his calling and
[1:04:20] what riches of his glory of his
[1:04:22] inheritance in the Saints now friends
[1:04:24] the characteristics of the bride Jesus
[1:04:26] Christ today as she will be enlightened
[1:04:29] so God has opened his word in this day
[1:04:32] and Friends the thing is is that if I'm
[1:04:35] in that word I should be able to see my
[1:04:39] part in there because we've been called
[1:04:41] to the reading of the will now friends
[1:04:43] the thing is we can we can look at in
[1:04:45] many different ways here we can look at
[1:04:47] in the sense of why message believer but
[1:04:50] friends were more than just a message
[1:04:52] believer see where the bride of Jesus
[1:04:54] Christ were a people called a royal
[1:04:56] priesthood and we're stones fit into a
[1:04:59] house now friends the thing is is that
[1:05:01] we have a promise in this day and age
[1:05:03] but remember friends Cain and Abel were
[1:05:06] in the same church and I'm gonna read
[1:05:09] you a quote here right away but you know
[1:05:10] once you understand see not all
[1:05:12] revelation is great and wonderful
[1:05:15] revelation Abel got a revelation of who
[1:05:19] Cain was
[1:05:19] it was very painful to him it was a
[1:05:23] painful revelation because you got to
[1:05:25] reimagine he ready he grew up with cane
[1:05:28] and he did a lot of things with cane
[1:05:30] maybe they went to the fishing the
[1:05:31] stream and threw rocks and on and on and
[1:05:34] on all of a sudden one day God gives a
[1:05:37] bowl of ition now we all know about the
[1:05:39] sacrifice because the thing is a the
[1:05:41] thing is that Abel could God could
[1:05:44] identify Abel's sacrifice but he
[1:05:46] couldn't identify with Cain's sacrifice
[1:05:47] because that's not what was reflected in
[1:05:50] heaven but understand this it Abel had a
[1:05:53] painful revelation who Cain was now Cain
[1:05:56] was a worshipper brother ban says Cain
[1:06:00] was a believer Cain had a desire to
[1:06:03] serve God came let me just get it real
[1:06:08] world so you can real xxx
[1:06:09] Cain was a good message believer amen
[1:06:15] see the thing is this is what people
[1:06:17] they think of Cain you know like yeah
[1:06:20] and of course we know Cain wasn't
[1:06:21] predestinated because the thing is we
[1:06:23] know God gave him a chance he turned
[1:06:25] that down he was certain see we know we
[1:06:28] haven't understand that but the thing is
[1:06:30] is that the way we look at Cain
[1:06:31] sometimes is the wrong way of looking at
[1:06:33] him he comes to church he worships he
[1:06:37] sings hymns he does all the things like
[1:06:40] a believer does without revelation
[1:06:42] because he has no spiritual application
[1:06:45] without God he tries to apply things but
[1:06:48] he has no spiritual application there's
[1:06:50] nothing about him
[1:06:51] that is spiritual he sees everything
[1:06:54] carnal now let me go can I get connected
[1:06:58] just preach here tonight you can dress
[1:07:01] right you can have all the outfit right
[1:07:04] all those different things but that
[1:07:06] doesn't tell me that you're born again
[1:07:07] that doesn't you can do that under your
[1:07:11] natural way we look at the Pharisees we
[1:07:14] look at the Sadducees probably get it
[1:07:15] into the Sun Sunday but remember friends
[1:07:17] this Pharisees and Sadducees quoted
[1:07:20] Moses but sort of Jesus what was the
[1:07:24] difference between Jesus quoting
[1:07:26] Pharisees courting they courted the same
[1:07:28] prophet there our prophet
[1:07:31] following people amen
[1:07:34] quoting the Prophet what was the
[1:07:36] difference the identification of Jesus
[1:07:39] identifying himself who he was in the
[1:07:41] scripture talked to him about from Moses
[1:07:44] the Pharisees were talking about him in
[1:07:46] an historical point see we could talk
[1:07:49] about a message in an historical way or
[1:07:51] we can talk about the message in a
[1:07:53] present way amen
[1:07:55] see this is why this bride steps into
[1:07:58] her place and she speaks about a now God
[1:08:02] not a history God but a God is now see
[1:08:06] friends a thing is I can tap my hand on
[1:08:08] the pulpit here as soon as I stop that
[1:08:12] was history what I just did but I serve
[1:08:15] a present God a God that lives right now
[1:08:17] and the thing is when I leave Church
[1:08:20] here tonight he's going with me
[1:08:22] I'm not saying bye to him as I walk out
[1:08:24] the door and I'll see you tomorrow night
[1:08:26] he goes with me where I go because he's
[1:08:29] a present God he's not a history God
[1:08:32] he's a present God now here brother
[1:08:34] Branham says this he says now let me
[1:08:36] just read the rest of this so I can get
[1:08:38] into it right quick now and the eighth
[1:08:40] verse he says when he had taken the book
[1:08:43] the four beasts talking about what we
[1:08:45] were just reading about in the twenty
[1:08:46] and four and twenty elders fell down
[1:08:48] before the lamb having every one of them
[1:08:50] harps golden vials for orders and
[1:08:52] prayers of the saints
[1:08:54] now this is the time when they
[1:08:55] everything must be worshipped now
[1:08:57] remember how appropriate
[1:08:59] now don't let us miss this now listen
[1:09:01] close he says when all the mysteries of
[1:09:03] the church age was finished when all the
[1:09:05] mysteries of the plans Redemption them
[1:09:07] seven seals was opened right immediately
[1:09:09] after this now look it's time for
[1:09:11] everything in heaven everything
[1:09:13] unearthed to worship God so that's on
[1:09:16] believer and believer that's the
[1:09:19] nomination you know on and on and on and
[1:09:21] on everybody after the openness seals
[1:09:24] everybody's called the worship okay so
[1:09:29] now watch what takes place he says
[1:09:31] listen I
[1:09:32] listen at this just a minute he says and
[1:09:34] they sung a new song saying thou art
[1:09:37] worthy listen to what the worship this
[1:09:40] was the Alvers the Beast everything felt
[1:09:42] right before him see like that when he
[1:09:45] made his complete plan plan it's a time
[1:09:48] of worship now listen then redeem souls
[1:09:51] crying out there everything in heaven is
[1:09:55] worshiping this lamb so there's people
[1:09:58] that are actually worshiping that aren't
[1:10:01] born again and people that have born
[1:10:04] again are worshiping but what God is
[1:10:07] looking for is a true worshiper the
[1:10:12] Pharisees and I want to get too far
[1:10:14] ahead of myself when I preach them in
[1:10:16] Lord willing on Sunday morning the
[1:10:18] Pharisees they had all the dress right
[1:10:22] they had all the garments right they
[1:10:24] were clean living people
[1:10:26] brother Bram tells you couldn't put one
[1:10:28] finger on their life they weren't
[1:10:30] fornicators there weren't adulterers
[1:10:32] there were clean living people and
[1:10:34] friends the thing is is that they
[1:10:36] followed the law what they knew of of
[1:10:39] course they attitude all those different
[1:10:41] things but they could not identify
[1:10:43] themselves in the scriptures see friends
[1:10:48] is an identity crisis going on if you
[1:10:51] can't identify yourself in the
[1:10:52] scriptures friends if you can't
[1:10:53] everybody everybody's identified in the
[1:10:56] scriptures here tonight you can be a
[1:10:58] Judas give me any Christ you can be
[1:11:01] cried somebody's got to fulfill some
[1:11:02] part of the scripture somewhere I
[1:11:04] believe friends the thing is I'm popping
[1:11:06] apart bride here tonight but understand
[1:11:09] this razor thing is that as we go along
[1:11:11] down this road there's gonna be more and
[1:11:14] more things pop up and it's happening
[1:11:16] all the time I don't know what this mess
[1:11:17] is going to look like in five years from
[1:11:19] now because the thing is what people are
[1:11:21] preaching now I'm portraying now friends
[1:11:23] they're portraying a God that doesn't
[1:11:25] exist
[1:11:27] it's a god of their imagination and the
[1:11:30] thing is it's not a God of reality
[1:11:32] because the thing is is that III I
[1:11:35] believe with all my heart of course the
[1:11:38] thing is that's a Brundage trace but me
[1:11:40] it's a part of I serve a God a reality I
[1:11:42] don't serve a God of my imagination and
[1:11:45] the bride has that type of faith because
[1:11:48] she has Rob treating faith so the thing
[1:11:50] is is that all the mysteries that he was
[1:11:52] senior of the church Jesus was finished
[1:11:54] here now when the seven seals broke open
[1:11:56] what was the seven seals doing for you
[1:11:58] that's the pride it was actually making
[1:12:00] a call to you come and worship the true
[1:12:02] lamb right common trusted to come and
[1:12:06] worship the true lamb that's what
[1:12:09] friends the bride is doing she's at she
[1:12:11] could worshiping the true lamb knowing
[1:12:14] John 4:23 now I'm gonna go through so
[1:12:17] I'm just laying a foundation here but
[1:12:19] the hour cometh now is when the true
[1:12:20] worshipers shall worship the father in
[1:12:22] spirit and in truth so he says the true
[1:12:25] worshipers shall worship the father in
[1:12:28] spirit and truth the hour cometh and for
[1:12:30] the father seeketh such to worship Him
[1:12:32] God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:12:35] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[1:12:39] truth so there will be a true worshiper
[1:12:42] and also a false worshiper
[1:12:45] amen so the thing is is that there's two
[1:12:48] systems of worship there's one system
[1:12:51] that is true one citizen that is false
[1:12:54] and they're side-by-side all the way
[1:12:57] from the book of Genesis from Cain and
[1:13:00] Abel all the way down this end time
[1:13:02] there will be two ones one will be
[1:13:04] acceptable to God and one will be not be
[1:13:06] something a god one will do go through
[1:13:08] the rituals forms and all those things
[1:13:10] the other one will go through and
[1:13:12] worship and in truth in spirit in fact a
[1:13:16] pillar of fire o be with them and there
[1:13:18] will be ones that worship in that will
[1:13:20] the pillar fire won't be with them
[1:13:21] that's why friends the thing is true
[1:13:23] worship comes from a person that is
[1:13:26] actually born-again by word word birth
[1:13:31] you understand this just for a second
[1:13:34] here the mail is here tonight Jesus
[1:13:37] Christ
[1:13:38] he speaks for through the ministry and
[1:13:42] the thing is that what he's doing he's
[1:13:44] actually you are receiving a love from
[1:13:49] him
[1:13:49] from the word the word is actually what
[1:13:52] actually German ties is the soul and the
[1:13:55] thing is that he uses ministry to
[1:13:57] actually preach his word we had a
[1:13:59] problem this day who actually preached
[1:14:01] and friends the thing is that well at
[1:14:04] the time he was living there's a lot of
[1:14:05] people that didn't understand what he
[1:14:07] was doing but there was a ministry
[1:14:08] coming out after and I picked up what
[1:14:11] that prophet was saying and actually got
[1:14:14] a revelation of it and what it was it
[1:14:16] was through the preaching of the word
[1:14:17] the mail the word the mail actually
[1:14:20] preaching into the bride now if I were
[1:14:25] to ask you just just so you can just so
[1:14:27] you understand where I'm coming from now
[1:14:28] if we're the bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:14:31] the Mail's here what is actually taking
[1:14:33] place it becomes new birth by spoke than
[1:14:37] worked okay what I want to say to you
[1:14:41] really is reality is this is a book of
[1:14:44] redemption is in the hands of us right
[1:14:48] so on that book these Redemption let me
[1:14:52] put it this way Adam and Eve had the
[1:14:55] book they felt the book went back up the
[1:14:58] owner revelations 5 the book came back
[1:15:00] down correct so the book came back and
[1:15:04] where is it it's in our hands right and
[1:15:07] every name on that book has to be
[1:15:09] redeemed they cannot be made perfect
[1:15:12] without us so in other words are waiting
[1:15:15] for us to mature to perfection so they
[1:15:18] can actually be come out of the graves
[1:15:21] the Saints for the last two thousand
[1:15:23] years
[1:15:24] the maturity of the bride is going on
[1:15:26] right now so the male's here Jesus
[1:15:28] Christ right and what he's doing he's
[1:15:31] feeding the bride the work and what is
[1:15:34] happening is that there's a birth coming
[1:15:36] more forth more and more because she's
[1:15:38] getting more of more of rapture in faith
[1:15:41] as it builds into her and it's actually
[1:15:44] she's coming cuz we had a perfect word
[1:15:46] there's
[1:15:46] word coming that's actually perfecting
[1:15:49] us it's come already but it's coming and
[1:15:51] it's actually gonna bring those ones out
[1:15:53] of the grave
[1:15:55] The Voice is the resurrection right it's
[1:15:59] gonna come through this bright I just
[1:16:01] want the friends we got to know who we
[1:16:03] are
[1:16:03] I want out of here I'm not waiting for
[1:16:06] anybody else I'm in your it amen I'm not
[1:16:10] what there's no other message for coming
[1:16:12] we had our messenger but I know I'm the
[1:16:14] guy you're the guy I met see friends the
[1:16:18] thing is we look for everybody else to
[1:16:20] do something but listen we are what it
[1:16:23] is as friends the thing is finding your
[1:16:24] place in the body and God working
[1:16:27] through that part to actually bring
[1:16:29] forth his word but what it's hopping for
[1:16:31] his people are sitting there waiting
[1:16:32] well it's gonna happen let me just say
[1:16:35] this
[1:16:35] Rob stirring faith is in you now you are
[1:16:39] the rapture you are Jesus Christ the
[1:16:43] second coming of Jesus Christ right now
[1:16:47] that's what you are you're actually then
[1:16:50] people three top well the thing is is
[1:16:52] that who else who else the second coming
[1:16:54] of Jesus Christ he's come right he's
[1:16:58] comin see and we're sitting here tonight
[1:17:00] we're wondering well is he come or not
[1:17:03] come I'm not saying you're wondering
[1:17:04] that way but I'm just saying your
[1:17:06] position is this that I'm the second
[1:17:08] coming of Jesus Christ and friends the
[1:17:11] thing is you're the door to salvation
[1:17:12] you're everything just like Esther take
[1:17:15] your position take your place what are
[1:17:18] you gonna do you're gonna turn around
[1:17:20] death remember that you remember the
[1:17:22] types because the thunders are in the
[1:17:24] types you remember ray up you remember
[1:17:26] Ruth you remember after all those every
[1:17:28] once those are our types that we look at
[1:17:30] what they become we're supposed to be
[1:17:32] God put a lot of people through a lot of
[1:17:34] things so we can actually look back and
[1:17:36] say what we're supposed to be amen
[1:17:38] that's what we are now watch this so the
[1:17:42] thing is is that we're supposed to
[1:17:44] worship in spirit and truth he says in
[1:17:46] matthew 15:8 this people draweth nigh
[1:17:48] unto me with their mouth and honors me
[1:17:51] with their lips but their heart is far
[1:17:54] me so they come to church they talk a
[1:17:58] good talk
[1:17:59] port a good quote that's all they're
[1:18:02] doing but watch what happen but in vain
[1:18:05] do they worship me
[1:18:07] so they're worshiping God but in vain
[1:18:09] they're worshiping them the people that
[1:18:13] are in vain worship Him are the ones
[1:18:15] that are not born again he says teaching
[1:18:18] for doctrines the commandments of men so
[1:18:23] there's two forms of worship one word
[1:18:26] from the lips mouth and one actually
[1:18:30] worship from their heart so you have all
[1:18:33] the religious demonstrations coming out
[1:18:36] but if you're not new birth here and
[1:18:39] don't do any good God doesn't accept
[1:18:42] your worship because the thing is is
[1:18:44] that he only worked he only takes the
[1:18:46] form of the ones that are truly born
[1:18:49] again by thy word by the word of this
[1:18:52] day the reveal were today
[1:18:54] now friends has been going to this and I
[1:18:56] just want you to just kind of show you a
[1:18:57] tape here because the thing is is that
[1:18:59] when we we want to look at this in a way
[1:19:02] that what's actually taking place in our
[1:19:05] name and you can follow through the
[1:19:06] scripture pretty good here
[1:19:08] the weight weight weight fails it but
[1:19:12] how that understanding here is that
[1:19:14] we're in a son of man ministry that's
[1:19:16] what we're under I just want to I want
[1:19:18] I'm trying to get a feel here where
[1:19:20] we're out here because in and I believe
[1:19:22] your talk well I'm not saying not what
[1:19:24] I'm trying to say to you sis it's under
[1:19:26] the son of man ministry there's a
[1:19:27] rapture that's what we're under right
[1:19:30] now is the son of man ministry after the
[1:19:33] order of melchizedek right does
[1:19:39] everybody understand what my cousin and
[1:19:40] I'm I'll just throw this out to you when
[1:19:41] Jesus came he was a son of man right he
[1:19:44] brings the Melchizedek order in what it
[1:19:47] was was everything that the everything
[1:19:49] that the the Levitical order was doing
[1:19:51] up to that time see God accepted but
[1:19:54] when Jesus the Melchizedek aim on the
[1:19:56] scene God refused that after now in this
[1:20:00] day in age a prophet comes right son of
[1:20:04] man ministry with a mouth category
[1:20:06] all the denominational ideas all the
[1:20:09] thinking all their opinions went out the
[1:20:11] window
[1:20:12] that's why friends a thing God does not
[1:20:14] wink and ignorance no more because the
[1:20:16] thing is the word has come back and its
[1:20:18] fullness amen
[1:20:20] so the word has come back and its
[1:20:22] fullness down and we're under the order
[1:20:23] of Melchizedek it's not a man ministry
[1:20:25] and the thing is in this is before the
[1:20:28] millennium and and the son of God came
[1:20:32] up but the son of man came down in that
[1:20:34] in that and that the timeframe were in
[1:20:36] right now to give us what to give us
[1:20:38] robbed Street faith to get us out of
[1:20:40] here everybody with me so far
[1:20:42] Amen know where we're gonna pick this up
[1:20:45] is look at the parallel here because
[1:20:48] there was actually a dispute in the
[1:20:49] first church in Acts chapter 15 and the
[1:20:53] thing is is that when we when we were
[1:20:55] looking at this I'll show you the type
[1:20:57] because the tabernacle of David because
[1:21:00] people don't think what was the time
[1:21:01] after they have David over built the
[1:21:03] tabernacle he did build the tabernacle
[1:21:04] and here's what James rises up then he
[1:21:08] says after they had held their peace
[1:21:10] James answers saying men and brethren
[1:21:12] hearken unto me Simeon hath declared out
[1:21:15] God the first invisi Gentiles to take
[1:21:17] out them a people for his name so what
[1:21:20] it is there's an argument in the first
[1:21:22] church so you remember there's Jews and
[1:21:25] there's Gentiles some of the Pharisee
[1:21:28] Jews came into the message in the first
[1:21:30] church and they're arguing to stay with
[1:21:33] the law of Moses you can't get saved
[1:21:36] without the law Moses first 15 and to
[1:21:39] this agree the words of the prophets as
[1:21:41] is written after this our return and I
[1:21:45] will build again the tabernacle of David
[1:21:47] which is falling down and I'll build
[1:21:48] again the ruins thereof and I'll set it
[1:21:51] up so in other words when they're
[1:21:53] disputing they're just meeting over long
[1:21:55] grace James stands up and says is going
[1:21:59] to be a restoration of the tabernacle of
[1:22:02] David and as we go down this I'll show
[1:22:05] you this is talking about us
[1:22:09] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:22:13] the bride see because the thing is they
[1:22:17] were these believed and Pharisees came
[1:22:19] along and they're trying to get the
[1:22:21] Gentiles to obey the law of Moses that
[1:22:24] are in the message and they're trying to
[1:22:27] get them this get circumcised they're
[1:22:29] trying to say you can't get saved
[1:22:30] without this and the thing is is that
[1:22:32] here James testifies concerning the
[1:22:35] Gentiles coming to Christ and actually
[1:22:38] he's speaking of Amos 9 verses 11 and 12
[1:22:41] and he's counting the company he's
[1:22:44] talking to them about the restoration of
[1:22:45] the tabernacle of David so the thing is
[1:22:48] is that the Gentiles are listening this
[1:22:50] Jews are in the church see it's a big
[1:22:52] mix-up because remember in Jerusalem see
[1:22:55] the Jews when they were coming in the
[1:22:57] church at the time and but they weren't
[1:22:59] saved and they're trying to bring the
[1:23:01] Gentiles to do than what they're doing
[1:23:03] under the customs of the Jews before the
[1:23:06] law of Moses so it says after this I'll
[1:23:09] return build up again the topography
[1:23:10] which is falling down I'll build again
[1:23:13] the rules thereof and I'll set it up so
[1:23:15] the Pharisees are trying to get the
[1:23:17] Gentiles to be under the law of Moses so
[1:23:21] what they're trying to do is actually
[1:23:23] trying to get them under the Levitical
[1:23:25] order of worship that's what they're
[1:23:27] trying to do now you say well that does
[1:23:30] have nothing to do with us and we'll
[1:23:31] show you here so James disputes and the
[1:23:35] thing is he's saying worship doesn't
[1:23:36] come by the Levitical order worship only
[1:23:40] comes by the Melchizedek order true
[1:23:43] worship only comes by that because in
[1:23:46] people's minds they said think David
[1:23:48] never had a taco but realize there was
[1:23:52] two Tabernacles in the time of David
[1:23:56] amen now watch this see because the
[1:24:00] thing is the tabernacle Moses was there
[1:24:03] erect at the same time the tabernacle of
[1:24:05] David and the tabernacle of Moses the
[1:24:09] one that had built in the wilderness the
[1:24:11] one that they had built in before they
[1:24:13] went in the promise and all those the
[1:24:15] problems and all those things this is a
[1:24:17] tabernacle that was built by Moses and
[1:24:20] put on the mount Gibeon and the thing is
[1:24:23] it was there they had their they had
[1:24:25] their priesthood they had the sacrifices
[1:24:28] that all the rituals and all those
[1:24:29] everything's they went through all the
[1:24:31] things but there was a town and I closed
[1:24:33] David that was being built or built in
[1:24:35] Jerusalem and the thing is how we look
[1:24:38] at this I want just concentrate on the
[1:24:40] unmount giving here for a moment where
[1:24:42] the where they had that Moses of are
[1:24:44] they the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:24:46] after Moses and just show you that there
[1:24:48] was there was a there was a there was a
[1:24:51] tabernacle there but there was one thing
[1:24:52] big that was missing in the tabernacle
[1:24:55] Moses and the one thing that was missing
[1:24:58] in the town of Moses was the Ark of the
[1:25:01] Covenant they had all the riches he had
[1:25:04] the priesthood there the high priests
[1:25:06] they had that they had that brazen altar
[1:25:08] they had the menorah that all those are
[1:25:09] all the things but they were coming to
[1:25:12] worship under ritualistic form but they
[1:25:17] had no Ark of the Covenant big thing
[1:25:22] right no washes for the tabernacle of
[1:25:26] the Lord which Moses made the Willetts
[1:25:29] the altar of the burnt offering were out
[1:25:30] at that season in the high place
[1:25:34] I give him so the tabernacle of Moses
[1:25:38] represented the Levitical order or the
[1:25:41] vertical priesthood that was actually
[1:25:43] obeying what they thought was the law of
[1:25:45] Moses and the thing is is that friends
[1:25:48] they had the outer court they had the
[1:25:50] hosts the Holies they had everything
[1:25:52] there like I said they're the showbread
[1:25:53] they're the menorah and all those they
[1:25:55] had everything there but they had no Ark
[1:25:58] of the Covenant so when they would bring
[1:26:01] a lamb to the do this this Tabernacle
[1:26:05] they would go through all the rituals
[1:26:08] but no Ark of the Covenant which is the
[1:26:10] most important thing that was the word
[1:26:13] because what was in the arc of the
[1:26:15] Covenant the law of Moses the rod of
[1:26:18] Aaron the manna and the thing is the rod
[1:26:21] but it bought it it brought forth fruit
[1:26:24] all those ever things it was alive so
[1:26:26] friends the thing is is that here they
[1:26:28] are they're worshiping without the Ark
[1:26:30] of the Covenant but God is not there
[1:26:33] so in their imaginations that are going
[1:26:35] to the altar or they're going to church
[1:26:37] so to speak or the tabernacle in their
[1:26:40] imaginations they're thinking that they
[1:26:42] are forgiven but there's no mercy seats
[1:26:44] because the Ark of the Covenant had the
[1:26:46] mercy where they sprinkle the blood on
[1:26:48] the mercy seat everybody with me so
[1:26:51] there was no mercy seat so they couldn't
[1:26:53] bring any blood but they watched the
[1:26:55] high priest go in behind the veil with
[1:26:58] the blood from the lamb that they'd come
[1:27:00] in and the lamb was slain they put in
[1:27:02] the charger and they'd swatch the high
[1:27:04] priest going behind the veil
[1:27:05] what was he sprinkling the blood on
[1:27:06] there was no Ark of the Covenant there
[1:27:09] was no mercy seats so there's no mercy
[1:27:11] seat there's no forgiveness but but that
[1:27:14] person would walk away from there in his
[1:27:17] imagination thinking that he's forgiven
[1:27:20] but the thing is he wasn't forgiving
[1:27:22] because there's no longer the Covenant
[1:27:23] there amen
[1:27:25] no washes Zadok well maybe I skipped
[1:27:31] over or maybe I didn't even get it on
[1:27:34] here I must have skipped it anyways in
[1:27:42] first chronicles 1639 says it's eight
[1:27:45] off the priest and his brethren the
[1:27:47] priests before the table of the Lord in
[1:27:49] the high place that was in Guinean so
[1:27:51] they sail off the priest so they had all
[1:27:52] the riches that all those different
[1:27:53] things but they had no Ark of the
[1:27:55] Covenant now understand this they have
[1:27:58] an order of worship just like many
[1:28:01] people come to church there's an order
[1:28:03] of worship but the thing is is there's
[1:28:06] no Ark of the Covenant in your heart
[1:28:08] there's no forgiveness for you that's
[1:28:11] the only way to be forgiven if you're
[1:28:14] born again brother Graham tells us
[1:28:17] you're not your name's not even
[1:28:18] recognized in heaven without the new
[1:28:20] birth I'm just saying what he said you
[1:28:24] take it up with him that's what he said
[1:28:26] that's why friends the thing is many
[1:28:28] people go through forms and rituals they
[1:28:31] believe the message they quote the
[1:28:32] message talk about the message but
[1:28:35] there's nothing there to reflect in
[1:28:37] heaven that they are actually a part of
[1:28:39] heaven because there's got to be you're
[1:28:42] flexing in your heart that you're a part
[1:28:44] of
[1:28:45] there's got to be something when he
[1:28:46] looks down he's got to see something in
[1:28:48] your heart to reflect it yeah I'm after
[1:28:51] the heaven I'm born of heaven I'm
[1:28:53] birthed from heaven I'm a daughter of
[1:28:56] God now washes in confers conical 15:1
[1:29:00] and David made him houses in the City of
[1:29:03] David I prepared the place for the Ark
[1:29:06] of God and pitched it for it a tent so
[1:29:10] here David of course king of the king of
[1:29:13] Israel he gets on his heart he wants to
[1:29:16] bring the Ark of the Covenant back to
[1:29:18] Jerusalem he doesn't have given on his
[1:29:21] mind he doesn't have knob on his mind he
[1:29:23] doesn't have Shiloh on his mind but he
[1:29:26] has Jerusalem Jerusalem is a type of
[1:29:29] Zion or the same word of Zion where it
[1:29:31] is IANA type of the bride so in this
[1:29:35] heart now remember the start of it
[1:29:39] because James stood up and disputed that
[1:29:41] God's gonna restore the tabernacle of
[1:29:43] David so this is all type through so
[1:29:47] David gets in his mind doesn't even know
[1:29:50] why he's doing her probably gets in his
[1:29:52] mind I'm gonna bring the Ark of the
[1:29:53] Covenant dock to Jerusalem because the
[1:29:56] thing is is that he he's thinking that's
[1:29:59] where we want to worship God now watch
[1:30:01] this second samuel chapter 5 verse 7
[1:30:05] nevertheless David took the stronghold
[1:30:07] was on and the same is the City of David
[1:30:10] so he builds a tent in the City of David
[1:30:13] and he puts the Ark of the Covenant
[1:30:15] there now what the difference was from
[1:30:19] the tabernacle that was in the City of
[1:30:20] David to the tabernacle that was built
[1:30:23] on Mount Gibeon was this the tabernacle
[1:30:28] of David only had one room there was no
[1:30:32] outer court there was no inner Court
[1:30:34] and there's no holy soli it only had one
[1:30:37] piece of furniture in that tower
[1:30:40] knuckled amen
[1:30:42] and every priest could go in that tent
[1:30:46] now remember I read you Revelation
[1:30:48] chapter 5 he's made us kings and priests
[1:30:54] [Applause]
[1:30:56] see the worshiper that went to the
[1:30:59] Tabernacle in the wilderness they had to
[1:31:02] starve us they couldn't go in behind the
[1:31:04] veil they had to stay away from there
[1:31:07] they had a worship God from afar off
[1:31:11] amen
[1:31:12] by the town and I called David you
[1:31:14] didn't have to do that now you've been
[1:31:16] made kings and priests in a tabernacle
[1:31:19] of David they could go in there and they
[1:31:22] can go behind before the Ark of the
[1:31:23] Covenant the blood was on the Mercy
[1:31:25] because the Ark of covenants there and
[1:31:27] they could worship God there they didn't
[1:31:29] have to go through the outer court
[1:31:31] they'd have to go through the inner
[1:31:32] court they'd go right into the holy
[1:31:34] Solly's now remember this time Michael
[1:31:37] is typing us we come to church we
[1:31:41] worship God we sing we have song books
[1:31:44] we have a preacher we have all these
[1:31:45] things as I show you this understand
[1:31:47] this trance what but James is actually
[1:31:50] speaking about is the endtime Church is
[1:31:54] the endtime bride no watch this first
[1:31:57] chronicles 16 1 so they brought the Ark
[1:32:00] of God set in the midst of the tent of
[1:32:02] David had pitched it and had pitched for
[1:32:05] it and they offered burnt sacrifices
[1:32:08] peace offerings before God so only one
[1:32:11] piece of furniture in this in this in
[1:32:13] this town Michael David was the Ark of
[1:32:15] the Covenant now you still have have
[1:32:17] have her to have the tabernacle of the
[1:32:19] wilderness I'm now giving on so they
[1:32:21] have three different courts in that
[1:32:24] tabernacle but in this one was only one
[1:32:26] and a sister and when David had made an
[1:32:29] end of offering the burnt offerings and
[1:32:31] the Peace offers he blessed the people
[1:32:34] in the name of Lord and he dug and he'd
[1:32:38] out to every one of Israel both man and
[1:32:40] woman to every one loaf of bread and a
[1:32:43] good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine
[1:32:45] no friends in the tabernacle of waters
[1:32:49] there's no way this could happen he's
[1:32:51] actually having observing communion to
[1:32:54] the women to the men everyone because
[1:32:58] remember we're called to true worship in
[1:33:01] this day
[1:33:03] they did so here was David he was a
[1:33:06] prophet he was a king and he was a
[1:33:08] priest he never had that anywhere else
[1:33:11] here was David raisin up in me what it
[1:33:14] is
[1:33:14] it's typing us that we are kings and
[1:33:17] priests see friends a thing is
[1:33:19] understand we're a prophetic people
[1:33:21] following a prophets message now let me
[1:33:26] just get so I don't want to go too far
[1:33:29] ahead but I understand where the light
[1:33:31] is today now we had a light bulb here
[1:33:36] called William Marion Brown 250 watt 300
[1:33:41] watt whatever but that light bulb had to
[1:33:44] be changed out to a bride's lake ball
[1:33:48] and had to be changed out so it was the
[1:33:52] changing of the light bulb the bride is
[1:33:54] the light now Reid look at this John the
[1:33:57] Baptist's from Jesus to the Upper Room
[1:34:00] was about five years three dispensations
[1:34:03] changed him from John the Baptist light
[1:34:05] bulb to Jesus light Bob to the Upper
[1:34:07] Room played ball if he did were in tune
[1:34:12] with what the Holy Spirit was actually
[1:34:13] doing you'd miss it because people say
[1:34:16] what is the light of this day and they
[1:34:17] hand out a message book no brother Brown
[1:34:19] says the light of the hour is when the
[1:34:22] word is manifested in flesh that will be
[1:34:27] the light of the day it can't be just on
[1:34:29] book for friends it can't be on tape
[1:34:31] it's got to be in you understand this
[1:34:35] friends we have to understand we have to
[1:34:38] have an identity if we have no identity
[1:34:42] friends where's our daddy didn't stop
[1:34:44] the denomination's or we're just a limbo
[1:34:47] or we're just a denomination so he doubt
[1:34:51] every one of his you're both man and
[1:34:53] woman to everyone a loaf of bread and a
[1:34:55] good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine
[1:34:57] and the appointed certain of the Levites
[1:35:00] the minister before the Ark of the
[1:35:01] Covenant and to record and thank and
[1:35:03] praise the Lord God of Israel
[1:35:06] in search wine serving communion to the
[1:35:11] women to the men singing praising
[1:35:15] worshiping where did you see an endtime
[1:35:18] message search but over on the other
[1:35:22] side say like the priest says priests
[1:35:25] breath his brethren in the priests
[1:35:28] before the tavern our Lord in the high
[1:35:30] place that wasn't giving so they still
[1:35:32] had their company and priests doing all
[1:35:34] the riches newer Haller forms and no
[1:35:36] arkla covered
[1:35:37] davis down in Jerusalem profit King
[1:35:40] priests serving communion because you
[1:35:44] never had that was not supposed to be in
[1:35:45] the Old Testament you remember what
[1:35:47] happened to use I what are you went in
[1:35:49] trying to be a priest
[1:35:50] he got leprosy but this is a tight for
[1:35:53] us to understand what so salmon in the
[1:35:55] end time see we're kings and priests the
[1:35:58] book was closed the book is open we
[1:36:00] preached from an open book now we don't
[1:36:03] preach from a closed book we preached
[1:36:04] from an open book where we can actually
[1:36:07] begin to identify who we are by
[1:36:10] revelation see friends that's what I'm
[1:36:12] saying you are the book of redemption
[1:36:15] see Friends of thing is all the names
[1:36:18] that the Adam was supposed to speak for
[1:36:20] first friends the thing is is now he's
[1:36:22] now the male Christ himself is speaking
[1:36:26] it through the bride in this day
[1:36:28] everybody that's on that books gotta be
[1:36:30] redeemed this is why this is such an
[1:36:32] important age and adoption age where we
[1:36:35] become matured we have the very
[1:36:37] attributes of the Living God we have a
[1:36:38] very care of Jessica because why there's
[1:36:40] a lot of things depending on us we got a
[1:36:43] lot of responsibility here that's why
[1:36:45] we're not just sitting around on the
[1:36:46] message pew info I'm noting yeah you're
[1:36:49] something if you're the bride you
[1:36:51] something we got a responsibility what's
[1:36:53] a responsibility yield yourself so the
[1:36:56] male can come in you and Nasus and south
[1:36:59] through your body
[1:37:01] hey now so watch this now in this
[1:37:06] tabernacle on Davis Tabernacle but I'm
[1:37:08] pretty dry up here but I don't know why
[1:37:11] I'm maybe it's the weather I don't know
[1:37:13] but it's moisture in the air here isn't
[1:37:15] there anyway so understand this
[1:37:21] and Davis Tabernacle one thing they had
[1:37:23] the time knock on the Willers didn't
[1:37:25] have worshiping praising you know how
[1:37:30] important worship is to the believer you
[1:37:34] understand that is the right approach to
[1:37:37] God at bore ship as part of it
[1:37:40] understand this is Tabernacle had
[1:37:42] worshiping and rejoicing going on 24
[1:37:46] hours seven days a week you understand
[1:37:50] when David set it up because friends
[1:37:52] they didn't have three things to go
[1:37:54] through to get into horse one-room
[1:37:57] tabernacle the Ark of the Covenant it no
[1:38:00] washes that's so the number of them that
[1:38:03] were brethren that were instructed in
[1:38:04] the songs of the Lord even all over
[1:38:07] cunning was 204 score and eight so 288
[1:38:12] priests twelve priests every hour would
[1:38:16] move off and worship before the Ark of
[1:38:19] the Covenant 12 hours worship 12 hours
[1:38:22] 24 hours seven days a week
[1:38:25] they just didn't wait for Sunday then
[1:38:29] just wait for Wednesday because if
[1:38:31] you're waiting for Sunday and Wednesday
[1:38:32] you're identified with with with the
[1:38:34] tabernacle the Wilmers because they
[1:38:37] symbolize the church ages we don't
[1:38:40] symbolize the church ages even though
[1:38:42] the lay on see in church ages here all
[1:38:45] around us but we're in the bride age see
[1:38:49] the Miocene churches tries to influence
[1:38:52] is to become cold formal dead but the
[1:38:56] bride age makes us alive makes us
[1:38:59] rejoice we are
[1:39:00] our life was a worship we get up in the
[1:39:03] morning we worship we go to bed at night
[1:39:04] were worse we're sleep on works
[1:39:06] that's a 24-hour seven-day-a-week
[1:39:08] worship so the number then that were
[1:39:10] brethren that were instructed in the
[1:39:11] songs of the Lord even Oliver kind was
[1:39:14] 204 score and 812 is a number of worship
[1:39:18] so every hour 12 men would be proven for
[1:39:22] the Ark of the Covenant they would move
[1:39:23] up so it was one hour shifts 212 24/7 on
[1:39:28] and on it would just continue perpetual
[1:39:31] it was worse it worship worship type in
[1:39:34] us friends desist because we go to bed
[1:39:36] at night friends the thing is we're not
[1:39:38] worship this because we're not in church
[1:39:39] this time because we're not where we
[1:39:40] worship when we go outside we worship
[1:39:43] when we go shopping we worship when we
[1:39:45] long vacations we worship all the time
[1:39:46] it's a 24 hour 7 worship because why is
[1:39:50] it friends the thing is it's God living
[1:39:52] in you know watch and these are the
[1:39:58] singers of the chief of the fathers of
[1:40:00] the Levites who remained the Chamber's
[1:40:02] were free they were employed that work
[1:40:05] day and night employed a night they were
[1:40:09] stiff they praise God
[1:40:11] friends a thing is that the who's going
[1:40:14] to who's going to carry the work of the
[1:40:16] Lord of this day it's gonna be the bride
[1:40:19] there's gonna be helps in the church is
[1:40:21] gonna be diversity again this is me all
[1:40:23] these type of things and friends the
[1:40:25] thing is is that weeds a continual
[1:40:26] worship but understand this is that
[1:40:28] friends it's not a ritualistic form some
[1:40:32] people go to church because it's
[1:40:33] realistic to think it matters it matters
[1:40:37] it matters that you come to your place
[1:40:40] your position in this day it matters it
[1:40:44] matters friends that you worship in
[1:40:45] spirit of truth because the thing is
[1:40:47] what does the Bible say bonus we're
[1:40:49] living sacrifices we're not dead we're
[1:40:53] living that's the thing in the Indians
[1:40:56] Tabernacle they went in there and they
[1:40:58] worship continuing 24/7 now watch this
[1:41:04] David comes the Psalms and he says this
[1:41:06] let me prayer let me let my prayer be
[1:41:09] set forth before thee as
[1:41:12] since and the lifting up of my hands as
[1:41:14] the evening sacrifice we're in the
[1:41:17] evening time are we not both about the
[1:41:21] clothes on but to go home oh right the
[1:41:23] bodies I'm watching for a bar change I

[1:41:43] gonna be out here I have an eternal life
[1:41:45] what is I'm birth here you realize if
[1:41:48] you die here tonight you die you

[1:42:04] brother Brown tells us he's even
[1:42:06] represented before the throne before it
[1:42:08] because it's the word body he said that
[1:42:09] word body was the Satan was made at the
[1:42:11] same time Jesus body was the theophany
[1:42:13] was made so that you got to see often he
[1:42:15] said they're telling you hurry up get
[1:42:17] the revelation see what it is that
[1:42:20] what's happening friends the thing is
[1:42:21] that God is trying to get us out of here
[1:42:23] but we're saying slow down God but
[1:42:26] realize this God will open up that
[1:42:28] scripture to you one day and it says
[1:42:30] it's time to come home see we're bombed
[1:42:33] by scripture because when God opens up
[1:42:36] the scripture your old boo-boo-boo the
[1:42:37] other here now watch this first
[1:42:39] Corinthians chapter 16 I'm just laying

[1:43:07] scripture that's what was James was
[1:43:08] saying when he stood up and we just feed
[1:43:10] it with with the Pharisees of the Jews
[1:43:13] that were in the mess of my day
[1:43:14] disputing with them
[1:43:15] we don't have to go that that's not
[1:43:17] where they're called for the Gentiles
[1:43:18] are called here to worship

[1:43:50] there anyway it's been broken that seal
[1:43:52] that seals and broken on you remember
[1:43:56] brother BAM tells us that the bride of
[1:43:58] Jesus Christ it's the ending of the
[1:44:00] ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:44:02] he also says if it's a Ministry of Jesus
[1:44:05] it's just a continuation of him from
[1:44:08] 2,000 years ago
[1:44:09] that's what he says about us I believe
[1:44:12] him
[1:44:14] amen no watch amen second Corinthians
[1:44:23] chapter 1 verse 3 so song and all a
[1:44:26] congregation with him went to the high
[1:44:27] place that was in Gibeon for there was a
[1:44:31] town round Congress of God which Moses
[1:44:33] the servant of Lord had made in the
[1:44:34] wilderness but the ark of the God had
[1:44:38] David brought up from Kathryn Jairam to
[1:44:42] the place which David had prepared for
[1:44:45] it for he had pitched a tent for it in
[1:44:47] Jerusalem so that's the tabernacle now
[1:44:51] let's just think about this what is it
[1:44:55] what did I say Corinthians chronicles
[1:44:59] sorry I'm not a professor on a
[1:45:03] theologian a my wife oh crap
[1:45:07] I make a lot of mistakes my wife says
[1:45:13] yeah you sure do so forgive me only the
[1:45:18] only only defense I have his brother
[1:45:20] branded too maybe brother Josh doesn't
[1:45:25] but I do but understand this the
[1:45:28] representation of this is that Davis
[1:45:33] Tabernacle which had the Ark of the
[1:45:34] Covenant the church ages are identified
[1:45:38] in the tabernacle of the wilderness and
[1:45:41] the thing is is that Solomon's Temple is
[1:45:44] identified over the millennia but in
[1:45:46] between there was the tabernacle of
[1:45:48] David to be restored as I read to you so
[1:45:52] understand that the thing is is that I'm
[1:45:54] not identified in the church ages I'm
[1:45:56] identified in David's Tabernacle that's
[1:46:00] where we got to be identified this is
[1:46:02] where we got to have an understanding of
[1:46:04] what called us why we're called to the
[1:46:08] new order of worship
[1:46:09] remember David is the one that made the
[1:46:12] new order
[1:46:14] he was prophet King and priests he
[1:46:19] called the new order now a lot of times
[1:46:21] we think it was brother brand that
[1:46:23] called this new order
[1:46:24] it wasn't brother brand it was Christ
[1:46:26] coming down in the fullness of the work
[1:46:29] and veiled himself in a prophet if I
[1:46:33] could say it this way so you can
[1:46:35] understand here was Jesus the body on
[1:46:37] the throne the spirit got up off that
[1:46:39] throne and came down and unveiled
[1:46:42] himself in a profit and that profit
[1:46:44] began to speak okay and what was that
[1:46:47] that was the order of Melchizedek and
[1:46:50] begin to speak and what was he doing he
[1:46:53] was setting up a new order of worship a
[1:46:55] new or praise
[1:46:57] I knew or and that was what David was
[1:46:59] doing David was setting up a newer it
[1:47:01] was it was an order that they know
[1:47:03] Israel never he knew nothing about
[1:47:04] before because they were used to the
[1:47:06] tabernacle in the world but here David
[1:47:08] sets up a new order so watch this again
[1:47:11] but for its second chronicles chapter 4
[1:47:13] chapter 1 verse 4 but the ark of the God
[1:47:16] had David
[1:47:17] to carry our rim to the place with Shiva
[1:47:20] David had prepared for it and he had
[1:47:23] pitched a tent fort in Jerusalem so he
[1:47:26] brings he brings he builds a tabernacle
[1:47:29] in Jerusalem one room house
[1:47:31] okay one room tent and puts the Ark of
[1:47:35] the Covenant and everybody could go in
[1:47:38] there and worship all the priests okay
[1:47:40] so God actually desire to be in Zion he
[1:47:44] actually desired to be in Jerusalem
[1:47:46] everybody with me now in Psalms 132
[1:47:51] verse 13 for the Lord have chosen Zion
[1:47:55] he had desire for his habitation this is
[1:47:59] my rest forever here I will dwell for I
[1:48:03] have desired so its desire which means
[1:48:07] wish for long for this is God's desire
[1:48:11] okay now brother Brown says this in
[1:48:14] future home it shall come to pass that
[1:48:17] he is left in Sion and he that's a
[1:48:20] remnant in Jerusalem shall be called
[1:48:22] holy even everyone there's written among
[1:48:24] the living and drew some seat wherein
[1:48:26] the Lord shall have washed away the
[1:48:28] filth of the daughters on then he says
[1:48:30] remember that's always the bright Zion
[1:48:34] is always the bride now let's read that
[1:48:37] scripture again for the Lord had chosen
[1:48:40] the bride he had desired her for his
[1:48:44] habitation
[1:48:45] she is my rest forever here will I dwell
[1:48:49] in her for I have desired her now you're
[1:48:54] sitting here today friends you're the
[1:48:57] bride he desires to dwell in you I don't
[1:49:03] know how much more clear I can get this
[1:49:04] to you he desires to be in you see
[1:49:08] friends the thing is when he's you know
[1:49:10] the pillar of fires here a pillar of
[1:49:11] fire never went when brother Baron went
[1:49:13] pillar of fire still here
[1:49:15] here four are still leading us a pillar
[1:49:17] of fire is something that indwells us
[1:49:20] the pillar of fire is something that is
[1:49:22] actually personified in the believer now
[1:49:26] watch
[1:49:27] now friends we were just talking about
[1:49:29] the old Jerusalem this is New Jerusalem
[1:49:31] I saw a new heaven and a new earth for
[1:49:35] the first seven the first Earth were
[1:49:37] passed away and there was no more sea
[1:49:39] and I John saw the holy city New
[1:49:42] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:49:44] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:49:46] her husband and I heard a great voice of
[1:49:49] heaven saying behold the tabernacle of
[1:49:52] God is with men the real translation is
[1:49:55] the title now God is in them and he will
[1:49:59] dwell with them and they shall be his
[1:50:01] people and God himself shall be with
[1:50:03] them and be their God that's you when I
[1:50:09] read this that's talking about me I'm
[1:50:12] identifying that remember Jesus brother
[1:50:16] BAM tell us how did he get his faith by
[1:50:19] identifying himself reading about
[1:50:21] himself remember he went to the grave on
[1:50:25] that scripture that I'll not leave my
[1:50:27] holy one being the grave in the in the
[1:50:29] grave for more than three days he went
[1:50:31] in the grave that because what does he
[1:50:34] believe that about himself we need to
[1:50:37] believe not I'm not talking intellectual
[1:50:39] here but understand friends who is this
[1:50:42] message for there's a call that whenever
[1:50:45] I earn the Seventh Seal it's called you
[1:50:48] and I that's my friends the thing is so
[1:50:51] many people you know let's take the five
[1:50:54] wives of the fives 5-volt foolish here
[1:50:56] the difference between them was the Holy
[1:50:59] Ghost we all know the story but you
[1:51:01] realize when Jesus talked that parable
[1:51:03] that those Jews that were standing there
[1:51:05] they knew exactly what he's talking
[1:51:06] about to us it was formed because it was
[1:51:08] an Eastern custom but you realized when
[1:51:11] those 10 virgins came out they all came
[1:51:13] at the call right midnight hour midnight
[1:51:16] hour call was was the message they all
[1:51:19] came out and you see people to gets
[1:51:22] excited by this message how do you
[1:51:23] praise God you mean um a few years down
[1:51:25] in there
[1:51:25] lukewarm called formal
[1:51:28] what happened what has happened because
[1:51:31] the five their five foolish the five
[1:51:34] what the five wise did because in those
[1:51:36] days what they would do the wise virgins
[1:51:38] they'd have a canister of oil here and
[1:51:41] it would keep their wits lit lit and
[1:51:45] keep it burning really good all the time
[1:51:46] the five foolish went out but they
[1:51:49] didn't have the Holy Ghost they had some
[1:51:50] burning there but it burns out and
[1:51:53] that's what's happening a lot of people
[1:51:55] in the message they're burning out
[1:51:56] because what is it they went out they
[1:51:59] and in the only difference between a
[1:52:01] Holy Ghost still a person and not
[1:52:03] another Holy Ghost fell person as far as
[1:52:04] the verses go is that they have no Holy
[1:52:07] Ghost that's the thing that that's the
[1:52:09] missing part but they might dress the
[1:52:10] part they might look the part they might
[1:52:12] do because friends it's not five
[1:52:14] and five five wise so camping
[1:52:18] denominational systems because God our
[1:52:20] God already looks at them that they're
[1:52:22] did not necessity domination so it's not
[1:52:24] vanity domination it's way in the
[1:52:26] message now friends the thing is that we
[1:52:29] if we look at some of these things these
[1:52:31] parables are stuff and bring it up to
[1:52:33] our place that's why you see the things
[1:52:35] that are happening in this message
[1:52:36] people are getting cold again formal
[1:52:38] they're getting powers then because in
[1:52:40] it and they might have been on fire and
[1:52:42] God for God for a couple years ago or
[1:52:43] last take they might have in front but
[1:52:45] now they're just dying off what is it no
[1:52:47] Holy Ghost see let me just put it this
[1:52:50] way there's a bride's revival
[1:52:52] there's church revival there's can't
[1:52:53] revive us the only revival the whole is
[1:52:56] the bride's revival because the bride's
[1:52:58] revival is return on not against Kent
[1:53:00] revivals I'm not against Church rather
[1:53:02] than against any of the friends it's
[1:53:04] great things the this person can come
[1:53:06] out of that but let me just assure you
[1:53:08] you watch it y'all young people that go
[1:53:10] to camps and they get on fire for God
[1:53:12] I'm not against camps don't don't pull
[1:53:14] me on this but they get on fire for God
[1:53:16] they come back in the local assembly and
[1:53:18] they're on fire for about one two weeks
[1:53:20] maybe three weeks maybe month to month
[1:53:22] and they just burn right out and what is
[1:53:24] it they got they had a camp revival I'm
[1:53:26] not not against uh but if they didn't
[1:53:28] have a broader survivor because the
[1:53:30] bride's revival will never burn out a
[1:53:32] bride's revival keep going on she'll
[1:53:35] stay steady she'll walk steady
[1:53:37] I've said he'll talk steady it just
[1:53:40] stays with them
[1:53:41] Francis ting is that we have to have an
[1:53:43] understanding is that this broad is
[1:53:45] destined to a body change no watch st.
[1:53:52] John 14 17 even the Spirit of Truth whom
[1:53:56] the world cannot receive because it
[1:53:58] seeth him not neither knows enough but
[1:54:01] II know him for II 12 in you and shall
[1:54:04] be in you was he did a fine God's

[1:54:25] nothing to do with the promise I might
[1:54:29] get sick and my body has nothing to do
[1:54:30] with the promise I'm still promised this
[1:54:34] this is for me friends if you don't want
[1:54:37] to take it go ahead and you don't take
[1:54:38] it but I'm taking it's for me it's
[1:54:40] what's spoken about me see friends the
[1:54:44] thing is is either were spoken brighter
[1:54:45] or not spoken bride but there's been a
[1:54:48] word spoken in this last days she will
[1:54:51] be like him there's been a word spoken
[1:54:54] about her see that she has the mind of
[1:54:57] Christ
[1:54:58] it's a spoken in this day that she will
[1:55:00] have thus saith the Lord or she'll keep
[1:55:05] quiet
[1:55:05] that's his spoken by us now friends we
[1:55:09] could put that off to someone I'm not
[1:55:11] saying you go around and you get up in
[1:55:13] the morning you have an orange juice oh
[1:55:15] they gave you or any think that I'm not
[1:55:16] talking about that you know that's
[1:55:18] beyond me I don't understand that but I
[1:55:20] do understand this that I'm overcome her
[1:55:22] by the grace of Almighty God I look at
[1:55:25] what my promises are I claim those
[1:55:27] promises because they're for me see this
[1:55:31] what friends of thing is is that when
[1:55:32] we're looking at some of these things
[1:55:33] here tonight I'm trying to get it
[1:55:35] conveyed to you that's a believer in
[1:55:37] this day's been called the true worship
[1:55:39] no other people have been called the
[1:55:42] true worship they might clap their hands
[1:55:44] they might sing that's not the worship
[1:55:46] I'm talking about but it's a worshiped
[1:55:48] from a new birth or a born-again art
[1:55:50] there's a worship coming from them they
[1:55:53] get up in the morning and God's just in
[1:55:55] awe that's my child oh that's my
[1:55:58] daughter they go to church and they're
[1:56:03] just thank you lord
[1:56:04] thank you God you look at other people I
[1:56:08] don't want to go to church I hate Church
[1:56:11] Oh friends maybe I'm staying I'm from a
[1:56:16] standpoint of being a preacher but I
[1:56:18] love the one to church I don't know I
[1:56:21] preach about this all the time is it
[1:56:23] back home is that friends the thing is
[1:56:25] that there's so many people they don't
[1:56:27] think that's that it's necessary to go
[1:56:29] to church it's almost a necessary evil
[1:56:30] to them and the only reason why they go
[1:56:32] to church is because brother band makes
[1:56:34] statements if you got the whole egos you
[1:56:36] can't wait til the doors are open and
[1:56:39] that I mean these are these are absolute
[1:56:42] boats that's the only reason to go to
[1:56:44] church but it's not in their heart to go
[1:56:45] to church there's nothing drawing than
[1:56:47] the church as the Friends of thing is
[1:56:50] that if we are not drawn to his word
[1:56:53] then what are we doing
[1:56:57] the bride is drawn to the word I'm drawn
[1:57:02] because the thing is is that the word
[1:57:03] drew me it looked for me I'm not doing
[1:57:07] this under my power I'm doing this under
[1:57:08] his power at the end of the day at the
[1:57:11] end of the day you'll pat me on the back
[1:57:12] say good job but it's all him that did
[1:57:14] it uh-huh so here we have the to not to
[1:57:19] have an answer to set up side-by-side
[1:57:20] and our friends the thing is we had one
[1:57:22] of those army of them one no give him
[1:57:25] and then I'm now giving yeah I'm Mel
[1:57:27] Gibeon they have all the rich shows all
[1:57:29] the forms everything they're doing all
[1:57:31] the things that the law of moses that
[1:57:32] but mount now in zion they're having a
[1:57:35] real grand old revival they're
[1:57:37] worshiping they're praising god all
[1:57:39] those different things and friends the
[1:57:40] thing is that here we had David come in
[1:57:43] and he makes another priesthood he makes
[1:57:46] a priesthood built after the tabernacle
[1:57:48] of David now listen to me here for a
[1:57:50] second here see the Ark of the Covenant
[1:57:53] should be really important to us I'm
[1:57:55] talking about the word I'm talking about
[1:57:57] the word I'm not talking about the
[1:57:58] physical time
[1:57:59] word it's because the thing is that this
[1:58:02] is this is why it's so important to
[1:58:04] understand this the Ark of the cotan had
[1:58:06] the word in it but also had the rod in
[1:58:09] it what did the rod represent it
[1:58:12] represented Aaron's rod the priesthood
[1:58:14] that actually bought it it actually
[1:58:19] actually had life in it it restored it
[1:58:23] was a restoration you realized the true
[1:58:27] fivefold ministry in this day she should
[1:58:30] be button she should be getting bringing
[1:58:32] forth fruit I'm talking about in the
[1:58:34] people because what is it it's the
[1:58:36] preaching of the word and people are
[1:58:39] around the word amen we cannot bypass
[1:58:44] God's word amen friends I was just
[1:58:50] preaching here on the new cart where
[1:58:52] David come brain builds a new cart and
[1:58:54] tries to bring back to roo some of the
[1:58:56] Ark of the Covenant and the thing is
[1:58:58] brethren says a very specific quite a
[1:59:00] few times they tried to bypass his word
[1:59:03] you realize I don't know if you had the
[1:59:05] trouble around here but we got the
[1:59:07] trouble in Edmonton people are saying
[1:59:09] that the ministry has failed you realize
[1:59:14] what brother brems said about that he
[1:59:16] says when the people begin to say that
[1:59:18] the ministries felt it's the gainsaying
[1:59:21] of korah they're actually fulfilling the
[1:59:25] gainsaying of korah now let me just say
[1:59:27] it this way Korah and dates that were
[1:59:29] not after Moses you won't read that in
[1:59:34] the Bible they Moses office was already
[1:59:37] established that's not what they are
[1:59:40] after they're after Aaron's position
[1:59:42] they're after the ministry what's
[1:59:44] happening around the message in this day
[1:59:46] as people are saying the ministry is
[1:59:49] failed and brother ben says when they
[1:59:50] begin to say that it's the gainsaying of
[1:59:53] korah check it up as a church age book
[1:59:57] to page 291
[1:59:58] I understand friends they they'll start
[2:00:01] beginning to say these things so that
[2:00:03] friends we're to do is it justifies
[2:00:05] themselves and what they do they begin
[2:00:08] to bring bring the quotes together
[2:00:09] themselves
[2:00:11] and they begin to build a golden calf
[2:00:12] before the people ball does DD right so
[2:00:18] they take quotes and build a golden calf
[2:00:20] words that going calf going to lead them
[2:00:22] right back to Egypt is happening more
[2:00:25] and more and more but the bride led
[2:00:28] under the ministry or the administration
[2:00:30] of this prophet brought in this day
[2:00:31] remember Joshua took him over in the
[2:00:34] Promised Land
[2:00:35] and remember Joshua gave the inherence
[2:00:38] to the priesthood the priests went to
[2:00:40] the people and divvied up the
[2:00:41] inheritance that was the protocol but
[2:00:44] people don't want to go off to the
[2:00:46] patterns by the pattern of God anymore
[2:00:48] they want to do their own thing we're
[2:00:50] not called to do her own thing we're
[2:00:52] only called to live the word follow the
[2:00:54] word the word will lead us amen no
[2:00:57] washes sorry I hope I'm not born you're
[2:01:02] too long here but just just I'm kind of
[2:01:05] scattered a little bit but I'm just
[2:01:06] trying to get my thought down here and
[2:01:08] we'll pick it up tomorrow night again
[2:01:10] here now actually chapter 45 verse 21
[2:01:12] alright gonna come thou shall put the
[2:01:15] mercy seat above above upon the earth
[2:01:17] and the ark thou shalt put the testimony
[2:01:19] that I shall give thee and there I'll
[2:01:21] meet thee I'll commune with thee
[2:01:23] from above the mercy in between the two
[2:01:25] chairman's which are upon the Ark of the
[2:01:28] testimony that was the only place that
[2:01:31] God said they would meet him right who
[2:01:34] had the Ark of the Covenant David had
[2:01:36] the Ark of the Covenant but they still
[2:01:38] had they saw the ritualistic form on
[2:01:41] Mount Gibeon not this time but you know
[2:01:44] what I've been reading you so I
[2:01:46] understand this is and we can follow
[2:01:49] this rate to description we're going to
[2:01:50] then the New Testament here right away
[2:01:52] and I'll probably leave it there but I
[2:01:55] understand this is that the Ark of the
[2:01:59] Covenant what was in the Ark of the
[2:02:00] Covenant was the word the the rod of
[2:02:05] Aaron the but it brought forth fruit and
[2:02:07] the manna that never aged we're in that
[2:02:12] mist right now we every believer with
[2:02:16] the Holy Ghost feel believe every every
[2:02:18] every bride member or everybody that
[2:02:21] works it has to be working
[2:02:22] God is birth under this so you don't
[2:02:26] need to go to a priest to get
[2:02:29] forgiveness of sins you go to the high
[2:02:32] priest yourself now let's just bring
[2:02:35] this up into the New Testament here and
[2:02:37] we'll shut her down here tonight and
[2:02:39] I'll bring out Lord willing tomorrow
[2:02:40] night the Melchizedek quarter but watch
[2:02:43] Matthew 27 verse 51 and behold the veil
[2:02:48] the temple was rent in twain from top to
[2:02:50] bottom and the earth did quake and the
[2:02:54] rocks rent now norse is the setting here
[2:02:58] of course we know this is Jesus being
[2:03:01] crucified on Mount Calvary
[2:03:03] and the crucifixion took place at the
[2:03:06] time of the Passover we all know that
[2:03:08] right so mark 14 verse 12 and the first
[2:03:13] day of the unleavened bread when they
[2:03:15] killed the Passover the disciples said
[2:03:18] on DIMM where wilt thou that we go and
[2:03:21] prepare that thou mayst eat the passover
[2:03:24] so remember I went from the Old
[2:03:26] Testament were going the New Testament -
[2:03:29] Tabernacles setup side-by-side again no
[2:03:33] washes now I'd been a very weary nervous
[2:03:36] day and it was an unusual day we find
[2:03:39] Jesus here coming up to Jerusalem ready
[2:03:41] to attend the Passover and the Passover
[2:03:44] is where the Paschal Lamb was killed and
[2:03:45] the blood was spread upon the mercy seat
[2:03:48] for the atonement for the people so
[2:03:51] notice the vay the temple veil was rent
[2:03:55] right from top to bottom the mercy seat
[2:03:58] was not inside that temple behind the
[2:04:03] veil no Ark of the Covenant it was taken
[2:04:08] in the time of Babel omen or Babylon 5
[2:04:11] and 86 when Nebuchadnezzar went into
[2:04:13] Jerusalem and destroyed Jerusalem so all
[2:04:17] these years they were worshipping under
[2:04:19] false worship at the time of the
[2:04:22] Passover there would be about 2 million
[2:04:24] male Jews would go to Jerusalem with
[2:04:27] their lamb for sacrifice so the priests
[2:04:30] would get their lamb slit open the lamb
[2:04:33] drain the blood another charger the
[2:04:35] priest would go
[2:04:36] into behind the veil but there's no
[2:04:39] blood all right no Ark of the Covenant
[2:04:41] so there's no blood to be be put on the
[2:04:44] mercy seat and what was God doing
[2:04:46] ripping over the veil of that what they
[2:04:51] would call whole is the hoist
[2:04:52] to show there's no mercy seat behind
[2:04:54] them but the true mercy seat was hanging
[2:04:57] on the cross so there's two Tabernacles
[2:05:01] once again one in Jesus where the true
[2:05:05] worshipper would go and the one behind
[2:05:07] the veil that there was no Ark of the
[2:05:09] Covenant there so understand this
[2:05:12] friends well God was trying to show us
[2:05:14] that there was no pillar far behind that
[2:05:15] veil once again false false worship now
[2:05:19] let me just bring it down here real
[2:05:21] quick he says the veil was rent that God
[2:05:26] might be manifest the unveil God
[2:05:29] plainview they should have seen him
[2:05:31] standing there yet he was too common it
[2:05:33] was an ordinary man ordinary man they
[2:05:36] couldn't see it see they there stood a
[2:05:38] man well they said this guy that school
[2:05:41] did he come from but remember when that
[2:05:43] spear struck his body that spirit left
[2:05:45] him the temple the sacrifice blocks
[2:05:47] turned over and lightning whipped down
[2:05:49] through the temple and rent the veil
[2:05:51] what was it
[2:05:52] there was their God hanging on Calvary
[2:05:54] and they were too blind to see it so
[2:05:58] those blind Israelites standing there
[2:06:00] their whole religion was based on God
[2:06:04] given the law they based it on
[2:06:06] worshipping God all those things no Ark
[2:06:09] of the Covenant so the man would go up
[2:06:11] there in his imagination he walked away
[2:06:13] thinking that his sins were covered but
[2:06:16] no rocker becoming behind the veil but
[2:06:18] the one that was on the cross that was
[2:06:20] the tabernacle that was the true where
[2:06:23] the true worshiper should be amen
[2:06:25] so two Tabernacles two high priests high
[2:06:29] priests cathetus and high priest Jesus
[2:06:33] amen
[2:06:34] ever how you want to type in out watch
[2:06:36] this brought him an open view still they
[2:06:38] don't see it they are blind that God
[2:06:40] failed a human being how God could have
[2:06:42] mercy on foul sinners is us when he hid
[2:06:45] himself as a mystery and now it's in
[2:06:46] plain view or
[2:06:48] full view reveal buzzwords is always the
[2:06:50] word coffee that is gone
[2:06:52] it's the word that opens it up if those
[2:06:54] people would have known the Word of God
[2:06:56] that day when Jesus died they would have
[2:06:58] seen the mercy seat he was the mercy
[2:07:03] seat I was in that mercy seat you were
[2:07:07] in that mercy seat but friends the thing
[2:07:09] is the brother branham was identified
[2:07:11] where that mercy seat was everybody with
[2:07:15] me I'm going to be closing here don't
[2:07:17] worry I won't be all night here maybe
[2:07:19] another two hours all right
[2:07:21] who was what did the veil rent remember
[2:07:26] was death to go into it no more he could
[2:07:28] see it Moses saw it in the form it was a
[2:07:30] world it was a man's mouth well here it
[2:07:32] is I bleed him back the same in what was
[2:07:34] God wanted to show them mercy see ya
[2:07:38] what God wanted to show them the mercy
[2:07:40] God wanted them to show them who he was
[2:07:42] so the veil of the mers merged in the
[2:07:44] temple from the hand of God above was
[2:07:46] rent from the top to the bomb show God
[2:07:48] in plain view it was Jesus Christ
[2:07:51] hanging on the cross the mercy seats so
[2:07:55] they're still going through their
[2:07:56] sacrifices they're doing all the rituals
[2:07:59] they're doing hauler form and they're
[2:08:00] working they're praising God we know
[2:08:02] that they were seeing Psalms 22 and here
[2:08:06] the mercy seat was on the cross hang in
[2:08:08] there so here we have to try out
[2:08:10] Michaels again one of ritualistic and
[2:08:12] one of true worship now my question is
[2:08:16] which one you worshiping huh which one
[2:08:21] you worshiping here tonight because he
[2:08:24] understand this Jesus being the true
[2:08:27] temple the word now where's that word
[2:08:31] now that word isn't us now if I open up
[2:08:36] my mouth and said to you this day this
[2:08:39] scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[2:08:40] Who am I talking about
[2:08:45] you present word Jesus Christ is saying
[2:08:50] yesterday today and forever see friends
[2:08:54] the thing is that if we don't see
[2:08:56] ourselves brother Graham tells us his
[2:08:58] greatest curse to the church is people
[2:09:00] don't recognize who they are and
[2:09:03] understand this is that when Jesus said
[2:09:05] in st. John 2:19 jesus answered said
[2:09:07] unto them it destroy this temple and in
[2:09:09] three days I'll raise it up he knew who
[2:09:12] he was he knew he was called by the word
[2:09:15] he knew friends the thing is we got to
[2:09:17] understand this he grew in wisdom and
[2:09:19] stature the pattern was shown and used
[2:09:21] same way we're growing in wisdom stature
[2:09:24] are we not you are Germans I see now if
[2:09:28] there's some things I could say to you I
[2:09:30] just want to hold back here for a minute
[2:09:32] here but I understand this you're the
[2:09:34] true tabernacle of Jesus Christ tonight
[2:09:38] you don't want friends if we if we could
[2:09:43] just grasp some of these things we've
[2:09:46] seen a prophet a mighty prophet in this
[2:09:48] day Malachi 4 brought us back to the
[2:09:51] Apostolic fathers because remember this
[2:09:54] in closing here we're supposed to be
[2:09:56] brother ben says the pattern of every
[2:09:58] church ghost but for the true church at
[2:10:01] the day of Pentecost so he says the
[2:10:03] church is booked if we could take an old
[2:10:06] First Church age Church and put it up
[2:10:09] right beside us we should be the same no
[2:10:14] difference Omega Alpha and Omega right
[2:10:17] and the thing is that they identify
[2:10:20] themselves because they seen themselves
[2:10:22] in what the word says now I'm gonna say
[2:10:26] something here and I'll explain it with
[2:10:28] Lord willing Sunday morning when G or
[2:10:32] Peter when Peter said this day this
[2:10:36] Christmas's fulfilled when he was when
[2:10:37] he said this is this is joel 2:28 he
[2:10:42] identified himself in the scripture do
[2:10:45] you realize he didn't say Calvary he
[2:10:47] didn't talk about Jesus he didn't talk
[2:10:49] about any of that what he did he
[2:10:51] identified himself this is that
[2:10:56] that joel 2:28 uh uh he later on they
[2:11:00] identified who Jesus was in the Calvary
[2:11:02] and all this but what I'm trying to tell
[2:11:04] you is they identify themselves friends
[2:11:07] the thing is we identify ourselves now
[2:11:10] as bride bridegroom form bride form
[2:11:16] Jesus Christ two thousand years ago
[2:11:18] Jesus Christ now this day this scripture
[2:11:23] is fulfilled in your ears let's stand
[2:11:25] amen hallelujah I hope and I was kind of
[2:11:32] scattered here no one not knowing where
[2:11:34] I was gonna stop but I think that's good
[2:11:36] be good to stop now because the thing is
[2:11:38] while bring it out tomorrow night a
[2:11:39] little bit more both the order of
[2:11:41] melchizedek because understand this is
[2:11:44] that through this understanding of this
[2:11:47] of who Jesus is of course he allowed us
[2:11:50] to have a new living way he set up a new
[2:11:53] way that the Old Testament Saints
[2:11:56] couldn't understand you realize friends
[2:11:59] in the Old Testament and let's let's
[2:12:02] even bring it up to our day present day
[2:12:03] there's a lot of Old Testament Saints
[2:12:05] around Old Testament Saints is this that
[2:12:09] they don't really truly believe in the
[2:12:12] grace of Almighty God work in their
[2:12:14] lives because if you truly believe what
[2:12:16] the grace has done for it you will
[2:12:18] personify him more you know why because
[2:12:21] you're allowing him to take control but
[2:12:25] when we sit there and say we have to do
[2:12:27] this we have to do that we have to do
[2:12:28] this we have to do that friends none of
[2:12:30] that will count the only thing that will
[2:12:32] count is what you allow him to do
[2:12:34] through you amen so allow him to do
[2:12:38] things through you allow him that
[2:12:40] preeminence how where do you do die
[2:12:43] that's that's all I know it's died out
[2:12:45] he said how do you die just died your
[2:12:48] own opinion your own thoughts see
[2:12:51] friends we're always giving our own
[2:12:52] appeaser our own thoughts but just die
[2:12:54] out to yourself just say Lord you're the
[2:12:57] only thing that matters amen let's just

[2:19:27] hey man thank God for his word
[2:19:30] a man faith comes by hearing the word
[2:19:33] and not with your ears but with the ear
[2:19:36] of the soul a man has got to be single
[2:19:39] let your eye be single you know that all
[2:19:42] these things be single but it says let
[2:19:43] you got to let your hearing be single a
[2:19:45] man and when it comes to the natural the
[2:19:48] prophet of God said a lot of lot of any
[2:19:50] citizen schools here if it's
[2:19:51] intellectual it goes in one ear you know
[2:19:53] the other and it buddy big if your area
[2:19:56] with the ear of the soul it's going to
[2:19:58] go in and stay in your soul it's going
[2:20:01] to accomplish the will of God in your
[2:20:02] soul by the grace of God you're born
[2:20:05] again by the word but be remembering
[2:20:08] this it's got to be it's got to be by
[2:20:12] divine law a relationship of divine love
[2:20:16] since the scripture says and though I
[2:20:18] have the gift of prophecy and understand
[2:20:22] all mysteries and all knowledge and
[2:20:25] though I have all faith so that I could
[2:20:28] remove mountains and have not divine
[2:20:31] love I am nothing brothers brought it
[2:20:36] out concerning the believer and the make
[2:20:38] believer a man the believer is motivated
[2:20:42] by divine law in the prophecy motivator
[2:20:46] is motivated by David are true believers
[2:20:48] motivated by divine love in the
[2:20:50] understanding of all mysteries and all
[2:20:52] knowledge and faith of a mountains a man
[2:20:56] you do it for the glory of God a man I
[2:20:59] just saw a selfish motive or objective
[2:21:02] no but for the glory of God a man if not
[2:21:06] then we are nothing so again I brought
[2:21:10] that to your attention just recently
[2:21:12] concerning first Corinthians 13
[2:21:15] because we're we're gonna have this
[2:21:17] faith or I got this faith and I got that
[2:21:19] feat but do we have divine love the part
[2:21:24] of God's that God permitted all that's
[2:21:25] gone on and it's going on he said to
[2:21:28] reveal himself so that we would love him
[2:21:30] for himself amen
[2:21:32] seeing the revelation seeing what God
[2:21:35] has done seen what God is doing he says
[2:21:37] you're gonna love him for himself by the
[2:21:40] grace of Almighty God I trust that if
[2:21:44] they're going further the word a man
[2:21:47] there's revelation hallelujah there's
[2:21:50] understanding the revelation of God
[2:21:53] revelation of God dealing with his sons
[2:21:56] and daughters the revelation of God
[2:21:58] bringing out a doubt of that he'd bring
[2:22:00] it out another bride a man that old
[2:22:04] brother it'll be a bright that loves you
[2:22:06] and he said to Peter lovest thou me more
[2:22:09] than these praise the name of the Lord I
[2:22:12] trust her we're in that temple with the
[2:22:15] relationship of love with our Lord Jesus
[2:22:18] Christ
[2:22:19] so I pray God may the Holy Ghost take
[2:22:21] what was preached tonight and put it
[2:22:23] down into your heart and into your soul
[2:22:25] a million is not gonna be knowledge that
[2:22:27] you will leave here and walk out amen no
[2:22:30] it's gonna be revelation it's gonna be
[2:22:32] life it's gonna be the greater
[2:22:35] revelation of Christ that's gonna go
[2:22:37] with you a greater oneness with Christ
[2:22:39] that you're going to have by the grace
[2:22:42] of Almighty God but you don't know how
[2:22:45] God helped us not not don't let us fall
[2:22:47] back to religion like all the rest have
[2:22:49] done and many are doing even around the
[2:22:51] message just and our brother brought it
[2:22:53] out just coming to church because it is
[2:22:55] a ritual religious ritual and although
[2:22:58] the bride is coming get closer to her
[2:23:00] bridegroom the writers coming to get
[2:23:03] more in the likeness of her bridegroom
[2:23:04] the right is coming to become more one
[2:23:07] with her bridegroom to ever have a more
[2:23:09] intimate relationship with our
[2:23:11] bridegroom by the grace of Almighty God
[2:23:14] amen so I pray grace they got it God is
[2:23:18] and God will use
[2:23:20] industry of the word tonight and again
[2:23:22] for Saturday and Sunday through our
[2:23:24] brother amen to magnify the relationship
[2:23:28] that he is working on with his right the
[2:23:32] prophet of God said he has come back to
[2:23:34] be the brain and he said the bride is
[2:23:37] the Omega a man that's good I like that
[2:23:40] the verifier that brother brought it out
[2:23:43] he said a pillar of fire didn't call
[2:23:45] when the problem left non huh hey man
[2:23:47] the Velo fire is still there in you and
[2:23:50] me a man
[2:23:52] it's Christ is the invisible union of
[2:23:55] the bride and the bridegroom the
[2:23:57] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[2:23:59] bright god help us that brother that
[2:24:02] root faith is more real to us than just
[2:24:05] knowledge intellectual knowledge
[2:24:07] oh I praise more real to you than the
[2:24:11] leaders of this country or any other
[2:24:12] country a man is more real to you by the
[2:24:17] grace of God than the natural things of
[2:24:20] life god help us brother
[2:24:23] things yanked in my heart and I might
[2:24:25] want preach but to highlight a couple of
[2:24:31] things that our brother said now I get
[2:24:33] he was referring to God and Cain good
[2:24:37] that was good they're in the state
[2:24:39] they're in the same church and I have
[2:24:41] preached on which church would you add
[2:24:42] in well which altar would you go to you
[2:24:46] know Cain's older or Abel's altar ain't
[2:24:49] man this is amazing but I want you to
[2:24:54] notice this to what we brought out the
[2:24:56] Cain was condemned not for what he did
[2:25:02] before what he didn't do because the
[2:25:05] because the Bible says if thou doest
[2:25:07] well once you also be accepted and many
[2:25:11] are going to lose their salvation
[2:25:12] they're going to go to hell now because
[2:25:14] of what they did but because of what
[2:25:16] they didn't do a man because God Himself
[2:25:19] said to Cain if thou would do as well
[2:25:22] what you also be accepted a man so I
[2:25:26] pray God will judge ourselves by the
[2:25:28] word tonight is there anything that God
[2:25:30] is revealing to us that we didn't do
[2:25:33] that we should have done but didn't do
[2:25:35] for him and for the glory of God and for
[2:25:39] one another a man that this is amazing
[2:25:42] like like the like again like the the
[2:25:45] that went in and washed Jesus feet
[2:25:47] and as similar Simon the believers are
[2:25:51] the the Pharisee there Jesus says he
[2:25:53] said look he said you ever done this I
[2:25:55] come here you never even washed my feet
[2:25:57] and so on and though it's a tradition
[2:26:00] and so on but you didn't do it he was
[2:26:02] condemned for what he didn't do not for
[2:26:04] what he did that's right and then and
[2:26:08] and the render and the the she was
[2:26:13] forgiven and she wasn't condemned for
[2:26:15] what she did she was blessed for what
[2:26:18] she did do a man what God wanted her to
[2:26:22] do by the grace of God so let's do what
[2:26:26] God wants us to do a man not doing
[2:26:29] what's right in our own eyes
[2:26:30] no no by doing what's right in the eyes
[2:26:33] of God
[2:26:36] and leave you with this saw - oh yes
[2:26:40] thank God our brothers bringing that
[2:26:42] revelation out going from John to Jesus
[2:26:45] to the upper room good is making it more
[2:26:48] clear now what's going on giving us more
[2:26:51] understanding as to what God is doing a
[2:26:53] man I like that because there's too many
[2:26:56] God sent a prophet and the problems gone
[2:26:58] now we're waiting for this waiting for
[2:27:00] that they're waiting for what God is
[2:27:02] doing and and they don't recognize what
[2:27:04] he's doing that's good a man made the
[2:27:07] Lord can do to bless our brother
[2:27:08] bringing out making him more clear
[2:27:10] that's good going from one time when I
[2:27:12] come to another one well I trust for in
[2:27:14] the early Tabernacles a man now I just
[2:27:18] in the right time when akka but with the
[2:27:20] right worship a man in the in the right
[2:27:22] spirit that's good a man a good
[2:27:25] Revelation John to Jesus to the Upper
[2:27:28] Room and of course he going from brother
[2:27:30] plant him to Jesus to the bride a man
[2:27:34] and and again he's right the Alpha and
[2:27:37] the Omega being the same that's good I
[2:27:40] like that revelation but now he's great
[2:27:42] he's making it more clear
[2:27:43] I trust you'd be more serious with it
[2:27:47] that scripture that he read and started
[2:27:50] with we are kings and priests go out and
[2:27:58] conduct yourself as a king and a priest
[2:28:03] that's just as tremendous beyond the
[2:28:07] kings of this world beyond the
[2:28:10] priesthood of this world this is this is
[2:28:13] royalty all brothers sister goat and
[2:28:17] love the Lord and live for the Lord do
[2:28:20] what you can for him and for his
[2:28:22] children and then and then his body oh
[2:28:24] my this is wonderful
[2:28:26] that's good I like that brother
[2:28:32] yeah see righto concerning their the
[2:28:34] right approach to God worship and they
[2:28:37] worship 24 hours a day that's good I had
[2:28:44] to go check the script
[2:28:46] and that it that he was mentioning and
[2:28:49] write it down he worshiped what they
[2:28:52] were so 24 hours a day take you take him
[2:28:55] their their time and so on and then what
[2:28:58] the Bible tells us in the New Testament
[2:29:01] pray without ceasing a man God elvis is
[2:29:07] my in my prayer that we're going to hear
[2:29:10] that word and let it convict us in our
[2:29:12] hearts in our souls that work when lord
[2:29:15] help me to pray without ceasing help me
[2:29:18] Lord to recognize Who I am
[2:29:20] and that Lord to recognize the
[2:29:23] tabernacle that I am in and what you
[2:29:25] require me in this tabernacle grace
[2:29:29] grace grace brother the problem made
[2:29:32] mention the invisible you know the
[2:29:36] heavenly bragged on the earthly bride
[2:29:42] he's having an intimate relationship
[2:29:44] with her and he's reproducing the word
[2:29:47] in her and through her praise the Lord
[2:29:51] grace that there will be a virgin birth
[2:29:54] of the word in the right grace let me
[2:30:00] just read this scripture there's others
[2:30:02] too he brought about Cora good and the
[2:30:12] scripture is of course Jude
[2:30:15] and he said well unto them for they have
[2:30:17] gone in the way of King brother not only
[2:30:22] then but now and what is it to go in the
[2:30:28] way of King it means to oppose God and
[2:30:32] God's leadership you're not going to
[2:30:36] follow God's leadership they're gonna do
[2:30:40] what they feel to do religiously and all
[2:30:43] you better come back to the word sources
[2:30:46] they have gone in the way of Cain and
[2:30:49] they have ran greedily after the error
[2:30:52] of Balaam what was the error of Balaam
[2:30:56] it was human reasoning trying to
[2:30:59] convince the people
[2:31:00] the Jews that were all the same with the
[2:31:03] other race out there we're all the same
[2:31:06] it was human reasoning and there's human
[2:31:11] reasoning being used around this message
[2:31:12] today we got to leave it to thus saith
[2:31:15] the Lord it is written don't reason and
[2:31:19] that says they have perished in the
[2:31:23] gainsaying of korah
[2:31:25] and what was the gainsaying of korah
[2:31:27] they were denying God's authority
[2:31:30] brother god help us that we're going to
[2:31:34] be the sons and daughters of God and
[2:31:36] going beyond that to the Bride of Christ
