[38:55] one sing sing here healer you hold my
[38:59] every moment amen
[39:02] you could stack them up against any
[39:05] group I just want to thank the Lord for
[39:08] that it was sung in our tremendous
[39:09] anointing and it was sung with
[39:13] revelation so we thank the Lord for that
[39:15] and the kids you know was just it was
[39:19] always a blessing to see the kids up
[39:20] there and I was thinking I'm looking at
[39:22] that deductr I think way back not
[39:26] everybody was here with you remember
[39:28] some of us remember when we did that I
[39:30] think was a Christmas time I've done on
[39:32] famous Road and remember that and Matt
[39:35] was only at that time and he stole - oh
[39:37] yeah still succeed on the show I guess
[39:41] but anyway we thank the Lord for that
[39:45] amen God has been good to us amen
[39:48] this was impressed upon me for a while
[39:51] to sing so if we just want to remember
[39:55] that God is in control of every moment
[39:57] of our lives and every need we have and
[40:01] he all we have to do is trust him all we
[40:04] had to do was believe him and when he
[40:06] rose 2,000 years ago sickness was done
[40:09] away with in his mind
[40:12] we were already healed so if you have a
[40:14] need this morning just hold it there on
[40:16] your heart and that God ministered
[40:18] through the rammer said you can be
[40:22] healed in music through music
[40:24] to the songs of Zion so it's my faith so
[40:27] let's sing that this morning as brother

[47:31] [Music]
[47:37] so we're looking for this morning is for
[47:40] him to lay his hand on us as he has so
[47:42] many times before and he's been so
[47:45] faithful to us in so many situations and
[47:47] we just come and depend on him again
[47:49] this morning greet you all in the name
[47:51] of the Lord Jesus and I was thinking
[47:53] this morning as I was getting ready for
[47:56] service that I'm really terrible at
[47:58] greetings and all of those things so you
[48:01] know where we had the last service and
[48:03] it occurs to me that I should greet you
[48:04] from the Saints at home and the ones
[48:06] that sit along there their greetings
[48:09] sirgreetings from brother Jerry Fury our
[48:10] pastor and from different ones that know
[48:13] you and met by the bomb sister Brenda
[48:15] especially have been a few times and for
[48:18] the lowland brother Jay and all the ones
[48:20] that know I said hi and passed along
[48:22] their greetings and and and all that so
[48:25] you've been greeted and I also see the
[48:28] same going back so for brother Gerald
[48:30] but Jerry else has had to greet you
[48:32] brother Gerald and I I think I did that
[48:34] but like I say I'm not very good at the
[48:36] greetings part of things so god bless
[48:39] you all anyway and it sure has been a a
[48:41] good time with you I always feel that
[48:43] it's just a real comfortable place to be
[48:45] in and just in fellowship and getting to
[48:48] know you and also you know to come in
[48:50] and step in the pulpit it it just feels
[48:52] very welcoming and I remember the first
[48:55] time I ever took a service somewhere
[48:56] else and I was literally shaking so hard
[48:58] and the brother had to give him give me
[49:00] a hug and reassure me before the service
[49:02] because I was I was just trembling at
[49:05] the at the pulpit but by God's grace
[49:08] we've got over some of those nerves a
[49:10] little bit over the years but I for the
[49:12] very first time I came here I just felt
[49:13] very comfortable so god bless you all
[49:15] for for being that kind of hospitable
[49:18] people and and we certainly appreciate
[49:20] that and you know time is short we come
[49:24] in and out pretty quick but Lord willing
[49:26] we have a chance to come in fellowship
[49:27] and and vacation here again we certainly
[49:29] enjoyed that in the past so and it's
[49:31] such good singing this morning and and
[49:34] playing and all of that and brother Paul
[49:37] was asking me how the music ministry has
[49:38] been and I I think it just really grown
[49:41] it's been you know awesome seeing the
[49:42] younger ones grow up and fill those
[49:44] roles and even in the sound booth there
[49:46] but the Danny coffees back there
[49:48] you know the young ones raisin up and
[49:50] fill in those positions that's it's a
[49:52] great thing and we always want to
[49:53] encourage that so praise the Lord and
[49:55] even the young brothers that stand in
[49:56] open the door I thought that's just the
[49:58] neatest thing that yeah brother Levi
[50:00] before the gayborhood just getting up
[50:01] there and and opening the doors and so
[50:03] this is awesome
[50:04] any more of that at home but yeah god
[50:08] bless you so you know this morning I was
[50:11] thinking it will actually win
[50:12] I'm brother Gerald had emailed me and
[50:15] asked me to come and and I'm not a by
[50:17] any means I special meetings types of a
[50:20] minister and and I've never taken a
[50:22] Sunday morning Easter message before but
[50:25] you know it's not a very conventional
[50:27] one this morning you know out about the
[50:29] rabbit and the eggs and everything like
[50:31] that you know they probably spoke about
[50:33] all over the place but but what what
[50:36] came on my heart actually was kind of a
[50:39] different different thought of
[50:41] dishonouring the resurrection yeah
[50:44] because a lot of people gather on Easter
[50:47] morning and it's the first time they've
[50:49] been in church since Christmas you know
[50:51] they you know we were driving here this
[50:53] morning and you know brother Adam you
[50:55] know big big crowds everywhere you know
[50:57] go by every Church and and the parking
[50:59] lots full and and you just think that oh
[51:01] wow you know all of these people have
[51:03] gotten you know up this morning special
[51:06] and they have got their suit on and they
[51:08] got maybe a new Easter dress for the
[51:10] little ones and the end you know the the
[51:12] ladies have all come up all nice and
[51:13] everything else and they think that
[51:14] God's going to be pleased by you know
[51:17] what they've brought to the table so to
[51:19] speak what they've done and I think oh
[51:21] man we're gonna come this morning we're
[51:22] gonna honor the resurrection but God's
[51:25] not honored by that God's not honored by
[51:28] a once-a-year type of commitment to to
[51:31] serving him he's not interested in twice
[51:33] a year when you you know come to
[51:35] Christmas morning kind of experience and
[51:37] so I started to think about this kind of
[51:39] experiences and how you know even in our
[51:41] own lives sometimes we get to a place
[51:43] where we're not really honoring God the
[51:45] way that we think that we we are and
[51:48] just kind of in that in that vein so you
[51:51] know there is there's some good news in
[51:53] there too because there certainly is a
[51:55] way that each and every day we can be
[51:57] honoring the resurrection but if we
[51:59] stand this morning we'll just turn to
[52:01] the scripture
[52:04] Isaiah chapter 29 another way the
[52:24] scripture tells us is that God's ways
[52:26] are not our ways and you know still most
[52:29] of the time when we think about God we
[52:30] think of them through our you know the
[52:32] way that we look at everything but you
[52:33] know God's got a different perspective
[52:34] on it all and what pleases God and what
[52:36] pleases us sometimes are very different
[52:38] things but Isaiah 29 here gives us a
[52:41] little bit of insight into this and it
[52:43] says verse 13 wherefore the Lord said
[52:47] for as much as this people draw near
[52:49] with their mouths and with their lips to
[52:52] honor me but have removed their heart
[52:55] far from me and their fear toward me is
[52:58] taught by the precept of men therefore
[53:00] behold I will proceed to do a marvellous
[53:02] work among this people even a marvelous
[53:05] work in a wonder for the wisdom of their
[53:08] wise men shall perish and the
[53:10] understanding of their prudent men shall
[53:13] be hid if you turn over to Deuteronomy
[53:15] chapter 6 as well just quickly and Moses
[53:20] says there - to the children of Israel
[53:22] he says hear o Israel the Lord our God
[53:25] is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord
[53:28] thy God with all thine heart and with
[53:30] all thy soul and with all thy might and
[53:34] these words which I command thee this
[53:37] day shall be in thine heart let's bow
[53:41] our heads Lord Jesus father we just come
[53:44] to you this morning we are so thankful
[53:45] for a resurrected life that's been given
[53:49] to us Lord Father if it was only your
[53:51] death on Calvary and there was no
[53:53] resurrection then Lord we could we could
[53:55] go into death ourselves feeling forgiven
[53:59] Lord and knowing that you atoned for us
[54:00] by Lord it was your resurrection that
[54:03] really paved the way for us Lord Jesus
[54:05] that not only could we be forgiven the
[54:08] but we could be like you we could have
[54:10] fellowship we could we get it conquer
[54:12] this world Lord and we can follow in the
[54:14] example that you left
[54:15] this morning Lord I trust that the word
[54:18] that spoken many of those things I hope
[54:20] are not a reflective of our lives Lord
[54:22] but in the in the things that we do see
[54:25] Lord if there's any areas where we've we
[54:27] become cold where we become formal Lord
[54:29] then we just asked that you drive those
[54:31] things far from us Lord and that that
[54:33] powerful life that power of your
[54:35] resurrection could shine forth each one
[54:38] of our lives we pray father we commit
[54:40] each one to you this morning and I ask
[54:41] that you just take me out of the way
[54:43] Lord take us all out of the way and may
[54:45] we just let your anointing flow in Jesus
[54:48] name we pray man you may be seated this
[54:51] morning so as we look into this start I
[54:55] I was thinking about why it is sometimes
[54:59] that we miss the God so much him and we
[55:02] miss him and I don't know maybe you
[55:03] don't feel that way maybe you feel like
[55:04] you're always walking in God's perfect
[55:06] well every moment of every day but you
[55:08] know I'm just gonna be honest with you
[55:09] that I there's many times when I know
[55:11] that I'm not walking exactly where God
[55:13] wants me to be but I don't even know
[55:14] where that is sometimes you know you
[55:16] know I should be doing right and I will
[55:18] you know get up and I will pray you know
[55:20] read my Bible and do all those things
[55:21] but as we start on another day you know
[55:23] there isn't a big flashing light I want
[55:25] to do this talk to this person say this
[55:27] you know and so many times we know that
[55:29] we just keep walking as much as we can
[55:31] and we look for the leadership of the
[55:33] Lord in many situations to say what
[55:35] should I do in this case what should I
[55:36] do in this case how should I handle this
[55:38] situation but you know we really we
[55:40] really come into it because we have a
[55:43] disability okay we have a disability
[55:45] what's this all about
[55:46] well we have a disability because we're
[55:49] trapped in these bodies you know no
[55:52] matter what genes of intelligence and
[55:54] talent lay within us no matter how great
[55:56] and capable our flesh will ever become
[55:58] we're all disabled because we all
[56:01] contact the world around us by five
[56:03] natural and five spiritual senses you
[56:06] know we don't have the same access that
[56:08] God has when he looks upon his earth he
[56:10] sees things quite differently than we do
[56:11] because he's going beyond those senses
[56:13] that we have he knows the end from the
[56:15] beginning he knows all things he you
[56:17] know before he created a single part of
[56:19] it all he knew exactly where you'd be
[56:20] this morning not just what building
[56:22] you'd be located in but what the
[56:24] condition of your heart is where your
[56:26] mind would be this morning what
[56:27] struggles you're going through what
[56:28] trials and difficulties you're
[56:29] experiencing but when we come we don't
[56:32] see any of that you know where we're
[56:34] left to contact the world by our site
[56:36] and our hearing smell taste and feel and
[56:39] buy our affection memory conscience
[56:41] reasoning and imagination and and you
[56:43] might think those are not disabilities
[56:44] those are abilities you know and they
[56:48] are if you take one of them away you'll
[56:49] see how much more disabled the body
[56:51] becomes but they're all that we have
[56:54] many times to make our way around we
[56:58] make our decisions based on the
[56:59] information that we take in and process
[57:01] from those senses but have you ever
[57:04] noticed that your senses get lied to all
[57:05] the time you know your senses get lied
[57:08] to all the time you might think oh you
[57:10] know you know I can see this with my
[57:12] eyes it must be good and then find out
[57:13] that it's not that good you know they
[57:15] give us a false witness many times and
[57:17] many times we can't form a true judgment
[57:19] beyond what our senses have declared to
[57:22] us you know a really good example of
[57:24] that in the Old Testament is is Isaac
[57:26] you know who brother Graham tells us
[57:27] with a prophet who you know in his
[57:29] eyesight had gone and he was coming to a
[57:31] place where he wanted to bless his his
[57:33] sons and give them their inheritance and
[57:35] their portion and and so we see that you
[57:37] know Isaac had still you know for good
[57:40] remaining census is you know his hearing
[57:42] was good and his his sense of taste and
[57:45] smell you know we're excellent feel was
[57:47] excellent you know but is his eyes at
[57:49] dimmed and so he sends out his son Esau
[57:52] who you know was the one that he was his
[57:53] firstborn and that he favored and he
[57:55] said go out and get me some venison and
[57:57] cook it up for me just the way that I
[57:59] like and so you know it looked like you
[58:01] know he would get the the birthright and
[58:03] he would get the the blessing of the
[58:05] firstborn and all of that but while he's
[58:07] gone his his wife her Isaac's wife
[58:11] Rebekah and and Jacob they conspired
[58:14] together and and they they fool
[58:17] Isaac census he's got perfectly good
[58:20] working census but they fool those
[58:23] census to get him to think that there's
[58:25] someone else that he's blessing they to
[58:28] get them to think that Jacob is actually
[58:30] Esau and so what they do is of course
[58:32] well well Esau is off hunting the
[58:34] venison you know Rebekah has prepared
[58:38] Esau his clothes for Jacob to put on
[58:42] so that he'll smell like like ISA and
[58:44] she's prepared you know some some hairs
[58:47] for him to you know wrap his his arms
[58:49] with so that you know that he'll feel
[58:51] more like Esau cuz he saw was the
[58:53] hairier of the two brothers you know and
[58:55] she prepares the food just right so that
[58:57] it will taste and appeal to his sense of
[59:00] taste just like you know he would for
[59:03] for the meat that Esau is gonna bring
[59:04] back and so you know he's going to smell
[59:06] like Esau he's going to feel like Esau
[59:08] and the meat is going to taste like the
[59:10] meat that Esau supposed to be bringing
[59:11] and so his senses are giving him a
[59:13] report that's good one of his senses is
[59:17] tingling if it doesn't sound like the
[59:19] voice of Esau sounds like the voice of
[59:21] Jacob but even in that time where he's
[59:23] getting mixed messages his senses are
[59:26] strongly they're telling him but but I
[59:28] smell him and I feel him and I and I
[59:30] taste this meat its everything's lining
[59:32] up it must be right and so he's so
[59:35] convinced that you know you think if he
[59:38] was a little more nervous about it he
[59:40] would have held back a little bit on the
[59:42] blessing but you know he just blesses
[59:43] and blesses and blesses and blesses
[59:45] Jacob in the place of ISA to the point
[59:48] that when Esau comes later and and finds
[59:50] out the treachery Isaac basically tells
[59:53] him I don't have any blessing left you
[59:54] know I already gave it all to Jacob I
[59:56] already you know I already poured it all
[59:58] out on him and so we find that deception
[1:00:02] of our senses is very easy to pull off
[1:00:05] you know in this world actually prides
[1:00:07] itself on illusions you know optical
[1:00:10] illusions and auditory illusions and all
[1:00:12] these things because you know we like to
[1:00:15] have our senses fooled sometimes but we
[1:00:18] also fool one another with those senses
[1:00:20] deception has been around since you know
[1:00:23] the Garden of Eden and when a servant
[1:00:25] serpent deceived even and worked on her
[1:00:27] conscience and her her memory her
[1:00:29] reasoning to convince her to step
[1:00:32] outside of the perfect will of God and
[1:00:33] and do things that were not right in and
[1:00:35] so often we are easily deceived just by
[1:00:38] those same things by our memory and our
[1:00:40] conscience and our imagination being
[1:00:42] influenced gets us on the wrong track
[1:00:45] you know because we depend on those
[1:00:48] senses we take things at face value we
[1:00:51] take things the way they appear to be
[1:00:53] you know and when we when we think that
[1:00:55] some
[1:00:55] a certain way then we say well that must
[1:00:57] be the way that it is you know and you
[1:00:59] might be thinking well we've been given
[1:01:00] another sense we've been given a faith a
[1:01:02] faith sense but they're gonna call the
[1:01:04] sixth sense faith and we believe that
[1:01:06] you know that's very true we've been
[1:01:07] given faith and brother Brown tells us
[1:01:09] that faith is what contacts God and
[1:01:11] faith is a revelation of the will of God
[1:01:13] so faith gives us understanding and it
[1:01:16] gives us discernment in many situations
[1:01:18] but it's not a perfect indicator in
[1:01:21] every part of our lives you know and I
[1:01:23] believe that the reason that's limited
[1:01:25] is because it comes through this fallen
[1:01:27] flesh still and through our human spirit
[1:01:28] sometimes and so you know it's not it's
[1:01:30] not like it was in Jesus where it was a
[1:01:32] perfect discernment that worked every
[1:01:34] time you know it's not like it it would
[1:01:36] be in God where he sees the the right
[1:01:37] way every time
[1:01:38] but in HUS in our in our human flesh in
[1:01:41] this fallen condition you know that's
[1:01:43] not going to be a redeemed till the body
[1:01:45] change you know we we don't have that
[1:01:46] perfect discernment in every situation
[1:01:49] you come to church and you and you see
[1:01:51] the brothers and sisters here and you
[1:01:53] know you don't have a perfect
[1:01:53] discernment of their situation you know
[1:01:56] everybody shakes hands say Oh God bless
[1:01:57] you and we just how are you doing today
[1:01:59] good
[1:01:59] you say oh good I'm good too and so
[1:02:02] everybody well we were all doing good
[1:02:03] today that's wonderful you know nobody
[1:02:05] has any needs and nobody has any
[1:02:06] problems we're just all serving the Lord
[1:02:07] we're all doing good and you know and
[1:02:10] that's
[1:02:10] we kind of deceive ourselves sometimes
[1:02:13] by those things but God doesn't see us
[1:02:17] that way this morning you know when what
[1:02:18] we can come in here we can say I'm doing
[1:02:20] good and we could sing and praise God
[1:02:21] and everything but he knows exactly what
[1:02:24] your condition is this morning he knows
[1:02:26] exactly how much faith you have he knows
[1:02:29] exactly how much revelation you have he
[1:02:31] knows exactly if there's a Holy Ghost
[1:02:33] working in your life he knows exactly
[1:02:35] how sincere you are this morning and
[1:02:38] he's not fooled you know and that's not
[1:02:40] to to make us all scared and say oh man
[1:02:42] maybe God sees me in a different way
[1:02:44] than I see myself but it's it's to help
[1:02:45] us realize that when we come to church
[1:02:47] and we all put on our nice clothes and
[1:02:49] and then smile and shake everybody's
[1:02:50] hand God knows that there still needs in
[1:02:53] our lives okay there's still a place
[1:02:55] that we need him we depending on him and
[1:02:58] you know as much as we we try to put on
[1:03:01] the air that we we're doing really well
[1:03:03] sometimes that doesn't tell the whole
[1:03:05] story you know some of the places that
[1:03:07] we are most deceived actually
[1:03:09] is in church you know amongst Christians
[1:03:12] you know you say well that sounds crazy
[1:03:14] you know if there's any place that you
[1:03:15] should be able to you know really feel
[1:03:18] comfortable and the moment occasion of
[1:03:20] yourself it should be in church because
[1:03:21] you know you're not under the pressure
[1:03:23] of the world and the strain of sin and
[1:03:25] all those things you should be able to
[1:03:26] come here and just be yourself but often
[1:03:30] with we're here and we're acting on our
[1:03:32] best behavior
[1:03:33] not our typical behavior and we're here
[1:03:35] we're here in like the you know the the
[1:03:37] absolute you know best that we can be
[1:03:40] for a short time you know we're not we
[1:03:42] don't yell at our kids at church as much
[1:03:44] as possible you know we everything's
[1:03:46] just nice and we try to do everything
[1:03:47] just right and you know everybody just
[1:03:49] smiles and you know all of those things
[1:03:50] and we save all of the other stuff from
[1:03:53] one on the trip back home which tell the
[1:03:55] kids how bad they were don't you ever do
[1:03:56] that again don't you ever I don't ever
[1:03:58] want to see that and anymore you know
[1:04:00] and you know we do all those things and
[1:04:01] that's where our complaints come out and
[1:04:03] that's where you know all of our
[1:04:04] problems come out and all those things
[1:04:06] is away from church in church we try to
[1:04:08] be brave and strong and and smile and
[1:04:11] all of those things and we fool each
[1:04:12] other
[1:04:13] I believe with that all the time you
[1:04:14] know we shake hands like I said ever how
[1:04:16] are you doing good you know I've I still
[1:04:18] have not yet ever had a time where I
[1:04:20] strict somebody's hand say how you're
[1:04:21] doing they go oh just terrible brother
[1:04:24] just just really really really bad today
[1:04:28] please pray for me I've still yet to
[1:04:31] have that happen and yet you know I've
[1:04:32] shaken brother's hands that like manna
[1:04:34] they're going through some things it's
[1:04:36] good to see that he's doing so well you
[1:04:38] know and and then you know that on you
[1:04:40] know it can't possibly be that good but
[1:04:42] yet that's our our brave face that we
[1:04:44] put forth in churches so you know
[1:04:47] sometimes we do a disservice that way in
[1:04:49] the sense that we don't let people in so
[1:04:51] that they could know hey they're
[1:04:53] struggling let me pray for them let me
[1:04:55] let me support them let me help them out
[1:04:57] they're really struggling you know
[1:04:58] sometimes it's good to say you know when
[1:05:00] somebody asks you how you do is like you
[1:05:01] know would you remember me in prayer or
[1:05:04] would you you know just just remember me
[1:05:06] brother a brother or sister you know I
[1:05:08] would appreciate that you know that's
[1:05:09] the kind of thing that lets people know
[1:05:11] that hey there's a there's a life that's
[1:05:13] behind that that's vulnerable it's a
[1:05:15] human being they're still struggles and
[1:05:17] difficulties and things that were going
[1:05:19] through so we want to be real when we
[1:05:21] come to the house of the Lord
[1:05:23] and not always just so good so happy so
[1:05:28] vibrant and everything's so wonderful
[1:05:30] but we want to be real and genuine and
[1:05:33] you know when I think about when I think
[1:05:36] about the examples of the Saints before
[1:05:39] us
[1:05:39] you know from Jesus himself to to Paul
[1:05:43] to brother Brown to on and on and on the
[1:05:45] scripture tells us their mistakes
[1:05:47] scripture tells us their problems it
[1:05:50] tells us their bad days you know it
[1:05:52] tells us their weaknesses it tells them
[1:05:54] you know Paul was the one that preached
[1:05:56] to no I would do this but you know I
[1:05:58] would want to do right but I fail and I
[1:06:00] do wrong you know I want to do good but
[1:06:02] every time I want to do good evil is
[1:06:04] present with me
[1:06:04] you know Paul didn't just stand up and
[1:06:06] say like I don't make any mistakes and I
[1:06:08] don't have a bad day and I'm always
[1:06:10] doing so good
[1:06:10] you know Paul takes the time to write
[1:06:12] about his weaknesses write about his
[1:06:14] problems write about you know those
[1:06:16] those infirmities and say you know what
[1:06:18] I'm really struggling with this
[1:06:19] sometimes you know this person wrote the
[1:06:21] letter for me and it wasn't just because
[1:06:22] I didn't have time it was cuz I have
[1:06:24] seven trouble seeing I was having
[1:06:25] trouble you know putting it down myself
[1:06:27] so you know I had this brother write the
[1:06:29] letter for me or you know different
[1:06:31] things like that they let us into their
[1:06:32] lives brother branham you know never
[1:06:34] made it sound like life was easy you
[1:06:37] never made it sound like he was just you
[1:06:39] know he had a much easier time than you
[1:06:40] but he shared with he shared with you
[1:06:42] shared with me his struggles because
[1:06:44] that shows us the reality of what it is
[1:06:47] to be a human being
[1:06:48] serving the Lord it's not always you
[1:06:50] know just so spiritual it's not always
[1:06:52] just so you know walking with the Angels
[1:06:55] and in fact most of the time it doesn't
[1:06:57] feel like you're walking with the Angels
[1:06:58] it doesn't feel like everything's super
[1:07:00] spiritual the Lord said unto Samuel you
[1:07:05] know one day Samuel was looking around
[1:07:08] god I told him to go choose one of
[1:07:10] Jesse's sons to be the king and you know
[1:07:13] he was looking like we would look he
[1:07:15] would he was looking on the outside
[1:07:16] appearance who would be the most kingly
[1:07:18] amongst these sons you know and yet he
[1:07:21] had picked out the oldest one who was
[1:07:22] strong and tall and all those things but
[1:07:24] the Lord gives him a little insight that
[1:07:26] that travels our trim translates well to
[1:07:29] the thought this morning and he said the
[1:07:30] Lord said unto Samuel look not on his
[1:07:33] countenance or on the height of his
[1:07:34] stature because I've riff
[1:07:36] used him for the Lord see if not as man
[1:07:39] see it for the man looketh on the
[1:07:41] outward appearance but the Lord looketh
[1:07:44] on the heart and that principle that the
[1:07:48] Lord doesn't look on the outward
[1:07:49] appearance he looks on the heart is is
[1:07:52] what really guides everything about the
[1:07:55] way God moves you know we may be many
[1:07:58] times would look at a certain person and
[1:07:59] say that person will make a great
[1:08:01] Christian that person you know you know
[1:08:04] it's just a real example to me that
[1:08:07] person some of that I put my confidence
[1:08:08] in but a lot of times we're putting our
[1:08:10] confidence in them because they look big
[1:08:12] and strong and tough or because they
[1:08:14] look sweet and mild and meek and we
[1:08:16] think you know that's the kind of person
[1:08:17] that I'm putting my confidence in and
[1:08:20] yet you'll time will come to pass that
[1:08:22] you know that person didn't make a very
[1:08:24] good Christian you know they they could
[1:08:25] never subject themselves maybe to the
[1:08:27] Word of God or you know they just
[1:08:28] couldn't persevere you know that sister
[1:08:31] that was so sweet and kind
[1:08:32] you know she ended up not being very
[1:08:34] sweet and kind when you know things got
[1:08:36] down to it or whatever kind of situation
[1:08:38] comes along or she couldn't endure and
[1:08:40] so God he's not looking at those things
[1:08:43] he's looking at the heart he's looking
[1:08:47] at the inside to see what's there and
[1:08:50] what will respond to his word and God
[1:08:53] sees us as I said as we actually are he
[1:08:55] sees if there's unconcerned unconfessed
[1:08:57] seeing in our lives he sees how much
[1:08:59] revelation we have he sees if we have
[1:09:01] the Holy Ghost and we can't really tell
[1:09:04] brother branham himself said you know
[1:09:06] even with the gift that he had he
[1:09:08] couldn't tell if you had the Holy Ghost
[1:09:09] or not and he couldn't tell if you were
[1:09:11] gonna make it or not if you were the
[1:09:12] bride or not you know he had to depend
[1:09:15] upon his senses as well you know he had
[1:09:17] to depend upon his being able to see the
[1:09:19] fruits of your life and maybe look at
[1:09:21] the pattern of your life and tell you
[1:09:22] that you're on the right path but you
[1:09:24] know unless God showed him he couldn't
[1:09:25] tell you that you know and so even in
[1:09:28] our even in our own life sometimes it's
[1:09:31] difficult to discern those things you
[1:09:33] know because if you're in a backslidden
[1:09:35] condition do you want to admit that
[1:09:36] you're in a backslidden condition not
[1:09:37] very often you want to justify your
[1:09:40] condition and say like oh I'm not really
[1:09:41] that bad it's just you know I just you
[1:09:44] know feeling this certain way or just
[1:09:45] going through a little time or whatever
[1:09:47] or this is okay it's not so bad other
[1:09:49] people are doing it whatever we do it's
[1:09:51] difficult to even detect in our own life
[1:09:53] sometimes it takes a real prayer and
[1:09:55] entering into the presence of God
[1:09:56] individually for God's Spirit to sweep
[1:09:58] over us and show us oh here's some sin
[1:10:01] that needs to be cleaned out here are
[1:10:03] some things we need to move out of our
[1:10:05] lives here's some things we need to
[1:10:06] separate from and to show us our true
[1:10:08] condition and to show us himself growing
[1:10:11] in our lives and as I mentioned before I
[1:10:13] think earlier one of those service my
[1:10:14] ultimate goal and every service is that
[1:10:16] we individually really reach the place
[1:10:18] where God's Word doesn't just touch our
[1:10:20] senses
[1:10:21] it doesn't just tickle our ears doesn't
[1:10:23] just make us interested but to the
[1:10:25] Spirit of God touches our spirit and
[1:10:26] soul and really just individually shows
[1:10:29] us where we at where are we at and where
[1:10:33] do we need to grow and where do we need
[1:10:35] to change and just examine ourselves
[1:10:37] that's really when it has power in our
[1:10:39] lives so saying all that kind of set the
[1:10:43] foundation this morning for this thought
[1:10:44] dishonouring the resurrection you know
[1:10:50] Isaiah said that the the people of
[1:10:52] Israel were drawing near to God with
[1:10:54] their mouths and their lips and their
[1:10:56] mind but their heart was far from him
[1:10:59] you know and we're used to the idea of
[1:11:02] honoring a dishonouring we we know when
[1:11:04] someone's saying something nice you know
[1:11:06] we know and you know some somebody's
[1:11:08] saying something insulting or
[1:11:10] dishonouring you know we know when
[1:11:12] someone's being polite or when you know
[1:11:13] and respectful we'd say okay you know
[1:11:15] they're they're approaching it the right
[1:11:16] way you know they're giving a Comey
[1:11:18] mister or sir or brother you know
[1:11:20] they're not just you know being mean
[1:11:22] that there's no slang or or nickname or
[1:11:25] anything involved they're being you know
[1:11:26] polite and respectful or we know when
[1:11:28] people are being rude and disrespectful
[1:11:30] to us and when we're being treated well
[1:11:33] we feel honored and when we're being
[1:11:34] treated poorly we feel dishonor but have
[1:11:38] you ever found that you can be deceived
[1:11:40] by that sometime someone will honor you
[1:11:43] they'll butter you up they'll flatter
[1:11:44] you because they're trying to manipulate
[1:11:46] you you know if you ever go to a place
[1:11:49] where there's a salesperson involved you
[1:11:51] know they're usually giving you
[1:11:52] compliments left right and center
[1:11:53] because they're trying to get from you
[1:11:55] to purchase their product they're trying
[1:11:57] to you know tell you about how you know
[1:11:59] how
[1:11:59] good you are huh what a great decision
[1:12:01] you know it you know when you go and you
[1:12:03] tell the the waiter what kind of meal
[1:12:04] you want he never says oh that's
[1:12:06] terrible why did you offer that myself
[1:12:07] excellent choice that was that was a
[1:12:09] wonderful choice that's my favorite meal
[1:12:12] you know you'll really enjoy it you know
[1:12:13] why because he's trying to tell you how
[1:12:15] good you are you're just making great
[1:12:16] decisions in everything else because
[1:12:18] they're trying to get a larger tip out
[1:12:19] of you you know or a real estate agent
[1:12:22] or a car salesman or whatever they're
[1:12:24] being so nice not just because they
[1:12:26] enjoy your company but because they have
[1:12:28] something to sell you and something to
[1:12:30] gain from you so what it usually comes
[1:12:33] down to when we think about this is is
[1:12:35] we question if somebody's being sincere
[1:12:37] and if we think they're being sincere
[1:12:40] then we say okay you know I can respond
[1:12:42] to that and I feel honored and I feel
[1:12:44] respected and all those things because
[1:12:46] they seem sincere but that sincerity is
[1:12:49] still a judgement that we're making on
[1:12:52] our five natural and spiritual senses
[1:12:54] and we still get fooled by that all the
[1:12:56] time but God isn't fooled by what we say
[1:13:00] or how we act God sees the conditions of
[1:13:03] our heart and God knows the thoughts
[1:13:05] that we think as well as what we say and
[1:13:07] do you know so many times the the reason
[1:13:10] that we don't really catch on to how
[1:13:11] someone feels about something so we
[1:13:13] don't know their thoughts we only know
[1:13:15] what they say and do and so as long as
[1:13:17] they say and do things that sound good
[1:13:19] to us we think it's all good but we
[1:13:21] don't know the thought behind that but
[1:13:23] brother Brown tells us that you know our
[1:13:25] thoughts speak louder in heaven than our
[1:13:27] actions do on earth and so you know it's
[1:13:29] not a mystery to God what we're thinking
[1:13:30] today you know and it's not a mystery to
[1:13:32] God that you know if we're really in
[1:13:34] tune with the moving of his spirit
[1:13:36] that's why I read the scripture in
[1:13:38] Deuteronomy 6 is that it's not one of
[1:13:41] the Ten Commandments you know love of
[1:13:42] the Lord with all your heart and soul
[1:13:45] and strength that's not one of the Ten
[1:13:47] Commandments and yet Jesus said it was
[1:13:49] the greatest commandment but it doesn't
[1:13:53] it doesn't have any do's and dont's in
[1:13:54] it it doesn't have any regulations in it
[1:13:56] it doesn't you know doesn't have any
[1:13:57] real doctrine or substance to it but
[1:13:59] it's really the meat and potatoes of the
[1:14:01] whole thing it's really the substance of
[1:14:03] a whole experience of a real Christian
[1:14:05] is love the Lord God with all your heart
[1:14:08] and soul and strength because that's the
[1:14:11] part you
[1:14:12] carefree you can't act it it has to be
[1:14:15] genuine you know in every one of the 10
[1:14:19] commandments or every one of the
[1:14:20] commandments or doctrines even that we
[1:14:22] would follow today can be lived without
[1:14:24] a nature change every one you know how
[1:14:28] do we know because the Ten Commandments
[1:14:31] were actually given to a people who
[1:14:32] never had a nature change you know they
[1:14:34] were given to people that you know had
[1:14:36] no access to the Holy Ghost the people
[1:14:38] that you know we're just stuck in their
[1:14:40] same human nature and they did pretty
[1:14:42] well with those Commandments
[1:14:43] you know they've governed pretty well
[1:14:45] following those Commandments and so we
[1:14:47] know that many people get very good
[1:14:49] living the law of the word many people
[1:14:53] get very good at understanding you know
[1:14:55] what the church standard is and what
[1:14:57] what the message standard is and what
[1:14:59] you know what the Bible teaches and they
[1:15:01] get really good at those things and yet
[1:15:04] they feel the greatest commandment
[1:15:06] loving the Lord God with all their heart
[1:15:08] and soul in mind you know and so that's
[1:15:10] what we find at the time when Jesus
[1:15:12] arrives on the scene in the scripture
[1:15:14] the churches of that day have become
[1:15:16] absolute experts in dishonouring God
[1:15:20] while honoring him you know dis honoring
[1:15:24] God while everything they did look like
[1:15:27] they were honoring God you know what
[1:15:30] what a strange thing they honored God
[1:15:32] and everything they said and did and yet
[1:15:34] dishonored him at the very same time she
[1:15:38] want to read you some of the
[1:15:39] interactions with Jesus and the
[1:15:40] Pharisees you know and we always think
[1:15:42] bad Pharisees bad you know these are
[1:15:45] horrible people you know what look at
[1:15:47] what they did they end up crucifying our
[1:15:49] Lord you know they're they end up
[1:15:50] influencing all these people but we
[1:15:52] forget that at that time they were the
[1:15:54] most holy people around if you wanted to
[1:15:56] look at somebody that was consecrated
[1:15:58] and somebody that you could look at and
[1:15:59] say that's a real servant of God that's
[1:16:01] who I want to pattern my life after
[1:16:03] that's how I want my kids to grow up to
[1:16:05] be like that it would be like those
[1:16:06] Pharisees because everything they did
[1:16:09] look so good and holy in and when and
[1:16:11] just right and if you ever wanted to
[1:16:13] know should I be doing this should I be
[1:16:15] doing that you'd ask the Pharisees
[1:16:16] because they were the example of the
[1:16:18] most religious people around the people
[1:16:21] that were the most right and so in
[1:16:23] Matthew chapter 15 say
[1:16:25] then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees
[1:16:27] which were of Jerusalem saying why did i
[1:16:29] decipher us the traditions of the elders
[1:16:32] for they wash not their hands when they
[1:16:35] eat bread this is the message elite you
[1:16:38] know the the people of that day coming
[1:16:40] to Jesus and you know they they had
[1:16:42] everything so down that nobody could
[1:16:45] point a finger at their lives such a
[1:16:47] good life to the point that they had a
[1:16:50] whole set of traditions they were even
[1:16:53] above the standard of the of the Word of
[1:16:55] God you know they were so righteous that
[1:16:57] they figured out you we don't even have
[1:16:59] enough rules you know most people are
[1:17:01] like there's too many rules but the
[1:17:02] Pharisees are like you know we we've got
[1:17:04] those rules down let's create a bunch
[1:17:06] more rules because you know we think
[1:17:08] that it should be even more holy and
[1:17:09] even and even you know more strict and
[1:17:12] so they had traditions that weren't even
[1:17:14] in the word traditions that were made up
[1:17:16] by people who like things are certain
[1:17:18] away and and could pressure others to
[1:17:20] live the same way as them and and so
[1:17:21] they you know they had a church standard
[1:17:23] that was even different from the
[1:17:25] standard of the word you know and what I
[1:17:26] like is that Jesus setting point fingers
[1:17:29] the same way that they pointed fingers
[1:17:31] at him you know he didn't just come up
[1:17:34] with some some rule to get back at them
[1:17:37] but he actually poked right through all
[1:17:39] of that and points right down to the
[1:17:42] heart you know so many times when it
[1:17:45] comes to you know word and doctrine and
[1:17:48] everything else people just rattle
[1:17:50] quotes back and forth you know and say
[1:17:52] oh you know well here's my quote well
[1:17:54] here's my quote whatever I'm said this
[1:17:55] year but this one said here and this one
[1:17:56] said here but Jesus pokes right through
[1:17:58] all of that to their heart and he points
[1:18:02] right to a point of Honor is the first
[1:18:04] thing that he looks at it and he brings
[1:18:06] it forth here in in verse three said but
[1:18:08] he answered and said to them why do you
[1:18:10] also transgress the commandment of God
[1:18:13] by your tradition for God commanded
[1:18:16] saying honour thy father and mother and
[1:18:19] he that curseth father or mother let him
[1:18:22] die the death but you say what whosoever
[1:18:25] shall say to his father or his mother it
[1:18:27] is a gift by which that might be
[1:18:29] prophetess by me and honor not yet not
[1:18:33] his father or a mother he shall be free
[1:18:36] thus you have you made the commandment
[1:18:38] of
[1:18:39] of none effect by your tradition you
[1:18:41] hypocrites well did Isaiah say of you
[1:18:44] saying the people draw nigh unto me with
[1:18:47] their mouth and honoureth me with their
[1:18:48] lips but their heart is far from me but
[1:18:52] in vain do they worship Me teaching for
[1:18:53] doctrines the commandments of men you
[1:18:55] know they probably felt pretty smug when
[1:18:57] they first approached Jesus you know
[1:18:59] something having something to correct
[1:19:01] him by you know some some place that
[1:19:03] they found where you know if you're the
[1:19:05] Messiah you should be living the whole
[1:19:06] word and Jesus turns it around and
[1:19:08] exposes their whole lives with this one
[1:19:12] scripture and he said their whole lives
[1:19:14] were built on outward honor and inward
[1:19:17] dishonor you know the example he uses of
[1:19:21] honor thy father and thy mother you know
[1:19:24] it's something that was a you know part
[1:19:25] of the Ten Commandments it was part of
[1:19:27] the you know very foundation of what
[1:19:29] Moses had given to the children of
[1:19:31] Israel but they had found a way to
[1:19:32] bypass it they had found a way to do it
[1:19:35] without love without respect without
[1:19:37] kindness because they said hey I got a
[1:19:40] great idea
[1:19:41] you know we don't really love our
[1:19:42] parents but let's have a Mother's Day
[1:19:45] and a Father's Day and let's give them
[1:19:46] gifts and then we can say that we we've
[1:19:48] honored them you know we we took a
[1:19:50] little time out we you know we spent a
[1:19:52] little bit of money on them and now we
[1:19:54] can say that we have honored them
[1:19:55] properly and yet throughout the year
[1:19:58] they could continue to disrespect their
[1:20:00] parents they could continue to not
[1:20:02] follow the leadership not take the
[1:20:03] advice not do any of those things but
[1:20:06] because they gave a gift because they
[1:20:07] gave a little token of affection that
[1:20:10] was good enough that's the way a lot of
[1:20:13] people approach God is that you know
[1:20:16] they don't really love God enough to
[1:20:18] take the word and live it out and do
[1:20:20] exactly what he said and and you'll
[1:20:22] follow the the gospel the way it was
[1:20:24] preached but they are they're good
[1:20:26] enough at giving gifts they're good
[1:20:28] enough at coming in and giving a little
[1:20:29] honor here and there so that it looks
[1:20:32] like they're being faithful to the Lord
[1:20:33] you know they're good enough to come in
[1:20:35] and and in worship a little bit the good
[1:20:37] enough to come in and and give a little
[1:20:39] bit of attention here and there but not
[1:20:42] able to really honor him every day honor
[1:20:46] him every day by by hearing his word by
[1:20:48] responding to his call
[1:20:52] they care too much about the outward you
[1:20:57] know if we look at even churches in the
[1:21:00] message we care so much about the
[1:21:02] outward that we missed the urgency of
[1:21:04] the condition of a soul you know we see
[1:21:07] someone new to church oh man I need to I
[1:21:09] see a nude sister in church today
[1:21:10] someone please get her a skirt you know
[1:21:13] wipe off her makeup you know can we sign
[1:21:16] her up for some hair extensions can we
[1:21:17] can we do something you know can we
[1:21:19] brush that outside make it a little bit
[1:21:21] you know a little longer you know what
[1:21:22] is that we have a we have a need in us
[1:21:24] to conform people on the outside to
[1:21:27] match the same thing that we are you
[1:21:29] know the same things that we want to be
[1:21:30] you know there's a new brother visiting
[1:21:32] church today does he have a copy of the
[1:21:33] church age book yeah
[1:21:34] has he learned to say the seventh angels
[1:21:36] Creed yet you know how does he have a
[1:21:37] Malik Malachi four memorized yet does he
[1:21:39] does he know revelations 10 yet does he
[1:21:41] know and we cram all these expectations
[1:21:43] on people because what we really want
[1:21:45] more than anything else is for the
[1:21:47] outside to match our outside you know
[1:21:52] when Jesus pointed that out to them it
[1:21:53] really rankled the Pharisees you know
[1:21:56] and am i wrinkle that's a little bit
[1:21:57] because I think in some in all of us
[1:21:59] there's probably a little bit of
[1:22:00] Pharisee you know we like people to look
[1:22:02] like we think they should look you know
[1:22:04] we like people that act like we think
[1:22:06] they should act and talk like we think
[1:22:07] they should talk you know in most of the
[1:22:09] time what we think they should do is a
[1:22:11] lot like us you know they should be more
[1:22:14] like us they should they should look and
[1:22:17] act and talk like we do then we know
[1:22:18] that they have it and then they can be
[1:22:21] just as hypocritical as we are sometimes
[1:22:23] you know because Jesus looked at them
[1:22:26] and he saw how polished they were you
[1:22:29] know and he didn't have any Pat's on the
[1:22:31] back for them you know and I'm sorry if
[1:22:33] it comes across hard this morning but
[1:22:37] but Jesus and and and all of God's
[1:22:40] ministers really they picked the hardest
[1:22:43] on the religious people on the people
[1:22:45] that already you know have a form of
[1:22:47] godliness because that's where the real
[1:22:49] problem is you know people would look at
[1:22:50] Jesus and say how come he has all this
[1:22:52] time for you know sinners a tax
[1:22:54] collectors and you know the woman at the
[1:22:56] well and everything else he didn't you
[1:22:57] know preach to her about her standard he
[1:22:59] didn't preach to them but he was for the
[1:23:01] ones that already had it all together
[1:23:02] that's the one who he was hardest are
[1:23:04] because
[1:23:06] there's so many so many tendencies in us
[1:23:08] to depend upon those things and then to
[1:23:10] use them as the justification why we're
[1:23:12] better than somebody else or you know or
[1:23:14] why we're really saved we're not saved
[1:23:16] because you know we live a cleaner life
[1:23:19] than somebody else we're not saved
[1:23:21] because you know we have a better
[1:23:23] doctrine than somebody else you know the
[1:23:25] difference between this church and the
[1:23:26] next Church down the street with the
[1:23:28] full parking lot this morning you know
[1:23:29] isn't because we have better doctrine
[1:23:32] it's because we are contacting the power
[1:23:35] of Almighty God in a way that they can't
[1:23:39] contact because they don't know where to
[1:23:41] look for him
[1:23:42] you know they've come to church looking
[1:23:43] for him this morning and there's no
[1:23:44] there's no God there for them because of
[1:23:47] the the false doctrine that they're
[1:23:48] under because of you know the the light
[1:23:50] that they're being shown is not a light
[1:23:52] it's a glare you know brother Brown when
[1:23:56] he talks about the Pharisees and
[1:23:58] hypocrites he would often get the the
[1:24:00] definition mixed up because you know you
[1:24:03] say the Pharisee means actor but
[1:24:04] Pharisee actually means separated you
[1:24:08] know they started out with with a desire
[1:24:10] to be separated to be a special holy
[1:24:13] consecrated people their lives
[1:24:16] consecrated to God that that they would
[1:24:17] be different they would be better than
[1:24:19] others but Jesus called them hypocrites
[1:24:21] and hypocrite means actor you know
[1:24:23] instead of becoming more holy they
[1:24:26] really became more skillful at acting
[1:24:28] holy you know and that's a case
[1:24:30] sometimes is that you know instead of
[1:24:32] becoming more close to God we come
[1:24:34] better at talking about being closer to
[1:24:37] God you know we get better at when we
[1:24:40] come to church you know say oh yeah it
[1:24:41] was just you know it just felt like the
[1:24:43] Lord really led me today and everything
[1:24:45] else and everything was going so good we
[1:24:47] just get better at acting out those
[1:24:49] things sometimes then we do had actually
[1:24:51] growing closer to the Lord Jesus has
[1:24:56] more to say to the Pharisees and he says
[1:24:58] woe unto you scribes and Pharisees for
[1:25:00] you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:25:02] against men for you neither go in
[1:25:04] yourselves
[1:25:05] neither suffer you them that are
[1:25:07] entering to go in woe unto you scribes
[1:25:10] and Pharisees hypocrites for you devour
[1:25:12] widows houses and for a pretence make
[1:25:15] long prayer therefore you shall receive
[1:25:18] the greater damnation
[1:25:19] one two you scribes and Pharisees
[1:25:21] hypocrites for you come pass sea and
[1:25:23] land to make one proselyte and when he
[1:25:26] has made you make him twofold more the
[1:25:28] child of Hell than yourselves Wow that
[1:25:32] that's an encouraging message brother
[1:25:33] Jesus the that you brought to the
[1:25:35] Pharisees there and and yet but nobody
[1:25:38] in that time nobody was going into the
[1:25:41] presence of God any more but everybody
[1:25:42] sure looked the part you know and see
[1:25:46] that you know in that time that the
[1:25:48] Pharisees they they would you know
[1:25:50] conduct themselves in such a holy way
[1:25:52] and when people would come and want to
[1:25:54] live that way they would give them a set
[1:25:56] of garments they would give them a code
[1:25:59] of conduct they would give them you know
[1:26:01] a standard and say this is what you need
[1:26:03] to do to enter in and that person who
[1:26:06] who used to have a fire and a desire to
[1:26:08] you know really get closer to God they
[1:26:11] adopt a new lifestyle instead and they
[1:26:14] never really get through to God people
[1:26:17] without the Holy Ghost convincing other
[1:26:18] people to live their dry dead religion
[1:26:22] holding back people who are on fire for
[1:26:24] God who don't see it like they do and
[1:26:26] conforming them instead to the standard
[1:26:29] you know we see that we see that in
[1:26:32] churches everywhere you know you know
[1:26:34] that the people come in they're excited
[1:26:36] they want to serve the Lord and then
[1:26:38] pretty much they're just a carbon copy
[1:26:39] of everybody else after a while you know
[1:26:41] they know what to say they know what to
[1:26:43] do they know how to fit in and yet that
[1:26:45] real passion and zeal that they had
[1:26:47] isn't there anymore jesus said you know
[1:26:49] they made them twofold more the child of
[1:26:52] Hell than they themselves were because
[1:26:54] they just can confirm them or converted
[1:26:57] them into their way of thinking you know
[1:27:00] of course we know that how that goes
[1:27:02] many times too in many churches pulling
[1:27:05] for money spiritualizing everything
[1:27:08] bringing damnation on themselves while
[1:27:10] they think they're doing God's work and
[1:27:12] you know really stood out to me this
[1:27:13] time reading through the scripture he
[1:27:15] says compassing land and sea you know
[1:27:18] what is that have that's a missions
[1:27:19] program compassing land and sea you know
[1:27:22] with with a message and you know so many
[1:27:24] times when Jesus said you know going to
[1:27:26] all the world and preach the gospel is
[1:27:28] what he said but so many times that
[1:27:30] mission program isn't about preaching
[1:27:32] the gospel it's about spreading the
[1:27:34] influence of a church or it's about you
[1:27:35] know getting more support in other
[1:27:37] places and you know some of that real
[1:27:39] purpose that we should be doing those
[1:27:41] things for us changed you know as
[1:27:44] churches have realized hey this is a
[1:27:45] great way to spread our name this is a
[1:27:47] great way to you know to have an
[1:27:50] influence this is a great way to you
[1:27:52] know control a program and we honor the
[1:27:57] work of man as much or more than the
[1:27:59] work of God sometimes and we measure our
[1:28:01] works in how many message books and and
[1:28:03] dollars were spent instead of how many
[1:28:05] souls were one for the kingdom how many
[1:28:08] people have been filled with the Holy
[1:28:09] Ghost why because it's a lot easier to
[1:28:12] measure those things it's a lot easier
[1:28:14] to you know to make the magazines and
[1:28:16] the printouts and the websites
[1:28:18] celebrating those things than it is to
[1:28:21] really put the time and effort and
[1:28:22] prayer and devotion to win souls to
[1:28:25] Christ Jesus goes on to say woe unto you
[1:28:31] you blind guides which say whosoever
[1:28:34] shall swear by the temple it is nothing
[1:28:35] but whosoever shall swear by the gold of
[1:28:38] the temple he is a debtor you fools and
[1:28:40] blind for whether is greater the gold of
[1:28:43] the or the temple the sanctified the
[1:28:45] gold and whosoever shall swear by the
[1:28:47] altar it is nothing but whosoever shall
[1:28:50] swear by the gift that is upon it he is
[1:28:52] guilty
[1:28:53] you fools and blind for whether is
[1:28:55] greater the gift or the altar that
[1:28:57] sanctified the gift whoso therefore
[1:29:00] shall swear by the altar sweareth by it
[1:29:02] and by all things there on who should
[1:29:04] I'll swear by the temple sweareth by it
[1:29:06] and by him that dwelleth therein and he
[1:29:09] that shall swear by heaven sweareth by
[1:29:11] the throne of God and by him that
[1:29:13] sitteth thereon they had gone to a
[1:29:15] hardened condition they were to gone to
[1:29:20] such a hardened condition it was such so
[1:29:22] full of carnality and blasphemy and
[1:29:24] everyone was so concerned about proper
[1:29:27] form instead of real worship and praise
[1:29:29] you know the Pharisees had distorted the
[1:29:32] value so much that they can only see the
[1:29:35] value of the gold they could only see
[1:29:37] the value of the gifts instead of the
[1:29:40] God that's right there
[1:29:42] the god that's right there that you know
[1:29:44] that it's present that's real that's
[1:29:45] powerful and everything else and they
[1:29:47] had to reduce the whole experience down
[1:29:49] to gifts and gold you know and and and
[1:29:53] condemning the people that were there to
[1:29:56] you know to receive from God condemning
[1:30:00] them putting them under bondage instead
[1:30:03] of pushing them towards Christ you know
[1:30:06] I've heard people so concerned about
[1:30:08] blaspheming God because they didn't do
[1:30:10] this or they didn't do that just right
[1:30:12] you know instead of instead of realizing
[1:30:15] that you know just press in just press
[1:30:18] in and find God you know it's so
[1:30:20] concerned because he didn't do this or
[1:30:22] just right or that just right or because
[1:30:23] they believe this way or believe that
[1:30:25] way but the greatest blasphemy to me is
[1:30:27] when your confession and your life don't
[1:30:30] match and that's the condition that all
[1:30:33] of these Pharisees were in is that their
[1:30:35] their confession of their righteousness
[1:30:37] and their actual life didn't match your
[1:30:40] first John chapter 2 verse 3 says and
[1:30:42] hereby we know we do know that we know
[1:30:45] him if we keep his Commandments he that
[1:30:49] say if I know him and keepeth not his
[1:30:51] Commandments is a liar and the truth is
[1:30:54] not in him but whoso keepeth his word in
[1:30:57] him verily is the love of God perfected
[1:31:00] hereby we know that we're in him so they
[1:31:04] would say we're keeping his Commandments
[1:31:05] but there's no love in them John goes on
[1:31:09] to say in chapter 4 verse 20 says if a
[1:31:11] man say I love God and hate if his
[1:31:14] brother he's a liar he's for he that
[1:31:19] loveth not his brother whom he has seen
[1:31:20] how can he love God whom he had not seen
[1:31:23] and this commandment have we from him
[1:31:25] that he who loveth God love his brother
[1:31:28] also what a thing you know a lot of
[1:31:32] people will fuss and fight over a
[1:31:35] doctrine fuss and fight to the point
[1:31:36] that they'll say well if you don't see
[1:31:38] that your serpent see if you don't see
[1:31:40] that you know we can't have any
[1:31:41] fellowship if you don't see that you
[1:31:43] know if you see this different than me
[1:31:44] you know we can never can ever be agreed
[1:31:46] on anything and they're just violating
[1:31:49] what the scripture just said because how
[1:31:51] can you how can you say you love God how
[1:31:54] can you keep his Commandments
[1:31:56] and you don't have any love for your
[1:31:57] brother you know that's one of the
[1:32:02] things that I've seen and as as I
[1:32:04] traveled a little bit is that the ones
[1:32:06] that have so much revelation often have
[1:32:08] the least amount of of grace towards one
[1:32:11] another you know because they're God's
[1:32:14] brought them to a point they know
[1:32:15] everything and you don't know everything
[1:32:17] so you know you better get in shape
[1:32:18] really quick instead of having a desire
[1:32:20] to restore that brother or help that
[1:32:22] brother in any of those things it's it
[1:32:24] always comes with a judgment or with in
[1:32:27] a kind of an exclusiveness we've got
[1:32:28] this until you get here you know there's
[1:32:31] no hope for you that's not really the
[1:32:32] way that Jesus preached it some of the
[1:32:37] Pharisees which were with him heard
[1:32:38] these words and said unto him are we
[1:32:40] blind also and jesus said unto them if
[1:32:44] you were blind he should have no sin but
[1:32:46] now you say we see therefore your sin
[1:32:49] remaineth God is always so merciful and
[1:32:54] kind and gentle and you know when I look
[1:32:57] at how he's treated me in my life he's
[1:33:00] just always had grace for me because
[1:33:02] I've certainly needed a lot of it you
[1:33:04] know there's many times that I thought
[1:33:06] oh man I'm on the right Road everything
[1:33:08] else strip and fall and you know all of
[1:33:10] those things and if it wasn't for God's
[1:33:12] grace to us where would any of us be you
[1:33:15] know if it's not cuz we got it the first
[1:33:16] time that you know we're here this
[1:33:18] morning it's not because we got it the
[1:33:20] second time
[1:33:20] but it's because after falling time and
[1:33:22] time again God still has grace for us
[1:33:25] you know and so the Pharisees asked
[1:33:27] Jesus like are you calling us blind then
[1:33:29] and Jesus said no you know if you were
[1:33:32] blind and if you would come needy and if
[1:33:34] you would come humbly there's a balm for
[1:33:36] those eyes you know just like the angel
[1:33:39] tells us you know in in our age late
[1:33:42] Asiya that there is a salve for our eyes
[1:33:45] you know that we can see that we can
[1:33:47] anoint our eyes with but if we come and
[1:33:49] we say we don't need it oh we're good we
[1:33:52] already see everything we already
[1:33:53] understand everything we already know
[1:33:55] everything and we don't put that 7
[1:33:57] that's where Jesus said there's sin
[1:33:59] remaineth there's sin remaineth because
[1:34:02] they could look right at it and not see
[1:34:04] what once you scribes and Pharisees
[1:34:09] EPIK Ritz for you pay tithes of mint and
[1:34:13] anise and cumin and have omitted the
[1:34:15] weightier matters of the law judgment
[1:34:17] mercy and faith these ought you to have
[1:34:22] done and not to leave the other undone
[1:34:24] you blind guides which strain at a gnat
[1:34:28] and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes
[1:34:31] and Pharisees hypocrites before you make
[1:34:35] clean the outside of the cup and of the
[1:34:37] platter but within there full of
[1:34:39] extortion and excess thou blind Pharisee
[1:34:42] cleanse first that which is within the
[1:34:44] cup and platter that the outside of them
[1:34:47] may be clean also Jesus gets to the root
[1:34:51] of the problem as only he can and and
[1:34:53] when we focus on the outside we aren't
[1:34:56] being effective we're missing the most
[1:34:57] important things righteous judgment
[1:35:00] mercy of faith the most outwardly
[1:35:05] orderly churches are usually the ones
[1:35:08] lacking the most power of God brother
[1:35:11] Brian talked about that he compared the
[1:35:13] Baptist to the Pentecostals and he said
[1:35:14] you know the one you know is all no
[1:35:17] starchy and everything's in order and
[1:35:19] everything's perfect but the Spirit of
[1:35:21] God can't work there you know and the
[1:35:23] other has got so much of the Spirit of
[1:35:24] God but there's no order to it you know
[1:35:26] there has to be the balance between the
[1:35:28] two because otherwise you know they get
[1:35:30] off one way or the other the more you
[1:35:33] clean up the church the more order you
[1:35:34] get the more everybody's just doing
[1:35:35] exactly what they're supposed to be
[1:35:37] doing the less room there is for the
[1:35:38] Spirit of God to change it the more we
[1:35:41] get into our time schedules and our
[1:35:43] routines and everything else the harder
[1:35:45] it is for God to move us out of the way
[1:35:47] so that someone can get what they needed
[1:35:49] this morning the very presence of God
[1:35:54] was in their midst
[1:35:56] and I and I think about this is the very
[1:35:58] first part of that that we read and they
[1:36:00] bothered to ask Jesus why the disciples
[1:36:03] weren't washing their hands you know the
[1:36:06] Messiah was right there in front of them
[1:36:09] and that was their biggest concern he
[1:36:13] made me think of all the things that you
[1:36:15] could have asked God Almighty and the
[1:36:19] one you chose to ask is why the
[1:36:21] disciples didn't wash their hands it's
[1:36:22] just
[1:36:23] like a bit of a lost opportunity if you
[1:36:25] ask me you know just it seems like they
[1:36:26] maybe could have asked something that
[1:36:28] there would have been a little more
[1:36:29] beneficial to them but they were so
[1:36:30] concerned with church order they were so
[1:36:34] concerned with everything being exactly
[1:36:36] that way that that was the biggest issue
[1:36:38] on their minds sometimes we think that
[1:36:42] God chose us because we're so special
[1:36:45] because we have so many good qualities
[1:36:48] and and everything else like I'm sure
[1:36:50] they felt that you know God God chose
[1:36:52] them and purposed them because they were
[1:36:54] so righteous and holy but why did God
[1:36:57] choose fishermen and tax collectors you
[1:36:59] know what why would those Jesus
[1:37:01] disciples you know did he just forget
[1:37:03] about the Pharisees or the Sadducees of
[1:37:05] the scribes no he went and purposely
[1:37:08] chose people that nobody would have any
[1:37:11] confidence in that you know that nobody
[1:37:13] would say we're spiritual that nobody
[1:37:14] would would say oh man these are the
[1:37:16] elite you ain't found people that would
[1:37:19] just listen and respond to his call he
[1:37:23] could have called the Pharisees for
[1:37:24] hours and they wouldn't have come but he
[1:37:26] called out to Peter and said come follow
[1:37:28] me and Peter left his nets and when
[1:37:30] followed him
[1:37:31] you know he called out to to Matthew the
[1:37:33] tax collector and he came and followed
[1:37:34] him and so you know he knew they were
[1:37:38] going to frustrate him all the time you
[1:37:40] know you read Jesus interaction with the
[1:37:42] disciples it wasn't always a you know an
[1:37:44] easy road it wasn't always like oh wow
[1:37:46] Peter that was the most insightful thing
[1:37:47] you could have said no there was some
[1:37:49] get behind me Satan there were some
[1:37:50] there was some you know harsh words
[1:37:53] there were some ye of little faith there
[1:37:55] was all of those kinds of things as well
[1:37:56] but what Jesus was looking at was not at
[1:37:59] what they could bring him but how they
[1:38:02] could respond to what he would give them
[1:38:06] they were going to make mistakes all the
[1:38:08] time and in fact they would try the
[1:38:10] limits of divine patience but they were
[1:38:13] humble enough to learn to listen and to
[1:38:16] obey and that's what made the difference
[1:38:18] you know the Pharisees had gotten to a
[1:38:21] place although they look like they were
[1:38:22] honoring God where they really wouldn't
[1:38:25] listen to anything they wouldn't listen
[1:38:27] to anything that didn't support exactly
[1:38:30] what they were already doing you know
[1:38:32] and even the disciples you see when they
[1:38:34] got a little success behind them
[1:38:36] you know men that knew that they had
[1:38:38] done nothing but you know get a little
[1:38:39] success behind them and they started to
[1:38:42] think they were something you know they
[1:38:43] started to argue who's going to be the
[1:38:45] greatest you know who's gonna have the
[1:38:46] most compelling ministry who's gonna
[1:38:48] cast out the most Devils who's going to
[1:38:49] do that to the point they even prevented
[1:38:51] that boy being healed from epilepsy
[1:38:53] because they were arguing and fussing
[1:38:55] who should be the greatest God chose us
[1:39:00] he chose you because you would respond
[1:39:02] to his word because you could hear his
[1:39:05] voice and accept it and the greatest way
[1:39:09] we can honor him is to keep responding
[1:39:12] to his word keep accepting it you know
[1:39:15] and Jesus actually thanked the father
[1:39:17] that he had hidden truth from the wise
[1:39:19] and prudent you know and giving it to
[1:39:21] babes such as would learn that's why God
[1:39:23] chose us God chose because I'm so smart
[1:39:25] I couldn't no God chose because you were
[1:39:27] a baby
[1:39:28] oh that that doesn't sound very
[1:39:30] encouraging no he it is encouraging
[1:39:33] because he saw that you could be taught
[1:39:36] and you would take his word and you
[1:39:37] would listen to it and you would respond
[1:39:39] to it and you would grow up to live it
[1:39:42] out that's why God chose us because we
[1:39:45] were babies not because we were scholars
[1:39:49] let's go a little further woe unto you
[1:39:54] scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you
[1:39:56] are like unto whited Sepulcher which
[1:39:59] indeed appear beautiful outward but with
[1:40:02] but are within full of dead men's bones
[1:40:04] and of all uncleanness even so ye also
[1:40:08] outwardly appear righteous unto men but
[1:40:10] within you are full of hypocrisy and
[1:40:12] iniquity woe unto you scribes and
[1:40:15] Pharisees hypocrites because you build
[1:40:17] the tombs of the prophets and garnish
[1:40:19] the simple curse of the righteous and
[1:40:21] say if we had been in the days of our
[1:40:23] fathers we would not have been partakers
[1:40:25] with them in the blood of the prophets
[1:40:27] wherefore ye be witnesses unto
[1:40:29] yourselves that you are the children of
[1:40:31] them which killed the prophets fill you
[1:40:34] up then the measure of your father's you
[1:40:36] serpents you generation of vipers how
[1:40:39] can you escape the damnation of hell you
[1:40:43] know he wasn't he wasn't making the
[1:40:45] speech to the politicians
[1:40:47] you know he wasn't making this speech to
[1:40:49] the the prisoners in the prison he was
[1:40:51] making it to the most religious people
[1:40:53] of the day the most holy people of the
[1:40:56] day you know what a thing you know
[1:40:59] brother Branham came and he wasn't he
[1:41:01] wasn't speaking to the prisoners or the
[1:41:03] politicians either he was speaking to
[1:41:07] the preachers when he said I indict this
[1:41:08] generation you know he wasn't talking
[1:41:11] about
[1:41:12] he wasn't even talking about the lady he
[1:41:13] was talking about the preachers who
[1:41:16] should have known better because they
[1:41:17] were studying the word and they could
[1:41:19] see what was true but because their
[1:41:21] denomination didn't allow the
[1:41:22] flexibility of of the truth they would
[1:41:26] turn away from the truth because their
[1:41:28] denomination didn't allow for the
[1:41:29] correct baptism they would turn away
[1:41:31] from it because you know their
[1:41:32] denomination didn't allow for you know
[1:41:34] holiness it wouldn't allow for
[1:41:37] deliverance it wouldn't allow for
[1:41:38] miracles they would turn away from me
[1:41:40] and push God right out of the way every
[1:41:45] single generation has an easier time
[1:41:48] with the historical gospel than the
[1:41:50] present one it's interesting that in
[1:41:53] Jesus time they quoted Moses to Jesus
[1:41:55] all the time they said well Moses said
[1:41:58] and Moses gave us this and Moses was the
[1:42:00] one and you know you know you need to be
[1:42:02] following Moses law and always quoting
[1:42:04] Moses to him but when Moses was around
[1:42:06] they were chafing at every word that he
[1:42:08] said you know they were rebelling
[1:42:10] against every word that Moses said and
[1:42:12] then as Moses dies and passes off the
[1:42:15] scene and the longer Moses has been gone
[1:42:17] all of a sudden Moses quotes are the
[1:42:19] ones that everybody's using and
[1:42:20] everybody's justifying themselves to the
[1:42:23] point that Jesus is standing there in
[1:42:24] the flesh and they're still using Moses
[1:42:27] quotes against him that seems so strange
[1:42:31] in Jesus time they're yelling crucified
[1:42:35] but for an and it Moses this time they
[1:42:38] were trying to stone him but within in
[1:42:42] historical context looking back a few
[1:42:44] hundred years later they could say oh
[1:42:45] we're gonna we're going to support those
[1:42:48] quotes bring out those quotes that we
[1:42:50] liked you know share those ones those
[1:42:52] are the ones that we really appreciate
[1:42:54] we can't handle this present word and
[1:42:56] flesh and look what happened to Jesus
[1:42:59] you know Jesus and his
[1:43:00] his words were enough to stir up a
[1:43:03] crucifixion but how many people quote
[1:43:06] Jesus words today with no problem at all
[1:43:09] you know people that quote Jesus words
[1:43:11] today the parts they like anyway you
[1:43:12] know you'll hear lots of Jesus words you
[1:43:15] know read in churches this morning
[1:43:17] you know I said oh well that's just
[1:43:18] wonderful st. John 3:16 it's just you
[1:43:21] know God so loved the world you know all
[1:43:23] these things if you love one another and
[1:43:25] and then they'll share all of these
[1:43:27] quotes of Jesus but they couldn't stand
[1:43:29] Jesus in the flesh they couldn't stand
[1:43:32] him you know they couldn't stand the
[1:43:34] present word but they can take the
[1:43:35] historical word because they can pick
[1:43:37] and choose the things that they want you
[1:43:40] know of course after after Jesus is gone
[1:43:42] they're history
[1:43:43] they've lost that in-your-face quality
[1:43:45] you know now you can pick and choose
[1:43:47] which verses you want to highlight pick
[1:43:50] and choose which verses are important to
[1:43:51] you instead of have to sit there and
[1:43:53] listen to them say them right to your
[1:43:55] own ears Paul's words were the same way
[1:43:59] you know Paul Paul's words are accepted
[1:44:02] now in churches most of them anyway
[1:44:04] you know they leave certain things out
[1:44:06] you know we'll leave out what he said
[1:44:08] about homosexuals cuz you know you know
[1:44:09] we don't quite believe that here or we
[1:44:11] know well we'll leave out what he said
[1:44:13] here about the women cuz we don't quite
[1:44:14] believe that here but he preached a lot
[1:44:16] of good things about predestination and
[1:44:18] he he preached a lot of good things
[1:44:19] about you know faith and all that so you
[1:44:21] know we we have no problem with Paul's
[1:44:23] words but in in the time that Paul's
[1:44:26] given he he's getting kicked out of
[1:44:27] every single church he goes to you know
[1:44:30] you he would go and share these words
[1:44:31] that we say are so wonderful now and
[1:44:34] they would kick him out of the church
[1:44:35] they would say we don't want you here
[1:44:36] don't ever come back you know help him
[1:44:39] out the door stone him on the way out
[1:44:40] whatever you know make life as difficult
[1:44:42] as possible follow him from city to city
[1:44:46] poisoning the people of those cities he
[1:44:48] hasn't even spoken in yet to tell them
[1:44:50] don't listen to this guy don't you know
[1:44:52] don't have anything to do with him he's
[1:44:54] you know he's spreading false gospel
[1:44:56] that's what was happening in Paul's time
[1:44:58] as the word came out of present tense
[1:45:01] ministry but now when was the last time
[1:45:05] you saw something that said that don't
[1:45:06] don't read the you know writings of Paul
[1:45:08] don't you know don't know listen to
[1:45:09] those a little poison your mind now
[1:45:11] nobody says that now because so much
[1:45:13] time is
[1:45:16] nobody's throwing Paul in prison anymore
[1:45:19] that time has passed we praise Him and
[1:45:22] we praise the work you did in
[1:45:24] establishing the New Testament churches
[1:45:25] and but every new church age messenger
[1:45:28] fought the same battles you know fought
[1:45:31] the same battles in their present time
[1:45:32] that you know every time they would come
[1:45:34] and God anointed them with His Holy
[1:45:36] Spirit to speak the word that was
[1:45:38] necessary for their age and it created
[1:45:40] the same kind of problems with the
[1:45:41] present tense and yet everybody had a
[1:45:44] easy time with the historical gospel
[1:45:47] when people quoted Moses to Jesus they
[1:45:50] thought they were honoring the Prophet
[1:45:52] but they were actually dishonouring the
[1:45:53] present God you know when people you
[1:45:56] know quote Paul today and reject truth
[1:45:59] today they're doing the same thing
[1:46:00] because you can't honor one and dishonor
[1:46:04] the other it's all God's Word it's all
[1:46:06] truth people are doing the same thing
[1:46:09] today in our age now people are
[1:46:11] comfortable quoting brother Branham and
[1:46:13] still chafing at the present challenge
[1:46:16] of the Living God in his ministry today
[1:46:19] you know as the further we get from 1965
[1:46:23] the easier it is to distance ourselves
[1:46:25] from the power of brother Rams ministry
[1:46:28] and take the quotes that we like you
[1:46:32] know in the wind the ways that we like
[1:46:33] things and the way the things that we
[1:46:35] agree with you know and the things that
[1:46:37] we have an easier time with and that's
[1:46:39] what we remember that's what we lift up
[1:46:42] that's a week's we rally around is those
[1:46:44] things that we agree with and the things
[1:46:46] that we support you know and all of
[1:46:48] those things and we grow more and more
[1:46:49] comfortable with brother Branham and we
[1:46:52] actually begin to dishonor God because
[1:46:54] we don't take the full things that he
[1:46:56] preached and live them we take the parts
[1:46:59] that we enjoy the most and we live them
[1:47:02] we get better at memorializing the
[1:47:04] highlights of his life teach the stories
[1:47:07] to our children point to what God is
[1:47:10] doing in our age by pointing back 50
[1:47:13] years you know there's still a lot of
[1:47:16] people who who they're first you know
[1:47:18] when someone asks them what they believe
[1:47:19] you know and this is fine I guess in a
[1:47:22] way but but if the first thing that you
[1:47:24] tell someone that you believe is that
[1:47:26] God sent somebody 50
[1:47:27] who passed away fifty years ago to lead
[1:47:31] a message then where's the present-day
[1:47:33] truth in your life you know where's
[1:47:36] Jesus Christ in that where is you know
[1:47:38] where is a living vibrant God today if
[1:47:41] everything that we're pointing to
[1:47:43] happened 50 years ago it's not any
[1:47:47] different than the way you know Jesus is
[1:47:49] being preached this morning as a man
[1:47:50] 2000 years ago instead of as a living
[1:47:53] God right now the more time that goes by
[1:48:00] the more focused we become on the past
[1:48:02] and the more that we're focused on the
[1:48:05] past the more that we miss what God is
[1:48:07] doing right now and what God has for us
[1:48:09] right now and what's still to be gained
[1:48:11] brother branham himself says in the
[1:48:14] message serves we would see Jesus he
[1:48:15] said and now if Hebrews 13:8 says that
[1:48:18] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:48:19] and forever and I'm sure they here Baton
[1:48:22] Rouge were just as hungry to see Jesus
[1:48:24] as they were to see him then every man
[1:48:26] that's in his right mind and hears about
[1:48:28] the Lord Jesus he longs to see him oh
[1:48:30] when I was when I first heard of him
[1:48:33] when I was a boy I just couldn't hardly
[1:48:36] stand it I thought if he's God he always
[1:48:38] was God he always will be God so trying
[1:48:41] to put it off in some great time in the
[1:48:44] past or some great time that's coming on
[1:48:47] that's just the nature of man man is
[1:48:50] always praising God for what he did
[1:48:52] looking forward for what he's going to
[1:48:54] do and ignoring what he's doing that's
[1:48:57] just the nature of man it's always been
[1:48:59] that way and it still remains that way
[1:49:01] today you know it it's the truth brother
[1:49:04] Branham in his time was saying that but
[1:49:07] now we've done the same thing for
[1:49:08] brother branham's ministry you know if
[1:49:12] somebody comes and asked you where is
[1:49:13] truth today and you point back to 1965
[1:49:18] you didn't answer their question their
[1:49:21] question is where is truth today
[1:49:23] you didn't ask where truth was 50 years
[1:49:26] ago you know you might as well you know
[1:49:27] open up the Bible and show him Paul's
[1:49:29] you know writings I say that's the truth
[1:49:31] it well but that was thousands of years
[1:49:32] ago that's right no where is truth today
[1:49:34] we ought to be able to point them right
[1:49:37] here right here let me show you where
[1:49:39] truth is right here it's right in my
[1:49:40] life if
[1:49:41] right in my home it's right in my church
[1:49:43] it's right it's right where I'm living
[1:49:45] it's in my prayers every day truth and
[1:49:48] life and power is right here today
[1:49:52] brother van was trying to show people a
[1:49:55] present God and now the message again
[1:49:56] has put God in the past and people are
[1:49:59] content to leave God there because it
[1:50:02] leaves them free to do whatever they
[1:50:03] want now the most uncomfortable God is a
[1:50:08] present God it's the most uncomfortable
[1:50:11] guy you know that's why it's really easy
[1:50:14] to have a God of stone or of wood or you
[1:50:16] know of your own making because it's a
[1:50:19] comfortable guy because he's never
[1:50:20] present with you you know you never have
[1:50:22] to worry that there's a real power that
[1:50:24] will make you uncomfortable a real power
[1:50:26] that will make you change because you
[1:50:28] know it's a comfortable God the most
[1:50:30] uncomfortable God is the real true
[1:50:32] Living God because he'll make you
[1:50:34] uncomfortable you go places where you
[1:50:37] shouldn't be you get uncomfortable you
[1:50:40] do things that you shouldn't do you get
[1:50:41] backslidden you get uncomfortable you
[1:50:43] you know you you know you're not where
[1:50:44] you should be you know that God's
[1:50:46] speaking to you it's a pretty
[1:50:47] uncomfortable place to be in you know
[1:50:49] you know that you've got to be praying
[1:50:51] you know you got to be reading then it's
[1:50:52] an uncomfortable thing because that
[1:50:54] God's trying to pull you and you're
[1:50:56] resisting there's a real tension there
[1:51:01] but a set of doctrines a code of conduct
[1:51:03] some good stories those are comfortable
[1:51:06] things things we can share with our
[1:51:09] families things that we can be settled
[1:51:11] in you know but take the words that that
[1:51:14] Jesus said and then the words that
[1:51:16] brother Brad said and the words that we
[1:51:18] these men have said and and live them
[1:51:21] out and they're just as powerful as they
[1:51:24] were in the day that they were spoken
[1:51:25] you know that's why we can sing that
[1:51:27] song you know ancient words because the
[1:51:29] words themselves are ancient but the God
[1:51:32] is still living present-tense God today
[1:51:34] you know they're they says that they're
[1:51:36] long preserved they're not preserved in
[1:51:38] a in a dusty falling apart sort of way
[1:51:40] they're preserved that when you read
[1:51:42] them and you absorb them they still have
[1:51:44] life and strength and power today and
[1:51:47] they can change your life today just
[1:51:50] like they could 2,000 years ago just
[1:51:53] like they could 50 years ago as long as
[1:51:55] we bring them into our life today and
[1:51:58] live them out Jesus gives this
[1:52:03] indication to us and it's not a happy
[1:52:06] one it says not everyone that saith unto
[1:52:08] me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:52:10] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[1:52:13] will of my father which is in heaven
[1:52:15] many will say to me in that day Lord
[1:52:18] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:52:20] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[1:52:23] in thy name done many wonderful works
[1:52:25] and then I will profess unto them I
[1:52:27] never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:52:30] work iniquity therefore whosoever
[1:52:33] heareth these sayings of mine is
[1:52:35] interesting he goes from there right
[1:52:37] into the parable of the man who built
[1:52:40] his house on a rock and the van to build
[1:52:42] the house on the sand he said whosoever
[1:52:44] heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
[1:52:46] them I will liken him unto a wise man
[1:52:48] which built his house upon a rock that's
[1:52:53] a very powerful thought that Jesus said
[1:52:56] someone could be so totally convinced
[1:52:58] that they had done a work for the Lord
[1:53:01] and yet he didn't even know that how
[1:53:06] strange would that be that that they had
[1:53:08] they were so completely convinced that
[1:53:10] they had done this that they could stand
[1:53:12] in the presence of Almighty God and and
[1:53:14] you know boldly proclaim we did this and
[1:53:18] we did this and we did this for you she
[1:53:20] said I don't I don't know I I'm
[1:53:23] searching the memory banks but I'm just
[1:53:24] not coming up with anything I know I
[1:53:25] don't even know you who are you where
[1:53:27] where are you coming from what you know
[1:53:28] did we have an experience do we have a
[1:53:30] relationship and it turns out they
[1:53:32] didn't you know that's that's such a
[1:53:35] strange thing you know but the band
[1:53:36] tells us the story of the man that that
[1:53:38] went into the presence of God and and
[1:53:40] you know he he was confronted did you
[1:53:43] ever tell a lie you know did you ever
[1:53:45] steal did you ever do wrong and in that
[1:53:47] holy presence all he could do was say
[1:53:49] yes Lord yes Lord yes thought I did do
[1:53:51] those things I I did make these mistakes
[1:53:53] I did sin and yet these people are so
[1:53:56] determined that they did such a great
[1:53:58] work for the Lord and the Lord doesn't
[1:54:01] even know who they are he never had a
[1:54:03] relationship with them
[1:54:05] he never filled them with his spirit
[1:54:07] you know and and I believe that we're
[1:54:10] starting to see more and more in the
[1:54:12] message as we get into the second third
[1:54:15] fourth generation of people raised in
[1:54:17] the message we're seeing more and more
[1:54:20] people that believe they have all of God
[1:54:22] because they've adopted the lifestyle
[1:54:24] the lifestyle of the message you know
[1:54:27] for the ones that have come from the
[1:54:29] world or have come from denominations to
[1:54:31] to find Christ they know the difference
[1:54:35] they know where they used to be and
[1:54:37] where they are now they know what it was
[1:54:39] like to you know to be in sin and to be
[1:54:42] separated from God and to feel that you
[1:54:44] know God was nowhere near you and then
[1:54:45] to come into a position where you feel
[1:54:48] God you know he's a present God and he
[1:54:50] answers your prayer and you can contact
[1:54:52] him and and you know he's revealed
[1:54:54] himself to you but for our children
[1:54:56] growing up they've always felt like
[1:55:00] they're close to God
[1:55:02] they've always they've grown up in the
[1:55:04] presence of God they've grown up coming
[1:55:06] to church they've grown up hearing about
[1:55:08] God all of the time they've adopted the
[1:55:11] lifestyle of the church and they don't
[1:55:13] know what it is to forsake all and come
[1:55:15] to Christ because they feel they've been
[1:55:18] right where he's at their whole lives
[1:55:19] you know my girls are going to be 15 and
[1:55:22] 13 in the next couple months and you
[1:55:24] know they look the part of the message
[1:55:27] just like they should you know they they
[1:55:29] look like they their lives are just as
[1:55:31] holy as anybody else's and they're their
[1:55:33] hair has never been cut they've never
[1:55:35] been in a pair of pants they you know
[1:55:36] they've never put on any makeup and
[1:55:38] compared to the kids at school they look
[1:55:40] holy compared to some of the kids at
[1:55:41] church they look holy but in the eyes of
[1:55:45] God all of us for not if they don't have
[1:55:50] a personal relationship
[1:55:54] you know a living walk with Christ and I
[1:55:58] believe it's a challenge for our young
[1:56:00] people growing up to look in the mirror
[1:56:02] and see no makeup you know see the long
[1:56:05] hair see everything else and still
[1:56:06] realize I'm a sinner that needs
[1:56:09] salvation because our whole lives were
[1:56:12] taught that by being Christians it means
[1:56:15] that we're dressing the right way and
[1:56:16] looking the right way and acting the
[1:56:19] right way and so they see themselves
[1:56:20] doing those things and they think they
[1:56:22] got it and they haven't really given
[1:56:24] their heart over to Christ you know I'm
[1:56:26] very thankful my kids have come to that
[1:56:28] point and they've been baptized and
[1:56:29] they've they've seen that need in
[1:56:31] themselves and I just keep encouraging
[1:56:33] them you know keep pressing for a Holy
[1:56:35] Ghost experience you know keep the more
[1:56:37] brother Bama tells us it's not a mystery
[1:56:39] it's not some big complicated thing the
[1:56:41] more room you make for God the more room
[1:56:43] he's got to fill you know the more space
[1:56:45] that you you make for him the more space
[1:56:47] he's gonna occupy and so you know I keep
[1:56:50] pressing them that way the same way I do
[1:56:51] in my own life looking for opportunities
[1:56:53] where God can work in a greater way and
[1:56:55] me but I see that as gonna be a
[1:56:57] challenge more and more for our young
[1:56:59] people growing up for you know to see
[1:57:01] that hey I've already been doing
[1:57:04] everything right I've already know what
[1:57:06] is it to live this message it's to go to
[1:57:08] church and knock the right way and dress
[1:57:10] the right way and say the right things
[1:57:12] it's so much more than that
[1:57:15] it's so much more than and I certainly
[1:57:17] don't believe that our children need to
[1:57:19] go out into the world to discovery but I
[1:57:22] do believe it's a challenge and we need
[1:57:24] to be we need to be upper of up front
[1:57:26] and honest with them and say there's
[1:57:28] much more to serving God than you know
[1:57:31] putting on a suit and tie hug on Sunday
[1:57:34] morning there's so much more to serving
[1:57:35] God than just going to him when we need
[1:57:37] him but there's a love that develops
[1:57:40] when we realize all that he's given us
[1:57:42] all these put into our hands all these
[1:57:44] entrusted us with there's a love and a
[1:57:46] relationship that needs to be formed
[1:57:48] there they need to be filled to
[1:57:53] overflowing with the Holy Spirit just
[1:57:54] like we do you know and so I would say
[1:57:57] how do we get them to the Holy Ghost how
[1:57:59] do we get ourselves into the presence of
[1:58:01] God sometimes and not just into the
[1:58:03] routine well we do it by breaking up the
[1:58:06] by breaking up the routine don't just do
[1:58:09] the same things that we always do you
[1:58:11] know don't just come to church at the
[1:58:12] same time every day sitting the same pew
[1:58:14] you know say the same thing sing the
[1:58:16] same songs you know worship the same way
[1:58:19] shake the same hands and everything else
[1:58:20] break it up God wants to show us our
[1:58:24] true condition God wants us to change
[1:58:26] our ways God wants us you know to come
[1:58:28] in and have the day be passionate and
[1:58:30] vibrant and all of those things you know
[1:58:32] and sometimes we we try to keep them so
[1:58:35] much the same and I try to wind up for
[1:58:37] time but you know I appreciated by fire
[1:58:41] and I was tempted to preach it here but
[1:58:43] you know really God wants to sometimes
[1:58:47] come in we're trying to build everything
[1:58:48] and preserve it and keep it just right
[1:58:50] and God wants to come in and just burn
[1:58:52] it to the ground and that might sound
[1:58:55] crazy but but he does because he doesn't
[1:58:58] like it when we've got it all figured
[1:59:00] out he doesn't like it you know when we
[1:59:01] get formal and cold and we build our
[1:59:04] little space for ourselves this person
[1:59:06] doing six inches closer to me in church
[1:59:08] and you know that was my parking spot in
[1:59:10] them in the you know and and how am I
[1:59:11] gonna worship God in these conditions
[1:59:13] you know you wait where you know your
[1:59:15] brothers and sisters who who carry this
[1:59:17] message to get it here we're worshipping
[1:59:19] in caves and everything else and you're
[1:59:21] worried about the air conditioner about
[1:59:22] the fan or about his to otter is too
[1:59:24] cold or you know it's going too long or
[1:59:26] a man I wish you would hurry up all of
[1:59:28] those things and yet God's trying to
[1:59:31] burn those things out of us if you here
[1:59:35] this morning and you needed to to get
[1:59:37] through to God but we have built such a
[1:59:40] form around church and how it works that
[1:59:43] you don't feel like you could come and
[1:59:44] approach the altar and get prayed for
[1:59:46] you don't feel like you could come and
[1:59:48] just pour your heart out to God because
[1:59:50] what would people think of you and and
[1:59:52] you know everybody would want to go home
[1:59:53] and everybody you know if you have that
[1:59:56] kind of feeling then we've got to change
[1:59:57] something it shouldn't be that kind of
[2:00:00] place brother Brahim said a church as a
[2:00:02] hospital and if we need to come to the
[2:00:04] hospital you know what a horrible thing
[2:00:05] you'd walk into a hospital they go I
[2:00:07] don't think I could see the doctor in
[2:00:09] this situation you know he's it's not
[2:00:10] available you know it's just it's just
[2:00:12] too hard to get to the doctor what would
[2:00:13] be the point of the hospital but
[2:00:15] churches like that sometimes it's so
[2:00:17] hard to get through to the great
[2:00:18] physician
[2:00:19] because we've got such a structure that
[2:00:21] we work with all this is Wednesday night
[2:00:23] no we can't do prayer question you know
[2:00:24] we can't we can't get prayed for on
[2:00:26] Wednesday it's supposed to be a short
[2:00:27] service or you know we can't do this on
[2:00:29] this day we can't do this why what are
[2:00:32] we really here for Paul writes this out
[2:00:35] here in first Corinthians 3 says
[2:00:36] according to the grace of God which is
[2:00:38] given unto me as a wise masterbuilder I
[2:00:40] have laid the foundation and another
[2:00:42] buildeth thereon but it let every man
[2:00:44] take heed how he buildeth thereupon for
[2:00:46] other foundation can no man lay than
[2:00:48] this laid which is Jesus Christ now if
[2:00:52] any man build upon this foundation gold
[2:00:54] silver precious stones wood hay or
[2:00:57] stubble every man's work shall be made
[2:00:59] manifest for the day shall declare it
[2:01:01] because it shall be revealed thank you
[2:01:03] brother by fire and the fire shall try
[2:01:05] every man's work what sort it is if any
[2:01:09] man's work abide which he has built
[2:01:10] thereupon he shall receive a reward if
[2:01:13] any man's work shall be burned he shall
[2:01:15] suffer loss but he himself shall be
[2:01:18] saved yes so as by fire and then he says
[2:01:22] know ye not that ye are the temple of
[2:01:24] God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth
[2:01:27] in you If any man defile the temple of
[2:01:30] God him shall God destroy for the temple
[2:01:33] of God is holy which temple you are Paul
[2:01:37] tells us that he laid the foundation of
[2:01:39] the word but we have built upon it and
[2:01:42] God's gonna try it by fire you know if
[2:01:46] it was built with good materials if it
[2:01:48] was built with things that will endure
[2:01:50] the fire like gold and silver and
[2:01:52] precious stones then you're gonna have
[2:01:54] something of value there when that fire
[2:01:55] sweeps through and if you've built with
[2:01:58] wood hay and stubble things that are
[2:02:00] temporary and perish in the fire then
[2:02:02] you're gonna suffer loss you know and he
[2:02:05] doesn't make this a point of salvation
[2:02:06] he said yet he himself shall be saved
[2:02:08] but but he says if you want the measure
[2:02:10] of your life take heed what you're
[2:02:14] building take heed while you're building
[2:02:18] and like I said we try so hard to
[2:02:20] preserve what we've built because we
[2:02:22] don't we don't want to lose what we
[2:02:23] built we spent time and energy and
[2:02:26] things building our lives and
[2:02:27] constructing them a certain way you know
[2:02:29] and if we think about the fire coming
[2:02:31] through you know we don't want to be
[2:02:32] left with
[2:02:33] anything you know you've probably seen
[2:02:35] the wreckage of fire before and you know
[2:02:38] sweep through a neighborhood or sweep
[2:02:39] through a house and and there's just
[2:02:40] nothing left but ashes who wants to go
[2:02:43] through a - type experience no we don't
[2:02:46] but wouldn't it be better to go through
[2:02:48] it now you know I don't know if you guys
[2:02:52] are singing the song here we're saying
[2:02:54] oh I know the time is near when
[2:02:55] everything that I hold dear will lay
[2:02:56] before the holy consuming fire all my
[2:03:00] works and all my deeds and every press
[2:03:02] that all my knees will lay before the
[2:03:04] holy consuming fire the Holy Ghost is a
[2:03:08] consuming fire and our heart's desire
[2:03:11] should be to let that fire burn through
[2:03:14] our lives and see what's left on the
[2:03:16] foundation it would be terrible to spend
[2:03:20] your entire life building on this
[2:03:22] foundation and one day when judgment
[2:03:25] fire goes through realize man there's
[2:03:27] nothing left there's nothing left here I
[2:03:29] thought it was all you know good and I
[2:03:31] had done such a great job constructing
[2:03:33] it all and the fire went through and I
[2:03:35] don't have the joy that I thought I had
[2:03:36] I don't have the peace that I thought I
[2:03:38] have I didn't have the Holy Ghost like I
[2:03:39] thought I did or we could say Alaura
[2:03:44] burn burn holy spirit burn in me set my
[2:03:49] soul on fire you know I I might not look
[2:03:52] like the most spiritual person at the
[2:03:53] end of it I might not look like I got it
[2:03:55] all together at the end of it but I'll
[2:03:57] know where I stand before Almighty God
[2:03:59] I'll know what's left on this foundation
[2:04:01] and I won't have to wait until rapture
[2:04:03] morning to see if what I built was good
[2:04:05] enough I'll know now that it's good
[2:04:07] enough or I'll know now that it's
[2:04:09] lacking and I'll know what it takes to
[2:04:12] get there and I want to know more than
[2:04:14] anything else that the materials that I
[2:04:16] built with are the same materials that
[2:04:17] God's building with you go and look at
[2:04:20] what he's building that new city out of
[2:04:21] its out of gold silver and precious
[2:04:23] stones there's no description there of
[2:04:26] any gates of hey you know or any you
[2:04:29] know pillars of stubble you know or any
[2:04:32] wood in this or wouldn't that it's all
[2:04:34] gold silver and precious stones so if
[2:04:36] that's what he's building with say god
[2:04:39] that's what I want to be building with I
[2:04:40] want to be building with that I want to
[2:04:42] know that what I'm putting it down is
[2:04:44] just as eternal as what God's putting
[2:04:46] down
[2:04:46] and so I'd say to you don't resist the
[2:04:49] fire proving our life don't say why me
[2:04:52] God why am I going through this guy say
[2:04:54] thank you Lord for putting me through
[2:04:56] this and may I may I get some
[2:04:58] understanding through it all may there
[2:05:00] be a purpose revealed in my life you
[2:05:02] know may I may I be lifted to a higher
[2:05:04] condition by this because he wants us to
[2:05:07] know him by his Holy Ghost and power not
[2:05:10] just by the knowledge of his word Paul
[2:05:13] says that he says and be found in him
[2:05:15] not having my own righteousness which is
[2:05:17] of the law but that which is through the
[2:05:19] faith of Christ the righteousness which
[2:05:21] is of God by faith that I may know him
[2:05:25] and the power of his resurrection not
[2:05:28] honoring his resurrection but by the
[2:05:30] power of his resurrection and the
[2:05:32] Fellowship of his sufferings Auto like
[2:05:35] that part know the Fellowship of his
[2:05:37] sufferings being made conformable unto
[2:05:39] his death if by any means I might attain
[2:05:42] the resurrection of the Dead we really
[2:05:45] need to come to that place where said
[2:05:46] God whatever it takes whatever it takes
[2:05:50] it doesn't it doesn't take me just come
[2:05:52] in and doing the same thing what does it
[2:05:54] take Lord that's what I want to have
[2:05:55] brother BAM talks about this message is
[2:05:58] a few quotes as a wrap-up he said I
[2:06:00] believe Paul said to know Christ is life
[2:06:02] and he knew him in the power of his
[2:06:05] resurrection not to know him by his word
[2:06:09] Wow he says to know him by word that's
[2:06:12] all right but that's a long ways from
[2:06:14] being sufficient to know him by word we
[2:06:18] got to know him by person of his
[2:06:21] resurrection you know the Word of God is
[2:06:25] quick and powerful it says the word you
[2:06:26] know if you were to take all of the
[2:06:28] scriptures about the Word of God the
[2:06:29] Word of God in the beginning was the
[2:06:31] word and the Word was with God and the
[2:06:32] Word was God but we need to know him
[2:06:34] personally in the power of his
[2:06:37] resurrection we know an awful lot about
[2:06:39] him but we need to know him in the power
[2:06:43] of his resurrection and we don't do that
[2:06:46] on Easter morning we do that every
[2:06:48] morning we don't do that you know on
[2:06:50] special occasions we do it every
[2:06:53] not occasionally at all but frequently
[2:06:56] but the map says how in the in the
[2:06:59] Testament the Old Testament what a
[2:07:00] beautiful picture was given of his death
[2:07:02] burial and resurrection when a man had
[2:07:04] leprosy a type of sin when he was healed
[2:07:06] by God he offered two turtledoves they
[2:07:09] brought the doves or the pigeons out
[2:07:11] they pulled the head off one turned him
[2:07:12] over like this and bled the blood all
[2:07:14] over the living mate and they took the
[2:07:15] living mate to the window and turned him
[2:07:18] loose and as the living mate went flying
[2:07:20] his little wings he bathed the earth
[2:07:24] I lost my place bathed the earth with
[2:07:30] the blood of the dead mate crying holy
[2:07:32] holy holy unto the Lord the living mate
[2:07:35] the husband of the Church of God is
[2:07:36] Jesus Christ he says the living man is
[2:07:39] the dead mate who was killed on Calvary
[2:07:41] for a sacrifice for leprosy cleansing of
[2:07:43] sin and sickness and his life and the
[2:07:47] blood was poured out upon the church and
[2:07:49] she's a crossing the world today
[2:07:52] preaching the old time gospel holiness
[2:07:55] the power of his resurrection of the
[2:07:57] Spirit of Jesus Christ crying holy holy
[2:08:00] holy unto the Lord he is the virgin born
[2:08:04] no sex connected with it at all he is
[2:08:06] the son of the Living God
[2:08:07] there is my hopes there is my strength
[2:08:10] there is my faith built on that right
[2:08:13] there what are we doing we're flying
[2:08:15] we're saying holy holy holy our lives
[2:08:17] are testifying that that death and
[2:08:20] resurrection that was provided for us
[2:08:22] not of my righteousness Oh looking look
[2:08:25] how good I'm flying over here no but
[2:08:27] every wingbeat testifies that there was
[2:08:30] someone whose life is it took the place
[2:08:32] of mine whose life was given for me you
[2:08:35] know that my strength and my power and
[2:08:38] my my zeal and amaya conquering all
[2:08:40] comes from him Butler Branham says as we
[2:08:44] wrap up remember brother the deeper you
[2:08:46] dig the more water you're going to get
[2:08:49] that's right we don't want nothing
[2:08:52] shallow we want all God's got for us
[2:08:55] everything power of his resurrection yes
[2:08:58] sir we'll just keep digging oh my you
[2:09:03] know I trust that we're not honoring the
[2:09:05] erection just by coming to church this
[2:09:07] morning you know you've all been
[2:09:08] faithful and most of you been here every
[2:09:10] service and so god bless you for that
[2:09:12] but you know we're not honoring the
[2:09:15] resurrection by the clothes we wear or
[2:09:17] the doctrines we believe you know we're
[2:09:19] not honoring God just because we believe
[2:09:22] a message we're not honoring God because
[2:09:24] we believe he sent a prophet we're not
[2:09:25] honoring God in any of those things
[2:09:27] we're honoring God when our whole lives
[2:09:29] are consumed with him we're honoring him
[2:09:33] when our own lives are resurrected when
[2:09:35] the life that we live is a Holy Ghost
[2:09:37] life you know when we can never again be
[2:09:39] the people that we were you know we
[2:09:41] never again could go back to that some
[2:09:44] people live in this in this condition a
[2:09:45] long time and then they can somehow go
[2:09:47] right back into the world and fit in
[2:09:49] they could go join a denominational
[2:09:51] Church and fit in I can tell you I can
[2:09:52] never do that I can never do it and it's
[2:09:54] not because I'm strong it's because I'm
[2:09:56] not the same person I'm not the same
[2:09:58] person that I was you know we can never
[2:10:00] again be the people we were but our
[2:10:02] heart has been changed our spirit has
[2:10:04] been changed we have his spirit pushing
[2:10:06] ahead you know pushing us pushing us
[2:10:08] pushing us I don't know about you
[2:10:10] sometimes when I go through a low time
[2:10:12] and and I think I don't know how I can
[2:10:14] do this
[2:10:15] there's just something inside that just
[2:10:16] keeps pushing it's just something inside
[2:10:18] this just keeps leading you there and
[2:10:20] you can't give up if you tried because
[2:10:22] there's a different life inside of here
[2:10:24] that's the power of his resurrection I
[2:10:27] know there's lots of quotes I could have
[2:10:29] read this morning but the bad talks
[2:10:30] about you know when he comes to that
[2:10:31] place when that curtain of death is
[2:10:33] hanging over he wants to know that he's
[2:10:35] met God in the power of his resurrection
[2:10:37] and I believe that without a doubt we
[2:10:40] can have that place now we're not
[2:10:42] wondering what death holds for us one
[2:10:44] day
[2:10:44] we're not wondering what sickness holds
[2:10:46] for us and you know what happens if this
[2:10:48] doesn't go this way or what happens if I
[2:10:50] don't make it home this afternoon you
[2:10:51] know because I get killed in an accident
[2:10:53] or what happens and this kind of thing
[2:10:54] it should all be settled if we've come
[2:10:57] into the power of his resurrection if
[2:10:59] we're truly honoring his resurrection in
[2:11:01] our lives it's all settled his spirit is
[2:11:06] pushing us ahead to the only destination
[2:11:08] we can ever be satisfied with which is
[2:11:11] our eternal place at his side you know
[2:11:14] as I as I wrap up as the musicians come
[2:11:17] I would say that
[2:11:19] I've heard many times over the years
[2:11:21] people would say oh I just want to make
[2:11:24] it there you know if I could just make
[2:11:26] it to heaven I'll be happy but you know
[2:11:29] what you shouldn't be because that's not
[2:11:33] the place that God has for his bride God
[2:11:36] didn't set aside a place for his bride
[2:11:38] where he said if you would just make it
[2:11:40] here I'd be happy with you he said I
[2:11:42] haven't got a place for you in my throne
[2:11:45] and when you overcome there's a place
[2:11:47] for you right and by my side right as
[2:11:50] part of me and so God is not going to be
[2:11:52] happy with you if you just make it God
[2:11:55] is not gonna be happy with you if you
[2:11:56] just make it in by the skin of your
[2:11:58] teeth so to speak er you know you just
[2:12:00] happened to live outside the city
[2:12:01] somewhere you know he's got a special
[2:12:03] place for you and that's where he wants
[2:12:05] you to be and until you reach that place
[2:12:07] he's not satisfied so if he's not
[2:12:09] satisfied lets us not be satisfied let's
[2:12:12] let's make the most of everything that
[2:12:14] we can and I really believe that that's
[2:12:16] the biggest challenge for the Bride of
[2:12:18] Christ in this age is the world makes it
[2:12:21] very easy for us to slack off and to
[2:12:24] relax and to you know stop pressing
[2:12:26] because you know everything just calms
[2:12:28] and soothes us down but it's a challenge
[2:12:31] to keep fighting every day and say I'm
[2:12:34] not there yet I'm not there yet so I
[2:12:36] want to keep pressing in let's bow our
[2:12:38] heads Lord Jesus father I thank you so

[2:18:24] it was the Holy Ghost a man and he
[2:18:28] prayed regarding getting himself out of
[2:18:30] the way the powder got it to get himself
[2:18:32] out of the way to minister the word and
[2:18:34] he had to get himself more out of the
[2:18:37] way for the for the Lord to come in and
[2:18:40] to end a manifest at Omega ministry a
[2:18:43] man of Christ is earning the thoughts
[2:18:46] and intents of the heart
[2:18:47] God going back to the past the present
[2:18:50] the future God healing the sick and
[2:18:52] raising the dead he men get himself out
[2:18:55] of the way and now it's Christ in the
[2:18:58] bride to get to get us out of the way a
[2:19:01] man to get our flesh out of the way
[2:19:04] because that's the endurance between us
[2:19:06] and eternity is the flesh worryin amen
[2:19:10] because we can't take this we're into
[2:19:12] that in the glory with with him no no
[2:19:15] it's got to be a new body a man that's
[2:19:18] why that we are believing that the dead
[2:19:20] in Christ shall rise first and we which
[2:19:22] are alive and remain shall be changed
[2:19:25] reign we're gonna be caught up with them
[2:19:28] to meet the Lord in the air and so shall
[2:19:30] we ever be with the Lord but we're going
[2:19:33] to receive again as the scripture says
[2:19:36] it says as if this time when I could be
[2:19:38] dissolved we've got one already waiting
[2:19:41] eternal in the heavens
[2:19:43] amen swingley in the change and the
[2:19:46] power of God said the dead in Christ are
[2:19:48] waiting on us and he said God is waiting
[2:19:51] on us what for to come to that perfect
[2:19:54] rapturing faith amen
[2:19:57] we come to that faith the daddy Christ's
[2:19:59] are going to come to us
[2:20:00] amen they're gonna be at the problem of
[2:20:02] guys that are going to be changed in the
[2:20:04] glorified bodies and appearing to us
[2:20:06] we're going to be instantly go to
[2:20:08] theophany and in
[2:20:09] into a glorified body and he said and
[2:20:12] there is I said let's find that quote
[2:20:15] where he said we were going to
[2:20:16] fellowship with each other and he
[2:20:18] supports a minute for a certain period
[2:20:20] of time and then we're going to look up
[2:20:22] and that pillar fire is going to be in
[2:20:24] the body called Jesus and we're going to
[2:20:26] rise to meet him amen
[2:20:28] as the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:20:30] and our bringing me and thank God for
[2:20:32] what the Holy Ghost reminded us of a man
[2:20:35] it's just not going to heaven there's
[2:20:37] not a fairytale he's got a place for us
[2:20:40] a million in nitrogen people think of
[2:20:43] the prophet of God mentioned it and he
[2:20:45] says not just getting over there instead
[2:20:47] of just from flying around on on clouds
[2:20:49] Easter than playing hearts no no there
[2:20:52] there's going to be those that have been
[2:20:54] playing harps maybe and maybe playing
[2:20:57] guitars and other instruments but the
[2:21:00] brighter Christ is going to sit with him
[2:21:02] in the throne amen
[2:21:04] we have got a position so I pray the
[2:21:07] grace of God help us brothers sister and
[2:21:09] we're going on to that position by the
[2:21:13] grace of God is he changing us not that
[2:21:16] we have been changed we are being
[2:21:18] changed and we will be changed by the
[2:21:21] grace of God the other thing is as a
[2:21:23] brother brother coming out of the
[2:21:26] nominations even to the message I'm in
[2:21:28] the message I'm in the message but I've
[2:21:30] kept telling you lately the devil is in
[2:21:32] the message too amen and knowing that
[2:21:35] the devil believes the message more than
[2:21:38] some believers because the Bible's the
[2:21:40] Bible tells us that he has come down
[2:21:42] with great wrath knowing his time his
[2:21:44] shirt he has seen what God has done and
[2:21:47] it's and it's EDIUS according to the
[2:21:49] scriptures the word he has seen what God
[2:21:51] has done and what God is doing and he
[2:21:54] knows what it whether the significance
[2:21:57] of it in his ministry in his life says
[2:22:00] to remember the devil believes the
[2:22:02] message knowing that it has given the
[2:22:04] devil the faith he has given Satan the
[2:22:08] faith to do what he's doing
[2:22:09] knowing is time he's short and he's got
[2:22:14] ran against against against God and
[2:22:18] against the children of God the seed of
[2:22:20] God and so on a million brothers getting
[2:22:23] is going to get worse and worse and
[2:22:25] worse you know yeah and not just
[2:22:28] politically and and moral there in the
[2:22:31] world is going to get worse and worse
[2:22:32] and worse spiritually and religiously
[2:22:35] amen
[2:22:36] it's going to get so bad I tell you and
[2:22:39] we're not very far from it it's gonna
[2:22:42] get so bad he said that if he didn't
[2:22:44] shorten time there'll be no flesh ain't
[2:22:47] a man that's how bad it's gonna get or
[2:22:50] you think oh they're gonna get to a
[2:22:52] place we're not gonna believe in God or
[2:22:53] they'll believe in God all right but not
[2:22:55] believe God amen and there they and
[2:22:59] brother the hours coming I preach them
[2:23:01] way back in 1984-85 in Virginia and I
[2:23:05] said hear it and I said and that was
[2:23:08] many years ago my brother brought it
[2:23:11] about the Prophet having having been
[2:23:13] here for now for over 50 years he's gone
[2:23:15] he's gone for over 50 years the seals
[2:23:19] have been open I love over 50 years
[2:23:21] almost 60 years and we are still here we
[2:23:26] are still here and I reminded them in
[2:23:28] 1985 they said listen I said after the
[2:23:31] bride is gone I said there's going to be
[2:23:34] still people here preaching God has sent
[2:23:37] Apophis amen because they'll miss the
[2:23:41] resurrection they'll miss the rapture
[2:23:43] amen
[2:23:44] and I don't know the one day something
[2:23:47] is going to really happen
[2:23:49] and it's going to shocked them is going
[2:23:51] to shock them into the reality that all
[2:23:54] the wraps from us already took place and
[2:23:58] the part of God says something to say to
[2:24:00] them yes and you missed it
[2:24:02] a man sir brother is not what God has
[2:24:05] done they didn't miss that they were
[2:24:09] still believing that there was no breach
[2:24:11] of that but what God is doing is he's
[2:24:15] taking the message of the hour the
[2:24:17] revelation of the word
[2:24:19] and he is bringing us to perfection for
[2:24:23] the resurrection
[2:24:24] and the rapture that he has bringing us
[2:24:27] to maturity so that we're going to act
[2:24:30] on the word as the baby was saved right
[2:24:33] here and he said for if ye love them
[2:24:36] which love you what reward have you a
[2:24:40] man and it says you do not do know or do
[2:24:44] not even the publicans the same and he
[2:24:48] went on and he said and he salute your
[2:24:51] brethren only and he said what do we
[2:24:54] need more than others brother I tell you
[2:24:57] this he said do not even the publicans
[2:24:58] so I'll turn to this rather it is it's
[2:25:03] it's got to go beyond just this having
[2:25:05] this right doctrine and I believe God
[2:25:08] sent a prophet and I believe this and I
[2:25:10] believe that whether it's got a it's got
[2:25:12] we got to let God can take control and
[2:25:15] bring us to maturity and sons and
[2:25:19] daughters of God we got a bit too mature
[2:25:22] not not mature but Allah believers are
[2:25:25] saying when I God did this God did this
[2:25:26] God did that but what's he doing God did
[2:25:30] this God today but what's he doing in
[2:25:32] your life well he brought me out of
[2:25:35] denomination and he brought me out of
[2:25:37] this it showed me that but what else is
[2:25:39] he doing and why did he do that it's all
[2:25:42] for a reason we were coming up because
[2:25:45] we're going somewhere amen and he and he
[2:25:48] said he specified where we're going and
[2:25:50] again the trophies were coming out of it
[2:25:53] out of Egypt it came out to go into the
[2:25:56] Promised Land
[2:25:57] oh I like what he was talking about John
[2:25:59] Taylor amen last night last night and
[2:26:02] Jen Kayla being an old man and he
[2:26:06] anything he went and took the whole area
[2:26:09] that was given to him whereas the others
[2:26:11] and the others went on and just just
[2:26:14] took a little bit of it and settle down
[2:26:16] and so on
[2:26:18] that's right amen conquering or settling
[2:26:22] don't settle down no we're gonna settle
[2:26:28] and that's to be in the throne
[2:26:29] it may have settle in the throne but I
[2:26:32] do until we get to that place we gotta
[2:26:34] we gotta conquer and conquer and conquer
[2:26:37] and we're conquer and if there's any one
[2:26:39] you've got to conquer the greatest and
[2:26:40] the most is yourself
[2:26:42] amen and the census of your flesh by the
[2:26:47] grace of Almighty God bringing that
[2:26:49] subject of the word and pressing and
[2:26:51] pressing and pressing on by the grace of
[2:26:53] God to the change of our bodies we're in
[2:26:57] a battle were in a war by the grace of
[2:26:59] Almighty God we are ordained we retain -
[2:27:04] cuz the Bible says we are more than
[2:27:06] conquerors
[2:27:07] why because Jesus fought the battle won
[2:27:10] the prize now
[2:27:12] Wuerffel we're we're running the race -
[2:27:14] and pressing on to obtain the price amen
[2:27:19] oh well I don't have to worry about it
[2:27:21] she's going to give it to me
[2:27:22] well then if Jesus to give it said
[2:27:25] brother he's got to overcome the flesh
[2:27:28] he's got to destroy this he's got to
[2:27:30] turn I overcome that in our lives by the
[2:27:33] grace of God so that we we are dead to
[2:27:36] ourselves dead to the flesh we got to
[2:27:39] present our bodies as living sacrifices
[2:27:41] a May let's be living for Jesus morning
[2:27:45] noon and night
[2:27:46] amen you think of it when you go anyway
[2:27:49] when you get up in the morning you're
[2:27:51] you're going to talk to him for the day
[2:27:53] you're going to talk to him and when you
[2:27:55] when you laid yourself down at night and
[2:27:57] pray the grace of God be with us let's
[2:28:01] just st. salute
[2:28:02] if you salute your brethren only what do
[2:28:04] ye more than others do not even the
[2:28:07] public and so and then he said in verse
[2:28:09] 48 be therefore perfect even as your
[2:28:14] father which is heaven in evidence
[2:28:16] perfect and again I let it
[2:28:19] just recently that it is not a sinless
[2:28:22] perfection because the body is not
[2:28:26] sinless a man the soul is but not
[2:28:30] dividing we're new creatures on the
[2:28:33] inside of the inside but how am I going
[2:28:35] to be perfect as God in evidence perfect
[2:28:37] and our brother Scofield brings it out
[2:28:39] he said it is a it is a it is a
[2:28:42] spiritual maturity it should be mature
[2:28:46] as God is mature a man not religious
[2:28:50] babies a man no no no we got a mature we
[2:28:54] go ahead Paul Paul with Deanie with the
[2:28:56] Hebrews and he said I gotta feed you
[2:28:58] with milk I gotta give you milk I gotta
[2:29:00] give you milk he said why because they
[2:29:02] can't take the meat of the word and
[2:29:04] there are a lot of so-called believers
[2:29:06] that can't take the meat of the word
[2:29:08] Amen you've got to give a milk because
[2:29:11] they are babies he's suing he said when
[2:29:14] you and we got to go beyond that because
[2:29:17] again as the prophet said that God is
[2:29:19] not a grandpa and you don't have
[2:29:22] grandchildren and grandsons and
[2:29:24] granddaughters they got sons and
[2:29:26] daughters as father he we are his sons
[2:29:30] and daughters and God he in the person
[2:29:34] of Christ we are his brothers and
[2:29:36] sisters when it goes beyond that to
[2:29:38] being the bright Amen
[2:29:40] of the Lord Jesus Christ so let's be
[2:29:43] mature as God is mature amen
[2:29:47] to act on the world as God stands on his
[2:29:51] word and speaks his word amen not
[2:29:54] children going around you know doing
[2:29:56] this doing this doing his son and
[2:29:58] they've constantly got to be got to be
[2:30:01] corrected constantly got to do this no
[2:30:04] but after they reach a certain age they
[2:30:06] know Amen you train them you train them
[2:30:10] out they reach a certain age they won't
[2:30:12] do this they won't do that and they're
[2:30:14] going on to perfection by the grace of
[2:30:16] God and they're becoming perfect as mum
[2:30:19] and dad mature as well
[2:30:20] one day it is mature a man by the grace
[2:30:24] of God as it is in the natural suitors
[2:30:26] in the spiritual and we don't become
[2:30:30] mature there's something wrong with its
[2:30:31] mentally a man it's the grace of God
[2:30:35] that we're going to mature so that we're
[2:30:37] going to act on the word and we're going
[2:30:39] to take God Eddie's word they mean
[2:30:43] because we are mature
[2:30:46] let's not dishonor as our brother
[2:30:49] brought of the resurrection and let's
[2:30:54] not be a settler you don't get don't you
[2:30:57] well I'm going to settle in the message
[2:30:59] no you better not because you got to go
[2:31:02] on he brought that up we have you dig
[2:31:04] dig deeper you're going to get more
[2:31:05] water of the revealed word amen brother
[2:31:10] amen the power of God said the more you
[2:31:13] hear the tapes and the more you get into
[2:31:15] this and study this the more is going to
[2:31:17] be revealed a man and again I just said
[2:31:21] it recently if I were to God said I know
[2:31:23] it's not striking you the way that it
[2:31:25] should he said it's not striking me the
[2:31:28] way that it should but there's going to
[2:31:30] come a generation that it would strike
[2:31:32] the way that it should didn't strike
[2:31:34] them because the are was and then for
[2:31:36] the rapture and the resurrection God
[2:31:39] Elvis brother that man by the grace of
[2:31:42] God don't dishonor what God has done and
[2:31:44] why God has done it don't let still have
[2:31:48] this honor what God has done and what
[2:31:50] God is doing
[2:31:52] amen amen thank God for that for that
[2:31:55] word and that that warning today because
[2:31:58] many are dishonouring what God has done
[2:32:00] Oh many are dishonoring what God has
[2:32:05] done because with the Provident mistakes
[2:32:08] and they've all their mistakes amen we
[2:32:14] all got mistakes but the word of the
[2:32:17] Lord was perfect and they're deciding
[2:32:20] what God has done in their finding fault
[2:32:23] here finding fault they're finding fault
[2:32:24] with one another
[2:32:25] listen to prophet of God say one time he
[2:32:27] said I'd rather
[2:32:28] I'd rather he fell oh with a with a
[2:32:31] brother that's got wrong doctrine and he
[2:32:34] said in her right spirit he said then he
[2:32:37] said then fellowship with somebody that
[2:32:39] got right doctrine and a wrong spirit
[2:32:42] and I've been dealing with that for over
[2:32:44] 50 years
[2:32:45] believers they got great doctrines with
[2:32:48] wrong spirits a million and sometimes
[2:32:51] they're in denominational realms find
[2:32:55] individuals college they got a better
[2:32:56] spirit a man and better attitudes we got
[2:33:03] to keep our attitude right our spirits
[2:33:04] right the prophet of God said they said
[2:33:06] least he said if a man got a right
[2:33:08] spirit he said God can change his
[2:33:10] doctrine praise the name of the Lord
[2:33:15] so God elbows brothers sisters that
[2:33:17] we're going to mature as God is be
[2:33:19] perfect as God has purposed perfect
[2:33:21] being mature as God as mature is the
[2:33:25] maturity of godliness
[2:33:27] he said not sinless perfection but God
[2:33:34] maturity in accepting the word you can
[2:33:40] take correction you can take instruction
[2:33:43] in righteousness by the grace of God
[2:33:46] because you mature and you're
[2:33:48] recognizing your need for it thank the
[2:33:52] Lord
[2:33:55] other thoughts here that our brother
[2:33:58] mentioned but I won't comment on it we
[2:34:00] can maybe fellowship around as we go to
[2:34:02] our brother marks later this afternoon
[2:34:05] but again God looks at the heart not the
[2:34:08] flesh is not what we're saying
[2:34:11] is what we're believing in our souls now
[2:34:15] what's in our flesh is what's in our
[2:34:16] souls by the grace of Almighty God and
[2:34:21] God's race to us that we're not numbered
[2:34:23] with those who after the rapture will be
[2:34:25] still here preaching that God has sent a
[2:34:28] prophet failing what failing to mature
[2:34:33] in the revelation of the message that
[2:34:36] will take us on take us on to perfect
[2:34:39] faith for the rapture
[2:34:42] Bhama Gaza we got to come to this for
[2:34:44] the rapture and you know what he said in
[2:34:48] perfect faith that means a lot of
[2:34:50] breaking down for me the Prophet the
[2:34:54] Prophet he said it means a lot of
[2:34:57] breaking down for brother Neville the
[2:34:59] Deacons the elders so it means a lot of
[2:35:02] breaking down for us to come to perfect
[2:35:07] faith I tell you it's really a test of
[2:35:15] our love for him lovest thou me more
[2:35:19] than these what do you love most and
[2:35:25] then you know if you love him you want
[2:35:26] to get out of here and you want to be
[2:35:28] with him but I'll tell you most people
[2:35:30] don't want to leave this whole world or
[2:35:32] to content in it but I'll tell you that
[2:35:35] God's gonna let it a the poppet of God
[2:35:37] said the bride will not go into tribute
[2:35:40] or would not suffer death entry in this
[2:35:42] church age book but he said God's gonna
[2:35:44] let us be here for a while and he said
[2:35:46] he said we're going to be tested with
[2:35:48] persecution persecuted he said and then
[2:35:55] he said God take you home it's gonna
[2:35:58] bring out your love for him and that
[2:36:00] your willingness to sacrifice anything
[2:36:03] in everything for him oh but God is
[2:36:07] gonna bless me with this blessed with
[2:36:09] that the thing I want God to bless me
[2:36:11] with his eternal life the resurrection
[2:36:14] and the rapture that's the most
[2:36:15] important thing amen
[2:36:26] rather
[2:36:30] this Kiba keep his Commandments with
[2:36:33] love for him and if we love Him we will
[2:36:37] love the sons and daughters of God your
[2:36:40] brothers and sisters in Christ will have
[2:36:44] a right spirit and a right attitude by
[2:36:47] the grace of God and he read the
[2:37:00] scripture which told us that we are the
[2:37:06] temple of God let's remember it these
[2:37:15] other things that I could say but we'll
[2:37:17] we'll leave it at that
[2:37:18] just one mother scripture that he
[2:37:21] reference I like it
[2:37:34] brethren I count not myself to have
[2:37:41] apprehended God bless your brother thank
[2:37:45] God for reminding us of this word most
[2:37:49] we would think I said I don't have
[2:37:50] anything else to do now I'm ready you'll
[2:37:56] only know that when you get there yeah I
[2:38:00] was ready I count not myself I many have
[2:38:06] this attitude like Paulette I like what
[2:38:10] a bother but Paul last night tremendous
[2:38:14] the probably God
[2:38:16] he got so bad that he thought he thought
[2:38:19] that he well he did have a nervous
[2:38:21] breakdown and then even he got so bad
[2:38:24] even after the opening of the seals he
[2:38:26] thought he was losing his mind because
[2:38:29] he saw so much going on and did him with
[2:38:33] so many spirits brother like Paul we
[2:38:38] count not ourselves sort of apprehended
[2:38:41] what for to keep ourselves on our guard
[2:38:46] that's good brother
[2:38:48] thank God do we have that attitude in
[2:38:53] that spirit so we're always on our toes
[2:38:55] I kind of nod myself to have apprehended
[2:38:58] but this one thing I do forgetting those
[2:39:02] things which are behind and reaching
[2:39:05] forth unto those things which are before
[2:39:07] I press toward the mark for the prize of
[2:39:13] the high calling of God the upward call
[2:39:18] of God in Christ Jesus and notice verse
[2:39:25] 15 he said let us therefore as many as
[2:39:32] be perfect amazing well I'm perfect if
[2:39:40] you are you've got this attitude in this
[2:39:41] spirit while you're in this place
[2:39:46] let as many as therefore as be perfect
[2:39:48] be thus minded and if in anything you be
[2:39:52] otherwise minded God shall reveal even
[2:39:55] this unto you a man again verse 10 that
[2:40:05] I may know him and the power of his
[2:40:09] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[2:40:13] sufferings being made conformable unto
[2:40:16] his death if by any means I might attain
[2:40:22] unto the resurrection of the Dead God
[2:40:27] blesses that we're going to press on by
