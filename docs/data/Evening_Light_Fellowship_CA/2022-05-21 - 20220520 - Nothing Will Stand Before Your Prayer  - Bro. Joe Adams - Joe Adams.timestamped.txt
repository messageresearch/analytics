[56:25] adams and his wife amen so
[56:28] to
[56:29] newfoundland amen maybe they live in
[56:31] newfoundland
[56:32] because i think all of north america is
[56:34] newfoundland
[56:36] yeah because
[56:38] when they landed here of course that was
[56:39] it they got access to to all of north
[56:42] america so we thank the lord for that
[56:44] amen do god be the glory and we thank
[56:47] him for the bringing our brother here to
[56:49] minister to us
[56:51] and from the united states what's what's
[56:53] the state
[56:55] louisiana

[56:58] amen so uh i i think i've been to
[57:02] louisiana uh it's been quite a while ago
[57:04] now a number of years ago
[57:06] but again it was to because another
[57:08] brother from i think from canada
[57:11] was ministering down there in louisiana
[57:14] and not sure it might have been brother
[57:15] biscuit and that's many years ago
[57:19] so we pray the grace of god to the bride
[57:21] of christ in louisiana
[57:23] we pray the grace of god to the right of
[57:24] christ here as he sends a brother from
[57:27] louisiana to minister to us amen so
[57:30] we're going to turn the service over to
[57:32] our brother and i've encouraged him to
[57:34] take as long as he wants
[57:37] preach as god lays it upon his heart
[57:39] amen whatever god lays on his side oh
[57:41] yeah
[57:42] when it comes to the time our brother
[57:43] matthew again has removed the clock
[57:47] amen
[57:48] so we'll just we won't bother to look at
[57:50] our own
[57:52] so
[57:53] maybe someday brother matthew would be
[57:54] out there with something to to remove
[57:56] all of our watches
[57:58] amen
[57:59] so brother sister why because we're
[58:01] going from time to eternity
[58:04] by the grace of god
[58:05] so i pray the grace of god that eternity
[58:07] is going to have a greater and greater
[58:09] influence on us in the going forth of
[58:11] the word because brother it's the
[58:13] eternal word and it comes in the time to
[58:16] catch the seed of god the elect of god
[58:18] amen to take us back to eternity by the
[58:22] grace of god amen so this is all a part
[58:25] of god's plan of what god has ordained
[58:28] and predestinated amen to get us back

[1:08:47] amen we're going to turn our bibles here
[1:08:49] tonight

[1:08:53] okay good
[1:08:56] amen we're going to look here in hebrews
[1:08:58] 11 and verse 1. this is a very very very
[1:09:00] for mature familiar scripture reading
[1:09:02] for all of us but i want to speak to you
[1:09:04] i've been on a series back home on god
[1:09:06] does impossible math and i want to speak
[1:09:08] to you tonight by the grace of god
[1:09:10] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:09:13] now we're very familiar many of us are
[1:09:15] probably very familiar with what quote
[1:09:16] i'll be pulling from
[1:09:18] uh tomorrow night we'll be speaking if
[1:09:21] the lord willing will not even cancer so
[1:09:22] we're going to take this a little series
[1:09:24] this weekend to try to elevate your
[1:09:26] faith
[1:09:27] because we as a believer must realize
[1:09:28] nothing will stand before our prayer not
[1:09:31] even cancer so no matter what you're
[1:09:33] facing tonight no matter what you're
[1:09:34] facing tomorrow no matter what you're
[1:09:36] facing next week next month in time to
[1:09:38] terry next year nothing will stand
[1:09:40] before the believer's prayer
[1:09:42] how many of you are believers tonight
[1:09:44] then god's here to answer and god's here
[1:09:46] to meet your needs we find here in the
[1:09:48] bible says now faith is the substance of
[1:09:50] things hoped for
[1:09:52] the evidence of things not seen
[1:09:55] for it or for by it the elders attain a
[1:09:57] good report through faith we understand
[1:10:00] that the worlds were framed by the word
[1:10:01] of god so that things which are seen
[1:10:04] were not made of things which do appear
[1:10:07] for by faith abel offered unto god a
[1:10:10] more excellent sacrifice than cain
[1:10:12] by which he obtained witness that he was
[1:10:15] righteous god testifying of his gifts
[1:10:18] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[1:10:21] by faith enoch when he was translated
[1:10:23] that he should not see death and was not
[1:10:26] found because god had translated him
[1:10:29] for before his translation he had a
[1:10:31] testimony
[1:10:32] that he pleased god
[1:10:35] by faith it is impossible or excuse me
[1:10:37] but without faith it is impossible to
[1:10:39] please him for he that cometh to god
[1:10:42] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:10:44] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:10:47] him
[1:10:48] by faith noah being warned of god of
[1:10:50] things not seen as yet moved with fear
[1:10:53] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[1:10:54] house
[1:10:56] by which he condemned the world and
[1:10:58] became heir of righteousness which is by
[1:11:00] faith by faith abraham when he was
[1:11:02] called to go out into a place which he
[1:11:04] should have to receive for an
[1:11:05] inheritance he obeyed and went out
[1:11:08] not knowing where he went or whether he
[1:11:10] went by faith he's sojourn in the land
[1:11:13] of promise as in a strange country
[1:11:14] dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and
[1:11:17] jacob the heirs with him of the same
[1:11:19] promise for he looked for a city which
[1:11:21] had foundations whose builder and maker
[1:11:24] is god
[1:11:25] verse 11 through faith also sarah
[1:11:27] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:11:29] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:11:31] past age because she judged him faithful
[1:11:33] who had promised
[1:11:35] therefore sprang evening of one
[1:11:37] and him as good as dead so many as the
[1:11:39] stars of the sky and multitude and as
[1:11:42] the sand which is by the seashore
[1:11:43] innumerable these all died in faith not
[1:11:46] having received the promise
[1:11:49] but having seen them afar off and were
[1:11:51] persuaded of them
[1:11:53] and embrace them and confess that they
[1:11:55] were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
[1:11:58] god bless you you can have your seats
[1:11:59] this evening
[1:12:05] brother joe coffey where are you
[1:12:08] i'm sorry about that buddy
[1:12:11] all i can say is i'm sorry
[1:12:13] i agree with you
[1:12:15] well you know the bible says stay in the
[1:12:17] column where with your calls so
[1:12:19] but i just i just like wow wonderful
[1:12:24] so we know we're not expecting to hear
[1:12:25] from you tonight so
[1:12:27] we will let you sing and do anything
[1:12:28] else that you would like to tonight
[1:12:30] amen so we look here and this is like i
[1:12:33] said a very familiar scripture reading
[1:12:36] and we're going to look at it from the
[1:12:37] aspect of faith and i want to build the
[1:12:38] foundation tonight uh we may not
[1:12:41] have anything special going on after
[1:12:43] service tonight it may wait till
[1:12:44] tomorrow evening after i finish tomorrow
[1:12:46] evening service but just kind of take
[1:12:47] this scripture tonight and take the the
[1:12:49] uh the word that we've just read and
[1:12:51] kind of lay the foundation a lot of
[1:12:53] times we get in our minds sometimes when
[1:12:55] we read about these great men and these
[1:12:57] great women of the bible especially when
[1:12:59] you read through hebrews 11 and you see
[1:13:01] all the things that they've done and we
[1:13:03] think man these are super human beings
[1:13:07] you read about i was like man they
[1:13:08] didn't have any trials they didn't have
[1:13:10] any struggles life must have been great
[1:13:12] life must have been grand or they just
[1:13:14] must have been special supernatural
[1:13:16] people right you know anyway that's how
[1:13:18] i read the bible sometimes like wow
[1:13:20] these people are amazing but you know
[1:13:22] what that's not the case there is as
[1:13:24] much human as we are tonight
[1:13:27] every one of those that we just read
[1:13:28] about they had their ups they had their
[1:13:31] downs they had they got sick they had
[1:13:33] their backaches they had headaches some
[1:13:35] of them got arthritis they had heart
[1:13:37] trouble they had all the same things
[1:13:39] that you and i deal with even up here in
[1:13:41] newfoundland canada
[1:13:43] you know they had their disappointments
[1:13:45] they had times where things were going
[1:13:47] great then they had times where they
[1:13:49] dipped into a valley and things wasn't
[1:13:51] going so great but as we realize in this
[1:13:53] portion of scripture nowhere does it
[1:13:55] mention anything about their mistakes
[1:13:58] nowhere does it mention anything about
[1:14:00] their failures we don't read anything
[1:14:01] about their disappointments see but the
[1:14:04] bible says they all died in faith
[1:14:07] they wasn't giving credence to the
[1:14:09] things that they suffered they weren't
[1:14:11] giving credence and voice to the things
[1:14:13] that they went through they all died in
[1:14:15] faith notice they didn't die of
[1:14:17] faithless people
[1:14:19] they didn't let their trial overcome
[1:14:21] them they wasn't overcome by their
[1:14:23] situation no they all died believing
[1:14:26] they all died persuaded they saw the
[1:14:29] promise and they were destined to make
[1:14:31] the promise but tom didn't allow them to
[1:14:33] reach the promise but they embraced the
[1:14:36] promise as having already seen it and i
[1:14:38] think i'm looking at other sons of
[1:14:40] abraham tonight daughters of abraham
[1:14:42] tonight we have seen the promise of god
[1:14:44] not only have we seen it but we as a
[1:14:46] people we've embraced it tonight we know
[1:14:49] who we are we know where we come from we
[1:14:51] know where we're headed back to and we
[1:14:52] had to realize that the things that we
[1:14:54] go through in this life these things
[1:14:57] don't define who we are because we've
[1:14:59] already been defined by the heavenly
[1:15:00] father
[1:15:02] so i'm glad tonight to know when i take
[1:15:04] my last breath god is not looking at my
[1:15:07] failures god is not looking at my
[1:15:09] humanity he's not looking at where i may
[1:15:11] be gassed on the car a little too much
[1:15:12] here or a little bit this way here and
[1:15:15] allow my humanity to get in the way and
[1:15:17] i stumble up out god is looking for one
[1:15:19] thing brother sister he's looking at
[1:15:21] does he have faith did he obey my word
[1:15:24] did he admire adhere to the promises of
[1:15:26] god was he hanging on to it did he
[1:15:29] embrace the promise of god did he
[1:15:30] embrace the opening of the word did he
[1:15:32] embrace the open of the seventh seal or
[1:15:34] did he just put it aside i'm glad to
[1:15:36] know tonight that god is not looking at
[1:15:38] my failures god is looking at my faith
[1:15:40] tonight and that's what he's looking
[1:15:42] there for you
[1:15:44] and we find in the scripture it says
[1:15:46] that faith is the substance of things
[1:15:48] hoped for
[1:15:49] and the evidence of things not seen now
[1:15:52] faith this word faith means a firm
[1:15:54] persuasion
[1:15:57] it's a firm persuasion means you can't
[1:15:59] be moved
[1:16:00] you got faith
[1:16:03] and the word substance here means a
[1:16:05] foundation
[1:16:06] so a firm
[1:16:08] foundation
[1:16:09] amen the the faith is a firm foundation
[1:16:13] of things hoped for but it's the
[1:16:14] evidence that word evidence is proof
[1:16:17] it's to prove whether you feel it
[1:16:18] whether you see it whether you're
[1:16:20] anything it doesn't matter you got the
[1:16:22] proof because why you got faith amen
[1:16:26] now i understand the prophet of god will
[1:16:27] tell us faith is not something that you
[1:16:30] work up faith is something that you have
[1:16:34] can everybody say amen tonight
[1:16:36] you mean brother joe i don't have to
[1:16:38] work this up not tonight
[1:16:40] maybe if you're a pentecostal you go to
[1:16:42] pentecostal church you may have to work
[1:16:43] it up a little bit but not tonight
[1:16:46] because see faith is not something that
[1:16:47] you work up faith is something that you
[1:16:50] have
[1:16:51] amen come on church amen tonight i got
[1:16:55] faith even when i don't feel like it i
[1:16:56] got it
[1:16:58] prohibited says now faith being the
[1:17:00] substance and there we find out in
[1:17:03] hebrews what faith was and what those
[1:17:06] did who had faith
[1:17:08] see there's many times that people have
[1:17:11] had faith today and tomorrow they
[1:17:13] haven't got it
[1:17:15] and the next day there's something and
[1:17:17] then there's something else
[1:17:18] but when god wants anchors to get this
[1:17:21] point when god once anchors it and you
[1:17:24] see it there's nothing ever going to
[1:17:27] move you from it amen oh
[1:17:30] hallelujah
[1:17:31] man when god god anchors out in your
[1:17:34] heart that you're going to be healed are
[1:17:36] you going to be delivered or that prayer
[1:17:38] that you've been praying that you've
[1:17:40] been asking god for when it anchors in
[1:17:42] your heart and you finally see it you
[1:17:44] finally embrace it he says there's
[1:17:46] nothing ever going to move you from it
[1:17:49] what are you saying brother joe i'm
[1:17:50] telling you tonight as a son as a
[1:17:53] daughter of god nothing will stand
[1:17:55] before your prayer
[1:17:56] because you recognize who you are you
[1:17:59] recognize i'm a son of god i'm a
[1:18:01] daughter of god i'm a child of abraham
[1:18:04] i'm the royal seed tonight and if
[1:18:06] nothing could stand before my father
[1:18:08] abraham then nothing can stand before me
[1:18:10] because i'm his child
[1:18:13] notice now what he says he goes you're
[1:18:15] just poking reaching pursuing and
[1:18:17] pursuing his adventure without authority
[1:18:19] see you're just trying this and you're
[1:18:21] just trying that
[1:18:23] and going this way and right here right
[1:18:25] there you haven't got faith yet
[1:18:28] but when
[1:18:29] see there it is church but when
[1:18:32] you know we have all had been in times
[1:18:34] where we poked
[1:18:35] we pursued
[1:18:37] we've hoped we tried this and we tried
[1:18:40] that hoping it was going to be the
[1:18:42] special key that unlocks the door to a
[1:18:44] happy life
[1:18:46] only to be
[1:18:47] disappointed
[1:18:49] all right maybe i'm just preaching maybe
[1:18:51] hey do i got louisiana friends on
[1:18:53] tonight
[1:18:56] you know brother brown will tell us this
[1:18:57] body is controlled by five senses
[1:19:00] see
[1:19:01] taste smell hear touch
[1:19:04] five senses controls this body
[1:19:07] you know somebody slaps you in the face
[1:19:11] that super sense just
[1:19:13] sometimes it just kind of pushes to the
[1:19:14] back for a minute and there's another
[1:19:16] sense that rises up
[1:19:18] because you just been touched
[1:19:20] not by an angel
[1:19:22] but you know think about this you know
[1:19:24] sometimes you can smell different smells
[1:19:27] and it brings you back to something as a
[1:19:28] child
[1:19:30] or you hear a hearse something a song or
[1:19:33] something and it takes you back to a
[1:19:35] fond memory or it could even take you
[1:19:37] back to maybe a tragic memory so this
[1:19:40] body of ours is controlled and sometimes
[1:19:42] we allow the things that we see taste
[1:19:45] smell feel and touch control our
[1:19:48] attitude and dictate how we come to the
[1:19:50] house of god
[1:19:52] you wait till sunday morning he don't
[1:19:54] believe me especially when you got
[1:19:55] children
[1:19:56] brother joe i see you holding a baby
[1:19:58] there
[1:19:59] oh the devil will love nothing more than
[1:20:01] on sunday morning to get the husband and
[1:20:02] wife kind of going at it a little bit on
[1:20:04] the way to church because the baby won't
[1:20:06] stop crying
[1:20:07] i remember one of my first evangelist
[1:20:08] preaching trips we just had a little
[1:20:10] child
[1:20:12] uh
[1:20:13] brother uh
[1:20:16] i don't forgot his name that's sad ain't
[1:20:17] it
[1:20:18] john yeah man i'm getting old brother
[1:20:21] john's sister blocker they know us that
[1:20:22] we have you know we have four children
[1:20:24] and lauren is my oldest she's now 19 but
[1:20:26] this is when she was a little bitty baby
[1:20:28] and she had a little pacifier that we
[1:20:30] just chose to leave that thing at home
[1:20:31] we're gonna be super parents that
[1:20:33] weekend and we're on a six-hour trip and
[1:20:35] this child cried the entire time
[1:20:39] i didn't want to preach
[1:20:40] no i wanted to get that kid out of my
[1:20:42] car
[1:20:43] i'm like honey don't you ever ever ever
[1:20:46] ever leave home that's better than a
[1:20:48] visa don't leave home without it
[1:20:51] that kid cried and cried and that had me
[1:20:53] so out of source i wasn't ready to
[1:20:55] preach
[1:20:56] you know and sometimes we allow our
[1:20:58] senses we allow the things that we go
[1:21:00] through the difficulties to rub us the
[1:21:02] wrong way and to do these things but
[1:21:04] brother brown will tell us that he says
[1:21:05] that none of these see taste smell fill
[1:21:07] and hear and touch none of these declare
[1:21:10] faith
[1:21:10] he said faith is the sixth sense known
[1:21:13] to some he would say as mental telepathy
[1:21:16] he says but see
[1:21:17] faith it's above all the five senses of
[1:21:20] the human body see faith is the only
[1:21:23] direct and positive sense it's the sixth
[1:21:26] sense faith is more than sight faith is
[1:21:28] more than feeling you don't feel faith
[1:21:31] you don't taste faith you don't smell
[1:21:33] faith you don't see faith faith is the
[1:21:36] substance and the word there is
[1:21:37] foundation so faith is the foundation of
[1:21:40] things hoped for and the evidence are
[1:21:42] the proof of things not seen
[1:21:45] amen so faith is something that you have
[1:21:48] and you have it alone
[1:21:51] i can't give you my faith you can't give
[1:21:53] me your faith
[1:21:55] see
[1:21:56] now there's times that we feel like well
[1:21:58] brother joe i don't have faith how many
[1:21:59] ever felt that
[1:22:01] okay good well i got a scripture for you
[1:22:03] we find here in romans 12 and verse 3
[1:22:05] we'll read the latter part of it
[1:22:07] god had dealt to every man
[1:22:10] the measure of faith
[1:22:13] so when the devil comes whispering in
[1:22:14] your ears you don't have faith you said
[1:22:16] devil you're a liar because the word
[1:22:17] just says that i got it
[1:22:19] now the god had dealt to every man a
[1:22:22] measure of faith and brother brown will
[1:22:24] tell us now i know that many of us don't
[1:22:26] have faith and i don't have faith to
[1:22:28] make all the promises come true or come
[1:22:30] to pass but i sure wouldn't stand in the
[1:22:32] way of somebody that did have that kind
[1:22:33] of faith he goes i often wish that i had
[1:22:36] the faith like in it to go out on a
[1:22:38] little walk on an afternoon stroll and
[1:22:40] just to walk on up yonder and never come
[1:22:42] back you know that's the kind of faith
[1:22:44] that that we all would like but you know
[1:22:46] what if we don't have that kind of faith
[1:22:48] don't stand in the way of somebody else
[1:22:49] that does have that kind of thing but we
[1:22:52] find there's a spirit of jealousy to try
[1:22:54] to get among the people when they see
[1:22:56] somebody with a supernatural faith or
[1:22:58] faith to really dig in and grab hold of
[1:23:00] it they become jealous because they're
[1:23:02] not where that person is but don't worry
[1:23:04] brother sister god has given every man a
[1:23:06] measure of faith you may not be where
[1:23:09] they are yet but you don't know the
[1:23:10] trials that got them to that point and
[1:23:12] i'm going to change that god will get
[1:23:14] you there if you keep on the
[1:23:15] straightener if you keep trusting god if
[1:23:18] you keep believing god god will show you
[1:23:20] that he is a living god he's not some
[1:23:22] dead god he's not some get a son dead
[1:23:25] dead of some denomination but he's a
[1:23:27] living god working in his people
[1:23:31] notice now
[1:23:32] god has given every one of us a measure
[1:23:35] of faith
[1:23:36] so there's not one of you sitting here
[1:23:38] right now whether you're old whether
[1:23:40] you're young who lacks faith
[1:23:43] so that excuse can be thrown out
[1:23:46] we all have faith some of you have more
[1:23:48] faith than others
[1:23:50] and some of you has less faith than some
[1:23:54] you know that even an atheist has faith
[1:23:58] you might if i take my jacket off do
[1:23:59] y'all preach with your jacket owner off
[1:24:02] there's a hook that means you preach
[1:24:03] with it off
[1:24:05] i'll take that
[1:24:07] he's been teaching me to hook all day
[1:24:11] so we fine notice now to be an atheist
[1:24:13] you've got to have faith
[1:24:15] how many atheists do i have here tonight
[1:24:19] so be an atheist to be an atheist this
[1:24:22] is what you got to believe that nothing
[1:24:24] produced everything that we have today
[1:24:27] that nothing produced everything well
[1:24:30] you got to have some strong faith for
[1:24:32] that
[1:24:33] that non-life produce life
[1:24:36] now gather fathom that one for a minute
[1:24:39] non-life
[1:24:40] produce life
[1:24:44] that randomness produced precision
[1:24:48] and that chaos produced order
[1:24:52] i'm sorry but i'm just gonna believe
[1:24:53] there's a god
[1:24:54] i don't have that kind of faith i got
[1:24:57] faith but i don't have atheist type
[1:24:59] faith they got strong faith
[1:25:02] but you see faith is brotherhood says
[1:25:04] faith isn't it's not something that you
[1:25:05] work up to but it's something that you
[1:25:08] have
[1:25:09] he says now if i was starving and i was
[1:25:12] going to die of starvation and a loaf of
[1:25:14] bread saved my life and the purchase of
[1:25:16] the loaf of bread was 25 cents and
[1:25:19] somebody gave me 25 cents he says now
[1:25:22] he goes just as much as i can see he
[1:25:25] goes and i know that i hold the 25 cents
[1:25:27] which is the buying power of the loaf of
[1:25:29] bread i can be just as happy with the 25
[1:25:32] cents as i could be with the loaf of
[1:25:34] bread
[1:25:35] oh i don't think y'all got that
[1:25:38] i can be just as happy with the 25 cents
[1:25:41] as i could be if i had the loaf of bread
[1:25:44] no that you still ain't catching it
[1:25:46] i could be just as happy with the 25
[1:25:49] cents if i had the loaf of bread if i
[1:25:51] gave you brother john you were dying of
[1:25:53] starvation thank god you're not and i
[1:25:55] gave you 25 cents and you knew that 25
[1:25:58] cents was going to buy you enough bread
[1:26:00] to take care of your family and you went
[1:26:02] down to the store and the store was
[1:26:05] closed but that you knew the store was
[1:26:06] going to open at some point
[1:26:08] it had to open because behind the doors
[1:26:10] behind the glass there was brand in
[1:26:12] there and you knew in your hand was the
[1:26:14] purchasing power of that bread and
[1:26:17] inside behind that door it laid the
[1:26:19] power to keep your family up what would
[1:26:21] you do you wouldn't just back away and
[1:26:22] go home you would stay there until the
[1:26:24] door open what am i telling you church
[1:26:26] with the purchasing power that you have
[1:26:29] in your hand faith it'll open that door
[1:26:31] if you'll just wait long enough
[1:26:33] you'll get there look we're we're
[1:26:35] purchasing power you know you'll be
[1:26:37] healed with purchasing power you know
[1:26:39] you'll be delivered we're purchasing
[1:26:41] power tonight you know you'll overcome
[1:26:43] we're purchasing power to like you know
[1:26:45] that you're going to receive the holy
[1:26:46] ghost with the purchase power tonight
[1:26:48] you know that your body will be changed
[1:26:50] and you'll go in the rapture
[1:26:52] cause you got it you got it
[1:26:55] not that you worked up to it god gave it
[1:26:57] to you
[1:26:58] the purchase power
[1:27:00] he gave you the 25 cents
[1:27:03] he gave you the faith needed to wait
[1:27:06] long enough for those doors to open and
[1:27:08] to go in and pick out exactly what you
[1:27:10] have need of
[1:27:11] see with faith you can do all things
[1:27:14] with faith nothing is
[1:27:16] impossible see god dealt to every one of
[1:27:19] us
[1:27:20] the right measure of purchasing power
[1:27:22] some of you need more than 25 cents
[1:27:24] and he's given it to you
[1:27:26] some of you all you need is 25 cents and
[1:27:29] it's perfect for the situation
[1:27:31] so whatever you're going through god has
[1:27:33] given you the faith needed
[1:27:35] to persevere to overcome and to be
[1:27:38] victorious
[1:27:39] god has done it no man has done this
[1:27:42] and brother brown will tell us in
[1:27:43] confirmation and evidence he said faith
[1:27:46] isn't a myth a myth it is an imagination
[1:27:49] he said it's a substance and anything
[1:27:52] that's a substance isn't a myth it's
[1:27:54] something that you actually get a hold
[1:27:57] of
[1:27:58] and that's what faith is
[1:28:00] he says there is where so many people
[1:28:02] fail to get it they have a hope instead
[1:28:04] of faith you hope that you will now
[1:28:07] there's times in our life we prayed
[1:28:10] but we pray from a hopeful standpoint
[1:28:12] and not from the standpoint of faith
[1:28:15] god please you hear people please you we
[1:28:18] don't have to beg god
[1:28:20] the believer should never ask god please
[1:28:23] we're not and he's not a god to where
[1:28:25] he's giving out food to beggars though
[1:28:27] he does we're not beggars we're sons and
[1:28:29] daughters of god
[1:28:31] the bible tells us we should come to god
[1:28:32] boldly
[1:28:34] we don't have to come begging we're not
[1:28:36] servants
[1:28:37] we're his children
[1:28:39] he goes notice now he says they have a
[1:28:42] hope instead of faith you hope you will
[1:28:45] you kind of have an imaginary faith
[1:28:46] because that you feel that well you've
[1:28:48] appropriated that he goes but when
[1:28:50] actually you've got a hold of faith it's
[1:28:53] a substance it's something real then you
[1:28:56] hold that and that's what brings it
[1:28:59] when you've got faith
[1:29:01] that's what brings it so now we find
[1:29:05] god give is every given every man a
[1:29:07] measure of faith we look here in second
[1:29:10] corinthians 10
[1:29:13] i'm going to go here for a few minutes
[1:29:14] tonight and we're going to look well
[1:29:16] does the faith that i get does it always
[1:29:18] maintain at that level
[1:29:20] because sometimes some of us are at
[1:29:23] greater faith than others some of us are
[1:29:24] less faith than most
[1:29:26] but we find through the scripture here
[1:29:28] in second corinthians 10 and verse 12
[1:29:30] for we dare not make ourselves of the
[1:29:32] number or compare ourselves with some
[1:29:34] that condem that commend themselves but
[1:29:37] they measuring themselves by themselves
[1:29:39] and comparing themselves among
[1:29:40] themselves are not wise
[1:29:42] but we were not boasting things without
[1:29:44] our measure but according to the measure
[1:29:46] of the rule which god had distributed to
[1:29:49] us notice he's given us this right a
[1:29:51] measure to reach even unto you what is
[1:29:54] that he's given us faith for we
[1:29:56] stretched not ourselves beyond our
[1:29:58] measure as though we reached not unto
[1:30:00] you for we are come as far as you also
[1:30:03] in the preaching of the gospel of christ
[1:30:06] not boasting of things without our
[1:30:07] measure that is of other men's labors
[1:30:10] but having hope when your faith is
[1:30:13] increased
[1:30:16] so
[1:30:16] i want to focus there for a minute your
[1:30:18] faith doesn't have to maintain at the
[1:30:20] con
[1:30:21] the present condition that it's set but
[1:30:23] our faith can be increased
[1:30:26] so not only does god give you faith but
[1:30:29] not he allows that faith to grow he
[1:30:31] allows that faith to to uh to flourish
[1:30:34] we know there's been times you've you've
[1:30:36] prayed for people or you've seen
[1:30:38] different ones that you pray for they
[1:30:39] may need healing in the body or
[1:30:41] direction for a job or deliver from from
[1:30:44] some kind of spirit and when god comes
[1:30:45] down and meets that need and you know it
[1:30:47] and you've been in prayer for it and god
[1:30:49] does it the way that you ask what does
[1:30:51] it do it doesn't diminish your faith no
[1:30:53] it builds your faith
[1:30:55] it increases your faith to trust god
[1:30:57] more
[1:30:58] trust god for your trial trust god for
[1:31:00] your situation when you see god do it
[1:31:02] for others
[1:31:04] when we hear of a testimony of how god
[1:31:06] moved in a supernatural way for a
[1:31:07] believer that doesn't decrease our faith
[1:31:10] it increases our faith
[1:31:13] so brother man will say faith has great
[1:31:15] big muscles
[1:31:17] and hair on his chest
[1:31:20] now i like to go to the gym
[1:31:22] i like to work out i've actually
[1:31:24] i did that today
[1:31:27] and it felt good
[1:31:29] but when i first started working out man
[1:31:32] i ate
[1:31:33] it hurt
[1:31:34] that lactic acid went all over my body
[1:31:36] and it just tore me apart i had little
[1:31:39] wimpy arms
[1:31:40] you know
[1:31:41] because that's when it starts you start
[1:31:42] wimpy and that's kind of how our faith
[1:31:45] is it starts wimpy so what are you
[1:31:47] saying brother joe for somebody to be a
[1:31:49] bodybuilder get into the gym and have
[1:31:51] great big muscles he doesn't just
[1:31:53] haphazardly eat anything that he wants
[1:31:56] he has to eat certain foods be on a
[1:31:57] certain diet he goes to the gym and he
[1:32:00] learns what workouts to do how to do the
[1:32:02] workout what motion to perform to work
[1:32:05] on that certain muscle to make sure that
[1:32:07] you're not pulling with another aspect
[1:32:09] of the muscle but you're using that
[1:32:10] muscle because that's the muscle you're
[1:32:12] working and he doesn't notice he goes
[1:32:14] day after day after day after day
[1:32:19] and when he's a far different pitcher
[1:32:21] from when he started to where he is if
[1:32:23] he's been on it day after day after day
[1:32:25] so what i'm telling you is for this man
[1:32:28] to get to that point he knows what
[1:32:29] muscles to to work out to to reach the
[1:32:32] maximum potential and he does this day
[1:32:34] after day after day and if our faith
[1:32:37] muscles are going to increase then guess
[1:32:38] what they got to be exercised
[1:32:41] they have to be exercised you have to go
[1:32:43] to work on those faith muscles but i
[1:32:46] want you to know don't worry there's a
[1:32:47] free gym for every one of you to go to
[1:32:50] it's god's gym of hard knocks trials and
[1:32:53] tribulations
[1:32:54] and it's open 24 7.
[1:32:56] you don't have to pay for it there's no
[1:32:58] special pass he's given it to every one
[1:33:00] of you you want more faith god is going
[1:33:02] to open the door for you he says come on
[1:33:04] in it's 24 7 access here we got all the
[1:33:07] machines you need
[1:33:09] amen
[1:33:12] oh i don't know if i want faith now
[1:33:16] and i when i first got saved which was
[1:33:18] 20-plus years ago you know i i was a
[1:33:20] young cocky young 24 or 20 something
[1:33:23] year old man and thought i had the world
[1:33:25] by the horns and i you know i pray lord
[1:33:28] i need some patience that was the last
[1:33:30] time i ever prayed for patience
[1:33:33] it only took one time god he heard my
[1:33:35] prayer and he said all right oh boy
[1:33:36] we're going to pour this on you
[1:33:38] i realized right then that was the most
[1:33:40] stupidest prayer i think i've ever
[1:33:41] prayed in
[1:33:42] all my life
[1:33:44] but we find
[1:33:46] that for our our faith to increase we
[1:33:48] have to work at it that's where god's
[1:33:51] going to put you in places god's going
[1:33:52] to put you in situations to where that
[1:33:54] he can he can work on now some of you
[1:33:56] young people your faith you're not going
[1:33:57] to go through the trials that your
[1:33:59] parents would go through
[1:34:00] different stages of life different
[1:34:02] muscle development
[1:34:04] god is teaching you guys showing you
[1:34:06] there's things there may be some you
[1:34:07] know some of you young girls you know
[1:34:09] how it is there's drama with girls right
[1:34:11] i got three girls i know all about the
[1:34:12] drama well this one said this when did
[1:34:15] someone didn't talk to me i'm like oh my
[1:34:16] goodness
[1:34:18] john you're lucky you only got one
[1:34:22] man we got one and one of them as a
[1:34:23] drama queen i mean something ain't going
[1:34:25] her way you know it she's her daddy made
[1:34:27] over
[1:34:28] but we find there's different levels of
[1:34:31] faith and we're all on a different level
[1:34:33] but god is here and god doesn't want
[1:34:35] your faith to diminish god wants your
[1:34:37] faith to grow
[1:34:39] and so how do we get faith in luke 18
[1:34:41] and verse 8 it says i tell you thee
[1:34:44] that he will avenge him speedily
[1:34:45] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:34:47] shall he find faith on earth he's
[1:34:50] looking for one thing
[1:34:52] he's looking for somebody that'll
[1:34:53] believe he's looking for a young person
[1:34:55] that'll believe he's looking for a
[1:34:57] middle-aged person that'll believe he's
[1:34:59] looking for an older person no matter
[1:35:01] how long you've been in a way you still
[1:35:03] believe
[1:35:04] amen
[1:35:06] well brother joe why do i need faith
[1:35:09] why do i need what is so what's the big
[1:35:11] deal about faith
[1:35:13] because with faith all things are
[1:35:15] possible
[1:35:16] without faith nothing is possible
[1:35:19] amen with faith all things are possible
[1:35:22] so god is looking for faith he's looking
[1:35:24] for those that have it he doesn't want
[1:35:26] your faith to diminish he doesn't want
[1:35:27] to wither up he wants you to believe him
[1:35:29] he wants you to trust him he wants you
[1:35:31] to obey him he wants you to have
[1:35:32] confidence in him and he wants you to
[1:35:34] have confidence in his word and he wants
[1:35:36] you to have confidence in the direction
[1:35:38] that he has for your life
[1:35:39] a lot of times we find ourselves we're
[1:35:41] human right we have our own mind
[1:35:44] and we have our own will but we learn as
[1:35:45] we give our will over to his will then
[1:35:47] his will can be performed in our life
[1:35:49] and the greatest struggle even the
[1:35:50] struggle in gethsemane was god's will or
[1:35:53] jesus's will against the father
[1:35:55] nevertheless not my will be done but
[1:35:58] your will be done he had to surrender
[1:36:00] his will
[1:36:01] to give it over to the father so that it
[1:36:03] could accomplish that which it was
[1:36:04] purpose
[1:36:06] and so god is wanting he's looking for
[1:36:07] somebody today that will have confidence
[1:36:09] that wherever he leads you you're
[1:36:11] willing to follow
[1:36:13] can i just share something with you
[1:36:14] that's personal as i was sharing with
[1:36:16] brother john switzer blanca earlier i
[1:36:18] just left the hospital after 24 years
[1:36:21] i've been there i worked my way up from
[1:36:22] staff accountant to a controller from
[1:36:24] controller to the cfo and my aspirations
[1:36:26] and my vision or my dreams when i was
[1:36:28] going to be the ceo of this hospital i
[1:36:30] was going to work my way all the way
[1:36:31] through it you know it never had been
[1:36:33] done before at least at that hospital
[1:36:35] and i was there i was on the cutting
[1:36:37] edge i was second in command and we find
[1:36:39] that things got rough
[1:36:42] and i've been praying for some years
[1:36:43] probably four or five years
[1:36:45] to whether to go full time in the
[1:36:46] ministry or not and just never got that
[1:36:48] open door never got that open door but
[1:36:50] you just got to keep knocking you don't
[1:36:52] give up because god has a timing for
[1:36:54] everything remember 25 cents
[1:36:57] i sat there until the door opened
[1:37:00] and so i've been praying and been
[1:37:01] praying and been praying and and i had
[1:37:03] another opportunity to go to another
[1:37:05] hospital company because things at the
[1:37:06] hospital just went where they need to be
[1:37:08] and i don't have to go into all the
[1:37:09] details with that but because they
[1:37:10] wasn't where they needed to be i began
[1:37:12] to
[1:37:13] entertain other offers and had a two
[1:37:15] very lucrative offers on the table went
[1:37:18] to the pastor and said look this is what
[1:37:19] we got it's not ideal but it'll work for
[1:37:22] the short term he's absolutely not
[1:37:24] absolutely not
[1:37:26] and so at that point brother tim our
[1:37:28] pastor
[1:37:29] asked me to come full time in the
[1:37:30] ministry
[1:37:32] i'm like wow i didn't expect that you
[1:37:34] know i've been knocking on the door for
[1:37:36] four or five years
[1:37:37] but it didn't come my way
[1:37:40] man i thought it was going to be great
[1:37:41] it was going to be a firework show or
[1:37:43] something right man i'm going full time
[1:37:45] but it was in the back office very
[1:37:46] simple very subtle
[1:37:48] but joe we understand you're not happy
[1:37:51] we'd like for you to come on full time
[1:37:52] in the ministry
[1:37:54] praise it pray about it
[1:37:56] and so we talked that was on a wednesday
[1:37:58] and on the thursday we decided we were
[1:38:00] going to do it was going to go in the
[1:38:01] following monday morning which would
[1:38:03] have been march 21st give our
[1:38:05] resignation
[1:38:06] many of you may know brother andrew
[1:38:07] spencer
[1:38:09] brother andrew spencer was at the
[1:38:10] oklahoma camp we were on our way to
[1:38:11] oklahoma camp on that thursday where all
[1:38:13] this came to light we're going to go
[1:38:15] full time we made our decision we're
[1:38:17] going full time in the ministry and i'm
[1:38:18] talking about faith
[1:38:21] okay because faith is the foundation of
[1:38:23] everything we stand for
[1:38:25] okay you got to have faith that god said
[1:38:27] a prophet
[1:38:28] you got to have faith that this mystery
[1:38:30] has been revealed so it all hinges on
[1:38:32] faith and that's why we're focusing
[1:38:33] tonight on faith and so anyway brother
[1:38:36] andrew was preaching to 250 young people
[1:38:39] and at the end of his service he doesn't
[1:38:41] know anything about me about my
[1:38:43] situation about my conversation with
[1:38:45] brother tim on wednesday about our
[1:38:46] conversation again on thursday
[1:38:48] he knows anything about that at the end
[1:38:51] towards the end of the service he points
[1:38:53] back he said god will not waste your
[1:38:54] pain brother joe he said god will be
[1:38:57] your financial advisor god will take
[1:39:00] care of you when man don't want to take
[1:39:01] care of you he goes oh they can't stop
[1:39:03] brother joe they can't stop sister
[1:39:05] jessica he goes don't worry about your
[1:39:07] future
[1:39:08] and i've been worried about my future
[1:39:10] for the next for the previous two days i
[1:39:12] was in a struggle he said don't worry
[1:39:14] about your future it's clear
[1:39:18] oh
[1:39:20] what happened i got 25 cents and the
[1:39:22] door finally opened
[1:39:24] oh i didn't have to worry i didn't have
[1:39:26] to question it any longer i knew right
[1:39:28] then this is what god had ordained us to
[1:39:30] do and let me tell you when you walk
[1:39:32] away from that kind of deal and you
[1:39:34] think people and you're right let me
[1:39:35] just go ahead and tell you my mom i told
[1:39:37] her i said mom i said you know i i um
[1:39:40] i'll resign the hospital today are you
[1:39:42] sick
[1:39:45] well john's to comment i got are you
[1:39:46] sick people think you're out of your
[1:39:48] head you're walking away from this
[1:39:50] prestigious child you're the cfo of the
[1:39:52] hospital you made great money i'm not
[1:39:54] walking away from anything church i'm
[1:39:56] walking towards something we got an
[1:39:58] eternal promise we got a goal out there
[1:40:00] the harvest is plentiful but the
[1:40:02] laborers are few and god is calling sons
[1:40:05] and daughters to get out in the field
[1:40:07] and work into this until he comes and
[1:40:09] that's what we're doing that's why we're
[1:40:10] here tonight so that we can do what read
[1:40:12] songs from the harvest because god is
[1:40:14] calling the people come up higher this
[1:40:17] ain't your earth bound place we're not
[1:40:18] meant to be here god has told us to
[1:40:20] greater things and greater heights and
[1:40:22] deeper depth of the word of god
[1:40:24] [Music]
[1:40:26] but we got to have faith
[1:40:30] now any man in his right mind would have
[1:40:31] said ain't no way i'm taking that pay
[1:40:33] cut
[1:40:34] there's no way that's the most stupidest
[1:40:37] thing i've ever heard
[1:40:39] but i've been longing for it
[1:40:42] it doesn't make sense even until this
[1:40:44] day
[1:40:45] but i can tell you what a month and a
[1:40:47] half in i've not been disappointed
[1:40:49] god has provided and continue to provide
[1:40:52] and continue to provide but we find now
[1:40:55] faith comes by hearing
[1:40:58] now you said i could take my time
[1:40:59] tonight so i'm taking my time if that's
[1:41:01] all right
[1:41:03] romans 10 and verse 17 so then faith
[1:41:06] cometh by him so we find now
[1:41:08] every man has got a measure of faith
[1:41:10] your faith can be increased so how do we
[1:41:13] get that faith we get it by hearing the
[1:41:15] word of god amen faith cometh by hearing
[1:41:18] and hearing by the word of god he
[1:41:20] provided more than twelve hundred
[1:41:23] sermons to increase your faith
[1:41:27] he's provided a five-fold ministry to
[1:41:30] increase your faith
[1:41:34] notice it's imperative that we're
[1:41:36] hearing the right things
[1:41:38] it's imperative that we're feeding on
[1:41:41] the right things
[1:41:43] we don't need to go look up believe the
[1:41:45] sign mess
[1:41:46] that's not our ministry that's not our
[1:41:49] calling our calling is to believe not
[1:41:51] disbelief our calling is to take god in
[1:41:54] his word our call is not to get all
[1:41:56] caught up in what everybody else is
[1:41:57] doing let them men they want a fuss they
[1:41:59] want to throw dirt let them thrust let
[1:42:01] them throw dirt we're here to believe
[1:42:03] because god has sent us a messenger in
[1:42:05] this hour and we're getting our our
[1:42:07] shoulders with that message and we're
[1:42:09] preaching the word we're keeping it pure
[1:42:11] we're not allowing men's ideas to
[1:42:14] intertwine into the message and
[1:42:15] entertain into the ministry no we want
[1:42:17] the pure word of god to be manifested
[1:42:21] and displayed so then and only then can
[1:42:23] they get the results
[1:42:24] [Music]
[1:42:27] many years ago sister blanca was dealing
[1:42:29] with a stomach issue and i preached
[1:42:30] faith
[1:42:32] and god spoke and god dealt with her and
[1:42:34] took care of that stomach issue and i
[1:42:35] believe you've ever had it since
[1:42:38] god gallbladder
[1:42:40] see god still moves amen costume moves
[1:42:43] he responds to faith that's god he
[1:42:46] responds to faith so we've got to be
[1:42:48] feeding on the right thing when you find
[1:42:50] yourself church in a difficult situation
[1:42:52] how many have ever been in a difficult
[1:42:54] situation maybe three or four y'all rest
[1:42:56] y'all cherubs right
[1:42:58] brother gerald you didn't know you got a
[1:42:59] bunch of angels here
[1:43:00] or maybe you didn't know
[1:43:02] you find yourself in a difficult
[1:43:04] situation or in a battle for your health
[1:43:07] the last thing listen to me now the last
[1:43:09] thing that you need to do is surround
[1:43:10] yourself with negative people
[1:43:13] oh my goodness
[1:43:16] here comes so-and-so i'm gonna hear that
[1:43:18] same story over and over and over again
[1:43:23] and you just want to beat your head
[1:43:24] because you're like i done got myself in
[1:43:26] a trap and there ain't no way out
[1:43:29] thank god there's text messaging today
[1:43:31] so you can send a quick text call me and
[1:43:33] get me out of this situation
[1:43:36] now i've never used that yet but i'm hey
[1:43:38] i'm not opposed to it
[1:43:41] but we find negativity breeds doubt
[1:43:45] and negativity breeds unbelief and you
[1:43:48] can never rise up and take a promise of
[1:43:50] god with a negative confession
[1:43:52] see doubt and unbelief will never take
[1:43:55] hold of the promises of god
[1:43:57] never take hold of the promises of god
[1:44:00] they will keep the promises just out of
[1:44:02] your reach we've always heard the story
[1:44:04] about a carrot hanging out there you
[1:44:06] know and that's the way doubts and
[1:44:07] unbelief are you believe in the back of
[1:44:09] your mind but it's just doubt gets out
[1:44:11] there and unbelief is out there and
[1:44:13] you're just chasing after just so close
[1:44:15] you want to believe but it's just a
[1:44:17] carrot
[1:44:17] you never get to partake of it because
[1:44:19] doubt cause unbelief
[1:44:22] see you may have faith for somebody else
[1:44:24] and a lot of us do it's easier to
[1:44:26] believe for somebody else than it is to
[1:44:28] believe when it comes to your home
[1:44:29] oh i believe god can i believe god will
[1:44:32] i believe god can do it for you yes i
[1:44:34] believe that we're going to be praying
[1:44:35] for you however many prayed that prayer
[1:44:37] oh yeah bless god man we go to war we go
[1:44:39] to battle we pray every night for that
[1:44:41] but you let it come to your house
[1:44:43] oh oh god you did it for them but i'm
[1:44:46] not sure if you'll do it for me
[1:44:48] don't allow negativity to come into your
[1:44:50] house
[1:44:51] you need to surround yourself with
[1:44:52] people that'll lift you up you need to
[1:44:53] surround yourself with people that will
[1:44:55] encourage you you need to be around
[1:44:57] those that will be praying for you
[1:45:00] not a two-minute prayer but i'm talking
[1:45:02] about they go to god they go to the
[1:45:03] throne of heaven on your behalf none of
[1:45:06] us when we're in our trials when we're
[1:45:07] in our weak
[1:45:08] moments we don't need frizz like job had
[1:45:12] well you're just a secret sinner if you
[1:45:13] just confess that you'll be all right
[1:45:16] no what we need we need a caleb and we
[1:45:19] need a joshua
[1:45:20] [Music]
[1:45:21] what do you mean we need a caleb and a
[1:45:23] joshua they knew there was giants in the
[1:45:25] land they knew there was wall cities in
[1:45:27] the land but they looked beyond the wall
[1:45:29] city they look beyond the situation and
[1:45:31] they said we're more than able that's
[1:45:33] what i want around me i don't want the
[1:45:35] naysayers the negative nancy i want sons
[1:45:37] and daughters of god that'll get behind
[1:45:39] me and say we're praying for you brother
[1:45:41] joe we're believing for you we know god
[1:45:43] is there we know god is going to move
[1:45:45] don't you worry about it we're praying
[1:45:47] and god is going to answer that prayer
[1:45:49] why because we got 25 cents in our hands
[1:45:52] amen
[1:45:53] but says now your faith is what saves
[1:45:56] you
[1:45:58] romans 10 and verse 14 how then
[1:46:01] shall they call on him who they have not
[1:46:03] believed so going back to how faith is
[1:46:06] received is through hearing of the word
[1:46:08] of god
[1:46:09] how shall they believe in him whom they
[1:46:12] have not heard
[1:46:13] how shall they hear without a preacher
[1:46:16] god has ordained
[1:46:19] a preaching ministry
[1:46:21] to bring forth the word of god
[1:46:24] we find today though that men want to
[1:46:26] reorganize the way god has established
[1:46:29] his program
[1:46:30] who are we to say that we got it figured
[1:46:32] out and god can't figure it out
[1:46:34] god put it in his word a certain way
[1:46:36] we don't need to go manhandling that
[1:46:37] word and changing it up
[1:46:39] trying to dictate and push laws out
[1:46:41] there you got to do it this way or you
[1:46:43] don't have it but you find ministry
[1:46:45] today if you don't get my sermons
[1:46:48] you don't get my sermons you're not
[1:46:50] bribed you're not going to make it
[1:46:51] who are you
[1:46:53] no god has ordained a fifo ministry and
[1:46:56] faith cometh by preaching and how shall
[1:46:59] they hear but what without a preacher be
[1:47:01] sent and we find hereforth the preaching
[1:47:04] of the cross is to them this is in first
[1:47:06] corinthians 1 and verse 18
[1:47:09] for the preaching of the cross is to
[1:47:10] them that perish foolishness but unto us
[1:47:14] which are saved it is the power of god
[1:47:16] amen
[1:47:17] so for it is written i will destroy the
[1:47:19] wisdom otherwise i will bring to nothing
[1:47:21] the understanding of the prudence where
[1:47:24] is the wise where is the scribe where is
[1:47:26] the disputer of this world hath not god
[1:47:29] made a foolish the wisdom of this world
[1:47:31] for after that in the wisdom of god the
[1:47:34] world by wisdom knew not god it pleased
[1:47:36] god by the foolishness of preaching to
[1:47:39] save them that believe
[1:47:42] so your faith is what saves you
[1:47:46] amen
[1:47:47] see we establish
[1:47:50] we accept that faith cometh by hearing
[1:47:52] hearing of the word and it takes a
[1:47:54] preacher
[1:47:56] and so we're not putting all our focus
[1:47:57] and all our confidence in the man
[1:48:00] no because man i fail you and i'm afraid
[1:48:03] that's what many people have done they
[1:48:04] elevated the man to a place where he
[1:48:06] can't fall they put him in a position
[1:48:09] that god never intended man to be put in
[1:48:11] but yet we are to put our faith in the
[1:48:14] word of god we are to put our faith in
[1:48:16] what the man is preaching is he
[1:48:17] preaching the truth if he's preaching
[1:48:19] the truth amen respond to it if he's not
[1:48:22] preaching the truth get away from it
[1:48:24] but we find because man has been
[1:48:26] elevated to a certain plateau a certain
[1:48:28] position that people just believe it no
[1:48:30] matter
[1:48:30] what and they're not able to discern
[1:48:33] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:48:35] the christian church because they
[1:48:36] elevated the man and not the word
[1:48:39] the word should always be elevated over
[1:48:41] the man
[1:48:43] so what good is faith with faith you can
[1:48:46] be healed
[1:48:48] did y'all hear that
[1:48:50] i know y'all got a better amen than that
[1:48:51] in you
[1:48:52] with faith you can be healed
[1:48:55] with faith you can be delivered with
[1:48:58] faith you can be set free with faith you
[1:49:00] can overcome with faith you'll take a
[1:49:03] rapture
[1:49:05] but with unbelief you'll go to hell
[1:49:08] or at best
[1:49:10] you go in the tribulation period right
[1:49:12] so why do you want to settle for
[1:49:13] unbelief when god has given us so much
[1:49:17] so we have seen the supernatural
[1:49:19] manifest over and over and over again
[1:49:23] bible days are here because the living
[1:49:25] god is present among us
[1:49:28] bill brown says now divine healing is
[1:49:30] nothing that anyone can do divine
[1:49:32] healing is an act of faith in the
[1:49:34] finished work and it's your personal
[1:49:36] faith in the finished work of christ at
[1:49:38] calvary that brings both salvation and
[1:49:42] healing
[1:49:43] so it's your personal faith brother john
[1:49:46] as much as i love you and you're a dear
[1:49:47] friend of mine your faith is not going
[1:49:49] to do anything for me it will but it
[1:49:51] won't if you understand what i'm saying
[1:49:53] because my i have to have faith in that
[1:49:56] it's for me that it's personal to me god
[1:49:59] i believe that you know brother man says
[1:50:00] in the message perfect faith god can use
[1:50:02] my faith to heal you i believe that but
[1:50:04] we also have to look at the office by
[1:50:05] which he was ministering from because
[1:50:07] that was a a high office of a high
[1:50:09] priest he was doing things and going
[1:50:10] things and he said i believe god can use
[1:50:12] my faith because he's seen so many
[1:50:14] supernatural things take place and he
[1:50:16] said i believe god can use my faith to
[1:50:18] elevate your faith to a point to receive
[1:50:21] the healing and i believe god uses men
[1:50:23] today like jewel foreign and different
[1:50:25] ones who have seen the supernatural who
[1:50:27] are are bulldogs of faith and they go
[1:50:29] out there and they they hold on to it
[1:50:31] and they they refuse to let go of it and
[1:50:33] what do you find you find god responds
[1:50:35] you find there they stay at that door
[1:50:38] because they had the 25 cents the
[1:50:40] purchase power of the hand and they stay
[1:50:42] there until they're able to get into it
[1:50:43] and when they get into it they begin to
[1:50:45] feast on the word
[1:50:47] they begin to feast on the promises of
[1:50:49] god this is what i've been waiting for
[1:50:51] the door the promise to come open and
[1:50:53] i'm going in with my faith i'm going in
[1:50:55] with the purchase power and god will not
[1:50:57] withhold any good thing to them that
[1:50:59] walk upright
[1:51:02] so it's your personal faith in the
[1:51:04] finished work of calvary that brings
[1:51:06] both salvation and healing
[1:51:09] he goes now
[1:51:12] he says then your personal faith this is
[1:51:16] then can we see jesus
[1:51:17] in that finished work draws
[1:51:20] the remuneration from what he did for
[1:51:23] you at calvary
[1:51:24] your personal faith
[1:51:26] so
[1:51:28] so you were saved 2 000 years ago but
[1:51:30] you accepted your salvation
[1:51:32] 25 years ago five hours ago five minutes
[1:51:36] ago see you were healed two thousand
[1:51:38] years ago you can accept it right now
[1:51:42] i mean it's based on your faith and we
[1:51:44] find here we're still working with faith
[1:51:46] ephesians 2 and verse say if your turn
[1:51:48] there
[1:51:58] i never started my time or so y'all got
[1:52:00] all that for free
[1:52:02] that was all free we just started we got
[1:52:04] a little over an hour to go
[1:52:08] the bible says here in ephesians 2 and
[1:52:09] verse 8 for by grace
[1:52:11] are you saved through faith
[1:52:14] and that not of yourselves
[1:52:16] but it is a gift to god not a works lest
[1:52:19] any man should boast so it's by grace
[1:52:22] that we are saved but it's through faith
[1:52:25] and notice
[1:52:27] god doesn't need your works oh i did so
[1:52:30] and so and i did so and so and i did so
[1:52:31] and so and he said to those well we did
[1:52:33] this and we did this and we did this he
[1:52:35] goes depart from me i never knew you
[1:52:38] see because they did it all with the
[1:52:39] wrong motive they did it all based on
[1:52:41] works trying to work their self up work
[1:52:43] their faith up but yet he says here for
[1:52:46] by grace are you saved and it's through
[1:52:48] faith not of yourself it's a gift of god
[1:52:51] so not only do we have faith not only
[1:52:53] can our faith increase not only do we
[1:52:56] understand that it comes through the
[1:52:57] preaching of the word but not only that
[1:52:58] but it's a gift of god god has given
[1:53:01] every one of us that free gift of faith
[1:53:04] so even the atheist tonight has faith
[1:53:08] but it's what you do with that faith
[1:53:10] that brings the results or not
[1:53:12] it's how you point that faith do you
[1:53:14] direct that faith toward the word toward
[1:53:16] the promise of god or do you direct that
[1:53:17] faith toward the world and all your
[1:53:19] ambition and all your driving all your
[1:53:21] desires are going toward the world you
[1:53:23] can be successful
[1:53:25] but you're turning away from eternal
[1:53:26] life
[1:53:27] but see it's your faith you believe i
[1:53:29] can reach this
[1:53:31] see it's misguided faith misappropriated
[1:53:34] faith but yet every one of us has it's a
[1:53:36] gift from god so with faith nothing is
[1:53:40] impossible no situation is impossible if
[1:53:43] you got faith no sickness is impossible
[1:53:45] tonight if you got faith no trial is
[1:53:48] impossible tonight if you got faith no
[1:53:50] loss of a loved one will will condemn
[1:53:53] your will would distract you if you've
[1:53:55] got faith no complex tonight will defeat
[1:53:59] you if you have
[1:54:01] faith
[1:54:03] the brother man will tell us at that
[1:54:04] word
[1:54:05] he says now only by your confession can
[1:54:07] you be saved
[1:54:10] so only by your confession that's the
[1:54:12] most powerful weapon that god put in the
[1:54:14] hand of a man is committal and a
[1:54:17] confession
[1:54:19] oh my lord
[1:54:21] brother joe i'm just a young person man
[1:54:22] but if you commit your life to god and
[1:54:25] you make your confession on a daily
[1:54:26] basis i'm a child of god god done
[1:54:28] something for me in that service or god
[1:54:30] something's done for me at camp god done
[1:54:32] something god done something he said the
[1:54:33] most powerful weapon that god put in the
[1:54:36] hand of a man
[1:54:38] is committal in a confession he goes
[1:54:41] it'll do it every time if you'll believe
[1:54:44] it accept it on those bases and believe
[1:54:46] it and stay with it keep confessing it
[1:54:48] and he goes look because you know when a
[1:54:51] lot of people look at symptoms they
[1:54:53] always look around well i don't feel any
[1:54:55] better how many ever heard people say
[1:54:56] that
[1:54:57] i hope it ain't nobody in this church
[1:54:59] because you're a small church
[1:55:02] but you know you remember i'm just going
[1:55:03] to back off with that one
[1:55:05] so what you find people they always
[1:55:06] looking at symptoms he says well i don't
[1:55:08] feel any better that doesn't have one
[1:55:10] thing to do with it it's what you
[1:55:13] believe not how you feel
[1:55:17] oh my we could get the christian church
[1:55:19] if we could get the bride of christ to
[1:55:21] get their minds off of how they feel and
[1:55:23] what they're seeing and all the
[1:55:25] difficulties around them and realize
[1:55:27] you're in the gym called faith and god
[1:55:29] has got you there and he's exercising
[1:55:30] those faith both it's not how you feel
[1:55:32] it's not what you're looking at it's
[1:55:34] what you believe tonight and if you
[1:55:36] believe this is the word of god god will
[1:55:38] back it up every time
[1:55:40] god will not let you hold on to this
[1:55:42] word and get you at the following and
[1:55:44] you'd be disappointed he never provide
[1:55:46] no god will answer god will respond
[1:55:48] because god will reward those that
[1:55:50] diligently seek after him
[1:55:53] that's the word of god that's the
[1:55:54] promise of god god has to obey his own
[1:55:57] word or he has to to adhere to his own
[1:56:00] word
[1:56:01] he says now we're talking about a
[1:56:03] negative conversation or a negative
[1:56:04] attitude or a negative uh confession he
[1:56:06] says now all of you here that's saved
[1:56:08] tonight won't you just raise your hand
[1:56:10] up
[1:56:12] hold on i don't have the whole church
[1:56:14] we're gonna have to have a prayer line
[1:56:16] right now
[1:56:18] he says all of you in here that are
[1:56:19] saved tonight just get in your head if
[1:56:20] you just got in your head that you're
[1:56:22] not saved and you go around saying well
[1:56:24] i'm not saying no more
[1:56:26] he goes you're not saved
[1:56:29] do you see how simple that was you get
[1:56:32] in your head the devil get in your head
[1:56:33] said you're not saying and you go
[1:56:35] confess and i'm not saved anymore he
[1:56:36] says you're not saved
[1:56:39] he says you're backslid whenever you do
[1:56:41] that
[1:56:42] see you've got to have your testimony
[1:56:45] and your confession positive
[1:56:47] not according to my feelings but
[1:56:49] according to what he said that's it
[1:56:53] he said there's not a christian in here
[1:56:55] no matter how solid you are in faith if
[1:56:58] right now that you something happened to
[1:57:00] get a hold of you and tell you that
[1:57:02] you're not a christian and you start out
[1:57:04] testifying well i'm not a christian no
[1:57:06] more he goes you dropped right
[1:57:09] you're no more a christian anymore as
[1:57:11] soon as you testify that you're not a
[1:57:13] christian then you drop from grace right
[1:57:15] then you've fallen because why your own
[1:57:17] speech tells what you are
[1:57:21] your own speech tells what you are now i
[1:57:24] understand many of us we're human right
[1:57:27] we're not the super human christians
[1:57:29] that we read about in in hebrews 11. but
[1:57:31] over human in earth's times the devil
[1:57:33] comes and whispers into your ear
[1:57:35] you ain't got it
[1:57:36] you're this and that and if you're not
[1:57:38] careful we start giving credence to the
[1:57:40] lies
[1:57:41] but as long as your confession is i'm
[1:57:43] saved i'm healed i'm filled with the
[1:57:46] holy ghost satan is defeated
[1:57:49] but as soon as you confess that you're
[1:57:51] no longer saved you're not saved as soon
[1:57:54] as you confess that you're not healed
[1:57:55] you're not healed you walk away from it
[1:57:57] you lose your healing there's a little
[1:57:59] kid or people that will come up on a
[1:58:01] platform in a prayer line they'd come up
[1:58:02] and god would miraculously heal them and
[1:58:04] before they walked off they were back in
[1:58:06] the same position they were before they
[1:58:07] walked up
[1:58:09] it wasn't anything to do with the
[1:58:10] prophet wasn't anything to do with god
[1:58:12] it wasn't anything to do with the word
[1:58:13] it was their lack of faith to hold on to
[1:58:15] it he said your faith can save you
[1:58:18] because it'll hold you right now it can
[1:58:20] hold you for the next five minutes it
[1:58:21] can hold you for the next five years it
[1:58:23] can hold you into eternity it's based on
[1:58:25] your faith
[1:58:27] amen he says now when you confess that
[1:58:30] the holy ghost is it for you you'll
[1:58:31] never receive the holy ghost
[1:58:35] but notice it doesn't have to be with
[1:58:37] your lips
[1:58:38] it can be with your body language
[1:58:41] you come in
[1:58:42] preach me happy preacher
[1:58:45] well get ready you ain't getting nothing
[1:58:48] you got to start putting in
[1:58:51] putting in
[1:58:53] putting in
[1:58:54] believing
[1:58:55] you know i learned a lesson because we
[1:58:57] done a lot of leadership training they
[1:58:59] said you never fold your arms in a
[1:59:01] meeting
[1:59:02] because when you fold your arms you know
[1:59:03] what this is a sign of
[1:59:05] you can't reach me
[1:59:07] i'm not listening brother mark to
[1:59:09] anything you're saying i got my heart
[1:59:11] folded so they teach you to stand with
[1:59:14] your hands like this
[1:59:15] open
[1:59:16] because your posture your body language
[1:59:18] in church says a lot about what you're
[1:59:20] getting out of church
[1:59:21] you can come and you can
[1:59:24] or you can
[1:59:27] you know you do all kind of things satan
[1:59:29] is there he's in every sin he's more
[1:59:31] faithful than many of us christians
[1:59:33] so but we can deny the word and we can
[1:59:35] deny our faith by not just our lips but
[1:59:37] with our body language
[1:59:40] i'm not saying you need to all be
[1:59:41] jumping around like a bunch of jumping
[1:59:42] beans
[1:59:45] but have a
[1:59:46] have a a stance a position of worship
[1:59:49] however that is some of you may never
[1:59:52] jump but it may be just man your intent
[1:59:54] you're plugged in you're right there
[1:59:55] your eyes are locked in your focus i've
[1:59:57] been to churches where there's you can
[1:59:59] hardly squeak and amen but when you call
[2:00:01] for something at the end of the service
[2:00:02] the entire church lines up
[2:00:04] but see because it's a different type of
[2:00:06] people different type of atmosphere but
[2:00:08] they're locked in they're believing
[2:00:10] they're receiving so you want to
[2:00:12] maintain a positive confession so that
[2:00:14] the word can work in your life it can
[2:00:17] work in your home it can work in your
[2:00:19] marriage it can work in your children
[2:00:23] when you're facing a situation you need
[2:00:24] to speak the word over that situation
[2:00:27] don't speak the devil's lie with that
[2:00:29] situation speak the word of promise be
[2:00:31] positive have a positive confession
[2:00:34] he says now
[2:00:35] many people or some people he says you
[2:00:37] know he
[2:00:38] some people would say healing is not
[2:00:40] brother says now healing is not
[2:00:41] something you say well you know i
[2:00:43] believe it
[2:00:44] you know you're trying to get somebody
[2:00:45] well i just i think i can believe it
[2:00:47] that's all right you know he says now if
[2:00:49] that's the best you can do just mentally
[2:00:51] now notice that here's a prophet of god
[2:00:52] telling you how to work it from a mental
[2:00:54] standpoint to get it to where you
[2:00:56] believe
[2:00:57] are y'all with me that's okay tonight
[2:00:59] i'm not much of a teacher but i'm doing
[2:01:00] everything i can to get you there
[2:01:03] he says now if it's just well you know
[2:01:05] you you some see some people they're
[2:01:07] kind of half past well you know i
[2:01:09] believe that i can believe that he said
[2:01:10] but if it's all just mental he goes you
[2:01:13] say it you gotta believe it you gotta
[2:01:15] accept it then if you accept it on those
[2:01:17] bases just well yeah i can believe it he
[2:01:19] says say it over and over
[2:01:22] say it out loud
[2:01:25] say it over and over just keep saying it
[2:01:28] i'm healed i'm healed and maybe you
[2:01:30] don't really believe it yet but you just
[2:01:32] keep saying i'm healed i'm healed say it
[2:01:34] until you actually believe it and when
[2:01:36] you believe it then it's going to take
[2:01:39] place
[2:01:41] you're not lying that you don't believe
[2:01:42] it no you're saying it over and over
[2:01:44] because sometimes some of us are at a
[2:01:46] very low level of faith and we're trying
[2:01:48] to elevate our faith up there to a
[2:01:50] higher place and brother said if it's
[2:01:52] only mental he says just say it over and
[2:01:55] over say it over and over say i'm healed
[2:01:58] say i'm delivered say i got the holy
[2:01:59] oath say it over and over until you
[2:02:01] finally believe it and then when you
[2:02:03] finally believe it then it takes place
[2:02:05] then healing is your portion then
[2:02:07] deliverance is coming to your home then
[2:02:09] you receive the holy ghost because why
[2:02:10] he went from mental to faith
[2:02:13] and god will honor faith every
[2:02:16] time so it's okay sometimes we struggle
[2:02:19] because the battle is the mind that's
[2:02:22] the battleground and the problem of god
[2:02:23] said satan chose the mind god chose the
[2:02:26] heart so that's sometimes that's why we
[2:02:28] got to say it over and over and over to
[2:02:31] get it into our mind i believe it i
[2:02:33] believe it i believe it but when it
[2:02:35] finally drops down into the heart oh
[2:02:36] glory to god when it drops down into the
[2:02:39] heart ain't no devil hell can stand
[2:02:41] against it it's no longer a mental
[2:02:43] concession it's a reality of a living
[2:02:45] god
[2:02:46] say it over till you believe it say it
[2:02:48] over till it drops down in your heart
[2:02:50] when it anchors in there ain't no devil
[2:02:51] health can come in there
[2:02:53] oh glory to god
[2:02:56] you find people come up for prayer well
[2:02:57] i just i need the assurance say it over
[2:03:02] and over till you believe it
[2:03:04] you know it's okay to have the ministry
[2:03:06] pray for you it's okay to have the
[2:03:07] preachers pray for you but the preachers
[2:03:09] didn't make the promise
[2:03:12] god made the promise say it over say it
[2:03:16] over say it over until you finally
[2:03:18] believe it until you finally believe it
[2:03:20] i'm not opposed to praying for you i'm
[2:03:22] not approached opposed to laying hands
[2:03:24] on you but you got to believe the
[2:03:26] promise it's got to be your promise it's
[2:03:28] got to be you and god had come into an
[2:03:30] intimate relationship and he's become

[2:03:50] and over notice he's telling you say it

[2:09:00] don't let this be just another servant
[2:09:02] don't let this be just another meeting
[2:09:04] let this be a state driving meeting
[2:09:09] this term here drive a stake originated
[2:09:12] in the native americas the native
[2:09:14] american term
[2:09:16] says when they were under attack and it
[2:09:18] looked like they were going to be
[2:09:19] defeated
[2:09:20] they would drive a stake in the ground
[2:09:22] and actually tie the person by their leg
[2:09:25] to that stake and they would have to
[2:09:27] stand there and defend that piece of
[2:09:30] ground to the death
[2:09:34] tie their leg to that stake
[2:09:37] what were they saying
[2:09:39] we're willing to die
[2:09:40] on this piece of ground
[2:09:42] we're willing to die right here tonight
[2:09:44] on this piece of ground and i said the
[2:09:46] prophet of god said someone you need to
[2:09:47] drive your stake down this afternoon
[2:09:49] what is he saying some of you need to
[2:09:51] say i'm tying myself no matter what i do
[2:09:53] no matter what i'm willing to die right
[2:09:55] here on this promise of god god you
[2:09:57] promise that you're my healer i'm
[2:09:59] driving that stake down tonight i'm not
[2:10:01] backing up or i may make advancement but
[2:10:03] i'm not going beyond this state i'm
[2:10:05] driving a stake down and if i make
[2:10:07] advancements god i'm going to drive
[2:10:09] another stake down and another stake
[2:10:11] down and another statement what are you
[2:10:12] telling you're telling that devil this
[2:10:14] is as far as you can come i'm not
[2:10:16] backing up i'm not gonna bid i'm not
[2:10:18] gonna break i'm driving my state down
[2:10:20] tonight i'm a son of god
[2:10:24] i'm driving that state tonight that's
[2:10:26] who i am and i'm willing to defend it
[2:10:28] with everything within me
[2:10:30] let me tell you when all hell turns
[2:10:32] loose on you all heavens turn loose also
[2:10:35] oh you had a prophet of god tell you
[2:10:37] that
[2:10:38] he caught the inspiration he says when
[2:10:40] all hell turns loose and it looks like
[2:10:42] you're going to die all heavens turn
[2:10:44] loose also
[2:10:47] drive your steak down tonight
[2:10:50] oh think about this
[2:10:52] if we as the bride
[2:10:54] will put as much attention
[2:10:56] on the promises of god
[2:10:58] as we do on the doubts and lives of the
[2:11:00] enemy where would we be
[2:11:05] where would we be if we would put as
[2:11:07] much focus
[2:11:08] on the word of god
[2:11:10] on the promises of god
[2:11:13] where would we be it's time to drive a
[2:11:15] stake
[2:11:17] see this is not a time to quit this is
[2:11:19] not a time to give up
[2:11:21] this is time for god's people to make a
[2:11:23] stand
[2:11:24] i'm going to serve god
[2:11:26] i don't care what it costs me
[2:11:28] you know that word is a military term at
[2:11:31] all costs
[2:11:32] at all costs that means you're willing
[2:11:35] to die
[2:11:36] in world war ii some of them generals
[2:11:38] they got them they got a message you
[2:11:40] defend this bridge and all costs they
[2:11:43] knew that it meant they were willing to
[2:11:45] give their life
[2:11:47] to make sure
[2:11:48] and it was better to go down and defeat
[2:11:51] than it was to be held captive by the
[2:11:52] enemy
[2:11:54] i'm telling you church it's better to go
[2:11:56] down and defeat trusting god than it is
[2:11:58] to be a captain and a slave to the enemy
[2:12:01] this saint whatever will be will be this
[2:12:02] is the time that we drive our stakes in
[2:12:04] the ground and occupy until jesus comes

[2:12:48] faith
[2:12:49] faith that you've gifted to me as a son
[2:12:51] of god and i'm going to occupy till you
[2:12:53] come
[2:12:54] you know many times
[2:12:56] i'm going to tell you
[2:12:57] he would tell us you know a lot of times
[2:12:59] we go based on feelings don't we because
[2:13:00] we're human i got a couple real
[2:13:02] christians in here tonight they're
[2:13:03] bowing their heads they're agreeing
[2:13:06] some of you just like no no no please
[2:13:07] don't don't go there don't go there
[2:13:10] but a lot of times you know we face
[2:13:11] things
[2:13:12] a lot of times
[2:13:14] it's always with this this is your worst
[2:13:16] enemy now look at your neighbor
[2:13:19] there's some says maureen look look at
[2:13:21] your husband now he's not sure oh my
[2:13:24] she's still attractive after all these
[2:13:25] years
[2:13:27] got a brother mark you the man
[2:13:30] but there's times the devil would try to
[2:13:31] put
[2:13:32] put you at odds with each other but
[2:13:34] that's not your worst enemy
[2:13:36] your parents who look at your kids
[2:13:38] that's not your worst enemy
[2:13:40] you are your own worst enemy this flesh
[2:13:44] is your worst enemy
[2:13:46] this flesh and i know some of you you
[2:13:49] love your flesh
[2:13:50] look at you you've had a nice
[2:13:52] six seven hundred dollar suit on your
[2:13:54] flesh
[2:13:55] okay maybe not
[2:13:57] okay we went to ross and got our suits i
[2:13:59] got ross's here y'all probably got
[2:14:00] something crazy it's canada right
[2:14:02] some kind of supermarket store
[2:14:05] but what you know brother bam talked
[2:14:06] about we got this 500 mink coat on 84
[2:14:09] cents
[2:14:10] because we think so much about this
[2:14:12] flesh
[2:14:14] but brother baby says now satan can whip
[2:14:16] me around the stump anywhere he can
[2:14:19] and you too own your feelings
[2:14:22] but this flesh
[2:14:23] i don't feel like
[2:14:25] they said something it hurt my feelings
[2:14:28] i mean come on really
[2:14:30] well you big child
[2:14:31] you big baby how many have ever had your
[2:14:33] feeling don't put your hand up
[2:14:35] [Music]
[2:14:36] you just throw it in your mind we don't
[2:14:38] want brother gerald to get offended like
[2:14:40] because y'all got hurt because he said
[2:14:41] something you like i didn't agree with
[2:14:42] that because that's what happens when
[2:14:44] you come to church
[2:14:46] there's something's going to be said not
[2:14:48] intentionally but there's times we get
[2:14:50] hurt
[2:14:51] because satan is going to use that as an
[2:14:53] avenue
[2:14:54] to beat you around the stump on your
[2:14:56] feelings
[2:14:59] and the best thing or is one of his
[2:15:01] greatest weapons is to take a brother
[2:15:03] take a sister take some church member
[2:15:05] because you expect it from somebody in
[2:15:06] the world they come up you get to try to
[2:15:08] order a cup of coffee and the lady
[2:15:09] almost throws it at you
[2:15:11] and they're like well she's having a bad
[2:15:12] day but you let a brother do that to
[2:15:14] your sister dude i tell you i ain't
[2:15:16] talking to him no more you'd be like
[2:15:17] sliding the door walking out
[2:15:20] but we find satan will use different
[2:15:22] people different aspects of a service
[2:15:25] and it begins to work on your flesh it
[2:15:27] begins to work on your feelings and the
[2:15:30] prophet of god will say he will beat you
[2:15:31] around the stump on your feelings that's
[2:15:34] right he goes but when i walk back and
[2:15:36] say thus saith the lord my faith is
[2:15:39] built on the word of god he can't whip
[2:15:42] that
[2:15:44] see that's why we tie on ourselves to
[2:15:46] the word
[2:15:47] you don't tie your faith to a man as
[2:15:50] much as i'm loved by my wife and by my
[2:15:52] children if i make a mistake and i fall
[2:15:55] away i don't want them to to to keep
[2:15:58] propping me up i want them to go on with
[2:15:59] the word of god
[2:16:02] i don't believe that'll happen but what
[2:16:03] i'm saying i'm trying to draw the
[2:16:04] parallel we don't elevate to man
[2:16:07] man i fail you man i hurt you not
[2:16:09] intentionally some may be but others
[2:16:11] don't but satan to use these moments and
[2:16:13] use these things to come against you and
[2:16:15] defeat you and to use it against you and
[2:16:17] we find the prophet of god will say
[2:16:19] theories don't change god's word no sir
[2:16:21] god's word is eternally true it's right
[2:16:24] our faith is based on there i'm saved
[2:16:27] because the word of god tells me i'm
[2:16:28] saved satan can whip me around anywhere
[2:16:31] on how you feel
[2:16:32] but i believe it because god says so
[2:16:34] when i accept him upon the basis of his
[2:16:36] word that's how i'm saved i believed it
[2:16:39] i confessed it and then it works the
[2:16:41] results but the first thing i'm saved
[2:16:43] because god's word teaches i'm saved
[2:16:46] that's how you're saved if you're saved
[2:16:47] he says satan can whip you on your ideas
[2:16:50] and things but he can't go around the
[2:16:52] word of god jesus said it is written and
[2:16:54] that settled it with all it's written in
[2:16:57] the scriptures that's why you got to
[2:16:59] point the devil back to the word it is
[2:17:01] written satan
[2:17:03] amen
[2:17:04] he says i'm not saved tonight because i
[2:17:06] shout
[2:17:07] and some of you probably said hey man
[2:17:09] praise god i don't shout
[2:17:11] i'm not saved tonight because because i
[2:17:14] felt a chill yeah i praise god we ain't
[2:17:17] feeling no chill
[2:17:19] no i met god's conditions in the bible
[2:17:23] that's why we're safe that's how we're
[2:17:24] saying he that heareth my word and
[2:17:26] believeth on him that sent me he has
[2:17:29] everlasting life and he shall not come
[2:17:31] into condemnation but he's passed from
[2:17:33] death unto life i believe that that's
[2:17:35] right and on them conditions i am saved
[2:17:39] because god said so amen
[2:17:43] so the same faith listen now the same
[2:17:45] faith that saves you is the same faith
[2:17:47] that heals you
[2:17:49] it's the same faith that delivers you
[2:17:51] it's the same faith that keeps you
[2:17:54] it's the same faith that's going to
[2:17:56] change your bodies
[2:17:58] see there's not one faith for salvation
[2:18:01] there's not another for healing there's
[2:18:03] not another for deliverance it's all one
[2:18:06] faith
[2:18:08] one faith one god one baptism
[2:18:12] one faith
[2:18:13] all you need is one faith
[2:18:15] and i love how the prophet of god and
[2:18:17] i'm gonna start bringing this down is
[2:18:18] this okay
[2:18:19] i don't know how long who i've been
[2:18:20] going a minute in 38
[2:18:23] wow
[2:18:24] i didn't set that time real so we get to
[2:18:26] start all over again
[2:18:29] he says now they asked brother bannon
[2:18:31] what about miracles is it some different
[2:18:33] type of faith he said no it's the same
[2:18:35] faith
[2:18:36] there's only one faith in all good
[2:18:38] things and all things that are are
[2:18:40] original so there's only even for
[2:18:42] miracles
[2:18:44] see there's only one faith it's just
[2:18:46] how much do you believe
[2:18:48] see is is your faith increased because
[2:18:51] he's given everybody faith it's just how
[2:18:54] muscular if you want to call it that is
[2:18:56] your faith tonight now some of us
[2:18:59] we have
[2:19:01] we have smaller muscles i'm trying to
[2:19:03] make sure i say this correctly some of
[2:19:06] us
[2:19:07] like brother john back there he's got
[2:19:08] these big massive arms with a big bang
[2:19:10] running through the middle of it i'm
[2:19:12] working out with them damn like oh my
[2:19:14] goodness
[2:19:15] boy got some big arms
[2:19:17] please you know it's exercising
[2:19:20] you don't understand how much time he's
[2:19:22] put in how much effort has gone into it
[2:19:24] and a lot of times you see ministers and
[2:19:26] everybody this is oh my look at that man
[2:19:28] if i could just preach like that if i
[2:19:30] could just be like that but you don't
[2:19:32] understand all that they've gone through
[2:19:34] to get to that point
[2:19:36] think about my pastor he's maybe five
[2:19:38] foot five
[2:19:39] crippled in his feet different things
[2:19:42] and yet when he was a kid he missed out
[2:19:44] on being a kid he didn't go play sports
[2:19:45] he didn't play games he didn't have a
[2:19:47] social life with other kids because he
[2:19:49] was crippled he had a defect but what he
[2:19:51] did do he poured himself into the word
[2:19:53] of god
[2:19:55] and now you see
[2:19:57] all the pain that went through all these
[2:19:59] years being poured out into the ministry
[2:20:01] and ministers around the world and
[2:20:03] believers around the world can hear
[2:20:05] somebody preach the gospel with so much
[2:20:07] clarity but we don't elevate them up but
[2:20:09] what i'm saying is
[2:20:11] satan
[2:20:12] satan will try to use different aspects
[2:20:15] but it's one faith
[2:20:17] one lord one baptism
[2:20:20] church we have one god and we're going
[2:20:22] to point that enemy back to this word
[2:20:24] he says now
[2:20:27] see
[2:20:28] faith is common
[2:20:31] it's like they had in the old testament
[2:20:33] when they were preparing for an exodus
[2:20:35] he said it's like hyssop history was
[2:20:37] always used to sprinkle the blood
[2:20:39] because in the days of the passover
[2:20:40] moses commanded to take to his and dip
[2:20:43] it in blood and splash upon my doorpost
[2:20:45] on the lentils and applying of the blood
[2:20:47] see his it was a common weed and it
[2:20:50] represents common faith the believer
[2:20:53] coming must not be some supernatural
[2:20:56] praise god tonight he doesn't have to be
[2:20:58] some supernatural i don't know some kind
[2:21:00] of fellow that's got highly educated to
[2:21:03] he knows more than webster does
[2:21:06] okay
[2:21:07] he doesn't have to be any great
[2:21:09] theologian he just has to use common
[2:21:11] faith
[2:21:12] the hyssop and he says pick it up
[2:21:14] anywhere
[2:21:16] so young sister all you need is that
[2:21:18] kind of faith
[2:21:19] you don't have to have the faith of
[2:21:20] brother tim brother gerald
[2:21:22] brother john brother joe or whoever your
[2:21:25] favorite preacher is you just got to
[2:21:26] have your own common faith
[2:21:30] your own common faith will do as much
[2:21:32] for you is the super faith of some of
[2:21:34] these other men
[2:21:36] because when you realize the super faith
[2:21:37] there's greater battles
[2:21:39] the common faith will get you through
[2:21:41] that battle that you're in
[2:21:42] he goes listen now he says now he goes
[2:21:45] you think you have to have some
[2:21:46] supernatural faith to get something from
[2:21:48] god you do not
[2:21:50] just common faith like you got he said
[2:21:53] just apply the blood
[2:21:55] that's it
[2:21:57] you don't have to have some supernatural
[2:21:58] faith you don't have to have some
[2:22:00] super-duper faith you just got to use
[2:22:02] common faith he said the night of the
[2:22:04] passover they took the hyssops sprinkled
[2:22:06] the door in the little post and in the
[2:22:07] blood and sprinkle with the blood by the
[2:22:09] his sprinkle child like faith he goes
[2:22:12] you don't have to have any super faith
[2:22:14] how'd you come here tonight
[2:22:18] that's a question to y'all
[2:22:20] how'd y'all get here car
[2:22:22] side-by-side suv truck
[2:22:25] a horse
[2:22:26] i want y'all drive up here in canada i
[2:22:28] don't know but he goes how'd you get
[2:22:30] here tonight
[2:22:31] he goes
[2:22:32] how can you drive your car let me tell
[2:22:34] you how you drove your car you got out
[2:22:36] you got dressed you went out to your car
[2:22:38] you put the key in the ignition if you
[2:22:40] got that kind of car or you pushed a
[2:22:42] little button if you got that kind of
[2:22:43] car and what you do you wasn't sweating
[2:22:45] it out thinking oh praise god i hope
[2:22:46] this car starts hope this car said no
[2:22:48] you got it you didn't think anything
[2:22:49] about it it was just subconscious to you
[2:22:52] when you got in the car you put the key
[2:22:54] in or push the button it started up
[2:22:56] first thing it is put it in reverse if
[2:22:57] you're going backwards put it in drive
[2:22:59] if you're going forwards and what you
[2:23:00] started driving down the road and you
[2:23:02] arrived right here what not supernatural
[2:23:04] about that at all he says that's the
[2:23:06] same way faith works it's just common
[2:23:10] not some super-duper faith he goes
[2:23:12] that's the way you believe for your
[2:23:13] healing it's settled right there the
[2:23:15] same faith that got you in your car and
[2:23:17] brought you to church tonight it's the
[2:23:19] same faith that brings your healing it's
[2:23:21] the same faith that brings your
[2:23:22] deliverance it's the same faith that
[2:23:24] fills you with the holy ghost it's the
[2:23:25] very same faith tonight
[2:23:29] see it's just settled that's all it
[2:23:31] doesn't take some high education
[2:23:35] thank god because i'm not that smart
[2:23:38] you don't have to amend that
[2:23:40] that was just for me my wife us
[2:23:43] i heard some of y'all hey man you don't
[2:23:45] know me
[2:23:47] he goes just
[2:23:51] he says you don't have to have some high
[2:23:53] education and the house of god says hey
[2:23:55] man
[2:23:57] some super duper something thank god
[2:24:00] y'all thank god
[2:24:03] because you know what we're all on
[2:24:04] different degrees of our intellect
[2:24:06] anyway
[2:24:07] some of you are great some of you are
[2:24:09] great iq's high iqs great thinkers i'm
[2:24:11] not that guy i'm just simple enough to
[2:24:13] believe god at his word
[2:24:15] amen
[2:24:17] but it just takes common faith in god
[2:24:19] just believe it like you would if your
[2:24:21] mother would say she was going to get
[2:24:23] something for you
[2:24:25] man when your mama how many you you kids
[2:24:27] over here cause there's most of the kids
[2:24:28] mama says they're gonna pick you up some
[2:24:30] from the store something you've been
[2:24:31] wanting
[2:24:32] you've nagged her to death did you get
[2:24:33] it did you get it did you get it come on

[2:24:40] it did you get like man good luck i
[2:24:42] heard him get this she can wear me out
[2:24:44] because mama said i'm going to give you
[2:24:46] something he said it's the same kind of
[2:24:49] faith
[2:24:50] when you ask something from god you just
[2:24:51] keep asking god did you get it did you
[2:24:54] get it did you get it did you get it did
[2:24:56] you get it god's like would you i got to
[2:24:57] hurt him get this
[2:24:59] but it's common faith
[2:25:01] he don't have to go sit under a school
[2:25:02] of prophets and understand the great
[2:25:04] mysteries of god and understand all the
[2:25:07] ins and outs of this message he's not
[2:25:08] depending on that some of us will never
[2:25:11] understand the great mysteries you're
[2:25:13] not called to understand the great
[2:25:14] mysteries you're called to believe the
[2:25:16] word of god amen
[2:25:19] god has called some men to open the
[2:25:21] great mysteries to us and he sent one
[2:25:23] man to do that
[2:25:25] and that was a prophet and he's opened
[2:25:27] the entire world all the mysteries have
[2:25:29] now been revealed
[2:25:31] right
[2:25:32] all he's asking for you may not
[2:25:33] understand one of them you may not be
[2:25:35] able to remember one scripture but he's
[2:25:37] asking you to believe
[2:25:39] he's asking you to believe brother baby
[2:25:42] says now may every sick person in the
[2:25:44] divine presence this morning may they
[2:25:46] reach over now and just jerk a handful
[2:25:49] of hyssop out of their own life what
[2:25:52] little faith that they have and then
[2:25:54] apply the blood of jesus christ to that
[2:25:56] sick place and just watch it welt away i
[2:25:59] say won't you just grab a handful of it
[2:26:00] tonight grab your handful of that faith
[2:26:02] tonight him apply it to your need it may
[2:26:05] not be sickness it may be a troubled
[2:26:07] spirit it may be something tormenting
[2:26:09] you it may be something you need
[2:26:10] deliverance from it may be a question
[2:26:12] about uh you know just whatever it may
[2:26:14] be a job opportunity or whatever just
[2:26:17] grab hold check you some some faith outs
[2:26:19] and i grab hold of the word and just
[2:26:21] pull on one thing lord i'm gonna believe
[2:26:23] what brother joe said tonight because
[2:26:24] i'm not taking it from a man but i'm
[2:26:26] taking it from you god i believe you
[2:26:28] come and you discern the very thoughts
[2:26:30] the very intents of my heart you knew
[2:26:32] what i had need of and you sent a little
[2:26:34] man from louisiana all the way up here
[2:26:36] and he's preached what exactly i have
[2:26:37] needed i'm going to grab some faith
[2:26:39] tonight lord and i'm going to begin to
[2:26:40] apply the blood apply the word to my
[2:26:43] life pride to my whole apply to my
[2:26:45] family applied to my america applied to
[2:26:47] my church pride to my job apply to my
[2:26:49] school god i'm going to keep on applying
[2:26:51] because your word declares it
[2:26:55] oh just apply he says coming up here
[2:26:57] he's talking to the people coming up
[2:26:58] here doesn't he say doesn't mean that
[2:27:00] you're going to get healed
[2:27:02] you can be healed out there as much as
[2:27:04] you can be healed up here
[2:27:06] see god will heal you on the merits of
[2:27:08] your faith
[2:27:10] and that alone
[2:27:12] just as you believe
[2:27:15] now we're preaching on nothing will
[2:27:17] stand before your prayer
[2:27:20] see your prayers so i'm trying to i'm
[2:27:22] trying to get your faith on the
[2:27:24] foundation
[2:27:25] you as a son of god nothing will stand
[2:27:27] before your prayer because god will
[2:27:29] honor your faith
[2:27:31] see now
[2:27:32] because faith is designed to see what
[2:27:34] god's will and wants there is no
[2:27:36] knowledge that can do that faith alone
[2:27:39] is designed
[2:27:40] and give to the human race to find out
[2:27:43] what the will of god is
[2:27:45] faith alone
[2:27:47] but when you've got god-given faith he's
[2:27:49] just focused he goes focused with the
[2:27:51] word of god you're directly in line and
[2:27:53] z wrote oh my he said god help us this
[2:27:55] hour great hour that we live in faith
[2:27:57] designed to see what god wants how do
[2:28:00] you see it through the camera of his
[2:28:01] word his promise this is the full
[2:28:04] revelation of jesus christ but he said
[2:28:07] many had failed to get their healing or
[2:28:10] they failed to get what they ask for
[2:28:12] because they take it as a myth or take
[2:28:14] it as an imagination
[2:28:16] he says faith is not an imagination it's
[2:28:18] just as real
[2:28:20] as any sense in your body
[2:28:23] now poke your neighbor real quick
[2:28:25] did you feel that
[2:28:27] did you feel that
[2:28:30] can i get a head nod at least yes
[2:28:33] okay so you felt that see that's not an
[2:28:35] imagination they touched you
[2:28:37] they hit you or poked you
[2:28:40] and it's just as real but the man said
[2:28:42] it's just as real as this is a piece of
[2:28:45] paper it's just as real as you see the
[2:28:47] lights on it's just as real as i feel my
[2:28:50] coat is just as real as you hear the
[2:28:51] baby talking about making this noise or
[2:28:53] the music playing it's just as real as i
[2:28:56] take something in my mouth it's that
[2:28:58] real only you can't show it to anybody
[2:29:01] he goes you have it alone see it's yours
[2:29:04] faith is a substance not just a myth
[2:29:07] i don't want faith to be some mythical
[2:29:09] thing that you got to work up to where
[2:29:11] you got to do hail mary's and you got to
[2:29:12] do this and do that and you got to work
[2:29:14] yourself work yourself because we'll
[2:29:15] never measure up
[2:29:17] because satan you do something wrong and
[2:29:19] he would take that and begin to beat you
[2:29:20] around the stump on it and then you got
[2:29:22] to now we feel like oh i gotta start all
[2:29:24] over again on my degrees of faith so i
[2:29:25] can reach up to believe no it doesn't
[2:29:27] operate that way
[2:29:29] he says now
[2:29:31] see it's something that you possess it's
[2:29:33] not an imagination it's a substance not
[2:29:35] an imagination not an emotion but
[2:29:37] something that you have and it comes to
[2:29:39] you by hearing the word of god and that
[2:29:41] only faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[2:29:44] the word of god that puts it back where
[2:29:46] your faith in is not in the individual
[2:29:49] it's not in a man it's not an
[2:29:51] organization it's not in a group of
[2:29:53] people it's in god and god is his word
[2:29:57] your faith is in god
[2:30:01] not by what somebody else did or
[2:30:03] somebody else said but what god's word
[2:30:05] said let every man's word be a lie and
[2:30:08] mine be truth now as we bring this down
[2:30:10] to a close robin talks about jesus here
[2:30:13] he said he was walking through the world
[2:30:15] with perfect faith because he was the
[2:30:18] word now if he was the groom
[2:30:20] and we are the bride
[2:30:22] how are we to walk through this world
[2:30:26] we walk through this world with perfect
[2:30:28] faith
[2:30:30] not perfect faith in your failed
[2:30:32] humanity but for perfect faith in the
[2:30:34] word of god who's declared you what you
[2:30:36] are
[2:30:37] he sent a prophet and that prophet said
[2:30:39] you are the pure virtuous
[2:30:42] sinless bride of jesus christ
[2:30:44] you can have perfect faith in knowing
[2:30:47] who you are see he was walking walking
[2:30:50] in the world with perfect faith because
[2:30:52] he was the word he says now if you abide
[2:30:55] in me and through him he brought the
[2:30:57] word to you and my words abide in you
[2:31:00] then walk in the same kind of way
[2:31:02] virtues flowing from you the rivers of
[2:31:04] god's fountains the blessings that are
[2:31:06] just flowing out to the people see what
[2:31:08] i mean you're not bluffing it you're not
[2:31:10] imagining it actually taking place you
[2:31:12] see it if you're not just imagining it
[2:31:14] don't do any good but if it's really
[2:31:16] there then he said it really happened
[2:31:20] so we are to walk through this world
[2:31:22] with perfect faith
[2:31:24] and the prophet of god will tell us
[2:31:25] perfect faith in a perfect word
[2:31:28] masters all circumstances
[2:31:31] there's not one thing that you'll face
[2:31:33] as a believer if your faith is anchored
[2:31:36] in the word of god that will ever defeat
[2:31:38] you
[2:31:39] so faith
[2:31:40] cometh by hearing
[2:31:42] hearing by the word of god and without
[2:31:45] faith it is impossible
[2:31:48] without faith it is impossible to please
[2:31:51] him he that cometh the god must believe
[2:31:54] that he is
[2:31:55] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[2:31:57] diligently seek him he must believe that
[2:32:00] he's infinite that he's eternal that
[2:32:02] he's self-existent that he's the cause
[2:32:04] of all other beings and everything
[2:32:05] depends on him the energy depends on him
[2:32:08] bounty providence everything exists
[2:32:09] because of him
[2:32:11] and the bible will tell us in james 5
[2:32:13] and verse 15 as we bring this to a close
[2:32:15] the prayer of faith
[2:32:17] shall save the sick
[2:32:20] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[2:32:22] and the lord shall raise him up if he
[2:32:24] committed sins they shall be forgiven
[2:32:26] him confess your faults one to another
[2:32:29] pray one for another that you may be
[2:32:31] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[2:32:34] righteous man availeth much the
[2:32:38] effectual that word there means
[2:32:41] it means active
[2:32:43] it means mighty this is not some dead
[2:32:45] prayer this is not some prayer offered
[2:32:48] in hope but this is a prayer offered in
[2:32:50] faith believing that god is going to do
[2:32:53] the mighty works and the bible said that
[2:32:55] the factual fervent prayer of the active
[2:32:57] prayer of a righteous man
[2:33:00] availeth much it means it endures much
[2:33:03] it does extraordinary deeds
[2:33:07] so otherwise the effectual fervent
[2:33:09] prayer of a righteous man
[2:33:12] avails accomplishes
[2:33:14] much
[2:33:16] now notice if one can chase a thousand
[2:33:19] and two ten thousand what about a church
[2:33:22] this size tonight
[2:33:24] what about a church this size tonight
[2:33:26] what about a church that let go of their
[2:33:28] problems they'll let go of the issues
[2:33:30] they'll let go the circumstances they'll
[2:33:31] let go what they see taste smell fill
[2:33:33] here and all these other things and
[2:33:35] they'll have faith in a perfect god in a
[2:33:37] perfect word and it's telling us tonight
[2:33:40] church that the prevailing power there's
[2:33:42] a prevailing power in this body in this
[2:33:45] church in this bride to do extraordinary
[2:33:47] deeds to do miracles to see the
[2:33:49] supernatural to believe for lost loved
[2:33:51] ones to come back power to overcome and
[2:33:54] not be overcome amen there's a power to
[2:33:57] overcome and not be
[2:34:00] overcome and i will end with this last
[2:34:03] scripture and we'll pick this back up
[2:34:04] tomorrow night
[2:34:06] daniel 11
[2:34:08] 32
[2:34:09] and such as do wickedly against the
[2:34:11] covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries
[2:34:13] but the people that know their god
[2:34:16] shall be strong and do exploits
[2:34:19] the people
[2:34:20] that know
[2:34:22] their god
[2:34:24] that word know there not only means to
[2:34:26] be known of god
[2:34:28] or to know god but it also means to be
[2:34:31] known of god amen so it's one thing to
[2:34:34] know god is another thing for god to
[2:34:36] know you
[2:34:37] so he's saying the people that know god
[2:34:40] and the people that god knows those
[2:34:42] people are going to do the great
[2:34:43] exploits
[2:34:44] because they have faith in my word

[2:39:37] ago or 60 years ago or 2 000 years ago
[2:39:40] but that same god is still here he's
[2:39:43] still present he's still moving he's
[2:39:45] still coming to church he's still
[2:39:47] speaking through the oracles he's still
[2:39:49] ministering to the needs and the hearts
[2:39:50] and the lives of the people and we're
[2:39:52] believing right now father nothing will

[2:40:21] wants to be said and what the spirit
[2:40:23] would like to be heard may there be any
[2:40:24] misconstruction or misinterpretation of
