[16:25] just as we go to prayer will sing nomura
[16:34] 7:56 whatever that is
[16:39] [Music]
[16:41] the more that I surrender right so just
[16:44] want to remember adults and with us we
[16:46] know brother Bob and sister Brenda are
[16:49] traveling pray grace to them and my
[16:51] brother Joseph I think is gonna join us
[16:53] later so just I'm going to remember him
[16:56] also on remember all the needs and just
[16:58] a couple of prayer requests hear from
[17:03] sister Maureen just passed passing on
[17:06] and sister sandy Collett is his under
[17:08] verge of selling her business she has an
[17:10] accounting business in Edmonton and for
[17:13] quite a while she recently been
[17:15] approached by the larger company that
[17:17] oversees her to buy the business so this
[17:20] is like good day she was she was hoping
[17:23] to you know this would happen she seems
[17:27] ready to sell and has advertised for a
[17:29] senior count to come on staff so that
[17:32] she could go quicker usually in those
[17:35] cases you know the owner would stay to
[17:37] it for years I guess she wants to get
[17:39] out sooner
[17:41] she she's concerned about her here's the
[17:45] prayer request she's concerned about her
[17:46] staff and and our clients to get someone
[17:52] that fits she she would just she's just
[17:54] a small shop just going into a bigger
[17:56] and then I know what happens with that
[17:59] and she has been taking good care of her
[18:02] staff and she's concerned about her
[18:03] Skidata staff and she charges reasonable
[18:06] prices to clients being a small business
[18:08] so she would appreciate your prayers on
[18:10] her behalf I'm sure to watch over those
[18:13] things in the transition I guess a lot
[18:16] of times it's just people are used to a
[18:18] certain way and soon as the new company
[18:19] comes in they just split and everything
[18:22] goes north and south so also another
[18:27] prayer request yesterday and she had a
[18:29] prayer request for a Nigerian man his
[18:32] name is chin chin Nadu Jinnah do he's
[18:37] from Nigeria and he was approached going
[18:41] twice yesterday at a supermarket and he
[18:45] he's a youth minister at a
[18:47] non-denominational Christian missionary
[18:50] fellowship here in town and seems to be
[18:53] hungry for revival and he said he feels
[18:57] something is brewing in st. John's yeah
[19:00] and he was a very warm man a really
[19:06] welcoming spirit and he had heard a lot
[19:09] about brother Brennan who felt he was a
[19:11] man of God that he had something special
[19:14] so just want to pray for him he seemed
[19:16] to when he said he had a very very very
[19:18] nice spirit he was just working there
[19:20] and they just collided so so grace to
[19:25] him he just seems to be looking in also
[19:27] gray stone
[19:29] he's been here four years now in from
[19:31] Nigeria and attends a church here so
[19:35] just want to remember those needs I
[19:36] think the more I surrender the lighter
[19:39] in my lord spike in the more he takes
[20:03] control the more that I can combo myself
[20:12] the more he lifts me up every day
[20:22] [Music]
[20:27] the more that I surrender the lighter my
[20:38] the more I release my kids the more he
[20:46] takes control the more that I can humble
[20:54] myself the more gives me up ever
[21:04] [Music]
[21:15] [Music]

[42:54] a man for glycine Oh Lord
[43:04] I
[43:05] [Music]
[43:08] a man praise the Lord thank God for
[43:18] grace amen praying the grace of God
[43:21] again to those that run to prayer
[43:23] requests and God's will be done
[43:27] again not my will father dying be done
[43:30] God knows amen
[43:33] so we pray the grace of God that we're
[43:36] going to submit to him we don't always
[43:38] know when it comes to the will of God if
[43:42] it's not recorded here and we then we
[43:45] have to wait on the Lord amen for him to
[43:48] control our thoughts our words and our
[43:50] deeds
[43:50] so the grace of God be with those under
[43:54] prayer request and also our the grace of
[43:56] God be with our brother Bob and sister
[43:58] Brenda's they travel
[43:59] amen so it'll be a few days I guess some
[44:02] day they'll be back so i dro pray that
[44:04] got a bless their fellowship with our
[44:06] brother Doug sister Beverly and sister
[44:09] Edna in Deer Lake and brother Bob has
[44:12] opened a fellowship with them and also
[44:14] to visit with brother George Heath at
[44:17] the he's in the same home now that
[44:20] sister Edna's in so we pray the grace of
[44:23] God with our brother amen
[44:26] and last time I met him our brother
[44:29] George was in New Brunswick and that was
[44:31] a number of years ago so and I think he
[44:34] was in a home they put him in a home
[44:36] there his family did and now he's back
[44:39] here in Newfoundland so god bless him a
[44:43] man and god bless brother Bob fellowship
[44:45] with with the Saints there in Deer Lake
[44:47] in that area by the grace of God
[44:51] unfortunately he may not have the time
[44:54] to stop and fellowship with others so
[44:57] again if any of the saints are going out
[45:01] that way we certainly encourage you to
[45:03] to take into consideration the brothers
[45:05] and sisters that are out there a man and
[45:09] whether it's our brothers and sisters in
[45:11] Carlinville
[45:12] whether it's the Saints in in bought
[45:15] wood a man or central Newfoundland brand
[45:18] falls so they're Saints there and you
[45:20] could go right on through to
[45:22] dearly amen and there are a number of
[45:25] those Saints of course are supporting
[45:26] the ministry here supporting this
[45:28] assembly so I I think that they they
[45:31] certainly they required but I think they
[45:34] also deserve our fellowship when we
[45:38] travel across the island a man and again
[45:41] and I think that's the will of God and
[45:43] so don't don't do your will our will is
[45:47] we want to do this we want to do that
[45:49] but what does God want you to do a man
[45:52] so I pray and you know it's like if
[45:55] you're going over there and you just
[45:56] ignore them well I think you're ignoring
[45:59] Jesus that is the absolute truth you're
[46:02] ignoring Jesus that's right but if you
[46:05] really want to fellowship with Jesus
[46:07] you're going to fellowship with them
[46:09] because they're also representing Jesus
[46:12] amen and that's where as I said before
[46:15] we are his ambassadors a man so and I'm
[46:20] sure if you were an ambassador for for
[46:23] Canada you will certainly take into
[46:25] consideration Canadians when you travel
[46:27] and of course to thank God for that for
[46:31] that thing that he has given us as
[46:34] Newfoundlanders and it's been
[46:37] highlighted you know around the world
[46:40] concerning new for Landers they say
[46:42] wherever new fermenters go they get
[46:44] together and that's not that's not like
[46:47] a lot of people don't have that that
[46:49] idea they don't have that nature but
[46:51] they said new Flanders do and that is
[46:54] that is the truth yes to ask the
[46:56] absolute truth wherever they go and you
[46:58] find new Flanders you're going to get
[47:00] together with Duford Landers and and so
[47:02] on and they said there's a well they
[47:05] said there's not a place you can go they
[47:07] don't think and again that was a that
[47:09] was a very popular magazine noted
[47:14] magazine around the world as it were
[47:17] especially in the in the Western world
[47:18] and they said that there's nowhere you
[47:21] can go but he said you'll find a new
[47:22] Philander a man and they did I like the
[47:25] fact and that that they were in India
[47:30] and of course they were they were in a
[47:32] very
[47:34] very important building in India and so
[47:37] on and I don't remember the name of the
[47:39] building now but it's a common name
[47:41] our brother Vajra would know but as I
[47:45] said this dis gentleman from the
[47:48] magazine there he got on the elevator
[47:50] and went to go down the floor of course
[47:52] he noticed that the gentlemen you know
[47:56] the young man that was controlling the
[47:58] elevator didn't look like an Indian so
[48:01] he asked him where he was from I mean he
[48:03] said where are you from
[48:04] well he said he said I'm from
[48:07] Newfoundland by all he said yes I know
[48:10] he knew by the way that he talked and he
[48:14] knew by the way did he look and he said
[48:16] it's amazing no matter where you go
[48:17] there's a new Philander well wherever
[48:20] you go there's Jesus a man I trust were
[48:23] reflecting that and as I said before
[48:25] that during the during way back years
[48:28] ago that new Freeland was as it were the
[48:30] the Bible Belt of Eastern Canada there
[48:34] are certain certain states in the United
[48:35] States that is the Bible Belt of the
[48:38] United States a man because that's
[48:40] that's where you find the moving of the
[48:42] Spirit of God was more in certain states
[48:44] not all states were just certain ones a
[48:47] man and and so it says in when it comes
[48:50] to in Canada when it comes to the moving
[48:53] of the Spirit of God there's more in
[48:55] Newfoundland than any other province
[48:56] that's right that's the truth because
[48:59] whether whether it's the Salvation Army
[49:01] where there's the Pentecost the the
[49:03] moving of the Spirit of God was more ear
[49:05] than then any anywhere else
[49:07] he went to come to Canada and he just
[49:09] went from here to somewhere else so we
[49:12] thank God for that
[49:13] and we trust it's the same when it comes
[49:15] to the message of the hour
[49:16] amen by the grace of God so Lord bless
[49:20] us as we continue in the message a man
[49:24] so let's Stan and Melissa sing only
[49:25] believe all things are possible as we go
[49:28] to the word amen
[49:30] so just keep all the Saints in prayer
[49:31] and the grace of God be with them
[49:34] amen Oh
[49:40] Oh
[49:45] all things are possible
[49:53] [Music]

[50:06] all things are possible only this
[50:23] believe that he's here a man
[50:26] halleloo let's believe that Jesus is
[50:29] with you that Jesus is with our brothers
[50:31] and sisters now they know they may
[50:34] that's his promise where I have gathered
[50:38] two or three in my name there I am he
[50:40] said in the midst sleazier hallelujah
[50:44] he's here to bless her she's here - eros
[50:47] is well with us a man

[57:24] [Music]
[57:39] a man praise the Lord god bless you turn
[57:43] with me to Matthew st. Matthew's Gospel
[57:47] chapter 26 sent you chapter 26 praise
[58:05] the Lord
[58:09] and beginning to read at verse 36 then
[58:18] cometh Jesus with him on to a place
[58:23] called Gethsemane and saith unto the
[58:28] disciples sit here while I go and pray
[58:34] yonder and he took with him Peter and
[58:38] the two sons of Zebedee and began to be
[58:43] sorrowful and very heavy a man and then
[58:48] saith he to them my soul is exceeding
[58:51] sorrowful even unto death grace that
[58:58] we're experiencing the joy of the Lord
[59:01] even unto the resurrection and the
[59:04] rapture we're dying to ourselves and
[59:07] dying to the world and becoming more and
[59:09] more alive to eternity
[59:12] so he said my soul is exceeding
[59:16] sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here
[59:20] and watch with me and he went a little
[59:25] further and fell on his face and prayed
[59:30] saying O my father if it be possible let
[59:37] this cup pass from me Jesus in the flesh
[59:42] being an example to us in prayer a man
[59:46] that we there are time when we
[59:49] experience what II was experiencing
[59:53] not our will but is will be done as he
[59:58] was healing to the father's will from
[1:00:01] eternity a man whole my father if it be
[1:00:05] possible let this cup pass from me
[1:00:09] nevertheless not as I will but as thou
[1:00:14] wilt God's grace to us that in all
[1:00:18] circumstances in all situations we're
[1:00:21] going to yield to the will of God a man
[1:00:24] and he cometh unto the disciples and
[1:00:28] findeth them asleep and saith unto Peter
[1:00:33] what could we not watch with me could
[1:00:37] you not watch with me one hour one hour
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:00:42] watch and pray that ye enter not into
[1:00:47] temptation we need to watch we need to
[1:00:51] pray amen the spirit indeed is willing
[1:00:55] but the flesh is weak so even this was
[1:01:01] permitted to give us wisdom revelation
[1:01:04] understanding concerning prayer and
[1:01:08] concerning the battle with the flesh
[1:01:12] that he had a battle with the flesh so
[1:01:15] we also have a battle with the place a
[1:01:17] man now facing exactly what he was
[1:01:21] facing but we have other issues that we
[1:01:24] deal with when it comes to prayer but
[1:01:26] brother everyone are we going to stay in
[1:01:28] prayer are we going to give ourselves
[1:01:29] over to prayer as Jesus gave himself a
[1:01:32] man praise the name of the Lord then he
[1:01:36] wasn't he wasn't going to yield to it to
[1:01:39] the weakness of the flesh a man he was
[1:01:41] going to follow the leadership of the
[1:01:43] Holy Ghost praise the Lord
[1:01:45] and he cometh under the disciples and
[1:01:48] findeth them asleep and saith unto Peter
[1:01:50] what could she not watch with me one
[1:01:53] hour they want less than that in worship
[1:01:57] today watch and pray that he entered not
[1:02:02] into temptation showing us the
[1:02:04] significance of prayer the sing
[1:02:07] evidence of being on our guard father
[1:02:10] and brothers was ever in any our in any
[1:02:12] ages in this hour and in this age a man
[1:02:14] we're in it is deception to the place to
[1:02:18] enter the place where Jesus said if he
[1:02:20] didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved
[1:02:21] this is serious a man and whether we
[1:02:25] ought to have a serious attitude in our
[1:02:27] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:28] a serious attitude when it comes to the
[1:02:31] revelation of the word a serious
[1:02:33] attitude when it comes to what God asked
[1:02:34] as laid in our laps
[1:02:36] the revelation the responsibility ain't
[1:02:39] man this is not what they got over there
[1:02:41] no no that's the foolish virgin we're
[1:02:44] supposed to be the wise virgins by the
[1:02:47] grace of Almighty God so I trust we go
[1:02:49] wherever we got the wisdom of God and we
[1:02:51] got the leadership of God in our lives

[1:02:55] the wisdom of God all my brother it is

[1:07:35] on what is the will of God so are we in
[1:07:39] the will of God is the will of God in
[1:07:41] control of us when it comes to our
[1:07:43] relationship with with with all of these
[1:07:45] things a man when it comes to our jobs
[1:07:48] when it comes to doing this when it
[1:07:50] comes to doing that going here going
[1:07:51] there what is the will of God brother
[1:07:54] sister we need to come to that place no
[1:07:57] matter whenever what the decision is we
[1:07:59] have to make brother we got to come to
[1:08:01] that place and we got to watch and pray
[1:08:03] and we got to humble ourselves with Lord
[1:08:06] not my wheel fine be done well I I don't
[1:08:10] feel that that God is against his we got
[1:08:13] us again now saying God is against that
[1:08:15] or against that but brother what is the
[1:08:17] will of God
[1:08:18] a man who's anything God is going to
[1:08:20] bless it is a brother or sister a son or
[1:08:24] a daughter it is a life that is that is
[1:08:26] that it's lined up with his will it is a
[1:08:29] life that is looking for his will it is
[1:08:31] life that is there to do his will a man
[1:08:33] 3 again that's why God has been looking
[1:08:36] for all the way down through not much
[1:08:38] someone that's their desperate that's
[1:08:40] willing to accept the will of God and
[1:08:42] not their own will and rather we can go
[1:08:44] right back again to the book of Genesis
[1:08:46] a man brother Wayne and again that
[1:08:49] that's the choice Alleluia
[1:08:52] that's exactly the choice that man is
[1:08:54] given as a choice whether when it comes
[1:08:56] to the original sin it is either the
[1:08:59] will of God or your will a man and then
[1:09:04] Satan was challenging that in II a man
[1:09:07] are you subject to the will of God are
[1:09:09] you controlled by the will of God or you
[1:09:12] know what is it oh and Eve say yeah if
[1:09:14] God said yeah he said God has said but I
[1:09:17] say unto you and and he said it in such
[1:09:20] a way so it's so it's too ordered the
[1:09:23] truth to deceiver he said it in such a
[1:09:26] way as to or to get her attention and
[1:09:27] the other hand she listened to what he
[1:09:29] was saying amen she listened to him when
[1:09:33] he added that one word yay I say a day
[1:09:36] God has said but any bad there's no buts
[1:09:40] brother but but Sir last hour some
[1:09:44] brother brought it here one time but Sir
[1:09:46] sheep not sheep but goats goats but but
[1:09:49] sheep don't but hey man there's goats
[1:09:52] cool but here and they bought this and
[1:09:54] they bought that hey yeah
[1:09:56] but brother the sheep don't but the
[1:09:57] Sheep just follows those Templars a man
[1:10:00] they they recognize the the voice of the
[1:10:03] shepherd they recognize the hearing of
[1:10:05] the of the word of the Shepherd amen
[1:10:07] and they know their shepherd a man by
[1:10:09] Hawaii because the Sheep knows that the
[1:10:11] Shepherd knows them and they know the
[1:10:12] shepherd a man praise the name of the
[1:10:15] Lord as I told you what we saw hey in
[1:10:17] Israel when we're a in Jerusalem in the
[1:10:20] hotel there way and we looked at and we
[1:10:21] saw all of these sheep in this field and
[1:10:24] then all of a sudden we saw you know all
[1:10:26] the sheep begin the move and some wind
[1:10:28] this way and some wind that way some in
[1:10:30] another way and we are wondering what
[1:10:32] going on until we noticed that there was
[1:10:35] four or five different shepherds and
[1:10:37] they had called the Sheep and this one
[1:10:41] was calling his sheep that was calling
[1:10:42] is she another was calling is she and
[1:10:45] there she recognized their voice a man
[1:10:48] and that's why they were moving in and
[1:10:50] out between each other a man - why
[1:10:53] because they they were going into the
[1:10:55] direction of the voice of their shepherd
[1:10:57] and this one went this way that one win
[1:11:00] that way another one went that way
[1:11:01] a man they brother see there's their
[1:11:04] faithful to the voice of their Shepherd
[1:11:06] they're not good they're not going to
[1:11:07] obey the voice of another Shepherd no
[1:11:10] just their Shepherd amen hallelujah no
[1:11:13] will no wonder why God God our God put
[1:11:15] these examples in the scripture of
[1:11:17] shepherds and sheep that God is calling
[1:11:20] a sheep not goats God is comparing us to
[1:11:24] sheep because why sheep are going to
[1:11:26] recognize the voice of their Shepherd
[1:11:28] and they're going to stay with their
[1:11:29] Shepherd amen when they're super cows
[1:11:31] they're going to recognize his voice and
[1:11:33] they're going to follow him amen whether
[1:11:35] it was in Luther's day on Wesley's day
[1:11:37] the Pentecostal age or whether it was
[1:11:40] even the old-fashioned Salvation Army a
[1:11:42] man they heard the Shepherd and they
[1:11:44] went that way all mine oh yeah what's
[1:11:47] wrong with you Wesley what's wrong with
[1:11:49] you Luther
[1:11:49] oh I'm following the voice of the
[1:11:51] shepherd a man and then when when they
[1:11:54] brought him but Luther up before the
[1:11:55] council and they wanted him to deny this
[1:11:57] and deny that they want him to go along
[1:11:59] with the church and deny what God had
[1:12:02] revealed to them and Luther just took
[1:12:04] his stand and he said this is the Word
[1:12:06] of God this is this is that and the
[1:12:09] finally and they even threatened his
[1:12:11] life but he said listen he said here I
[1:12:13] stand he said I can do no other amen
[1:12:17] he could do no yes as a believer he knew
[1:12:19] he could do anything else but stay with
[1:12:21] the word he could do anything else but
[1:12:23] stay with what God had revealed to him
[1:12:25] he wasn't going to compromise for the
[1:12:27] church hey man he wasn't going to
[1:12:30] compromise for the ministry and there
[1:12:32] there's many believers today there are
[1:12:34] compromising for ministries a man
[1:12:36] compromising for this kind of noise over
[1:12:38] there and allowing this for now in there
[1:12:40] ain't man they are but brother I turn
[1:12:42] this where's the ministry is trying to
[1:12:44] get you on fire for God where's the

[1:32:15] saying that winner man was controlled by

[1:32:18] was from the devil and he did this that
[1:32:20] was the devil he did that that was it oh
[1:32:22] brother
[1:32:23] if they're saying that about what
[1:32:25] happened in winter in Browns ministry
[1:32:26] they would have said the same thing in
[1:32:27] the days of Jesus hey man oh yeah
[1:32:31] because he had that ministry a man he
[1:32:34] had those signs and wonders he was just
[1:32:36] learning the thoughts and intents of the
[1:32:37] heart
[1:32:37] he was doing this he was doing that amen
[1:32:40] brother that was God that wasn't the
[1:32:43] devil that was God mother that those
[1:32:46] they called him the devil brother they
[1:32:48] were committing to any absolute sin I
[1:32:52] pray God had mercy on that woman amen to
[1:32:57] bring conviction her heart or soul amen
[1:32:59] all condemn condemning the prophet of
[1:33:02] God because this is somebody in her
[1:33:04] family was all being influenced by the
[1:33:06] message someone who had being influenced
[1:33:07] way by the thoughts about William
[1:33:09] Brannon and who he was and so on my
[1:33:11] brother and all my because she was why
[1:33:15] she was taking her stead for
[1:33:16] denomination she was taking her sad for
[1:33:19] her church but not the word Taylor said
[1:33:22] for for a man but not not not God
[1:33:26] brother it wasn't William Branham it was
[1:33:30] God and again brother again when the
[1:33:33] belem didn't didn't take the glory he
[1:33:34] give the glory to God and that's what he
[1:33:36] said
[1:33:37] if you look at that picture in you you
[1:33:39] have you seen anything else on that
[1:33:40] picture
[1:33:40] other than the pillar of fire he said
[1:33:42] you're something wrong yeah don't don't
[1:33:45] see him no no he says don't look at me
[1:33:47] he's looking at him amen brother sister
[1:33:52] again why because they when that picture
[1:33:54] was taken here they there took a number
[1:33:56] of pictures of the minister that was
[1:33:58] challenging him the minister was calling
[1:34:00] him a false prophet they took picture of
[1:34:02] the picture the picture and when he got
[1:34:04] up they took a picture
[1:34:05] just one yeah and to pay then they
[1:34:10] notice the pillar fire they even like
[1:34:12] though you know it but they even went to
[1:34:14] and got the FBI they come and check the
[1:34:17] picture oh yeah they got the FBI and
[1:34:20] then the FBI checked it and the FBI went
[1:34:22] to where it was taken and
[1:34:24] see if there was a light there there was
[1:34:25] no light there no this is no light there
[1:34:28] they said dude and he said well where
[1:34:31] did they come from he said well that's
[1:34:32] the reason because it was there when you
[1:34:34] took the picture yeah brother it was God
[1:34:39] amen
[1:34:40] because because he made it just made a
[1:34:43] statement and to defend himself and a
[1:34:45] there I don't know many thousand people
[1:34:47] were in the in that audience tree at the
[1:34:48] time amen
[1:34:49] but again they're the news people were
[1:34:51] there taking pictures and so on and then
[1:34:54] he just he just made a statement and
[1:34:56] then he heard though he heard the
[1:35:00] whirlwind and he he said I I'll say no
[1:35:04] more
[1:35:04] he said got it the Lord has spoken he
[1:35:07] knew they God had come down how he
[1:35:10] wasn't sure but that was it right there
[1:35:12] Amen so brother that way that wasn't
[1:35:15] with a band that was gone and then that
[1:35:17] cloud of angels that wasn't William
[1:35:19] Brennan that was gone
[1:35:20] hey man and again science science guy
[1:35:23] got no explanation with a pillar of fire
[1:35:25] science got no explanation for the cloud
[1:35:27] of angels and science got no explanation
[1:35:29] for here for the altar of fire amen
[1:35:32] again this is this is like I said this
[1:35:34] is Ricky alert ooh and brothers the
[1:35:36] altar of fire and here's we're gonna BAM
[1:35:38] there but he said you're seeing me there
[1:35:40] but he said I'm right here and he is I
[1:35:44] can see him there he's there brother
[1:35:49] that wasn't God that was that was God
[1:35:52] rather but it wasn't the devil and it
[1:35:54] wasn't with him random it was Jesus amen
[1:35:57] brother this is this is not revealing
[1:35:59] winner Branum this is this is just as
[1:36:02] revealing Jesus Christ he was giving
[1:36:04] their premise to God amen and even Jesus
[1:36:07] in the flesh he was God in flesh but he
[1:36:09] was given preeminence to God
[1:36:11] hey man he was giving premise to the
[1:36:13] Father amen
[1:36:15] praise the ER though he was the father
[1:36:17] and he's throwing the father one hey man
[1:36:20] sorry but again he just it was a lesson
[1:36:23] an example for you and me he was the
[1:36:26] example for you and me to give
[1:36:28] preeminence to God
[1:36:29] hey man for the glory of God so brother
[1:36:32] we're going to do God a service but
[1:36:34] according to his will we can be doing it
[1:36:37] by
[1:36:37] contrary to his will without his will
[1:36:40] and if it's real as well he's not
[1:36:43] pleased with it I'll give you a couple
[1:36:45] of samples in the in the scripture there
[1:36:47] there's many many examples in the
[1:36:49] scripture where the word this one did
[1:36:51] this and this one did that but they
[1:36:53] didn't do it according to the will of
[1:36:54] God if it was according to the will of
[1:36:56] God God would have been well pleased and
[1:36:59] he would receive that he would have
[1:37:01] blessed him a man is like David going
[1:37:04] down to bring back the Ark of the
[1:37:05] Covenant but he did this he did it this
[1:37:07] way didn't do it so he didn't do it but
[1:37:08] he didn't consult the Prophet amen to
[1:37:11] get the counsel of doing it God's Way a
[1:37:14] man and that's why God come and did what
[1:37:17] he did and stopped it and again there
[1:37:19] was a time when David wanted to he
[1:37:21] wanted to they order take a number of
[1:37:23] the children of Israel to see how many
[1:37:26] he had all I got this many and I got I
[1:37:29] can fight this did this country I can
[1:37:31] fight that nation that nation so on amen
[1:37:34] and his faith was in the number that he
[1:37:36] had it not in God amen and God come down
[1:37:40] in God to God so David yeah and he said
[1:37:42] my son he said I'm gonna give you I got
[1:37:44] you two or three choices to give you he
[1:37:46] sought to judge you he said which one do
[1:37:49] you want a man that's God's grace but I
[1:37:53] didn't it didn't it didn't take away
[1:37:55] what he's gonna do but he just gave
[1:37:56] David a choice amen
[1:38:00] what what God was gonna do why because
[1:38:03] David doing what he did and numbering
[1:38:05] the people was a contrary to the will of
[1:38:07] God God wasn't pleased why because there
[1:38:11] was testimony of his lack of faith in
[1:38:14] God he wasn't believing God he wasn't
[1:38:18] trusting God amen on saying well I got
[1:38:21] no words he's got us with us and God
[1:38:22] gives us the victory God's gonna do this
[1:38:24] and so on no he felt that if if he had a
[1:38:26] great number and he had more numbers
[1:38:28] than than than the other end the enemy
[1:38:30] had or the other nation had he had no
[1:38:32] worse brother no matter how few he had
[1:38:36] if his faith was in God he had no words
[1:38:39] amen brother story there God's come down
[1:38:44] and judge David for what he did and how
[1:38:46] he did it
[1:38:47] brother how are we doing what we're
[1:38:49] doing in our lives

[1:39:08] that a man because what you do and don't

[1:40:02] their own will they do and and when it
[1:40:05] comes are going out they're not doing
[1:40:06] what God wants them to do how God wants

[1:48:02] and higher by the grace of God but he
[1:48:05] just put that in for them yeah because
[1:48:09] they were hungry on thirsting for the
[1:48:11] head so he just put in filler well

[1:48:21] to say that he said what for he said to
[1:48:24] bring up their attitude oh yeah he says

[1:48:33] real serious to get them real real real
[1:48:35] somber he said what what did God want me

[1:50:11] see thought I had it there see we have a
[1:50:30] complete obedience and sometimes in this

[1:52:27] it wasn't God's will for them to bring
[1:52:28] the cattle back it wasn't God's will for
[1:52:30] them to bring the the king back and and
[1:52:34] there was somebody that question why did
[1:52:36] God tell tell them to kill even the
[1:52:38] children the prophet of God explained it
[1:52:47] someone asked him they said God told him
[1:52:49] to kill the children after he preached
[1:52:52] that he said yes and they said why he
[1:52:56] said because they were growing and
[1:52:58] melech heights and he said they had a
[1:53:02] heart against Israel that's right

[1:53:08] that's why he sent Saul down kill them
[1:53:11] kill them all kill man woman and
[1:53:14] children why
[1:53:16] listen Saints the brother the prophet of
[1:53:19] God said he said seed of God can give

[1:54:45] God was dealing with her she was
[1:54:47] recognizing it and of all the family she
[1:54:51] came out as a seed of God just think of
[1:54:54] that you talk about predestination
[1:54:56] foreknown before the foundation of the
[1:54:59] world she was and she came out and she
[1:55:02] all the pictures that she painted and
[1:55:04] they were ended and a family was shocked

[1:55:12] pictures of heaven features of the seed
[1:55:16] of God oh yeah pictures of sons and
[1:55:19] daughters of God how they act how they
[1:55:22] gather they dress and so on absolutely
[1:55:24] amazing I said Lord bless her wherever
[1:55:27] she is amen

[1:55:33] stay with the Word of God if you're a
[1:55:35] seed of God you're going you're gonna be
[1:55:37] brother you're gonna take your stand for
[1:55:39] the truth you're gonna stay with it
[1:55:41] you're not going to compromise if you're
[1:55:44] the seat of God you're gonna be doing
[1:55:46] God a service according to his will
[1:55:48] cuz the seat of God wants the will of
[1:55:50] God amen
[1:55:52] right
[1:55:59] and it said Samuel said to Saul when
[1:56:04] there was little in thine own site was
[1:56:08] thou not made the head of the tribes of
[1:56:10] Israel and the Lord anointed thee king
[1:56:14] over Israel and the Lord sent me on a
[1:56:18] journey and said go and utterly destroy
[1:56:21] the sinners the Amalekites and fight
[1:56:25] against them until they be consumed and
[1:56:27] wherefore then didst thou not obey the
[1:56:31] voice of the Lord but it's fly upon the
[1:56:34] spoil and it's evil in the sight of the
[1:56:37] Lord
[1:56:43] have you done an evil in the sight of
[1:56:46] the Lord today what will what evil would
[1:56:51] you think I did well if there's anything
[1:56:54] that's contrary to the will of God you
[1:56:58] did evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:57:00] you did your will not God's will we need
[1:57:05] to be on our guard
[1:57:06] general watch and pray you're gonna pray
[1:57:08] to stay in the spirit and be led by the
[1:57:11] spirit you had to pray just to keep the
[1:57:14] revelation of God in your heart and your
[1:57:17] soul God in control
[1:57:20] there's many believers brothers they go
[1:57:22] to church they've been baptized you know
[1:57:25] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:57:27] and when it comes to dressing the dress
[1:57:29] you know decent and and the sisters are
[1:57:31] there this and dad they did they dress
[1:57:33] decent and so on but the prophet of Gaza
[1:57:35] you can do that and go to hell what
[1:57:39] because it's not out of the heart it's
[1:57:42] just a really religion out of the head
[1:57:43] of the mind out of your flesh it's got
[1:57:47] to be from the heart borned again by the
[1:57:51] grace of God and your bringing forth
[1:57:52] that that born-again life it's just
[1:57:55] automatic automatic the devil can come
[1:57:57] but the but if you're born again the new
[1:57:59] creature says get thee behind me Satan
[1:58:01] it is written thus saith the Lord amen
[1:58:05] if you're born again but if you're not
[1:58:08] born again you just reason with the
[1:58:09] devil oh yeah
[1:58:12] mercy on us oh brother this is serious
[1:58:15] serious he said thou didst able in the
[1:58:20] sight of the Lord what were they doing
[1:58:23] doing God a service without his will
[1:58:26] because they're saying they brought the
[1:58:28] cattle back first to offer a sacrifice
[1:58:29] to the Lord you want to do this for the
[1:58:32] Lord won't do that for the Lord but that
[1:58:33] wasn't the will of God do we doing God a
[1:58:36] service without his will it was their
[1:58:39] thoughts well as Satan anointing their
[1:58:41] thoughts and Satan the Knights of
[1:58:43] thinking of believers oh yeah
[1:58:48] brothers so deceptive they make but
[1:58:51] again he'll make you believe it's good
[1:58:54] for you it's good for this one good for
[1:58:57] that one but it's deceiving it's not the
[1:58:59] will of God oh you make me believe those
[1:59:02] things because why he's using human
[1:59:06] reasoning fleshly reasoning good for
[1:59:12] your flesh but not your soul tell you
[1:59:15] that a nice and Saul said unto Samuel
[1:59:19] yay I have obeyed the voice of the Lord
[1:59:23] yeah he'll hug you with you I don't meet
[1:59:30] and have gone the way which the Lord
[1:59:33] sent me and have brought egged the king
[1:59:37] of melih of their malachite and have
[1:59:39] utterly destroyed the Amalekites well if
[1:59:42] they utterly destroy them where did the
[1:59:44] King come from Co deceiving they felt
[1:59:50] because they destroyed all the rest you
[1:59:53] know then he well yeah that'll please
[1:59:56] God I'll just bring the King back God to
[1:59:59] destroy them all including the King and
[2:00:02] just think if you don't do it the
[2:00:08] ministry got to do it because Samuel had
[2:00:13] to change I went and took the king and
[2:00:15] killed him
[2:00:21] yeah what a responsibility and Samuel
[2:00:29] said under Sara Saul said unto Samuel I
[2:00:32] have obeyed the voice of the Lord and
[2:00:34] have gone the way of which the Lord sent
[2:00:35] me and it brought egged the King of Hell
[2:00:38] and malachite and have utterly destroyed
[2:00:40] the Amalekites but the people took of
[2:00:43] the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of
[2:00:46] the things which should have been
[2:00:48] already destroyed to sacrifice unto the
[2:00:51] Lord thy God in Gilgal well they should
[2:00:54] have sacrificed it were the Amalekites
[2:00:57] were amen
[2:01:00] God said kill it because as far as God
[2:01:02] was concerned
[2:01:03] it wasn't is Israel's sheep and oxen it
[2:01:07] was the Amalekites amen and Sanur said
[2:01:13] had the Lord a great delight in burnt
[2:01:15] offerings and sacrifices as in obeying
[2:01:18] the voice of the Lord
[2:01:19] Oh loves God want you to do this isn't
[2:01:23] this or do you want you just obey he
[2:01:25] wants you to obey he writes should have
[2:01:28] follow his leadership of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:30] in your life the conviction of the Holy
[2:01:33] Ghost in your soul is what he wants you
[2:01:35] to follow but yet people think I want to
[2:01:38] do this for God I wonder you better find
[2:01:39] the will of God amen
[2:01:43] doing God a service without his well and
[2:01:45] the Prophet brings it down to all mine
[2:01:47] the basics you bring it down to this
[2:01:50] bring it down to this bring it out of
[2:01:51] that oh yeah we think all you're
[2:01:53] religious because you do this for God
[2:01:54] you do that for God but God's not
[2:01:56] pleased why because you're you're not
[2:02:01] doing according to his will you're doing
[2:02:04] according to your will but not God's Way
[2:02:10] oh yeah if I could I find in it
[2:02:15] something a bit hard myself to bring out
[2:02:20] some of these things
[2:02:21] Oh amen brother
[2:02:24] oh yeah I said old or I said you're
[2:02:31] putting me on the spot you're putting
[2:02:32] everyone every one of us every brother
[2:02:34] sisters on the spot here I said this
[2:02:36] mess just think these are these are like
[2:02:39] I said the message they preach to the
[2:02:40] believers god help us Samuel said as the
[2:02:48] Lord our great delight in burnt
[2:02:50] offerings and sacrifices as in obeying
[2:02:54] the voice of the Lord be old to obey is
[2:02:57] better than sacrifice hey man therefore
[2:03:01] all that will make sacrifices he does
[2:03:03] this does this does this she does this
[2:03:05] she does that yeah yeah but that one
[2:03:08] they whatever I tell them to do they do
[2:03:12] yeah
[2:03:13] oh you consider them better oh yeah yeah
[2:03:18] they're sacrificing themselves hey hey
[2:03:23] man you're sacrificing their own ideas
[2:03:25] and their own thoughts and so on they're
[2:03:27] sacrificing their own will for my will
[2:03:29] for the will of God let's do God a
[2:03:32] service with his will according to his
[2:03:36] will amen he said Behold to obey is
[2:03:41] better than sacrifice amen and oricon
[2:03:47] then the fat of rams for rebellion is as
[2:03:52] the sin of witchcraft if you refuse to
[2:03:54] do the will of God God will judge you
[2:03:58] for witchcraft
[2:04:01] yeah rebellion because your rebellion
[2:04:04] against God's will you don't feel this
[2:04:06] is the will of God you feel this is the
[2:04:08] will I wanna do to God I think God would
[2:04:10] do this I think God loved not what you
[2:04:12] think definitely not it's what God they
[2:04:16] see examples that God has given us in
[2:04:18] the world hello
[2:04:20] praise the name of the Lord hallelu
[2:04:23] where were that excuse because brother
[2:04:26] there's not a thing that we would have
[2:04:27] to deal with but we're somewhere and
[2:04:29] somewhere it's in the word oh I believe
[2:04:32] that but you got it you got to be in the
[2:04:35] spirit to get it so God can convict you
[2:04:38] of it when you're reading the word Oh
[2:04:40] Lord
[2:04:41] oh yes oh Lord I was thinking that I was
[2:04:44] thinking that Lord I don't want that I'm
[2:04:47] sorry Lord forgive me we think because
[2:04:52] we're in the message we think because
[2:04:53] we're dressed this win that will become
[2:04:55] two churches for this for that oh I got
[2:04:57] nowhere soon dieted Oh Lord I'm
[2:05:01] righteous yeah you better get in the
[2:05:06] spirit see if you're like a man if you
[2:05:10] got the Holy Ghost
[2:05:11] you show you the only goes to show you
[2:05:14] where you're where you're making a
[2:05:15] mistake and where your failure your
[2:05:18] weaknesses he knows oh my it's like I
[2:05:23] said you can go to hell not because of
[2:05:25] what you did sometimes it's because of
[2:05:27] what you didn't do yeah you didn't do
[2:05:31] the will of God
[2:05:34] this was the will of God you didn't do
[2:05:36] it you did your own will
[2:05:38] yeah your reason you think oh yeah Gaga
[2:05:42] night against this night against that
[2:05:44] but the thing of it is is it your is it
[2:05:47] his will well well God got nothing
[2:05:51] against it y'all God don't know it's not
[2:05:52] not opposed to this he's not opposed to
[2:05:54] that but again that doesn't mean he
[2:05:56] wants you to do it doesn't mean he want
[2:05:59] he wants you to do this and do this and
[2:06:00] do that no no no if it's not according
[2:06:03] to his widow he knows your spirit he
[2:06:08] knows what's motivating you did you want
[2:06:11] to do this you want to do that he knows
[2:06:16] he knew Saul's spirit and attitude why
[2:06:22] he wanted this and why he wanted that
[2:06:23] and so on brother sister let's make our
[2:06:26] calling and election sure amen
[2:06:30] make sure
[2:06:32] that what we do for the Lord is
[2:06:35] according to his will no matter how
[2:06:38] religious it is no it might look
[2:06:41] spiritual to you no don't do it if it's
[2:06:44] not the will of God rebellion is as the
[2:06:52] sin of witchcraft yeah if you're gonna
[2:06:55] rebel against the will of God we think
[2:06:58] of rebellion or a God fighting
[2:07:00] God no no rebellion is to go country to
[2:07:03] his will still be religious and think oh
[2:07:07] well thank you Lord for saving us the
[2:07:09] son our daughter you're not doing my
[2:07:13] will
[2:07:13] you're still doing what's right in your
[2:07:15] own eyes do what's right in mine eyes
[2:07:18] that's what God wants you to do and it
[2:07:23] says because thou has rejected the word
[2:07:25] of the Lord yes also rejected they from
[2:07:29] being King and what was the word there
[2:07:31] wasn't this doctrine this doctrine this
[2:07:32] doctrine it was what God wanted them to
[2:07:34] do in their life God wanted that this is
[2:07:38] he was a king he was a leader and God
[2:07:40] wanted him to take take his soldiers out
[2:07:42] and do this and do this and do this
[2:07:43] don't change it do it the way God said
[2:07:46] that's right yeah and they reject the
[2:07:52] word what is the word the will of God
[2:07:55] you know this is what Saul rejected the
[2:07:59] will of God and believers reject the
[2:08:01] will of God they want their own will
[2:08:05] it's doing what again was right in their
[2:08:07] own eyes and this is because that was
[2:08:11] rejected the word of the Lord
[2:08:13] yes also rejected thee from being King
[2:08:19] and if we reject the word of the Lord
[2:08:21] the will of God that he'll reject us
[2:08:25] from being the bride
[2:08:31] now saying we're lost we might be
[2:08:33] foolish virgins not wise yeah
[2:08:36] some are lost for sure because of their
[2:08:39] absolute wrong attitude wrong spirit
[2:08:42] wrong older strong objectives but if
[2:08:44] it's not in the will of God
[2:08:46] yeah might be foolish virgins but they
[2:08:51] don't get into the marriage supper they
[2:08:55] turned away and Saul said unto Samuel I
[2:09:00] have sinned
[2:09:01] for I have transgressed the commandment
[2:09:03] of the Lord and thy words because I
[2:09:07] feared the people or sometimes because
[2:09:13] you want to be a benefit to the people
[2:09:14] you want to do this for the people that
[2:09:16] put it be you won't be good in the eyes
[2:09:17] of the people no you gotta be good in
[2:09:18] the eyes of the Lord not the people
[2:09:23] oh what a deal you have to cost under
[2:09:25] the betel I stir the number in the after
[2:09:28] there are so many that are looking for
[2:09:32] looking for preeminence among the people
[2:09:35] looking to feel good in the eyes of the
[2:09:37] people to do this to do that no let's
[2:09:41] make sure we feel good in the eyes of
[2:09:42] God amen and because you had rejected
[2:09:48] the word of the Lord he had also
[2:09:50] rejected thee from being King or from
[2:09:53] being the bride and Saul said unto
[2:09:57] Samuel I have sinned
[2:09:58] prior transgressed the commandment of
[2:10:00] the Lord he finally admitted it he
[2:10:03] humbled himself repented nothing you
[2:10:09] believed he was saved
[2:10:10] yeah but he was rejected as king
[2:10:20] he said I had transgressed the
[2:10:22] commandment of the Lord and thy words
[2:10:24] and because I feared the people and
[2:10:27] obeyed their voice yeah
[2:10:30] they feared the people and there's
[2:10:32] ministries that dared us to oppress the
[2:10:35] people yeah because they don't want the
[2:10:38] people to reject them well if you're
[2:10:40] gonna preach the word if they're seen of
[2:10:42] God they won't reject the ministry hey
[2:10:44] man if you're not they will you know god
[2:10:49] help us he said I feared the people and
[2:10:53] obeyed their voice a man it's not doing
[2:10:57] what the people wants doing what God
[2:10:58] wants no you want to make the people
[2:11:03] feel feel good just given the revelation
[2:11:07] that they need to line up with
[2:11:09] straighten them out correct them yeah
[2:11:15] that this is a when it comes to the
[2:11:20] preacher of the word it is it is the
[2:11:23] correction by the word keeping us lined
[2:11:27] up with the word ain't man it's not just
[2:11:30] building up our knowledge of doctrines
[2:11:32] no no is to keep us in line with the
[2:11:35] will of God for and the Word of God so
[2:11:39] that it'll give us the faith that
[2:11:40] pleases God for the resurrection and the
[2:11:42] rapture people think all the ministries
[2:11:47] there to preach this and preach this and
[2:11:48] preach this well now I know this now I
[2:11:50] know that now I know that it's all so it
[2:11:54] really sometimes impersonal doctrines
[2:11:56] and theology but whatever personal
[2:12:00] correction
[2:12:05] most don't want correction I've
[2:12:06] experienced that over the years the
[2:12:09] church has I've been in people don't
[2:12:11] want correction they don't want the
[2:12:13] preacher to correct them
[2:12:14] they don't want the preacher to preach
[2:12:16] test it I want the preacher preach that
[2:12:17] no I just preach doctrine we believe
[2:12:20] this we believe this we believe that
[2:12:23] it's a Creed we believe no God's grace
[2:12:30] he's I feared the people and obeyed
[2:12:33] their voice now therefore I pray thee
[2:12:35] pardon my sin and turn again he said
[2:12:39] with me that I may worship the Lord and
[2:12:41] Sonia said unto Saul I will not return
[2:12:44] with thee for thou has rejected the word
[2:12:47] of the Lord and the Lord has rejected
[2:12:49] thee from being king over Israel a man
[2:12:55] and the says and Samuel came no more to
[2:12:59] see Saul on to the day of his death
[2:13:02] nevertheless Samuel mourn for Saul and
[2:13:06] the Lord repented that he had made Saul
[2:13:10] king over Israel and God rebuked not
[2:13:15] only saw but God rebukes Samuel and the
[2:13:21] Lord said unto Samuel how long wilt thou
[2:13:25] mourn for Saul
[2:13:27] seeing I have rejected him from reigning
[2:13:31] over Israel amen
[2:13:35] he said filled Einhorn with oil and go
[2:13:39] and I will send thee to Jesse the
[2:13:42] Bethlehem ight for ayah provided me a
[2:13:45] king among his sons amen so God had
[2:13:48] chosen another king over Israel he meant
[2:13:53] because of Saul's in complete obedience
[2:13:56] to the will of God amen brother grace to

[2:16:11] of God amen and it'll be the life of God
[2:16:17] in you amen and not just doctrine it'll
[2:16:21] be your attitude your
[2:16:22] your reactions what you do how you do it
[2:16:25] where you do it when you do it
[2:16:27] amen why is it oh well the world does it
[2:16:30] this way the world thinks this way the
[2:16:32] world they act this way but as a
[2:16:34] Christian you're totally different we're
[2:16:37] not of this world
[2:16:38] amen so how does at his believers in
[2:16:41] eternity act and think how does
[2:16:45] believers in eternity react God's grace
[2:16:50] to us brother again to repeat this just
[2:16:55] before we close we're in the end time
[2:17:03] and the Lord bless you richly and he
[2:17:07] said we're going to fade pretty quickly
[2:17:10] into eternity
[2:17:11] and if we're fading into eternity what
[2:17:14] kind of life are we live what kind of
[2:17:16] life will we live not what we to live
[2:17:19] you you'll have that anointing on you so
[2:17:21] you automatically live it a lot of MAG
[2:17:24] to come out so let's make sure we got
[2:17:26] our calling election sure there's more
[2:17:28] sure we got the anointing of the Holy
[2:17:30] Ghost in us with us and around us now he
[2:17:33] said God is sovereign and we see here
[2:17:37] David Dunne in the scripture he said
[2:17:39] according to 1st chronicles 13 but Dodd
[2:17:42] God does not give us merits on good
[2:17:46] intentions
[2:17:48] davus intention was good to bring the
[2:17:51] Ark of the Covenant back but he said God
[2:17:54] didn't bless him for that because he
[2:17:56] didn't do it according to the will of
[2:17:58] God no he didn't just amazing because it
[2:18:05] was supposed to be on the priests
[2:18:06] shoulders not on a cart oh but it was a
[2:18:12] new cart so there was nothing else on
[2:18:14] the cart yeah but again God said don't
[2:18:18] don't put the cart
[2:18:19] don't put the the Ark of the Covenant on
[2:18:21] a cart ring like that it was under on
[2:18:23] the shoulders of the priesthood and they
[2:18:25] would put it on their shoulders and walk
[2:18:26] with it
[2:18:27] amen a we think all we won't do that cuz
[2:18:30] don't be a burden to them no that was
[2:18:34] the will of God
[2:18:35] hey Matt grace of course you know what
[2:18:42] happened and that God stopped it
[2:18:44] and it went on for so many months but
[2:18:46] then they went back but this time the
[2:18:48] priesthood went back and got it
[2:18:50] amen see there's only one way to serve
[2:18:56] God and that's by doing his will at his
[2:18:59] command doing his will that's only one
[2:19:03] way to please God and to serve God and
[2:19:05] he said God being sovereign there's no
[2:19:08] one to tell him what to do or how to do
[2:19:11] it and there are believers that trying
[2:19:13] to tell God do this do this do this yeah
[2:19:15] they want God do this for them do this
[2:19:17] for they do this Lord know what's your
[2:19:21] will Lord whatever your will is I'll do
[2:19:24] it but we want to control God now they
[2:19:28] God control us and God being sovereign
[2:19:33] there's no one to tell them what to do
[2:19:35] or how to do it how does it eats and he
[2:19:40] knows the right way to do it and that
[2:19:42] makes me feel good it ought to make all
[2:19:46] of us feel good he said it sure does for
[2:19:49] one would have it coming in this way and
[2:19:51] one would have it going that way but he
[2:19:54] said one great thing again about God he
[2:19:56] has not left us now without knowing
[2:19:59] what's the truth and how to do it he
[2:20:02] wouldn't just be just to punish us for
[2:20:04] doing something that we didn't know how
[2:20:07] it was to going to be done and then let
[2:20:09] us stumble into something he's not that
[2:20:12] kind of a God he's a God that speaks a
[2:20:14] word and expects his children to believe
[2:20:17] it God spoke this word to saw Basalt did
[2:20:21] what was right in his own eyes God can
[2:20:24] speak his word to us and still we'll go
[2:20:26] out and do what's right in their own
[2:20:27] eyes no stay with the will of God and
[2:20:33] therefore he said he knows what's best
[2:20:35] and he knows when to do it he knows how
[2:20:40] to do it he said we have our ideas but
[2:20:44] he knows a man so god help us
[2:20:49] or brother-sister that we're not doing
[2:20:52] what's right in their own eyes and
[2:20:53] worship God in vain in vain do they
[2:20:57] worship Me teaching for doctrines the
[2:20:59] commandments of men so I trust our
[2:21:02] worship is not in vain that's what the
[2:21:04] prophet of God brings that out in that
[2:21:06] in this message he says you can worship
[2:21:09] in pain if you're not doing what's right
[2:21:12] in his eyes they're not doing it his way
[2:21:15] according to his will and so on amen
[2:21:19] so we we've got to do it God's Way and
[2:21:23] according to God's will and it's not
[2:21:25] according to God's will he said your
[2:21:26] worship is in vain
[2:21:29] think of that how many are worshiping in
[2:21:32] vain in vain do they worship Me teaching
[2:21:35] for doctrines the commandments of men
[2:21:38] much of that is going on around the
[2:21:40] message oh yeah most definitely and
[2:21:48] remember he said God regulates the
[2:21:50] church there predestinated the bride to
[2:21:55] meet the season that they are living in
[2:21:58] so God is regulating us by the word they
[2:22:01] meant so that we're going to do his will
[2:22:04] not our will amen well we think whether
[2:22:08] it's going to be acceptable in God's
[2:22:09] sight because it's based on based on the
[2:22:11] message is based no you've still got to
[2:22:14] find the will of God
[2:22:18] and that and to do that you had to be
[2:22:21] led by the spirit by the grace of
[2:22:24] Almighty God amen god help us is my
[2:22:27] prayer as we go further into the message
[2:22:29] on doing God a service without his will
[2:22:32] the bride wants to do it according DS
[2:22:36] will not my world not what I want not
[2:22:39] what I think not what I'm hungry nor
[2:22:41] thirsty for brother no when it comes to
[2:22:45] the natural things of life no we don't
[2:22:48] want that we want the will of God
[2:22:50] according to the Word of God by the
[2:22:53] grace of God amen god bless you Lestat
[2:23:00] praise the Lord a man named man and amen
[2:23:09] praise the Lord
[2:23:11] let's sing stand up stand up for Jesus
[2:23:13] return to our brother mark Amen god
[2:23:17] bless you spear prayer as we continue on
[2:23:20] with the message I'm doing God a service
[2:23:24] without his will
[2:23:25] let's find the will of God give that
[2:23:29] message we had a reason for preaching
[2:23:31] that oh yeah and he there's a reason for
[2:23:36] God to have it printed there's a reason
[2:23:38] for God to have it recorded oh yeah
[2:23:41] some brother the prophet of God said he
[2:23:43] said you know he said God invented God
[2:23:46] did it was the one that permitted the
[2:23:48] invention of the tapes why he did
[2:23:51] because it was around the time of the
[2:23:53] prophet of God coming on the scene that
[2:23:56] the tapes were invented those being reel
[2:23:58] to reels yeah because that's the ones
[2:24:01] that I listened to many many many of
[2:24:04] them
[2:24:04] oh my there was several hundred of those
[2:24:08] big reel-to-reel tapes of the message
[2:24:10] over that we would put on and listen to
[2:24:13] the prophet of God preached then it went
[2:24:15] from there to the cassettes you know
[2:24:17] then he went from there to the the CDs
[2:24:19] and so on and now let's get down to a
[2:24:22] little
[2:24:23] a little machine I'll tell you this the
[2:24:28] bright is for the bright it's not for
[2:24:30] the world as he said we want we won't be
[2:24:32] able to get the message to everyone only
[2:24:35] the bright but the gospel is gonna be
[2:24:37] preached to all the world that's right
[2:24:39] and I believe I believe right now we're
[2:24:41] near i I've wondered I prayed
[2:24:44] I've talked to the Lord about it concern
[2:24:46] you how much time do we have left how
[2:24:48] much time do we have left
[2:24:50] Lord according to the prophecy this has
[2:24:53] happened this has happened this is
[2:24:55] coming to part pass this prophecy is
[2:24:57] coming to pass
[2:24:58] Lord how much more time and what what
[2:25:02] else do we have to see it there I think
[2:25:04] it's got to be a little worse than what
[2:25:06] we've seen so it's gonna be a little bit
[2:25:09] longer how much I don't know but I'll
[2:25:12] will maybe minister on that sometime
[2:25:14] because the Lord has been dealing with
[2:25:15] me on him concerning how much time we
[2:25:18] got left we'll we'll see exactly what it
[2:25:21] what has come to pass what is coming to
[2:25:23] pass them all will come to pass
[2:25:25] according to the prophecy amen so god
[2:25:28] help us is my prayer amen
[2:25:31] soliciting it stand up stand up for
