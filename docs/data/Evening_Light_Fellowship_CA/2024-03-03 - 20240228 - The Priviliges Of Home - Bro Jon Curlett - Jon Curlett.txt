you'll walk the aisles Lord that you'll sit down in the pews Lord with each one that's gathered here Lord Lord from the pulpit all the way to the back door Lord that you'll just move in our hearts and lives Lord if we'll just sit and open up to you Lord that we'll just Lord allow your word to come in and touch Our Lives Lord it'll change us for the better Lord help us to Humble ourselves this morning Lord help us to receive this morning Lord let's not have ourselves so humble that we can't receive Lord that Satan would push us down and make us feel So Unworthy that we think it's not for us but Lord may we rise up into our position in Christ in Heavenly places Lord lay hold of the word that you've given Lord and say it's for me today Lord may we not put it off for another day for another person another age Lord but may we grab hold of what's given today Lord for it's yay and thus sayeth the Lord Lord would you touch us now this morning Lord each one bless us Lord because we came in Your Name Lord we're trusting in you this morning in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it amen amen amen God bless you this morning turn if you would to Isaiah 55 Isaiah 55 it's going to be back in church I talked with brother Nelson guy just a little bit yesterday and they discharged him from the hospital so he's finally headed home so we thank the Lord from that and he certainly appreciated all the visitors and brother Bob and Brother David and brother Joe brother Matt and maybe others went I don't know but each one and Blanc and I went in to see him on uh on Friday after we dropped sleen off at the airport and he said as soon as I said I was so happy to see you come through the door just you know it gets it's an interminable time right you're just sitting there and he's got not a whole lot to do and if his wife's not there not really anyone to talk to or anything like that so he appreciated each one that came through and I said tough thing with this is you know what's coming when they do the second knee I said but maybe they'll do it closer to home he says no he says I want to do it in here I said why CU he said out there I don't have you guys so he really really trusted and and and and and enjoyed and appreciated each one that came in so anden God bless you each one that took the time to do that and we want to remember Sister sister Betty as she goes for hip surgery this week as well amen it's an answer to prayer that she can get it just trusting that the Lord will guide the Physicians hands the surgeon's hands that she'll come out and she'll have a pain-free walking ability amen so let's keep her in prayer Amen brother josher appreciated that song service that was very very good this morning right in line with what we're going to speak on this morning amen Isaiah 55 amen what a beautiful scripture says Ho everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to the waters and he that have no money Come Ye buy and eat ye come by wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness jumping to verse 6 it says seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercies upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and I'm stepping away from our regular service this morning it's more of a followup I think from where we preached on Wednesday and I'm I'm going to just kind of take that and leverage it and take it from a bit of a different angle but if you remember we spoke last service on the believer's benefits amen what it means to be a child of God and the things that we have because we are children of God not because we lived an amazing life not because we're Sanctified not because we're perfect not because we do everything right but because we're a child of the king we have benefits amen and it's healing and it's all these different things that we talked about but uh I want to take a different angle this morning and just the Lord was dealing with me very strongly on this so uh just stay with me if you will and pull on the word and take what part is for you amen this morning and it's a good message it's it's the gospel amen the gospel's good news and if it's a little cutting at times it's still good news but I'm here to bring good good news this morning as well so I want to take a title this morning of the Privileges of Home amen the Privileges of of home and and I want to go back to Isaiah 55 the inspiration really for this service and verse one says this it says Ho everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to the waters in other words when you have a need there's something to satisfy it amen when you've got something in your life that's pulling for something there's something to respond to that pull there's something to meet that desire it says and he that had no money Come Ye and buy and eat you have no money but what you're going to get won't cost you any money you have to buy it there's something that you have to lay down there's something you have to pay but he says come buy wine and milk without money and without price so what's about to be given what's about to be set is free it's Priceless but it's freely given amen and that's the kind of God we serve that he can give us something Priceless for free and all you have to do is take it but when we jump to verse 6 it says seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near amen as long as the children of God are here as long as the bride is here there's Mercy amen we have preachers that we've heard perhaps or heard about that preach that there's no that he's not on The Mercy Seat anymore church if we're here there's got to be Blood On The Mercy Seat because we need it every single day amen we need a mediator we need an intercessor for when we fall for when we trip up for when the dirt this world gets on us amen but there's a time and a season for him to show Mercy there's a time and a season where the blood is still available for each one of us but time is running out and that's why he's saying take it while it's available because there's going to come a day where it's not available then he says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts our natural thoughts our natural way of thinking is unrighteous even as Believers come on now even as as Believers our natural ways are unrighteous I want you to grab that a hold of that this morning amen so they are not godly nor will our thoughts and our ways lead us to God to eternal life to anything that is of value in the kingdom of God it will not do it each one of us in our own we'll never bring ourselves to God or do anything for his good it says let him forsake his way the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord now I want you to catch who this is talking to because there's only one class of people that can return to the Lord those that were always with him amen it doesn't say turn to the Lord it says return to the Lord amen it's like the redeemed you already were deemed you were you were estimated you were established to be what a part of him only the redeemed can come back they they always were with them so only the child of God can return to God but he says turn back from where you've been going come back amen we left we were born we didn't realize that we were children children of God we're born and we don't have any idea but what happens is God comes our way by his word by a witness whatever it might be and he shines a light in our life and something in US responds and we realize that my home is not here my home is a Heavenly Home my father is not Lanny klet my father is Jesus Christ amen that we're responding to something else he says let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon though your sins be Scarlet they'll be white as snow amen doesn't matter how bad we are how far we go he will abundantly pardon it doesn't matter how far we've gone he's always got more grace and mercy than we have Sinn in Fault amen that's a wonderful place to find ourselves this morning but to catch this he says you've got to turn from your way and your thoughts why because my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way sayeth the Lord we've preached on this so many times but that's why we have to die out to our thoughts thoughts and take God's thoughts because God's thoughts became the word and that word has power amen our words don't become the word our words have to be the word that's the only time they have powers when we say his thoughts in his timing and in his season you want to know God's thoughts right here amen we don't have to have a special meeting we don't have to have a seance amen we don't have to go to to to some great person his thoughts are written here amen and it's so clear that a that that a man though a fool shall not a therein he makes it clear to his children amen he's not wanting to trip us up he's wanting to guide us exactly the way that we're supposed to go he says for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts so our thoughts will never match his they just can't go there we can't go that high we can't go that far we can't see that amen our hope is to return to him and him alone that's the only way we're going to get anywhere is that we come back to to him now we've spoken about the mindset of a Believer and we know that our mind is to be the mind of Christ and that means to take our thoughts and our wills and bring them subject to the word of God and when we bring them to subject to the word of God it filters out all of me it filters out all of you and what comes out is pure amen and that's what has effect in our lives that's when things can really take it take advantage of what God's got for us is when we bring ourselves wholly subject to him amen that's the goal for the Believers get ourselves out of the way we bring our thoughts captive we bring our imaginations captive we bring our dreams captive we bring our plans captive all these things we bring them captive to the word and we say Lord what is your will and his will is his word that's the easy way to see it amen God wants us to be subject because that is where our rest is going to be found amen for the believer this is our rest amen it's in Christ the word not just in the letter of the word but it's in the person of the word I was reading in there where brother Braham says that Christianity is not just the word he says you've got to meet the person of the word amen Christianity is not a Doctrine Christianity is a person and me life is a person and these different things but rest is found in knowing that you're in God's hands that's the only way you're going to find rest otherwise you'll just be churning and churning and churning and churning and working and working working and nothing's happening and you have no rest it sucks the life out of you you know I said something over the pulpit many times a former pastor of mine taught this and I firmly believe it he says God's love is based on spiritual growth as in what God wants for you is that your spirit would grow that your soul would grow above everything else amen that's what matters to God and so that's why he comes to redeem our souls because that's the portion that's Eternal potentially if you're a child of God your soul is eternal and the body is not Eternal in these different things but the soul is eternal and that's what he's most focused on and we read this last service in in third John where it says beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health so he said last service that's the thing that God wants most for us is that we would prosper and be in good health but he says even as your soul prospers what his love his Blessing is based on how our soul is doing and then everything else Falls in behind that when you're doing what God wants you to do when you're where God wants you to be when you're growing when you're maturing God can give you all sorts of blessings because you'll keep them in the right place amen and he wants to do those things and we know we don't preach a Prosperity Gospel here that God will give you anything you want and you just have to speak it and believe it and it'll come to have no no no that's not that's never been the gospel God did not promise a life of ease uh a big homes and fast cars and luxury vacations and and hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank quite the opposite in fact he said you're going to face Hard Times they're going to beat you they're going to put you out of the churches they're going to do all sorts of things to you amen but prosperity for the for the Christian is what when the soul flourishes amen when you're maturing in Christ that's what God's looking for and then outside of that everything else just kind of Falls away and God can add to it and God can take away and it doesn't change a bit who you are why because your soul is where it needs to be but everything we have need of brother BR would say everything we have need of is in us when God gives us the Holy Ghost when you have the new birth everything inside of you remember what he said he says you that God is like the ocean he says and you can you can't you can't take all of the ocean out he says but you take one little Spoonful one little cup full he says you have everything that's in that ocean in that cup he says and when he gives you the Holy Ghost you've got everything you need to secure you to your Eternal destination everything that's inside of us why because the holy spirit will Quicken the word the way God wants it quickened he'll make it live he'll make it produce he'll make it manifest in our lives and that's the rest of the people of God is that the word is coming through them it's producing itself now I want to focus on this one verse in Isaiah 55 and I skipped it earlier and it's for a reason because I wanted to read it now he says wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not in other words why are you working for something that's not going to satisfy you hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness and today we look at fatness and we look at it as an unhealthy thing but in the scripture fatness means Health the wealthy men were fat he says you'll be fat it's supposed to mean that you have more food than you have need of he says let your soul Delight in what I'm about to tell you let your B let your spirit let your Soul let the Eternal part of you just just take hold of this and he says this is soul food now we don't know much about soul food up here in Newan land do we I had to look it up because I've lived in the South soul food is food that just satisfies you and it's familiar to you and it just feels like home now in the South I'm going to read these off I don't know what half of these things are I know fried chicken ham Hawks chitlins no idea collar greens blackeyed peas fried okra this is soul food down south cornbread and grits hush puppies no idea sweet potato pie why would you put a sweet potato in a pie I don't know but to them it's Soul Food banana pudding and red velvet cake now all the new finlanders are saying what in the world and me too what's our soulle food for a new finlander maybe jigs dinner you know salt beef Cod tongs bake apple jam Tans something like that right it just tastes like home everyone's licking their lips now right what God's saying is what I'm about to tell you ought to feel like soul food to you it ought to satisfy your soul it ought to make you feel right at home it ought to make you comfortable it ought to make you just feel like everything's okay that's what he told us in Isaiah 52 you know the prophet of God would say that every person in this world has a void in their life that's meant for God and what he says here in Isaiah is how you get to F that void because he says what happens is we take it and we feel an emptiness and so do we do we try and fill it with stuff we try to fill it with careers we try and fill it with wi with wi with a a spouse or a partner of some sort we fill it with alcohol we fill it with drugs we fill it with party we fill it with fast cars we fill it with just things and what happens is we're trying to scratch the itch and the itch never goes away cuz only God can satisfy the itch that's inside of every one of us and what happens people have everything I've known so many people like this church and they have the biggest home they have multiple beautiful cars they have money in the bank they have all these things and they feel empty they feel alone they feel depressed they feel purposeless unfulfilled why cuz they're seeking to satisfy a spiritual hunger with a natural answer and it just never works and many and so what happens is they keep pushing further and further and further and it destroys their life it destroys their marriage it destroys their career whatever it might be because they're not trying to satisfy it with the thing that's supposed to satisfy it but God has a way to scratch our itch man God has a way to satisfy things and we'll walk through some examples this morning but I want to show you one thing that God gives us because we're speaking this morning on the Privileges of Home second Timothy he said for God had not given us the spirit of fear God had not given us the spirit of fear so when you feel fear it's not God Drawing Near You right that's your natural instinct kicking in but that's not the way that God works he says but God has given us a spirit of power of love and of a sound mind power that what you can make it through that there's a God there's a father that's working on your behalf amen of love that whatever you're going through God's love is still there and it may even be God's love that's taking you there and then a spirit of a sound mind the amplifying says this for God did not give us a spirit of timidity of cowardice of Craven cringing and fawning fear brother Joe was sharing this morning that brother Ron Spencer many of you know what he's been going through for four and a half years almost with stage four cancer and he has lived and they thought he would die within the first 6 months he's a miracle walking and they're putting hundreds of thousands millions of dollars of treatment into him and then he had they they said that he had cancer in both of his eyes and so they went up and they they prayed over him and then his wife was sharing how they went to the doctor and they said yes it's cancer and they met a woman in the hospital and brother Ron talked to her and she had an eye patch over ey says oh what's the problem she says I had cancer in my eyes and so they had to take it out and what did it do it it just knocked the faith out from underneath them what was it Satan was trying to bring in fear but then they go up and they go to the best doctor the the Opthalmology oncologists and he looks at it and he says you don't have cancer he says you have two little lesions on both of your eyes no cancer praise the Lord but Satan's in there trying to set them up for fear right but they've already had the prayer of faith prayed and that's supposed to what bring love and power and a sound mind man we don't have to cringe we don't have to pull back from anything that comes in our life when we are standing on the word of God when we're in our position and in our place he says he has not given us a spirit of timidity but he has given us a spirit of power and of love and of calm and well balanced mind and discipline and self-control so other times when times get tough when things get tense when the pressure comes down God has given us a reaction that is not natural he's given us a reaction that is Supernatural amen it's a power and a love and a control why mind why because it's the holy spirit in us saying stand still and see the salvation of the Lord You're where I want you to be you're doing what I want you to do you've held fast to my word you're following along in the way that I've told you to go don't worry about it stand still and react the right way trust me amen why because we know who our father is we know who our God is we know where we come from but I want to take down a road this morning of what happens when we get away from home and what happens when we are at home and two different angles to take from it and you probably know where I'm going this morning and in Luke 15 this is the the parable of the prodical son that Jesus would talk about he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living you're not supposed to get your inheritance while your father's alive but this son says Dad give me my half that I'm going to get he he says and not many days after the young man gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance that young man had a lot of things going for him and yet he comes to his dad he has all these gifts he has all of this provision he has everything he has need of but he says Dad give me what belongs to me what's going to belong to me and I'm going to leave you he valued what what his dad had more than he valued his dad he valued the stuff he valued the blessings over the relationship and so he goes out and the scripture says that he went out and he spent it all on riotous living I found it's easy to spend somebody else's money look at our government amen but when you give somebody something that they don't earn you'll find they never treat it the way they did if they did the hard work for it sometimes with our kids you know we'll say you know I I'm giving my kids everything I never had we got to be real careful with that there's a reason why we didn't have certain things and it's not because they couldn't afford it it's because it wasn't for our good to give them all those things amen when we give our kids something you'll find that they treat it very poorly often times but if they work for it if they earn it they value it a whole lot more because they know the Blood Sweat and Tears that went into it the greatest thing we can give our kids is character to work to put in real effort and get real success rather than just give them the things they want but you look at this boy and he's been taught right he's been taught right he's been taught to work hard he's been taught to do to to be faithful in the family business and I don't know what happened to him we don't know what happened to him it doesn't say but I imagine like Eve he got seduced by somebody that said there's more out there than there is in here it's better out there than it is in here and if you can get what's coming to you you can go out there and you can live such a better life than if you stayed home with the father somebody pulled him away somebody bent his ear something seduced him to pull him away from where he was supposed to be verse 14 says and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in want isn't that when things start to clarify for us when needs start to hit when wants start to hit that word want in the scripture means need so what happened is he started to have a lack where he used to have an abundance and he starts to sit back and he starts to take a a hard look at his finances he starts to take a hard look at his life and he says this ain't good and it ought to have brought him to a place of clarity to let him know where his place of blessing was which was the father's house but instead he goes a different route if he had stayed where he was supposed to be he would never have experienced the need that he had cuz in the father's house the famine wasn't hitting him they had already prepared for it in the father's house they had plenty of food in the father's house they had everything that young that young man had need of but now he's outside the father's house and his mind doesn't go to I should go back to Dad he tries to take matters into his own hands amen he got away from his privileges as a son because he walked away from his position as a son that's what we're talking about this morning if you walk away from your position you can't have the Privileges you've got to come back to your position and then he walked away from provision and tried to manage it and all of a sudden he found he didn't have what he used to have and he had no way of getting it he'd practically forgotten how to work we look at verse 15 and it says he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country he didn't join himself to somebody of his country people that belied the way he did people that lived the way he lived he went and he found another unbeliever and he attached himself to him and he put his life in that unbelievers hands and that man didn't live like he lived that man didn't believe like he lived it says and he sent him into his fields to feed swine it's all he was good for was feeding pigs when it was all sudden down he was a broken man he was a broken young man and all he was good for was taking food to the pigs now verse 16 says and he feain would have filled his belly with the husk that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him I've read that so many times and never grasped what it meant and that's why I put the Amplified there it says he longed to eat his fill from the pods that the pigs were eating but no one would give him anything see if you look at the children's books they always show him eating the pig's food but here it says they wouldn't give him pigs food what was it he was so hungry he longed to eat pigs food you know what this pigs food was carob [Music] pods that was looking like steak and fries to him he got to a place where pig food had his mouth watering and all he wanted was to eat pig food and they wouldn't even let him eat pig food Church as a young man what was he raised on good homecooked everything he had need of that's what ought to have satisfied him but now he's about to try and eat pig food and that's his satisfaction as eating pig food how far had he fallen from his privileges of being a son at home amen he's hungering for something that's only fit for pigs and very strange vegans perhaps this is what he's hungering for this is the only satisfaction he has now is pig food what a place to find ourselves when you're salivating for something that's not fit for human consumption isn't that what the world does and yet even under those conditions they wouldn't even give him that that shows how much they valued their pigs over him Church the world will chew you up and spit you out they don't care about you they don't care about your family they don't care whether you get a job or not they don't care whether you make it all they care about is can I make money off of you that's all they want what ises it do it sucks our peace out the world will suck our rest out it'll suck our satisfaction it'll take our sanity take our innocence and just gone and how many times have we seen it I remember back in Evon there was a young lady left the church and within a year and a half she had a baby out of wet lock why Satan just took her innocence had his time with her and then moved on what a shame for that young lady she got out from under the Privileges of home what does the world do it creates hungers there's a reason why we ought not to have TVs in our home hooked up to TV the ads that they give what does it do it's trying to create a hunger in you that cannot be satisfied cuz you'll buy one thing and then you'll want the next thing and then you want the next thing and then you want the next thing and all they're doing is they're trying to stir up something inside of us so that they can make money off of us that's what's happening this young man has all these hungers and all these thirsts and no one can satisfy it nobody's willing to do it because they're in self-preservation mode themselves they're in moneymaking Mode God doesn't work that way scripture says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever would believe in him would not perish but have everlasting life God gives and gives and gives and gives and we trample on his grace and what does he do gives us more grace we trample on his Mercy he gives us more Mercy we mess up and we mess up and we mess up and we mess up and what is it he's got an abundant Mercy that just keeps giving back and back and back but there's going to be a day where he stops amen there's got to be a day where he stops but so often what happens is what we do we go our own way try to resolve issues in our life try and make things happen try and make things develop what is it Church we've got spiritual Amnesia we've forgotten who our father is we've forgotten who provides who blesses who gives Health all of these things he provides everything for us he's our Je Gyra and what do we do we get there and we grind and we grind and we grind and we grind because we think our work is going to make it happen that's not the way it works for a for a Christian we don't have to do that we need to work hard we ought to be the best employees wherever we are absolutely I'm not saying that but our blessing is not in the fact that we worked hard our blessings in the fact that God blesses us amen that's where our rest is listen to this the people forget who they are you're not just an ordinary person you're a Christian he says you are Sons and Daughters of God by the grace of God why should you be in the condition you're in why should you be doubting and have frustrations you look at where the prodal son is his his actions his decisions he loses it all and then he comes up with his way of saving himself and even that was only an illusion it was anill illusion of survival it was an illusion of satisfaction it was an illusion that he was going to make it because what he figures if I work for them they're going to take care of me and they didn't they used him and he says I'm about to die of hunger everything we do is just an illusion if we do it on our own if you sow on your own you'll reap on your own if I'm just stuck with what I can do I can only reap what I can do but you'll find with God what happens is that he comes behind when we can go with his way and what does he do he magnifies what we do and He blesses it and all of a sudden it produces way more than we put in why because we're in his path we're in his plan we're in his way but this young man what does he do he falls on his own devices he falls on his own ways and all it leaves him is is high and dry broke down hungry nearly dead why he wasn't built to survive in that Kingdom we're not built to survive to thrive in Satan's Eden we're built to thrive in this kingdom of God amen and then when we get there then Satan's kingdom has no effect on us and Satan will try and throw things at us and he'll try and push things on us he'll try and put us in panic mode and emergency this and that and we're just sitting back and we're resting because we're exactly where we're supposed to be and we know that no weapon that's formed against us can prosper amen the kingdom of God is our happy place that's what it ought to be amen but this young man he comes to a place it says and when he came to himself so he began to be being want and he he devised a plan to save himself to make it all work out and then when that didn't work out it says he came to himself in other words his mind finally started to operate properly he says and he said how many hired Servants of my father's have bred enough and to spare and I perish with Hunger he said you don't even have to be a son in my father's house if you're just a servant they've got food and then some there's always more than enough in my father's house he says and I'm sitting here and I'm about to die of hunger there's a problem with this situation he says that's what the church needs to do today is come to themselves and realize who your who is your father for sometimes we act though we have no Heaven as though we have no heavenly father now listen to what this looks like he says for all the goodness of Heaven belongs to the church Divine Healing salvation freedom from worry or anything it all belongs to the church Jesus died and we inherit all that God has through him I'm here to tell you this morning you don't have to live in worry you don't have to live in fear you don't have to live in stress you don't have to live in doubt you don't have to feel in feel like you're worthless you don't have to feel like you can't make it you don't have to worry about what's going to happen tomorrow you don't have to live that way you don't have to live a defeated life you don't have to be worried for what's coming around the corner you don't have to do it you don't have to do it he's saying you have everything that Christ died for available to you he says and then what happens is we forget who we are and we forget that we're children of God Amen and because you're a child of God because you're a child of the king he knows what we have need of and he's promised to provide for us amen God knows where we're at God knows what's going on God can see ahead he's already seen it all it's a finished work in his eyes God's not taken by surprise and we sit there and worry about what's going to happen that's not the place of the believer amen we don't want to get to the end of this world and forgive the Bal people that are here we don't want to get to the end of this world and the end of this life and all of our hair is torn out and we're balbed because we're so stressed and we're overweight from stress eating and we're frazzled and our mind's broken because we've been burning our candle at both ends all the time what is it trying to do it ours trying to do it ourself we don't have to walk through life feeling complete overwhelmed no we don't we've got a lot of work Brothers it's a long day at work these days because it's not just work anymore but it is a constant bombardment on the Son of God to try and get him to turn his head to do things he ought not to do to get sucked into things to get into the worry you can't go into a workplace where they won't talk about politics I went to renew Jonathan's phone plan and I ended up spending 15 minutes listening to a guy tell me how everything broken and the only comfort that we have is that we're not as bad as the US and I beg to differ but I didn't have time and I don't have brain space for it how many times have I said every time I turn on the news going into to work I regret it just need to stop doing it why because it's not feeding the kingdom of God that is within me amen we don't have to approach everything in life with a Haggard down at the mouth attitude what what's the next thing that's going to hit me it's not where we have to be God has a provided way for us listen to what Jesus said he says therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith shall we be clothed this is our worry so many times isn't it where's the next dollar going to come from how are we going to make it to the end of the month we always get to the end of the month and there's more bills than there is money how are we going to make it how are we going to do it we're all almost all all here single- inome families money is a big deal it's hard Jesus said don't think about those things he says for after all these things do the Gentile sck seek we sure do he says for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things he knows that we're living here and we have needs he says but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness that's our part seek God God first he says and all these things shall be added unto you so if you want to worry about something worry about being right with God if you want to focus on something if you want to put effort in put it on being right with God and everything else will follow right behind in its place in per in Perfection amen he says take therefore no thought for the morrow don't worry about tomorrow don't do it you don't have to do it as a Son of God as a daughter of God he says for the moral shall take thought for the things of itself when you get tomorrow deal with tomorrow but you're in today let's work with today he says sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof you know what happens as we borrow from tomorrow's evil and we pull it into today you know what we don't do borrow from tomorrow's good and bring it into today cuz Satan's trying to bring the bad The Bad The the worrisome the awful the trouble all of this stuff and bring it in trying to over load us and break us Jesus said don't do that take each day as it comes now listen we're talking a bit about spiritual Amnesia this morning he says now this Amnesia he's talking naturally we're told causes you to be to a place where you cannot identify yourself he says it's an unusual thing it doesn't happen too often but the cause is from shock it's somebody that doesn't even know who they are you find it from war sometimes and soldiers get it sometimes people get it he says another thing that causes it is worry he's speaking naturally but I'm speaking Also spiritually this morning worry will cause it worry has no virtue to it at all there's no strength in worry he says yeah just skip worry and accept Faith worry has no virtue to it at all but faith has all virtue he says believe so worry is a sign of spiritual Amnesia that you've forgotten who you are you've forgotten who your father is you've forgotten what's available to you and you're dwelling on the problem rather than dwelling on the position amen that you are a son of God that you are a daughter of God you have things in your life and You' got to say but I'm a Son of God but I'm a daughter of God that doesn't mean that the issue will go away but it'll change your attitude as you go through the issue what happens here is worry causes us to put God second because it's doubt doubt and doubt is the opposite of faith and so it brings worry and it brings fear and worry takes us out of our position as a child of God and brings us into Satan's kingdom now friend this may seem a bit of a weird Direction this morning but a friend of our shared this the other day we're talking about what worry can do to us this is what what they shared they said church should be your excuse for missing something else now I'm not one for memes and pack quotes and I'm preaching to the choir CU you're here this morning but let me tell you Satan will try and get you to make bricks without straw right he'll try and get you to work your way to blessing rather than trusting God to blessing he'll try and get you to work your way to your grades work your way to your career work your way to whatever you're trying to do and what God will go second and he won't say put God second he'll say put this first it's implied that god's second but he won't remind you of that I thought this was great church should be your excuse for missing something else you know when we lived up in in near brother Matt When We Were Young we moved there and there was a ton of young young guys around there and so you know we kind of went exploring on our bikes and you know we were playing hockey out on the street so they said well come play hockey with us well we went up and we absolutely trashed them Matt and Adam came over and and Nate was with me of course and and and the fearful four we just destroyed them in hockey they said let's play some baseball we beat them 20 to nothing in four Innings four people they said let's play again we beat them 20 to one so they were in awe of the Fearsome four but you know what happened was Wednesday we're out playing basketball and we say we're in the middle of a game we said we got to go they said why we got to go to church go to church yeah we go to church oh you're weird and they started calling us Church boys but we'd thrashed them in whatever sport we played and So eventually I started saying you guys need to come to church so you can get good at sports but they called us Church boys because what church was a priority my mom made it a priority to go to church we didn't get to stay home from church cuz we wanted to play basketball or hockey and believe me we wanted to stay home from church and play basketball or hockey no we weren't allowed to she made it a priority and Satan what he does is he tries to raise emergencies he tries to to raise worries and fears to make us think that we can miss out on a place where God has guaranteed to bless us if I told you you can go somewhere and God will bless you today what could hold you back if you truly believe me and yet we we said it this morning even in our prayer where two or three are gathered in my name there will I Christ the word be in the midst of you and what do we do we don't go to church it's the silliest thing it's one of the greatest promises where he promised to meet personally with the individual in that building and yet we won't do it what does he do he tells us we're not going to have enough money we're not going to have enough time we're not going to have good enough grades we're going to go on and on and on and blah blah blah blah blah and he fills our minds with what ifs and what is it it's vain imagination absolutely church you can tell me I don't know what I'm talking about Blanca knows we had no money when I was going to school and we always made it through I never missed a service for studying exams and you can say brother John you are smarter you're smarter than everyone else no I got C's I got D's sometimes I also got A's I know some of you are thinking C's that' be wonderful but I started here and I went down and then I came back up again but you know what church my grades never got me a job right my School attendance never got me any stickers that the employers checked but I'll tell you what I put God first and he never failed me amen you know Blanca was talking with Jonathan a while back because he's a young man and he's got aspirations and he's looking at things and she said look at your dad and what he's done because as soon as I went into the workforce I said I work 40 hours a week why because I have a wife and I have a family and they need me I don't work weekends I definitely don't work Sundays and I definitely don't work Wednesday nights I work 40 hours a week and church I've done this is not for me this is for you all the way into the executive ranks the last job I had before I came here I told the president clearly I was working right next to him his right-and man I said I work 40 hours a week if you're looking for somebody to punch a clock to put in a bunch of hours it ain't me I said I'll do in 40 hours what others can do in 60 but I'm not working hours just to make it look like I'm working hard I says I'll get the job done and he hired me but I did that from the from the lowliest engineering position and intern position all the way through why because if I put it out there that God's first in my life the things that matter to God are matter they matter to me then it sets a standard that I can hold to the rest of my life and it gets easier and easier and easier amen my rest was not that my great grades were going to get me a grade get me a job my rest was that God would lead me to the job I would need my first job wasn't great but it was a stepping stone to a much better job which was phenomenal which was to a better one and to a better one and God grows us and he matures us and he takes us through these things but Satan will say no you've got to be perfect believe me I like getting A's and I'm generally capable of getting A's but I'm willing to sacrifice an a if I can be in the house of God I'm willing to get an to sacrifice an a to know that he's with me all the way and I've done what he asked and now I can trust him to do what he promised which was to provide for me amen amen look at this not forsaking the assembly of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and allthe less as you see the day approaching all the more the day is the day of the Lord it's when it's all said and done he says the closer we get to that the more we ought to be getting together amen don't stay home if God is in your heart you can hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers he says if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you get to praying remember the scripture says in Ephesians 4 that he's got a five-fold Ministry it's for three things it's for the maturing of the Saints the perfecting of the Saints it's for the edifying of the church and to bring us into the unity of the faith you can't get that at home it says assemble yourself together see we say well I heard the word no no no it says assemble yourself together for the hearing of the word amen that's the way it works I'm not saying you can't get blessed by streaming I'm not saying you can't get blessed by being at home but one we miss out on you and you miss out on us on being in the presence of God right here you bring your lick of fire we bring our lick of fire we have an atmosphere we can have a Revival here amen but this young man this prodical son he got so caught up in things and in the end he came to the place where it wasn't working it was either go home or die and he was smart enough to say I'm going to go home' he Saidi will arise and go to my father and I will say unto him father I've sinned against heaven and before thee we got to come to God the right way if we've left we've got to come back with a repentant attitude always repentance is a start he says now I am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants now let me stop here repentance is good knowing you're unworthy is good but Satan will take that and he'll drive you into the ground far below where you're supposed to be you're supposed to humble yourself to God not take yourself completely out of God's economy that's a false humbling that's a satanic humbling that'll do that amen our current situation our current attitude our our our current uh problems don't change who we are we are always children of God if we always were we always will be nothing will change that but we come when we say Lord I'm sorry Lord I've stepped out on my own Lord I've tried to make it happen on my own but I'm coming back to where you are cuz he's always waiting where we left him we preached on this many times scripture says in 1 John it says if we confess our sins see we look at sins as actions sin is unbelief where you don't believe what God has said and therefore you don't do what God has said but we focus on the doing and we forget about the unbelieving part amen that's the root of it Eve did it and we've been doing it ever since he says if we confess our unbelief he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness we covered all a lot last service all unrighteousness he'll forgive all of it he'll cleanse us from all of it he says we have so many things but thou just know our heart and know everything that we have need of we're so glad that we can bring it to you in prayer knowing that you understand and will give to us of thy goodness not that we are worthy of it but because thou Hast promised it to us don't let our unworthiness hold us back because we're always unworthy amen but he makes us worthy we're worthy in the Beloved the scripture says he says our heavenly father we the prodal from the kingdom straight away many of us dear father are not fit to be called your children you could just make us your hired servants but you don't want us to be your servants see we'll say well I'll do anything I'll be anything he says I didn't call you to be anything I called you to be Sons and Daughters of God so it's great that you're willing to but don't this isn't about what you want or it's not what you think he says you want us to be your son and daughter to have the Privileges of home this is where our title came from he says to go to the ice box when we know we're home when we're hungry and go eat and when we're tired to find rest it was wonderful when brother Andrew DOD and his wife were here when they started going to the fridge and finding their own food because it meant that they felt at home they knew that there were something in there to satisfy hunger or thirst and so they just started going and doing it that's the goal when you have guests is to make them feel at home and it was wonderful when they started doing that amen where we can go and we realize there's something available for us and all I have to do is go home to get it all I have to do is go home to get it so what did this young man do it says and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him brother John Andes preached on this when he was here the father is not waiting to beat him silly he doesn't need to that young man has learned his lesson he's coming home broken and tired and weary and hungry completely wrecked by his own decisions he knows he did wrong the father just says I'm glad to have you back God's waiting and he just wants his sons and his daughters back to him that's all he wants amen he wants to forgive us he wants to heal us he wants to change us more than we wanted and all he's waiting is for us to come to him amen even when we look at where we were before we ever came to this word before we ever came to Christ we couldn't go to him and he came to us but once he's brought us to him he expects us to stay with him and that's a decision we make day in and day out is I will stay with him or I will go my own way and I'll try it with my own strength and attitude watch the son he said to unto him father I've sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son do we disagree he he made his father a laughing stock he valued what his father had over who his father was all of these things and he comes back and he's feeling unworthy Church your feelings don't matter in this situation it's good you ought to be repentant you ought to be sorry if you've stepped out I ought to be the same thing but in this situation the sons feelings have no play they don't matter at all what matters is what the father thinks and we see what the father does it says the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet you come and you say father I'm weak he says no you're strong father I'm poor he says no you're rich father I'm unworthy no you're worthy that's what I'll hold on to cuz his thoughts are higher than my thoughts his ways are higher than my ways Hallelujah that I come in and I don't know Lord why do you keep allowing this Lord why do you keep forgiving me Lord I frustrate you it's got to frustrate you and now what does he do he wraps the robe of the Holy Ghost around me and puts the ring of unmerited grace and favor on me time and time again we can't wear him out church we can't wear him out neither can those that aren't here this morning that maybe ought to be and we're praying for them and we're believing for them they can't wear out UNM merited favor that's what Grace is you don't deserve it that's why it works as well as it does you don't deserve it I don't deserve it but time and time again we come back and we say I'm not worthy he says it doesn't matter he says and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he is lost and is found says and they began to be merry all that he cares is that we're back in the father's home all God cares about is when you're back home when you're living under the umbrella of the protection of his word all he cares about is that you're taking him at his word and everything else doesn't matter we have scars by our own actions so many times it doesn't bother him the messes we make it doesn't bother him if we'll only come back to him you know we look at this story the prodical son and we so often we focus on those that have left that on those that have never come to Christ or those that have come and then gone away they fall under the influence of others and maybe like we said they go into alcohol or drugs or common law relationships whatever it might be and that's true those are certainly prodal but how often do we become manyi prodical amen I'm not preaching to those that aren't here I'm preaching to those that are here this morning myself included anden how often are we many prodical in other words we leave God presence to try and do it on our own by our own actions by our own skills by our own efforts and we separate ourselves from what he said and what he promised and what he said he would provide and we walk the road alone and what are the symptoms worry fear doubt unrest stress sickness depression frustration bitterness why cuz we're giving it everything we've got and ain't nothing happening amen been there done that got the T-shirt you're doing everything and you've left him behind if you would do the exact same thing with him by your side everything would change everything would change where does it come from someone or something has convinced us that by our efforts we're going to get something done it's like I said before we can get something done what we do is we reap what we sow but the problem is when we reap to the flesh we reap destruction because if I burn myself out in this flesh yes I can get more but my flesh pays a price but you can work and put in the same effort and if God's in it he'll double what you got out he'll magnify what you put out you'll put in less brother Joe I've talked to him about this he doesn't mind me sharing he came to the place where he said I've got to work Less hours and so he did he did and guess what business didn't fall off did it brother Joe no he's a multi multi multi multi-millionaire now because of this no he's not but has the cruise of oil run dry brother Joel amen right church I can give you example after example after example in my own life where you commit a thing to God and he provides and sometimes we're saying we need the $100,000 and what you need is a lesser lifestyle that he can provide for you amen we've got people in this church make a lot of money and we got people in this church that don't make a lot of money but you know what we've never seen the righteous forsaken nor see big and bread but what we do see is people destroy themselves trying to make it happen themselves rather than relying on God to bring it out I made $34,000 a year in my first job as an engineer like a a secretary makes that today and it was tough it was tough it was tough we lived in a tiny apartment we had nothing like at the end of the month you'd have like $50 $60 left but God blessed us in it and and he provided and then the next job he doubled my salary then he put 50% on top of that and then he put 50% on top of that what is it God provides he's got a way of doing it but he's got to grow us as he's going through all of these things am man our promise is that we're blessed because we trust in him we look in Jeremiah 17 before we do that we look at the prodal and say well he left look at Naomi in the scriptures in the Book of Ruth what happened things got tough now Church in Israel God gave him a promise remember he says if you'll stay in the land of Israel and you'll live according to my law then he would bless them he provide for them with food and shelter he he give them victory over their enemies he give them Health he' give them lots of children he says if you stay there and you live the way you're supposed to I'll bless you and all of a sudden famine comes to Israel why does famine come to Israel because they're not living the way they ought to and so what did Naomi do instead of changing her actions she changes her location the answer is not to change the location and what happens is she goes out and she loses everything that she held valuable and when they come back they say nail me's back she says don't call me nail me call me Mara bitter she came back and the only thing she had to reap from her decision to not change the way she's living is bitterness Naomi was a prodal and when she came home and she stepped in we find in the end that she's come back to her place of trusting God because now by the end she's getting Ruth into the place where Ruth will trust God and she's encouraging Ruth Ruth don't worry about it he said he's going to do it he'll do it if she'd have only had that Faith before she left Israel she wouldn't have been in the position she was in she came back with scars but she was always a daughter of God and God met her when she came back and she stayed in under the promise if you're reaping bitterness God's not in the decision can't be Jeremiah 17 says this thus sayeth the Lord I said there was thus sayith the Lord in the service this morning here it is cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the Lord in other words you're a prodical son because you trust in yourself he says for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see when good comes so when Good Times come you don't get to enjoy it he says but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited if you've ever seen pictures of the the Great Salt uh seas and these things nothing grows there salt destroys everything so in other words he says if you trust in yourself you're going to be parched thirsty no Fellowship no relationship no growth you're going to be alone and dried out you can't even grow you can't produce fruit this is what a prodal looks like that's a son or daughter of God he said blessed is the man that that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is so you trust in God and you say my hope is in you not in this he says for he shall be as a tree planted By the Waters that spreadeth out her Roots by the river and shall not see when he cometh notice it doesn't say that the hot times aren't going to come doesn't mean that the droughts aren't going to come doesn't mean that difficult times don't come but what it says there is that you won't feel it it won't take effect on you it won't keep you from producing the fruit of the spirit it won't keep you from having joy and peace and rest in your life why CU you're planted by rivers of Living Water that's why we come to church it's flowing water all the time but not just in church that's why we have our devotions it's why we read our Bible it's why we pray it's fresh flowing water day in and day out to keep us producing life so he says he shall not see when he cometh but her leaves shall be green he says and shall not be careful in the year the drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit so in other words when things get tight you don't have to hold back well I better not produce any fruit today because I don't have enough water to go around no we've always got water we don't have to worry about the supply and so we're always pushing out what we're supposed to do how we're staying where God placed us under the hearing and feeding of the word of God and it causes a blessing to come out of us you can't hold it back you put a tree around water it's going to produce no matter what it can't stop stop amen can't help but it's God that's providing us why because he's planted us that means he's chosen us to be at a particular place at a particular time for a particular season and he plants us and we can rest in his planting as long as it was his planting amen if I don't have faith that I'm supposed to be here behind this Pulpit nothing good will come out of it because whatsoever is not a faith is sin unbelief and it'll bleed through and it spread throughout the church I've got to believe I'm supposed to be here you've got to believe you're supposed to be here you got to be you're supposed to be in the job you're in and the school you're in and the place you're in whatever it might be you've got to believe that you know we look at Samson Samson was perhaps one of the greatest prodal of the the Bible and you know the interesting with Samuel is that we see a lot of his victories but those victories are all in a really short period of time and we see that most of Samson's life was really good he was actually a really good young man now he was a handful as a young man we know that he had a problem with women he had a problem with sensuality and he went out and he he found a woman amongst the Philistines and he got his parents to go and get her for wife and then the Philistines played a trick on them and used her against them and in the end they gave her to another man and these different things and you know that caused problems he went out and he burnt their fields down and all these different things killed a bunch of Philistines to give them the clothes that they want in the BET and then they came for him and they the Israelites said well we got to give you up otherwise they're going to kill us and so they take him out in the desert and then the spirit of the Lord comes on him and he breaks the Bindings that are on him picks up a dry jaw bone of a donkey and he kills a th Philistines praise the Lord what a victory and then after that things are quiet and this is all the Bible says he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines 20 years so he went 20 years where he was tight with God he was disciplined he was under the umbrella of the word he was doing the right thing he was holding fast to the word of God 20 years and this is the majority of Samson's life as far as we know Troublesome youth then he comes into maturity and then what happens all of a sudden is he just leaves and we have no idea how he got there but he leaves and he goes to Gaza that's the Philistine Capital City what's he doing in philistia that's the enemies that's that's the tormentors that's the place uh the center of power for the people that give them so many problems and then after that he goes and he finds a woman named Delilah in the valley of sork and I've told this before that the the valley of sork is right on the border of philistia Israel what was Samson doing looking into the enemy's land we have no right to be out there looking at what this world offers to be tempted by what makes them tick that's not our food that's not our drink it's not something that's going to give us anything good but he started looking at the way they were and it rekindled something he thought had died amen he had trouble with women he buried that by staying in Israel where the women were modest and all these different things all of a sudden one day he decides he's going to go for a walk and he gets close to the edge and what does he see he sees a beautiful woman and it rekindles these desires that he thought he'd lost all this time what did he see he saw something he thought was better than what he had at home in the land of Israel you know if you want a role model pick someone here we look and if you look at the world and you want to make money don't look at somebody out in the world to make money cuz you don't see the price they paid to make that money you don't see it you want the lifestyle they have you don't see the price they pay I remember a friend of mine in in Texas was a doctor very very successful very very wealthy uh you know he had a Porsche he had a McLaren he had a Ferrari he had a race car he had a massive massive house I went into his house one time you know what was on the side table right at the entry pill bottle after pill bottle after pill bottle after pill bottle after pill bottle to treat depression all these things has it all on the outside looks great and yet no satisfaction lost his wife eventually remarried made a mess of things still successful but the price he paid was huge you see somebody in this church that's successful say how did you do it if I've had any success I've told you my success put God first all the way all the way unequivocally don't move from it that'll bring you as much success as you have character to handle that's it I don't I don't want to make $400,000 a year if I don't have character to handle 400 Grand a year I don't want to be someplace where I can't handle it if I can stick with what God wants from me I'll be exactly where I need to be first John says this for all that is in the world there's another all everything that's in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world the amplifi says for all that's in the world the lust of the flesh the craving for sensual gratification the lust of the eyes which is greedy longings of the mind and the pride of life the Assurance in one's own resources or in the stability of Earthly things these do not come from the father but are from the world itself see how it says that Assurance in one's own resources money in the bank got a great job great education great prospects that's not our assurance my hope is in the Lord amen every time cuz it can go like that hey I've been in in in businesses where you're doing phenomenally when I worked in Edmonton I worked for a company we grew their sales 25% through the work that myself and my team did millions and millions of dollar dollars and in the end when things took a downturn you know what they did cut me like that they weren't in it for me and that's the thing is we'll get so built up and think that we've secured ourselves a position no it's God that gives God that takes away and man it's God that holds us when I was I talk to people you know about tithing they say how can you do it I say how can I not how can I not I've seen the blessing of it give 10% of your money away I'm not giving it it away it's a promise you could say it's selfish it's a guarantee that he'll provide for me and I give it to God I don't give it to Ministry I don't give it to men I give it to God and I've seen what happens in those things but we look at Delilah and we see how she betrayed Samson for her own benefit and we know the price he paid his wandering eyes he lost they took him both out he was blind remember the scripture says if thine eye offend thee pluck it out God did the literal thing for Samuel or or for Samson Samson you can't control your eyes let's let him go and what did they do they plucked his eyes out so that he couldn't see and they shaved his head and remember the long hair was a Nazarite Covenant he wasn't allowed to drink alcohol and he couldn't shave his head and when they shaved his head he lost his Covenant and so God couldn't give him the power that he had Samson was the strongest man that ever lived we see what he did he lifted the entire Gates out of a city and carried them and put them up on a hill tore a lion in half with his bare hands killed a thousand men with a Jawbone of a donkey but it was only when the spirit of God was on him and when he got out of the Covenant the spirit of the Lord couldn't come upon him so what did they do they they they they put him in in in the prison there and even in this condition Church even in this condition Samson is a Son of God he's called to be a deliverer he's called to be a judge his condition would say no but his position and his Heritage says yes and so what happens is they put him in the prison and they they put chains on him and they bind him to the grinding wheel for the for the mill so that he could they can put the weed in there and he can grind it up and turn it into flower or finer material or whatever and they used them like an animal but in there they forgot how they got the victory over him see they thought the eyes were the were were the source they forgot it was the hair it was the Covenant and when he could come back to the place of Covenant restitution he could have his strength back so he's in there and day by day nothing changes except his hair is growing longer and longer and longer and what happens he starts to realize I'm under a covenant again there's an opportunity here but Satan loves to tie us down to the grinding wheel doesn't he I've been there church I've been there don't say he doesn't do it like I said it's like Pharaoh trying to make us do bricks without straw right you got to work twice as hard and it fails all the time and we just sit there and we grind and we grind and we grind and nothing comes out of it what is it we completely miss the Privileges of being in the father's home we look at our lives we look at our families our bodies our health whatever it is and we say I'm going to make a change can't do it we can't change ourselves can't do it so often what happens is we'll change for a season and then when we hit where we want to be we relax and what do we do we go right back to what we always were why because it was discipline that got us and then discipline goes away we need a heart change we need a nature change we need the power of the Holy Ghost Inside Of Our Lives that's the lasting change that we're looking for and yet we strive and strive grinding and turning the wheel and it never produces the answer we want the lasting answer it may produce the answer but it doesn't last because we never changed in the process but watch what he does to Samuel Samuel or Samson sorry Sam Samson's there and his hair starting to grow and the Philistines make this great mistake of bringing him out to make fun of him says now the house was full of men and women and all the Lords of the Philistines were there and and there were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women that beheld while Samson made sport now watch Samson's attitude here now he says and Samson called unto the Lord and said oh Lord God remember me everything's in position he says remember me not worthy he says I pray thee and strengthen me he doesn't say deliver me he says Lord put me back into fellowship and use me as you've used me before he says I pray thee only this once oh God that I may be at once Avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes and Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood it's a temple 3,000 people up in the upper balcony and on which it was borne up of the one with his right hand and the other with his left and Samson said let me die with the Philistines he's chained to these two pillars and all he does is he just lays hold of them and he starts to push he says and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the Lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life Samson didn't die in Israel he died in a foreign land blind but he had returned to the father's home spiritually he returned to his position he returned to his place he' settled in his heart where his strength came from he knew he couldn't bring the house down he couldn't bring the temple down on his own he said Lord just once more remember me strengthen me for your purpose and let me do something for your kingdom one more time you know sometimes we leave the kingdom of God and we don't even leave the church we don't leave our pews we don't leave our families remember the kingdom of God is within us Jesus said what is it it's the Holy Ghost it's the engrafted word it's the word that's written on our heart and what do we do is we leave that while still staying as wonderful church members we forget that God is supposed to be walking with through all of these things and we're trying to make things happen on our own and I'm not saying stop working stop studying stop trying stop planning stop putting effort in I'm saying realizing realize that what you're reaping is going to get you what what you're sewing is what you're going to reap and the work will not produce the effort the the fullness of the effort you're putting in it doesn't work that way but if you'll trust God blessed is the man who trusteth in the Lord and who in whose hope the Lord is is then he magnifies these things amen if we can keep him at the Forefront of every situation we get to enjoy the Privileges of being a son and daughter of God look the way Paul put it Paul one of the greatest preachers ever alive maybe the greatest aside from Christ as far as I'm concerned understood All Things Great Revelations but he would say this in F SEC First Corinthians he says I have planted Paul says I did some work I did a lot of work then he says Apollos watered he he's talking about us as a plant he says and somebody comes behind and they watered he says but God gave the increase cuz remember what the scripture says in that day they're going to come to me and say Lord Lord did not we do this and that and all these beautiful things in thy name and he says no I never knew you you did it but it wasn't me that gave the increase it was you and for your own good he says so then neither is he that planteth anything I I was talking to to a minister recently and he said isn't it just so frustrating he says that you can preach a service and then a visiting Minister will come in and preach the exact same thing and he gets twice or three times the response that you do he said I literally had a man come to me the other day after a service like that and say wasn't that amazing I've never heard anything like that and he says in my head I'm screaming I just preached it last service but what's the problem not that it was a problem he had a good attitude the me monster me me me me me it's all because of me no no no no no Paul says yes I did something yes somebody else did something and I don't begrudge him that but God gives the increase if God's in it it'll last it'll produce something that holds so he says so then neither he that planteth anything so Paul says I'm nothing I planted he says neither he that WTH anything he says but it's God that giveth the increase amen Psalms 127 says accept the Lord build the house can I say it this way except the Lord build the business except the Lord build the career except the Lord build the ministry except the Lord build the marriage they labor in vain that build it doesn't say you won't labor but it'll be in vain it does not stand without him he says and except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain we can buy insurance we can put up Investments we can put up roadblocks we can put everything to protect our elves and you know what happens you get an act of God that's what they call these things that destroy everything that we put up to protect ourselves they call it an act of God except God protects us nothing is secure I want to close with one more example this morning one of my favorite examples we get one verse in the Bible about this man he was named shamgar we're talking about the Privileges of home and shamgar was the right person in the right place at the right time and he didn't realize it he was in the father's home but he didn't realize he had privileges because of that shamgar was a Believer Shamar lived by the law of Moses shamgar was a good man he was a faithful man and he was living in Israel when things got tough shamgar didn't leave he stayed there right where he was supposed to and yet he's living in total defeat we're talking about the Privileges of this morning of Home shamgar didn't realize those privileges the prophet of God would paint a drama surrounding these events we only have one verse but look at this he says I saw on the day of Judges a little old fellow named shamgar and the Philistines would come in and take everything that they had every time they'd raise a crop the Philistines would come in and get what they had and take it off brother said one time he said they'd only leave enough for them to survive next year to plant the crop so they could come in and take it again never getting ahead just living long enough to keep those people in food to keep the enemy in food he says Oh What A Time robbing them and just about the time they get all their crops all raised and harvested all the hard work done in would come the Philistines take what they had and go back he says they'd starve to death he says so one day this little old fellow by the name of shamgar stood out there and he was standing there in his barn and he said well I suppose maybe we'll have enough grain to feed the family this year' and he happened to listen Trump Trump trump up the road come about 600 Philistines all in armor big Spears Trump Trump trump coming to get his crop he says my after all the Harvest after all the trying after all the effort and here come 600 armed Philistines to take away what he had you've been faithful you've been faithful you've been faithful and then Satan comes to rob you he says I see him look down at his little old wife a ragged sleep about naked he looked at his little children their P faces were pale and starved to death now these big old husky Philistines come in and take what they got they'll sure starve through the winter now shamgar said now look here I'm not a warrior I can't fight and there's 600 men what am I going to do little old me I'm just a little believer I'm just a weak need Christian Who Am I who am I the situation is bigger than I am he says a few minutes all of his oats would be gone all the wheat and corn would be gone everything he had laid up his family will be starved everything he had done would be taken off over into the big enemy country there and given away to the enemy pressure's building time's running out you own Jeopardy done and you know when the song's done you got to give an answer Church in the situation you're going to have to give an answer but don't let panic drive you to the wrong answer he says the first thing you know God begin to move on him I like that he says he began to get angry he's done everything right and now someone's trying to take it away my he looked around he thought oh my this is what God moving on a Believer does I'm an Israelite I'm a believer I'm circumcised and that's an uncircumcised Philistine coming up there I'm under the Covenant and somebody that's not under the Covenant is challenging me he says I'm not not a soldier I ain't got time to go out here and take some lessons and learn how to duel and how to fight but I tell you God's my God church it's time to let God be God it's time to let God be your God time to step back a little excuse me he says so he just reached up there and got an old Ox goe he says you know what an ox code is it's a little thing that had a brass knob on the end of it he says you beat the cattle through the Corral with it he reached up there and got that Ox Ox to be about y long just a stick thick stick with a brass tip he says he reached up there and got that Ox code he didn't have time to train to be some kind of a fighter he says the emergency was at hand he had to do it then church sometimes we get in emergencies and Mom and Dad aren't there the pastor ain't there the preacher ain't there your spouse ain't there and you got to decide who am I and who's my daddy it's an individual Affair and when God has put you in authority over something whether it's children whether it's a family whether it's a household whether it's a church whatever it might be you've got to be able to stand there and say I'm where he told me to be I'm where he placed me fathers you're the high priest of your home you have a authority over everything that is in there and that wants to come in there sisters if you have children you have authority over everything Satan brings against them as children of God you've got privileges when you're under the umbrella of his word falls on us to recognize our position that's what the preaching of the word supposed to do remind you of who you are remind you of who your father is remind you of where you're standing to get you standing to where you can have faith and confidence in where you're standing he says oh brother we ain't got time to go through schools and around through this way and teach this way and that way the time's at hand rise take what is given to you you say all I've got is one verse that I read this morning all I had for this morning time for this morning was one verse use that verse if it's the word of God it's still has power behind it he says the time's at hand rise take what's given to you let's go men and women are dying everywhere he grabbed that Ox goat and jumped out there and slew 600 Philistines he says hallelujah why he had the courage to trust God and step out there he says not till I go off and learn how to do it he says Oh my he says God is your teacher Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will back up God's word every time it's simple take him at his word he says right I haven't got time to learn about it he just jumped out there and knocked down 600 Philistines his kids stayed fat that year amen he says if there was ever was a time that we ought to stand and defy the devil it's now my brother that's right not today Satan not today this goes on no more it's finished it's finished shamgar only gets one verse in the Bible one of the most amazing Miracles Feats of Strength Feats of of courage in the Bible 600 veres 1 you know David's Mighty Men the good ones would do a couple hundred shamgar right up there with the greatest of David's men and all he was was a farmer it's all he was was a farmer he's just a normal person like you and I nothing special not trained but he took what God had given him and he stood for and he says not today Satan but I want you to catch the end of sham Victory cuz this is all we're told about it says and after him was shamgar the son of anth which slew of the Philistines 600 men with an ox go and he also delivered Israel what was it you get your Victory now you go and you help somebody else get their Victory because what we freely received we give that's the nature of Christ in US is that when he gives us something it causes a chain reaction in somebody else's life we're not self selfish creatures amen we give and we give and we give amen and inevitably our blessing starts to move into others and move into others and move into others shamar's personal Victory led to victory for the rest of the land amen he led them to victory over their enemy sometimes we're looking for victory and Revival to start in the church church family it it starts in your family it starts at home this is not going to be a public show you're going to see the moving of God in your private lives private prayers private needs before you'll probably see it blow up in a church in an outward way why because you've taken him at his word and you realize I've got privileges as a son and daughter of God if you can say with a clear heart say Lord I'm where you want me to be I'm doing what you're wanting me to do and I'm faithful to it you have privileges for provision for healing for for for for grace for courage for leadership for direction for deliverance all of these things it's all available in the father's house all God's trying to tell us is I've called you I placed you settle down rest you don't have to say I've got this say Lord you've got this cuz I'm in your plan I'm in your word I'm in your position I'm in the place that you've called me to and I can just rest in that look at Psalms 34 as we start to close one scripture one quote he says the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger you know it's a I'm getting older you know brother Joe and I go play hockey you know usually once or twice a week and one of them was with older guys and we're the fast guys out there and one of them is with the younger guys and we the slow guys out there those young guys they can skate and skate and skate and they don't have to take breaks and rests and we're huffing and puffing and you know defibrillators on and you the Young Lions he says do lack they've got all the energy maybe they've got all the skill but that's not where it's at he says but they lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing as the musicians come let's stand together he says oh you great Living Church of the Living God we're talking to you this morning he says I wonder sometimes I wonder if God could ever take his gospel and Shake you to a place till you'd realize who you are and the rights that you have the god-given Privileges Satan don't have one right of nothing he's only a bluff he was stripped of everything he had at Calvary when Jesus Christ took the sinner's place and died at Calvary Satan has no legal rights over anything no more he says hallelujah but everything lays in the hands of the church and the believer that's it Satan's lost he's nothing but a bluff like I said so often it's not that we're not in the father's house it's that we've forgotten the Privileges of being in the father's house every need supplied I'm the Lord that Health all thy diseases If any man lack wisdom let him ask the Lord who giveth liberally and abrath not we go to God and we have a need and we think that that somehow makes us weak or makes us bad no it makes him great when we go and we say I lack and he says I'll give you the need it's not about us it's about him and all he's saying is come and eat there's a table spread there's food available healing is the children's bread the scripture says Deliverance is is a literal name of God he's a provider everything we have need of so he says don't worry don't worry about tomorrow don't think about tomorrow don't look at the the bottom line you men that have businesses say we're in the red no he called me he Place me he'll provide you Brothers in school and it's hard I know it's hard young women whatever it might be trust God committ it into him trust him to get you through through you young men young women in careers and jobs and things don't don't sacrifice your position as a Son of God to take the place of a son of Satan it's not worth it chew you up and spit you out and you'll go right back to where you started stand firm in your position say I'm staying in the father's home because the Privileges there are better than anything that Satan can offer me out there amen amen let's bow our head this morning Heavenly Father Lord so often we try we try and we try Lord in our faith Becomes of that performance-based faith that we talked about last time where we've done everything we can and so we think it'll work out but Lord our faith is in you and you alone Lord our hope is in you Lord we see results and maybe sometimes we Pat ourselves on the back lord and we don't realize the price we paid by doing it all on our own Lord I pray you help us to find find that perfect rest that that's available Lord the peace that passes all understanding Lord that your word promises if we can just trust you and keep ourselves in your hands Lord if we can pull up to the table that you've youve provided Lord to the food that you prepared Lord and have a little bit of peace and rest and joy and love Lord that we could see ourselves through your eyes Lord that we could appreciate the good things of God lord we're not here for a life of ease we know you don't promise it Lord but you promis to take us through it Lord that you would settle Us in every circumstance Lord and like Moses he said to Moses and to the children of Israel at the Red Sea these Egyptians you see today you'll see no more Lord there's coming a great and total Victory Lord a total Deliverance to the children of God Lord but there's things that are available to us right here today Lord you promised Lord and we're standing on your word this morning Lord I pray that our worries would be just dissolved this morning in the love of your presence Lord that the the stresses that we carry Lord we give them over to you that we place our burdens at Calvary Lord that we would just lay them on you Lord and walk away free this morning Lord these chains that bind us Lord even this sometimes our own discipline Lord holds us so fast Lord and we lose the joy of trusting that you'll finish the work Lord would you speak to us each one Lord work in our hearts and souls this morning Lord I pray you'd set us free Lord to worship to rest to trust Lord to believe to bask in your presence in your promise Lord God or touch your people we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen do we know that song Hear My Prayer oh lord it's 887 if we don't know it it's okay yes that's it hear my

soldier's life man it's a tough life and God expects us to have discipline when it comes to his word and me to stick with it and stay with it but through it all it's his one-sided Covenant where he said he'd do it and it's independent of what we do or say he said I'm going to have a bride and she'll be spotless she'll be perfect perfect shall be without wrinkle he says I'm going to make a people out of people that aren't a people I'm going to pull them from every nation in every direction and I'm going to pull them together and I'm going to make a people of God and they're going to overcome and they're going to have Victory and they're going to live a life that they had no idea even existed before I met them and I'm going to change them I'm going to put a new heart in them and I'm going to put a new spirit in them then I'm going to put my spirit inside of them and they'll love to to live the way I want them to live but within that are all these benefits packed in we read that last service forget not all the benefits of the Lord and sometimes it's because we are so caught up in the situation and what we can do rather than saying I've got a promise for what I'm trying so hard to achieve on my own and just sit back and say Lord you help me because so often what we treat are symptoms we treat symptoms it's it's a great failing I think of Western medicine is we treat symptoms and and we overmedicate in these different things and what happens is the root issue is not solved we don't eat right we don't sleep right we don't we don't live a clean lifestyle and so they're trying to compensate for and as Believers what can happen is we get our performance mixed into the working of God and all is it does is it starts to undo those things but God's calling us and what happens is he'll let us fail he'll let us get worn out he'll let us come to the end of the Rope let us go over the cliff and we're just hanging on by one finger and we say maybe I should ask for some help and all of a sudden there's a hand that reaches down and grabs us says I was here was here all along just waiting for you to ask help me heal me Deliver Me From Myself help me have rest help me trust give me the peace that you've talked about out where I don't have to work and produce it but where I can just rest that you do all things well that's what's available to us this morning don't stop trying to do what he wants you to do just don't get caught up in the idea that you're trying is what makes it happen amen he looks at the sincerity of our heart that's all he's looking at but the performance is up to him remember the final stage of truth before she went to the wedding supper the wedding ceremony she had to rest she had been working she'd been diligent she' done everything you could expect and she had a name among the people don't let your name among the people turn you into a performance-driven Christian I'm preaching to myself don't let it people looking at you keep you in the way but she came to the place and Naomi said rest Ruth what he said he'll do he'll do he's that kind of a man he's that kind of a God she says and you rest and you wait he's provided everything you have need of we've got food for a long time just sit here rest eat up gather your strength you've had a long night you've had a long season but it's time for you to rest cuz the final work is the
