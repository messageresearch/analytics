provides answers lord we're thankful for your graciousness your mercy your forgiveness to us each one lord that we can stand here and as that song says lord we're forgiven and we're not ashamed lord lord there's no fear anymore lord there's no shame but lord we look to your word lord we look to the presence of your holy spirit in our very lives and say lord we're thankful that you told us we didn't have to be ashamed anymore lord that you took our shame at calvary lord and you gave us your righteousness in its place so we could stand here and proclaim that we are free in your presence lord we pray now that as the coming forth of the word lord would be over this pulpit lord that you would just dwell in that word lord that it would not be a dead word that it would not be a word that kills lord but it would be a word that lives lord that your spirit will quicken it to every heart and soul that's here lord that's listening online lord that might listen at a later date lord we pray that it would be anointed by you lord that it would not be me lord but that it would be you lord that would speak to your people tonight lord touch them now we ask lord have your way we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen thank you musicians that'll be it god bless you if you'll turn the scriptures to ephesians chapter 4 tonight ephesians chapter 4. amen greet our brother mcnelly here tonight amen brother it's good to have you here god bless you we are a small group so everyone that we add is a big addition amen we've got about 30 we have one we've got three percent more power i figure so uh we need to keep adding more people in amen amen good to have you brother god bless you ephesians chapter four just the first scripture says i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called i put the amplified up here it says i therefore the prisoner of the lord appeal to and beg you to lead a life worthy of the divine calling to which you have been called with behavior that is a credit to the summons to god's service amen god bless you you can have your seats this evening amen we want to continue on our series on the overcomers and i want to finish off this idea of a worthy life amen and last time we we spoke on joshua and we covered his commission amen and we talked about how that was a worthy life but so often when we look at joshua we say well his life was worthy because he fought great battles and he won great victories and he did this and he did that but there were many people that fought many battles through history and their lives were not considered worthy what we forget with joshua is that he was fulfilling the word for his day amen the promise was given to abraham over 400 years before that and he said that i'm going to take you into land flowing with milk and honey and it's going to be a place for you and i'm going to be your god and you're going to be my people and i'm going to give it to you and it's going to be a supernatural event and then what happened is god comes up to the river jordan with joshua and he says joshua today is the day for the word to start being fulfilled amen not not a word of another day but now there's a word for your day that has to be fulfilled joshua and you're the man that i'm commissioning to do it amen so it wasn't just an idea of him going and being in battles and doing this or doing that but rather what he was doing was stepping into the word for his day and he was doing it amen and with god by his side with that captain of the host brother remember he said that that was the holy spirit come down in a man that was christ himself the captain of the host he said with that captain of the host leading the way they never lost the battle amen and that's what our commission is amen is to step into the word for our day and do what god has called us to do and be what god has called us to be in this age now i want to notice here we're talking about a worthy life we're not talking about a worthy person because our worthiness as a person has already been declared amen when he took our place on calvary that's when he said you are worthy because you were worthy to lay down my life you are worthy to take that because i chose you you are a part of me and i'm giving my life for you so this is not about whether or not you're a worthy person amen whether your life is worthy isn't going to have any effect on your eternal destination if you're a child of god amen the scripture says that every man is going to be tried and his work is going to be tried and it's going to be put through fire and if it lasts through fire great but even if it doesn't it says the soul of that man is still saved amen this this worthy life we're talking about is how we spend our time and our energy on this planet amen and is that worthy is it something that's going to pass through the fire of god's judgment of the of the word that he has placed in front of us will it pass that test and be something that's considered of eternal value amen amen but we don't as always we don't want to leave it in the past and that's why we read joshua and we say well that's what it looked like then but we want to bring it into our day and then we don't want it to be about great men and women of faith in the old but we want to be great men and women of faith today amen and that's people that will take the word of god into their own lives and say the lord's calling me to be this to do this and i'm going to do it in obedience and in faith because he's telling me to do it in the first place amen amen we don't want to be those people that say well it's for another day that we can sit here and so we can play around i mean this was way above and beyond what they were worth in the eyes of the world amen but even after that was done there were still seats available amen so he sent his servants out to gather them from the highways then he says go into the hedges now who goes in the hedges it's the homeless it's the drunks that have fallen there when they've had they've had a bender on the night before and they're laying there passed out waiting to wake up in the morning amen it's the scum of the earth that lay and they're the off-cast the one that have no money they have no job nothing nothing to offer he says there's still room so bring in those ones amen and he brings them in and now the feast is first he says now we can start the feast and then so we look at the ones that are in the feast and their worthiness has nothing to do with them i'll say it again the worthiness is in the one that called them not in them amen and if we look at that amen we're not going to perform ourselves into the kingdom of heaven because he says this is a this is a representation of the kingdom of heaven we're talking about so we talk about a worthy life and we say well if i do this and this and this i'm going to get into heaven listen you get into heaven by the new birth that's the only way you get in and anything you do on top of that is just gravy as we would say that's something to you to have on your crown that you can lay at his feet when you get in there amen so we're not going to perform our way in there because we've seen it and i say it over and over again they come to him in that day and they say we did a lot of great things in your name and he says get out i never knew you and then you're not going to perform your way into eternal life but you're going to have it by a new birth which is him putting his life inside of you you're sealed to the day of your redemption in your soul and that's what he's coming back for is the word that he sealed you with amen that that seed that we've talked about so often that was in you from before the foundation of the world amen amen so what is it paul says walk worthy to the fact that you've been called to the feast not because you're some great person not because you've done this or that but because he's called you act like what he's called you to be amen verse 11 now says though we've got all these people that have no right to be there and yet even in the midst of this watch what happens now verse 11. it says and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment now remember i've told you before the in those weddings what they do is they put the wedding garment on every single person that came in so everybody more or less looked the same so there were no big eyes and no little use and then everybody looked the same so there was a quality among the guests now the king comes and he says there's a guy here that doesn't have the wedding garment and he said to him friend he doesn't look at him as an enemy he says friend how came you in hither not having a wedding garment how'd you get in because anyone that came in the way i told them to come in is going to have a wedding garment there was no shortage of wedding garments so you must have come in a different way how is it that you're sitting here and you look different than everybody else it says and the man was speechless then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast them into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen so we see this man comes in and there was only one one rule to be a guest an accepted guest in that wedding there was no moral criteria there was no job criteria no education criteria the criteria was put on the garment that i give you at the door come in by the door and then put on the wedding garment that i've told you to put on him and the man didn't do it he snuck in another way and you'd say why would you sneak in he's he's obviously invited everybody in why did you feel the need to sneak in because that's what he had to do to not get a wedding garment he tried to get in on his own basis and then he tried to come in based on something he'd done he snuck in and felt well i'll just blend in with the other guests they'll never know that i wasn't here but he forgot one thing anybody that he calls in he gives him the wedding garment too amen and that's the great equalizer for us is his righteousness amen and it's signified by the holy spirit in our lives and if you've got the holy spirit and i've got the holy spirit there's no difference i'm no bigger than you and i'm no smaller than you brother brahm said after the opening of the seals he says there are no great ones among us amen and that's the prophet of god to this age saying there are no great ones among us why if you're a holy ghost-filled believer and i'm a holy ghost-filled believer we're all equal in his sight amen amen hallelujah amen to refuse the king's garment was to accept judgment to turn it down to turn down his way of coming in was to be judged amen he could have come in the way the king said but he refused to do it and that meant judgment and he couldn't answer why did i come in any other way than but the way he told me to amen amen so this worthy life is not determined by you or me it's determined by him and we've got to be worthy in the way that he deems to be worthy rather than the way that we feel is worthy amen i've been reading a bit from brother lonnie jenkins in the the last few weeks and he talks about finding your position in christ and when he first came to the message or even before that he always looked at that as being you know part of the five full ministry or having you know one of the nine spiritual gifts in the church and that was finding your your way into the body of christ amen but he says those those are all just elements of that and your first priority is to first find your way into the body amen you've got to be in there you've got to be compatible with the body you've got to have the same buildup as the rest of the body and so you've got to have that settled before you ever start saying where do i fit into this body so first corinthians 12 says now concerning spiritual breath spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant and then paul cycles through the nine spiritual gifts all the way down to verse 11 he says all of these gifts that i just talked about worketh but all of these worketh that one in the same self-same spirit what he's saying there's the holy spirit is the one that works those gifts that operates those gifts it's not men that operate him but it's the holy spirit in the body in those people that's operating those gifts so it says in all of these worketh that one and self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will so it's the holy spirit that divides those up amongst us and gives them to us amen it's not our worthiness that determines it but it's the holy spirit it's for ordained brother branham said i don't have the quote here but he says god knew who would use those gifts properly and he gives them to them amen for as the body is one and had many members and all the members of that one body be many are one body so also is christ so he says there's a whole bunch of parts to a regular body and there's a whole bunch of parts to the body of christ amen the myth the mystical body of christ that brother brahm talked about amen for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but one but many amen i can point you to many people today that are using gifts that are 100 percent gifts of the holy spirit but they're using them for their own gain amen brother brandon when you get into anointed ones at the end time and whatnot he'll talk about people that are literally anointed by the holy spirit but they're doing it in a way that doesn't please god him and they take that anointing and they use it for their own purpose and their own pleasures amen why gifts and callings are without repentance amen when you look at pentecost they they went off on the gifts amen the baptism of the holy spirit was there and they ran off with the gifts and you go into a pentecostal church today and you can see them operating the gifts of the holy spirit amen but you can look through scripture and you can see tons of people that had gifts callings very real ones and yet they didn't have god and then they had the gift but they didn't have the giver you look at judas iscariot was a member of the group of disciples that was given power and authority to to to what cast out demons and heal diseases right and he went out and he did the exact same signs and wonders as they did and yet where was he when christ was hanging on the cross much less when he came out and was raised from the dead and they're up in the in in the room at pentecost he's not there is he he's the son of perdition that was revealed for that day you look at balaam balaam was a prophet of god there's no way that you can dispute anything but that balaam was a prophet of god balaam had one-on-one conversations with god right he went in and god talked to him just as almost as if he would to moses he it was very clear he knew what god said and he knew what god wanted him to do and yet what happens is balaam starts to what take that gift and say well somebody wants me to use this gift for them and so he goes to god and he pushes and he pushes and he pushes until god says yeah you can go but the only words you'll say will be the words that i put in your mouth and balaam goes there he can only say blessings but he helps lead them into idolatry a sin that god that brother brahm said god never forgave israel for it and balaam ends up killed by the israelites in the end of it all amen a true gift a true calling a true prophet and yet where's god in it right what is it he got pulled away into his own desires amen he wanted to have the money he wanted to have the popularity he wanted to have the recognition of a powerful king look at the prophets of ahab now this one is scary because the prophets of ahab were true prophets you'll never find in scripture that says that they were false prophets it says they were of the prophets amen there's 450 of them they are true genuine proven prophets but what happened was ahab came and ahab wanted a directed prophecy right when you're in court a judge can tell you to do a directive verdict he'll say you must find this person guilty and what happened was ahab went to those prophets and he says i need you to tell me that i'm going to be victorious because i got jehoshaphat here and he's looking for direction from god and if all the prophets say that this is going to be a victory for us then he'll be on my side so he says go in there and you go find the word of the lord and make sure it's victory for me and what happened was those prophets wanted to please the king rather than be true prophets and in that desire god allows god even sends a lying spirit because the lion spirit always wants to get on the prophet because if he can get him off one time then the people won't listen to him anymore right so the lion spirit's saying let me go let me go let me go and the desire of that prophet of those 450 prophets opens them up to a lying suggestion and all of a sudden that spirit comes down they feel the anointing of prophecy on them and they prophesy victory and what is it it is 100 against the word amen god was not in it it was a lying spirit on them and then what happens is mackay is the only one that'll stand up and jehoshaphat being a discerning man says is there one more we have 415 agreements he says is there any more because joshua was a man of god and mackay he says yeah there's one but i hate him why because he was always telling ahab you're in for judgment buddy and so they said well what's it going to be and micaiah says sorry you're going to die amen but what was it those prophets of ahab they had a real gift that was twisted up by their own desire to please men amen amen and then god let them fall into a path of a lying spirit and they would never recover from that amen amen they always stop short because they got their own interests twisted up into god's work sometimes we think we can kind of ride the coattails of god's work and get the things that we want that's not the way it works it's up to him sometimes we get it i can say sometimes i've gotten what i wanted by doing god's will there's plenty of times i didn't get anything but what he wanted me to have amen amen how do we know how do we know we've got the holy spirit how do you know you've got the holy spirit brothers and sisters john says it in first john 4. he says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world false anointed ones brother branham called them amen hereby know ye the spirit of god so you know it in someone else and you know it in yourself every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and that is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world i want you to catch there it says that every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is come in the flesh not has come not will come but is come that means presently is here if you look at some translation translations of the bible they've changed that to has come and you know what they've completely missed what it means to be christ the word amen everything is back there satan is perfectly happy for you to recognize that christ came 2000 years ago he's perfectly happy if you can say god did or god was or the apostles did or the believers did but he cannot stand it when you say we do the believers do god is here amen it's jesus christ the same yesterday today forever satan can't stand that but john says every spirit that confesses that christ is come jesus christ is come today right now in the flesh that's what's of god amen so you've got to recognize that christ has come in the flesh today amen and not just in a prophet amen but that he's come in in a mystical body of the bride the the the believers that are here for this day and that is christ being revealed to this word listen every time christ has come he's been missed every time he's come he's been missed now you say he's only come once but when the seven seals were open brother branham said that christ was revealed in every type and shadow in the book amen and we saw him in joseph we saw him in moses we saw him in abraham we saw him in job we saw him in noah and all these different things and nobody recognized christ the word in those places did they very few did a very few elected but yet christ was still being revealed amen and so he says you've got to do the same thing today john says you can't just look back christ was here but christ is still here amen and he's working in our midst and he's in our midst and you're identified as christ the word today amen so john's telling us to try spirits not people right leave the people out of it you could be sitting next to somebody today that is 100 holy ghost filled but if they've got a spirit on them right you've got to try the spirit and let god take care of the person amen we're not here to put people into hell we're not here to put people into judgment but we're there to try the spirit and then if there's a spirit that we've got to deal with then we deal with it amen but we do it in meekness and we do it in love amen but but john says no you've got to have a jesus a present day jesus christ that has to be confessed that's how you know you've got the holy spirit you can say you can identify jesus christ is here today and you don't want to be doing it just in your brother or your sister man you've got to be able to look in the mirror and say he's here in my life as well amen we saw and we've covered this i'm going to cover very briefly just to refresh our minds amen in john 9 5 jesus said as long as i'm in the world i am the light of the world and then he goes we cover this in that in that sermon walking in the light but then jesus points to the future and he says then speak jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life so he says i am the light and he says the people following after me are going to be the light they're going to have the light and then from there he steps into matthew 5 14 and says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid so jesus shows the transition from him to us very clearly in scriptures and then you go on the day of pentecost and they were not hid amen they came out and they were speaking in tongues and in tongues meaning that they spoke and everybody understood in their language type of tongues and they were not hit anymore everybody knew that something special was happening and they pricked their hearts and they recognized that god was in their midst and all of a sudden 3 000 of them were added to the church and even more day by day as they saw what christ the word being revealed in people not just in a man that had just died on a cross 50 days previous amen amen what you've got to be able to see them in your day you've got to be able to see them in yourself you've got to be able to see them in your brothers and sisters because if you don't recognize them in your brothers and sisters you're going to start judging and criticizing them the same way aren't you paul continues this thought in philippians 2. he says do all things without murmurings and disputings this is the will of god if you if you read the verse before he says when god tells you to do something don't do it with all these murmurings and disputes don't fight the will of god amen he says what that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world brothers i'm going to need a bit more water if i could amen he says what holding forth the word of life now that word holy means you've got it if you're holding it it means you have it in your hands doesn't it doesn't mean that you're offering it but it means you're holding it you've got something to give to them and that's the present-day word which is christ inside of you amen he says that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labored in vain this is the prophet's reward here is to be able to offer the people that accepted the word for their day to christ at the end amen brother braham said paul's going to introduce his group and he was going to introduce his group and each one of them that's their reward is to say lord i did what you said and this is what i'm bringing this is my worthwhile life right i preached what you told me to preach i did what you said to do i went where you said to go i separated myself as you said to separate myself and here is the fruits of it lord i'm offering it all to you and saying this is the work that i've done for you amen amen amen but he says what paul has already said that satan can't confess that christ is here now because when he does thank you two cups bless you he says here that we're holding forth the word of life i mean that we've got something to offer to somebody and it's not just static words it's not just dead religion but we've got a life that we can project out that we can show people that the word that we have that the christ that we have the present day christ in our lives it has an effect and it has power amen and now you can have the same thing i have you can be the same thing i would be amen i remember brother gerald talking about a brother and he said well i want to be like brother so-and-so and he said just get the holy ghost amen there's no limit on who you can be like we all want to be like christ and what happened was that brother saw christ in those men and said i want to be that and brother gerald said you can be it just get the holy ghost because that's what makes them the way they are amen so when we have someone come up and say why are you different it's not because god sent a prophet it's because i've got the holy ghost inside of me now i have the holy ghost that opened up that word and that truth and that's what's changing me from glory to glory and adding line upon line and here a little there a little amen but it's the holy ghost inside of me that is the changer amen it's the one that is the change maker in my life if i could put it that way it's got to be the holy ghost it's not my pastor it's not a preacher any of these things they have an effect but you've got to have the holy ghost you've got to have a quickening power inside of you to receive the word as it comes forth and put it into action in your life amen amen so we're offering a life we can offer true doctrine amen i believe we've got the truth we've got we've got the revealed word we've got an open word we should be able to go in and answer any question from the scripture today there's no excuse god's not winking at ignorance anymore we have everything that we have need of right here amen but it's dead without the holy spirit to quicken it and make it alive in our lives amen amen this is god's life this is god's word this is god's message and this is god's offering to this agent so what we are offering is a message that is a person not just a word that's been spoken over a pulpit amen i remember brother mike parks and dallas said that one time or the when he was he would read the scripture a scripture before they start service and he said the message is not on paper he says the message is a person amen because the message is christ amen and christ is a person and when we accept the message then we become the message and all of a sudden now we've got a person that's being progress you know projected in front of these people rather than just come to my church and and write your name on a book and and do this and do that and you'll feel good and go to heaven amen we're not here to offer a feel-good gospel we're here to offer a reality amen listen to what brother branham said amen we're in the time of the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god that's where we're at amen so you say what does it mean to live a worthy life and this is what brother lonnie jenkins was talking about in the in the things i was reading he says sorry let me go back paul says in second corinthians 3 i'm getting ahead of myself he says you are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men that no means you are the reality of what we've said thank you brother matt so what you are epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men that means there's a reality there you don't have to open your mouth for people to see and read what you have in your life amen you should just be able to walk by them to live your life day by day your neighbors should know who you are without ever having to talk to you because there's a consistency and a following of the word of god in your life each and every day amen he says for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered so he says we've spoken this and you're the reality written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart amen he's saying what happened is is that we've preached it and the holy spirit has transcribed that from our spoken word now into your life and it's become a very part of you it's written in your hearts it's written in your minds and faith is activating it so that you are now the epistle that we've talked about all this time we don't have to go preach to all the world because you are preaching what we've talked about and you've got a reality in your life that people can see and identify with and if the holy spirit can just follow their way if they can get in the presence of god if they can read their bible without a denominational minister to blind their eyes then they'll say hey that looks a whole lot like the word of god that i'm reading how did you get that where do i go to get it amen and now you can say well we've got an open message we've got an open book come in repent be baptized how have you been baptized amen you might need to fix that and then you can get the holy spirit and you can be exactly the way i am amen and you can progress in the word of god brother braham says this he says we've got to have a church that's washed in the blood of the lamb now guess what every denomination is fine with that right he says and become one with the word be the church that's the standard that's our worthwhile life is to become one with the word brother brown brother lonnie talks about this he says brother brown we get these letters from people saying how do i please god how do i do this how do that he said become one with the word for your day and here's a quote for it he says what get under the blood because we're still living in fleshy bodies amen get under the blood keep that covered and then he says become one with the word for your day that's how you're going to please god amen is that simple it's not necessarily that it's it's simple to say it and then how many here would say it's simple to be it not exactly amen because why it's a battle every single day amen you've got because got to become one with the word of god for your time for your age and for your place and position guess what sister brenda's going to look different than sister maureen's going to look different than sister priscilla's going to look different than sister priscilla it's going to look different than sister amber is going to look different than sister blanca when it comes to the word for their day because they've got a particular portion of that word to display amen nobody sings like sister maureen right you can't take that but you can sing your way can't you sister priscilla and then sister amber can follow up sister amber only sings once or twice a year but it is so spot on every single time isn't it it's a tremendous blessing then we've got kim there perf pitch perfect who can match her and then she's got another place to do and then sister lily comes in and she adds her songs what each one of them has a similar gift in terms of it's a gift of singing but they've got a way of bringing out god in a special way and the anointing that comes down with them may be different and have a different effect but each one is effective because they're expressing the word through their gift amen it's christ through them doing what they're supposed to do and then so brother mark can get up here and teach in a way that i can't do and brother gerald can fall under the anointing and get off of his notes maybe in a way that i can't do amen and we've got the this player and that player and all these different things and we've got people in the body that can do so many different things and it doesn't all look the same but yet it is all a measure of christ that's being expressed in their life amen praise the lord amen the fact is you've got to be able to personify the word for your day amen you can't leave it on a page you want to be able to tell people about what's god done for you we're supposed to be able to testify without a message book in our hand and then we ought to be able to point to what god has been doing and what we're looking for god to do and what we're believing god to do amen that we've got to pass god we've got a present god and we're believing in a future god as well amen we want to be able to have people ask us what does god mean to you and have an answer for them rather than god sent a prophet amen it's got to be so much farther beyond that amen amen noah had to build an ark and get in it and that was the word for his day guess what moses couldn't build an ark and get in it because that wasn't the word for his day moses had to go and kill a lamb and tell everyone put that on the lintel of your doors and if you do that then you'll be saved you and your household and if you didn't do it you didn't get out because you didn't obey the word for your day you had to personify you couldn't just say yeah moses is god's prophet you had to do what that prophet said follow his instruction and then you were able to go out and your firstborn didn't die in these things amen abraham had to leave his family didn't he the word for abraham's day was go out and seek a city whose builder maker is god and i'm going to give you heirs and it's going to be as a sand of the sea by the time i'm done with them and i'm going to give you a land whose builder maker's not god and he had to leave and walk out and that was the word for his day and if he didn't do that then he wasn't going to get the blessing amen but he had to do something that was particular to him amen so often we're worried about what part we're going to play in the body and we've forgotten that we've got to make sure we're compatible with that body first amen we've got to be obedient and the first obedience is the new birth repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit amen you make yourself compatible and then when you're compatible you can fit in when somebody has an issue in their body and they need an organ transplant or something they don't just put anybody's lungs in them they don't just put anybody's kidneys in them do they they've got to go find a match donor somebody that has the same system as they do the same blood type as they do the same dna structure that's close enough to match and then they can take that and put it in it's the same with the body of christ if somebody comes in here without the holy ghost though they be gifted they aren't going to fit in with the group because you've got to have the holy ghost to fit into this body paul already said by one spirit we're baptized into this body that's your access code that's the dna that we're looking for that makes you compatible with the body of christ amen so if you come in and you all of a sudden you're saying well why isn't it working out maybe you don't have the holy ghost or maybe we don't have the holy ghost but somebody's got a problem there because we've got too much of a person there and we don't have enough of god in there amen so sometimes we flared up in our pride or these different things and all of a sudden we're incompatible because we've let something else put a spirit on us and now we're trying to do that and it's not god that's working in us amen amen i think today we're at a higher level of expression of the word of god than has ever been here amen since since the days of the of the the acts of the apostles this is the highest level of expression and guess what we've got to go even higher because we've got to go into rapture i mean that's the highest levels that we walk off this earth without seeing death and that's going to take a whole lot more commitment from our society man it's something i've been dwelling on lately is that that that push to get some quiet time amen where you can just sit still and talk to god and let him talk to you and that's a real struggle especially those of us that have kids and you know you've got to give and go and the back and forth and these different things it's very difficult to get a quiet moment i mean in our house half the time we're not shut down till quarter to 10 10 o'clock and you're ready for bed then you're trying to say where's the quiet time so unless you get up first thing in the morning you're not really going to get it because the baby only sleeps for this long and then you've got to make lunch and then you got to make supper and you've already had to make breakfast and you've got to wash this or brothers you're working working working and all of a sudden you're saying where's my quiet time with god because what we're trying to do is if we're trying to manifest the word of god for a day we're trying to find the will of god for our day for each and every one of us and you can't find that will just by waltzing along and never talking to him and then so the closer we get to him the the more we're going to see i believe the expression of god in our lives because we're seeking him more and we're quieting ourselves and giving him an opportunity to express himself amen amen but in the end brother brown says you want to be worthy says become one with the word for your day now i want to touch on the spirit of our confession that that john talked about here and he says in every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and that is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world amen now we want to see because he says it's an antichrist spirit that says that christ isn't here satan can't confess that christ is here because if he does he's got a problem amen that problem is second corinthians 3 it says now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty because what satan is an accuser satan is a tormentor satan is a binder amen he tries to make you a prisoner so if the spirit of christ is there saying that christ is here satan can't say that because if it does it means that he's got to move amen because liberty follows the spirit of christ he says but we all now listen he's talking about paul's talking about liberty and we automatically go to you know sickness or oppression and these different things but listen to what paul says liberty is he says but we all with open face beholding as in a pla in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so we're sitting here and we're saying well satan can't buy me satan can't buy me and say and paul says what that looks like is that you're being changed day by day by day amen and you're not being changed into something that you've decided but you're being changed into the glory that god had of you before the foundation of the world into that image of the perfect son and daughter that he had and that's happening a little bit day by day by day and satan can't stop it because you're in the liberty of the spirit it has freedom to move in your life and it starts to push satan out a little by little by little every day because we're sitting here and we're saying well i'm filled with the holy ghost yes but you're still living in a in two realms you've got your your your mind and conscience and all these different things the spirit realm and the flesh realm that are not saved amen so you're pushing satan out bit by bit by bit and your eyes are being opened so that you can start to see that word coming through and as it comes through then you step on that up to the next one and the next one and the next one and all of a sudden satan doesn't have any power in that area of your life because you've been feeding on the word and you start to see it break through and then you say hey that's me in there that's me that's a word coming forth and all of a sudden satan has to go because you're saying christ is being manifested once more in my life satan you've got to go and the thing is once you start to see it coming it's like a baby once that baby's coming it's not going back and once the word of god you start to see that appearing your faith quickens and all of a sudden you start to say here it goes and you know it's done and satan's got to move so if he says christ is here he's got to move because there's a change that happens when christ is in our midst statement there's a presence that pushes him out and he can't stay on your property anymore amen amen they can't confess it because the minute they do then the title indeed it starts to get read amen because the holy ghost is your token that's your proof that you own what you're talking about and as soon as you hold that up he's got to move and then as soon as you tell him i've got a right to this because the word says it and that word has been quickened by the holy spirit in your life all of a sudden those demons can't bind you anymore because what the presence of the lord is there and it's bringing liberty into you and it's changing you into what he has said you are going to be amen paul says live worthy of it but he doesn't say you're there but he says when the spirit of the lord is there then it's going to make you worthy it's going to make you into what he said you were going to be amen what is the part of being worthy it's to be the image that god had for you before the foundation of the world amen amen you're going to have a role in the local body and we'll get into that later but the point is to be what god has called you to be what is it the marines be all that you can be is that it blanca the marines be all that you can be or is it army or air force whatever it is you know they have a slogan be all that you can be well paul's saying be all that you can be but not that you can be but be all that he said you are going to be amen just step into it and feed that and feed that and feed that and see that liberty that comes in the spirit that brings a change in your life and you start to see christ be manifested every day amen amen you can't be changed into that image of satan has you bound that's for certain amen you can't serve god and mammon you can't be two things at the same time you can't be in liberty and be bound at the same time amen so if christ is in there and the spirit of god is working then liberty is going to happen and those chains are going to be broken they have to be amen first john 4 verse 4. this is the continuation this is this is remember he's talking about the spirit that confesses that jesus christ is come he says what ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world he did not say you will overcome he doesn't say you are overcoming he says you have overcome he says this is a finished work this is past tense in the eyes of god standing there in eternity this is a finished work the word has already been spoken he's already seen a bride prepared for her husband you've already done it and then he's already prepared a a reward for the overcomer of every single age we're in the last stage he's already said there's going to be people there so he says look you've already overcome him and the one that's in you is the one that did that overcoming the one that is in you is the one that's doing it in time today amen there is no potential failure or potential loss is what he's saying there's nothing going to stop this from happening you already have overcome satan it's a finished work it's a finished work there's nothing going to stop it the book's already been written the book's already been written if we could just recognize that and say lord why am i holding back why am i questioning the book's already been written all i've got to do is read the book and get the faith that's in the book and all of a sudden it'll start happening in my life amen what is it faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by the word faith comes by understanding the will of god and that understanding comes always by the word it's got to be in line with the word and when we do that it's going to be quickening that faith and we have that overcoming power in our lives amen or john doesn't say you are going to be an overcomer he says you already are an overcomer even when you're in the battle today you already are an overcomer hallelujah amen this is a the the famous quote that says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks now a lot of people say there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there is a real devil he's just as real as you or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him as real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater you got to recognize that god's in you you've got to be that's why i said you have to make sure you're compatible you've got to know that you've got the holy spirit if you don't know it then satan's going to walk all over you every single day but if you have the holy spirit then you know that god has not only commissioned you not only that he has chosen you but he has put the power inside of you to take the word and push out satan in every one of his attempts amen he says you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him so we are fighting a defeated enemy amen they say the best thing that you can do if you if you have an opponent is do what break his confidence if he doesn't think he can win he won't win even if he's bigger faster stronger meaner if he doesn't have confidence he's going to win he's going to lose amen and so what brother branham's saying here is he's saying he is already defeated his confidence has been shaken and that's why he's trying to bluff you he's trying to look bigger and badder than he is because he knows that if you recognize that he is defeated and the very one who defeated him is in you right now then you're not going to have any problems moving forward because you're facing a defeated enemy amen he's been defeated by christ already and now christ is in you again rising up and he'll defeat him every single time amen he says and by his grace you are more than a match for him amen that's real overcoming when you recognize when you recognize you have the holy spirit when you recognize that his word is for you and you recognize that his promises are for you he says when you recognize that he is in you today to make those happen that's when you've got real overcoming amen amen notice here he says tricks i was talking to somebody earlier tricks are not black and white tricks are nearly white amen we look around and we aren't going to be fooled by denominational preaching we're not going to be fooled by signing our name on a book or this set and the other thing what we'll be fooled by is one word off that's what we've got to watch that's why we've got to know the scriptures that's why we don't just read quotes over a pulpit because the quotes can be twisted so easily that's why i don't just read run scripture to preach a sermon generally because if you can pull it from genesis to revelation if you can pull it through multiple scriptures you'll get the straightness of it you'll get the truth of it amen so we've got to what know the word so that we recognize when it's off by one bit because satan like i said he's happy if you can recognize the god of yesterday or two thousand years ago these different things but the minute you put it in today he's going to say well why don't we wait till tomorrow for that right why don't we wait for that and there is a time of waiting that god has right to develop character i'm not getting that but what satan's trying to do is when you're trying to kick him off your property he's going to say it's a lot of work for today why don't we just listen i'll back up a little bit right he's going to want you to compromise a little bit so that he can stick around just a little bit longer amen but if the word says resist them and he'll flee amen we don't give up because he said okay i'll give you a break no no we keep pushing until he's completely gone amen satan will settle at getting you off the word of god by one word every single time if he can get you off one word today and one word tomorrow and one day the next then pretty soon by the end you're going to be off by degrees and then your gun will never hit the target amen and what your discernment will be now twisted all up and you won't have a clue about where you stand who you are what you're supposed to be doing or what your rights are amen first john 4. now he says he's talking about the ones that don't confess that christ has come in the flesh he says they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world hears them amen if somebody has a great following in the world i can guarantee you one thing it ain't the holy ghost speaking that's what he's saying he's saying if the world accepts him it's not the holy ghost we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us that's a powerful thing says you'll hear me if you've got the holy ghost he that is not of god heareth not us now let me say it this way if the same holy spirit that was in paul would not be heard by the world then why are you expecting the world to hear you every time let me put it this way if you got the holy ghost the world shouldn't be able to hear you and agree with it amen you're not going to be able to go on social media you're not going to be able to go into your workplace and expect everyone to agree with you in fact if you can get one to agree with you in any way it's a miracle but in no way are you going to get the whole group to accept what you have to say why because they are of another spirit he says hereby he says if somebody will hear you they're of god and if somebody won't hear you they're not he says hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error amen simple isn't it god help us to make sure that what we give is the pure straight word amen that we don't twist it to our own desires that we don't twist it to our own thinkings that we don't twist it to this idea or this thought or this book or this person that we're sitting under but that it flows through completely through the holy spirit dead straight through the word of god every single time amen because we've got to be able to be read and then paul said you are our epistles known and read of all men they've got to be able to read us and get the truth from us without having read maybe even the very word or message that we have for this day amen amen going back to the first verse ephesians 4 1 says i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation where with your call now i want you in verse 2 it says with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering for bearing one another in love now guess what if it was something that we would naturally do paul wouldn't have to tell us would he right in our flesh if this was something that we could do naturally and easily paul wouldn't write it down here because he'd say this this is something that everyone does but paul says look in walking worthy and living a worthy life in in living up to the vocation and living up to what christ has called you to be he says do it with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love he's warning us to be meek and be patient with each other because satan's going to try and come in and disrupt it amen that he's going to try and cause disfellowship and break up the unity verse 3 it says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace now endeavoring means trying and trying and trying and trying we say trying i tried no no no endeavoring means you try and you try and you try and you try well i said i was sorry how many times did you say you were sorry keep saying you're story keep doing what you need to do to keep what the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace you keep pushing and pushing and pushing to restore fellowship to restore unity to keep things moving in the right direction as brother mark says we're all on the boat china so let's keep it headed on the road to china amen we're not going to china okay but it it's it's a metaphor right brother merc that's right so he says what doing everything that you can do to make sure that there is no disunity in the body everything you can do that's a high standard because how many of us are doing everything we can do how many of us have done a lot and stopped short and said that's enough no no he says endeavoring a continuous trying a continuous doing a continuous putting yourself keeping yourself low and meek until that unity is restored amen like i said before if you don't have a weapon in your hand they don't need one in theirs and then if you'll drop the attitude then they'll drop their attitude and then when you when somebody wants to fight and you say hey that's a great shirt you've got on where'd you get that all of a sudden they don't want to fight you anymore do they because you've distracted them because you're not you're not saying yeah yeah bring it on buddy you're saying hey i like i like you i like what you have where'd you get it i'd like one of those they're not going to pound your face in with that are they going to say right they got nothing because you're not flaring up back at them endeavoring means you'll do whatever it takes amen and that's why you need to be meek and lowly because you can't be prideful in these situations amen verse four there is one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all remember remember we talked about a compatible body that means we've all got the holy spirit so he says you've got one body spirit hope lord faith baptism god and father it's all one is what he's saying so why are we fighting right why is there disunity he's saying if it's all if we've all got the holy spirit if we're all on the same boat to china if we're all trying to get to the same place then why is there this issue he says watch out because what's going to happen is you're going to try to make it about yours and mine about you and me about the pastors and the churches about the deacons about the trustees we're going to try and draw divisions into there and make it like each one has their own little part of the of the puzzle and the pie he says no no no it's all one it's all one so keep focused on keeping it as one hey man if you want to walk worthy you're going to keep focusing on bringing it all together rather than excluding and drawing lines in the midst of you amen and then paul gives us a but because this is where a lot of times the divisions come in he says but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ now this we're going to spend some time on on sunday by god's grace but listen to this in verse the amplified it says yet god's grace god's unmerited favor was given to each of us individually not indiscriminately but in different ways what he's saying there is that it wasn't given haphazardly one person doesn't have a gift and another person have a different gift because god just took a confetti of gifts and threw them out and whoever it landed on was what they got no no it says god gave them to us with specificity he gave it with purpose he gave it with a plan he gave it with an intention behind it for it to be used for his will amen he says each one of us is given what in proportion to the measure of christ's gifts what he's saying is each one of us is given grace that is in proportion or equal to or based on the gift that he has given us amen so in other words god's given grace to each of us and he's given more grace to some and less to others and it's based on your specific calling within the bride because what happens so often so what he's doing here is he's matching your grace to what you're called to do and it's grace given to you that's going to allow you to do what he has called you to do amen some of us have easier roads than others right look around we've got people that have different health problems different financial situations different job situations difficult spouses no no no no that's not true i made that up but each one of us has different situations don't we and you look around and you'd say man i'm so glad i'm not them or i really wish i was them maybe in some cases right but each one has been given grace for the path that they're going to walk down and the gifts that god has placed in their life to do what help them get through it and help others as well amen the more difficult the road the greater the grace that's what's paul that's what he's saying here amen amen the greater the gift the greater the grace required now that's a serious thing because we sit there and we get puffed up oh you know be big and he says no no no if you're going to be great in god's eyes if you've got a great gift of god you have to have more grace than anyone else to be greater than anyone else in that gift area you've got to have more grace amen moses was the meekest man and we know that because he wrote it but he wrote it under the anointing of the holy spirit amen moses could walk in they had a question moses could say wait here he'd go in the back room he'd say god what about this god would say here's what you say to him and he'd walk out and he'd say it that's how close moses was to god amen until christ came there was no man that had that sort of closeness now john the baptist was said to be the greatest prophet except for christ but when it comes to a manifestation of a gift and a closeness with god moses is the only one that had that moses could literally walk in ask god a question and come back five minutes later and he'd have the answer for you that's the he was god to the people that's what moses was that's how close it was was that god said you be god how many of us would want that what he's saying is if you want to be god to the people you're going to have more grace than anybody i've got to give you more grace one that they'll accept you in that role and two that you won't get lifted up in pride or twisted and turn it into something of your own will and your own making and get it all scrupled up as brother adam talks about amen the greater the gift the greater the calling the greater the responsibility the meeker we ought to be is what he's saying here amen why because we've received grace amen remember paul says did the word come to you or did the word come from you amen did the gift come from you or did was the gift given to you is what he's saying you don't do anything to have these gifts it is a gift of god and there is grace that comes with it to help you to operate that according to god's purpose amen amen sometimes we see gifted people and we think they've got more of god than i've got you ever think that preachers do it a lot they see a powerful preacher they say wow he's got he's got so much more than i have so much more of this and so much more of that you know what they have more grace that's what paul's telling you they don't have more god they've got more grace and that grace is there to push them back and let god operate through them in a more powerful way and so it's not that they have necessarily sat down and and cried on their knees and fasted and prayed and this and that the other thing it's purely the grace of god that's brought them to that place amen amen if they can if they can continue with a gift so great without turning it into pride and arrogance that's grace amen next verse paul says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts on demand amen we'll talk about that in a later purpose amen but when he talked about the the being worthy of our vocation he talked about that focus we've talked about singleness of purpose remember with joshua and these different men is that when they got the go they went and they didn't stop until they were done and then they went and they went and they went and all they did was what god had told them to do to step into what god had told them to be and they pushed and they pushed and they pushed and they fought and they fought they fought joshua didn't take a break in 10 years while he was conquering canaan and then he went and he went and he went until he'd done what god had told him to do amen paul himself remember he stood before agrippa and he says what i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision right he says i've done everything that he told me to do since he knocked me off my horse right and that's what we've got to be able to say when we stand before him like that good and faithful servant amen is that you told me what to do and i took it and i multiplied it and i made something out of it beyond what you gave me deuteronomy 6 5 says this and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind might amen that's what we're talking about bonk and i've been talking the last little while about how the true church really only uh it really only flourishes under persecution you know and that's when you start seeking god in a way is when you've got a need that you can't meet by working harder you know you can't put money in the bank when you don't have a job and if you don't have a job you can't make ends meet and all of a sudden we start praying real hard don't we amen when the doctors have thrown up their hands and said you've got three months to live what do we do we get on our knees that's persecution we just don't realize it sometimes that satanic persecution is what that is but we also have political persecution and then when you look at the the the alternative lifestyles they're trying to cram down our throat the mess they're making of our education system the financial mess that they're making of the countries and then everything is going to be putting pressure on us bit by bit by bit and the point is to get us to where we stop looking to ourselves stop looking to ease in comfort of life and say lord you know what why don't we just get out of here amen and it's that persecution as brother mark talked about in spirit warfare what do you say we've got 200 million demons that were released out of the river euphrates and they went and they persecuted the jews and then when that work was done because it was a it was an allowance of god now they turn their attention to who the bride amen and that persecution has got to come on us and it's going to come from every facet and many even from within the churches we've seen with you know believe the sign of these different things we see it from within we see it from without politically spiritually religiously economically uh in your jobs all these different things we see that pressure coming on us and what is it it's the holy spirit trying to get us to move to a place where we will surrender more and look to get out of here and say lord whatever it takes do it because i'm ready to go now we're easily tied down here even when we're living clean sanctified lives we're still easily tied down here guess what if nothing changed for the next 50 years i would live a very comfortable life there'd be no pressure on me to get out even though i want to get out amen there's got to become a greater and greater desire i believe and with that will then come a greater and greater sanctification with that will come a greater and greater seeking of god will be spending more time with him there has to be an impetus there must be something that's pushing us to do these things because as humanity we fall back to the easiest life that we can live and still get what we need to amen amen we just look at our no nobody that the ones that that go way harder than they need to are the other millionaires and billionaires amongst us and they lack a moral conscience usually right but the ones that go harder than they have to those are the ones that get rich the rest of us usually just make ends meet and we'll stay there we'll stay there forever forever forever and it's the same often with their spiritual life is as long as we can say i'm blessed i'm doing good and dirt today today and i don't feel convicted then we say well everything's good but see god's not looking for us to stay stagnant because that's what it'd be he's looking for us to grow amen as we read from glory to glory he's changing us into that image amen and with that means there's got to come pressure amen it's going to be pushing us to do what seek god's face more and more in our lives this was in the sermon that brother joe played a while back by faith moses and this one just jumped right out of me this is this is uh pharaoh speaking to moses he said you can just go a few days and you go stay in the land sure he knowed they'd be back then he found out that wouldn't work so he thought something different he says i'll tell you what you do you go on out anywhere you want to go but you leave all your wives all your children all your cattle back here you leave them here and you go out because he know they have possessions back there that would lure them back that's what the devil says to you just as long as you leave some of the things of the world hanging on you you still want to smoke you want to drink you want to dress like the world that's as good as the devil wants he says i hear so much about backsliding i don't believe there's so much backsliding as people think there are they just leave too many possessions in egypt to lure them back that's all amen backslidings are not what they say it is you left too much of the world back there and that lures you says you still got something to pull you back every time he says brother i tell you when israel got ready at midnight they had everything they had in this world packed up and ready to go anything that was worth taking they were taking it god sent us a revival like that we pack up everything and get ready to go the midnight cry is coming go you out to meet him you better have everything packed up you better not have nothing this world luring you back any strings to hold you down he says pack up let's get ready we're going like i said it's what i've been dwelling on lately is just that idea that i need to spend more time in prayer i mean i need to spend more quiet time i need to give quality time to him that i haven't been giving we've always got more time to give and what we find is satan will try and fill it up every time and then you get a break and all of a sudden he's got an idea he's got a thought he's got an interest he's got a hobby he's got a question a concern whatever it might be right and he's got something to fill that up but we've got to push that back and then and say no no no i need strength for the battle i need to step up i mean there's something inside of me that says i need more of god i need more faith and then i need more revelation i need more understanding of what god wants me to do and be and so i'm going to keep seeking him and then i believe he'll i'll find what i have need of amen but says this he says the thing of it is today we've got too much bypassing and doing other things and let's get to the mark is he god or isn't he god is he the same yesterday today and forever or isn't he the same is he still jesus is he raised from the dead has he raised if he hasn't then forget it amen do we serve a risen christ and is he living today is he the present christ with us he says if he has let's get our enthusiasm started let's get filled with his spirit get to praying and start a meeting do something amen remember we're talking about a worthy life and that means we've got to find god's path for our lives each and every one of us amen i'm not looking to my own worthiness amen but i want to bring something to him amen i want to have something to say you gave me something and i want to do something with it amen i don't want to have the holy ghost and walk in with just me amen i want to bring in other brothers and sisters of like precious faith with me amen i want to be able to have jewels on the crown that i can offer to him i don't just want the crown that he gives me but i want something that i've added in there based on what he gave me amen i don't want to go to heaven i don't want to go to christ empty hand today man i want to have something that i can lay down at his feet when i get there and it's not going to be anything of my doing it's got to be something that he's inspired in our lives amen but the rap says we look for christ to appear the same jesus he said when he was on earth a little while in the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me for i'll be with you to the end of the world that same one who could direct the word and be the word and direct it right straight onto the target that same lord jesus is here moving this morning in the form of the holy spirit to direct our thoughts and focus down his word to one true and living god to one purpose to one achievement and if we'll just let him do it he will focus the word right into a place that'll prove he's the same yesterday today and forever he says it depends on what you want to look at we must focus our lives not what somebody else says but focused our lives to him and here's the word see if we get our lives lined with the word then the word and our life becomes the same he says if you abide in me and my word in you then you ask what you will it'll be granted to you verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said oh my not what i said what you said you can have because you and he become the same because the mind that was in christ is in you and the mind that was in christ was to fulfill the father's word which he was the word there you are then you and the word are focused in together you become a living unit of god you become a living unit of god and then he says how great what a place you become a living unit of god listen you are a living unit of god you just don't realize it maybe some days amen and each day we're looking for that to be revealed more and more and more is lord what is that portion of the word what is that portion of christ that you want me to express to my life amen listen before his translation what is the rapture of revelation enoch's revelation was what it says scripture says before his translation he had this revelation that he pleased god amen can you look in your life and say i please god can you look at what you're doing today and say lord i know for a fact that what i'm doing is pleasing you now some of us are older and we've got to be able to look back and say that's been my path all along it's never too late it's never too late you can always get on the right path amen but we don't want to get to the end and figure out we didn't and then we want to look at it today and say lord am i on the right path and what i'm doing is it pleasing you because if it's not i need to get in that path because that's the rapture revelation is that i know that that my life is pleasing to you amen that i'm doing what you've called me to do and the rapture will just be that last thing that he asked us to do he just says all right time to go and we'll say let's go and we'll just step right into it step into another dimension just like that amen i believe it'll be so simple i believe it'll be so simple when it happens i don't think we're going to have some some great preacher up in front of us or some this and that the other i believe we're just going to say lord we're coming home like like that quote brother gerald says it like it's time and we'll all know it we'll all know what it won't be like calling up hey do you want to go on the rapture today no no it'll just be that holy spirit i believe there'll be such a unity there'll be such a presence there'll be such a reality of god in our lives it'll just be it's going home time and we'll know all about it and it'll just be boom but guess what before the rapture happens we've got a lot of things that have to happen in the same way where we recognize now is the time now is the place i'm the person amen for for the the things that torment us for family situations that have tormented us that have dogged our habits amen for physical conditions that we have amen for complexes that have that we've faced throughout our entire life through addictions that we have and mentor weaknesses that just seem to come back over and over like paul that buffett him and buffett him and then brother branham was buffeted his entire life with stomach troubles but before he went that stomach trouble was taken care of do you remember that amen there is nothing that you're going to be tormented with in the end when you're ready to go it will all have to fall at your feet amen listen to this as we start to close last page oh just remember jesus humbled himself to death for you remember we talked about lowliness and meekness jesus humbled himself to death for you are you ready to humble yourself to death to the death of your status to the death of you know what everyone thinks about you for the sake of another brother or sister he says he was not fussy when they spit in his face he didn't spit back when they pulled his beard out he didn't pull at theirs when they slapped him on one side of the face and the other he never slapped them he prayed for them walked on humbly he was an example of humility he was full of faith that humility was what an expression of his faith that this was god's plan for him why he knowed his words couldn't fail he so lived by the word till he became the word amen oh god he says let me hold my both hands to god before this audience let me live like that let this word so become that me in this word is the same thing let my words be this word let the meditation of my heart let him be in my heart on my mind tie his commandments upon the post of my intelligence tie them upon the pulse of my heart let me just see him when temptation rises let me see christ when things go wrong let me just see him when i get ready and the enemy tries to get me angry let me see jesus what would he do he was so much in the word till him and the word became the self same thing he knowed he had power he knowed that he could do it he knew it was in him but he didn't want to use it till god told him to amen see he wanted to be god in him to be the word and all and he know that when he spoke anything that it was god's word and though heavens and earth pass away the word would someday conquer amen we are creatures bound in time right now and so the word doesn't always happen right when we speak it does it amen but it says he knew that the word would someday conquer amen that word goes out and it cannot return void the scripture says but it will accomplish that which i sent it for amen he says he wasn't fussy and stewie if we're fussy and stewie let me tell you we've got an issue there because he's saying when you know who you are and you know you're supposed to be where you are you won't be fussy and stewie because you have supreme confidence you have faith that god has put you in that situation he wasn't fussy and stewie he spoke just the words of god every word that come from his lips was god's anointed word god's anointed word that means it was god's word for that time place and season amen that's what anointed means that you're not just randomly speaking but it means that there it goes out with intent and purpose and it is god's intent and purpose that causes you to speak he says wouldn't it be wonderful if we could say that my words and god's words is the same what i say he honors it because i do nothing till he tells me first oh there is your example there is a life worthy of the gospel amen amen if you get anything get that what i say he honors it because i do nothing until he tells me first there's your example there is a life worthy of the gospel what a place to find yourself where you can say my word and god's word is the same praise the lord and then brother brother mark prayed about what being surrendered giving him the preeminence that's where we're going to find this amen is when we say lord i don't even want to have input i don't even want to have input i mean do you look at job and job had so many thoughts job had so many inputs on his situation job a wonderful man so good that god said to satan have you checked out my man job right there's no one like him on the earth and job had lots of input on who he was and how good he was and how great he was listen by the time god finished with job job says i will be silent if we can start with i will be silent rather than finish with i will be silent i feel like we could get through things a lot more simply amen a lot more easier if we said lord i have no input you are sovereign you know the end from the beginning you know my strengths you know my weaknesses so what lord i'm going to be silent and let you lead me and guide me in this and i'm not going to put any i'm not going to stick my oar in the water amen just let the rudder be moved by christ in the backs in the back of the boat amen listen to this this is a closing quote now he says we've got to follow every day every hour of the day every step of the way we've got to be led by the lord jesus christ he says if we don't we take an organizational life and a life that doesn't follow christ daily is not worthy why because you're going to get off on a place of your own making amen you're going to get your thoughts in there you're going to get your ideas in there or worse you're going to let somebody else tell you what god is saying and all of a sudden what you're in their place instead of god's place and then you're in god their will instead of god's willing man amen what he's saying is there are you a selective follower of christ one day are you seeking him and then the next you're not right one hour one moment one situation you do but then the next one you don't that's not what he's saying he's saying when you do that when it's on and off on and off he says what you're getting into as an organizational life because what you're saying is i need them here but i don't need them here i want them here but i don't want there and what is that that's denominational denomination is when you decide where god starts and finishes right and what he's saying is an organizational life is when you have god in every single aspect of our lives brother brown says if we don't seek him in every hour every hour of every day every day every step of the way he says we will take on an organizational life amen the musicians would come amen what is it we draw a line with our experience around god and then we draw a line and we say this is what defines good this is what defines acceptable this is what defines worthy brother branham say no no no you need to check up every day lord am i in your will lord am i doing what you've asked me to do lord am i doing it the way you asked me to do it right not just doing what he asked you to do but am i doing it the way you showed me to do it is it in line with your word it meant so often what we're doing is we're seeking but we don't read the word i love brother mark when he talked about retirement and he says i'm seeking will the will of god he says and then i read the word and boom it comes right out he says and what is it the holy spirit quickens it to me and i know exactly when to retire and how to retire and i don't worry about it anymore why because he didn't just say the lord wants me to retire today he said lord what do you want me to do about retirement then he's reading the word right and so the word is quickened to him under the anointing of the holy spirit he knows okay this is the time to do it and then he does it when the lord opens it up to him amen i couldn't move here in 2016. you've got to move as you're moved and then you've got to move as you're led by the holy spirit there are things that are supposed to happen at certain times and we've got to be seeking for that i i watched a bit of ron brown spencer's sermon or sermon the other day and guess what he did a two-hour prayer line but he said i don't just do prayer lines he has a very special gift and then he's got a gift of faith and he's got a gift to foresight he's got a prophetic gift inside of him but he says i don't just do those types of things why because he's seeking the leadership of god he's seeking the moving of the holy spirit and the people he's seeking for faith to rise to the point where god can do something in the people amen if all we do is just roll prayer lines every single day then what would happen they'd have no effect right you've got to wait for god to quicken the people for god to move in the people and then when he does that he says we've got great needs but we've got faith here to take care of it and they call people up and they pray for them and then you expect the miracles to follow why because god was leading it and it wasn't an abuse of a gift or i've seen this or i've seen that but rather he's waiting on the holy spirit to quicken them amen we've done it here amen how many times have i called a prayer meeting i'm not like brother ron but i've only ever invited people to come twice and how many sermons have i preached here now 30 40 50 something like that maybe at this point why because that's got to be the leading of the holy spirit it's the same thing for so many things in our life is we're just looking for him to lead and move and we get that unction and then when we do we move but otherwise we sit there and we may know what's coming but we got to say lord when do you want me to step out then when he does you do and then that's when you say i've got faith now because this wasn't me because if it was me i would have done it a long time ago amen amen but now lord you've given me the unction you've given me that movement you've given me that push in that direction and now i'm moving into that i'm speaking it i'm believing it i'm confessing it i'm moving in that direction we're trusting you to make the way when we get there amen i mean god bless you just let's just stand together if we would amen brother brad i'm saying there to live a worthy life we have to be led by him every single day amen we have to be seeking him every single day we have to be looking for his leadership in every portion of our lives every single day amen god help us god help us amen that we would in everything big or small that we would seek his will that we would seek his face that we would seek his favor so that we can have confidence as we move forward amen let's just bow our heads or jesus perhaps a somber way to finish lord a challenge to our faith a challenge to our walk what a challenge to our confession but lord as we've read your word lord we take correction where we need it lord we ask your grace we ask your forgiveness where we pushed our way to the front lord where we've injected our own part yes amen nor were we presumed on who and what we are but lord we also believe that we have acted lord that we have spoken in faith lord at the moving of your holy spirit in our lives and lord whether it's situations for health or whether it's finances whether it's for lost ones lord whether it's for physical situations lord whether it's for complexes we have lord we are trusting and believing that your word has healed us lord that you sent it for that purpose lord and it's gone forth and it's not going to return to us void so lord i pray you help us day by day to just follow your leadership lord that we would surrender ourselves to you that you would have the preeminence lord because we know that after the preeminence is given lord the only thing that's left is a rapture amen lord grant us grace to surrender ourselves lord humble ourselves not only to you lord but to the christ in the word that's in each one of our brothers and sisters here lord that you would have full unity that you would have lord full powerful expression in this little body we pray lord we just ask your grace to us now in
