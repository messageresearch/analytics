[50:49] again it's it's the it's the say of the
[50:51] lord through the
[50:52] through the ministry of a prophet so i
[50:54] pray god help me as we go through some
[50:56] scriptures
[50:57] and again continue continuing with the
[50:59] message that we
[51:00] we did on sunday and that is concerning
[51:04] faith
[51:05] and uh because brother sister everything
[51:07] comes down to faith
[51:09] and that's what god that's what pleases
[51:11] god without faith it's impossible to
[51:13] please him
[51:14] so brother regardless of the hour the
[51:15] age the time
[51:17] that that man has lived if anything god
[51:19] was looking for god was looking for
[51:20] faith amen
[51:22] looking for you to be governed and
[51:23] controlled by faith
[51:25] amen and i mean a real spiritual faith
[51:29] because then that comes from god because
[51:31] the devil can give you a
[51:32] give you an impersonation of faith oh
[51:35] yeah
[51:36] the devil got a certain amount of faith
[51:37] as i said he recognizes what's going on
[51:40] now
[51:40] and the bible says he's come down with
[51:42] great wrath why because he sees what god
[51:44] has done
[51:45] sees what god is doing and he sees what
[51:47] god is going to do
[51:48] and brother sister if he's coming down
[51:50] with great wrath
[51:51] brother how much should we as the bride
[51:53] of christ be going up
[51:55] with great faith amen so i pray brother
[51:59] that's giving satan that that revelation
[52:01] giving satan that faith
[52:02] what faith is giving you amen the grace
[52:05] of god be with us brother
[52:07] because god is requiring faith
[52:10] amen and again it's not going by the
[52:12] letter of the word
[52:13] but the spiritual revelation now many
[52:16] really got the spiritual revelation of
[52:17] what god
[52:18] has done in these last days
[52:21] how many got the spiritual revelation
[52:23] what god did in a prophet
[52:25] and what god has done through the
[52:27] prophet amen
[52:28] brother the purpose of god is he
[52:31] fulfilling that purpose in us tonight
[52:33] is he fulfilling that purpose in us in
[52:35] these last days
[52:37] because brother we're looking for the
[52:39] looking for the resurrection we're
[52:40] looking for the rapture
[52:41] or we believe that gosh and a prophet to
[52:43] give us the faith for this to faith for
[52:45] that
[52:46] do we have that faith brother because
[52:48] god's not depending on the prophet now
[52:50] because he has come and he is gone
[52:52] amen so brother i trust by the grace of
[52:54] god
[52:55] that brother that we got the revelation
[52:57] and we got the faith that god
[52:59] wants us to have and god expects of us
[53:01] after of concerning what god has done
[53:04] concerning the ministry that god has
[53:05] said concerning the word that god has
[53:07] revealed
[53:08] brother faith comes by hearing the word
[53:11] amen
[53:11] god did this through luther and wesley
[53:13] you know and on others down through the
[53:15] ages
[53:15] and brother the pentecostals but brother
[53:18] look what he's done in this hour to the
[53:19] bride
[53:20] amen i trust by grace we're not going to
[53:22] miss
[53:23] amen what god has done and we miss what
[53:26] god is doing
[53:26] because god the prophet is gone that's
[53:28] right but god is still continuing
[53:30] in the revelation of the word god is
[53:32] still continuing to reveal it amen
[53:35] because they're proud of god even before
[53:36] he was taken off the scene
[53:38] he said that you've got to dig deeper
[53:40] and he said you got to do this you got
[53:42] to do that
[53:42] and he said as you dig deeper he said
[53:44] there's more going to be revealed
[53:46] and he had a boy because way back there
[53:48] 55 or almost 60 years ago
[53:51] that he said listen he said i know he
[53:53] said i know it's not striking you the
[53:55] way that it should
[53:56] he said it's not striking me the way
[53:57] that it should amen
[53:59] but there's come in a generation he knew
[54:01] that that it was going to strike them
[54:03] the way that it should
[54:05] because what was he expecting the
[54:06] resurrection he was expecting the
[54:08] rapture because that's
[54:10] that was the purpose of the ministry
[54:11] that god did and performed in these last
[54:14] days through william branham
[54:16] amen and they owe me the word the the
[54:18] revelation of the seven seals
[54:20] brother it's tremendous so brother what
[54:22] tremendous thing is god looking for
[54:24] amen we thank god for that praise the
[54:27] lord but thank god
[54:29] but can god thank you that because that
[54:32] you're believing it the way you should
[54:34] amen because god thank you because it's
[54:36] giving you the faith that it was
[54:38] ordained to give
[54:39] oh my brother sister there's too many
[54:41] still caught up with the as it were the
[54:43] letter of the word
[54:44] but not the spiritual revelation of it
[54:46] and the prophet god knew that and he
[54:48] warned the people
[54:49] and he said he said i know he said
[54:51] you're getting this you're getting that
[54:52] but you're not getting the revelation
[54:54] of what god has done and what god is
[54:57] doing
[54:57] oh my pray god help us amen brother
[55:00] all down through the ages the bible is a
[55:02] testimony of
[55:04] this is what god does this is how god do
[55:06] it does it amen
[55:07] amen if all god did wanted that in
[55:10] luther's day on wesley's day rather
[55:12] and god wanted that go on back to noah's
[55:14] age amen god wanted this god wanted that
[55:17] so brother he gave them the revelation
[55:18] of his word to put together
[55:21] so that they would have the faith amen
[55:24] to take their stand they would have the
[55:25] faith
[55:26] amen to what to get victory
[55:29] in in what was going on and brother
[55:32] and and he gave luther victory oh man
[55:35] luther did this and he did that
[55:37] well when he was looking for the
[55:38] revelation he was looking for the
[55:41] revelation of justification
[55:43] and brother he did this he did that oh
[55:45] if i do this god will justify me
[55:47] if i do that i'll experience
[55:49] justification and brother he went and he
[55:51] walked and he
[55:52] and he did these these things and these
[55:54] things you know that was taught them in
[55:55] the catholic church
[55:56] that all you got you got to make these
[55:58] sacrifices you got to do this you got to
[55:59] do that
[56:00] that's right and but you know what he of
[56:03] all that he did
[56:04] he didn't feel justified amen he just
[56:07] felt more and more
[56:09] a greater and a greater need of the
[56:11] revelation of justification
[56:13] amen and that's why that in that in that
[56:15] last moment there
[56:17] when he was so so overwhelmed by
[56:19] everything so confused
[56:20] and everything else until he just said
[56:22] oh my what can i do
[56:24] and he said i'm going to go into the
[56:25] church and he went into a catholic
[56:27] church
[56:28] and you know that they had the bibles
[56:29] out in the in the vestibule
[56:31] in the catholic church and that's where
[56:33] martin luther went he went and
[56:34] oh and he opened up the scriptures oh he
[56:37] was so frustrated
[56:38] and he opened up to the book of romans
[56:40] and i believe it was
[56:42] and uh and he read uh his eye fell there
[56:44] oh
[56:45] [Music]
[56:46] we're justified in jesus amen jesus
[56:50] justifies us
[56:51] amen and he's asking us to believe it he
[56:53] did it well it struck martin luther a
[56:55] revelation of faith
[56:57] amen hallelujah oh hallelujah
[57:00] brother he was never the same after he
[57:03] became a new creature in christ
[57:05] amen and god revealed to him
[57:08] the revelation of justification and
[57:11] that's why god wanted that generation to
[57:13] know
[57:14] that's what god wanted that generation
[57:15] to believe amen
[57:17] and be a witness for and you know why
[57:20] hallelujah because why
[57:21] because god promised to restore the
[57:23] truth amen and he was beginning with
[57:26] luther
[57:27] and with wesley and the father god said
[57:29] yeah and he had to bring in the
[57:30] salvation army
[57:31] he said because he said the the
[57:33] methodists he's in the wesleyans
[57:35] he said organized so quickly he had to
[57:37] raise up he said william booth
[57:38] he said with red hot salvation amen
[57:42] well brother i thank god for that and he
[57:44] on to the pentecostals
[57:45] amen but in the end he had a he had a
[57:48] prophetic ministry promised in the last
[57:52] days
[57:52] amen well he's going to do this he's
[57:54] going to do that he's going to do that
[57:56] and hey hallelujah what was going the
[57:58] end going to do
[57:59] it was going to get us out of time and
[58:00] into eternity amen
[58:02] brothers and i just go on in time
[58:04] rejoicing for that god has done this god
[58:06] has done that amen
[58:08] no we got we got to come to the place
[58:10] there's not going on
[58:11] and say praise the lord praise the lord
[58:13] oh yeah we didn't we don't have to do
[58:15] what what john wesley did when he
[58:17] when he went into the there were so many
[58:19] that were he wanted his word won the
[58:21] revelation
[58:22] that he that he went into the the
[58:23] cemetery and he and he stood upon
[58:25] he got up on a as uh what they call it

[58:49] them a spiritual
[58:50] resurrection amen and he gave luther a
[58:53] spiritual resurrection he gave the
[58:54] salvation army

[59:09] lord

[59:11] they looked there but there's a
[59:12] generation rise that says look up
[59:14] amen it's not looking to this look into
[59:16] that and i'll tell you that's one of the
[59:18] reasons why god maybe god took the
[59:20] messenger

[59:22] the messenger they're looking at william
[59:24] branham they're looking at this they

[59:48] yeah but what what what is the effect of
[59:50] your belief
[59:51] what's it causing you to do how is it
[59:53] causing you to live is it affecting your
[59:55] nature
[59:56] amen sister that's right amen
[1:00:00] brother it changed luther it changed
[1:00:02] wesley it changed the pentecostals
[1:00:04] and the others were in the revivals that
[1:00:06] god sent amen
[1:00:07] but brother how much is it changing you
[1:00:10] and me
[1:00:11] your faith in this message your belief
[1:00:13] in what god has done
[1:00:15] very good so what what's god doing oh
[1:00:18] he's what god did he's making flesh in
[1:00:20] you and me now
[1:00:22] giving us the faith of the resurrection
[1:00:24] faith of the rapture
[1:00:25] to get us out of here amen of all other
[1:00:28] generations we're the one that got to
[1:00:30] look up
[1:00:31] amen because you said god is going to do
[1:00:33] this god's going to do that and that
[1:00:34] that but he said he said there's a
[1:00:36] generation rising
[1:00:38] amen we're going to look up because we
[1:00:39] got to go on amen the ones that the ones
[1:00:42] that went on went on and went on
[1:00:45] they followed walked in the light walked
[1:00:46] in the light walked in the light
[1:00:48] amen and they went on to the to another
[1:00:50] dimension
[1:00:52] but then they come back to get us
[1:00:55] the prophet said the dead in christ will
[1:00:56] appear to the living saints
[1:00:59] amen what for get us look up
[1:01:02] amen they're not going to go here

[1:01:12] effect on us
[1:01:13] causing us to look up look up look here
[1:01:16] amen
[1:01:16] in our hearts in our souls we're looking

[1:01:24] god help us again i want to just try to
[1:01:27] by the grace of god just to share some
[1:01:29] thoughts again
[1:01:30] concerning faith amen because anything
[1:01:33] god looks for is faith
[1:01:35] amen and without it it's impossible to
[1:01:37] please him
[1:01:38] but it did luther but he gave the word
[1:01:42] to luther
[1:01:43] and luther got the faith amen
[1:01:46] oh yeah it struck him but i plea i
[1:01:48] believe the holy ghost was there and i
[1:01:50] believe that was the hour that was the
[1:01:51] minute that was the second
[1:01:53] amen for luther to catch it amen
[1:01:56] and brother well if not but god why
[1:01:59] because god let him go through all the
[1:02:00] rest all the rest
[1:02:01] to give him a testimony amen
[1:02:04] so these share that testimony with the
[1:02:06] world amen
[1:02:08] but brother and yet when they were
[1:02:09] justified they kept going on going on
[1:02:11] to another revelation another of the
[1:02:13] other revelation until finally
[1:02:15] god stops it and he gives us the
[1:02:17] revelation
[1:02:19] what what did he want us to do look up
[1:02:22] amen
[1:02:23] so brother sister i trust by grace in
[1:02:25] our hearts we're looking up to jesus
[1:02:27] oh please in the name of jesus please
[1:02:30] don't don't let your faith be
[1:02:32] oh it's got to be like like luther had
[1:02:34] the west no no
[1:02:35] no no that that faith did what god
[1:02:37] wanted them to do then
[1:02:38] but what's the faith doing effect
[1:02:40] causing you to do
[1:02:42] amen what is the effect of the faith in
[1:02:44] us what is god looking for in us
[1:02:46] what does god want us to do in this hour
[1:02:49] amen
[1:02:49] he's not let's not walk on with luther
[1:02:51] and walk on with wesley we're going on
[1:02:53] beyond that
[1:02:54] amen even the pentecostal age and so on
[1:02:58] we're in the bright age by grace amen
[1:03:01] and in the bright age it's not walking
[1:03:03] on it's walking up
[1:03:05] amen by the grace of god look up for
[1:03:08] your redemption
[1:03:09] praise the lord your redemption draweth
[1:03:12] nigh

[1:03:15] needed for the resurrection what we need
[1:03:17] for the rapture
[1:03:18] we got amen well we needed for it god
[1:03:22] has given it to us
[1:03:23] amen and brother again i pray grace in
[1:03:26] the name of jesus that we'll do as the
[1:03:27] prophet said

[1:03:33] himself he said you're our dad
[1:03:35] he said it was phil to fill our our
[1:03:37] footsteps
[1:03:38] and his shoes you're going to walk in
[1:03:39] our shoes he said amen
[1:03:41] because he knew that he was gone he knew
[1:03:44] that eventually william or her brother
[1:03:45] neville would go
[1:03:46] amen and even our brother willard

[1:04:13] resurrection

[1:04:58] and the pentecostals
[1:04:59] the baptism of the holy ghost and the

[1:08:32] god help us
[1:08:33] amen lord bless you my taken
[1:08:36] that's the sermon i guess
[1:08:40] maybe i have to get brother jonathan to
[1:08:42] finish it
[1:08:44] so lord bless you and again we we
[1:08:47] already went through a number of
[1:08:48] scriptures
[1:08:50] in the last message and i got about the
[1:08:52] same number of scriptures here again
[1:08:54] so we'll we'll continue in the word but
[1:08:56] let's start with the familiar scripture
[1:08:58] of luke
[1:08:58] chapter 18.
[1:09:03] and beginning to read at verse 1.
[1:09:06] amen
[1:09:10] luke 18 and verse 1 down to verse 8
[1:09:16] and he spake a parable unto them to this
[1:09:19] end that men
[1:09:22] ought always to pray and
[1:09:25] not to faint saying
[1:09:28] there was in a city a judge
[1:09:32] which feared not god and the prophet
[1:09:35] that god doesn't fear himself
[1:09:37] amen neither regarded man
[1:09:42] and there was a widow in that city
[1:09:45] and she came unto him saying avenge me
[1:09:48] of mine
[1:09:49] adversary and he would not
[1:09:52] for a while but afterward he said within
[1:09:56] himself
[1:09:57] though i fear not god
[1:10:00] nor regard man yet because this
[1:10:04] widow troubleth me i will
[1:10:07] avenge her lest by her continual
[1:10:11] coming she weary me
[1:10:14] and the lord said hear what the unjust
[1:10:17] judge
[1:10:18] saith and shall not god
[1:10:22] avenge his own elect which cry
[1:10:26] day and night is that you
[1:10:31] oh there's a lot of believers tonight
[1:10:34] it's not them
[1:10:35] they're not crying day and night to the
[1:10:37] lord amen for the word
[1:10:41] shall not god avenge his only like which
[1:10:43] cry
[1:10:44] day and night unto him though he bear
[1:10:47] long with them hear the word of the lord
[1:10:51] amen apply this to your heart
[1:10:56] and i tell you that he will avenge them
[1:10:59] speedily
[1:11:02] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:11:06] shall he find faith on the earth
[1:11:12] it's a challenge to our faith
[1:11:15] do we have the faith that pleases him
[1:11:17] amen
[1:11:19] the question is will he find faith
[1:11:23] and again as i said when you get
[1:11:25] churches in certain churches in the
[1:11:26] message and they have many hundreds of
[1:11:28] people
[1:11:29] hundreds here hundreds there now
[1:11:33] how can you preach certain things in the
[1:11:35] message with that many people
[1:11:37] when the problem of god said there's
[1:11:38] only going to be a few
[1:11:40] not many at all is going in the rapture
[1:11:44] he narrowed it he narrowed it down to
[1:11:46] just a very very very few
[1:11:48] and again one time he narrowed it down
[1:11:50] to a dozen he didn't thank god he
[1:11:52] narrowed it down to 300 or 500.
[1:11:55] yeah so concerning considering the
[1:11:59] i guess the 40 saints that are here or
[1:12:02] the 45 whatever is here
[1:12:04] i wonder how many of us are going in the
[1:12:05] rapture i trust by grace that we're all
[1:12:07] getting into the faith
[1:12:09] so that he's going to take us all left
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:12] and by grace maybe that he's going to
[1:12:14] take some of us by way of the grave
[1:12:16] at the older brothers and sisters amen
[1:12:19] and
[1:12:19] any depending on the younger ones to be
[1:12:22] ready for the rapture
[1:12:23] that he's going to rapture you amen so i
[1:12:26] pray god we're going to walk in the
[1:12:28] light as he is in the light
[1:12:29] we'll walk in the spirit live in the
[1:12:31] spirit amen so that
[1:12:33] we're not living natural lives we're
[1:12:35] living a spiritual life
[1:12:36] the holy ghost in control i trust the
[1:12:39] holy ghost in control of what you're
[1:12:40] doing
[1:12:41] in control of the life that you're
[1:12:42] living amen i don't don't make a
[1:12:44] difference to me
[1:12:45] what unnatural is your job that you got
[1:12:48] but still
[1:12:48] you're a spiritual seed of god amen
[1:12:52] and you're not going to you're not going
[1:12:54] to give in to just natural natural
[1:12:56] natural things
[1:12:57] no way no you're going to do it you're
[1:12:59] going to
[1:13:00] even in your jobs you're going to walk
[1:13:01] in the spirit even in your jobs you're
[1:13:03] going to live in the spirit
[1:13:05] even in your jobs you're going to be
[1:13:06] governed again by the holy ghost
[1:13:08] it's christ that liveth in you and he
[1:13:11] lives in praise the lord that's right
[1:13:13] that's why he'll bless you what you're
[1:13:14] doing in the natural if
[1:13:16] you've got it if you give it overall to
[1:13:18] him amen he'll bless you
[1:13:20] in doing this he'll bless you in doing
[1:13:21] that so i pray the grace of god
[1:13:23] amen that we're going to be led by the
[1:13:25] spirit concerning what we do
[1:13:27] and what you do amen so that brother
[1:13:30] that your job that you're going to
[1:13:32] choose in this world is not going to
[1:13:33] interfere with your spiritual revelation
[1:13:36] not going to interfere with your
[1:13:37] spiritual walk with god
[1:13:39] amen oh brother you got you got to be in
[1:13:42] a job so that god's there with you
[1:13:44] amen if god can't be there with you get
[1:13:47] out of it
[1:13:48] amen make sure you put it all into the
[1:13:50] hands of the lord god bless you may be
[1:13:52] seated
[1:13:56] and there's quite a number of scriptures
[1:13:58] that i would like to share with you
[1:14:00] if you would let's go to i was talking
[1:14:03] about faith
[1:14:04] let's go through the scriptures that i
[1:14:06] didn't finish on sunday
[1:14:08] in galatians chapter 3.
[1:14:14] in the book of galatians chapter 3.
[1:14:27] just trying to find it
[1:14:33] and let's read verse
[1:14:36] start at verse 1.
[1:14:41] oh foolish galatians
[1:14:45] i trust we're not foolish amen
[1:14:48] all foolish galatians who hath bewitched
[1:14:51] you
[1:14:52] yeah that ye should not obey the truth
[1:14:56] and before whose eyes jesus christ has
[1:14:58] been evidently set forth
[1:15:01] crucified among you amen
[1:15:04] that is the truth and this only would i
[1:15:07] learn of you
[1:15:09] receive ye the spirit by the works of
[1:15:11] the law
[1:15:13] or by the hearing of faith amen
[1:15:17] many have received and identified with
[1:15:19] the spirit through the letter of the
[1:15:20] word
[1:15:21] amen the books of the prophet that has
[1:15:24] been printed concerning the prophet's
[1:15:25] message
[1:15:26] amen but brother we still need the power
[1:15:29] anonymity of the holy ghost
[1:15:30] to give us the revelation as we need it
[1:15:33] amen
[1:15:34] it's got to be given to us in a certain
[1:15:36] way to give us the faith that god wants
[1:15:38] amen and it says are ye so foolish
[1:15:42] and having begun he said in the spirit
[1:15:45] are ye now made perfect by the flesh
[1:15:49] and have ye suffered so many things in
[1:15:51] vain if
[1:15:52] it be yet in vain amen
[1:15:56] so i pray grace rather the stand that we
[1:15:58] have taken for the word the stand we've
[1:16:00] taken for the truth
[1:16:01] over all these years and maybe the ones
[1:16:04] that have done it longer than anybody
[1:16:05] else here with
[1:16:06] myself and our brothers brother
[1:16:08] ellsworth
[1:16:09] and sister ellsworth that have been
[1:16:11] identified with the word identified with
[1:16:13] the message for many
[1:16:14] many years and i would say maybe they
[1:16:17] identify with it
[1:16:18] even longer than myself because it was
[1:16:21] in 1966 that i came to the revelation
[1:16:24] that god has sent a prophet and yeah it
[1:16:26] was 1966
[1:16:28] because it was 1965 december that i
[1:16:31] had been baptized in a pentecostal
[1:16:33] church oh yeah december
[1:16:35] i've been going to that that pentecost
[1:16:37] church for a number of years
[1:16:38] until finally the challenge was there
[1:16:42] to the audience to the congregation to
[1:16:44] be baptized
[1:16:45] and i remember going up and being
[1:16:47] baptized as the
[1:16:49] the baptismal pool was behind the pulpit
[1:16:53] and the brother baptized me using father
[1:16:57] son and holy ghost and amen and it was
[1:17:00] in when when i
[1:17:01] came in 1966 that was when i i went back
[1:17:05] to
[1:17:05] gamble for a holiday and of course i
[1:17:08] always go back there
[1:17:09] and we always had to add cottage
[1:17:11] meetings at brother and sister barnes's
[1:17:13] house
[1:17:14] oh yeah and and a brother uh it was a
[1:17:17] brother
[1:17:17] evangelist from nova scotia new
[1:17:20] brunswick
[1:17:21] and he was down here in newfoundland
[1:17:22] some years be before
[1:17:24] and brother and and the saints in in
[1:17:26] gamble
[1:17:27] a few of the saints in gamble believe
[1:17:29] the word believe the message
[1:17:31] and brother oh yeah because i can
[1:17:32] remember now even as a young boy
[1:17:35] when they when they were having a tent
[1:17:37] meeting in
[1:17:38] in our hometown of middlebrook and i
[1:17:42] myself and three or four orders four or
[1:17:44] five other young people just young boys
[1:17:46] and we were oh yeah we couldn't get into
[1:17:49] the tent
[1:17:50] because there's too many and and the
[1:17:52] tent was full
[1:17:54] but i remember that they had because of
[1:17:56] it was a bit warm
[1:17:57] they had the sizes attempt pulled up and
[1:17:59] tied and connected
[1:18:01] and so we got down on on the grass
[1:18:03] myself and a few other young young boys
[1:18:06] we got then on the grass and we watched
[1:18:08] watched the brother and sister in the
[1:18:10] pulpit watch them sing
[1:18:11] and listen to them preach and so on but
[1:18:14] if
[1:18:14] the results of that ministry amen
[1:18:17] brought us out from under the control of
[1:18:20] denominations
[1:18:21] amen oh yeah so there was a number of
[1:18:24] the saints
[1:18:25] that would gather in sister barnes
[1:18:27] brother barnes's house
[1:18:28] and we'd have cottage meetings we didn't
[1:18:30] they didn't identify
[1:18:32] with this denomination that denomination
[1:18:34] they did try to stay in pentecost for a
[1:18:36] while
[1:18:37] but they didn't want them and so they
[1:18:39] left pentecost and started to have their
[1:18:41] own
[1:18:41] their own their own services amen and
[1:18:44] when i would go out
[1:18:45] oh my i i wanted to fellowship with them
[1:18:49] amen i didn't go to a denominational
[1:18:51] church which is with fellowship
[1:18:53] maybe in in brother and sister barges
[1:18:55] home amen
[1:18:57] and we we we just sing and praise the
[1:18:59] lord
[1:19:00] and and preach uh just freedom from
[1:19:03] denomination
[1:19:04] god brought us out of denominations
[1:19:06] we're not under control of denominations
[1:19:08] no more
[1:19:08] amen we're free in jesus oh yes
[1:19:12] so it's finally in 1966 when i went
[1:19:14] there and i called the brothers and
[1:19:15] sisters
[1:19:16] oh praise the lord i'm here i'm looking
[1:19:18] forward to some services
[1:19:19] they said praise the lord brother gerald
[1:19:21] we got some good news
[1:19:23] and i said what's that oh god has set a
[1:19:25] prophet
[1:19:26] i said what yes she said god has sent a
[1:19:29] prophet
[1:19:30] and he was the messenger to this last
[1:19:32] church age
[1:19:33] and brother oh it's tremendous what he
[1:19:36] preached
[1:19:36] it's tremendous old mind the message
[1:19:38] that he that he got
[1:19:40] and so from that from that moment on in
[1:19:42] 1965 and it was july
[1:19:45] june july of 65 that we we started to
[1:19:47] put the emphasis on william branham
[1:19:49] amen it wasn't on the preacher in in in
[1:19:53] in british columbia somebody in new
[1:19:55] brunswick oh no
[1:19:56] i bought i tell you the influence of
[1:19:59] that
[1:19:59] of of the ministry of william branham on
[1:20:02] him because
[1:20:03] it was a number of years later that i
[1:20:05] heard that our
[1:20:06] that evangelist went down to
[1:20:08] jeffersonville and
[1:20:09] was baptized in the name of the lord
[1:20:12] jesus christ
[1:20:13] amen and his wife she likewise she
[1:20:16] eventually did the same
[1:20:18] and she come back and she said oh my
[1:20:20] brother sister
[1:20:21] she said the mo she said william branham
[1:20:24] he said he is my
[1:20:25] best preacher he said she said there's
[1:20:28] no one like him
[1:20:29] and amen so they they came amen
[1:20:32] and then of course eventually their
[1:20:34] ministries what they had stopped
[1:20:36] and they came back under the ministry of
[1:20:37] william branham amen
[1:20:39] and it was again in 1966 that i was
[1:20:42] re-baptized
[1:20:43] in bishop false amen by brother
[1:20:46] bill haggett amen so i thank the lord
[1:20:49] for that
[1:20:50] brother and god was put we did what we
[1:20:52] did believe what we believe
[1:20:54] because god was putting the emphasis on
[1:20:56] the faith that he wanted us to have
[1:20:58] in the hour we're living and i believe
[1:21:00] that god used that
[1:21:01] that brother and sister from from the
[1:21:03] atlantic canada there
[1:21:04] to bring us out of denominations amen
[1:21:07] and to make us ready
[1:21:09] for for the prophet's message oh yeah
[1:21:11] that when
[1:21:12] when when the testimony and the witness
[1:21:15] of william branham came on the scene
[1:21:16] oh praise the lord he's right you know
[1:21:19] we were we
[1:21:20] he was preaching against
[1:21:21] denominationalism we were against
[1:21:22] denominationalism
[1:21:23] amen and brother oh yes and knowing that
[1:21:27] sister burns she had heard about william
[1:21:29] branham and she had
[1:21:31] uh some some believer had given her a
[1:21:34] record
[1:21:35] one of those long plain records and uh
[1:21:38] it was it was a testimony of brother
[1:21:40] brown's life
[1:21:42] his test his life his life story and
[1:21:44] brother brown was giving it on that
[1:21:46] record
[1:21:46] and sister burns heard it oh she said
[1:21:48] that's wonderful god bless thy brother
[1:21:50] god bless our brother
[1:21:52] amen but yet not recognizing him to be a
[1:21:54] prophet
[1:21:55] but recognizing to be a man of god amen
[1:21:57] and she was absolutely blessed by the
[1:21:59] recording
[1:22:00] and but she was shocked in early 1966
[1:22:05] she was shocked when she received the
[1:22:07] magazine of a certain evangelist i know
[1:22:10] that that magazine might be might be
[1:22:11] here in the basement somewhere
[1:22:13] or maybe maybe your son got it but
[1:22:16] i've seen the magazine and i seen the
[1:22:19] picture of the magazine
[1:22:20] and on the undercover and that's that's
[1:22:24] what shocked sister bran sister burns
[1:22:26] when
[1:22:27] she received that magazine for that
[1:22:29] month yeah
[1:22:31] what was on the magazine it was a
[1:22:32] picture of brother branham
[1:22:36] and one of his grandsons or no it might
[1:22:39] have been brother
[1:22:40] his son joseph but joshua was young then
[1:22:44] and it was a picture of brother branham
[1:22:45] and joseph and
[1:22:48] the highlights on the magazine was that
[1:22:50] william branham
[1:22:52] was gone to be with the lord
[1:22:55] she was shocked to think that we had
[1:22:58] lost the ministry
[1:22:59] yeah and she said oh my
[1:23:04] and then when someone when this oh yeah
[1:23:07] when certain other brethren came to
[1:23:08] introduce her to the message
[1:23:10] oh yeah then she went back and got that
[1:23:12] magazine
[1:23:13] and she showed me that magazine yeah so
[1:23:16] thank god
[1:23:18] brother see it it's it was god
[1:23:21] that brought him out of denominations
[1:23:25] amen it was god that brought him under
[1:23:27] the control of the holy ghost amen
[1:23:29] so that when they received the witness
[1:23:31] of the of the prophet amen they were
[1:23:34] ready to receive it

[1:24:26] that we're approaching the resurrection
[1:24:27] and the rapture we're approaching the
[1:24:29] error to get out of here
[1:24:31] and to go home and many of us are
[1:24:33] focusing more and more
[1:24:35] and more on the resurrection and many of
[1:24:37] us are calling
[1:24:38] more and more for the rapture and many
[1:24:40] of us really are looking amen
[1:24:42] looking for that to happen expecting it

[1:24:50] walking up there one of these days
[1:24:51] and he said you're going to look over
[1:24:52] there and you're going to see somebody
[1:24:54] and it'll be
[1:24:55] it'll be one of those saints that are

[1:26:19] but they're not living for god they're
[1:26:20] living for themselves
[1:26:22] oh there's so many believers now that
[1:26:25] are just caught up with themselves and
[1:26:26] they're naturalized but not their
[1:26:28] spiritual
[1:26:29] amen brother how many have been caught
[1:26:31] up with their spiritual

[1:31:25] he said listen
[1:31:26] it's gonna come to that place and he
[1:31:28] said where he said
[1:31:30] this this boy or this girl amen if you
[1:31:32] got the faith
[1:31:34] if you got the resurrection rapturing

[1:32:19] of the book right now
[1:32:20] was in the top paragraph on the right
[1:32:22] side and then
[1:32:23] in the paragraph in the middle he said
[1:32:25] but you know what our problem is
[1:32:27] he said we're putting too much emphasis
[1:32:28] on the the the
[1:32:30] mechanics and not enough on the dynamics
[1:32:35] of what god has done amen brother god
[1:32:38] help us
[1:32:39] that when it comes to the dynamics it'll
[1:32:41] point us to the artic
[1:32:42] mechanics it'll point us to the dynamics
[1:32:45] praise the name of the lord
[1:32:46] if we're going to get in into something
[1:32:48] that he said here in this message
[1:32:50] brother i pray brother it's going to
[1:32:52] strike us
[1:32:53] because of the dynamics not the
[1:32:56] mechanics
[1:32:57] we're not just oh yeah that's what he
[1:32:58] said there that's what he said there
[1:33:00] yeah
[1:33:00] we we believe it do you experience it
[1:33:05] amen because brother what god has done
[1:33:08] what god is doing
[1:33:09] is bringing us more and more into an
[1:33:12] experience
[1:33:14] amen we experienced justification saying
[1:33:17] well yeah
[1:33:17] luther it was an experience oh yeah
[1:33:21] because the burden was gone the
[1:33:23] questions were gone
[1:33:25] the questions were answered and now oh
[1:33:27] my he felt lifted up
[1:33:29] oh my praise the lord wonderful
[1:33:31] hallelujah all the burden that was on
[1:33:33] him
[1:33:33] gone luther and wesley the same thing
[1:33:37] the salvation army the pentecostal is
[1:33:39] gone why
[1:33:41] the burden was lifted they're wondering
[1:33:44] and their doubt and their questions was
[1:33:45] gone
[1:33:46] jesus answered amen so brother
[1:33:50] sister i pray god oh my lord albert's
[1:33:53] not
[1:33:53] oh my the prophet said and i do see it
[1:33:57] brother coming to pass he said it
[1:33:59] usually said when god starts this and
[1:34:01] god starts that
[1:34:02] about the third or the fourth generation
[1:34:04] will denominate
[1:34:06] they'll make a denomination out of it he
[1:34:08] said they did it in luther's day
[1:34:09] wesley's day the salvation army
[1:34:11] amen after the revival was over it went
[1:34:14] on into denomination
[1:34:15] amen a form of godliness and denying the
[1:34:18] power
[1:34:19] that's why they didn't go on with god
[1:34:22] keep marching on
[1:34:23] they stopped amen and brother
[1:34:26] and i i've noticed that even even that's
[1:34:28] happening around the message
[1:34:30] because i met many a believer brother
[1:34:32] into the third and fourth generations
[1:34:34] after the prophet
[1:34:35] amen oh yeah and what is it
[1:34:40] i believe the message what
[1:34:44] do you believe the message yeah yeah uh
[1:34:47] yeah
[1:34:49] i believe i believe what what brother
[1:34:51] about the prophet what god said through
[1:34:52] the prophet yeah
[1:34:54] well there's more to it than that is the
[1:34:57] message controlling your
[1:34:59] amen are we just caught up with the with
[1:35:01] this doctrine and that doctrine
[1:35:03] oh yeah i believe there's one god
[1:35:05] there's not no trinity i believe in the
[1:35:07] only other serpent seed
[1:35:08] and i believe this and i believe that
[1:35:10] there's there's i'll tell you this
[1:35:12] there's unbelievers out there that that
[1:35:15] would
[1:35:16] believe sherpac
[1:35:19] oh yeah i like i said when i when i
[1:35:21] worked in a certain place one time
[1:35:22] and we got to discussing certain things
[1:35:24] and and i remember one gentleman said
[1:35:26] he said excuse me he said what happened
[1:35:29] in the garden of eden
[1:35:31] he said can you tell me that we did did
[1:35:33] they eat an apple
[1:35:35] and it made them made them feel like
[1:35:37] they were naked
[1:35:38] i said no i said if they did i said we
[1:35:42] need to pass the apples again
[1:35:45] he said i agree and he was just just
[1:35:48] he was older than me maybe a few years
[1:35:50] older but but young back then
[1:35:52] he said i agree with him and then he
[1:35:54] says well but what happened was the the
[1:35:56] sin that they committed
[1:35:58] and i explained it to him
[1:36:01] what i said
[1:36:05] you don't believe it oh yes he said i do
[1:36:08] he said that's right he said that makes
[1:36:10] sense
[1:36:12] he said that explains the bible and the
[1:36:14] way the bible
[1:36:15] tells it i said exactly that's what
[1:36:18] happened
[1:36:18] oh he said thank you he said i'm so glad
[1:36:20] i heard that it's because all i'm
[1:36:22] hearing is they eat an apple
[1:36:24] and i said yeah but but i said it wasn't
[1:36:27] an apple
[1:36:28] so i said i pray pray the lord bless you
[1:36:30] oh yes thank you
[1:36:31] thank you if that was good he said he
[1:36:33] said
[1:36:34] such to give me such understanding i
[1:36:36] said good
[1:36:37] and then as i've said i've even
[1:36:39] explained it to even christians and even
[1:36:41] even
[1:36:41] even certain preachers and i said listen
[1:36:44] this explains i said why jesus was born
[1:36:46] the way he was
[1:36:49] i said he knew no sin because of the way
[1:36:51] he came
[1:36:53] he wasn't a sinner you know and so on
[1:36:56] but still no they won't take it they'll
[1:36:58] still go back to the old way
[1:36:59] but thank god brother for the faith that
[1:37:02] god has given us and god is giving us
[1:37:04] amen the god through the ministry of
[1:37:07] william read him
[1:37:08] and again the prophet god said he said
[1:37:10] it's not me it's him
[1:37:12] yeah and just like he said when he when
[1:37:15] he was
[1:37:16] behind the pulpit and he was he was
[1:37:17] going to pray for the sick now i said oh
[1:37:19] just just a minute now he said i got to
[1:37:21] get myself out of the way
[1:37:22] he said this is not me this is him so he
[1:37:25] started to get myself out of the way
[1:37:27] he says so he can come and he said take
[1:37:29] over yeah
[1:37:30] and it happened and it wasn't william
[1:37:33] branham it was christ
[1:37:34] he said i can't do this i don't know how
[1:37:36] to do this he said but he does
[1:37:38] so he said i'm just going to let him do
[1:37:40] it amen so are we
[1:37:42] going to get ourselves out of the way
[1:37:43] and let jesus
[1:37:45] control our lives amen it's a life
[1:37:49] that you and yourself can't live but he
[1:37:52] can
[1:37:53] oh yeah amen if you let him he will
[1:37:57] by the grace of god amen bring out a
[1:38:00] spiritual life
[1:38:01] in you whether it's your job i don't
[1:38:04] care where it is
[1:38:06] i've had no problem with these things
[1:38:07] when it comes to the places i work
[1:38:09] and and yet all they knew was well he's
[1:38:12] a christian
[1:38:13] well yeah as i said i've been working

[1:38:42] because of my stand as a christian and
[1:38:45] to me to me it was just i was just going
[1:38:49] i was just being normal do you have so
[1:38:52] much of the holy ghost that the life you

[1:38:56] spiritual life you live is it's just
[1:38:58] normal
[1:38:59] why if you're born again you you've got
[1:39:01] that nature in you
[1:39:04] but unfortunately there's too many
[1:39:05] believers don't have the holy ghost
[1:39:07] nature they don't have god's nature

[1:42:46] to the altar
[1:42:47] and knelt down and i remember praying

[1:55:44] message i believe
[1:55:45] oh brother brown was a prophet but it's
[1:55:47] all intellectual
[1:55:48] like the prophet of god said that he was
[1:55:51] dealing with people even in his day even
[1:55:52] in brenham tabernacle and he said you're
[1:55:54] living by the
[1:55:56] the mechanics but not the dynamics oh
[1:55:58] yeah
[1:56:00] and again when we preached on it just
[1:56:01] recently here we were preached on a
[1:56:03] certain sermon that he preached
[1:56:05] and and we quoted it where he preached
[1:56:07] it in jeffersonville and he said
[1:56:08] he said now he said you got the dynamics
[1:56:10] but you don't have you got the mechanics
[1:56:12] but not the dynamics
[1:56:14] and he said in in your life oh yeah they
[1:56:17] add the word
[1:56:17] the mechanics of the word in their life
[1:56:20] in their in their in their minds
[1:56:22] but he said they didn't have the
[1:56:23] dynamics
[1:56:25] the power of the holy ghost in their
[1:56:28] souls
[1:56:31] oh yeah well no
[1:56:34] that was branham tabernacle yes
[1:56:37] but there were sinners there as well as
[1:56:39] their in in
[1:56:40] other denominational churches around the
[1:56:42] world at that time
[1:56:43] back then and listen yeah
[1:56:47] because how many left tabernacle
[1:56:50] when he preached married no when he
[1:56:52] preached church order
[1:56:56] a lot oh yeah when he preached church
[1:56:59] order
[1:57:01] well after by the next service i guess
[1:57:04] that not many but not as many came to
[1:57:07] the service
[1:57:08] why because because a lot of them left
[1:57:10] random tabernacle
[1:57:12] and went they went to another brothers
[1:57:14] tabernacle
[1:57:15] about eight eight miles or eight
[1:57:16] kilometers away another brother had a
[1:57:18] tab
[1:57:18] at a church there and he still got it
[1:57:20] there he's gone on but his church is
[1:57:22] still there
[1:57:22] and they left brenham tabernacle went to
[1:57:24] his church why
[1:57:26] because he didn't enforce church order
[1:57:30] whereas in random tabernacle it was
[1:57:31] enforced and he wouldn't stay
[1:57:33] under the leadership
[1:57:39] god help us amen
[1:57:42] yeah wow no you if they were all
[1:57:46] believers around town
[1:57:47] they wouldn't go you know they wouldn't
[1:57:50] but remember jesus had many many many
[1:57:53] disciples
[1:57:54] and jesus made some remarks about eating
[1:57:57] his flesh and drinking his blood
[1:57:59] and i think it was 80 around 80 i think
[1:58:03] of the disciples walked away and they
[1:58:06] said this is a hard shame he said who
[1:58:07] can take that
[1:58:09] oh yeah and they were numbered with the
[1:58:11] others that were given power to do this
[1:58:13] give them power to do that
[1:58:14] and they come back with a witness
[1:58:15] testimony oh yeah we did this we did
[1:58:17] this
[1:58:18] and then jesus said you know eating his
[1:58:20] flesh drink his blood oh
[1:58:22] what no this is a hard saying who can do
[1:58:26] this he said
[1:58:27] and i think 80 the bible says 80 of them
[1:58:29] turned around walked away
[1:58:33] yeah and when brother when brown
[1:58:34] tabernacle when brother branham released
[1:58:36] a priest church order
[1:58:38] many believers turned and walked away
[1:58:42] they didn't agree with it
[1:58:45] god help us don't walk away stay with
[1:58:49] the word
[1:58:50] amen
[1:58:54] you see verse 8 and the scripture
[1:58:58] foreseeing that god would justify the
[1:59:00] heathen
[1:59:02] through faith preached before the gospel
[1:59:05] unto abraham saying
[1:59:07] in thee shall all nations be blessed so
[1:59:09] then they which be of faith
[1:59:11] are blessed with faithful abraham for as
[1:59:14] many as
[1:59:15] are of the works of the law are under
[1:59:17] the curse
[1:59:18] for it is written cursed is every one
[1:59:20] that continueth
[1:59:22] not in all things which are written
[1:59:25] in the book of the law to do them amen
[1:59:29] and that no man is justified by the law
[1:59:31] in the sight of god
[1:59:32] it is evident for the just shall live
[1:59:37] by faith and the law is not of faith
[1:59:41] but the man that doeth them shall live
[1:59:44] in them
[1:59:44] by the grace of god amen go down to
[1:59:48] verse 22.
[1:59:52] but the scripture has concluded all
[1:59:54] under sin
[1:59:55] that the promise by faith of jesus
[1:59:58] christ
[1:59:59] might be given to them that believe
[2:00:02] but before faith came we were kept under
[2:00:06] the law
[2:00:07] shut up unto the faith which should
[2:00:10] afterwards be revealed
[2:00:12] wherefore the law was our schoolmaster
[2:00:14] to bring us unto christ
[2:00:16] that ye might be justified by faith
[2:00:20] thank god for faith brother if he
[2:00:22] requires it he's provided it
[2:00:24] amen but after that faith has come
[2:00:29] we are no longer under a schoolmaster
[2:00:32] amen for ye all
[2:00:36] year all the children of god by faith
[2:00:40] in christ jesus we're all the children
[2:00:43] of god
[2:00:44] by faith in christ jesus
[2:00:47] amen
[2:00:53] bear with me
[2:00:56] you don't have to turn to it i'll finish
[2:00:58] with this and i haven't even gotten to
[2:01:00] quotes boy scripture
[2:01:03] scripture if we go to a quote we're just
[2:01:06] trying to vindicate
[2:01:08] what you're saying you know but you got
[2:01:11] to come by the word
[2:01:13] amen appreciate our brother jonathan's
[2:01:15] ministry in
[2:01:16] scripture scripture scripture scripture
[2:01:18] it's amazing i say thank you lord
[2:01:20] amen and it's got to be the word there
[2:01:23] are those like i said i i was
[2:01:25] in a service one time and and this
[2:01:27] brother was going to preach and
[2:01:29] then he preached and do his full church
[2:01:31] and
[2:01:32] he got them priests amazing but
[2:01:37] he preached on a certain subject
[2:01:40] and i had the book in my bible and
[2:01:44] is that's funny was it
[2:01:48] prophet preached that and
[2:01:51] i open up that message oh that's where
[2:01:54] he is
[2:01:56] yeah and then oh yeah i can turn the
[2:01:58] page
[2:02:00] oh yeah she went on yeah oh
[2:02:04] oh he assumed he finished lord i just
[2:02:07] get into the last page
[2:02:09] oh yeah that's the way he preached as if
[2:02:11] he was preaching it
[2:02:13] as if it was his message but i
[2:02:15] discovered
[2:02:16] it was it was the prophet's message so
[2:02:18] brother
[2:02:19] god don't mean for us to do that no
[2:02:22] preach the word
[2:02:23] amen and then god will lead you to this
[2:02:25] quote that quote not only said that the
[2:02:27] prophet
[2:02:28] my prophet said this so he said you know
[2:02:30] and the
[2:02:31] and brother brown i don't think brother
[2:02:32] ryan might promise to do gold like that
[2:02:34] but he meant for us to go through the
[2:02:36] word the bible yeah
[2:02:38] that's what he would want us to do
[2:02:39] preach the preach what's in the bible
[2:02:41] give him a scripture out of the bible
[2:02:42] not oh uh i want to prove to you what
[2:02:45] you know what i'm talking about right
[2:02:46] here
[2:02:47] no no prove it here first and if you
[2:02:51] amen if you want and you want to
[2:02:52] vindicate it and
[2:02:54] what did brother brown say oh yes right
[2:02:55] here but like i said
[2:02:58] i said to preach it some years ago i
[2:03:00] said when it comes to the message of
[2:03:01] william branham
[2:03:02] i said you know i said for a lot of
[2:03:05] believers
[2:03:06] i said better i said if they started
[2:03:09] at the perm at the prayer lines and i
[2:03:12] said
[2:03:12] skip skip the message and i should just
[2:03:14] get to the prayer line
[2:03:16] because i knew i met believers oh that's
[2:03:18] all they were interested god did this
[2:03:20] oh yeah did you read that brother brown
[2:03:22] was praying for the sick and he prayed
[2:03:23] for this one
[2:03:24] and this happened and this happened that
[2:03:25] happened but when it comes to the
[2:03:27] message you preach
[2:03:28] they didn't they didn't know anything
[2:03:30] about it
[2:03:32] didn't put no answers on it just the
[2:03:34] prayer line and the healing
[2:03:36] well brother sister what god the reason
[2:03:38] god did that was to get our attention to
[2:03:40] this
[2:03:40] the word amen not william branham but
[2:03:44] jesus christ
[2:03:45] praise the lord i'll read one scripture
[2:03:48] here
[2:03:50] amen he's in the book of titus and he
[2:03:55] said the wit
[2:03:55] this witness is true wherefore rebuke
[2:03:59] them
[2:03:59] sharply that they may be sound
[2:04:03] in the faith amen
[2:04:06] brother the ministry is working on the
[2:04:09] faith
[2:04:11] the ministry is building up the faith
[2:04:13] the ministry is strengthening and
[2:04:15] encouraging the faith
[2:04:16] amen faith amen getting you to believe
[2:04:19] it
[2:04:20] stay with it stand on it testify of it
[2:04:24] well reflecting faith
[2:04:27] are you reflecting faith the the the
[2:04:30] dynamics of the word
[2:04:31] are just the mechanics of the word oh
[2:04:34] yeah
[2:04:34] and again the prophet highlighted in
[2:04:36] that message when he said
[2:04:38] he said you're putting two more chances
[2:04:39] on the mechanics and not enough on the
[2:04:42] dynamics
[2:04:43] he said because it takes the dynamics to
[2:04:45] bring the rapture
[2:04:47] amen it is the power of the revelation
[2:04:51] it is the power of the mechanics amen by
[2:04:54] the grace of almighty god
[2:04:56] amen
[2:05:02] it says unto the pure all things are
[2:05:06] pure
[2:05:07] but unto them that are defiled and
[2:05:09] unbelieving
[2:05:10] is nothing pure but even their mind
[2:05:13] and conscience is defiled
[2:05:16] they profess that they know god
[2:05:19] but in works they deny him
[2:05:23] being abominable and disobedient unto
[2:05:26] every good work
[2:05:27] reprobate god help us amen
[2:05:34] we believe god do we believe the message
[2:05:36] oh yes i read the message
[2:05:38] yeah do you believe the bible well i
[2:05:40] tell you this
[2:05:41] sometimes they'll take this and say i
[2:05:44] believe this i believe that
[2:05:46] but there's scriptures that i can give
[2:05:48] some believers
[2:05:50] but they won't they won't line up with
[2:05:52] it
[2:05:53] no no oh yeah because as i've heard
[2:05:57] people say believers say oh i'm a
[2:05:59] believer i'm a believer i'm a believer
[2:06:01] yet there are scriptures there that i
[2:06:03] know that they are not in line with
[2:06:06] oh yeah oh i believe that i believe that
[2:06:08] yeah but when it comes to
[2:06:10] certain scriptures here where god says
[2:06:12] do this do this
[2:06:13] god's looking for this in your heart and
[2:06:15] your soul because you if you profess to
[2:06:17] have the holy ghost
[2:06:18] not you that lives christ lives in you
[2:06:20] and if it's christ in you
[2:06:21] well he's going to do this he's going to
[2:06:24] do it according to the word
[2:06:25] he's going to do according to the will
[2:06:26] of god
[2:06:29] yeah and there's there's things in here
[2:06:31] that christians
[2:06:32] do and should do and yet there's a lot
[2:06:35] of believers
[2:06:36] ignores it oh we got the message so we
[2:06:38] don't have to do this we don't have to
[2:06:40] do that
[2:06:41] huh god's going to require of them one
[2:06:43] day
[2:06:46] yeah because why because they wouldn't
[2:06:48] do it
[2:06:50] oh yeah they they had the letter of the
[2:06:52] word but not the spirit of it
[2:06:54] so god's grace to us so god bless us and
[2:06:57] again we'd love to continue that on the
[2:06:58] sunday
[2:06:59] and we'll see amen i was thinking lord i
[2:07:03] said

[2:07:14] said oh my no i said it's not enough
