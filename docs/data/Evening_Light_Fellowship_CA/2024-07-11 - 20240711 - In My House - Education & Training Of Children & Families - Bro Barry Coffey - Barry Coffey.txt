marvelous you are amen God bless you welcome each one here tonight just want to make a couple of updates and announcements I went in to see brother Jim on Monday and he was looking a lot better he had some color back he wasn't looking as gray but still feeling weak and then of course he he gave an update today that they're hoping to discharge him tomorrow so we thank the Lord for that that he's still with us he said I I don't feel the Lord's done with me yet and so that's good brother Jim's always working he's faithful no matter where he goes so we're thankful to see that but just want to keep him in prayer he's got to stick around for another two weeks before they'll allow him to fly so uh we can expect to probably see see him in at least one service before he goes but keep him in the family in prayer he's got four of his kids here and his wife's here as well so he's got lots of support and lots of care um so I'm sure he'll he'll do well certainly wanted to thank each one of you for your help during the services this weekend and food and fellowship and help and the specials it's it's a group effort and uh it can't happen unless we all put our shoulder to the wheel so I know I saw everyone pretty much doing something at some point and including our visitor sister Roberta doing 9,000 meatballs for the uh for the visitors so we thank each one that did that I mean I told sister Priscilla I thought that was the best I'd heard the choir and we've had some really good ones and I thought it was really really well done and certainly the uh the brunch on on Saturday was uh certainly an overachievement if there was ever one uh from the vision that the brothers had to the execution the sisters had was quite a gap um and I think it was a it was in a good direction so thank you for managing that amen and then of course we saw our sister Becky do her debut song from her first album here as well so we appreciate that and Trust will hear many more of those then certainly want to welcome brother Barry coffee here and no stranger to most of us and uh certainly appreciate appreciate him taking a service while he's on his anniversary you know vacation and these things I was telling him in there I know that when I go on vacation I don't want to preach and so I know the sacrifice when somebody does agree to preach and uh we don't get many ministers is rolling through here so we certainly like to take advantage of the opportunity if they're willing so he's willing tonight so let's sing that song thank you Jesus for the grace that you have given us amen let's just thank him for what he's done for us and let's welcome him into the service let's just focus on the word let's pull on the word amen and see what God would have for us this evening amen thank you Jesus for the grace that you have given us though I can't repay but from my heart I'd like to say that I thank you thank thank you my [Music] Jes my heart [Music] join me in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity we have to be able to gather in your house to assemble in your name with confidence and Assurance Lord that you said you'd meet with us Whenever two or three are gathered in your name and Lord You Have Not only been Faithful over this last weekend Lord you've been Faithful over many many years and we thank you for that and we never want to take that for granted now have your way Lord we pray tonight anoint our hearts our minds Lord you take this service now from me and I Just Surrender it to you Lord I have notes and things but Lord you have the hearts of the people and Lord that's more important and so I Surrender myself to you Lord I also pray that you would forgive us of anything that might hinder the moving of the Holy Spirit and Lord Just Have Your Way among us tonight we thank you Lord Jesus for your many blessings and we thank you for our message that has made the word so alive to us have your way we pray in the name of Jesus Christ and For Your Glory we ask these things amen and amen while you're standing let's take your Bible uh just because uh just because because it's a good thing to do first uh everything I'm going to talk about Lord willing uh is going to be on the board so you can follow me and I will probably go fast uh through some of this here because uh this is um there's just there's just a lot of things that we could talk about under this subject or under this Banner here tonight so Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 4 when you have it say Amen in the meantime say I love my Bible most of you said it how many have it how many have Ephesians 6 and four that's a good enough number and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated uh I preached on my honeymoon so I might as well preach on my 40th um but it it it's been an honor to be up here uh with you to to do both things to celebrate our 40th and uh to have uh just to step back and spend time with sister Becky and her 40 years I've been extremely blessed uh over those 40 years I consider her every day to be an answer to prayer and I thank God for that uh but it's also an honor to be here for the dedication and I'd have to say it was a great dedication I've been to a lot of dedications I have uh I'm scheduled to do more dedications one in Dublin Ireland in a month or two and uh different places and uh I I will tell you that uh it was it was a wonderful uh wonderful time I felt like uh we got it done I felt like we we got it done that's how I felt like it we we the church the church is dedicated but get it out of your mind that that you know we're focused on the building you're the church and uh that's what God's always interested in dedicating and rededicating so uh we thank God for the building but you're the church and you're still under construction uh for sure uh I I'd like to say this that uh you know you have a great opportunity to make a mark on a new generation and uh John that's why you're here you may not know that but that's why you're here brother Gerald made a a mark on a previous generation and now we're 40 years beyond that and uh you have an opportunity you have a new generation rising up God gave you this billing for a purpose and uh we always don't know that purpose you know we think we're making decisions about things and we really don't know what we're uh what we're agreeing to uh but we just walk by faith and we trust God for the outcomes and that's that's really all that we can do um and and so uh I I would I would just really pray and and encourage you to make a uh make a mark in this community uh in in this uh time we live in uh you are uh standing as a a church in newfinland that um uh that is strong and uh I believe centered on the word and that's a great compliment and uh I know that uh you know it's not always been the testimony of all the churches uh but I'm I'm thankful for the testimony here thankful for brother Gerald and his dedication and vision and uh the work that he did and the um uh it took a special man to deal with us in our early days and uh as I look out over my two brothers painfully I I I think back of those days you know when uh just just how far you've come in music alone because uh you know on Harvey Road when we were there it was our basement first it was Harvey Road second downtown and duck Street third then Plymouth Road but I remember in uh in Harvey Road uh when we were there it was me first it was me Mark and Mom and uh we we would and then Bob and Brenda of course came along and uh we didn't have a great repertoire of Music we didn't have any instruments we didn't have any musical sense and we'd sing Amazing Grace only because we heard Willie Nelson sing it a long time ago and uh then we learned songs from Brother tapes and uh built from there but you know it was sparse until sister Betty rolled in and and uh played the Oregon forest and those were meager beginnings and now you're singing songs that I've never heard of before and it's just uh it's just wonderful uh your worship is your worship is refreshing and and you know what if we can like the worship you can imagine how much he must like it the Bible says he Delights in the Praises of his people and uh I just say this that uh I I want to say a personal thank you because I know local folks don't always get a whole lot out of dedication meetings when you served as much food as you did and worked as hard as you did and nobody gets enough sleep kids don't get enough sleep and they're cranky and husbands are cranky anyway and local people work hard during uh local meetings and I know that and as a lot goes on behind the scenes and everybody's you know impressed with the visitors and all of that but uh local people need need to be thanked specifically for the work you do and uh you know sometimes you just you just throw your hands up in the ear and say hey we'll go back and listen to the tapes because you tend to miss out on a lot because you're sitting there thinking wow do we have enough meatballs right or did I buy enough paper cups and you know you're sitting there going through all that stuff and uh you know it it's that that's just a fact of life so uh I just want to say personally from Sister Becky and I we we thank you for the hospit ality we felt and uh it it all went it all went well now uh brother John asked me to speak tonight and I I thought I would uh I just I labored a little bit over this and I I just want to say this that I've been on two series back home and one is uh dealing with the the harvest principle the fact that we've come to the Harvest Time and at the Harvest Time the Bible says that the husbandman takes the uh the the precious fruit of the earth into the Garner and so that's what we're that's where we're at we're at we're at a Harvest Time Harvest time is not a day Harvest time is a season and everything changes in the harvest season so uh you know we we know we're moving from here to there right so we have this thing going on and whether it's here or there or there doesn't really matter it's From Here to Eternity it's from here to that Kingdom right and so the way we get there is by faith because that's how Enoch got there and he's our type right so by faith Enoch was transl ated and uh and yet before he was translated he had this testimony that he pleased God so the testimony of pleasing God was in his walk so that was this that's this Direction all right we got that but we have this too so as long as we're here we got to walk in a way that's pleasing to God so Lord help us to walk this way because that comes before that he no good to just be focused on that you got to have this too right and so uh those are two series that I've been working on and I thought uh I'd just uh dip into this one here tonight on on the uh the the this part okay which is the Practical part uh some of you have raised your children obviously I'm looking at some older folks here uh the assembly and you may think oh well this doesn't have really much to do with me but it you cannot separate the principle of family within the church and within your house we are all a family and the the body of Christ the local Body of Christ is only a bunch of families that come together and and become the church family right it's families who come together and become a different kind of family and we're all a part of a family uh connected to the body of Christ which is connected in eternity to all the ages and it's all family stuff so Family Matters and it matters to God there's an awful lot in scripture uh about about families and and about how uh the order of things and I I love to watch and look and see God's order of things so in the in second Timothy Paul tells us and this of course is the basis upon which we uh make decisions about our family and about our uh Earthly walk here that from a child thou H has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus well the scripture is able to do that hearing the word is able to change you right it's able ble to make you wise on the salvation and all scripture by the way all scripture is given by the Breath of God the inspiration of God the Numa and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness all scripture is good for this so that 17 the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works so we go from a child to a man perfect am that's what that's what it's doing here that's what Paul is doing he's summarizing here from a child God began your instruction this way with the scripture the scripture is able to transform you so that you become this and God is always interested in developing your character because a character is the is a thing the only thing you're going to take with you but your legacy is what you're going to leave behind right characters what you take Legacy is what you leave behind brother Gerald leaves behind a legacy right I leave behind a legacy I uh we we all have something that we leave behind and I trust that i' I'm going to leave it behind in my children first of all and then in in the people who I've ministered to over the years and so uh that's an important thing but let me assure you God has an order right and everybody's involved in this whether you want like it or not the head of Christ is God the head of the man is Christ right and in in in the on the next lower level uh the head of the man is Christ the head of the woman is the man and children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right and all the children said no no no all the children said they said we hope he goes away cuz he's going to bring stuff that we're not going to like hey I I know how this works so I've i' I developed this uh this this particular series called the Christian family and it outlines a lot of the principles that uh Christian families employ uh in in raising children and through wisdom is in house building and understanding it is established and and this is uh uh this was Solomon now talking about families and talking about how important this is because even though it may not have been the case in his day our world is falling apart and as a result of that all the graphs look like this all the graphs tend to look like this this is a percentage of families that are one parent families and they all kind of look like this where you have number of divorces number of uh single parent families number of uh you know gay families and all the rest of it it's all going off to charts and and this is a graph sorry for the small print starts in 1950 over on the left side and it goes to 2010 as you go from 2010 to present in the 14 years it goes way up okay exponentially it goes way up and uh this this is the world that we live in so I wanted to go back and I wanted to dig through this because no one ever taught me this but I wanted to find out uh you know what does God really intend for fathers and for families and what's in the mind of God here in relation to this and one number one first thing I want to say is that uh father's principal three UH responsibilities were number one to raise his uh children with a tradeit or a skill and he had to uh he had to teach a child a sense of responsibility uh you're the one that's got to get out of the cave kill something and drag it back for the family cuz uh the the family depends on you and so you've got to you got to learn to work you got to be responsible and you got to learn to be a good Steward over your time and your talents and your Fir and your crops and your income and you got to pay tithes and you got to you got to do that so you had to raise your child uh with a Trader of skills that came behind you like Joseph had Jesus in the carpenter shop second thing was he had he was an ambassador for marriage to his children he had to demonstrate what it was to be a real husband he had to demonstrate what it was to be a a family man this is how we deal with crisis in the family this is how we deal with uh money problems in the family this is what we deal when we have this is how we deal with things when we have spiritual issues that come up trouble in the church or something else he had to give a a correct interpretation or Preparation to his children for marriage and let them go into that and they would know uh they would know how to how to handle themselves I say it this way so follow me here as I use this expression my ceiling should be my boy's platform I figured out that my ceiling as high as I go in raising my children that should be their platform in other words when they get married they should not have to drop down to learn all the basics about life and so forth they should already know that because of the home they came out of okay so they don't have to drop down here learn everything and then grow my my ceiling should be their platform to build on I hope that makes sense third thing they had to instruct by word and practice a knowledge of the word of God if you don't listen to anything else that I tell you tonight I would say this that the one of the most important things that parents need to do is to instill in their children a respect for the Bible because when you lose respect for the Bible everything changes and everything goes down and you're not going to make it if your children don't respect the Bible and there's not much even and I say this respectfully I'm not being critical I don't have an ax to grind I'm not mad you might look at my face and think I am but I'm not but I will tell you this that does not preach very much in in in the message Community but I think we need to be sure that our children have uh and instill in them a respect for the Bible because if you just live by Bible principles alone paying your tithes and living in uh Holiness and treating your wife right and all the rest of it God will bless you don't tell me he doesn't right because you go back and look at a story like non he's a he's a you know a Syrian officer who lives to fight against Israel but he obeys God and you know what he gets healed he walks away with something and so if nothing else your children should walk away with a uh with a a decent respect for for the scripture and I think that's an important thing so brother brandom says it like this and this is a a little dramatization that he does he says uh one day when had uh come in and he set me upon the bow of the boat and said Simon my little boy so he's he's paraphrasing a conversation between Simon's father and Peter Peter is Simon and they're in the boat out one day waiting for the fish to come and he says Simon my little boy Daddy has always believed that someday the Messiah would come and all of us Jewish people look for that and perhaps I won't see him but Simon when he comes there'll be a lot of stuff go out before he comes it'll cause the whole country to be confused us but Simon I want you to be taught now how good it would be if we American people would teach our children such things instead of buying him a cell phone I'm sorry it doesn't say that teach him a tap dancing and rock and roll and stuff we do today and just let them join the church but tell them what to look for so in other words in other words we are given as parents an intergenerational respons responsibility to pass on to things of God we've experienced let me say it again we've been given an intergenerational responsibility to pass on to our children the things that we've experienced and the things we know because you know what you're the best person to influence your children in thing in the things of God and the things of the Kingdom you're the best person they not going to get it on social media they not going to get it in school right come on they're not going to get it on on on television or something like that they're not going to get it from their buddies they're going to get they're going to get knowledge of the kingdom and they're going to know more about God from you than from anyone else and you say well all right that sounds good Dr Dobson all right let's look in the scripture and see where it says it David says in Psalm 78 I will open my mouth I will open my mouth in a parable and I'll utter dark sayings of old which we have which we have heard and known David says we've heard and known this and our fathers have told us we know what we know because our fathers told us and we will not hide them from our children showing to the generation to come the Praises of our of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he has done stop you should be able to have a testimony that you can share with your children hey I remember when we were first married we had nothing but you know what God saw us through and I remember when uh we had a little baby and it had a fever burning up and we prayed and asked God and we called a pastor and he prayed and God did something for that little child and I'll tell you what we believe God's A Healer today it's hey it's not way off here great Mysteries here it it is a stuff that we saw God do are you with me it's a stuff that God did in our household showing to the generation to come the Praises of our Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he has done for he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel which he commanded our fathers he commanded our fathers that they should make them known unto their children hey I'm reading the scripture now that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born when you raise your children right you're actually influencing your grandchildren he's he's David is including the children which should be born they're not born yet who should arise and declare them to their children that they might set their hope that they might we already have our hope in God because our fathers influenced us and now I'm telling you this cuz I want to influence you for the kingdom of God that you might influence your children for for God that they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God but keep his Commandments you know what that is that's an intergenerational responsibility to share the exploits of our God to those that God has given you as children and grandchildren I've I I I travel the the world and I I've been blessed to be able to minister to families and married couples all over the world and I always tell people wherever I go I said I wanted to uh one of my goals in teaching this is not to make you like me and not to make your family like my family that's not my goal I'm not trying to make you like Americans CU I'm an American now but I'm not trying to do that what I'm trying to do is get you to live according to the scripture that's that's what I'm trying to I'm trying to influence you by the word of God but the second thing I'm trying to do is to enjoy my grandchildren that's what I told people all over the world I want to enjoy my grandchildren well how do you enjoy your grandchildren you raise your kids right because if you raise them right they're going to tell they're going to tell their kids about the exploits of our God right they're going to tell they're going to tell their kids about the strength of God and the and the glory of God and the power of God they're going to do that so raising your children right will it give you a better assurance that you'll be able to enjoy your grandchildren and I will tell you by God's grace I enjoy your grand our grandchildren I love it okay you say well this is Old Testament here's Paul saying in 2 Timothy Chapter 2 he says Thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men you got it it's not just for you it is for those that you are now an influence to does that make sense let's look at it again Titus Chapter 2 and Paul writes to the church in in in U on the under Titus at the aged women likewise that they be in behavior is becometh Holiness not false accusers not much W not given to much wine sisters teachers of good things that they may teach their young women hey there you go it does not say that they that the pastors teach the young women it doesn't say that it doesn't say that the five-fold ministry does that you know who it is it's moms and grandmas who are doing this believers who by their testimony are solid in the the Lord and so therefore we should be teaching our daughters how to how to do more than just be on social media and be on Facebook all day we should be teaching them how to be sober love their own husbands love their children be discreet Chase keepers at home all the rest of it here that the word of God be not blasphemed that's a strong sentence that's a strong statement all right so here's what I'm going to try to do and I can't do it all here tonight but uh we'll just try to see how far we can get number one in my house then here's the here's the commission okay here's the Mandate in my house I want to make my house not just a house but a dwelling place for God a place where the holy spirit's always welcome now I've looked at my job description as a parent I've checked it many times I've gone through scripture gone through everything brother brandom said and I looked for my job description as a dad and on that list I have never found it where I am a savior I'm not my children's savior never have been God didn't give me the job and so therefore I can't save my children I can't force them to believe I can't force them to be born again cuz I'm not a savior right I can't forgive them of their sins and I can't change their bodies at the end I can't do that it's not on my job description but I'll tell you what I can do I can create an atmosphere in my home where the holy spirit's always welcome to come and do what he is supposed to do and that is convict the hearts of my children and we saw that in our household and we're so thankful for that so therefore you've got say you got to make a conscious decision because nobody's going to make this for you you've got to say as for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord we're going to put a door we're going to put a a barrier between ourselves and the world that's number two a place that's separate from Sodom we're going to make our home our front door dividing line between Sodom and we're going to control what comes in here we can't control what goes on out there but we're going to control what happens in here and we're going to filter all the ways that the world will try to get in because if you don't be proactive in this area the world will get in it'll get in through phones it'll get in through media it'll get in through all kinds of other things all kinds of other ways and so therefore you got to be separate from Sodom separation is a real precious thing and it's a deep thing a lot deeper than what I ever thought about when I began to research it and that's another sermon the third thing is that we want to make a our home a place where preparations are made to leave this world all right now here's the example you remember in the first Exodus uh in in in the the time of Moses there uh and Moses began to call for plagues you remember that and uh uh every day that they every Saturday because they went to church on Saturday every Saturday when they went to church uh they had uh a plague you know like uh we're going to have Darkness today Moses called for darkness and all the people man nobody fell in nobody fell asleep in church that day as they're looking out over over from Goan they're looking out over Egypt and all the darkness you know and then they're all in light and then okay let's let's have a hymn and we'll close and go home so they went home and then the next Saturday they come out and then they're looking out at the Rivers and they all turn to blood or flies or all the cattle all of a sudden I'd fall down but it take too long to get up and and and every every Saturday they went to church and then came came and at the end of church and sang a course and went home but the last one was different the last one Moses said the death angel is going to pass over Egypt all of Egypt not just there but here too so now goed wasn't exempt right just because they were in the message now they were not exempt from the last plague the last plague meant that the death angel was going to visit every home so therefore they had to go home they had to take that message home with with them and apply it in their house and they had to clean it a certain way and they had to get certain food from the market and they had to prepare it a certain way and they had to dress in their house a certain way with her staff in their hand and their shoes on their feet and they had to put blood they had to apply the token on their house because you know what it didn't matter whether you lived in Jeffersonville and it didn't matter whether you hand had a handful of dirt or a piece of wood floor from Brother bram's office it didn't matter whether he had that it mattered whether he had the token that was the only thing that mattered and the Death Angel wasn't looking at the amount of mission work you did and the size of your church and how many square feet you got he wasn't looking at that he was looking at the blood that's all he was looking at the blood and they had to take that word home and they had to apply it in their own household in their own household they had to apply it and they couldn't just leave it at church they had to go home I believe we're at that point where we got to take this message home with us and apply it in our lives in our house you got to have the token applied there not just here because everybody's acting pretty good here I mean no one's hitting anybody and no one's poking anybody or Mo she is but o other than that other than that it's generally pretty sane here right and everybody acts like christian sings like Christian looks like Christian not hard here as you're among Believers right but this is not where the this is not where the battles are fought this is not the trench folks if you haven't figured that out the trench warfare goes on in your house in your school at your work and The Temptations that's where they really come so so this is in my house we've got to think about this this a little bit differently now because it's not just a place anymore and it's not just a kitchen anymore it is a it is a household for God it is a tabernacle where God should be welcome anytime whatever whatever way whatever time that he wants to show up we want to make sure there's nothing going on that's going to grieve him we want him him to be ble to flow through anytime that he wants to do that right are we okay so again we come back to fathers here in in Ephesians 6:4 and fathers provoke not your children to wrath you know why Paul says that is because you can you can provoke your children to wrath I mean if you couldn't provoke your children to wrath he wouldn't have said this just like uh he said grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby your seal is the day of your Redemption you know why he said that because you can't grieve the h ho spirit and if you've ever grieved the Holy Spirit you know what I'm talking about you don't need anybody to explain what it's like to grieve the holy spirit because we probably all have grieve the Holy Spirit well you can provoke your children to wrath if you got two children and you show favoritism to one you can provoke the other one to wrath right and when you when you uh uh you know Discipline Your Child unfairly uh you can G grieve those children right hey come on up here you you thank you for volunteering come on up here and your name is Gabe H welcome aboard I needed a helper sit right there so let's say Gabriel Here comes home from school and uh he's uh so this is just an example of one way that you can uh you can teach your children okay there there are two but this is the example of one so he comes home and he says Ah hey hey Dad um ah I got a question for you now he's nervous just like he is now and uh because he doesn't know what's coming he doesn't know how dad's going to react right but I'm I'm a type a person I'm pretty busy and so I'm just going through he says hey Dad what um and and uh all all the guys at at school um they're gonna they're gonna wear a simple tattoo just for this year now it's not a permanent one it's just a temporary one and um like would it be all right would it be all right if I wore the T I mean if uh you wouldn't see it at church because I have long sleeves on so nobody would see it but would that be all right well there's two ways I can answer that right okay so sorry for being dramatic here but there's two ways that I can answer this and I could say number one I could say you what you what a tattoo you can't be serious that you're asking me about wearing a tattoo do you realize where people who wear tattoos go do you realize what happens to people who do that kind of thing how can you be in church how how can you be in church that long and not know nothing about tattoos you are a disgrace to this family oh now that's one way I could answer the question there is another way that I can answer the question right he says the same thing to me and I can say whoa whoa like your grandfather like grandfather says Whoa and and I I could say w no one's ever asked me that all right I'll tell you what I'll tell you what hang on till after supper and I'll get my Bible and I'll show you where this is and so after supper we sit down and say this is not my rule okay tattoos are not my deal uh but here it is in the scripture because the Bible says that we're not supposed to put any markings on on our skin and so forth and uh it's it's pretty clear it was an Old Testament principle and uh that that moral order carried over in the New Testament and Jesus had that and uh you know brother Braham doesn't say a whole lot about it because it wasn't really a big issue uh back in his day but uh you know we don't do it and we look at brother random and he didn't do it and so uh you know there's there's the the that is a sense of Separation the symbol of separation from the world and we don't do it everybody else is doing it but this is a this is an instance where you can make a stand and you can you know establish your testimony in the class and say hey guys you know what there's a line there's a line here and I'm willing to stand behind that line I know I'm going to stand out but you know what uh so you know what I'm doing I'm discipling him right a disciple is one who's taught and you know what in the first instance he really didn't hear anything hardly after I spit all over him because when your mind goes through that it's fight ORF flight and he's in defense mode and he doesn't hear a thing you could put a blood pressure cuff on him and his blood pressure go through the roof and he literally has got chemicals going through his body that will prevent him from remembering anything I said and the only thing he wants to do is get away that's the only thing he's thinking about I got to flight I got to flee I got to get out of there and I never ask Dad a question like that again cuz he's going to be like a bear and chew my head off but if he has another question now he might come back and ask me again if I do it this second way does that make sense thanks buddy so that's in a sense that's what that scripture means that we're not we're going to respond in a way that doesn't provoke him to wrath doesn't turn him away okay but now here's what I wanted to get to that's not what I wanted to tell you about but here's what I want to get to is that alternatively instead of provoking wrath bring them up this way and there's two words here that are really important nurture and admonition the word admonition is a simple one and we'll deal with that first it simply means to warn okay so you bring your children up to admonish them and and when you admonish them you're going to warn them so here's an example of the same word First Corinthians neither murmur as some of them did also murmured when they were destroyed or to destroy he's talking about children of Israel wandering in the desert now all these things happen unto them the Israelites for examples and they are written for our warning ah got to I got to warn you folks the same God that dealt with them back there that's the same God we're dealing with today and he's the same yesterday today and forever and I got to warn you that if you mess with him and murmur and you start you know criticizing Moses and his family ah God may just do the same thing again I'm just warning you I can't cause this but I'm just warning you and and they are written all those examples in the Old Testament are written that they might warn you especially you who upon the ends of the world have come so here's brother brandom now and he says now we have Fellowship one with another uh when the blood cleanses us from all unrighteousness and I I have nothing against denominations he says education song festivals joining church or whatever it's all right but it'll never produce all of that stuff will never produce until the blood's been applied and I got the next sentence in Bowl so watch it the blood applied to the human heart will always bring a result you know why because the life's in the blood and when there's a quickening that goes on and a person's underneath the blood now it's not me but it's Christ that lives in me and that's the difference so you you'll know and and this is where uh the Harvest thing comes in because I I took a a grain and I put it on the screen and blew it all up and magnified it and there's only 3% of that grain that has life in it the rest of it is all the same as all the hybrid seeds it's only this 3% that has the dunamis the energy in it and that's what'll reproduce and so the brother bram's telling us very clearly here that it's not uh programs it's not Church activity it's not song fests and it's not having the biggest church here I mean that's nice and he's saying it's nice it's all right but you'll never reproduce Christ with just that you'll never reproduce Christ by sitting in the church or having all the message books on your shelf it it's it's an encounter with God kids hear me it's an encounter with God you have to have a personal meeting with God and a and a conversion and a conversion means that there's a death burial and resurrection and you know what All Things become new and and there's nothing short of that do you we're not going to educate anybody Beyond around that it's a new birth it's an encounter with God period and that's what he's telling us so we don't we're not I'm not I'm not trying to tell you this so you learn how to be Christians here I I believe that the the the possibility of being a Christian is already in you it just needs to be quickened but remember now why are we talking about families because you want to create an atmosphere in your house that where the Holy Spirit comes in and does his job that's not on your job list are we all right so one of the things that is important to teach kids and and kids listen to this because it'll save your parents a lot of wind be not deceived God is Not mocked for whoso whatsoever a man sth that shall he also reap and if you're going to learn that principle and respect for the scripture and you know what I know a guy some of you probably know the the brother uh who was a fine he's a fine brother and uh lives in out in western Canada but in his worldly days uh he got involved with a young girl and that girl transmitted a sexual disease to him that is incurable and he still has that disease now he's converted he's in the message he's a song leader great guy great guy but he still has that disease and that marks him because he has he has labored with this thing about whether he you know getting married and all the rest of it and it's been a real trial for him it's been a real tough thing and and it is because you reap what you sow and and a a new birth doesn't always take away all of our past right cuz you know what you're still a you're still a coffee and you're still a klet you know and and and this is something that you know even if you're just if kids if you're just here you know because your mom and Paul told you to be here let me tell you God is Not mocked and if you don't remember anything else or take anything else away you're going to reput your soul so s good things because it'll make a difference now I got to tell you this that when it comes to families too and I'll just throw this in for for you for you four up here in the front that men are different than women so when it comes to dealing with uh issues men think differently than women right you know men are men men and women around different thermostats right why do you think who do you think invented the Dual thermostats in a car it was a married man right she says I'm freezing over here it's freezing absolutely freezing he says I'm I'm boiling up here over here well too bad you don't have your own thermostat over there H ding right men are different than women and it's just the way God made them so you get a you get a a balanced perspective when you're when you're uh in your home trying to make things uh work out and uh you know it adds the spice it adds the color uh in marriage it sure surely does and so uh marriage was God's idea right it was God's idea and by the way this is Brother Lonnie Jenkins graphic so the male brain is geared slightly more towards math and logic right like brother Mark over here doesn't have an emotional bone in his body the [Laughter] female Hold on Sister Marine the female brain is geared a little bit more towards language I'm just I mean this is just science right sorry maybe I should have picked another couple here so a man's brain is wired a little bit differently than he has a pretty good Central section for food for math Building Systems he has a very little dot in there for for listening skills and a very small one for house cleaning he has a large section for selective hearing and all the wives said yeah you're better believe it and uh you know he's got a car fixation section he's got a tool section he's got a little dot in there for chores but is the building supplies are pretty big and that's just the way a man's brain is wired a woman's brain is different she has a large chocolate Center she has the indecision Center is rather large too um Telephone social media it's large uh listening is it's there sense of direction neuron is a a pinpoint and uh jealousy is a commanding thing and I love the shoe and handbag coordination Center that's that's important right uh you you know the shopping Gene anyway all I'm saying is that men are different and women are wired differently and they do things differently they shop differently I don't know if you noticed that they shop quite differently now this is a a uh I I used to teach this and then I found a diagram and I thought this is great somebody else thought of it thought of it too now when I shop I'm a Hunter and I I go in the mail see the mail on the right side over there or on your on the right side and I need a pair of pants well I'll go in I'll park at the door nearest to the store store I want to go to right and I'll go in that door I'll go in the you know one turn Bo there in the store I'll find an employee first I'll say where are the pants for me uh right here sir they're on the mannequin take them off the mannequin here we go out 6 minutes $33 I'm out the door right victory is mine victory is mine now when my wife and I would go shopping she'll go in she'll go in the front door and say oh now that I meant to go here and she'll turn right and she'll go all through the mall and pick up stuff and she oh so and so's birthday's coming and we got a wedding in the church and sister such and such is having a baby and blah blah blah so we come to the end of her time and we have three hours spend 26 minutes and $876,000 I'm not making a joke or anything but this is scientifically proven okay that men's uh thinking is very spatial it's segmented and and in their minds they think in boxes okay so this is the way it is so if the wife says we got to do something about these kids he goes right to the kids box and he says all right what do we need to do he's the Marines he comes in all right hit hit hit hit you know kids get out here bang in the rooms El they go all right honey what's next he's got that box ticked right that's the way men are and everything in his life is in a box women don't have separations they don't have those little lines that run between there so they tend to look like this so if I ask brother Mark a question how much money is in the bank at the church he'll go boom right to that box $ 3829 bang close the door gone if I asked sister Marine over here sister Marine um how'd you enjoy church well I I I just I was just saying to the kids the other day and you know what at church we had uh a minister that was talking about things and I wasn't really sure what I was going to wear to church but uh you know here we are and we had a dinner after you know and I figured out what we're going to have for dinner afterwards but me and Mark you know we get along pretty good but on this one particular topic you know there's a little bit of a difference here and uh you know uh it's just amazing and I read this on social media same thing so you see what she's doing she's going all over the place because she doesn't have lines I'm not I'm not criticizing her or him it's just that's science that's just the way it is so all I'm saying to you is that when it comes to how uh a a wife will look at the problem in a household or a need to change she'll look at it differently than how a man will and that's just the way that it is so now let's get let's get back on track your fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture let's talk about nurture nurture is a great word and I'm going to talk all about nurture for the rest of this service here as long as we've gotten I don't know how long we've got when do we start seven oh you're just saying that because you're the pastor did you start at s y all right so nurture means the whole training and education of children related to the cultivation of minds and morals using commands admonitions reprove or punishment or whatever whatever you need to do to train your children it includes training care of the body cleaning up your room giving a mature and seeing the chore accomplished instruction aimed at increasing virtue so parents are going to use whatever it takes in order to to to begin that character development in their children that's what this word nurture means and it's not going to happen overnight it's not going to happen in one setting it's going to happen over time God gives you that time to be able to uh begin the process of doing this now God takes over right because once they get married or they feel like I hey I got the World by the tail I'm out of here I'm gone I'm married whatever else you know and they think they're they're they're ready now to handle life God knocks on the door and says ever heard of adoption but it also includes the definition also includes whatever in adults cultivates the soul especially by correcting mistakes and curving passions and if you ad adults don't make any more mistakes I'd like to talk to you after church but we still make mistakes we still say stuff we wish we never said we still do things we never want really want to do and so whatever and this is where this word is important whatever in adults and God will use whatever he's really good at using things around you that you never thought he'll uh you know he'll use your job or he'll use your children or he'll use your finances or he'll use an incident at church or whatever whatever to cultivate the Soul by correcting mistakes and curving passions God will do that now one of the first things that you have to learn about this whole process of transformation are youall still okay everybody all right watch in Deuteronomy Deuteronomy is great because Moses is teaching the people how they're going to live in a land they're not in yet he's on this side of the river Jordan and he's telling them you're going there here's how you're supposed to live there which is exactly in a sense what this message is doing and what what preaching does It prepares us for another place we're not being conditioned to live here outside of learning how to you know the Christian walk but we're being prepared for another kingdom right God is God is molding and shaping us for another kingdom how he's doing that is he's teaching us to live by the word so we live by the word here because you're going to live by the word over there right so he says this in in Deuteronomy 6:17 and by the way the book of Deuteronomy incidentally happens to be the book that Jesus quoted most of of all the Old Testament books it's a great book ye shall diligently keep the Commandments of the Lord your God and His testimonies and statutes which he commanded thee go back and read it again ye shall keep the Commandments of the Lord You're G read it again ye shall keep it because you're never going to be able to pass it onto your children until you have it in your heart 20 starts the family stuff and when thy son ask thee in time to come why don't we wear a tattoo why can't we go to a movie theater why don't we do this why don't we do that why do we have to wear our hair this way right when thaty son ask thee questions up the road uh you you're going to uh you know you're going to have the the the answer here but you know where it's got to be first it's got to be in your heart first you shall keep diligently and if you don't have it in your heart your kids will figure that out pretty quickly because listen the distance between your life and the book will influence your children if the book says this and you live here your children will respect more what you say but when the book says this and you're living over here they're looking at that saying you're not doing what this is and you know what they're going to say next I don't want to be a part of something that makes me like that can I go on all right I'm sorry there's all kinds of things here that I told you it was a series in the Book of Job it says in chapter one I I find job an incredibly intriguing book I don't understand it very much I'll be honest with you I don't understand it in all my studies I've only gotten to chapter one uh but there's some amazing things here and this is where God and Satan have a conversation about job and Satan says H that not made a hedge around about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side so who made the Hedge God did because Hedges are good I said Hedges are good Hedges tend to keep the bad guy out and keep the good people within sight and hedges are good and they're good and God believes in Hedges cuz he put one around job and when God puts you behind the Hedge you're pretty safe I'd rather be behind the Hedge that God makes to not have a hedge at all or find a way to break through it cuz you're going to get in trouble when you break through it so Satan is saying that you know job is almost Untouchable as long as he's behind the Hedge and I you know if you brought him out from underneath that hedge or remove the Hedge you know what he'd be vulnerable now we know that job was not because he had uh he was a prophet he was a man of God and so forth but let me tell you what what it was like behind the Hedge now this is just one instance here this is verse one was a man of O whose name was job and he was perfect and upright and one that feared God and shoot evil now you have to the the Hebrew word here is he's aik meaning he was a righteous man for his day Noah was a Tek it's I I'm not a Hebrew person but he was a the Bible says that Noah was was a faithful man in his day so you might look at Noah's like and think wow you know he wasn't very righteous compared to us but in his day God considered him a righteous and perfect man and his sons went this is amazing his sons went and feasted in their houses everyone in his day and they s and called for their three sisters to eat with and drink with them and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about and job sent and sacrificed them job sent and Sanctified them sorry big difference and Rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be and my sons have sinned and curs God in their hearts now I asked myself the question why is job offering sacrifices and they haven't sinned they may have but he's offering sacrifices anyway why is he doing this why in the world is job going through this process and if you go back and follow brother brandom statements the burnt offering is the only protection they had from the wrath of God because the blood offering was was what uh stopped the Judgment in the Garden of Eden and all the other places that he had knew in the Old Testament so why is he offering sacrifices and they may not have sinned at all what's the point well I had looked a long time and I was studying the I I look in the Hebrew language very carefully and what I found was that job was afraid of a spirit of entitlement now here's where your kids are old enough need to follow me he was afraid his kids would be influenced by a spirit of entitlement we're job's sons and you know what we've been to all the camps we know all the great ministers we've been around a long time and after all my father is a prophet and if you let that Spirit go long enough you'll eventually feel pretty comfortable with venture in outside the Hedge cuz you know what I'm job's son and I we can take a little liberty here we can do a little of this and a little of that because job's my dad and if we get in trouble job will bring us back that's a dangerous place for kids who are raised in the message to get to you can feel like my dad's the pastor or my dad uh you know he's a deacon in the church and you start to feel like well we've been in the message a lot of years I've been to all the camps and so you can easily in this age get a spirit of entitlement that feels like well God owes me that's a dangerous place to be no matter who your father is or who your mother is you need to stay behind the Hedge because God puts the Hedge there for your protection and when you get an attit that I don't need to be behind this Edge I got it you know what I'm job's son it's all right dangerous place to be and that's why job offered sacrifices all the time as he was afraid if that Spirit got a hold of them they'd be exposed to the wrath of God so I'm going to offer an offering to be over them in case they get that attitude and brother ramam said that was a real father you cannot replace prayer praying for your children continually CU you know what you may be the only thing that's standing between them and the wrath of God to come and as long as they have that measure of protection God has a channel to meet with them and deal with their heart remember now you're not the Savior but you're creating an atmosphere and a channel through which God can deal with them does that make sense all right let me let me go fast here and let me skip you can have all of this it's all here we need to think about as parents I'll leave the the PowerPoint with you they've got it done the men in the sound booth down here have it what we need to ask questions especially today what do we allow our kids to participate in you know friends what kind of friends do they have what kind of dress what kind of travel and so forth and relationships do do we allow them to have do we allow sleepovers do we allow uh you know uh them to have their their own access to the internet you know or whatever and I put this graph on the right hand side because now nearly half uh of teens say they use the internet almost constantly so you look at the difference between 2014 when Al Gore invented the internet in 2022 uh it's doubled so these are kids that are getting all of their information from the internet they're getting all of their feedback they're getting all of their data from the internet and they're looking at that and the amount of friends they have the likes that they have all of that it's it's exponential here in terms of how kids are getting their feedback in other words who's where is the absolute today and that's a really good question you can tell these are not message kids but you can tell this is pure research and you can tell that kids are not getting their information from their parents they're not getting it from school or whatever they're not getting it from any Sanctified Source they're getting it online they're getting it from their peers and I learned a long time ago Proverbs 13:20 he that walketh with the wise shall be but a companion of fools shall be destroyed and if you want to you want to find destruction pretty quick you hang around with fools who are the fools in your life the people your age they they're foolish because they think they know everything right what teenager doesn't think they know everything but if you want to be wise you hang around with wise people wise people are older people who've been around been there done that got scars to prove it probably got some advice to give you am I okay all right what should we allow our kids then to participate and how do we establish boundaries when it comes to all of these areas here okay so now here's where here the problem is is this this is what I wanted to get to the four four issues of corrective discipline now I can't I can't do it all here but uh let's can we take a little run at it that' be all right or I could say just give me five more minutes and you know that that's not true I love this statement I use this statement everywhere now brother bam says we got to think about our young people he says we got children so we got to think of others as coming on behind us that's that intergenerational responsibility thing right we got to think of those things coming on behind us these young people and so forth and a place for our children our daughters we don't want them out in the world and things like that we want them girls raised like their mothers and the pastor is going to make arrangements for that does that what it says and the holy spirit's going to make arrangements for that that's not what it says it says we going to make arrangements to that we're going to make our home a place where we can where kids can come home and bring their friends we're going to make uh you know uh Fellowship in the church Friday nights have young people I don't know what you do but you know we're we're we're going to have a place the pastor's house or whatever else or brother Mark's house or uh sorry he's shaking his head no make sure you tell him no we we have as as a as an assembly you don't need to have a quota you don't need to have 75 people or 100 people or 500 people but we as an assembly we're going to we're going to say hey we're going to provide some activities for kids maybe an outing on Saturday maybe a hockey game maybe or something else you know we're going to we're going to spend some time together so they can Bond they can create friendships and they can enjoy one another's company because you know what we'd rather have a mixing with Believers than we're going to stay inside the heads rather than outside the heads right remember people outside the heads have tattoos right don't forget that and if there's a tomorrow we don't know we don't know that there's if there's no tomorrow we haven't done anything but at been at the Master's at our posted Duty that is your duty take it from me you don't have your kids long you're gone right all of a sudden they're gone look at these people over here floundering and wandering around with nothing to do now because their children are all gone I I I love that because brother Braham is making sure we understand he's not giving this responsibility to anybody else that's us now ideally number one spiritual discipline is about the heart and ideally the best way for your children to be disciplined is to hear it in church or read their Bible and God Quicken it to say I got it I got it I need to have an experience with God what's your name right there yeah what John come on up John appreciate John I need a helper John John is my son and I come on up here now you're not going to get sit down like your ugly brother John good to have you buddy now John is Young and he's uh growing up and he's at how old are you uh 10 10 whoa he's he's at a point in life where he's starting to ask questions about things right God God might be dealing with him and he's thinking you know brother so and so got baptized last week and I just I'm just feeling like that might be might be time for me you know in other words he's he's thinking about it through the week and thinking about it you know and I don't know he's just hadn't told anybody but just you know thinking about it because up to now everything he believes is what his parents basically told him what they brought him to church and had him here that's what he that's what he believes but there's a difference in that in having his own experience with God and sometimes when kids had their own experience with God it could seem like they're rebelling because he's not doing things now because Dad said so or mom said so he's doing things because God's dealing with him and if you're not a wise parent you can interpret that wrongly as Rebellion because you know what up to now up to now he's got his father's mantle he's got his father's Faith he grew up with that where'd you get this jacket somebody gave it to you hey when kids are brought up that's where they get their Fai somebody gave it to him right somebody taught him somebody said believe this read this memorize this go to church and hear that right it's not coming from within it's coming from without right and so he he's in church he's got his father's faith and and that's what he's wearing but he comes to a place in life where he figures out that's my father's faith it ain't mine I need to have my own that's right so you know what he does he takes that off take it off there and all of a sudden hey hey hey what what are you leaving the church or something are you go ahead and take it off you know what he's doing he's doing the right thing he's taking off someone else's Faith so he can put on his own and that's what he needs to do this is mine and I need to put this on this is mine now you're old enough to have your own and he needs to have his own faith a wise father guides him through the fitting and putting on the putting on the faith something that he understands he believes and you know what he's going to be way more more comfortable with his faith on than my faith on when he reaches this age of accountability when he reaches this age here and if I jump on him because he's taken my faith off I'm going to provoke him to wrath and that's what I don't want to do because you want to have your own experience with God and he might step out and say you know I just got a I just I I he's he's a newborn he doesn't know anything he doesn't he kind of doesn't know how to act on his own because he's new at all of this but you know he he knows I mean it's it's the Holy Spirit actually dealing with him and he's he's he's actually doing the right thing looks awkward sounds awkward and he might flounder quite a bit in that season but you know what he's doing the right thing you weren't so surefooted when you came into the faith either and knew everything right you were kind of floundering around and thinking oh this is God and it wasn't and this is the devil and it wasn't he just needs to have his own experience with God but but with we got to be careful we don't interpret that as Rebellion now there are kids who Rebel right there are kids who Rebel and you know they they they want they want to get away and all the rest of it you know and they're they're not uh uh respectful of the the message and so forth you know and hey again that's where prayer comes in because when you recognize your kids are going through that you need to be really putting a hedge of prayer around this guy that he'll make the right decisions right time that that the devil doesn't reach in in that that time and plant things in there hey buddy right and you people in the church grandparents I'm giving you something to do grandparents here see this happening and they you know what they they should be joining in prayer over this guy too because one of the best things grandparents can do is come alongside parents that are trying to raise their children in the admonition of the Lord and pray for him too I tell my grandkids all the time I say hey you got a question you got a problem you come to me I'm not going to tell you anything different than your folks tell you but you you always have somebody to come to you always do that okay bud back to your seat thanks John so this is this ideally this is where we want to have it happen inside here in the heart and we want to have it to come from rather than have given him instruction all of his life we want to have it coming from the outside in all right so you remember Daniel Daniel goes off from Jerusalem to Babylon remember that he's only 13 or 14 or 15 years old he's hardly shaving and he's taken off into Babylon as one of the favored few and he's picked by the king and he's in there and so forth and then all of a sudden he figures out wow I can't eat this food it's offered to Idols so he says to the keeper you keep the food I'm not going to go and have that dinner you bring me vegetables and I'll have that and uh give me 10 days and watch how it turn out where did he get that from how did Daniel know that at 10 12 13 he was probably 13 or 14 or 15 by the chronology if you work out the chronology that's about how old he was just a young guy but he's got enough knowledge and enough conviction in his own heart that he's doing the right thing because I know I know that's wrong and I'm just going to trust God wow great for a young guy you know what brother brandham said brother brandham said that Daniel could do that because he communed with Jehovah before he left Jerusalem that's what he say Daniel had a relationship with God before he left Jerusalem cuz now he's in Babylon and there's no churches there's no Rabbi there's no parents there's no uh Scrolls there's no nothing now he's got to have it on the inside or he's going to be pulled aside with the calans but he communed with Jehovah and we want John down there to commune with Jehovah as a as a parent you should be praying that your child goes through that that transformation that that that process that stepping stone across the bridge from where it's just me telling him you want him to have his own experience and his own meeting with God so he can stand on his own two feet and recognize when he's out there without mom and dad and he's out there without the pastor and he's out there without a message book in his hand and he's out there among amongst of uh amongst a bunch of heathens out there and they all want to put a tattoo on he can say nope my body's a temple of the Holy Ghost whoa amen we don't want him to say well brother brandom said I couldn't the Bible says I couldn't my pastor says I couldn't we want him to say no I know my body is a temple of the Holy Ghost are you getting my point so the spiritual dis discipline we want to have that and allow God deal with him and brother brandom says uh the church he said all they all let down the bars and they all sing when they let down the bars and compromise with iny let down the bars and the Sheep got out how did the goats get in he says he let down the bars where does that start that does not start with children that starts with parents children don't decide in a household to let down the bars if they do I need to have a parents conference here it's the parents who are letting down the standards because there's been a mass transfer of authority in our culture whether you realize it or not a mass transfer of authority from parents to children and children are calling the shots children don't want to be told children want to run the show they want to do what feels good and they want to do what everybody else is doing and the parents crazy as it is the parents have given authority to Children they've given their Authority and their position to Children it should not be among us you let down the standards of Christianity and the devil might have went out of fashion as and got on of business and so forth now I I'm sorry I'm just I'm just going to have to go quickly here he that speth the rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes the rod and of reproof they give correction they give wisdom but a Child Left to himself bringeth his mother to shame you can't disregard the scripture and have a come out right I said you can't disregard the Bible and have a come out right you can't ignore the principles of scripture and have a come out right look around at your Society we were at the hotel uh staying and and we we came on uh Friday and when we got there it was like whoa whoa there were people dressed up in the most perverted and crazy demonic looking costumes and so forth and I thought they were all hanging around outside the door and I go inside the door and there's more of them inside the door and I'm looking around I asked the lady at the desk I said what is this she said it's a comic book convention uh you know the what do you call it the graphic novels and whatever they are and uh so the kids who are there they're all kids they're all young teenagers and stuff they're all dressing like these characters in these books and they're they're all mingling around and I thought in the words of brother Mark whoa and I thought but for the grace of God you know I mean where is this thing like what's next what's it going to be like in 5 years in this world it's nuts and and and this is exactly what Solomon is trying to tell us a long time ago you leave children to themselves and this is where it goes it it doesn't work it doesn't come out right you you can take a look at all of these things here now all right the second issue is verbal verbal discipline it's the actual work of getting the heart and the soul and the mind working in the same direction Brethren Romans 1212 Brethren I beseech you by the mercies of God that you be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good acceptable and perfect will of God conforming means that whatever it is like in the world you're going to be like that and transforming comes from within and that's the big difference and brother brandom is you know I mean he this is a key scripture for brother Brandon he preaches major uh sermons on this issue here but to me in in terms of verbal discipline we're we're going to try to encourage our kids to resist wrong ideas and resist wrong people uh because of what they're doing not because everybody's evil and we're going to discipline ourselves to stay uh with the word and just trust the Holy Spirit Will um tap us and let me if nobody's ever told you this before you should be thankful you have a conscience because a conscience is God's Little tool to make you think about what you're doing and whether I should make the next step and and Paul says I keep under my body bringing in the subjection I'm sorry I'm having to run it through it here but the discipline of the will uh should be consequence oriented so if you do this this is going to happen like Samson you don't give away your secret of your hair he he maintained his strength he maintained his testimony the converse is also true you give away the secret you're going to lose your strength and God is Not mocked what you you're going to reap what you sow so we're we're looking at channeling and and focusing on Behavior here now brother bam said now you notice people they'll say well I accepted the Lord and you take the word for it I can't judge God does but in 10 years they haven't progressed a bit and staying in the same old place every day your heart hunger is moving on there's something growing inside of you and I will tell you this I I'll just say this from a message perspective that we we you know as nice a church as you have nice Minister as you have and all the good things that you have here I I would encourage you never get settled down to the place where we got it we're we're good there should be in every heart a longing in our heart and you know the ministry uh without even attempting to do this stirs up something inside of a Believer like we stir up within ourselves and you realize a there's got to be more I want more I don't want to no matter how good it is here I don't want to stay here I want to I want to go to where I belong I want to go to where God's calling me and that's a deep calling to deep that's a theophany here don't don't neglect that voice that voice is pulling you into another dimension and you got to allow that to happen that's what God wants to do not to be settled down here and to become uh you know mundane and in a in a rut here let me tell you a rut is only a a a coffin with the ends kicked out you don't want to stay here you want to keep moving on and keep moving on and that's what he's saying here that that when you hear people say well we don't want to we don't want to witness to anybody we don't want to you know have uh any um uh you know we just we we're we're content where we are I'm not content where we are I'll tell you what the more I see the less content I am about this world the more I look at my body aging I I'm less content with it if a birth is born a child grows it lives well the Christ in your heart ought to be growing day getting bigger more powerful understanding things better forgiving walking as God would till Christ be formed in you the hope of glory and the last I you just listen these are sermons in themselves I'm sorry sister Brenda I'm sorry uh if maybe I'll come back if the weather is good the physical discipline is if number three is working on the will number four is for the won and you spareth a rod and you hate your son but he that loveth him chasen him be times in our house coffee house my house not my house there were three ways kids got a spanking you know there's three kinds of people in the world people who can count and the people who can't there there was a way to get a spanking in our house number one if you told a lie because the Bible directly says you should put away lying so if they told a lie there there was a spanking consequence for that number two if he destroyed property so if I took my brother's toys and beat him up or hit him and and destroyed him left him out on purpose and they rusted or whatever else you destroyed property Psalms 1 1915 that's an infraction with malice of forethought there's going to be a consequence for that I will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways and that's what David had to learn he had to learn respect for God's ways somebody else's ways and then thirdly disrespect when there was blatant disrespect and disrespect can be interpreted like this I need you to go clean up your rooms now because we're going to have company and roll the eyes rolling of the eyes is disrespect and and you know what the word whatever is disrespect because sometimes your parents can tell you uh you shouldn't do that you shouldn't do that to your brother's things you shouldn't stomp on his toys like that whatever that's disrespect or if your parents tell you something or your pastor tells you something you shouldn't be sitting there in your heart going whatever heard that before remember your heart speaks louder than your words and you're going to get in trouble in our house you got in trouble for those three things those are the three things that that were made very clear to our boys and and they were going to get in trouble with that brother B says mother daughter that's not mother yet hey I just a couple more minutes really if your child was out there in the street and them Renegades were running through the street half drunk and the kid is going to get killed you'd say well darling just go ahead and sit on the street I want you to feel good about yourself I want you to have a good self uh identity and feel confident and positive about yourself brother Bram said you wouldn't love the baby if you acted like that real love would get out there and put it on such discipline spank it till it did stay out on the street all right so let's say you got a one-year-old or a two-year-old because two-year-olds are terrible and you got to plant you got to is this being recorded two-year-olds are lovely we love two-year-olds so let's say you have a plant and you have it real nicely done brother Mark did it for you and you got it hang in a prominent place in your house and that 2-year-old comes over and you know gets up here and he's starting to pick the leaves off that what I would do is grab that two-year-old before they get to the plant hold them on by the foot and say no before they get there no you know what they're going to do and they're going to whine and cry and sit down and whine and cry it's going to sound terrible and you're going to go right back at it and they go back again and do it and you grab them by the foot and hold them restrain them no tell them no tell them no several times and they're going to whine and cry and resist and scratch and bite and kick and everything else and they're going to go back at it again you grab them by the foot and hold on to him they probably do that all day probably do that for a week until they cross the line and they come to a point where they're going going for the plant and they're looking at you and you say no and they'll stop before they reach out for it and they'll stop because you know what you do you're trying to do you're trying to make them understand that no means something they got to know that no means something and they'll eventually come to the place where they know that if they reach out for that and they grab a hold of that there's going to be a consequence for that so they'll they'll come to it and they'll look around and see what you're going to do before that and then you're then you're helping them to understand what no means oh come on now think about this you don't need to be violent you don't need to be rough or you nothing like that but you remember when brother brandham was invited to go with the Pentecostal people remember that and his mother-in-law said no not taking my daughter among that he had to learn what it meant when God said no you don't listen to her you listen to me and God wants you to understand as Believers the meaning of no there's boundaries there's limits and you want to teach your children that know means something and you know what you got to do you got to put yourself into that and you got to work at that because it doesn't happen once when you do it once you probably got to do a thousand times and even if they're spoiled brats you probably got to do a little bit more but they got to understand what no means because when you give into them all the time and they have their own way they come to the place where they're they're not even hearing you when you say no until they start to vocalize it and say no back to you brother bam said you don't love your baby unless you're out there making sure this does not happen now I wish I had more time more examples here but that that's that's what he's trying to tell us here well you say I'll mingle around a bit God give you a real oldfashioned spanking for that and I'll tell you if we had more of that in the natural today we'd have better children you will have better children because you leave them alone let them have their own way and when they learn to squall and control you through squalling and control you through crying and control you through going to the other parent and getting their opinion and playing one off the other somebody the old people are not in their head not because they're asleep and those children try to control you by tantrums and everything else you're not giving them Liberty by letting them have a tantrum they need to know what no means and if you don't teach them anything else you teach them that in other words they they learn to have boundaries here so he says God wants his household straightened out and he gives you a little whipping so you may get straightened out makes you love him more it makes you love him more let me tell you when the Holy Spirit corrects me I don't hate him at the end of it I love him more I'm thankful Lord thank you for showing me that thank you for helping me to understand that that principle and Lord I I I don't want to live that way I don't want to I don't I don't want to make that mistake again and and that's that's exactly what the holy spirit is trying to teach you and he is has a way of doing that doesn't have to be violent or anything else doesn't have to be vicious or mean or anything else like that sorry I'd like you to I'm going to end with this sometimes God has unusual ways of doing things he has unusual ways of getting our attention maybe you've never heard this story once upon a time there's a family of wward church members who had once been active and lost all interest in church and had fallen away and they were the father and three sons Jim John and Sam and the elders had talked to them about their lost condition preacher visited many Brethren talked to him about their lost condition tried to get him to come back to church but to all this didn't seem to do the least bit of good one day when all the boys were out in the field the pastor a large rattlesnake bit John and he became ill the doctor was called and after an examination he pronounced John to be in very critical condition doctor said about all we can do now is pray the father said call the preacher tell him of John's condition and he asked the preacher to pray for John's recovery and this was his prayer oh wise and righteous father we thank you for the thou and thy wisdom sent this rattlesnake to bite John in order to bring him to his senses he has not been inside the church for all these years and it's doubtful he has in that time felt the need for prayer and now we trust that this will prove a valuable lesson to him and it will lead to genuine repentance and now father wilt thou send another snake to bite Sam and another one to bite Jim and another big one to bite the old man we've been doing everything we know for years to restore them but to no avail it seems therefore that our combined efforts could not do what this snake has done we thus conclude that the only thing left that this family will do this family any good as rattlesnakes so Lord send us bigger and better rattlesnakes in Jesus name we pray don't underestimate sorry sister Betty she's laughing uncontrollably back there don't underestimate God's ability to to come out of left field and do something you're not expecting to get your attention whether you're young or old and it often happens when you get in a rut you don't you know you don't see a need to change you don't see a need to correct things and all of a sudden whoa there's a catastrophe there and all you're you're doing everything you can now that's biblical in order to make it work sorry let me you you can have all of this it's all here let me I'm just getting to a quote brother Braham said well you say I know men and women musicians if you'll come cuz that's the breaks if you'll come I know men and women that didn't didn't teach their children and wasn't Christians and here's what brother Braham said the very thing of not leading your kids to Christ was the wrongest thing they could ever do the very thing of not leading their kids to Christ was the wrongest thing that they could ever do besides the other not to lead them to Christ you can't have a correct Union he's talking about a marriage Union without Christ and the fellowship broken the most important thing you can do is lead your kids to Christ now remember now you're not a savior but your job is to create an atmosphere into which the Holy Spirit can visit whenever he wants and and the important thing is for you to prepare your children and let them know it's not because you're in this church you're born again it's not because you're uh part of the choir that you're you're born again that's like saying that if I swim in the ocean uh then I'm a whale no no if you're in a church it doesn't mean you're a born- again believer you have a meeting with God you have a born- again experience that means that you're a Believer so I will tell you that one of the most powerful things you can do and the most profitable things you can do is to lead your children to Christ and and maintain that atmosphere that the holy spirit's always welcome that's a job in our world today that's a job I pray that God will will help you to do that I I pray that without being legalistic without being dogmatic about it and without taking the attitude what we let the kids do whatever they want they're little they don't feel good right all the rest of but to have that balance that allows you to be able to keep things in the home in a way that the holy spirit is pleased with it pleased with what you're doing not perfect none of us are perfect there's no perfect homes there's no perfect parents no perfect kids ask the kids but we're going to do all we can by the grace of God we're going to do all we can with the help of the Lord to keep that atmosphere right let's stand to our feet and let's stop there that' be the most important thing you can play let's pray Heavenly Father we are so thankful Lord for this opportunity that we have Lord to be able to assemble in your house Lord and I apologize for keeping the people so long I just pray that you would maybe something might be deposited in their hearts like a good seed that will grow into a great Tree in in their lives Lord something that will become fruitful and help them Lord in their Endeavors this is not an easy age to raise children it's not an easy age to have Christian families but Lord you would never have left us here unless it is possible somehow so Lord I pray that you would help us to use wisdom and use all the resources that are available to us the Bible and the message and all the great teachings that we have Lord may we apply them not just come to church and listen to them but may we apply them in our lives time for us to take this message home and apply it from the front door all the way to the back and Lord I I pray that you'd forgive us Lord for mistakes we've made in parenting all of us have Lord and things maybe if we could only if we only could get them back if only Lord we could have another chance but time has passed by and time is not always kind to us so Lord we're just asking and praying that you would have your way in our hearts and our lives Lord bless these families bless the young people that are here Lord and may they learn deep in their hearts that God is Not mocked he's not a respector of persons but we should always maintain a respect for the things of God have your way Lord we PR pray bless brother John sister Blanca and the family Lord and all those who labor with them here that this may become truly a lighthouse a place of safety Lord where people can run to and be saved may your anointing rest rest upon this place in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen what are you [Music] playing come on brother [Music] Bob cover me [Music] John God bless you my brother [Music] over me be because Thou [Music] Art my nearest [Applause] kman cover me Cover Me cover me amen did you enjoy that this evening amen it's good to have rubber meets the road preaching amen you know I'm my nature is I like a challenge uh you know brother Joe works with me at the gym and you know I think it's a coffee corlette thing that they're always testing and pushing each other and you know I've but the Joe has realized that he's weaker than I am and so he comes to me for guidance and strength and encouragement and these things and I found the greatest way to motivate him is tell him I don't think you can do it he likes to challenge a different way he likes to prove me wrong and he does on a regular basis but you know I love it when somebody gives you a challenge and they say here's how you can do it not just because it's one thing to to look at it and and they say well you need to get better because I I heard a lot of things I need to do better amen as he said we're always growing we're always increasing in the things of God but he didn't just tell us to go do it he showed us how to do it showed us what it looks like not just by words but by examples and even his own life and as we've seen it in our mothers and fathers that did it but I loved how he started and said my ceiling should be my children's platform where I finish ought to be their kicking off point because they ought to be learning from our mistakes and our experiences you know I was talking with some senior ministers a number of years ago when they said this they said the young PR preachers they said they're light years ahead of where we were when we were young preachers you know why because the older preachers have been teaching the younger preachers so that the younger preachers start where the old preachers are letting go and it's just a continuation of the work then rather than a a step back and then they've got to come up to that and I feel that's that was such a good word of instruction is that our children don't have to start at the level we did they can start at the level where we where we let them go amen that's the way it really ought to be and but it struck me me as he was talking that there's one thing that makes this work and that's a real relationship with Jesus Christ as parents that's the only way this is going to work hypocrisy won't work a religious spirit won't work it takes a a a mother and a father that have a testimony daily of the the realities of God in their life of healing of provision of guidance of Direction and all these different things that we we go through that that we can say God hears God's listening God cares and we can we can share a testimony with our kids Jensen came up to me before the service uh before the the the preaching started and he said Dad the the rash under my arms is already gone amen that's what we're looking for that when we pray God answers because he's God of he's a god of his word amen not not not a god of what I say but he's a god of what his word says and that's what we're pointing to that's the absolute you know what I liked how he said discipleship is the only response that we ought to have as parents is to teach our children the right thing to do by the word of God not because we feel or not because we're angry or not because we're proud these different things but because the word of God is our light and it's our Direction amen it just struck me how we need that simple humble Victorious Christian walk daily that that's the need for us as parents as as members of a family as a church body is that when we're all Walking In Christ by the word amen we can see some tremendous things that happen in our midst that poor forun it was so good he says we've got to make arrangements to raise our kids properly we can't put it on the pastor thank you for that brother Barry can't put it on the rest of the people as parents we've got to we've got to make arrangements for for taking care of our kids time and their energy and their interests and these things because if we don't Supply it the world will absolutely Supply it free of charge no strings attached amen and then are we building Hedges to protect or lowering the ours to allow things in that was a big challenge that was a big challenge cuz so often what we want to do is get closer to our kids so we allow things when we ought to get closer to them because they learn that we love them and we do what's best for them no matter what amen and every family is Sovereign God deals with us as
