further the word let's be in prayer yes for one another amen that God will Minister according to the need oh well brother I feel all right this you all you pray for your brother pray for your sister because they ever need amen and brother it again is according to our faith Believers again what he asked Martin Mary is asking us believe us now this amen because they came to that hour for what in that at the grave of Lazarus and brother now we've come to that hour amen at the end of all things believe us thou the resurrection believe is thou the Rapture praise the Lord because brother the word of the hour the message of the hour was to bring that to our attention and give us the faith that we need for the resurrection to give us the faith that we need for the Rapture Amen brother again we're not back as as we would say in previous ages where they got the faith for justification sanctification oh yeah I'm the ventures of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit amen because whether we're coming to the end of all these things now look up praise the Lord you've been Justified you've been Sanctified you have access to the gifts of the Spirit and you know any of the Holy Ghost now what do we do now Lord look up amen amen because everything that God that we needed God provided we needed justification we needed sanctification by faith amen certainly certainly brother we would have it as long as we're in the flesh when it comes to the something that's literally just not exactly what God wants that's right you're not satisfied with the flesh no no that's why you give us the holy ghost in the heart amen but forward to bring us to a change of our bodies into glorified bodies by the grace of almighty God Amen how many are truly looking for a glorified body how many are Julia look at him believing for the resurrection and the Rapture Amen brother they're all looking forward to this looking forward to that no problem but now we've come to the end of it all where God has revealed his word God has revealed justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit now what's left is the resurrection amen now the question is believe us thou this because when it comes to the to the life of Lazarus brother oh yeah marry your mother they they oh yeah it was their brother your sibling and so on oh now now he was right there in the grave and Jesus said oh mother he's not dead no no you don't live with them believe in the nation will never die yeah amen and according to well never died Jesus if you tell me Elijah was not dead no he wasn't dead amen and Jesus we're going to prove it amen amen he's a Lazarus oh that lashes heard him and if you heard him he wasn't dead amen hallelujah praise the Lord and he said he shall never die and he wasn't dead and when Jesus spoke he drives us heard it and came forward amen he woke him up Amen brother I pray Grace God I sure trust and believe what there by you the Holy Ghost he's woke us up and that's what that's why we're here in this church that's why we're here under this word that's why we're under this message amen because God woke us up amen the devil is going to put us to sleep oh yeah in what God did no no oh no it's what God's doing it keeps Us Alive amen because why we move on we move on we move on Amen until we move up by the grace of God Amen that's why the scripture said we just when they see this and you know this look up that's right amen because the name of your Redemption the Redemption we've been redeemed yeah but we physically transversely but now we're looking for this Redemption physically that's right oh brother if we ever need anything now it's the Redemption of this whole body Amen to get out of time and into eternity amen amen they get into a glorified body amen oh I won't be I want you I oh we'll all be like I'll be like these teenagers here amen exactly oh oh yeah oh yes Sister Mary you want to have no gray hair amen amen and our brothers here they won't be bald won't be getting ball no no not by any means oh brother just say I pray God we believe it amen well yes not let's not believe what what when it comes to what we're experiencing here physically over getting older and our hair is getting gray and yours getting white and well some of us are losing it no no for the brother as the father of God said you never lost none of us you tell me where it was before I got it that's right and he said that's where it is now he's waiting for me amen because they were thinking you know oh brother Brown you're getting bald he said no she said I haven't lost none of it he said where it was before I got it he said it's waiting for me amen praise the Lord hallelujah it's encouraging those some of you Brothers Here encouraging me because it's Getting Thinner and thinner and thinner amen that's all right we're getting greater and greater and greater Spirit spiritually Amen brother that body is just right there and again let me remind you again and again and again and the prophet is not 12 feet from you at any given time you're see off anybody it's right there amen until one day brother we're going to step from this one into that one oh I tell you I trust by Grace we're going to step into a glorified body and brother if not you're going to just step into that one until and Uber's left is going to take this whole fleshly body and bury it yeah but you're not there no more no it's gone thank God thank God halleluia for the promise thank God for the encouragement amen thank God for the revelation of the Resurrection for he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die amen amen so the grace of God where that we are not dead now we're not we won't be dead then amen oh what brothers are and so is that sister so notice he's not they're there waiting for us remember the prophet of God when he went into that vision of beyond the curtain of time and it won't he was walking down somewhere and here came this this sister or brother whatever it was and he said ma it looks like so-and-so but they're gone no they stay from that Dimension to this one to see the prophet amen amen and to greet the prophet amen and he said oh he said no she they told the prophet they said we're there waiting for you amen amen and the saints that are gone on are waiting for us amen praise the Lord hallelujah so I pray the grace of God brother that the wedding we're me waiting for you Amen to prove that we are the seed of God that we are the sons and daughters of God Amen God help us to believe in a world that's dying in a world that's experiencing death I pray Grace look up amen but it wasn't when Jesus went in his life and in his ministry he came to that place amen what did his face he just faced death amen they were going to crucify him they were going to kill him they were going to do this they're going to do that amen oh he said oh he said either live with them believeth in me shall never die amen he's going to lay down his life and pick it up amen amen amen thank God he did yes amen and that's why after 2 000 years we're gathered here believing amen amen as saints of God have gathered all down Through the Ages good evening in the resurrection that even in the raptured mother I pray Grace we're we're believing in the present State revelation of it amen amen now there will be a resurrection there is a resurrection amen because the ministry that God sent in these last days proved to us the resurrection amen the prophet of God has highlighted it and say listen this is the resurrection is it the Rapture surely you believe in the resurrection that you believe in the Rapture considering he said what God has done and concerning what God's doing amen amen in the ministry of a prophet yes because the dead was raised that's right amen amen oh my brother sister God help us to believe look up mother's not looking down to the word looking down to the message no let's look up expect uh expect any moment now the change [Music] the grace of God be with us Amen to truly sincerely and honestly believe in the resurrection amen Jesus was challenged challenging their faith two thousand years ago and he's challenging our faith today he was challenging the Jews now he's challenging the Gentiles Believers thou this in the all my brother sister oh we believe this Doctrine we believe that Doctrine that's good praise the Lord move on amen but concerning the resurrection do you believe that because during the Rapture do you believe that oh well yes yes we believe the the doctrine no we're looking for the reality Amen to too many now it's just a Doctrine oh I believe in the doctrine of the Resurrection I believe in the doctrine of the Rapture no we want the reality of it that's right amen we're gonna we're experiencing the re the resurrection amen that's why we're here because we got the resurrection in US amen if you didn't brother you'd be out there in a dead Church but you're here to hear the word The Living Word oh praise the Lord amen you're not feeding your dead Doctrine you're feeding on the Living Word of God amen and it is giving us a living faith praise the Lord to know that God not God was God will be God is Amen brother all these things was all these things will be and I'll tell you the religious World okay it's all past it's all future watch prison amen what is in the present oh we believe God did this and he's going to do this well what's he doing yeah yeah amen because if he's going to do that he's going to be doing this here now praise the Lord let go and let God have his way amen Amen brother let go of your thoughts and believe his thoughts amen let go of your ideas and let's believe God's ideas which is his word amen amen brother again the proud of God challenges us with this message right here in 1963. I think it was yes and he said is your why cry speak amen speak the word amen God was challenging Moses why are you crying to me for this do this do this do that Moses speak the word amen because he gave it to Moses now is any brother when it comes to the resurrection Rapture he's given it to you and me in this hour so the message of the arch or the messenger of the hour he's given us the revelation of the Rapture of the Resurrection amen for the faith to believe amen speak the word yes sir yes sir why cry for the resurrection why are you crying for the Rapture speak the word amen amen the resurrection is in you amen and the Rapture is in you amen amen by the grace of God by the word of God Amen all praise the Lord Brother considering all that God has done and all that God is revealed in this hour what's it doing to you I trust us not just bringing you to church oh we believe this Doctrine we believe that Doctrine no you come believing for the resurrection you can't believe me with the Rapture because brother in all previous ages when God revealed the word amen Withers Luther of Ashley or the Pentecostals they come believing for greater greater revelation of what God had revealed what justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit Amen to what for oh for God to reveal it God to manifest it more and more and more in their lives amen they knew what God had done they knew what God was doing Amen brother we know what God has done do we know what God's doing amen God help us to believe amen why cry speak the word speak the word amen amen why cry for this for this brother it's here that's right you want it it's here it's revealed speak it amen and believe it and move on Amen for the glory of God amen again in Exodus chapter 13. and verse 17. and it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God let them LED them rather not through the way of the land of the Philistines although that was near for God said lest per Adventure the people repent when they see war and they return to Egypt oh no God LED them in a way that they that they wouldn't cause them to repent for coming out of Egypt and wanting to go back to Egypt oh yeah they got got to that place with Moses will you bring us out here for you should we got this in Egypt that in Egypt we never had this these needs when Moses knew that God was going to provide amen but the children of Israel were doubting let's not doubt for the resurrection let's not doubt for the Rapture please believe for the resurrection believe for the Rapture get out of here amen according to your faith be it unto you amen amen you want to go into Resurrection you want to go to Rapture according to your faith be it unto you amen faith in every hour faith in every age it's faith in this hour amen are you believing for the resurrection are you believing for the Rapture now Amen brother there was the anointing that brought the justification and the anointing was on the people for sanctification the anointing was there for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit now the anointing is there for the resurrection amen and again in verse 18 He said but God led the people about through the way of the Wilderness of the Red Sea and the Church of Israel went up Earnest out of the land of Egypt and Moses took the bones of Joseph with him for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones away ants with you amen he believed in the resurrection amen and they took their Journey from sucketh and encamped in etham in the edge of the Wilderness and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night and that's exactly what God has done for us in these last days amen it is the pillar of fire and it is the cloud amen we are without excuse amen father that we are going to follow the Lord by day and by night and it says that he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of the fire by night from before the people amen you may be seated and go with me to Exodus chapter 14. amen and this was the text that the prophet of God used in the message that he preached in why cry speak amen speak the word amen believing what God has done and to believe what God is doing if you're to believe what God will do you're going to believe what he did and what he's doing amen because what he did is going to lead us to what he's doing and what he's doing is going to take us into what he will do amen one is going to point to the other amen as justification was pointing to sanctification and sanctification was pointing to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit Hallelujah and now the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of Despair is pointing to the resurrection and Rapture amen because Alleluia because all that God has promised in his word he has done amen and brother it has come to this place now where we're looking for the resurrection and the Rapture because we don't find any other scripture where God is going to do this and God is going to do that for his seed amen because he's done it he has Justified us he has Sanctified us and he asked fill this with the Holy Ghost amen and experience the gifts of the Spirit amen so where do we go from here look up that's right amen because the hour of the Redemption and the change of your body is at hand amen and brother if there's anything that God wants to do right now it is to resurrect and to Rapture the Saints it is to resurrect and to Rapture the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ brother how many of us want to go brother I trust that we want to go as much as Jesus wants us wants to receive us amen that we want to go into the resurrection we want to go into the Rapture as much as Jesus wants to raise us up amen as much as Jesus wants to enter into a absolutely Unity with him amen the bride and the bridegroom so believe us now this do you believe that you are the bride do you believe that he's the bridegroom do you believe that the breaker has come down Amen to receive his right Amen brother oh brother sister is not God come down to justify us not just God come down to sanctify us he's done it amen and he's revealed it and it's not just God coming down to oh yeah for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit he has done it amen and he oh brother God entered into a Oneness with his sons and daughters guarding into a Oneness with his bride Hallelujah for a brother that one that says what's required to get us to look up that Oneness is what's required to get us to hunger and thirst to be with Jesus amen that we want to be with Jesus amen why because we're the bride and he's the right room amen so brother believe in that God has down to the ages United and was United and is uniting and finally is United amen amen it is a past tense that's right it's not we're going to be United with him we are united with him if they were in justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother now we're United with him he is amen the word is made flesh in the bright that's right amen the word was made flesh and the bridegroom oh thank God for the Revelation thank God for this understanding it is not just looking back and saying oh yeah in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelled Among Us Amen in Jesus but now Jesus comes to the Holy Ghost and the word is made flesh in the in the bride amen amen praise the name of the Lord Brother they came you're in such a Unity with the word of God that the word was made flesh in Jesus now down through the church ages there's such a Unity with the word of God that the word is made flesh in Mrs Jesus Christ amen praise you oh God thank God for the Revelation thank God for the understanding amen oh Lord thank God for the for the faith that is ordained to give us amen but what what just what they needed in Luther's hour and Wesley's hour will hold down true brother God gave them the word that would give them the faith that they needed amen they all went down they went down they went down believing in the resurrection and believing in the Rapture but then the rise of the generation that's good that's oh and they're not ordained to go down to ordain to go up praise the Lord hallelujah oh brother sister I trust we're not looking for the looking for the cemetery we're not looking for the the funeral homes and all of that oh we got to arrange for this arrange for that let's arrange to go up amen sorry it's like again like there was a bunch of senior citizens that were gathered for Fellowship one time and among them was one of my one of my aunts and and she was a Christian because I remember one time that she she just called me a sign and she said I want you to pray for me and she said you know she said I believe this I believe that and I know you believe it she said so she said I want your lands on me and pray for me amen and she and she was with those senior citizens and she considered the fact she said you know what we are we're just a bunch of money she said for the funeral director laughs she said well when we go she still look forward to that but she said we got we got a promise amen look up amen she said because we're entering the time of our Redemption amen we're going to go get it into a glorified body she believed it amen so we we and brother I trust by the grace of God she believed that God help us to believe it oh my and that was a number of years ago when she's been gone on for a number of years oh yeah so I I thank God for the testimony she had I thank God that she received what what mother Journal would witness oh yeah she she said brother she said I I believe you and I I believe that what you got is the truth she said so she said I want you to pray for me because she's I believe she said when I go down she's like coming back she said in the resurrection amen so brother I pray that what if she believed that brother being a part of a denominational church back then what do we believe Amen brother God required that of her what god require of you and me amen so we're moving on by the grace of God again oh yeah we got the faith they got they had the faith they needed in Wesley's age they had the faith they needed in the Pentecostal age amen but God has given us the faith we need in the bright age amen amen for and unfortunately that not well not unfortunate but God knows that that the bride believes in a bright age yes amen now when I just looking back to the previous ages we're looking forward to what God is doing amen we thank God for what he did and we believe what God did but brother we believe what God is doing amen and brothers not just believing with God oh God God did this through William Branham did that through William Branham amen yeah I know that's I believe brother uh brother John the Muslim touched on her at Wonder Brothers concerning William Branham he's back there that's right go on move on Amen and he wanted you to do that oh yeah she didn't want you to stay back with him he wanted you to move on with the word amen because then any and he spoke of he spoke of the ministry that would follow after him and he said oh he said the the ministry that comes after him and after his ministry he said they're going to take take you take you on to the coming of the Lord amen amen and brother that's what we're doing not not to take us on just to hold God sent a prophet God send a prophet yes he's come and he's gone yes amen but brother I tell you by the grace of God are we into the revelation of the message that God sent by that prophet and brother if we're in the revelation of the message that God sent by that Prophet amen we're moving on to the coming moving on to the resurrection we're moving on to the Rapture amen Brothers not just oh thank you Lord thank you Lord your son of prophet Senator Prophet amen let's get and the Lord said yes but are you in the message he that I sent amen oh yeah I believe it do you guys looking for it manifested in you amen God's looking for the message to have an influence in your life God is looking for the influence of the word amen to want to control your actions and your reactions are you looking up are you still going you know in religion are you still going oh yeah thank you Lord you sent a prophet wonderful Lord well if I send the prophet you believe it you believe the message if you believe the message you're looking up if you believe the message you're looking for the resurrection if you believe the message You're Expecting The Resurrection amen because brother sister when it comes to justification he all got caught up with the message of justification and they preached it and they preached it and preached it amen they were witnessing about the justification sanctification oh yeah and then like I said even John Wesley brother he got to the place where he ministered and ministered five times a day amen oh yes he would go into the might go to the mines there and he would preach to the to the workers that were going into the mines and then he would wait for those others to come out and he would preach to them oh yeah and there's other times that he would go into going to a cemetery and he would stand up on a headstone and preach why because there wasn't enough room in the church so he preached in the cemetery amen you want to play what preach among all the dead no they weren't dead amen not by any means praise the Lord and and brother John Wesley was given the witness of the Resurrection The Witness of the Rapture the written is amen of our Lord Jesus Christ Amen brother we are faith in Jesus what is your faith in jail he saves me oh he does what was he doing well he saved me amen thank God for the brother I tell you when we call God we're getting near to the end of the ages getting near to the End of Time amen God began to reveal to to the to his elect you've been Justified you've been Sanctified and now you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost you have access to the gifts amen now you're going on to Eternity praise the Lord hallelujah you see what God did in the prophets amen all down through four thousand years of History God did this God do that Amen to finally the god Prophet come unto scene amen amen and God has done all of this through the bride of Christ down Through the Ages Amen to finally brother yes the right the Christ bride I should call it come on the scene amen amen the Heavenly bridegroom the Earthly bride amen praise the Lord hallelujah brother they didn't preach this 2000 years they didn't preach this 500 years ago in Luther or Wesley or even the Pentecostals no no he was preaching well what God did go oh yeah we're Justified we're Justified we're Justified we're Sanctified we're Sanctified oh we got the gifts for the spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're going to do this we're going to do that yeah but now we're going to wrap we're going to going to step out of time and then do eternity what are you going to do now you're going to do this we're going to do this we're going to want to manifest the gifts we're going to Manifest this manifest that no now we're going to manifest the resurrection Hallelujah Oh Glory because God is now revealing in you and in me the resurrection and the Rapture oh God is now proving it to the to the church God has now proven it to the brain I am the resurrection I am the Rapture Believers thou this amen ask him Mary and Martha if they believe it back then two thousand years ago now he's asking you and me do you believe the resurrection amen because he was going to lay down his life but he was going to pick it up again amen amen praise the name of the Lord Brother he gave up his life he laid it down for oh yeah he's even when he was on the cross amen he just laid it down he let it go amen but he knew he was going to bring it back up amen amen so brother now brother the faith that Jesus had do you and I have do you have the faith that Jesus had for the resurrection and the Rapture that Jesus was going to oh he was going to be laid down he was going to be crucified but yeah that's all right he said I'm gonna all raise again amen yeah in three days you're gonna change everything amen so brother sister do we believe now the concerning the revelation of Jesus now in the last stage brother is not in Luther's hour Wesley's hour the Pentecostal age even but it was moving to it it was pointing to it because Pentecost there were Pentecostals that they really thought that oh the Pentecostal Revival back in the early 1900s they thought the Pentecostal Revival was going to take them on to the coming of the Lord no because by God would send a message with the revelation of the word the restoration of the word amen God will send the message a messenger rather with a message that would give them rapturing Faith amen amen Resurrection Faith amen amen what God did in Pentecost gave them the faith for the gifts the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen they went forth Amen in the ministry like Jesus went forth amen when Jesus was anointed he went forward with signs and wonders Healing The Sick raising the dead amen and finally he preached the truth amen he preached he got their attention before for the hearing of the word amen but when he gave them the word oh they should who can receive this who can believe this brother they believe the prophet of God when he went forth with signs and wonders oh amen he had the hundreds and the thousands they were following his ministry but then he spoke the word yeah amen because he remember the the three Bulls and the first poll was to get to her two pools were to get their attention but the third pull was to give him the word amen amen amen they wanted more signs and wonders but they didn't want the word yeah amen but he caught the attention of the Bride amen the bride believes the word we're not following the signs and wonders we're following the word amen and by the grace of God that designs and wonders of resurrection and Rapture will follow us amen by the grace of God Amen he went through the prophet of the hour and through the anointing of the messenger of that age and this age amen and he and he did these signs and wonders oh my what and and he got the attention of of Christians around the world as it were but then when he gave them the word they wanted them to come oh let's get get rid of Brandon to come and do this and do this but don't don't get him to preach oh yes that was their attitude after he began to minister the word of God to him Amen brother oh yeah they wanted the faith to believe for this the faith to believe for that and that yeah but God was God Amen God through the messenger of the error was giving us the word to give us the faith for the resurrection the faith for the Rapture amen they thought well as long as we believe this we believe that or we'll be in the resurrection no you've got to follow God's leadership into the resurrection follow God's leadership into the Rapture amen you're not you know oh you're oh well the Revival the Pentecost revolver the gifts of the Spirit and we feel this and we feel that oh that's good wonderful amen but they didn't focus on the resurrection yeah yeah they didn't focus on the rapture amen says and God said the messenger of the hour God said the message of the earth amen amen thank God for what he did but in this last last stage it was to focus our attention on the rapture pose our attention on the resurrection amen now many of us today are looking for the resurrection and the news today are hungry and thirsting for the resurrection amen for the Rapture brother Emily oh my God have mercy on us I mean if it's truly truly truly believe in the resurrection amen is truly believe in the Rapture amen oh brother sister oh my brother when you pass right by a cemetery what what comes to your mind when you drive by a cemetery what comes to your thoughts are we looking for the resurrection oh oh we are we just thinking about the Dead oh they're dead they're dead no they're not they're waiting on us not all of them but some of them are waiting on us are we are we ready for them to come to us because the prophet of God did say the dead in Christ are going to appear to the living Saints and he said we're going to be caught and changed and go into that Dimension with them and he said we're going to have fellowship and he did say this somewhere he said we're going to have Fellowship he said we'd be around I think he said 30 40 days and then he said we're going to look up there's Jesus amen we're in another dimension but there he is right there amen and he's we're going to rise to meet him brother oh my brothers sisters amen let's get let's get more in more and more into the revelation of what God is doing not what he's done what he's doing we know what he did in sending the prophet we know what he did in revealing the word and the mysteries of God and the Seven Seals and so on or we can identify oh yeah the water baptism they got it and the servant seed and all these things well that's good but the devil believes that too yeah but I tell you this what he got God God has revealed has he given you the faith that he's predestinated why did God do all this he did it to get us to look up he did it to get us to come home the resurrection he wants to bring them into manifestation the resurrection and the Rapture and that's why he's done what he's done that's why he's revealed what he's revealed amen brother it's not just to focus our attention on William Branham it's not to focus our attention all on the signs and the Wonders no that's ordain to get us look up for the greatest sign and wonder the resurrection of rapture let's get out of here amen Amen brother oh my brother because even when I was driving the church this morning here and I was thinking oh my Lord I said help us Lord we need your help I should have get out of this old world and you see this you see that Lord I said Lord uh Lord in in the kingdom of God I don't the Lord I understand Lord there's not going to be any of these things I said there's no there's not going to be nothing no no vehicles there won't be no planes you know not by any means we won't need a plane to fly we'll fly amen no problem amen God help us to get more and more into that Faith by the grace of God amen amen just think in a moment you can go from one place to another speak the word yeah sister Sandy won't need a plane if she's going back to Alberta or British coffee not by any means oh yeah brother when we go when we go from time to Eternity speak the word amen going to a glorified body speak the word amen for the resurrection Rapture we're going to get caught up amen oh I pray Grace sir brother sister we're going to walk in the spirit and we're going to live in the spirit and we walk in the spirit living the spirit the spirit in us will be the revelation of the word amen amen amen he's going to keep us mindful of the Resurrection oh is you're going to keep his mind below the rapture we won't we won't be able to forget it no no Morning Noon tonight we sing with Lord we're still looking for the resurrection still waiting for the resurrection Lord because I tell your brother when when God came down and they know you're the Holy Ghost and Luther's hour with the revelation of justification morning noon and night that's all they were thinking about oh yeah brother sister whenever they got together as saints of God oh they were thinking oh you we he's Justified us he's Justified praise the Lord amen amen because why because for years Luther was teaching you had to do this you had to do that he believed this the church believed this that you had to do these things to be justified Amen to finally Luther went into the church and there was a Bible in in the best tribute and and they opened the Bible oh there it is Romans he says you as he justified amen Jesus is our justification amen that's drunk loser oh what a revelation Amen brother that's what started the Lutheran Revival amen it was the revelation of the word and it was amen and when that preacher was preaching that Revelation Amen in a cottage meeting and brother and John Wesley was there amen they were preaching the revelation of justification by faith it struck John Wesley oh praise the Lord we're Sanctified by faith amen oh he raised his hands he was he was standing in the in the back there of the of the of the cottage meeting amen thank you Lord hallelujah I'm Justified amen Jesus has Justified me right because John Wesley thought dude he had to go do this he had to do that he had to do that look forward to justify himself no no you will do it but it'll prove God's justification now what you did is what God has done amen amen it's not what we've done it's what Jesus has done amen concerning even the resurrection concerning the Rapture amen because Jesus was resurrected Jesus was raptured amen amen God help us to believe believe the word of God Amen stay stay with the word amen why cry for this why cry for that speak the word [Music] amen you got this knees you got that Nate speak the word amen amen amen because God is in his word amen say with the word amen and the prophet of God did say he said Lord he said Thy word lays open on the pulpit and realizing that someday it'll be closed for his last time then the word will be flesh amen tiger entered into an absolute complete Oneness with the word amen so that you become the word in flesh Amen brother we are the word in flesh but we're moving on to a greater Perfection amen amen even as Jesus went on to a glorified body amen amen we'll go on to a glorified body amen by the grace of God Amen so he said listen he said then the word will be flesh and then he said we're grateful for this time this morning and open to us by the Holy Spirit he said the contents of this word that we shall read and he said May the Holy Spirit teach us today he said the things that we ought to know and he said and may we then in return listen closely to every word amen it's not just to believe this or God isn't a prophet and and God revealed this Doctrine to that doctrine that Doctrine but what faith is it given you what faith is God working on what faith did he work on in Luther's hour justification he wanted to get the people to believe that they didn't have to do these works and these works and they're Justified no they had to believe in the in the finished works of Calvary that's right amen Jesus Justified him oh brother Hallelujah do you have the faith of justification do you have the faith of sanctification amen do you have the faith of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen oh yeah the public officer they're still there and he said we have access to them you know and every day we need that that anointing there's not a day not an hour there's not a situation or circumstance but we need the anointing amen we need to be able to call on the Lord I mean he would be able to believe the Lord you're with me and you are in me amen that you are in him but he's in you amen Amen brother sister is the proud of God we got to be in him and in Christ in us and Jesus and the prophet of God didn't warn us he said remember he said you can you can have Jesus in your flesh he said 24 hours a day and he said hey go to hell but you've got to have him in your heart in your soul amen so Christ in you you in Christ crazier than you you're in Christ the word amen amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah if I just oh I I feel Grace and I feel this and I feel that no it's the word amen amen yeah if it's Christ is in you then you are in Christ the word amen and you go forth as the word of God Amen by the grace of God so he said listen he said maybe then in return listen closely to every word amen and weigh it deeply and may those who are listening by the way of the tape he said may they listen close and may we be able to catch what the holy spirit is trying to reveal to us amen for we realize if you should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain it's for a purpose that it might work to go to the good to the Lord Amen brother is a reason so as God accomplishing his reason and his purpose in you on a daily basis the life you live is a reflecting God's purpose amen Where's God working on in you brother it's not just not just to make us different from the churches out there or this group or that group no brother is to it's to turn us from time to Eternity what God is doing is to take us out of time and into eternity amen what God is doing is to make us less and less conscious of time and more conscious and convicted of Eternity we're coming home Lord amen look up look up you're going home God help us Brothers not focused on Natural Things oh my Lord my Lord my Lord I trust by the grace of God that our spiritual family is more important than our natural family amen but yet still there's too many so-called Believers are caught up too much with their natural families but not the spiritual God help us amen brother it shows again we're born again if you're not born again you're caught up with the natural if you are born again you're caught up with spiritual God give us the evidence that we're born again that will go forth and live the life that we're born again amen you are going to hunger for what for what God wants to Stronger for thirst for what God wants to thirst for we're going to feed on what God wants us to feed on amen praise the Lord oh yes because I've been challenged down Through the Ages you know and even by certain family members oh you're you're always with them you know and when when he comes oh you'll go right on past the house and you'll go right on down to that house down there and so on a believer's house oh yeah certain family members who come jealous why because they add more attention more of our attention than they did that's the truth and brother sister is still even a lot of Believers that they're caught up with their natural more caught up with the natural family than they are the spiritual God help us amen brother Jesus wasn't caught up with this natural family he was kind of he was caught up with his Spirituals to the extent that he laid his life down for them are you going to lay down your life for your spiritual Sons and Daughters right or your brothers and sisters God help us anybody brother this even and you've got a responsibility you got children to raise them up in the way they should go amen that they're going to see your the the the emphasis you're putting on your spiritual not the natural and yet there's parents that are putting just more and more it's just on this on the natural oh just on the spiritual you know when we go to pray or when we go to go to church no no your your relationship morning noon and night is to be spiritual influenced by the Holy Ghost when you rise in the morning to when you go to bed at night it's all under the anointing of the Holy Ghost you're amen you're going to think spiritual acts spiritual talk spiritual amen by the grace of almighty God amen brother don't be ashamed amen of the Gospel don't be ashamed of your relationship with Jesus amen brother and I know that again that's why a lot of the Believers down Through the Ages I've rejected is because they're putting more and more answers on Believers Believers Believers believers or they treat the natural family pie and I'm sorry the Lord bless you and and you're good to them and so on but your your fellowship you want more and more fellowship with believers for sake not the Assembly of yourselves together and more much more as you see the day approaching amen with with your spiritual Brothers and Sisters in Christ amen and I know Lord and I know that I've had I've had to bear that reproach for many years where people just felt that I was I was more caught up with Believers Believers Believers wherever there's Believers that's where we met that's where we went yeah because the natural family felt oh well I thank God for the respect my natural family gave for me even though I put more and more answers on on my brothers and sisters in the word in the message oh yeah thank God that's what God requires not only that now God requires it but if you've got the Holy Ghost that's what you'll do and you've got the Holy Ghost In Your Heart oh yeah that's the life you'll live you're not living for your natural family you're living for your spiritual it's not your natural mom and dad that you thank God for them and respect them amen but you want to give more answers to your spiritual our heavenly father amen amen because the natural is passing away but the spiritual goes on to Eternity amen amen God help us that's right that's right Amen brother brother sister and again there there are and I know over the years I've made a number of Believers there was more and more caught up with the natural family yeah and less with the spiritual God help us amen he said again he said they made the Holy Spirit he said teach us today the things we ought to know amen and may we then in return listen closely to every word and weigh it deeply amen and then he said May those who are listening by way of a tape he said may they listen close and may we be able to catch what the holy spirit is trying to reveal to us what's he trying to reveal to you today he said before we realize if we if you should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain it's for a purpose that it might work to the good of the Lord amen is it working to the good of the Lord to be a witness for Jesus morning noon and night amen and he said may we have the freedom to speak the freedom to hear and access to Faith to believe what we have heard amen as it comes from God's word amen and that it might count up to us eternal life in the great day that is to come bless us today Lord and he said condemn us when we're wrong yes the Lord is there to convict you if you're going to step out of line but are you there to receive that conviction are you there to acknowledge that conviction and just don't think oh my Lord help us don't think if if you're doing something and there's a conviction comes on you don't think well that's the devil no it might be the Lord might be the Holy Spirit don't blame it on the devil just make your calling no wonder the Bible told us make your calling and your election sure amen make sure that your anointing is God not the devil that's right because there's a false anointing make sure your Revelation is God not the devil that's right oh yeah Satan is going to agree with it but yes God said but yeah he agreed the message that's right oh yeah yeah here's the prophet said but yeah yeah forget the butts amen believe the word stay with the word regardless of the price you gotta pay amen [Music] regardless of the sacrifice that God is going to require of you stay with the word amen I tell you you stay with the word I'll tell you more and more we stay with the word the greater and greater the separation that we'll experience when it comes to family friends and neighbors all due respect but again stay with the word God help us yes amen he said bless us today condemn us when we're wrong yes maybe he's doing some of that to some of you today when we're wrong and let us know the thoughts that we have we are false oh yes you got false tiger faults don't ignore the Lord when he's when he's revealed it to you don't ignore the Lord when he's trying to get you away from it to separate amen so let us know the thoughts that we have and he said bless us in the way that is right that we might know which way to go and how to act in this present world oh yes don't act like the world don't take their spirit you are not of the world no no you're gonna you're gonna live absolutely totally different light you got a different attitude a different Spirit oh yeah it's the word it is the word you're going to go forth revealing the word reflecting the word living the word and it not that you say oh I got to do this like no you just know it's normal if you've been if you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost amen is it just normal you you just automatically go out and live the word yeah you go not a matter of just responding to the word amen what you what you say how you say it what you do how you do it amen it's going to reflect the word it's going to reflect Jesus in you it's not you that lives it's Christ that liveth amen praise the Lord Brother that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen EastEnders in and becomes one with you and you're one with him he's in total control amen thoughts words and deeds amen whatever you do you do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen so he said go and how to act in this present world and he said that we might bring for Honor in our living here to Jesus Christ oh my Lord my Lord help us that we're going to go for reflect Jesus testify of Jesus love Jesus amen that Jesus will be as real to you as he was to them two thousand years ago amen Amen brother he was with the disciples amen minister to the disciples laid out his life came back and appeared to the disciples and brothers come back to you he said Lord that we might bring honor in our living here to Jesus Christ amen amen who died to give us life in the great hereafter we ask this he said in Jesus name amen amen and that was the message that he preached on why cry speak amen why cry speak the word amen amen and his text with what I was reading in the in the book of Exodus amen and he said in Exodus 14 he said and when Pharaoh June I the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and be all the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt as thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore as thou doubt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word that we did tell the thee in Egypt and saying let us alone amen that we may serve the Egyptians for they've been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness we're not here to serve denominationalism you know we're here to serve Jesus amen and listen he said and he said listen close he said Moses said unto the people very not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he shall show you today for the Egyptians whom ye have seen it today you shall see them again no more forever amen the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward let's keep going forward in the word let's keep going forward in the message that's ordained to give us the resurrection and rapturing faith what are you looking for what are you believing for on a daily basis amen just another revelation of the message just another mystery this mystery that mystery brother it's ordained to give us a resurrection and rapturing Faith it's ordained to take us into the reality of the Resurrection to take us into the reality of the Rapture amen by the grace of almighty God amen and he's the Lord should unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the tomb of Israel that they go forward amen for lift up though thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea and I behold I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians and they shall follow them and I will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon all is hosts upon his chariots and upon his Horsemen amen amen and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have gotten me honor upon pharaoh upon his chariots upon his Horsemen amen and the angel which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went before their face and stood behind them and a plane between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the night amen amen amen amen God brought a complete separation and God is going to bring a complete more complete separation between is elect and the world oh yes definitely so that they just won't want nothing to do with you there be an absolute total complete separation unto the Lord God help us are we going to endure that separation all down Through the Ages hold out through the word that God has called separation brother right from the beginning in Genesis there was a separation between Cain and Abel oh yeah Kane offered the rate are able offered the right sacrifice or you have the cane of Cain offered a sacrifice too they think always they're unbelievers so they won't do this they won't do that but Kane was a believer Ava was a believer in God and they were both they were both serving God they felt that one felt to do this another one felt to do that who was right Abel was right amen but Cain just seeing what Cain offered his altar was full absolutely full oh okay you're wonderful oh look what you've done look what you're sacrificing all that he had and all that he was growing or whatever you know when he took it and put it on the altar to the Lord give it to the Lord give it to the Lord and so on and what are they will do oh my able where's your sacrifice where's all that blood where'd that come from he killed the lamb what Abel what you will you do that for it was by faith he offered undergo him got a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by faith it was revealed to him Redemption was in in the shedding of blood for Cain oh he just felt that he he could just you know just give all this to the Lord give all that to the Lord you know all that he had I don't know how much time it was but all that he had spent and and grown and did this and did that and came and a Abel's offering didn't seem like very much just the lamb and he went and killed the lamb Abel what'd you do that for amen Redemption was in death not in what what came they've grown not in these vegetables it wasn't in his fruit and all that no no cable would have got the lamb and killed the lamb Abel knew about the shedding of blood what he did yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah how many how many knows regarding the blood that was shed in the Garden of Eden I trust by Grace God will give you the revelation of the blood that was shed in the Garden of Eden and brought sin only there was blood oh he is there was Bloodshed in the garden because and it was the result of of sin result of that sin most people are not aware of that no they didn't shed no blood they did sin and a testified of their sin God help us to be more sincere not others to believe God help us to stay with the word God I would stay with the truth amen not man's stories of a man Veil and how man went into sin no no man's oh we met he wouldn't eat this fruit he wouldn't eat that he shouldn't have done it no you need to take it a little further than that God help us he said the word of the Lord is so great the word of the Lord is so good there's just no way to stop reading it he said it just becomes Life as we read it amen listen he said I think in this text this morning he said I'm just going if your Lord willing to speak upon this because it drives me down and I hope it drives all of us down that we might see and cause us to look up and study a little bit in comparing the day that was then onto the day that is now they dealt with sin then we're dealing with sin now he said why cry speak the word why Christ thou unto me speak to the people that they go forward and listen in this text he said Moses crying out to God in the time of trouble and God rebuking Moses back right when trouble was in session and it's just nature seeming like for a person to cry out and then what a rebuke it is for God to turn around and rebuke him for crying out to him it looks like it's a very hard thing but he said many times when we look at the scriptures in our own way of looking it seems very hard but if we study a little while we find out that all the all-wise God knows just what he's doing and he knows how to do these things and how to deal with man he knows what's in man he knows him we don't we only know from the intellectual side but God knows what's really in the man amen he does and God knows what's really in you God knows what's really in me he does your feelings your emotions your thoughts your revelation or lack of Revelation God knows he said Moses was born in this world as a gifted boy and he was born to be a prophet a deliverer he was born with the equipment born in him as every man that comes into the world is born with this equipment amen you're born with the equipment to fulfill God's purpose God's purpose in your life it's there if you let God in too Quicken it [Music] amen make it alive amen hallelujah amen and brother if your seed of God the anointing comes in the united quickens it they do not see to God there's not nothing that that seed is not there no it won't Quicken you a person can be religious but not spiritual but if your seed of God you're spiritual hallelujah amen amen he said listen he said as I firmly believe in the foreknowledge of God the predestination not that God is willing that any should perish but all might come to repentance but being God he had to know and does know the end from the beginning amen he isn't then he said he if he doesn't then he isn't infinite and if he's not infinite he's not God so he wasn't willing certainly that any should perish but he knowing who would perish and who would not perish and that's the very purpose that Jesus came to the Earth was to save those that God through foreknowledge seeing that wanted to be saved God knows whether or not you want to be saved in your seat of God you have the hunger and thirst for salvation you want to be saved and that's why the Savior was that came that's why he was sent he said that's the very purpose that Jesus came to the Earth was to save those that God through is for knowledge seen that wanted to be saved Grace amen bear with me a moment he said there's only one covering for sin and that is the blood of Jesus Christ and it cannot be applied unless God has called you from the foundation of the world amen and he said that's what the blood was shed for not to be tramped upon made fun of he said evil is spoken of he said it was for a direct purpose not to be played with not to be impersonated by saying that the sins are covered when they are not and he said no man can have his sins covered lest his name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world amen Hallelujah thank God Amazing Grace amen amen Amazing Grace that our names were on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world testifying that we were redeemed before the foundation of the world amen Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws you and all that the father has given me past tense he said will come to me so you can't make the words lie they are there for truth and for correction and Moses was born with a gift of faith great faith Moses had and he said we see it after a while coming out in him in Moses faith he said he was strictly a type of our Lord Jesus Christ amen he was born in a very odd birth like the Lord Jesus he was born in a time of persecution like the Lord Jesus he was born to be delivered as a deliverer like our lord Jesus he was Aid of his parents away from the enemy like the Lord Jesus amen he was hid of his parents away from the enemy and he said and he come to his time of service like the Lord Jesus he was a leader like the Lord Jesus Moses he was a prophet like the Lord Jesus amen and he said he was a lawgiver like our Lord Jesus Christ he said he died on the Rock and he must have rose again because 800 years later he was standing on the Mount of transfiguration talking to Jesus amen where did he come from oh Moses you're dead no he was dead he appeared on the mount and he was talking to Jesus amazing amen see he said the Angels packed him away and no one knows where he's buried even the devil didn't know and he said frankly I don't believe he or he ever was buried I believe that God packed him away and he died on the Rock and he had followed all the days of his life he was a perfect type of Christ amen and he says he was born with this great gift and quality within him amen and then it was only taken something to flash across to bring that thing to life see the seed of God is actually placed in us from the foundation of the world amen and when that light that strikes the seed it brings it to life but the light first has to come upon the seed amen grace of God to us thank God for the experience that we have testifying of our relationship with God Hallelujah he said I have taught it many times of the little woman at the well though she be an ill-famed person and though her life was degraded and she was at in that condition because that tradition had never touched her but though when that light first struck her quickly she recognized it because there was something there to respond to it and brother is there something in you to respond to the light to respond to the word that is not you in your head but is God in your heart it's your it's you on the inside of the inside there's too many got it up here but they don't have it down here that's why the prophets had added it up here and he says well you can have God he said 24 hours a day he said in your life amen and go to hell if it's in your heart no no you won't go to hell yeah you're going to go to Glory you go to heaven you've got to go go to be with Jesus amen because it's on the inside of the inside amen these are in deep calls to the Deep there must be a deep to respond to that call amen and Moses here was born this prophet he was raised in an intellectual school and a Pharaoh's Palace the Pharaoh said he that he was raised up under it was a man that still had honor and believed Joseph being the prophet of the Lord but there came Ramesses after seti and did not care about Joseph and so therefore there's when the trouble started when they are raised up a pharaoh who did not know Joseph God just a couple more quotes he said Moses being born with this great gift of faith then he was anointed and commissioned at the burning bush to deliver God's people now he says see what great qualities this man had he was born for a certain thing and God had a purpose he said God's got a purpose of you being here he had a purpose in Moses he got a purpose in you and if you can only get to that place how much trouble you save God and yourself amen Amen to serve God's purpose it's a tremendous challenge to our faith are you are you serving God's purpose be being here today are you serving gospel that's right amen there's a reason amen he said listen Moses he was born brought to the place where he was anointed and noticed a seed laying there with the intellectual conception with all Faith he was born to deliver this people and yet it never come to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across it and not something he read about but something he'd seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back and I think he said in the intellectual conception of what they think the word is is and so forth never can have a full Foundation stand until they have met that light that brings the word to reality amen he said I think no church in its practice no matter our intellectual and fundamental it might be that church cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is made known among that people amen something they can talk to that'll talk back to them that'll vindicate his written word amen amen he's speaking of the burning bush he said Moses knew this intellectually he said and the seed that was born in him was laying in his heart and he tried through his intellectual experience with the word to try to bring out to deliver them because he knew he was born for that purpose amen he knew that the time the scripture all said that they'd already been there 400 years just as we know now as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and the rapture and listen to what he said he said we know we have lived the time out and if we live the time out in July 1963 where are we today where are we today 2022. amazing it's amazing I was born in 1948. that's when the angel came to the prophet he said well thank the Lord the grace of God to us that after all these years that we're here believing the word after all these years we're here acknowledging the gods sent a prophet he said listen just as we know know now as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming and the rapture we know we have lived the time out and the time of the Rapture is at hand if it's that and then if it's at and now surely now well you say oh many it's many years brother Gerald yes to us it's it's many years but to God is is very little time there are too many that are judging will judge it by time as as a human but let's judge it by time spiritually oh brother it's been all these years 50 odd years since he said this yes that's right but in the eyes of God but at just a moment not much 50 years is not much time there's too many Believers are discouraged because this was 1963 and we're still here there's many so-called Believers feel that oh no it couldn't it couldn't have been the Lord must have been just William Branham no no all those years is not much in when it comes to God no he said we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the churches together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out of in the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us we see a God who can take a cancer that's eat a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give rapturing Faith to the people and he said that when that light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and taken into the heavens yes there's got to be something like that happen and our schools of theology can never produce it yet the intellectually are all right but you've got to meet that light and you've got to find that something amen and he said here Moses he said based in his great call upon the word and he said until one day he met this light and these are the very word itself spoke back to him and then he got his anointing that anointed and he said what he had in him and he said that on the inside amen it anointed that that he believed amen and brother is he not hearing what we believe is going to bring it to pass in our lives do you know any of what we believe is going to bring it to fulfillment concerning the resurrection and the rapture brother we need to delay in the presence of God till that till that Revelation is Anointed and we're going to see it as God ordained for us to see it yes there's got to be something like that happen and our schools of theology can never produce it yet the intellectually are all right but you have got to meet that light and you have got to find that something amen let me read again he said in here Moses basing his great call upon the word amen unto one day he met the light and the Very word itself spoke back to him and then he got his anointing that anointed what he had in him and he said that on the inside and brother the anointing is coming on the bride to anoint what we got in our hearts concerning the resurrection and the Rapture by the grace of God look up the hour of our Redemption is at hand amen amen because God is bringing out these Revelations now others are bringing out Revelation and causing people to disbelieve amen for yet God is bringing up the Revelation that's causing us to believe more and more and more have faith in God Amen amen he said what an anointing that anointed he said that what he believed he said what anointing he was he was commissioned and he said we know intellectually he aired his mother he knew what was going to take place and he knew he was living in that day but he found out he was a failure himself so he his faith might have dropped back a little bit but then when he comes to the bush God said I have heard the cries of my people and he said I remember my promise to their fathers Abraham Isaac Jacob and I have come down amen he said see I the personal pronoun I have come down to deliver them and brother what God has promised concerning for this hour and this age in which we're living now he has come down to deliver his elect into the resurrection and into the Rapture by the grace of God amen he said don't go away and say brother Brandon said it's 10 years to the rapture I do not know nobody knows not even the angels of heaven but he said I know it's getting awful near for the signs that he said would be taking place and he said it'd be even at the door and we're getting them right now amen so he said are you young people are you old people he said who are out of Christ God help you and he said Now's the Time this is the hour if you haven't got the Holy Ghost receive it and he said for those that are in Christ will God bring with him the rest of them will go under the judgment and if you're not in Christ tonight hear my word for only those that are in Christ will go in the rapture God help us to be in Christ the word Amen to go in the Rapture by the grace of God let us believe what God has said and let us believe what God has done yes but let's believe what God's doing amen amen and what's he doing he's changing us from time to Eternity he's changing us into resurrection and rapturing glory amen oh it's tremendous what God has done but I'll tell you it's even more tremendous what God's doing it God did this God did that God did this through William Branham and it's true through this evangelist through that evangelist but brother what's he doing to the bride he's taking us from time to Eternity oh yeah they tapped into eternity and did this did this but came back to time amen but now God has got the anointing to take us into eternity not come back to time praise to us glory amen yes Grace praise the Lord God bless you let's stand amen oh didn't think I was going to be that long let's sing it's for our brother down there is 261. oh come and go with me to my father's house amen praise the Lord and I'm on my way up there to my father's

be in prayer for one another we're at the end let's keep looking for the resurrection just keep looking for the Rapture and not just looking for it let's live with the anointing that's expecting it
