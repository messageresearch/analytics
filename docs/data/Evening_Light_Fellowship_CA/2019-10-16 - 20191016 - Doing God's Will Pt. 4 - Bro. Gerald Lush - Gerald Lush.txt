[Applause] amen grace Jesus [Music] amen me and I will be a man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] a man [Music] Oh Lord I will be healed by the grace of God a man a man [Applause] [Music] a man Amen praise the Lord Amen thank God for His grace amen to God be the glory there stands the only really all things are possible as we go to the word and let's be in prayer amen for the grace of God to be with us and but those not with us today we pray grace to them amen that or be with them all things are possible amen but well we want to make sure is that it's the will of God amen again as our prophet brought out and it was really the first time although I've maybe read it never thought about it the prophet of God said you know why do you want to be healed we think because they're sick they want to be healed no you got to have a right motive and a right objective and it's got to be for the glory of God amen because you could have that selfish mortal and say well I just want to be you because I'm sick and he's the healer and many times that's why that's why they were after the Prophet is because why they just wanted a sign they want they want a God to do this they want a God to do that but they weren't going to do anything for God a man just to say they believed in God just maybe to go to church but when it comes to believing what God wanted wanted them to believe there was something else a man so again this way the prophet of God did say and there's a tremendous statement he says you can be healed and go to hell a man why because your motive is not right and your objective was not right a man you're not there for the glory of God you're there for selfish motives and selfies objectives a man my brother in all things we want to give God the glory a man-friend of realizing why because we were born in sin and he and he came and did what he did to save us he came into what he did to take us back to a to Eternity and he didn't have to do it a man the probably God said he could have started all over again he could have wait the whole thing off and and there there are there are ministering brethren over the years they really believe that God to all that he did that because this is in the beginning God created the heaven in the air period so but what happened they said well we believe according to what was written in Jeremiah was written in by another prophet to some where God had created and another creation there and what happened he said they just turned themselves over to the devil and what did God do he said God come down and wiped the whole thing off and he started again and that's why the Genesis 1 and 2 in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth hey man and an Indian into one or two where he made eat meat this he made this he made this he brought the light a man he brought the light he said let there be light that he made this he made it then he made Adam and he a man again he started over but this time he had the predestinated plan of redemption a man that man was going to fall but he was going to redeem man but that first creation gave themselves completely over to the devil and brother there's a reference to it in the book of Revelation where the Bible says all of these demons are brought down out of out of the river all these demons come out of the end of the water amen in the end the last days God's going to turn it loose on the on the world amen brother what is it where these demons come from that was the Jim that was that regeneration that was that that first creation that God destroyed a man and then you know the Bible says the earth was covered with water a man God did that so when God came in and he told the water to go back and the water for this water for that those demons were still in the water where did when Jesus cast the demons out of this man where do they want to go hey man thank God for thank God for the revelation see scripture scripture bears witness the scripture scripture balances scripture a man and they wanted to they wanted to go into the water they wanted to go into the ocean they wanted to go into this end into the river a man and they went in that's right okay said go and they left they left the man thank God brother for the scripture a man thank God for God vindicating his word by grace all brother oh there's no as I said there's nothing wrong with this book there's no mistakes here it's now it's not like the brother that wrote me as I said everybody he sent me an email some years ago and he said always said I read this book he said three times and he said of so full of mistakes he said I don't believe it and I said brother brother there's no mistakes I said the book is written in such a way I say this is to get the attention of the believer and give them faith and I said it just cause the the make believer to doubt and I sister turned the unbeliever away I said God wrote it in this way so I said what are you I saw you a make believer and unbeliever or a believer he never answered a man so I say maybe an unbeliever but I tell you this if you're a believer you're gonna believe it in you because you know God don't make no mistakes a man the mistakes are in man man but not God so God God is perfect thank God for the revelation of his word praise the Lord just give him the glory amen brother there's no mistakes as a believer with the mind of God and the revelation of the Holy Ghost we read from Genesis to Revelation amen and we see the plan and the purpose of God amen and God is doing exactly what are your deign to do from the beginning I pray that he's doing what he Ponk want to do in you and him me Amen unto eternal life by grace amen this singing only believe all things are possible oh oh oh playing her possible only Lily amen [Music] [Applause] Oh later possible [Music] [Applause] [Music] all possible because [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] honey grace Lord Tivoli it is by grace through faith that we're saved Lord it is by grace through faith that you reveal to us Lord what you want us to believe by grace through faith you reveal to us Lord what we need to believe for the salvation of our souls Lord for the redemption even of our bodies a man because it is written in the word that will receive a new body even a glorified body like under your glorious body so we're asking the grace of God to believe with all of our hearts we're asking the grace of God to believe with a complete belief and lore that we're not going to question you we're not going to doubt you anybody but by the grace of God we believe we believe it is written we believe us say of the Lord Amen Alleluia and father of all the word that you have given you have not Alleluia neither has not failed on one word so father I pray grace in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ father that we believe absolutely believe a man in our hearts right from the inside out Lord that we believe with that complete belief a male father that you can trust us amen we trust you amen so we ask the Grace and anointing of your presence we ask the gracious Lord of the anointing order of the revelation of your word the grace you know any Lord of what you have done and the grace of the anointing or the revelation of what you're doing hey man and the Lord that you will find in me and you were finding my brothers and sisters absolute faith you'll find in me and in my brothers or sisters that we delay what you are doing Alleluia Lord that what you have ordained what you have predestinated what you have prophesied a mayor that you are bringing it to a pass in our lives Alleluia nor that you are using me you're using my brothers or sisters a man to make the word to live in me to make that word live in my brothers and in my sister's name and that one you have prophesied what you have promised for these days for these last days is coming to pass because Lord that you have found this generation that believes and you have found us to believe it is written thus saith the Lord morn grace that you are here amen more they are not gone you haven't left us but you've revealed yourself to us amen and we thank you for that and we pray the grace in your presence to continue Lord revealing to us what you want us to believe amen to reveal to us that you want us to believe you have sent the Prophet you have revealed your word Lord you have and you are giving us that perfect bait for the resurrection and for the rapture grace we pray Lord for your glory your honor obey for your praise amen to believe thus saith the Lord to delay nor that we are witnessing them the Word of God for this hour for this age father that you are bringing it to pass you are fulfilling your word but Lord you're doing it in us you're doing it through us you doing it for your glory your honor your Prince help us to let go and let God in his way Grace in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ forgive us of our seat forgive us of our doubt forgive us lord I pray in the name of Jesus forgive us for our questions I pray father that you'll take all questions away you've got the word more to answer everything a man who revealed the word father to give us the revelation of what's going on in this world Amen Lord what the devil is doing and what you are doing we know Lord the enemy has come down knowing as China short the Lord you have come to give your bright face amen considering the hour that we're living nor you were giving us the faith to face this day the face this hour to face the challenge of this hour so that we believe amen and we keep on believing a my grace for the resurrection grace for the rapture amen help us to keep looking up in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the glory of God [Music] glory praise the Lord is Shayne Ward now I be [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen god bless you turn with me to the book of Exodus chapter 31 32 Exodus chapter 32 a man I was bring greetings from brother Tom snow that I spoke with him a couple of nights ago and appreciate his fellowship on the phone and he mentioned the the brother that he was maybe expecting some time next year and but he has no assurance of exactly when and he's sort of hoping that it might be sometime in June of next year and it's a brother Andrew Glover but he said again we have no assurance or to be exact that exact time and so he would keep in contact and let us know and because he had already mentioned to the brother concerning coming to st. John's that he would minister in central new plan and that he would come to st. John's again that's why he wanted to meet to him to assure him of that and so I said yes brother just keep us in contact I said and and let us know exactly that when the brother would come so we'll see and as he hears from the brother because the brother is ministering and he is he's got a like I say is watch on his on his agenda so we pray the grace of God and the will of God at the time that God would want him to be here a man and also a brother Andre head of course that and he would prefer not to come here in wintertime but he see wilfer prefer to come come maybe during the spring or the summer so no doubt maybe he might be considering driving here and that's why you would not want to come wintertime I don't think it would mind him when it comes to the weather if he were just flying but again this a brother was was here one time and visiting the me he was saying oh my he said I don't think I would be able to live here you might consider it you see her during the winter and I said what brother if you're called of God you will live here and I said remember I said you you God's got to have somebody here to be a witness so I see regardless of the weather oh yes he said he never thought about that I said well I said there are those that want this and want that and want that so maybe I said it if we went and did what we wanted to do maybe we would be well we wouldnt want to go to Florida we pray for the the grace of God for the saints that are in Florida we want we want to go to California and we pray for the grace of God to those in California but we would like go somewhere where there is a less snow and more Sun but again if it's the will of God for us to be here be here amen thank God for our sisters here from the United States a man that and there's some of the feel that like they were born raised here they've been after a few years they settled right in so God God blessed our sisters a man as they just yield to the change amen by the grace of God so it's the calling of God what is the will of God where does God want you to be that's that's the question a man so brother wherever God wants me to be that's where I want to be a man regardless again the weather got nothing to do with it there's nothing at all no not by any means and whatever the will of God is we're there to be a witness for the word amen so God's grace to us and the Lord help our brother Andre and lead him at the right time to be here when the Lord would want him to be here I pray the Lord then he'll be here but at the same time again if God is doesn't want our brother to be here during the winter we'll that's fine the will of God be done a man so grace to us and also oh yeah i I did to share a quote with our brother concerning the taint that we that we played and he was blessed by the by the quote and concerning yes amazing concerning that the tension that a believer is under as a Christian we when you become a Christian you come into her into a life of tension and man and knowing that on Monday we were visiting with my brother in paradise there and of course my brother from Gander was in as well and his wife she had to see a doctor and my brother who lives here he turned on the television there and he turned on I'm not sure I not sure well I think was YouTube he said and he and he turned on a service a church service and it was a Salvation Army church service and it was the church service that he was to himself on Sunday and his wife and the so the Army's well you might be pleased with with his sermon it's only thirty minutes and so I said well or die says they should be thankful that it's not me that's preaching and as I got some notes here from brother brother Matthew and he was saying I think he took an hour so yeah he said well I said with you he said to be several months he said using those notes and it would be a man but this brother this army officer and I don't recall his name now but it was good I appreciate it he was leading the people in worship and praising the Lord then he went into the word and a nicer well I said he was preaching basically what I was preaching on and I said on Sunday we were we were preaching on basically the same thing and he was talking about the scripture be thankful and he said you don't be thankful the but ask the Christian life is a thankful life and it but he said it doesn't mean that I said he said everything is according to the way you want it and he says sometimes you said God puts us under the pressure under the stress under the strain he said buddy said be thankful don't just saying God he said for a win-win when God does this and God does that oh yeah you like this and you like that no no he said even even when you're going through the hard time we're going drawing going through the trials and the testings he should be thankful a man and he was bringing out all these things and and I said O Lord I said that's good I said I said bless him a man and so it was a blessing to us could we listen to his entire sermon and and the service so I pray God continued Lester brother see like keep your attitude right toward those out there because remember the many of them are going to be saved many they were going to be there outside the city not necessarily in the city they're now bright but they are believers a man and brother god bless them is my prayer there they're going to stay faithful to what what he what he is ministered by the grace of God amen so again God is not only very speaking it to us he God is revealing to us one way but he's speaking it to the others another way so God blessed them and also just to ask you to keep brother John in prayer he's as these decisions to make and of course he'd be going to Ontario I believe to start some studying there or some something in in in a university there so we prayed God help our brother and meet our brothers needs by grace a man so keep him in prayer and I understand that if he goes he'd be going of course he'd be starting in January and he'd be there until August so grace man gonna miss our brothers fellowship for sure and brother Matthew will miss him them there same thing so God has blessed us with his presence for sure a man and also to keep our brother vital in prayer enjoy his fellowship at brother Matthew's a man and Sundy so we thanked I thank the Lord for that and two for the Rebbe for the fellowship we had around the Word of God and what God has done for him and what God's doing for a man it was good thank the Lord may have to get him to give another testimony a man part - hey man so also - I was going to ask her brother market he would minister for us on Wednesday a man so I just let him know so he's got time to get ready a man and also these items right here now I received I think we received these last year from the voice of God from brother Joseph so just to let you know that there are some extra extra ones we have here I was plenty of maybe sending them overseas but I brought them back here just and if you would like to add them you can take them or share them with somebody else and it is what it is of course it's the key and and it says take this key the key of the name of Jesus and open every gate that as you bound a man in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ so you can have another copy of it and also the letter that comes with it explaining about the key amen praise the Lord in Exodus chapter 32 verse one and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the Mount the people gathered themselves together under Aaron and said unto them said unto Him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we know not what has become of him and Aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people break off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto Aaron and he received them and their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf this is amazing amazing we think well this won't happen and that won't happen around the message well if this happened here around Moses message what will happen around the province message a man sure brother and especially in this our Father where we're in the we're in Jesus said it was so bad and it said in the world is going to be so insane he said he didn't shorten time there being no flesh saved a man so consider what they did here coming out of Egypt and just think what they experienced a man the the ministry they experienced a message that through Moses and they were they were hearing and seen in Egypt my oh my oh my the spoken word of God coming down in Egypt and doing this and doing this and doing this amazing and yet when they come out because the Prophet was gone into the wilderness and into the mountain longer than they thought he should a man here is Aaron going out to make a gun an image for them to worship a man and it wasn't it was it didn't make the image of Moses they so brother I pray the grace of God brother in this hour and they say when the Prophet has been gone for over fifty years Moses was in the end in the mountain for over forty days a man so brother Bentham has gone for over 50 years so brother and we're still here amen but now tuna there's a lot of becoming it just all my they're just a form of godliness in their faith a form of godliness in what they believe they're not believing exactly the way the problem of God would want us to believe it in this hour not even the seal or the enthusiasm that they had when the father of God was here amen they don't have the seal in the enthusiasm that we had 50 years ago they don't have the zeal and enthusiasm that they had even 40 years ago a man they know they and they never had that zeal and enthusiasm amen 40 days after Moses was in the mountain a man so they wanted my they wanted a errand to do they do something else stir them up Oh God have mercy on us brother in this late hour brother they all God that he'll shorten time so that you're you're going to be saved here shorten time so that we're going to be saved shorten time so that we'll go in a resurrection and in the rapture by the grace of God amen because that's the insane world we're living in a man and Aaron said unto them again verse 2 break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people break off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them under Aaron and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy God's o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt brother it was Jehovah not the golden calf and when Aaron saw it he built an altar before it and Aaron made Proclamation and said tomorrow is a feast to the Lord and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and they brought peace off and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play a million brother the hour was serious they came out but let's go in a man that was the problem they had there they never had the zeal the enthusiasm to go in they wanted to come out but whatever going in we want to come out as Weber don't pray O God thank you you brought us out of out of you know that Egyptian denominational Egyptian bondage your brother said you delivered us from that and all as well as I heard him play one time and Lord now we don't have a sorry to no man because they thought you know they were subbing to the denominational leaders and so on no no no and I said lord I shall help that help that brother believer I said ain't marryin I said they need to get the right revelation of what you've done in their life and what you're doing Amen he brought us out but now we got to go in amen brother and there's so many believers that we're right there right there right there come out come out thank you too Lord thank you thank you for bringing us out yeah but whatever going in a man brother's going to be all in vain just as we'll have you stayed there if you're not going to go in sure brother we got a hair again look for the fray we had the faith to come out now let's find the faith to go in and the same message that gave us the faith to come out that message has given us the faith to go in by the grace of God Amen so brethren and it says they rose early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play and the Lord said unto Moses get the go he said get thee down for thy people which have brought us out of the land of Egypt and corrupted themselves amazing and they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them that they have made them a molten calf and a worship yeah worship the calf and have sacrificed their on - and said these be thy God's o Israel which have brought thee up out of the land of and the Lord said unto Moses I have seen this people and behold it is a stiff-necked people they were stubborn now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax art against them that I may consume them and I will make of thee a great nation and Moses besought the Lord his God and said Lord why death I wrath wax art against thy people which thou has brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath Moses was interceding a man on behalf of Israel and he said I repent of this evil against thy people remember Abraham Isaac and Israel they servants to whom thou swearest by thine own self and sets unto them I will multiply your seat as the stars of heaven and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seat and they shall inherit it for ever and the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people it was the Spirit of Christ in Moses Amen it are sitting for Israel their spirit of Christ interceding for you and me God bless his words you may be seated turn with me to Leviticus chapter 10 Leviticus 2:10 and the inning read at verse 1 and net ebb and a bayou the sons of Aaron took either of them his censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered strange fire before the Lord a mayor it was not according to the Word of God they offered strange fire before the Lord and there's many a believer this offering strange fire before the Lord strange worship based on a strange revelation a man is not exactly according to what God has revealed is not exactly according to what God has done in this day an hour is not what God is looking for a man brother God revealed in his word and through Moses and through and yes Aaron - we exactly what he was doing and what he wanted in the people a man God has revealed through the Prophet in this hour exactly what even what he did and what he what he's doing and what he wants to see in you and me a man sir brother sister are we reflecting the message of the hour are reflecting what God wants us to reflect a man what is God looking for in your life whether it's God looking for in my life a man when it comes to the spiritual revelation a man I'm not talking about the natural or the physical things but the spiritual things a reflection of the revelation of the message Sarah how am i reflecting it how am i responding to it brother an and when it comes to the believers out there as I say their lives are not reflecting what what was they used to do for reflect back back 40 years ago or back 50 years ago a man brothers sister and not only their the father was recognizing it back even before the Lord called him off the scene and we might as we get into these messages right here we might maybe touch on that quote where the power of God is acknowledging that the people are not experiencing exactly what God has done a man there there that it's not it is not is not coming out of them the way they're graded that he felt that it should come out of them they're not responding to it the way that he felt they should respond to the revelation of what God was doing a man it would turn through brother branham it was a tremendous thing brother concerning the the owe me of the word concerning the revelation of the seven seals it was absolutely amazing a man but again he felt that the people were not responding to the word the way they they had the bride would respond amen brother and when he left to see if how he felt everything was getting cool a man and a form of godliness and it was it was her brother's sister I trust by the grace of God that we're not going to stay under the influence of the religious spirit and just have a form of godliness a man I trust by the grace of God the word is going to strike us the way that God wants in this drinketh hey they made the word that the word were striking Israel the way that God wanted to strike the Jews when they were in Egypt amen they they really wanted to come out they really wanted to do this so God came down in the end Moses and God did this and God did that brother you talked about the signs and the wonders they saw a man in the Ministry of Moses in Egypt and what God came in God did this we God did that you tell me the miracles a man and God God was showing that he was gone a man it wasn't the God said that the Egyptians were worse for me amen it was it was it was Jehovah hey man and brother and you think about it you could consider the things that he did in Egypt and he do this and he did that and showing brother that man couldn't do it ain't married holy God could do it a man only hello him could do it only Jehovah could do it the self-existing one by the grace of Almighty God ain't man but again maybe they thought back here the same thing that some were thinking here in this day an hour and I was and I was surprised when her brother mentioned to me just two or three months ago and he and he said all he said I was talking to a certain sister and she was telling me about whether Branham there brother Branham was there was a magician and I brother Baron the OED just he just in magical things and I say what oh yeah he said that's what she thought about brother Branham that he wasn't a prophet he was a magician and I and I wish I was surprised when I was going through the messages a couple of nights ago and I came across this one right here and I said oh my I said Lord I said maybe this is where I don't know if she got in here she would I don't say yes she would have these books and it was a message in 19 and 64 paradox and and this is what he said and he said a certain Baptist Church he said that my little family went to the other day and they have been down at the median Tucson and he said the pastor got up and he said not knowing that the boy that goes with my daughter might be brothers George Smith he said as a member there and he said the pastor said you know I just learned brother branham's father and mother traveled in a circus and he said oh they were magicians a man just sing over 50 years later they're still believing it over 50 years later they're still saying that's what that said that's the anointing that was on William Branham that's here that's the only that caused him to do this and cause him to do that he was just a magician amen and he said he said they were magicians and he said that's a little trick that William Brown does yeah and he said I guess it was a trick that heals the sick and he said I doubt he said whether my father and mother ever seen a circus he said they weren't in a circus they had seen a circus and he said they'd never seen an automobile til I had one a man so we're in the world to get that revelation that they were in a circus and they were magicians and that what brother Brown did was just a magic but they don't make sense and he said they said they'd never brother Allen said his parents he says they never know nothing about it and he said you see the devil has always got to say and he said they told Jesus this do or they do this by Beelzebub yeah they said Jesus was influenced by the devil to do what he was doing and basically were saying that William Branham was influenced by the devil doing what he was doing what he loved the sink brother you don't you dare to be anointed by the devil to say something like that you'd have to be anointed by the devil to believe something like that a man why for someone to come and do good for someone to come and heal the sick not only of the sick but the Rays of the day a man because even the Dead was raised up whether there's anything in the Ministry of Jesus whether in the Ministry of William Branham and only that be even even our brother Wesley John Wesley Oh mine the old my shirt I believe it something to died even in this day and he went and prayed and the dead raised up hey man and another time he I believe is horse he was writing and he broke his leg and he got off the horse and got down and put his hand on it and pray for it and it was healed a man and the horse was ready to go again a man sir brother that's God that's not the devil the devil is here to break the leg the devvra's they're there to make you sick but he's not there to heal you no I'm not by any means ain't man brother I pray God help us to believe lord help us to trust your Lord elbows their faith amen brother we got a big people today they got they got faith in this and faith in that they got faith in natural thing more faith than they got in the spiritual that is the absolute truth brother die listen if we don't have the faith for healing how are we going to add the faith whether for the rapture brother we carry we don't have pay for it for the healing of the body are we going to pay for the change of the body a million father gonna change our body from physical just to absolutely natural to absolutely eternal a million shall we go ahead at the end of this and this physical fleshly body into a glorified body like under the body that Jesus saying like under the body that Jesus laid down and Jesus picked it up again hey my brother was a glorified body so how can people believe that this is the devil doing this this is the devil doing that god help us to Danny hey man but if you're sick and if you got this remember that's the devil that's where Kagura brother and if sickness and death come from the devil then brother I believe that healing and life comes from God amen Oh Satanism Satan is not there that they do to do that a man he says here to get us to don't a man he said he get us to disbelieve not to believe so he said you see the devil has always got to say and he said they told Jesus they do this by Beelzebub by the demo and they had to answer something to their congregation why don't they search the scripture and see this was predicted today it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it is Jesus yesterday day Jesus today and Jesus River god help us to believe what Jesus said and oh brother we need we yelled what a challenge it was that hour when Jesus was approaching death amen he said Billy he said I am the resurrection and life believe us now this amen he didn't challenge them before he channels him when he was approaching the third pole of his ministry he tell us and when he was approaching death he was approaching the crucifixion that he was going to lay his life down but did they believe he was going to pick it up amen and share it with

Jesus Christ hallelujah the revelation that was that was in the bridegroom is now in the bride amen the fullness of the Godhead body was in the breakroom the fullness of the Godhead bodily is in the bride aim and he reveal himself little by little by little by little amen he revealed himself in Luther it says I'm just I'm the one that justified you Luther I'm doing distraint if either the Methodist I'm the one does the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost amen amen and the gifts of the Spirit it was Christ now praise the Lord I'm the resurrection and the rapture amen they need a justification they'd either say dedication we needed it hey man we needed what God was doing good God he got on my praise the name of the Lord again is Malachi 4 and he would restore all things amen and he says in Malachi we'll come he lied to become he's going to do this he's going to restore not melikhaya but the prophecy of Elijah and he'll restore all things and that wasn't John he was referring to the last one the entire here's her into this day this earth amen he would restore all things to give us the faith that we need for the resurrection and the rapture amen amen amen amen praise the name of the Lord sir brother he restored all things and he came in restore justification sanctification and the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen what was he doing brother he was coming through the prophets he was in this proverb a bi measure by measure by measure he was in Elijah with a greater measure of the anointing amen till finally the gut puppet was made flesh it was God it was Christ a man in flesh the word was made flesh amen and to finally I named brother as he was doing to the Jews amen they joined to the Jews he was tuned to the Gentiles is revealing himself little by little by little and we know that in the Dark Ages the enemy came in and they lost the revelation of God that lost the revelation of who started it what what it started how it started and so on but then God began to restore it in the days of Luther amen oh yeah they went into Dark Ages Amen it is prophesied in the word but then God said I will restore amen Luther Wesley the Pentecostals but now once this restore what are you gonna do what's left now oh oh he's gonna profit yeah and now we got the mysteries of the word yeah well what what he did what did he do it for amen that's like when the guard prophet come oh yeah well praise the Lord he's gonna do signs and wonders all he's gonna do things now oh my that the other prophets couldn't do and you know it comes to all yelling Ely you'll speak the word and he'll do this and you'll do that yeah and then they believe maybe you die go on no yeah he had laid out his life and pick it up again amen amen and so and in this in this when it comes to the Gentiles what he was doing for the Gentiles old God is gonna do this God's gonna do that amen oh yeah one day we're waiting for the resurrection we're waiting for the rapture no they're waiting on us amen the old Cessna Saints were waiting on Jesus yeah the Old Testament Saints were waiting on Jesus that he was gonna lay his life down and he was gonna pick it up again amen and we picked it up he would picked him up amen and now brother they're the the the New Testament Saints are we on Christ in his bride amen amen let's give the glory to God let's get the glory to Jesus amen again it is not me as I you is crazy at us creatures in the belly a man and brother as a prophet of God is holy said they are waiting on us brother Eric how much longer are we gonna keep him waiting and know that he said God's waiting on us oh and for the Worldport of the boys part out there in the world the world's waiting on God that is the absolute truth brother when it comes to religion and and what they believe and concerning the resurrection concerning the rapture concerning the end they're waiting on God to do this God to do that and all brothers yes sir if we recognize what the devil is doing surely we recognize God is here cuz Satan is the god of this world brother saying I control and that's why we see what we're seeing out there in the world a man a man a man oh my little brother sister it's to remember that as I said it's getting less and less and less spiritual because why because even Catholic churches have closed and brother and there's a lot of Protestant churches have closed oh yeah I've gone to places and I looked and I said oh that that's a catheter they said yeah but it's closed what closed oh yeah they they just use it for a wedding or something like that and but it but they don't and there's no no not enough here now to have services and you go somewhere else and there's there's just a Protestant church here a Protestant church here and I know somewhere else and it's closed not like it used to be amen that's the truth and only that you get in there and I know that it was somebody that I know one time that used to lead in a song service and oh and he was getting to the places in my own mind he said they early want to sing yeah he says he's just right there and and he's in he and I know they that he would have to tried it come on come on come on sing yeah no I'm not interested and the number Saturday night now are not neared there's a lot of empty seats yeah and that's why more and more churches are closing and then one lady spoke to me and we were discussing something one time and she said she said pastor I gotta agree with you and she was an Anglican lady and she said she said I used to teach Sunday School and she's sitting in in the church and now she said there's no young people no no she's does not and not only that she said there's nobody in our church she said maybe younger than maybe 50 years old sure what no she said everything has changed now they're getting fewer and fewer and fewer very merry brother it's prophecy God warned us that this was going to happen and that was going to happen amen but brother the thing of it is they put Jesus out so rester was out there gonna lose this they're gonna lose that anointing amen brother I tell you your message churches that have put Jesus out all due respect but their message searches that they don't let Jesus have control Jesus is not controlling their thoughts Jesus is not controlling their words this is not controlling their lives now by conviction no no they ignore it now but bothered by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're convicted if you got the rapture to the Holy Ghost brother and not that not that you're perfect in in your body but you're perfect in your soul amen and then you're gonna do wrong easier to convict you and what you do you repent amen and you're your fellowship with God is restored again as the public God said when your theophany body and he said when you when you sinned he said your theophany bodies who will step from you and he says you'll be convicted when you repent he said he comes up closely again and your fellowship with God is restored hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen God helps to be conscious and sensitive a man to the anointed presence of our theophany bodies again brothers true the mystery of God that we they we that we have been given the revelation of theophany bodies amen way because this is the hour of the resurrection and the rapture and the theophanies are waiting on us amen and it's God or God is waiting on us well God is with them God is in them amen and then there we on us what for the resurrection the power of God said it might been in the invisible union and we'll see but he said he said all he said at that time of the resurrection at the time of the rapture he said the dating krase are going to appear to the living st. amen and he said the living Saints are gonna be changed instantly into glorified bodies and we'll go into that dimension and he said somewhere if you find a quote let me know and he said we're gonna fellowship one with another there yeah we're gonna throw it with those four this age and others have fellowship with the Lutheran's and the Methodists and all that but will will fellowship with Egypt without everybody eventually yeah but then he said after assert a little while he said we'll look up hallelujah hallelujah we'll look I be sitting there with Jesus this descending and he said we'll rise to meet him but for the marriage supper of the lamb hallelujah he said we're not going to a marriage issue were going to a marriage supper amen we're married here by the grace of God I accept them and he accepts you I trust he's accepted you amen and he's giving you the token of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life a may that he has received you by the grace of God brother amen God Elvis to be a god Elvis a recognize what God was doing then 2,000 years ago God is doing now it was the revelation of God in flesh then mr. revelation of God in flesh again amen the fullness of the Godhead bodily in the bright for amen because what he did then he's got to do now resurrect and rapture by grace god help us amen and he said it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he is today and will be forever and he said that's it he said the way they try to do it the Pentecostal uneducated the Provost visions Jesus alive today after 2,000 years is a paradox he said it certainly is a man it was Christ 2,000 years ago the resurrection and rapture then now it is Christ now the resurrection and rapture now now we got the revelation of why God did what he did why God prophesied concerning Malachi 4 and restore all things brother he restores it all but then God don't leave us a man he restores oh well I'm weak person for something but I think goes just sto they open you the seals no he restored all things in the last few hundred years not just now but he had to he had to restore justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost a gifts of the Spirit and to a finally brother we come to the end now Lord what is it Lord we got the we got all of this now what else is there now it's the fullness of the Godhead bodily for the resurrection and the rapture God did this through this prophet that true prophet that prophet and there was Elijah and we know that Elijah all my considering what Elijah experienced and Elijah experienced and so on and a finally brother yeah just no wonder God said he wouldn't take it larger before run the first coming of Christ and the second coming of Christ amen he would do this in his first coming do this in his second coming restore all things a man but brother hallelujah what did he do lay down his life picked it up again for the Jews now he's laying down his light he's laid down his light and picks it up again for the Gentiles it is a Gentile bride by the grace of God brother brother let's make sure that we're doing God a service but according days will Jesus we was he was doing doing God's service but he was God in flesh and he was doing the service according to the word according to the will of God amen old brother and the bride is gone all if it's if it's God in in Jesus it is it is God in the bride it is Jesus in the braid and brother what for so that she's what she does she's going to do it according to the will of God now I do God a service without his will is to do God a service according DS well amen brother thank God for the revelation of what God as done so that will recognize what God is doing amen shall we recognize what God did in flesh 2,000 years ago brother sister of God help us to realize what God is doing in flesh now but the end result was there what is the end result now are we getting closer to it or further away from it oh my lord my lord my lord the closer Jesus got to it he couldn't get away from it no he couldn't get he couldn't shake he couldn't shake that revelation you know man oh yeah they knew there's something going on in Jesus life they knew there's something going on in his ministry because oh he was acting different he was talking different and it's like I said he the Bible says that his face was set to Jerusalem yeah and well it's not exactly what the what the year did he say booth didn't want it he told him what was going to happen and Peter said no no no no we don't want that no and he said get thee behind me Satan amazing Jesus said to Peter get thee behind me Satan for thou savourest not the things that be of God he never had the revelation of what God was doing in flesh amen he never had the revelation of what the Messiah had to do lay down his life and pick it up again amen never the revelation that is sin and to be paid for he to redeem Peter there was no other way he had to lay down his life Peter didn't know that just they he had more problems with Peter than he did any other I like what brother George brought out and that God chooses those a man you know here's Paul who killed killed Christians killed Christians killed Christians and yet God went down and called it oh praise the Lord hallelujah amen you talk about sinners saved by grace amen the grace of God in Paul's life and God chose him as the messenger of the age yeah just amazing he was them what would you choose him brother we get we better get the mind of God amen we better get the mind of the holy gold we get we get the leadership of God in our lives hey Mary yes as like I said I preached that years ago over fifty years ago I pressed it as a young man right because I saw believers believers believers professing believers with wrong spirits and wrong attitudes and they were looking down their noses and those up there in denominations oh yeah they were oh they thought that they were up here and they were righteous and they were good oh yeah because they believed the message and the Prophet you know and so on no they didn't now and they were looking they don't know oh they go that church ah they go to that church I said well that's you what for the grace of God yeah I said don't you do that and as I said and you know the I guess I mentioned so often did you know the scripture that I used back there over fifty years ago Matthew you don't have to turn to it you have heard that sandé thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies amazing praise the Lord love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you yeah don't look down your noses thank God for the grace in your life and he said pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you know believers came out and persecuted them mother believe your little children now that's the truth to that now that's true back there years ago and even today they're believers persecuting those out their persecutors you know you don't do that jesus never persecuted them not only that when they questioned Jesus Jesus never opened his mouth didn't say anything and that they would they marvel at that you're not saying nothing oh very why don't he condemned the Pharisees why don't he contend the scribes look they're out there and they all want to crucify him crucify him crucify him and he never opens mouth and yet believers are hoping their mouth to condemn to criticize don't you do that that's their go show but for the grace of God and the proud like the prophet of God said he said I can condemn what what they do but not damned I can't contain them no no you keep it right attitude toward them a bright spirit toward them personally but you you just take your stand for the word and he and you got to make sure your spirit is right you add to his right if you and you got to do it right when it comes to saying I want to condemn this I want to connect you better do it right let God do it yeah I have a right spirit and a right attitude you know by the grace of God brother you should love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his Sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust so he's there to bless them and bless you oh yeah god help us and I emphasized if he love them which love you what reward have you oh you love one another because you believe the message I said God's gonna prove your love by others hey man you do you love that brother do you love that sister god help us amen so you say the love they which love you what reward have you and he said you do not do not rather he said even the publicans the same and if he salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect and that perfect is maturity is not sinless there's not sinless perfection is being mature as God is mature amen so it says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so it's it's maturity by the grace of God and it says in this passage our brother said the father's kind kindness not is since sinlessness is the point in question is not your sinlessness it's your kindness you have a right spirit and a right attitude towards those out there amen and yet but I was dealing with back there Oh as I said they looked down their noses at everybody if they weren't in the message don't do that see the problem God said even concerning the Pope he said I wouldn't go in and and kiss his finger and his ring whatever and this and to acknowledge these things but he said I'll call him brother what yeah I call him brother amazing how many believers would say that how many believers would do that yeah well I tell you it takes the Holy Ghost amen knowing that he's got to have control yeah showed the Holy Ghost in control if you're going to say this it concerning a certain brother or say that concerning somebody else god help us yeah it's like listening to those that brother preach and the others pray and the others worship I said Lord bless them yeah not look down your noses ah oh they're there in that church during they're under that no no no just leave them I see in the hands of God you know leave it leave it with the Lord amen pray for them yes but you got what's the good to pray if your attitudes not right what's the good appraised your spirit in that right no you got ever right add to right spirit God looks at that and then in that God will honor and respect is a right attitude and a right spirit see Thank You Laurie concerning what God was going to do to Israel oh brother God does this then God does that to bring out Revelation God does this to bring out what this brother feels what that brother thinks and so on how would you react if God so God said this God said that oh your God so yes yes Lord your God but
