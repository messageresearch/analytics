[41:21] to reading I was telling them when it's
[41:23] up there I read it fast because you can
[41:24] read it and you don't need me to read
[41:26] slow but apparently helps if I read it
[41:28] slower so I'm going to try and slow down
[41:30] here tonight and just relax and and not
[41:32] worry about the time or anything like
[41:34] that and we're just going to have a good
[41:35] time in the Lord amen amen 1 Corinthians

[42:06] all Apostles are all prophets are all
[42:08] teachers are all workers of Miracles
[42:12] have all the gifts of healing do all
[42:14] speak with tongues do all interpret he
[42:16] says but covet earnestly the best gifts
[42:19] and yet show I unto you a more excellent
[42:22] way amen God bless you you can have your
[42:24] seats this evening amen we're continuing
[42:26] our series on manifesting time and and
[42:28] taking another service on my adoption
[42:31] and now we're getting down today is
[42:32] where we get down to where we live what
[42:34] we do why our purpose what our purpose
[42:37] is what we're doing here on this Earth
[42:38] why God put us here in the first place
[42:40] and so I want to establish us always
[42:42] from the word of God you know I've seen
[42:45] what quote Wars produce and it's just
[42:47] div Vision amen and you can take a quote
[42:49] and you can run with it and if you take
[42:50] it out of context or you shave a little
[42:52] bit here a little bit there you can make
[42:54] it say anything but the scriptures flow
[42:55] from start to finish absolutely
[42:57] and that is that is where we go for
[42:59] these things so back in John chap 14
[43:02] John 14 and: 16 and Jesus is talking he
[43:06] says I will pray he's telling the
[43:07] disciples about what's coming he says I
[43:10] will pray the father and he shall give
[43:12] you another comforter that he may abide
[43:14] with you forever even the spirit of
[43:17] Truth whom the world cannot
[43:19] receive that means that there are people
[43:21] that cannot receive this truth because
[43:23] they cannot receive the spirit of the
[43:25] truth and without the spirit of the
[43:26] truth truth you'll never be able to find
[43:28] the truth anden it takes the Holy Spirit
[43:30] to open these things to our eyes and our
[43:32] hearts he says whom the world cannot
[43:34] receive because it seeth him not neither
[43:36] knoweth him but ye know him for he
[43:39] dwelleth with you and shall be in you I
[43:41] want you to notice here Jesus is saying
[43:42] the spirit of Truth is here right now
[43:45] and they don't recognize it he said but
[43:47] you're going to recognize it because you
[43:49] recognize it now you'll recognize it in
[43:51] the future but as people don't recognize
[43:53] it today he says they're not going to
[43:54] recognize it tomorrow when it's in you
[43:56] they're never going to understand what's
[43:58] going on here he says I will not leave
[44:00] you comfortless I will come to you
[44:02] that's a real hard scripture for those
[44:04] that believe in a trinity because he
[44:06] says I'm going to come he says the
[44:07] comforter is going to come to you
[44:08] another comforter and then he says I'm
[44:10] going to come to you he says I will come
[44:11] to you yet a little while and the world
[44:14] seeth me no more but ye see me and
[44:16] because I live ye shall live also at
[44:20] that day what when the spirit of truth
[44:23] comes when the comforter comes you shall
[44:25] know that I am in my father and you in
[44:27] me and I in you and this is the mystery
[44:30] of God being revealed right here this is
[44:32] the full picture of what God had in his
[44:35] mind before the foundation of the world
[44:36] and it's a full picture of what God was
[44:38] trying to do all along and we can see
[44:40] here what it was like in the Garden of
[44:42] Eden was you had a perfect Unity of the
[44:44] children of God with Christ himself and
[44:46] God walked in the garden he walked with
[44:48] Adam and his wife and and then that
[44:50] picture got erased and this mystery got
[44:53] hidden it was flowing right along and it
[44:55] was supposed to come out but then
[44:57] something happened and Satan Twisted it
[44:59] up and we lost the picture of what the
[45:01] mystery of God looks like but now in
[45:03] this age we've had a messenger come back
[45:05] with a restoring message and what does
[45:07] he do he reveals what the mystery of God
[45:09] was all along amen we don't have a new
[45:12] message we have a restoring message
[45:15] that's what Malachi 45 and6 tells us is
[45:17] it's a restoring message it's it's
[45:19] bringing us back to something that was
[45:21] there originally and in Revelations 10 7
[45:24] it says that this that under this Angel
[45:26] message we have what the revealing of
[45:28] the mystery the finishing of the mystery
[45:30] of God it started all the way back in
[45:32] the mind of God and it started really in
[45:34] Genesis but then it was put into a
[45:36] Hiatus because of sin but now under the
[45:38] Covenant of Grace he's coming back and
[45:40] he's bringing us all the way back to
[45:42] that original position so we see the
[45:44] revealing of the mystery before our very
[45:46] eyes now I've read this quote many times
[45:48] and I know we've heard it many times but
[45:50] I want to just speak it this morning
[45:52] this evening so we're we're standing on
[45:54] familiar ground brother Braham says God
[45:56] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[45:59] himself Jehovah's Tabernacle he says
[46:03] it's not me that doeth the works it's my
[46:05] father that dwelleth in me saith the son
[46:07] he doeth The Works in other words he
[46:10] says in that day the father was the vine
[46:12] and he was the branch to Bear the fruit
[46:14] of God he says Jesus was the the branch
[46:16] to Bear the fruit of God now he becomes
[46:19] the vine who Christ becomes the vine and
[46:21] we become the branch and all that was in
[46:24] God was poured into Christ
[46:28] and we can all say Amen like we just did
[46:30] but now he says are you ready here it is
[46:32] it may gag you a little but listen all
[46:35] that was in Christ was poured into the
[46:38] church he's explaining John 14 he says
[46:41] the works that I do shall you also More
[46:44] Than This shall you do for I go to my
[46:46] father he says do you see it we are
[46:48] living under our god-given privileges
[46:51] that God has redeemed us to church I
[46:55] believe this morning this evening that
[46:56] we're living under our privileges you
[46:59] know why I believe that because I see
[47:00] that there's more in the word I see that
[47:03] there's more for us I see that under
[47:05] this prophet's message he showed us that
[47:07] there's more there's a greater Victory
[47:09] there's a greater surrender there's a
[47:11] greater overcoming there's a greater
[47:13] signs and wonders there's a greater
[47:15] gifts all of these things are greater
[47:17] why because we're under the revelation
[47:19] of restoration and Redemption Amen to
[47:22] redeem or to restore means to bring back
[47:24] to its original condition and I don't
[47:27] know about you but I'm not in my
[47:28] original condition yet I've got aches
[47:31] and pains more than I ever used to and
[47:33] I'm I'm aging and I'm turning gray and
[47:35] I'm getting older and older and Satan
[47:38] still has his strongholds in this flesh
[47:40] that I'm dealing with that's not the way
[47:42] we were meant to be amen but under a
[47:44] time of redemption under a message of
[47:47] restoration we know that everything has
[47:49] to come back to its original and until
[47:51] I'm there I know there's more as long as
[47:54] I'm not where I need to be as long as
[47:55] I'm not in a a Rapture yet then I know
[47:57] there's more for me and it's not all in
[48:00] the in the outside in the power of God
[48:02] in the external but it's the internal
[48:04] man that needs these changes as well
[48:05] there's things in me that have to be
[48:07] changed and overcome amen so until we
[48:09] get a body change there's going to be
[48:11] work and that means there's more for me
[48:13] to expect amen there's faith that I can
[48:15] have and there's expectation I can have
[48:18] for the Lord to do things in my life
[48:20] amen now we took a bit of a detour in
[48:22] the last two services on on this thought
[48:25] of my adoption and it wasn't a detour
[48:27] cuz the scriptures were in my notes all
[48:29] along and and we talk so much about
[48:32] unity and I want to talk about Unity
[48:34] because remember adoption is placing us
[48:36] into a body it's not placing us into a
[48:40] position where we're out on our own
[48:41] doing our own thing but it's placing us
[48:43] into the body of Christ and that means
[48:44] we've got to be able to get along we've
[48:46] got to be able to work together we've
[48:48] got to be able to recognize and
[48:49] appreciate the things that each one
[48:51] brings to the body of Christ and
[48:52] appreciate the differences and look past
[48:55] where they maybe rub us a little wrong
[48:57] and I know that the Lord dealt with me
[48:58] on several things in studying and
[49:00] preaching that and he's still dealing
[49:01] with me on things and I'm trusting he's
[49:03] doing the same thing in our lives amen
[49:04] that we can sit here and say we can
[49:06] always be closer but I want to read one
[49:08] quote here and and I I I I wanted to
[49:11] preach it last service but just for the
[49:13] sake of time I left it out but I want
[49:15] you to see what what this Unity looks
[49:17] like and and what can even bring it and
[49:19] brother bam he's quoting that song when
[49:21] we asunder part it gives us inward pain
[49:24] and he says I've seen the time brother
[49:26] he says let me not condemn us but let me
[49:29] just wake us up to
[49:30] something he's saying I'm not I'm not
[49:32] trying to hurt you here but I'm trying
[49:34] to tell you we used to do it differently
[49:36] he says I saw the time in this church
[49:38] that when people had to wait until
[49:40] Wednesday night to meet one another they
[49:42] would cry over it he says and that's
[49:45] right now he says and and I saw
[49:47] ministers come in here and would say how
[49:49] do you do it then people they're just
[49:52] with one
[49:53] heart ministers would come in they say
[49:55] brother brandom how do the people people
[49:57] get this way how do you have such a
[49:59] close- niit group of people I've had
[50:01] ministers come in here and say that
[50:03] about us and man I'll give you a pad on
[50:05] the back this evening they come in and
[50:07] they say it's wonderful how you
[50:08] Fellowship together and you're close and
[50:11] you just like to spend time with one
[50:12] another and they say we don't see that
[50:14] many
[50:15] places let's not lose it let's not let
[50:19] the little things that pop up from time
[50:20] to time separate us from that closeness
[50:22] of Fellowship of seeking out our
[50:24] brothers and our sisters and spending
[50:26] time with them but brother baham says
[50:28] here's how they keep it listen up he
[50:31] says they meet at the
[50:34] door and them sisters meet one another
[50:36] back there and they hug one another
[50:38] saying sister be sure to pray for me now
[50:41] honey I'll see you again Wednesday night
[50:44] you'll pray won't you you pray for me
[50:46] and I'll be praying for
[50:48] you he says and making like that with
[50:51] tears in their eyes see the brothers
[50:53] Shake one another's hands they could
[50:55] just hardly get get away from each other
[50:57] like that he says that's real Christian
[51:00] Fellowship see just waiting and praying
[51:03] for each other yes sir that's the way
[51:05] they should be I've been to churches
[51:08] where 10 minutes after the minister
[51:10] stops preaching and the songs are done
[51:12] everybody's
[51:14] gone and I say Where's the
[51:17] Love where's the body we've read the
[51:20] scriptures in John 14 we read the quotes
[51:23] of brother R says we are a body we are
[51:25] the word made flesh and people will say
[51:27] well we come to church to hear the word
[51:30] we do but guess what this is not the
[51:34] only word that's in this building anden
[51:36] we read the quotes that said this is the
[51:38] word we are the word made flesh today
[51:41] and if we're coming in and we're doing
[51:43] this and we miss it in our brothers and
[51:44] sisters have we really gotten the
[51:47] word we can make an idol of the
[51:49] preaching and ignore the effect that it
[51:51] has on the body we need Fellowship we
[51:54] need to spend time we need to pray for
[51:56] one another we need to to to hold on to
[51:58] one another amen this is a body word
[52:01] that's here it's the bride of Christ
[52:03] that's here and it's the word made flesh
[52:05] amen and so we don't just run out the
[52:07] door we what we Fellowship we wait and
[52:11] pray for each other I appreciate it
[52:13] after service seeing people that don't
[52:15] run out the door and I know I I'm not
[52:17] getting on you this evening by any
[52:19] means sometimes we've got to go but
[52:21] people that'll sit here and they'll pray
[52:23] and sometimes you're not praying for
[52:25] yourself you're praying because your
[52:26] brother or your sister is sitting over
[52:28] there and they're praying and you say
[52:29] they need me whatever they're praying
[52:32] for Lord would you help my brother and
[52:33] sister that's a wonderful thing when we
[52:36] can sit here and wait for each other and
[52:38] pray and hold each other up before God
[52:41] Amen brother Brown would say this he
[52:43] says Moses Veil he was the Living Word
[52:46] to the
[52:47] people he says and today the people that
[52:50] are veiled are the same thing they are
[52:53] written Epistles read of all men not a
[52:55] new epistle but the epistle that's been
[52:57] written made manifest it's those who
[53:00] believe the word and the promise of this
[53:02] day that God is pouring out his Spirit
[53:04] upon All Flesh that is written Epistles
[53:08] that's why I like to spend time with
[53:10] Believers because it's the word coming
[53:13] to the word there's an automatic
[53:15] connection when you meet a Believer
[53:17] that's got the Holy Ghost there ought to
[53:19] be there ought to be why because there's
[53:22] something in them that's a part of you
[53:23] and there's something in you that's a
[53:24] part of them cuz you're part of the word
[53:27] amen you're part of the bride of Christ
[53:29] now I want to take us back that was just
[53:31] a just a a little finish for last
[53:34] service but I want to take us back to
[53:36] the the quote I read a couple services
[53:38] to go because remember adoption is about
[53:40] our positional placing within the body
[53:42] of Christ amen it's the role that God
[53:44] has ordained for each and every one of
[53:46] us before the foundation of the world
[53:48] and I want to read this quote from here
[53:50] himym brother Braham says what God wants
[53:51] to do with the church tonight wants to
[53:53] do with an individual is find somebody
[53:56] the Holy Spirit searching to find man
[53:59] where he can take him out to a certain
[54:01] place speak to that person anoint them
[54:04] give them something special great powers
[54:06] and gifts to work his will and to do his
[54:09] will now we look at this quote and we're
[54:11] going to we're going to reflect on this
[54:12] at the very end of service but we look
[54:14] at that and we say
[54:16] wow
[54:19] wow where do I fit into that what is my
[54:23] great power going to be how is it going
[54:26] to anoint me what is the something
[54:29] special that God has ordained for my
[54:34] life that's a big
[54:37] quote and what happens is when we see
[54:39] something like this is we build it up in
[54:42] our
[54:43] mind and we forget the Simplicity that
[54:46] is God being revealed so many times but
[54:49] keep this in here we talked we talked
[54:51] about Moses we talked about David and
[54:53] Joshua and Samuel and Peter and Paul and
[54:55] Gideon and all these different people
[54:57] that God came to them he spoke to them
[55:01] he anointed them he gave them purpose he
[55:03] put his power behind them and then they
[55:05] went out and they did wonderful things
[55:07] and you'll find with these people that
[55:09] they weren't
[55:11] perfect but they were prepared they were
[55:14] prepared God did a work Gideon needed to
[55:17] Gideon needed some Cal alongs Gideon
[55:20] needed some prompts needed some pushes
[55:22] he needed some support to let him know
[55:25] that God had chosen him and he asked God
[55:27] for a sign and then he flipped the sign
[55:29] and said well let's do it the other way
[55:30] that way it could have been natural this
[55:31] way I'll no it's not natural and then
[55:33] God has him do one thing and then God
[55:35] has him do another thing and God's
[55:36] encouraging him and encouraging him
[55:38] sometimes we think it's just going to be
[55:39] this big burst of power and we're going
[55:41] to do it listen we're not all
[55:43] superheroes some of us need a little
[55:45] more encouragement than others but
[55:46] regardless when God chooses us then
[55:48] he'll provide whatever it takes to get
[55:50] us across the finish line to get his us
[55:52] to do his will and his word amen don't
[55:54] sit there and say I can't do it no if
[55:56] he's called you and he's chosen you
[55:58] you're going to be able to do it because
[56:00] he's with you all the way but I want to
[56:02] pick up where we started in this service
[56:05] in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and it's
[56:07] where we left off in the last service he
[56:09] says now ye are the body of Christ and
[56:12] members in particular that word that
[56:14] phrase members in particular means we
[56:16] each have a specific function and
[56:18] purpose individually no one of us is
[56:21] alike some of us can be very similar in
[56:24] certain ways but not a one of us is
[56:25] alike don't ever have the exact same
[56:28] role he says and God has set some in the
[56:30] church not all some some in the church
[56:34] he says first apostles secondarily
[56:36] prophets thirdly teachers and after that
[56:39] Miracles then Gifts of healing helps
[56:42] government's diversities of tongues now
[56:44] we've talked about this before but just
[56:45] to remind you the first gifts are to
[56:47] bring the word the word is the most
[56:49] important
[56:50] thing it's the most important thing the
[56:53] word is always first signs and wonders
[56:55] and demonstration are supposed to follow
[56:57] that if we're leading with signs and
[56:59] wonders we've gotten it wrong we lead
[57:01] with the word we follow with signs and
[57:02] wonders that's the way that it works
[57:04] amen if we've gotten the signs and
[57:05] wonders first we're out of order God
[57:07] always sends his word first but notice
[57:09] here it says that he set some so some
[57:12] have this some have this some have this
[57:15] and then after that you have others that
[57:16] have this this this and this but then
[57:19] then Paul says are all prophets are all
[57:22] Apostles are all prophets are all
[57:25] teachers in other words is everyone a
[57:27] minister brother visha was talking to us
[57:31] at the fellowship on on Sunday talking
[57:33] about a a friend of his that believes
[57:34] that everyone should be in the ministry
[57:37] well Paul's saying
[57:39] no no all chiefs and no
[57:42] Indians if everyone's a preacher then
[57:45] who's going to
[57:46] listen right right not everyone's a a
[57:50] part of preaching not everyone's a part
[57:51] of teaching and then he says they're all
[57:53] workers of Miracles
[57:56] well brother John you just read this
[57:57] quote where you're talking about God
[57:59] wants us to take us and give us great
[58:01] gifts and great powers and this and that
[58:02] and the other thing and Paul says is
[58:03] everybody going to work miracles no no
[58:07] by no means he says have all the gifts
[58:10] of healing do all speak with tongues do
[58:13] all interpret Paul's saying not everyone
[58:15] has these sorts of gifts and certainly
[58:18] nobody has all of them more importantly
[58:22] right God ordains them God drops them
[58:24] down and God uses dwelling vessels
[58:27] that's what we'll see now some are
[58:29] ordained vessels if you're in the
[58:31] ministry we see we see it in in Jeremiah
[58:33] we see it in John the Baptist and these
[58:34] different ones you're ordained to that
[58:37] but gifts can be different gifts can be
[58:39] dropped down and pulled up it can be on
[58:41] you one day gone the next and then
[58:43] there's people that are born with a gift
[58:44] that's with them no matter what and
[58:46] we'll talk about that as we go through
[58:47] this and maybe a little bit tonight but
[58:49] but certainly as we move forward so Paul
[58:52] goes through all this he says he he's
[58:53] placed all these gifts and then he says
[58:55] does everyone have all of these is this
[58:58] what we're talking about here is this
[59:00] what our focus is and then we come to
[59:02] verse 31 he says but covet earnestly the
[59:05] best
[59:06] gifts but then he says and yet show I
[59:10] unto you a more excellent way now Paul
[59:13] would go into 1 Corinthians 13 naturally
[59:16] and he would go in and he'd start
[59:17] talking about charity and charity is
[59:19] that that Greek word Agape which means
[59:21] divine love and it represents the holy
[59:23] spirit in scripture we've talked about
[59:26] before it's only in the New Testament
[59:28] because that's the only place the Holy
[59:29] Ghost was given in the way that we
[59:31] receive it Paul would talk about all
[59:33] these gifts and then he says there's a
[59:34] more excellent way and what is it it's
[59:37] the holy spirit in the
[59:39] individual so that means the gifts can
[59:41] be without the Holy G Holy Spirit as
[59:44] well so that can't be the the the
[59:46] excellent way or the more excellent way
[59:48] it has to come by the holy spirit amen
[59:50] the purpose of the holy spirit is to
[59:52] bring all these gifts subject to God
[59:54] rather than subject to man man amen
[59:56] bring them subject to the spirit of God
[59:58] rather than the spirit of man we're not
[1:00:00] supposed to covet what other people have
[1:00:02] but Paul says these are what's available
[1:00:05] and he says covet them desire them seek
[1:00:07] after them why that you may edify the
[1:00:09] body that you might do something good
[1:00:11] for people that we wouldn't just be
[1:00:13] warming a Pew I appreciate people that
[1:00:16] warm the pews it's it's hard to preach
[1:00:17] the empty pews but that's not the only
[1:00:19] reason we're here each one of us has
[1:00:21] purpose and he says seek to help the
[1:00:24] local body seek the best way that you
[1:00:27] can but don't pick it seek it and let
[1:00:31] God give you what he would determine to
[1:00:32] be the best but then Paul says after all
[1:00:34] of that he says I show unto you a more
[1:00:36] excellent way and I know we covered this
[1:00:38] when we preached on the Statue of a
[1:00:40] perfect man out of second Peter 1 but I
[1:00:42] want to read this this chapter of 1
[1:00:44] Corinthians 13 because the the thing
[1:00:46] we've got to realize is that without the
[1:00:48] Holy Ghost anything you try and do in
[1:00:50] the body of Christ has no purpose or
[1:00:54] profit and that's that's our hard thing
[1:00:56] to say but it's true because what sons
[1:00:58] of God are led by the spirit of God God
[1:01:00] puts a spirit in us to lead us and guide
[1:01:03] us into his will for Eternal value
[1:01:05] otherwise we just end up Kingdom
[1:01:06] building for ourselves so the more
[1:01:08] excellent way the mature way the only
[1:01:10] way for the believer the acceptable way
[1:01:14] is found in 1 Corinthians
[1:01:16] 13 and Paul says though I speak with the
[1:01:19] tongues of men and angels and have not
[1:01:21] charity I am become a sounding brass or
[1:01:24] a tinkling symbol he says say if I don't
[1:01:26] have charity and I do all these things
[1:01:28] I'm just noise I don't have any real
[1:01:30] purpose I don't have any real benefit
[1:01:32] I'm just breaking the
[1:01:34] silence right the the claim that the
[1:01:37] Pentecostals have that that that the
[1:01:39] speaking in tongues is the evidence H
[1:01:41] Holy Spirit falls falls apart right here
[1:01:44] because Paul says if I do that and I
[1:01:45] don't have charity then I'm I'm
[1:01:48] nothing so I speak with tongues but I
[1:01:50] don't have charity then I'm just
[1:01:52] somebody that makes a bunch of
[1:01:54] noise that's hardly the place for a
[1:01:56] Believer to make their
[1:01:58] credit I break up the noise that's no
[1:02:02] benefit that's no benefit to anybody but
[1:02:05] this word charity here is that agape and
[1:02:07] it literally means the Beloved he says
[1:02:10] without the Beloved if I don't have the
[1:02:12] Beloved I'm just a noise
[1:02:16] maker then he says and though I have the
[1:02:18] gift of Prophecy and understand all
[1:02:21] Mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[1:02:24] have all Faith so that I could remove
[1:02:26] mountains and have not charity I am
[1:02:30] nothing so now he's covered virtually
[1:02:33] all the gifts that we just talked about
[1:02:35] in 1 Corinthians 12 all the spiritual
[1:02:37] gifts if I could put it that way and he
[1:02:40] says without love without the Holy Ghost
[1:02:43] I'm nothing though I have those gifts
[1:02:46] without the Holy Ghost I'm nothing so
[1:02:49] that means that the gifts and the Holy
[1:02:50] Ghost are not the same thing are they it
[1:02:52] means you can have one without the other
[1:02:55] and that he says and though I bestow all
[1:02:57] my goods to feed the poor though I give
[1:02:59] my body to be burned and have not
[1:03:01] charity it profits me nothing good works
[1:03:04] good intentions charitable Works they
[1:03:06] don't amount to a hill of beans without
[1:03:08] it being led of the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:03:10] mean you don't help people no Mother
[1:03:13] Teresa never got the Holy Ghost but she
[1:03:15] helped a lot of
[1:03:16] people but we're talking about eternal
[1:03:19] value
[1:03:20] now but watch while Paul flips the
[1:03:23] script here now he says charity suffers
[1:03:26] long and is kind charity envieth not
[1:03:30] charity vaunteth not itself it's not
[1:03:32] puffed up here's the evidence of having
[1:03:34] the Holy Spirit we know that the fruits
[1:03:36] of the spirit follow but Paul's giving
[1:03:38] us an Evidence of the Holy Spirit here
[1:03:40] he says charity does not behave itself
[1:03:42] unseemly doesn't seek her own is not
[1:03:45] sensually focused ego it's not focused
[1:03:48] on selfish interests it's not easily
[1:03:50] provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not
[1:03:53] in iniquity but rejoices in the truth it
[1:03:57] beareth all
[1:03:58] things it can support whatever load you
[1:04:01] put on it he says it believeth all
[1:04:05] things it hopeth all things it endureth
[1:04:08] all
[1:04:10] things and then he gives these great
[1:04:12] three words charity never
[1:04:16] faileth the Holy Ghost never fails he
[1:04:19] says but whether there be prophecies
[1:04:21] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[1:04:23] they shall cease whether there be know
[1:04:25] know it shall vanish away you look at
[1:04:27] that it says prophecies tongues and the
[1:04:30] word of knowledge that's that's like the
[1:04:32] trifecta for the charismatic church
[1:04:34] today that's what everybody's trying to
[1:04:36] draw people to them with is prophecies
[1:04:38] tongues and a word of knowledge trying
[1:04:41] to tell you what's going to happen
[1:04:42] trying to tell you the blessings of God
[1:04:44] over you all these different things
[1:04:45] that's what they do to draw people to
[1:04:47] themselves and Paul says these will all
[1:04:50] fail or
[1:04:51] cease they'll either be false eventually
[1:04:55] or they'll just
[1:04:56] stop they'll come to an
[1:04:59] end so we're supposed to cover the
[1:05:02] greatest gifts that are available how
[1:05:04] wonderful it would be if the Holy Spirit
[1:05:06] would drop down on a brother or sister
[1:05:08] here and they would stand up and say
[1:05:10] thus sayeth the Lord and they would warn
[1:05:11] us of an event that's
[1:05:13] coming not to go here brother Brown
[1:05:15] would say or not to go there or don't
[1:05:17] drive your truck today or or don't go to
[1:05:19] work today or don't do this or don't do
[1:05:21] that what to preserve the local
[1:05:24] body if and wonders were on a constant
[1:05:28] display in this church it would be a
[1:05:29] wonderful thing I would love that but
[1:05:32] that has never been the saving power of
[1:05:35] God it's it's a benefit but it's not a
[1:05:38] leader it's not something that we're
[1:05:40] supposed to be looking to all the time
[1:05:42] and Paul says without Divine love
[1:05:44] without the holy spirit all of these
[1:05:46] things they'll come to nothing they'll
[1:05:48] come to nothing and you know I've got
[1:05:50] family that's in the charismatic
[1:05:51] churches and been raising them and you
[1:05:52] know what happens is they all just end
[1:05:54] up going off and filtering into nothing
[1:05:55] going from fanaticism to fanaticism
[1:05:57] going from movement to movement why
[1:06:00] because they don't have the holy spirit
[1:06:01] inside of them adopted children of God
[1:06:04] we've got to have the Holy Ghost it's
[1:06:05] impossible to be in the body of Christ
[1:06:07] without it we've read before by one
[1:06:09] Spirit you're baptized into that body
[1:06:12] but the Holy Ghost is what places people
[1:06:14] in their proper place it's what puts the
[1:06:16] gifts in their proper place cuz you can
[1:06:19] have a gift without the Holy Ghost but
[1:06:20] you put that gift in its proper place
[1:06:22] and it's done by the Holy Ghost now
[1:06:24] you're going to have some real effect in
[1:06:25] amen and outside of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:27] outside of the body of Christ we're just
[1:06:28] playing around that's the way it works
[1:06:31] brother Bram I've read this quote before
[1:06:33] he says now I'm telling you all see he
[1:06:35] says now a few years ago you were
[1:06:37] children with these gifts playing back
[1:06:39] and forth but you've been to a long
[1:06:41] school now it's time to be men not use
[1:06:44] these just to play with these gifts
[1:06:46] they're sacred they're of God and you
[1:06:48] don't play with them he says let's let
[1:06:51] God use them that's what your ministry
[1:06:53] wants to be see now I want you to see
[1:06:56] here he says you can play with them and
[1:06:59] God can use them so you can have a gift
[1:07:02] of God in your life you can have a
[1:07:03] calling you can have a purpose and you
[1:07:05] can take that and run with it in your
[1:07:07] own flesh in your own will in your own
[1:07:10] desire and you can do something with it
[1:07:12] but he says no no no we've got to the
[1:07:14] place get to the place where God's the
[1:07:15] one that's using it that's our ministry
[1:07:18] is to what let go and let God have his
[1:07:20] way let God be the one that's working in
[1:07:22] our
[1:07:23] lives brother would say this now he he's
[1:07:26] talking about after you've been born
[1:07:27] again by the Holy Spirit he says then
[1:07:29] you've got the right thing the holy
[1:07:31] spirit is the right thing for us he says
[1:07:33] then you can use anything he wants to
[1:07:35] use you in sorry then he can use you to
[1:07:38] anything he wants to use you in cuz
[1:07:40] you're in the body and subject to any
[1:07:42] one of those gifts so God can use you at
[1:07:45] any time all gifts are not permanent
[1:07:47] they can drop down the spirit can move
[1:07:49] it can drop down somebody can stand up
[1:07:51] they can speak in tongues somebody can
[1:07:53] interpret they can give a word of
[1:07:54] knowledge they can give a word of
[1:07:55] prophecy they can they can worship they
[1:07:57] can dance in the spirit they can do all
[1:07:59] of these things it and it can be just a
[1:08:01] momentary thing why because you're in
[1:08:04] the body of Christ and you're subject to
[1:08:05] being used by the Holy Spirit but then
[1:08:08] he says but see to have one of these
[1:08:10] gifts outside of the body it would do
[1:08:12] you no good why because the gifts are
[1:08:14] there to edify the body if there's no
[1:08:16] body there then how do you edify you
[1:08:18] can't he says You' got to be inside of
[1:08:20] it and then he say he reads the
[1:08:22] scripture that we just read in 1
[1:08:24] Corinthians 13 then he says see don't
[1:08:27] depend on those things the holy spirit
[1:08:29] is a being it's God God in you the
[1:08:33] person God that's lit your whole entire
[1:08:36] being now we're seeing what the gift
[1:08:39] really is he says you're changed you're
[1:08:41] a new creature and any little thing
[1:08:43] that's wrong he'll tell you that's wrong
[1:08:45] then quit don't do it say father I
[1:08:48] didn't mean to do that you forgive me he
[1:08:50] see that's the Holy Spirit see we get
[1:08:52] into this idea that gifts are things
[1:08:56] that it's something that God drops down
[1:08:58] into your life drops down a gift a
[1:09:00] special skill or approach or a way of
[1:09:02] doing things and we have it and that's
[1:09:04] the gift and that's true but that's not
[1:09:06] the true
[1:09:07] gift and we'll see this if we go to the
[1:09:10] scriptures Paul says this in Romans 11
[1:09:12] and he's speaking of Israel and he says
[1:09:14] as concerning the gospel Israel they are
[1:09:17] enemies for your sakes they were they
[1:09:19] were opposed to the early Christian
[1:09:20] Church they persecuted him then he says
[1:09:23] but as touching the election are beloved
[1:09:26] for the father's sake he says Israel is
[1:09:28] still God's chosen people though they
[1:09:29] are enemies to the truth now they're
[1:09:31] still God's chosen people and then he
[1:09:34] says these words he says for the gifts
[1:09:36] and calling of God are without
[1:09:39] repentance so in other words the gifts
[1:09:41] and the calling of God are
[1:09:43] irrevocable we can't put them away and
[1:09:45] we can't put them on and God can't say I
[1:09:48] don't want to use them anymore or I'm
[1:09:50] not going to give them that anymore or
[1:09:52] they're not my beloved or they're not my
[1:09:54] people when God declares it that's it
[1:09:58] and so God chose Israel first and she's
[1:10:00] his first love and he's blessed her and
[1:10:03] he's put a blessing on her and he's put
[1:10:05] a promise over her and all of these
[1:10:07] things yet Israel disappointed him time
[1:10:09] and time again but she never lost her
[1:10:11] position as his first love
[1:10:14] amen and he's saying gifts are the same
[1:10:17] thing God gives them to you God gives
[1:10:20] liberally and they're real gifts but the
[1:10:23] vessels aren't always Godly and you can
[1:10:27] see this with somebody like balum balam
[1:10:29] was a true anointed Prophet no doubt
[1:10:33] about it but yet in the end he turns
[1:10:35] against the will of God and against the
[1:10:37] people of God and for that he gets
[1:10:39] killed he dies and in the end they call
[1:10:41] him a soothsayer because he sold his
[1:10:43] gift for profit for money amen real
[1:10:46] gifts false vessels and people use these
[1:10:48] for their own sakes and and Paul would
[1:10:51] talk about people like this in second
[1:10:52] Timothy and he says what they lead
[1:10:54] captive silly women silly
[1:10:57] churches silly church goers with sins
[1:11:01] laid in way with divers lust that's what
[1:11:03] balum did that's literally balam's
[1:11:05] Ministry is to lead people into lust the
[1:11:08] things that they want to hear but then
[1:11:10] what's a true gift because the gift is
[1:11:13] not that that that you're you're called
[1:11:15] to preach or the gift is not that you
[1:11:17] can speak in tongues or interpret the
[1:11:19] true gift is the holy spirit working in
[1:11:21] you perfectly remember Paul says I
[1:11:23] showed you a more excellent way I'm
[1:11:25] showing you the way it's supposed to be
[1:11:27] that's what Paul's driving at the
[1:11:29] biggest gift that we can get is the holy
[1:11:31] spirit in US leading us and guiding us
[1:11:33] and using us that's what brother M says
[1:11:35] we're now subject to the gifts because
[1:11:38] of the Holy Spirit we're subject to the
[1:11:40] Holy Spirit to use the gifts amen so
[1:11:42] then it's not so much the gifts that are
[1:11:43] being operated it's what people that are
[1:11:46] being operated by the Holy
[1:11:48] Spirit right we are the gifts we are the
[1:11:51] gifts we have something to offer but
[1:11:53] we've got to surrender that so so that
[1:11:55] he can use it that's what makes it
[1:11:57] perfect that's what makes it work Paul
[1:11:59] would talk about this in Ephesians 4 and
[1:12:01] I know I'm teaching tonight but just
[1:12:02] stay with me he says wherefore he saith
[1:12:05] when he ascended up on high he led
[1:12:07] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:12:10] men so what are those gifts what are the
[1:12:13] gifts that Christ gave when he went up
[1:12:15] and and on his first Ascension it says
[1:12:18] in verse 11 and he gave some or he gave
[1:12:21] to some to who he gave to some men
[1:12:26] Apostles so he didn't give the gift of
[1:12:29] apostleship to Men He gave Gifts of
[1:12:32] Apostles to other men what you have here
[1:12:35] then he says he gave and to some he gave
[1:12:37] prophets and to some he gave evangelists
[1:12:39] and some pastors and teachers so what
[1:12:41] you see here today is a gift I am a gift
[1:12:44] to you what a wonderful thing for me to
[1:12:47] preach about this evening I am your gift
[1:12:49] but that's literally what he's saying
[1:12:51] here is that the men are the gifts men
[1:12:54] that are filled with the spirit are the
[1:12:57] gifts not just the gifts of preaching I
[1:12:59] can say well I have a gift of preaching
[1:13:01] I pray I I trust that I do but the real
[1:13:04] gift is when that man is being used by
[1:13:06] the Holy Spirit to preach to the body of
[1:13:08] Believers amen the true gift is not the
[1:13:11] calling the true gift of the holy spirit
[1:13:13] inside me making it work according to
[1:13:15] the way that God intended in the first
[1:13:17] place amen a real gift is men and women
[1:13:20] filled with the spirit that the Holy
[1:13:23] Spirit operates in within their role
[1:13:26] so that's why this is called the
[1:13:29] foolishness of preaching because people
[1:13:31] will say it's a gift of preaching and
[1:13:33] what they miss is it's the Holy Spirit
[1:13:36] speaking they miss that the true gift is
[1:13:39] the holy spirit that's in operation here
[1:13:41] this ain't me it's the Holy Spirit
[1:13:42] working and they miss these things right
[1:13:45] the gift of God to a person is that God
[1:13:47] would use them that's the real gift not
[1:13:50] that they would use themselves in any
[1:13:52] gift or or format that they choose the
[1:13:54] Difference Maker is God it's the holy
[1:13:55] spirit it's his life inside of us
[1:13:57] leading and guiding us amen the gifts
[1:13:59] fail why cuz we use
[1:14:02] them that's the failure I'm the weakest
[1:14:05] link in this whole chain is me Jonathan
[1:14:07] klette the flesh man is the weakest link
[1:14:10] in this preaching chain and when I try
[1:14:12] and use it rather than God use it that's
[1:14:14] when we're going to get into problems
[1:14:16] but when I can step out of the way
[1:14:17] remember brother Ram says my gift is to
[1:14:19] what get myself out of the way so that
[1:14:22] he can use me that's what we're talking
[1:14:24] about
[1:14:25] brother Brown puts it this way he says
[1:14:26] but you see Pentecostal people you're
[1:14:29] going after gifts instead of the givers
[1:14:31] see come back to God get this real
[1:14:34] Divine love in your heart your
[1:14:36] fellowship that all you just love him
[1:14:38] with all your heart brother then the
[1:14:40] gifts will take care of itself you just
[1:14:43] let that alone see It'll come God will
[1:14:46] place in the church the place that he
[1:14:47] sees you after he's adopted you into his
[1:14:50] family he'll call you out someday in a
[1:14:53] little prayer meeting the first thing
[1:14:54] you you know and plac the robe upon you
[1:14:56] and say now son I've sent you to preach
[1:14:58] the gospel why because he gave them
[1:15:00] first apostles and Prophets and what
[1:15:04] this brother B saying these are the
[1:15:05] first gifts that go out he says then the
[1:15:08] whole world will know about it that's
[1:15:10] right he'll call you out and say son
[1:15:11] I've sent you to pray for the sick
[1:15:13] people or Roberts was all about praying
[1:15:16] for the sick that was his ministry was
[1:15:19] to pray for the sick he says just watch
[1:15:21] the things fly then when he adopts you
[1:15:23] into his family but you can't push that
[1:15:26] you can't mentally work that up God
[1:15:29] vindicates his gifts God proves his
[1:15:31] gifts he says but what is the gift
[1:15:33] without the giver he says that's what's
[1:15:35] the matter today doesn't that just make
[1:15:38] it so simple he says we you know we want
[1:15:40] the power we want the manifestation we
[1:15:42] want the gifts we want the Greater Works
[1:15:44] and all these things and he says seek
[1:15:46] after God get close to God get close in
[1:15:49] your relationship with him and all these
[1:15:51] things will be added to you you want
[1:15:53] more in your life of God
[1:15:55] get more of God die out more surrender
[1:15:58] more feed on more that's how we get into
[1:16:01] these things amen get filled with the
[1:16:03] spirit every day seek after him and
[1:16:06] watch what he does inside of our Lives
[1:16:08] people are looking for for this huge
[1:16:11] manifestation they're looking for signs
[1:16:13] and wonders and brother BR saying just
[1:16:14] get him get him and get him and get him
[1:16:17] and that'll take care of everything
[1:16:19] you're looking for and whatever he has
[1:16:21] for you he'll give it then cuz he sees
[1:16:24] where your heart is brother Ram says
[1:16:26] this about himself he says I
[1:16:29] had to get the Holy Ghost before this
[1:16:32] gift was manifested that's right brother
[1:16:35] randam had a gift all his life remember
[1:16:37] as a young man he talked about that
[1:16:39] Vision or that that he saw of those men
[1:16:41] falling off of the the
[1:16:43] bridge all his life even as a young man
[1:16:45] as a young boy he had these gifts and
[1:16:48] but there wasn't a placing of that gift
[1:16:50] into its proper place until he got the
[1:16:53] Holy Ghost
[1:16:55] and then he gets the Holy Ghost and he
[1:16:57] steps into his preaching Ministry and
[1:16:59] then the light comes down on the Ohio
[1:17:00] River and it says as John the Baptist
[1:17:02] foran the first coming so your message
[1:17:04] will run the second I send you with a
[1:17:06] gift of Divine Healing and then he goes
[1:17:08] out and he starts to use that gift but
[1:17:10] you'll notice that it's not positionally
[1:17:12] placed
[1:17:14] immediately brother bam was not adopted
[1:17:17] as soon as he got the Holy Ghost because
[1:17:20] you see the gift is not in perfect
[1:17:22] operation because what happens is he
[1:17:24] goes out and he realizes that he has a
[1:17:27] gift of Divine Healing and he goes out
[1:17:29] and he starts to have healing campaigns
[1:17:32] but he starts to now inject himself into
[1:17:35] the process and what does he do he
[1:17:37] starts to say bring your worst one bring
[1:17:39] the sickest person you can find bring
[1:17:42] the one that's the worst case you can
[1:17:43] find and bring him up here and God will
[1:17:45] heal him and what did the angel say to
[1:17:47] him don't do that he says you're
[1:17:50] catering to the people you're not doing
[1:17:53] it the way that I want you to do it and
[1:17:55] brother bandam has this one and I think
[1:17:57] he was up there for almost two hours
[1:17:59] praying for for for a person that was
[1:18:01] very sick might have been blind I don't
[1:18:03] remember exactly and he's praying and it
[1:18:06] comes to his mind what the angel said
[1:18:08] and he says is God even going to heal
[1:18:09] this person and in the end God did but
[1:18:12] brother brandom had to back away from
[1:18:13] that because he was using the
[1:18:16] gift instead of what the Holy Spirit
[1:18:18] leading
[1:18:20] him the gift was there but he was using
[1:18:23] it and God honored that gift God honored
[1:18:25] that man God honored that office but God
[1:18:28] still rebuked him for it and in the end
[1:18:30] God pulled away and said don't you do it
[1:18:32] stop doing it I told you not to do it
[1:18:34] and brother Bram had to get disciplined
[1:18:36] for it amen it says in Show and Tell and
[1:18:40] that's what brother BR was doing was he
[1:18:41] was turning it into a showand tell
[1:18:44] whatever Satan can do God Can Do Better
[1:18:47] God's not here to play games he's not
[1:18:49] here to show off he's got a purpose and
[1:18:50] it's to draw people to
[1:18:53] him brother br says it this
[1:18:56] way he says and when Christ the Holy
[1:18:59] Spirit comes into your heart he's in you
[1:19:02] with your
[1:19:04] temperament that's part of the earth and
[1:19:06] vessels we've been talking about my
[1:19:08] temperament is not the same as yours and
[1:19:12] you know what my temperament is good for
[1:19:13] some things and my temperament is really
[1:19:15] not good for other things and some of
[1:19:17] you have me beat six ways past Sunday in
[1:19:20] certain areas with your temperament
[1:19:21] you're way better at at approaching
[1:19:23] people in certain situations ations than
[1:19:25] I am but this isn't an excuse for us to
[1:19:27] stay in our stinginess or our rudess or
[1:19:29] our aloofness or our isolation or
[1:19:32] whatever it is silliness whatever it
[1:19:35] might be no no no but he's saying God
[1:19:37] will work with you God will shape you
[1:19:40] God will mature us God will trim us to
[1:19:42] where we need to be but he says he works
[1:19:44] with you with your temperament but he is
[1:19:46] living his own life to his own will
[1:19:49] through
[1:19:50] you he says hallelujah you're so yielded
[1:19:53] you are that Christ speaks the kinds of
[1:19:56] words he would speak he thinks the kind
[1:19:59] of thoughts he would think through you
[1:20:01] he does the kind of works he would do
[1:20:03] through you he says you are yielded and
[1:20:07] resting we're talking about adoption
[1:20:09] he's saying who's doing the
[1:20:11] work you're yielded and resting what a
[1:20:15] beautiful picture he says of the
[1:20:16] Christian consecrated Christian yielded
[1:20:19] it's Christ that's working through what
[1:20:21] relax let go he's got this this is his
[1:20:25] work brother Brown say so many times if
[1:20:27] I could heal you I would if I could do
[1:20:30] this for you I would if I could do that
[1:20:31] for you I would but it's him and him
[1:20:33] alone and in most cases he's already
[1:20:35] done it and all I'm trying to do is get
[1:20:36] you to have faith to believe it to
[1:20:38] accept it for
[1:20:40] yourself the gifts are not being given
[1:20:43] to convince
[1:20:44] people you won't find in in scripture
[1:20:48] where where gifts are converting people
[1:20:51] but when the word comes that's what
[1:20:52] changes Hearts remember the scripture
[1:20:54] says it's what that Faith cometh by
[1:20:56] hearing and hearing by the word that's
[1:20:59] how these things happen and and Peter
[1:21:01] comes down on the day of Pentecost and
[1:21:02] everybody's hearing them speak in their
[1:21:04] own tongue completely Supernatural but
[1:21:07] that did not convert them and in fact
[1:21:09] they misinterpreted and said you guys
[1:21:11] are
[1:21:12] drunk so even though they they had the
[1:21:14] signs and wonders there Jesus said
[1:21:16] though one raised from the dead they
[1:21:17] won't believe it Jesus did every work in
[1:21:20] front of them and it didn't save a soul
[1:21:22] but what did it do it caught the
[1:21:24] attention of the True Believer so that
[1:21:26] when the word came forth they would
[1:21:28] believe it and that's what we see
[1:21:29] because we look at at Peter and he did
[1:21:31] not say thou Hast The Works of eternal
[1:21:34] life he says Thou H has the words of
[1:21:36] eternal life that's why we believe you
[1:21:38] that's what we hold on to is because
[1:21:39] your words they spirit and Truth they've
[1:21:41] got power behind them it's not the the
[1:21:44] evidence of the the signs and wonders
[1:21:46] that held them it was the word that
[1:21:47] matched up with the word that held them
[1:21:50] signs and wonders will never change a
[1:21:52] person's nature they won't do it people
[1:21:55] will see a genuine miracle and they'll
[1:21:57] convince themselves out of it a week
[1:21:58] later I didn't see it it was a trick it
[1:22:01] didn't happen da da d d that and and
[1:22:03] next thing you know they're right back
[1:22:04] where they were why it doesn't change
[1:22:06] people it just draws attention to God
[1:22:09] it's a sign that's all it's a sign
[1:22:12] pointing to the real work that God's
[1:22:13] trying to do look at Israel Israel was
[1:22:15] in the desert they were delivered under
[1:22:17] the supernatural power of God and spent
[1:22:19] 40 years in the desert being
[1:22:21] supernaturally fed and clothed and
[1:22:24] sheltered and all these things the
[1:22:27] literal presence of God above them every
[1:22:29] single day and all but two died in the
[1:22:32] wilderness living under a Ministry of
[1:22:34] signs and wonders the signs and wonders
[1:22:36] don't hold
[1:22:37] us that's why Paul said covet to seek
[1:22:40] the best gifts and he said what's the
[1:22:41] best gift pure leadership by the Holy
[1:22:43] Spirit perfect leadership by the Holy
[1:22:45] Spirit Holy Spirit leadership is the
[1:22:48] greatest gift God can give a Believer
[1:22:50] because when you're under his leadership
[1:22:52] it doesn't matter where you are what
[1:22:53] you're doing or you're facing you can
[1:22:55] have confidence that he put me here and
[1:22:57] I can walk through that's our resting
[1:22:59] places that he calls us he places us he
[1:23:02] pushes us into these things and he backs
[1:23:03] us up every time because we're in his
[1:23:05] will we're in his way we're in his
[1:23:06] purpose we'll get to leadership in
[1:23:08] another service Lord willing brother
[1:23:10] Braham says this we're talking about
[1:23:12] gifts we're talking about
[1:23:14] placing somebody asked me some time ago
[1:23:16] shall we seek our gifts now for our
[1:23:18] Ministries it was some meth Methodist
[1:23:20] Brethren who had just received the Holy
[1:23:22] Ghost I said no don't you do that when
[1:23:25] you do then God can't use you I said the
[1:23:27] only thing to do is just go ahead being
[1:23:30] a Christian if God has called you he'll
[1:23:33] place you just exactly where you
[1:23:37] belong usually those who seek and try to
[1:23:40] get things if God would give them
[1:23:42] something they'd more or less be a
[1:23:45] stuffed shirt why because we seek things
[1:23:47] that we
[1:23:49] want it can be because you get money
[1:23:53] because you get influence
[1:23:55] you get
[1:23:56] Fame
[1:23:58] impact whatever it is see we tend to
[1:24:01] seek things that are best for us that's
[1:24:03] human nature and that's something we've
[1:24:06] always got to keep underneath but he
[1:24:07] says no you just live a Christian Life
[1:24:09] and then whatever God gives you you stay
[1:24:10] right with
[1:24:11] that he says if you look you know you
[1:24:14] look at Moses and Paul Moses was
[1:24:16] passionate about his
[1:24:19] position he was passionate about being a
[1:24:22] deliverer so much so that he an
[1:24:26] Egyptian but where did it get
[1:24:29] him what he overstepped God's timeline
[1:24:32] and it got him nowhere he sought to
[1:24:35] become a deliverer in his own in his own
[1:24:38] way of doing things and it didn't get
[1:24:39] him anywhere look at Paul Saul at the
[1:24:42] time he he's a passionate professing
[1:24:45] believer and in that passion he is
[1:24:48] persecuting the very Christ the very god
[1:24:50] of the Bible that he
[1:24:52] believed all relig Zeal all with good
[1:24:56] intentions going after people he thought
[1:24:59] were Heretics killing them putting them
[1:25:01] in jail beating them whipping them both
[1:25:04] of these men seeking after something
[1:25:06] they thought they'd been ordained to do
[1:25:08] made a mess of
[1:25:10] everything and what happens in the end
[1:25:12] once God gets through with them now they
[1:25:13] learn to sit back and wait and Moses
[1:25:16] spends 40 years on the backside of the
[1:25:18] desert getting every bit of skill and
[1:25:19] knowledge and training beaten out of him
[1:25:22] and becoming a humble Shepherd and then
[1:25:24] God takes him a and God just has one
[1:25:27] little five minute conversation with him
[1:25:28] from a burning bush and he turns him
[1:25:30] into a
[1:25:31] deliverer with a staff in his hand and
[1:25:34] that's
[1:25:36] it see if we try and push into it that's
[1:25:39] when we get into
[1:25:41] problems Moses murderer laughing stock
[1:25:45] just a Shepherd that's what he had to
[1:25:47] become before God could use
[1:25:49] him Paul you know so many times what
[1:25:53] holds us back is
[1:25:54] our early
[1:25:58] failures in our
[1:26:00] Zeal in our youthful enthusiasm as
[1:26:03] Believers I'm seeing some nodding heads
[1:26:05] here obviously I've struck a cord what
[1:26:08] do you do what what do we do not what do
[1:26:10] you do what do we do what we
[1:26:14] presume and we get ahead of
[1:26:17] god good
[1:26:20] intentions just trying to do something
[1:26:22] for the body of Christ many times and
[1:26:24] what do we do we make a mess and you
[1:26:27] know what Satan does is he tries to use
[1:26:29] that mess to tell us we can't ever try
[1:26:31] that
[1:26:31] again but that's not the way God works
[1:26:34] see that's part of these Earth and
[1:26:36] vessels so that the Excellency is of God
[1:26:38] and not of us and so often what happens
[1:26:41] is we mess up and then we think well I
[1:26:42] can't ever do that again God will never
[1:26:44] use me that way I'm not even going to
[1:26:45] try about it and all God wants us to do
[1:26:47] is just sit back and wait for him and
[1:26:50] when we get to a place of maturity we
[1:26:53] get to a place where we can truly seek
[1:26:54] his will we can wait on him all of a
[1:26:56] sudden God steps in and we are doing
[1:26:57] exactly what we wanted to do all along
[1:26:59] or we felt to do all along but this time
[1:27:02] it's him instead of me this time it's
[1:27:03] him instead of you but Paul had to get
[1:27:06] over that Paul had to get over his
[1:27:08] conscience can you imagine I I don't
[1:27:09] know how Paul did it frankly he went for
[1:27:11] years just persecuting and killing
[1:27:13] people and putting them in jail and only
[1:27:15] to realize that it was the very thing
[1:27:17] that he should have been believing all
[1:27:19] along but yet he did it that's the power
[1:27:23] of God in a believer's life amen don't
[1:27:25] worry about your
[1:27:26] failures that's the thing that tends to
[1:27:28] hold me back I like Perfection and you
[1:27:31] know what I'll never be
[1:27:33] perfect younger Pastor dealing with
[1:27:37] people lots of uncomfortable
[1:27:40] situations I want everything to go
[1:27:43] perfectly but guess what there's no
[1:27:46] perfection in this
[1:27:48] body my perfection is in Christ so I'm
[1:27:51] going to fail I'm going to mess up
[1:27:54] but that just proves God's graciousness
[1:27:57] it proves how great he is cu by the time
[1:27:59] I'm done getting myself out of the way
[1:28:01] and all my mistakes then people know
[1:28:03] it's only God that can do these things
[1:28:04] anyways because obviously brother John
[1:28:06] can't do it because he's tried and
[1:28:07] failed too many times it takes God to do
[1:28:11] this brother says here but here we find
[1:28:13] that God in spite of all the failures
[1:28:15] Moses had done he still had his hand on
[1:28:19] him he said and he called him to go to
[1:28:21] do a service called him to his
[1:28:23] commission what a a consolation that
[1:28:25] must have been to Joshua when he heard
[1:28:27] God say as I was with Moses so will I be
[1:28:30] with you he says although if I'm trying
[1:28:32] and I fail God won't leave me I never
[1:28:35] have much confidence in anybody that's
[1:28:37] too afraid to do anything I'd rather be
[1:28:40] found a failure than too lazy to
[1:28:43] try those of us that tend to lean
[1:28:45] towards Perfection can lead to
[1:28:47] inactivity because if we can't be
[1:28:48] perfect we won't do it in the first
[1:28:50] place that's not God's way God says let
[1:28:54] me be the perfect one you be the willing
[1:28:56] and yielded
[1:28:58] one he says God don't hold you
[1:29:00] responsible for your
[1:29:02] mistakes praise the
[1:29:04] Lord all our good intentions all our
[1:29:07] flaws whatever it might be God doesn't
[1:29:09] hold us responsible for that he says he
[1:29:11] holds you responsible for your willful
[1:29:13] sin he that sins willfully after he's
[1:29:15] received the knowledge of Truth he says
[1:29:17] there's no more there's no more covering
[1:29:18] of the the sins by the blood he says but
[1:29:20] a man that's going to do something hear
[1:29:22] this now we're talking about adoption
[1:29:25] adoption means you're going to be put
[1:29:26] into action he says any man that's going
[1:29:29] to do something is going to blunder he's
[1:29:31] going to fall he's going to make
[1:29:35] mistakes it's a real encouraging service
[1:29:38] tonight you will fall I will fall I have
[1:29:43] fallen amen he says but if he's really
[1:29:47] divinely called and God is in his heart
[1:29:50] he'll rise
[1:29:51] again that's what I can I I can live
[1:29:54] that I can say Lord just Lift Me Up give
[1:29:57] me another shot help me to learn from my
[1:29:59] mistakes so that you can have a perfect
[1:30:01] work in my life amen CU so often what
[1:30:03] happens is I you you yeah I I I slip I
[1:30:07] fall things don't go the way I think
[1:30:09] they should have my response isn't as as
[1:30:11] as as good as it could have been you sit
[1:30:13] back and and I say I thought I was
[1:30:15] better than that I thought I was more
[1:30:16] mature than that I thought I have more
[1:30:18] of this or more of
[1:30:20] that so
[1:30:22] what it's God
[1:30:24] working in me that's all that matters
[1:30:27] he'll pick me up he'll hold me up he'll
[1:30:30] raise me up we look through scriptures
[1:30:32] how many flawed people did God work with
[1:30:34] every one of them every single one that
[1:30:37] God worked with the Great Men the great
[1:30:39] women of scripture all had their flaws
[1:30:41] and failures and moments of humanity and
[1:30:43] carnality and falling away in from Faith
[1:30:46] even we make mistakes that's the
[1:30:49] humanity of
[1:30:52] us but when I look through the word and
[1:30:54] I see the wonderful things God used
[1:30:56] through people that were as flawed as I
[1:30:57] am I say praise the Lord he can still
[1:30:59] use me then and he can still use you why
[1:31:02] the Perfection is not through us it's
[1:31:04] through the blood of Jesus
[1:31:06] Christ but the prophet is been telling
[1:31:08] us he's saying seek after God focus on
[1:31:10] him the rest will follow don't try to be
[1:31:12] something special that's the worst thing
[1:31:15] we can do is try and be something
[1:31:16] special we're special because he chose
[1:31:18] us in and of itself that makes us
[1:31:21] special makes us elect amen but he's
[1:31:23] saying don't try and claim anything
[1:31:24] special just be humble just be simple
[1:31:28] you be you and let God be God and
[1:31:30] that'll work really really well if we
[1:31:31] can do that brother M says this he says
[1:31:34] that's the way it is with the Holy
[1:31:35] Spirit he says we don't have to be
[1:31:38] peculiar to be different or be anything
[1:31:40] more just let loose and live a Godly
[1:31:43] life and just let God live through you
[1:31:45] this is that rest we're talking about
[1:31:47] just sitting back and saying Lord just
[1:31:48] live through me he says that'll glow for
[1:31:51] the gospel see not glitter glitter that
[1:31:54] just makes monkeys jump at things like
[1:31:56] that anything that Glitters he says you
[1:31:58] know they're always jumping for
[1:31:59] something that's shiny but he says that
[1:32:01] but glow is the soft mellow sweetness of
[1:32:05] the Holy Spirit but notice here he
[1:32:07] starts out he says you don't have to be
[1:32:09] peculiar be different or be anything
[1:32:12] more Church we're pilgrims and strangers
[1:32:15] here just looking at our lives people
[1:32:17] are going to see we're different we
[1:32:18] don't have to make ourselves different
[1:32:21] either we're different or we're not but
[1:32:23] we don't have to try and force a
[1:32:25] difference Our Lives alone will cause
[1:32:27] separation it'll cause people to see
[1:32:30] that we're different amen we're not of
[1:32:31] this world if we've got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:33] we are not of this world and we don't
[1:32:35] fit in and eventually people realize
[1:32:38] it it's amazing how I'm seeing things
[1:32:42] happen with people I work with and
[1:32:44] people that I I I spend time with
[1:32:45] outside of this and and they just keep
[1:32:48] coming back with more questions and and
[1:32:50] you just sit there and you say Lord help
[1:32:53] me to be a test testimony and everything
[1:32:54] that they're asking because they don't
[1:32:56] understand and they're trying to
[1:32:58] understand and many of them I just had
[1:33:01] one with a colleague this week and just
[1:33:02] out of the blue he emailed me and I was
[1:33:04] able to give him my full testimony of
[1:33:06] why I'm here and why I moved back to New
[1:33:08] Finland and these things but he
[1:33:10] confessed that he's feeling he's got
[1:33:12] issues with where he's at in
[1:33:14] life and unsure of if what he's doing is
[1:33:17] going to have an impact and and these
[1:33:19] different things and what's he seeing
[1:33:20] he's seeing somebody that believes
[1:33:22] they're having an impact and so he's
[1:33:24] saying what's going on in your life but
[1:33:26] he comes at it this way and he comes at
[1:33:27] it that way cuz he's trying to see what
[1:33:29] makes me different I didn't have to go
[1:33:32] tell them I'm Different just living the
[1:33:34] life of Christ makes us different and
[1:33:36] it'll draw people to us it's that glow
[1:33:38] where a city on a hill that can't be hid
[1:33:41] don't try and force it we don't try and
[1:33:42] force doctrinal differences when I'm
[1:33:44] talking to a Pentecostal or a Baptist I
[1:33:46] don't go right to the heart of the
[1:33:48] matter and try and tear down speaking of
[1:33:50] tongues as an Evidence or do you have
[1:33:52] the Holy Ghost to a Baptist or
[1:33:54] no I try and let them see the Life of
[1:33:56] Christ in Me Above All Else and to be
[1:33:59] meek and gentle and salty and hope that
[1:34:03] that gives them enough time to sit back
[1:34:06] and actually consider what I might say
[1:34:08] rather than just dismiss it because I'm
[1:34:10] trying to force myself to be different
[1:34:12] we don't need to do those
[1:34:14] things amen words are
[1:34:17] cheap and so often what we do is we can
[1:34:20] speak in a way that causes division
[1:34:22] where it's unnecessary
[1:34:24] let them pull away let them Force the
[1:34:27] division but if you can get along with
[1:34:29] somebody stay with them as long as you
[1:34:31] can just per chance God might give them
[1:34:34] a revelation of this end time message of
[1:34:36] what's going on of the truth that's been
[1:34:38] revealed in this age amen but words are
[1:34:41] cheap and lots of people are out there
[1:34:42] talking but it's a life lived before
[1:34:44] them that really gets people's attention
[1:34:46] we want to be those living Epistles we
[1:34:48] read about earlier
[1:34:50] Amen brother B says this he says we're
[1:34:52] adopted by the father into the
[1:34:54] fellowship and into the body of
[1:34:56] Believers by the Holy Ghost and a
[1:34:58] Vindicated Ministry proving he says you
[1:35:00] don't have to talk so much about it God
[1:35:02] does his own talking God testifies of
[1:35:05] his gifts but all those gifts are
[1:35:07] wonderful they're Dandy and we love them
[1:35:09] all God grant that every one of us would
[1:35:11] have every gift but I'd rather have the
[1:35:13] giver than all the gifts Paul said
[1:35:15] though I could have the gifts without
[1:35:17] the
[1:35:18] giver without charity without the love
[1:35:20] of God without the Holy Spirit those
[1:35:22] gifts are nothing he said says now if we
[1:35:24] had went to seeking the giver instead of
[1:35:26] the gifts I believe the church would
[1:35:28] have been further up the road don't you
[1:35:30] think so if we stayed close to God and
[1:35:33] loved him and just kept living for him
[1:35:35] and not trying to push things
[1:35:39] over we we look and we see where we're
[1:35:41] at in this time we we have an end time
[1:35:43] message that tells us what's happening
[1:35:45] and what's supposed to happen and I feel
[1:35:48] sometimes we're trying to push it to
[1:35:49] make it
[1:35:51] happen rather than saying L saying Lord
[1:35:54] just help me catch it as it happens I
[1:35:56] don't want to catch it after it's
[1:35:58] happened I want to catch it while it's
[1:36:00] happening because it's a part of me it's
[1:36:02] a part of you it's a part of this local
[1:36:03] body of Believers amen don't try and
[1:36:05] push it he says just live for God live a
[1:36:08] pure holy life and live and pray every
[1:36:12] day and keep yourself refreshed in his
[1:36:15] presence and God will take care of the
[1:36:17] rest of it I've said this before about
[1:36:19] myself I'll say it again when I start to
[1:36:22] get impatient when I start to look at
[1:36:24] people around me when I start to get
[1:36:26] critical it's because I haven't been in
[1:36:28] his
[1:36:29] presence amen the scripture would talk
[1:36:31] about brother Brandon would talk about
[1:36:32] that Dew in the morning that refreshes
[1:36:35] the plants that makes them ready to face
[1:36:37] the heat of the day whatever's going to
[1:36:39] come their their way that de in the
[1:36:41] morning refreshes them and it gives them
[1:36:43] enough to get them through the day and
[1:36:44] when I don't get that and I don't get
[1:36:46] that for maybe a couple days what
[1:36:48] happens is I get
[1:36:50] brittle and what do I do I start to push
[1:36:53] against those that I ought to love most
[1:36:55] and my wife will suffer and my kids will
[1:36:57] suffer maybe the congregation will
[1:36:58] suffer and maybe my preaching will get
[1:37:00] harder why because I'm not spending the
[1:37:03] time in his presence that I need to
[1:37:05] that's where my refreshment is it's when
[1:37:07] I force my way when I fight my way to
[1:37:09] his presence otherwise life gets busy
[1:37:11] and I can find every excuse in the world
[1:37:13] not to do
[1:37:15] it these mornings I get up and I got to
[1:37:17] go and drive to Physio and I'm there for
[1:37:19] an hour and a half and then you come
[1:37:21] back and then work's waiting for you and
[1:37:22] you're trying to get through on your
[1:37:23] devotions and you're trying to do this
[1:37:25] and you got to drive for work and
[1:37:27] meetings and study and this and it all
[1:37:28] builds up on you and what happens is we
[1:37:31] get brittle because we're not taking
[1:37:33] that time to just set it down and sit
[1:37:35] back and spend a little bit of time with
[1:37:37] him amen when we start looking at other
[1:37:41] people when I start looking at other
[1:37:42] people you know where the problem is
[1:37:44] right here amen if I start looking at
[1:37:48] other believers the beam is in my eye
[1:37:51] because the holy spirit's not running
[1:37:52] around having me to correct your life as
[1:37:56] a person over this Pulpit maybe but as
[1:37:59] as an individual to an individual it's
[1:38:01] not the holy spirit will not
[1:38:03] criticize it'll correct in love at most
[1:38:07] and what it really ought to do is take
[1:38:09] me to my knees in
[1:38:10] prayer not to criticize not to put
[1:38:12] people down not to put them out or any
[1:38:14] of these things what isn't I haven't
[1:38:15] lost my Christianity I've lost the joy
[1:38:18] I've lost the peace that's what that's
[1:38:21] what David did David needed a refreshing
[1:38:23] he said restore to me the joy of my
[1:38:25] salvation he hadn't lost that he hadn't
[1:38:27] lost salvation but he'd lost the joy of
[1:38:29] it he'd lost the refreshing of the
[1:38:31] spirit of God in his
[1:38:35] life that's what we've got to fight
[1:38:37] for fight for that everything else will
[1:38:40] take its
[1:38:42] place every day we need to be in his
[1:38:44] presence to seek after him to give him
[1:38:47] time to just shut our our minds down and
[1:38:50] and just dwell on the things of God for
[1:38:52] a little bit but as we start to close
[1:38:54] this
[1:38:56] evening I want to set us up for this
[1:38:59] next service with just a few thoughts
[1:39:01] and this is the this is the moment I've
[1:39:04] been waiting for in this entire series
[1:39:06] is what we're going to talk about now
[1:39:08] and it's about our predestinated place
[1:39:10] and what is our adopted positions if I
[1:39:12] were to walk through the church from
[1:39:14] Sister Lydia all the way back to to to
[1:39:16] little brother Levi back there and these
[1:39:18] different ones to walk through and say
[1:39:20] what is your adopted position if you
[1:39:22] were to say brother John what is my
[1:39:23] adopted position we're going to answer
[1:39:25] that question tonight and this is what
[1:39:26] I've been waiting for for all of this I
[1:39:28] think it's a beautiful thing but I'm
[1:39:30] going to start Us in Romans 12 and Paul
[1:39:32] says for as we have many members in one
[1:39:34] body and all members have not the same
[1:39:36] office so we be many are one body in
[1:39:39] Christ and everyone members one of
[1:39:40] another having then gifts differing
[1:39:43] according to the grace that's given to
[1:39:45] us whether prophecy let us prophesy
[1:39:47] according to the proportion of Faith or
[1:39:49] Ministry let us wait on our ministry or
[1:39:51] he that teacheth on teaching or he that
[1:39:53] exhorteth on exhorting he that giveth
[1:39:56] let him do it with Simplicity he that
[1:39:57] ruleth with diligence he that showeth
[1:39:59] Mercy with
[1:40:01] cheerfulness all of us have these
[1:40:03] different places and things and when you
[1:40:04] look there not all of those seem like
[1:40:06] spiritual
[1:40:07] gifts
[1:40:09] giving anybody can give right but it
[1:40:12] says with
[1:40:13] diligence Mercy
[1:40:15] givers your position in the body could
[1:40:18] be a mercy Giver you could also be a a
[1:40:21] minister a preacher of some sort but he
[1:40:23] says I'm ministering Ministry just means
[1:40:25] a place of service so he says whatever
[1:40:28] it is whatever your place of service is
[1:40:30] wait on that wait till God shows it to
[1:40:32] you and then brother Bram starts us out
[1:40:34] and we're talking about now what is our
[1:40:36] positions what is he's calling us into
[1:40:39] and he says God will place in the church
[1:40:41] the place that he sees you after he's
[1:40:43] adopted you into his family he'll call
[1:40:46] you out someday in a little prayer
[1:40:47] meeting the first thing you know place
[1:40:49] the robe upon you and say now son I've
[1:40:50] sent you to preach the gospel the whole
[1:40:52] world will know about it that's right
[1:40:54] he'll call you out and say son I've sent
[1:40:55] you to pray for the sick people we read
[1:40:57] this earlier all right now that's a
[1:40:59] great quote it matches up with what we
[1:41:00] read in Romans 12 it matches up with
[1:41:03] what we read read in Ephesians 4 about
[1:41:04] the gifts of God and that that are sent
[1:41:07] in and apostles the fivefold ministry in
[1:41:09] these different things but then Paul
[1:41:11] told us if you remember in 1 Corinthians
[1:41:12] 12 he says are all Apostles are all
[1:41:15] teachers are all workers of Miracles
[1:41:17] we're looking at adoption this
[1:41:18] positional placing and the first thing
[1:41:20] we're told about every time is the
[1:41:22] ministering of the word
[1:41:23] that always leads okay we see it on the
[1:41:26] day of Pentecost and it's always been
[1:41:27] that way but we can't always be
[1:41:29] preachers we can't all be preachers and
[1:41:31] we can't all be one type of preacher and
[1:41:32] the sisters sitting here aren't allowed
[1:41:34] to be preachers at all so it can't just
[1:41:37] be about
[1:41:38] preachers amen it can't just be about
[1:41:40] the ministers that stand behind this
[1:41:42] Pulpit but whatever our ministry is
[1:41:45] that's what it we're looking for amen
[1:41:48] remember Paul gives us a glimpse in
[1:41:49] Romans 12 he says each one of us has our
[1:41:52] ministry tree our place of service and
[1:41:55] Paul says for some of you that's giving
[1:41:57] for some of you it's governments it's
[1:41:59] management it's helping out around the
[1:42:01] church for others it's being merci
[1:42:03] merciful so it's not just preaching the
[1:42:05] word it's not just signs and
[1:42:08] wonders so we read that quote in the
[1:42:10] beginning where brother Ram says he'll
[1:42:12] call you to a place and he'll speak to
[1:42:14] you and he'll anoint you and he'll give
[1:42:16] you great gifts and powers and Paul's
[1:42:18] telling telling us what that looks like
[1:42:21] it's not all some big Fanfare it's not
[1:42:23] all some big Public public show it's not
[1:42:25] all standing behind a Pulpit amen but
[1:42:29] it's what it's a body
[1:42:31] Ministry it's each one of us presenting
[1:42:34] Christ in a particular way and it's
[1:42:36] individuals fulfilling the word of God
[1:42:38] according their individual
[1:42:40] purposes each one of us has an element
[1:42:43] of
[1:42:44] ministry are you ready for this this is
[1:42:47] it are you ready we're almost done are
[1:42:51] you ready to hear what adop positions
[1:42:53] are available in this body of Christ
[1:42:56] here we
[1:42:57] go this is
[1:43:00] wonderful the church positionally before
[1:43:04] the foundation of the world okay what
[1:43:06] he's about to talk about is what God saw
[1:43:09] in his mind before we ever came into
[1:43:11] begin okay when God in his labor pain
[1:43:15] was bringing forth bringing forth you
[1:43:18] knowing what you would do he
[1:43:20] positionally placed you into his own
[1:43:23] body to be
[1:43:30] a
[1:43:33] housewife adopted
[1:43:37] housewife but John are you serious he
[1:43:43] is an adopted
[1:43:46] housewife to be a
[1:43:48] farmer what my position the body of
[1:43:51] Christ is to be a farmer
[1:43:54] that ain't
[1:43:56] spiritual where's the
[1:43:58] gift where's the great
[1:44:01] power where's the evidence that
[1:44:04] everyone's going to
[1:44:07] see to be a preacher praise the Lord to
[1:44:11] be a
[1:44:12] prophet or to be this or to be that he
[1:44:16] placed you
[1:44:19] positionally so we look at it as this
[1:44:21] big thing that he's going to place us
[1:44:23] into something we've never been before
[1:44:26] rather than recognizing that what he has
[1:44:28] placed us into is our position in the
[1:44:29] first place if it's within his
[1:44:34] will adopted
[1:44:37] teachers adopted
[1:44:40] machinists adopted operations people
[1:44:45] adopted snow clearing
[1:44:47] people adopted hearing a
[1:44:50] practitioners even adopted engineers
[1:44:56] we're sitting here and we're waiting for
[1:44:58] this big explosion someday I'm going to
[1:45:01] be
[1:45:03] adopted and the prophet of God's
[1:45:06] saying most of you are already there and
[1:45:08] you just don't know
[1:45:11] it most of you are there and you just
[1:45:14] don't know
[1:45:18] it each one of us has access to people
[1:45:23] he says he's got no hands but yours no
[1:45:24] feet but yours no mouth but
[1:45:26] yours so when I look around this room
[1:45:29] and I see the access we have to
[1:45:32] people that's where the ministry comes
[1:45:34] in is because you've got a place that I
[1:45:36] can't get and I've got a place you can't
[1:45:39] get and you've got an approach and
[1:45:41] you've got a way that you can what deal
[1:45:44] with the people that are around you
[1:45:46] guess what brother Matt as a bluecollar
[1:45:48] worker has a way better camaraderie with
[1:45:50] those people than I ever will I get
[1:45:52] along just fine but in the end I'm an
[1:45:53] engineer I'm the one that makes things
[1:45:55] difficult
[1:45:57] right sisters get along better with
[1:46:00] women and can reach places with women
[1:46:02] that men can't or
[1:46:03] shouldn't
[1:46:05] amen then you look at Housewives you say
[1:46:08] how can that be adopted look at the
[1:46:10] access you have to young people to other
[1:46:15] mothers to other
[1:46:17] children all of these things and what is
[1:46:19] it it's Christ trying to flow throughout
[1:46:21] the whole world to reach the entire one
[1:46:23] every single one out there that needs to
[1:46:24] do it through you and through me through
[1:46:27] your little humble
[1:46:30] Life we'll get into what that looks like
[1:46:32] in the next service but I want you to to
[1:46:34] do this sisters listen up and if each
[1:46:38] one of you in here has not been
[1:46:39] positionally placed he says you might be
[1:46:42] nothing but a housewife he's not putting
[1:46:44] down a housewife he's saying you're
[1:46:45] looking at it this way it's us that puts
[1:46:49] these things
[1:46:50] down and the prophet saying you're
[1:46:52] housewife he says catch this now you
[1:46:54] well you say brother brandom I've never
[1:46:56] done a thing in my life I'm not a
[1:46:58] preacher I think if we could get this
[1:47:01] idea that it's all on the ministry out
[1:47:02] of our heads I'm not saying it's here
[1:47:04] but we tend to put it on the ministry
[1:47:05] don't
[1:47:06] we this is a body
[1:47:09] Ministry he says well maybe God brought
[1:47:12] you here to raise a family of children
[1:47:15] and out of that family of children may
[1:47:16] come another family of children that'll
[1:47:18] be a preacher that'll send a million
[1:47:20] souls to Christ he says you had to be
[1:47:23] here you had to be at your post of Duty
[1:47:26] you had to be faithful to raise them in
[1:47:28] the what nurture and admonition of the
[1:47:30] Lord he said you're here for a purpose
[1:47:34] do you know
[1:47:37] that he's trying to get us to recognize
[1:47:40] if God has placed you there's purpose
[1:47:44] and you're there because he's placed you
[1:47:46] not because you married a man and you
[1:47:49] got pregnant you're not a mother because
[1:47:52] you can't can be a mother you're mother
[1:47:54] because he ordained you to be a mother
[1:47:55] you're a wife because he ordained you to
[1:47:57] be a wife you're a machinist because he
[1:47:59] ordained you to be a machinist you're
[1:48:00] whatever it might be he's ordained you
[1:48:02] for that he's trying to get you to see
[1:48:04] if you've got the Holy Ghost and he has
[1:48:05] placed you in that
[1:48:07] position there's so much more that's
[1:48:10] going on than you
[1:48:11] realize amen let's stand together if we
[1:48:16] would even if you might not be nothing
[1:48:19] but a
[1:48:20] housewife adoption so high so lofty
[1:48:24] nothing we can attain to until the very
[1:48:26] last few days before the resurrection
[1:48:27] and Rapture that's what adoption has
[1:48:29] made out been made out to be for so long
[1:48:32] brother brah says you had to be here you
[1:48:34] had to be in that position you had to
[1:48:36] recognize that God's working through you
[1:48:38] so that he could do something special we
[1:48:41] read that quote at the beginning where
[1:48:42] brother Braham says God wants to speak
[1:48:43] to a person anoint them give them
[1:48:45] something special great powers and gifts
[1:48:47] to work his will and here he
[1:48:50] says nothing but a housewife
[1:48:53] nothing but a
[1:48:55] farmer nothing but a
[1:48:57] mother how's that look like and what's
[1:49:01] really available to us remember what we
[1:49:03] read he says we're living below our
[1:49:06] privileges remember what brother Brown
[1:49:08] said he said he says when the church
[1:49:11] realizes when the bride of Christ
[1:49:13] recognizes her position he says the
[1:49:16] Rapture will go that's what he's trying
[1:49:18] to do is help us to see this isn't some
[1:49:21] great big future event it's going on
[1:49:23] right now and you're a part of it and
[1:49:26] he's trying to get us to see it he's
[1:49:28] trying to get us to see what he's trying
[1:49:29] to do brother brandham before the
[1:49:32] seals he would preach God in
[1:49:36] Simplicity God is what hidden in
[1:49:39] Simplicity and revealed in the
[1:49:41] same and we're trying to make it into
[1:49:43] some big event and what you see time and
[1:49:46] time again in the scripture is just
[1:49:48] simple humble Victorious Believers and
[1:49:52] God steps in and uses them God steps in
[1:49:54] and uses them God steps in and uses them
[1:49:56] God steps in and uses them and all they
[1:49:58] had to do was recognize he's there and
[1:50:01] he's called me and he's made it
[1:50:03] available to me and all of a sudden
[1:50:05] things start to happen What when they
[1:50:07] recognize that he answers prayer that
[1:50:10] his promis is for them that it doesn't
[1:50:13] take somebody special it doesn't take a
[1:50:16] minister it doesn't take a man doesn't
[1:50:18] take a great gift it just takes somebody
[1:50:20] that'll take God at his word and be led
[1:50:22] by the spirit and we'll see these things
[1:50:25] start to follow in their life amen we'll
[1:50:27] get into that in the next service amen
[1:50:30] the greatest gift is a human being in
[1:50:33] the hands of God that's what adoption is
[1:50:36] you in his hands so he can use you and
[1:50:39] however that looks however that looks
[1:50:42] it's with power it's with authority you
[1:50:45] can have great expectation that God's
[1:50:47] got a purpose that God's going to use
[1:50:48] you for wonderful things in his kingdom
[1:50:51] isn't that just so beautifully simple
[1:50:54] my when I read that I
[1:50:56] thought what could hold us back if we'd
[1:50:59] only recognize right where I'm at doing
[1:51:03] what he's doing when we're matured don't
[1:51:05] get me wrong this is not something we we
[1:51:08] just step into
[1:51:09] immediately but when we've matured when
[1:51:11] we've been proven the things that God is
[1:51:14] wanting to do through us just in the
[1:51:16] humble Simplicity of everyday
[1:51:19] Believers not just ministers but in each
[1:51:22] and every one men and women boys and
[1:51:24] girls wherever they might be in the body
[1:51:27] of Christ to place them in there and
[1:51:29] start working through their lives so
[1:51:31] that people can see Christ all over
[1:51:33] again what a wonderful thing we've got
[1:51:35] amen let's bow our heads Heavenly

[1:52:38] encourage ourself in the moving of your
[1:52:39] spirit in our lives Lord to know that
