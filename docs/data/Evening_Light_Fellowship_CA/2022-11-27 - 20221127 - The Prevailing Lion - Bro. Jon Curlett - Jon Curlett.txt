there and I had I had written this down from prayer request and somehow I wanted I wanted to bring it to the end and I skipped over it and a typical fashion I forgot to go back to it but this this was from the sister uh Beverly I talked to her at length last night and she was letting me know that about her grandson Jack and they finally have if they've finally diagnosed what is wrong with him uh he's the two and two and a half year old little fellow Jack row and um we'd been praying for him and the doctors really didn't know what it was but uh and he's been improving slowly and the doctors have been really happy with him but he's kind of he's got a bit of a setback there now but what he's got is a is a very very rare disease and I read up a little bit on it last night but uh in in his case there's he's the only one in Newfoundland that has it and he's only one of less than 150 children around the world that have it and uh so it it's uh this is really this is really new and it it um it attacks basically it attacks uh it can attack the heart and it can attack the blood flow and it can it can attack a whole pile of things you can have Siege seizures and all of that so and he he can lose his Mobility that sort of thing he can't you know he can't get around at all so when he becomes developmentally delayed and uh he would have to go through some therapy uh to to re to learn what he should have learned before you know so uh it does take it does take some time and by the time he would become say nine years old it should be past the danger area that's you know which which it could be serious up to that point for short and serious anyway so she and that's really a Kohl's notes version there's a whole lot about that online but this this disease is called Tango 2 and it's genetic his parents his parents uh both had that Gene and it got passed on to him so uh you know I said all that to say that you know she is requested prayer prayer for the mother and father and prayer for that child there's that other boy Josiah Josiah right and you know he's under ventilator home little babies you know I mean the devil has no respecter of persons that's for sure and that he would attack a child like that you know but God is greater than that and God's promises are far greater than that so you know we sang We sang starting off there you know I sent my word and I healed your disease God sent to remedy right so let's trust God for Jack today and Josiah and those other children you know around the world I mean you know breaks your heart you see children suffer like that you know they they never asked to be born like that obviously right so that's the world we live in unfortunately so we just want to remember Jack and fair if you would so let's um let's just sing this and may God's presence come near to that family today just bring that healing power that touch from almighty God there's nothing like the presence there's nothing like the presence thank you there's nothing like the presence nothing like the presence amen nothing 's inside Hallelujah I'm free [Music] here in the I am forget [Music] [Music] amen [Music] presence presence nearly clearly stand together if we would well I'm free in the presence I'm here [Music] I'm not ashamed forever in his print there's freedom free distance freedom in the presence freedom freedoms of the Lord there's freedom immense [Music] in the presence freedom in the presence of the Lord [Music] well I'm free in the presence [Music] I'm here in the presence forgiving I'm not ashamed I'm changing forever in his presence will I pray presence I'm here [Music] [Music] forever Heavenly Father Lord how fitting it is to sing this song Lord as we enter into the preaching of the word this morning Lord of the freedom that's found in your presence Lord it's nothing the world can give lord it's nothing that programs can give it's nothing we can give ourselves Lord Lord we can't get ourselves out of the messes we make Lord but when we're in your presence Lord and not just in your presence Lord but when that presence is with us Lord when it lives within us when it stays within us Lord when the service is over when the saints are gone when the songs have been sung Lord yet your presence remains with us Lord and that's what keeps us free Lord that's what gives us Liberty Lord that's what takes us out of jail Lord that's what sets us on the path of righteousness and Holiness and Lord we're thankful for your presence Lord not just in this service or but in our individual and personal lives this morning Lord Lord that we've heard a message that said come out of her my people Lord and it wasn't just denominations Lord but it was a denomination of one Lord our own mind our own thoughts our own will our own desires Lord God lord we're free this morning it's a Redemptive work that you've done in our lives and we want to thank you for it Lord Jesus Lord we give you the glory Glory the honor and the praise this morning for your goodness and Grace Lord for your mercy your love your forgiveness Lord may we never forget it Lord and may Our Lives just be dedicated to you as a show of our thanks Lord Jesus Lord bless this service now bless the preaching of the word Lord bless the hearing of the word Heavenly Father Lord here and over lord the internet and Airwaves as those Lord that are outside listening we pray your mercy and Grace Lord your healing touch to the many that are sick this morning Lord God lord just be there we pray in Jesus Christ's name we're asking him amen amen amen God bless you thank you musicians and turn the scriptures to Revelation chapter 5. if you would this morning and then a couple a couple announcements and thanks uh first of all brother Dale has got his house so we want to thank the Lord for that amen that's an answer to prayer and and we thought we got our house fast but he got his even faster so amen praise the Lord Brother Dale we're very happy for that certainly wanted to thank the church and the many ones here that helped with a successful set of meetings this weekend everything from uh sister Lily and sister Delfina cleaning up after every service I noticed that to make sure the church was ready for the next next meeting brother Mark and sister Maureen hosting 51 52 people at their house that was a new record I think appreciate that all the the specials the choir that was fantastic every everyone you know it's a church effort it's uh we bring a minister in and we trust the Lord to speak but it's everybody that joins in and pulls on the word and sets an atmosphere for God to move in the hearts of his people so very thankful for that brother John and I've been going back and forth all week and if you there's one thing you probably learned this weekend it's he's a positive man amen and everything he points you to is the encouragement to the the word of God in the presence of God and the good things of God and so he's been continuing to encourage me along the way and and we want to certainly thank him and appreciate what he's doing amen you if you knew what was going on and what has gone on in his life you'd wonder how he can be so positive sometimes but yet he never you never hear a a a bad word come out you never hear a poor confession he's always just he's always pointing to the Lord and saying the Lord's got it in control and claiming the promises of the word it was a real encouragement for me you know you get down sometimes and listen that's where Satan starts to work so we want to say what the word says amen not let Satan get a word in edgewise amen we're going to open up this morning Revelation chapter 5 and verse 1. very familiar scripture we've read it a number of times in the last services but we're going to take it from a different direction this morning Revelation 5 and 1 says and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the a book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book nor to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof amen God bless you can take your seats this morning and I want to turn a corner bit in our Redemption series and this morning I want to preach on the prevailing lion and we've spoken so much in the first you know certainly the five or six Services of the nature of humanity in our fallen condition and the sin debt that was there that we couldn't pay and it was all dark and gloomy and it was you can't do it and you can't do it and you need something else and you're never going to get there on your own and these different things and it's not always uplifting to hear is it when we start talking about our failures and our faults and our inability to do things but that was we were kind of in the valley and what we were doing was we were showing where we were amen where we are amen if we don't accept what God has done for us but we're starting to come up now into the we're starting to climb up the mountain we're starting to get into the higher Heights and the goodness and we're we're getting into the place of Victory and worship and praise for what he's doing and what he's done and what he's going to be doing and so we're going to start with the prevailing lion this morning and you know we we talked last service about being debt free and and how our sins are not just covered but they're separated from us and that's why we don't have to pay a price anymore it's not just because they're they're paid for but they've been separated from us they can't be attributed to us when God looks at you he can't see sin because it's been separated from you by the blood and and the work of Christ at Calvary and that's why we walk in Liberty with him this morning is because he separated our sins and as he says they're as far away as the East is from the West you can't have you can't ever meet East never Meets West they go in opposite directions and they can never come back amen and but all of that is tied to the scripture that we just read and so I want to start in there and we're going to we're going to develop this thought this morning and it says there again I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and we preached on is he worthy and we know there was only one worthy but John says there is no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon notice it wasn't just opening he had to be worthy not just to open it but he had to be worthy to read it sometimes we say well he opened the Seven Seals but he had to be worthy to read it as well there had to be somebody that could look on it and read it in the way it was supposed to be read that could enforce what was written in the book if you want to get down to it he had to be able to enforce what was written in the book wasn't just worthy to open it but but could he make it happen as it was written in the book that was to be opened up and John says I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon now the prophet of God he starts to explain what's going on here he says you see in this book was what was redeemed we say what was the seven seal book what was this book that was that was covered up to the young people what was it that was so special about it brother Bram says it was the book of redemption and everything that he had redeemed was written in that book all he died for was written in the book and he could not leave his mediatorial seat until he had thoroughly redeemed listen this is not a partial Redemption this is not just here a little in their little this is a thorough Redemption it's going to be the full work it's going to be the completed work it's not just a partial thing that he's doing God doesn't do things halfway God does it all the way or he doesn't do it at all that's the way he works it's a thorough Redemption and he couldn't redeem it at the cross because they were predestinated in the Lamb's Book of Life he's saying what he did at the cross there was future considerations that he had to cover because remember he died there but it was for the sins of the entire world but two thousand years of people hadn't been born yet so he said he couldn't just finish the work at the cross he had to stay as a lamb until the last one's redeemed he says we were predestinated the Lamb's Book of Life and he had to stay on there to make intercessions until that last person was what not redeemed he says that last person was finished finished there is a work going on and it's not just to bring people out but it's to bring them to a position is to bring them to a place it's to bring them to a finished work he's got to stay there and he's got to mediate until it's a finished work he says Glory but one day he rose from there what the mediatorial work the behind the throne and he come forth he says where was the book at it was still in the abstract owner God Almighty and John looked around and he wept because there was no man even worthy to look on the book and especially open the seals to reveal what the hidden Mystery was the Mysteries was in the Seven Seals and when these Seven Seals was opened that opened up the entire Bible now that you see denominations today are nominal Christians they look at the Bible as a series of stories and historical events and maybe some promises but brother Brown says when those Seven Seals were open it was the opening of the word and it became an entirely new book because we see now not just stories but we see the types and the shadows of what the redeeming process of God all through time he says it became a whole new buck and he says later he says he says if you can't go back in your Bible and see Christ on every page go back and read it again because you missed something because there's a hidden mystery about what God does and how he does it and why he's doing it all through the scriptures he says the Seven Seals it was sealed with seven Mysteries and in these Seven Seals held the entire mystery of it and it was the book of redemption he says New Testament not the old it only proclaimed for the New Testament that they cannot be made perfect without us and he references Hebrews 11. he says now the Redemption only come when the Redeemer died why because that was the price that had to be paid had to be a perfect lamb had to die and they were potentially under the blood of lambs not the Redeemer they hadn't been redeemed yet until the Redeemer came now John looked around and here sat God on the throne with the book in his hand that had been sealed with Seven Seals and the whole Plan of Redemption was in it so he makes it very clear the whole Plan of Redemption is in here there is no new thing coming under those Seven Seals it's here it always was here but you didn't realize it and that's what the Seven Seals opening did was it showed us what was hidden in here and you you'll you'll scratch your head sometimes we're going to get into it later why does seven why is the mystery of of marriage and divorce the seven seal there's a reason for it why is the serpency there and godhead and all these things it's all tied in because you've got to know who you are you got to know where your natural is and you got to know where your spiritual is you got to know what reality of marriage is you got to know what Oneness is you got to know what relationship is and all of that was hidden since the days of Paul Paul had it all me and then after that they walked away and God sealed it up because there was a time appointed but it's all tied together into these things he says it had been lost by the human race Adam it went back where now catch this he says Satan couldn't take it he just caused him to lose it now that's the key point because what you look around at Satan's kingdom and he offers you so much but he can't offer you what's in the Redemptive book he can't offer you healing he can offer you salvation he can't offer you the Holy Ghost he can offer you Victory he can offer you Deliverance all he can offer you is pleasure and the things that you desire in your natural flesh but he can't give you what's in the book of redemption why because he doesn't have it it didn't go to him he just caused us to lose it he caused Humanity to lose it he said but where did the book go then didn't belong to the human race the blessings didn't belong here here the human race had lost it so it went right on back to the original owner that was god notice he says blessings are in that Redemptive book so Satan doesn't own it so Satan can't offer you blessings can he he can offer you something but he can offer you the blessings that God has for you now the scripture says that John wept bitterly when he saw that this book couldn't be open nobody could take it nobody could look out he was devastated because he knew what it was he knew what it was and he knew if it couldn't be opened if it couldn't be taken if it couldn't be read then we were lost and so he wept and he wept and he wept because there was no hope there's no hope he couldn't do it nobody could do it nobody passed present or future could do it above or below the Earth it didn't matter there was nobody that could open this book and then we see in verse 5 it says and then one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof he says what the lion of the tribe of Judah we know that the line is what he is the king of the beasts he rules the Savannah and he rules mercilessly there is no mercy in a line when he rules he rules with absolute Authority he's the most powerful killer there is on the Savannah nothing can touch a lion when it comes to fierceness it's interesting when you look at hunting when it comes to Lions because the women do most of the work the lionesses they hunt with skill and they hunt with teamwork and they've got a plan and then they execute the plan and then one out of five times they're they're lucky and they get it but you'll see there comes a time where the male lion gets hungry and he says enough of this plane around I'm the king of the Beast I don't have to wait and he takes it into his own hands and I was watching a video and there's this there's this place in Africa where the wildebeest have to go down a river and then they come up a bank and they have to go up a hill and it's an ambush spot and I was watching this video and there's this female lioness here and she's sitting there and there's wildebeest after wildebeest going back there's thousands going by and she's just sitting there and one after another goes by somebody told me it was a woman shopping for shoes here but but she's sitting there and she's not making a move you know why because she can only tackle the really old or the really small she's gotta find the right one that she has the power to take down and hold on to once she gets it down on the ground so she's sitting there and one after the other is going fine you think this is the most boring video you're ever going to watch and then all of a sudden this happens Big Poppy walks in and listen he's you know what he was doing was he was sitting over there saying that one's a good one that one's a good one that one's a good one that one's a good one that one's a good one and the and the Lioness is just laying them go by you know what he said he got hungry that's what he did he got hungry and he just charged in and you know what when he charged in he didn't go for the weak one he didn't go for the old one he didn't go for the young one the first one that he made contact with he said that's mine there was no there was no pre-planning here he just charged in the one to the right just got away you can see it really skittering there he just boom but knocks it down and then you see in the next one he just takes it by the neck and he drags it away lays on top of it subdues it and kills it that's what the male lion does amen we're talking about the prevailing lion this is what the prevailing lion looks like in the real world he doesn't wait for anything he doesn't need to he is confident in his supreme power and authority on that Savannah and he can kill anything that he wants to kill him when he decides he wants to kill it so it was amazing I was looking here but what struck me is that he didn't care how big it was he didn't care how small it was he didn't care how fast it was running he said I'm the king of the beasts I rule this land I take what I want and that's the nature of a prevailing line is that it when it sets its mind on something that does it it doesn't sit there and think about it it doesn't Wonder am I able to do it amen but this is the nature of the one that came forward to take the book was that he said what the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed that means not only has he fought but he has won he's got the Victory and now he's coming forth and that Victory looked like a lamb sling that was his victory was he had been slain but as he comes forth to take it now it is not the nature of a lamb but is the nature of a lion the Victor the the king of the Beast that comes forth to take this out of the hand that's there why because he's going to need the lion nature to fulfill Redemption now he had to die to pay the price but he needs a lion's characteristics to take what now belongs to him that's what we're going to be getting into amen he needs that because what when he opens that book what does he see he sees people that aren't in his kingdom anymore because we were what lost and undone without God or his son as the song says that we were lost in our sins and so he looks at that book and he needs the nature of a lion to go in what secure the kingdom to get his children back under his protection to drive out the things that are there uh my my boys and I were watching a video on lions and and one of them a male lion got caught by a pack of hyenas guess what 20 hyenas can kill a lion but then his brother came along and two lions put 20 hyenas on the Run because what he was surrounded and as one but with two in there he went in and boom there was they scattered they knew they couldn't take two of them but the idea here is that what he knows who he is and he knows he's got a kingdom and he'll protect it to the death if he has to he'll protect it to the death there's nothing going to stop that King amen he has Supreme confidence in who and what he is you ever see a lion when he's walking around and he walks and and you'll see this that as he walks he doesn't look to the left or to the right he just goes where he's going to go and God helped the thing that gets in front of him he just goes and he walks and he looks near to left to right he knows everything that's going on he's very aware he's hyper aware of what's happening but he doesn't care what's there and you've got to get out of his way because that's his path and he's walking on it because he's the king of the beasts amen why because he's going to be dealing with the satanic Kingdom that does not move my negotiation Satan does he Satan wants you to negotiate give up a little bit just back off a little bit don't delete the app just only go on once a week don't go to that website every day but you can check on it a couple times a week right don't spend too much time with that person okay you've been spending too much but let's just back away a little bit you know what the scripture says if your eye offend thee pluck it out if your arm offend you cut it off and Satan doesn't want you to pluck out or cut off he wants you to keep a little bit in there so that he has an inroads into your life that's the negotiation tactic let's not kick me out of your life let's just maybe put me out so it looks like you have control if you don't put him out he's still in control Amen in the king anointing the line anointing does not let Satan hang around the fringes he boots him out completely he's the king of the Beast he's the king of the Savannah and that's the anointing that we're looking at amen so when the line anointing comes it is not negotiation now it is not sacrificed it is for battle and it is for Dominion that's what he's in this for he's in there to what win the battle he had to die and that was the first Victory but now he rose again brother Brown says if he never rose again we couldn't be redeemed couldn't be redeemed now he's coming in what power and demonstration verse 6 says and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth he says then the land comes forward and he takes the book now John was asked not to weep anymore he said behold the lion of Judah has prevailed and he can take the book and open it so he turned to look for a lion and he saw a lamb and the Elder called and said a lion has prevailed but when he come and looked it was a lamb coming out from the throne now he'd never noticed that before why he the lion the lamb the lamb had been back there and he's doing his mediatorial work for he was bleeding for the people interceding for the people until the last soul that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world come in he says there's just going to be so many of them there and and that's it that's all the others won't even want to come in they have no desire to come in so what on the Lamb's Book of Life That's the ones that are predestinated and he says that's the ones he's waiting for that's why he's mediating that's why he's in that lamb anointingness to get that last one in then as soon as it's in then what it switches to lion he says so then when that last Soul comes in then the time of redemption is finished for the Gentiles then the lamb comes forth to claim his rights to what he has redeemed and that's all finished the Earth and everything belongs to him see he has redeemed it with his own blood and when he come forth to take this book to open it John didn't weep anymore and now we found out that a slain lamb is a bloody lamb bleeding all over it's been slayed and after it had been slain it raised up it raised again it was sitting on the throne say back in behind the throne like this interceding for all those Souls that would come that's why it wasn't finished at Calvary he had to stay in a mediatorial role because there was others going to be born after that he says now when the last one was here and it was completed God still held the book of redemption see now he's just doing the Kinsman work so he says Christ is behind there and he's mediating mediating mediating mediating and the blood is covering and there's blood on The Mercy Seat and we're still in the spot where Christ is doing the Kinsmen Redeemer work he's what he's mediating he's covering everything that's why there's mercy here and it's why the world is the way it is because when he comes as lion full lion you don't want to be on this Earth because he only comes in judgment then he's coming to claim his own and he's coming to what judge everything else that's here and the world can be slacked now because he's not judging them yet why because there's mercy here there's Mercy for the bride right and in that Mercy there's Mercy for everyone else as well potentially potentially everyone on the earth could have mercy today if they wanted it now watch he says then he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne now notice he doesn't open it he's a lamb here and he takes the book as a lamb he's in the lamb anointing as he takes it but he does not open the book as a lamb but watch brother Brown says what was it the owner of the original that had the book of redemption in his right hand No Angel no Angelic being nothing else could take the place he says in this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand here what was it brother he says this is the most Sublime thing in scripture an act that not an angel not nothing can do it and the lamb came forth and took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne he said what is it now it belongs to the lamb he takes it now it belongs to him amen God's law required he's the one that holds it God's law required a kinsman redeemer and the lamb came out holding it and says I am their Kinsmen I am their redeemer I've made intercession for them now catch this he says and now I've come to claim their rights for them you say he came to claim it for himself he says no I came to claim their rights for them so he's the enforcer now that we get what he has purchased because remember the redeemer's job is not to get something for himself but it's to restore something to the original owner and he says I'm here to restore your claim to your rights that you lost when Adam and Eve fell in the Garden of Eden he says that's the only one I've come to claim their rights in that they have a right to everything to everything that was lost in the fall and I paid the price so the Redeemer gets to take the title but he's got to give it to the person that owns the title that's what he's doing is he says I've come to restore what I bought for you so there's something in here for us it's not just him he's he's redeeming a bride but there's something in there for us because he gave it to us when Adam and Eve were on the Earth they had full Dominion they had full relationship full Fellowship eternal life and these different things we've covered before he says oh brother who don't that make you feel religious inside not by Good Works which we have done but by his Mercy you see nothing of me when he steps up from that Throne as a bloody lamb and takes the book I'm in the book but I have nothing to do with the taking of the book oh wait a minute and them elders and everything else begin to throw off crowns and dignitaries began to get on the ground see no one no one could do it and he walks right up to the right hand of God and took the book out of his hand and claimed his rights I have died for them I am their Kinsmen Redeemer I am the mediator my blood was shed I have become men and I did this in order to get that church back again the one I foresaw before the foundation of the world he foresaw what was written in the book because he wrote it now catch this brother John purposed it no no no no no Minister purposed you being here no father no mother no Aunt no uncle no great Christian he said I have purposed it I spoke it that it would be there and nobody was able to take it but I went down and done it myself I am their Kinsmen I am become Kim soaks and he takes the book amen oh who is waiting there for me tonight who is that one church that's waiting there who else could wait there for you that kinsman redeemer oh my what a Sublime act now he has the title deed to Redemption he has it in his hand mediation is done now he has it in his hand remember it's been in the hand of God all the time but now it's in the hand of the land now watch the title deed of redemption of all creation is in his hand and he's come to claim it back too for who the human race not claim it back to Angels claimed it back to the humans which it was given for what to make Sons and Daughters of God again there is an effect of the reading of this book and it's to make us sons and daughters again we always were sons and daughters but to what make a parent the seed that was inside us all along he says what bring them back to the Garden of Eden and everything they lost the whole creation the trees the animal life everything else oh my doesn't that make you feel good it does something to you see for I know this there is someone there waiting for me you know it's amazing to me but brother Brandon would focus on what not all power not all authority not all wonderful streets paved with gold I've Got a Mansion over there he says no no no there's someone waiting there for me that was the thing that mattered the most to him there is one that paid the price and that's the one that's waiting there for me there is someone paid the price that I couldn't pay that's right he did it for me did it for you he did it for the whole human race and now he comes forth to claim his Redemptive rights claim it for who not for himself for us he is one of us he is our kin folks oh my he's my brother he's my savior he's my God he's my kinsman redeemer he is all for what was I without him or what could I be without him so see he is My All In All and he's standing there as our Kim folks and now he's been interceding for us up until this time and now he comes forth and takes the book of redemption to claim his rights of what he did for us remember the Kinsmen Redeemer he doesn't claim it for himself he pays the price and then gives what he paid the price for to the one that he paid it for in the first place amen it's not for him he benefits he benefits if there's a restoration in our family if there's a restoration in our church we benefit but the primary benefactor is what the one who had the price paid for them that didn't cost them a penny amen it says and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of Voters which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song because what everyone was weeping everyone was crying everybody was in a hopeless Affair a state of affairs nobody had any Joy or peace or rest up there they're sitting there saying somebody's got to take the book and open it and nobody's doing it so it was a mournful time in heaven even in the presence of God it was mournful but they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth and I beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand that's a lot that's Millions he says and thousands of thousands that's a million so there's millions and then there's tens of millions that's how many God has saved over there and they're saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain that's what he came out as was a slain lamb but watch now to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing now these are not the attributes of a lamb these are the attributes of a lion these are the attributes of a king of a ruler of a supreme authority amen the lamb anointing now moves away and the line anointing takes over and he comes to take possession amen and it's what now it's victory time it's not mediation time now it's time for battle not time for negotiation now time to lay your life down but time to lay to pick your life back up again amen what there's no holding them back now when he takes that and opens it up nothing's going to stop him he says in every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I sane blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four be said amen and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down and worshiped him and liveth forever and ever now it's easy to sit here and say well we're brother John he said very clearly that we're under the lamb anointing because The Mercy Seat there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat but you've got to understand that God transitions there's a blending of things that happen and you even see it in the blending from the Gentiles to the Jews there's an absolute moment where he stops to work with the Gentiles and that's the Rapture of the Saints amen the rev the the Resurrection The Rapture that's when he stops the deal with the Gentiles and he moves to the Jews but there's still a blending there's still a preparation that's going on and we see that that line anointing is there because when we look in the scriptures we see that he's already roared and if we turn to Revelation 10 we see the transition that happens and Revelation 10 1 says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now that's Christ if you look in Revelation 1 that's the very description of Christ so it says Christ comes down and he's not a bleeding lamb anymore he's a mighty Angel this is a powerful Angel that's coming down he's not coming in humility but he's coming in power and authority and in a majesty and he had in his hand a little book open now remember the lamb took it and it was closed but now he comes as a mighty Angel and it's open so it's open as a mighty Angel not as a lamb he held it as a lamb but it's a it it's in the it's in power and Majesty that he opens this book amen and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth so what do lambs do lambs bleat he's not a lamb here but what when he speaks it's as a lion roaring amen he's moved into a different anointing now because he's in a different purpose and you see that all through the scriptures you see it even in the four beasts he starts with a line you know and he goes to ox and man and Eagle again God Moves In anointings God moves in characteristics and the characteristic here is he's opening these seals is as a what lion because as he speaks it's as a lion roaring and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices now so as soon as he starts to open the seals and read them then what happens a lion roars right he stepped into a different anointing he stepped into a different position he stepped into a different place in the word and he changes who he is he changes what he is he's always been it but he steps into that phase of his ministry if we wanted to put it that way amen it's not a lamb bleeding now but it's a lion roaring why because he's taking possession of what's written in those books in that book amen brother Brown says Christ has redeemed us now we are now redeemed but he has not claimed his possession yet he hasn't claimed it see if he took the book of redemption everything that Adam had in everything that he lost Christ redeems that back and he's already redeemed us but he hasn't took the possession yet he cannot until the time appointed and then will come the resurrection and then the Earth will be renewed again and then he'll take possession his possession which he got when he redeemed us but he will do it at the appointed time verse 4 says and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which are seven Thunders uttered and write them not so he's already read the book this is past tense this is in the days of John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos and so God has already read it as a lion prophetically but then what happens is what he says now close it up because there is a time appointed for it and it's not right now and we see that even in the early church because the first the first anointing in the church was what lion and they were imperfection there they were they were ruled absolutely I mean from the day of Pentecost out they were walking around in the power of the Holy Ghost under the direct power of the Holy Spirit under the guidance of God and in there that church was perfect you couldn't go in that church and and and be sinful or or trying to hide things from God and we saw that with anias and Safara they came in and Peter said why have you why have you tried to hide things from the Holy Spirit why have you tried to lie and they were struck dead because they did it the church was in perfect operation but what happened was what they moved away they left their first love and so God says seal up the book God had showed all of this to Paul remember the book there's nothing new in the book the book was written everything that we need is here already Paul already knew all about it in general in general not everything that John saw but Paul knew what it meant to be fully redeemed Paul knew what it meant to be in full relationship with Christ the whole church had it that's what it was it was a perfect State at the beginning and then it dropped drop drop into a valley and then it came up again at this time amen but what happened is they moved away from God and they went to the to to men and so God said close it up close it up I can't finish it there's a purpose there's a plan still here God wasn't taken by surprise when they did it God hasn't ever taken by surprise nothing outwits or out foxes God God knew it beforehand so God says seal it up there's a Time coming when we're going to open this up and we're going to finish the work that I've started verse 5 says in the angel which I saw stand upon the scene upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are in the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer so there's a time where he says enough's enough we got to open the books amen and verse 7 says the time but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophet so there's a final time chosen for this book of redemption to be fully opened again it was sealed up there's a time for it to open up and it's when in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the seventh angel is the seventh Church age messenger the laodicean messenger we recognize that as William Branham so when he begins to speak when his message comes forth then that's when the mystery of God is going to be fully revealed and that's when Redemption really starts to kick off remember brother Brown said the Rapture is a process redemption's a process and so you can't just say absolutely he's a lamb and then he's a lion because the lion anointing is what brings his possession the lamb anointing is what keeps him safe under the blood but he's doing both Works simultaneously at the end of all things amen lamb time is nearly over you look around the world it's as it was in the days of no it's as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah right that's all Luke 17 30 all these things it's being fulfilled it's been fulfilled I don't know how much worse it can get it's going to get worse but you don't see how much worse it can get the times are here the lamb time is nearly over Church These about to come off of The Mercy Seat and when he comes off there's no more coming in so the thing is when the lion roars what's it supposed to do it's supposed to catch our attention it's supposed to say the lion is war there's something going on because God doesn't speak without purpose God doesn't just say things God speaks with purpose and with intent so when he does it then what the church is supposed to perk up their ears and say something's about to happen because the lion has roared there's something that's going on Amen and what it's got to be a king that comes because he's got to be the king of your life he's got to be the king of your body he's got to be the king of your habits he's got to be the king of your family he's got to be the king of your relationships and your marriage and your career and all these things and it's going to take a kingly anointing to burn out what we don't have to that what we're not supposed to have in there right he's got to be a king because everyone wants him as Savior even the unbeliever could say I want him as a savior in the sense that they would appreciate to have that benefit but how many want them as Lord because he's got to be Lord and savior imagine he can only be Lord under a line anointing not a lamb anointing that's the king the king is the lion every single time amen brother Bram says this he says look at the zodiac I can't no oh I put in the wrong place okay sorry no I put that in the right place sorry I missed it in my notes there because we saw what remember he says what when he Roars the Seven Seals are opened amen and in the days of the seventh angel then the mystery was going to be finished and we saw what we saw the opening of the seals didn't we it was in the seven angel cloud that came down on Sunset mountain in 1963 and Time Magazine recorded it and they talked about the high cloud ring of mystery brother Brown said see him there he is in the cloud Christ coming down and what was he coming down as he says he's wigged as what a judge he says he's not coming down as a lamb anymore Church he's coming down with judgment but we're not judged yet but he's come down because he's calmed down but he hasn't appeared yet in the way that we're going to see him but he's here so you have this blending that's happening you have this Cross Point you have a junction that's happening and he's moving out of one and he's moving into another and it says judge and he said it says King amen he's going to come back after three and a half years as King of Everything But he comes down first as king of what the bride that's what he's coming down and so we saw this amen brother Brown says look at the Zodiac it starts off with a virgin it ends up with Leo the Lion the first coming and the second coming of Christ everything in the heavens declares him everything in the earth declares him everything around declares him his people declares him his power declares himself he did his mediatorial work as a lamb and there was no power in that it was laying down his life there was no exercise of authority was it but when he picked his life up again that's when he exercised Authority that's when he showed the power that was there amen and so he what he starts in humility but he ends up in power and Majesty is what brother Branham is saying there what is it the king of the Beast is relentless he's Relentless and if there's anything I want you to catch this morning is that if you're in that book of redemption he's not going to stop until he's done until you're a finished work that's what he's pressing for today he's not pressing to clean up the world he's not pressing to clean up everyone that's out there he's not there to change the politics he's not there to change the social justice movements and this program and that program he's there to get you to where you need to be in the word to get you to what's written about you in this in this great book of redemption that's all he's focused on and he is Relentless in that and he's going to do whatever it takes to get us there whether he has to shake you whether he has to spank you whether he has to log in hot love and hug and kiss on you whatever it takes whatever it takes to make you get there he's going to do on it amen what he knows his territory he knows you're his and he's going to be relentless to defend it to clean it out and to keep it where he wants it to be amen proverbs 30 says there be three things which go well yay four are coming and going now that's not language used today but that word go well and comely and going means there are three things which are stately and Majestic in how they walk and he said a lion which is strongest among beasts and turneth not away for any and I put this picture of this line you see a lion walking towards you like that what do you do do you stand your ground not unless you have a very high powered rifle with a backup and a backup on your backup okay when he's looking like this when he's walking like this the mains flared the head's down the eyes and tent you don't stand in front of that and the scripture says this is there's three things four that walk like this and the first one they say is what a lion walking this is the Relentless King walking here now and as he walks as I said he doesn't back down he doesn't give away to anything if he's walking through the kingdom what does he do he's just walking straight on he doesn't look at brother George he doesn't look at brother Bob doesn't look at sister Justine he's just looking where he's going and then if he wants to turn around then he wants to turn around and brother George if he wants you to move what do you do move you move why because you see that look in his eyes and it doesn't Brook any sort of attitude you know what you do you know what happens when you give attitude to a lion you die without Mercy that's what he says there's nothing Walks Like a Lion on this Earth when it's walking through the kingdom it doesn't give any regard to anyone or anything it just goes where it wants and God help the person or the thing that gets in front of it This Is Our God Church when he is on the move when he's walking through the Kingdom look out because if you're not with them you're against them if you're not a part of the family you're going to be in trouble if you try and get in front of them amen what is it he's measured he's Regal the lion isn't flustered you don't see him all twitching and nervous as he's walking through he's just calm cool and collected because he knows who and what he is he's the king of all it's the king of all nothing will touch him Amos 3 a very familiar scripture says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets that's what we just read in Revelation 10 7 was what God revealing his secret to his Prophet the lion roars and then the prophet comes to tell us what the lion said he says the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord God hath spoken who came but prophesy because what when the lion roars what happens to everything else they get quiet don't they they get nervous because they're not sure what's about to happen because when a lion roars what he's doing is he's declaring his territory he's there to let people know there's a lion here already you don't want to come in he's letting he's setting boundaries is what he's doing but you know who isn't scared when the lion roars his family when Daddy Roars little cubs aren't scared because that's just daddy talking now if he's roaring at you that's a little difference but you'll see that you'll know when he's roaring at you but when he's just roaring and there's nothing around what's he doing you know Daddy's protecting us Daddy's setting the boundaries dad's letting it be known he's got everything under his control and under his authority and look out because he's feeling real feisty today he's letting everybody know Daddy's on Daddy's up the King has awoken and he's hungry that's what he's saying he said and when he does it it's supposed to cause us to sit up and take notice because what when he Roars what happens he says who can but prophesy if there's a prophet in the land if there's an anointed vessel if there's an anointed Minister when he speaks then that man will catch it and you'll take it to the people because what God does it do if God's telling things and we can't hear it God doesn't speak without purpose God doesn't speak to hear himself say things he speaks and it's an anointed word and he takes it and he gives it to his servants the prophet so they can speak it to us so that we know what God's going to do what God's doing and what we have to do as a part of that amen it's not going to do us any good if he's roaring and we're not hearing anything but then there's another lion because first Peter 5 8 says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil he doesn't say a roaring lion he says as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour there's only one true lion in The Bible and that's Christ that's God Amen that's the only King there and that's the only supreme ruler and in every instance it's Christ but then we see what we see an imitation we see an imposter that wants to be considered as a lion he wants to be a ruler he wants to have dominion he wants to strike fear into the hearts of those that are around him and so he's going around and he's trying to sound like a lion now here's the thing if you've never heard a lion and you hear something Roar in the jungle something make a really loud ferocious sound you might say that's probably a lion but when you hear a lion for the first time you'll know that that the devil's not a line ever again but if you've never met the lion you might be convinced don't go in there there's a line in there if somebody tells you but when you hear a lion and you know what a roar really sounds like you'll say hey that ain't a lion kind of curious what's in there now because why he's trying to make it sound like he's the Ferocious King of the Savannah when really scripture says we'll look narrowly on him we'll look down at him and say is this the man that troubled Nations because he's a little wimp with a big voice a little wimp with a big voice remember brother Brown said that and I believe the scripture says as well that he's under the feet he's under our feet everything is under our feet including him if we ever caught a glimpse of what Satan really is he's a puny little wimp with a big voice but he walks around like a roaring lion what's he trying to do he's trying to keep you out of your kingdom he's trying to keep you out of your land trying to keep you out of your property he's trying to keep you from going into what this book says belongs to you and so he Roars really really loudly he stays hidden though that's the worst thing you know they say that when it comes to to you know in in the military and when they're they're trying to get information out of people they say the threat of what you're going to do is far more effective than actually doing it on the Savannah sound and you see the the the stalks of grass moving but you don't see what's in there then what do you think you think the worst don't you you don't think it's a little deer or a bunny rabbit you think it's the biggest meanest animal that's out there and that's what Satan's doing is all he's doing is he's giving the impression of something large and Powerful moving there big noises making movement letting you know there's something out there and you can't see what it is because he's trying to keep you from finding out exactly who and what he is as a roaring lion he's not a king but he's trying to act like a king amen amen Satan makes a racket that's one thing Satan does is he makes a racket but there's nothing behind it amen but the beautiful thing is for everything Satan does God has a counter-attack God has something to show you the reality behind the situation amen and that's why in this last stage where what under a prophetic anointing we're under an eagle anointing because what now you can get above it and when you get above it you can see it for what it is when you're down on ground like a man remember under under Luther it was a man anointing you can only see so far but when you're flying on the heights of Revelation you can see everything nothing's hidden from the eyes of the eagle is it they can go as high as they want to stay safe and they can still see with perfect vision all the way down to the ground to find out what it is that's moving down there amen brother Brown says this and then another thing I believe that when Satan which was prophesied would go about like a roaring lion in the last days to destroy mortal life and spiritual life and everything that he could I believe then if all the dumpings of all the evil is being dumped out on the human race in this day I believe that all the blessings will be dumped out as it was or poured out rather by our heavenly father upon the church in these last days it says what a day we're living in we look and we say and I've just said it it's it's it's it's a horrible time this laodicea right the sexual immorality the the political immorality the financial immorality the the relationships and the things that they're trying to say are normal it's it's disgusting it's horrible and brother but I'm saying if all of that is being poured out then there has to be an opposite amount being poured out to counteract it not only an equal amount but a greater than amount amen remember when the enemy comes in like a flood then the spirit of God will raise up a standard and brother Brown said that's the holy spirit being poured in to counteract what Satan's throwing at you right that's what we're looking at he's saying that's the pouring out we need there's going to be a short quick work that happens in all of this and it'll be when God pours out that last great anointing on the church and nothing will be able to stand in front of us then nothing can now but it'll be about it'll be a greater power demonstration than we've seen today except in the perhaps the ministry of Christ and brother Branham himself and these things amen by saying there's a pouring out that God has for us amen so when we feel like we're overwhelmed when we feel like it's been too much it's been too long just know if you don't have the victory yet there's more coming there's more to have there's more to be had there's more to do there's more Victory ahead we sing that song Victory ahead Victory ahead Victory is ahead folks because the king is here amen what did we hear we read in Revelation 10 where that lion roared and we we saw God and he was reading out of that book and what was he doing he's calling out names not just names but he's calling out property descriptions who's calling out what belongs to you who's calling out Redemptive blessings and he was attaching it to the name who's that was written next to those things amen because it's not just for one there's only one person it's not just one person the church gets healing and everyone else doesn't those are Redemptive they're for all they're for all of us amen but then he looks next to your name and he's calling your name and the first name maybe he called was Mark Coffey and he called my coffee and what was it it wasn't a lamb calling it was a lion roaring and he was calling out Mark coffin he ripped off the Seal of Mark coffey's life and now Mark coffee is looking at that and he's starting to read and he's starting to be quick and this is me this is me this is me oh my goodness I need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I need to cut my hair I need to get rid of my music I need to get into fellowship and all these things and what is it it's the lion roaring and he's hearing it called out and he says that's me I'm our coffee over here why because the line is wrong he's taking possession he's letting it be known that he's in the business of restoration now as we heard brother John speaking about amen it's not a mild or Meek call it's irresistible it catches your attention the bleeding of a lamb won't get your attention but the Roar of a lion will especially if you recognize that's my daddy and that's what's going on Amen what's he doing he let him know brother Mark it's your time it's your age it's your season it's your time of life it's time for you to bring forth what's written in this book and brother Mark couldn't have done it on his own until that moment but as soon as God spoke as soon as the lion roars then life can come forth and now you can start to step onto your property now you can see what's written about you in this great book of redemption amen what did he do he wrote it before Mark Coffey was ever born before was ever born it was sealed that's the beauty of it it was sealed you can't change it you can't change it can't add to it you can't take away from it because it's sealed but as soon as he starts reading it the word Goes Forth and the word is Anointed and it will do what it said it is going to do reminds me of those I don't know if they still have them anymore but the Energizer Bunny commercials commercials remember the Energizer batteries and they've got that rabbit that goes around and keeps beating the drum and it says it just keeps going and going and going and he just keeps walking around around they have some competitors batteries powering the same thing and He Flops over and falls over that's what the word of God is like it goes and it goes and it goes and it goes until it achieves what it was set forth to do because it's anointed to do it amen the word is Anointed everything else Falls but he says not one jot not one Tittle is going to fail of the words that I send forth amen so it's what it's not a work that Mark Coffey started so work that God started so it's not going to be a work that Mark Coffey finishes because the work's already finished in the book and all he's got to do is recognize his partner who and what he is that's all he's doing that's what the faith for us to do is to read our portion of the book and say that's mine that's me not just mine because everybody wants stuff but how many of us want me as in I want to be what he says I am that's what we're looking for in our lives amen because you look here Christ has been dormant I use the term loosely since here they kicked him out right and then they went to the Nicene Council and they kicked them out even more and more and more and we went down and then we come back in here and we start to come up again but through from here to here there's almost nothing almost nothing God just wasn't doing anything because it was man getting further and further away but God knew it and he accounted for it and now he comes back in here and we've got the same anointing here that they had there potentially potentially you may not have it now but you're going to have it if you don't have it a man because he's pouring it out and he's pouring it out but he's what he's coming back to here and that's what he why he had to open the word he had to give us the same thing that they had back there because what what It produced there it'll produce here but it'll just continue on because what the the seals are open now it can take us all the way through into the fullness of redemption amen amen but I want you to catch this morning while we're talking about this line anointing why it's a line roaring and a lion prevailing and not a lamb and it's because the lion is what he's supposed to give you courage supposed to Quicken you supposed to get you to wake up he's supposed to give you rest in who and what he is because you're a part of his family right supposed to give you a calmness and a security that everything is going to work out all right even though maybe it doesn't seem like it because Daddy's on the scene the king is on the scene you know so often you look through history and the King just sat back and got fat and lazy and took taxes from The Peasants and and ran him into the ground and didn't really care about them this is not the king that we have he is up and he is moving and he is working in his church to achieve what he said he was going to do in her amen hey man you're a part of his family and what is he doing he's coming as a lion to take what power and authority over anything anything that would hold you back from coming into your position and place in Christ he's listen God's determined God's purpose way before you ever did what you did yesterday way before you ever failed or fell or said this or didn't say that did this didn't do that way before it was done and all he's doing now is he's purpose to make it happen in your life you can't stop it praise the Lord you can't stop it I can't stop it God's gonna do what he's purposed to do brother Bob says this God's purpose can never be defeated so if you know what his purpose is don't get in the way don't get in the way because it's not he's not going to choose you over his word you get out of the way you get in front of him you're going to get steamrolled because the lion gives way for No One the word doesn't stop because you're a child the word will correct you and bring you back to where you need to be God's purpose can never be defeated there is nothing can defeat it so how happy are we to be today resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there's neither things present nor things that can come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no perils nor nothing can separate us from the purpose of the Living God when God what God has imagined in his mind what God has purpose in his heart to bring to pass there is no demon there's no power there is nothing can ever separate God's Great Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said this is not a lamb's attitude church this is the lion's attitude he says it's going to happen and I'm going to make sure that it happens amen what is it he's coming for and he says I pay the price now I'm coming to get it now I'm coming to enforce what I paid the price for and nothing's going to stop me nothing's going to separate us from the love of God that's what Paul said nothing why he always is moving with purpose God doesn't just roam around Satan's a roamer you know what he said in the days of job raw mean to and fro That's what Satan does God doesn't do that God goes here and he does what he said he was going to do then he goes there and here and there he moves with purpose he doesn't he doesn't get frazzled he doesn't get frustrated he doesn't get overworked God just moves with purpose and he knows exactly what he's doing every time he's very deliberate God is deliberate and when God decides something's going to happen it happens and it happens fast amen I want to put this into a bit of a a night nice little bow tied package here because I want you to see what this looks like in in real life and back in Exodus 23 God was speaking to Moses and he's speaking prophetically what's going to happen to Moses he's telling them what's going to happen and God is showing his lie inside and look at this in Exodus 23 20 he says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared so what was that angel it was a pillar of fire wasn't it notice it's a capital A this is not an angel this is the Angel this is Christ himself in the pillar of fire amen and he says I've sent them for two purposes first to keep you keep you in his way that's the purpose of the presence of Christ that's the purpose of the presence of the holy spirit in our life is to keep us on the straight and narrow to take us to where we're supposed to go but then he says then it's the brainly to the place I have prepared so as to keep you safe as you go and to bring you to where he wants you to be amen but after they cross over you notice this Angel he disappears he's no longer going before them in the pillar fire but he's still there isn't he and when he crosses over what does he look like the captain of the host and he has what a sword drawn right this is not a lamb anointing anymore now it's a line anointing what he's leading them into battle he's securing the victory for them he says beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not remember that picture we showed of that lion stalking you want to be aware of that lion don't you don't provoke a lion don't say don't don't don't tug on his tail don't nip on his hindquarters because what you provoke him he's going to lash out that be very respectful of the Big Daddy lion beware of him obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him I saw a clip of a of a daddy lion and uh the Cubs were all over him and he kind of you know a couple times to let him know it wasn't right and then he turned around he just went enough's enough right they didn't respect him and he was not having it because I mean if you ever had even little puppies you know they have those sharp little needle teeth I imagine it's even worse for Lions because they have claws and sharp needle teeth anyways he had enough he just swatted them away right leave me alone I feel like him sometimes but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice praise the Lord children if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for mine Angels shall go before thee and bring me into the amorites and the Hittites and the parasites and the Canaanites the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off brother Brahm says this this is history church this is history this is a long time ago brother Brian says God has never changed just the same today as he was then God is determined to do something he'll do it nothing's going to stop him he'll do it therefore when God does anything or makes a decision as I've often quoted that he always has to stay with his decision how that ought to Enlighten our faith see when God says something all heavens and Earths will pass away but that cannot pass away therefore it should give us character it should give us Faith to take that word which he has said and with all of our life hold on to it because he cannot change it it's true scripture says that God is not a man that he should lie there's no shadow of variableness nor turning in him when he says he's going to do it he's going to do it and you just gotta hold on he's got to hold on that's the trial of our faith every time verse 27 says I will send my fear before thee we think oh the the great bride the great bride she's going to do this and that listen if you think it's ever you shake your head and probably don't even go out to battle because he says I'll send my fear before you and destroy all the people to whom Thou shalt come and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs under thee he says I'm going to make them all run away now this is the king speaking this is what a king looks like amen this is the all-powerful god this is the promised Giver the Waymaker the the jailbreaking the delivering God speaking now this is what it looks like he says and I will send Hornets before thee which shall drive out the hivite the Canaanite the hittite from before Thee I will not drive them out before thee in one year lest the lamb become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee now we preached on this before but sometimes we say God why don't you just clean us all up why don't you just just wipe Satan's influence out of my life take everything away heal me you know save me fill me with the Holy Ghost give me perfect relationship give me perfect family give me per no no no he says I'm gonna go bit by bit he says because otherwise if I drive it all out in one stop in one move he says then the Beast will come in attracted by all the dead bodies in the dead and you'll have a real problem on your hands he says you can't leave things empty you got to fill it as you go and that's what God does for us is he takes something out and then he fills it doesn't he word by word line upon line here little there little that's the way God moves in a believer's life and then sometimes he does a real work a supernatural work it's all Supernatural but he'll do a uh you know I think brother John was talking about it the difference between healing and a miracle sometimes he does a miracle in our lives and you get instant Deliverance but that's not the way he normally works it's all Supernatural but it's not always a miracle sometimes it's bit by bit the way he's talking about here still a line anointing still a concrete still a victory anointing but it's bit by bit sometimes so that you can handle you're able to control you're able to hold on to the land that he takes for you he says by little and little I will drive them out from before thee now notice you're there but he's the one doing the driving he says until thou be increased and inherit the land so notice he's driving them out but who's the ones doing the fighting the Israelites sometimes we think we're the ones doing the fighting therefore we're the ones getting the victory no no no no no no he's going before us to secure the victory but it looks a whole lot like work doesn't it because it's a battle every day it's a battle every day because he's still got to produce a bribe with character and this is what it looks like amen so don't ever think that it's just you but on the flip side don't ever think that God doesn't use you because you're fighting he's just making sure you win right that's right you've still gotta fight you've still got to hold your sword you still got to use it but he's the one that enforces what you're using because when you use his word it can't return void that's why you use the word that's why Christ used that against Satan was he showed that that's the only thing you need you don't need programs you don't need great this or wonderful that or huge no no you need to take the word and apply it the way it's written and that'll secure the victory every single time amen that's why we have such a focus on the word in the message is because that is what we need to secure the victory this is what tells us who and what we are it tells us how to get what we need to have because it's God that's given it to us it's not just me taking it it's God telling me to take it it's God telling me to go and possess the land amen but notice here he says what I will drive them out let me say it this way if you're not driving them out then maybe consider that you're not walking in the path that the Angel's leading because if you keep getting defeated what does that tell you God's not with you if you keep losing then it means God's not in the situation so you got to get God in the situation and sometimes getting God in this situation is you actually getting out of the situation back away back away you're not where you need to be so get away get back in the path and that's where the angel of the Lord will be that's where the Holy Spirit can anoint you to do what you're supposed to do but if you keep insisting on losing then God just says well he enjoys losing she enjoys losing she enjoys what she's doing he enjoys what he's doing so much more than they enjoy me so I'm just going to let them sit there and get beat up been there done that till you finally say enough enough no more no Moss and you come back to him because he can't come down that path remember brother John preached on the prodigal son he had to come to himself he had to come to himself to the point where he says this is not the way a son or a daughter of God is living because he didn't have the victory did he they wouldn't even give him the corn husks they were giving the swine you get to you get to such a point where you're not being fed and you don't have anything and you and you keep saying you got the holy spirit in your life and you say but the fruits aren't there so go back to where you left them go back to the last place you had them because that's probably where he is standing there because you did something of your own your own choosing amen and again I speak from experience I'm not preaching down to anyone I'm preaching to myself that brother Bram says it this way the devil's wrong and God Is Right God is right so if you're not on God's side you're wrong again speaking by experience it will always be that way the devil will lose and God will always win so that's why I say if you keep losing there's something wrong because God always wins in the end there are setbacks listen the Second Battle they had in Canaan they lost didn't they why because somebody got out of the will of God they disobeyed the word and it pulled the whole congregation back and hope pulled the whole church back but as soon as they corrected it victory was theirs again no problems as long as you stay with the word he says so if you're wrong you're on the wrong side you're sure to lose and if you're on the right side you're on God's side notice how because we say I'm right no no no are you on God's right what God says is right listen I thought I was right plenty times in my life I wasn't right I'm Still Human still subject to like passions amen sometimes we're wrong and we got to Humble ourselves and say clearly I'm wrong because the victory isn't there if you're on the right side you're on God's side and you're sure to win you can't lose now God's plan is laid out in his Bible and this is what we must go by it must come from his word because my words will fail I'm a man but God's word can't fail because it's God he said so will it be when the coming of the Lord will come again God's word is infallible what he said would take place will take place there's nothing can stop it no hindrance can stop it what hindrances do you have in your life today what's holding you back what's bugging you what's bothering you what's frustrating you he says no hindrance will stop it no matter how times change have times changed brother Gerald have times changed times have changed since he was born times have changed since I was born times have changed since my kids were born times have changed since Samuel was born that's how fast things are changing he says it doesn't matter how much times change how people change have people changed absolutely they change with the times don't they change with the seasons change with the weather these days he says no matter how preachers change how churches change God's word will remain it's going to come he'll be here he'll come in his glory with all of his angels that's right God's word said so and someday every individual sitting in this room today will bear record and seeing him coming in glory now listen to this he'll be coming to your joy or to your sorrow one or the other that's right he's got to come God's word is infallible amen I want to be joyful at his appearing amen amen I want to be ready to go you know with with my grandmother and I you know um she's got I didn't mention at the beginning of service I don't think but she's got RSV she's got that respiratory virus now so she's been doing much better with her impacted bowel and whatnot or obstructive bow so that seems to be sort of resolving itself but now she's got RSV and and so um you know we're just trusting that the Lord will will work in that but uh where was I going with that I said I was going to say that for a reason but anyways I want to show you just this one last quote amen now I want to show you what this looks like and because we show what what the lion anointing looks like as they were going into Canaan and we want to show what it looks like when the lion reads from the open book from the book that's been unsealed because we've seen him Roar we've seen them more not just heard them but we've seen what that looks like amen and you know it struck me as I was studying this because we've got at work we have what we call living documents and a living document is a document that's not locked so you can come in and you can add to it and you can take away from it it's a living document you can adjust it so I have for my performance every year my performance review at the beginning of year I say this is what I'm going to do and if I do it then I get a good performance review but it's a living document I can change my mind throughout the year with my director's approval as to what I'm trying to achieve throughout the year so it's a living document so I can change the standard by which I'm judged now we've got another living document but this is not that kind of a living document because it's sealed he can't add to it and he can't take away from it amen but it's living why because there's power behind it there's a life behind it that's what makes it living and it comes with power it comes with authority it comes with peace comes with rest comes with love comes with joy comes with Mercy forgiveness all these things that is the life that we're looking for amen it's not just words on a page and so when we have a lion that's roaring out of this book it's supposed to have an impact there's supposed to be a life that comes with it amen they're supposed to be Victory they're supposed to come power and authority and deliverance and and these different things it's all supposed to happen when he Roars because it's supposed to bring an effect God doesn't speak without purpose amen and so what it's not just to have things happen in this Earth but it's to happen in people just like you and just like me that's what we're looking for is a living document inside of us that has what the effect that this word says it's supposed to have amen brother brother Brown says God never changes what had that to do us if you can truly believe it this morning God never changes what he did for others he'll do for you amen amen amen we're going to close with just this this it's it's a long quote but just stick with me man this is the lion roaring brother Brown's preaching he's at the end of a service he says I wonder if that Minister's sitting there the elder brother that's been preaching for 65 years would do me a favor I wonder how old that guy was preaching for 65 years he says will you do it sir lay your hand on that woman sitting next to you and the Heart trouble will leave her all right that's it do you believe it sister all right that's all what did she touch I've never seen her but it happened if thou can't believe he says do you believe now does that identify him are your eyes open then look at him he is wonderful the mighty conqueror there is nothing no Creed no denomination no scientist or nothing can stop him he is God Amen when we say what praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord but this was back in 1964. God hasn't provided land is he a god of History Church God never changes I challenge any person in here to believe it that he is present now how many ever seen that picture of the Angel of the Lord on the paper that they got in Washington he is standing right here at this platform right now right he says I know it's here I know it I'm not a fanatic I'm far from it I'm telling you the scriptural truth what's the scriptural truth he has come down you believe it and see what happens he says here here it is again there's a man a colored man sitting there looking at you kind of overjoyed by it do you believe me to be God's servant sir you do that woman touched you just like they did say be of good cheer he says it's not me calling you but he is calling you what is it it's the lion roaring if you believe that with all your heart that sugar diabetes will leave you do you believe it amen all right then you can have it amen praise the Lord that's it what did he touch he never touched me he touched him here sits a young boy a white boy sitting here looking at me a deep desire in his heart I never knew you but you're seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost right you do you believe it believe you will receive it do you believe it young man all right you can receive it if you'll believe it here's a little woman back here She's suffering it's her left arm she's had it broke it's got a knot in it the left arm in her right arm she's gotten to write Us in rheumatism she's going to miss it watch the lion roars he always speaks a name Mrs council do you believe with all your heart you believe God will make your healed Jesus Christ makes you well he says I've never seen the woman or heard of her in my life Jehovah knows that to be true amen what's he doing Church brother branham's not doing anything the lion is roaring he's reading out of redemption's book and he says Mrs Council your Redemptive right is being read out this evening you can have it if you'll believe it you can have it if you'll accept it you can have it Mrs Council and he says what Jehovah knows that to be true I don't know you why because somebody else is speaking here's a little color lady sitting here She's suffering with complications many things one thing you got trouble with your eyes not because you're wearing glasses but your eyes are going bad anyhow I love how he answers the skeptic right there doesn't he well brother Brown you can see she's wearing glasses of course she has eye trouble he says no you're getting you have eye trouble because they're getting worse despite the glasses you have arthritis if that's right wave your hand you have pains in your chest that right wave your hand you have a stomach trouble that's right wave your hand she has a lot of troubles there's no hindrance that's going to stop him Church do you believe he'll make you well do you believe God can tell me who you are Edna Gerald what's he doing reading out of the book of redemption if you believe it with all your heart believe it and you can have your healing amen do you believe he is the same yesterday today and forever what about this woman sitting here on the end the second row here looking right at me she's got trouble with her feet do you believe that God will heal your feet if you do raise up your hand I don't know or never seen her what about that lady sitting next to her look this away sister do you believe me to be God's servant with all your heart you have neuritis that you're bothered with if that's right wave your hand now you can be healed the lady sitting next to her do you believe with all your heart you're suffering too do you believe God can tell me what your trouble kidney trouble if that's right wave your hand lady sitting next to her do you believe you suffer with a nervous trouble and with your eyes if that's right wave your hand lady sitting next to her do you believe sister you are shadowed you've got stomach trouble it's cancer in the stomach do you believe God healed you amen do you believe can your eyes come open and believe that he is the Son of God then if you do stand on your feet and accept him and believe it with all your heart that he is the same yesterday today and forever he said oh Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me let's stand together if we would amen we were speaking on Redemption and we're going to be speaking on it a while but I wanted to start with this because when we start talking about the the abstract title deed and we start talking about property rights and we start talking about what God has given for you so often our tendency is to look to ourselves and say I'm unworthy I'm unable I'm I'm not strong enough I'm too weak I fall I fail I've tried I've tried it's never worked why so often it's because we're looking at ourselves but I want you to start with the lion anointing the line of 19 is not on you the line anointing is on him amen and you've got to trust that he's going to do what he said Remember When Naomi and Ruth were talking after Ruth came back from meeting with Boaz at the threshing floor and Naomi assured her she says he will not rest he will not rest until he's got you until he's done everything that he said he would do scripture talks about dohitary and he will Terry wait rest Trust don't get worried don't get frustrated don't get all up in arms because he's not doing it in your time just know that he's got it all in control he's got a time appointed for every single one of these things amen and whether it's children out in the world whether it's your personal health whether it's family relationships whether it's finances whether it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that you need in your life God has a time and a place for it and if your name is in that book He's not going to rest until he's finished what he said he was going to do amen it's his work you're the benefactor stop trying to make it happen and just say Lord I'm depending on you I'm trusting on you you stay in the right atmosphere you stay with the right friends stay with the right Fellowship stay under the hearing of the word you do what he's asked you to do and then he takes care of the rest that's all he has to do the final stage of Ruth was not possession it was rest and then she went into relationship and that's where everything happened rest led to relationship and that's when she was able to get everything she had all he wants is you he wants that relationship restored and when he gets that everything else follows him behind it amen he's moving he's moving but he's got a plan and we don't always understand it we don't always see it but he has a plan he's moving with purpose when the lion moves he doesn't Rush until he has to rush he'll move so slowly so calmly but when he moves into action they say it's the he's the fastest accelerating animal on the earth faster than a cheetah for the first three strides he's got all the power there and that's his that's his weapon is that he can go from nothing to everything in one moment he can go from Stand still to 30 miles an hour in three steps that's how quick the line is That's The Power of the Lion but you don't think it sometimes because he walks so calmly and coolly so collected so Majestic but when he moves look out that's what that's how he catches the animals they don't think he can get to them that fast listen he can get into your situation faster make your head spin how fast God can step in but it's in his time that's the thing we just got to trust it's in his time amen let's bow our heads each one Heavenly Father Barbara so thankful that we have a place of rest this morning and Lord maybe we're not resting like we could Lord maybe we're a little frazzled maybe we're a little worn out a little weary from the battle or maybe it's been the kids maybe it's been the spouse maybe it's been the job Lord maybe it's just been a little bit cold in our life and our relationship with you Heavenly Father Lord Satan wants nothing better than to get us looking at ourselves but Lord we want to look to the mighty king Lord the great lion Lord the one that has made the promise Lord The Living Word that is amongst us heavenly father and Lord we want to say we're depending on you this morning Lord we're trusting you we're believing you Lord we're looking to you and Lord all we're going to do is we're going to stay in the word then we're going to confess your word and we're going to trust the leading of your Holy Spirit In Our Lives Lord God so Lord As we sing now Lord as we worship as we bless your name as We Praise You Lord may you just put a calmness and a rest in our lives Heavenly Father Lord may you put a spirit of expectation in our hearts Lord for the things we prayed about Lord maybe for years Lord maybe for a decade or more we've prayed and we prayed and we prayed and nothing seems to move but Lord is that Mighty lion walks amongst us Heavenly fathers that Holy Spirit Lord is brooding yet over the Earth we pray that you would send it out Heavenly Father Lord into our lives into our situations Lord may you give us Revival in our hearts Lord in our personal relationship with you Lord man light a fire of those around us Heavenly Father may it go out to seek the Lost Lord God your Prophet said if God ever gives you anything you want to share it with somebody else Lord make us shares of the word endures also we pray Lord Jesus Lord just have your way now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen we've been singing it a lot but I want to sing that song that they sung in Revelation 5 they said Worthy is the Lamb can we sing that song I don't know the number thank you for the cross Lord thank you for the price you pay bearing all my sin and shame

let's sing when Jesus comes 253. foreign [Music] we sing this and we we see a man blind the light he could not see your instructor his brother John was preaching he said sometimes we need our eyes opened it's not that our eyes haven't been opened but we need our eyes opened to yet another area of Our Lives to another situation to another weakness another shortcoming and we don't realize it this is what we do when we sit under the preaching of the word his eyes are supposed to come open and then we're supposed to see ourselves as he sees us amen sometimes we get to this place where we're sitting there and we're just what saying how long is this going to go on how long is this going to go on how long oh Lord but when he comes you'll know when he comes you'll know when he does the work you're going to know because it'll be complete because he doesn't do a halfway job amen so I don't know where you're at this morning I don't know what you're dealing with and don't sit here and sing
