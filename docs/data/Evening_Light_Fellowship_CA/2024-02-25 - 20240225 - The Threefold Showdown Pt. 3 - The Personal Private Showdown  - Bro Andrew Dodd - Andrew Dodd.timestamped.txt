[56:13] this morning so we're going to ask
[56:15] brother Josh and sister Michelle and
[56:17] sister hope and brother Caleb and sister
[56:20] Elise and brother Gus if they'd all come
[56:22] up to the platform and we'll do the baby
[56:24] dedication morning let's sing that song
[56:25] bring them in bring them
[56:27] in amen as they come up this morning
[56:33] [Music]
[56:38] amen just the
[56:42] course bring them in bring them
[56:48] in bring them in from the field of sin
[56:55] bring them
[56:57] in bring them in bring the wondering
[57:04] ones to
[57:07] Jesus bring them in bring them
[57:13] in bring them in from the fields of
[57:19] sin bring them
[57:22] in bring them
[57:26] in bring the wondering ones to
[57:31] [Music]
[57:32] Jesus amen it's baptisms and deed baby
[57:35] dedications are always the the most
[57:37] wonderful times for a pastor so it's
[57:39] good to finally meet little anniah
[57:42] Elizabeth Columbo amen God bless brother
[57:45] Josh and sister Michelle and I had to
[57:47] look up the meanings of course and anah
[57:49] means god answers and Elizabeth means
[57:53] God's promise or oath of God so we've
[57:56] got a baby that's dedicated to the to
[57:58] the premise that when you ask God will
[58:00] answer and when God makes a promise
[58:03] he'll fulfill it amen and in Isaiah
[58:05] 65:24 it says and it shall come to pass
[58:08] that before they call I will answer and
[58:12] while they are yet speaking I will hear
[58:15] and it seems so often the greatest
[58:16] challenge for us is to get to the place
[58:18] where we can ask for the will of God and
[58:20] you'll find when you ask the will of God
[58:22] the answer is already there the way is
[58:24] already made there's already a
[58:25] preparation and he can send it even
[58:27] while you're asking because you've
[58:28] stepped into the channel of God Amen and
[58:31] I believe this is a daughter of God
[58:32] that's going to step into that channel
[58:34] amen that she'll seek out to the Lord
[58:36] and she'll find his will for her life
[58:38] and she'll be someone that can serve him
[58:39] Faithfully Amen brother brandham says
[58:42] that we must believe him and as we
[58:44] believe we must act on our confession we
[58:47] can't say it conscientiously unless we
[58:49] really believe it and then if we really
[58:51] believe it then we can say it with all
[58:53] of our hearts and know that our God
[58:55] answers our prayer and gives us the
[58:58] desire of our hearts he says let's
[59:00] remember while we're obeying the spirit
[59:02] one great lesson that we want to learn
[59:05] is never be Hasty see take your time and
[59:08] have faith if we have asked God anything
[59:11] remember God answers prayer he does it
[59:14] in his time the way it's best and makes
[59:17] it work just right for us that's from
[59:19] the adoption message number three
[59:21] Elizabeth means the oath of God or God's
[59:24] oath and in Hebrews 6:13 it says for
[59:26] when God made promise to Abraham because
[59:29] he could swear by no greater he swear by
[59:32] himself in other words he put himself on
[59:34] the line he put his reputation he put
[59:36] his witness he became the guarant of his
[59:38] own oath his own promise amen and in
[59:41] verse 14 it says saying surely blessing
[59:43] I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will
[59:46] multiply thee and so after he had
[59:49] patiently endured he obtained the
[59:51] promise he said when God makes a promise
[59:54] to you he will fulfill it you don't have
[59:57] to be afraid that he will not keep his
[59:58] word for God will keep his word that's
[1:00:01] true he says You must you just must
[1:00:05] trust him amen what a what a name to
[1:00:08] give a daughter of God is that God
[1:00:09] answers and God makes a promise and that
[1:00:12] means he's going to keep it amen and
[1:00:14] we're in the season of the the greatest
[1:00:17] experience the greatest manifestation
[1:00:19] that the children of God will have and
[1:00:20] that's a resurrection and a Rapture amen
[1:00:23] and I believe that we're in the season
[1:00:24] of a Rapture and we've got a a young
[1:00:26] woman here a baby that's dedicated the
[1:00:28] idea that God's made a promise he's made
[1:00:31] an oath and it has nothing to do with us
[1:00:33] that's the beauty of this one he didn't
[1:00:34] swear by our performance or by our
[1:00:36] dedication or our commitment or our
[1:00:38] sanctification he says I'll do it
[1:00:40] because I've said I'm going to do it and
[1:00:42] I've committed myself to do it amen amen
[1:00:45] so we pray that God would use brother
[1:00:46] Josh and sister relle that because
[1:00:49] here's the thing how do you learn that
[1:00:51] God Answers by seeing God answer by
[1:00:54] seeing your parents go to God and pray
[1:00:57] and having a family Altar and and
[1:00:59] bringing needs before God and that's
[1:01:00] where they see a reality of God is Not
[1:01:03] Just in church it's in the it's around
[1:01:05] the family table it's around the family
[1:01:06] altar when they put things before God
[1:01:09] and he comes and he makes it real and he
[1:01:10] answers prayer according to the needs of
[1:01:12] the faithful amen so it's this is a
[1:01:15] dedication as much of brother Josh and
[1:01:17] sister relle as God has given them this
[1:01:19] wonderful gift amen just like brother
[1:01:22] Andrew was talking yesterday that that
[1:01:24] God gave Jesus Mary and Joseph to
[1:01:28] flawed individuals and brother Josh is
[1:01:31] wonderful as you are you're flawed
[1:01:33] sister relle you're flawed but you are
[1:01:35] made perfectly exactly For What Little
[1:01:38] anah needs to raise her in the
[1:01:40] admonition and nurture the Lord amen
[1:01:42] we're all flawed we're all failures but
[1:01:44] yet God uses those flawed and failure
[1:01:46] ones so men so is it okay if I hold her
[1:01:49] all right I'm going to hold her and
[1:01:51] we're going to have the the parents come
[1:01:52] in and then the the grandparents would

[1:02:25] brother Josh and sister relle Lord that
[1:02:27] they're going to raise her under the
[1:02:29] atmosphere and the umbrella of the Holy
[1:02:31] Spirit Lord that your word will have the

[1:02:35] pray your presence in their home Lord we
[1:02:37] pray your presence in their lives we
[1:02:39] pray that your presence would be in
[1:02:40] their very bodies and souls Lord God
[1:02:43] that she would see the reality of a God
[1:02:45] that answers that a God that makes a
[1:02:47] promise will always fulfill it Lord God

[1:12:25] if you turn with me there Hebrews
[1:12:28] chapter
[1:12:30] 12 after the service last night one of
[1:12:32] your deacons told me I need to get rid
[1:12:34] of that timer on my
[1:12:36] phone and then your pastor indirectly
[1:12:39] rebuked me in the car I saiding you
[1:12:41] should not time a service he was telling
[1:12:43] that to one of his sons he didn't know
[1:12:45] he was talking to me so I'm not going to
[1:12:47] time myself this morning so if I go long
[1:12:50] blame
[1:12:52] them but here here we are in Hebrews
[1:12:54] chap
[1:12:55] 12 amen we're going to continue on in
[1:12:57] The three-fold Showdown this would be
[1:12:59] part three but we're going to call this
[1:13:02] as a subtitle the personal private
[1:13:05] Showdown Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 12
[1:13:09] says wherefore lift up the hands which
[1:13:11] hang down and the feeble knees and make
[1:13:14] straight paths for your feet lest that
[1:13:17] which is lame be turned out of the way
[1:13:20] but let it rather be healed follow peace
[1:13:23] with all man and Holiness without which
[1:13:25] no man shall see the Lord looking
[1:13:29] diligently lest any man fail of the
[1:13:31] grace of God lest any root of bitterness
[1:13:34] bringing up trouble you and thereby many
[1:13:37] be defiled oh my lest there be any
[1:13:40] fornicator or profane person as Esau who
[1:13:44] for one morsel of meat sold his
[1:13:48] Birthright love the way the scripture
[1:13:50] gives us examples and we we look at
[1:13:52] profane people while they're out there
[1:13:54] cursing and sing and doing all these
[1:13:56] things he says no lest as Esau who just
[1:13:59] didn't honor the word of God the way he
[1:14:02] ought to have didn't honor the
[1:14:03] birthright that God had given him and
[1:14:05] for one morsel of bread sold it
[1:14:08] off and he it goes on to say for he know
[1:14:12] he know for you know how that afterwards
[1:14:15] when he would have inherited the
[1:14:17] blessing he was rejected for he found no
[1:14:21] place of repentance though he saw it
[1:14:23] carefully with tears for you are not
[1:14:26] come to the mount that might be touched
[1:14:29] and that burned with fire nor unto
[1:14:31] Blackness and darkness and Tempest and
[1:14:34] the sound of a trumpet and the voice of
[1:14:36] Words which voice they had heard T
[1:14:39] entreated that the word should not be
[1:14:42] spoken to them anymore for they could
[1:14:46] not endure that which was commanded and
[1:14:48] if so and if so much as a beast touched
[1:14:52] the mountain it shall be stoned or
[1:14:55] thrust through with a dart oh so
[1:14:57] terrible was the sight that Moses said I
[1:15:01] exceedingly fear and Quake but you are
[1:15:04] come unto Mount Zion and unto the city
[1:15:08] of the Living God and Heavenly Jerusalem
[1:15:11] and to an innumerable company of angels
[1:15:15] and to the general assembly of the
[1:15:16] church and Church of the firstborn which
[1:15:20] are written in heaven and to God the of
[1:15:23] all and to the spirits of just men made
[1:15:27] perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the
[1:15:29] New Covenant and to the blood of
[1:15:31] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[1:15:33] than that of Abel see that you refuse
[1:15:36] not him that speaketh for if they
[1:15:38] escaped not who refused him that
[1:15:41] speaketh on Earth much more shall not we
[1:15:44] escape if we turn away from him that
[1:15:46] speaketh from Heaven whose voice then
[1:15:49] shook the Earth but now he hath promised
[1:15:51] saying yet once once more I shake not
[1:15:54] the Earth only but also heaven and this
[1:15:58] word yet once more signifieth the
[1:16:00] removing of those things that can be
[1:16:03] shaken as of things that are made and
[1:16:05] those things which cannot be shaken May
[1:16:08] remain wherefor we have received a
[1:16:11] kingdom which cannot be moved Hallelujah
[1:16:15] let us have Grace whereby we may serve
[1:16:18] God
[1:16:19] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[1:16:23] for our God is a consuming fire amen may
[1:16:27] the Lord is Blessing to the word you may
[1:16:29] have the comfort of your
[1:16:31] seats
[1:16:33] amen
[1:16:35] amen I was really amazed when I got here
[1:16:37] originally at the fortuity of the the
[1:16:41] officers of the church here and how they
[1:16:43] patted the pews in the
[1:16:46] middle God bless you you don't end up
[1:16:49] with people sitting way out there and
[1:16:51] way out there because they're not patted
[1:16:54] but God bless you for sitting it makes a
[1:16:56] difference when We Gather our licks of
[1:16:58] fire together and we gather them into a
[1:17:01] place and we're able to create a larger
[1:17:04] flame and allow the Lord to work in our
[1:17:06] midst
[1:17:08] amen amen and I just want to take this
[1:17:10] scripture and and and really I'll just
[1:17:12] maybe start by reading a quote from the
[1:17:13] end time seed sign brother bam says I
[1:17:17] believe that these La these latterday
[1:17:19] signs and things that's happening every
[1:17:22] one of them is peeling together to show
[1:17:25] that Christ is ready to come for his
[1:17:28] bride this is in
[1:17:30] 1962 in March of 1962 he's speaking this
[1:17:34] saying all of these things are already
[1:17:36] coming together to show Christ is ready
[1:17:39] to come for his bride as God in his word
[1:17:43] made manifest in a man a perfect man
[1:17:45] Jesus Christ so is God and His word
[1:17:49] coming again to make himself manifest in
[1:17:52] a bride
[1:17:54] not not not that they will do like Eve
[1:17:56] did and high bread it with anything else
[1:17:59] but the unadulterated word of God will
[1:18:01] be born into the church and she will
[1:18:05] stand like Jesus Christ did with his
[1:18:08] Spirit anointed in his word amen I
[1:18:12] believe it's an announcement right now
[1:18:15] amen that he was announcing it there in
[1:18:17] 1962 and we know what happened as you go
[1:18:19] down in
[1:18:20] 1963 the the seals were opening the the
[1:18:24] the angel of God came down and with a an
[1:18:26] open book in hand and was able to give
[1:18:28] to the the the prophet brother brandom
[1:18:31] when he said I would have come and
[1:18:32] preached the seals and I would have got
[1:18:33] it all mixed up he would have preached
[1:18:35] it all wrong but the Holy Spirit the
[1:18:37] Lord Jesus Christ came in the room we
[1:18:39] know the angel of the Lord came out of
[1:18:41] the lust and begin to speak to him and
[1:18:43] tell him exactly what each seal was the
[1:18:46] day that he was going to preach it when
[1:18:48] he was preaching the first seal he
[1:18:50] didn't know what the second seal was it
[1:18:52] was the pure P unadulterated word of God
[1:18:54] that God was opening the book to him of
[1:18:57] what it was all about and the Redemption
[1:19:00] that that was there in the book and it
[1:19:01] was John that when it was written in the
[1:19:03] Book of Revelations that John wept
[1:19:05] because no man was able to open the book
[1:19:08] and to loose the seals thereof not even
[1:19:11] anyone was able to look thereon but he
[1:19:13] said weep not John for the line of the
[1:19:15] tribe of Judah has prevailed amen and he
[1:19:17] turned and he saw a lamb as though it
[1:19:19] had been slain that had prevailed and he
[1:19:22] came forth and he took the book out of
[1:19:24] the right hand of him that SATs on the
[1:19:25] throne I know this isn't anything new to
[1:19:27] you but I want to just refresh your
[1:19:29] memory as we get going this morning and
[1:19:31] as as as he took the book out of the
[1:19:33] right hand of him who sat upon the
[1:19:34] throne he took the book and he was able
[1:19:36] to loose the seals because he had
[1:19:39] overcome amen and that he he had shed
[1:19:41] his blood so that we would be able to
[1:19:44] see our names on the book of redemption
[1:19:47] amen that was what he was loosing that
[1:19:49] is what he was opening he wasn't just
[1:19:51] opening more knowledge and and more
[1:19:54] things for us to know and to understand
[1:19:56] but he was opening so you could see your
[1:19:59] name on the Lamb's Book of Life and you
[1:20:01] can realize I cannot be lost because he
[1:20:04] wrote my name on the L book of life
[1:20:07] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:20:10] we know the scripture says that that he
[1:20:11] wrote it way back then before I ever did
[1:20:13] a sin he knew that I would come to the
[1:20:16] knowledge of the truth he knew that I
[1:20:18] would receive the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:20:21] he knew that I would repent of my sins
[1:20:23] he knew that I would be baptized in
[1:20:25] correct water baptism he knew that I
[1:20:27] would come to a place of adoption before
[1:20:30] I ever knew what adoption
[1:20:32] was oh Hallelujah because he knows all
[1:20:35] things and he's able to predestinate and
[1:20:37] he predestinated us Ephesians chapter 1
[1:20:39] says unto the adoption of sons he
[1:20:42] predestined us to a purpose so we would
[1:20:44] come to a place of maturity as he did so
[1:20:48] that way he could be the firstborn among
[1:20:50] many Brethren amen Hallelujah this now
[1:20:54] as we look at it it says you are come
[1:20:56] unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the
[1:20:58] Living God this is the final showdown as
[1:21:01] brother bam says and pick up your pen
[1:21:03] and write as we've quoted Friday and
[1:21:04] quoted on Saturday where he said there's
[1:21:06] three showdowns Mount Carmel Mount
[1:21:08] Transfiguration and he says there's a
[1:21:09] Rapture Showdown which is Mount Zion and
[1:21:12] he says this showdown is the rapture but
[1:21:15] again it is God proving who he is in
[1:21:18] this
[1:21:19] dispensation because God in each and
[1:21:21] every dispensation he proved that he was
[1:21:23] God when he was under the dispensation
[1:21:25] of fatherhood he proved that he was a
[1:21:27] son when he was under the dispensation
[1:21:29] of Jesus Christ but now he's proving who
[1:21:32] he is in our day today by the form of a
[1:21:35] showdown again and the finality of that
[1:21:37] Showdown will be a body
[1:21:41] change
[1:21:43] Hallelujah but you know that you are
[1:21:45] coming to Mount Zion and a showdown amen
[1:21:48] is proving who he is and he begins the
[1:21:51] whole process then by justif ification
[1:21:53] where he talks about in here in Hebrews
[1:21:55] chap 11 he doesn't just start in verse
[1:21:58] 22 where it says you're come under Mount
[1:22:00] Zion but he starts way back in verse 12
[1:22:02] where he says lift up the hands which
[1:22:04] hung down and the feeble knees why would
[1:22:07] hands hang down why would you have
[1:22:08] feeble knees why would it be this way
[1:22:10] because we're Sinners we're unworthy
[1:22:12] we're not able we we were hopeless in
[1:22:15] and of ourselves but he says there's
[1:22:17] something I've given you a power to defy
[1:22:20] gravitation to worship me by lifting up
[1:22:23] your hands there's something I've given
[1:22:25] you in order to stand in the presence of
[1:22:27] God when before in the presence of God
[1:22:29] you would fall on your face and be
[1:22:31] unable but he says I've given you by my
[1:22:33] blood boldness to enter into my
[1:22:37] throne and he'd even go on beyond that
[1:22:40] and he say lift up those hands you have
[1:22:42] life within you and he says make
[1:22:43] straight the pathways that the lame be
[1:22:46] not turned out but rather that there is
[1:22:49] healing in the body of Jesus Christ amen
[1:22:52] make straight Pathways amen don't make
[1:22:55] your Doctrine all over the place that
[1:22:57] the lame can't follow you and you can't
[1:23:00] understand what we're talking about but
[1:23:01] rather lay a straight pathway lay
[1:23:04] something that leads directly to the
[1:23:06] Lord Jesus Christ something that they
[1:23:08] could be healed amen there's a healing
[1:23:11] power in the church as James chap 5:15
[1:23:14] would say and the power of PR the prayer
[1:23:16] of faith shall save the sick and the
[1:23:20] Lord shall raise him up amen I love
[1:23:22] those words it doesn't say he will or he
[1:23:25] might or he one day but he says he shall
[1:23:28] when there's the word s h l it means
[1:23:30] that there it is a definite it is a
[1:23:32] shity it will happen it must happen
[1:23:35] because it shall come to pass Hallelujah
[1:23:39] and he says the Lord shall raise him up
[1:23:41] and if they have committed sins they
[1:23:44] shall be forgiven him oh praise be to
[1:23:48] God hallelujah why the prayer of faith
[1:23:51] shall save the the sick and if they've
[1:23:54] committed any sins they shall be
[1:23:56] forgiven them it says in the next verse
[1:23:58] and confess your faults one to another
[1:24:00] and pray for one another that you may be
[1:24:06] healed for the effectual fervent prayer
[1:24:11] of a righteous man that word effectual
[1:24:13] fervent that means you can enter in to
[1:24:15] the sufferings of another the effectual
[1:24:18] fervent prayer of a righteous man aileth
[1:24:23] much Hallelujah in then that believe as
[1:24:26] Mark 16 would say if they would lay
[1:24:28] their hands on the sick they shall
[1:24:31] recover say well it's just for the
[1:24:33] ministry it's not just for the ministry
[1:24:35] it's not just for the deacons it's not
[1:24:36] just for the trustees but anyone that
[1:24:39] would believe if you lay your hands
[1:24:41] right on the person next to you this
[1:24:43] morning they shall recover whatever
[1:24:45] sickness they may have you say they
[1:24:46] don't look sick next to me that's why we
[1:24:48] shake hands with one another and say God
[1:24:50] bless you oh hallelujah what kind of a
[1:24:53] blessing are you given on them if you
[1:24:55] believe you're pronouncing God's healing
[1:24:57] upon them just by shaking somebody's
[1:24:59] hand this morning and saying God bless
[1:25:02] you oh praise be to
[1:25:05] God sometimes we take things too
[1:25:09] lightly we take things as just p and
[1:25:12] just well we just shook hands and well I
[1:25:14] just greeted him and if I have to no you
[1:25:17] are a projection of the love of
[1:25:20] God and then is the rising of the sun
[1:25:23] brother Brandon would say and he being
[1:25:25] the groom and the bride has to come
[1:25:29] forth cuz it's a part of him I want to
[1:25:32] go back for a minute and say that first
[1:25:33] Showdown was proving that God is God and
[1:25:37] the second Showdown is proving that
[1:25:39] Jesus Christ is God but this search
[1:25:41] Showdown it's showing who God is today
[1:25:43] in other words it's proving that she is
[1:25:46] him there's three showdowns God is God
[1:25:49] Jesus Is God and she is him
[1:25:54] as he even says it in the in the the
[1:25:55] rising of the sun he said he being the
[1:25:57] groom the bride has to come forth cuz
[1:26:00] it's a part of him and it can only be
[1:26:02] the manifestation of the fulfilling of
[1:26:05] all the revelations any others has spoke
[1:26:08] of the
[1:26:10] Bride Hallelujah the bride of Christ in
[1:26:13] our day you and I we are the
[1:26:16] manifestation of every Revelation in the
[1:26:19] Bible in every age that has ever gone
[1:26:21] forth for the man would the the the the
[1:26:23] the the the the the reward for each age
[1:26:25] the reward that was given to the
[1:26:26] Ephesians age in Revelations chapter 2
[1:26:28] the reward that was given to the next
[1:26:30] age on the way down the reward that was
[1:26:31] given to the Philadelphian age the
[1:26:33] reward that was given to Leo all of it
[1:26:35] is for you it compiles one on top of the
[1:26:39] other on top of the other it's for you
[1:26:41] amen it's not just well I'll just sit
[1:26:43] with him in his Stone no there's a stone
[1:26:45] no you're a pillar in the house of God
[1:26:47] you're all of these things you're giv
[1:26:49] white robes oh praise be to God all all
[1:26:52] of the revelation of the Bride down
[1:26:54] through seven Church ages all through
[1:26:56] the Scripture it pertains to
[1:26:59] you Hallelujah and it can only manifest
[1:27:03] if it does some if if it does something
[1:27:05] he says it can only manifest it can only
[1:27:08] manifest it doesn't sit there dormant it
[1:27:11] has to bring forth we started out in
[1:27:13] Friday he said my word will not return
[1:27:15] unto me void if it does something
[1:27:18] different than the groom then it isn't
[1:27:20] the
[1:27:21] bride
[1:27:23] it's plain and simple if it does
[1:27:26] something different than the Lord did
[1:27:27] it's not the
[1:27:28] bride Oh
[1:27:30] my he says this he says it isn't he says
[1:27:33] it isn't the bride because she is flesh
[1:27:35] of his flesh she is bone of his bone she
[1:27:37] is life of his life she is power of his
[1:27:40] power she is him as men and wom are one
[1:27:44] and women was taken from his side she
[1:27:47] was taken a she had a she had taken a
[1:27:50] spirit a feminist Spirit from him and
[1:27:53] the flesh taken from his side both
[1:27:55] mechanics and Dynamics the wife the
[1:27:58] bride in him and the Flesh in him put it
[1:28:01] all together and made mechanics and
[1:28:04] Dynamics just like it was in the
[1:28:06] beginning when he had his first Adam you
[1:28:08] could go down and read it into Genesis
[1:28:10] chapter 2 and you'd realize that sitting
[1:28:12] there he put Adam into a deep sleep and
[1:28:14] he took the rib from his side he took
[1:28:16] his wife and he formed his wife from his
[1:28:18] very side he took the feminine Spirit
[1:28:20] out of Adam and he made Eve with that
[1:28:23] and he made her a living Soul as well
[1:28:25] and he gave her and he presented her
[1:28:27] back to Adam it's the same thing that's
[1:28:29] going on again but in a spiritual realm
[1:28:33] where we had where Jesus died on the
[1:28:35] cross and it seemed that they would when
[1:28:37] they were dying on the cross that they
[1:28:38] would take a sledgehammer and they would
[1:28:40] break the legs of the individual but
[1:28:42] when they came to Jesus because the
[1:28:44] scripture said not because the Centurion
[1:28:47] had a great idea but because the
[1:28:49] scripture said not one bone in his body
[1:28:51] would be broken so they put down the
[1:28:53] sludgehammer and instead they picked up
[1:28:55] a spear and they thrust it through his
[1:28:56] side and out of his side which came
[1:28:59] blood and water separately and out of
[1:29:03] that he had already commanded his Spirit
[1:29:05] to leave him what was going on he was
[1:29:07] taking from his side the blood of Jesus
[1:29:11] Christ showing that it would be blood
[1:29:13] that it would be water it would have to
[1:29:15] be justification by the blood it would
[1:29:17] have to be sanctification by the washing
[1:29:19] of the Water by the word and it would
[1:29:21] have to be spirit that would come in and
[1:29:23] cap it but he didn't just let that flow
[1:29:25] out he commanded that he said I lay down
[1:29:28] my life I tap power to take it up again
[1:29:31] Hallelujah he has power to give you his
[1:29:36] life Hallelujah showing we are not taken
[1:29:40] just from anywhere we're taken from the
[1:29:42] very side of Jesus Christ we are flesh
[1:29:45] of his flesh we are bone of his bone we
[1:29:47] are life of his life Hallelujah
[1:29:59] it says in Ephesians 4:8 he says
[1:30:01] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[1:30:03] on high he led captivity captive and he
[1:30:06] gave gifts unto man now that he ascended
[1:30:09] what is what is it but he that also
[1:30:12] descended first into the lower parts of
[1:30:15] hell he that descended is the same that
[1:30:17] ascended up far above the heavens that
[1:30:20] he might fill all things and he gave
[1:30:22] some in other words he says this is
[1:30:25] Jesus Christ going before the Lord and
[1:30:27] making the atonement when he come down
[1:30:29] and he we know that when he died and he
[1:30:31] was laid in the grave his Spirit went
[1:30:33] down and he went down into the lowest
[1:30:35] regions of Hell brother Bram would
[1:30:37] preach wonderful Services about that how
[1:30:39] he went and he kicked open the door and
[1:30:40] he took the keys of death Hell In The
[1:30:42] Grave amen he had such power he had such
[1:30:44] anointing even there oh the purpose of
[1:30:47] God was so much greater in the Eternal
[1:30:50] Realms than it ever was just on his his
[1:30:52] his his 33 year and a half Corporal life
[1:30:55] when he was here on Earth sometimes we
[1:30:57] get so caught up what am I doing on this
[1:30:59] Earth God has a purpose for you in the
[1:31:01] eternals that is so much greater than
[1:31:04] just these 70 years and then Grace what
[1:31:07] Christ has been doing setting on high as
[1:31:09] a our high priest making intercessions
[1:31:11] on our behalf but we find he went down
[1:31:13] there at this time and he made interess
[1:31:15] and he took and he took our sins put it
[1:31:17] back upon the Devil took the keys of
[1:31:19] death hell in the grave and he came back
[1:31:21] out of the grave and he says don't touch
[1:31:23] me for I have not ascended yet to the
[1:31:26] father but he said when all of a sudden
[1:31:28] he ascended back up to the father and
[1:31:31] came back down now all of a sudden he
[1:31:32] tells Thomas put your hands here put
[1:31:35] your hands in my side why was it okay
[1:31:38] for Thomas to touch it because he said
[1:31:39] the sacrifice had now been presented and
[1:31:42] the sacrifice had now been accepted so
[1:31:45] now it's okay you can touch me because I
[1:31:48] have been accepted before God the
[1:31:50] atonement has already already been made
[1:31:53] Hallelujah the atonement for sins was
[1:31:55] accepted before God and it says and when
[1:31:57] he came back where he might fill all
[1:32:00] things in verse 11 says and he gave some
[1:32:03] Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:32:05] evangelists and some pastors and some
[1:32:08] teachers oh praise be to God we're so
[1:32:10] thankful for the gifts that he puts in
[1:32:12] the body we're thankful that we have a
[1:32:14] prophet in our day we're thankful that
[1:32:16] we had the word of God if it wasn't for
[1:32:18] that we would be like every other
[1:32:20] denomination stumbling about probing and
[1:32:22] probing and probing but because God sent
[1:32:25] the word of the Lord to a prophet and he
[1:32:27] brought it out and revealed all the
[1:32:29] Mysteries today we have something to
[1:32:30] Rejoice about we've really got something
[1:32:33] to preach about and to pull on the word
[1:32:35] and thank God
[1:32:36] for
[1:32:38] hallelujah hallelujah but in all of that
[1:32:41] he didn't just send a prophet praise God
[1:32:45] he didn't just send a prophet and said
[1:32:47] just play
[1:32:48] tapes just get in your home and just
[1:32:50] play tapes we're just going to have have
[1:32:51] a prophet here no he said I sent a five
[1:32:53] full ministry I sent you a pastor you
[1:32:56] need a good Godly Pastor that'll there
[1:32:58] be there be a Shepherd to you lead you
[1:33:01] and take you by Still Waters and take
[1:33:03] you to Green Pastures or when you need
[1:33:04] medicine he'll preach that to you he's
[1:33:06] able to come and help you fight your
[1:33:08] battles with you God gives you a
[1:33:10] wonderful Godly Pastor for your
[1:33:12] edification and he sends evangelist by
[1:33:15] your way he gives you teachers amen he
[1:33:17] gives you preachers he gives you all of
[1:33:20] his fivefold
[1:33:25] gifts Hallelujah we could go into the
[1:33:27] gifts of the holy spirit as well and
[1:33:29] talk about how he gives you that by the
[1:33:30] Holy Ghost those are gifts of the Spirit
[1:33:33] those might fall on you once and never
[1:33:36] come again those might fall on you over
[1:33:38] and over and over and over again Gifts
[1:33:40] of speaking in tongues and
[1:33:41] interpretation Gifts of Prophecy Gifts
[1:33:43] of wisdom all of these different things
[1:33:45] that there's different spiritual gifts
[1:33:47] there and and and we could go into that
[1:33:50] but really as I want to I want to just
[1:33:51] just take it in this way because God
[1:33:53] gave us five gifts of the ministry in
[1:33:56] order so that we could do what so that
[1:33:58] it could Usher us into the
[1:34:01] atonement this is the scripture that
[1:34:03] that's given right after it talks about
[1:34:06] the Jesus Christ going and making the
[1:34:08] atonement for our sins and he says and
[1:34:10] when he came back what did he do he gave
[1:34:12] us five gifts he gave us a five-fold
[1:34:15] Ministry for the perfecting of saints
[1:34:18] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:34:21] edif Ying of the body of Christ now I'm
[1:34:24] just going to be bluntly honest with you
[1:34:25] there isn't one of us that can perfect
[1:34:27] you on I can't I don't claim that I
[1:34:30] could ever perfect any one of you boy
[1:34:32] would you ever be miserable if I tried
[1:34:34] to mold you and put you into an image
[1:34:36] and just say this is what you got to be
[1:34:38] and this is what you got to be You' Say
[1:34:40] You're Just a legalist and that would be
[1:34:41] exactly right if that was the way I was
[1:34:43] trying to go about it but it ain't me
[1:34:45] it's the Lord Jesus Christ it's because
[1:34:47] he made the atonement it's not trying to
[1:34:48] get you to me or trying to get you to a
[1:34:50] pastor but we're trying to get you to
[1:34:52] Christ we're trying to get you into the
[1:34:53] atonement we're trying to get you into
[1:34:55] what he's done for you we're trying to
[1:34:56] get you to recognize and have faith in
[1:34:58] the promises of God that all of them
[1:35:01] have been given to you in the atonement
[1:35:03] and even the message for our day what
[1:35:04] did it do with the revealing of the word
[1:35:07] it brought to you and it opened it
[1:35:09] unlocked the fullness of what the
[1:35:11] atonement
[1:35:12] is hallelujah because rapturing faith
[1:35:15] lies on those tapes and the atonement
[1:35:17] was meant to bring you to a place so you
[1:35:20] could be ready for rapture
[1:35:22] it was meant to bring you to a body
[1:35:24] change that was the fullness of our
[1:35:26] adoption
[1:35:30] Hallelujah says that we be no henceforth
[1:35:32] no more children tossed to and fro and
[1:35:34] carried about with every wind of
[1:35:36] Doctrine by the slight of man and
[1:35:37] cutting craftiness whereby they laid in
[1:35:39] we to deceive but we could be speaking
[1:35:42] the truth in love that we may grow up
[1:35:45] into him in all things which is the head
[1:35:50] even Christ from whom from the head down
[1:35:55] the whole body is fitly joined together
[1:35:58] amen and compacted by that which every
[1:36:02] joint
[1:36:04] supplieth but I'm just the weakest every
[1:36:09] joint from the littlest pinky little
[1:36:12] toe all the way up to the neck that
[1:36:15] turns the
[1:36:16] head every joint
[1:36:19] supplies you ever think the pinky toe's
[1:36:21] useless just go kick a chair one day
[1:36:23] with it it's called stubbing your toe

[1:36:30] there
[1:36:33] Hallelujah from whom the whole body
[1:36:35] fitly joined together and compacted that
[1:36:36] which every joint supplieth according to
[1:36:38] the effectual working of the measure of
[1:36:40] every part making increase to the body
[1:36:43] unto the edifying of
[1:36:46] itself in
[1:36:49] love oh my
[1:36:51] we have it through the opening of the
[1:36:53] word the fullness of the token and
[1:36:55] that's what we're trying as ministers to
[1:36:57] Usher you into into God's Great Variety

[1:37:36] disturbed by the fact there's no price
[1:37:37] tags on the

[1:37:41] full by the blood of the Lamb he doesn't
[1:37:43] not offering and he's not saying that
[1:37:45] you need to pay anything for it he says
[1:37:46] just believe it's yours you can have
[1:37:50] it Hallelujah he paid in full amen and
[1:37:54] he gave you access to all of them by
[1:37:58] Revelation amen as we prayed when we
[1:38:00] started out there's a veil upon the
[1:38:02] people today as as brother God would
[1:38:03] brother Brandon would talk about in The
[1:38:05] Mighty God on Veil before us he would
[1:38:07] talk about the spiritual Veil that's
[1:38:09] over the people it's a veil of
[1:38:11] Revelation that people can't break
[1:38:13] through that Veil because they don't
[1:38:14] have a revelation of who God is they
[1:38:17] don't have a revelation of who Jesus is
[1:38:19] they don't have a revelation of who they
[1:38:20] are so they can't break through that
[1:38:22] Veil it's not once in the in the in the
[1:38:25] in Moses when he came down from Mount Si
[1:38:27] they had to put a veil of over his face
[1:38:29] because the glory of God Shone through
[1:38:32] him that was a natural Veil but then
[1:38:34] when it came in Jesus Christ he was the
[1:38:36] fullness the attribute of the fullness
[1:38:38] of God dwelled in him bodily but it was
[1:38:41] the veil of his human flesh that veiled
[1:38:44] it up and hid it from everybody else so
[1:38:46] even the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[1:38:48] they couldn't see it that was a natural
[1:38:50] flesh Veil but over this day and age the
[1:38:52] word of God is Not only veiled in your
[1:38:55] flesh there's also a spiritual Veil over
[1:38:57] the people that they cannot see it
[1:39:00] because they can look at the same word
[1:39:01] and not understand it because it is only
[1:39:04] by Revelation that you can break within
[1:39:06] that
[1:39:08] Veil oh praise be to God I trust that'll
[1:39:10] become more and more of a reality to
[1:39:15] you Hallelujah as we read as you are
[1:39:19] come you are come because Revelation in
[1:39:22] the word brother bam says in the in in
[1:39:24] in the the the the revelation of Jesus
[1:39:26] Christ he says the the revelation of the
[1:39:28] word gives you authority over the
[1:39:32] Devil Revelation of the word as we
[1:39:34] talked about last night that that the
[1:39:36] word of God will defeat the enemy
[1:39:39] anywhere any time any place under any
[1:39:41] circumstances with or without the Holy
[1:39:43] Ghost but by revelation of the word it
[1:39:46] gives you authority over the devil
[1:39:50] Hallelujah ujah oh praise be to God so
[1:39:54] I've given all things he says you he's
[1:39:56] the you are come unto Jesus the mediator
[1:39:59] of the New Covenant and the blood of
[1:40:01] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[1:40:03] than that of
[1:40:05] Abel we're come to a better Covenant
[1:40:09] Hallelujah your pastor was breaking into
[1:40:11] the anointing this morning when he was
[1:40:14] dedicating it's not based on us this
[1:40:16] Covenant it's based on
[1:40:19] him as he said in in Genesis 4:9 when
[1:40:24] God came to to cainan he said whatat
[1:40:26] hast thou done the voice of thy
[1:40:28] brother's blood crith out from me from
[1:40:30] the ground that was what the blood of
[1:40:33] Abel was speaking it was crying out how
[1:40:35] long Lord how long and thou art and he
[1:40:39] says unto Cain thou now art thou cursed
[1:40:42] from the
[1:40:45] earth so where was what was the the the
[1:40:49] the blood of Abel what did it produce
[1:40:50] prod a
[1:40:53] curse he says which hath opened her
[1:40:57] mouth to receive thy brother's blood
[1:41:02] from thy
[1:41:03] hand oh
[1:41:06] my that's what Abel's blood brought
[1:41:09] that's what that brought about was a
[1:41:11] curse but he says that's not what you're
[1:41:13] come to even though we crucified the
[1:41:17] Lord Jesus Christ his own Brethren
[1:41:20] crucified him the Romans did the deed
[1:41:23] the Gentiles we were all Parton it but
[1:41:25] we brought him to that place and Spilled
[1:41:27] his blood but he said that's not what it
[1:41:29] cries out I Sanctified the Earth by my
[1:41:33] blood I I I claimed it right there I
[1:41:36] Justified it I Sanctified it I'm ready
[1:41:39] now to come to
[1:41:42] you because you are come to the blood of
[1:41:45] Jesus Christ Hebrews 10: 19 which says
[1:41:49] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[1:41:51] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[1:41:54] Jesus by a new and a living way which he
[1:41:59] hath consecrated for us through the veil
[1:42:04] that is to say his flesh and having an
[1:42:07] high priest over the house of God let us
[1:42:10] draw near with a True Heart in full
[1:42:13] Assurance of Faith having our hearts
[1:42:15] sprinkled what is it the blood of
[1:42:17] sprinkling having our hearts sprinkled
[1:42:20] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[1:42:23] washed with pure water let us hold fast
[1:42:27] the profession of our faith without
[1:42:30] wavering for he is faithful that
[1:42:33] promised Hallelujah if you've received
[1:42:36] the blood of Jesus Christ and you've
[1:42:38] received the washing of the Water by the
[1:42:39] word hold fast the confession of your
[1:42:42] faith he will send his Spirit to Quicken
[1:42:46] you he's obligated to his word oh
[1:42:50] Hallelujah
[1:42:51] this Rapture this Rapture Showdown this
[1:42:55] is not an
[1:42:57] event hope you're with me the body
[1:43:00] change is an event you will be changed
[1:43:01] in the moment in twinkling of an eye but
[1:43:04] the Rapture is a process the Rapture is
[1:43:07] the changing of you from the inside out
[1:43:10] amen it's bringing you into Rapture
[1:43:13] condition amen and he would talk about
[1:43:16] in the message the Rapture he would say
[1:43:18] these three things we know about it in
[1:43:19] first Thessalonians chapter 4 where he'd
[1:43:22] say Comfort one another with these words
[1:43:25] why don't I just read it to you real
[1:43:26] quick cuz I like that scripture a
[1:43:31] lot he said I would not have you
[1:43:33] ignorant Brethren concerning them which
[1:43:34] are asleep that you sorrow not even as
[1:43:37] others which have no hope for if we
[1:43:39] believe that Jesus Christ died and rose
[1:43:41] again even so them also which sleep in
[1:43:44] Jesus will God bring with
[1:43:47] him oh wow then which sleep will God
[1:43:52] bring with
[1:43:55] him oh and he says I'm sorry I just read
[1:43:59] that the first time that way so it's
[1:44:01] forgive me get a little something fresh
[1:44:05] here says for this we say unto you by
[1:44:08] the word of the Lord that we which are
[1:44:10] alive and remain from the co unto the
[1:44:12] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:44:14] them which are asleep and the Lord
[1:44:16] himself tell descend from heaven with a
[1:44:18] shout with a voice of the Archangel with
[1:44:20] the trumpet of God and the dead in
[1:44:22] Christ shall rise first and we which are
[1:44:23] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:44:25] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:44:27] the Lord in the air and so we shall be
[1:44:29] with the Lord a so we shall ever be with
[1:44:32] the Lord wherefore Comfort one another
[1:44:34] with these words amen this is the
[1:44:36] process of the Rapture but he says in
[1:44:38] the message the Rapture he says these
[1:44:40] three things a shout of voice and a
[1:44:41] trumpet has to happen before Jesus
[1:44:44] appears Jesus does all three of them
[1:44:47] when he's
[1:44:48] descending he does all three them as he
[1:44:51] is coming down into his many membered
[1:44:54] bride with a shout with a voice with a
[1:44:56] trumpet and that's why we're so special
[1:44:58] about that verse when he says them which
[1:45:00] are asleep in Jesus will God bring with
[1:45:04] him that as he is descending down
[1:45:06] Hallelujah that he's coming and bringing
[1:45:08] him with him because he says he does all
[1:45:10] three as he is
[1:45:13] coming he says the first thing a shout
[1:45:15] which was then he says a shout what is
[1:45:17] it it's a message that goes first the
[1:45:19] living bread of life to bring forth a
[1:45:22] bride amen we've had the message in our
[1:45:25] day it's gone forth around the world
[1:45:26] seven times to do what to bring forth a
[1:45:29] bride amen it's God's message to call
[1:45:32] out a bride the first is a shout and
[1:45:34] then a voice and then a trump and and
[1:45:37] and the shout of the messenger getting
[1:45:39] the people ready and the second is the
[1:45:41] voice of the Resurrection the voice of
[1:45:44] the Resurrection remember he does all
[1:45:45] three as he comes down the first was the
[1:45:47] shout so in the shout when the message
[1:45:48] was going forth that was part Christ
[1:45:51] coming down that was a part of his
[1:45:54] dissension in him coming down it was his
[1:45:57] word coming as brother Bram would call
[1:45:59] it but now as he's coming down not only
[1:46:01] a shout but a voice which the voice is
[1:46:04] the voice of the Archangel that will
[1:46:06] call the dead in Christ out of the Grave
[1:46:09] because it's a part of him coming down
[1:46:13] oh hallelujah it's the same voice he
[1:46:15] says that was there in in St John 11
[1:46:18] 38-34 where you find he come down to
[1:46:20] Mary and to Martha oh praise be to God
[1:46:23] as he walked in that day to Mary and
[1:46:25] Martha and as he was as they they sent
[1:46:28] out word and they said our your your
[1:46:29] friend Lazarus he's sick please come and
[1:46:33] heal him we know the story so well but
[1:46:35] we know that Jesus he turned the other
[1:46:36] direction and he walked even
[1:46:39] further he wasn't concerned why because
[1:46:42] God had showed him this was not the way
[1:46:43] it was going to be but he told them
[1:46:45] don't worry this sickness is not unto
[1:46:47] death oh Hallelujah sometimes we get so
[1:46:51] confused in ourselves we call things
[1:46:53] dead when they're not dead Jesus said
[1:46:55] they ain't dead they're just asleep amen
[1:46:57] they've just caught on I don't know
[1:46:58] about you my mother passed away about 12
[1:47:00] years ago I'm looking forward to seeing
[1:47:03] her just any day now I was in my own
[1:47:05] office this morning on my own office I
[1:47:06] guess it was down in the guest room we
[1:47:08] were down there and I was just thinking
[1:47:10] on the Lord and I just be to weep his
[1:47:12] presence come in the room I said Lord I
[1:47:14] want to see Mama again I don't
[1:47:17] understand what that means but I want to
[1:47:18] tell you it's a reality there's a
[1:47:21] Resurrection
[1:47:23] coming some morning between 6:00 and 9
[1:47:25] it's going to happen oh praise be to God
[1:47:28] it's God himself descending down into a
[1:47:31] many membered Pride as he come down he
[1:47:33] said this sickness is not unto death and
[1:47:35] he went away and he finally said all
[1:47:37] right we're going to go down and we're
[1:47:38] going to go to Lazarus after four days
[1:47:40] and as he finally went down there the he
[1:47:42] said he sleeps and the disciples said oh
[1:47:43] that's wonderful he sleeps that does him
[1:47:45] good when you're sick sleep does a great
[1:47:47] thing and they were right but he said
[1:47:48] let me understand in your language he's
[1:47:50] not sleeping as you would call sleeping
[1:47:52] he's
[1:47:54] dead but now as he finally comes down
[1:47:56] Mary Martha Mary's there Weeping at the
[1:47:58] grave and they told him and Martha ran
[1:48:00] to Jesus said Lord if you would have
[1:48:01] been here my Lazarus would not have
[1:48:05] died but Jesus having perfect faith in
[1:48:09] the perfect God which he was was able to
[1:48:13] look at it and say what is Divine
[1:48:15] Healing but the earnest of the
[1:48:19] Resurrection
[1:48:21] don't you know that I am the
[1:48:22] resurrection and the life don't you know
[1:48:25] that if you would believe all things are
[1:48:27] possible to them that believe oh
[1:48:30] Hallelujah and he came right on down
[1:48:31] there where they where they were at and
[1:48:33] he come right to the gravide he said
[1:48:34] roll away the
[1:48:36] stone Oh by now he stinketh Lord I don't
[1:48:39] want to roll away this in my life this
[1:48:41] is too much I've hid this for years
[1:48:43] don't make me confess it don't make me
[1:48:45] confess my sins one to another but the
[1:48:47] Bible says confess your faults one to
[1:48:50] another that you be healed amen no
[1:48:52] matter how much it stinks roll away the
[1:48:54] stone let God deal with it in your life
[1:48:58] Hallelujah as he come right on down
[1:49:00] there and he said R finally they said
[1:49:02] all right Lord at Thy word and they
[1:49:03] rolled away a stone and that voice spoke
[1:49:05] up brother said if he had not said
[1:49:07] Lazarus every grave would have
[1:49:11] opened oh what a awesome God we serve
[1:49:15] why because it's the same one today what
[1:49:18] is he going to say
[1:49:23] what is he going to say as he's
[1:49:24] descending down that the graves would
[1:49:26] open he says the same voice that spoke
[1:49:29] and said Lazarus come forth he's not
[1:49:31] going to say this name and that name and
[1:49:33] this thing it'll be M Jesus Christ all
[1:49:37] them that are deaded me come
[1:49:39] forth Hallelujah if he wasn't that
[1:49:42] specific every sinner would rais and it
[1:49:44] would be a general Resurrection because
[1:49:46] that's how powerful he
[1:49:49] is
[1:49:51] oh Hallelujah but it wasn't just the
[1:49:53] voice he says that's it getting the
[1:49:55] bride together then the resurrection of
[1:49:57] the Dead Sea caught up together with him
[1:49:59] it's the trumpet now watch these three
[1:50:01] things a trumpet he says a shout a voice
[1:50:03] a trumpet the third thing is a trumpet
[1:50:05] which always the Feast of the trumpets
[1:50:07] is calling the people to a feast
[1:50:10] there'll be the bride supper
[1:50:14] hallelujah oh praise be to
[1:50:17] God there'll be a bride supper the
[1:50:20] Lamb's supper with the
[1:50:23] bride in the
[1:50:25] sky first thing that comes forth of the
[1:50:27] message calling the bride the next thing
[1:50:29] is the resurrection of the sleeping
[1:50:30] bride the the ones that have gone on
[1:50:32] back in the other ages even caught up
[1:50:34] together all down through the sleeping
[1:50:36] bride through seven Church
[1:50:39] ages not just the ones we can Name by
[1:50:41] name and those that are we we we knew
[1:50:43] personally but it'll be John Wesley and
[1:50:45] all them under his message it'll be
[1:50:47] Martin Luther and all them under his
[1:50:49] message it it will be St Columbus and
[1:50:51] all them under his message H Columba and
[1:50:53] it'll be St Martin and all them under
[1:50:55] his message it'll be irenius and all
[1:50:57] them under his message all the bride in
[1:50:59] seven Church ages St Paul and all them
[1:51:01] oh Hallelujah St Paul will raise up
[1:51:04] again St Peter will come up again John
[1:51:06] and James and Jude and all these ones
[1:51:08] will come up again walking around in
[1:51:10] Jerusalem thinking what is all these
[1:51:13] things hallelujah what a time it'll
[1:51:17] be and then the trumpet will sound
[1:51:21] and we'll go be with the Lord
[1:51:24] forever let me just say this this is not
[1:51:27] some far out
[1:51:28] Revelation this is where the bride of
[1:51:31] Christ is living at today we are right
[1:51:34] there on the precipice of
[1:51:36] time when you'll hear you'll you'll
[1:51:39] not Hallelujah you'll not hear a literal
[1:51:43] sound of a trumpet I don't believe that
[1:51:45] for a moment because it was the voice
[1:51:48] behind the voice that was the
[1:51:50] message Hallelujah it was a shout it was
[1:51:54] a spiritual shout that went out it was
[1:51:55] Revelation that went forth you'll not
[1:51:58] hear a little voice that spoke or a
[1:51:59] little burning of fire in darkness
[1:52:01] because it says you are not come unto
[1:52:04] the mountain that can be touched with
[1:52:06] hands you are not come don't look for
[1:52:08] something in these three dimensions of
[1:52:11] of light space and time where we we
[1:52:13] dwell and we see all these things and we
[1:52:15] we even contact the fourth dimension
[1:52:17] through our cellular devices and these
[1:52:18] other things and television and whatnot
[1:52:21] and we don't he says don't don't look
[1:52:22] for those things you're not come to the
[1:52:24] mountain that can be touched that was
[1:52:27] what brother BR was talking about when
[1:52:28] they said when he preached the seals and
[1:52:29] they asked questions and answers they
[1:52:31] said should we all move to
[1:52:33] Jeffersonville should should we all move
[1:52:35] because you he talked about in the in
[1:52:37] the future home and he talked about how
[1:52:39] the the the where it would be 1500 miles
[1:52:41] by 1500 miles 1500 miles of the New
[1:52:43] Jerusalem and he said it would be like
[1:52:45] from here to here and they all got all
[1:52:47] excited said we should all go get within
[1:52:49] that that
[1:52:50] range right are you with me because I
[1:52:53] thought that that that's that's got to
[1:52:55] be it but he says it's not a natural
[1:52:57] Mountain it's not something that's
[1:52:58] natural in this realm in this sinful
[1:53:01] world it's a spiritual Mountain it's a
[1:53:06] private personal
[1:53:11] Showdown that's not your
[1:53:13] Mountain but you are come to a spiritual
[1:53:17] Mountain a spiritual meeting
[1:53:21] Place brother bam says the Revelation
[1:53:23] Jesus Christ he says the lamb the high
[1:53:25] priest holding his
[1:53:30] blood
[1:53:32] Hallelujah holding his blood as an
[1:53:34] atonement on the mercy sheat for our
[1:53:36] sins is the Lord God Almighty that is
[1:53:40] his present offit that is what he is
[1:53:42] doing now pleading his blood for our
[1:53:45] sins but one day the lamb will become
[1:53:47] the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:53:50] and he will bring forth he will come
[1:53:52] forth in power and glory and take his
[1:53:54] authority to reign as king he is the
[1:53:58] coming King on this Earth of this Earth
[1:54:02] of course that does not mean that does
[1:54:04] not say that he is not a king now for he
[1:54:07] is a king he's the king of saints right
[1:54:11] now it is a spiritual Kingdom we could
[1:54:14] look at the Book of Luke where he say
[1:54:16] the kingdom of God is where within you
[1:54:21] you've come to a spiritual
[1:54:25] Kingdom you say it is not the world's
[1:54:28] systems even as you are not of the world
[1:54:31] that's the reason we act different from
[1:54:34] the world our citizenship is in
[1:54:37] heaven we reflect the spirit of the
[1:54:41] world of our rebirth where Jesus is the
[1:54:45] king Hallelujah he temperates all all of
[1:54:50] our
[1:54:51] dealings we reflect the spirit of the
[1:54:54] world of our rebirth that is why our
[1:54:56] women do not dress in men's clothing or
[1:54:59] cut their hair or use all of those
[1:55:01] cosmetics and other things that the
[1:55:02] world likes so much that is why our men
[1:55:05] don't drink and smoke and carry on in
[1:55:07] sin our Dominion is a dominion over sin
[1:55:11] it is enforced through the power that is
[1:55:14] in the spirit of Christ that indwells
[1:55:18] us
[1:55:20] Hallelujah that kingdom is in power
[1:55:23] right now in the spirit that indwells
[1:55:26] you amen every Kingdom on Earth is going
[1:55:30] to be tore down but ours will
[1:55:35] remain amen this is always oh my we can
[1:55:38] look over at Daniel I don't know if I
[1:55:40] put it in here but Daniel when he would
[1:55:42] talk about the the the the the the
[1:55:44] vision of Nebuchadnezzar that he said oh
[1:55:46] the head of gold and the shoulders and
[1:55:48] arms of bra of silver over and the the
[1:55:50] chest of brass and the legs and the feet
[1:55:53] and he said and all these things he
[1:55:54] saids but there was a rock you and out
[1:55:58] without hands that come down and it
[1:56:00] shattered that image we know what that
[1:56:02] is amen that's why today when when the
[1:56:05] world's going around all concerned about
[1:56:06] China I'm not worried about China at all
[1:56:09] becoming some kind of
[1:56:11] superpower I ain't worried about
[1:56:14] Russia why because the last Kingdom that
[1:56:17] was there was partly strong partly
[1:56:22] weak it's over the last kingdom is in
[1:56:25] power right now is paple and and and
[1:56:30] mixed with with the with with the with
[1:56:33] the image that with the image to the
[1:56:34] Beast that gives his power to the Beast
[1:56:36] it was all of these mixed in together
[1:56:38] United States of America and then Russia
[1:56:41] and and the papal Rome all giving their
[1:56:43] power to
[1:56:44] one but he says it's it's weak there's a
[1:56:47] there's a sorry I know I didn't study
[1:56:49] that out but there's there's a rock he
[1:56:51] out without hands comes down the
[1:56:54] mountain crushes that
[1:56:57] all wipes it all off the face of the
[1:56:59] Earth there is one Kingdom which will
[1:57:02] remain it's a spiritual
[1:57:07] Kingdom this has been the trouble with
[1:57:10] Pentecost even always looking for a
[1:57:13] physical
[1:57:15] manifestation trying to build a kingdom
[1:57:17] on this earth when Jesus said a wicked
[1:57:20] and an adulterous generation seeks after
[1:57:23] a
[1:57:24] sign if you can't believe the sign that
[1:57:27] has already been
[1:57:29] given
[1:57:30] today you said in each Showdown there's
[1:57:32] a pillar of fire and there's a cloud in
[1:57:35] the first Showdown it was the pillar of
[1:57:37] fire that came down and consumed the
[1:57:38] sacrifice there was a cloud about the
[1:57:39] size of the man hands in the next one
[1:57:41] there's a pillar of fire that was in
[1:57:42] Christ the attribute of the fullness of
[1:57:43] God and there was a cloud that
[1:57:44] overshadow him now in this showdown he's
[1:57:46] given us again a pillar of Fire fire and
[1:57:50] allowed his picture to be
[1:57:52] taken and he gave us a cloud and allowed
[1:57:55] its picture to be taken Hallelujah a
[1:57:58] cloud of Supernatural cloud of angels
[1:58:00] Wings B would say now the P now science
[1:58:02] has taken the picture you've seen it on
[1:58:04] the Associated Press they didn't know
[1:58:06] what it was a cloud hanging 26 mil high
[1:58:08] and 15 mil or 20 mi above even where
[1:58:11] where where vapor is they don't know
[1:58:13] what it is what's all going on they're
[1:58:15] trying under investigation he says he
[1:58:17] says but I was standing right on under
[1:58:19] it and he says and those seven angels
[1:58:22] roared out their voices of those Seven
[1:58:24] Seals standing there and the witness
[1:58:26] three of us as a witness of these things
[1:58:29] that was prophesied on the tape s what
[1:58:32] time is it and there now we are trying
[1:58:35] to find out it's a mystery to them some
[1:58:38] of them said go go why don't you go tell
[1:58:40] them it would it would just be like when
[1:58:43] the angel of the Lord appeared here in
[1:58:44] Houston Texas in the light and told the
[1:58:47] people all my life he says I've seen
[1:58:49] that like but the church knows it
[1:58:50] science knows this but they still won't
[1:58:53] believe
[1:58:55] it oh my your Showdown though it's
[1:58:59] private between you and
[1:59:01] God he gave you a supernatural witness
[1:59:05] that the world still won't believe but
[1:59:07] you believe amen but The Showdown is is
[1:59:11] right there in your
[1:59:14] heart then would talk about the vision
[1:59:16] he would have of the three puls
[1:59:18] especially the one of the Third PA he
[1:59:19] say now he says there is something
[1:59:21] different between the angel of the Lord
[1:59:23] and that light the Loos he says because
[1:59:25] I heard something moving he says when he
[1:59:27] when he when he got brought up into a
[1:59:29] high place and he be to look down he be
[1:59:31] to see them lining up like a prayer line
[1:59:32] and seeing this little room and he said
[1:59:34] then something come like a woo woo woo
[1:59:38] and like a fire whooping around licking
[1:59:41] blaze it left me and it went right down
[1:59:44] over the top of the audience and it went
[1:59:45] and stood over on top of that little
[1:59:47] building then it settled down on top of
[1:59:49] it and then when it did this one that
[1:59:52] was standing by me behind me the same
[1:59:54] voice the Angel's voice he said I'll
[1:59:57] meet you in there and that this is the
[2:00:00] third F poll and that nobody will know
[2:00:02] nothing about
[2:00:04] it oh praise God it's a personal private
[2:00:12] Showdown he said well I don't understand
[2:00:15] why in there why there he said it's not
[2:00:17] a public show this time I don't
[2:00:20] understand going into a closet like that
[2:00:22] and he said it's not is it not written
[2:00:24] of the Lord when thou prayest be not
[2:00:26] like the Hypocrites who like to be heard
[2:00:29] before man but enter into the secret
[2:00:32] closet and pray to the father who seeth
[2:00:35] in secret and he who seeth in secret
[2:00:38] shall reward thee openly what were they
[2:00:43] do in another place he talked about one
[2:00:44] went in in a Stretcher and they brought
[2:00:46] the stretcher in they laid it there and
[2:00:48] the woman that was on the stret
[2:00:49] stretcher came out carrying the
[2:00:50] stretcher and he said what happened
[2:00:51] there she said I don't know but I walked
[2:00:54] in on it I got carried in on it and I
[2:00:55] walked out with it Hallelujah another
[2:00:57] one went in the crutches and he came out
[2:00:59] carrying the crutches he said I don't
[2:01:00] know what happened but God made me
[2:01:03] completely whole what was it the
[2:01:05] fullness of the attribute of God had
[2:01:07] gone down and had overshadowed that
[2:01:09] place saying I'll meet you in there this
[2:01:11] is the third pole this is the third poll
[2:01:14] is the same thing is saying this is the
[2:01:16] seventh seal the seventh seal is Jesus
[2:01:19] Christ himself as it says in Revelation
[2:01:21] there was silence in heaven about the
[2:01:23] space of a half an hour how could there
[2:01:25] possibly be silence when the presence of
[2:01:27] God is
[2:01:29] there because they were so taken back by
[2:01:32] the fact that God had so unveiled
[2:01:34] himself to a people and so come right
[2:01:36] down and left the bull works of Heaven
[2:01:38] again and come right down into a people
[2:01:41] where he would once again be standing in
[2:01:43] the midst of his church receiving all of
[2:01:45] the Glory Hallelujah oh praise be to God
[2:01:51] it's a secret
[2:01:53] place B describes the Simplicity of it
[2:01:57] he says did you ever walk out in the
[2:01:58] morning in the real fresh cool
[2:02:01] feeling God has refreshed the Earth
[2:02:05] there's a fragrance there did you ever
[2:02:07] go into the Rose Garden down place where
[2:02:09] they got the
[2:02:10] honeysuckles the honeysuckles don't
[2:02:12] smell much In the Heat of the day but
[2:02:14] it's early in the morning when all the
[2:02:16] air has been purified when that Aroma of
[2:02:20] the honeysuckle let a man he says that's
[2:02:22] out fighting and
[2:02:23] stewing never get such of Aroma if if
[2:02:26] you'll never get much of Aroma from the
[2:02:29] that from that of the Gospel but let him
[2:02:32] get alone one time in the Stillness of
[2:02:35] God oh
[2:02:37] Hallelujah he to talk about it just like
[2:02:39] the Earth gets renewed day by day his
[2:02:42] mercies are made new every morning but
[2:02:44] it begins to talk about a way of a man
[2:02:46] you ever see a man so fussing and
[2:02:47] stewing and always trying to push P push
[2:02:49] push you don't get much of the aroma of
[2:02:51] the Gospel from that but let that same
[2:02:53] man just get alone with
[2:02:57] God every man that ever comes to the
[2:02:59] pulpit ought to dwell alone first then
[2:03:02] comes the fruits yielding forth its
[2:03:04] fruits every man that stays in the

[2:03:48] Hem of of his skirts he was walking into
[2:03:50] the inner Court talking of the high
[2:03:52] priest into the presence of God and when
[2:03:54] he went in behind there the veil fell
[2:03:56] behind him and he was shut out he was
[2:03:59] allowed to do that once a year the high
[2:04:01] priest would go in and take the blood of
[2:04:03] the Lamb he'd be Anointed with the rose
[2:04:05] of Sharon all the way from the head all

[2:04:11] pomegranates played holy holy holy unto
[2:04:13] the Lord God Almighty and as he walked
[2:04:14] in there and he opened up the veil as he

[2:05:17] hidden Mana
[2:05:20] oh praise be to God he's found a secret

[2:05:29] sheep skin and goost skins and this is
[2:05:31] made soundproof by the baptism of the
[2:05:33] Holy Ghost that hides a man in Christ
[2:05:36] and now he becomes a new creature and he
[2:05:38] walks daily before him in this manner
[2:05:41] what a beautiful picture of the believer

[2:06:10] it's a spiritual Kingdom but Paul gives
[2:06:13] us drops in these hints these little
[2:06:16] things of what exactly it is
[2:06:19] you are com into the city of the Living
[2:06:21] God Revelations 21: 1-3 says and I saw a
[2:06:24] new Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[2:06:27] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[2:06:28] away and there was no more sea and I
[2:06:30] John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem
[2:06:33] coming down from God out of Heaven
[2:06:37] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[2:06:40] husband praise be to God we can look at
[2:06:44] Galatians
[2:06:45] 4:22 says for it is written that Abra
[2:06:48] had two sons one by the bondade the
[2:06:51] other by the free woman and he who has
[2:06:53] he who was of the Bond woman was born
[2:06:55] after the Flesh and the free woman was
[2:06:57] by promise which things are an allegory
[2:06:59] that these things are two covenants one
[2:07:02] from Mount Si which gendereth to bondage
[2:07:05] which is Hagar and the other for this
[2:07:08] Hagar is of Mount Si in Arabia and anth
[2:07:11] and anth to Jerusalem which is now and
[2:07:14] is in bondage with her children but
[2:07:17] Jerusalem which is
[2:07:20] above that's the New Jerusalem that's
[2:07:23] the one that comes down from God out of
[2:07:24] Heaven he says the Jerusalem which is
[2:07:26] above is free which is the mother of us
[2:07:31] all hallelujah what was it that he took
[2:07:34] the feminist Spirit out of himself right
[2:07:38] there at Calvary he's the still the
[2:07:40] masculine but he had a bride the his
[2:07:42] feminist spirit that he brought back
[2:07:44] down onto the church that she could
[2:07:47] continually bring forth children unto
[2:07:50] the
[2:07:51] Lord oh praise be to God for it is
[2:07:54] written
[2:07:55] Rejoice thou baren that bearest not
[2:07:57] break forth and cry thou that travail us
[2:08:00] for the desolate hath many more children
[2:08:03] than that than she which hath a
[2:08:06] husband if you don't know what that's
[2:08:08] talking about just look around
[2:08:11] you there ain't a lot of people here but
[2:08:14] you can drive by denominational Church
[2:08:17] there's hundreds there's thousands they
[2:08:20] which don't have a husband they are left
[2:08:23] their first love a long time ago and yet
[2:08:26] they are garnering people after people
[2:08:28] after people after people and it seems
[2:08:31] they've got a lot but they haven't
[2:08:32] birthed one of them it's illegitimate
[2:08:38] children that's what it is but now we
[2:08:41] Brethren as Isaac are children of the
[2:08:44] promise but as then as then he which was
[2:08:48] born born after the flesh persecuted him
[2:08:50] that was born after the spirit even so
[2:08:53] it is now nevertheless what sayith the
[2:08:56] scripture cast out the Bond woman and
[2:08:58] her son for the son of the Bond woman
[2:09:00] shall not be air with the son of the
[2:09:03] free woman Hallelujah they don't have
[2:09:05] the same inheritance so then brethren we
[2:09:08] are not children of the Bond woman but
[2:09:11] of the
[2:09:13] free oh praise be to God you are come
[2:09:17] unto mount

[2:15:23] perfect oh praise be to God I'm not
[2:15:24] going to have time to get into that one
[2:15:26] properly but it says you are come into
[2:15:28] the spirits of just man made perfect in
[2:15:29] other words you are a three threep part
[2:15:32] being we recognize that right you are a
[2:15:35] soul you are a spirit and you have a
[2:15:37] flesh in your flesh you have five senses
[2:15:39] you got T see taste feel smell and hear

[2:15:51] knew I said it too fast and I got
[2:15:53] confused imagination you've still got
[2:15:56] those five senses that are there but
[2:15:58] down in your soul there's either Faith
[2:15:59] or there's doubt there either believe or
[2:16:01] you don't believe it's one way or the
[2:16:03] other that's your free moral agency that

[2:16:16] an age of sanctification not not only
[2:16:18] are we living in an age of the baptism
[2:16:19] of the Holy Ghost but you are living in
[2:16:21] an age in which God has provided a means
[2:16:23] for you to be able to come to Perfection
[2:16:26] this Perfection I believe as your
[2:16:27] pastors are speaking is not a Perfection
[2:16:29] where you would just never make a
[2:16:31] mistake but rather it is a maturity
[2:16:33] you've come to the spirits of just men
[2:16:35] made mature that not only is it a seal
[2:16:38] of the Holy Ghost upon your soul but
[2:16:40] also it begins to work out from your
[2:16:43] soul and the Holy Spirit begins to
[2:16:44] Quicken your spirit it begins to Quicken
[2:16:46] your memory
[2:16:48] oh praise be to God I might be the only
[2:16:51] one that believes this but I'm going to
[2:16:52] say it the way I believe it and your
[2:16:53] pastor can correct me if you wants but
[2:16:55] God is able to Quicken your memory so
[2:16:57] much that just as Jesus is able to
[2:16:59] forgive and
[2:17:00] forget you are able by the Holy Ghost to
[2:17:03] forgive and Let It Go Hallelujah let the
[2:17:06] blood of Jesus Christ so bury those
[2:17:08] things down in your life that it doesn't
[2:17:10] even come into your remembrance anymore
[2:17:12] let the Holy Spirit affect your memory
[2:17:14] that the former things would not even
[2:17:15] come into mind what you want were it's
[2:17:18] not who you are anymore as brother bam
[2:17:20] would say I'm not the son of Charles and

[2:17:37] Hallelujah I'm a new creature in Jesus
[2:17:39] Christ it can affect your memory and
[2:17:41] that Holy Ghost can even move out and
[2:17:43] begin to affect your your affections
[2:17:45] where it says set your affections on
[2:17:47] things about above the things that you
[2:17:48] once loved you don't love them anymore
[2:17:51] cuz the Holy Ghost is maturing your
[2:17:53] spirit it's bringing your spirit into
[2:17:56] maturity where you can have an affection
[2:17:58] for the things of God oh saints of God
[2:18:01] young people you've got a right to go
[2:18:03] before God you say Lord I spend time in
[2:18:05] these things I do these things I really
[2:18:06] enjoy them they're not sinful and I
[2:18:08] enjoy them and Lord I'm being asked to
[2:18:10] lay them down I'm asking you Lord to
[2:18:13] fill my life with a joy that is greater
[2:18:16] than what the things of the world ever
[2:18:17] brought me and I'm telling you by the
[2:18:19] blood of Jesus you can enter boldly into
[2:18:21] the presence of God and you have a right
[2:18:23] to ask him and say God if you want me to

[2:18:27] Ghost you give me a joy you give me a

[2:18:48] imagination into a perfect
[2:18:51] use Hallelujah that brother Bram would
[2:18:53] talk about the right use of imagination
[2:18:56] where he say if you are sick you just
[2:18:58] project an image before you of yourself
[2:19:01] well and then walk into that by faith
[2:19:04] that's the proper use of imagination how
[2:19:07] am I going to imagine that you got an
[2:19:08] unbelieving family you projected image
[2:19:11] of that believing family sitting with
[2:19:13] you in the Pew this morning and you walk
[2:19:15] into that by faith believing God is

[2:19:19] spouses God is going to give you those
[2:19:21] loved ones those Brothers those sisters
[2:19:23] whatever it may be you've got to bring
[2:19:25] your spirit subject to the word of God
[2:19:29] and bring about the correct use of
[2:19:32] imagination the correct use of
[2:19:34] reasonings is to take the word and
[2:19:36] compare scripture with
[2:19:38] scripture compare quote with quote
[2:19:41] instead of trying to go about and reason
[2:19:43] with it with the things of the world
[2:19:45] science has no place in the scripture
[2:19:48] the things of the world they don't have
[2:19:49] any place you can't disprove God with
[2:19:51] science the further they get in science
[2:19:52] the more they prove he's real they just
[2:19:54] can't get away from it because God
[2:19:56] created the whole
[2:19:57] thing

[2:20:21] cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom
[2:20:24] the world is crucified unto him and I
[2:20:27] unto the world for in Jesus Christ

[2:20:45] bit is the word okay this
[2:20:49] morning trust you're with
[2:20:51] me I just God laid something on my heart
[2:20:53] this morning just in such a fervency in
[2:20:55] such a way sitting there in the back
[2:20:58] office brother as you begin to sing only
[2:20:59] believe presence of God came back in
[2:21:02] again
[2:21:03] and God's got something for you this
[2:21:09] morning Jesus in Jesus Christ neither
[2:21:12] circumcision aileth anything that word
[2:21:14] aileth the Greek word for ath means to
[2:21:17] have power neither circumcision nor
[2:21:20] uncircumcision has any power in Christ
[2:21:23] that does not move God but a new
[2:21:25] creature has power with God Matthew 5:
[2:21:30] 13 and 14 says you are the salt of the
[2:21:32] earth but if the salt has lost its Savor
[2:21:35] wherewith shall it be salted it is
[2:21:37] henceforth good for nothing in other
[2:21:39] words it has no power what's the power
[2:21:41] of salt it's the Savor that it brings
[2:21:44] amen it increases the the taste of the
[2:21:46] food he says but it's lost it it's good
[2:21:48] for nothing and should but to be cast
[2:21:50] out and trotten underf foot of man ye
[2:21:53] are the light of the world a city that
[2:21:55] is set on the hill cannot be hit Mark
[2:22:00] 9:18 tells us of a scenario of a man
[2:22:03] that Jesus was there
[2:22:05] and and his disciples had gone and tried
[2:22:07] to heal this boy who would cast himself
[2:22:09] into the fire and foth and nashes with
[2:22:11] his teeth and pineth away and he would
[2:22:13] do all these things and the disciples
[2:22:15] could not cast out the devil and they
[2:22:17] brought the young boy to Jesus in markk
[2:22:19] chapter 9 and it it says that whatsoever
[2:22:22] in verse 18 says and what wheresoever he
[2:22:24] taketh him he teth him and he foth and
[2:22:26] nashes with his teeth and pineth away
[2:22:28] and I spake to thy disciples and they
[2:22:30] could not cast him out in other words
[2:22:32] they had no power over him they could
[2:22:34] not and Jesus answered him they and he
[2:22:37] answered him Jesus and saith oh
[2:22:40] faithless
[2:22:42] generation how long shall I be with you
[2:22:45] how long shall I suffer for you bring
[2:22:48] him unto
[2:22:51] me now I want to just take this and and
[2:22:54] maybe break down faith for a minute for
[2:22:56] you because it really brings a deeper
[2:22:59] understanding of what faith
[2:23:00] is and then faithless is as as Jesus
[2:23:04] would use this word here where he says
[2:23:05] oh faithless generation which is a Greek
[2:23:08] word there which is Epistles which is
[2:23:11] the adjective which is op opposite to
[2:23:14] substance faith in other words he's
[2:23:16] saying oh you generation that has a lack
[2:23:19] of substance
[2:23:22] faith and now he says in Mark 9:2 24 it
[2:23:25] says in straight way the father of the
[2:23:28] child cried out and said with tears Lord
[2:23:31] I believe help thou my
[2:23:35] unbelief now this is a couple more Greek
[2:23:38] words that I just you need to break it
[2:23:39] down this way so you understand what
[2:23:40] he's talking about because it seems like
[2:23:42] a contradiction I believe but help that
[2:23:43] I don't believe and he this word here
[2:23:46] believe is piso which is just simply to
[2:23:49] believe I
[2:23:51] believe but to help thou my unbelief
[2:23:54] unbelief is episa which is the noun
[2:23:56] opposite of substance Faith remember we
[2:24:00] said epist apistos is the adjective it
[2:24:04] means somebody that has no fa that that
[2:24:06] that he's saying you have no faith he's
[2:24:08] talking about an entire generation he's
[2:24:10] giving it an object but rather this now
[2:24:13] is the noun he says I the the the n
[2:24:17] episa as the opposite he says I believe
[2:24:20] you Lord but I don't have any substance
[2:24:24] faith I believe you I want to believe
[2:24:27] the word but I don't have any substance
[2:24:28] to really claim what the word
[2:24:31] is he says now Hebrews
[2:24:35] 11:1 now Faith is the substance of
[2:24:38] things hoped for and the evidence of
[2:24:40] Things Not
[2:24:44] Seen
[2:24:45] substance
[2:24:47] is a
[2:24:48] hypostasis that's the Greek word forgive
[2:24:50] me I don't speak Greek so if I'm saying
[2:24:51] it the wrong way forgive me I speak
[2:24:53] every language by Greek and that's Greek
[2:24:55] to
[2:24:58] me hypostasis hypostasis and he says
[2:25:02] that's the setting or the placing under
[2:25:04] a substance is Faith is a substance
[2:25:07] which in the Greek is it's the placing
[2:25:09] under or the foundation that is in
[2:25:12] actual
[2:25:13] existence the substance that all else is
[2:25:17] built
[2:25:19] upon in verse three of the same chapter
[2:25:22] it says through faith we understand that
[2:25:26] the worlds were framed by the word of
[2:25:28] God so that the things which are seen
[2:25:32] were not made by things which do
[2:25:35] appear faith is the foundation on which
[2:25:38] all else is built it's why when you look
[2:25:41] at the stature of a perfect man and you
[2:25:43] look at it what's the foundation of it
[2:25:45] faith you can't build anything else upon
[2:25:48] it without that sure Foundation of
[2:25:52] faith we know what it talks about in the
[2:25:54] beginning was the word the word was with
[2:25:57] God and the Word was God and in the
[2:25:58] beginning the word went forth from God
[2:26:01] in the form of AUST we know in Genesis
[2:26:04] 1:2 it says and the Earth was without
[2:26:06] form and void and darkness upon the face
[2:26:08] of the deep and the spirit of God moved
[2:26:11] upon the face of the water so God went
[2:26:14] out from himself in the form of the
[2:26:16] logos begin to move upon the face of the
[2:26:18] water and that would begin to speak and
[2:26:21] it would begin to bring about Hebrews
[2:26:23] 1:3 The Same Spirit In other words that
[2:26:26] is brooding over his first
[2:26:29] creation that was his natural his first
[2:26:31] Creation in the beginning God spoke but
[2:26:33] now he says Jesus Christ is the
[2:26:35] beginning of a new creation and he says
[2:26:39] now that same spirit that was brooding
[2:26:41] over that first creation is the same
[2:26:43] spirit that now Broods over the second
[2:26:46] creation The Same Spirit that was able
[2:26:48] to bring it all to pass and did not fail
[2:26:51] is the same spirit that now is making
[2:26:53] sure this creation will be made manifest
[2:26:57] with the in other words the seed which
[2:26:59] the seed is the word of God the spoken
[2:27:01] word is the Original Seed amen the the
[2:27:03] seed is the word of God that he spoke
[2:27:05] into your life and he now Broods over
[2:27:08] that seed to make sure it brings to pass
[2:27:11] that which it was meant to
[2:27:13] bring says who being Hebrews 1:3 says
[2:27:17] who being in the brightness of his glory
[2:27:19] and the express image of his person and
[2:27:23] upholding All Things by the word of his
[2:27:25] power this is the Lord Jesus Christ when
[2:27:27] we when he had by himself purged our
[2:27:30] sins sat down at the right hand of the
[2:27:33] Majesty on high says the express image
[2:27:37] of his person who being in the
[2:27:39] brightness of his glory and the express
[2:27:40] image of his person I don't know can you
[2:27:43] keep that scripture up there and go to a
[2:27:44] different scripture is that possible
[2:27:47] Hebrews chapter
[2:27:49] 3:14 I don't know if you can keep the
[2:27:51] two up there but says and for we are
[2:27:54] made partakers of Christ if we hold the
[2:27:58] beginning of our
[2:28:00] confidence steadfast unto the
[2:28:03] end Andrew where you going with all this
[2:28:06] this is why it's important to break this
[2:28:08] down this word our
[2:28:10] confidence and the person these words
[2:28:14] are the same word as substance
[2:28:18] the person of Jesus Christ in US other
[2:28:22] words the express image of his person
[2:28:25] that that Jesus Christ is the image that
[2:28:28] the whole thing was built upon it was on
[2:28:30] Jesus he's all of it all of the word of
[2:28:34] God is the Lord Jesus Christ every
[2:28:38] scripture every verse every line I'm
[2:28:39] just maybe going about a long way to say
[2:28:41] brother says if you don't see Christ in
[2:28:44] every verse of the Bible go back and
[2:28:46] read it again it's all built upon him
[2:28:48] but then he goes on to say and our
[2:28:50] confidence is the same as our substance
[2:28:52] so then if I could put it all together
[2:28:54] for you in a statement he says the
[2:28:55] person of Jesus Christ in US is our
[2:28:59] actual confidence in the Integrity the
[2:29:02] stability and reality that every word of
[2:29:06] God is the
[2:29:07] truth the person of Jesus Christ in you
[2:29:11] is the actual substance of your
[2:29:15] faith
[2:29:18] that when the man come to him and said
[2:29:20] Lord I believe he's saying but I don't
[2:29:23] have a revelation of who you are I
[2:29:26] believe you but it ain't
[2:29:29] Revelation help my
[2:29:31] Revelation help me to get a substance of
[2:29:35] the faith that I
[2:29:37] have brother Brandon would make a
[2:29:39] statement he said in a Believer is in
[2:29:41] the message perfect Faith 1963 makes a
[2:29:43] short statement here he says and a
[2:29:45] Believer is the faith of God that moves
[2:29:49] in
[2:29:51] you a Believer is the faith of God that
[2:29:55] moves in
[2:29:57] you he is the quickening
[2:30:02] power we quoted it last night if the
[2:30:05] spirit that raised up Christ from the
[2:30:07] dead dwell in you it will also Quicken
[2:30:11] your mortal
[2:30:13] bodies and he would go on and say by by
[2:30:17] the spirit that dwelleth in you and he
[2:30:18] says verse 12 therefore brethren we are
[2:30:20] debtors not to the flesh to live after
[2:30:22] the flesh but if we live after the flesh
[2:30:23] ye shall die but if ye through the
[2:30:26] spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body
[2:30:29] you shall live for as many as are led by
[2:30:32] the spirit of God they are the sons of
[2:30:38] God and that ye have not received the
[2:30:41] spirit of bondage again to fear but have
[2:30:43] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[2:30:45] we cry Abba Father the spirit itself
[2:30:49] Bears witness with our spirit that we
[2:30:51] are the children of God there's a real
[2:30:55] substance there it's a reality in the
[2:30:59] heart of every believer it's not just a
[2:31:01] hop so or a maybe so it's more real than
[2:31:04] me standing right here
[2:31:08] today that's hard to
[2:31:11] grasp because we live in this realm in
[2:31:14] our
[2:31:15] flesh
[2:31:16] but in the reality of the Eternal realm
[2:31:20] where Jesus Christ is it's more
[2:31:26] real he says and if children then heirs
[2:31:28] HS of God and Joint airs with Christ if
[2:31:31] so be that we suffer with him we shall
[2:31:35] also be glorified
[2:31:41] together can we go further or I'm out of
[2:31:44] time I got one amen two amen three
[2:31:50] amen all right I didn't put a time limit
[2:31:52] to those amens so I'll say it was an
[2:31:54] hour per one
[2:31:59] two brother brand would talk about the
[2:32:01] Ascension of Jesus Christ in Acts
[2:32:03] chapter one where he say watch him as he
[2:32:05] goes about a few days later after he's
[2:32:08] gathered his disciples on the bank he's
[2:32:09] preaching to them and those last
[2:32:11] beautiful lips of his working there
[2:32:13] bringing forth words says go ye into all
[2:32:15] the world preach the gospel to Every
[2:32:17] Creature he's beginning he says and
[2:32:19] these signs shall follow them that
[2:32:20] believe and then in Acts one as he
[2:32:22] begins to speak unto them says go and
[2:32:24] wait and don't don't don't preach now
[2:32:26] wait till you're endued with power from
[2:32:27] on high then you go forth and preach and
[2:32:29] he says and as he begins to speak these
[2:32:31] wonderful words he begin to say that
[2:32:33] that they begin to see daylight coming
[2:32:35] under his feet he said what's the matter
[2:32:38] God showing his power raising up what is
[2:32:42] he he is defying every law of gravity
[2:32:45] he's being lifted up why is it he's the
[2:32:47] creator of gravitation and and there
[2:32:50] here he is he ascends up he ascends on
[2:32:52] up till he gets up on high and he sits
[2:32:54] down quietly at the feet of the Majesty
[2:32:56] on high glory to God he says there he is
[2:32:59] with all power in Heaven and Earth is in
[2:33:01] his
[2:33:02] hands not even one little wave can
[2:33:07] move excuse
[2:33:09] me felt that
[2:33:12] coming not even one little wave can move
[2:33:15] on the ocean without him permitting
[2:33:18] it that's a very good quote for right
[2:33:22] here in New
[2:33:23] Finland not even one Mo wave can move on
[2:33:26] that ocean out there without him
[2:33:29] permitting it that's his power
[2:33:31] Hallelujah and that power of the same
[2:33:34] thing is working in US same quote to
[2:33:39] make us new creatures in Christ Jesus Oh
[2:33:42] Brother there's where power comes as our
[2:33:45] faith brings brings down our faith which
[2:33:48] is love what's love God is love he's the
[2:33:51] substance of our faith it brings all all
[2:33:54] fear it casts away all fear that we
[2:33:57] think God wouldn't keep his word when I
[2:33:59] saw the very love and the grace of
[2:34:01] Christ then it brings him right down to
[2:34:04] us what's he doing as he's coming down
[2:34:07] the shout the voice and the trumpet it's
[2:34:09] the word coming of God coming down to
[2:34:11] catch away his bride he says the mighty
[2:34:14] power of God begins to work into the
[2:34:17] church love that conquers I tell you
[2:34:20] love is the most powerful thing there is
[2:34:22] in the world there's nothing will take
[2:34:24] its place but love if you read on in in
[2:34:28] Hebrews chapter 12 and you get right
[2:34:30] down to the end where it says we've
[2:34:31] received a kingdom which cannot be
[2:34:32] shaken that we may serve god with with
[2:34:34] reverence and with Godly fear for our
[2:34:36] God is a consuming fire praise be to God
[2:34:39] and verse one of the next one is let
[2:34:41] Brotherly Love
[2:34:44] continue love is the the most powerful
[2:34:47] force that's in the earth there's
[2:34:49] nothing that could take its place it's
[2:34:53] love and perfect Faith he says now the
[2:34:56] only thing you have to do then is have
[2:34:59] faith in what you
[2:35:04] are the only thing you have to do
[2:35:08] then is have faith in what you are why
[2:35:11] could we sing a song like Lord all I
[2:35:12] have to do is praise why because you've
[2:35:15] got faith in what you are that I'm not
[2:35:18] the one doing the work I can just praise
[2:35:20] God that he's already done it and he's
[2:35:23] already paid the price and I can walk
[2:35:25] into his great Variety Store and I can
[2:35:27] go get whatever I have need of by faith
[2:35:29] because it's him in me doing the work
[2:35:31] and I'm the one resting in him
[2:35:34] Hallelujah have faith in what the word
[2:35:36] says you are Jesus had faith in the word
[2:35:39] of God that said that he said is written
[2:35:42] of me didn't David the psalm saying the
[2:35:44] prophets and all them speak of him
[2:35:45] saying I am the bread of life that comes
[2:35:47] from God out of Heaven amen I am the
[2:35:49] tree of life that was in the Garden of
[2:35:51] Eden I am all these things he said I am
[2:35:53] that I
[2:35:54] am he knew that with perfect faith that
[2:35:57] he was anointed Messiah and that the
[2:36:00] spirit of God was upon him and now I in
[2:36:03] myself do nothing but it's my faith in
[2:36:07] God that's why he says I do nothing but
[2:36:10] what the father shows me that doeth the
[2:36:13] son likewise why because he says that's
[2:36:16] me it's not wasn't a different oh Saints
[2:36:19] I hope we can catch this it's not a
[2:36:20] different relationship that you have
[2:36:22] with God than what Jesus had with
[2:36:27] God let me scroll right down here to a
[2:36:29] scripture I've got in the bottom oh my
[2:36:31] I'm not even halfway through the notes
[2:36:33] he says sanctify them John chapter 17:17
[2:36:35] says sanctify them through the truth Thy
[2:36:38] word is truth as thou has sent me in the
[2:36:40] into the world so even so I have sent
[2:36:43] them into the world that for their sake
[2:36:46] I sanctify myself that they also might
[2:36:48] be Sanctified through the truth neither
[2:36:50] pray I for these alone but for also but
[2:36:53] them also which Shall Believe on me
[2:36:55] through their word as Paul would write
[2:36:57] faith comes by hearing hearing by the
[2:36:59] word of God and he says but how would
[2:37:01] they hear unless some of us went and
[2:37:03] ministered but he says all them that
[2:37:06] would come to believe on the Lord Jesus
[2:37:08] Christ by the hearing of the word of God
[2:37:11] Amen he says I pray for all of them
[2:37:13] praise the Lord Jesus Christ 2 years ago
[2:37:16] didn't only die for you he prayed for
[2:37:19] you Hallelujah though he says what did
[2:37:22] he pray that they all may be
[2:37:27] one as thou father art in me and I in
[2:37:31] thee that they also may be one in us
[2:37:34] that the world may believe that thou
[2:37:37] Hast sent me and the glory which thou
[2:37:39] givest me I have given them that they
[2:37:43] may be one even as as we are
[2:37:49] one the relationship that you have with
[2:37:52] God is Not different than the
[2:37:53] relationship that Jesus had with God and
[2:37:55] we know that Jesus had to pray
[2:37:57] constantly to stay in touch with the
[2:37:58] spirit the attribute of the fullness of
[2:38:00] God that was within him that we have it
[2:38:02] in portion but it is the same
[2:38:06] relationship Hallelujah that he might be
[2:38:08] the first born among many brethren in
[2:38:11] other words he was a the son and you are
[2:38:14] a son of God God hallelujah that it was
[2:38:17] we in our day was a son of man revealing
[2:38:20] the son of man I'll say it this way you
[2:38:21] are a son of God revealing the Son of
[2:38:25] God In Our
[2:38:27] Generation Hallelujah he says I in them
[2:38:30] and thou in me that they may be made
[2:38:33] perfect in one and that the world may
[2:38:36] know that thou has sent me and H has
[2:38:38] loved them as thou Hast loved
[2:38:42] me oh praise be to God
[2:38:46] Jesus would be able to ride and said he
[2:38:48] that believeth on
[2:38:50] me because I go unto the
[2:38:53] father you could do the Greater
[2:38:56] Works you could do the Greater
[2:39:00] Works we know how it was that Jesus had
[2:39:03] more success in the in the ministry of
[2:39:06] the William brandom than he did in his
[2:39:08] own of brother bam than he did in his
[2:39:14] own
[2:39:20] oh
[2:39:22] my you are a new creature in Christ
[2:39:28] Jesus let me go back here to the church
[2:39:31] age
[2:39:37] book need to sing a song and come
[2:39:44] back how's be honest with you I I'm I've
[2:39:47] skipped a couple pages and I'm now at
[2:39:48] page eight out of
[2:39:51] 17 I told you I wasn't starting a timer
[2:39:53] but I'm starting to feel guilty about
[2:39:56] it says but now Church age book brother
[2:40:00] bam says now he is standing in the midst
[2:40:02] of the church remember as he comes down
[2:40:04] he does all three things but he says but
[2:40:06] now he is standing in the midst of the
[2:40:08] church as he stands there revealing who
[2:40:11] he is in the last days he calls himself
[2:40:13] the author of The Creation of God he
[2:40:17] says this is another
[2:40:19] creation this has to do with the church
[2:40:22] this is a special designation of
[2:40:26] himself that he is the creator of that
[2:40:29] church the Heavenly bridegroom creating
[2:40:32] his own
[2:40:34] bride like Mary was the human incubator
[2:40:37] and she carried the holy ghost child the
[2:40:39] holy child and brought him to birth it
[2:40:42] was a God man he was the son of God and
[2:40:45] he he was a new creation man and God met
[2:40:47] and joined he was the first of a new of
[2:40:50] this new race he is the head of this new
[2:40:54] race Colossians 1118 we read it he is
[2:40:55] the head of the body the church who is
[2:40:57] the beginning the firstborn from the
[2:40:58] dead that in all things he might have
[2:41:00] the P preeminence and in 2 Corinthians
[2:41:04] 5:17 says therefore If any man be in
[2:41:06] Christ he is a new creation old things
[2:41:09] are passed away behold all things are
[2:41:11] become new he says there you can see
[2:41:14] that that that that through man was the
[2:41:17] older old order of creation Now in Union
[2:41:20] with Christ he has become a new creation
[2:41:23] of God Ephesians 2:10 says for ye are
[2:41:26] the workmanship of God created in Union
[2:41:28] with Christ unto good works we could go
[2:41:31] all it on it says the new creation is
[2:41:33] not the old creation made
[2:41:35] over it's a new creation it is another
[2:41:38] creation distinct from the old one amen
[2:41:41] and now out of every Kindred tribe and
[2:41:43] Nation he has purposed under New
[2:41:45] Creation that he is the first of that
[2:41:48] creation he was God created in the form
[2:41:50] of man God the Creator creating himself
[2:41:53] a part of his
[2:41:55] creation Hallelujah that is why we could
[2:41:59] look right he could look right down he
[2:42:01] said oh he said this this purpose took
[2:42:03] form through election this is the true
[2:42:06] revelation of God this was his purpose
[2:42:09] this is why he could look right down in
[2:42:11] the last stage and he and when all would
[2:42:13] be over and he could see himself
[2:42:15] standing in the midst of the church as
[2:42:18] the new author of this new creation his
[2:42:20] Sovereign power brought it to pass by
[2:42:23] his own decree he elected the members of
[2:42:25] this new creation he predestinated them
[2:42:28] to the adoption how else could he know
[2:42:31] that he would be standing there in the
[2:42:33] midst of the church receiving the glory
[2:42:35] from his Brethren if he did not make
[2:42:38] sure all things he knew and all things
[2:42:41] he worked out according to what he knew
[2:42:43] in order to that his purpose and good
[2:42:46] pleasure would be brought to pass or
[2:42:49] aren't you glad that you belong to him
[2:42:52] it's the person of Jesus Christ in the
[2:42:54] individual that is the actual substance
[2:42:57] of our faith the same quickening power
[2:42:59] in Jesus that could stand there and say
[2:43:01] when Jesus said destroy this Temple and
[2:43:03] in three days I'll raise it up again the
[2:43:05] same one that Jesus saith unto her thy
[2:43:07] brother shall rise again the same one
[2:43:10] that could say of assurity I am the
[2:43:11] resurrection of the life why because he
[2:43:13] knew what the word of God said that he
[2:43:16] was and he had perfect faith in that to
[2:43:19] speak with that confidence of real
[2:43:21] substance faith that is the same
[2:43:23] quickening power in the born again son
[2:43:25] and daughter of God today he says when
[2:43:28] the Holy Ghost comes into you and
[2:43:29] convince him to concern he says he makes
[2:43:32] you a new creature yes sir he makes you
[2:43:34] a new creature he puts himself within
[2:43:37] you let's this next statement and he
[2:43:39] says and you are his
[2:43:44] Idol
[2:43:46] think of what God's got for
[2:43:48] you he says he puts himself within you
[2:43:51] and you are his Idol you he is living
[2:43:54] inside of you working and moving his own
[2:43:59] way in
[2:44:00] you what is an idol an idol is a dead
[2:44:03] substance that is the image of a
[2:44:08] God in and of itself it has no
[2:44:12] power but what he represents is an all
[2:44:15] powerful
[2:44:18] being we as Believers are nothing but a
[2:44:21] few cents worth of Earthly
[2:44:23] elements and a Believer is the faith of
[2:44:27] God that moves in you we read that
[2:44:29] that's not a perfect faith brother Brown
[2:44:30] says the believer is the faith of God
[2:44:33] that moves in you other words it's not
[2:44:35] you moving your flesh is not the
[2:44:37] believer neither is your spirit but the
[2:44:39] believer is on the inside of the inside
[2:44:41] brother B says that's the real you who
[2:44:44] you are in your Soul that's the real you
[2:44:46] and it needs to push out from that in
[2:44:49] order to bring the rest of it into
[2:44:51] subjection you are written Epistles read
[2:44:54] of all men ye are our epistle written in
[2:44:58] your hearts he would say no one and read
[2:44:59] of all men for as much as you are
[2:45:01] manifestly declared to be an Epistle of
[2:45:03] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[2:45:05] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[2:45:08] God not in the tables of stone but on
[2:45:10] fleshly tables of your heart the same
[2:45:13] quickening power that was in Christ
[2:45:15] dwells in you you cannot help but
[2:45:18] believe and have real confidence in the
[2:45:20] word of God substance faith is not based
[2:45:24] on your ability it's not based on your
[2:45:26] DNA it's not based on your IQ it's not
[2:45:30] based on your wellbeing it's not based
[2:45:32] on how strong you feel it's not based on
[2:45:34] your Bloodlines or your lineage it is
[2:45:36] not based on any of those things because
[2:45:38] this creation has nothing to do it is
[2:45:41] absolutely distinct from the old
[2:45:43] creation because it is a new creation by
[2:45:45] his spirit that you are born into Christ
[2:45:48] Jesus old things are passed away behold
[2:45:51] all things are made new Hallelujah it is
[2:45:54] based upon the substance faith that is
[2:45:56] the person of Jesus Christ indwelling
[2:45:59] your
[2:46:01] soul that is why you can only have faith
[2:46:05] in there and doubt cannot
[2:46:09] exist Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:46:14] because it shall Quicken your mortal
[2:46:16] body how can it
[2:46:18] fail it raised up Christ how can it fail
[2:46:22] the new birth is the then the down
[2:46:26] payment of the earnest of the body
[2:46:32] change he says in another
[2:46:35] place he says but this Plan of Salvation
[2:46:38] is an individual affair with
[2:46:41] you speaking in tongues is a gift of God
[2:46:46] I love the way he differentiates this
[2:46:48] here he says salvation is in an
[2:46:49] individual affair with you speaking in
[2:46:52] tongues is a gift of God dancing in the
[2:46:54] spirit is the presence and glory of
[2:46:58] God this is from the message
[2:47:00] identification 1963 he says but you but
[2:47:03] for you to let your character be molded
[2:47:07] into the image of God that he projects
[2:47:11] himself and you are his Idol walking on
[2:47:16] Earth the expressed image of
[2:47:21] him and the scripture talk about Jesus
[2:47:24] that way that he's the expressed image
[2:47:26] of
[2:47:27] God all that was in Christ he poured
[2:47:30] into the church that you are now the
[2:47:32] expressed image of God what's in you is
[2:47:39] Incorruptible it cannot corrupt it
[2:47:41] cannot be corrupted neither can it decay
[2:47:44] that's that's why it was say seal until
[2:47:46] the day of your Redemption it is not
[2:47:48] flexible it stands firm it has power to
[2:47:52] overcome any enemy any obstacle or any
[2:47:55] trial as brother Bram would tell us
[2:47:57] Faith knows no
[2:48:00] obstacle real substance faith it doesn't
[2:48:02] matter what comes against it it will
[2:48:04] overcome it that is the believer how
[2:48:07] could I not
[2:48:11] believe that doesn't mean we use it for
[2:48:13] anything he would say our desires is to
[2:48:17] see him
[2:48:19] glorified not with self-pride but in us
[2:48:22] our lives to prove that he's alive
[2:48:25] living in
[2:48:27] us give us the quickening power that G
[2:48:30] and give us joy to know that we are with
[2:48:33] him both flesh and bone of him being
[2:48:35] bride of him and seeing his same
[2:48:38] Vindicated methods proving in us that he
[2:48:42] is now risen from the dead
[2:48:45] Hallelujah that's the only thing that
[2:48:47] will convince the
[2:48:50] unbeliever when they see Christ Living
[2:48:52] in you br would talk about the the the
[2:48:55] do rehead and where he would go and talk
[2:48:57] to the Muslim and he said the Muslim
[2:49:00] made it so he had to hang his head
[2:49:02] because he realized everything I had
[2:49:04] that Muslim had but he said but I know
[2:49:06] there's one
[2:49:07] man that makes the scriptures live
[2:49:11] there's somebody that can make Jesus
[2:49:13] live I I believe it's not just one man
[2:49:16] but that was the wave sheath over us
[2:49:18] that we're to come to that maturity and
[2:49:21] I believe we're coming there that that
[2:49:23] is where it could be that we are able to
[2:49:26] make Jesus
[2:49:27] live in our day the quickening power
[2:49:31] coming to the church making her ready
[2:49:33] this hour that we're approaching
[2:49:35] quickening power oh God help us receive
[2:49:37] it help us to believe it see it just
[2:49:40] depends on what attitude you take to it
[2:49:45] whether it's going to do you any good or
[2:49:46] not you've got to believe it if you
[2:49:49] don't believe it it won't help you one
[2:49:53] bit far be it from any Christian trying
[2:49:56] to say they have power they don't have
[2:49:58] power surely we don't claim to have
[2:49:59] power we only it's only Jesus Christ in
[2:50:02] us the real believer don't care whether
[2:50:04] he's backing up a denomination or
[2:50:06] nothing about it he only wants one thing
[2:50:09] for you to see that glorified Christ a
[2:50:12] real believer wants one thing and that's
[2:50:14] to see you to see the glorified Christ
[2:50:16] makes any difference oh a real Mount
[2:50:19] true Mount Transfiguration experience
[2:50:21] only glorifies Jesus Christ and any True
[2:50:26] Believer that's that's that's that's
[2:50:28] what's in his heart to glorify Jesus
[2:50:30] Christ that's what he's trying to get
[2:50:31] the people to see see God's word which
[2:50:34] is Christ magnified and fulfilling the
[2:50:36] promise for this day in this great hour
[2:50:38] of Resurrection notice and it gives them
[2:50:40] the joy to know that we are with him and
[2:50:43] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[2:50:46] what a joy that's that's the only thing
[2:50:48] that the real believer cares about they
[2:50:51] don't care about a denomination they
[2:50:53] don't care about an organization they
[2:50:54] don't care about what other women think
[2:50:56] they don't care certainly not they won't
[2:50:58] care about those things about what these
[2:51:00] other women do and these men that do
[2:51:01] things they won't hang their baby around
[2:51:03] with some organization keep them from
[2:51:05] putting it out they're afraid they won't
[2:51:07] have a meal ticket they don't care about
[2:51:09] any of those things it's nonsense to
[2:51:11] them there's only one true heart's
[2:51:14] desire that is to see Jesus Christ
[2:51:17] glorified their conduct must be with God
[2:51:20] it must absolutely nothing else just
[2:51:23] glory to Jesus Christ say what is Jesus
[2:51:26] he is the word that's right and notice
[2:51:29] and seeing his name Vindicated same
[2:51:31] Vindicated method proving his
[2:51:33] resurrection now what is what is it
[2:51:36] seeing your life by his promised word
[2:51:38] when he said he's the same yesterday
[2:51:41] today and forever proving that he's
[2:51:43] still alive
[2:51:45] let me close with a couple quotes here
[2:51:47] if that's okay I'm bringing it to a
[2:51:49] close but Jesus lived in a world that no
[2:51:51] one knowed about perfect Faith he said
[2:51:53] he was an odd person he lived in a world
[2:51:55] of perfect faith and a perfect God which
[2:51:57] he was if he lived in perfect if we
[2:52:00] lived in the perfect faith of a
[2:52:02] Christian and what we are we would be a
[2:52:05] Mystic to the world people wouldn't
[2:52:08] understand you you'd walk in the spirit
[2:52:10] what the spirit said you would do what
[2:52:13] it forbid you would not
[2:52:15] do hallelujah what the spirit said do
[2:52:18] you would do what it says don't do you
[2:52:20] would not do amen that's the way a real
[2:52:23] believer walks in what the spirit says
[2:52:25] to do we ought never to be concerned
[2:52:27] when we're sharing the word with
[2:52:28] somebody and they say well they don't
[2:52:30] understand it just speak the word to
[2:52:31] them if there's a seat of God in there
[2:52:33] it will strike sometimes we do away the
[2:52:35] power of God by trying to explain it and
[2:52:37] explain it and trying to make an
[2:52:38] unbeliever understand he says you won't
[2:52:41] understand the Kingdom of Heaven except
[2:52:42] you be born again so just speak the word
[2:52:44] and let God do the increase amen that's
[2:52:47] the way it is with a real believer
[2:52:49] they're a Mystic and people don't
[2:52:50] understand because they live in a world
[2:52:53] to themselves Jesus lived where nobody
[2:52:55] else could touch the disciples couldn't
[2:52:57] even understand him when he spoke to
[2:52:59] them when he say wow you talk to us in
[2:53:01] riddles we don't understand this how can
[2:53:04] this be and there wasn't in the world
[2:53:06] that he lived in why they couldn't
[2:53:07] understand him nobody could understand
[2:53:09] him so when a man lives by faith and
[2:53:12] walks by faith I mean substance Faith
[2:53:15] he's isolated from the entire world and
[2:53:18] becomes a new creature in Christ there
[2:53:21] now you're getting to bride of
[2:53:24] material Oh see now you're getting into
[2:53:27] rapturing condition Hallelujah that
[2:53:30] means that each one of us not just a
[2:53:32] pastor or a deacon or a trustee that
[2:53:35] means the leoty every individual walks
[2:53:38] in the world with God Alone you're
[2:53:41] baptized into this kingdom and there's
[2:53:43] nobody but you and God see he gives the
[2:53:46] orders and you pack them out whatever he
[2:53:50] says you're not there's not a shadow of
[2:53:52] a doubt nowhere you just walk right on
[2:53:55] no wonder brother Bam could stand there
[2:53:56] with perfect discernment after perfect
[2:53:58] discernment after perfect discernment he
[2:54:00] could go out and see visions and tell
[2:54:02] things and say Justus sayth the Lord
[2:54:03] this is going to come to pass write it
[2:54:05] down the fles of your Bible if it
[2:54:06] doesn't happen you could write false C
[2:54:08] Prophet across my back and walked me
[2:54:10] through the streets why because he had a
[2:54:12] perfect faith in what God said he was he
[2:54:15] believed when God said it he said it it
[2:54:17] has to be so I don't care how ridiculous
[2:54:19] it seems it has to happen and the most
[2:54:21] ridiculous thing that I personally ever
[2:54:23] heard is that this lousy stupid flesh
[2:54:25] would put on
[2:54:27] immortality that this corruption would
[2:54:29] put on incorruption but it doesn't
[2:54:30] matter how ridiculous it seems he said
[2:54:33] it would happen it will
[2:54:36] happen
[2:54:38] hallelujah we're taught to resist the
[2:54:40] devil and he will flee from us to resist
[2:54:42] is simply just to turn him down just
[2:54:45] resist him just walk away from it God
[2:54:47] said a certain thing no matter what the
[2:54:49] devil's trying to tell you you don't
[2:54:51] even listen to him your ears are deaf to
[2:54:53] anything else but what the spirit says
[2:54:56] he that has an ear that listens see what
[2:54:59] the spirit is saying to the churches the
[2:55:01] one that's got the listening post that
[2:55:03] catches what the spirit is saying to the
[2:55:06] churches are you catching this morning
[2:55:08] what Jesus is trying to say to the
[2:55:11] church oh
[2:55:13] Hallelujah your relationship with God is
[2:55:15] just the same way Jesus is was you've
[2:55:18] got an a direct line right to the throne
[2:55:21] room of
[2:55:22] God hallelujah ask and you shall receive
[2:55:25] seek and you shall find knock and it
[2:55:27] shall be open unto you amen Jesus in the
[2:55:31] message that day on Calvary let me close
[2:55:32] with this will be my last quote in that
[2:55:34] day on Calvary Jesus thanked the father
[2:55:36] that he hid it from the educated the
[2:55:38] shrewd the wise The Prudent and revealed
[2:55:40] it to babes such as would come to
[2:55:42] Calvary now watch Jesus Jesus said watch
[2:55:45] how it all started the works that I do
[2:55:47] he said he's do he said he's doing them
[2:55:49] right now the works that I'm doing now
[2:55:50] Healing The Sick raising the dead Open
[2:55:52] the Eyes to the blind these works that
[2:55:54] you do that the these Works shall you do
[2:55:57] also you'll do these if you believe in
[2:55:59] me you do these works and when when the
[2:56:03] greater than this shall you do for I go
[2:56:06] to my
[2:56:08] father then he goes on and says a little
[2:56:10] while and the world will see me no more
[2:56:11] yet you'll see me I'll be with you even
[2:56:13] in you to the end of the world I will
[2:56:16] not leave you comfortless I will pray
[2:56:18] the father and he'll send you the
[2:56:19] comforter which is the holy ghost from
[2:56:21] the world that the world cannot receive
[2:56:23] but you can receive him now notice he
[2:56:27] says the Greater Works was to have the
[2:56:29] power in the church not only to heal the
[2:56:32] sick and to cast out devils in prayer
[2:56:35] but to impart eternal life to Believers
[2:56:39] says the Holy Ghost is coming and is
[2:56:41] given into the hands of the church to
[2:56:44] impart life oh that's what Calvary meant
[2:56:48] it took stooped degraded men and women
[2:56:51] lifted them into a place to be Sons and
[2:56:54] Daughters of God to heal the sick and to
[2:56:56] impart eternal life by giving the Holy
[2:56:59] Ghost to obedient Believers as he said
[2:57:02] in the token message it's a full
[2:57:04] obedience to the word of God that
[2:57:06] entitles you to the Token to the Holy
[2:57:09] Ghost men who are who were once
[2:57:12] unbelievers be made Bel Believers and
[2:57:14] impart spiritual eternal life now how
[2:57:17] much greater is it to say this sick
[2:57:20] woman lying in here that can say a
[2:57:22] prayer of faith and she'll be healed
[2:57:24] that's a great thing that's what's going
[2:57:26] on then but the greater than this shall
[2:57:29] you do I'm going to give you power not
[2:57:31] only to raise them up for a little while
[2:57:34] but to give them eternal
[2:57:37] life which will be
[2:57:39] Eternal
[2:57:41] forever oh poor blind wretched people
[2:57:44] how do we miss that don't you see what
[2:57:46] the greater thing is the greatest thing
[2:57:49] that could ever happen was to impart

[2:58:35] to impart eternal life unto them that
[2:58:38] would believe that's exactly what's
[2:58:40] happening here tonight all it takes is
[2:58:42] for you to stand up and to receive what
[2:58:44] God's sending to
[2:58:46] you oh Hallelujah all it takes is for
[2:58:50] you to catch the inspiration so I say to
[2:58:52] you let those feeble knees be strong
[2:58:56] lift up those weary hands which once
[2:58:58] hang down make straight Pathways that
[2:59:01] the feeble be not turned away and the
[2:59:03] lame not be turned aside but rather that
[2:59:05] they be healed and I'm saying to you
[2:59:07] church here in new land stand on your
[2:59:09] feet this morning and accept what God is
[2:59:11] giving
[2:59:12] you
[2:59:15] yeah oh Lord you don't need the Lord to
[2:59:17] help you you just need to stand
[2:59:23] up brother Bram would say all you have
[2:59:25] to do is raise your hand it defies
[2:59:30] gravity I'm giving you a direct order
[2:59:32] this morning stand
[2:59:33] up you want to receive eternal life
[2:59:36] you're here in the presence of God he's
[2:59:38] here and I preached the word for a
[2:59:40] purpose to impart eternal life unto you
[2:59:42] and I'm asking you to stay stand up and
[2:59:44] receive what God will give
[2:59:48] you Heavenly
[2:59:54] Father Lord Jesus I preach it the best I
[2:59:57] can I know I've had the people a long
[3:00:00] time I've been too long Lord and I know
[3:00:03] I've kept them Lord Jesus and they're
[3:00:04] weary oh God forgive me oh God that I
[3:00:07] couldn't get it out faster I couldn't
[3:00:09] get it out better but Lord you're here
[3:00:11] oh God to impart eternal life you're
[3:00:13] here to give us whatever we have need of
[3:00:16] you said you sought the Lord David would
[3:00:18] say and he answered me and he delivered
[3:00:20] me from all of my fears he delivered me
[3:00:23] and he said if you oh the poor man cried
[3:00:25] the Lord heard me taste and see the Lord
[3:00:28] is good he'll give you
[3:00:31] everything he'll give you the desires of
[3:00:33] your heart oh Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[3:00:37] we love you this morning oh God it's now
[3:00:39] in the afternoon Lord I preached a long
[3:00:41] time Lord I think of Paul who preached
[3:00:43] all night oh God and there was a young
[3:00:45] man that fell asleep and fell from the
[3:00:47] window but there was a quickening power
[3:00:49] in Saul in Paul that he just went down
[3:00:51] there and laid his body across him and
[3:00:53] the man came back to life oh god oh
[3:00:56] Jesus you're here this morning you're
[3:00:59] the same yesterday today and
[3:01:01] forever don't let us miss it oh God but
[3:01:05] help us father to catch Lord Jesus as
[3:01:08] sometimes it takes a natural reaction in
[3:01:10] the inspiration of the Holy Ghost to
[3:01:12] catch what you're really trying to get
[3:01:13] to the church Lord God that you desire
[3:01:16] to impart eternal life Lord Jesus you
[3:01:20] had in the book of Acts chapter 8 where
[3:01:22] you had the disciples came when they
[3:01:23] believed the word of God up in Phoenicia
[3:01:26] you had them call for Peter and John and
[3:01:28] they came up there Lord and they laid
[3:01:29] their hands upon them and they received
[3:01:31] the gift of the Holy Ghost Lord it
[3:01:33] wasn't their hands that gave them the
[3:01:35] Holy Ghost but it was a natural action
[3:01:37] that caused a spiritual reaction and
[3:01:39] Lord Jesus we're asking this morning
[3:01:41] Lord that if there be anyone here here
[3:01:43] in faith that would desire the baptism
[3:01:45] of the Holy Ghost that would want more
[3:01:47] of you in their life that they'd stand
[3:01:48] on their feet and accept you as Jesus
[3:01:51] Christ and they believe and receive the
[3:01:53] word of God for this day Lord we commit
[3:01:56] it now into your hands we've preached
[3:01:59] the word Lord I pray you'd give the
[3:02:02] increase in Jesus Christ's name we
[3:02:05] pray
[3:02:08] amen

[3:06:59] [Music]
[3:07:03] together Lord laid these thoughts on my
[3:07:05] heart about well shortly after brother
[3:07:08] Jonathan had invited
[3:07:12] me come and speak on a three-fold
[3:07:16] showdown you're in a place here in
[3:07:18] Newland where God is God has moved many
[3:07:21] times in the
[3:07:22] past I told last night there used to be
[3:07:25] five
[3:07:25] churches now there's one that has a
[3:07:29] pastor as a real body of Christ a church
[3:07:33] place to
[3:07:36] gather but God is
[3:07:39] God he's proven himself to be God
[3:07:44] question is who are
[3:07:47] you are you a part of
[3:07:50] it he desires you to be a part of this
[3:07:53] new
[3:07:54] creation he didn't just die for our sins
[3:07:57] denomination only goes so far oh Jesus
[3:07:59] died for our sins it's wonderful and we
[3:08:02] can go off in the message and we can go
[3:08:04] down into some Road of the seventh seal
[3:08:06] and all of these great mysteries of God
[3:08:09] that have been
[3:08:10] revealed but what's it all trying to get
[3:08:12] to you
[3:08:14] you it's trying to get you to a place to
[3:08:17] realize you're the vessel of
[3:08:20] honor and he wants to fill
[3:08:22] it he wants to live today but he doesn't
[3:08:27] have a Corporal body here of his own he
[3:08:30] has
[3:08:31] you you're not who you once
[3:08:35] were that he would by a New Birth has
[3:08:38] totally changed you changed your desires
[3:08:43] changed your reason for
[3:08:44] fighting changed your purpose of
[3:08:47] being made you so that you could live
[3:08:51] this
[3:08:52] word and not just live it in a
[3:08:55] legalistic way but live it by a life
[3:08:58] that comes out from the inside and God
[3:09:00] just begins to manifest it and you
[3:09:03] desire to be clean you desire to be holy
[3:09:06] I'd encourage you this afternoon if if
[3:09:08] you don't know what that's like figure
[3:09:10] it out real quick get on your knees
[3:09:13] before God stay there until he fills you
[3:09:16] I know we're hungry I know the service
[3:09:18] has been long but what's more important
[3:09:20] than the word of God what's more
[3:09:22] important Esau who for a morsel of bread
[3:09:25] sold out his Birthright and now you're
[3:09:28] sitting here in the presence of the
[3:09:29] almighty God and he's saying come unto
[3:09:31] me all ye that we are weary and are
[3:09:34] heavy laden and I will give you rest
[3:09:37] take my yoke upon you even in the youth
[3:09:39] it's good for you to Bear the Yoke not
[3:09:40] your own yoke but the Yoke of Christ
[3:09:43] his burden is
[3:09:45] easy his yoke is
[3:09:48] light he wants you to be a
[3:09:50] partaker with him in Heavenly places
[3:09:54] would you accept that this
[3:09:56] afternoon let's bow our heads and pray
[3:09:59] together one more time and we'll invite
[3:10:00] your pastor to
[3:10:01] come Heavenly
[3:10:04] Father Lord we love
[3:10:07] you we love your appearing we love your
[3:10:11] word it's you here in our midst Lord

[3:10:16] anything of myself if I have misplaced
[3:10:19] any word Lord forgive me Father I don't
[3:10:23] mean that Lord I would certainly be
[3:10:24] horrified to mislead any one of your
[3:10:27] children but oh God I pray Lord that
[3:10:30] this weekend Lord we would have pointed
[3:10:33] Lord Jesus souls to Calvary we would
[3:10:36] have pointed them closer to you oh God
[3:10:39] to encourage them Lord to go on un
[3:10:41] Perfection Lord that by the preaching of
[3:10:44] the word Souls would be saved Lord that
[3:10:47] father ones would be Sanctified and ones
[3:10:49] would be filled with the Holy Ghost
[3:10:51] children would come into a place of
[3:10:53] maturity Lord father we need you more
[3:10:58] today than we ever have before we thank
[3:11:01] you for the service last night we thank
[3:11:03] you for Friday we thank you for today
[3:11:05] Lord I pray as the days go on oh Father
[3:11:08] may you make it more and more real to us
[3:11:11] Lord Jesus

[3:11:15] you'd give the increase we give it all
[3:11:18] to you now in the lovely name of the
[3:11:20] Lord Jesus
[3:11:21] Christ

[3:11:27] you I love him I love him because he
[3:11:29] first loved
[3:11:32] me
[3:11:34] I love brother
[3:11:38] Jonathan
[3:11:41] oh
[3:11:44] [Music]
[3:11:53] love
[3:11:58] me
[3:12:00] and
[3:12:03] puras
[3:12:05] my
[3:12:11] Sal
[3:12:17] [Music]
[3:12:19] un
[3:12:22] tree amen he stole some of my thunder
[3:12:25] from Wednesday night service I've been
[3:12:27] studying on but a man enjoyed so much
[3:12:30] took so many notes here but I want to
[3:12:32] remind us of two things this morning he
[3:12:35] said sometimes we call things dead that
[3:12:38] aren't
[3:12:40] dead because according to our understand
[3:12:42] understanding Lazarus was
[3:12:46] dead but it's not our understanding that
[3:12:48] made him dead it's our capabilities that
[3:12:50] made him
[3:12:51] dead cuz we couldn't bring him back but
[3:12:55] when he came on the scene when he came
[3:12:57] in the house he said she's not dead she
[3:13:02] sleeps cuz in is eyes it's just as sleep
[3:13:06] in ours it's final in him it's just a
[3:13:08] it's just a a state right and so often
[3:13:11] we look at our lives we look at those
[3:13:13] around us we looked at loved ones we
[3:13:14] looked at those that are out from under
[3:13:16] the word perhaps and we say they're dead
[3:13:19] they're gone too far gone they stink
[3:13:21] their life stinks they're a
[3:13:23] mess sometimes we look at our own life
[3:13:26] and even in the presence of the
[3:13:27] preaching of the word we can say it
[3:13:29] stinks but it ain't over until he says
[3:13:33] it's over amen when he says you're dead
[3:13:36] you're dead but he says he talked about
[3:13:40] the the valley of dry bones and he said
[3:13:42] Can these bones B live again he says
[3:13:44] Thou knowest oh Lord to me it doesn't
[3:13:47] look like it maybe to you it doesn't
[3:13:49] look like it but it's not over till he
[3:13:51] says it's over you're not dead till he
[3:13:53] says you're dead and if he says you're
[3:13:55] alive then regardless of what he what it
[3:13:58] looks like there's life still there to
[3:14:00] be had and there's a life that's going
[3:14:01] to come forth from it but I love what he
[3:14:04] was talking about you know when he was
[3:14:06] speaking of those disciples and the man
[3:14:08] came and brought his son and he said I
[3:14:10] took him to the disciples and they
[3:14:11] couldn't cast him out'
[3:14:13] and I'd written this in my notes to the
[3:14:15] day before brother Andrew as you spoke
[3:14:16] it because I've been looking for that
[3:14:18] that a revelation on Jesus said this
[3:14:20] kind cometh not but by prayer and
[3:14:23] fasting and you realize that he did his
[3:14:25] prayer and fasting in the wilderness the
[3:14:28] spirit led him there and what did it do
[3:14:29] it confirmed his position as the Son of
[3:14:32] God and he faced Satan and he defeated
[3:14:36] Satan and when he defeated Satan he
[3:14:38] defeated every demon that was in that
[3:14:40] Kingdom at that point he he had defeated
[3:14:43] everything when he defeated Satan there
[3:14:45] so what happened is the disciples came
[3:14:47] and they had a power but they didn't
[3:14:49] know who they were but you'll notice
[3:14:51] they never get defeated after Pentecost
[3:14:53] cuz they've been settled as to who they
[3:14:55] are they know who they are in Christ see
[3:14:58] it's not just power you've got to
[3:15:00] recognize who you are and you've got to
[3:15:02] recognize the authority that comes with
[3:15:03] your position that's in Christ that's
[3:15:06] why he said this comes not out but by
[3:15:08] prayer and fasting you got to find your
[3:15:10] place you got to know who you are and
[3:15:12] when you know who you are you can do the
[3:15:15] Greater Works because what greater is he
[3:15:17] that's in you you recognize the one
[3:15:19] that's doing this work in the first
[3:15:20] place it's not just a power it's a
[3:15:22] person it's the Life of Christ in US
[3:15:25] amen amen I'm not going to hold you long
[3:15:27] that's all I wanted to say but I want to
[3:15:29] say thank you to brother Andrew that was
[3:15:31] absolutely tremendous this weekend amen
[3:15:33] praise the Lord I say praise the Lord
[3:15:35] but let's sing one or two songs and then
[3:15:37] we'll
