fanatic amen praise the lord because you're going to bear that for jesus considering what jesus did for you what are you going to do for him amen considering the price that he paid what he suffered oh yeah oh please in the name of jesus we take if we take communion oh my don't don't let it be just be a tradition and and a form oh i'm going to i pray god that you're going back to calvary yeah to identify with the pain that he bought and he did it for you amen amen oh he did it for me yes i was thinking about it the other day it's oh my lord you did it for me but lord you did it for millions all over the world around the world amen down through six thousand years think what he suffered not just for one but for us all god's have mercy amen what are you going to suffer for him what are you going to endure for him grace amen and he said having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen there here and we're going back there into eternity god bless his word you may be seated amen please that we would be able through the scripture and the reading of the word to identify with jesus in a very personal way amen it's not just an history and historical event amen that we're going to look look look past the history and look back for the last 2 000 years oh yeah this is what jesus did there and this is what god did in the old testament but what's he doing now in the new testament what's he doing now in these last days amen at the end of it all as the part of god has highlighted us over and over again he said please he said be aware we're at the end amen it is finished and the world we're living in it's fetish brother i wonder how many of us in the light of what's going on around the world now concerning the covert 19 issues and this and this and this and these rules and these rules and these regulations amen how many of us are looking up how many of us are coming closer to jesus amen and realizing oh yes lord i believe i believe lord we're in the hour of the resurrection i believe we're in the hour of the rapture lord i believe oh yeah that your judgment has come down now oh yeah and not only that we believe also lord the devil has come down with great wrath amen knowing his time is short amen now brother sister considering considering what god has done and considering what god is doing look at the faith that it has given the devil amen faith yes satan got that faith so satan got that revelation that his time is short oh yeah he knows amen oh yeah he knows the word he knows this he knows that oh god yeah god said right from the very beginning in genesis he quoted the word huh and all the way down through satan is quoting the word and he's going to get you to head to the word or take away from the word amen because he knows it's the truth amen and that's why concerning the last days the bible says oh yeah the bible says satan knows the word and he's come down and when he sees all that's going on oh oh well oh yeah yes lord oh yeah that's this is what you said you're going to do in the end amen so he knows his time is short and he's come down with great wrath oh yeah and our childhood brother in this hour and this age we got we got more to face with the devil's deception than they did in any any other age oh yeah he just did a little here a little there a little there a little there but brother now it's getting worse and worse and worse oh yeah to finally of course in the last stage it is absolutely false religion oh yeah or he might he might have impersonated a little here a little revelation there a little revelation there amen but in this hour he's impersonating the truth the whole truth oh yeah and he's going to add to a little here and a little there to this oh yeah and there's many a so-called bride many a so-called believer that are deceived because the enemy has added to the revelation of the word amen and the devil is adding to it amen to get us oh yeah they're going back to just just theology what did he do in all the other ages they went back and made a denomination at the denomination and and it became all that god revealed became a creed oh yeah oh yeah this is what we believe this we we are this church and we are the these believers and we believe this this and this amen i trust by the grace of god that what god has done in this hour and what god has revealed in these last days is is not a creed no no it is not a creed it is the word that's been given and ordained to give us the faith that we need in this hour oh brother sister it's not just looking back here but it's what god is doing in the present tense it's what god is doing now thank you lord for what you did and you did this all wonderful praise there there's many a so-called believer and and they're living on history they're living in history oh they they believe this they believe that god did this god did that but brother what about what what is god doing in your life amen what is god doing in your soul brother god is taking more and more control of our lives amen so why so that we're putting less emphasis on the natural things and more on the spiritual amen so we're not looking over god god you bless me here you blessed me there you did this you did that oh yeah but what are we looking for not focus just on oh and focus on on what you did what you did what you did what are you doing lord what do you do and sometimes we think god is doing this and god's doing that and many are deceived because the enemy has deceived them amen he's added a word here added a word there what for or just to get us to be more relaxed around the word oh yeah just to get us to oh yeah you know i just go on say yeah i believe this i believe that and go on amen do what the devil wants you to do no brother you've got to do what god wants you to do live the life that god wants you to live amen you give preeminence to what god wants you to give preeminence amen so brother that we are not caught up with this world as the religious people are oh yeah they go to church there are those that go to church constantly and oh yeah and no doubt there are those that are reading their bible every day amen but still they're just religious and oh yeah i believe god and i i believe in god oh yeah they believe in god and they think if they believe in god that's it god is pleased no no god wants you to believe him amen believe us thou this amen oh but lord i believe this i believe that but he said do you believe this what what i'm doing do you believe what god's doing amen well i believe what god did or you can believe what god did 2 000 years ago in jesus amen but brother still i'll tell you you can have it in your head most are believing it in their heads this is the devil's watchtower is your head amen and he's there oh yeah he'll bring it to your remembrance in your head oh yeah the other bible says the bible says that but god wants you to get it down into your soul amen so god's in control not the devil amen god is working out of the soul to control your spirit and brother he's working out of your spirit to control your flesh amen but that you've got to go down into the soul amen amen brother the the bride she's she's rapture conscious all she's more conscious of the spiritual and less and less and less composite conscious of the natural oh yeah she's putting more and more emphasis on the spiritual amen oh yeah you go ahead and do this you got to do this you do this you do that in your natural life but don't let it take control of you amen you let god control you amen amen you know god control your job you let god control your education amen not my will as i've said when i when i was working in in retail business and i was doing this and doing that i i i consulted the lord oh yeah i've gone through this and gone through this doing this and everybody else is what are you doing well i'm doing this and i'm doing that and it's like one time i i was stood up there in a certain area and then i was i was just sinking and really in my heart i was praying and asking the lord for direction and so on amen and well i know because i did this and i did that and i did this and did that to finally one of the other managements came that says he says mr lars what are you doing you said you're just standing here i said well i said i've got the rest done and i said i'm doing this and i'm doing that i said i tell them what to do i tell them how to do it and so on oh yes they said they they knew that oh yeah so i said it's not it's not the intellectual in my head or whatever they're looking for this looking for that amen no no i i was i was praying and seeking the lord's leadership amen even in my job oh you did that oh yes i did that by the grace of god amen when i was there in management where i was there in a department store whether i was there maybe in a kitchen amen because i also worked as a cook and so on yeah doing this you did i said yeah we did this did this yeah but still i followed god's leadership oh yeah and again i do remember that there was issues when they somebody came one time and they wanted to do this they were part of the management they wanted this they wanted that and they said well what are we going to do and i i remember here overhearing them and they said listen get him to do it they said and don't let anyone interfere with him they said he doesn't need any help he's he he just he'll do it i had a help from the lord they didn't know it but i had the lord help me amen and this is why they would come out and say get him to do it get him to do it but don't let anybody else interfere he said just let him do what whatever do it the way that he feels to do it amen and that was management they felt they felt that confidence amen so brother sister regardless of what your job is regardless of what your education is amen let's be spiritual amen spiritual sons and daughters of god well i don't care what your job is you're going to be amen hallelujah you're going to reflect jesus reflect how jesus would do it what jesus would do you're going to reflect what jesus would say how jesus

resurrection i am the resurrection he brought it into the present tense for their souls now he's bringing it into the present tense for our bodies hallelujah god help us verse 12 again neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us thank god hallelujah it's eternal hallelujah brother what he what he

brother i tell you at the at the resurrection and at the the rapture amen the dead in christ are going to appear to the living saints oh yeah they're going to appear to many they're going to the city too then we're going to be cut into another dimension in glorified bodies and oh oh there's jesus yeah oh yeah we're gathering these glorified bodies here he goes up amen because brother for 2000 years jesus ascended up the bible says jesus ended up what did you do oh you send it up he appeared to peter and this one and that one and he went up and and he took the the body that he that he redeemed us in amen as the prophet said he took that body and he said he stood up before the throne amen in glory amen as the proof is the evidence it's done the price is paid amen redemption is is accomplished and hallelujah and he laid that body there and he and he came out of that body and on the day of pentecost he came back amen to share that eternal life with us with his elect with his seed hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen and then at the resurrection he's going to go back into that body praise the lord he's going to raise up the dead in christ he's going to raise them change the living saints hallelujah on the earth for the rapture oh yeah then we get into that dimension look up there he is coming down to receive us unto himself oh god of us to believe we're living in that hour we're living in that time please in the name of jesus let's give give the glory to jesus let's give preeminence to jesus brother let's focus on jesus our lord jesus christ and not in historical jesus it's the present tense jesus amen there's too many still there's millions and millions and millions still focusing on the historical jesus oh yeah he did this he did that oh yeah so this is jesus 2000 years ago jesus so many thousand years ago yeah but the bride she she don't she's not looking back she's looking here oh jesus yes thank you jesus look what you've done jesus look at the word you revealed amen look at the signs and wonders you did amen oh yeah this is why it was as i said it was on the internet some years ago concerning the ministry of william branham and they said out in the world can we they said explain the ministry of william branham how can we how can we understand this they said here he was this man he said they went forth and he said his ministry was like the ministry of jesus yeah he was deserting the thoughts and intentions of the heart and he spoke the word they spoke the word and this one was healed and that was evil oh my and they said yet let's consider what he teach they said oh how do we how do we explain that here is this man with this ministry and there's this man with this teaching oh they they recognize the ministry oh it's reflecting jesus amen but they didn't reflect they didn't recognize the teaching oh yeah they didn't agree with his teaching amen but brothers the same thing 2000 years ago amen they recognized the ministry of jesus amen but they didn't they didn't recognize his teaching no same thing today oh this was jesus he did this deserting the thoughts engines of the heart these signs these wonders oh made amazing the miracles that were done and they recognized it now but not not his teaching yeah and that's why that that for years they wanted william branham they wanted william branham to did denominations and and and these these brothers these sisters they wanted william branham but they didn't want him to teach oh yeah do the signs and wonders but don't teach amen and it went again it was the evangelist said that most of us all knew the world knew he was a he was a world famous evangelist back then amen and he was the one that that spoke to brother branham and of course brother brown said that there's three witnesses and he said william brandon was to the bride and he said then there was a another evangelist which was oral roberts and another evangelist which is a or billy graham amen and they they were god had chosen them god had ordained them got to predestinate them to be the witness to the world yeah amen oh yeah and it was it was oral roberts that that uh approached brother branham and he said brother adam he said uh he said we we want your t we want your your your signs and your wonders and go forth and pray for the sake and do this and do this but he said brother brown you've got to stop teaching he did yes he tried to get brother around and stop teaching the word amen they wanted the signs of wonders but they didn't want the word when jesus was there they wanted the signs and wonders but they didn't want his word amen because the word was going to line them up with the will of god amen they wanted their will but not the will of god amen but i tell you this william continued with the word and that's why eventually they just they they turned against him amen they rejected him amen that after a while they wouldn't have william branham come preach for them anymore after a while they wouldn't have come william round come not even for the signs and wonders because he knew they knew he was going to preach they knew he was going to teach this and teach that and they didn't agree with it this is amazing this is amazing that god that the man would have such a ministry amen but they would they wouldn't they wouldn't accept his teaching amen but we're here because we accept his teaching we're here we're not looking for signs and wonders we believe the signs and wonders that was only pointing to the word amen brother it's not it's not pointing to signs and wonders it's pointing to the word so that we're not going to put our emphasis on the sign but we're going to put our answers on the word amen brother again it's like i said it's like oh drive driving through a certain area and you're looking for a sign how far away are we oh it says this this is oh also we'll soon be there oh yeah well i'll tell you this we were brought there by the by the messenger amen the signs are pointing to this point into this pointing to this amen the word and the bride believed the word amen but but the majority of the people out there they didn't believe the message but they believed the signs and wonders oh yeah that william branham was doing but thank god we believe the word amen because the ministry is gone and god took it off the earth why he oh yeah why because the more he would go out and do this and do that the more they were cut out with the signs and wonders not the word amen but again like jesus said to peter believeth thou this believe us now the word amen what god has said and what god is doing amen believe it's not what god requires of you and requires of me oh they couldn't take the teaching can you take the teaching of the word amen brother amen the real teaching of the word is ordained to give us the faith that we need amen oh brother and it's not just faith for the heal my body it's the faith to change my body amen and most we're focusing on william bradham just for the healing of the body just to heal this and heal that neilson but the bride was looking for the word to give us the faith that would change our body from the inside out for the why because we knew we didn't just knew it just it wasn't just physical healing we needed here or there we needed a change we needed a rapture amen to get out of time and into eternity we need rapturing faith that's right amen and the continuation of the ministry now whether it's your brother gerald whether it's our brother jonathan amen amen the other ministering brethren brother what's what we're ordained to do focus on the resurrection and the rapture give us the faith to get out of here praise the name of the lord so god's grace brother i trust by grace we're going to focus more and more and more on the resurrection more and more on the rapture because we're we're living in a world that's come to its end when you consider all that's going on today in the world and covert 19 and all these other issues amen it is the end of all things and amen and the bible says that when when when the the true believer sees this and sees that amen what are they going to do they look up because they know redemption is near it's finished amen there's too many still focusing on this focusing on that and they want to make a big ministry a big ministry and go here and preach this go preach that go preach this brother we're ordained to preach the resurrection ordained to focus on the rapture you know brother he focused on all these things all the way down through and now it's her brotherly kindness and the and the anointing and divine love of the holy ghost himself christ himself god is love divine love amen just think god is a spirit but the only description of the character of god in the bible is love just saying oh god is this god is that god the bible says god is love divine love praise the lord hallelujah amen and brother what is what does what does that divine love do it's bringing us into a relationship with him amen it's revealing him to us and all hallelujah and and again that's why he allowed all this to happen that's why he's allowed all this for the last six thousand years why to bring out love he wants you not just for yourself not just for just to say oh i got you no he wants you for your love probably god said this is why he did it what for because he said he just it's not just uh oh uh it's not just being in a relationship just oh yes lord i need you to save me i need you to do this i need you today no he said he he wants you to love him yeah that's what he's looking for do you love god do you love god really love him amen and brother that's what he's looking for in his bride amen divine love oh i do this because i got to do it oh i got to do this because jesus you did that i got to do this because you did that no considering what he did you love him yeah and really lord you didn't have to do it no my son but i love you and i want you amen amen and he wants your love amen not religion you wash your love praise the lord and again it was hebrews 9 again sorry oh my let's start with verse 13. for if the blood of bulls and of goats honestly verse 12 again neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us praise the lord that had to be love oh what love oh brother it ought to produce love lord you did that because you love me oh my lord my lord i love you for your nature i love your attitude lord thank you and and if you really love him you're going to give your life to him you will you lay down your life because it's divine love for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an if are sprinkling the unclean sanctify it to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god oh brother his love is producing law hallelujah is love lord brother is is causing our love to mature and grow by the grace of god amen again how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god yeah purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god amen and amen praise the lord concerning eternity praise the lord the prophet of god said this is the ending up of the time it is it's finished it is finished time will be no more one of these days and he said we came out of eternity and stepped into a little time space here and stepped out of time back into eternity brother i trust and sisters i trust by the grace of god hallelujah we've experienced time i trust by grace now that we've we've experienced eternity oh eternity no beginning knowing and so on so we're going to go back to eternity and so on our thing oh well we're looking forward to that so we we wanted to face death i wanted to face this one i had to face that no for the bride eternity is love amen and it says we were before we were before there was a world we were with god amen amen and amen and he said then we came into the world and we go out of the world back into the unknown to us now amen and now in here we have had our savior come to the earth and he said god himself made himself manifest to us and gave us the hope of everlasting eternal life amen brother we come from eternity but jesus did this to get us back to eternity oh yeah we got trapped in eternity but the love of god sets us free to take us home amen praise the lord hallelujah brother it's not that we're strangers no no we're his brothers and sisters we fellowshipped in eternity and sin brought us down here and trapped us and oh yeah and i tell you because we were his seed we were calling for redemption calling calling to get back into fellowship with again that's why as the bible says there in one of the one of the in the in the new testament beyond now it says because of the love of god and god did this god that oh oh now we can truly say father father father why why because if we we didn't know him yeah we knew him we knew him and we were separated by sin from our heavenly father amen but jesus brought back his fellowship again oh thank you father oh father we love you amen see do you have that kind of relationship with god that it's is it is that father and sons and daughters do you have that kind of relationship with jesus as brothers and sisters oh yeah love see this is why he did what he did how he did it the way he did it it oh yeah it's going to trigger love not just trigger oh i thought i was gone at least at least he did this and now now i'm saved no it's more than that it's the it's the the restoration of a relationship the restoration of a relationship hallelujah hallelujah you loved him he loved you now now he brought now he showed his love and you're going to respond to his love oh thank you lord i love you amen i want to get back in and experience that love oh experience eternal life no experience love grace hallelujah so now he said we've had our savior come here to the earth god himself may manifest to us and give us the hope of everlasting eternal life amen and he said also in there he promised us joy and happiness and contentment amen but it's not focusing on just joy happiness contentment is focusing on our relationship with him amen love but he said i'll include the rest with it praise the lord amen and he said the bible said in the beginning was the word and he said the word was with god and the word was god and in the beginning he said when time began it was eternity before that and this is in time that we're talking about and he said eternity is like a panoramic he said it never ends it's a circle continually forever and forever it is an endless wheel that never stops or never as an end i don't know if it's still there this is how he drew it is eternity and he said there's there's no end to it he said it just keeps moving on he's moving on amen you don't look back you're just keeping on going on oh god help us amen god elvis brother that we're going to we're going to get out of the control of the mind to the control of the soul amen and the soul is eternity the soul goes on and on and on and on and on amen with the lord praise the lord but no when it comes to time oh we're too sensitive to to to to to the feelings we feel this we feel that and so on oh yeah this thought this this idea oh no no we're in eternity if you're born again you got eternity in you you're born again we don't stop to think like like like we do in time subject to time controlled by time no no no no we're eternal we're eternal and that's why we keep our minds on on the word of god on our relationship with god oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord so brother the thing of it is is that it when man sinned he said brother he's at this time amen and he and he just say this is where where we are right now he says blending back into into eternity amen amen that god has revealed himself as our redeemer amen and of course we reckon i'll tell you the elect of god the seed of god if they if they see anything and recognize anything they know they need redemption lord this is you're the only way that we're going to get back so lord we we we fail so lord forgive us and and of course that they they had the promise of god that he would come and redeem us and god has revealed himself all the way down through the ages amen praise the name of the lord amen they got in a messenger to the church ages by the grace of god to reveal himself reveal himself reveal himself to keep our faith in the lord praise the lord for the resurrection and the rapture so brother this is where we are right now just did the other aegis all down through but finally at the end of the age church ages to take us back to eternity amen he said the bible said in the beginning he said was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and in the beginning when time began he said it was eternity before that yeah in the beginning when time began brother we we needed redemption we recognized it amen and he said this is in the in time that we are talking about eternity is like a panoramic amen going on around amen it's an endless wheel that never stops or never as an end amen that's the truth so brother spiritually we've been put back into eternity spiritually we're in contact with eternity spiritually we're moving on with god amen believe in the word believe in the word amen and moving on giving god the glory now he said time is this little loop he said that loops down this is time amen and he said jesus was from eternity to eternity but he stepped into the time space and was made flesh and he came through here in order to sanctify and to put a streak of blood all across this place amen issue to redeem it and connect it back to god again for all eternity he said hallelujah that is all time is redemption he said man fell but man's redeemed amen we come from eternity hallelujah we come from eternity and he said we're going back to eternity amen and brother when it's when it's finished hallelujah brother there comes a time when time is finished amen that all has been predestinated prophesied for ordained is all done brother hallelujah it's all done and we blend back into eternity again and there is no more time hallelujah hallelujah i pray god that we recognize where we have come from and where we are going and where we have arrived poor elias glory hallelujah the revelation of this hour is eternal i'll tell you ever the more we get into the revelation of the word of god for this age in these last days the less and less we're going to focus on time the less and less are we going to focus on the natural things of life god help us amen oh yes brother they did it back here but again they were they were further away from eternity than we were and then back here and back here but we're getting closer and closer to eternity and we're putting more less and less emphasis on time less and less emphasis on the natural things of life that is the absolute truth brother god was looking for certain certain actions and reactions when brother when god came to egypt to to give the the jews the the message of redemption that they were going to be taken out of egypt and back to the promised land amen oh yeah and i got to a place where brother oh yeah god was going to bring him back to the promised land but he had to don't go back into the wilderness why because they were afraid oh and they went to the promised land and oh my look who's lives there now brother yeah and sometimes maybe the devil is trying to get it make us afraid of him amen and get us to pull back no no get down behind me your your time is short and you know it amen and we're not we're finished with time and we're going back into eternity oh yeah they got a revelation we got a revelation of where we come from amen we come from eternity grace and we're going back to eternity amen predestinated for ordained for eternity i pray god in the name of jesus that will not forget who we are and where we come from and where we're brother that's what jesus did what he did to pay the price praise the lord i don't have to pay it he paid it i have to accept it and believe it we're going back we're going back home now grace no wonder that when jesus raised the old testament saints raised with him and they went on oh yeah they they fellowship with the saints you know or the bible says the oldest message went into the city and appeared unto many oh yeah they did yeah they did but when jesus went up they went up with him amen yeah and and when they got up to a certain area there and they said open the gates they said open the gates who who is he jesus amen just open the gates let him in amen so that was the jews of course that that went up with him and they were screaming over the gates open the gates amen hallelujah they laid down their lives believing for the mess the the the messiah yeah and now when he raised they came back with him and they ascended with him hallelujah hallelujah i trust by grace that we are going to be proud of the gentile right amen he said now he said this time he said is this little loop that loops down and jesus was from eternity to eternity but he stepped into the time space and was made flesh and he came through here in order to sanctify to put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it back with god again for all eternity hallelujah and remember he said that's all that's all that time is he said is really is is to get us into a closer relationship with god and then of course we get over here and that's it goodbye we don't need no time god amen he said the bible said that jesus was the lamb slain before or from the beginning of the link and he said the beginning of the world he said christ was slain at the beginning now he said really was he really wasn't slain until four thousand years later but the reason he was slain then is because in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen see he said satan did not create this little loop this little hickey he didn't create that he said satan only can only pervert what god has created amen yeah whatever god does the devil is there to pervert it and brother even to the hour that we're living now and and the message of the hour satan is there to pervert it amen god help us to stay with the truth he said he went down into the very lowest depths of the lowest hell bearing our sins and he got to the end of the string or the end of the rope and he said there lifted it up in resurrection and connected it with the other part of eternity and made made a highway of holiness amen amen that the unclean could come unto and be cleansed hallelujah it is the highway of holiness amen from time back to eternity hallelujah praise the name of the lord amen and he said to the fountain filled with blood he said drawn from emmanuel's veins he said where sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty state thank god brother it is grace certainly not your works it's your faith in the finished work of calvary it's your faith in what jesus did lord not me is you thank you jesus for what you did amen he said come on to the highway and someday he was at the beginning of time shall stand as the ancient of time and will pull the great gospel cord amen and all that's on that highway from the beginning of time to the ancient time he said the end of time he said all shall be lifted up as he draws time out of existence and into an eternity amen he said we are now in eternity and he said eternity just dropped down into a time limit but it moves on by grace amen how valuable he said is your soul amen nothing is like being saved but he says you don't realize it friends i'm sure that the devil keeps that away from you as much as he can he said to realize what the value of a soul is he said did you ever just imagine what it is and what eternity means and how long he said you're going to be that way he said do you realize this is the time when you make your decision for eternity grace please the the baptism of the holy ghost put you in contact with eternity amen we come from eternity we're going back to eternity and i'll take the anointing and baptise the holy ghost to get it back amen and he said yes sir everything that has a beginning has an end and it is things that had no beginning have no end and there's only one eternal life that's in god all of their life has an end but god has no end because he had no beginning and we being parts of god have eternal life with god amen and he said we being partial of god have eternal life with god but everything that has any other type of life at a beginning amen only eternal the eternal life is the thing that lasts and goes on brother amen we got trapped here hallelujah and and death took control my brother there was there was a seed on the inside that when we when the when god struck the seed and anointed the seed oh praise the lord it come like what what came back eternal life put us in contact with eternal life amen and movement moving all down through the ages moving us on on on to finally amen death takes the physical body but we move into the eternal by the grace of god amen he says there's only one eternal life and that lays in god only and he that bear with my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life hallelujah hallelujah further is those that believe god hallelujah believing the word of god amen by the grace of god brother we come from eternity and oh no devil can keep you out you're going back to eternity amen oh no devil will keep me out no because if you're a seed of god you're not going to believe the devil you're not going to consider satan you'll say get behind me satan amen that the spirit that was in christ is in us and get thee behind me satan when the enemy is there no matter who it is he's using to say this and say that say that get behind me satan because thou savor's not the things of god you're not into what god is doing amen and brother i pray well yeah if there's anything contrary to to the message of the hour get thee behind me satan or you'll say this you say this say that no no no according to the message of the hour this is the end this is the time of the resurrection is the time of the rapture satan you don't know what god has done and what god's doing but he does he's tried to deceive us well as many a believer he's trying to to avoid from getting into the full revelation of what god has done and what god's doing oh yeah he won't deny that god has sent a prophet he won't deny he said this and said that but when it comes to when it comes to the reality of the resurrection rapture he don't want you to acknowledge that you know there's certain things he doesn't want you to see he doesn't want you to acknowledge god help us so he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me at eternal life oh i pray god grace that we we hear his word and we believe on him that said him he said you don't go to church on sunday to become religious and he said when you're born of the spirit of god you enter into rest forever and no more amen no more sabbath-keeping yeah why because it's eternal because if people think you've got to have this day and this day listen i said the baptism of the holy ghost you come into god's sabbath and i've had to share that with friends of mine out there who have this at association with over the years and they they think you gotta you gotta gotta worship on a saturday and others say you gotta worship on a sunday you gotta do this you gotta do that no no for us it's every day i said and as i tried to i explained it to him and i know the shock psalm i said the bible says you've got to cease from your dead works of sin and i said enter into god's sabbath christ never heard that before well i said that's the word i said go read it hebrews 4. oh that shocked him amen brother have we ceased from our dead works of sin by grace and enter into god's sabbath christ our rest hallelujah he said you are in the sabbath continually forever and forever for eternity and he said we are made in the image of god before the world ever was made yeah we were there before the earth was made we were there in the image of god amen and he said when that theophany has been made flesh and dwelt among us then through his death we ourselves receive his spirit we have no end we have eternal life god help us oh the saints of god or they're dead no they're not the body they were in is dead yeah but if this tabernacle be destroyed the bible says we got one already waiting eternal in the heavens again i checked to challenge some others that that they believe this they believe that and they they were trying to tell me oh the dead they're dead yeah even they believe even so-called christians and he said they're dead they don't know nothing i said wait a minute i said that's not scripture he said oh the bible says the dead the dead know not anything i said well you better go back and read that i said the entire chapter i said they don't know anything about this world i said but they're very conscious of the world they've gone into i said where did they where did the the moses and elijah come from i said when jesus went up on the mountain and and there was moses and elijah came came and talked to him i said you said they were dead they didn't seem to be very dead there i said they were talking to jesus jesus was talking to them knowing that they're looking down at jerusalem and concerning all that was going to go on in jerusalem so i said brother i said you need to get an experience like they did you need to get a relationship with god that they had amen because i said when it comes to the dead i said yes your physical body goes down when you go into a theophany body amen there's another body hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord amen so brother the moses elijah they their physical body went down and died and they'd gone back to ashes amen but i said god said ashes to ashes you can't you came from asia you're going to go back to ashes when it comes to the physical body but you go out of it out of that into a theophany body amen a glorified body amen you're not going to get you don't want that one no more if we get out of this one we don't want this one no more no we want to get out of this one and do that glorified body praise the lord hallelujah so he said we were made in the image of god before the world ever made and when that theophany has been made flesh and dwelt among us then through his death we ourselves receive is spirit and we have no end we have eternal life he said not angels but men and women oh he said if i could only get it in a way that my audience would catch it amen he says you will never be an angel god made angels but god made man and what god does is off of god which is as eternal as god is and then and a man is just as eternal as his creator because he was made from eternity amen amen amen oh god help us to believe praise the name of the lord again this was the message he preached in 1961 he must be born again he said if you were born again you are alive with christ and your affections are on things above and not on things of the world if you're born again of the spirit of god you become part of god and are eternal with god then death cannot touch you when you're born again you are eternal you have changed from a creature of time to a creature of eternity hallelujah and he said you have changed from death onto life i am talking about eternal he said from eternal death to eternal life if you're of the world you die with it but if not you live hallelujah he said good morning friends he said i can't tell what time it is but besides he said we are living in eternity we have no time he's a time limit stop when jesus gave me his life inside of me to live by his life amen so we are eternal creatures right now and he said we are sitting together in heavenly places in christ jesus what a time and he said we see this age that we are living in and it's one of the grandest ages of all ages this the loudest in church age is the grandest of the church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity amen so by the grace of god we're going from time to eternity hallelujah and god by the revealed word is giving us that faith oh yeah they gave them that faith down through the ages but they they laid down their physical bodies and went on into the glory into it into a theophany body the scriptures referred to as theophany a spirit body amen and oh yeah because like when the prophet of god was caught beyond the curtain of time oh yeah and he was he was he met those from this age and they were they were all fellowshipping with one another then then he saw the others from other ages and they were fellowshipping one another and on down on down on down and so on by the grace of god yeah so but waiting for the waiting for the coming of the lord and the fullness of the coming of the lord we will bring us all together by the grace of god amen so to god be the glory brother the saints of all ages they're not dead physically their physical bodies are gone but they have a glorified they have a body that they've gone into the bible refers to it's theophany body amen and and it's right here your theophany as the prophet says not 12 feet from you at any given time no and when when you die and if life goes out of this body you go into that theophany body amen praise the lord that's where moses and elijah went and that's why they could come back and appear to jesus by the grace of god amen but i believe that when jesus laid down his life picked it up again i believe moses and elijah went with him and ascended in the resurrection in in in their real bodies by the grace of god to god be the glory brother god help us to believe god's real god is real in the beginning was the word the word with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and dull among us and the word is made flesh in you and in me see to to too many people god is just everything is spiritual spiritual spiritual no no brother the spirit is made flesh in us grace he that hath an ear let him hear with the spirit sayeth to the churches the spirit as spoken the setting sun is about to fade into eternity for the church ages and then it will be all over then it will be too late to come but if somewhere in this series god has dealt with you by his spirit may you even now turn to him in repentance and give your life to him that by the holy spirit he may give you eternal life amen praise the lord just a couple of quotes here praise the lord i owe my oh my brother sister how many ammonias really believe in eternity we're living in a world that's more and more conscious of time they're more and more conscious of of what's going on in the world and and and more and more conscious of what what's going to affect them in this world or we want to do this we want to do that uh i think we need i would like to have this and i'd like to have that now i'll tell you it's getting to the place now where the elect of god the bride of christ if there's anything she like knows it's eternity why because she's so fed up with what's going on in this whole world enough lord let's go home let's go home lord oh yeah i tell you if uh the generations that are gone on if they came back they wouldn't want to stay if my grandfather grandmother came back or even if my mother and father came back and in this world all that's going on oh no let me go back i'm going i'm going going back with the lord oh yeah they wouldn't want to stay no and say i believe if the proud of god came and and they were to witness all this going on in this world today he said oh my lord i'm sorry lord i'll come back to you yeah they wouldn't want to stay and yet there's too many that are so satisfied with the world so satisfied with what's going on they think oh everything's good everything's gonna work out good for me working good for this and no brother how much more has got to happen for us to want to get out and want to go and remember you'll go when you want to go god said israel came out of egypt when they wanted to come out yeah why because god said to moses he said i have heard the cries of my people they got to the place where they cried they want to get out of egypt oh so does he hear our cry for the rapture does he hear our cry for the resurrection for the kingdom of god for the new heaven and the new earth oh yeah enough i s as i was praying to the lord the week and i said lord thank you for the promise i said of a of a new heaven new earth where i said lord all that's going on now it won't be there nothing i was just going to be absolutely perfect i said lord please thy kingdom come amen thy will be done amen you got to want it the prophet that's why the prophet god said each god is waiting on us what for you to want it and the dead in christ are waiting on us for us to want it the resurrection and the rapture amen brother i pray grace that word that the more that's going on in the world the more that's going on in on the earth brother that we really really really want to get out of here i don't care how much when it comes to financially how well you are financially how well you are physically no no no that don't mean it that don't want me to think to to to the seed of god lord why because they're controlled by eternity they're controlled by the revealed word lord we want to go home amen lord we want the new heaven and new earth please jesus according to according to the signs of the time lord this is the hour please don't let us hinder it or we're calling for the change grace amen praise the lord bear with me oh oh he said we lived through all these types in here but when you hit the eighth you go into eternity it's like the church ages amen so you go right on up through seven church ages and after seven eight goes into eternity we're at the end of the loudest in age it's finished oh yeah it's finished yeah i'll tell you churches are not like they used to be when it comes to the most part today most churches are dead dead one time that there was enthusiasm going to church enthusiasm worship enthusiasm for this for that but not anymore john he said when you hit the eighth he said you go on into eternity you don't come by laws rituals and orders he said you come by predestination and he said there is a genuine holy convocation and we're ending the seventh church age the pentecostal age he said do you see it he said we're entering into that holy convocation we are entering into that real genuine eternity he said where the church is called not to some station not to some denomination but into eternity with the eternal king amen he said we don't have it at all no such a thing as days things and times no he said we're going into eternity we're tired of time we've had enough time yeah and don't i i pray grace to our young younger brothers and sisters but don't wait till the uh to the the white hair comes don't wait till the gray hair comes no i pray grace that you did that the hunger and thirst for eternity is there now not because of all you're old and uh i'm i'm an old i'm a senior citizen no no no regardless where you're senior or not we got the same revelation the same hunger the same thirst for eternity amen amen he said in ephesians chapter 1 and verse 10 he said you're putting it down and so on he said it's called the fullness of time and when the fullness of time has come as we read in ephesians this morning he said then that's he said when time has been fulfilled why the fullness of time has come time is fulfilled and when the fullness of time has come he said that's when time has been fulfilled when there is no more time then you go into eternity and after the seventh church age is over and it is he said luther's age is over the methodists the pentecostal ages are over he said now he said you go into eternity he said no more sevens no more threes he said they're in eternity and he said where there is no such time as numbers and times and things amen you see it now he said it's eternity by the grace of god the seventh age is over amen and amen and amen praise the lord he said it won't be long everything is perfectly just exactly right he said coming to this one little tabernacle 1500 miles square from the same dimension yeah so the bible speaks of 1500 miles but right in there is where the temple is set and that's where the new jerusalem will break up amen grace he said the new city has 12 foundations 12 patriarchs 12 gates amen in the new city we're witnessing the end of all things just bear with me just a couple of quotes 1965 doing god a service without his will he said we are in the end time he said the lord bless you richly i get started on that and forget about time and we're going to fade pretty quickly into eternity amen grace of god i wonder how many of us feel that we're fading into eternity you know that in the life you live you you know this is going on that's going on oh my but do you really believe what is going on in your life that we're we're getting out of here and we're going into eternity we are fading into eternity by the grace of god oh my lord help us to believe he said god made the world in six thousand years and the seven thousand he rested and he said a man will live never live that time out and he spoke of the days of adam methuselah was the oldest man that ever lived in the bible and he was 969 years old he never lived that thousand years but the man that's going to live through the millennium 1 000 years to show that the penalty has been paid man lives forever the day is finished the time is finished they are in eternity yeah the millennial reign of a thousand years yeah methuselah lived 969 but nobody lived a thousand but there's going to be a bride i'm going to spend sat with jesus in the throne a thousand years yeah by the grace of god amen so he said he said i believe you're seeing the last thing that will happen to the church before the rapture it's done finished what god has done what god has promised in the bible according to the scriptures brother is finished we're not going to see any any other ministry the only that's to the gentiles brother the next ministry is to the jews we leave it with the jews god left the jews and come to the gentiles and now he's leaving the gentiles and he's going back to the jews right and we don't have time to get into the scriptures there to show you god doing that amen but i do know we do know that god is starting to move back to israel away from the gentile world to the jewish world amen because the gentile world is finished amen and we we have seen the last thing that god promised to the gentiles before the rapture he said i believe he said the rain is over amen just read the first three chapters of revelations and you'll see what's promised to the church that's what's promised amen the church ages and now he said the latter reign they said 144 thousand jews and they he said that's when moses and elijah there's where the miracles take place the things that the people's been looking for amen miracles that's where they'll take place is in israel amen god is finished with us he's finished with the gentiles he's going back to the jews and brother somewhere there is a rapture he's going to take the take the gentile bride by the grace of god he said we're just waiting on the coming of the lord he said keep your lamps trimmed and keep your lamps all filled full of oil by the grace of god amen amen bear with me again he said i believe brother and sister the revival is over amen i believe that's why you can't pray and feel in the spirit like you used to it's because the revival fires have gone out and i've been dealing with that with the lord last few days again trying you know in it trying to pray whereas one time the atmosphere oh my praise the lord you when you rose in the morning you could sense that atmosphere was different spiritually it was different oh praise the lord hallelujah thank you jesus but now the atmosphere is different it's dead it's totally dead that you don't feel that spirit there that anointing is not there why it's just gathering into the little bride to rapture and there's not going to be very many go into rapture most of our gone on according to the scripture most are gone on and there's gonna be very very few living saints raptured he said the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease laodicea goes into the chaos the bride goes to glory the tribulation period sits it upon the sleeping virgin for three and a half years while israel is getting to its getting its prophecy then the tribulation sets in upon israel and then comes the battle of armageddon which destroys all things and then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years the millennial reign and after that comes to white throne judgment after that comes the new heavens and new earth and the new city coming down from god out of heaven eternity and time blends together amen hallelujah to god be the glory amen one more quote amen this was a message that he preached in 1965 in august christ is revealed in his own word he said we believe that we are ending up this world's history now and soon time will fade into eternity and we want to be ready for that hour grace that we are ready for that hour through the through the revelation of the word through what god has done what god is doing amen make sure that we are ready for the change praise the lord that what god has done to give us resurrection and rapturing faith brother i pray god whether that it'll not become just history to us but to many it's history but not to the bride it is a present tense revelation power of god the grace of god be with us amen amen as we blend into eternity by the by the grace of god god bless you let's stand praise the lord that's saying wonderful words of life 4 37 amen saying them over again to me wonderful words of life eternal life let me more of their beauty see wonderful words of life words of life and beauty teach me faith and duty amen brother what's god requiring of us now in these last days rather he's not looking for us to just be going out there and be religious you know no but he wants us to be spiritual amen and if we're spiritual it'll control the lives we live amen it's not just going to be a witness to this witness to that one no how about a
