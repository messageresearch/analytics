them to us Lord that's how great you are but Lord we know we're a work in progress and so we're claiming your blood once again today Heavenly Father thanking you for it Lord Lord praying Lord that we would step from a people that just talks the word Lord into a people that lives the word day in and day out Lord Lord raise us to a higher plain Lord not just of Revelation but of manifestation Heavenly Father Lord let us be lights on a hill Lord that cannot be hid Lord let us be a Beacon of Hope Lord of direction for those that are lost in this weary land we pray Lord speak to each one that's gathered here Lord today and online Lord we pray that your word would Minister to hearts and souls Lord Lord with a fresh anointing Lord a fresh encouragement Lord Lord that we would just be closer to you when we leave this place than when we came in we pray Lord or strengthen us for a battle now we pray Lord we give you this service now when Jesus name we ask it amen amen amen God bless you if you'll turn the scriptures again to John chapter 8. John chapter 8 welcome each one that's here certainly I want to remember brother Gerald and sister Betty back home just not a very good week for him and just trusting the Lord will touch him amen and good to have each one here this morning John chapter 8 verse 30. same scriptures last service we're going to take the second part of the day of Jubilee John 8 verse 30 says and he spoke these words as he spoke these words many believed on him then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed it's always interesting to me that he says there's more to come there's more to come amen until we get out of here there's always going to be more to come amen he says and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free and Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever commit a sin is the servant of sin that's the reason why we need a covering this morning because if he sees sin then you're you're what a servant of it amen but the certain servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed amen God bless the read of his word you can have your seats this morning amen we want as I said continue on this series of redemption and I want to take the second part the last part for the day of Jubilee and I want to pick right up where we left off last service and we finish with this quote and I'm just going to read the last bit of it just to kind of give us a springboard this morning brother Brown said this in 1961 he said instead of them go on with the old Orthodox stiff cold church that was the that was the the nature that was the the the attributes of the Jewish church at that time brother Branham said they had slipped into Orthodox stiff coldness he says God sent the Holy Ghost back run all the squatters out and then took it over he said the power of the Holy Ghost came down and the church received the earnest of its salvation amen and we spoke just near the end yes of the last service of that Eternal atonement that's there to intercede for us and so if we have an eternal atonement then we don't have to go to a day of atonement every day is a day of atonement meaning that your sins are forgiven day in and day out there's something that's constantly working amen they say using the big words they say the efficacy of the blood is always there it never loses its power as we've been been singing of even this morning amen so we don't just have a jubilee day because remember remember the Jubilee day was the day of atonement but we have a jubilee age now we have a time of Jubilee we have a span of Jubilee where anybody that hears that gospel where anybody that accepts that blood where anybody that obeys the words of Jesus Christ can be set free amen it's not just a day but it's a season there where he says I'm going to give you the opportunity it's going to be about 2 000 years we know that but within those two thousand years spent anyone can go free if they'll hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the prophet of God would say it this way he said the Jubilee is on not just a jubilee for one day but a jubilee for eternity amen now the scripture teaches us in Revelation that if you want to overcome you have to hear what the spirit is saying to the churches amen that is the Jubilee that is the gospel trumpet as you had to hear the word for your day brother Brown will make the simple example he'd say Moses message would not work in Noah's day nor would Noah's work message work in Moses day you had to hear the message for your day and there's a voice and there's a message that's given for each age to set them free from the thing that is most holding them down amen but when we come to the end of our age amen the word is completely open because all the guns of hell are turned on us but then also all the blessings and all the Prophecies of God are turned loose in the word to bring us hope out of this world Amen to take us into Christ take us out of denomination take us out of the just men's ideas and doctrines and and and words without power and bring us into a place where the word can be manifested once again as it was in the original church amen it was Alpha and Omega and he said I am Alpha and Omega he didn't say I'm in between he said I'm the first and the last he that was and is and shall be forevermore so in this age we're looking for the same type of Jubilee that they had on the day of Pentecost and it will take us into what it was supposed to have in the first place which is take us off this Earth we know we had a plan we know he had a plan he knew it was going to go down it was going to go down into darkness and then it was going to come back up remember the all of the Jubilee was to take us off this Earth and restore us back to our eating condition amen we have so many programs today when we look around we're talking about Jubilee remember we have so many programs that are supposed to help us today when you look at what the government has and they have retraining programs and they have Rehabilitation programs and they have support programs and they have this this foundation and that Foundation then we have a charitable organization that does this and one that works with drug addicts and one that works with single mothers and ones that works with people that have lost this and you know veterans and all these different things amen but the problem with those things is that they never set you free you know what they teach you to do they teach you to manage Who You Are right they're leaving you where you're at but they're saying here's how you can make life better but you're still where you always were right they might they might get you into a bit of a different mindset they might make you so you're not suicidal they may make you that you're not addicted but you're still managing who and what you are but Christ doesn't do that he doesn't manage who you are he makes you a new creation through him amen he takes you a new creation he gives you a new birth and that's what we're teaching this morning that's what we're talking about is that you can be changed not that you can just manage your life amen manage life that's what I do really well naturally speaking manage life but that never gave me freedom that never gave me anything where I am today all that did was help me to manage where I was at and it never took me into a place that was at a higher plane amen if we do that if we if we get involved with those things what happens is they never take us anywhere they just take us to a better stage of life right where we're at but we're still there we're still there nothing's really changed we're just standing right where we used to be before just in a bit of a different mentality a bit of a different you know way of looking at things amen and what is it we get caught up then in a cycle don't we and we work we eat we entertain and we sleep we work we eat we entertain and we sleep and what do we do we're living for when we get home from work we're living for the weekend right living for the weekend some I think there's a song about that isn't there that's all people are doing is they're living for the weekend because there's no purpose in the day-to-day they're not in any place where they want to be in the in the middle of the week and everything is so they're just waiting till the end we don't want to wait till the end church we don't want to be waiting for something we want to be in the middle of it day in and day out to see what God is doing to be a part of it to know what he's doing and say it's in my life it's not just in my brother and sisters amen the prophet says this he says what a picture it gives us tonight of the church in this last days he says you see what man can do and then you see what God does and you look at the denominations I was watching a clip of a minister yesterday on YouTube and I say Minister you know they've got so many prophets out there and these different things and this man is speaking these words and they're they're they're big high words highfaluting words and he's he's trying to bless the people he says now you feel that thing blowing through he's trying to say that it's like the upper room experience believe me they wouldn't be able to sit in their seats if the upper room experience was happening and then there they'd have had the same results there that they did in the day of Pentecost they meant but he's sitting there and he's trying to preach to them that he's got a day of Pentecost going on and the people are sitting there dead as a doornail why because you can't put the life of God into somebody by just talking about it it's a new it's a new birth it's an experience that they have to have Amen brother Bob says you can see what man is doing he's in if you look at at the condition of the church in the in the seventh Church age in the late Asian Church age God is outside of it that's what man can do man can put God out that that in over seven Church ages what they achieved was they finally got out of the church isn't that amazing that that that's the the Pinnacle of man's achievement is that God is now outside of their of the very thing that he supposedly started amen he says What man does is failing and will fail has failed and always will fail but what God does is eternal and must forever remain nothing can ever take it away God give it it's his free gift and by his Sovereign foresight saw it and placed it and there's nothing can ever move it it's there eternally and Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people for restoring or being brought back to their rightful position so there's got to be a place waiting for you and there's got to be a people that's ordained to be placed in there that's what he's saying he's saying is that God knew this before it ever happened and he made a way for us by Grace but there's a place that we have to go it is not just being set free but there's a place that we have to go and if we take it back to the scriptures in Exodus 3 this is the The Exodus from from K from Egypt and this is the original Jubilee it says and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows do you know what caught his attention the cries of the people we have to cry out brother Branham said that God will send the Holy Spirit to put an unction in your heart to call for the things that God is trying to bring you away so if there is no unction then there is nothing coming your way I'm sorry to say but if you're crying out if you're saying Lord I have a need Lord I need Deliverance Lord It's So weary some I'm so tired I'm so worn out I'm so depressed I'm so overworked and underpaid anyone ever feel like you're putting more in than you're getting out that happens in your Christian walk when you're a server when you're serving you can give so much and you take so little mothers will feel this especially put in work day in and day out their work never ends and at the end who's going to fill them up but you got to be crying for something that's the Holy Spirit working in you and it's saying there's something coming and I'm preparing your heart for because if you're crying for it when it comes you'll be ready to receive it by then but remember they were cold and stiff and formal and guess what that means there's no unction there it means the holy spirit's not moving there's no anticipation there's no desperation There's No Cry in their heart for the moving of the Lord and guess what that means that he has to be very very Sovereign to come and touch you in that condition because you won't even recognize the presence of God you won't even recognize the gospel trumpet when it comes along but he says in verse 8 I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians we say that's the Jubilee but he says and and there's more than just taking you out he says and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites Hittites amorites parasites the hivites and the jebusites so we have to see that when God is here to give us a jubilee it's not just to free us it's not just to set us free you know there's a lot of people that have claimed the salvation of Jesus Christ this morning and that's all they have they claim the blood they've claimed the finished work of Calvary and they're sitting there and their guilt is gone but they're still where they always were they haven't moved to another land flowing with milk and honey they haven't moved to a place of possession they're haven't moved to a place of inheritance they haven't moved to a place that God ordained for them to have before the foundation of the world Amen so what is it God hasn't just come to deliver us but he's taking us to a place that surpasses anything we've ever experienced before he's taken us to a higher plane not just of Revelation but of Life of experience Amen brother Brian would say Joshua here is a book of redemption of the Old Testament because Redemption has two parts Redemption anywhere has two parts that is it's out of and into it takes two parts to make Redemption out of and into he said Moses represented the law which brought them out of Egypt whereas Joshua represented Grace that took them into the Promised Land he says another way to say it is the law and Grace were two aspects of God's command I want to stop here because this is critical you notice the out of part is Law and the into part is Grace because remember when they were going to leave Egypt they had to be under law didn't they because the law came to Moses and God said they have to take a perfect lamb they have to sacrifice it they have to put the blood over the lint on the on the lentil of the doorposts and then they have to go in they have to eat the lamb they have to have unleavened bread and they have to have their staff in their hand they had to be ready to go but if they didn't do that then what happened because they're under law Deathstroke and guess what somebody didn't get to go in the Jubilee because they didn't obey if the blood wasn't over the door if the lamb wasn't slain then the death angel would come in and the firstborn wasn't going to make it out of Egypt that day amen the death angel didn't have to pass if you didn't do what the law said so it was law that brought them out it was Grace and that it gave them a way out but they had to do it a certain way and if they didn't do it if they chose something else if they did an imperfect land if they didn't put the if they slayed the lamp but didn't put the blood on the post God didn't have to pass by them so there's a way of doing things amen so even today even under the law of Grace there is a law that takes us out that we have to do and we know what that is amen because you have to hear the right trumpet there is something that's going to take you out of and then there's going to be something that brings you into them we know the prescription we know the law is what Acts 2 38. it's very simple we've turned it into something else in the message and I don't know how we got there but Acts 2 38 is the new birth and we know that this is the key we know that this is real because when Peter preached it in Acts 2 38 God confirmed it by giving three thousand Souls the Holy Ghost right afterwards amen that was the proof the proof is that you must what you must well here's the Scripture it says when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do their hearts were pricked because they had a they had a problem they had crucified Jesus and they knew that they had to they had to make it right they knew that they were in sinful condition then they had to get rid of this conviction and Peter said unto them repent and be baptized in the name every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins that's the law and none of us gets past that you can be raised in a message home you still have to repent and you still have to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins That's the Law that's the prescription and then he says and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's Grace that's the grace part the law takes you out of and the Holy Ghost takes you into it amen that's the grace of God to each and every one of us so the law takes you out of slavery and debt but the grace takes you into possession but you've got to come the way that he said amen because otherwise what happens is you do what you think of what God means in the word and because you don't have the Holy Ghost you can't discern the things of God and so you make up what you think it's going to be and then you go find a church that believes the way that you think it should be or worse you can't find a church that believes what you want so you stay at home and you feed yourself and you go right down to death you go right to hell that way because you don't have the Holy Ghost inside of you you've got to have the new birth that the Holy Ghost will Quicken these things amen otherwise you're just going to turn yourself into two full two full more a child of hell because you'll just be a religious spirit walking around this Earth brother Brown continues he says now the law brought them out Moses and Joshua took them in it also represents something for our day now it represents as they were in the Journey coming from Egypt to a promised land so have we come out of a world of Egypt Egypt chaos he says and we're on the road our road to a promised land in my father's house are many mansions if it wasn't so I would have told you he says John 14 coming out of and going into so what I want you to realize this morning and perhaps speaking mostly to the young people here that being repenting and being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is not the end of your journey it's not just the point in life and then I'm good to go but it is the start of a journey because all you've done there is you've come out of but now you got to go into you got to keep moving you got to put one foot in front of the other you can't stand there and rest on The Laurels of having been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen free indeed doesn't mean you've just started the journey but it means you've completed the journey when you're really done the journey when you really take a resurrection and a Rapture that's when you're going to be truly free indeed amen but there's a process there's a journey that's going on between it brother Brown would say this in the mark of the beast he says it shall be light in the evening time that's right while evening lights are shining why don't you receive it why don't you come to it don't be sealed away don't set dead believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be sealed into the kingdom what is the mark of the beast to reject the Holy Ghost see the borderline see after he once come to the knowledge of the truth he says for it's impossible for those who are once enlightened see coming up to the knowledge of the truth and seeing that they see the truth see the knowledge of it and see it's here see it working see it's right and have a knowledge of the truth and then turn away again he says there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin it's a scary thing when we turn down the truth isn't it you know they have that saying a little knowledge is dangerous it's a dangerous thing that's what he says here you come up and you see it you hear it you recognize it and then for whatever reason you say I don't want it and he says when you do that he says that's the mark of the beast because what happens remember it was a sign in the head or it was a sign in the head and what does he do he says when you do that then what happens is you get a whole board in your ear and you can't hear it anymore that was a thing that scared me all my life as a young man was that I turned down the day that God had appointed and I was going to keep moving away from him at that point but the conviction was always there that's the beautiful thing if the conviction's there you know you're still okay don't test God though remember what he said he says while the light's shining why don't we take it now amen while it's still here amen we're so knowledgeable today you know what knowledge is information that's all it is you know what wisdom is the application of knowledge in a way that's beneficial and you've got to get wisdom you can't just have the knowledge you can't just have the doctrine of the message you've got to have the wisdom of God to see what that's supposed to do and let it have a work in your life for each and every one of us but today there's so much knowledge and there's so much information you can't keep up with it used to be that knowledge doubled every six months and I don't even know where it is now I think it's about two or three months the knowledge of man doubles they can't even print it all there's so much of it that's why we need something like the internet that's why we need cloud storage and computer storage and these things is because nobody could could contain the things that are that are in the knowledge of man at this point but where has it gotten us death destruction we've got more efficiency in our homes and with our appliances than we've ever had and yet we have less time somehow than they had in the in the in the 1600s when they had to do everything by hand it's amazing isn't it what has it got us it's gotten us all this time we use it to waste it's a shame but the thing is we can then look at the word of God and we can say we've got a lot of knowledge there too because we had a Prophet come in this day and he opened up the word and guess what there was a lot of knowledge available for those that want to get it it's amazing the people that are out there that have looked at the message of William Branham and have taken it and adapted it to use in their churches and it's knowledge and they have a certain understanding of it and even we've had it within the message where they took these Revelations and what did they do they used it to divide and they got arrogant and they got dismissive and you had cold and formal starchy churches on one hand and then you have fanatical churches on the other and it was the isms that we've talked about in the last couple Services where they said if you don't listen to this man or you don't preach this Doctrine or your church isn't this way or your people aren't that way or you don't do this you don't do that then you're not a part of the bride of Christ and you're not going in a rapture you'll never see that you'll never see that look at Paul's messages to the many churches he dealt with and how different they were some were fantastic in some areas and they were just children and others and then the others were fantastic in the areas where the other ones were children and then Paul had to had to rebuke them and correct them in other areas each one of us is Sovereign and God works with each Church in their different ways amen but what is it that happened is people got the letter of the word they got the knowledge of the word and the spirit got pushed out and so it led to what church splits people falling by the wayside cold and formal churches exactly what he came to bring us out of in the very first place amen now you say brother John that's pretty harsh and it is harsh but it's true probably the older ones amongst us would know it better than the younger ones do because we saw the all those different things roll through we saw two Souls we saw Perugia and all those different things and they rolled through and where are they now today most of them are dead and their churches are dead and the people are nowhere and they've got no young people they have no New Birth it's just a bunch of old people standing around having Church why because they left the life out of it and they went by the letter of it but listen to this because I'm not saying this of myself I'm saying this according to the scriptures now listen to what Paul said about himself he said lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations Paul says I have to watch out that I don't get lifted up that I don't get proud that I don't get arrogant because I know more than anybody else it takes a special man to write that I know more than anybody else doesn't it but he wrote it by the Holy Spirit he says basically to keep me from getting lifted up there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure listen Paul was the prophet of the age his position was to have an abundance of Revelation that was that was his calling that was his play scene and yet he says I needed something to keep me humble in all of this to keep me from getting puffed up to think that I was anything different than anybody else and we know that it worked because Paul said I'm the chiefest of sinners Paul never got lifted up in all of it he says and he gets into I think it's in Corinthians he says now listen I could talk as a man and say I'm this and I'm that and I'm this and I'm that and that he says remember I'm being foolish like a man and I could say this and that he had all of the all of the attributes he had all the characteristics to be a powerful Ministry and to draw people to him but he never did it he humbled himself so the working of God was effective in this man so listen if Paul needed it how much more do the rest of us need it amen we think we've got something special and then we get puffed up and what do we do God just has to take the little pin and go God help us amen but look look at what Paul says after this he says what he's speaking to other ministers now came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord he had to be able to say that without getting puffed up and we know it worked we know it worked Paul would would write harshly and then he to do what to set the people in order and then he'd come right back around and said it it tore me up to write that he says but I did it for your sake now he says let's fix let's fix it you did what you needed to and I believe that you did it in the right way so now let's restore that brother and let's get the church back in order and let's do all these different things he was hard where he had to be hard but it never elevated him up to a place where God couldn't use him but Abraham says and now look what the church has done it's either got off on a bunch of fanaticism and either went real starchy and stiff and take none of it it's a bunch of hooping and hollering he says or they go and they take on a bunch of something else and get starchy and stiff brother there's a middle of the road where the real true gospel is preached and the real true Bible signs and wonders following now listen to this a Sweet Holy Spirit leads the church that's the kind of church to go to unintelligent Church oh oh it's okay to be intelligent but don't stop there he says preaching the word standing on the word that's where you're living now right with a real Full Gospel sermon the real spirit of God everything in the spirit everything is decent everybody in order everything in love that's the kind of church we want how many wants to belong to that church raise your hands he says why sure we all do well God wants us to he said what made the difference otherwise he says how do we get where we are today in so many places we just started getting a little bit arrogant and different in our churches he said and the dove flew away what is it getting different for the sake of being different to try and draw and put a spotlight on yourself for what you have that other people don't have comparing yourself to other churches putting other ministers down lifting up the ones that are like you right us for and no more Circles of Fellowship Antichrist Church Antichrist when you say this they they've got it and nobody else does anti-christ because he has a global multi-member body and they ain't just all coming from one church or one Ministry group it's rolling around these days it's rolling around beware of it don't let somebody put you down and don't let somebody lift you up in these things stay in the middle of the road stay where God has put you stay where God has placed you amen what is it brother Rams talk about he says you tried to prove yourself more spiritual than the next guy don't do that amen because what happens is he's going to prick that balloon pretty quick and you're going to fall down and it's not going to be funny man but were warned against willful failure to hear the word of God brother Brian remember brother Jones said so often he says they don't he says they don't recognize the other Angel here you got to recognize the word of God when it comes your way and you've got to be quick to take it you got to say that's for me that applies to me amen brother Brown would say this he say many times men and women hear God's truth see it Vindicated and proven truth but yet they don't want to hear it there's some other reason there's some other choosing that they have than to face up to truth and facts therefore their ears can be closed to the gospel they'll never hear it again my advice to you when God speaks to your heart you act right then so the question is what is the holy spirit trying to say into our lives Church when the word shines its light into our life do we run or do we stand there do we admit brother Brown says what face up to the truth and facts we've got to look at the facts sometimes in our life because what happens is we get caught up in the idea that I've got the Holy Ghost therefore there can never be anything wrong or missing in my life and you know what that is that's an antichrist spirit because you're on a journey you're growing into maturity and then you're coming to a certain place you're coming to adoption as we're going to get into much much further down the road you're coming to something so don't sit there and say because I've got the Holy Ghost nothing ever is going to happen wrong in my life I'm not going to make a bad decision I'm not going to do the wrong thing I'm not going to get caught up in influence I'm not going to get addicted to anything I'm not going to get bound up in anything you will you will I have and I guarantee you that anybody here that's honest with themselves will say the same things they can get trapped listen the scripture says a just man falls seven times and he gets up again he's not just because he didn't fall down he's just because he gets up and keeps going and going and going amen don't sit here with a facade and say I can't admit that I've ever got a need amen listen we've got an open word laying before us so the slackness is not with God the unwillingness is not with God God has laid it all bare and said this is for you church this is for you bride not just church but bride this is to bring you closer to me so the the the the the there's no laxness with God the laxness is with us saying I need that I want that I'm supposed to have that because the word says that I'm supposed to have it amen he's shown us the way he's opened our eyes he's opened our ears he's made us able to accept it so why when it comes then would we turn it down brother Brown says there's another choosing that they have there's some other reason there's something holding us back in there so do we shrink back when the Holy Spirit comes and discerns into our life do we shrink back on the off chance that she or he might realize that I struggle just as much as they do that I might actually be human ministers especially have to guard this but guess what as parents as husbands anybody that has any position or authority or influence that's the hardest thing to do is admit that you need help just like your kids do that God needs to work in your life just as much as it does for your wife that a minister needs needs God moving and changing and cleaning him day in and day out just as much as the laypeople amen there is no difference between me and you none whatsoever I have a gift to minister you don't that's the only difference but in every other way I'm no different than you so why pretend otherwise why pretend otherwise as an elder as a deacon as a husband as a pillar in the church as somebody that's been serving God for 40 years that doesn't mean you don't need something new every single day that you don't need to be pulled away from the world and drawn closer to Christ amen listen Paul talks about this in Corinthians he says if therefore the whole church just come together into one place and I'll speak with tongues and they're coming those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say you are mad but if all prophesying there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he's convinced of all he's judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart May manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of Truth now I pulled that out of the Amplified here it says if everyone prophesies giving inspired testimony and interpreting the Divine will and purpose and an unbeliever or untaught Outsider comes in he is told of his sin and reproved and convicted and convinced by all and his defects and needs are examined or determined and he is called to account by all the secrets of his heart are laid bare and so falling on his face he will worship God declaring that God is among you in very truth so if that's what the unbeliever's response should be what are ours to be amen when the Holy Spirit is moving whether it's a rebuke whether it's encouragement whether it's correction whether it's love whatever it might be when it's moving into our Lives why do we resist it there's another reason there somebody else is in the castle that day and it's blocking up our ears and saying you don't have to listen to that but God has sent the Holy Spirit to free us he sent it to free us and so we have to hear it and say that's for me I don't have it in in here I just put wrote it down in my notes and in the office in John 3 verse 20 says everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest their deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deed may be made manifest that they are wrought in God so those that are of God come to the light and they stay in the light and when something comes in that isn't Godly then they want it there because Satan dwells in the darkness he dwells in the secrets he dwells in the shame that he can put there and if the light can come in and you can accept it then Satan has no place left to hide and you remove his influence out of your life amen you have to lay yourself bare before the preaching of the word before the hearing of the word amen let us humble ourselves let's humble ourselves and say Lord the word says I'm supposed to be here and right now I'm down here Lord the word says I'm supposed to have fruit that's producing up here and Lord I don't have any fruit Lord I'm struggling and I ought not to be struggling because your word says this isn't supposed to be in my life right listen that's where we're supposed to be remember the Jubilee trumpet is not for the free man it's for the slave it's for the one in debt it's for the one that's bound it's for the one that's in jail in prison in shackles so the gospel is for those that want to be free not those that are going to pretend they're free amen listen don't worry if you're not perfect worry if you're satisfied Where You Are worry if you're okay to be the way you are the rest of your life because that means that your ears are stopped up to the gospel trumpet because it's always calling us forward it's a journey it's always pulling us amen face up to facts as brother Branham said listen the gospel says that we're fighting every day yeah in Galatians 5 Paul says this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh you know what that means there's a battle if you've got the Holy Spirit there's a battle you know where there's even more of a battle if you have the knowledge but not the life that's even worse but if you got the spirit then you've got a real battle on your hands because this outer flesh this is not saved it's imperfect it'll never be it's got to be transformed we gotta we've got to get a glorified body Amen to get out of this pest house but Paul says it wrestles against the flesh these are contrary one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would Paul's saying that there's a fight and it's trying to keep you from doing what's in the in the in the tower in the control tower of your heart which is the holy spirit he says this flesh is battling every day to keep you from doing the things that you want to do what is it good desires are not enough you got to fight the battle you got to accept that there is a battle and guess what we've got parts of our life parts of our flesh where we're Victorious every day every day there are some areas where Satan cannot touch us we just don't go there but there's areas of our life where we're not Victorious every day we've got areas of our life where we're not Victorious any day that's where you need the Jubilee trumpet amen that's why you need it is because you're bound you're Shackled you're held up by things the question is not do you have the Holy Ghost the question is are you overcoming are you Victorious so the question is are you battling because if you're battling you'll get the victory if you're battling but if you're just saying I'm not gonna fight it I'm okay with where it's at then you'll never get the victory because there's no battle going on you've got to fight to have the battle you've got to resist the devil remember you've got to resist him and if you're not resisting then how can you ever win a battle I said this before in the other service you'll know when you're free you'll know when you're free because you're not the way you used to be and Satan doesn't have influence in that area anymore he'll do a complete work amen we talk so big sometimes we talk so big sometimes but then when we Face Down the facts we'll realize that sometimes all we've got is a slightly longer chain so we can walk a little bit further down the road and then what do we do we come up short again and again and again we can't keep going because the shackles aren't broken all satan does is he gives you a little bit more room it gives you a little bit more time between your addiction failures it gives you a bit more time before you run back to this run back to that before you fall again in the same area and you and then what's he trying to do he's trying to get you to say that's good enough or he's trying to get you to pretend that you've got the victory Satan loves a pretender why Satan's a pretender Satan Satan's entire thing is about pretense he's a bluff he's about pretending he is something that he is not he's like pretending he's got power he's got Victory he's got to influence all these things and Satan is a bluff through and through so he loves a person that's a bluff because they fit right in with his army Satan loves pretended Brothers pretended Christians that think they've got it the question is when you come up and he's giving you a bit more chain will you come up against it and say good enough or will you say no no no I'm not free I got to go back and I got to hear that gospel Trump at another time brother Graham says see the trumpet sounded and he can go free it's God's grace it's the Year of Jubilee listen he says the completion the finished work in that area like I said you'll know when it's done because you won't face that battle again you'll face the battle Satan will come back but that Victory will come easier and easier and easier and you'll turn them down flat and you'll turn them down flat and you'll turn them down flat until he just stops doing it he says the day of sin is over brother I'm not talking about morality I'm talking about victory where Satan is impossibly it's impossible for him to get into your life in these areas bit by bit we're pushing him back and when he's out you close the door and you lock it and then you move to the next one and you move to the next one we're just cleaning house that's all God's doing amen he says I'll tell every one of you serving sin he says taper visible audience let's say internet or visible audience everyone that's serving sin the day of sin is over Jesus died and you don't have to serve sin no more he who the son has made free is free indeed if you want to go free and be free in the sun Cut Loose from all things and serve him come on but if you don't want to then your organization your master whoever you're serving notice he says whoever not whatever because it's always an influence isn't it it's Christ and then it's everything else is satanic whoever you're serving will put a mark on your ear and you won't be able to hear it anymore if God ever speaks to Your Heart come this is the time and you refuse it then you receive his Mark you're hardened from the truth he says and that's the Seal of the devil the mark of the beast there's a reason why I'm open behind this Pulpit with the things that I've struggled with as a young man and even as a as an older man because we're supposed to be able to show that there is a reality in this life amen that there is something that this word does that there is something that it means to live in the presence and power of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives amen especially when it comes to the young man I can't identify with the young women in the same way but I know I'm in that generation where where technology really started to come in so I know what it's like to deal with addictions to technology I know what it's like to have access to things that our parents never even dreamed of ever having access to I know what's out there in the schools I know what's out there with with drugs and all these different things I know what it's like now most of it I haven't had to deal with but I know what's out there and I know that I've had to deal with it and I know that I've had to overcome it and I didn't overcome it by programs I didn't just overcome it by sitting in church and nodding my head but I overcame it by the Holy Spirit working in my life personally and individually to take these things out of my life and give me the victory over it so that when Satan comes now it's just not interested not interested not interested not interested not interested not interested guess what he doesn't do it anymore he gives up after a while usually amen but we want to come to the place where we can not just talk about it but we can say what he did for me he can do for you let's not preach at our young people without the experience that we're expecting them to have amen let's have it make sure we've got it so we can deliver it to them as well y'all reminds me of Peter Peter's so human 's Peter's as human as they come you know what Peter was a blow herd Before Peter ever got converted Peter was a blowhard remember he's always y'all do this I'll do that they come after you I'm going to do this I'm going to do that I always carry a sword right Peter was all Bluster and Bluff that's what he was and then what happened was when the time came for him to be tested what happened he failed miserably and ran just like the rest of them amen and Jesus said to him Peter when you're converted strengthen your brethren I want to read that scripture because it it's so so special to me and the Lord says Simon Simon behold Satan had desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat he's talking about when they when they would sift the wheat they'd throw it up in the air remember and the wind would just carry away anything that was light he said Peter that's what Satan's trying to do he's just going to throw you up and the wind's just going to blow you away and you're going to land wherever he wants you to he says but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren listen he didn't just pray for Peter he's prayed for every one of us amen we're in the mind of God he has made a way for us he knows what he wants to do with us I want to take that back to our lives because when we get the victory don't look down on somebody else that doesn't have the victory right but when you've got strength when you've got Victory go help somebody that needs the victory let's not just sit here in our white Thrones in our houses amen looking down our noses at the brother or sister that's struggling long life let's get down there and help them along let's get down there and push them along and Peter listen to this he said he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death yeah the grace of Jesus to not laugh at the silliness that we say sometimes because he knows what's going to happen now he says Peter I tell thee the shall not Crow this day before Thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me Peter's like I'm ready to go to prison I'll Die For You Lord Jesus says the day won't be over but you'll deny me Thrice he didn't just deny him Thrice he cursed he cursed he went back to his old base nature why because he never had a new birth heard a brother tell me the other day he said I cursed but not out loud I cursed in my head his brother sometimes life gets us there where we want to do those things what's Jesus saying he's saying Peter great attitude buddy but you don't got what you think you've got yet Peter you're a good talker but there's going to come a day where you're going to do more than talk Peter you're going to have what you think you have right now today man it's not insane the words that were proven today it's in doing the words and then when we can live it not just talk about it that's when we know we've got the real Goods amen we need to have a mouth that speaks the word and we talked a lot about speak the word in the last last few months I know but when it comes to speak the word the first thing we start off is not to say this is what's going to happen or this is what's going to happen but I'm talking about speak the word that says this is what God says about my situation when we're sick then we say by his stripes we are healed that is what we first start with is what the word says about it and then what happens after that is that God honors his word and brings it to pass in your life but the first thing that ought to come into our mouths when we go into a situation is what does the word say and let us speak that let us speak what we're supposed to do how we're supposed to act what's supposed to happen do we need a promise do we need healing do we need Deliverance do we need provision do we need direction what does the word say about it and then you go in and you write it down and you read it out and you say Lord this is what your word says and let that be the first thing that you do is confess what he said about it in the first place and then watch him go to work remember our words matter our words definitely matter Paul said this in Romans 10 he says that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus but don't stop there and that shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believes unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation but we have to get past just talking we have to move past just speaking we have to move past just saying amen and saying Lord let it happen in me let it come into my life let it be as I've read your word as I've spoken your word Lord now may it be released to go into my life and do what you said it is supposed to do in the first place we've said it before in the last few services but the revealing of the word is not for revelation's sake only but it's for manifestation's sake when God reveals that something is yours in the word that's the Revelation and what has to come after that is manifestation in his time not in your time but it's got to come out of it amen it's always leading this this Redemption process that we're going through is to bring us to a manifestation not just a revelation but a manifestation of the sons and the daughters of God Amen Peter was so human and when it mattered most he shrunk away and he hid and he ran with the others he was no more Brave than the others chopped the guy's ear off and then ran that's it didn't do a lot of good did he made a mess Jesus had to do one more Miracle before they killed him right that's all Peter did he was constantly messing up like I said then he went back and he cursed and then what did he do after that then he went back to fishing naked on the boat talk about a low point we're talking about a Jubilee Church Peter hit rock bottom because Peter used to be a nothing and then Jesus made him a something and then he fell that's tough to take it's tough when we fail it's tough when we mess up it it's tough when we get caught up in ourselves and Peter got caught up in himself and he thought he was something special and he was something special but not in and of himself it was something that God was going to have to do in his life amen but Christ had prayed for him that's the beauty of it and he says Peter there's going to come a day where you're going to be strong and when you get strong now strengthen your brethren Jesus continues this conversation we'll read it out of John he says so when they had dined Jesus said Jesus say it to Peter Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas love us thou me more than these he saith unto him yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee he saith unto him feed my Lambs now when did Peter feed the Lambs Acts 2. because what it was newborns it was people that didn't know anything people that didn't have anything people that needed help people that needed instruction people that needed all the things that Peter was going to do amen and that's why today we have services that are focused more on the youth and we send them to youth camps or we have youth camps or we have a special speaker or we take a service maybe on something we would consider more the basics is because we have to feed the Lambs we've got Lambs that have to grow into sheep so we can sit there and resent and I know we don't I know we don't but I'm explaining sometimes the things you think brother John it's really simple what you're preaching today yes because we've got Lambs amongst us listen a seven-year-old isn't going to understand the way a 50 or 60 or 70 year old does we've got to feed the Lambs sometimes amen but then he said to him again the second time Simon son of Jonas love assami he saith unto him yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep so he says when the Lambs have become sheep feed them and guess what you don't feed Lambs the way you feed sheep there's a different diet isn't there but Peter you got to move on with your ministry too Peter had to grow too and he saith unto them the third time Simon son of Jonas love assami Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lover saw me and he said unto him Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest I love thee Jesus Jesus saith unto him feed my sheep I think I already said that why'd he say don't stop don't stop feeding them because they can't stop feeding sheep have to keep feeding the older you get the more mature you get you still have to keep feeding you're going to need it all the way to the end amen don't hold back amen if you're a full-grown mature believer you've got to keep progressing in Christ and it's not just all up here head knowledge in the opening of the word it's got to be through your life because you are an example to those following behind of what a mature believer is supposed to be looking like the priorities they have in their life the victories they're supposed to have in their life where their decisions take them you're the fruit of what's coming behind you you think about it you're the proof of what they believe and what it will produce so you got to keep progressing you can't stop you can't stop I'm so thankful for the older folks here you haven't stopped as you come into retirement as you get older and you get more tired you haven't stopped serving you haven't stopped doing those things and it's not wrong if you stop serving but you're continuing to help in the church and you're continuing to lead and you're continuing to grow and you're not resting on your laurels and thank God for it thank God for it we need that but don't stop keep feeding keep pressing because we all got to get out of here and we got to get everybody up to mature Sheep amen we look at Peter here and he's getting frustrated Lord you know I love you you know I love you I Think Jesus was drilling it into him make sure you do and when you when you come to the place I've told you about make sure you remember these words Peter you got to feed the little ones and then you got to feed the big ones that are coming after it but look at what happened to Peter after on the day of Pentecost we talked about it last service he tried to start a denomination up there he tried to take men's knowledge and men's understanding and they drew lots to get another apostle and he literally would have started on the wrong foot and he literally did start on the wrong foot but then the Holy Ghost fell and what happened to Peter all of a sudden Peter had what he thought he'd had all along the things that Peter talked about the attitude he displayed the the strength of bravado all of a sudden now Peter had a reality behind him so that when things got tough when the politicians came after him when the ministry came after him when the people turned against him Peter didn't run away Peter stood there and he stood on the word and he stood according to the gospel call that Christ had put in his life and he did what God had told him to do all along he was finally bold in the time of trial he could stand up against people that disagreed with him Fearless that doesn't mean Peter never had a struggle or a fight but he was bold in the faith and not just in preaching but in signs and wonders prophet of God says they said the same thing about Peter and John said they were ignorant and unlearn of men but they had power Hallelujah to make a Layman leap like a heart they opened the eyes of the blind they unstopped the ears of the death because they were preaching the Jubilee year remember preaching is not just teaching it's doing that's what preaching is it's not just talking it's doing he says they were doing not just talking about it he says thanks be to God for the same Holy Spirit that's why I said you'll know when you're free Peter kept falling down falling down falling down going back to the old thing going back to the old thing going back to the old way going back to what he thought he could do best listen it's amazing because remember he went out preaching he went out uh fishing and they they fished all night and they said where are you going Peter says I'm going fishing they said we're coming with you they went out on the boat and they caught nothing he was no good even at what he used to do talk about a low point you've gone back to what you used to be good at and you're no good at that anymore and then Jesus comes along and he says lower your net on the other side and the scripture says they lowered it and it's like they did the first time they had 153 large great fishes the scripture says I just read in devotions the other day great fishes that they had and they drag it in there and Peter just comes running along and the rest of them bring the boat in and he recognizes that it's the Lord there but even then he needed God to bless him in the old things couldn't do it he was no good anymore what did Peter do when things got tough things got tough real quick on Peter didn't he Peter goes out and it's all noise to Broad and he preaches and all of a sudden they have a brand new church 3 000 people joined up to it and immediately the ministry goes after him remember they call him before the the the council and they they threaten them and they do all these things they say if you do it you're gonna pay so what did Peter do do they stand up there and beat his chest I have the keys to the kingdom of God I'm filled with the spirit you can't do nothing to me no Peter was struggling with that Peter wasn't sure how to move forward this is just a couple days after the initial filling of the Holy Spirit after the day of Pentecost something that had never been experienced and I've talked about this before I know but I want to drive it home Peter went and he had a talk with the people and they had a prayer meeting Peter wasn't too proud to say this is going to get rough and I need more than I've got right now guys if we read about it in Acts 4 it says no and now Lord they're praying now they're not they're praying to God and they're saying now Lord behold they're threatenings Lord you see what they've told us is going to happen if we continue to preach this gospel and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus now listen to this and when they have prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness Peter said Lord I need more I need more of you I'm scared I'm worried I don't want to die this is going to be difficult and I don't like difficult anybody else doesn't like difficult I don't like difficult it's not wrong to say it's going to be difficult and you don't like it but what are you going to do when the battle rages are you going to come back and say Lord I need more are you going to sit there and say no I'll do it with what I've got go back and get more because more is available there's way more than we have today Church there's way more out there waiting for us all he's looking for is somebody else say I need more I need more I want more it says in the multitude of them that believe were of one heart and of one Soul neither said any of them ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all listen you think Grace is great great grace is greater than Grace I want great grace in my life amen and listen when they're pulled in front of the priest they said listen we can only say the things that we have seen and heard we're only telling you what we experience that's what a testimony is church a testimony is not just preaching the word but the testimony is is what we've seen what we've experienced the reality in our lives that's what we're talking about priests and so that's all we're going to keep preaching we're going to preach the reality of Jesus Christ inside of our Lives not just what we've heard but what we've seen and what has been made manifest in our lives amen I said you can tell us to stop preaching but where you have to do it there's something inside of us that's compelling to keep preaching this gospel and they were the living proof they were the proof and how many of them died over the next 15 years just one after another they killed them and killed them and killed them because they were showing a living Christ and they couldn't have that they couldn't have that in the world they didn't want it brother Brown said this and we're coming to a close he says today that men and women in our country and everywhere else has sold themselves out to sin drinkling drinking gambling carousing that doesn't really apply to us does it I don't think so gambling you might not so much in this church but there's some that might be coming in in some places but really drinking and carousing is not generally known A month's a message I mean it's real it's professing Christians it's not generally there but then brother Brown says doing things that they ought not to do and become slaves to the devil he says I met a young lady here not long ago she said brother Branham I give anything if I could only break this band of whiskey put yourself there this morning she said I started when I was a little girl went with a boy that drank we started mixing drinks and I become a perfect slave to it she says if I don't have it she says I just go wild if I could only get rid of this I said you can't do it yourself but I know someone who can break it for you the Lord Jesus Christ has come to make you free listen being raised in a Christian home being raised in a message home does not Shield you from Satan he knows where to find you he knows exactly where to find you all he has to go is follow us home from church one day and he knows where every one of us lives and he knows who he wants to Target because chances are those are going to be the children of God technology has made anything accessible to us today we can get involved and hooked on just about anything by technology you don't have to go out of your house to do the very same to get in the same trouble that drinking will get you into or drugs or anything you can get as addicted through technology as you can through any of these physical things amen he says now if you'll notice in symbol that Jubilee year repeats now again every so often there's a Revival strikes the land the Welsh great Welsh Revival it closed not long ago we might go and have Billy grahams and Nora Roberts all over the land everywhere might bring special ministers in and everything goes really well and we're all that's what he's talking about and no matter how much we try how great we try to organize our people together and ban them it takes God to bring a Revival but notice what brought Jubilee to the children of Israel they cried out they cried out I'm not saying you have to be cried out for a Revival I'm saying you need to cry out for the things of God to get the things of God he says that's what America needs tonight that's what Canada needs tonight that's what Newfoundland needs tonight that's what St John's needs tonight it doesn't need a Billy Graham nor does it need an Oral Roberts what it needs tonight is the holy spirit moving amongst the people claiming the year of Freedom that's right doesn't need a new organization doesn't need a new setup the only thing it needs is the Holy Spirit to come in convicting power you could preach the gospel till you turn gray you could work signs and wonders till you turn gray except God gets out amongst the people and goes to movie he says what it needs tonight is not a new preacher what it needs is the Holy Spirit Get Out amongst the people go to stirring them up hungering and thirsting for righteousness sake he quotes the scripture blessed are they when they hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled whatever it is he says it takes the Holy Spirit to do it now in these days he's pointing back to the the days of Israel in the Jubilee they take the man out there and maybe hoeing in the cornfield the master walking down whipping him with the whip hurry up there gotta hurry up with this but just as soon as that trumpet sounded that man could throw that hoe down and say I won't hoe with it no more sometimes the problem is we don't throw the hoe down and that Taskmaster that slave driver was forbidden to touch him anymore because he was free why he had heard the good news that's all he had to do was hear it and act on it the Jubilee was on the atonement was made and all the slaves could go free he says I remember myself oh my when I heard that good news come to my heart as a little old sinner boy laying there on the hospital bed the doctor said you got three more minutes to live I heard a sound from heaven and that told me Jubilee year was on I accepted the Lord Jesus turned loose all the shackles of sin and said to the devil you can't do me any more harm because I give my life to Christ Jesus and you can't whip me anymore more since then he's bluffed me lots of times the battle never ends but he's not been able to touch me since because he's just a bluff I can hear his whip cracking and popping and so forth but it don't do no good because he can't get me because I belong to the Lord now that's right what does a bluff look like church what'd he say he says I can hear the whip popping and cracking trying to get you to obey what that Whip's trying to make you do trying to force you in a direction that the word says you ought not to go trying to drive you back to the land you were on rather than keep you moving towards the land that you're supposed to possess amen what does a bluff look like a show of force legitimacy I have a right to be here you know how Satan does that he says because you did this I have a right to be here you may have done that but the blood says you don't and so he has no right once you repent he has no right to be there that's it he makes you think because of what you did he has a right to be in your life you say no no no no that's under the blood now so you've got to go you gotta go Hallelujah that's what a bluff looks like so often he turns it back on us and makes us think that our actions give him the right to be in our life it does until you put it under the blood because you open the door you open the door our actions open the door but when we shut the door then he's got to go but you got to make sure that door's shut you got to make sure that you want him out you got to make sure that you're not holding that hoe still otherwise what happens is Satan's waiting on the other end of the road listen once you get out of his clutches then what he does is he moves right over and he starts to camp on your land so that when you get to the end of your journey and it's time for you to take possession now you got to fight to get him off because he can't influence you back where he was so now he comes to where you are and tries to pretend that he's supposed to be there as well brother Brown says this Satan is a squatter he doesn't legally own this now brother I'm speaking in this case about the Lamb's Book of Life which is the title deed of redemption he said and he's had 2 000 years of fuss whether he owns it or somebody else owns it but Christ came as a Kinsmen Redeemer and redeemed it back to us but Satan possesses it Satan possesses it he doesn't possess it he thinks he possesses it he acts like he possesses it but he says after a while this great fight's over he'll be cast into the Lake of Fire sea he'll be done away with and all them who worships with him but The Heirs of Salvation will come with Christ now he's a squatter now remember in the Old Testament if a man lost his inheritance and a squatter come on his land he could not hold it any longer for annihilation from the owner until 50 years after 50 years the Year of Jubilee came by and the Year of Jubilee when the Year of Jubilee came along then everything went back to its original beginning again so we keep talking ownership talking ownership the prophet says comes back to its original beginning origin is Destiny you're coming back not just to where you belong you're coming back to what you are you're not just coming into possession to have the blessings and the authority of God but you're coming back into position now as a true son and daughter of God fully manifested in total relationship with Christ as his bride you're coming back to original beginning beginning is not when he wrote it beginning is in the mind of God you're coming back to your position in the mind of God that's what this whole Redemption plan is to bring you back to what you were before he even spoke it out loud before he ever wrote it in a word for us to read he says it's coming back to its original beginning again all slaves they went back to the original beginning if a man was hoeing in the field and the trumpet sounded and he heard it he'd throw down the hoe and say I'm no more a slave I go back home to my family everything was given back everything was given back if a squatter was on the ground he had to get off the ground that's all he got off the ground because why the legal owner was coming back and he had to give way Hallelujah one of these days the kingdoms of this world will fall and the legal owners will come in one of these days he says amen can you imagine being in Egypt and it's that final night Moses is given the word he's told you to kill the lamb he's told you to put the blood on the door he's told you to eat the lamb to eat the unleavened bread as we're going to do shortly to drink the wine to have the staff in your hand and you're sitting there and you're saying how's this going to work sometimes that's what's holding us back is we're trying to figure out how God's going to do it rather than believing he's going to do it and it holds us back especially if you're in Ops especially if you're German you want to plan it all out right Moses knew a lot about how to run an army he knew all about the supply chain he knew the difficulty of moving two million people through a desert even for a couple days you look at the the amount of water the amount of food all the things that could go wrong spare parts needed for the wagons that were inevitably going to hit a rock or go on a rock and crack an axle or break a wheel you have to have all these things if that if that if that group of people was going to be an army they'd have had an entire set of reserves there of parts and food and Extras this and that and peop everything and you're sitting there and you're trying to figure out how is God going to do it foreign he's done nine fantastic Miracles now he's about to do the tenth and he's about to pull you out and there's people sitting there saying how's God going to do this and what happens is we get caught up in trying to plan God's work for him rather than believe that he'll do it just fine that it's his work not our work and we get caught up when we get into a mind cycle where we we're sitting there and we're wondering and we're worrying about how rather than just believing it will happen and I ran across this beautiful quote and this is it for the for the service brother Brown says oh the blessedness of believing the blessedness of not trying to figure it out the blessing of just resting on God's word and say it's true and go on it's life he says it's life it's real living my dear no you say brother John that's that's for the Supernatural That's for the great things of the world and the trials we face and the great difficulties look at the Simplicity that he's about to share my dear loving old mother-in-law sitting back here I was telling her yesterday about it she said Billy I had a clock that I couldn't make it run said I just couldn't stay without that clock I didn't have money to buy me another one said I got down and said God make that clock run for me will you said she looked up and it started running and just run perfectly you say God doesn't care about the little things he made a clock run he made a clock run folks do you think he doesn't care about you you think that you can't talk to him about the smallest things if he'll make a clock run for a poor old woman he cares about what's in your life amen another one her refrigerator she said a couple days after that kept defrosting just a little spot where it would hold ice she'd done everything she could do to keep it from defrosting because she couldn't keep her butter and stuff in it Pearl thinks she's a widow her husband is in glory she got down note she didn't have money to buy another refrigerator I think sometimes the problem is we have money to do just about everything she said God will you be merciful to me again merciful to me to fix my refrigerator you know me she said start my refrigerator to freezing again will you said she got up and went and looked in her refrigerator and it was froze around froze around not working it was frozen again immediately God didn't just fix the fridge but he made it effective as if it had been working all along you talk about a restoration of the Bride tree if he can do that to a refrigerator Church what can he do to a bride of Christ that's submitted to him and calling on his name for the for the help that she needs in her life brother Robin says be simple just ask just ask we sing that song if it matters to you it matters to the master just ask don't try to figure it out don't try to study it some of us that's what we do we try and run it down through 83 scriptures that's okay but don't that's not what's going to make it happen he says don't try to study it just believe it don't mentally figure it out just believe it with your soul then he goes into prayer he says our heavenly father many raise their hands this morning they want prayer do you want prayer this morning he says I pray God that this will be the final touch today they won't reason anymore they'll go believing Grant it Lord he says it's a certain sound it's the gospel sound the Glorious Jubilee year the time of Deliverance is here may God bless you let's Stand Together you notice how he says it's a certain sound not every service is for every one of us sometimes it's a certain sound for that certain one that needs it that day and there'll be something here and there I believe you can sit under the preaching of the word and you can get something from it no matter what but sometimes it's a sound for that one for that one that just needs that little that little nudge that little help that little emphasis in their their area that they're dealing with that that encouragement that they need that boost or sometimes that rebuke whatever it might be but there's a certain sound that's supposed to come forth and when you hear that sound you're supposed to say this is my day this is my time this is my hour this is my place in the holy spirit's here brother Brown says don't miss it I didn't put it up here just because I knew we didn't want to run too long but he says he says what's it trying to tell you church he says receive it receive it that's always it's all God wants us to do is receive the word he's given to us and if we receive it in a heart of faith in a ground that's prepared not just in the service but throughout the entire work then you start to watch God you start to see those plants coming up and you start to see the fruit of the spirit in your life and all of a sudden you start getting more victories and less failures not that you never fail not you don't have faults but the victories start to build up and the failures start to diminish why because the fruit of the spirit is coming out and Satan can't abide the fruit of the spirit he can't abide it when the word is living in your life and then we're trying to get it out of our heads trying to get it down into our hearts and just receive it simply how do you write was a simple woman I don't think Hattie Wright could tell you what the opening of the word was I don't think she could explain the Seven Seals but she said that ain't nothing but the truth what does she do she simply accepted it and believed it and that angel said you can have whatever you want you speak it and it'll happen right here right now and she went for something of Eternal value and I think that proved what was really in her heart in the first place was that she didn't ask for the life of her sister and she didn't ask for the millions of dollars or a life of ease but she said I want salvation for my two sons and they fell down on their knees and repented right there amen God wants us to have the things of spiritual value not just big homes not just nice cars not just a comfortable life not just money to fix our refrigerators but he wants us to live in a reality of his word doing what it says in our life every day I think there's got to be more coming there's got to be more pressure coming because we have it pretty easy today compared to so many brother Joe going to Tanzania and you you see all these the way the people live there and the churches and these different things and you say wow they got to live in a different level of faith for a lot of the things they deal with they can they don't have medicine that'll go and take care of cancer they don't have a fallback for education or or welfare these different things we have so many Nets and protections we have so many programs to keep us from failing sometimes it's that we have to fail so that we can see the need for God sometimes that's all he's doing is he's letting us fail to say there's more for you stop relying on yourself and start believing in me son Let It Go daughter and just watch what I'll do in your life amen let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord perhaps a more somber moment considering we're preaching on your Jubilee but Lord we want to encourage us to not just sit there but and I'm speaking to myself not just to sit or stand here and Nod our heads Lord but that it would be the engrafted word in our hearts Heavenly Father Lord that it will be something real in our lives Lord Jesus that your Holy Spirit Lord will be a quickening power within us Lord that it would get our mouths to say the same thing or the right things of your word Lord in that it'll take it into a heart of Faith Lord and that your word would go out and have an effect in our lives we pray so Lord we lift up this people this morning Lord and as we go to take communion Lord we bow our heads and we say Lord forgive us Lord forgive us for our lack of Faith Lord forgive us for taking the steering wheel into our hands Lord forgive us for trying to push you along to try and figure out your work and make it happen our way but Lord would you help us to trust the new Lord in the promises of your word Lord that when you said you will do you will complete it Lord that you'll finish the work that you started well then you do all things well in your time lord just minister to us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen let's sing that song My Hope Is in the Lord 1088.

Paul says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread Community is not just and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord foreign for he that eateth and drinketh them worthily eat it and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged that's the examination of the word when the Holy Spirit comes in that's what he's talking about not looking to the brother or the sister next to us but to look in there and say that's me Lord let the word let the word correct me and then it can have an effect amen continue on verse 32. wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come knock together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen let's just sing that

scripture says in John chapter 13 says now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end many held nothing back and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot silent son to portray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith to him Lord thus thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not only not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus saith to him he that is wash needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all communions and communion is a showdown time and sometimes we walk in and maybe we don't feel so clean Jesus said you're going to get dirty walk in this world you're going to get dirty walking through life he says but he says he that's washed when you've been Washed by the Water of the world when you've been cleansed by the Holy Spirit he says people like that they only need to wash their feet he says you're clean in every way but your feet they get dirty just living life he says and that's why I have to come in and clean you just to get the stuff that gets on you as you're walking around this world so don't let that hold you back that's what this is this is a showdown this is where you judge yourself by the word and you say Lord that's me I need some things cleaned out of my life amen says for he knew who should betray him therefore he said ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye would I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet he also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if ye do them amen we're going to go to foot washing now so the sisters will go out the back and the brothers will stay in here for those that haven't been here but
