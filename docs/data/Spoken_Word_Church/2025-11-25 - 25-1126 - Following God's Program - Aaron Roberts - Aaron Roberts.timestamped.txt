[18:39] precious brother and we look forward to
[18:42] him being here for watch night service
[18:43] and always have a good time at watch
[18:46] night service. I've always enjoyed it
[18:48] and just thank God for all these
[18:50] blessings. If you have your Bibles
[18:51] tonight we're going to go to the book of
[18:53] Hosea chapter 6
[18:56] and begin at verse one.
[18:58] familiar scripture tonight
[19:01] and uh entitled this uh following God's
[19:04] program
[19:06] and uh you know last last time we
[19:08] preached on the path of life and uh
[19:12] David said thou will show me the path of
[19:14] life. Well, if the Lord's going to show
[19:17] you the path to walk now you got to
[19:19] follow the path that God lays before you
[19:22] and just walk the way the path that he
[19:24] has for us.
[19:27] And
[19:29] So before we read the scripture tonight,
[19:30] let's just all pray. Heavenly Father, we
[19:32] thank you for this day, Lord. All your
[19:34] blessings on us. And Lord, we just pray
[19:36] that you just come speak to us tonight.
[19:38] Lord, help us. Lord, just say something
[19:40] that be edifying to the body. And Lord,
[19:43] just minister to each one that's here.
[19:44] Lord, those that are not here, whatever
[19:46] the needs are, Lord, we just commit them
[19:49] to you in the name of Jesus. We just
[19:51] pray that everything is said for your
[19:53] honor and glory in the name of Jesus
[19:55] Christ. Amen.
[19:57] Hosea
[19:59] 6 verse one
[20:03] it says come let us return unto the Lord
[20:07] for he hath torn and he will heal us. He
[20:10] hath smitten and he will bind us up.
[20:11] After two days he will revive us and the
[20:14] third day he will raise us up and we
[20:17] shall live in his sight. Then shall we
[20:20] know, if we follow on to know the Lord,
[20:22] his going forth is prepared as the
[20:25] morning, and he shall and he shall come
[20:27] unto us as the rain, as the latter and
[20:30] former reign unto the earth. Amen. God
[20:33] bless you. You may be seated.
[20:36] And
[20:39] we know this is a this is a prophecy to
[20:42] Israel. That's right.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; And
[20:47] we realize that this prophecy was given
[20:49] unto them that the Lord that he says let
[20:54] us return to the Lord. And he said after
[20:57] two days he will revive us and the third
[20:59] day he will raise us up. We know that's
[21:02] a prophecy to them but it's also a
[21:03] prophecy to us in the end time that that
[21:07] because we are a spiritual type of
[21:08] Israel. So we understand that the word
[21:10] comes and there's going to be a
[21:12] restoration to us. And then he says,
[21:14] "And we shall know if we follow on to
[21:16] know the Lord
[21:18] &gt;&gt; if we follow what the Lord has for us."
[21:20] And you know, as as we were saying last
[21:22] time, you know, if if you know the path
[21:24] that he's going to show you, the path
[21:26] that he wants you to walk, the path of
[21:28] life, the path of eternal life for us to
[21:30] go down, then if we follow that, then if
[21:34] we walk in the path that God has for us,
[21:37] if we just continue on into that, then
[21:40] God will bless us and we'll be blessed
[21:42] in everything that we have.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; And this is uh I want to start out with
[21:48] this. This is a this is a quote from the
[21:50] message God hath a provided way and and
[21:52] and brother Brandham here he's he's
[21:54] speaking of children raising children
[21:59] and you know talking about uh you know
[22:01] God provided a a way for babies to get
[22:04] what they need and ask for them to cry
[22:07] you know he was talking about you know
[22:09] uh you know we're a modern family and
[22:11] you know just ring the bell junior and
[22:12] well you know what babies ain't going to
[22:14] ring no bell you know there's one thing
[22:16] they going they're going to exercise
[22:17] their lungs to full capacity to get what
[22:20] they need. And that's God's provided way
[22:22] for them.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; And you know, he was talking about
[22:26] raising children and he was talking
[22:28] about Joseph and he was talking about,
[22:31] you know, he said Joseph was really
[22:33] spoiled because, you know, everybody the
[22:35] way everybody had treated him. And he
[22:38] says, he said, "But I would rather have
[22:40] him that way. I believe it'll make him a
[22:42] better man out of him if God lets him
[22:45] live than to let him scream and cry and
[22:48] upset his little self. He said a few
[22:51] years ago, some mo normal, listen,
[22:53] normal modern witch doctor said, "Let
[22:56] that baby cry. Don't pick it up." He
[22:59] said, "All things like that, don't let
[23:01] grandma touch it." And you know what
[23:03] they hatched out? You see what it is? A
[23:06] juvenile delinquency.
[23:08] a bunch of neurotics. God made a baby to
[23:12] be loved. That's why he made a mother to
[23:14] love a baby. That's why we are supposed
[23:17] to be this way.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; God made it that way.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; And anytime that you upset God's
[23:24] program, you must remember you're wrong
[23:27] and will be wrong
[23:29] as long as you're upsetting God's
[23:31] program.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Follow God's program.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Do it the way God said to do it.
[23:38] And so, you know, whatever God's program
[23:41] is, whatever whatever God has us for us
[23:43] to do, then we're to follow that
[23:46] &gt;&gt; because there's only one way that God
[23:48] provided for anything, and that's by the
[23:51] word.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; And you know, many times, you know, we
[23:54] we have a a way of trying to come up
[23:57] with our own ideas or, you know, what
[23:59] whatever the whatever the doctors have
[24:01] said, the psychologist, the
[24:03] psychiatrist, you know, the modern day
[24:05] world says. But you know what? It's if
[24:07] whatever we have need of in this life,
[24:10] whatever God has for us, he's given to
[24:12] us in the word of God.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; It's all right here for whatever we have
[24:16] need of for us in this journey has been
[24:17] given to us in the word.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; And so we have everything.
[24:22] And so if we'll just follow what God has
[24:24] for us, then we we'll be successful.
[24:28] And you know, there's many things that
[24:30] that God has for us that he wants us to
[24:32] go, but we've got to follow that path.
[24:36] There's a path that he and brother
[24:39] brother Emanuel read my scripture Sunday
[24:41] in in Sunday school and after church I
[24:44] didn't say nothing to him but uh
[24:46] Jeremiah 6:16 you know he was reading
[24:50] this he said thus sayith the Lord he
[24:52] said stand in the ways
[24:55] and see and ask for the old paths where
[24:58] is the good way and walk therein and ye
[25:02] shall find rest for your souls and they
[25:04] said we will not walk therein'
[25:06] That's right.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; But you know, everything that they had
[25:09] need of was right there.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; When the prophet Jeremiah was speaking
[25:13] to the children of Israel and telling
[25:14] them this is what God, he said, "Stand
[25:16] in the ways in the ways that you know."
[25:19] And he said, "And ask for the old paths
[25:22] &gt;&gt; because to carry you right back to the
[25:24] place that God started you on
[25:26] &gt;&gt; to the to the place that your fathers
[25:28] and your forefathers were to go right
[25:30] back to that." And it was to you
[25:34] &gt;&gt; because it's the exact same thing that
[25:37] when the when Peter and the 11 stood up
[25:39] on the day of Pentecost when the Holy
[25:41] Spirit came upon them, it was the exact
[25:43] same message that they came out and said
[25:45] this is these men are not drunk as you
[25:47] suppose. But he said this is that what
[25:50] the prophet had spoken unto them.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; And he said to carry you right back. He
[25:54] said, "I will pour out my spirit upon
[25:56] all flesh, and it's unto you and to your
[25:59] children, and to them that's a far off,
[26:01] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[26:03] call." So, it's unto everybody. And so,
[26:06] it's just like to them, the children of
[26:08] Israel, Jeremiah is calling out to them
[26:10] that God has a place for you, a plan for
[26:13] you, and a path for you to walk in. And
[26:15] they said, "We won't do it."
[26:17] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it didn't fit their plan.
[26:19] It they didn't like it. But you know
[26:22] what? It was a perfect way for them
[26:25] because they knew exactly the path that
[26:28] their fathers had walked. They knew
[26:30] exactly the path that their forefathers
[26:32] had walked. They knew every victory they
[26:34] had, but they knew every defeat.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; They knew every stumbling that they had.
[26:39] They knew every bondage that they had
[26:41] went through. They they had seen all of
[26:44] all of the turmoil and everything that
[26:45] they had been through. And Jeremiah is
[26:47] crying out saying, "Guess what? You got
[26:49] a path to walk. You've got a victory to
[26:51] overcome. You've got all these blessings
[26:53] of God. But you will not do that.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; But it was laid out before him.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; So whatever we have, you know,
[27:05] everything that we have need of is given
[27:07] to us in this earthly journey. The word
[27:10] is given to us
[27:12] &gt;&gt; and all you got to do is follow it.
[27:15] But you know many times you know we we
[27:18] for different reasons whatever whatever
[27:20] the reasons may be you know we have
[27:23] different things that that we face from
[27:25] our from our lifetime.
[27:29] You know you know every brother called
[27:32] it the the human grab bag. You know we
[27:35] all we all suffer from different things.
[27:38] We all carry baggage and you know our
[27:40] our personalities are different and all
[27:42] these different things that we carry you
[27:44] and you know we all battle different
[27:46] different things and you know some
[27:48] people they don't they don't have to
[27:49] battle depression other people know what
[27:52] what depression is and you know you know
[27:55] if for some people you know it's almost
[27:58] debilitating
[28:00] and you know um I I've told this story
[28:04] before but I I was everybody knows my
[28:08] birthday is February 12th. I was born on
[28:10] Abraham Lincoln's birthday. And you
[28:12] know, I'm
[28:14] not saying that I'm a lot like that, but
[28:16] but there's traits that I have that I
[28:19] see in Abraham Lincoln. And what was
[28:22] when I was younger, I was reading all
[28:23] these books because anything had Abraham
[28:25] Lincoln, it was I was reading it. I I
[28:27] just So that was that was I was my hero.
[28:28] That was my idol. And you know, I just
[28:30] like, you know, I just I just loved
[28:33] everything about him. Brother Ram said,
[28:34] you know, greatest president we had and
[28:36] all that.
[28:37] You know what a great Christian, godly
[28:39] man we had. Well, you know, I got to
[28:42] reading about things that he had battled
[28:43] in his life and everything like that.
[28:45] And you know, there's certain things
[28:46] that I saw in his life in the writings
[28:48] and stories. And it's like, you know, it
[28:51] began for it was through that I began to
[28:54] understand my my personality. There were
[28:57] things about me that I understood
[28:59] because I I see these things and they
[29:01] talk about you know he went through
[29:02] periods of being melancholy and all
[29:04] these different things and you know uh
[29:06] different types different things in your
[29:08] personality you know the way being very
[29:11] studious and and just different things
[29:12] that he had went through in his life and
[29:14] the way approached things and it was
[29:16] like you know that that meant something
[29:17] to me because I I you know I was like I
[29:20] I connect to that I see that and you
[29:22] know sometime you know it's just because
[29:24] of the the sign that you're born under
[29:25] and all those type things, but you know,
[29:27] you you go through all of those things
[29:29] and you you have to overcome those and
[29:31] you deal with these things and everybody
[29:32] deals with different things, but you
[29:34] know, God get put you in in a certain
[29:37] place. You know, he brought you into
[29:38] this place. You you have all of the
[29:41] characteristics that God wanted you to
[29:42] have. And you know, sometimes I I I look
[29:45] in the mirror and I'm thinking, why did
[29:46] God want me to have this? You know, and
[29:48] it's like, I don't see a benefit to
[29:50] that. But you know somewhere down the
[29:52] line it will be a benefit to you because
[29:54] you know you are made uniquely. You are
[29:57] made in God's image and everything about
[29:59] you is exactly the way God wanted you to
[30:01] be.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; You you think about I think it's I think
[30:04] it's 10 generations if you count back
[30:06] all your direct in descendants and y'all
[30:08] may y'all can check my math on this
[30:10] because but I think there like 4,000
[30:14] if you count back your generations.
[30:17] every generation. I think that if you
[30:18] count 10 generations backs like 4,000.
[30:22] You got to think that's four over 4,000
[30:25] people that had to go through famines
[30:29] and fires and wars
[30:34] and everything imaginable for that
[30:37] person. And they had to travel distances
[30:39] and all those things
[30:42] for those people to come together
[30:46] &gt;&gt; for the for for your great great great
[30:48] great great great grandmother
[30:51] to meet her husband.
[30:54] And you know, then you start thinking
[30:55] about, you know, way back on the other
[30:58] side of the ocean in England and Ireland
[31:00] and all these things and all the things
[31:02] that they had to go through
[31:05] for them to meet
[31:07] and then have children and all the
[31:10] things that they had to go through.
[31:13] Then they had to travel across the
[31:15] ocean.
[31:17] And then you think of all the journeys
[31:19] that your families had had to go
[31:21] through.
[31:24] You think about all of the things that
[31:25] they you know and you it's like I always
[31:28] think about my grandfather you know
[31:30] being in World War II and you know he
[31:32] was standing there
[31:35] you know he landed in I believe it was
[31:38] France Richard may remember it more than
[31:40] me but when he landed in France
[31:45] there was 50s something men hit that
[31:47] beach
[31:49] and there's only two of them that
[31:50] survived him and the man next to him
[31:56] when he was standing there and my
[31:58] great-grandmother was praying when he
[32:00] was when he was in combat and he said he
[32:03] said he heard the he said I heard the
[32:05] bullets going all around me. There's
[32:07] nothing between him and the enemy.
[32:10] But he said, I could hear the the
[32:12] machine guns, the bullets going to the
[32:15] left and to the right.
[32:18] And him standing there and saying, I
[32:20] don't know about y'all, but he said,
[32:21] "The angel of the Lord was standing in
[32:23] front of me to see the bullets go to the
[32:26] left and to the right."
[32:30] And all of the things that that that he
[32:31] had went through,
[32:33] he got left. He got they they were in
[32:36] snow
[32:38] and it might have been France. I'm not
[32:40] exactly sure where they they were in
[32:41] Europe. But uh they all hunched down in
[32:44] a ditch and went to sleep and the snow
[32:47] fell on him. And when he woke up, he was
[32:50] by himself.
[32:52] He was still covered up. When they woke
[32:53] up all the rest of the soldiers and left
[32:55] in the middle of the night, they left
[32:56] him in the ditch in the snow.
[32:59] and he got up and started
[33:03] trying to sneak around and thank God he
[33:06] was able to get back to the allies to
[33:09] figure out where his unit was. But all
[33:12] the things that he come through
[33:14] and you you look at your family, all of
[33:16] those that came through all of those
[33:19] things to bring you to the place where
[33:22] and you know you think one person, one
[33:25] person out of cater and you're and
[33:28] you're not the person,
[33:30] but you know, you think that was what
[33:32] God had in his mind in the beginning. He
[33:34] saw you in the beginning.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you are today exactly the
[33:40] picture of God in his mind.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; And it came all the way through to get
[33:44] to you right today.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; And if and if and if he remembers if he
[33:51] saw that and you're here today, then you
[33:53] know what? If he brought you to this
[33:54] place, then how much more when you think
[33:58] of the astronomical amount of work that
[34:01] it took?
[34:04] Then how much more is he going to carry
[34:05] you all the way? Amen.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Because there was one day that he knew
[34:10] that you were going to receive eternal
[34:12] life, that you were going to receive the
[34:14] word
[34:15] &gt;&gt; and that he brought you the way that he
[34:17] wanted you to look.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Whether whether we like it or not, all
[34:21] our faults and failures, our blemishes,
[34:23] but that's the way God wanted us to be.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; And now we have come to the place that
[34:29] God wants us to be.
[34:32] Then if God has done all that to bring
[34:34] us to this place, then how much more is
[34:36] he going to carry you all the way?
[34:39] &gt;&gt; That you've got that you've got a place
[34:41] to go. You've got a role to do.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; You've got a you've got a part to play
[34:45] in this.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; God's not God's not complete without
[34:49] you.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes sometimes we think, well,
[34:54] you know,
[34:56] we're not all that important.
[35:00] Well, you may you may try to find a
[35:02] piece of paper and
[35:05] try to write down,
[35:08] you know,
[35:09] what what what's great about me or, you
[35:11] know, whatever. But, you know, you're
[35:13] important to God.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; You're great to God
[35:17] &gt;&gt; because you know what? If if if you and
[35:20] I if it was just one,
[35:22] if there was just one lost, then he
[35:25] would have went to Calvary just for that
[35:27] one.
[35:28] Amen.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; The plan of salvation would have just
[35:32] been for one
[35:36] &gt;&gt; that he would have he would have done
[35:37] that for you and I.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; That if he would have done that for you
[35:44] that he thought of you
[35:46] when he was on the cross I was on his
[35:49] mind.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; When he was on the cross he done this
[35:52] just for me.
[35:55] when he when he went down through all
[35:57] that and knew what he would suffer,
[36:01] knew what was going to take place,
[36:04] knew they would spit in his face and
[36:06] pull his beard out,
[36:09] knew that his friends would turn their
[36:11] backs on him.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; And you know what? He didn't reject
[36:14] them. All the things that he knew that
[36:17] was going to take place, all the stripes
[36:18] he was going to take on his back for
[36:20] your healing.
[36:26] would stand there and be ash put put to
[36:28] an open shame for you and I.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; No wonder Paul said, "I'm not ashamed of
[36:36] the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he stood for me
[36:43] when I when I was when I was nothing.
[36:45] When I was lost and undone and had no
[36:47] hope, he was my hope.
[36:50] He was the one that came to find me,
[36:54] &gt;&gt; to bring me back into fellowship with
[36:56] him.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; What a thanksgiving we got.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; We can give God thanks for what he's
[37:11] done for us. Amen.
[37:14] [applause]
[37:18] &gt;&gt; And you know what? All you all he has to
[37:20] have is a willing vessel.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; That's all he needs is somebody to be
[37:24] willing. You don't have to you don't
[37:26] have to be great because you know we
[37:27] cannot do the plan of God by ourselves.
[37:29] But he said greater is he that sent us
[37:31] than he that's in the world.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; You know what he's he's got he gives you
[37:35] the strength to do it.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know about y'all. I might run
[37:41] around for a little bit or jump up and
[37:43] down or something, [snorts]
[37:47] &gt;&gt; you know, because when you realize what
[37:48] God's done for you, you can try to talk
[37:51] to the world about it and the world
[37:53] don't understand it, but that's all
[37:56] right. They call us crazy if they want
[37:58] to, but
[37:59] &gt;&gt; that's all right. I'm I'm having a good
[38:01] time.
[38:04] You know, I was I was I was listening to
[38:06] a man just recently,
[38:08] and you know, when you see the things
[38:10] what God has done for you and and God's
[38:12] called you to do something, you're
[38:14] important in God's plan and and there's
[38:16] a purpose and everything for you. And
[38:18] you know, we we we try to sometimes we
[38:21] think that we're not well, I'm not as
[38:24] good as somebody else or I don't. But
[38:25] you know what? Find your place.
[38:28] Whatever your place is, that's what God
[38:30] wants you to be. I want to be I want to
[38:33] be the best Aaron Roberts that I can be
[38:36] &gt;&gt; because you know I can't be anybody
[38:38] else.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; I'd ra I'd rather I'd rather be a poor
[38:42] original than a good impostor
[38:47] &gt;&gt; or a good counterfeit
[38:50] &gt;&gt; or a good reproduction.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Because God don't use reproductions.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; He wants you to be him made manifest.
[39:02] And so if you understand that who you
[39:04] are and what God wants us to do,
[39:07] you know, we understand what God has
[39:09] called us to do. But I was listening to
[39:12] this man. He was talking about he was uh
[39:16] his church has what they what they call
[39:20] coffee. They call it the coffee
[39:22] ministry.
[39:24] On Sunday mornings, they have coffee and
[39:25] donuts and pastries and all this kind of
[39:27] stuff. He said they were looking for
[39:30] they were looking for volunteers.
[39:33] [snorts]
[39:33] Well, he's an evangelist and he said,
[39:35] "I'm gone three day." He said, "I'm gone
[39:36] three Sundays a month."
[39:39] And he's like, but you know, he said,
[39:40] the Lord kept telling me, he said, "You
[39:42] need to do this. You need to do this."
[39:45] And he was like, "Um,
[39:48] well, that would only be the one Sunday
[39:49] that I'm home a month would be the only
[39:51] Sunday." And he's just like, well, it
[39:54] was really impressive. He said, "The
[39:55] Lord," he said, he told his wife, said,
[39:57] "Hey, we're going to go we're going to
[39:58] go work in the coffee and donut
[39:59] ministry. We've done all kinds of other
[40:01] ministries. We're going to do this one."
[40:03] And he's like, you know, you know, he
[40:05] felt kind of funny getting started doing
[40:08] this. But, you know, he started doing it
[40:10] and you know what he said? He began to
[40:13] be blessed by it. And he said you he
[40:15] began to fellowship with these people
[40:17] and he said God began to minister to
[40:19] people and God began to touch lives and
[40:22] you know you get to know people and all
[40:24] these things that were taking place
[40:25] through this ministry. And he said well
[40:27] you know people think it was just coffee
[40:28] and donuts but he said you begin to have
[40:30] real fellowship and God began to move
[40:32] and was able to minister to people one-
[40:35] on-one. And you know I was thinking
[40:37] about brother Brown I think it was in
[40:38] the in the seals. You know brother Brown
[40:40] was talking about the people he said you
[40:41] know brother Neville and all of them
[40:42] would be at the church there. uh one of
[40:44] the services they were having and you
[40:45] know he was like if you've never been
[40:47] personally ministered to he said just
[40:48] come up to the church we'll be here and
[40:50] you know I was I was thinking about that
[40:52] you know it's it was such a simple thing
[40:55] but you know sometimes that's that's a
[40:56] one way that somebody can reach out that
[40:59] you can reach out to somebody and touch
[41:01] their lives and it it's like it's not
[41:03] very hard and he said he said I I got to
[41:05] the point he said that was a that I just
[41:07] enjoyed that was the favorite part of my
[41:09] day you know was just going to church he
[41:10] said I got up in the morning he said
[41:11] listen I'm going you know I enjoy
[41:13] enjoyed it so much. He said, "Because
[41:14] you think you're blessing people?" He
[41:15] said, "They're blessing me." And he
[41:17] said, "I got excited about going to
[41:19] church just just to help people and have
[41:21] fellowship." And he said, "Man, it was
[41:23] so good." And I I was talking to brother
[41:25] Jason Watkins while we were down there
[41:26] the other week and, you know, talking
[41:27] about having fellowship, you know, and
[41:29] you know, after church, you know,
[41:31] getting together and having fellowship.
[41:33] And he said that's that's such a faith
[41:35] booster. You know, it's such a wonderful
[41:37] thing to have fellowship. And you know,
[41:39] some people they come to church and as
[41:41] soon as the doors are out, you know,
[41:42] they're running to their car, jumping in
[41:44] and heading out the door. It's like, you
[41:46] know what? You're really missing a
[41:47] blessing if you don't get to spend time
[41:49] with your brothers and sisters and have
[41:51] fellowship with one another and gather
[41:53] around and, you know, and and have that
[41:56] fellowship. And it's just a wonderful
[41:57] thing. And he, you know, he said after a
[41:59] while, the the Lord began to deal with
[42:01] him. He's like, "Well, now it's time for
[42:02] you to finish this." And he's like,
[42:03] "Well," he's like, "I've done it for
[42:05] three years." and he's like, "I don't
[42:07] want to stop."
[42:09] And the Lord kept telling him, he said,
[42:10] "Well, you got other things to do, you
[42:13] know, you know, and it's like you go
[42:14] through these these uh periods in your
[42:17] life, you know, these seasons of life."
[42:18] And and he's like, you know, it's time
[42:20] to finish one and do something else. And
[42:22] he said, it's like, you know, you know,
[42:25] the the Lord has to push you into
[42:27] getting something started. And then when
[42:29] you get started, when the Lord wants you
[42:30] to do something else, it's like, you
[42:32] know, you're you're digging your heels
[42:33] and it's like and it's like, you know,
[42:35] you had that same you had that same
[42:37] attitude back here when you started.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; You remember that same attitude where
[42:41] you didn't want to get started and then
[42:43] you get started, now it's time to change
[42:44] to do something else and you want to dig
[42:46] your heels in. It's like, well, now
[42:47] sometimes it's time to change
[42:50] &gt;&gt; because people don't want to change.
[42:52] they they get they get set in their ways
[42:54] and you know it's like well I just want
[42:55] to get be comfortable this way you know
[42:57] but you know you go through seasons of
[42:59] growth in your life and time to times to
[43:01] change and and go through these things.
[43:03] It's like listen you know you think well
[43:05] I I don't want to go through this or
[43:06] whatever but you know you don't realize
[43:08] how much of a blessing you can be by by
[43:10] changing and doing other things because
[43:12] God's called you to do other things.
[43:16] And it's like, well, you know, I I you
[43:17] know, it's my mentality. You know, I
[43:21] have just these certain thoughts. And
[43:22] it's like, no, they whatever God wants
[43:25] you to do,
[43:27] then to be open to that, Lord, I want to
[43:31] do whatever you want me to do.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; And sometimes, you know, we we go
[43:36] through that and it's like, well, I, you
[43:37] know, well, I'm not I'm not the best
[43:39] singer. Well, you know, if you're not
[43:40] the best singer, then you know what?
[43:42] make a joyful noise and and be the be
[43:44] the most joyful noise in the building.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; You know what? And if you if you can't
[43:49] sing, then you know, be at least be
[43:50] encouragement to somebody.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; You know, always have a smile on your
[43:54] face or whatever. You know, whatever you
[43:56] can do, make sure that you're because if
[43:59] something's on the inside and it's got
[44:00] if it's burning, as brother Wes always
[44:02] says, then let it out. You know, if
[44:04] there's something on the inside, then
[44:05] let it out.
[44:09] You know be you know sometimes
[44:13] uh when when this man was was telling
[44:15] about these you know about working and
[44:17] and serving is you know these simple
[44:19] acts we look at as simple acts but he
[44:22] said you know God does great things in
[44:24] simple acts
[44:27] &gt;&gt; and you we think of it just as a simple
[44:29] act but you know what if we don't if we
[44:30] look to see what God's doing we see
[44:32] great things taking place and we miss
[44:35] those things those great things that
[44:37] take place
[44:38] You know, when when we come to church in
[44:40] in in the mornings and
[44:43] you know,
[44:45] I I was listening to him. I was thinking
[44:47] about, you know, when we when we come to
[44:49] church and everybody's like, "Well, you
[44:50] know, I got to wait till the church or
[44:52] or or something." You know, don't miss
[44:54] out on God. I know the devil's going to
[44:56] ride with you on Sunday morning.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; He rides with me. I don't know about
[44:59] about y'all, but he rides with me in the
[45:01] car. And it's and and and it's it's not
[45:03] Sarah.
[45:09] So, I'm I'm I'm gonna put that out there
[45:11] right now.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; And it ain't Levi and it ain't Adam.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; But you know what? The devil likes to
[45:18] ride in the car with you.
[45:21] And sometimes as soon as the alarm clock
[45:23] goes off on Sunday morning, the devil's
[45:24] right there.
[45:27] And he'll fight you all the way.
[45:30] But you know what? And everybody's like,
[45:32] "Well, just we get aggravated about
[45:35] things and upset, but you know what? We
[45:37] also realize God's right there with us,
[45:39] too."
[45:41] &gt;&gt; And he was talking about, you know, if
[45:43] we if we looked at the things correctly,
[45:45] the devil's trying to hinder you, but
[45:46] you know what? You don't have to come to
[45:48] church, even though hearing the hearing
[45:50] the word preached, you know, you can
[45:52] receive your healing while the while the
[45:53] word's being preached.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; But you know what? You can get healed in
[45:57] the car on the way to church in the
[45:58] morning
[46:00] &gt;&gt; when the devil's out there trying to
[46:02] stop you on Sunday morning and the
[46:03] Lord's right there with you. If you
[46:05] realize the that God's right there and
[46:07] he's trying to talk to you, that's the
[46:08] reason that the devil's trying to hinder
[46:10] you.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; You wake up in the morning say, "Oh, I
[46:14] got such a headache. My knees bothering
[46:16] me." Everything like that. You know
[46:17] what? The angel of the Lord's right
[46:19] there to touch you.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; He's right there to minister to your
[46:22] need. And you don't have to come to
[46:23] church, stand in the church building.
[46:24] You don't have to come up and have hands
[46:26] laid on you or anything like that. You
[46:27] know what? Because he can touch you in
[46:29] the car.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; But where what's the first thing you do?
[46:33] You get in the car. You start going down
[46:35] the road. And then you start thinking on
[46:37] the good things of God. You start
[46:38] thinking of you thank God. I thank God I
[46:41] got up this morning. As brother Wade was
[46:44] talking about them the list of devils
[46:47] that ride with you. You know, the coffee
[46:51] wasn't good this morning. and you know
[46:53] this didn't work out and that didn't
[46:55] work out and whatever else you know I
[46:57] couldn't find my shoes they can't find
[46:59] the boys can't find their shoes or or
[47:02] whatever else is not going on you know
[47:04] we ain't got no gas in the car whatever
[47:05] the devil puts in your way but you know
[47:08] what say well you know what I've seen
[47:11] people they didn't have gas in their car
[47:13] get in their car and crank the car and
[47:16] they didn't have a way but you know what
[47:18] they got in their car cranked it and
[47:19] drove all the way to church with no gas
[47:26] I've seen people's car break down
[47:29] &gt;&gt; and God fix their car.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; I've seen supernatural things happen.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; But you know what? It's like we get we
[47:38] get Well, you know what?
[47:41] Well, we're just going to go to church.
[47:43] Brother Wade's going to get up here and
[47:46] he's just going to say pretty much what
[47:48] he said Wednesday night. or he's going
[47:50] to get up and he's just going to get on
[47:51] my he gonna get on my step on my toes or
[47:54] whatever else
[47:57] and not realizing
[48:00] that when you come to church Sunday
[48:01] morning,
[48:03] the creator of heaven and earth
[48:06] is coming to meet with you
[48:09] &gt;&gt; and SPEAK TO YOU.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[48:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT IT'S NOT HIM JUST coming and
[48:16] taking a scripture and reading it, but
[48:18] he's coming to speak into your life
[48:20] &gt;&gt; what you have need of
[48:22] &gt;&gt; for you to receive it.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; And he's reading the wheel that tells
[48:27] you who you are
[48:30] &gt;&gt; and what you're what your inheritance
[48:32] is.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; And the devil don't want you to hear
[48:36] that. and he wants you to come in and
[48:39] carry this big boulder on your shoulder
[48:41] as you walk around. But you know what?
[48:43] If because you know people don't have
[48:44] chips on their shoulder anymore,
[48:48] &gt;&gt; chips are too small.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; They got boulders on their shoulders.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; But it's time to GET THAT OFF. BUT YOU
[48:57] COME IN THE IN THE HOUSE of God and
[48:59] realize, you know what?
[49:01] I've come in the presence of God and
[49:03] he's here to meet with me.
[49:05] And not really because you know a lot of
[49:07] people say, "Well, I wonder if I'm going
[49:08] to hear from God today.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; You know who's tell who you know who's
[49:12] talking to you?
[49:15] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; The liar.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, are you going to hear?" Absolutely.
[49:23] You're going to hear from God.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; The question is, are you gonna receive
[49:27] anything from it?
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Are you gonna get under the spout where
[49:32] the glory comes out? Are you gonna sit
[49:34] around with a long face and pout?
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? It's up to you
[49:41] whether you gonna receive it or not.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; But you can receive whatever you have
[49:45] need of.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is get there.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Well, thank God I'm I'm going. And if
[49:55] and if nobody else goes, I'm going to go
[49:57] and I'm gonna get my portion.
[50:00] I'm g I'm gonna soak it all up and I'm
[50:03] I'm I'm just because you know if you
[50:05] think about it you come to church
[50:08] you know you go to a ball game and you
[50:10] know you don't see all these long faces
[50:15] &gt;&gt; and you know what they come they come
[50:17] they come for a ball game.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Me and Adam went to a ball game the
[50:22] other day. I ain't never I ain't never
[50:24] seen so many people dressed like that
[50:26] before.
[50:28] But you know what? They were excited to
[50:30] be there.
[50:34] And you know what? Everybody,
[50:36] well, we're here to watch a ball game.
[50:41] Well, you know, if people get excited
[50:43] about that, then you know what? If you
[50:44] come, if you knew that the God of heaven
[50:47] and earth
[50:48] &gt;&gt; was coming to speak to you this morning,
[50:50] you know, because if you everybody say,
[50:52] "Oh, boy." You know, if Jesus was here
[50:53] this morning, I'd be here with bells on.
[50:55] Be ready to hear from him.
[50:59] There's people said, "You know what? If
[51:00] if if I could if I could get an
[51:02] interview with Brother Brandham, if
[51:04] Brother Brandham was here and I could
[51:05] and I could and I could have a personal
[51:07] interview with Brother Brandham, you
[51:08] know what? I'd go anywhere in the world.
[51:10] I I'd do whatever I could to get there.
[51:14] Do you know that the God of heaven and
[51:16] earth will meet you wherever you are
[51:21] &gt;&gt; in your house?" Amen.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; And lots of times he speaks to us
[51:27] and we miss him
[51:29] &gt;&gt; and we don't listen.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we fail to realize that
[51:37] God's trying to speak to us.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's because we don't like
[51:41] the vessel that is coming through
[51:45] &gt;&gt; because we're not listening to the word.
[51:48] We're looking at personalities.
[51:53] And we wonder why we have problems and
[51:55] why we're hindered.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Well, Lord, I don't care who if you
[51:59] speak through the donkey, through the
[52:01] wind, whoever it is, Lord, if you're
[52:04] speaking to me, I want you to hear. I
[52:05] want I want to be conscious enough.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; I want to be spiritual enough to realize
[52:11] that you're speaking to me.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to miss
[52:15] out.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; I want to receive what you have for me.
[52:23] See, if you if you receive, think about
[52:25] that. You come in the house of God,
[52:27] well, you know, if you get on fire,
[52:28] somebody else will get on fire.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; You know, like they always say, if
[52:37] there's fire in the pull pit, there's
[52:38] smoke in the pews.
[52:41] Not any fire extinguishers or wet
[52:43] blankets.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; But you know what? If you come in the
[52:46] house of God, if you get on fire, you
[52:48] know what? Somebody else going to get on
[52:49] fire, too.
[52:52] It starts with one person. You know,
[52:54] every every great revival started with
[52:55] one person.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; You know, it ain't never, as far as I
[52:59] know, unless somebody can tell me
[53:00] different, I've never se I've never seen
[53:02] a revival start anywhere by committee.
[53:10] It takes one person to get out of their
[53:13] comfort zone, to get over themselves, to
[53:15] get to the place where they get in the
[53:16] spirit. And when they get in the spirit
[53:18] and they get on fire, then you know
[53:19] what? Everybody else will get on fire,
[53:20] too.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; If we get in one If we get in one mind
[53:25] and one accord, then you know what? It
[53:27] It's not It's not hard to preach,
[53:28] Brother Wade. When when everybody's
[53:30] pulling in the same direction,
[53:36] &gt;&gt; if we realize that God's come to speak
[53:38] to us today, then you know what it we we
[53:41] all get excited.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; If we was passing out $100 bills, people
[53:47] get excited.
[53:52] You know, it was so funny. I was I was
[53:53] thinking of Mercy. I was
[53:56] How's she doing? I know she had oral
[53:58] surgery today. Well, good. Mercy's
[54:01] listening in. But, you know, I was when
[54:04] I preached on phobias, you know, being
[54:06] fearless in a world of fear.
[54:10] You know, we we live in a world of fear.
[54:12] So many people out there in the in the
[54:14] world and they got and they they write
[54:15] great big books on all the phobias and
[54:19] everything you can think of people's
[54:20] afraid of.
[54:24] And if and if you can think of it,
[54:26] somebody's afraid of it.
[54:31] You know, and you begin to look at some
[54:34] of these things and it's like, you know,
[54:36] what is a phobia? It's a rational fear.
[54:40] is something that can't hurt you. You
[54:41] know, one one of the one of the most
[54:43] fascinating ones that that I I found was
[54:45] that there there's people that's a that
[54:47] that's that's has a phobia that's afraid
[54:50] of the cotton bowl that's in medicine
[54:52] bottles.
[54:56] No joke.
[55:00] I've been I' I've been afraid of a lot
[55:02] of things. I ain't never I ain't never
[55:04] been afraid of a cotton bowl,
[55:09] but I mean there was a there was a lady
[55:11] that that she went she she wanted to be
[55:13] a school teacher, elementary school
[55:15] teacher, and she couldn't she couldn't
[55:17] touch a cotton ball and they tried to
[55:19] get her touch cotton ball. She started
[55:21] sweating
[55:23] almost hyperventilating over a cotton
[55:24] ball
[55:27] and she went she went to go have
[55:28] treatment so she could be a school
[55:30] teacher.
[55:32] I was like, you know, I would I you
[55:34] know, my my you know, I have a health I
[55:36] have a healthy fear of being in the
[55:38] woods and uh something bigger than me
[55:42] coming at me,
[55:44] you know, great big long snakes. Little
[55:47] snakes don't bother me,
[55:50] you know, bears or anything like that.
[55:54] You know, something that may eat me, I
[55:57] have a problem with that.
[56:00] But, you know, I mean, there's a lot of
[56:02] things that that I that I'm not afraid
[56:03] of,
[56:05] you know, but you know, you you but you
[56:07] go through there's people that are
[56:09] afraid of colors and butterflies and all
[56:12] these little things and it's like, you
[56:13] know what, I've had I've had all kinds
[56:15] of bugs on me. You know, I've had ticks
[56:18] and everything else like that and I
[56:20] ain't never I ain't never had have go
[56:22] hyperventilating
[56:24] over over something on me.
[56:28] But you but you see all these people
[56:29] that they live in they live in this
[56:31] world
[56:33] and and it's and it's so so
[56:36] unbelievable. But you know to them
[56:37] that's that's real. I mean hey they
[56:41] wouldn't touch it certain colors or
[56:43] whatever
[56:45] they they they'd die first.
[56:49] But I was talking about mercy you know
[56:51] and you know you know she hated she
[56:53] hates a crowd. you know, years ago, she
[56:56] had to get in front of people. And I
[56:58] called her up here that time, you know,
[57:01] I wanted her to stand up here in the
[57:02] front. I was like, "You don't like being
[57:04] up here, do you?"
[57:08] She want to be up here. No. But, you
[57:10] know, I was I was talking about her
[57:11] being up here. I was like, you know,
[57:12] being fearless in a world of fear. And I
[57:14] said, "The reason she came up here was
[57:16] because I asked her to.
[57:19] I I asked her and she came up here
[57:22] because of me." And she stood right here
[57:25] and I told her, I said, 'If you look at
[57:26] all these people, and I said, 'If you
[57:28] realize how much these people love you
[57:30] and these people are in your corner
[57:32] &gt;&gt; and these people are all for you. And I
[57:36] said, these people pray for you. I said,
[57:38] if you begin to look at that, you'll see
[57:40] things differently.
[57:43] And I and I I I brought up here for that
[57:45] for that reason. And what I had was I
[57:47] had money. I give it to her because I
[57:49] said, "You done something for me because
[57:51] I asked you, but you didn't realize that
[57:55] there's something greater beyond this
[57:57] because of what you done.
[57:59] There's a greater blessing in it that
[58:01] she didn't see, but she answered the
[58:04] call." And she went and done what I
[58:06] asked her to do because of her because
[58:09] of what because of her love for me,
[58:12] because what she thinks of me, she would
[58:14] do that.
[58:16] And I was like, "Here you go."
[58:19] Well, as soon as I give her that money,
[58:22] there's certain people in this building.
[58:27] Namely, Brother Louise.
[58:30] Brother Luis. He was ready to jump up.
[58:32] Brother, I'll come help you.
[58:41] That's right.
[58:43] I say I say I sing that. He said, "Hey,"
[58:45] he's like, he said, "Yes,
[58:48] President President Jackson changed his
[58:50] mind."
[58:53] He s He saw that and he's like, "Hey,
[58:55] you know, I I feel the call now."
[58:59] But you know what? If you do that, then
[59:02] you know what? God will use you. And
[59:03] then all of a sudden, other people will
[59:05] begin to do the same thing.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; It's like, "Well, well, I don't know
[59:11] about doing this." Or you know what? If
[59:14] you step out on faith,
[59:18] how many people are in the scripture
[59:19] today that we read in the scripture that
[59:21] we that they there's no scripture that
[59:24] says that if you touch the hem of Jesus'
[59:26] garment that you'll be made whole.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; As far as I know, there ain't no
[59:31] scripture. But you know what she said
[59:33] inside of herself? She said, "All I got
[59:35] to touch, I don't even have to touch
[59:37] him.
[59:38] But if I just touch the hem of his
[59:40] garment,
[59:42] &gt;&gt; the virtue that's inside of him is is
[59:45] flowing from him. All I gota do is touch
[59:47] the hem of his garment and I'll be made
[59:49] whole.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; The scripture says that they laid in the
[59:55] shadow of Peter and the apostles and
[59:58] were made whole.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Because they saw Jesus Christ in them.
[1:00:06] There was a sister that was one time
[1:00:08] there in the tabernacle, I believe it
[1:00:09] was, and you know, she was walking and
[1:00:10] she said, "Just let just show me where
[1:00:12] brother Brandham has walked."
[1:00:16] And she said, "Just let me walk on the
[1:00:17] ground." Same ground he's walked on.
[1:00:19] Just show me where he's walked. I'll be
[1:00:21] made whole.
[1:00:26] Man, what kind of faith to have.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? If he's if he's
[1:00:30] honored th those people's faith and
[1:00:32] they've gotten healed, then you know
[1:00:33] what? He'll do the same thing for you.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; And if you if you show up the things
[1:00:40] that God has delivered you from, then
[1:00:41] you know what? If he's delivered one
[1:00:43] person from that, you know what? You
[1:00:44] don't have to suffer from that.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; There's lots of people that's had all
[1:00:50] kinds of of addictions and all kinds of
[1:00:54] hurts that they've carried from their
[1:00:55] childhood, all kinds of things that
[1:00:57] they've been through. I I enjoyed
[1:00:59] brother Marcus Becker when he was here
[1:01:01] was here and he was talking about all
[1:01:02] the things that people have had to
[1:01:04] battle and all the scars that people You
[1:01:06] know what
[1:01:07] God is here to deliver you and to heal
[1:01:10] you and free you from those things.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; It's like well you just you just believe
[1:01:18] God and you know
[1:01:21] watch him come on the scene.
[1:01:25] If you just if you just take him at his
[1:01:26] word, see if God don't come on the scene
[1:01:28] and do what he says he'll do.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; He's He's He's here. He's real.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; He's like, "Well, I've I I don't I don't
[1:01:38] know." Take him at his word.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Who's who tells you he can't do it? The
[1:01:44] scripture don't.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Tell me who says he won't.
[1:01:52] The prophet don't tell you that he won't
[1:01:54] do it.
[1:01:56] The five-fold ministry won't tell you
[1:01:58] that he won't do it.
[1:02:00] Who's telling you that? The devil.
[1:02:04] The enemy is going to try to stop you.
[1:02:05] He going to try to hinder you. But you
[1:02:06] know what? He's still real and he'll do
[1:02:09] exactly what he says he'll do. All you
[1:02:11] got to do is take him at his word.
[1:02:18] See
[1:02:21] whatever we have need of there's a
[1:02:24] brother said there's always a way of
[1:02:26] escape.
[1:02:28] If you want to overcome something
[1:02:29] there's always a way made if you follow
[1:02:32] God's program.
[1:02:33] He said that's the way you can do it.
[1:02:36] See all you got to do is get in the word
[1:02:38] and walk in the word
[1:02:40] and walk the way God has for you. Just
[1:02:43] take it and walk.
[1:02:45] Whether you stumble or fall, whatever it
[1:02:47] is, you just keep walking in it.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; He g He's gonna lead you in a path and
[1:02:53] you just follow the path that God puts
[1:02:55] in front of you and see if God don't
[1:02:57] minister.
[1:02:59] Just just like Abraham,
[1:03:02] God called him out of his out of his
[1:03:04] house, his kindred, his father's house,
[1:03:06] and put him on a journey. And you know,
[1:03:09] all he had to do was keep walking. Every
[1:03:12] place he put his foot was a possession.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Whether whether he stumbled, he fell, he
[1:03:19] lied, whatever it was, you know what? It
[1:03:21] didn't change the promise.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; God brought kept him in fellowship.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; You know, all you got to do is you fall.
[1:03:29] Praise God. You know, we don't we don't
[1:03:31] have to go and and gravel and do penance
[1:03:33] or anything like that.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; All he wants is an honest and contrite
[1:03:39] heart.
[1:03:43] And what does the scripture say? He's
[1:03:44] faithful and just to forgive us
[1:03:47] and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Hey, you fall and fail. That's all
[1:03:52] right. You just keep walking.
[1:03:55] I'm walking I'm walking in this way
[1:03:56] because this way God called me. And
[1:03:58] guess what? When I fall, the Bible says
[1:04:01] that I can I can ask for forgiveness and
[1:04:03] repent. And you know what? He's going
[1:04:05] he's going to forgive me.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; And you know what? God's not God's not
[1:04:10] holding you back. He's trying to bring
[1:04:13] you back into fellowship with him
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; to keep on walking
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; because you know what? Your children,
[1:04:23] you didn't turn your children out and
[1:04:25] throw them out of the house because of
[1:04:26] the things they done.
[1:04:29] Thank God our parents didn't do that to
[1:04:30] us.
[1:04:34] You know, sometimes sometimes, you know,
[1:04:36] I always I always told everybody, my
[1:04:38] dad, you know, my dad, he he spoke the
[1:04:41] truth and you know, when he when he said
[1:04:43] that he was going to knock you in the
[1:04:44] middle of next week, he done his dead
[1:04:46] level best to do that.
[1:04:52] If he said, you know, I'm going to knock
[1:04:53] the fire out of you. Well, you know
[1:04:55] what? He worked on it.
[1:04:58] You had to give him A for an effort.
[1:05:02] But you know what? He, you know, but you
[1:05:04] know what? It set us on the right path.
[1:05:09] Yeah, we got corrected and we didn't
[1:05:11] like it. But you know what? It we
[1:05:14] benefited from it.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; We're better off for it.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; But you know what? So is our heavenly
[1:05:20] father does the same thing for us.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; If you if you fall and fail, guess what?
[1:05:26] He didn't he ain't stopped loving you.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; And he's encouraging you to keep on
[1:05:31] going.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Keep on pressing.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, you just keep doing it.
[1:05:37] You know, you you you fall and make
[1:05:40] mistakes. That's all right.
[1:05:43] There's a blood that covers our sins.
[1:05:48] There's there's one there's an advocate
[1:05:50] for us. You know, I I was thinking about
[1:05:52] where Brother Brown, you know, when
[1:05:55] Sister Hope was getting ready to pass
[1:05:57] and, you know, she went in there
[1:06:01] and
[1:06:04] she was laying there dying and she was
[1:06:06] telling Brother Brandham, you know, you
[1:06:09] know where we made our mistake.
[1:06:13] She stood there
[1:06:15] and you know, she wanted Brother sit
[1:06:17] down and like, Bill, you know where we
[1:06:18] made our mistake? We didn't answer the
[1:06:20] call when God called us the first time.
[1:06:23] We didn't go to the Pentecostal people.
[1:06:26] But you know what? She stood there and
[1:06:28] was dying
[1:06:30] and I got you got two babies to take
[1:06:32] care of.
[1:06:34] But she said, "Go to those people. Do
[1:06:36] what God wants you to do."
[1:06:39] She's like, you know, my life is over
[1:06:41] with, but you know, she is so
[1:06:42] encouraging to him. Listen, you get up
[1:06:43] and go what God wants you to do. You
[1:06:45] follow what God has for you.
[1:06:49] You know, you fall, then you know what?
[1:06:50] Be an encouragement to somebody. You
[1:06:52] keep you keep fighting the battle. You
[1:06:54] keep pressing the battle. You keep doing
[1:06:55] what God wants you to do.
[1:06:58] You know, you you fall and fail. That's
[1:07:00] all right.
[1:07:02] God's made a way. He's m he's made a
[1:07:05] way. When it don't look like there's a
[1:07:07] way, he makes a way.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; He's made a way for all of us.
[1:07:14] Thank God we have a God that's rich in
[1:07:16] mercy that'll carry us all the way
[1:07:17] through. He's made a way for all of us.
[1:07:21] And you say, "Well, I don't I don't see
[1:07:22] it." That's all right. Just be like
[1:07:25] Peter stepping out of that boat. I don't
[1:07:28] know what I'm going to step out on, but
[1:07:29] you know, I got faith to believe what
[1:07:30] God said that I can step out on it and
[1:07:33] I'm going to walk on the water. Because
[1:07:34] you know what he said? He I asked him,
[1:07:36] he said, "Lord, if if it be you, bid me
[1:07:38] to come. Come."
[1:07:42] And you know what? He He got to do
[1:07:45] something nobody else got to do.
[1:07:48] Tell you what, I ain't never had a
[1:07:50] chance to walk on water.
[1:07:57] But God calls us. He wants us to do
[1:08:00] this.
[1:08:01] Then, well,
[1:08:04] see, everything that God has for us, he
[1:08:06] lays out here for us.
[1:08:12] But God wants us to do what he's called
[1:08:14] us to do. Brother Ram said, he said,
[1:08:17] this is from the message, my new
[1:08:19] ministry.
[1:08:23] And he said, he was speaking about, you
[1:08:25] know, we know that people are not, not
[1:08:26] everybody's going to receive it. Not
[1:08:28] everybody's going. It's not for
[1:08:30] everybody.
[1:08:31] He said, "But you know, but you know,"
[1:08:33] he said, "But so why why are you calling
[1:08:35] to people and why are you why are you
[1:08:36] proclaiming this?" He said, 'Because
[1:08:38] that's part of God's plan to preach the
[1:08:40] gospel because you know, we don't know
[1:08:42] who it's going to come to, but it's
[1:08:44] coming to somebody and somebody's going
[1:08:45] to receive it.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; So, we're not we're not going to be
[1:08:49] quiet about it.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; But he says he said, "But he said so,
[1:08:53] listen to this." He said, "God has so
[1:08:55] arranged it that his program cannot move
[1:08:57] without you and I." And as long as we're
[1:09:01] not doing what God leads us to do, we're
[1:09:03] paralyzing his program.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; But when the church moves by the
[1:09:07] anointing of the Holy Ghost, then we're
[1:09:10] in God's will doing his program.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; If we follow what God has, then you know
[1:09:17] what? We wonder why things are not
[1:09:19] moving. It's like, "Well, I don't see
[1:09:20] God moving. Wonder what's going on."
[1:09:23] Well, look at ourselves.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Well, Lord, am am I the hindrance? Am I
[1:09:30] not doing what what I need to be doing?
[1:09:32] Am I shining the light to other people
[1:09:34] that other people can see what needs to
[1:09:36] be done? Am I living the right kind of
[1:09:39] life
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; to show other people?
[1:09:44] You know that that I that's what I want
[1:09:46] to do that everybody else can see the
[1:09:49] the plan of God
[1:09:52] that I want I want to be a example that
[1:09:56] people can see.
[1:10:00] But don't don't let these things hinder
[1:10:02] you. Don't let things hold you back.
[1:10:06] You know, you take these things that God
[1:10:08] shows and you you look at them and and
[1:10:11] make sure that's that's the will of God.
[1:10:16] You know, because sometimes we get we
[1:10:17] get in our minds, well, I don't know
[1:10:19] about this or I don't know about that. I
[1:10:22] was thinking about brother Brandon when
[1:10:22] he was talking about he said they were
[1:10:24] in in the church one day and he said
[1:10:26] they they got in there and they had a
[1:10:27] singing and he said all of a sudden that
[1:10:29] young girl jumps up and she starts
[1:10:30] dancing in the aisle
[1:10:34] and all he could think of is what are
[1:10:36] what are the people in the church
[1:10:37] thinking about me looking at this girl
[1:10:39] dancing in my church?
[1:10:42] Well, because you know what? He had too
[1:10:43] much of his Baptist doctrine
[1:10:48] and he was like I well I just I just
[1:10:50] can't imagine this
[1:10:52] and he was like you know what he stopped
[1:10:54] and he began to think
[1:10:57] hey why would she do that
[1:11:01] and then all of a sudden he began to
[1:11:02] think well you know what people dancing
[1:11:05] in the spirit is because they got
[1:11:06] victory.
[1:11:09] He said, "Miriam and the and the
[1:11:10] children of Israel with the and the
[1:11:12] daughters when they crossed over the Red
[1:11:14] Sea, they got up and danced and had a
[1:11:15] good time. They didn't care who who saw
[1:11:17] them
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; cuz you know what? They had victory."
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And David got up and danced when the ark
[1:11:24] of the covenant came back into the camp.
[1:11:26] And he didn't care who saw him. And he
[1:11:28] said, "If you think I acted a fool
[1:11:29] today," he said, "Come back tomorrow."
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm not ashamed.
[1:11:38] Because you know what? If you got
[1:11:39] victory, you don't mind showing what you
[1:11:41] got.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; It ain't it ain't holding you back. It
[1:11:45] ain't hindering you.
[1:11:48] And he was standing there and he was
[1:11:49] thinking, "Well, you know what? She's
[1:11:50] got more victory than I got."
[1:11:54] And he said, "Well, you know what? If I
[1:11:55] got victory, I could do the same thing.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Why don't I get up and dance also?"
[1:12:02] He said, "Well, they got to singing." He
[1:12:03] said, "Well, next thing you know," he
[1:12:04] said, "I got to patting my foot and
[1:12:06] enjoying myself and realizing, you know
[1:12:08] what? I could I could do the same thing.
[1:12:11] If I had the victory, you know what? I
[1:12:13] wouldn't be hindered by that either."
[1:12:16] And then all of a sudden, next thing you
[1:12:17] know, he said, "I was up there dancing
[1:12:19] in the aisle with her.
[1:12:21] We was both dancing in the aisle. Both
[1:12:23] had her because you know what? I got to
[1:12:24] the place where I was I had the
[1:12:26] victory."
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Well, if it if it's the same thing, then
[1:12:30] you know what? Don't be hindered by it.
[1:12:32] If you see somebody else enjoying what
[1:12:34] God has done for them, then you know
[1:12:35] what? Don't hold back.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Because the devil's going to try to hold
[1:12:40] you back. Oh, I wouldn't do that if I
[1:12:41] were you. I wouldn't do that.
[1:12:46] Well, who's talking to you?
[1:12:51] Well, some, you know, you come to church
[1:12:52] and because you know what? If you if you
[1:12:54] was at a ball game, talking about the
[1:12:56] ball game again,
[1:12:58] but you know what? If you was at a ball
[1:12:59] game, you wouldn't sit there and just
[1:13:00] look
[1:13:02] No, you know why people get up and they
[1:13:04] show their emotions.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; You know, they got their hands in the
[1:13:10] air.
[1:13:13] They're having a good time.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; And you know what? And they don't care
[1:13:17] what the next person is doing or anybody
[1:13:20] else doing
[1:13:22] because you know what? They come to have
[1:13:24] a good time. And you know what? They're
[1:13:25] going they're going to express what they
[1:13:27] believe and what what they're enjoying
[1:13:29] because you know what? They're in this
[1:13:30] atmosphere.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? If you got in the
[1:13:34] atmosphere, too, you know, then, you
[1:13:35] know,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; you know, because, you know, I I just I
[1:13:41] just hate and I and I'm sorry, it's just
[1:13:44] just part of my personality. Just that
[1:13:46] human grab bag I got. But, you know,
[1:13:48] it's sad when you have to come to church
[1:13:49] and you got to tell everybody, "Clap
[1:13:51] your hands, raise your hands, do this,
[1:13:53] do that."
[1:13:55] you know, if you come to worship God,
[1:13:57] you know, um, well, you know, I have a
[1:14:01] hard time seeing people worship the Lord
[1:14:03] and it's look like look like they're
[1:14:05] mimicking a totem pole.
[1:14:12] I mean, I don't I I honestly I honestly
[1:14:14] I I I've been to I've been to churches
[1:14:17] and honestly I've been to churches and
[1:14:19] you know I mean I mean they have
[1:14:23] you know and it's like people people
[1:14:25] worship for 30 minutes and they never
[1:14:26] clap their hands. They never raise their
[1:14:28] hands. They never snap their fingers.
[1:14:29] They never tap their foot.
[1:14:36] It's like, well, you know what that I
[1:14:37] mean?
[1:14:39] I don't know. The Psalmist David said,
[1:14:42] "Clap your hands. We're going to raise
[1:14:44] our hands. Lift up holy hands.
[1:14:49] We're going to sing.
[1:14:53] Praise the Lord in the dance."
[1:15:00] That's all right. I don't mind.
[1:15:02] But you know it's it's it's I think it's
[1:15:04] pray you know to praise God however you
[1:15:06] but you know if if if some because life
[1:15:09] life moves
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; you know when brother saw that lady out
[1:15:17] there dancing that young girl and he
[1:15:19] said God he said he said before I know
[1:15:21] it he said I was out there on the floor
[1:15:23] dancing around with that girl and then I
[1:15:25] said God take me out of the seat of the
[1:15:27] scornful. Let me look at anything
[1:15:29] sensibly before I ever pass judgment
[1:15:31] anymore.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Let me let me look at it sensibly. And
[1:15:37] you know what? If if God give us the
[1:15:38] victory, then you know what? We don't
[1:15:40] mind sharing the victory.
[1:15:47] Brother Wade, when you when you played
[1:15:48] football or baseball and everything,
[1:15:50] when y'all when y'all won games, really
[1:15:53] tough game,
[1:15:55] went down in extra innings or whatever,
[1:15:58] and y'all had to really really press the
[1:16:01] battle. I mean, you really had to work
[1:16:03] for that victory. When y'all got done,
[1:16:05] y'all just walked back to the locker
[1:16:07] room.
[1:16:13] We'd had fun
[1:16:17] when you go. No, no. I mean I mean
[1:16:20] [clears throat] I I'll tell I'll I'll
[1:16:21] tell this story on me and Richard. We
[1:16:24] went to a Christian school years ago. We
[1:16:25] played basketball.
[1:16:28] He had two left feet. I had two right
[1:16:30] feet.
[1:16:34] They called me the They called me the
[1:16:36] round mounter rebound.
[1:16:39] And my other nickname was freight train.
[1:16:41] Freight train.
[1:16:43] We we were the dynamic duo. Uh I played
[1:16:47] offense and he played defense. He
[1:16:49] couldn't sometimes he couldn't hit the
[1:16:51] broadside of a barn. But let me tell you
[1:16:53] what, that boy would stick to stick to
[1:16:56] you like white on rice.
[1:16:59] He would pester you to no end. I mean,
[1:17:01] he he really stopped people from
[1:17:02] scoring, passing the ball.
[1:17:05] And I mean, he was he was right there on
[1:17:07] you.
[1:17:08] Y'all wouldn't believe it, but back when
[1:17:10] he was slim.
[1:17:13] Hey, listen. I ain't talk about him.
[1:17:14] He's my brother. I
[1:17:17] That boy right there could run like the
[1:17:18] wind. Don't ask him to do that today,
[1:17:21] but back then he could run like the
[1:17:23] wind.
[1:17:25] He get out of wind. That's right. But
[1:17:26] anyway,
[1:17:28] that boy could that boy he could play
[1:17:30] defense. But I tell you what, they give
[1:17:32] me the ball.
[1:17:35] I was I was Larry Bird, Cream Abdul
[1:17:39] Jabar,
[1:17:40] Michael Jordan.
[1:17:42] You give me the ball, I'm going. I And I
[1:17:45] listen, I I learned I learned one thing
[1:17:47] real fast. It's like if you leave your
[1:17:50] feet, you leave your feet trying to
[1:17:53] block me, I'm putting you in the wall
[1:17:58] because if you jump and you make contact
[1:18:01] with me, it's against you. And I would
[1:18:03] and I would plow people. I would I just
[1:18:06] speed up and I know I'm g and I'd make
[1:18:08] shots. I make layups and I'd hit people
[1:18:11] so hard they they just hit the wall, hit
[1:18:13] the mat behind the basketball. Boom.
[1:18:16] After you do that two or three times,
[1:18:17] you know what? They just give you room.
[1:18:23] And you know what? I was just like,
[1:18:24] "Hey, we play this game all night long.
[1:18:28] I just keep hitting you."
[1:18:31] After a while, they just they just quit.
[1:18:32] We just make points.
[1:18:35] But you know when you get done, you go
[1:18:36] through all that and you get up there.
[1:18:44] No, but you know when when you get done,
[1:18:46] you go through all that right there. You
[1:18:47] know, you're jumping up and down and
[1:18:51] you get out there and
[1:18:54] Yeah. You're happy.
[1:19:00] Say what now?
[1:19:02] Woo.
[1:19:04] Well, you know what? If you got the
[1:19:06] victory tonight, then you know what? If
[1:19:07] you know what God's done for you and
[1:19:09] God's delivered you and God's healed you
[1:19:11] and he's done all these things for you,
[1:19:13] when you've seen God do something, you
[1:19:14] know what? Then you can stand up and and
[1:19:16] stand up and praise God
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; and not be ashamed of it
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; to see what God's done for you. When
[1:19:23] you've been through hard battles and
[1:19:25] you've seen God deliver you,
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; when when God when there was no way when
[1:19:30] when every report was negative
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; and there how are you going to make it?
[1:19:35] Well, you know what? God came on the
[1:19:36] scene. God specializes in things thought
[1:19:39] impossible.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, you come up there
[1:19:43] and you know what? If nobody else gets
[1:19:45] up, well then you know what? If you get
[1:19:47] happy, then I ought to get happy, too.
[1:19:48] Because you know what? If God blesses
[1:19:50] you, then you know what? I ought to be
[1:19:51] blessed because God blessed you.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Well, God, if God healed you, then you
[1:19:58] know what? Then I ought to be able to
[1:19:59] raise my hands and say, "Thank God that
[1:20:01] he's that he's healed my brothers and
[1:20:03] he's healed my sisters. He's delivered
[1:20:04] them."
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Whatever whatever that you have need of,
[1:20:09] God's done for you. Then you know what?
[1:20:10] I'm praise God. I enjoy that. Thank God
[1:20:12] to see what God's done for people
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; because you know what? That gives other
[1:20:18] people encouragement to realize, you
[1:20:20] know, God's God's amongst us. What? Pay.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Because if you come if you come here
[1:20:25] tonight and you're and you're sick and
[1:20:28] you're afflicted, then you know what?
[1:20:30] The Holy Spirit is here tonight
[1:20:33] and you don't have to leave here the
[1:20:34] same way you come in the door
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; because you're either going to leave
[1:20:38] worse or better than the way you came
[1:20:39] in.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; But if he came here tonight, then you
[1:20:41] know what? All you got to do is follow
[1:20:42] God's plan. Amen.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; God's program is here
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; and all you got to do is walk in it.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? I'm a victor
[1:20:49] because he said I was a victor. Well,
[1:20:50] you know what? I'm g I'm gonna act like
[1:20:52] I'm I got the victory
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; because he said I had it.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna stand up and I'm I'm gonna
[1:20:59] thank God because you know what? I have
[1:21:00] the victory.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; When you think, well, I don't know how
[1:21:05] things are going to work out. You know
[1:21:06] what? We got we got the problem solver.
[1:21:10] Whatever whatever you have a whatever
[1:21:12] question you got, Jesus is the answer.
[1:21:15] He's the answer. We've got the answer.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; And all we got to do is put him on the
[1:21:19] case and just like, Lord,
[1:21:22] I'm going to hand it over to you.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we get we get
[1:21:28] aggravated, we get worried, we get
[1:21:29] frustrated with stuff.
[1:21:33] We're trying to carry our own burdens.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; We're trying to figure out our own
[1:21:37] things.
[1:21:39] What a friend we have in Jesus.
[1:21:43] All our sins and griefs to bear. What a
[1:21:47] privilege it is to carry everything to
[1:21:50] God in prayer.

[1:33:37] Heavenly Father, we thank you for this
[1:33:39] time, Lord Jesus. We thank you for your
[1:33:40] word that you've sent to us, Lord. Lord,
[1:33:43] it is so wonderful, Lord, to look into
[1:33:44] your word and and see all the blessings
[1:33:46] that we've received. Lord, we give you
[1:33:49] thanks,
[1:33:50] Lord, as the David said, the Lord gives
[1:33:54] and he takes away. Blessed be the name
[1:33:56] of the Lord, Lord. Everything that
[1:33:58] you've done in our lives, Lord. Lord,
[1:34:01] sometimes [music] we don't see the
[1:34:04] the blessing there, but in due time we
[1:34:07] [music] always see that your hand is
[1:34:10] always blessing. We always know what
[1:34:12] what's best for us. Lord, we thank you
[1:34:15] for that.
[1:34:17] So Lord, we just put our trust in you,
[1:34:19] Lord.
[1:34:21] Lord, whatever the path you have us to
[1:34:23] go down, Lord Jesus, we just want to
[1:34:24] follow, be in your plan, Lord, in your
[1:34:27] perfect will in that [music] program,
[1:34:29] Lord Jesus. Lord, let us not be a
[1:34:31] hindrance or a stumbling stone, Lord.
[1:34:34] Let us help our help our brothers and
[1:34:36] sisters, Lord Jesus. Help us get
[1:34:39] ourselves out of the way, Lord. Lord, we
[1:34:42] just thank you. But we thank you for
[1:34:44] this time, the season, Lord Jesus.
[1:34:46] Thanksgiving, Lord, that we can
[1:34:49] take a break and thank you for all the
[1:34:52] things you've done and look back over
[1:34:53] the year, all the blessings, Lord Jesus,
[1:34:56] the miracles [music] we've seen, the
[1:34:57] healings that have taken place.
[1:35:02] And Lord, we realize that, Lord, you've
[1:35:04] led us this this far, Lord. We know that
[1:35:06] you're going to carry us all the way,
[1:35:08] Lord. We're looking for that great day
[1:35:09] that's coming, Lord Jesus. But we
[1:35:12] continue to walk in this word, this
[1:35:13] revealed word, Lord Jesus. Lord, there's
[1:35:16] a day coming, Lord. Those that are on
[1:35:17] the other side, Lord, they're going to
[1:35:19] be back with us,
[1:35:21] Lord Jesus. We're looking for that great
[1:35:23] day, but we're going to have a great
[1:35:25] time of fellowship with those that have
[1:35:27] crossed over.
[1:35:30] Lord, let us just be faithful in what
[1:35:32] you've called us to. Lord, bless each
[1:35:34] one, Lord, as they travel. And Lord, as

[1:35:39] you bless each one, Lord, as we come
[1:35:41] back on Sunday, Lord, just bless each
[1:35:44] one. Bless our pastor, Lord. Lord, just
[1:35:47] strengthen him. We thank you for, Lord,
[1:35:50] receiving a man of God that's been
[1:35:53] called, Lord Jesus, in this hour. where
[1:35:56] we said we the prophet said to get
[1:35:58] behind our pasture. Lord, he's ordained
[1:36:00] to lead us through.
[1:36:03] Lord, I appreciate that,
[1:36:07] Lord, because I realize as a sheep, I
[1:36:09] need to be led.
[1:36:13] I believe we had a called a God called
[1:36:15] pastor, Lord, that's led by the Holy
[1:36:17] Ghost.
[1:36:20] And Lord, I I have confidence in you. I
[1:36:24] got a confidence in your five-fold
[1:36:25] ministry. I got confidence in your
[1:36:27] bride, our brothers and sisters, Lord.
[1:36:30] Lord, it's not us, but we're looking
[1:36:33] unto you, the author and the finisher of
[1:36:34] our faith. Lord, bless each one as they
[1:36:37] go home, Lord Jesus. Bless the bride
[1:36:39] around the world, Lord. We commit all
[1:36:40] things to you in the name of Jesus
[1:36:43] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless
[1:36:46] you. Dismissed tonight.
