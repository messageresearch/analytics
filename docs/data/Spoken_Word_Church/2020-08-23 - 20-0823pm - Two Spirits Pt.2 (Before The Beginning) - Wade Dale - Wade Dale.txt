in the house of the lord good to have each and every one of you with us by way of announcement we'll get them done real quick brother luis will be here wednesday night um we'll be praying for brother dale he'll be leaving sometime tomorrow i guess going to uh lebanon tennessee to do the funeral for brother dale roberts remember that family again and then he'll be back wednesday may not be back in time for service but that's okay we'll be right here brother luis will be speaking for us and then uh he and my self were going to brother jewel's um dedicational service for his church he's been preaching some sounds a lot better than he did lord a month ago it sounded like he was just a whisper but when i spoke to him yesterday or day before yesterday he sounded really good so he's he's getting the church open and brother dale's going to dedicate it and on sunday at 11 o'clock that will be on the 30th not this it'll be obviously not today it'll be next sunday so that's where we will be and brother bob and brother aaron and they can cast lots who's going to do sunday morning and sunday afternoon but just remember them in your prayers all these brother they'll be traveling tomorrow and wednesday and sunday so just remember him keep them all in your prayers so i know we all have unspoken requests that we hold before the lord but we know who we know who the healer is he's the healer and we pray that he just sends a healing angel by today and and just heal all those that need it we many many requests of people all over the country that's being affected not just by the virus but by a lot of things fears grown among the people i don't say so much of people the message but fears grown among the world causing people to go crazy and do crazy things but um that's what we're promised this world is going to become insane so you know why they become insane because you know what they don't know where they came from they don't even know what they're doing here and they sure don't know where they're going they might have a thought that maybe i can my um no we must have as the bride of jesus christ an assurity of where we come from what we're doing here where we're going i believe that's what the message of the hour has brought us and it's brought us clarity not confusion if it's confusion it's that other spirit if it's clarity it's the spirit of god all right so let's bow our heads we're still on two spirits and and the title is going to tell you that we're going to be reading some of the same things that brother dale spoke on this morning but um before the beginning we're going before the beginning okay so we're going we're going way on back and um you'll have to just give me patience because there's a lot of things that we don't have quotes for but i believe that as you as you pray and as we all pray as ministers we pray that that the lord will do the speaking if he's the one that was back there god if he was the one that's back there before there was anything written before there was anything moving before there was anything he obviously has not forgot it he's an eyewitness he wasn't even an eyewitness he was he was the person that did it then if we have the baptism of the holy ghost today then i believe that same person that was standing back there he's in a he's in morphine and morphed into a form called the bride he didn't change his thought process i was thinking this morning you know god don't have ideas that's right humans have ideas because when god had a thought it became material he didn't have to think it over that's an idea i have an idea for this and not god don't have ideas god's thoughts are eternal and his process is eternal and we just got to get in that process and that's what we're going to try to do with these two spirits is to show where we are at where we came from what we're doing here and where we're going so let's buy our heads before we begin dear lord thank you for this day we pray that you'd sanctify us lord for this journey that we're on some it's been a real long journey lord and i pray that you give them comfort be with the ones that are sick lord this journey in this human body gets as we say it gets older and older because of the curse but lord we're inside lord is that young man that you took that picture of as we were speaking the other night that's what you're looking at lord but two though you came down here in the human body one time and you had heart aches and problems in that human body so lord you know what we're going through and i pray that you would send that bomb of gilead lord that you have lord that will soothe over a lot of the aches and pains of humanity that we have trials and tribulations fear a lot of different things that are gripping people now lord we pray that you would help us to point our eyes towards you lord and know that you told us the right thing the first time and you never have to take it back you never have to change your plan it was perfect to begin with and lord i put my everything i got on that and then thank you god that you sent us a prophet that could tell us these things and bring that secret as brother dale was talking this morning bring that secret hidden mystery bring it right to us and make it not just tell us in words but lord make it so vivid and make it strike home to our hearts and just to say as sister hattie wright said that ain't nothing but the truth father lord we pray that you'd be with the ones that are sick in this church ones that are not with us with this church around the world you're bride of jesus christ lord we're groaning and waiting for that time lord where we can get out of here lord but we have a little bit of a time left lord for a journey that we need to get ready and get processed so that we can end this thing up lord death can be destroyed and we can leave this place and lord let satan destroy it whatever he wants to do and then we'll come back lord on a redeemed entire earth as the prophet tells us in your future home be with us bless us be with our pastor as he travels this week and with the dale roberts family lord we pray that you would give them comfort you are the only one that can we can talk words and speak but lord you're the only one that can in the hour of quietness and the hour that maybe they get lonely wanting their dad that you're the only one that can come in and fill that void we pray that you'll do that now father we ask your blessings on this service be with us in jesus name amen first john 4 verse 1 says beloved believe not every spirit all right there's your warning but try the spirits whether they are of god because many faults what prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesses now remember that word if you looked it up you'll see that word confesseth means logos that's the very embodiment of almighty god so you're what you're doing is you're bringing you're basing your confession on that logos inside of you because that's where it's at it's inside you and you're comparing yourself and you're what you're confessing that jesus christ is coming the flesh is of god because we weren't there there's no proof physical proof that jesus ever walked here as far as a photograph or no there's stories written down and there's places that there but we have to believe in our heart that he did come here in the flesh and if you have that logos inside of you it knows that it came in the flesh because it was inside that flesh well that's kind of hard but it's really very simple and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world and that's in a.d about 96 little that john's writing the little john's ye are of god little children and you have overcome them what the antichrist because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us and he that is not of god here's not us that's pretty simple they don't try to talk to them about the the word of god the true word of god it's all sounding brass and tinkling symbols they just don't know what you're talking about hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of aaron you may be seated in the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word we're going to background just a little bit from wednesday and then we're going to head out before the beginning amen ezekiel 28 verse 11 let's go let's read that one because we got to bring this one in because moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man this is in ezekiel take up a lamentation upon the king of taurus now remember the king of tires was a regular person he was a king tyrus or the tyre tyre is a city that's mentioned many times in the bible but this is a this is a story because this king of tires wasn't in the garden of eden so what's he talking about he's talking about the devil talking about satan all right talking about lucifer son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyres and say unto him thus saith the lord thou see list up to some full of wisdom and perfect in beauty listen lucifer was created the most beautiful angel that ever was he's not some hideous gory bloody red with a long tail with a fork on it and uh the horn that's not lucifer that might be what he think wants you to think about it but he's the slicker brother brown said he's the good-looking guy look at verse 13 thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was not covering now look these same stones these same stones talk about jesus over in revelations look at but now look god gave him this thou has been in the e and eating the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering because remember god created lucifer okay now because i'm going to prove it right here the bible's going to prove it sardis topaz diamond burl onyx jasper sapphire emerald carbuncle gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in ye in the day that thou was created wow wow now let's go to matthew 24 and read that one for if any man shall say unto you lord hears christ are there believe it not why because they're going to be so close for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now that's what satan's job is is to deceive the very elect he's got all the others the elect is who he's got his attention pointed to all right and it started in a great battle way back before the beginning and we're going to bring some things out today that maybe you need to ponder in your heart and maybe i need to ponder them again but i think they're pretty they're pretty much right according to you know you you get these people that have to have quotes for things well you have to be careful uh brother dale and i were talking another day you can take brother brown you can take many quotes and and make him be wrong i said you can take many quotes and make him say something that he really didn't say let's stand and address the third person of the trinity preach two or three sermons on the mighty conqueror and that being the holy ghost and the first seal which is not true but in his progressive revelation that's all he knew at the time because the holy ghost is a mighty conqueror and he does ride a white horse all right so you see the deception that satan was even deceiving the prophet he deceived everybody on the in the world almost except this little bride is not going to be deceived in the end time and the message that the the prophet of god brought us satan can just beat it to death but there's going to be a true bride that's going to know exactly what god was telling us through that prophet amen everybody got that say amen for there shall arise false christ now not false whatever you want to say these are false anointed ones false christ christ is true but something has to come along and we'll get that late way later on because we got to get back before the beginning and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very leg now let's just review just for a minute let's go to number one which is demonology 1953 brother brown said you know there's there's false there's a true and a false of everything if i give you a dollar and i say this is a good dollar and you'd look at it i'd have to look pretty much like a real dollar or you wouldn't believe it is that right so it'll have to be a really a good imitation and jesus said the two spirits in the last day will be so close till it would deceive the very elect if possible religious people now remember now there ain't nothing out there in them old cold old cord formal outside everybody got them they have just a form of godliness you see but these two spirits are real spirits now what's he saying is don't worry about them out there they're cold formal they're already there you know if they're already caught in the system satan's already got them you don't want you don't go out there and plague somebody you already got right you want the guy that's got the goods as your daddy always says but these two spirits are real spirits it'd be so close to they deceive the very elect how it was working side by side in the last days did jesus say that he did now let's go to the next one which would be god of this evil age let's read that one the two spirits one of them god's holy spirit remember i said last wednesday there's only two spirits for us to deal with the holy spirit and god and in satan spirit the true and the false there's no gray area in between everything either falls under the true or falls under the falls all right the two spirits one of them god's holy spirit the other one the devil's spirit working in deception the people of the earth are now making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ he is doing it by vindicating his word of promise to her for this age showing that it is christ now for somebody to say that that was false that the prophet of god was bringing something false how close is that to blaspheming because they're attributing all of his works to being false i can't see that for this showing that it is christ if the finger is supposed to move in this age the finger will move if the foot is supposed to move in this age the foot will move if the eye is supposed to see in this age i will see see the spirit of god as it's grown into the full stature of god that was my point i was trying to make last wednesday was that this is the apex of deception this is the apex of of christ spirit and this is the apex of satan's spirit because he's going to god but see now look satan is a follower or an imitator because god is going to incarnate a bride and take her off the scene and then satan's just going to step over and incarnate a pope the beast all of what you want to call whatever you want to call him and he'll incarnate him and then he's going to try to take over the world everybody got that all right that's the two spirits the only two spirits it started with two in the beginning it's going to start with two because remember brother brown said every time jesus came on the scene judas would come on the scene holy spirit will come on the scene the antichrist spirit will come on the scene so it's really it's really simple when at the beginning you got two spirits one holy one unholy but so unholy it's almost holy right but remember unholy is only one word eve did an unholy thing because of one word all right that's why we must look at this because you watch what brother brown now i won't get into it today because we got to get back before the beginning this is just what i was talking about last sunday this is as christ comes to his fullness and a bride the antichrist does the same thing because satan has been watching it since time began and even beyond and i'll prove it here in just a few minutes the holy spirit is grown into the full stature of the spirit of god is the age that we're now living in the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the holy spirit is doing this so that the people that believe god will be called out of what this chaos out of that other spirit the devil's unholy spirit is here calling his church by error right right wow i'm just telling you what brother brown said as usual by perversion of the word of god because remember he can't create and i believe that's what made him mad we'll talk about in just a few minutes like he did at the beginning see it's coming right back to that seed time again from eden here it is again so let's read number three the seed is not air with shuck 1965 remember there's no more seed promised to a woman anywhere after mary we went over this last sunday but this is the condensed version and there's no more denominations promised after pentecost it's the rapture and bride coming forth from there the seed the word made manifest again what maturity notice see how close it looks matthew said saint matthew 24 24 said the two spirits in the last days the church spirit of the church people ain't talking about the drunks and alcoholics and the whoremongers and adulterers that's not what he said why would that fool us the church spirit of the church people and the bride spirit of the bride people there's your two spirits would be so close together though until it would deceive the very elect it was possible that's how close now let's not read number four because it's the same as number two so skip over to number five this is the one i want to get to an exposition of the seven church ages brother brown says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts excuse me but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church because remember there's a church spirit and there's a bride spirit one's one's of god and one's not right all right and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works the whole world is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church we're not talking atheists here we're talking the true spirit in the framework of the christian church and i said last wednesday message church that's where satan's at folks and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be definitely tortured as he was thwarted when he was when christ now what did christ do brother roman another quote brother brown said jesus didn't tie satan up and and shut his mouth and he could have done that right he had control he could have said shut up don't say another word i'll take all that what no he said it is written it is also written because satan was saying now look satan was quoting the scripture to him dash your foot against the stone all that satan said it is also written so let's look at number six here in jude 3 4 and 12. this is an exposition of the seven church ages still a continuation beloved when i give all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was needed for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints now that's what we're contending for now for there are certain men now look this is brother brown's comments in between here for there are certain men not saints crept in unawares these have not come into the fold by means of the door and are therefore robbers who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ these are spots in your feast of charity when they feast with you they don't have a feast over here and we have a feast over here they're feasting on the same that you're feasting on and y'all must ate a lot because you're already going to sleep they feast with you what feeding themselves without fear as we come boldly to the throne of god they come boldly to it to not the throne of god but they come boldly to be right here with you by or i are among you it cannot be denied now this is the quote he's out of the you know this is all scripture here if you'll read that in jude it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined having been planted together but a different seed all right now listen we're not talking about natural seed we'll get into all that how that all developed on down through here but watch another this is number seven quote seven it's from the consummation of the gentile age now this is us laodicean church age this age is the last of the seven church ages what began in the first or ephesian age must and will come to full fruition and harvest in the last layout of cnas now that's where we are that's where we're coming to maturity listen only mature bride will not be trapped right everybody else will be to see the two vines will yield their final fruit the two spirits will terminate their manifestation in each of their final destinations the sowing the watering the growing is all over summer has ended the sickle is now thrust into the harvest that's why brother dale's talking about having a revival you know you have a revival when all that happens you know you get but he had to wait till this time you had to wait till both mature because they're intertwined in my garden right now we should have never let them make ups live they are intertwined with my with my bean vines and they're almost exactly the same but you know what you can't eat them maps and when everybody know what a map is you never had a may pop battle good grief people i'm like brother brown where y'all from anybody anybody cares y'all raise your hand we've had map battles before you get out in the garden it's a it's called a may pop because it's about wasting time explaining this but i got to explain it but they're about this big around and they're growing a little vine it's called a map may pop because it's when you throw it it's kind of hollow inside but it's got air in it it's it's not worth nothing but to throw at your brother and you get them things and you start throwing them at each other and when they hit they go pop that's why they call them may pops some of you that have daddy's never mentioned to you about people's tires were map tires because they may pop at any minute well that's what a map is a map is a fruit and they're worthless but back to my point when they're growing with my with my bean vines they look the same until the fruit comes out because the bean looks way different than that may pop but may pop seed the reason i'm telling you this may pop seed i read about it you should never let may pop come to full maturity because 250 years that seed can lay in the ground so every time i go out there and turn that ground up there's may pops coming up about that high and it's just a regular vine that comes up looks like kind of look like a bean seed but that's what god said now look what god's done he's saying look harvest time brother brown said yes harvest time because we know a bean looks different than that so i can tell the difference when their beans are fruit but you can't tell the difference when they're growing that's why christ told them to wait till it all matured the two vines that grew together and intertwined their branches are now to be separated the fruits of those vines which were at such variance will be gathered into the separate gardeners the two spirits will go to their separate destination so they're not going to the same destination they're going to separate destinations all right so that's the dividing of the two spears has everybody got that say amen but we think that it's the one that opposes is way over here now listen when you're in a battle when you're in a battle you don't fight in one field in another old times used to be hand to hand so what you were close you were so close many times uh brother harris told us when they were fighting in vietnam he said you didn't know who was your enemy or who was your friend because they were both north vietnamese and south vietnamese they both look the same so same way with the bible in the same way with the ba prophet's message and same way with preaching of the message so close they look so much alike all right but we're going to look and see now let's go back and let's read that same quote brother dale read this morning questions and answers on genesis coach where genesis is the beginning of of time creation and time right all right i'm going to slow down here just for a minute creation in time book of genesis brother brown said it's the c chapter both seeds came out of that chapter the serpent seed came out of there and god's seed came from there all right now remember also remember this like brother dale said there's a spiritual seed and there's a natural seed we're not talking about natural seed lines you cannot by no means run your lineage back to see whether you were on cane side or really doesn't matter because when it when the fall happened god gave everybody a choice so there you do away with seed lines if you say well now god didn't give cain a chance well now his whole line you could say well they're just serpents see they're just dead no he gave them all a chance he gave cain's children a choice all down through time he's given choices and we're going to see right here that by the word of god we're going to understand that satan had a choice the angels have a choice even though listen the angels are not human now brother brown said angels are not him they are spirits right they cannot and we'll talk about this next sunday whenever later we'll be gone that sunday but remember those fallen angels that we're going to talk about in a minute they did not enter into human beings right they influence human beings everybody got that say amen they influence they never because they asked brother brown that two times in the message if you'll look up fallen angels he'll say there's no way that that angel could get into you and become that would be transm that would be taking donny's soul out and putting a demon soul in him no you got to remember though that you've got two spirits the good spirit and the bad spirit everybody got that you and i on this side of the fall we're fixing to talk about going back on the other side but on this side of the fall we have a choice to make you were born and given life in your soul but you have to choose whether you want eternal life that's why i don't agree with people that you can't make it fit my whole bible that we were born with some kind of an eternal seed inside of us i don't see that none whatsoever that does away with redemption right that's right why didn't god just stand over there before the beginning and say i'm gonna have this line you're gonna have that line we'll fight down there at the end no cause that's what happened anyway right all right so let's go everybody gotta put your thinking caps on now because i can't read a lot of quotes and i don't have a whole lot of bible but it's all in the bible nobody got that uh what are you talking about well brother dale he explained it really good this morning if you have a if you have a problem with this go back and listen to this morning what a foundation he was in other words adam the first man in the lower creations of god the first creation was god himself now let's stop right there because god is an object of worship correct he had to have something to worship him brother brown said there was nothing he was elohim e-l-o elohim self-existing god right what made him god you better think back lucifer wasn't created like 35 000 down the line i'm gonna read you right here in a minute where lucifer was god's right-hand man to my idea and my revelation the first thing that made god god was the devil was that okay because lucifer was created i just read it to you in the day you were created so lucifer was the first creation besides the first creation was god himself like brother dale said he covered he you couldn't explain him now i think we're able to explain him he steps out and he's not some floating blob of goo because if we were made in his image he had to be a man everybody with me never was if he was another something besides a man he changed right but you and i had to have a prophet to tell us that he wasn't god yet he was elohim there was no angels because what did brother brown say he said god's first creation was angels you've got to put lucifer in there and you've got to put him number one because i'm going to read you right here in just a minute from demonology satan is god he created lucifer to be his right-hand man so what made god god from elohim lucifer the very one he wanted god wanted to use but he knew when he created him what was going to happen because we'll read it a little bit later on he said though iniquity you were perfect until iniquity was found in you what's iniquity iniquity is knowing to do better not doing it or doing it and knowing you shouldn't do it satan should have knew lucifer should have knew that he can't go above create a created being he was a created being he couldn't go above a creator he should have known that but remember that turned into iniquity so what happens is this is my thought okay we're going to go with this because look then out of god so satan must have already been there lucifer let's read it some of you a little cross-eyed there for a minute let's look on here let's let the prophet tell us right here let's go to number nine skip ezekiel 28. then we'll go back and read the seal of the antichrist 1955. go down to the right there did you know that in heaven that the devil was god's right-hand man in the beginning that lucifer the son of the morning was given power right-hand man and he was the anointed cherub he knew how to worship but what he did he turned that worship away from the creator and wanted it for himself so you see it and that's another thing you have we gonna have to be careful when we start talking about fallen angels because remember all angels must have had a choice right they're not human but remember satan got about a third of them or so what to go with him we'll read it in just a minute but look the devil was god's right-hand man in the beginning lucifer the son of the morning was given power and the reason that he brought sin into the world watch he was not able to create evil because he's not a creator but he took what god created and perverted it back into an evil thing which started all this trouble in the beginning now remember you gotta you say oh that was when he he entered the beast i'm talking about the beginning before time because my bible says michael and lucifer fought way before then right so here we got to go before the beginning we're not even in the garden of eden yet he hadn't got down to eve yet because his evil started where it's on one of my last quote sin did not originate on earth sin originated in heaven that's why heaven and earth's got to pass away that heaven not the eternal one that heaven because i believe that's what god didn't step out of eternity he just stepped over and he said all right i'm getting ready to bring something forth but i want y'all to remember something real quick satan did not change god's plan one bit because it wasn't an idea that god had god didn't say well i got this idea i'm gonna create this next guy and this guy's gonna be just like me without creation he's gonna just take care of everything and everything's gonna be just wonderful it's gonna be a garden of eden and we're just gonna have a wonderful time no he knew he had to create satan though or lucifer and let him make a choice right so that puts everybody because you say oh bob doesn't the bible tell us that we will judge angels now why would there be a judgment of angels if there wasn't a right or wrong to them everybody putting this together are we okay we're not we're not way out we're not way out on a limb somewhere is that all right we will judge angels what they're going to come before us and we're going to judge them by what they do but satan couldn't create and that's what made him mad i believe because then what did he do he said okay buddy what you create i'm going to pervert i'm going to turn it into something i like [Music] i'm going to turn it into something that i want to do because remember we'll read a little bit later on here in isaiah how art they're falling from heaven oh lucifer satan has got to actually ascend to go back to be like god a sin because he's already been kicked out of heaven right so i got a little ahead of myself so let's go back to ezekiel let's go back to number eight the first creation was god himself there you go first creation was god himself all right so why is that god now has become an object of worship because there's something there to worship him right all the angels i i'm not gonna i'm gonna go out a limb god god didn't create angels and then stop saying i'll create some more or i need some more god's not like that that would mean god would have an idea or his thought process would not be eternal his eternal thought process boom there were all the angels he created them gave them the ability to be anointed because they're spirits but they're real brother braham said don't you worry they're real remember he let his son see one of them the angel lord let his son see one demon that was some kind of demon so he looked like that alley-oop guy on the con now most people don't even know what a cartoon is but they used to be in the paper and alley-oop was a kind of a danny's laughing because he knows he used to be a caveman looking god well that's what that demon looked like see they all were created though to worship god god can't create something perverted now let me tell you something else that we're real quiet here because i said i don't have no quote i'm stepping out i'm going out on a limb because listen god did not make those angels eternal why would we have to judge them at the end scratch that beard ball got that beard he didn't make him eternal because a third of them fell right right and satan lucifer whatever you want to call him satan lucifer devil whatever you want to call him lucifer i guess they put it back more to lucifer was god's right-hand man but so here's lucifer standing there got all the power to do whatever he wants to do except create right and now let's interject right inside here right there we had satan come on the scene or lucifer everybody got that say ma'am if you don't agree with me brother they'll straighten me out you don't worry about it okay i may get a chicken house call terror so you don't ever want them chicken house calls so he said come on let's go to chicken house you know you're fishing to get something so i'm not afraid that this would go any further if it's wrong okay all right so the first creation was god himself who was part of that lucifer he created something to make him god now is everybody okay with that because remember he was having him go back and read all your quotes he was elohim self-existent nothing going on nothing and then all of a sudden then brother branham you brought the other quote the other day where brother baby said first creation was what angels to worship him had to be lucifer and all the angels even the third that fell right had to be created but now remember watch this this is what really helps me they were given a life but they weren't given eternal life right everybody got that right man now see an animal's given life but not a human life and definitely not an eternal life right so god is life yes but he's not all eternal life when you come on this earth you got a life right and he wasn't eternal life adam got life wasn't eternal remember he was created a living soul and then god put that genesis 1 26 man inside of adam that's where a lot of people don't agree with that but i agree 100 if he just said boom there's my man there's adam no adam was created a man and then the breath or that genesis 1 26 man which we may get to today may not went into adam to make him what an eternal son an eternal son of god in his soul not in his body not in spirit in his soul i mean you know you you have to when we do this you have to piece all these quotes together because brother branham said one day adam will reach over and grab ahold of eve evil grab hold of seth set and then we'll head right up to glory well now they ain't going to glory without the holy ghost so they had the holy ghost that's when i said to others sunday i said you know eve was deceived and she said she had the holy ghost in her soul but she just wasn't taught she was a baby she wasn't a baby but she was a baby and she didn't have anything she didn't have anything to work on you and i have something to work with we have the bible we have the word of god at that time she just had adam okay so the first creation was god himself so here lucifer comes on the scene lucifer comes on the scene but all of a sudden here comes something called the logos and satan's standing over there looking at it lucifer and he's watching it say let there be and boom there's a universe let there be there's a son and no lucifer's over here going hey i want to do that i i want to do that and god's going didn't create you for that stay in your position right stay in your position satan's going i can't stand it that thing's over there and it's creating and i don't know where it come from and i don't know what's going on but i want to do that same thing and god's going i created you to worship me that's all i want you to do and satan in his in his in in i just read it he was god's right-hand man but iniquity was found in and we'll read a little bit later in two different places ezekiel and in isaiah 14 and they're revelations 12. it proves satan fought with michael and had to be driven out of heaven well that's the same thing happened now but i want to watch now watch this when that logos came out to speak it wasn't a different person it wasn't a different personality you say oh i believe this is where satan got the trinity idea from because he's standing there watching he sees this form here and he sees another form go out of that form then he sees another form go out of that form he says there's one we know that the bible says the devils believe in one god and tremble but satan what perverts that by coming down here and telling us there's a father and there's a son and there's a holy spirit i think i'll make them believe that because it ain't true remember he doesn't do much he doesn't like truth very well he he doesn't like truth very well so he likes to pervert truth so here's this halo of lightning starts creating and satan's like i want to do that well he gets so mad he gets in a fight with that logos i'm here correct me if i'm wrong that logos couldn't be nobody but michael christ and they fought right i'm sorry my two lamb and they fought we're gonna read it i'm gonna read it real quick in revelations i'm jumping around brother joe i'm sorry revelation 12 7 said there was war in heaven and michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was there a place found anymore in heaven yeah because you know what satan couldn't pervert anything in heaven he said i think i'll go to earth there's some people down there that need some that has to make a choice just like i did and i'm going to influence them can't make them but i'm going to influence them guess what and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now it's come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by what the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony they love not their lives unto death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he has but a short time let's read isaiah 14. you don't believe satan's down here watch this how aren't thy fallen from heaven o lucifer you lost your position but god didn't take away his power right yeah he needed it but remember stop right here real quick god didn't give lucifer eternal life he gave him life he gave the angels life not eternal life now this is why i love to genesis 1 26 that's why satan can't understand genesis 1 26 because that man is not just life that always was with him that was with him when he was elohim that's why elohim it says 30 times in the book of genesis even after he says let us make man in our own image he still was god not lord god because that's elohim self-existing even though that group of people was brought forth the genesis 1 26 man he continued to be one god he continued to be elohim self-existing because that genesis 1 26 man wasn't created on the sixth day your 2-7 man was on the sixth day everybody got that am i losing anybody everybody okay genesis 1 26 man never was a day it was not a part of eternal god amen folks that is why you're so special that's a reservation that god had talking about a secret see that's the secret that satan couldn't understand because when that logos went out it had power to create it had power to give eternal life satan couldn't do that so i'm going to pervert this i hate this man now that created me so i'm going to take everything he touches and i'm going to pervert it and i'm going to make a third of the angels believe my lie remember it said he took his tail and sweeped him out brother brown said it wasn't a lie it was deli and the tail that satan told not his literal tale it was a tail that he told t-a-l-e what he deceived him right yeah you never heard that before well it hit me three days ago good boy it didn't hurt you did it but it was a tale he told it wasn't his t-a-i-l saint don't have a t-a-i-l but he has a tail t-a-l-e that he told a third of the angels and they believed him and they were cast out how aren't they falling from heaven oh lucifer now it's not just him when you say lucifer you've got to include his angels he didn't just come down here by himself and leave no it says they all were cast out of heaven down to here now not down to here to go into a human being and become a human being brother brown said can't do that because that would make him a creator can't do that but he can pervert and that's what he did when you were born you were born with life l-i-f-e remember i preached a long time ago two lives paul said the life i now live so that must mean he lived one before the life i used to live was a life given of god now the genesis 1 26 man always was there but you didn't have it in possession or it would have made you something special what makes you something special is when you say god i've gone long enough in this life that i'm living now thank you for giving me breath because your parents didn't give you breath your parents gave you a body god had to give you life but now god thank you that you give me this life so that i can make a choice to get eternal life and you got it there already it was way back when he was elohim it was way well before satan was even created look how he preserved you and me all that i'm like i'm to make spoken word church shout out now listen i'll go with you on that you always was that part always was eternal yeah that's not just regular life right that's right angel's got regular life looser got lucifer got regular life human beings got regular life that's why brother brown said if you're not born again you're cannon fodder one day your soul is just gonna go away it's just life come on look how special you are though because of god not because something you did god preserved you that genesis 1 26 man will never fall it'll never be he'll never be a part of satan this might be the first life if you didn't serve him pray for me i did yeah i hear some of you say yeah we all did we all served that first life we that was a perverted life it came into this earth perfect just like he gave lucifer perfect life i just read it i created you the day that i was created i created you perfect that's why all children babies before the age of accountability go to heaven god can't judge them for not knowing right from wrong so you get a perfect life from god tell me where else life comes from brother brown said life comes from nobody but god but he didn't give you eternal life when you first was born or you do away with redemption he had to redeem those that had fallen he made a sacrifice for adam and eve before the foundation of the world even while he was god elohim in his mind he died on cross i got to go die for those people because i know what they're going to do but all what a great time that we're going to have when we connect back up over here in the end i might be separated for thousands of years because of this guy that i know was going to do what he was going to do but i'm going to have my plan anyway actually he was in my plan all along amen how are falling from heaven oh lucifer sun of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which does weaken weakened nations oh he thinks he's got it whip now he's got all the gold he's got people in his corner he's got power on earth for thou has said in thine heart remember god knows everything he knew the very thoughts of lucifer before he created him he knew it for thou has said in thine heart i will get back up there somehow he's so full of himself i will exalt my throne above the stars of god remember that's where he was at to begin with i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation hmm congregation's people in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds look at all them eyes now look i love it when god says i will but i don't like it when that guy says it i love it when god says i will i will save you if you'll just accept me but now that guy's saying i will cause listen it's a lie it's all a lie right i will ascend above the heights of the clowns i will be like the most high yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms one day we'll look at satan he'll be laying on the side of a road a drunk all beat up and and just awful looking guy but that guy is the one that tormented you right you on your whole earthly journey that's what that guy did but he had no power he's telling you right now this is they that see these shall narrowly look upon them consider these saying is this the man is this the man i feared all my life the boogeyman the devil the demons no everybody okay man everybody good let's go back to uh number eight uh well joe thank you brother anderson i think long arms is back there i'm pretty sure he is so the first creation was god himself then there was angels to worship him then we see what happened is as god came out to create and all these things started happening satan got worse mad and worse man to me i'm just saying that's why he just got so mad that he could not be a part of that and see that's why god hates a christian i mean sorry satan hates a christian he can't get in your soul he can torment you all he can in the flesh and if you let him in his spirit in your spirit but he cannot once you're born again there's no way satan can get his grimy hands around any of that it's like touching a 10 billion volt wire see how important it is getting you bark amen it's the logos it's the ain't the son of god the baptism of the holy ghost in the son of god the baptism of the holy that thing that said let there be i know satan was standing there out in the woods with brother branham i know he was there because he's everywhere that's right and my brother brown said let there be a squirrel come out on the end of that limb thinking got mad because he can't do that and you say i know satan's going how in the world i perverted that guy i i made him do him you all of us i made them do all that but look at them now i can't get them to hold a beer in their hand i can't get them to say a cursed word i can't keep them out of church i can't huh why because you don't have that life anymore that's what we were talking about the other day permitted power that's exoce of power you can't have dunamis power and not be of god dunamis power is eternal exosia power is not we already covered that and that's what he gave lucifer he didn't give loose for eternal power but he did you and that's what lucifer hates folks that's why he's come out of all them out there he's comfortable he's not comfortable when he comes in here but he wants to be so much like us what do you got that i don't god why can you pray and and this this and i'm going to say this loosely this thing that created me comes and helps you you know satan's that's his whole thing he hates god right he hates anything that's righteous so he don't just take it and put you in a beer joint and put you in a i'm going to say it whorehouse he put you in church that's what we're facing now but that son of god the logos which was the son of god came out and started creating and then all of a sudden here's adam satan's going where'd he come from because he's a spiritual being remember first adam the genesis 1 26 man spiritual being first where'd that come from satan's got all these problems he can't he can't understand where's all this come from that that i'm supposed to be god's right-hand man well you were until iniquity was found in you is what the bible says you were fine lucifer until you decided to do what you did and now he hates everything that god does remember he hates it because he wants to exalt himself above right he don't want to be equal not anymore he wants to go above but look then out of the logos which was the word remember satan can't be anything in the word except written there he can't be the word made flesh amen you can be jesus is you can be the word made flesh but he can't and he can't even stand to look at the bible because every time he looks in the bible he sees his end he sees his destruction he sees the whole story what an unbeliever then out of the logos came forth to man so satan goes one two three that looks like three different people i think i'll just twist that and pervert it and i'll just feed it to him and you know what the people ate it amen the people ate it up and it ain't brother brown said that doctrine came from what hell and who's there what's satan so he created that doctrine because before the beginning he was standing there and he watched all these attributes of god you say how can that happen you tell me one thing you know i believe that god is faster than the speed of light speed of light's 120 000 miles per second i'll thank you what did right how can he be so fast as to come and help me in my need and then give the baptism a holy ghost to somebody in china just like that or appear to somebody just like that he was so he was so much faster than even satan because remember satan was a created being god so fast he could jump over here and create everything you say how in the world brother brown said on the day of pentecost god divided his self brother dale was covering it this morning god makes himself more powerful by dividing himself that's what satan can't stand because satan can't create so he can't multiply except to anoint that's why in the end time that's why he's so so so deceiving he can anoint you to think you've got what you don't got i don't know that wasn't bad that wasn't good english but it got the point across because look satan was right here folks he was standing here because remember he would that's why when we dropped down into the beginning of time before the beginning of time satan's going hmm all right so if i can get some of my people together i hate thinking like the devil he you can't i'm gonna get my people together and i can't create but now remember god before he created human man created the animals gave them a life and told them to multiply and replenish the earth sexually male and a female and nothing's wrong with that nothing would have been wrong with adam and eve what brother brown said was adultery was the right act perverted who perverts it satan all right so you come to the time where he's going all right i can't create but i got to get myself in the human race i got to get in there somehow cause i can't i've tried my best to get adam now look i don't think adam was totally hands off i think the beast talked to him too but he couldn't get to him amen because he's typing christ couldn't get to him but he could get to the bride he could get to eve because she was emotional she had emotions satan could work on that emotion because he's seen the whole thing he sees listen folks he's what since before the beginning he's been there and when when god said in genesis 1 let us make man our own image and in our likeness and let them let them multiply satan just tells eve says i don't see any multiplication going on here god told you to multiply i was there when he said it see what i mean how slick he is so he took it by a natural seed listen you and i were supposed to be born by spiritual the spoken word is the original seed no sex involved but satan knew he could enter in through that line because god had created animals to be able to do that real simple to me when you see that but in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh that's what satan can't do and he can't stand right it's for you to get born again why because he's lost you he's lost you forever he's lost you for an eternity you can't be touched by satan anymore on the inside guy you even in the sixth dimension i don't believe satan can wander around in that sixth dimension no no no no no no no that's perfect love i heard brother i'm saying just on the quote this morning on the on the video here that's perfect love that's where satan can't get to right he can go up and down all over the earth he can go around he can go in the fifth dimension he can do that sixth dimension he cannot go in now i believe he's still going to seventh dimension for right now because that's where god is but remember in the book of job god said hey satan where you been he said i've been going up and down through the earth remember what it says you know up and down through the earth and doing he said hey if you consider my servant job so he had to be talking to him why because listen lucifer was his right-hand man at one time so let's read this real quick ezekiel 28 verse 11. everybody all right i mean i'm telling you it's just i kind of stepped down on the limb here but i i just feel that if if you're gonna if we're gonna talk about two spirits we need to know them from the beginning before the beginning like brother dale was talking about the beginning of the creation of god all right now remember again the word created in genesis 1 26 that man was never created as lucifer was created everybody understand that right because lucifer was created a spiritual being but not eternal now genesis 1 26 man is an eternal person and it's jesus christ everybody got that i mean that's the logos whatever son of god whatever you want to say because that was you that was your birth that was your new birth not the birth you had before so it's got to be that you say well where did the two seeds come from before the beginning do you want to say see when we say seed i don't want us to we say seed we always go to a sperm or a germ or a little bitty some little grain of something the bible tells me that the seed is the word of god and anti-seed must be anti-word because there's only two then if but if we go to that though then we're all done for if there's two seed lines and they're natural and they're natural just two seed lines and you can't change two you can't make a a germ eternal that was born down here right right so we're done for where are we going what are we doing there's another race up there somewhere you know that's eternal no god said no no in the act of redemption remember you got to redeem that that was lost yes not a whole new person you understand remember brother brown said he don't believe in transmigration of souls he didn't migrate your soul out he changed yours right he didn't exchange it he put that eternal life that he spoke before the foundation of the world in genesis 1. he said you've come to that place now you're going to be a part of the logos because why did that little that little lick of fire on 120 in the upper room why did it say it was a lick of fire it was why it was the logos the son of god didn't just stay over their head and you see these pictures of jesus you know they paint and they got the halo over his head i don't listen if a man like that would have walked into the temple and there's caiaphas being a spiritual man and jesus walks in and he's got this halo glowing around his head they wouldn't have thought he was the devil he was a common man he had it inside listen that's what brother dale's preaching on the secret there's a secret the secret is you're eternal living in a doomed world you was born in sin shaping iniquity come to this world speaking lies drugs perverts whoremongers can i be anything else listen to all kind of perverted stuff did god just kill you no way we no he just said okay i'm waiting on you i've already put something up here for you i got something right here and i did put i did give you an angel to watch over you thank god man remember only the redeemed have angels what they don't have fallen angels right no they got angels that god said you protect them amen you keep that tractor from turning over you keep that guy from i just i thank god we coming back from a fellowship meeting every time i go by that place in dahlonega i mean in dawsonville i think about that evening i had a van full daddy had a van full and we were coming home from brother pageants or somewhere up there and right there in dawsonville outside of dawsonville down that long straightaway before you go up the hill where the forestry commission is over there on the right never forget it and they have that little corn maze thing over there coming back home not coming to dawsonville going away crossroads right there i went through it and just a split second a guy didn't even stop in the stop sign he went between me and brother dale now folks that split second because i was running 55 dad was running 55 we were heading home we were just far apart because i saw i saw in my rearview mirror i saw lights go by and then now over here i see this red light you know he put his brakes on the guy had completely run across folks one split second not one second a split second either that's way i've learned this a lot brother boyd and then we all i just say brother boy because you're sitting there if something and uh jim's always told me this i you know me i want to be on time pop wants to be well most of us dale's want to be on time 99.9999 we want to be on time but if we get off for five minutes it rattles us a little bit terrorism back up shaking ahead you better agree one thing's for sure be careful that may be the five minutes you need that god knows you're gonna get in the wreck how many times have you come up on a wreck and it be in front of you five minutes or what you understand what i'm saying so i have been trying to help myself or get god to help me that if we're a little bit late james you know i'll be a little bit late and i'll be jim says everything's for a purpose but if we would have been one split stack if we were to stop for one split second or even slow down that guy would have either hit me with a van load of people on this side or hit brother dale van gaal that thing went just like it was in a movie we were just this far apart maybe from here to the to the door and that guy slid right between us running the stop sign right through the right through the uh four-way stop because i called daddy i said what was that he said uh we almost got hit he said that guy went right through that stop sign and didn't realize it until he got away from us and then he slammed on his brakes well that was a little bit too late but you know what that's your angel that's that's what god has given you like i said wednesday night when god's done with us we need to go but if he's not done with us i don't care what satan does i don't care what man does you're not going until god says that's my child and i need him home i said about brother dale roberts you're not going to leave this earth until your journey that god saw that he foreordained and he predestinated so should we walk without fear yes but we shouldn't be fearless let's let's don't go stand out here in the road no that's tempting god don't do that we know better we know better than that but listen just remember god created satan and he turned into the devil he created lucifer lucifer turned into the devil because of what his choice you have a choice if the devil had a choice that god the creator created to be his right hand man had a choice all the angels are going to have a choice you got a choice so see that's why god is a true and just judge every person we always think when we come to the when we come to the white throne which thank god we don't have to stand in why because genesis 1 26 man's already been judged he's judged eternal that's right amen amen when christ went to calvary he had that man in him when christ went to hell he had that man in him and what is that man it's a subdividing of itself in his bride it's not listen it's not foolish virgin eternal life right right oh lord it's not a cup of water in my name eternal life no they're not god's children god had a place for his children before the foundation of the world satan can't touch it to me that's the secret that's the hidden mystery that god has you remember when brother brown got to the seventh seal and he said you know what he said if i say something he said satan's going to attack it and i'm paraphrasing he said but if i keep it inside he said satan can't get to that see listen satan can't affect your soul he cannot it's eternal he's working in your spirit your memory reason conscious affection imagination he's working in that realm he's not working in your soul your soul today is eternal glory thank you lord son of man take up a lamentation on the king of tires we're going to read the whole thing and we'll quit give us something else for the next time we're not finished at all but remember one thing's for sure satan was created he's not a creator and that has nothing to do with that genesis 1 26 man when you were born as a baby that was not that genesis 1 26 man that was life that god had listen you say that oh yeah remember god has to work under what he says right remember when remember when the man said oh eve said i've gotten a man from the lord how can that be that's right real simple brother brown said god's only one can give life satan can't give life god give cain his life but cain chose remember it said when they were older he didn't judge him as a kid he judged them older age of accountability he judged them though and he said cain if you'll do what your brother abel did you'll be fine right that's bible if you'll do like your brother so ev what i'm saying everybody is going to be judged except the bride of jesus christ angels lucifer has already had his judgment and those that follow him but everybody's going to be judged on what they've done on this earth it doesn't matter who except the bride of jesus christ because it exclude that genesis 1 26 man is excluded from any fall oh that'll make you happy for us it never fell life over here fell because god said every seed shall bring forth of its kind so satan goes hmm that beast that beast because brother brown said that he knew the knowledge of the principles of life satan did and when he entered that beast he said if i can get into that human race i'll inject a natural seed and that's going to turn into my people my people that'll be my group he was he was fooled all for a time yeah he's filling the world full of full of his people but he ain't going to live here right son of man take up lamentation on king of tires and say unto him thus saith the lord thou seedless up to some full of wisdom don't tell me satan's not done he's not dummy and perfect in beauty though i spent a need in the garden of god every precious stone was not covering the sardis topaz diamond barrel onyx jasper sapphire emerald carbuncle and gold see how beautiful he is that's why john admired him hello everybody in revelations that wasn't god's church that was the devil's church that john admired sitting on that scarlet covered beast excuse me the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes were prepared and then the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth whoa and i have set thee so so god gave him a position thou wasted upon the holy mountain of god thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire what's a stone revelation but remember god's got a secret he's got a secret and it's me and you i might have got ahead of you sorry but that secret's me and you satan cannot create so he can't realize how i i'm trying to get you to do the things you used to do the things i used to do i do them no more things i used to do i do them no more right things i used to do i do them no more why different life right paul said to life i now live what he was talking about that genesis 1 26 man it took over amen you've been consumed by the almighty you have been consumed by the eternal you have been given holy ghost and fire to burn out all that and then that genesis 1 26 man just comes right in thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence thou has sinned thou therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy the old covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty hey i look better than that guy down there that that jesus guy he just ain't that good looking i'm a better looking guy that heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reasons of thy brightness because remember we're going to read in just a second he was transformed to an angel of light i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries always in the church by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee god is a consuming fire but now what happens hold on a minute god did that to me but he don't hurt his children he cauterizes he cauterizes and it don't hurt so bad satan he's fixing to when he hits him with that fire he's going to destroy him because why he was made from a different source listen if you and i are born again we come from that source of that creator not from the source of lucifer even common man didn't come from physical lucifer he has no seed he perverts god's seed he perverts god's life oh it's just oh it's so good i will bring forth the fire from the midst of the it shall defi it shall devour thee and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be anymore never shalt thou be anymore let's read one more let's go to jude 1 and then we're going to read the greatest battle ever fault go to jude 1. we'll read some of this a little bit later i'm sorry i've skipped around a little bit look and the angels which kept not their first estate now brother brown talks about this this is where those fallen angels what was their first estate god created and perfect [Music] god give them the state of heaven hello wake up just for a minute yeah yeah that's right they had a position stay with your first estate but left their own habitation hath reserved an everlasting chains under darkness and to the judgment so they're going to have to be judged of that great day let's read the greatest battle ever fought the quote there you go greatest battle ever fought in 1962 we'll close right here musician get ready to come after this and i believe that's the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go into action now why hadn't it been before remember this is the apex oh yeah this is the apex this is the finishing of the battle between christ and i say christ i mean his bride because christ is not on earth he's in bright form now he has immorphied divided himself into a bride same logos same god same eternal life satan hates that because he can't get any of that and when he touches it's like touching 20 million votes with electricity and it's now ready to go into action i believe that god has been selecting his soldiers i believe he's been dressing them training them remember this is not a picnic it's a battle and the battlefront is now set getting ready to start this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings all human beings what to anoint you remember if satan is the anointed cherub all of his little minions they're anointed too then the battle from angels became human battles listen folks they can influence you but they can't make you do something just like god remember brother brown he said even the holy spirit is a timid spirit he won't make you do anything he'll stand right there and he'll wait on you look how powerful you are and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since huh and what's he doing watch this let's go to second corinthians 11 we'll read that and the musicians come on for such are false apostles and deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ there's your two spirits it's so false it's almost real no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light he can't deceive you if he comes as the angel of darkness he comes as an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also shall be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works we'll bring a scripture next sunday musicians come you can close it down scripture says lord lord have i not cast out devils have i not healed the sick have i not preached your gospel that's the same thing judas did and you know what he's going to say depart from me you never were a part of that genesis 1 26 man because i never saw you accept me we never had a love affair because that word new is not new if you look that word up in your strong concordance it's the same word as when adam knew his wife eve now see that was a sexual relationship we're not having that now we're having a spiritual relationship with jesus christ amen and that's what it should have been to start with satan satan had a knowledge of that and how he perverted he turned it natural i'll get into the natural people and i'll grab me a bunch of people man we'll just have a we'll have a bowl let's stand to our feet god bless you two spirits from before the beginning glory but guess what you were with the eternal before the beginning if you're born again today if not you were life and that's all you'll ever be satan is life he was given life by god but look satan can't give life that'd make him a creator he perverts the life that god gives us and then when christ came and died on the cross to redeem those what that were lost there's your plan of redemption he didn't redeem the devil's kids he redeemed his own children that genesis 1 26 man can't be bought can't be sold can't beat it's eternal it's a part of god it's not a second person when that when that form stepped over and started creating that wasn't another person right that was god moving so fast he could still be standing right here and be standing over there at the same time amen oh come on people heaven wasn't empty there was god standing there there was a father and there was one down on the earth because that's what satan couldn't understand if thou be god's just so much faster than satan is he's way faster than the devil because he's the creator and he's my daddy that's what makes us if we yield to him it makes us faster than the devil we can see his tactics before he even brings it to us we can smell it a mile away don't let it get close to you because remember if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound don't listen to it that's the devil it may be a horn it may be in tune but it's the wrong signal brother brown said to be in the wrong ranks at the rapture is no excuse we know that this is coming to a head and it's coming so close till it will deceive the very elect if it's possible which is not going to but it's going to be to where we're going to have to see though once we see that separation see when you get real close you can't tell a whole lot i mean it's real right here's real close but i get you out there a little bit further i can see what your tactics are don't let the devil get close to you resist the devil and heal what [Music] wow let's sing a song [Music] captives free sing it oh there's a river of life [Music] [Music] thank god we don't have that old life anymore oh there's a river of fire flowing out of me it makes a lame to walk in the blind to see [Music] within my soul [Music] [Applause] [Music] and give to me [Applause] that life abundantly see there's a secret the secret is is when god sent that little prophet william branham on the earth did you watch on here what are you saying he said lord if you leave me here i'll get a million more remember he was saying that he said oh these are millions of brandons he said no you're your converts remember when he come out of that quote he said lord if you'll let me live long enough i'll get you a million more well guess what he went on from this life but there's way more now that's born again under his message than ever was when he saw that across the curtain of time amen millions more around the world while it was a very in its infancy there in the 60s but now look at it so a spiritual multiplication that's exactly the way god wanted it he wanted it through adam and eve it wasn't a perversion but look what satan did he perverted it dropped us down into this other life that we live but what god do god sends the word and says if you'll believe in me the works that i do you shall do also and if you'll go to that upper room i'll give you the holy ghost tarry till i come back and then that was 120. now 3 000. now 300 thousand now millions of christians but think about the ones in the message that through that little prophet brother brown didn't give us a new way to receive eternal life no he just gave us clarity to what some people already had right because the devil were blind he can still blind us people he blinds us right now but remember your life is precious when you get eternal life that come from way that's satan's problem he was created right here you weren't created you were right there with that guy that come all the way down and all of a sudden boom there's lucifer and then all over here steps to logos and satan says ah where'd that come from i feel he's got a spirit about him i feel the anointing but i don't know who that guy is that's okay if he's inside of me i don't want him to know i don't want to know who it is if that logos is inside of me satan won't know who it is that to me is when brother brown preached christ is the mystery of god reveal now where is christ now [Music] he's inside of you he's not walking around the earth satan could feel all that you know if you be and you know i see what you're doing but he can't stand it when he don't know about you so you pray this week that god will reveal to you who you are i'm trying to tell you where you came from you came from the eternal you never had a beginning but yet there had to be a beginning of the creation of god brother they'll keep covering that but that beginning of the creation of god made way that you and i could have that new life right because without jesus christ coming it was just life and maybe some permitted eternal life in the old testament hello right but when christ died he released that logos and he released that logos on the day of pentecost and it was 120 and then as they were preaching under spiritual multiplication 3 000 come to be then 3 million and every how many million that's going to populate that world came out of josh was showing me a thing and i got it on my phone where it was you got here by two people right mother and the father if you go back 400 they you go back 400 years right josh it took four thousand and twenty-something people how much four thousand and ninety-four people had to get together to get you here wow because you got to go back to your parents parents they split off but you've got your mama's parents parents and then your grandparents your great grand great great grand i think that went the ninth the grand prix ninth generation up but it took four thousand people to get you here brother brown said god what he bred this one to this one this one to this one and this one do this one to get you here but you know that's really not anything that's man doing that god was standing there talking to lucifer and he already knew we were where we were coming from and where we were going it wasn't nothing new to him right i think maybe he tried to talk to lucifer and explain some things to him elusive were like i don't know i don't get that because you know what he hates revelation right i read you the quote brother brown said satan hates revelation he hates when somebody knows something he don't know he don't know jesus christ like me and you do glory and that makes him so mad and that's okay because remember he can't touch you until god's through with him he cannot touch you until god's through with you if the footstep of the righteous or order the lord and you're the footsteps of the righteous no way yeah no way i was reading where brother brown was talking about airplanes he almost died about four times in airplanes if you didn't know that one of them almost they said uh in an interview with billy paul he said one of them you could see the water he was going overseas he's you could literally see the waves before the plane turned back up one time ago them them guardian angels was pushing the bottom of that airplane you don't believe that i do i believe they thumped us on out of the way so that guy could right you know drive right in between us and not harm probably 20 people or more in those vans we would have had a wreck you wouldn't believe what a wreck we'd have had but you know what there were some born-again believers in that trail in that van and you know what they needed to keep on going they needed to keep on their journey so you just thank god that you every day you get up in the morning i just think yeah thank you for everything thank you for everything you've given me i got another day to breathe he said well i get older enough it foots footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord you don't worry about all them other peripheral things okay don't worry that you can't get out of chair like you used to or you can't do things like you used to do you're here for a purpose and there's a place to fulfill that purpose and you're standing in it right now you just got to believe that and you know what but you know why are you saying that by the way because when remember brother brown says when we realize who she is bride and what she's doing here she'll be an invincible army invincible listen we lose a lot of human battles we lose a lot of spiritual battles i don't know about you but i do i lose a lot of spiritual battles but when he said she'll be an invincible army what is invincible you cannot be beat she'll be an invincible army that's when death is going to walk up and we're going to go no not today not today no death no we know what you are we know where you come from and we don't want to have no part of it you love the lord god bless you let's bow our hands lord if anybody's sick among us we pray that you heal them now we pray that you bless the ones that are watching in lord that you'll take care of them lord and heal them father don't it doesn't have to be a natural healing lord it needs maybe a spiritual healing lord we people saying in the congregation or different places lord they need you father in their life they don't need somebody to tell them lord they know i know i need you in my life more each one of us do and father we pray that you would anoint us lord for this journey that we're taking and that we'll see the two spirits in the framework of the church and we'll be able to discern and to distinguish the tactics of the devil because many lord 99 of the people in this world are going to be deceived by satan father we know that'll happen but we know as i said before we've been protected we are the children of almighty god and we have a purpose and you had a plan and a purpose that we were totally included in it and we'll see this thing ended up lord in a body change when we'll just death will be destroyed and we'll take a rapture lord and go be with the ones that's waiting in that dimension lord this in that perfect love that's waiting on us lord to finish what we're supposed to finish and then lord will be taken out of here and then satan will just come down on this earth and and incarnate a pope and and all hell will break loose but lord it won't be for the bride father we've already been judged i want people to realize that lord that you'll give them comfort it doesn't matter if we're born again christians today let it sound around the world that we are the redeemed and we are the sinless spotless bride of jesus christ and we will not have to stand in any judgment lord you even told us we judge the world we'll judge the saints we'll judge the angels what lord because it's you you're the perfect judge and us being a part of that perfect judge lord it makes us unjudgeable in our soul father there's little things we have to get rid of on the earth we know that lord we're not saying we're sinless perfection but you know what we're talking about lord we don't have to be judged for the sins that we do we ask forgiveness for them and lord you are just to forgive us but not down in our soul we're just as eternal as you are lord and what a what a sound confirmation that is that we can lay our head down at night and say god i'll see in the morning this whole body's got to rest for a few hours rejuvenate but lord we long for that time where we don't have to sleep anymore well we can be in the joy of our youth and oh just to think about it lord yes that we'll enjoy an eternity with you and all your children all of us have like precious faith from all the generations from the ones lord that were fed to lions from the ones lord like paul that had his head chopped off and all the different ones we'll be able to sit around the table with him or walked down by the river and sat and talked to him for a million years what a wonderful time lord but thank you for giving us this earthly journey lord because without this earthly journey there'd be no redemption because you redeemed a group of people right out of satan's eden and we thank you for that lord father give us straight be with our pastor as he travels this week and us next weekend lord as we go to help brother jewel open his church up father we pray that you'd sanctify us for that journey be with the roberts family lord give them comfort as you only can and we ask just be with each one father in jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed god bless you see you wednesday night brother luis will be speaking
