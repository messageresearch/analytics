good turnout and everything and we really enjoyed it I figured that weight kept life and until then brother John and his wife you know that they figure out one of these days we rent here that we're crazy people you know we have a good time fellowshiping together and doing all of the things especially when they get on asking the questions and you know and the things and trying to figure out who could remember what and we had won one night and and I couldn't get no answers correct out of the whole thing so my wife said we're not playing anymore and that's okay because I couldn't remember they just asked the wrong questions there's a lot of other things but yes you know one of them they had their life's night I wanted to get up an answer it but that's one if you had like $5,000 and you could spend what was in a living room dining room with the kitchen said which one would you do and I wanted to tell them say well my wife would say let's put it in the bank wait till everything goes on sale and we could get all three of them you know that would that would take care of it that would be the way of doing but we did we had a real good time and good fellowship together and oh we

the fellowship meeting anything else father we thank you for your grace and your love to each and every one of us we thank you for understanding us and guiding us and thank you for being you and we pray that you would just come among us today and a great way and speak to our hearts and souls to set us free Lord and guide us be with the sick among little Thomas I run the temperature in order to just take it away from him all the sicknesses and things among all of us that you would just Lord bring us all through it you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so got each one as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name Jonah - we still honor thought what from salvation to Redemption we spent I don't know how many services on a title called salvation bringing us true from the Old Testament and then now getting into the New Testament in stalking of redemption Jonah - at 9 but I will sacrifice on to deal with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord all right let's go over to John 6 I don't think we'll get over to this point today but we'll we'll try to 6 we'll begin at 40 end up foot down 42 yep 42 and they said is not this Jesus the Son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he says I came down from heaven Jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves now they're saying this guy's is he's better now watch him no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now to try to continue our our thoughts on but there's one thing I want you to think about now that we're dealing with the foundation and starting in the New Testament you know we spent all the time during the Old Testament we started into the New Testament hitting a few things and following over to the baptism of the holy ghost now remember that we're talking about the baptism of the holy ghost that came onto their Pentecost all right now you'll see the quotes will be saying this happened at Pentecost etc because that's as far as we're dealing with right now see it will we will start then once we get into the message a little we're still right here at faith then we'll start going up through this and out into the headstone the Lord willing and and covering it all right and but what I want you to thank with me today that there's a great gap between oh how would you say it between the people and God in the basis that you know it would it will take us a long time to cover the thoughts of trying to bring mankind to God all right because that's that's what it's being it's been that trying to do all right and and we we tried to bring it up to showing you the positive apex top line of what we were talking about okay so we talked about and we've covered it in the previous message that the new birth the baptism of the holy ghost and being born again is one in the same you don't break it down as the new birth being this part and the born-again being this part and the baptism being this part but yet when you start talking and studying the message that the prophet brought you're going to run into a lot of things that looks like that you know but yet you've got to remember that as I tried to express now the Bible is not written there's nowhere in the Bible that it would say and they gave an altar call to come and be repent of their sins they are to be justified or to be this it would always come and be born again receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it would be related into that area because that's the positive of it all right now we're still going to use something in the Lord willing we get to it in a minute because we're going to pick up the thought again that we use in the Old Testament of a potential all right but now remember remember this the new birth the baptism of the holy ghost the morning in experience which came on the day of Pentecost is not a partial realization it's perfect realization all right now you win this or if you won't deal with that it's perfect all right but then once you've reached that position to see what the Holy Ghost really is you'll find out that it's true that the Bible says that we read there are good many times that the Holy Ghost is an earnest to you all right see we've got to get to the new birth and then when that new birds we get it it's positive it's perfect but then comparing with what we need it is just an earnest all right you said well I got everything I need well that's true the worse the statue of a perfect man where's the adoption where's your your teachings of the Prophet that is involved and then you'll see you eventually when we get down to it we keep a little quote a little as we go along just every once in a while I'll quote something but brother Branham said I ain't conclusively prove that you're born again and then baptize the end of the body well you're gonna find that to be the seemingly contrary when he'll say that you can't believe until you're born again by the baptism with the holy God see there's a lot that goes with saying the baptism there's a lot goes with the new birth that's why to me now I didn't make the statement and I'm sorry sometimes I wish brother Branham had not made statements because that way you wouldn't be as positive to lean upon those things but he said during the church age book pirate a page 148 remember over and over he said very few people will believe all the way to receiving the baptism of the spirit or the Spirit of God everyone it says them now we're going to get to it one of these days and seen I don't mean this wrong I'm not a optimistic of which one pessimist I guess I'm both of them a little on the outside but you know this message is beginning to grow greater and bigger and bigger and bigger till there's millions probably now there's probably a million believers in Africa alone by now and I'm not saying don't buy that's the point we're gonna get to is to try to talk about some of those things to where we can get an understanding what the Bible still is right and the Prophet said it was still right to say fear not little flock well now 1 million compared to 7 billion is a little small flock ok so don't run off with the wrong idea with me of what we're getting at but now when he said very few will believe all the way to receiving the Spirit of God right now you've got to believe that to be true and just remember now that in the days of Noah it was eight people compared to how many people was in the world in that day it's a modern civilization like now if it was 1 billion it would still be a great if it was 1 million that it was always in the days of Noah and eight people went over an ark that's very small he said well you're trying to tell us we ain't going we ain't going if we don't follow the line up in the way and follow the way God leads for us to go we're not going I didn't write the book to say in Jesus and when brother branham verifying it what when he said to Nicodemus be born again remember what he done he emphasized the word must he said not just the fact that you could or you order we hopefully you must be born again alright so then trying to hold that point that the only way I can approach it without crossing the things up of the way the Prophet says it and then we'll just let the Holy Spirit's gradually let things in order is I have to look at the Bible as a very big as it's laid out and it's written up here I tried to express that to you Wednesday night it's written to it if it's positive point you know all right the highest the positive then we as human beings we drop down into the elements of life and living and doing and somebody asked you a question they said to brother Branham let's see I've got it in here where the people you know at the college when they call for brother Branham to come and talk to him and the people that said we'll well brother Branham said we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ he said and you have Christ said but we want the Holy Ghost they had caught on enough to what was being said wasn't getting them where they was going I mean needed to go and they were wanting him to express it to him you know to tell him and he prayed for it or they received the baptism of the holy God all right see that's what I've tried to say to you and I to be serious about it if this is not no polite thing to play along to move let's go I'm not gonna say I'm not saved I say I'm not saying I'm not saved well what good does it do to say you're saved when you're not saved other than a positive confession that God can come on the scene to that confession yes but does it make it positive me just because it you believe it to be positive no it's the only positive when God answers now in case I miss it here's where we're going to go from here we're going to go from the very beginning the very smallest point we can drop to in life and Christianity and salvation and things like that and then we're going to be climbing upward to look at the baptism of the holy ghost that come under there Pentecost as a positive statement or thought alright now we'd have to admit we're somewhere in between right I mean I don't think we're wearing up over your honor I don't think we've made in the rapture yet or whatever but you know we could be up in the pyramid and be going that's great but we're still not in the place we need to be it doesn't matter where we're at all right so let's be serious about it and just try to to remember that looking at the Bible looking at the message then the new birth the born-again experience the baptism of the holy spirit is the one in the same the site they came on the day of Pentecost and that is the goal for the entire Church of Christ you know the body of believers for us to come all right now we're going to be I'm gonna have to lay this down this way that we won't get to it but I have the statements written out before me so don't just run off with it when we start talking about believing over here is a positive statement you can't believe without the baptism of the holy God no man can call Jesus the Christ so I know there's a vast gap between your mentor believing and a spiritual believing of the baptism of the holy ghost because what was our life statements in Wednesday night's message what is the new birth but around said the new birth and the baptisms are same and we talk about the baptism as being the Spirit of God eternal life you know Christ so the new birth what is it the Prophet then said what is the new birth he said it's a spirit across from mr. God revealed it's the Spirit of God baptizing this end of the body the person of Jesus Christ being revealed to me and you so the new birth is a person the baptism is a person and remember I've emphasized over and over we we talked about baptism see that's where I mind lost our mind as human beings are locked up on the word baptism and we relate that as being something coming from up above or something falling on us or our quoting the book of Acts where it said the room was filled right with that wouldn't the birth the birth was the lick of fire that said on each one of them that went inside now do you agree with that I don't want to say I know most of you ain't agreeing with because you won't even shake it yes or no but I don't see how you can argue the point see the experience of the coming of the Holy Ghost was the person of Jesus Christ coming in living into the people which was the pillar of fire the lick of fire guard dividing brother Branham said himself among the people the wind and all like that was like it was with the Prophet you remember Elijah he was all left under sunlight of things but the little still small voice is what God is attention alright so then the top didn't what we're talking about of the baptism on the day of Pentecost was what tongues of fire set up on each one of them signifying that the Holy Ghost was there in each one of them making the pillar of fire and what is the new birth to mean you would it not be that when you receive the new birth a tongue a lick of fire would come up on each one of us well I never saw it right that ain't gonna do it see you putting it on something that you're trying to require something I'm putting it on a simplicity of the way the prophet described it and what they say the new birth would he said it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you you know what happened to end up a room am i right that jesus promised them the Holy Ghost will come upon you and what did he say it would do now what did he say what happened when the Holy Ghost would come we're over in the Matthew Mark Luke John he said it'll bring to your remembrance right so then they wrote the new birth is a revelation he said it'll bring to your remembrance whatsoever I've taught and watch it he said even teach you things to come brother Brandon said he not only taught him you know or revealed what dinner he said even reveal greater things to him now that's the Bible let's see we say baptism now listen I know the human mind we can handle the word new birth we can handle the word born-again but when you say baptism it's automatically our mind locks up to something coming from somewhere like raindrops not and it may happen that way I'm not saying it's not I'm trying to say the truth about it the room was filled but to win and only the things that happened it didn't go outside and teach them people when they said what must we do to be safe you got to go up in the upper room and wait let's great cloud come down you got to wait until all this great pillar you know of the clouds and all the rushing wind comes and you get it there was three thousands in little licks a fire lit on those people outside right we see we don't want to we still are locked and mine locks I know my dealers I'm trying to tell you I don't want no problem we're telling you what happened your mind locks with something like a pillar you know like a cloud coming like a mighty rushing wind and brother branham was standing there one day and a great rushing wind came by until his coattail brotherly veil we would listen him the other day talking about it he was darn solid so that those things happening but you know that didn't burn the body see if the prophets right he said what is the new birth brother branham chrysler mister god revealed then he answered it he says the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not that you shout it not you've done these things it's a revelation okay I can understand the bird being a revelation I can understand the board again but it's hard for me to understand brother Dale the baptism because we want a baptism we want something falling out of heaven and see that is where we're missing it come on I'm a hateful old dude but I'm try to get her truth across to you and I'm not saying for you to answer it but I'm asking you how many of you when you receive the new birth had this mighty rushing wind or this great thing happen all right now you solve your own problems I'm just trying to make a statement but see to every one of us we can it relate to the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to each and every one of us right that way one can shout one can cry one can do that why cuz that's the after-effects that's not the birth that's the after-effects of the birth all right see then looking at it and breaking it all across the top that's - that's your your straight line all right and then drop down to where we don't uh I remember a man preached a message years ago oh I won't call his name of this month somebody who may have listened to it but he called it the ones between and you know his thought was good I don't know what he meant but a lot of it because I remember I was young then but he was making it like they was a place for everybody well you know what there is in a respect if we believe it and we're going to approach this today from one point of just a point of believing believing and we're going to try to relate to that point of believing because that's what we've got the title you know we're from salvation to Redemption but the title is like cool being are believing unto all right because that's what we're going to be dealing with believing unto in other words believe it on two means one dying for sure it means one we started but two it means we're not where we're going right if you're believing unto that means you've started but it don't it means you're not dying now we can come back to that little word we used a lot in the study in studying in the Old Testament of potential because the potential is not a real thing but it's all the makings of that it just ain't into manifestation yet right so it's potential so then they the F brother branham that man did said you know at that college what do we hire he said you have the potential the man said what do you mean he said like you asked me for an oak tree and I'll give you an acorn or he said now in that when he described their corner corn they planted in it growing up and you know and being two shoots in the time all right now so think about it are you going to say I'm putting it back into your lap and you know because that's what everybody always does with me about it anyway are you going to say this church right over here those people are lost let's garden don't believe this message that was 70 doctors okay you know what I mean by they had just about what everybody bleeding 70 I mean you use get out of it so I don't have to explain that to some of you cause you're a star alright but now listen are you going to tell that those people are not believers are you going to say that away then so we're going to talk about believing unto which means that I said we've started but we haven't reached where we're going and we're going to talk about putting it cause I don't want to use the word too much but you know you can tell you use it you can use being warned again but remember being born again basically Peter you run your ex lot up to top and it's on my statue of a perfect man but now humanly speaking being born again is fine to be used you know it means you're in a process of something it simply means you've got started but you haven't reached your goal yet all right and see that's why brother Branham is so misunderstood because he'll make a statement and he'll be he'll go on preaching and he'll come around later maybe two or three messages and he'll say you know those people that believe so and so you know what he was one that said it but you know what he needed what he's talking about a lot of difference in knowing what you're talking about then running your mouth about what you think you know lot of difference in right he knew what he's talking about and he didn't mind saying if I've talked the truth now Lord you come and you honor the word I've talked right after he's done made quotes it sounds like wow you don't know what he's talking about cuz I remember where he said this is over here the other day see that's why that sister will get to it on blasphemous night she said brother branham the way you've taught it has made me to wonder whether I have though the baptism of the Holy Ghost or not she put it back to him because he'd the way he had told it and to take it I'll own it for you anybody wants to come over me I'd love for you dude to set out with me about two or three hours don't want to got laid on my desk and let me just pull the quote up say read that and read this read that read this I mean what brought around said not lay now cuz he say plenty of time you he said I can conclusively prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body and we already read Wednesday night we read it four or five pages from the church age book where brother Brandon says there's no two comings of the Spirit he said it's Father Son and Holy Ghost coming into you at one time he said there's no such thing he's saying I'm born again by the Spirit of God and then baptized the end of the body so now that run across the top there's you top now what about all these things down below that looked like he said okay what about it and we're gonna put these on here where the people understand what it I'm saying and running across the top line and then we'll go to the back of the message and then if we don't finish it to Wednesday I don't worry about it that's all right they don't have to pull these up he's just quotes we were using Wednesday night brother branham from the message expectations 1954 there's no to Holy Spirit's there's only one in the same Holy Spirit that gave Simeon that promise is the same Holy Spirit to drawed you out here tonight he goes into we read it for 150 for church age book that's the Father Son and Holy Ghost all coming in at the same time for it is one person comprising the Godhead that event took place at Pentecost there aren't two comings of the Spirit just one he said all of this row matter what you put out for Omega beginning the end and etc and all of them he said is just a description of the self one person you remember what we read Wednesday night said it would be better if everybody understood the oneness of the Godhead because what did he say it is a Father Son and Holy Ghost all coming in at one time for it is one person comprising the Godhead that Advent took place I done read them look reviewing back what we were talking about Windus t it was mass confusion when brother Branham wouldn't make an older call remember that one he'd make an all to call and people would come up and try to get to people that was dire to speak in tongues to do that that in the other and he said that wouldn't what he's trying to do he said what I mean is firm to come up and receive Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is what happened under their Pentecost huh look he said I mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born to the Spirit it to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one of the sign tells you what constitutes the new birth justification bad sanctification baptism when old ago constitutes the new birth okay now the end to get on the life part of the basis written I said they wouldn't be able to pull it how many of them do you want like this the scripture says no man can say Jesus is the Christ only by the Holy Ghost so you cannot believe that Jesus is the Christ until you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost how many of you need that see that's the end of the message what I'm showing you is the beginning of the message Jordan the top the end of the message shows the top now we back up in the middle and deal with potentially or whatever and god help me because this has been the worst thing to try to find a way to express what I want to express without it crossing in your mind and thoughts the word we can follow on all right what did we cover in the Old Testament we covered there was the salvation right there was a salvation in the Old Testament we didn't use the word Redemption because they would did not have the new birth all right so what they had was their points and thoughts were potentially they were potentially saved because they were under the blood of bulls and goats all right so they were saved they had a place to go to if they died all that and what did it start by number one it started by what this Hebrews says that no man can unless you wait a minute oh no you can't say that God is see you'll say was the Bible don't say God was vile says God is all right you got to believe that God is which means you got to believe he's real all right not he was so the Old Testament believers believed in a true God all right they believed he delivered he took her over he found her battles he done the things and they believed in a salvation so what they had started by believing well first that God is a rewarder of them that diligently even I know I see bruise but they've got they bad guy believed all right and they confessed and they say it and they they walked with God and God come on the scene and honored him and saved him and delivered him and made a place for them to go when they died you know a paradise although that was their salvation we're on so it started by man believing not great supernatural things to Abraham God just simply spoke to him and said Abraham get your wife your family and get up and leave well that be something with it going home tell your wife you know okay mom pack up where we're going I don't know what we gonna do I don't know rydym a true he was told to go to a place and he didn't know nothing about why he believed that God was speaking to him and it delivered him and the many things that was dark all right because he was a believer not a supernatural signs and wonders telling him study the book study the the Genesis account of Abraham sure he met God sure he done this that in the other with your Moses and some of them had greater experiences then Abraham did but abraham believed and that's why he's called the father of faith Moses is not called a father of faith abraham was because abraham believed well you know I ever have a plain old man bleak right it doesn't say now I'm saying that baby God dealt with him I'm just saying but it doesn't say anything about God dealt with him that God called him and he was a prophet or anything you know or ordained him or anything it just simply says all at once it just tells a little bit about this man Abram and it says that God said get up and go what are you a believer so that would put all of the New Testament I know you don't like me to make these statements but you know we preached Abraham was the father of faith in the Baptist Church where was y'all at no where was y'all that we preached to Abraham was the father of faith right you don't like that cuz he said well you're trying to make something off I'm telling you what brother Owen said it he said you've been Livie and Baptist alone with that word now I didn't say that statement he's what it did because that's what we've done see I didn't have Greer's almanac and all these other things to read I read the Bible and I'll tell you what I done they'd send out these things you know for us to teach Sunday School from you know little line up some scriptures inside I'd take their line of because I knew if I didn't they get on to me about it and say where are you getting that from so I'd read their scriptures and preach my story I just done it secretly I just I just used their cotton you know on their thoughts and that way they couldn't come along you ain't teaching what listen you know I am I read the scripture didn't it okay listen folks but when you come to the New Testament now the New Testament is totally based upon number one as the Old Testament was believing in a god that's real all right and that's believing now tried to express something to you because when I look at things and see it I look at a blank spot on in their thoughts and I say well the people are not gonna be able to cross over this over to here unless I put a little something in here you know in the thoughts and I tried to put a little thought in there about how that you know you and I we're believers all right and you start everything just simply in a believin manner just believe it it's not some great big supernatural time God doesn't come down and give you a revelation of Jesus Christ well that's you hearing it first right come on I mean you say I dip now do you all you want to the Bible said nobody can call Jesus the Christ because you're saying watch somebody else say it right so you know what 120 took them three and a half years you remember that you so what's that got to do with it that's got to do a lot with us cuz it took them three and a half years to get the baptism of the holy God but now there's pretty good believers wouldn't it they'd left everything and he done all kind of time and they finally came to the baptism of the Holy Ghost but then the second time coming of the Holy Ghost was the three thousand outside they heard words one sermon maybe they knew about Jesus maybe they knew about the different things well you know what go along ok what they heard worm sermon and went through justification sanctification the baptism in the Holy Ghost and got the new birth you agree with that the 3000 got the new birth the house it kunia it was just a little short time they got the new birth you counts in the Bible that they would just come forth and speak Allah and the new birth the Holy Ghost would fall on them but then you begin to see it gradually falling away then you would see people that Satan had penetrated the mind of mankind and started bringing these doctrines and ideas and you see the people as they that's penetrating them and they lose that I don't know how to express it I really don't know them but I know one thing they lost that ability to go through justification st. casing the baptism we'll all go at one time is it true now so it wound up being that that's why you had to have your Apostles than the things to write come on get one saying 3/5 at one hundred and twenty three and a half years the others one sermon canoeists one sermon now Peter and John and Paul O'Neill is going to how to start telling us about how to get born again and Peter tells it in in the scriptures about second Peter I believe it is one about the stature of a perfect man but remember that's a growth development in going upward that's not just a new birth the new birth has to come at the bottom of the pyramid where it says faith that's what your prophet said but you understand they not only could tell or Peter could tell about what would happen once you come but Paul and m's writings look at Paul go to the Corinthians and read the book of Corinthians Apollo dealing with them as babies when you need that somebody teach you the deep thing said we have to teach you the little what was he telling him he started telling them listen the devil had now entered into mankind he was loosed and now he's entered into mankind and he's teaching you wrong he said you already got it he said and he need this away do you understand her you might I think that's a valuable thing to anything but remember it takes you an eye I spent five years in the Baptist Church believing I was born again come in and hurt one or two messages in this message and I knew automatically I wasn't born again yet I was a deacon for three or four years in a Baptist Church I was teaching their adult Sunday School classes but there I was thinking it was all settled and I found out I didn't have it I'm not like most people most people in this message you know it through their only evidences they come into this message and they believe it well how come someone believes it 30 years and loses it come on how come they come in this message in your own fire for God for a little while in that while you see some doctrinal idea our situation takes them away and they take away great followers you know that's true some of you had never been out and listened to anything but talked to some of these it's been around a little bit but it'll work just why don't you have plain sins and just listen it shouldn't be anything to have to read a quote from brother Branham well you know you shouldn't have to read a quote from brother Branham to tell you the church begin to fall away until the church the bride wound up at Nicaea now I know you don't like that because there's a lot of people talk that's incorrect but you tell me brother Branham didn't say I'll show it to you they wound up at Nicaea and they came out of there sure they left because they left because they'd seen the wrong which you know what they brought out was little ideas and sayings it blinded the minds of the people do you understand what I'm talking about trying to give an illustration the 3,000 house the Keneally's Holy Ghost falling in the book of Acts on people just heard one or two messages and you see a few years later hauling them struggling trying to get people to come to Christ and trying to explain in the Corinthians especially called it's called the book of Corrections right to get them to a new birth why because Satan had entered man so much until these no longer live then you'd have to teach justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost to get mankind safe well we don't need to know about that all we need to know just get saved well how you gonna get saved well I didn't believe justice ain't a better lawyer I got it you didn't believe in if you're saying it that way I'm gonna doubt you got it because how can you doubt anything in God's Word and say you've got it now you tell me that and I'm sorry the most plain this can be but I'm blowing on that because I experienced it and I experienced justification and sanctification in a Baptist Church brother Branham didn't have to tell me to quit smoking drinking and chewing well when I got saved I quit that chew in the back I could I supposed to go out at repentance especially a sanctification but you see what I'm talking about the great Apostle Paul winds up having to try to tell people how to get born again and it starts taking time a lot now how much one more was that when it was lost the things Paul and him talk faith of the fathers now in quoting brother Branham so go ahead faith of the fathers why stood as far as you talking about in the church and working to about the fourth age when you come up through there with Martin and Columba in the at least had to line up correctly and was teaching the statue of a perfect man but what about when you dropped over to Lutheran West just barely a repentance right until brother branham would say they just had justification if he said potentially you need that one you need the ones where brother Ron will called out Lutheran Westland in potential they lent him a death but listen what are you trying to say brother Dale I'm trying to say one time it went from a basics of nobility to bring a person to Christ as just you know a message and now when it comes to Christ in one message well I did I come across yeah and how long is it took you to get rid of the devil out of your life after there I like people to write little things like a brother wrote and he said I got teary eyed and then found out it in that comes a lot I like them things see I'll keep on preaching this until we either get it or get out of one but you understand do you understand what I'm meaning are you gonna tell the religious world if they're lost brother brought him didn't he would bring it to a final analysis right that if you have the new birth you will come into this message or hear the message what Rocko's God will lead you well we've been through the seventies and the things like that to work that there's preaching well more bless God field believe everything you love then it was love so much until you can't even get the people of this message not a priest justification sanctification the baptismal old ago oh we're up so much resonated above there until we're out into the great headstone in the in the things well I'll just stay where the Lord leads me because this is what I've always told I've always taught the new birth I always thought we got to have it always talked it's got to be justification st. casing the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come to that place I've always talked and believing it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost in every church age go that's where your prophet told one of this brother so-and-so said it wasn't that will go a brother so-and-so Duong but listen just give me a minute this to talk with that little foundation what about when your prophet would say they see if I can pick up the message go ahead brother let's pick up we go to number 11 we're gonna be dropping back on to some other things we'll go over to number 11 which is the message why are people so talked about and let's think about it this is one message you need to listen to I've asked you to listen you must be born again this is one that goes with it already Intervale all of it goes with it but listen to what he says okay listen to your prophet see I believe that you believe into everlasting life I believe that your acceptance of the Lord Jesus Christ gives you everlasting life eternal life when you believe it then I believe by one spirit you're baptized into the body of believers come on are you reading I believe you can eternal life by you believing I believe that you then are baptized into the body of believers we're gonna get to it in a few minutes he said you believe unto life see your faith anchors you in Christ that's intellectual you believe it you accept it you say to this right you recognize it to be the truth and you're a Christian and you got everlasting life by believing it you've entered to God you're on the count ground man that's falling and you're eating it to remember way to the day camp ground out of cortisone count ground is just justification yeah no all right that seems to be contrary to where he was bringing out in the church age book it is all in one thing not just the king saying things bad here the whole dose but receiving the new birth and the baptism the whole ghost all shine now what are you going to say that's what makes me sick about these ministers you could take the truth of the message to try to express something and if the people would listen it would bring out truth but they won't listen to that because they've done been so Talde until they just they're not gonna do that what about it what about this drop back to number nine the message called hidden life 1956 it depends on where your faith stands your salvation is good as long as your confession is good but when your confession drops then your salvation is gone for he is the high priest sitting at the right hand of God to make intercession on your confession that's what happens that's exactly right shake your head at me whatever you want to that's exactly right right the way I believe it okay so I wonder why it is then when salvation and healing also that people will come at this low ebb now I want to say that the reason of it is I believe I can explain it to you if you'll be reverent and listen Sokol listen the rest of it he's trying to explain how we misunderstand the Christian life are you gonna say that statements not true because it's made it depends on where your faith stains your salvation is as good as your confession is good but when your confessions draw confession drops then your salvation is gone now if you'd listened to months ago or so when I started on salvation I told you I chose the specific reason for using the word salvation instead of Redemption I said one day I'll explain why I used the point of salvation instead of calling it Redemption you can be in salvation and working and going and lose it but you can't be regained and losing right you can't be redeemed and lose it which isn't how salvation and loses it's what your prophet said now there's more than that but that's enough I thought I understood when you've confused me good maybe I confuse you enough to you start worrying about God whether whether or not you're born again just remember I'm going quote brother Branham over and over he said if you are born again you will always agree with the word yeah but that's the way you read oh I didn't I didn't say it I just copied this out of her off the computer of what he said I didn't say this well you just pick that out well I'll pick out the whole page and read if you want me to I'm just trying to tell you we think we know what we're talking about but do we do we even know simply what the new birth is now I've done laid out two things lately on it do you understand it brother Brown said two new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you shouted cried done each time he said it's in Revelation so now do you believe the new March is a revelation no no no I thanks the baptism see and what a wonderful thought that the revelation of God can so baptize us the revelation of God can fill our very being with the person of Jesus Christ you're shouting you're crying and things like edit all after-effects you still hung you're still not following it in other words if I made a statement I said okay now let's see how many of you would state behind me the new birth is the born-again experience it's the it's the baptizing you into the body and it is a revelation done you just done it you just dozed off right into I done shouted Christ poking down you're still on that you're not listening to the Prophet he said the new birth was a revelation now you want this one you cannot be saved I saw Revelation chapter 5 I believe it and got it he said you cannot be saved without a revelation maybe you didn't get the new birth Oh he said you can't be saved without a revelation but do we believe that - ha I used to understand everything nothing you just confused me why what did I say it was confusing I told you what the prophets say what did you think when you read that in the book oh well let me tell you like it is let me tell you what she done we needs reading the book you turned real feist over that page brother tight him he he life and tell he said when he got to beginning to see the water baptism name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said I'd be reading my Bible now this is what he said he's not being reading my BA he said I come to acts 2:30 he's I just turned over real fast well the man was honest he saw a confusion but then when God revealed it that's why people can't follow this message this message is the revelation of Jesus Christ are you willing enough to admit that this message that's why they ain't a headstone to come out of glory this message is the headstone am I getting a church a book where he said about - the headstone coming with the baptism when the Holy Ghost the hitch don't be in the revealed Word I but I just don't I can't I can't follow yes can I get all confused well why don't you go ask God to open up your confusion and come tell me I don't want your brother dead I believe it don't right you think I'm was that yeah you're right brother you Creighton me out the baptism of the Holy Ghost is raindrops falling out of heaven or some experience or some happening ain't no need him coming to my office when you're talking like that we're gonna talk about what brother branham say we're gonna say brother Branham said it was a revelation now what do you got to say see that's where people you're not gonna follow it brother mocap telling me he said brother Dale they something said I know you he said you are not seeking signs wonders etc as a proof of the old ago you're exactly right but I'm not content with what I've got this was his statement he said you stop trying to figure out these things and accept God's Word which his word is God in letter form and said you believe God's Word and that was their words what you gonna say brother Dale I'm gonna say like the old brother did that picked up the track I'm gonna say you know I went here and I went there I did I went all over this for two years in this man see I had everybody in the mess he's praying for me any word they give over to call I'd be a novel to call for the baptism with Oh God like the old brother said do you mean to tell me brother branham I had it all the time now we can back up to trying to get an evidence of your whether or not which then you believe in the word what brought you where you are why don't you go back in your experience and watch your life and see I was here and I was here and brother crossed my path and this happened that way that happened that way and I heard this message and I heard the word I heard heard greater depth I heard from the Baptist I heard the Pentecostals and I heard I believe in that because you see I believe and still believe it's getting very rare but I still believe them denominations can produce a new birth but I also believe the rest of the message what the Prophet said they ain't gonna you ain't gonna stay there with the new birth and they didn't run me out I walked out of my own accord because I knew that it wouldn't hide most of you ain't got over the statement I read from brother Branham yet letter owner said there was nine hundred different ways of talking about salvation and he said they're wrong now I told you that that statements gonna hit you in the face that nine hundred different ways of seeing a new birth and he said but they're wrong he said well you just said to him not yes sir I believe you can preach justification sanctification to baptism on the whole go and a Baptist Church today and people can receive Jesus Christ they're not gonna stay there how do you know that goes that goes I didn't not so problem I didn't and you can't how can you stay there when it's contrary to the word what about a church you start your eternal life now I won't give you up just a minute and then quit we'll pick it up Wednesday you start your eternal life by believing now you ain't listening your eternal life starts when you believe it I didn't say you had it I didn't say you had to end of it I said it started when you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ now listen I'm quoting brother Branham truly believe not make believe he said when you truly believe not make believe he said your eternal life begins right dark he said well what do I got you got it potentially keep on believing because I told the Baptist preacher this when I was leaving out right prior to that I said how come you told us that all we had to do was believe and we had the new birth see they they knew better there try to so I we didn't he started off in we didn't I said hold it just a minute now you talking about this doctor in his teaching that you get the Holy Ghost when you believe is that right he said yeah I said well okay why don't you teach it that way they said well we try to do the word I said we didn't how come you left this scripture out the scripture says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved I said you always read it he that believes in his baptized I said doesn't say it and said he that believeth which is continuation that's why Paul could pick them up over there nopales and say have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed you don't get the Holy Ghost without believing can't you see then your experience can't you follow your experience instead of the signs and the wonders and the sensations and the thing look at where God had led you and what he's led you to I don't have my experience than anybody in this message in my experience I just explained it was when I realized God and His Word is one and if he has revealed himself to me then he's living in me darzee new birth it starts when you believe now can can we read this message again now when you first heard or believed mama taught you you don't have to believe this message not all that you know he went to church or whatever you heard and something struck you remember we read the scripture Jesus said you can't come to me unless the father draws me right so can you remember when God draws you to be real careful right here because the Bible says many are called but a few were chosen what's the problem why is it many are called fewer children how come he's just a few chosen because there's only a few that believed now Judas come on can I quote brother Randall Judas believed the rest said he went through judge thanks Jason he said he cast out devil you know heal the sick I don't remember where you were cast out Devils for Judas but it's awful da Levin did but he said he healed the sick and the things like that but then one day his believing stopped he stopped believing that that man was who he was and when he did he lost his salvation why because he didn't have an upward he didn't have an upper room experience that's what brother Ron said he showed his colors he didn't go to the upper room and receive had he went to the upper room and received the baptism in the Holy Ghost he'd been in the body of Christ so if you hold this to Wednesday night okay you start believing just don't stop believing don't let anything hinder that believing I remember when I first heard this message and the Prophet you know brother mode had brought me the message of the Prophet and I I would sit down and come in home at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning and I'd sit down at the table and I'd read a while I remember sitting I read one morning and I said Lord all this seems to be totally contrary to everything that we've ever been taught all I want to do is just ask you to be kind enough to me just understand just understand me and understand my ways and where I'm at Lord I want to be right and I want to follow you I said I want to know if this man was the prophet of God and that I can study his message from the basis of knowing he was a prophet I got one answer and every time I to ask him again I got the same answer no matter how many more times I asked him I got the same answer do you know what it was said what does the word say if I ask him today for an answer that's what he'd say what does the word say you know that settled with me tell me you'd call that see new birth I settled it with me he said what does the word say it's just like an inward thought come to him you're not an audible voice up in heaven or whatever it was just a thought see what does the word say what could I say see I had read the word I knew it like I told you when I read it and when I saw Malachi 3 in Malachi 4 I told my office and there'll be two prophets coming before the end of time because the Bible said it then I could handle John in his you know John the bad news I could handle that and Luke 1:17 up through that away in Luke to where it was speaking of him coming I could handle that and knew that brother boat said well what about a prophet I said where's it at he said Malikov for I said before you start much on that let's talk about this and who's Malachi 3 he says John the Baptist thank God I run into somebody that knew the word prophet you don't believe it the Prophet you gonna be left no he just told me what the word say when he finished explaining Malachi 3 understand I knew the Scriptures are they the Bible plainly tells you mother got three it Luke's 117 right through that area he said now there's Malachi 4 okay we deal that you see Church I was a believer my believing didn't stop my believing they listened let's be honest my believing wavered a lot you won't be honest oh no I believe when I'm 30 be aware of it I'm just gonna tell your lawyer that selves a problem with an argue point now the human mind wouldn't allow you to do that you know what I'm talking about when we read the word we wavered is this riders just wrong or what is there for what is that but I did it hold on they just kept on going and see I didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet I had seen God standing in the church at 11 years old and I've seen great things happen in a Baptist Church we bleed and praying for the sick I remember Wade he used to have talks was real bad just right after we come into message and tonsils were real bad he was just and they wouldn't take him out and you know there's so many cases with et cetera et cetera no brother tied him they were there and we came home from church and then had to stay home with Wade and we came home and then he'd have to take a bottle of you know like gallon jugs or something put ice and lay it aside his temperature was so high and we said you know we talked about it and we prayed and he'd go up and down I'm talking about real high to the burning up we went to the doctor's office on the way up I said Lord all I want to ask is one thing will you take away this temperature before the doctor gives me anything or does anything to it we walk in the doctor's office the doctor had come and medicines office were these fancy doctors but he was our children doctor so he came to the office room it was a Sunday he came out and medicine we walked in the door got just inside the door and Wade cut loose and vomited all over that place I was apologizing to doctor I'm sorry I know you don't have it just cleaned up you know we'll do what we can do he said don't worry about it said they'll clean it up he with this what he said he take him on back home he's alright but we just went on back home we believed Church this is it depends on where your faith stands when you're in that believing stage or just starting believing and coming up to the new bar where that he can come in you and believe you cuz now listen it's not you believing when he comes in you it's him believing it right there's a long journey in between that believe in Park you have to be careful because you can quit believing now that you get born again after you get the seal of God and I've even got it where brother Brown says you can believe until you're sealed in I mean you're believing until you're sealed in he said once you're sealed in it ain't you believing so now we've got a long ways to go but a whole lot of doing but listen your salvation is good as long as your confession is good but when your confession drops then your salvation is gone did he's the high priest that make us intercession upon our confession well I never thought about it like that alright think about it come on musician think about it you believe unto what is that is it's a scripture or which one is I believe this know where somebody said I believe to see your that maybe he's good you know how to see to believe I believe to see scripture yeah don't stop you believing there's two ways of anchoring into a problem and messing it up and the basics of us went back to where we believed and said that's it when I got it and forget over here where do you need to receive it see everybody oh it's anchored on I believe I got it I pray that that's true but I may have to quote the Prophet where he said very few will if you're believing down through there you know yourself is gonna waver don't lie to me ain't lying to you you know yourself you're believing wavered you went in and out you one day you're saved next day would that's where waves preaching another day or the outer court from a message on the inner veil or why are God's people so talked about outer court you got the sunlight when it's cloudy you don't have no ups and downs and ins and outs now quote brother Branham he said see you lie you'll do this whatever he says you'll cuss people out well I'd watch that when them cuss word starts jumping huh I'm playing in blunt and I don't mind saying it and I don't care to put it on tape I don't like to hear people when they'll to say that word like D a.m. and you say well that's a river with a thing blocking it it ain't what you meant you didn't mean it that way you meant something against God people just say well we don't matter for me to say D am I believe it does if you got have something else to say say Lord bless you people hit their thumb and they start saying cuss words don't you say praise the Lord I didn't knock the thing home oh you know if you do that you shut you mouth right let's damn believe it on two we'll continue on Wednesday go ahead brother well yeah anybody have a need your order [Music] helped out my unbelief lord help me believe you love him you love the truth [Music] I'm trying to encourage you not discourage you I'm trying to get you to say you come up this
