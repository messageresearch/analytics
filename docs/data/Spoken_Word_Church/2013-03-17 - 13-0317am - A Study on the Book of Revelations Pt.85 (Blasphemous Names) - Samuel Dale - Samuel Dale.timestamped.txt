[11:03] move on to
[11:04] a little more this afternoon of
[11:06] helping us all
[11:09] so the revelation of jesus christ which
[11:10] god gave unto him to show unto his
[11:12] servants things which must shortly come
[11:14] to christ and he sinned and signified by
[11:16] his angel and to it
[11:18] servant john who by record of the word
[11:20] of god
[11:21] and the testimony of jesus christ and of
[11:23] all things that he saw
[11:25] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[11:26] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[11:29] those things which are written therein
[11:31] for what for the time is at hand
[11:35] all right let's go over to revelations
[11:37] 18
[11:39] we'll try to get to this part today
[11:42] it says and after these things i saw
[11:44] another
[11:45] angel come down from heaven having great
[11:47] power and the earth was lightened
[11:49] with his glory and he cried mightily
[11:52] with a strong voice saying babylon the
[11:54] great is fallen is fallen it's become
[11:56] the habitation of devils and the hold of
[11:59] ever
[11:59] foul spirit in a cage of ever unclean
[12:02] and hateful bird
[12:05] for all nations have drunk of the wine
[12:07] or the wrath of her fornication
[12:10] the kings of the earth have committed
[12:11] fornication
[12:13] with her and the merchants of the earth
[12:16] are wax reached through her abundance
[12:18] over delicacies
[12:20] and i heard another voice from heaven
[12:22] and once a voice from heaven saying come
[12:24] out of her
[12:25] my people
[12:26] and be not partakers of her sins that
[12:28] you receive not of her pledge
[12:31] for her sins have reached unto heaven
[12:33] and god hath
[12:35] remembered her iniquities now what's
[12:37] these two verses here
[12:40] reward her even as she rewarded
[12:44] you
[12:45] now once reward her in other words give
[12:48] her the reward
[12:50] of what she done to you remember
[12:52] what we do under others is accounted a
[12:54] lot of times and we better be careful
[12:56] and and do things correctly right
[12:59] but watch reward her even as she
[13:02] rewarded you
[13:03] and double unto her double according to
[13:07] her works
[13:09] in the cup which she had filled
[13:11] fill her double
[13:13] remember the cup she had in her hand we
[13:15] saw back over wednesday
[13:18] how much she has glorified herself
[13:21] and lived delicately
[13:23] so much torment and sorrow give her
[13:27] first she said in her heart
[13:29] i said a queen
[13:30] and have no widower widow
[13:33] and shall see no sorrow
[13:36] she says that partly therefore shall her
[13:38] plagues come in one day
[13:41] death and mourning and famine and she
[13:43] shall be utterly burned with fire
[13:45] for strong is the lord who judgeth her
[13:49] you may be seated the lord had his
[13:51] blessing to the reading of the word
[13:54] now what i'm going to try to do is
[13:57] finish this morning
[14:00] that we've been talking about this
[14:02] mystery babylon
[14:04] uh these things you know
[14:07] and showing what it is and the mother of
[14:09] harlots
[14:10] and showing those things
[14:12] and trying to
[14:14] uh give an understanding
[14:16] to where that we can
[14:18] can move on and then we'll try this
[14:20] afternoon to pick up into more talking
[14:23] about the bride of jesus christ
[14:26] and our parts because we've been
[14:28] covering
[14:30] from revelations
[14:31] 4 1
[14:33] the rapture comes the prophet says
[14:36] we go up and we're not seen until 19
[14:41] then you'll pick up this evening some of
[14:42] the things and and all like that and
[14:45] that's what people can't understand
[14:48] they just go haywire when you make that
[14:50] quote even though the prophet owned uh
[14:52] feast of the trumpets he said this thus
[14:54] saith the lord
[14:55] you know
[14:56] that that takes place
[14:58] but see they can't figure it out because
[15:00] they get over into revelations 10 and
[15:02] and how is that and then revelations 18
[15:05] 4 come out of her my people
[15:07] but they don't see what i've tried to
[15:09] bring to you
[15:10] that there's a compound meaning
[15:12] and a compound revelation of scriptures
[15:15] all right it doesn't put us over in this
[15:19] time frame that we have been talking
[15:21] about right
[15:23] just because it is talking about us
[15:26] it doesn't put us in genesis
[15:30] in the garden
[15:31] to read about genesis in the garden and
[15:34] see that all organized religions etc and
[15:37] all of our downfall and things like that
[15:39] come from the garden
[15:42] see it doesn't put us back there
[15:45] all right well why do we want to get
[15:46] over here and say yeah but that can't be
[15:48] so people will try to juggle the books
[15:50] as we call it and say that revelations
[15:53] not in order
[15:54] you got to turn it this way and turn it
[15:56] that way and move this scripture over
[15:58] here now no you don't have to move
[16:00] anything the prophet said the ends and
[16:01] the butts is in the right place what we
[16:03] need is a revelation
[16:06] to see the word of god is perfect amen
[16:09] and we don't have to to do anything we
[16:11] don't have to try to
[16:12] prop it up or try to do anything we just
[16:15] see
[16:16] that you know
[16:18] revelations 10 7
[16:20] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[16:22] angel we begin to say all of this should
[16:23] be revealed okay that's revelation 3 14
[16:26] right right that's where it takes place
[16:29] okay so we get the message then israel
[16:32] gets this message
[16:34] see if you didn't have that way of
[16:35] pharmacy in it you wouldn't have
[16:37] anything to take to them
[16:40] you would have to go back and pick up
[16:41] brother branham and send him over to
[16:43] israel if you didn't
[16:45] take it in the correct order but we know
[16:48] that that way then where it says here
[16:50] come out of her my people
[16:53] well that's compound that means
[16:56] do you and i right
[16:59] come out of her mind
[17:02] but the main element or the main point
[17:04] or the main time frame
[17:07] is
[17:08] to israel
[17:09] in the tribulation and i've kept saying
[17:11] it over and over
[17:13] because i want you to see it that you
[17:15] know and i hope you're beginning to be
[17:16] able now to read the bible the book of
[17:18] revelations with better understanding
[17:20] from your own self you know to just
[17:22] follow and read it
[17:24] and look at these things
[17:25] but seeing that these things see are
[17:28] past us
[17:31] but yet we see what's going to take
[17:33] place
[17:34] and then we come from that that's going
[17:37] to take place to israel in the three and
[17:39] a half year tribulation period that is
[17:42] ascended from revelation 4 1 to
[17:45] revelations 19 is only a three and a
[17:47] half year period
[17:49] of the jacob's trouble called the
[17:50] tribulation
[17:52] and all of these scriptures that we've
[17:53] read and all the time we spent trying to
[17:56] understand takes place in that time
[17:58] frame
[18:00] well i mean to me that's wonderful
[18:03] because that way i know that if i go up
[18:05] in 4-1 i miss the tribulation
[18:07] i miss all of these things and i won't
[18:10] get over to it as much but i want you to
[18:12] read the 18th chapter
[18:14] especially real carefully and just see
[18:18] and that's why i emphasize verse 6 and 7
[18:21] to see what is going to happen
[18:23] to this mystery babylon
[18:28] and the harlot daughters
[18:30] now remember we are not against
[18:34] people all right amen that's right no
[18:37] we're not against people
[18:39] i mean that's our brothers and our
[18:40] sisters their mamas our daddies our kin
[18:42] folks or whatever we're not against
[18:44] those times
[18:45] right what we're against is the system
[18:48] that ties everybody to that one thing
[18:51] and holds it and doesn't let you go on
[18:53] with god
[18:55] that's the thing we're against not the
[18:57] people they're people just like me and
[18:58] you
[19:01] but thank god that god chose you and i
[19:03] yeah that's right it's what we should be
[19:05] doing right but that don't make us look
[19:07] down you remember when we were covered
[19:09] how the 144 000 would be servants to the
[19:12] bride
[19:13] that we didn't cover it as them being
[19:15] slaves and them being our cooks and the
[19:18] washing the dishes and the ironing and
[19:20] we're laying back fat at you know
[19:24] because remember that's going to be in
[19:26] heaven i mean in the millennium right
[19:28] and it won't be in our ways you know i
[19:31] want you to i keep trying to emphasize
[19:35] things
[19:36] so that you'll remember it and then that
[19:39] way you'll see that it has to have a
[19:41] compound meaning to it because look at
[19:43] verse four
[19:45] and i heard another voice
[19:47] from heaven
[19:49] right
[19:53] saying come out of her my people right
[19:56] well right now if the voice is from
[19:59] heaven
[20:01] all right
[20:02] see then you've got to have a way for it
[20:03] to be done on earth so then you can
[20:06] easily see that
[20:09] the message of the hours must call us
[20:11] out amen
[20:12] right
[20:14] but then this message and carry it to
[20:16] israel all of that'll be on earth but
[20:20] that's why it says it didn't say that
[20:22] one half but one voice happened over
[20:23] here and the next voice happens over
[20:25] here
[20:28] it discovers the voice of god all right
[20:30] amen
[20:31] but then it'll say from heaven
[20:34] well
[20:35] put it where it's supposed to be amen
[20:37] then you can see that on earth remember
[20:39] we went through the the uh the three
[20:42] angels that went across in the
[20:43] everlasting gospel
[20:46] we see the everlasting gospel with
[20:48] justification preached by martin luther
[20:50] wasn't
[20:51] but go back and read that those angels
[20:54] sound from heaven
[20:58] then they transpire on earth amen
[21:01] the point i've been trying to get you
[21:03] and i to see and remember now the bible
[21:09] we believe it it's ordained of god don't
[21:11] we
[21:13] see then this is god's way
[21:16] of describing
[21:18] these signs
[21:20] it's not my ideas or your ideas
[21:23] of describing the mystery babylonian on
[21:26] we know who that is the romans and the
[21:28] catholic church coming down in the
[21:30] harlot daughters we know that's
[21:31] organized religion
[21:32] and you know how i bring it right on
[21:34] down to
[21:35] lula heights and branhamites
[21:38] i don't stop
[21:40] i bring it right on down to your ideas
[21:42] and my ideas that are contrary to the
[21:44] word of god right all right see because
[21:46] that's organized religion you be an
[21:48] organization be one person right
[21:51] now i mean you don't have to have nobody
[21:52] to join we to be an organization
[21:56] see when you organize something against
[21:58] the word of god
[22:01] did eve need any help bringing us all
[22:03] down
[22:05] right now she organized it amen
[22:09] and that brought this this is what god
[22:12] is saying about this
[22:13] so it's not you and i saying this
[22:18] why because we know they're people we
[22:19] know the human right but god is looking
[22:21] at it from the other side
[22:25] he's looking at it like
[22:26] we look at saying uh wait a little
[22:28] longer you know your jesus still we get
[22:31] our families in
[22:32] well he knows whether they're coming in
[22:34] or not
[22:36] so the prophet said
[22:37] good song there ain't no scripture to it
[22:39] harley all right
[22:41] a new name written in heaven his mind is
[22:43] mighty said good song but said no
[22:45] scripture
[22:48] see because god knows
[22:51] what it's going to be
[22:53] but now we can believe
[22:56] for our families
[22:58] and you know god knows whether or not
[22:59] you're going to play far right
[23:01] did not the prophet say it like this he
[23:03] said
[23:04] if you can't believe for your family
[23:06] i doubt you believing for yourself
[23:11] he said well i just can't see my kids i
[23:13] just can't see them coming in i can't
[23:14] see my family well what are you doing in
[23:17] front of them
[23:18] that's right
[23:19] come on
[23:20] bro do they want what you have that's
[23:24] right man
[23:27] come on
[23:29] do they want what you have and what you
[23:31] lived before right
[23:34] right
[23:36] that might be one of your kids is not
[23:38] here
[23:40] right no does that hurt feelings
[23:43] well brother dale you just see this one
[23:45] of the lucky ones well thank god for
[23:47] being lucky that's right
[24:00] right but you see what i'm getting at
[24:03] that's why i've told you many times
[24:05] maybe some of you need to go to your
[24:06] kids
[24:08] and apologize to them
[24:11] for the way you've lived before them to
[24:14] try to try to describe jesus christ
[24:18] i don't like you talking like that to me
[24:20] well great
[24:22] go do something about it and i won't be
[24:24] talking about you
[24:26] right that's right
[24:28] but you understand what i'm saying
[24:31] see what i want us to do today to finish
[24:33] this stuff about looking at this and and
[24:35] mainly finishing in the 18th chapter not
[24:38] every verse but just finish up a point
[24:41] that
[24:43] this is what's going to happen
[24:46] to the people
[24:49] who reject this word
[24:51] and not just reject this message
[24:54] that's great
[24:56] but see
[24:58] if you turn down jesus christ in
[24:59] whatever form he's preached right
[25:04] wouldn't it even paul that said it or
[25:06] one of them there that said
[25:07] if even if christ is preached by
[25:09] contention
[25:11] you know in other words a couple of guys
[25:12] out there arguing
[25:16] he said i praise god for it
[25:18] because might give somebody an
[25:20] opportunity here that they'll never hear
[25:22] right
[25:23] that don't justify arguing
[25:27] no i'll just say it if it happens that
[25:29] way god will get to glory
[25:32] amen
[25:34] see then we have it in the correct order
[25:36] of what to do but now think about it
[25:39] we found out in chapter 17 that this
[25:42] mystery babbling
[25:45] according to verse
[25:46] 16 and 17 in there
[25:48] that
[25:50] it was so beautiful
[25:52] until john admired it
[25:56] remember wednesday john admired this
[25:58] right
[25:59] you look out there today as i said
[26:00] wednesday night you look out there today
[26:02] and you see beautiful
[26:04] great big
[26:06] cathedrals great big
[26:08] churches
[26:10] and things and they're doing marvelous
[26:12] work
[26:14] they're feeding a lot of the poor
[26:16] they're they're they're you know sending
[26:18] money to
[26:20] before build orphanages and et cetera
[26:22] all around the world
[26:27] and john with the baptism of the holy
[26:29] ghost now
[26:30] for over 40 years
[26:33] and yet when he sees it as it's laid out
[26:35] before him
[26:37] he doesn't see the
[26:39] the uh
[26:41] uh
[26:43] bad things of
[26:44] the
[26:46] preachers and the priests and the people
[26:48] with their adulterous acts and
[26:50] and stuff like that
[26:54] he doesn't see it that way
[26:57] he sees it as a beautiful situation
[27:00] and he admired it
[27:04] well it ain't deceived me well just
[27:06] remember you was deceived until you
[27:08] heard this message go forget it
[27:11] you know don't be so big
[27:13] no books just you know we're going to be
[27:15] something let's just be what we are
[27:17] i cured a baptist bible and try to
[27:19] convert it to a baptist faith what
[27:20] church was you in
[27:23] i believe we had it
[27:26] but i'd argue with them about what they
[27:28] said we had
[27:30] i'm getting trouble then just like i do
[27:31] now i used to tell them in the dickens
[27:33] meeting i said come find out the bible
[27:35] says we're supposed to wait on tables
[27:36] and you're telling me we're supposed to
[27:38] set the preacher down if he goes off the
[27:39] word because that's what they told him
[27:42] i said where's it in the bible
[27:44] all i know is wait on tables
[27:53] but listen church isn't it time to be
[27:55] playing
[27:58] but the prophet said when they said we
[28:00] talked enough about that
[28:02] you know talk about the antichrist and
[28:04] the thing all right i want to end this
[28:05] this morning we could spend weeks and
[28:07] months and years taking each of these
[28:09] verses
[28:10] and stay on these things
[28:12] but i wanted to get over into the bride
[28:16] we're seven
[28:17] his wife has made herself ready
[28:20] we'll try to get over this afternoon
[28:21] because that's what i want to go on with
[28:25] but i realized one thing
[28:28] now i want you to listen
[28:31] and we'll come back to it this evening
[28:36] the double compound meaning of us seeing
[28:38] these things
[28:40] right
[28:42] not being physically over here
[28:45] because this is way on down the road
[28:47] but seeing where this is leading up to
[28:49] this
[28:51] what do you think it means
[28:54] that she's made herself ready
[28:56] right amen
[29:03] there's two ways and we'll try to cover
[29:05] this evening i just want to hit it let
[29:07] you think
[29:10] she's made herself ready
[29:13] we read to the armored meat packing
[29:16] boy you know going out to get him a wife
[29:18] and a little worse girl and
[29:22] you hear people they preach it
[29:26] and they preach it totally that she's
[29:28] out there slaving taking her pennies to
[29:31] buy her dresses and things
[29:35] but what about what brethren said
[29:37] she took the money
[29:40] he sent her
[29:43] you don't hear that
[29:45] see that's where i've got to keep it
[29:46] balanced
[29:49] you can go off either way and say he
[29:51] supplied everything
[29:56] more you can back that up with scripture
[29:58] or you can go over and say now he he
[30:00] actually she's having to do all this
[30:01] work what won't you do like run around
[30:03] with him
[30:05] let her spend her penis but let her let
[30:06] him send her some money
[30:08] that's what he says
[30:10] well i never heard him when we get to it
[30:12] this evening
[30:14] but listen church
[30:16] what do you think i'm trying to build up
[30:18] to
[30:20] you realize this that we've been in the
[30:23] grinding from chapter 4 up to
[30:27] now in the 18th chapter
[30:30] is pointing to the place
[30:33] that all of this is what brings about
[30:36] the
[30:38] making herself ready
[30:42] and the last part we come through here
[30:44] is what
[30:45] come out of her my people
[30:51] should we take that this evening see
[30:53] then we'll try to lift up
[30:56] but see you think this has been a dumb a
[30:58] humdrum
[31:00] time of not learning
[31:04] all of this is a system that started
[31:06] somewhere
[31:08] that's what i've been trying to get to
[31:10] all of these is a system of people a
[31:12] group of doings and all a religious
[31:15] matter
[31:17] if you and i don't overcome don't worry
[31:19] about the 19th chapter it ain't going to
[31:20] be there
[31:24] you ain't going to be riding back
[31:25] victorious with him all right man
[31:29] do you
[31:30] if we don't get this right
[31:33] if we don't see what the system is
[31:39] and love the people
[31:41] why can't you right
[31:43] more than people expect i wouldn't guard
[31:45] in the door with a non-national church i
[31:46] might get a bad spirit
[31:50] yeah you might rub off some on them
[31:54] oh i need a face in the mirror on that
[31:56] one
[31:57] you might take some bad ones down to
[31:59] them
[32:00] all right
[32:03] i can see that
[32:06] but you see church and all of this that
[32:07] i'm aiming is aiming to come down to
[32:10] i tell you i try to
[32:12] wrote around one day i heard him sit
[32:14] like this and i thought what's he doing
[32:16] he said i got a scripture in mind
[32:19] and he just preached and preached and
[32:21] preached and preached to priests you
[32:23] know
[32:24] we you never he never did reading said
[32:26] that's the scripture i had in mind you
[32:28] know like that right
[32:30] well that's what i thought he would do
[32:31] after a while he'd give me the drive
[32:32] that scripture i could read
[32:34] but then while he'd say
[32:36] i i've got a scripture in mind or i got
[32:38] another scripture in mind
[32:40] but see he was going through the word of
[32:42] god verse by verse i come to realize
[32:45] that
[32:48] if he'd have something in mind
[32:51] well how many services ago did we start
[32:53] in revelations
[32:55] 4-1-5 especially chapter 6 you know
[32:58] 20 sermons ago or something
[33:01] 40 hours of messages
[33:04] pointing to this afternoon
[33:07] to preach come out of here my people and
[33:10] show how to be the bride has made
[33:12] herself ready
[33:13] because if we haven't made ourselves
[33:15] ready
[33:16] it's not coming out of him or her
[33:19] neither one
[33:22] we're tied up with our organized
[33:23] religion
[33:26] and see the prophet warned us about
[33:28] being sympathetic
[33:30] he said you can be sympathetic and he
[33:32] said you become spirits
[33:34] right
[33:37] i'll try to tell you it don't bother me
[33:41] um
[33:43] buddy of zacks
[33:44] you know about a year or so ago he he
[33:46] preached his first sermon in the baptist
[33:48] church where we came from there there in
[33:50] gilbertson georgia so we had plenty of
[33:53] time in the afternoon when we left here
[33:54] you know where we went that night the
[33:56] whole family
[33:58] oh that was a shock
[34:01] look out there here comes the whole dale
[34:02] family
[34:04] all of us now
[34:06] just walking in you know
[34:09] sit down listen the boy preach
[34:14] just remember
[34:16] you're not going to get a spirit right
[34:22] is that clear
[34:27] you say
[34:29] brother brown didn't like cats he didn't
[34:31] say he's obscured him
[34:36] he just said he didn't like him
[34:38] you know what i don't like cats in that
[34:40] way either because they're sneaky
[34:44] right
[34:45] they'll lay in one place for an hour
[34:46] waiting on a mouse to move
[34:48] for a bird
[34:49] they're sneaking
[34:51] you know what i see
[34:53] i pick that spirit up from people
[34:56] especially preachers
[34:58] that are sneaky
[35:01] yeah
[35:02] they're just sneaking around you know
[35:05] no wonder they don't like cats it's
[35:06] their spirit
[35:11] i wish you'd figure mine out because i
[35:12] don't even know what it is
[35:14] well there was a dog or a cat or a horse
[35:16] or a donkey or
[35:18] whatever it would be i don't haven't
[35:19] figured out what i am yet even myself no
[35:22] but listen church he's just trying to
[35:24] get you to see something
[35:28] it does no good to talk about the bride
[35:29] has made herself ready
[35:32] you know the wife right
[35:35] until
[35:36] we see all about it
[35:39] and see how that's done
[35:42] that's what i've been preaching for 20
[35:44] sermons through here
[35:47] to be able to preach one sermon
[35:55] so you don't know how to overcome what
[35:58] until you learn what you need to
[35:59] overcome
[36:00] right
[36:05] that's all i mean
[36:07] but you see what i'm talking about john
[36:09] admired this
[36:11] when he saw this end time church system
[36:15] of all of its beauty and its works
[36:18] and its things that it was that it's
[36:20] doing now that are wonderful feeding the
[36:22] hungry doing those things
[36:25] hospitals owned by churches that if you
[36:28] can't afford they will let you go
[36:30] there you know and things like that
[36:33] people giving their whole lives
[36:40] dedicating their lives to the church in
[36:41] the work of the church
[36:46] and then you say well brother adam
[36:48] shouldn't be so hard
[36:52] he's not hard he's looking at it
[36:53] straight
[36:56] you want how many quotes do you want
[36:57] were they it was the catholic no i
[37:00] believe them right now
[37:01] when they started to build onto the
[37:03] tabernacle to fix it
[37:05] the catholics what was what that
[37:08] they said you can't i'm paraphrasing and
[37:10] said you can't do that because you ain't
[37:12] got enough parking space
[37:16] said that catholic priest or whatever he
[37:18] was one of them told him said you let
[37:20] this baptist or whatever it is over here
[37:22] bill
[37:23] said now what's wrong with them bill
[37:25] if i get the names wrong you put it in
[37:27] the right place because it happened
[37:28] that's right i'll be glad to find it for
[37:30] you
[37:33] he said these cross backs
[37:39] i'll tell you one is that's hard to
[37:41] understand
[37:43] it took a long time for me to realize
[37:45] what he's saying
[37:47] about 1962 somewhere in there i'll find
[37:50] it for you he said the baptist has just
[37:52] now become a denomination
[37:58] over 100 years old probably
[38:02] right right
[38:04] now that's what he's saying
[38:06] you realize that he would say then that
[38:09] the denominations was a carrier sure
[38:14] oh that's right that's what he said
[38:16] nothing garbage can didn't create me
[38:18] bless god well you ain't got anywhere
[38:20] yet anyway
[38:22] somebody had to carry you that's right
[38:27] you see that's why brother branham was
[38:28] welcomed
[38:30] but the doctrine he preached the message
[38:32] he preached was not welcome right
[38:36] that's what i'm trying to get us to see
[38:38] these things here
[38:41] you take these things you can preach for
[38:43] years on
[38:46] these things
[38:48] to lay it down in our lives
[38:53] to see that we're not
[38:56] blessed
[38:58] i won't even dare turn my head and look
[39:00] that way
[39:05] how are you going to win
[39:14] but i'm not going down fellowship in
[39:15] them churches will
[39:18] kind of remember your prophet preaching
[39:20] number one
[39:26] about an opportunity today to go to this
[39:28] brother here's an invite but he's never
[39:29] said any more about it they never said
[39:31] any more battleground and preached for
[39:32] it
[39:34] there's no problem
[39:37] and i wouldn't go over and scream and
[39:38] holler and connect the whole church and
[39:40] knock them all down and go to hell
[39:43] we was listening the other day the
[39:44] prophet said where he said in the old
[39:46] days he said in his discernment he would
[39:48] just call out things you ever heard him
[39:50] say this
[39:53] and he said one day i called out a
[39:55] preacher
[39:57] that was a large congregation
[40:01] he said because i openly called him out
[40:03] said he lost over half his church
[40:05] he said i hated that he said i won't do
[40:08] it again
[40:13] you see
[40:16] but what are we right
[40:18] oh yeah
[40:19] we don't want to get tired of organized
[40:20] religion come find out we got it that's
[40:22] the purpose of me trying to read all of
[40:24] these things and to give us you and i to
[40:26] look at it
[40:28] right
[40:29] let's drop back now up into wednesday
[40:32] night because i i didn't finish the
[40:33] message most of you would know if he
[40:34] even got the notes she surely knew it
[40:37] let's drop back and just cover what he
[40:38] was talking about
[40:40] in chapter 17 then we'll take a little
[40:42] bit in chapter 18. try to finish it up i
[40:44] may read just a few of these quotes to
[40:45] get to talk
[40:47] but it called her mystery babbling but
[40:49] in verse 3 it says and so he carried me
[40:52] away into the spirit
[40:53] and took in the spirit into the
[40:55] wilderness and i saw a woman set up on a
[40:57] scarlet
[40:58] colored beast
[41:00] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[41:03] heads and ten horns
[41:07] names of blasphemies
[41:10] he said i looked that up
[41:12] in the original diagonal
[41:16] and it said it doesn't say names of
[41:18] blaspheming
[41:20] said it says blasphemous names
[41:23] he said now there's a lot of difference
[41:25] between
[41:27] black famous names and names of
[41:29] blessings
[41:30] yes well that's just too early to swap
[41:32] them where they land
[41:33] no
[41:35] see names of blaspheming
[41:38] can actually be vulgar words you use
[41:41] you know
[41:43] people blaspheme god
[41:45] by their words
[41:47] huh
[41:49] because that's what you're doing that's
[41:50] just names of blessings that just means
[41:52] there's something there that you use to
[41:54] speak wrongly
[41:58] but when you say blasphemous names
[42:02] that means
[42:03] not just saying the wrong word or the
[42:05] wrong act it means that's blasphemous
[42:08] there's names that are blaspheming god
[42:11] by being those names
[42:13] do you understand him yes i
[42:24] that's why you don't see in this message
[42:26] where it would say
[42:29] is written over a building
[42:38] well because we're not we're set to work
[42:42] with paul harvey that said that the
[42:44] believers of this message wasn't an
[42:45] organization because they didn't follow
[42:47] the leader
[42:49] with a cult because they didn't follow
[42:51] the leader
[42:52] and do what he said
[42:54] that's a pretty good statement about him
[42:56] right
[42:58] you know how dirty that makes us right
[43:01] you know that we could make this a
[43:02] blasphemous name
[43:06] you see what i'm talking about names of
[43:08] black demons is going one way
[43:11] now you just any kind of uh an idea or
[43:14] thought you have but when you say
[43:15] blasphemous names
[43:18] you're narrowing that down to your name
[43:20] now watch as we read it and you're
[43:23] saying that your name is god's name
[43:28] come on
[43:31] come on church open up and think a
[43:33] little bit
[43:35] don't cut me off just think of what i'm
[43:37] saying
[43:42] why does all of the baptists want
[43:43] everybody to be baptist
[43:47] once all the methodists want everybody
[43:49] to be made
[43:52] right why did all the brandomites want
[43:55] everybody to be brown
[43:59] yeah but you shouldn't talk like that
[44:00] about us
[44:04] this is the place you are to be talking
[44:12] you know i don't mean that wrong i just
[44:14] mean there's none of them out there to
[44:15] be that sorry
[44:19] you see church
[44:23] blasphemous names
[44:26] you're saying that you have the way to
[44:28] heaven
[44:30] or else why do you have that name
[44:36] right
[44:36] right
[44:38] right around him i'll give it to you in
[44:39] a while he said
[44:41] the catholic church was the first
[44:42] organization
[44:48] he said and lutherans was the second
[44:55] now like i said while ago
[44:59] you realize that the denominations
[45:01] didn't really get sealed away
[45:03] off from god until this message came
[45:06] right that's right right when they
[45:08] rejected this message
[45:10] they cut off every hope they had that's
[45:13] right amen right
[45:14] as a church as a system of
[45:17] church
[45:18] that's why the prophet said the baptist
[45:20] just become a denomination right
[45:23] what they had finally denominated
[45:25] against god yes
[45:27] no no no well
[45:29] i thought we played the message with god
[45:32] yes amen
[45:35] that's what brother randall said you
[45:37] always make sure you put a comma
[45:40] we believe this this this comma
[45:44] he said anything else that god reveals
[45:51] he said when you put that period on
[45:52] earth you stop it
[45:54] and you won't accept nothing else
[45:57] but you mean there's 969 different
[46:01] denominational systems and that's a very
[46:02] small number 40 years ago
[46:07] in each one claiming to have the way to
[46:09] heaven
[46:13] now brother dale you don't understand
[46:14] that man if people like say it out there
[46:16] they don't have a sign out front we're
[46:18] the only way
[46:20] i know
[46:21] i know they haven't never read them
[46:23] but like was riding down the road one
[46:25] day
[46:26] they said everybody welcome i believe it
[46:29] was amnesty she said
[46:31] daddy does that mean us i said
[46:34] you gotta walk in
[46:37] we wouldn't be welcome to stay
[46:42] he said will you just stand he can't be
[46:43] mouthed yet well that's a good point too
[46:46] because he said go back to your
[46:48] organized religion you want those quotes
[46:50] around told the people to go
[46:52] but then keep on reading to where he
[46:54] said
[46:55] you let your light shine they'll throw
[46:56] you out
[46:58] well i got all of you out of the
[47:00] churches now like me they didn't throw
[47:02] me out and a lot of you will say they
[47:04] didn't throw me out they wanted me to
[47:05] study that's right but they didn't want
[47:07] what you got
[47:14] they wanted you to stay and keep your
[47:16] mouth shut
[47:19] right
[47:22] they didn't throw me out
[47:27] but you see the day i got baptized in
[47:28] the name of the lord jesus christ
[47:31] i would have to know her
[47:35] see all of your denominations don't
[47:37] believe me that way but the baptist says
[47:38] if you get baptized any other way than
[47:39] what we are you're going to be baptized
[47:42] in this church
[47:44] i knew the day i baptized that out of
[47:45] the church
[47:47] no problem i had to leave
[47:49] i wouldn't cause no trouble and i didn't
[47:52] but listen church
[47:55] he says blasphemous names
[47:59] now basically all of these you'll read
[48:00] them out of black finger's name so i'd
[48:02] ask you to bring the book
[48:07] like paragraph 248 we won't go into
[48:09] these because i'm not too short
[48:11] i'm just reviewing that from wednesday
[48:14] paragraph 248 blasphemies
[48:16] he said calling themselves
[48:19] christians
[48:22] do you know of any church anywhere
[48:24] that doesn't proclaim to be christian
[48:31] but now if it's blasphemous names
[48:37] see then when i attack a name on desire
[48:42] no
[48:44] then by putting that name on it i'm
[48:46] saying that's the way to heaven
[48:49] you don't believe that
[48:51] that's right go ask a little bit
[48:55] go find you somebody so you believe you
[48:57] all are the only way to heaven
[48:58] no
[49:00] but we believe this is the closest way
[49:03] right
[49:07] come on let's go talk a little bit and
[49:08] find out that's right
[49:10] claiming to be christians
[49:20] goes on to ordination in 1962
[49:26] he said setting themselves as
[49:28] christians
[49:32] sending themselves
[49:34] right
[49:35] one of my guests organized religion 62.
[49:41] he said
[49:42] bringing together churches
[49:46] then he goes down to paragraph 190 of
[49:48] that same message and he says
[49:52] they're lodges
[49:57] if we believe brother branham was the
[49:58] prophet
[50:00] then he is transmitting to us
[50:04] the things god says about this church
[50:07] amen you believe in jeremiah
[50:12] and i keep emphasizing he didn't beat
[50:13] the deaf people
[50:15] right it was a system
[50:18] for the church
[50:19] right
[50:21] all right but he calls them lodges
[50:25] he goes down the paragraph which we read
[50:27] if you'll keep on reading in your
[50:28] scripture it says the the cage or it
[50:31] does in verse uh two it's the the hold
[50:34] of ever foul spirit
[50:36] in cage of ever unclean and hateful
[50:39] birds
[50:42] brother adam is talking one time and he
[50:44] says
[50:45] eagles he said no
[50:47] no no
[50:51] he said it's the foul birds he said we
[50:54] are the little eaglets
[50:56] amen
[51:02] now i've always told you
[51:06] let's read i don't preach a lot don't go
[51:08] out and condemn organized religion or
[51:10] whatever out there and beat on its head
[51:12] but
[51:13] because i i'm beating on this this year
[51:16] right
[51:17] or anybody else will listen
[51:21] see the church
[51:24] the prophet said
[51:25] he was he called them churches one day
[51:28] and the holy spirit said they're not
[51:29] churches
[51:31] they're lodges that's right
[51:34] you know the old saying birds of a
[51:36] feather what
[51:38] locked together right
[51:40] baptist birds
[51:43] methodist birds
[51:45] presbyterian birds
[51:48] catholic birds randomized birds
[51:52] little birds
[51:54] you don't like me going down that way do
[51:56] you
[51:57] that's where we all start from
[52:00] we're not trying to convert the world
[52:03] i'm not pastoring the world on the
[52:05] internet i'm pastoring a little georgia
[52:07] trying to get it converted
[52:09] get us away from being the cage of every
[52:12] unclean bird
[52:14] the prophet said eagles he said no no no
[52:18] not eagles
[52:25] lodges
[52:26] the holy spirits are down churches
[52:28] they're like that's right
[52:30] the methodist lodge a bad dislodger
[52:36] but you see that's that old mother
[52:38] and the harlot daughters
[52:43] now
[52:44] if you need it i'll be glad i think i've
[52:46] got it in here i might not but
[52:48] brother random says
[52:51] that they admit
[52:54] this revelation 17
[52:57] the mystery
[52:58] babylon said according to the facts of
[53:01] our faith
[53:02] you had the book and you read it he said
[53:04] they admit that's them
[53:08] the catholic church admits that's them
[53:13] now if you need that and i've either got
[53:14] them laying here they'll be in the
[53:15] office either way you want it
[53:18] you want internet if you need that quote
[53:19] call me or just look at your computer
[53:21] and you'll find it
[53:25] but now they admit they were the home of
[53:28] the
[53:32] now who's the harlot daughter
[53:36] the ones with the same doctrine right
[53:39] remember we've been through that over
[53:40] and over
[53:42] the same doctrine
[53:47] amen
[53:52] you see church if we don't see where
[53:54] we're at
[53:55] we can't get anywhere
[53:58] that's right
[53:59] we start from where we're at
[54:05] i've always said this and i wonder how
[54:06] many of you done it have you ever
[54:08] thanked god for bringing you out of an
[54:10] organized religion
[54:13] thank you for bringing it out from the
[54:15] truth amen
[54:18] sure we'd love to see everybody on our
[54:20] shave with her amen
[54:24] but sometimes we got to realize it won't
[54:26] work in a way that's right so you know
[54:28] what we do we get everybody we can
[54:37] cage of all unclean birds he called it
[54:39] in revelation 18.
[54:43] and then the emphasis i'm wanting you to
[54:45] get
[54:47] is that
[54:52] you can't see that you're a cage or in a
[54:54] cage
[54:56] why would it say come out on earth right
[55:02] right
[55:03] come on are you thinking
[55:06] why would it say come out of her if
[55:07] we're already out
[55:11] a blessed god i never was in none of
[55:13] that you're your own denomination
[55:16] that's what your trouble is now
[55:23] if you want to admit where you're at you
[55:25] can't be helped right
[55:28] that's right
[55:30] i said it when i come in this message
[55:33] it wasn't understood then and i don't
[55:35] know where to be understood now but i
[55:36] said god you got me out of that
[55:38] denomination now get that denomination
[55:41] out of me
[55:44] what do you mean you laughed it
[55:48] and brother motor had a good saying you
[55:49] got your coat and hat and changed
[55:51] meeting places
[55:56] i'm in the message bless god
[55:59] well it's a message in you
[56:01] there's a lot of difference in that
[56:02] that's right
[56:06] but you see church
[56:08] if we're going to believe verse 4 has to
[56:11] be calling us out
[56:19] then that means we got to be somewhere
[56:22] to be called out of all right
[56:28] yep and you can see then that
[56:32] all these angels and all these things
[56:34] that have talked to us
[56:38] you remember how we were bringing out
[56:40] that
[56:42] the first one was martin luther with the
[56:45] joshua lived by faith was the
[56:47] everlasting gospel the prophet said in
[56:49] the next was
[56:51] wesley
[56:52] and he said the next was pentecost
[56:56] but then you come on to the measure to
[56:58] the hour
[56:59] and you see
[57:02] this message
[57:04] is telling us to come out of him right
[57:06] was it not the third angel sweeping
[57:08] across
[57:10] that was to tell about the mark of the
[57:11] beast
[57:13] you remember that
[57:15] the mark of the beast
[57:17] which is not a stamp across our forehead
[57:19] or on our hands or somewhere
[57:22] it's in our understanding our
[57:23] intelligence
[57:34] they say if you go down to an insane
[57:36] institution they ask you if you're crazy
[57:38] and you say no no i'm not they said
[57:41] they're gonna hold over there put him in
[57:42] it
[57:43] the other one they say you crazy
[57:46] man i act like it a lot of times i guess
[57:48] i am i said put him over here and hope
[57:50] for that filler
[57:51] you know
[57:52] see because you're not admitting what
[57:53] you are right
[57:56] is that right with the alcoholics
[57:58] anonymous what's the first thing i want
[57:59] you to say i'm an alcoholic
[58:02] right
[58:03] right
[58:05] that's the first step to get started
[58:08] no i'm not an alcoholic i just drank two
[58:10] gallons a day
[58:16] but listen church
[58:19] do you see what i'm talking about i've
[58:20] got the quotes if you want them
[58:25] but then when you get down to about
[58:26] verse 8
[58:30] of the 17th chapter i just want to
[58:32] emphasize this a little bit the beast
[58:33] that thou saw us was and is not and
[58:36] shall ascend out of the bottomless pit
[58:38] now we know who that is right we know
[58:40] that satan coming out of the bottomless
[58:42] pit right
[58:43] but what did he say
[58:45] the prophet of god says there's no
[58:47] foundation you see
[58:50] he said that's the pope
[58:53] i'm quoting from the second seal
[58:54] paragraph 303
[58:56] paragraph 62 the indictment
[59:00] 1963 he says
[59:02] a succession of hopes
[59:05] that's what it means that he that was
[59:07] and he is not sure it was and he is not
[59:10] right
[59:11] was and is not was and is not right
[59:14] he said they believe in apostolic
[59:16] succession
[59:19] you know it's odd that that's in the
[59:21] land
[59:25] amen there's a group of church epic
[59:27] games up there we went up in a
[59:29] fellowship with them a little bit
[59:31] you know one time and that's what they
[59:33] were apostolic succession
[59:38] they believed it was passed down you
[59:39] would go in and you had a meeting and
[59:42] there was no preacher
[59:43] thought there was a pastor over the
[59:44] whole thing but they would all sit there
[59:47] and they'd wait on whoever the spirit
[59:48] came upon
[59:50] to speak that night
[59:52] you know
[59:54] and so he went on
[59:56] i tried to be nice i went up and said i
[59:57] don't they wanted me to come
[59:59] and went upside down and sat on the back
[1:00:01] and they said about three rows for the
[1:00:02] preachers you know i sat down on the
[1:00:04] back
[1:00:06] then the the preacher come up and he
[1:00:07] said
[1:00:08] uh brother dale we want you up on front
[1:00:10] row
[1:00:12] i said the bible says to take the last
[1:00:15] seat
[1:00:17] you know
[1:00:19] and then if you're invited he said i'm
[1:00:20] inviting you to come up the first row
[1:00:23] you know
[1:00:24] and he said how about getting up
[1:00:25] speaking tonight well that wasn't
[1:00:27] according to their succession because i
[1:00:29] was supposed to come in and tell them i
[1:00:30] got to make house you know
[1:00:33] anybody went in and told them they'd let
[1:00:34] me preach
[1:00:36] because that's apostolic succession
[1:00:37] trying to let you know facing things
[1:00:39] down
[1:00:40] but it kind of runs in this message just
[1:00:42] a little bit you know
[1:00:44] what group you in
[1:00:47] you know
[1:00:48] what pope are you following
[1:00:54] remember the folk was a false prophet
[1:00:56] right
[1:00:57] all right
[1:00:58] right around him on the feast of the
[1:01:00] trumpets paragraph 2 13 2 14.
[1:01:03] 1964 feast of the trumpet he said one
[1:01:05] pope dies
[1:01:07] another one descends
[1:01:10] yep
[1:01:12] one pope dies another one is sin
[1:01:16] that's what they do
[1:01:18] we just went up in a different one this
[1:01:19] time when the guy resigned he had no
[1:01:21] sense to step down he said getting old
[1:01:24] what
[1:01:27] i'm married for that
[1:01:31] let's see a succession just one after
[1:01:32] the other
[1:01:34] but what's the difference in that and
[1:01:36] you're voting for the baptist and got
[1:01:38] together not too long ago and then
[1:01:39] elected the president of the baptist
[1:01:41] association
[1:01:44] what's the difference
[1:01:50] no you don't get on down where we're at
[1:01:55] you want me to find you these quotes
[1:01:58] where there's no such thing as electing
[1:02:00] a pastor
[1:02:09] we do it here because
[1:02:12] of the governmental point of us being
[1:02:14] set up as a
[1:02:15] spoken word church incorporation so it's
[1:02:18] the legality of the court of the law we
[1:02:20] have to follow that vote each year
[1:02:22] for a pastor the brotherhood said
[1:02:23] there's no such thing as voting in the
[1:02:25] past
[1:02:26] you didn't vote paul to be the head
[1:02:29] did nobody vote for peter to be his
[1:02:31] spokesman on death pentecost
[1:02:35] right
[1:02:36] but you know they voted for brother
[1:02:37] brown
[1:02:39] and he said they could vote him in route
[1:02:43] but then he turned around and said
[1:02:44] there's no such thing as voting him
[1:02:49] see where would anybody
[1:02:52] get off of this
[1:02:53] that's silly
[1:02:56] we do a lot of things that are silly but
[1:02:57] we have to do for a lot of other things
[1:02:59] but
[1:03:00] where would you let the pastor from what
[1:03:03] is that
[1:03:05] well if we get 75 percent of the votes
[1:03:07] where's any such thing in the bible
[1:03:11] if you vote on me today
[1:03:13] as your pastor other than the legalities
[1:03:15] that we're going on
[1:03:17] the day i call for a vote
[1:03:19] if it's not 100
[1:03:22] i will sit down
[1:03:24] that's right because there'll never be
[1:03:26] well then i guess i'd just sit down
[1:03:29] no problem
[1:03:32] because it would be the holy spirit
[1:03:37] you didn't have a bunch of cardinals
[1:03:39] running out and said i didn't get the
[1:03:41] guy i wanted
[1:03:42] because they
[1:03:53] blasphemous names
[1:03:57] tack anything on there and you got a
[1:03:59] name
[1:04:02] he's blessing you
[1:04:05] you say yeah but they're being
[1:04:06] christians
[1:04:10] he said that's where the problem was
[1:04:13] you want these quotes you're welcome too
[1:04:16] now i want to move on a little bit
[1:04:18] see in the 18th chapter
[1:04:21] it talks again of the mystery babylon
[1:04:25] or babylon you know the grade has fallen
[1:04:28] it's fallen right
[1:04:29] now
[1:04:31] to show you the compound meaning i hope
[1:04:33] you catch what i'm saying
[1:04:35] we are not here when the things happen
[1:04:38] we will read in a minute
[1:04:41] to this mystery babylon
[1:04:45] but you realize when your prophet stood
[1:04:47] out there with the word of god
[1:04:53] do you realize that if you truly
[1:04:55] i'm getting serious about it this is the
[1:04:57] message
[1:04:59] if you truly see the word of god
[1:05:03] you know
[1:05:05] you truly see one true and living god
[1:05:10] i don't mean like everybody else got on
[1:05:12] you know everybody no no i'm saying as
[1:05:13] you see it for your per you've been
[1:05:15] using it
[1:05:16] if you see one true living god you
[1:05:19] realize mr babylon has fallen for you
[1:05:23] this is for this evening so okay that's
[1:05:25] what i said we'll get on some good and
[1:05:26] leave this alone
[1:05:28] this is the point i want you to get
[1:05:30] if you can see
[1:05:33] the system of organized religion is
[1:05:35] wrong and yet still love the people and
[1:05:37] still fellowship with them and no
[1:05:39] problems you know and stuff
[1:05:43] if you can do that see then mystery
[1:05:44] babylon has fallen for you
[1:05:48] you're not the cage of ever unclean bird
[1:05:53] you're the body of jesus christ
[1:05:59] and i like what either rabbi richmond or
[1:06:01] gerson solomon one time said he said i
[1:06:05] can't have it god chose us
[1:06:08] now what good thing did you do that god
[1:06:10] chose you
[1:06:12] you know
[1:06:14] i could think of a lot of bad things
[1:06:16] that
[1:06:17] looked like he ought to throw me away
[1:06:19] don't you
[1:06:21] but yet he chose me
[1:06:24] at least to see the message
[1:06:27] amen that's right
[1:06:29] and after realizing put in there that
[1:06:31] many are called but what
[1:06:33] you were trying to man
[1:06:36] there's many calls of this message but
[1:06:37] there's only a few chosen to be the
[1:06:39] bride of christ
[1:06:44] and see in the end time as we'll get to
[1:06:46] it this evening if we don't prove
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:50] that's it
[1:06:53] not to one another right right
[1:06:55] i know this is gonna hurt hard
[1:06:58] and you're gonna say it's wrong but go
[1:06:59] ahead
[1:07:01] we got to prove to god
[1:07:06] that we're his wife
[1:07:08] right there or we're not going to be his
[1:07:10] wife right
[1:07:12] we can joy jump and run around and be as
[1:07:13] bright right right
[1:07:16] claim to be christians
[1:07:18] right
[1:07:23] no difference between a bride and a wife
[1:07:28] you know even scofield says that
[1:07:30] right the
[1:07:31] adulterous israel
[1:07:34] that was put away can never come back
[1:07:36] to be
[1:07:39] his wife
[1:07:40] scofield says that
[1:07:43] he had enough knowledge he said because
[1:07:45] you can't be an adulterous system and
[1:07:47] come back to be pure
[1:07:50] correct
[1:07:53] all right
[1:07:56] so then
[1:07:58] we must come out yes
[1:08:02] to go in too that's right right
[1:08:07] we can be called out of the church
[1:08:08] system
[1:08:11] we can be called out of the messiness
[1:08:13] the baptist the presbyterians or
[1:08:15] whatever
[1:08:17] and set down to be this denomination
[1:08:19] just as denominational as we was while
[1:08:22] we there was there
[1:08:23] that's right amen
[1:08:26] the prophet said
[1:08:27] any idea
[1:08:31] that is contrary
[1:08:33] to god's revealed word amen
[1:08:48] but you see 18 4 now
[1:08:51] if you're following me
[1:08:53] 18 4
[1:08:56] is a foundation
[1:08:59] or a proof
[1:09:03] that somebody has made yourself ready
[1:09:06] right
[1:09:09] chapter 19 as we'll get to it this
[1:09:10] evening
[1:09:13] if it says she's made her separated it
[1:09:15] don't go through any other things
[1:09:18] this is the going through the
[1:09:20] the things i'm getting ready
[1:09:24] to come out of her
[1:09:30] what about
[1:09:34] and we actually come out
[1:09:37] dirty we get our coat and hat and leave
[1:09:41] that's why you see a lot of
[1:09:43] jumping around and the people call the
[1:09:45] message people
[1:09:49] they'll come out
[1:09:51] until somebody says something they don't
[1:09:53] like
[1:09:55] right
[1:10:00] and when they do they'll walk out
[1:10:04] why
[1:10:06] bless god you ain't gonna tell me
[1:10:09] i'm the right crop
[1:10:16] okay
[1:10:20] but see
[1:10:22] if we can come away from ourselves
[1:10:25] we got them no notice no quotes
[1:10:28] we've come away from ourselves
[1:10:32] and get to saying the word is right let
[1:10:34] me follow that
[1:10:36] that's right
[1:10:38] and then we gotta settle this part of it
[1:10:40] too because you know everybody says they
[1:10:43] got to work
[1:10:44] right
[1:10:45] right
[1:10:46] that was the point one of those the bad
[1:10:48] just like they've got to mess with this
[1:10:49] thing they've got pressure
[1:10:51] or they wouldn't be that church the
[1:10:52] brand of mice think they had it right

[1:12:16] have we come out of him
[1:12:21] have we come out of her
[1:12:26] are we ready for a raptured ride
[1:12:29] because remember we got to go up before
[1:12:31] we can come down in revelation 19.
[1:12:36] and just remember in revelations 19
[1:12:39] that's going to be all the bribe
[1:12:41] right
[1:12:44] that's going to be luther that taught a
[1:12:46] trinity right amen that's right man
[1:12:49] that's good brother that's right that's
[1:12:50] gonna be wesley that taught wrong
[1:12:52] doctrine right right amen
[1:12:56] that's gonna be the pentecostals with
[1:12:58] all they're doing
[1:13:00] are you gonna leave them out of 19
[1:13:02] riding back
[1:13:06] but you see it
[1:13:09] if we don't tie in
[1:13:12] it doesn't say that luther and wesley
[1:13:15] and them
[1:13:16] have made their self ready right right
[1:13:19] it don't say the bride that's made
[1:13:21] herself right that's right because they
[1:13:23] are the bride
[1:13:24] that's right it says the why amen
[1:13:28] you know the one that's living right
[1:13:34] those are alive
[1:13:37] it's the one that's made ourselves ready
[1:13:38] right
[1:13:39] we've come through all of these things
[1:13:42] we've learned them out and seen they
[1:13:44] were wrong
[1:13:46] but come out of the right attitude
[1:13:49] not looking down on nobody i look down
[1:13:52] on people that don't want what i've got
[1:13:54] you know what i do i look down in tears
[1:13:56] i don't look down in anger
[1:13:58] i look down in tears because amen that's
[1:14:02] right
[1:14:02] for one thing i realized
[1:14:05] lord
[1:14:06] if i've got anything you gave it to me
[1:14:10] amen amen thank you jesus
[1:14:13] i didn't get it myself and study it out
[1:14:14] you gave it to me
[1:14:16] and i looked down at it and i said lord
[1:14:19] could you bring them yes up a little bit
[1:14:21] and wonderful people
[1:14:24] i don't look down on no organized
[1:14:26] religion or the people that's measured
[1:14:27] or anything no
[1:14:31] look down
[1:14:33] i pray all the time it's the lord that's
[1:14:34] my brothers and sisters
[1:14:36] i'm talking about natural and spiritual
[1:14:38] you know and they said i count them down
[1:14:40] right because like i've always said to
[1:14:42] you you're over there
[1:14:44] ridiculing somebody that walks by with
[1:14:47] him and that
[1:14:49] calling back you know you just get me in
[1:14:50] trouble all the time
[1:14:51] because we just come in the message
[1:14:54] and
[1:14:55] you know and they were just hearing
[1:14:58] dress and clothes and hiring shoes and
[1:15:01] you know that and
[1:15:04] we'd be in the store and they'd say
[1:15:07] yeah
[1:15:08] look at that over there with that short
[1:15:10] dress
[1:15:12] look at her look at her face being
[1:15:13] painted
[1:15:14] shut up boys
[1:15:19] see that's all they heard
[1:15:21] so that's talking about what to say okay
[1:15:25] but listen church
[1:15:27] if we're not above the dress and the
[1:15:29] clothes and things then we're not even
[1:15:30] christians that's right that's right
[1:15:32] we're not even bright
[1:15:35] right you want to get into martin luther
[1:15:37] and john wesley in their lives
[1:15:42] that's right when john wesley said it
[1:15:44] was he didn't have any calls for
[1:15:46] drinking black coffee he said cause it
[1:15:48] has no
[1:15:50] value it wasn't smith wigglesworth and
[1:15:53] one of them wouldn't even one wouldn't
[1:15:54] read a newspaper raised 17 people from
[1:15:56] the dead
[1:15:58] no one even read a newspaper
[1:16:01] don't get into lies and talk about it
[1:16:04] yeah but we're standing on people that
[1:16:07] live holy lives
[1:16:12] but like i'm saying
[1:16:15] revelation 19 is going to be the ride of
[1:16:17] luther wesley pentecost just as well as
[1:16:20] you and i right
[1:16:21] right but it's going to start off
[1:16:23] because in 19 they're about four or five
[1:16:25] or everyone goes down eight or something
[1:16:27] we'll get to it this scene says that
[1:16:28] lebron
[1:16:29] the wife
[1:16:31] has made herself
[1:16:33] if we don't get ready to go luther and
[1:16:35] them can't be raised that's right they
[1:16:37] without us that's right cannot be made
[1:16:39] perfect i believe that's right they
[1:16:41] can't come to a completion of a
[1:16:42] resurrection without you
[1:16:45] that's right
[1:16:47] and what a wonderful opportunity is
[1:16:49] going to be
[1:16:51] you know that everybody is hinged upon
[1:16:53] you and i am right that's right amen
[1:17:00] but think about it
[1:17:03] come out of her
[1:17:10] all right you want to read one more
[1:17:12] i didn't give it to them to read but
[1:17:14] brother joe can you brother anderson can
[1:17:17] you pull up verse
[1:17:18] 23
[1:17:21] yeah
[1:17:22] can you pull up verse 23
[1:17:24] let me talk for a second while they're
[1:17:25] getting there
[1:17:28] you say
[1:17:32] but brother dave you've taught us
[1:17:35] that we go up for one and we're not in
[1:17:37] 19 we're not in 18 and now you look like
[1:17:40] you put us 18.

[1:18:11] watch what it says
[1:18:13] and the light of the candle
[1:18:15] she'll sign no more than all indeed
[1:18:20] that's an organized religion that's the
[1:18:22] oh motherhood that's a hard system
[1:18:24] it don't shine no more all right
[1:18:26] this little light of mine i'm going to
[1:18:28] let it shine but see when we go out of
[1:18:30] here there is no light right right
[1:18:33] right we're not dealing with 144
[1:18:35] thousand
[1:18:36] right we're just dealing with the whole
[1:18:37] thing what
[1:18:39] and the voice of the bridegroom
[1:18:43] what america
[1:18:46] so that's not god's voice in there
[1:18:51] come on you see what i'm trying to lay
[1:18:53] down to get us to a point
[1:18:56] that's not god's voice out there when
[1:18:57] it's time to organize religion
[1:19:00] it's not god's voice in this message if
[1:19:01] you and i have anything contrary to the
[1:19:04] truth
[1:19:05] it's not god's voice
[1:19:07] he doesn't talk with forked tongue
[1:19:12] what says the voice of the bridegroom
[1:19:14] and of the bride
[1:19:16] she'll be heard no more and all indeed
[1:19:23] go in there and read 8 17 18
[1:19:28] and look
[1:19:30] and find out this last part
[1:19:33] that the merchants were great men
[1:19:36] and they stand the way off
[1:19:39] you know because what's going to happen
[1:19:43] let's see if i get this in there
[1:19:50] okay
[1:19:51] go with number four brother joe brother
[1:19:53] anderson let's get number four and five
[1:19:56] and this half this i gave him two sets
[1:19:58] of notes okay

[1:20:01] they got two sets
[1:20:03] go ahead and pull up number
[1:20:05] four
[1:20:06] while it's getting there i'll give it to
[1:20:07] it's the mark of the beast 1954 513 look
[1:20:10] what your prophet says look what's going
[1:20:12] to happen to this system
[1:20:16] and if you give me one more night if god
[1:20:17] does i'll prove to you that communism is
[1:20:20] working straight in the hands of
[1:20:22] almighty god
[1:20:24] right now where we can read the book
[1:20:30] and remember i'll say this is god's
[1:20:32] prophet
[1:20:35] the russian empire will drop an atomic
[1:20:38] bomb
[1:20:39] or
[1:20:40] of some sort
[1:20:43] that's what everybody thinks it is of
[1:20:45] some sort
[1:20:49] on the vatican city
[1:20:52] and destroy it in one hour
[1:20:55] thus saith the lord
[1:20:57] and the bible said that god took them
[1:20:59] cruel hearted men and put them in his
[1:21:02] hands and they were instruments in his
[1:21:03] hands to fulfill his will
[1:21:06] and to bring back to her exactly what
[1:21:08] she had coming to her that's the word
[1:21:11] okay the ten virgins next number five
[1:21:14] priest in 1960 12-11
[1:21:19] the bible said
[1:21:20] that god raised up communism
[1:21:22] to get revenge upon the nations
[1:21:25] for what they've done to the children of
[1:21:28] god
[1:21:30] i want you
[1:21:32] that's exactly right he said
[1:21:34] and they their power and everything
[1:21:37] to the beast for one hour
[1:21:39] into revenge of people of the blood that
[1:21:41] they had shed
[1:21:42] and when that atomic bomb or whatever it
[1:21:45] ears will strike that vatican city
[1:21:47] and the roman hierarchy would be no more
[1:21:50] and he said it was found in her the
[1:21:52] blood of all the martyrs
[1:21:56] says there's a bomb waiting for them
[1:22:02] said they're going to drop it in vatican
[1:22:03] or some way
[1:22:09] you see when this thing all winds up in
[1:22:11] the tribulation
[1:22:13] and the natural nation of israel that is
[1:22:15] in the covenant as i covered a while
[1:22:17] back with the antichrist
[1:22:20] that's right when that
[1:22:22] hope whoever he is walks into the temple
[1:22:25] of god showing himself to be as god
[1:22:26] stands there and proclaims who he is
[1:22:29] natural israel is going to reveal
[1:22:32] they're going to see they're wrong 144
[1:22:34] 000 never was in the covenant
[1:22:36] they're killed by the natural israelites
[1:22:38] right right
[1:22:40] they're killed by that they're two
[1:22:41] witness under 44
[1:22:43] and they wind up
[1:22:45] realizing something went wrong
[1:22:48] and they're going to start raining down
[1:22:52] and when they do russia's gonna start
[1:22:54] raining them down
[1:22:55] we gonna start raining them down and
[1:22:57] everybody's gonna start raining them
[1:22:59] down what's left
[1:23:01] cause that's the battle of armageddon
[1:23:06] all right
[1:23:08] and read your bible there where it says
[1:23:09] even the merchants the people around
[1:23:11] them will stand back often no one's
[1:23:13] afraid to move in close because afraid
[1:23:15] they'll get bombed too because where's
[1:23:17] all the bombs gonna be pointing
[1:23:21] down the smoke stack where the white
[1:23:22] smoke went up the other day
[1:23:25] all the bombs is going to point to there
[1:23:29] going to blow that thing to smithereens
[1:23:32] and the bible says even the merchants
[1:23:33] will pull back
[1:23:35] read 18th chapter and it says that they
[1:23:37] will you know what it says that they've
[1:23:40] got gold and precious things
[1:23:42] but they're no longer of any value
[1:23:55] if you had a million dollar gold bar in
[1:23:57] your hand
[1:23:58] and you're hungry
[1:24:07] wouldn't be your problem to flop down
[1:24:09] your million-dollar bar right
[1:24:11] to get you a biscuit right
[1:24:15] the bible says it's of no value anymore
[1:24:17] we didn't teach out right
[1:24:20] but the mind and worst thing could be is
[1:24:22] what's the last the red
[1:24:25] the voice of the bridegroom
[1:24:27] and the voice of the bride is heard no
[1:24:29] longer in here
[1:24:35] even though we get out of here those two
[1:24:37] witnesses
[1:24:39] which is our bridegroom
[1:24:41] we're gonna go over there
[1:24:45] you go in there and teach talk to them
[1:24:48] come on music
[1:24:52] but let's get out of that now get into
[1:24:54] the bride
[1:24:56] but just remember we're back up a little
[1:24:57] this afternoon
[1:24:59] if we haven't overcome all of these
[1:25:01] things that we've read
[1:25:05] then there will be no victorious rides
[1:25:12] into the millennium right
[1:25:15] see we don't get rid of our ideas and
[1:25:16] thoughts
[1:25:23] let me give you a thumb for this
[1:25:25] afternoon
[1:25:29] i ain't gonna write to raise the hands
[1:25:32] but how many of you believe that we're
[1:25:34] already married to jesus christ
[1:25:40] but henry believes it
[1:25:42] by being that we're not going to a
[1:25:44] marriage in the sky
[1:25:46] we're only going to have a wedding
[1:25:47] supper
[1:25:49] right
[1:25:53] that's the biggest portion of the people
[1:25:55] of the message
[1:26:00] but we don't read the bible where it
[1:26:02] says and his wife has made herself ready
[1:26:08] the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:26:11] right
[1:26:14] if we're married to him already why
[1:26:16] their marriage to the lamb
[1:26:20] you see we got it all figured out
[1:26:25] i'm quoting brother brown
[1:26:29] but you see i can quote him all i want
[1:26:31] over here that's right or i can quote
[1:26:32] him all one over here
[1:26:34] but when i bring it together it makes a
[1:26:36] beautiful picture that's right
[1:26:41] we're going to a marriage supper i've
[1:26:43] heard people even go to prove they over
[1:26:45] in israel they the wedding is first and
[1:26:47] then the marriage supper comes
[1:26:50] how many excuse me the
[1:26:52] the
[1:26:53] marriage
[1:26:54] i have
[1:26:55] i'll get to it this happened i got it
[1:26:57] written down
[1:26:58] but
[1:26:59] see everybody thinks that we're just
[1:27:00] going to some work to a marriage supper
[1:27:02] because we're all
[1:27:03] married
[1:27:05] we're getting married here that's a
[1:27:07] quote
[1:27:09] there's going to be a wedding in the sky
[1:27:15] now what are you going to do with it
[1:27:21] you see you can make it say anything you
[1:27:22] want to
[1:27:24] but the truth is the truth
[1:27:26] what have we got anybody have a need for
[1:27:28] six minutes
[1:27:32] put four servers into one today so they
[1:27:34] don't
[1:27:52] heading home
[1:28:02] he's gonna be gone
[1:28:03] we've tried our best
[1:28:05] to get her to stay out here
[1:28:08] and
[1:28:10] force him to come this way
[1:28:23] well
[1:28:24] let's just believe
[1:28:35] we're all gonna miss here
[1:28:43] in the name of jesus christ
[1:28:59] oh
[1:29:11] is
[1:29:39] oh
[1:29:52] foreign
[1:30:31] anybody else here we go
[1:31:14] oh
