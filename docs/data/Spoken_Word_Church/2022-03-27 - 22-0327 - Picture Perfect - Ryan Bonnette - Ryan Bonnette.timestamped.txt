[0:13] okay good morning everybody
[0:15] god bless y'all
[0:26] got a lot of technology to catch up to
[0:28] so
[0:29] taking me a minute here
[0:46] all right this morning i'm going to
[0:47] teach y'all about picture perfect
[0:54] once i get the slides open here
[1:03] all right picture perfect is a phrase
[1:05] that we use commonly in our society and
[1:07] everybody knows what that means
[1:08] basically like a picture like this like
[1:10] i took it one of the chicken farms that
[1:12] i go to just a beautiful picture and
[1:14] it's something we say is picture perfect
[1:16] but what i'm talking about this morning
[1:19] is our revelation
[1:21] forgotten to pray hold on one sec
[1:23] dear heavenly father we pray you just
[1:24] bless the services today we pray bless
[1:26] brother bob ministering here brother
[1:28] wade of their ministry in ohio just give
[1:30] glory to yourself in the service lord
[1:32] and bless again all the spoken requests
[1:33] sister freda specially pray you can
[1:34] continue to manifest your healing in her
[1:36] body all the other requests were
[1:38] mentioned lord and just anoint brother
[1:39] bob and help us to hear and understand
[1:41] as your word comes forth through your
[1:42] servant this morning
[1:43] and we love you and thank you for all
[1:44] your blessings in jesus name amen
[1:48] so i'm going to talk about picture
[1:50] perfect and i'm referring to our
[1:51] revelation and you see i've got a canvas
[1:54] up here does everybody know what a
[1:55] canvas is
[1:56] anybody doesn't this is what a
[1:59] artist will use to paint on it's just
[2:02] like a fabric material stretched over a
[2:03] wooden frame
[2:05] but in our minds the way our minds work
[2:08] there's kind of like this
[2:10] picture a lot of pictures in our minds
[2:12] and we the way we see things the way we
[2:14] perceive things our minds work that way
[2:17] and
[2:18] but what i'm talking about this morning
[2:19] is our revelation because brother bannon
[2:21] said we need revelation more than
[2:23] anything it's so important and what
[2:25] revelation does is it paints this
[2:28] picture on our canvas in our mind it
[2:31] paints us a picture of god of the
[2:33] redemption plan of his all of his
[2:36] program and our part in that
[2:39] so we want our canvas
[2:42] and our mind to match that of god's
[2:46] the difference being mainly of course
[2:48] his is infinite he's going to be always
[2:49] unfolding through the endless ages of
[2:51] eternity and we'll continue to
[2:52] understand more about him his character
[2:54] his ways
[2:55] but even though ours is finite ours
[2:59] kind of has a limit
[3:01] but it still needs to match his we need
[3:05] unadulterated word we need
[3:07] as close we need it to be exact an exact
[3:10] match of the original which is the mind
[3:11] of christ
[3:14] so picture perfect means that phrase
[3:16] means lacking in defects or flaws or it
[3:19] means ideal
[3:22] and one reason i want to talk about this
[3:25] is because when i came to the message in
[3:26] 2002 straight out of the baptist church
[3:29] i had kind of a stumbling block i had
[3:31] never heard of revelation and when i
[3:34] heard people talk about divine spiritual
[3:36] revelation i thought wow that seems
[3:38] really profound and brother brandon
[3:40] talked about how important it is and i
[3:42] thought well i don't know if i'll ever
[3:42] be a candidate for that it's just over
[3:44] my head
[3:45] turns out god reveals himself in
[3:47] simplicity
[3:49] so if you just attach yourself to that
[3:51] by reading the bible and praying every
[3:53] day and seeking god with all of your
[3:54] heart
[3:55] he'll do the revealing you leave that
[3:57] part up to god we're all a candidate for
[3:59] it if we just make ourselves available
[4:01] it's not over your head
[4:05] and revelation has a lot to do with so
[4:07] many things in our life your
[4:10] growth and your the things you do in
[4:12] your natural body
[4:13] you know it um the things that you do
[4:15] like for example eve or we call her the
[4:18] woman before the fall
[4:20] in the garden she got a wrong brush
[4:22] stroke painted on her canvas
[4:25] she came out from behind the
[4:27] fortification of the word and that
[4:29] caused the fall because of that one
[4:31] wrong brush stroke the rest of the
[4:33] picture might have been perfect and ripe
[4:35] because but because of that
[4:36] cow getting in the tree in the grass
[4:40] it messed up everything so the things in
[4:42] your body a lot of times the things we
[4:44] seem like we can't control in our body
[4:46] if we just keep studying the word and
[4:47] seeking god for more revelation
[4:49] sanctification will be going to take
[4:51] place
[4:52] all right
[4:54] from the message who is this
[4:57] in 1959 but yet to know him his eternal
[4:59] life to know him the person christ
[5:01] that's where eternal life lays knowing
[5:03] him personally yourself know his nature
[5:05] what he does is acts and then when you
[5:07] do that you'll have a knowledge of his
[5:08] word and what he wants you to do that's
[5:10] where faith comes from
[5:15] and
[5:16] this is eternal life that they might
[5:18] know thee the only true god and jesus
[5:20] christ whom thou has sent
[5:23] i've got a few scriptures to get out of
[5:24] the way here and then we'll get to i've
[5:26] got a lot to say actually so i'm going
[5:28] to talk really fast colossians 1
[5:30] for this cause we also since the day we
[5:32] heard it do not cease to pray for you
[5:33] and to desire that you might be filled
[5:35] with the knowledge of his will and all
[5:37] wisdom and spiritual understanding
[5:43] colossians 1 further along in that
[5:45] chapter i say whether they be things in
[5:47] earth things in heaven and you who are
[5:49] sometimes alienated enemies in your mind
[5:51] by wicked works yet now hath to be
[5:53] reconciled the body is flesh to the
[5:54] death to present
[5:56] you holy and blame will not approval in
[5:57] his side
[5:58] see we come here with a wrong canvas we
[6:00] come here with a lot of preconceived
[6:02] ideas about god and a lot of things that
[6:04] we need corrected so god does two things
[6:06] he opens up and he expounds on our
[6:08] revelation but then also he's correcting
[6:11] all those errors those flaws on our
[6:12] picture because like i said we want our
[6:14] picture
[6:15] perfect
[6:16] if you continue in the faith ground and
[6:18] settled and be not moved away from the
[6:19] hope of the gospel which you have heard
[6:21] and was preached to every creature which
[6:23] is under heaven wherever i paul made a
[6:24] minister who now rejoiced in my
[6:26] sufferings for you and philip that's
[6:28] behind the affliction of christ
[6:30] in my flesh for his body's sake which is
[6:32] the church
[6:36] okay
[6:38] and wherever i made a minister let's see
[6:40] let's get on down to whom god would make
[6:42] known what is the riches of the glory of
[6:44] his mystery among the gentiles that's us
[6:47] which is christ and you the hope of
[6:48] glory
[6:51] and
[6:52] proverbs 29
[6:54] where there is no vision the people
[6:56] perish
[6:58] but he that keepeth the law happy is he
[7:00] and envision there means prophetic
[7:02] vision or revelation
[7:08] um recently
[7:09] i actually thought of this
[7:11] this uh sunday school lesson back in a
[7:14] couple months ago and have been kind of
[7:17] rolling over my mind since then and
[7:19] since that time it seemed like almost
[7:20] every minister is touching on something
[7:22] that i'm fixing to talk about but
[7:24] but recently brother matthew and brother
[7:26] wade talked about
[7:28] predestination and talked about how much
[7:31] it ties into our
[7:33] free moral agency and i love what
[7:35] brother matthew brought out about how
[7:36] basically i don't remember exactly how
[7:38] he worded it but basically from your
[7:39] birth even from the time you're in the
[7:41] womb the lord is beholding you he's
[7:42] watching you he's watching as you
[7:44] develop and all the while through your
[7:46] life there's this anointing or this
[7:48] position
[7:49] that god is calling you to that's ready
[7:51] for you to receive it once you make the
[7:53] decision it's just following you through
[7:55] your life and when you choose to connect
[7:56] to that
[7:58] by your free moral agency you choose to
[8:00] accept christ as your savior and start
[8:02] following him reading the word every day
[8:04] and saturate yourself in the word of god
[8:07] you're connecting to that you're hearing
[8:08] from your theophany and all these things
[8:11] and it's really a profound thing
[8:14] but it's all tied to your predestin to
[8:16] your free moral agency like brother tom
[8:17] falbo said we trigger our predestination
[8:21] i love that
[8:24] okay
[8:25] if you read the bible and don't see
[8:27] christ in every verse of it go back and
[8:29] read it again if you can't see christ in
[8:31] every verse of the bible then you read
[8:32] it again
[8:34] because you missed something the bible
[8:35] is christ and he is the word
[8:38] and then on down that's i think that
[8:40] same sermon there is no place for
[8:41] denomination no place for creed outside
[8:43] of the bible so when you see these
[8:44] things they'll come
[8:45] into the picture and that's why people
[8:47] has added other things got their jigsaw
[8:49] puzzle all mixed up can't make it come
[8:50] out right the same yesterday today and
[8:52] forever
[8:55] but if the thing is
[8:57] put together right there is the entire
[8:59] picture of the fall regeneration the
[9:00] whole picture of creation and god's
[9:02] whole plan revealed right in jesus
[9:04] christ
[9:06] it's like putting a jigsaw puzzle
[9:08] together he says
[9:10] that's why we got picture today it looks
[9:12] horrible say we're believers in the cow
[9:14] in the top of the tree in the grass it
[9:15] don't work you say the same yesterday
[9:17] today forever all but a certain thing
[9:19] then you ruin your picture
[9:21] so we know
[9:22] in the picture
[9:23] here we have a cow we've got a tree we
[9:26] got some grass
[9:28] got some mountains in the background all
[9:29] that looks good but the position of the
[9:31] cow is wrong
[9:33] the cows up in the tree trying to eat
[9:35] some grass
[9:40] it's no problem if we're wrong the
[9:42] problem is if we stay wrong when the
[9:43] word comes to correct us okay that's
[9:46] where we mess up at it's our attitude
[9:48] toward the word
[9:49] there you got your picture wrong again
[9:50] you got a man fishing out in the desert
[9:52] talking about somebody say uh the works
[9:54] that he did will do also that's for
[9:56] another age that's what people say well
[9:58] anyway he was fishing at galilee getting
[10:00] where he's fishing together there's
[10:01] plenty of fish you see you got to make
[10:03] the picture look right that's god's
[10:04] great picture there we have a man in the
[10:07] desert the desert looks good the man
[10:09] fishing he's got a good fish there that
[10:10] looks all normal it's just the placement
[10:12] of the man in the desert
[10:14] catching the sand fish
[10:16] doesn't make sense so let's suppose that
[10:18] when we first come to christ here we
[10:20] have the initial part of our picture
[10:22] which is right and it's from god and
[10:24] it's basically however you want to think
[10:26] of it it's you
[10:28] it's it's calvary is christ on on the
[10:30] cross he's dying for your sins and for
[10:32] the first time in your life the truth
[10:34] strikes your heart with a conviction and
[10:36] you say wow i'm a sinner and i need
[10:38] salvation you might have heard the word
[10:40] many times growing up here we live in
[10:42] the bible belt
[10:43] we're all around people in church and
[10:45] things and especially if we grew up in
[10:46] church but then at one point in time it
[10:50] convicts your heart and that paints the
[10:52] original the initial part of your
[10:53] picture which is christ's on calvary and
[10:56] you kneeling there for forgiveness of
[10:58] sins
[10:59] and that part never goes away i believe
[11:01] that we'll always remember christ died
[11:03] for our sins we are sinners once and
[11:05] need of salvation
[11:07] so then what happens is he continues to
[11:09] expound on that when you come to
[11:11] sanctification about from the holy
[11:12] spirit and you understand the oneness of
[11:14] the godhead and understand serpent seed
[11:16] all that is going around this central
[11:18] thing which is christ on calvary
[11:21] questions on genesis
[11:23] now
[11:26] yeah
[11:27] what i'm trying to do let's just i'm
[11:28] going to read this quote okay now the
[11:29] next thing we begin to see my eyes are
[11:31] supernatural looking we see a little
[11:33] white light forming out there this is
[11:34] before john 1. before in the beginning
[11:37] was the word and the word was with god
[11:39] and the word was god and the word made
[11:41] flesh dwelt among us brother bran is
[11:42] talking about right before that
[11:44] how did we get from this elohim that god
[11:46] dwelling on his attributes
[11:48] to that john 1. and right in there he's
[11:51] he's kind of painting a picture he's
[11:53] saying let's stand on the banister of
[11:54] heaven you go back and read this
[11:56] and question answers on genesis 1953
[11:58] he's standing there like on the banister
[12:00] looking letting us you know we're just
[12:01] kind of looking over and watching this
[12:03] happen watching something come that we
[12:04] can begin to understand god
[12:07] we see a little white light forming out
[12:08] there and what is that is called by
[12:10] bible readers logos or the anointed or
[12:12] the anointing orders i was going to say
[12:13] the part of god began to develop into
[12:15] something so human beings could have
[12:17] some type of an idea of what it was
[12:20] it's a little like a little light moving
[12:22] that was the word of god so here we are
[12:25] we're watching this unfold
[12:27] and we can't see anything there's no
[12:29] atoms no air to make
[12:30] uh uh no molecules to even make air no
[12:34] space no time no nothing
[12:36] and it's just god dwelling on his
[12:37] attributes and how can we understand
[12:39] that
[12:40] we really can't so he says well i'm
[12:42] going to condescend into a form
[12:45] where i can begin to be understood
[12:48] i'm going to say we see a little white
[12:49] light like a halo
[12:51] i'm just doing my best to illustrate
[12:52] this to paint a picture in your mind
[12:55] logos
[12:57] speech
[12:59] language
[13:00] was born
[13:02] god invented
[13:03] language
[13:04] this process what is language it's where
[13:07] one
[13:08] entity has a thought and can
[13:11] transmit that thought or transfer that
[13:14] thought to another entity
[13:16] god can transmit his thoughts to man or
[13:19] man to man like i say banana
[13:23] and instantly
[13:24] everybody here thinks of a curved yellow
[13:28] and very tasty fruit
[13:29] and all i had to do is say one word and
[13:31] i took that picture of banana
[13:34] transmitted it to your mind that's how
[13:36] language works and god made it for a
[13:39] reason he invented that
[13:41] one thing that's phenomenal to me is
[13:42] that we get language we get our first
[13:44] language for free the second one's hard
[13:46] to learn but we get our first one free
[13:48] when you're a baby god programmed you to
[13:50] start to learn language whatever you're
[13:52] exposed to that's what you're going to
[13:53] learn
[13:55] it's language and later on in life you
[13:57] can begin to receive
[13:58] god through
[14:00] faith kung by hearing through hearing
[14:02] the word of god
[14:04] so god condescended into a word form or
[14:06] a i like to say like this and i might be
[14:08] wrong for saying this i believe you
[14:09] could say it that it's a word
[14:12] description of who god is
[14:15] god chose to do it that way he chose to
[14:17] condescend
[14:18] and then brother ben goes on to say it's
[14:20] like a child playing for his father's
[14:21] door with all eternity before him and
[14:23] begins to create and all these worlds
[14:25] roll off of his hands
[14:28] philippians 4. brother dale's quoted
[14:30] this for years at the end of every
[14:31] sermon think on these things i want to
[14:33] just break that down for a few minutes
[14:35] and then get to a story
[14:36] that i want to tell y'all that's really
[14:38] exemplifies all this
[14:40] i didn't reorder these these are exactly
[14:42] the order that paul puts them in if i'm
[14:43] wrong about saying this
[14:45] this proce this process still works even
[14:47] if paul didn't intend this if god didn't
[14:49] intend this
[14:50] i might be wrong okay for interpolating
[14:52] whatever this way but look
[14:54] if you go right up the line
[14:56] at the bottom we start with the very
[14:58] bottom on the left side where it says
[14:59] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[15:02] one two three four five six seven eight
[15:03] right up the page you see
[15:05] eight things eternity right
[15:08] first thing
[15:10] paul says is truth this is our
[15:13] meditation scripture
[15:15] this is what i use all the time in
[15:17] meditation
[15:18] it's a process you think of two things
[15:21] basically you can think of your natural
[15:22] journey how god got you to where you are
[15:24] naturally speaking in life and think of
[15:26] your spiritual journey how he got you
[15:28] where you are today
[15:29] in your spiritual journey first thing we
[15:32] all hear is truth
[15:33] some point in our life when we were a
[15:35] sinner we were going in the wrong
[15:36] direction a downward trajectory we were
[15:38] trending down for our whole life until
[15:41] salvation when the word convicted our
[15:43] heart we started on an upward trajectory
[15:46] so the first thing that intercepted us
[15:47] was truth when it convicted our heart
[15:50] yes i didn't read the scripture romans
[15:51] 10 so then faith coming by hearing here
[15:53] by the word of god
[15:55] that word that logos that speech when
[15:57] you first hear that and it comes with a
[15:58] conviction in your heart
[16:00] then it calls you to be honest the
[16:02] second thing paul mentions there honesty
[16:04] for godly sorrow worketh repentance to
[16:07] salvation it's like that mirror and i
[16:09] think it's in the book of james when
[16:10] you're looking in the word of god and
[16:12] you see yourself the law that was our
[16:14] schoolmaster the word that tells you you
[16:17] don't match this and you first realize
[16:19] and it's like it's so surreal you're all
[16:21] of a sudden sees you're a sinner needs
[16:22] salvation it's not because you're afraid
[16:24] of hell it's because you realize you
[16:26] need god
[16:27] okay you really need god in your life
[16:29] and you begin to be honest then you go
[16:30] through justification and sanctification
[16:32] he says what's everything that are just
[16:34] what other things are pure whatever
[16:35] things are lovely the baptism the holy
[16:37] ghost the love of god shed abroad in
[16:39] your heart makes your life a good report
[16:41] he says if they're whatever things are
[16:42] of good report
[16:44] that's where god gives you the token the
[16:46] baptism of the holy spirit and it puts
[16:48] you in faith in the pyramid and you're
[16:50] still just starting your journey you
[16:52] still have a lot of growth to go
[16:54] and he says if there be any virtue
[16:57] the virtues
[16:58] virtue knowledge temperature patience
[16:59] god and kindness brother uh godliness
[17:01] brother kindness and if there be any
[17:03] praise the capstone us united with god
[17:05] so god has the preeminence in flesh like
[17:08] he always wanted to
[17:09] the ultimate praise to god we can praise
[17:11] him and worship and get in the spirit
[17:13] but then what he really wants is to
[17:15] inhabit flesh he wants to inhabit us
[17:19] now think keep in mind you can think
[17:21] well i'm right i believe the revelation
[17:23] of the word i believe my pastor i
[17:24] believe everything the ministers preach
[17:25] i sit here come every sunday and listen
[17:27] to the word good
[17:28] now it's possible to believe something
[17:30] wrong and not know it
[17:32] proverbs 20 the spirit of man is the
[17:34] count of the lord searching all the
[17:36] inner parts of the belly i'm telling you
[17:37] why it's so important to study and pray
[17:39] and seek god
[17:41] hebrews 4 for the word of god is quick
[17:43] and powerful sharpening any to his sword
[17:44] pushing the dividing sun or soul and
[17:46] spirit of the joint submarine is the
[17:47] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[17:49] the heart
[17:50] so when you don't even realize you're
[17:51] wrong the word of god is coming in
[17:53] because you're reading it taking it on
[17:54] day by day it's coming and doing its
[17:57] supernatural work of sanctifying taking
[17:59] all those wrong elements out of your
[18:00] canvas and painting the right picture
[18:03] search me oh god and know my heart this
[18:05] is david try me and know my thoughts see
[18:07] if they're being wicked away in me and
[18:09] leave me in the way everlasting
[18:13] this thing takes a long time to go the
[18:14] next slide who do you say this is
[18:16] brother brandon said the evidence of the
[18:17] holy ghost is believing his word always
[18:19] been in every age if you can receive the
[18:22] word
[18:23] i'll skip that one
[18:25] and then they got down there and blow up
[18:27] like a toad frog eating buckshot i don't
[18:29] know if any girl ever encountered this
[18:31] than anybody i have
[18:32] how can you believe when you've got
[18:33] nothing to believe with if god's in your
[18:35] heart's throne i tell you he will agree
[18:37] with every word i've encountered people
[18:39] in and out of the message they usually
[18:41] come to me i'm not going to them trying
[18:43] to correct them in doctrine people have
[18:44] come to me try to straighten me out and
[18:46] then i tell them something that's
[18:47] contrary to them and they look like this
[18:50] they absolutely swell up in the neck and
[18:51] get mad and angry and i'm thinking why
[18:53] are you so upset if you know what you
[18:55] believe don't worry about it i know what
[18:57] i believe so i'm not scared when i blow
[18:58] up like a tow truck getting a buck shot
[19:01] uh cats turn sideways i swell up in
[19:03] their back you know because they're
[19:04] trying to when they feel intimidated
[19:05] they're trying to look big and bulky and
[19:07] i guess maybe frogs do do it for maybe
[19:09] the same reason around a predator or
[19:10] something trying to look tough and mean
[19:12] why are you so scared if you know what
[19:13] you believe
[19:14] don't be afraid
[19:16] but anyway that just shows the wrong
[19:18] attitude much like cain had the wrong
[19:20] attitude abel had the right revelation
[19:21] had the right sacrifice god accepted it
[19:23] cain's main problem was not that he had
[19:25] the wrong painting he had a beautiful
[19:27] painting with fruits all over it and he
[19:29] said god i want to give you such a
[19:30] beautiful offering you have to accept it
[19:32] and god said that's not according to the
[19:34] original painting i can't take that but
[19:36] if you do like able you'll be accepted
[19:38] or won't you be accepted and then kane
[19:40] said nope i've already took in my canvas
[19:42] i've hung it on the wall i've framed it
[19:45] don't touch it i like it the way it is
[19:47] leave it
[19:49] and you blow up like a bullfrogging
[19:50] buckshot and killed abel right wrong
[19:53] attitude hateful mean murder and
[19:55] everything else
[19:57] totally the wrong attitude mainly
[19:59] because he wouldn't take truth when it
[20:00] was presented to him
[20:02] and we're actually told in scripture
[20:03] first john 4 believe not every spirit
[20:06] betrays the spirits were there of god
[20:07] but we are supposed to try them
[20:09] when we're going down in one way in life
[20:11] and then god sends someone whether it be
[20:13] a laity or a preacher or even just a
[20:15] friend or whoever and tries to give you
[20:17] correction you have to consider it
[20:19] that's all i'm saying you have to
[20:21] consider it don't paint
[20:23] frame your painting so i believe this
[20:24] for 40 years blessed god
[20:26] but if our gospel will be hid it's head
[20:28] to them that are lost in whom the god of
[20:30] this world hath blinded the minds of
[20:32] damage believe not lest the light of the
[20:34] boy's gospel
[20:35] should shine to them let me try to speak
[20:38] through this i still got my story to
[20:39] tell
[20:40] i got down in a few more minutes
[20:42] john 5 and the father himself which i
[20:44] sent me as boring witness of me you
[20:46] never have heard his voice anytime or
[20:47] seen his shape if not his word abiding
[20:49] you
[20:50] for and then you think of eternal life
[20:52] search the scriptures he told us
[20:55] this thing is so slow
[20:57] if revelation is beyond you look up and
[20:59] seek god for it that is the only way
[21:01] you're ever going to get it a revelation
[21:03] has to come from god you have to receive
[21:05] the holy ghost and then only in the
[21:07] spirit god give you revelation jesus is
[21:09] the christ god the anointed one
[21:12] i want to tell y'all a little story and
[21:14] i've been leading up to this the whole
[21:16] time okay
[21:18] once upon a time
[21:20] that was a little girl
[21:22] oh yeah he said i need to call him god
[21:24] for revelation more than anything else
[21:25] in the world there's a little girl named
[21:27] jesse
[21:29] and this little girl
[21:33] was born in an alcoholic family she was
[21:36] the middle of three girls there they are
[21:37] jessie
[21:38] jackie and jennifer
[21:40] this was the middle of three girls now
[21:43] she was born alcoholic home poor home
[21:45] and grew up living sometimes in a tent
[21:47] sometimes in a car sometimes in a an old
[21:50] run-down house with an outhouse that
[21:51] didn't work so they had to use a bucket
[21:53] in the closet that was their bathroom
[21:54] much of the time growing up like third
[21:56] world country kind of scenario begging
[21:59] on the street for food um all of them
[22:02] that mom and dad made them little signs
[22:03] hold up signs and we're hungry you know
[22:05] feed us
[22:06] and then the mom and dad will take some
[22:07] of that money and go buy more alcohol
[22:09] totally addicted to alcohol just ruin
[22:10] that home well eventually they wound up
[22:12] in jail these uh the oldest of these
[22:14] girls jennifer went to live with their
[22:15] grandma the little two the
[22:17] uh jessie and jackie went to live in
[22:20] foster care they were orphans so now
[22:22] she's growing up as an orphan
[22:24] from age 10 to about age 17 and all that
[22:27] time tossed around from home to home
[22:28] into home and a lot of them foster homes
[22:30] actually bring in these orphan kids and
[22:32] make them like little slaves a little
[22:33] cinderella she had to pull up weeds and
[22:36] scrub the floors and all that kind of
[22:38] stuff and then hoping at the end of it
[22:39] that they'd keep her and then they turn
[22:40] around again no go to another home and
[22:43] all that time she was praying god i just
[22:44] want a family please just give me a
[22:46] family
[22:47] and this little girl grew up that way
[22:49] and age 14 the longer she spent in this
[22:52] foster care
[22:53] system the the the more she gave up she
[22:55] began to give up hope
[22:57] and around 14 she started trying to kill
[22:59] herself and and who wouldn't in that
[23:00] scenario when she had grown up really
[23:02] rough sexually abused emotionally abused
[23:04] physically abused
[23:06] on every form of view of abuse before
[23:08] with foster care and and then um some
[23:10] not so good things in foster care too
[23:12] she's trying to kill herself
[23:14] and then
[23:15] but i have to mention this
[23:17] her name was jessica which means god
[23:20] beholds remember what i said at the
[23:22] beginning god behold your life from the
[23:24] time you're in the womb to the time
[23:26] you're born he's watching you waiting
[23:28] for you to come to what you're
[23:29] predestinated to
[23:31] so there she was little jessica which
[23:32] means god beholds
[23:34] how likely how unlikely is it that she
[23:36] would ever come to eternal life to
[23:38] salvation to accept the message but
[23:40] today she believes the message and she
[23:42] studies and prays and sees god with all
[23:44] of her heart how did she come to that
[23:46] how unlikely is that of that home you
[23:49] know i was born raised to baptist it was
[23:51] kind of in my programming i was already
[23:52] going to church when i came to message
[23:54] it was hard to receive it but yet not as
[23:56] hard as it would be it seemed like for
[23:57] someone from that kind of background as
[23:59] little jesse
[24:00] but yet god beholds
[24:03] and then one day came this message
[24:04] family this husband and wife that wanted
[24:06] to adopt a boy they came to this picnic
[24:08] the foster system put on this picnic of
[24:11] all the little foster kids could meet
[24:12] some potential adoptive parents here
[24:15] they came this message family and they
[24:16] said well we want to get this boy we've
[24:17] adopted a bunch of girls we want a boy
[24:19] they took a picture of this boy they got
[24:21] to know him a little bit they took the
[24:22] picture home developed it developed the
[24:24] film
[24:25] and it was jesse
[24:26] and jackie
[24:27] but they took a picture of the boy
[24:30] but jesse and jackie showed up in the
[24:32] picture
[24:33] and they said well maybe the lord's
[24:34] dealing with us so they they uh prayed
[24:36] about it and said lord this your will
[24:38] and he wanted evidence to adopt these
[24:39] two girls the mama picked out she said i
[24:42] want this one and you can have that one
[24:43] she started already picking them out
[24:45] who's whose is whose so they went
[24:46] adopted these girls
[24:48] and
[24:50] totally still wearing pants makeup and
[24:52] everything you would be surprised that a
[24:54] message family bring someone like that
[24:55] into their home but they didn't care
[24:56] they wanted to adopt them give them a
[24:58] home and love them
[24:59] so age 17 jesse got to pick her new name
[25:02] when she got adopted she said i want to
[25:04] be called
[25:05] gabrielle
[25:06] and i want to go by the name of gabby
[25:09] and this is what she looked like when
[25:11] she came into that home when they
[25:13] adopted her
[25:14] now you talking about what if what if
[25:18] there she is on the left jesse and on
[25:19] the right is gabby my wife what if when
[25:22] she got adopted and they presented her
[25:24] with the message and with christ what if
[25:26] she kept her canvas and said you know
[25:27] what i've been all these different
[25:28] denominational churches in the foster
[25:30] care i'm going to frame my picture like
[25:32] i understand of god already i'm going to
[25:33] frame it hang on the wall you can't
[25:35] touch it musicians come please
[25:37] i'm going to frame my picture and nobody
[25:39] can touch it what if she did that what
[25:40] if she didn't keep an open mind and let
[25:43] christ in what if she just hardened her
[25:45] heart and said no i won't have it i
[25:47] won't have it but instead she opened her
[25:49] heart in her mind and she said lord i
[25:51] want you more than anything and today
[25:52] she stays up half the night studying and
[25:54] praying and seeking god with all of her
[25:56] heart
[25:58] so my point is in this whole lesson is
[26:00] keep your canvas open keep your mind
[26:02] your heart open and one of the ways to
[26:03] do that is read the bible and pray every
[26:05] day such a simple process
[26:08] god bless you all thank you
