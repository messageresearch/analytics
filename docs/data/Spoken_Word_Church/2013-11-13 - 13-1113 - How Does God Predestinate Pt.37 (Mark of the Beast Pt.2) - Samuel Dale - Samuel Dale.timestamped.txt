[4:29] father we thank you for this day and
[4:31] your grace and your love
[4:33] thank you for calvary
[4:35] because without that lord what good
[4:36] would the day be
[4:38] but with calvary in our mind we can be
[4:40] so happy of people
[4:42] to rejoice and realize that
[4:44] death has been conquered
[4:47] and we don't have to die
[4:49] all done finished
[4:50] and all we got to do is depend on you
[4:52] and lord we ask you to come with us
[4:54] tonight and now and just
[4:55] be here not as an onlooker to record our
[4:57] deeds but to be the preeminent one in
[5:00] each one of our hearts and lives that
[5:01] you can speak to us
[5:03] and guide us in your love in your grace
[5:05] forgive our sins because we want to
[5:07] stand complete in you lord and just have
[5:09] your way we certainly do appreciate all
[5:11] of these veterans
[5:12] all of the service people that were
[5:15] there and spent their time
[5:17] because we wouldn't be free tonight if
[5:19] it wasn't for that so we thank you we
[5:21] love you and we honor your great name
[5:23] and guide us in jesus is that name amen
[5:26] and amen okay
[5:28] we go to where we've been reading in
[5:29] romans 1
[5:35] 8 and we know that all things work
[5:37] together for good to them that love god
[5:40] to them who are the called according to
[5:41] his purpose
[5:43] for whom he did for no
[5:45] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[5:47] to the image of his son
[5:49] that he might be the firstborn among
[5:50] many brethren
[5:52] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[5:54] he also called and whom he called
[5:57] then he also justified in whom he
[5:59] justified them he also glorified
[6:02] what shall we then say to these things
[6:04] if god be for us who can be against us
[6:07] that's a good point in it
[6:09] every time i'd like to preach on that a
[6:10] while
[6:11] that would be good all right let's go to
[6:13] to genesis
[6:15] you say well you've been preached on it
[6:17] 37 times
[6:18] not just 36.
[6:21] genesis 4 let's start reading about
[6:24] verse i don't know where they pulled up
[6:25] 11
[6:26] uh
[6:28] or
[6:30] you know verse 11.
[6:32] because it's talking about cain and
[6:34] that's what we've been on
[6:36] on predestination
[6:39] and we covered the part of
[6:41] that we believe in predestination by
[6:43] foreknowledge
[6:45] that god foreknew and he knew what would
[6:47] happen in the garden he knew we would
[6:49] fall he knew if he made us gave us free
[6:51] moral agency we would fault he knew that
[6:54] but that didn't just leave the story
[6:56] blank
[6:57] but we're having to just cover the
[6:59] things that has been brought from there
[7:01] to here now
[7:03] but remember
[7:05] as he saw what
[7:07] jacob would do what he saw would do and
[7:10] could predestinate accordingly he saw
[7:12] what you and i would do he saw what they
[7:14] would do in the garden so he could
[7:16] predestinate according to what the
[7:18] people would do and that's all we're
[7:20] trying to do is see how that back there
[7:23] because if we keep looking back
[7:26] we're going to miss the whole story
[7:28] but if we look at ourselves and see
[7:30] ourselves
[7:31] in god's word
[7:33] and be able to just look right straight
[7:35] into the word and say lord
[7:37] help me
[7:39] not everybody else see we want to blame
[7:41] adam and eve brother and said you don't
[7:42] blame them now he said that's you and i
[7:46] their choices are now i can't say they
[7:48] caused it
[7:49] go see we caused it all right but look
[7:52] what he's saying to him
[7:55] he said in thou art cursed from the
[7:57] earth
[7:58] which had opened her mouth to receive
[8:00] thy brother's blood from thy hand
[8:02] remember
[8:03] he had killed him and yeah
[8:05] god has said where where's your brother
[8:07] and all of that
[8:09] when god tell us the ground it shall not
[8:10] henceforth yield unto thee
[8:13] her strength now remember adam was
[8:17] over here the world was cursed with him
[8:19] and
[8:20] it said it won't be able to do well what
[8:22] about this is the x-tree placed upon
[8:25] cain now
[8:27] all right
[8:28] because already the earth is cursed
[8:30] instead of
[8:32] fugitive in a vagabond shall thou be in
[8:34] thy in the earth and cain said unto the
[8:36] lord
[8:37] my punishment is greater than i can bear
[8:41] behold thou hast driven me out this day
[8:42] from the face of the earth and from thy
[8:45] face shall i be head
[8:48] and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond
[8:49] in the earth and it shall come to price
[8:52] that everyone that findeth me
[8:54] shall slay me
[8:55] and the lord said unto him
[8:57] therefore whosoever slayeth cain
[9:00] venus will be taken on him sevenfold
[9:04] and the lord set a mark on cain
[9:07] lest any finding him
[9:10] should kill him you may be seated the
[9:12] lord had his blessing to the
[9:15] to the reading of the word
[9:17] now
[9:18] what are we trying to cover or what have
[9:21] we tried to cover about it
[9:23] and we'll get back into this in a little
[9:25] bit
[9:27] but
[9:28] remember
[9:29] now you can read and it sounds like in
[9:31] the bible
[9:32] you can read it it sound like in the
[9:34] prophet and everything but
[9:36] did god put a mark on cain
[9:40] you know
[9:43] all right
[9:45] or really was it cain
[9:50] that
[9:51] marked his own self
[9:54] now it's like i've tried to show you
[9:57] the prophet said cain could have been
[9:58] saved
[10:00] if he'd done what was right
[10:02] god is still at the time dealing with
[10:04] cain
[10:07] all right
[10:08] and dealing with cain he's got to be
[10:10] awful why is he dealing with if he's not
[10:12] offering
[10:14] but see cain goes out
[10:19] you say well no the bible says the lord
[10:21] sent him out
[10:23] oh that's all well and good but get the
[10:25] point
[10:28] had he stayed in the presence of the
[10:30] lord look where he would have been
[10:34] at least he'd had an opportunity
[10:38] all right
[10:39] but if you say the we're going to read
[10:41] the prophet when he says
[10:43] that the mark that was put on cain was
[10:45] the mark of the beast
[10:49] and that mark of the beast is in your
[10:51] intelligence
[10:55] right
[10:57] when we get down to it where he said
[10:58] it's a trinitarian doctrine
[11:01] he said well there was no trinitarian
[11:02] doctrine back there
[11:05] well you explained why brother branham
[11:07] said he failed on hebrews 13 8.
[11:10] was it back there
[11:13] all right
[11:15] but you see my whole point that i've
[11:16] tried to get you to look at
[11:22] i believe
[11:23] that god
[11:25] didn't set a mark on cain of a different
[11:27] color race or a different water because
[11:29] that would have ended at the flood
[11:31] and it wouldn't work see and if
[11:33] blackness is a curse height blackness to
[11:35] be half cursed so we're high cursed
[11:38] you know that you can't run nothing like
[11:40] that
[11:43] the jews are
[11:44] where they're at and all that most of
[11:45] the time we are dark and we are
[11:48] are they cursed
[11:49] no they're god's people well then get it
[11:51] out of our minds something like that we
[11:53] get it out of our mind too that there's
[11:55] some kind of a
[11:56] of a
[11:57] mark to be put on
[11:59] where it says in your forehead you know
[12:02] it says in your hand
[12:03] well brother brown said we'll read it i
[12:05] mean he said it's not no tattoo
[12:08] all right
[12:09] you know
[12:11] he said that's not what it is
[12:13] well then there was no tattoo put on
[12:15] cane
[12:21] see cain displayed his unbelief by
[12:24] killing his brother
[12:27] he was already marked
[12:30] by unbelief
[12:32] all right
[12:33] but it's like i was trying to explain
[12:35] there to you
[12:36] i believe it you know i mean this is
[12:38] this is my belief
[12:40] that
[12:42] god didn't stamp cain with something
[12:46] it was cain's intelligence himself that
[12:48] drove him out from the presence of the
[12:50] lord
[12:52] what do you want to say god ran him out
[12:54] or whether he went out himself
[12:55] irregardless he went out
[12:58] all right
[12:59] that was the part of the display of the
[13:01] mark of the beast
[13:03] right
[13:05] by him going away from god displayed
[13:07] whatever had happened back here
[13:10] we know it was unbelief all right
[13:15] but it looked like reading that god put
[13:17] some kind of a mark on cain
[13:20] but i told you the best way i can
[13:21] understand that is
[13:24] adam should have killed cain
[13:29] i mean he killed his own
[13:31] son
[13:34] you ain't dealing with a new birth of
[13:35] trying to say well we pray for him you
[13:37] know
[13:38] no
[13:41] you're dealing back there is it
[13:44] don't you think
[13:46] adam thought a lot about what should i
[13:48] do he killed his brother he may kill us
[13:50] next
[13:54] we see he took away from adam
[13:57] or even at the lineage of adam to seth
[14:00] that would come on later
[14:03] when seth was said
[14:05] i'm due to kill my brother
[14:07] because he killed my brother you know
[14:10] all right you say well that wouldn't
[14:12] back there but if hebrews 13 8 was back
[14:14] there
[14:15] what about over in the scriptures you
[14:17] know where a
[14:18] brother would take an oath to kill it
[14:20] somebody killed his brother he went
[14:21] after him
[14:24] and you know that god didn't stop him
[14:27] unless it was something like he saw in
[14:28] jacob where he
[14:30] but what did he do what he saw on jacob
[14:33] he changed he saws thinking
[14:37] right
[14:38] and protected jacob so he changed adam's
[14:42] thinking
[14:45] to me that's what
[14:46] it means when he said
[14:49] he put a mark on him the word that
[14:51] nobody wouldn't kill him
[14:54] you know that protective mark must have
[14:56] lasted a good one
[14:58] because he went on and lived and
[15:01] had
[15:02] lineages but do you realize what if cain
[15:04] what if adam had killed kane
[15:11] i mean that's the way i think you know
[15:12] i'm sorry
[15:15] if adam had to kill cain that would have
[15:16] stopped the serpent seed lineage
[15:23] then how could god displayed his
[15:25] salvation or anything
[15:27] for anybody
[15:31] see then you wind up saying well what is
[15:33] the mark
[15:35] i said that about brother colley it was
[15:37] a great thing see that time when those
[15:39] brothers said well we don't know what
[15:40] the mark was it was put on cane and i
[15:43] was coming down the road and i said well
[15:44] brother collie i don't know what it was
[15:46] either
[15:48] and he said i know what it was
[15:52] that is the mark of the beast he said i
[15:54] just heard the prophet say it
[15:57] you know i might not have said it to him
[15:59] then but i'm just thinking well turn
[16:01] around go back up there and let him tell
[16:02] them fellers you know that
[16:04] i don't mean it wrong well
[16:06] they're they're what they're supposed to
[16:07] be
[16:09] all right
[16:10] but see it's the mark of the beast
[16:14] now what is the mark of the beast
[16:21] it can't be a tattoo
[16:23] it can't be a coloration of skin
[16:26] it can't be any kind of uh
[16:28] doings like that
[16:34] and the prophet said
[16:36] everybody in the world today
[16:40] either has the seal of god or the mark
[16:42] of the beast
[16:46] he said when i'm justified sanctified
[16:48] brother that will praise god
[16:50] but you're not born again so you still
[16:52] mark with the mark of the beast
[16:56] that's hard to say about
[16:58] our parents our kin folks our our loved
[17:00] ones or whatever you know maybe our
[17:02] children or whatever to look at them has
[17:05] to do it but
[17:07] being sympathetic with it's not going to
[17:09] change them
[17:11] you know
[17:12] i mean the best you can do is explain to
[17:15] them
[17:16] what thing is
[17:20] but explain it to him in love
[17:22] you remember we went through that and
[17:24] over where the cain said take it or
[17:26] leave it
[17:28] well i only thought the one quote was
[17:30] there that
[17:31] i wrote down 40 years ago that
[17:34] you know
[17:35] that where he said take it or leave it
[17:37] i've done all i'm going to do and and i
[17:39] didn't realize brother randle said so
[17:40] many times they would even relate down
[17:43] right to where you and i are today
[17:46] and he says 99
[17:49] out of a hundred
[17:54] right
[17:55] you know
[17:59] 99 out of 100 i gave you that quote
[18:01] there
[18:02] last wednesday i guess it was
[18:07] it's saying just like cain
[18:11] i go to church i worship i do what else
[18:13] you want me to do
[18:15] i believe the message of the hour i'm
[18:17] you know i'm hunting fish for the
[18:18] prophet i
[18:20] i walk with the lord jesus as they'd say
[18:27] but see we take anything
[18:30] whatsoever
[18:31] different from a revelation
[18:35] where does that leave us
[18:38] anything i i don't care where it's you
[18:40] me who it is you know
[18:43] where does it leave us
[18:46] it leaves us in the same situation
[18:49] where cain was at
[18:53] and you say but
[18:55] the mark of the beast
[18:57] all right we'll get to one in a minute
[18:59] where brother branham you've heard him
[19:00] say it over and over
[19:01] and and i never really caught it
[19:04] as to be able to explain it until the
[19:06] other day when i was reading my notes on
[19:08] it and i'll read it in just a minute
[19:11] and uh
[19:13] brother branham said every doctrine
[19:15] there ever is come out of genesis
[19:22] and he said like this something i'll
[19:24] i'll read it i mean if i don't remember
[19:25] which one he said uh he said could you
[19:27] prove the assembly started
[19:31] in the garden
[19:33] well well see the church assemblies
[19:34] didn't start in the garden
[19:37] there was no church assemblies in the
[19:38] garden you know what i mean
[19:40] so what is he talking about when he says
[19:43] everyone he's talking about the spirit
[19:45] of the thing
[19:48] the spirit of those things is what was
[19:50] in the garden all right
[19:53] so then you can see then that the spirit
[19:55] of god was in the garden because there's
[19:56] two trees but the spirit of the
[19:58] antichrist or devil was in the garden
[20:03] and that's what caused them to do what
[20:05] they've done and that's what's causing
[20:08] us today to do what we're doing
[20:12] one spirit or the other is motivating us
[20:16] it's controlling us
[20:19] because there's only two powers
[20:21] right all right
[20:23] so then then what are we doing
[20:25] let's read a few because i don't want to
[20:26] stay
[20:27] so much on the mark of the beast anybody
[20:29] in the message has been around very long
[20:32] and you you you know that
[20:35] what it is
[20:37] because i i want to get down to the bot
[20:38] to the
[20:39] real part of the message but look what
[20:41] the prophet had to say now
[20:44] so we'll read a few of them
[20:46] e18 of the mark of the beast 61
[20:49] 216. we find out that the first marking
[20:52] of a human being started in genesis
[20:56] genesis 4 15
[20:58] god mark cain
[21:00] that's where the first mark of the beast
[21:03] was ever put on was put on cane
[21:08] he's the beginning of it
[21:09] you say cain having the mark of the
[21:11] beast
[21:12] he said all right so he goes to
[21:14] explaining in that quote what the mark
[21:16] of the beast is look at the next one
[21:19] this is still off the
[21:20] this is e25
[21:22] with the same message mark of the beasts
[21:24] are the seal of god
[21:25] uh part one
[21:28] and look what he explains and you'll see
[21:29] the difference
[21:31] a mark is a distinction
[21:34] it makes a difference it separates
[21:35] something but like you say you got one
[21:37] mark against you
[21:39] a mark
[21:40] but you never said you have one seal
[21:42] against you
[21:45] so there's a difference to mark and a
[21:47] seal
[21:50] right
[21:51] yeah brother branham will use them in
[21:53] both the same i checked it he'll use
[21:55] mark and seal and interrelate them
[21:58] that's fine but look what he's
[21:59] explaining but you never said you have
[22:01] one seal against you
[22:03] you've got one mark against you and a
[22:05] seal is a sign of ownership
[22:09] seal is a sign of onshore but what's
[22:11] tomorrow a mark is a distinction
[22:15] and the church is sealed by the holy gho
[22:17] holy spirit
[22:19] showing as ownership god owns the church
[22:22] but the mark of the beast is the wayward
[22:25] the outcasts that refused to take and
[22:28] come god's provided way
[22:30] cain as soon as he was marked was sent
[22:33] away
[22:34] we get that abel died and seth raised up
[22:37] to take his place was going on into the
[22:39] resurrection but think about what he's
[22:41] saying
[22:45] see today
[22:48] it's not just the outcast like we think
[22:52] i was listening to a tape the other day
[22:54] and brought around and said it like this
[22:55] he said
[22:56] i hope that this doesn't bother you he
[22:58] said i make this so strong
[23:00] he said until it looks like that
[23:03] you know that it's not religious people
[23:06] but he said it is
[23:10] i mean when you get over to jacob and
[23:12] esau with the thing
[23:15] we would have picked esau every time
[23:20] huh and you come down today to
[23:24] doing it i was thinking today what was
[23:26] at the chiropractor and seeing his view
[23:28] and his family there
[23:30] was i'm not saying they're no wrong or
[23:32] whatever
[23:34] i'm just saying there was pictures of
[23:36] his family that he says they all love
[23:38] the lord they're all serving the lord
[23:40] well amen
[23:44] but there are this haircut and pants and
[23:46] things
[23:50] we see they're serving
[23:52] but they've been taught that that's okay
[24:00] right
[24:02] i mean they wouldn't do it if they
[24:03] hadn't been taught it was okay
[24:04] maybe not somebody got it's okay to do
[24:06] this now you know what i'm saying
[24:11] but yet it's a religious society
[24:15] good people
[24:19] why would brother brown make a statement
[24:21] he said i'd rather have the church on
[24:22] the corner than a bureau joint or
[24:23] something you know honky tonks or
[24:25] something
[24:26] on the corner there
[24:29] we see we're so super religious
[24:32] you know
[24:34] i was just thinking about it the other
[24:36] day i'll say it
[24:39] see some people will say
[24:41] i just soon go down to walmart and walk
[24:43] around
[24:44] and go to a fellowship meeting
[24:49] i'll change the name to walmart to
[24:52] dick sporting good or
[24:54] cabela's or
[24:56] you know somewhere
[25:00] now
[25:01] you tell me that's right
[25:06] i mean
[25:07] it doesn't fit but that's our way of
[25:09] thinking
[25:14] we say well it don't make me spiritual
[25:16] to go
[25:17] no but am i happy
[25:20] to become spiritual
[25:23] right
[25:26] now we believe in predestination don't
[25:28] we amen
[25:29] amen
[25:30] what if it's predestinated as i said the
[25:32] other day we say well it's god's
[25:34] obligated to put it on the pulpit well
[25:36] what if that's where it's at where he's
[25:38] putting it i just come on i just put it
[25:40] that way just do what you want to and
[25:43] i'm not arguing with nobody whether you
[25:44] go or not
[25:49] but now when you tell me that it's the
[25:50] antichrist
[25:54] then i'm going to tell you
[25:57] everywhere you go saturday
[26:03] is antichrist
[26:06] that's all i'm going to say
[26:09] and i'm not trying to talk anybody in
[26:10] going to meetings and things
[26:13] i'm just telling you that we want to
[26:15] build those things like it's something
[26:23] but you see you say well you just turned
[26:24] down the word of the lord well
[26:27] what have you turned down
[26:29] you showed me going to walmart is the
[26:30] word of the lord
[26:35] come on
[26:37] but you see church
[26:38] we don't realize
[26:40] what's going on look at the next one
[26:43] e15 mark of the b seal of gods which is
[26:45] number two
[26:46] which is uh 61 216. that was 217 we've
[26:50] been dealing with
[26:51] going to the next one
[26:58] see i got a note today said could you
[27:00] prove that the assemblies of god started
[27:02] in in genesis
[27:04] i don't know about the organization
[27:06] but the spirit that's in the assemblies
[27:08] of god started in genesis
[27:11] now that that helped me whether it does
[27:13] you or not
[27:14] that really helped me
[27:17] because then i'm not looking for
[27:18] assemblies
[27:20] building in
[27:24] i'm looking at the spirit of things
[27:28] that's exactly right
[27:30] and all the other born-again churches
[27:32] started in genesis
[27:35] now
[27:37] all the other born-again churches
[27:38] started in genesis
[27:40] and all are supposed to be churches just
[27:42] nominal churches they started in genesis
[27:45] and they both was represented in the
[27:47] first two sons
[27:49] both cain and abel
[27:52] cain received the mark of the beast
[27:55] and was sent away we realized that the
[27:57] serpent which was the one that had
[27:59] deceived his mother was a beast and not
[28:01] a reptile he was the most subtle of all
[28:03] the beasts of the field in genesis 14 or
[28:06] genesis 4
[28:07] 15 brother that god sent
[28:10] mark cain
[28:11] and as soon as cain was marked
[28:14] he went out of the presence of the lord
[28:18] what
[28:20] did you get it last night
[28:22] go back to the message part and listen
[28:24] to it
[28:25] what you think about it it's the spirit
[28:27] of things
[28:29] amen you know
[28:32] all right we we
[28:35] we're not i i've never claimed to be a
[28:37] prophet or anything like that i just
[28:38] claim to be a christian and try to
[28:40] preach all right
[28:42] but
[28:44] i don't walk by an assembly's church
[28:47] well i ain't going in there
[28:49] i'll get them bad spirits on me
[28:54] i don't care where it's assembled it's
[28:55] baptist methodist presbyterian are
[28:57] people in this message
[29:00] don't worry about going in there and
[29:01] getting bad spirits
[29:04] you've already got one
[29:07] and just like brother brandon we'll get
[29:08] to in a minute where he says the mark of
[29:09] the beast
[29:12] he said you're already marked
[29:17] he said the punishment comes later
[29:21] he says there's no middle of the road
[29:24] we either have the mark of the beast or
[29:27] we have the seal of god and if we're
[29:29] born again we've got the seal of god
[29:32] but if we're not born again we've got
[29:34] the mark of the beast
[29:38] but are we willing to admit it
[29:41] no i've been in church all of my life
[29:42] don't you tell me i got the mark of the
[29:44] beast
[29:46] more people you tell the people of this
[29:48] message
[29:49] that
[29:50] it's a serpent
[29:52] seed you know
[29:55] it's all mankind don't you tell me big
[29:58] boy
[29:59] don't you tell me that stuff
[30:01] i'm a predestinated seed
[30:07] just remember everything's predestinated
[30:11] look what he said on the true esther
[30:12] seal 1961 404 402
[30:17] and satan's sons
[30:20] will be sealed
[30:21] in this last days
[30:24] satan's sons
[30:27] now
[30:31] how did he explain it i've got it in
[30:33] here somewhere
[30:34] but he said we're all born
[30:37] between
[30:39] satan and eve right i believe
[30:43] that's what he said
[30:46] we don't want to think about no i'm a
[30:48] i'm a i come up with my family come over
[30:51] on the mayflower don't you say nothing
[30:52] about the dales
[30:55] baloney
[30:57] stowaways probably
[31:00] satan's sons will be sealed in this last
[31:03] days there's a time now watch that the
[31:05] bible spoke that all that did not have
[31:08] the seal of god took the mark of the
[31:10] beast and we know the mark of the beast
[31:12] is what
[31:14] disbelief
[31:17] the first time where did you say the
[31:18] mark of the beast began
[31:20] in the garden of eden mark of the beast
[31:21] and seal of god was performed now watch
[31:24] both of them
[31:25] in the garden of eden
[31:28] now in the garden of eden
[31:31] you know
[31:32] as we would talk about it was revealed
[31:35] to abel
[31:39] right
[31:41] that it was blood right amen
[31:45] and if cain had took that and done what
[31:46] abel done he would have been all right
[31:52] so then cain had the mark of the beast
[31:56] and abel by revelation had the seal of
[31:58] god
[32:01] right right
[32:04] now think about it
[32:06] in the garden of eden mark of the beast
[32:08] and seal of god was performed in the
[32:09] garden of eden
[32:10] exactly it's performed through
[32:13] easter
[32:14] for the dead of abel brought forth saith
[32:18] the death of abel brought forth saith
[32:20] that's right
[32:21] notice cain was the son of satan
[32:24] he was the son of the beast which begot
[32:25] eve
[32:26] you can call it whatever you want to he
[32:28] was the son of satan
[32:30] and what did he do
[32:32] god put a mark on him and sent him out
[32:34] from the presence of god is that right
[32:36] and he got him a wife
[32:38] not out of the heritage of god
[32:40] but got him a wife from the land of nod
[32:43] another land so that's where everybody
[32:45] thinks there's another genealogies of
[32:46] people but just remember brother run
[32:48] said he took his sister that was the
[32:50] only way it could be because there were
[32:51] no other generations
[32:54] there wasn't more people created than
[32:55] adam and eve
[32:57] so he took his sister
[32:59] all right because they wouldn't record
[33:01] it in the
[33:02] genealogies
[33:03] so that's sensible he took his sister
[33:06] i like things to be sensible because i'm
[33:08] sensible thinking
[33:09] you know
[33:11] and that way i say hey that looks pretty
[33:12] good i believe that
[33:14] all right
[33:15] but think about it now
[33:20] look at the next one
[33:22] it says 10 virgins 144 000 1960 12 11
[33:26] the morning service paragraph 3 19.
[33:29] and i just love him don't you yes sir oh
[33:32] what is the what is the seal of god
[33:36] holy ghost what is the mark of the beast
[33:42] reject it
[33:45] so when that
[33:47] pope or what he was the guy you know
[33:50] that the holy ghost tried to come on
[33:53] that brother and spoke of
[33:55] when he didn't receive it what did what
[33:57] did he do
[34:02] all right he rejected it
[34:05] and thereby prove what he was
[34:08] see that's the two one to see in a well
[34:09] there and how many was on the earth that
[34:12] didn't get it all that was not sealed
[34:15] took the mark of the beast
[34:17] all that
[34:19] all that had not the spirit of god
[34:22] had the mark of the beast
[34:23] the seal of god is the holy spirit the
[34:25] bible says so every place in the
[34:27] scripture speaks of it says it's the
[34:28] mark of god
[34:30] what the seal of god
[34:32] and all that did not have it
[34:34] was the one who rejected it
[34:37] and how did they reject it by by
[34:40] refusing to hear it
[34:43] think about that
[34:45] yeah
[34:46] refusing to hear it
[34:50] means you're already
[34:54] marked
[34:56] because you're refusing to hear it
[34:58] not hearing it is one situation right
[35:00] right
[35:03] but hearing it and refusing it
[35:06] all right
[35:09] think about it
[35:12] look at the next one just to get one or
[35:14] two where you could think on these
[35:15] things
[35:17] this is the
[35:18] the mark of the of the beast and seal of
[35:20] god number two
[35:21] um he's 75.
[35:24] it shall be light in the evening time
[35:25] that's right
[35:26] while evening lights are shining why
[35:28] don't you receive it why don't you come
[35:30] to it don't be sealed away
[35:32] don't sit dead believe on the lord jesus
[35:34] christ and be sealed into the kingdom
[35:37] what is the mark of the beast to reject
[35:39] the holy ghost
[35:40] see the borderline see
[35:42] after he once come to the knowledge of
[35:44] the truth for it is impossible for that
[35:47] for those which were once enlightened
[35:49] see coming up to the knowledge of the
[35:51] truth and seeing that they see the truth
[35:55] and see the knowledge of it
[35:57] see it's here
[35:59] see it's working
[36:00] see it's right and have a knowledge of
[36:02] the truth and then turn away again
[36:05] you know there remaineth no more
[36:06] sacrifice for sin
[36:08] just like cain
[36:10] at the beginning so will it be in the
[36:13] end
[36:14] see so we're going to say you're either
[36:16] sealed with christ
[36:18] or we have the mark of the beast
[36:22] now
[36:23] back to what i said a minute ago it's
[36:26] the seal of god
[36:28] all right but
[36:30] it's the mark
[36:32] of the beast
[36:37] and that's why when we get over in far
[36:39] enough you'll see that you have the mark
[36:41] in your forehead
[36:46] right
[36:48] either your hand or your forehead right
[36:50] but think about it now
[36:53] to reject the holy ghost
[36:57] all right
[36:58] off the next message is the token i
[37:00] think it is
[37:01] or the way of a true
[37:06] prophet to the way of the true prophet
[37:08] paragraph 3 3 43.
[37:12] and i must knew yes sir amos knew israel
[37:16] or ungodly lovers
[37:17] who would destroy them
[37:20] and their ungodly lovers of today
[37:22] will soon destroy them
[37:24] the very denominational creeds
[37:26] and things that they were there bound
[37:29] themselves into
[37:31] the pentecostals
[37:33] that's the thing is going to destroy you
[37:37] your creed and denomination
[37:40] it's going to destroy you
[37:42] yeah but i don't have it brother dale
[37:46] you're binding yourself right up yonder
[37:48] take the mark of the beast and don't
[37:50] even know it
[37:52] pulling it right over your eyes see it
[37:54] is a boycott
[37:56] what are you trying to do
[37:58] you belong with this or you don't belong
[38:01] so you just wait
[38:03] just get a little just a little bit
[38:05] longer
[38:07] then you say
[38:08] i'll get out of it then
[38:12] no you won't
[38:16] you're already in it you're already
[38:18] marked you're caught with a mark on you
[38:21] you remember in the the bible times are
[38:23] that
[38:25] like if you was in a
[38:26] in a
[38:27] city
[38:28] you know
[38:29] i forgot which way it goes but you had
[38:31] one year
[38:33] in a certain situation you had one year
[38:37] and and if you'd go out you could go out
[38:39] but if you didn't go out you smart
[38:44] so where are we at
[38:46] see i'm not preaching to somebody to say
[38:48] well well now what it is now uh
[38:50] everybody else is marked but the church
[38:52] at lula's in a in a gray area maybe
[38:55] somewhere in the no no no no
[38:58] you me every one of us
[39:00] we either got the seal of the holy
[39:02] spirit
[39:03] or we got the mark of the beast
[39:06] all right and don't think one of these
[39:08] days i'll get out of it
[39:10] he said you won't you're already in it
[39:13] see no matter esau wept bitterly
[39:16] when he knowed better but he went
[39:18] bitterly trying to find a place to
[39:20] repent and couldn't find it you stay
[39:22] there then
[39:23] now is the time to flee
[39:25] see if you're hearing it flee get out
[39:29] look at the next one the token
[39:33] prison 63
[39:35] 901
[39:37] paragraph 232-233
[39:41] and as we see the great end time signs
[39:43] on earth today we know that that's right
[39:45] that's right
[39:46] now look i've waited for this for a long
[39:49] long time for this message to you
[39:51] see and you've seen the end time signs
[39:54] and i've preached it to you and showed
[39:55] it to you
[39:56] by everything that christ said is that
[39:58] right congregation says amen
[40:00] you'll admit that amen we're at the end
[40:03] time i don't see nothing left
[40:06] you say
[40:07] what about the mark of the beast
[40:10] see they're saying what about the mark
[40:12] of the peace
[40:13] those who reject the holy spirit is
[40:15] already marked by the beast the
[40:17] punishment will come later
[40:22] punishment will come later you can't get
[40:24] out of it you're caught with it being
[40:25] there
[40:27] all right
[40:33] let's read one more then we'll try to
[40:35] pick up this is mark of the beast priest
[40:38] in 54
[40:40] 515 paragraph 233
[40:42] you see what the mark of the beast is
[40:45] it's a mark of apostasy
[40:48] it's a person now here's his definition
[40:51] we may look it up and find apostasy
[40:53] here's his definition right
[40:56] it's a person who is just think that
[40:59] well i belong to church
[41:01] i'm just as good as the next fellow
[41:05] am not i belonging to this church and
[41:08] you realize where your church
[41:09] organization that you're dependent on
[41:11] where it come from don't you realize
[41:13] the bible said he's that worships the
[41:15] beast
[41:17] receives his mark or the letter of his
[41:20] name and watch
[41:22] in the forehead or hand
[41:25] he said that's knowledge or deed
[41:29] right
[41:30] now watch him
[41:32] that don't mean you've got a big tattoo
[41:34] on your face
[41:36] it don't have to be that it's not
[41:38] talking to the outward
[41:40] it's talking of spiritual
[41:43] now
[41:45] you watch him and see what he knows
[41:46] about the scripture listen to him and
[41:49] see where he goes to
[41:51] if any man don't have this doctrine
[41:53] there's no light on him the bible says
[41:56] watch where it goes to
[41:58] what's what he does because what will we
[42:00] do what did cain do
[42:03] when abel presented the truth to cain
[42:09] cain believed he was right
[42:13] and he was so right about it until he
[42:15] killed his brother
[42:18] isn't that enough
[42:21] i mean you know
[42:24] i mean i i differ with brother
[42:26] you know brother mark he differs me and
[42:28] i just take a gun shoot him
[42:31] let's go and i'm standing for the truth
[42:33] no i'm a murderer
[42:36] what is he going to make me
[42:41] yeah well bless god i'm standing for the
[42:43] truth no
[42:48] you see church where we could be
[42:53] we except right here in lula georgia
[42:57] and how the mark of the beast
[43:01] because it's in our forehead and our
[43:02] hand it's in our knowledge it says on
[43:04] their forehead or in the forehead
[43:08] what's in your forehead your
[43:09] intelligence your knowledge is the front
[43:11] part of your brain situation
[43:14] go look it up
[43:16] you know
[43:18] and it's that knowledge that you have
[43:23] why does people get upset with you when
[43:24] you try to tell them the truth
[43:27] you know
[43:28] i mean why
[43:33] but remember now
[43:37] let's just get that scripture up go
[43:38] number 10
[43:39] and let's read that in revelation 13 16.
[43:43] because remember the scripture's got the
[43:44] answer
[43:46] and he calls us all both small and great
[43:48] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[43:50] mark in their right hand
[43:52] are in their foreheads
[43:55] and that no man might buy or sell save
[43:57] he that had to mark
[43:59] listen
[44:01] or the name of the beast
[44:04] now
[44:07] you're getting the point
[44:09] of here it talks about in their
[44:11] foreheads
[44:13] all right
[44:15] now he's saying
[44:17] what
[44:19] that no man might by ourselves say he
[44:21] that had the mark
[44:24] now where's the mark and what is it
[44:26] or the name of the beast
[44:33] the name of the beast well what do you
[44:34] mean it's beast
[44:39] does it say over on one of the church
[44:41] ages said you've got a name that you're
[44:42] living but you're dead
[44:47] why is it that everybody
[44:50] that you talk to
[44:53] now you you're going to say this right
[44:54] at least ninety percent of whatever
[44:57] you start talking i'm methodist i'm
[44:58] baptist i'm presbyterian
[45:04] is it not in the scripture where jesus
[45:06] was there in the
[45:08] gospels
[45:09] talking about how that they'll say
[45:12] let us take your name
[45:16] to take away our reproach
[45:20] you know approach for a woman to have a
[45:21] baby without having a husband that's a
[45:22] pretty good reproach
[45:24] and of course nowadays it's kind of
[45:26] accepted but we're not talking about
[45:27] that we're talking about christianity
[45:30] but what about these women are wanting
[45:34] the name of god
[45:38] and what would be the name of god in
[45:39] that age or that time or that period it
[45:41] wouldn't be jesus
[45:43] or even if it wasn't had the wrong idea
[45:45] about it where would it work see there's
[45:46] a name goes with this beast
[45:51] a name goes with it
[45:53] why because his name goes with
[45:55] christianity jesus
[46:00] so then what is his name
[46:07] or
[46:08] the number of his name
[46:12] now the number of his name
[46:17] what is the number of his name
[46:19] see here is wisdom let him that hath
[46:21] understanding count the number of the
[46:23] beast
[46:24] for it is the number of a man
[46:29] and his number is
[46:30] 603 and six
[46:35] now that's his name
[46:39] that's his name what
[46:41] hundred and sixty-six
[46:43] well now now brother dale
[46:45] we we we know better than that
[46:48] you know
[46:50] well
[46:51] to save reading a whole lot
[46:53] you know the story that brother branham
[46:55] gave and he said 666 and they asked him
[46:58] a question about it and he said i've
[47:00] been there and seen it said over the
[47:02] pope and rome is written
[47:04] vicarius philia idea
[47:08] and it says instead of god he said in
[47:10] every pope that ever was there or
[47:13] whatever is saying there instead of god
[47:15] now that's a quote if you want
[47:16] all right
[47:19] but he said
[47:21] break that down in roman numerals
[47:26] and said what would it be
[47:29] now i want you to hold on to something
[47:33] and then we'll pull up the 666 you know
[47:35] just show it
[47:37] but remember
[47:38] you got the name of the beast
[47:42] and the number of his name
[47:46] so there's going to be a connection
[47:49] between the name
[47:51] and the number my name may figure out to
[47:53] be 666. yours might do it too
[47:58] but remember
[48:01] as we'll get to the rest of the
[48:02] scriptures
[48:04] we don't sit on seven hills
[48:06] and rule the world
[48:08] and if i don't get to it he said
[48:09] cincinnati sits on seven hills but he
[48:11] said it has no control control of
[48:13] anything religiously
[48:16] he said that's only two places he knew
[48:18] of was rome hitler in cincinnati ohio
[48:20] all right but remember the number of the
[48:22] beasts and i know you've done this but
[48:24] we'll show it to the to the internet
[48:25] system so go ahead brother joe and pull
[48:27] that up
[48:29] and see that vicarious philly idea
[48:34] means instead of god
[48:36] all right so here he's got it simply
[48:38] made out
[48:39] v is one i i mean v is five eyes one c
[48:42] is a hundred all right get back on your
[48:44] a's you you leave out some of that you
[48:46] have to go through all of that to
[48:47] understand it but you come back to the v
[48:49] and the five and you come back to i and
[48:51] the l and some of the letters is not
[48:53] counted
[48:54] because that's in the way they figure
[48:57] but it figures out to be 666.
[49:02] and over it is instead of the son of god
[49:06] like i said you can say well brother
[49:08] dale your name sure my name might be 666
[49:11] if you want to figure it out
[49:15] but this person
[49:17] has got to be in control
[49:23] and the world has to come to his feet
[49:27] he can't buy or sell unless you got it
[49:30] you say well brother then what is these
[49:32] credit cards well that's might be part
[49:34] of it social security numbers that might
[49:36] be part of it
[49:39] there's going to be controlling systems
[49:40] there's going to be all kind of doings
[49:44] but the prophet of god said
[49:46] to this save time of reading
[49:49] he said that what it was
[49:52] was the trinitarian doctrine
[49:55] jump over to number 15 brother
[49:59] anderson
[50:03] the trinitarian doctrine
[50:07] why because it's in your forehead it's
[50:08] in your intelligence
[50:10] it's in your brain
[50:12] you know
[50:13] it's in your thinking
[50:15] we've been we've had it sung to us all
[50:17] our life until it's just normal well
[50:21] praise father son and holy god
[50:27] and we've heard it so much
[50:29] until this god in three persons
[50:33] june's mom one day and i'm throwing off
[50:35] an owner just like everybody else she
[50:37] just said it she said sound don't
[50:39] believe in the holy trinity
[50:41] well
[50:43] she was just saying what everybody i say
[50:44] it
[50:46] you know
[50:49] but go back with me of what i've
[50:51] tried to say at the beginning
[50:55] what happened to cain
[51:01] unbelief took over
[51:05] right
[51:06] he killed his brother a display of that
[51:08] unbelief an attribute
[51:12] he goes before god
[51:14] instead of in a repentant attitude and
[51:16] said lord i'm sorry i know i killed him
[51:18] or not i killed him
[51:20] no instead of that he's saying
[51:23] am i my brother's keeper
[51:25] in other words you
[51:27] you blaming me for what happened
[51:33] and if you probably listen to the whole
[51:34] story and say i said something to abel
[51:36] wouldn't that wouldn't that be about
[51:38] today you know i mean today nobody's
[51:40] guilty
[51:42] i mean they got 49 pictures of a guy
[51:44] blowing a man's brains out with a
[51:46] shotgun and his name tag on his shirt
[51:49] i'm not guilty
[51:52] you know
[51:54] well is that the way we are about the
[51:56] religious matters
[51:58] probably if you listen to cain you know
[52:00] and really what he was saying was before
[52:02] god he said what are you doing blaming
[52:04] me for it
[52:05] he rose up first
[52:08] he just wasn't there to watch it
[52:12] he rose up first i just killed him out
[52:14] of self-defense
[52:17] you see that's silly that's what i'm
[52:18] trying to make it as silly as i can
[52:20] because that's where we come to in
[52:21] ourselves
[52:24] well brother dale i've been in the
[52:25] message all of my life
[52:27] praise god but how long has the message
[52:29] been in you
[52:32] amen
[52:34] i was born and raised in this message
[52:36] praise god
[52:40] but how much of the message is in you
[52:41] and i
[52:43] right
[52:44] but look what he says here now we won't
[52:46] stay up on the top we'll run way down to
[52:48] the bottom because it'll save time
[52:50] the reading drop so run it up until we
[52:52] get what's marked you know
[52:55] all right
[52:57] he's talking about imperial rome and the
[52:59] different things of christianity but the
[53:01] main thing i want to come down to is
[53:05] this may seem far-fetched to some but
[53:08] actually it is very plain for all to see
[53:10] because right now the churches are
[53:13] controlling politics
[53:15] and at the opportune time will manifest
[53:19] exactly how great is that control
[53:22] this economical move will end up with
[53:25] rome at the head even though the people
[53:27] did not envision that in
[53:30] vision it that way
[53:32] this is so because in rome in revelation
[53:35] 17 3-6 it is stated that the mr
[53:38] babylon is seated on on the beast
[53:40] and she is controlling the lies their
[53:42] fourth empowered this roman church is
[53:44] doing that with the world church's
[53:46] system under her rome will con
[53:48] will be controlling and this
[53:51] image church system
[53:53] will be obedient to rome because rome
[53:56] controls the gold of the world
[54:00] thus all the people have to belong to
[54:02] the world church system or be at the
[54:04] mercy of the elements for they cannot
[54:06] buy or sell without the mark of the
[54:08] beast in their head or forehead or head
[54:11] now you say well brother dale oh we've
[54:14] got it on down here so don't worry about
[54:15] it we'll read it where he says it ain't
[54:17] all here yet okay so don't jump real
[54:19] quick with me
[54:22] we're not in the stages of where they're
[54:24] persecuting us to death
[54:28] come on
[54:31] but listen to him
[54:34] this mark in the head means that they
[54:37] will have to take the doctrine of the
[54:40] world church system
[54:42] which is trinitarianism
[54:47] and the mark in the hand which means to
[54:48] do the will
[54:50] of the world church
[54:54] all right
[54:56] with this great power the church systems
[54:59] will persecute
[55:00] the true bride
[55:05] this image will try to keep the bride
[55:07] from preaching and teaching and so forth
[55:09] her ministers will be forbidden to give
[55:11] comfort and truth to the people who need
[55:14] it
[55:15] but before the antichrist in person
[55:18] takes over
[55:20] this complete world system of churches
[55:23] the true church will be taken away from
[55:25] this world to be with the lord god will
[55:28] catch away his bride for the great
[55:31] marriage supper of the lamb no we don't
[55:33] go through the persecution we don't i
[55:34] mean don't go through the tribulation no
[55:36] we don't
[55:38] but what is the mark of the beast
[55:41] and where is it at
[55:45] the mark of the beast is in your
[55:46] forehead your intelligence your thinking
[55:50] and see why it's so hard to preach
[55:53] is because of what we've been taught
[55:58] i don't care where you ever went in the
[55:59] door of a church
[56:01] where you ever went and joined a church
[56:03] or went to a church
[56:06] if
[56:07] the prophet's right
[56:09] and the bible's right you either got the
[56:11] mark of the beast or the seal of god
[56:14] all right
[56:16] it don't matter where you ever went to a
[56:18] church you've got the same doctrine
[56:22] now
[56:24] i know this is going out on airways and
[56:26] people probably hear it and one of these
[56:28] days can use it but still it's the truth
[56:30] what's the difference in trinitarianism
[56:34] of the catholic church or trinitarianism
[56:36] of the baptist church
[56:38] methodist or whatever you know
[56:40] presbyterians pentecostals whatever
[56:42] lula eyes
[56:44] right
[56:45] what's the difference
[56:47] all right
[56:49] but now if you believe in
[56:51] trinitarianism means you're going to
[56:53] believe in many gods right
[56:55] coming from rome
[56:56] that had many gods
[56:59] well then you tell me that
[57:01] buddha hinduism
[57:02] islamics
[57:05] all of that is not in a trinitarian form
[57:08] many god's doctrine
[57:12] picaise said over there in india they
[57:13] had what was it three million gods and
[57:15] goddesses
[57:17] you know
[57:18] so the whole world
[57:21] now listen you catch what i'm saying
[57:23] about the mark of the beast then the
[57:25] whole world
[57:29] is in a trinitarian doctrine
[57:31] it don't matter whether they're muslim
[57:33] or whatever
[57:36] anything contrary to the truly revealed
[57:40] word
[57:42] is antichrist right
[57:44] we're not throwing off on people people
[57:46] are people we're people
[57:50] but the doctrine
[57:55] we love our families and things nobody
[57:57] hates their family i'm not i've said
[57:59] that over a while ago and the message
[58:01] you know
[58:02] we love our people
[58:05] we want to help them and do the best we
[58:06] can
[58:08] but if they don't want the truth what
[58:10] can we do
[58:12] we can't make them believe it
[58:17] but we can pray for them
[58:20] and just remember
[58:23] they've been taught that all of their
[58:24] life
[58:29] we've been taught all of our life as
[58:30] their right hand
[58:34] right
[58:35] we've been talk 12 inches a foot
[58:41] whose foot
[58:43] horses measured by hands whose hands
[58:46] i'd hate to try to get on a horse that
[58:48] was if it was 14 hands for i'm just
[58:50] getting it for a normal horse you know
[58:52] 14 hours i'd sure hate to try to get on
[58:54] a horse that brother our line measured
[58:57] that man had hands like that
[59:02] one hand on him would be two for mine
[59:05] see it's what we've been taught all of
[59:07] our lives
[59:11] we've been taught
[59:14] that
[59:16] it's got to be three gods
[59:20] he said yeah but now we've heard the
[59:21] message
[59:25] well how many in the message is
[59:26] preaching the truth of one god
[59:29] come on i'm not against nobody
[59:33] love everybody
[59:37] but the truth will separate us
[59:40] right
[59:43] but now i said i wanted to get that part
[59:45] out of the way about the mark of the
[59:46] beast
[59:49] it's unbelief
[59:51] to disbelieve god's word we're already
[59:53] marked
[59:57] see
[59:59] the truth will set you free
[1:00:02] all right
[1:00:03] but now listen
[1:00:07] the amazing part is what i've tried to
[1:00:09] explain to you
[1:00:12] god has to come through
[1:00:15] the same place
[1:00:18] because the greatest battle ever fought
[1:00:22] is fought in the mind of mankind
[1:00:26] right not fault in your heart or just
[1:00:29] it's fault in your brain
[1:00:36] but see satan comes in that brain
[1:00:40] but god has to use the same brain
[1:00:46] now
[1:00:49] you you believe what the prophet would
[1:00:51] say that
[1:00:53] if we're sealed in
[1:00:54] satan sealed out
[1:00:56] you agree with that
[1:00:59] if we're sealed in by the holy ghost
[1:01:00] satan's sealed out right
[1:01:02] because that's what the seal is
[1:01:04] all right
[1:01:06] but what about us being sealed
[1:01:11] no brother dale i got the holy ghost 40
[1:01:13] years ago blessed god you can't tell me
[1:01:14] i ain't sealed
[1:01:15] amen if you were sealed
[1:01:18] but if you wouldn't seal then that's the
[1:01:20] problem that's you got the trouble lying
[1:01:23] you reject the word don't you can't tell
[1:01:25] me the seal of god is dark
[1:01:28] god can't deny his own word
[1:01:31] so then where are we
[1:01:33] but what i want us to think about is not
[1:01:35] just the mark of the beast because come
[1:01:37] on we know the mark of the beast is
[1:01:39] unbelief
[1:01:43] it's not a stamp it's not a something
[1:01:45] like that
[1:01:48] it's the doctrines that have been talked
[1:01:50] to you and i
[1:01:53] that we swear by it
[1:01:56] come on may i quote brother branham he
[1:01:58] said i used to carry a baptist bible
[1:02:03] that's what he said
[1:02:04] and convert them to a baptist faith
[1:02:07] now you need that quote
[1:02:09] no not really random
[1:02:11] i was listening to him yesterday come
[1:02:13] find out wade was over on the other side
[1:02:15] reading anointing once the end time and
[1:02:17] i've been listening to it two days in a
[1:02:19] row and uh
[1:02:23] that
[1:02:24] anointing is the same
[1:02:29] you know
[1:02:31] it's not different from this person to
[1:02:33] that person
[1:02:35] the anointing of the holy ghost is the
[1:02:37] same
[1:02:38] it's whether or not you're born again is
[1:02:39] the difference
[1:02:41] if you're born again you're sealed in
[1:02:43] and satan is sealed out
[1:02:47] but what about the scripture there where
[1:02:49] it talks about being born again
[1:02:52] in other words after you're born again
[1:02:55] you're being born again
[1:03:00] you're being sealed in
[1:03:04] that's that's the point to me now watch
[1:03:06] what i'm getting at
[1:03:09] remember the name
[1:03:12] the mark
[1:03:15] it's a name it's a doctrine
[1:03:20] it's what somebody taught
[1:03:26] but god can only use the word as it's
[1:03:28] being taught
[1:03:32] that's the only way you can do
[1:03:34] that's why it's so important
[1:03:36] to hear the word
[1:03:40] for word that you and i can have an
[1:03:41] opportunity i at least want you to have
[1:03:44] an opportunity to be able to be saved
[1:03:48] i can't save you
[1:03:50] i wish i could we can't
[1:03:52] can't save my family my wife or whatever
[1:03:54] no but i want them to have an
[1:03:56] opportunity to at least hear the truth
[1:03:59] yes
[1:04:02] you know would you think you're the only
[1:04:03] one got it i didn't say that
[1:04:08] why are you saying it
[1:04:12] but think about now the mark of the
[1:04:14] beast and remember
[1:04:16] it's
[1:04:18] in your forehead
[1:04:20] and remember
[1:04:21] it's the number
[1:04:24] of a name
[1:04:28] all right
[1:04:33] and watch what we're getting to now
[1:04:34] let's go to revelations 20
[1:04:36] and 14 number 16. we'll try to get
[1:04:38] through
[1:04:40] and i saw thrones they that set upon
[1:04:42] them and judgment was given unto them
[1:04:44] and i saw the souls of them that were
[1:04:45] beheaded for the witness of jesus christ
[1:04:48] and for the word of god which had not
[1:04:50] worshiped the beast
[1:04:51] neither his image now who is this
[1:04:55] who is this the bride right
[1:04:58] do you need any more
[1:05:00] because you you want to end up right
[1:05:02] down here see if you doubt that being
[1:05:04] the bride because look at it
[1:05:06] which had not which did had not
[1:05:08] worshipped the beast neither his image
[1:05:10] neither had received his mark upon their
[1:05:12] foreheads or in their hands and they
[1:05:15] lived and reigned with christ a thousand
[1:05:16] years now that's the bride right
[1:05:21] now watch what she's doing
[1:05:23] she didn't receive his mark
[1:05:28] so she has don't have to worry about the
[1:05:29] works and the hands and things because
[1:05:32] she's not sealed by his doctrine
[1:05:34] she's not sealed away or marked
[1:05:38] she's going to rule and reign for him
[1:05:39] for a thousand years
[1:05:43] now watch the rest of it
[1:05:45] go on to the next we just got through
[1:05:46] reading this
[1:05:48] when we read verse 16.
[1:05:50] and cause all both small and great poor
[1:05:53] rich and poor
[1:05:55] to receive a mark in their right hand
[1:05:57] are in their foreheads
[1:06:01] now
[1:06:03] we've tried to cover that that mark is
[1:06:05] not a stamper etc
[1:06:07] it's a doctrine
[1:06:10] right
[1:06:12] it's what you believe
[1:06:14] cain believed his mama's doctrine
[1:06:17] and that's what put him out of the
[1:06:18] garden
[1:06:22] right
[1:06:24] cain believed it was blood abel believed
[1:06:26] it was fruit
[1:06:28] and he was put out because of the fact
[1:06:30] of
[1:06:31] what he believed
[1:06:33] now
[1:06:34] you know he's sealed away from god
[1:06:36] maybe i'll swap the names on that you
[1:06:38] put it where it's supposed to be
[1:06:40] okay
[1:06:42] but think about it
[1:06:46] go to revelations 14 1 and let's read
[1:06:49] something
[1:06:53] and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the
[1:06:55] mount sign
[1:06:56] and with him 144 thousand
[1:06:59] having his father's name
[1:07:02] written
[1:07:04] in their four heads
[1:07:07] now
[1:07:09] written in their foreheads
[1:07:14] that's not a mark of the beast
[1:07:16] right
[1:07:17] right
[1:07:19] that 144 000 receive the holy ghost here
[1:07:22] right
[1:07:24] am i right now where the prophet's
[1:07:25] message come on
[1:07:27] but having his father's name
[1:07:34] remember the other guy's what
[1:07:37] his name the number of his name and
[1:07:40] right
[1:07:42] now you got it having his father's name
[1:07:45] written in their foreheads
[1:07:54] it's in their knowledge right
[1:07:56] all right let's go to ezekiel 9 and 4.
[1:08:01] and the lord said unto him go through
[1:08:04] the midst of the city to the midst of
[1:08:06] jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[1:08:08] foreheads
[1:08:09] of the men that sign cry for the
[1:08:10] abomination
[1:08:12] that be done in the midst thereof
[1:08:16] set a mark on them
[1:08:22] remember the mark of the beast is your
[1:08:23] intelligence and it's your trinitarian
[1:08:25] doctrine so remember the truth would be
[1:08:27] what the name of jesus and the revealed
[1:08:30] word
[1:08:32] right
[1:08:35] go on to 7 4 and let's read
[1:08:38] 7 3 and 4
[1:08:41] saying hurt not the earth neither the
[1:08:42] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[1:08:45] the servants of our god in their
[1:08:47] foreheads
[1:08:52] oh that's 144 000 brother dale you don't
[1:08:54] understand that they're sealed in their
[1:08:56] foreheads we're still in our heart
[1:09:00] go to sleep
[1:09:02] and i heard the number of them which
[1:09:03] were sealed and they were sealed 144
[1:09:05] thousand
[1:09:12] sealed
[1:09:13] in your forehead
[1:09:19] the holy spirit's been doing something
[1:09:21] down through time that mankind never
[1:09:23] understood
[1:09:25] this prophet came with it and started
[1:09:26] bringing it to us
[1:09:30] and it's showing us the truth
[1:09:37] the new the new birth is the seal of god
[1:09:39] in your soul
[1:09:41] we believe that
[1:09:43] we believe 144 000 will receive that
[1:09:45] also
[1:09:50] all right but it won't make them bride
[1:09:51] but it does still make them
[1:09:53] they're going to be in the millennium
[1:09:55] what your prophet says
[1:10:00] but what about being sealed in our
[1:10:01] forehead
[1:10:05] now you can't start unless you seal in
[1:10:07] your soul first so don't even worry
[1:10:08] about it you know okay
[1:10:10] because you're already marked by the
[1:10:11] mark of the beast
[1:10:13] all right
[1:10:15] so think about it now
[1:10:18] let's just read a few quotes in a hurry
[1:10:22] look at number 21
[1:10:24] resort results of decision preaching 56
[1:10:27] 1008
[1:10:29] e38
[1:10:32] and i said the sabbath
[1:10:34] is the holy ghost you remember he's
[1:10:35] talking to a
[1:10:37] seventh-day adventist guy
[1:10:39] he said nonsense
[1:10:42] the sabbath is a day i said it was at
[1:10:45] one time limited to a certain people but
[1:10:47] today the sabbath is the baptism of the
[1:10:49] holy ghost that's right he said oh it
[1:10:51] can't be
[1:10:52] why
[1:10:53] he said god gave the day and sealed it
[1:10:55] with a memorial that it was a day
[1:10:58] keeping
[1:11:00] what
[1:11:01] i said for our people
[1:11:03] but today ephesians 4 30 said
[1:11:06] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:11:07] whereby you're sealed until still till
[1:11:10] the day of your redemption see no day
[1:11:12] right
[1:11:13] holy ghost is the seal of god that'll be
[1:11:15] upon the forehead
[1:11:20] watch him
[1:11:21] or the knowledge
[1:11:26] in the hand
[1:11:28] what's in the hand
[1:11:29] the works of every person that's took
[1:11:31] him to the kingdom of god
[1:11:33] will be baptized with the holy ghost
[1:11:35] seal of god in this last days is a
[1:11:37] distinction a mark that will be put up
[1:11:39] on the people
[1:11:40] which we had about a week's revival on
[1:11:43] it
[1:11:45] put on the forehead
[1:11:47] on your knowledge
[1:11:50] look at the next one the oneness of
[1:11:52] unity preached in 1956 58 128
[1:11:58] page 19.
[1:12:00] he says your prophet is taught your
[1:12:02] pastors have taught you but then he's
[1:12:03] getting down to what
[1:12:06] what's the seal of god brother branham
[1:12:08] the holy ghost
[1:12:10] you say is that scriptural absolutely
[1:12:12] many of them let me just give you one so
[1:12:14] you won't forget it ephesians 4 30 said
[1:12:17] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:12:18] whereby you're sealed till the day of
[1:12:21] your redemption
[1:12:22] there is the seal of god that's what i'm
[1:12:24] trying to tell you
[1:12:26] you've looked for the seal of god to
[1:12:28] come in the last days
[1:12:31] not on your forehead
[1:12:33] and watch him
[1:12:35] sounds like he's
[1:12:36] turning away but watch it
[1:12:39] saying it was on your forehead is your
[1:12:41] knowledge to understand
[1:12:47] but the bible said the seal of god is
[1:12:48] the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:12:50] everybody that has it their hearts are
[1:12:52] free
[1:12:53] they're sealed by the knowledge of god
[1:12:56] in their forehead
[1:13:01] that they'll do that they do know that
[1:13:04] jesus is dead and raised again because
[1:13:07] they can see him
[1:13:08] that's what you're sealed with right
[1:13:11] look at the next one
[1:13:14] united under one headship
[1:13:16] 1958 326
[1:13:18] e34
[1:13:20] and what happened you can't stand
[1:13:22] neutral
[1:13:23] you got to be filled with something to
[1:13:25] survive notice you might be filled with
[1:13:27] one thing over another you say
[1:13:31] brother branham i'm kind of on the fence
[1:13:33] no
[1:13:34] you're not
[1:13:36] the bible plainly says that all that was
[1:13:38] not sealed with the holy ghost received
[1:13:40] the mark of the beast all that didn't
[1:13:43] have the seal of god in their forehead
[1:13:47] had the mark of the beast
[1:13:50] he doesn't have any problem talking
[1:13:51] about the forehead does he
[1:13:55] come on
[1:13:58] so all that didn't have the seal of god
[1:13:59] in their foreheads had to mark the beast
[1:14:01] you got to be one of it now
[1:14:04] i'd like to
[1:14:06] like to test it just a little bit and
[1:14:07] see where you're standing them the mark
[1:14:09] of the beast remember is a religious
[1:14:11] mark
[1:14:12] certainly it is and you're you might be
[1:14:14] filled with religion you can have all
[1:14:17] kind of religion that doesn't save you
[1:14:19] at all you can just be a religious
[1:14:21] fanatic if you want to touch not taste
[1:14:24] not handle not smell not that don't have
[1:14:26] one thing to do
[1:14:28] with the holy spirit holy ghost
[1:14:31] okay look at the next one i have two
[1:14:33] more will three
[1:14:35] this is taken from the ten virgins 144
[1:14:37] thousand nineteen sixty twelve
[1:14:39] eleven
[1:14:41] paragraph 250
[1:14:43] all right we all know that the seal of
[1:14:45] god is the holy spirit
[1:14:47] now that's found you take revelations 9
[1:14:50] 9 1 to 4.
[1:14:52] you'll find that they all that had to
[1:14:54] seal in their forehead
[1:14:56] first corinthians
[1:15:00] 1 22 paul said whereby he seals us by
[1:15:03] his holy spirit until the day of
[1:15:05] redemption ephesians 4 30 says grieve
[1:15:07] not the holy spirit
[1:15:09] and that's the angel that comes forth
[1:15:11] sealing
[1:15:13] upon their forehead
[1:15:16] now that doesn't mean and you think put
[1:15:18] a spot up there your forehead is your
[1:15:20] revelation
[1:15:22] see and your hand is the thing you do
[1:15:25] about it
[1:15:27] it's a spiritual mark so you don't take
[1:15:29] a big stamp and stamp you like that oh
[1:15:32] no it sounds like he's talking about the
[1:15:34] mark of the beast doesn't it but he's
[1:15:35] not he's just told you what he's talking
[1:15:37] about
[1:15:38] the seal of god
[1:15:39] in your revelation
[1:15:41] all right
[1:15:43] one more
[1:15:46] ordination 1962 1104 in the evening's
[1:15:48] earth and remember this morning's lesson
[1:15:53] these virtues has to be in there before
[1:15:56] the capstone will ever come on it
[1:15:58] oh you might shout you might sing you
[1:16:00] might speak with tongues and dance
[1:16:02] it has nothing at all to do with it
[1:16:04] until these things
[1:16:07] scripturally proven and sealed into you
[1:16:10] the holy spirit seals you in as an
[1:16:13] individual
[1:16:14] than your son
[1:16:17] and daughter
[1:16:18] all right
[1:16:21] read adoption
[1:16:25] we could come and bring all of it but
[1:16:27] you ought to know it
[1:16:29] brother random on the statue i've got it
[1:16:31] in here when i won't read this
[1:16:32] blasphemous name he says you're sealed
[1:16:34] into this you're sealed into this you're
[1:16:35] sealed into this
[1:16:38] but but brother dale i thought i sealed
[1:16:39] with the baptism in the holy ghost
[1:16:40] that's right and then when
[1:16:42] virtue comes on that it's sealed in
[1:16:45] when knowledge comes on it it's sealed
[1:16:47] in so we're being born again
[1:16:51] we're being sealed
[1:16:53] and the lies that comes the reason i
[1:16:55] read that is what the capstone
[1:16:59] the capstone comes and seals the
[1:17:01] individual
[1:17:03] just like the ages
[1:17:06] he seals your word
[1:17:09] in your forehead
[1:17:12] right
[1:17:13] what is the headstone
[1:17:16] sealed into these things
[1:17:19] each one sealing us in
[1:17:23] until the holy ghost comes
[1:17:25] himself
[1:17:26] the headstone of it all jesus christ has
[1:17:28] sealed us into the kingdom
[1:17:30] read blasphemous names if you need a lot
[1:17:32] to understand
[1:17:36] sealed in your forehead
[1:17:38] but brother dale i thought we were
[1:17:39] sealed in our heart our soul
[1:17:42] well that's right
[1:17:44] but god's been doing something
[1:17:49] he's sealing in his people
[1:17:52] then you've got adoption
[1:17:57] you've got the head seal the headstone
[1:17:59] all of those messages adoptions and all
[1:18:02] of the things that he went through hear
[1:18:03] ye him all of the things
[1:18:06] statue of a perfect man
[1:18:09] sealing us in
[1:18:11] our forehead
[1:18:14] we read where the prophet said that's
[1:18:15] your knowledge
[1:18:17] he said that's your revelation
[1:18:23] see we're not sealed just because we're
[1:18:25] good people
[1:18:29] we're sealed because of the holy spirit
[1:18:32] that is teaching us the word
[1:18:36] and as i said while ago then we believe
[1:18:38] in when we're sealed in he's sealed out
[1:18:41] right
[1:18:43] now i want to ask you a simple question
[1:18:46] what do you think
[1:18:49] we've been around here 40-something
[1:18:50] years since the prophet was gone and he
[1:18:52] had 30-something years preaching it
[1:18:55] but
[1:18:56] what's going to bring the rapture
[1:18:59] you know the change
[1:19:01] well one of these days california is
[1:19:02] going under that don't brian
[1:19:05] amen done proved it to you we can be
[1:19:06] here after california goes under
[1:19:13] well i didn't believe that well
[1:19:17] it's all right
[1:19:22] but you realize what's happening to you
[1:19:24] and i as the word is being revealed to
[1:19:26] us
[1:19:30] a revelation is what i'm talking about
[1:19:34] see a revelation seals you in
[1:19:38] but it also seals the devil out
[1:19:41] what do you think is going to bring a
[1:19:43] rapture
[1:19:46] i've always tried to preach the statue
[1:19:47] of a perfect man maybe a little
[1:19:49] different than
[1:19:50] what a lot of people thinks about it
[1:19:51] because i had a good teacher
[1:19:53] remote
[1:19:55] 1971 it took him
[1:19:58] months to preach it
[1:20:00] but i asked him a simple question when
[1:20:02] he got through i said brother mo i
[1:20:03] believe every bit what you said
[1:20:05] i want to know how to get them virtuous
[1:20:08] because i know we got to have them
[1:20:11] it's in the statue of prayer event
[1:20:12] richard said the first time he seen it
[1:20:15] brother and i said this is a requirement
[1:20:21] why is it the rapture hasn't come
[1:20:27] it's because the people won't stand
[1:20:29] still long enough for god to see them
[1:20:33] but you're sealed by revelation
[1:20:39] right
[1:20:40] i thought the holy ghost was a
[1:20:41] revelation a new birth
[1:20:43] and that means you're sealed in but
[1:20:44] we're coming up the statue of a perfect
[1:20:46] man talking about that to bring us out
[1:20:49] to where the prophet said
[1:20:51] this what is it black feminist name
[1:20:53] urgent no yeah i'm pretty sure he said
[1:20:55] her
[1:20:56] stature perfect and blasphemous 91 he
[1:20:58] said this is the church
[1:21:00] that will be brought up through the ages
[1:21:02] to go into the rapture he said this is
[1:21:04] the individual that will be brought up
[1:21:06] through these things
[1:21:09] what do you think i've screamed and
[1:21:11] hollered and tried my best to just
[1:21:12] preach to you
[1:21:16] because you're only sealed by the word
[1:21:21] if you want to go through a lot of
[1:21:22] things and think about it go in and
[1:21:24] think about it
[1:21:26] the antichrist has a name
[1:21:28] he has a mark
[1:21:31] he has a seal
[1:21:32] the holy ghost has a mark he has a name
[1:21:35] and he has a seal his name is jesus
[1:21:39] we're sealed in by the revelation and as
[1:21:42] we're being sealed in satan's being
[1:21:43] sealed out
[1:21:45] well brother dale it don't look like it
[1:21:48] i want to know when you ever got that
[1:21:50] idea
[1:21:51] or where'd you get it from
[1:21:55] well i just don't see it well
[1:21:58] evidently
[1:22:00] you ain't got it
[1:22:03] because if you had it you would see it
[1:22:08] right
[1:22:11] come on see i don't mind talking like
[1:22:12] that
[1:22:14] i ain't gaining no friends or losing
[1:22:16] none because don't have none
[1:22:18] i'm not worried about it
[1:22:21] but is he sealing us in sister gail
[1:22:24] he's sealing satan out
[1:22:27] we just don't realize what's taking
[1:22:28] place
[1:22:30] because it's being so quiet and simple
[1:22:33] right around said god draws billions of
[1:22:35] gallons of water out of the ocean every
[1:22:37] day and takes them up and said not one
[1:22:39] sound
[1:22:43] but you see like brother claude was
[1:22:45] bringing sunday
[1:22:47] when the time comes
[1:22:49] you're going to see who sealed him and
[1:22:51] who's sealed out
[1:22:56] that's why i preached to you many many
[1:22:57] years ago
[1:23:00] i said a lot of people in this message
[1:23:02] and maybe i'm one of them will not be
[1:23:04] able to stand there and take that change
[1:23:07] so they're going to go by the grave
[1:23:11] we've seen a lot of that
[1:23:13] young and old
[1:23:15] i'm not decreasing anybody
[1:23:19] only those who know their god
[1:23:22] will be able to stand there
[1:23:26] and know that they're sealed in
[1:23:30] now
[1:23:31] satan could hinder jesus right
[1:23:35] no problem right he could hinder him and
[1:23:36] cause a lot of problems right
[1:23:38] but don't you believe he was sealed in
[1:23:44] and satan couldn't get to him unless god
[1:23:46] allowed it
[1:23:51] and he just said no satan's coming that
[1:23:53] ain't got nothing in me
[1:23:56] well you know what i wish i could say
[1:23:57] that
[1:24:00] i see a revelation is a very simple
[1:24:02] thing
[1:24:04] is god's revealed truth
[1:24:07] to you and i
[1:24:10] about himself
[1:24:13] that adoption is not god going off the
[1:24:16] scene and you and i coming on the scene
[1:24:17] that's what i've heard ever since i've
[1:24:19] been in the message
[1:24:21] it's not that away
[1:24:22] it's you and i going off the scene and
[1:24:24] god coming on the scene in you and i
[1:24:27] that's right
[1:24:29] as we yield ourself
[1:24:33] what about a prophet could make this
[1:24:34] statement he said i laid so close to god
[1:24:38] until i forced the gift to operate
[1:24:42] you want the quote
[1:24:45] what about a man that could lay so close
[1:24:47] to god
[1:24:54] you see church we've been sealed right
[1:24:56] now in our foreheads
[1:24:58] by our revelation
[1:25:00] because it's sealing those virtues into
[1:25:02] us
[1:25:03] by the opening of the word
[1:25:06] so the mark of the beast
[1:25:08] sure we all had that
[1:25:12] but then we start by the new birth and
[1:25:13] you know what
[1:25:15] the old mark of the beast is still
[1:25:16] working up through the head
[1:25:18] right
[1:25:22] come on
[1:25:23] everybody didn't get brother brown's
[1:25:25] message right but he said did he say
[1:25:27] they weren't born again
[1:25:29] come on no he said they had the new
[1:25:31] birth
[1:25:33] it only meant for a special people
[1:25:36] to catch that word
[1:25:39] and to believe it and walk into it
[1:25:42] until he can seal out satan
[1:25:44] every time he reveals something to me
[1:25:46] brother gary it sealed that old devil
[1:25:48] out of me
[1:25:51] it's just got to keep climbing
[1:25:55] you mean they could come now and
[1:25:56] convince you there's a trinity you know
[1:25:58] what they call that what's that word
[1:25:59] deprogram you
[1:26:01] you mean they could take you in right
[1:26:02] now and deprogram you
[1:26:05] well it means you didn't have it
[1:26:10] because the seal of god can't be
[1:26:12] de-programmed
[1:26:16] think on these things come ahead
[1:26:17] musicians
[1:26:18] think on these things
[1:26:23] the seal of god
[1:26:25] coming forth in our forehead
[1:26:27] as we receive the word what did the
[1:26:30] prophet say we become the word
[1:26:36] when the little bride is sealed in
[1:26:39] satan's sealed out
[1:26:41] when he's sealed out
[1:26:44] rapture can come
[1:26:50] back on these things let's stand
[1:26:53] think on these things and just let's see
[1:26:55] what do we got brother

[1:29:49] unto you and i
[1:29:52] and he promised it to his children right
