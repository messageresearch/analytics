========================================

so last time we were I think we were at Genesis 4 verse 7. but I'm gonna hop back to Genesis 4 verse 6. before I I I don't think we were at first Cinema we were at the first where uh we were talking about what Abel said to Kane let's go back to verse six which says in the Lord said unto Cain wire thouroth and why is that counting Us Falling if thou do us well shall thou not be accepted and the founder was not well send life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him I want to spend a little time talking about that because I think it's plain to me to see that God gave Cain a promise that if he would do like Abel he would be accepted and um when I was seeking the Holy Ghost Satan came to me and uh he told me first the first thing he started off with was there's no God and that was the first the first problem they presented to me so after I overcame that hurdle then he the next thing that he told me was well you've gone too far and you've glassed him the Holy Ghost you've uh you've crossed the line but we knew the sign of crossing the line is the desire and uh if you have a desire then there's something to fill at his eye in it you can you can come and receive it if you can believe it you can receive it and uh the next thing he told me after I had overcome those two hurdles was what if you are descended from Cain from the lineage of Cain so there's got to be a Bible answer so that's why I want what I want to talk about and we know uh Titus 3-9 Paul warns us to avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contention since Friday is about the lawful they are unprofitable in vain and then these are just what good would it do if you could if you could go all the way back and prove that Adam was your ancestor because all of the children of Israel out of all of them only Joshua and cable believed that's right and we're going to look at Kayla and to find something interesting about him in a minute but uh in Romans 9 8 it says that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the sea so uh let's just for that point sake of argument let's strip away everything else AAA uh take a look at the moment in your life when there's nothing else but your genealogy and that's before you reach the age of accountability so let's see what brother Brown said about that and there's the teaching that says this is an enticing experience paragraph 12 and there's the teaching that says if the baby's born of a Holy Ghost parents well the baby will go to heaven but if it isn't it there's no more to it the baby is just no more that's strictly an error what difference does it make whether it's the Holy Ghost parent it's all sexual desire and the baby's born the same way so it's all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the scriptural terms of it so in and then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses and makes an atonement for that job if it dies he perfectly goes right into the presence of God and if it was born from the most sinful parents in the world until it's the age of accountability where it knows right and wrong and then what it does from then it's got to be forgiven for that it's got to ask his own opinion from then on but while it's a baby and then marriage and divorce he says in paragraph 60 you could take that onerous woman in the town the worst man if they had a baby it would have to come from the Lord because God has a law set together and these laws like the sun to raise you put a cockerborough in a good field it'll grow and it has to grow because it's God God's law when seed is planted it must grow when nothing can grow life of God because it operates under his laws therefore when the evil seed was planted in the womb of Eve it had to bring forth because it's God's law and production and it could do nothing else but bring it and it had to come from God that's the reason that people say little babies sometimes it's not born with Christian parents are lost Jesus Christ blood atones for the child I don't care how much it was born and how evil it was born he is the Lamb of God it takes away the sin of the world the little child cannot repent because it has nothing to repent for and that was the sin of the world which was taken away by the blood of Christ babies go to heaven no matter where your answers what your ancestry is and and I don't have this quote brother Benham talked about how after after the baby the child reaches the age of accountability the reason they don't come straight to Christ is because Satan is right there to put things in their mind and and interfere with them coming to God let me just read another quote it shall be even as it was told me I'll say this by the authority of God's word every baby that's under the age of accountability dies it goes to glory yes sir Christ died to take away the sin of the world and when you come to the age of accountability we are all born in sin and when he died he taken away the sin and when you come to the age of accountability then you're responsible from then on see it isn't you're not responsible for something you did not do crossed and died to save you to take away the sin that Adam calls but when you're sin you have to confess your sins first you have to confess it but the baby's done no sin if it if it's not accountable for what it does and Christ died to free that baby and if it's one of a parent drunkard or whatever they might be that baby goes to heaven I believe it and I believe it'll come to recognition of the Cross when it gets there to know that Christ died for me I believe that yes sir now this is the scripture the lord gave me when I was battling the devil and uh it's the scripture in uh it's the same one in Luke Luke chapter 3 and verse 7 and 8 and Matthew chapter 3 verse seven and eight I think it's interesting that's exact same chapter and verse but then said in Luke chapter 3 verse 7 and 8 then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized with him old Generation of Vipers who informed you to flee from the Wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance I begin not to say within yourself we have Abraham to our father for I say unto you that God is able to eat stones to raise up children unto Abraham and we know brother when brother Brandon talks about he talks about how if if you won't believe it he'll if the children of Abraham won't believe it he'll raise up somebody to believe it the stones don't have any life and we're you know uh I I I wish I had brought some quotes about her brother Brandon said about the Anglo-Saxon how Anglo-Saxons that's what we are the the white people come from Europe we have no lineage or uh nothing to post to God hiding himself in Simplicity he was talking about the time when the little opossum came to be healed and he said God's evil will be stones to race children of Abraham because I was able to heal Apostle or a fish or anything if he'll bring his message forth and the people won't believe it God can raise up an apostle to believe it Hallelujah God can raise a dead fish you can raise a dead opossum he can do anything he wants to do you know we were trying to trap a bobcat in our backyard and we ended up trapping an impossible and if you ever been up close them upon some of those nasty things you know I'm just I'm thankful I don't know why he saved me but I'm thankful that okay we don't have any lineage or anything to boost up but he calls and saved us the guys uh let's read Exodus chapter 12 verse 47 and to 49. and this is God's promise to the strength Exodus chapter 12 47-49. okay he's talking about the um the Passover verse 48 and when a stranger uh 47 all the congregation of Israel should keep it When a Stranger with he and we'll keep the Passover to the Lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be the one that is born in the land for no uncircumcised people should person shall eat their uh one law shall be to him that is home born and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you so the stranger that comes and takes the Passover is just like someone that's born in the land Isaiah 56. Isaiah 56 verse 3. neither let the son of the stranger that had joined himself to the Lord's speech saying the Lord hath utterly separated me from his people there's no reason for you to say that the Lord hath others has separated me from his people if you've joined yourself to the Lord neither let the eunuch say behold I'm a dry tree well let's see if the Lord unto the units to keep my Sabbath and choose the things that please me and take hold of my Covenant even of them unto them will I give in my house and within my walls police in a name better than a Sons and Daughters I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the Lord to serve him and to love the name of the Lord to be his servants everyone that keepeth the Sabbath for polluting it and taketh hold of my Covenant even then will I bring to my Holy Mountain and make them joyful In My House of Prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar from my house shall be called in House of Prayer for all people now now let's take a look we know that uh when the children of Israel came to qadesh Barnett everyone uh everyone agreed that there was no way that they could take the land of the promises who God were not true except for two men Joshua and Caleb and I believe it was copper Caleb that represented the Bible they they say whoever to represent the tribe of Judah I believe that's right um so let's take a second to look at Caleb and see what his genealogy looked like in Genesis 15 18 19 God uh I'm going to be reading a lot of scriptures so if y'all built on what we do okay yes hey that's okay you okay in the same day this is God's promise to Abraham that in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates the kinites and the Kennedy's and the cabinets we'll just stop right there remember the kennesaws because God is saying you're gonna you're gonna be conquerors of these people the numbers 14 6. numbers 14 6. you know Ben you can finish next time I'm open on Netflix how are you really thinking I'll be at Dutch College next week and uh number 14 6 and Joshua the son of none but then Caleb the son of jafuna which one of them that search the land rent their clothes the son of jafana who is this number 32 verse 12. save and Joshua the son of nun for they have holy followed the Lord they have Holy Father the Lord that's uh numbers 32 verse 22. so Caleb the son of jafana the Kennedy now uh First Chronicles 4 does not where it lists don't turn there but at least the ancestry of jafuna and Caleb but it's broken it doesn't tell the whole story somewhere along the line he came from someone called uh he was born of jafana called uh from from who was a Kennedy uh now a lot of people if you read what they say about the Kinesis they uh connect them with Esau's grandson canaz who was one of his 12 to 12 uh Lords of Edom and they they connect that I I can't find anywhere to connect that but we know that calo's ancestry is it doesn't have a direct line background anyone everyone impressive let's drive that way but and uh Deuteronomy 135 36. Deuteronomy chapter one one verse 35 and 36. then we get God's promise which is surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which I swear to give unto your father save Caleb and Son of father he shall see it that's him will I give the land that he hath trotted upon and to his children because he hath holy followed the Lord not because of his ancestry or anything he had to boast of who calls he hath holy followed the Lord now Rahab everybody's familiar with the scripture where the Canaanites came from and Genesis 9 25 I said cursed be Canaan a servant of servant shall he be unto his brother right and we were talking last time about how Rahab saw all the children of Israel coming through and she uh saw the pillar of fire and the Ark of the Covenant and signs with the signs and wonders in their midst and she knew that these people had something that she wanted and this is her testimony and Joshua Joshua the second chapter verses 9 to 13. and she said unto the men I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your Terror has fallen upon us at that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of Jordan cyphon and all whom he utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts didn't melt neither did they remain any more courage than any man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in Earth beneath she knew that was God now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I showed you kindness that you will also show kindness into my father's house and give me a true token and that you'll save me alive save a lie of my father and my mother and my brother and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives and death so Rahab now think about this all of the Canaanites perished and they had a mandate from God the Israelites did to go into the land and destroy all the Canaanites the walls from Jericho came down around her but she was the only one saved not just out of Jericho but out of the whole land because she looked and she said that those people have something that I want not because of her genealogy but because she believed but watch watch how God injected her into the genealogy because look at who she and the Israeli General produced exactly I know because David come from that woman exactly I'm getting there right yeah yeah and uh so all right so Rahab married a man in uh Joshua's Army named salmon and they had a little boy named Boaz yep and we'll get into that let's turn to Deuteronomy 23 verse 3. now up to this point we don't have any scripture that says because geniality you can't come into the congregation of the Lord but now we do Deuteronomy 23 3. and ammonite or moabite shall not enter into the congregation even to their 10th Generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the Lord forever well that presents the problem because our roof is a robot now a lot of people if you look at what Scholars and whatnot say that the congregation of the Lord they say that that's just uh like a Judicial part of the uh part of Israel and um that only men can be part of it and whatnot let's see what brother Randolph said about the congregation of the Lord and if you go up to uh could you read the verse try before that verse one dude uh the second verse that talks about a bachelor born child a bastard shot enter into the congregation of the Lord even to his 10th Generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the Lord let's see what brother REM said about that uh it wasn't so from the beginning e48 and hybriding was such a horrible thing in the Old Testament he said a bastard child shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord for 10 Generations there's nothing to breed him out only that sin think 10 Generations 400 years before legitimate child could ever come into the kingdom of God there was no serum to take care of him he had to just breed it out through the family 400 years for an element child could come into the congregation of the lord well I got to make sure I read this part but today says the blood of the Jesus Christ has been shed and you've been interbred by all different kinds of ideas the holy spirit is here this morning to read you back to the original bring you back to Pentecost bring you back and we sit together this morning in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus letting the Holy Spirit work what does circumcising cutting off all the hybrid the Surplus the things of the world the things of the church age bringing us back to Pentecost like it was at the beginning praise the Lord amen now let's uh look at Ruth's confession Ruth chapter 1 verse 15 to 18. what was the sermon that was from that was from uh it wasn't so from the beginning that's also in the 10 verses in the 144 000 Jews paragraph 41 I didn't read that thank you Ruth chapter 1 verse 15 18. foreign this is like the whole uh Genesis 4 story all over again you've got someone that's going to believe and someone that won't believe even though they could see the truth right in front of them and unto her God's return now after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said and treat me not to leave you'll return from following after thee for withered thou go a star will go and where thou largest hour Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God no that's it where thou dice will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if off but death death party in me when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her and then she left speaking under her and now think back to the scripture I read in Exodus about all right and you come in and take communion you are as one born in the land and the Ruth made her confession that your people will be my people so she's counted as one of the Israelites and uh you say well wait Boaz has to Redeemer everything but Ruth chapter 2 verse 11 and 12. and Boaz answered it has fully been shown me all that thou has done unto my mother thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how Halal has left thy father and thy mother in the land of the Nativity and not coming to a people which I knew is not here before the Lord recompense thy Work and a full reward beginning of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings thou I come to trust and come to trust the Lord and uh you know think about you know brother Branham talked about his mobile preachers because they they're still in Moab they're still part of that they're uh if you think about are you what's your nationality are you still an American are you still aware of you came from my wife came from Romania is she still Romanian let's see what brother Randall said about that did you ever chase that word down he didn't believeth on me has everyone has eternal life if you'll take that out of the Greek it's the word Zoe which means God's own life and you you are no longer yourself but you're a child of God here a few weeks ago my wife sitting right there back there she and I was going to a grocery store to get some groceries and I was amazed to find one lady with a skirt on and I said maybe what about that she said what I'm asking you Bill said you come back from overseas you say they do this in France they do that in England they do this in another place is this what they do in America I said that's the spirit of me I said aren't we Americans I said no she said what are we German I said no what are we I said we are pilgrims and strainers I said that's the reason that American Spirit is on our women they don't do those things on our men they don't drink I'm Brethren and things like that the American Spirit drinks that's a national Spirit every nation is governed by the devil the Bible says so if Satan said these kingdoms are my I'll do with them whatever I want to now I wanted to talk quickly too just briefly about the Samaritans because the Samaritans are another people that have a horrible genealogy in the Jews actually to this day uh treat them very poorly uh at the Jews and during Jesus time were the Samaritans were almost like it was like a let me go back and talk a little bit about whether Samaritans came from the Samaritans came from the when the Syrian came and conquered uh some cities in Israel they uh sent a lot of their people to live in the in the cities that they had conquered and so over time it became a mixture like they became hybrids so they were parked Jews and part uh Assyrians and other other nations that lived there and so over time they still believed God they believed the same Jehovah that the Jews believed and kept many of the same beliefs but uh because of their miscellaneous the Jews just began to despise them and um at the time by the time of Jesus they were it was like a the early uh part of this the last century where in America where you know the blacks and the whites didn't talk to one another that was the same thing what's going on then like uh the woman at the well was a Samaritan when she came to Jesus she said it's not customary for a Jew to talk to a Samaritan because it was such a it was like a racial divide there's Samaritans were treated as dirty they don't have any kind of lineage with us so think about all the Samaritans when when they said Jesus tell us about what a neighbor is he kind of threw it back in their face now let me I'll tell you what a neighbor is and he told him the story of that good samaritan the the only leper of the ten lepers that were healed the remember only one return and it was a Samaritan so those think about that how that God it's just beautiful how the people that were despised he used them to show his grace amen and that's all I have on that I guess next time we'll move on to the next verse from Genesis of course and such the word pilgrim who are pilgrims appeal green is somebody who's left their country that has not arrived where they're going they're in the middle thank you we haven't arrived yet thank you
