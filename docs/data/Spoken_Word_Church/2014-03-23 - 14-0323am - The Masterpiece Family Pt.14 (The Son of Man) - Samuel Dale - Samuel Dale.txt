bless morning God bless let's see we're going to read from Psalm 38 verses 1 through 20 to 1 through 22 okay Psalm 38 oh Lord rebuke me not in thy wrath neither chasten me in their hot displeasure

and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy amen holy holy holy You Are Holy Holy Holy yes you're holy holy holy and I want to see amen and amen and amen then if you want to see him then you know what he's trying to get where you can see him because that's if you have a desire in your heart he's doing that wouldn't know what Moses said even after all the times that he'd met him and talked with him and everything else he said Lord I want to see you he said just go stand in that rock see then Christ will come to you if you'll just believe it amen amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Matthew 1 Matthew 16 and Luke 17 Matthew 16 Luke 17 remember brother Bob he's away preaching for the weekend over at Blue Ridge there for them or not you Blue Ridge I guess we call that Blue Ridge Church because it's always been that and I'll just remember that and I know that you've heard it so remember to pray for the prash family there in India cuz brother pash's wife passed away yesterday they thought it was a heart attack they don't know for sure but I talked with Samuel this morning and and and he uh said that that's what they believed it was but just remember the family oh that's you know the passing of his wife and everything she'd been sick we've been praying for her for quite a while but ask just one more to go on to to meet the Lord in glory and remember that all right remember Sister sah uh Robert she uh come through her operation and things fine and now is going way to recuperating getting back into shape so remember that and all I talked to brother Dale Roberts yesterday and he seemed to be real up so praise the Lord he said he was on the men and he was going to keep on going so that he said he could walk better said he still had a little limp but that'd be taken care of but then he still having a little problems with his hand but that'll also be taken care of the Lord will make him to be that all right and remember brother Claude weinger will be with us on the first Sunday in April and remember the Bible study will be the first Saturday in April and we're in Romans 1 to just start on it and kind of go through the scriptures and talk on them come and be with us but then we're going to have the uh get together on what the 12th of April so remember that and uh you know that the Lord would be with us and that's make sure you sign up downstairs to come in because we got to know how much to cook brother it's on the refrigerator brother Al uh he's always gracious to make us some good old chili so we'll we'll get him the meat and everything and we really appreciate that but anything you want to bring you know we don't just limit you to it but we have hot dogs and stuff you know and all anything you want to bring especially in the line of sweets you know how we are we uh we we we love our sweets so uh if you want to do that's fine but make sure now cuz it'll still be cool make sure you bring kids a coat bring you a coat and a hat you know for the kids or boys and things and bring kids bring your gloves and bats and balls and everything we get together and we have a good time playing and doing that okay remember that before you're seated I want to read what and I I'll give it to the brother uh Brother Anderson if you'll pull it up I made a statement Wednesday night and I said I'll read it Sunday morning because I didn't have it I made it a little offline but it's close uh statue of perfect man paragraph 400 and run on up to 400 because you can get what he's talking about the Catholic Church running everything and how that the the world is on a gold standard and the church owns the the Catholic Church owns the gold of the world and and all like that and look what he says and throw her right back on the gold standard you people just keep your homes and things but you belong to the Catholic church now I said take the mark of the beast or something like that but to me it'd be the same thing but that's still not what he said so I'm making sure to correct he said this the nation belongs to the Catholic Church the whole thing is captured right in like that through their currency don't the Bible speak of that that's the picture that the Bible draws out so I wanted to give you that you say well what does that mean uh what he he said that uh you know you can say well do I need to get rid of my house well he he didn't get rid of his you know he lived in a house and and uh he said one time he said if you knew what your something paraphrasing it what you had in your pocket you take it out and burn it well you know what he didn't burn it right I mean he kept run on with his money in his pocket and and the things and and he knew but the main thing to me is is it comes down to a line and you got a choice that's right and it's going to be offered to us to join up with the World Church systems and we will refuse to join up with it and when we do we will lose all rights here we know that we just that's fine and I have no problems with it but it it'll come down to where that like he said you just keep your homes cuz everything's going to belong to the cathol cic church and that's that's the way it's got to be that's the Bible and no problem that's uh you know uh it's not we're not going to go out and sell our homes you know but that's you know you just uh he said if you're planting potatoes keep planting potatoes you know somebody need to eat the potatoes I've always said about my family they think I'm an idiot a nut crazy stupid and ugly but they know that I'm not totally dumb and I figure that the day comes we come up missing then they need some food they'll try to come to our home to find out something I just believe that you know because they know and realize what's going on and maybe that day their eyes will be open to see what we've tried to say to the world and the things but not to be so dogmatic that you can't do this or you can't do that you know it's not uh it's not that what all right so just that way and not trying to interpret that just give you what he said and and let it remain at that situation let's see if I got all the announcements out so make sure now that some of them last time uh we were sitting around a campfire and you didn't have no coats and things so if I was you I'd make sure and put in one you know and a hat and a scarf for your sisters you know and I don't mind you wearing a hat that day to keep your head warm you know cuz you need it that's just sensible but do that okay we're going into the scriptures in um Matthew 16 and then we'll go to Luke 177 Heavenly Father we thank you for this day in your grace unto us and your love unto us thank you for Calvary because the Earth where it was all made possible you made everything right for all of us you've given all of us an opportunity and we just ask you to guide us forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us Lord and whatever the day comes upon us we know that you will have us prepared for that day and we don't have to worry because we're resting in you we love you and we thank you Father bless us as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name Matthew 16 very familiar with all of us verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am you remember he always referred to himself as son of man because that was the dispensation right and they said some say th are John the Baptist some Elias and others jeremias are one of the prophets now when they say thou art John the Baptist uh that was writing see after John the Baptist had come the writings of the Bible was 50 years uh ad50 somewhere which would have been uh 17 years after uh this situation so it's not meaning that some say you're John the Baptist they was actually if you'd read it in originals and things you'd find out they were saying th art this one that was expected to come from Elijah you know in in the doings all right just to throw a little talk to it all right some Elias and others jeremias are one of the prophets and he sath unto them whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonas for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven who's who's the revealer only revealer of the word and I say unto thee that thou art Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall Prevail shall not Prevail against it all right let's drop over to Luke 17 verse 20 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation now the kingdom of God is is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that would come on the day of Pentecost right so we're in the right order neither shall they say loow here or low there for behold the kingdom of God is within you it was in him then now it's in Us by the new birth right all right and he said unto the disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see the days of the son of man speaking of a future event right the days will come all right that they will what that she shall not see it all right and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning that lith out of the one part of part under Heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day so he's evidently pointing future right right okay but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation right and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark now give it an example right of how it would be and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them even thus shall it be in the day see future time right when the son of man is revealed okay you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now I know that goes on to speak of and it did take place with Titus in ad70 when he surrounded Jerusalem Etc but the point is that it's Jesus Christ speaking of a future event all right let's give these out now what I've done on the last couple of messages I want to give you the opportunity to be able able to read what the prophet says and there's plenty more but yet these are are Choice ones for you to read and keep these and that way you can compare and somebody says what do y'all believe about the Bride of Jesus Christ I've heard y'all believe it'll be the fullness of the godhead bodily well I've explained that it takes the all entire bride not just the end time to be the fullness of the godhead bodily all right so then it brings everybody into view okay now then say well what do you believe about this here of dispensations well we believe in a dispensation of you know to be and and a dispensation of the Holy Ghost down through the church ages and then a dispensation of the son of man all right now you say well what about this son of man is that not just brother brandham well we'll read in a little bit I'm giving you these where he said I am not the son of man I am not the anointed son of man he said I must a son of man all right so then we believe and thank God because none of us would have an opportunity to understand the Bible had it not been that God kept his word of Malachi 4 and these things and the day of Luke 17:30 when it would be uh you know the revealed and and where everything would would come forth all right and then they'd say well what do you believe about cuz we've heard uh back in the 80s they begin to preach on the son of man and said what do you believe about that son of man well you know I've told you I don't believe it's brother brandom I believe that that the son the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ all right now what we're dealing with is where that son of man is to be made manifest we've come through the the days of where the Prophet was here and brought the message unto us and God was there with him in the resurrection sign which would relate back to son of man because that was what the son of man had was the resurrection sign all power things was given unto him see and he could raise the dead well then we come on over to see you know God raising the dead in the last days and proving that the word was right we were listening to to a message the other night I meant to write it down but you know I just didn't but see I I'll paraphrase you know the point uh we think that we've got to be into certain signs and wonders in the last days and I believe in it and I believe that we want God more Among Us than ever before I believe that I'm looking forward to that but don't deny what he's doing or been doing all right see because if you do that then you would never see what would be coming cuz if we're not prepared if we didn't eat as babies and grow up we wouldn't be here as adults that's just plain sensible all right so then you know to see it then the prophet even said as we gave it there that that that God wouldn't complete without you well now he's the one that said that you know I mean God said that all right so then let's accept what it is now and look and seek after God to unveil his word but now here's my point are we to put the emphasis in this last days and I'm just asking you to think with me you know what I preached for 40 years some of you and and you know that's what I just laid down we thank God for the prophet all right with without that you and I wouldn't be anything that's right okay but I think it's time to move on not move off of what the prophet says but to move on in what he said all right then in doing that are we to go back and find signs and wonders to have a Vindication and we believe in that but remember they have signs and wonders out there the sick is being healed the things are happening in the denominational reals all right what are we going to put that on I remember this happened now this is a story related to me that after uh brother Randon passed on some of the brothers got together because they was a brother that had signs and wonders and I can't remember his name but I would not even call it anyway but some of them went to visit him in his ministry some of the Believers in this message all right because are the signs and wonders that was taking place all right but I've always been this way the signs and wonders is wonderful I believe in them but remember the spirit of God is poured out upon All Flesh okay now signs and wonders out there how many times have you heard me make this statement I said there will even come a time when the Baptist and Methodist and Presbyterians Etc This is 40 years ago would be having signs and wonders among them amen now that's on Tape 40 years ago cuz I believed it but I also said then I said you will also find that they'll be saying well we must be of God cuz look what's happening among us all right you can't go out there and talk to the denominations today about signs and wonders cuz they'll quote you somewhere one of their churches has got it going on all right now bring it on down into the message I said this I said there'll come a time when signs and wonders will come among the what we call the bride real right and that the the the two Soul people the two Lords the doctrines and things the spirit of God is poured out upon all people and if the denominations move up to where that they will be having signs and wonders would not there be signs and wonders among the what we call the bride all right but they'll be saying we must be right because look what's happening well now do we have to take that as a uh nail down what do you call those big old words uh you know I mean we put it on that or what are we to put the end time on remember the Bible says cuz there's two quotes there in the Bible one of them says if a prophet give you a sign or tell you you got to follow him because God has sent him that's right but there's another scripture that says if a man comes or Prophet comes gives you a sign and the sign come to pass but he takes you to another God don't believe him because I sent that among you to try you is that paraphrasing a lot of scripture putting it together all right so then you know don't you think it's the time to for us to deal on one thing that we've always been ridiculed at Lula about because everybody says y'all are just word word word word word word word word word well I wholeheartedly differ with you now listen to my point we are word word word because that's what we've been built on but I differ with you about this thinking that things ain't been going on I can stand here and talk through an hour about the healings of this body I can talk to you about my blood type totally changed by medical proof on their own records my blood type was changed from a positive to a negative by their own record records the doctor told me to take my kneecap off years ago he said it's worn slap out that was in the day when you had the straight lagged deal you know you didn't have all this modern stuff and I laughed and said you won't take it off I still got my knees you want to walk a little bit when we get through these brothers always say oh papa work you to death we were down at the hunting land yesterday picking up the deer stands and and we were all doing our job and I was running up and down them stands as well as the rest of them taking them off the tree and and everything else I'm just saying we've seen the dead raised we've seen the sick healed we've seen storms spoke out of existence we've seen rain come at the voice of people who call for it that's the point that I'm trying to make don't deny that take that as a foundation and then what comes when the signs and wonders come well I don't know where well they're having signs and wonders over our them denomination reck want to go over there well then that means you don't know what's going on what if God allows it to be I didn't mean to bring this but I'll get it what if God allowed it to be that it would be those things that would try you and I to see where we'd stay with the word or not cuz what else can we go by that brother up there he's got signs and wonders but he's he's a little off that's what a lady told my wife one time about a man over in India said he's he he's supposed to be God my wife just asked her a simple question said does he believe everything brother random taught said well no no he don't believe all of it he's got a few things he don't believe she said forget it that's not of God not that God don't allow that to happen among us but what are you and I to be based on the word now the prophet I didn't say he said the bride would vindicate Malachi 4 vindicate Luke 1730 vindicate Revelations 10:7 what is to vindicate well bring them up here and let's raise couple of dead and world of believers they ain't going to believe you if you raise 40 from the dead you think they're going to change their Doctrine because of a dead race I wouldn't and I don't blame them because they don't right you understand what I mean if a man give you a sign and he says the Dead's going to be raised and here it is you think I'm going to say okay uh where are you in the word well I don't believe William Brandon was the prophet end time he was a little all here and a little all well what are you quoting him for that's right right I mean he's a little off he's the worst Antichrist there is right that's right well I got okay go ahead but that's just my point let's take what we got and let's Mar forward am in the revealed word we've been doing it for 40 something years here why change now run after some signer Wonder that's right a no problem with checking them out but how many denominations today's got signs and wonders what are you going to do well brother so and so and them they had a service up there in their church and they stood for 13 hours and worship that's been done in this message praise the Lord but what did it finish up with the same Doctrine can I make a quote from the prophet he said it don't matter what signs and wonders I'm paraphrasing so I may miss it there don't matter what the signs and wonders for he said if it goes back to the same old message okay now that's where I stand that's my point is to stand on the revealed word amen and thank God for it and for signs and wonders among us thank God for it but signs and wonders amongst them thank God for it when the Beatles prayed for people they were healed that's right did the Beatles heal them no the pope prays for people and they're healed did he heal them no when Lula prays for the people and when they're healed do they heal them no when brother random prayed for the people and they were healed did Brother random heal them no we give God the glory all the way there's nothing in you and I worth anything that's right but why can't we stand on what we got because it's going to get deceiving I told you 40 years ago that the doctrines back then of the two Souls the two Lords or doctor I said they're not deceiving because they can't even quote the Bible correct I had a man the other day I said you got your computer would you look up a quote I said they say that brother randam said the the two Soul people you know quoting says that the soul is just the nature of the spirit I said run it in you computer and find that quote he run it in he said it's zero and you're exactly right brother brand said it the soul is not just the nature of the spirit he said the soul is the nature of the spirit well that don't change much I thought it was one word oh my that's right I that's all my understanding now cuz when you say just the nature of spirit you mean it's not worth nothing it's just just a a dog is just the nature of a dog cat's the nature of a cat it's just a nature no the soul is the real you amen it's not just a nature of something it's you am all right but you see that's word that I don't I don't fit in I guess and that's all right I'm sorry I pray all the time I cry all the time about things and pray Lord you know help me to get myself out of the way that I can be used no matter if I'm a cast away right but for my people Lord let me get myself out of the way and just keep bringing the word Lord I believe it now if I'm saying what brother Brandon said I know saying what brother Brown said is not going to convert anybody I just got to explaining that I believe everything brother Brown says there's people hollering at today and screaming sitting down in not just in Georgia all over the country sitting in churches playing tapes right when he said and the Bible says forsake not to assembly well we're assembled we want to hear it from the prophet and I've told you I wouldn't go to a lot of these churches that claim to be preaching the message that's why this building started July the 4th 1971 because we were so tired of listening to 65 little things and tired of wrong doctrines told you about the man standing up in the pull pit read the scripture woman shall be saved in childbearing he just stopped later on I said brother why didn't you read the rest of that well you mean I read what the Bible says I said but read the rest of the scripture right you're making childbearing saving women that's Catholic I said really I guess he didn't even know what the rest of it said I said the rest of it said if she continue in the faith right well he evidently didn't do no good he got up and about another day or two later read the same scripture stopped at the same point you see what I'm talking about yes I have become the enemy to people because I've tried to stay with the truth well I'll keep trying until the day I die I'll be fighting for this message well you're all here well come and show me that's on the internet that's on anywhere come and show me where I'm on now don't be silly don't come and say you PR you missed that quote just a little bit cuz you ain't going to talk two seconds and I'm going to tell you you goofed up and then we're going to be to goof up sitting looking at each other right bring the message show me where brother R said to bride if not to be the fullness of the godhead bodily I want a quote I want a scripture but the point of it is is like I said I'll get to the message in a minute you say I don't mean for you to raise your hand now and I don't mean I know I just mean what I'm saying but if I say raise your hand everybody that believes you're born again well Lord hands go up right raise your hand if you believe you're in the bride hands go up raise your hand if you believe that the bride will be the fullness of the godhead body you get cramps and down the hand goes well I I kind of believe that but it's just a little too far well I didn't say it the Bible says it and the prophet said it I didn't say it that's right right amen I just don't see it now there's where you're blind amen when you say I don't see it right amen if we had you had that Lula you'd have more signs and wonders like I said you want the rest of the service we'll just let everybody take it time about and testify about what God's done well people I can do that too okay I just got to explaining the anointing P out but will them people over there take the word there's going to be your criteria and what the big old words are there's going to be whatever you got to base it on is whether or not you believe the word amen come on the prophet said God would allow these things to to come absolutely to try you and I the Locust k p caterpillar the Bible says my great Army that I sent among you did God send it no he permitted it to come into being that's true to try you and I amen what does the word say what does the word say that's it that's that's all I've got folks that's just what does the word say okay let's get on a little bit further now we've been talking about the dispensation and we covered that I hope enough for you to understand that we believe in dispensations amen and the reason brother Brandon would say he didn't go along with dispensation so much was the interpret ation of the word dispensation are the things and it can mean stewardships it can mean different things but then when he would say I am a dispensationalist and when he says God is a dispensationalist that is even not a word until this later modern day in uh and you know it's not in Webster's Dictionary dispensational list is not in there it's in it's modern talk all right but see to me he's saying I believe in dispensations there was a dispensation Old Testament dispensation of the new there was a dispensation of the Son of God down through the church ages all right now is the dispensation or time of the son of man right all right it was the Gentile dispensation right cu the word dispensation is in the Bible it's a gentile dispens it's the time of the Gentiles right all right now then in being that the I love to look at words and then think a little and just consider the point of what's actually being said and then look at the scriptures uh thereby and and watch it tie together all right we believe that the prophet taught that there would be a dispensation we'll read it in a minute because we' already read it of the son of man all right now brother brandom will say that he is not the son of man but then why would he turn around and say the bride will be the son of man right now remember he's part of the Bride let's don't isolate him let his ministry isolate him or Elevate him to the position of leading the bride in the end time and he even I gave it to you the other day where that this would be that this this uh Mei forign things would be what would bring to pass these things you know it'll bring to pass these things in the bride all right without him we wouldn't have a message right but then he's gone and we're we're you know we are to be ready in his word now I I've never said to you publicly and and I there's no need of talking people talking about tent Visions return Ministries and all I've told you where I stand brother random can come back in 30 40 days he can preach to us I've never had no trouble with that cuz I believe that in the beginning I still believe it now but I'm not waiting on him because I know one thing if the people are not prepared what good would it do for him to come back that's right well he'll come back and prepare us 30 more years it took in 30 years to preach a statute of per that's his word come on come on folks 99% what's in here ain't got 30 years right we going to be dead that's right are we going to be 110 years old or more right but Church listen then it's not trying to interpret it's just saying it we when the dead raises we're not going to oh brother let me uh brother collie I I heard there's dead people raised and I said well I don't know where to believe it or not he said well I don't know where to believe it or not what have we done you think that's going to be it no that's why the pictures are downstairs where you can see the people that have passed on when they walk in you'll say oh I know B Jimmy Gibson I never thought he looked like that but we got a picture of it where we can see it cuz they ain't going to raise old people sir now get that out of your mind it ain't going to be no old people in then made young out they raised that's you know no it's just going to be an end time people that are ready right ready for the coming of the Lord that's right that's the only thing that I've ever preached to you is be prepared I've tried to warn you about doctrines that's among the land cuz I thought that was my job as Pastor to do that but I can't convert you or change your mind and people are read the message or hear the message identically the same way I hear it because I didn't know they were two different messages and I know those flash tapes in the early Ministries and things but that's not supposed to be now we're supposed to be getting the the word right right straight from where the Prophet brought it you know and and things but you say you only quote so much well I I give you the opportunity I read the whole quote I put the quote on there yeah but that's just the way you see it thank you for telling me that's the way I see it because if it lines up with all this D right my seeing must be pretty good right but now if it's not what he taught I want you to tell me it's not I'm always open for discussion why because we will never Church all of us well brother so and so overseas brother so and so here brother so and so all said cat this morning well we say cat you see that's a silly illustration I'm trying to illustrate it it's never going to be why because I've preached to you what I believe that the ministry of Jesus Christ is around the world in the bride of Christ well we only have our little part here so we only have the toenail right we only have the small things I don't have no problems with that cuz I know it but we believe what he said but see you ain't going to convert people with reading what brother Brown says now they say I believe everything he says right but isn't it like brother R said about the Church of Christ man when he said the Bible still talk and where you at the church of Christ says we believe everything the Bible says well I kind of doubt that don't you if he did they'd be in this message right but you know what they're part of this message that's what people don't understand about me I don't denounce any church of what they brought and even these doctrines among the message they brought it to a place that they made you study to show yourself approved to keep you from being deceived right all right I don't know get it off and go on but you forgive me for being like that you forgive me for for being arrogant hateful whatever words you want to call me just forgive me of it and for just pray for me you know because I'm just trying to get get a bride ready that's it all right that's all I'm trying to do is get this group here ready anybody else listens in that's her business I'm not pastoring internet I refuse to be called at but what I'm saying church we are in the end time in the days as we read where the son of man would be revealed all right now there had to be a son of man to bring the message of the son of man we agree with that we believe it but what most people don't believe is that the brother brandham 464 the old seal B he's talking about the end time and he's talking about isusa Street and he said that there was a prophet came on isusa Street but he said then at the end of the time the messenger would come a prophet on a zeusa street brother Dale I don't believe that well you don't believe what brother random said that's your business I didn't say it I didn't have enough sense to say it I just found what he said all right then if that was the Holy Ghost that fell back there onusa street that was the prophet then the prophet has to deal with the Holy Spirit right and then it moves into the son of man right see then a prophet would start at the right place and then it would come into brother brandom's Ministry the prophet of God right but now it's into the ministry of the bride and I said raise your hand oh I believe I'm born again I believe I'm bride but I don't know where we're the fullness now that's you you don't understand me and I'm sorry you wasn't there but most of you were somewhere we Baptist you can say you believe you're born again yes I believe I'm no listen you believe you saved yeah I believe I'm saved you believe you're born again I believe I'm born again you believe you're going to heaven I hope I do see you just lost everything like I told you brother said I believe I'm born again but I don't know where I'm in Bride or not what kind of talk is that ain't even sensible if the prophet said the bride that God is not complete without the bride why can't we believe that and that's all I'm trying to explain if he said she's the fullness of the godhead bodily why can't we say that and I've made it over and over every time to say that to make sure you don't misunderstand I'm not talking about just an enti people I'm talking about the whole bride down through there cuz he standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks amen but why can't why can't we believe it Church yes he said I'd say to you do you believe this man I believe this message well do you put everything you got on this message as brother dick said years ago what if he come up one of these days and say brother Brandon was married about 10 or 12 times and they got the documents to prove it with which I don't believe they will okay right but what if we do I'm getting out of this and find me something else what where is they something else right right but I he you know his statement was and my statement's always been the man by his preaching brought me to an understanding of the god that I desired to find and no matter what they say he was wrong here wrong there whatever that's between them and God right I just glory in the word that I've heard amen but now let's get down to the thought we read in Revelations 1 11-13 the other day when Wednesday we was preaching and we were bringing out it says one like unto the son of man we went down through that to show that and we will and have them in here maybe quote it again that when it says John turned to see the voice and he saw seven golden candlesticks and he saw the bride the prophet said right see now remember that if past our day in time when it's fully seen right cuz that's already over in the day of the Lord all right and that would put the fullness of the godhead bodily standing there in a people like unto the son of man amen it's going to be that when we become what we are supposed to be it will complete what God has planned for the entire Earthly Journey amen and will be able to stand there amen and be part of the Bride that'll be standing there all right but she'll be the fullness of the godhead bodily that's right now to be that then it would require that she also be the son of man that's right all right we went through showing that brother R the unveiling of God is a wonderful place to read from I ask you to read those Mighty God unveil unveiling of God and who is this mdic different ones matter of fact just read anything you're going to find it especially after 64 and up 63 and 64 up you're going to find him saying some things every time that's right you in every message all right brother Ray was bringing me something the other day that he always says in every message well you say well okay all right but think about it brother random explain expl it we went through it he said there in Revelations 1 going on down to the one standing there and all he said this is not a Prophet this is God all right but what form was he in he was in the form of one like unto the son of man right we need to study and think about one like unto the son of man see it doesn't say it was the son of man standing there but yet that was the son of man standing there because it was almighty God Amen but what form is he shown in like I said the Book of Revelation to me is most marvelous book of all the Bible because it's showing Jesus Christ but it never shows him alone it shows him in Bride form it shows him in 144,000 form shows him in foolish virgin form it shows him in all form but he's never by himself even when he's sitting on the throne we're sitting on the throne with him we went through that Wednesday night why it's G about the pouch feminist but yet the the government's upon his shoulders and it hangs down and that meant that he was no longer in service of gered around the waist but it was over his shoulder and the bride is to be the government she's the shoulders he's standing on that part is made manifest cuz he's the head all right but think about it what it really means to be like we take the word like as being well that that little baby back there little SRA you know she looks just like her mama Brother Anderson look at us well she's got characteristics about him too you know we see but you just look at the face and you look at her and you know and we've got pictures at home where that Nanny was back in her younger days you know and uh you know that Anna we got pictures of her when Nanny was one or two years old got pictures of Anna one or two years old we got pictures of abig Grace you know what very liking resemblance of each one until it's amazing you know how they look but that's what we think about resemblance all right but I'm not talking about this the resemblance to look like we're going to tie together a few words and then you'll you'll you'll see more about what I'm talking about and but titled is the son of man and we'll get on back to more this afternoon I'm sure but look at number one is what we've got and this is taken from Revelations 1 where it says one standing in the midst of the s golden C like unto the son of man all right that word like it means similar it means resembling in other words to resemble something it means like or corresponding to a thing what like now we go over in Genesis 1:26 and 27 and it says that God made man in what his likeness see after his likeness goes on talks about his image and all but it's after his likeness all right now pull up that word that other one was 3664 is the one in Revelations uh 1 133 says like now this is taken from uh Genesis 1 126 and this is number will come up 1823 and look what it says it says likeness or similitude now if you think about it you remember the scripture that it says that he came into what the similitude of man in other words that doesn't mean just to look like a man he he came as man right right talking about similitude of our transgressions but all says in the likeness of are like as all right that it starts off in Genesis as being similitude or whatever and we know that when we were made in His image in his likeness means that the one you're speaking of there is God himself right Genesis 1:26 is explaining the soul of God the beginning the creation all right and it's it's in his likeness it doesn't mean likeness like look like right that's illustrating that you know look like Sarah looks like her mother but she's not her mother right Anna looked like her mother you know abig Grace looked like her mother but there's not the mother there's a lot of difference there that's different people but when you're go into terminologies of the Bible you're not talking about something who just looks like it all right because that can be the devil can imitate that easily but you're talking about the word what did he call it IM morphe change in form so who is this 126 and 27 man it's the soul of almighty God which is God himself amen right amen not something to look like but something in another form and then morphe the same person in another form not person in the form of a person all right now now watch it now watch we get down to these definitions and we'll quit probably do this so we go over and we read in you remember the likeness after our likeness in Genesis 126 we'll go over now and we'll read in Philippians all right Philippians 2 let this mind be in you which we also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form in morphe he changed his form same God of a servant and was made in the likeness of men now look up that definition 3667 go ahead to number five it means likeness made like to similitude or shape now watch the opening of the meaning of the word of likeness as it comes forth that which has been made after the likeness of something that's fine a figure image likeness representation now you're getting a better word right now watch likeness in other words resembling such as amounts well nigh to equality or identity that's right see he changed and formed to become a man right but that was still the same God right yes so he changed in form as we want to go with it to day of Pentecost and he changed in form in bright form which would be called Holy Ghost baptism Son of God all right now then that all relates back to Revelations 1113 one like unto the son of man we see it's not somebody that looks like the son of man right right it's the son of man in another form okay hold your seat if Genesis 1 126 is right that he made man in his own likeness and if that's true I leave that up to you if that's true see I believe it that that means that that's not another person cuz you're going back to your trinitarian thoughts it means that that is the the same person in another form right so Genesis 2626 is God made manifest in another form that's right call man but not dealing with the flesh man in 126 right that's two Genesis 2 Genesis 2 we're made in the image fleshly of animals you know right this is this is just an animal outside but on the inside by the new birth we have a marvelous situation under thinking about so now I hope you're going to get what I'm trying to say when I speak of the son of man I look back can I see the Lord Jesus Christ who never referred to himself as Son of God yet he was born that and he says I am the word and all of that all right but he never referred to himself as Son of God why because the IM morphe or form he was in was in the form of son of man all right now remember he comes son of man Son of God Son of David right all right and I know when I make statements people I don't know about that he was son of man while he was alive on Earth and walking he died son of man yes now the same one raised same body raised but how did it raise in a glorified State and what happened the life that was in him right went into the church to fulfill what he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church AR it went into Son of God dispensation you don't have any writings by Paul and them in the writings of son of man but John immediately upon patmas he's seeing one like unto the son of man and he knows the voice remember yes he turned to see The Voice he didn't turn to see the he knew who the person was that's right right he knew that was Jesus Christ speaking to him but when he turned being a prophet he would see symbolics that's right you know what he saw when he turned Jesus right but he was in another form right like unto the son of man so he's in bright form as we covered the other night but just remember son of man Son of God Son of David now brother Brandon will say son of God Son of Man son of David uh you know different ways but my point is what you read the unveiling of God and you keep on you'll get what he's talking about that's right son of man while he was on Earth died that son of man Rose Son of God come on to death Pentecost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the bride to be the son of God but the reason he's got to come back in the end time as son of man because you can't go from Holy Spirit Son of God to son of David you have no earthly connection all right you got to have a connection made so he's son of man then he's Son of God then he returns in the end time as son of man then he can be son of David cuz you know what son of David is son of David is in the Millennium right and you know what he is the reason he's son of David he'll be king of the Earth right right come on he'll be king king of the earth Amen in the Millennium Jesus Christ will be king of the earth and his wife the bride will be there with him all right so then as looking at it see you can see a beautiful picture unfold yes that he's got to return as son of man yes CU son of man is the word made flesh whereas Son of God is the Holy Ghost living in you that's right and if the bride is going to be the fullness of the godhead bodily and if the bride is going to be the son of man she's going to be the word made flesh that's right and Luther was a word made flesh absolutely amen but there was no dispensation he could make manifest That's Right Wesley come on he was the word made flesh ausa Street was the word made flesh right and a people but yet that wasn't the dispensation or imorphia or change that God would bring into being so he's going to be in The Bride In the End Time Amen in morphe yes the life formed to the Gentile dispensation that's why I say we're not Oneness cuz Oneness is like Jesus and they say Jesus is the light form of God well I differ with him right the Bride of Jesus Christ is the liest form of God brother of random is in that bride he is not the LI form of God God was in the man but you remember the man is a part of the body of Christ what a wonderful place for him to be as part of the body of Christ as a born again believer as a church age messenger but as a prophet to bring bring the word how much greater could you proclaim the man to be no wonder he says you were given more gifts and things in anybody why because he's to finish it all up right but you see what I'm talking about cuz we'll just end there cuz if I get in the other I'm going to get in the other parts of it we don't need to we do that this evening we'll go back to where brother R said he could not come calling himself in the ages as son of man he called himself Son of God because that would be the dispensation of the Son of God to the ages now is changing dispensation he said the lady see and age is over but lady see and age he said goes on to connects to the Millennium really because it goes on through the tribulation as ladyo seea there's not another age H but he says the bride called out what she called out for we get that this evening what she called out for she's called out to be in a dispensation to where that we can walk up and look death in the face and walk off of this Earth because the original son of man done that am right all right now remember they had to kill him where he could make it manifest we won't be killed in the end time to come forth somebody's going to walk right into death and and won't be killed now the ones that's died and one own is going to be raised to be part of that okay all right now but look well n to equality or ident identity that's good now I'll just make this statement and we'll quit on it so then he's in Genesis it's likeness and that's not another God it's God in another form to display himself as his children right Paul in Philippians speaks of the likeness this man that came of mankind so he came in our likeness he came in our form right he changed his form to come down to be like you and I for the reason that he could take you and I to be into his form all right then when you see him in Revelations is already passed the the time I know where it's at come on I'm not misplacing it so don't run it off chapter 4 is where John is taken up but remember you better read chapter one because brother Brown said this is not in the days of man this is in the days of the Lord so this is chapter one is showing it totally finished right that's why it's showing it that way the same God that started off that had the condescend down keep changing his form to become a man started on the day of Pentecost as to bringing the Holy Ghost into the people and bringing it through dispensations and bringing it through to where that he could say in chapter one of Revelations about verse 13 one like unto the son of man now would not that be now remember Genesis 1 126 and 27 said this is not man you know like one man a man this is man what was he speaking of when he said this is not just a man but he's speaking of man he's speaking of the soul of almighty God because the body was not created until chapter 2 agree then in Chapter two The Soul was put into the body and now are you standing with Adam all right now that part came into the Lord Jesus Christ to finish that Genesis 1: 126 and 27 Those Old Testament people could not be born again because the Holy Ghost had not been given his life had not been shed the animal life couldn't come back and change him all right but see then the Lord Jesus Christ could make a way and he did he gave the Holy Ghost which would come on the day of Pentecost in the New Birth you and I Son of God you know no matter what age you're born in it's Son of God being made manifest then in the end time he's to return back and be revealed or made known or come into being as son of man and you see him immediately in chapter one of Revelation one like unto the son of man see because that is the whole of 126 and 27 standing in being amen that's right did you notice way I said it the whole of it I wrote in my thing the completeness 126 and 27 shows the man that God wanted that he started in Genesis to bring him into being which would be his own offspring amen which would be his children amen that would come in into be and then in the end time he would come back and make that known and start dealing with son of man why would your Prophet then start sure he's dealing son of man prophetic ministry right we know that but then he immediately starts speaking of another form of the original grain or seed that went into the ground which was the son of man would come back through the church ages and then come out in the end time to be the original grain that went into the ground not to just look like right but to be the very total person we reading when we get on in this evening brother Brown said and that goes to show it God and man together what do you think God thinks of you and I he thinks so much of us until he'll never be seen apart never never will he ever be seen apart people at gil they think me and my wife they think she's got me henpecked maybe I am a little chicken I like it that ain't none of your business but we're going to deal with your problems we'll deal with them we'll talk about how hped you are but everybody you gives what we life cuz every time we go anywhere we're together I like it I say are you going with me you know most of the time it's never our you going with me we just supposed to get up and go of course how old are we getting we get up going to the doctor right cuz that's way you do too that's right that's but listen I like that because they can make fun all they want to that's right anybody can of me or what he going to do cuz I'm just what I am I'm proud of of my wife I'm proud of my family I'm proud of my church family and I always want to be related to it I don't want to be say that I'm not this or I'm not that I want to be related to you as the part that we've struggled together to come out to the position to work that you and I can be ready against the day amen amen you know if they' had just listened to the Lord Jesus now let me end this part musicians come on now I'm paraphrasing brother ROM in words but you'll know it's true had those people Li listened to the Lord Jesus and the ones who did got out of Jerusalem there was none of the Christians now come on none of the Christian born again Believers there was none of them there when Titus came you know what go right where we was reading at it starts talking about it right amen when you see this and when you see that and get out you know what my point is they were prepared and when everybody else saw Titus coming right they saw him coming I mean in that day it wouldn't a surprise overnight I mean my Lord you can see 500 miles you know a good set of old cheap scope they already had things back then that we think they didn't have but they already had a lot of it you can see them coming you can see the dust boiling they knew Titus was coming and back then they didn't didn't just come in and do it they send a runner over and said we'll be there in 3 days we're going to give you an opportunity to get out get your women your children and get out wouldn't that the way it always would happen they knew my point is they knew they were coming you know what everybody done run into the temple run in and close the gates right God will be with us we're going into the temple and they was holding on lot of them was killed holding on to the horns of the alers and things but you see they didn't listen that's right he said pray that your flight be not in the winter time on the Sabbath day CU see the hills were snow Brown in the winter time he told them that Titus was coming and you know what the real Christians when they seen Titus coming they didn't run to the altar they got out of the city not a true Christian was left in the city it was only the Jews and the people there and they thought they could gather in the around the temple and God would protect them and see the God had already left the dispensation and changed God had left the Tabernacle the temple now he was in the temples that was walking out of the city and everybody from why look look at them look at them they br cowards yeah why don't you stay like us we're going in the temple boy we're going to fight this thing out with them cuz God Is With Us oh but the real true Christian you to get out that's right and they left real true Christians in the end time is supposed to be programmed to know what's going on Amen and the hours that we're living that's why I spend time telling you that the prophet said it will take place he said the Methodist and Baptist will be raised in the dead Healing The Sick it's our folks you just bring it on over into the message Believers and you see great signs and wonders taking place but where we going to run when Titus comes I ain't coming again don't be stupid I'm not talking about Titus coming back I'm talking about the church World System whether it be branhamites or lulit is going to come after the bride read the foreal and tell me where the battle of Armageddon is supposed to be fought over in a certain Valley over there but tell me where those forces come from Brother brandham never mentions for seal he never mentions Russia China he says Catholics and Protestants coming after the chosen of
