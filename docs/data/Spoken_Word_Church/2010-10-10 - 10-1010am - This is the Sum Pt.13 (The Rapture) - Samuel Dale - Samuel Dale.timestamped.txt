[34:47] 8 and Ecclesiastes 12 father we thank
[34:51] you for an opportunity of gathering this
[34:54] this morning Lord to be able to come
[34:55] together and to be Lord just be able to
[34:58] sit down for a little while and rest
[35:00] under the shade tree as we call it and
[35:02] listen to you as you would speak to our
[35:04] hearts and our lives we ask you now that
[35:06] you would just Lord come among us and
[35:09] that you'd have your will in way with us
[35:11] and Lord that you
[35:13] may be the preeminent one in us and
[35:16] using us not just as the one that we can
[35:19] you can record our deeds and actions but
[35:22] to come and live in our hearts and lives
[35:24] we love you and we thank you bless those
[35:26] that are not here remember each one and
[35:29] just keep us in Jesus name amen amen now
[35:33] I want to read the first six verses
[35:36] we've been reading verse
[35:38] one all right we've been reading verse
[35:41] one from Hebrews 8 but let's read six
[35:44] verses
[35:46] now now the things which we have spoken
[35:50] this is the PSAL and remember the point
[35:53] the entire seven chapters preceding now
[35:57] he's summing it up this is the sum of
[36:00] what he's been talking about right what
[36:03] is it we have such an high priest who is
[36:05] set on the right hand of the Throne of
[36:07] the Majesty in the heavens a minister of
[36:10] the
[36:11] sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle
[36:14] which the Lord pitched and not man for
[36:17] every high priest is ordained to offer
[36:19] gifts and
[36:20] sacrifices wherefore it is a necessity
[36:24] that this man have some what also to
[36:27] offer
[36:28] for he were on Earth he should not be a
[36:31] priest what now for if he were on Earth
[36:36] he should not be a priest seeing that
[36:38] there are priests that offer gifts
[36:40] according to the law H now we'll get to
[36:43] that in a minute see this is talking
[36:44] about almighty God coming down to dwell
[36:47] with us all right there is people who
[36:49] were offering those things you
[36:52] understand what Paul is to
[36:54] say who serve unto the example and
[36:56] Shadow of Heavenly things as Moses was
[36:59] admonished of God when he was about to
[37:01] make the Tabernacle for see sayith he
[37:04] that thou make all things according to
[37:06] the pattern showed thee in the
[37:09] mount but now hath he obtained a more
[37:13] excellent Ministry but how much also he
[37:17] is the mediator of a better Covenant
[37:20] which was established upon better
[37:23] promises now if God's word is yay and
[37:25] amen amen and all the proom promises are
[37:28] Y and amen then we stand on a better
[37:31] promise more Y and amen right all right
[37:34] Ecclesiastes 12 and verse 13 let us hear
[37:38] the conclusion
[37:40] Ecclesiastes the preacher now he's
[37:42] telling you let us hear the conclusion
[37:44] of what he's been trying to explain in
[37:46] in 11
[37:48] chapters said let us hear the conclusion
[37:50] of the whole matter fear God now what is
[37:54] the conclusion fear God and keep his
[37:56] Commandments for the this is the whole
[37:58] duty of man you may be seated the Lord
[38:01] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[38:09] word we have been
[38:12] covering now for some
[38:15] time speaking on
[38:17] the what is called the seven compound
[38:20] names of Jehovah we know that there are
[38:22] many more uh names of Jehovah are titles
[38:27] however how you want to say it but it's
[38:29] basically summed up in the uh the
[38:32] compound names of Jehovah like Jehovah
[38:34] Gyra Jehovah tishu Jehovah RI Jehovah
[38:39] shama each one we've covered all of
[38:41] these coming down bringing it to a basis
[38:45] to try to understand that then we would
[38:49] understand if you if you don't value one
[38:52] above the other one that uh you are
[38:55] coming out to the correct understanding
[38:58] now we know we say well we need a savior
[39:02] more than we need a Healer well that's
[39:05] understandable that's that's that's all
[39:07] right but the thing of it is it was the
[39:10] same
[39:11] atonement that made manifest Hallelujah
[39:15] see and if he is our healer our savior
[39:19] he is our healer amen and if he's our
[39:21] healer he's our savior if he's our if
[39:23] he's our
[39:24] peace
[39:26] see then see the shama then he can be
[39:30] anything tiu which is the the one of our
[39:33] righteousness and it's all talking about
[39:36] the one true and living God the Lord
[39:39] Jesus
[39:40] Christ all right now see then he is the
[39:44] high
[39:46] priest that we have we have a great high
[39:50] priest right and other
[39:52] words had he done all of those things
[39:55] without sending a high priest so you say
[39:58] yeah but he was that I agree with you
[39:59] but get the point see that's what I'm
[40:01] trying to get you to
[40:04] see that he if he is all of those things
[40:07] that was revealed and and uh you know
[40:10] spoken of throughout the
[40:12] Bible then surely we would realize that
[40:15] he is and would have to be almighty God
[40:19] made manifest in flesh right because all
[40:23] of that spoke of him and see as I said
[40:26] you'd say but but we need a savior more
[40:28] than we need a Healer but it doesn't
[40:31] work that way that's your mentality
[40:33] that's your uh human thinking of a
[40:36] situation right because you can't
[40:39] separate the atonement that's right if
[40:41] you believe him as I said to be your
[40:44] savior well then you must believe that
[40:46] at the same thing that according to to
[40:49] uh Isaiah 53 that he was wounded for our
[40:53] transgressions bruised for our iniquity
[40:56] and with his stripes were're heal
[40:58] H see it's all tied
[41:00] together into one uh I don't like to use
[41:04] lump some because it's not a that's just
[41:08] a human words that we use it's all
[41:10] gathered together into revealing the one
[41:14] true and living God which would be that
[41:16] the Jehovah of the Old Testament right
[41:20] would have to be the Jesus Christ of the
[41:24] new
[41:25] right you can't separate him and make
[41:28] him a second person third person or
[41:31] whatever you know because that's not uh
[41:35] that's not
[41:36] correct and that's what I'm trying to
[41:38] get us to see if he's one thing he has
[41:41] to be the
[41:43] other if he's our savior he also has to
[41:46] be our
[41:49] Banner to be lifted up if he's our
[41:52] Banner then he has to be our
[41:55] healer and that's the point I'm trying
[41:57] to get us to see that you can't separate
[42:01] it cuz when you try to separate it
[42:04] you're going back toward the trinitarian
[42:06] concept that you're trying to make one
[42:09] person do one thing another person do
[42:12] another thing and another do another or
[42:15] something and you're right back where
[42:17] you would be in the Trinity
[42:19] concept but if you truly believe the
[42:21] Bible that is one true and living
[42:25] God then you believe that there is many
[42:28] manifestations of that God
[42:32] Amen all right that's what I've tried to
[42:34] get you to see about it that uh like
[42:39] Abraham Abraham needed a
[42:43] sacrifice and that was why it came up to
[42:45] be Jehovah
[42:47] J now Abraham at that point didn't need
[42:50] a
[42:53] Healer so whatever God was for the time
[42:58] to him and that's what he must be to you
[43:01] and
[43:02] I sure he must be a savior to save
[43:06] us but then we should realize that once
[43:09] we receive the Savior that all of the
[43:13] other things of God are involved in that
[43:16] one point of
[43:17] Salvation because even the uh the Greek
[43:21] word for healing is the same Greek word
[43:24] for salvation which is the word Soo
[43:28] it's the same
[43:30] word but see if he's one thing to us
[43:33] then he's
[43:34] another now listen I tried to explain it
[43:37] this
[43:38] way if you
[43:40] need a
[43:43] Healer then you don't pray for God to
[43:45] send you a banner you know you don't you
[43:49] don't pray for him to send you a
[43:51] revelation of how righteous he is you're
[43:54] needing a Healer
[43:57] all right see God is whatever we have
[44:01] need
[44:04] of and that way he can manifest himself
[44:08] he did in the Old Testament as we would
[44:11] call it to
[44:13] father but then he come on over Jehovah
[44:16] then he came on over in the New
[44:18] Testament we talk about which is Jesus
[44:23] Christ then he comes on over to where
[44:26] that it's the Holy Ghost dwelling in the
[44:28] people well that's the same
[44:30] God it's not three
[44:34] Gods that's that same God revealed in
[44:38] three
[44:40] manifestations he said well that's what
[44:41] they try to explain to Trinity no now
[44:43] you go talk to them and you ask them and
[44:46] and they'll they'll tell you real quick
[44:48] that they believe it's God in three
[44:49] persons Blessed Trinity and they got
[44:52] make them coal and coeternal well see
[44:55] that that won't tie up with the
[44:56] scripture
[44:58] but get the point I've been trying to
[45:02] make if we need say a banner to come
[45:05] down like it uh it was there you know
[45:08] when the Gideon the it was told to him
[45:12] that it'd be Jehovah to where that would
[45:15] represent a
[45:16] banner now he wasn't praying for a
[45:19] savior he wasn't needing like
[45:22] Abraham a sacrifice
[45:27] in other words see you you put it all
[45:28] together and you just say well well what
[45:30] it is is just one thing you know and
[45:32] then You' say well now there it is to
[45:35] Gideon what he needs is he needs an
[45:37] offering to make he needs a a ram to you
[45:41] know no he didn't need
[45:44] that God reveals himself to us as to
[45:49] what we have need
[45:52] of do you understand that what we have
[45:55] need of what it is for the time that we
[46:01] need but right here today in the
[46:03] building see there's many re many
[46:09] needs cuz one would need a maybe a
[46:13] savior one of maybe a
[46:17] Healer one needs a banner to be raised
[46:20] up to help you know or revelation of the
[46:23] righteousness of
[46:25] God but he doesn't do it like that all
[46:28] at one time to an
[46:30] individual but he reveals himself
[46:32] personal to each
[46:34] one and that was why it was written like
[46:37] that of
[46:41] Jehovah see then it was putting
[46:43] something
[46:45] personal for the
[46:48] moment all right you following me
[46:51] whatever was
[46:53] needed is what God brought forth amen
[46:58] okay now in doing that then he brought
[47:01] it to a
[47:03] place that he could reveal himself
[47:06] throughout the
[47:08] word and not showing himself to one
[47:12] person and that be
[47:15] all but he would reveal what that person
[47:18] needs but then see the next person would
[47:21] need something else that's all I've been
[47:24] trying to explain
[47:27] and that way you keep the one true and
[47:28] living God in the right understanding
[47:32] but it's something
[47:35] personal now listen to what I'm trying
[47:38] to say and don't misinterpret what I say
[47:43] please all of the seven compound names
[47:46] of
[47:46] Jehovah were in the Old
[47:49] Testament
[47:51] okay now Jehovah Gyra is the Lord
[47:57] provided
[47:59] sacrifice okay all right now
[48:03] Abraham and it's going to be hard I told
[48:06] my wife I had to try to explain
[48:09] something Abraham didn't need a
[48:18] savior Isaac was one that needed the
[48:24] sacrifice come on am I right now
[48:27] Isaac was the one that needed the
[48:31] sacrifice
[48:33] Abraham had as I trying to explain there
[48:35] Wednesday he had to sacrifice he was
[48:38] going to crucify right there or kill his
[48:41] own son and burn him up because God told
[48:44] him to right
[48:46] right all right he was walking by faith
[48:49] and
[48:50] saying when Isaac said now Lord here's
[48:53] the wood here's the I mean Daddy here's
[48:55] the wood here's the the fire right we
[48:59] got the knife but where's the
[49:01] sacrifice he said the Lord will provide
[49:04] for himself a sacrifice amen now he was
[49:06] speaking by faith that was great but
[49:09] Abraham wasn't the one that was
[49:12] needing the
[49:15] sacrifice Isaac was the one that was
[49:17] needing
[49:18] it all right
[49:22] now so really then Jehovah Gyra is the
[49:26] Lord provided sacrifice
[49:31] right now then that meant that and other
[49:34] words to fulfill
[49:36] that that was only as we read in the
[49:40] Hebrews these things happen for a an
[49:45] example all right all that we've covered
[49:48] about the seven compound names of
[49:49] Jehovah that's why I said that there's
[49:52] not a Rapture tied into that we'll get
[49:55] to more of that later
[49:58] cuz that's what I want you to look
[50:01] at all
[50:03] right
[50:04] now Gideon as I said he didn't need a
[50:12] sacrifice he needed a banner to be
[50:14] raised
[50:16] up he needed God to come on the scene to
[50:19] fight a battle
[50:22] amen all right now we talk about it to
[50:24] say well now here it is now
[50:27] uh you know and here' come Moses down in
[50:31] Egypt and he'd say well God sent me down
[50:34] here to deliver the children of Israel
[50:37] out of Egypt you know out the
[50:38] desert and he said what we're going to
[50:40] do is build an
[50:42] ark you said well they did have the Nile
[50:45] River
[50:46] but that wasn't exactly where they were
[50:49] going the way they were going was
[50:51] totally
[50:52] desert so they didn't need an ark right
[50:56] all right
[50:57] God gives you what you have need
[51:01] of and he gives it to you for the time
[51:05] that you have need of
[51:11] it he you need peace in your heart
[51:15] you're troubled you're worried and
[51:16] things and you need peace that's one of
[51:19] the Jehovah shama
[51:21] see his peace shalom
[51:25] shalom if I get those crossed up you put
[51:28] them in the right place I'm trying to
[51:31] preach but see we cry out for
[51:36] peace and he sends us a
[51:39] Healer that wasn't what we're crying
[51:42] for we crying for
[51:45] peace see God gives you what you have
[51:49] need
[51:51] of now he may not give it the way you
[51:54] want it
[52:00] right but he'll give it to
[52:03] you but you
[52:06] see what we need to do is pray for what
[52:09] we need and let God come on the scene to
[52:13] answer the prayers of what we have need
[52:15] of right that's
[52:18] right but tomorrow we may today we may
[52:21] need a savior tomorrow we may need a
[52:23] Healer
[52:29] so get in your mind because it's going
[52:30] to be very needful once we get on over
[52:33] cuz see we're still in the Old
[52:35] Testament I haven't brought out anything
[52:38] to tie together these names in the New
[52:40] Testament right I'm using it
[52:43] deliberately the Old Testament but that
[52:45] is types and shadows right when you look
[52:49] back there and see what we have need of
[52:53] right right right
[52:56] now the reason I do it is just like
[52:58] Jehovah gy to
[53:01] Abraham Abraham didn't need the
[53:03] savior he didn't need a
[53:07] sacrifice Isaac was the one that needed
[53:09] to
[53:11] sacrifice to be in his
[53:14] place now bring that on over to the New
[53:19] Testament do you know that that
[53:21] sacrifice only preserved
[53:24] Isaac it didn't say Abraham
[53:31] right it only preserved
[53:38] Isaac all right then down in in in
[53:43] the the
[53:45] Wilderness with
[53:48] Moses he needed Jehovah Gyra Jehovah RI
[53:52] he needed the Healer
[53:56] so God didn't send down a
[54:00] ram you understand what I'm driving at
[54:04] he gives you what you have need of write
[54:06] that down in your mind all right if not
[54:09] on
[54:10] paper so here you are out in the the
[54:14] Wilderness with
[54:16] Moses the snakes come up to bite the
[54:22] people he didn't need it
[54:28] a banner to be raised
[54:32] up he didn't need a revelation of the
[54:34] righteousness of
[54:38] God he needed the
[54:42] Healer so God came down and manifested
[54:47] himself as the Healer that's right and
[54:51] it was called Jehovah Gyra I mean
[54:53] Jehovah
[54:55] Raa I am the Lord that Health all of thy
[54:59] diseases now if you think that didn't
[55:00] work too
[55:02] good you better remember the way the
[55:04] prophet explained it to us cuz we
[55:07] already been able to read it and see
[55:09] it 40 years in the
[55:13] wilderness and the Bible said their
[55:16] shoes growed on their
[55:20] feet read your
[55:22] Bible the Bible says their clothes never
[55:25] wore out
[55:30] I brother around and said one day said
[55:33] Moses was the only doctor they had and 2
[55:36] and A2 million
[55:39] people so now you want to look into
[55:41] Moses's little Satchel you know like the
[55:45] doctor carries a little black bag you
[55:46] know he
[55:48] carry he said look down in there what
[55:50] does it say said I am the Lord that
[55:53] Health all of thy diseases
[55:57] well everything they had need
[56:00] of it didn't come out of a little
[56:02] Satchel bag it come out of the
[56:05] revelation of Moses speaking to the
[56:10] people CU they got in trouble over there
[56:12] one time and what they do Moses told Aon
[56:14] grab your sensor run among the people
[56:20] right they needed all kind of things in
[56:23] the Bible and God would come on the
[56:25] scene for whatever they had need of
[56:32] right now listen to what I'm trying to
[56:34] say
[56:37] then and please
[56:43] listen we that are
[56:47] saved do we need a savior
[56:51] today now come on we want him all the
[56:53] time right all right come on Stay With
[56:55] Me
[56:57] but what do we need
[57:01] today well as many of sick what we need
[57:03] to heal
[57:05] right as many of us need peace well we
[57:08] need that and God will give those
[57:13] things but you see what you and I need
[57:16] is a fresh Revelation from God Amen as
[57:20] to what's going on in this day amen
[57:22] hallelujah amen
[57:26] we can't live the P brings Faith yeah
[57:30] come on but the the P won't bring it to
[57:33] you
[57:34] correctly because it's the Tope of the
[57:36] Shadow right cuz he's Jehovah Gyra the
[57:40] Lord's provided sacrifice that didn't
[57:43] bring Salvation to Abraham
[57:49] right it brought a Deliverance to Isaac
[57:52] come on
[57:54] Amen if you want to go anywh for types
[57:56] of Salvation you back up into the 15 12
[57:59] and 15 of Genesis and get where God
[58:02] appeared to Abraham about it to type our
[58:07] salvation but those things back there
[58:09] were a type right amen but look what a
[58:13] wonderful thing it was
[58:16] right don't you think Isaac was pretty
[58:19] happy right
[58:22] amen he didn't have to die right well
[58:25] Abraham was was pretty happy too cuz he
[58:27] didn't have to kill his son
[58:30] right a Deliverance was brought amen but
[58:34] that did not give Isaac the new birth
[58:40] right he didn't give Abra excuse me
[58:44] Abraham the new birth
[58:48] right it was what they needed for the
[58:51] time
[58:53] right and having the need for the time
[58:56] would
[58:57] speak of what you and I have need
[59:01] of but it must be magnified into a
[59:04] greater
[59:07] understanding even to move into the New
[59:13] Testament if Jehovah Gyra was the Lord's
[59:16] provided sacrifice for Abraham to save
[59:20] his son how much more would Jehovah Gyra
[59:24] be to you and I under the new birth
[59:27] right
[59:33] amen what does it bring to you and
[59:39] I H Moses needed a Healer right
[59:45] right and the Lord said I am the Lord
[59:47] that Health all of thy diseases Jehovah
[59:52] RI but you see to you and I the Healer
[59:55] if actually inside of us right
[1:00:03] amen does not God live in You by the new
[1:00:06] birth that's right
[1:00:08] amen well then where's your
[1:00:11] healer bless
[1:00:14] it that's why I proved the point I hope
[1:00:17] at least it did to my understanding that
[1:00:20] we don't put Jehovah Gyra and Jehovah
[1:00:22] Rea into the same place of the atonement
[1:00:26] we make one higher than the other oh my
[1:00:30] because we confess what the doctor
[1:00:33] says oh my the doctor says you're sick
[1:00:36] all right that that's fine you are
[1:00:42] sick Richard and I were talking about it
[1:00:44] the other day when they told him he had
[1:00:49] cancer son-in-law they told him he had
[1:00:52] that he said I just turned around to him
[1:00:55] and told told him said now Richard a
[1:00:57] negative confession won't you know just
[1:01:00] a confession won't do
[1:01:04] it in other words you confess it right
[1:01:08] amen we need to do that right but that's
[1:01:10] not the Healer that's
[1:01:14] right you confess your way into
[1:01:17] it you keep confessing it until it
[1:01:20] becomes a reality right yes sir but just
[1:01:24] a statement from your mind out is not
[1:01:30] enough but we ought to realize the
[1:01:32] healer is inside of us by the new
[1:01:35] birth then we wouldn't be praying
[1:01:37] somewhere else to get a Healer that's
[1:01:41] right we'd be talking to the god that
[1:01:43] dwells within
[1:01:46] us no we say what the doctor
[1:01:52] says we say the doctor says this
[1:01:56] when I do that on your
[1:01:59] salvation the devil says you're lost why
[1:02:02] don't you confess
[1:02:05] that come on I'm not being sarcastic I'm
[1:02:09] telling it like it
[1:02:15] is you're not going to say what the
[1:02:17] devil says are
[1:02:21] you
[1:02:23] well you I I put it like this the doctor
[1:02:27] tells me what's wrong with me I say
[1:02:29] that's what he
[1:02:30] says right I say by strips I'm Healed
[1:02:34] that's right amen he says I'm this I say
[1:02:37] this right I go to him thank God for our
[1:02:40] doctors
[1:02:45] amen I was over there in in Brazil when
[1:02:48] that brother he he was just coming into
[1:02:51] the message and he was a doctor and he
[1:02:54] was actually a plast what you call
[1:02:56] plastic surgeon for the face you know
[1:02:59] and everything really fancy thing and he
[1:03:04] was telling how that he was that even
[1:03:05] his cohorts was amazed at the way that
[1:03:08] he could cut around where that he knew
[1:03:10] where the nerves were at and that he
[1:03:12] could actually do that plastic surgery
[1:03:15] to your faces and places and not even
[1:03:17] destroy a nerve because he knew where
[1:03:19] they were at and doing you know I said
[1:03:23] Doctor don't you realize that's a gift
[1:03:28] God gave you a gift he sat there and
[1:03:31] just
[1:03:32] cried was he gave you a
[1:03:35] gift thank God for
[1:03:41] doctors but there's plenty of quacks
[1:03:44] too but let's solve the problem there's
[1:03:47] plenty of quack
[1:03:50] preachers like your Prophet said it one
[1:03:52] day he said I find more doctors that
[1:03:56] agree with Divine Healing than I do
[1:03:58] preachers oh
[1:04:00] my now that's what he said about it
[1:04:06] yes why because the truth is the truth I
[1:04:10] told you about that up gam when I go to
[1:04:12] he said they actually some of his
[1:04:14] cohorts said to him one day said how can
[1:04:16] you know as you do all about medical
[1:04:18] science and agree that God is the Healer
[1:04:20] he said he turned and looked back at him
[1:04:22] he said how can you know all you know
[1:04:24] about medical science and not know that
[1:04:26] God is a right amen amen I said Thank
[1:04:30] You
[1:04:34] doc but
[1:04:38] listen what do we have need of
[1:04:45] today now all that we see all that we're
[1:04:49] talking about everything is an example
[1:04:52] right everything is a foundation
[1:04:58] all that we've talked about this about
[1:05:01] the seven compound names of Jehovah is
[1:05:03] just a
[1:05:07] foundation because we brought none of
[1:05:09] them into the New Testament form
[1:05:14] amen and see then you get the wrong idea
[1:05:17] when I say things like well Abraham
[1:05:19] didn't need a savior that was not
[1:05:21] salvation to Abraham it was salvation to
[1:05:24] Isaac
[1:05:25] L those
[1:05:28] years but it wasn't salvation to Isaac
[1:05:31] to give him a new birth
[1:05:35] right it did not bring him eternal life
[1:05:39] right all the things that God revealed
[1:05:42] to those Old Testament Saints and look
[1:05:44] at the marvelous things he revealed and
[1:05:46] the great things happened but not any of
[1:05:48] it brought them a new
[1:05:51] birth cuz Jesus Christ hadn't died
[1:05:59] they couldn't be
[1:06:01] anym that's why they couldn't be Rapture
[1:06:03] back
[1:06:04] there that should be a simple point for
[1:06:07] you to understand and it shouldn't have
[1:06:08] been a a a hard thing when I made the
[1:06:11] statement that that I hadn't preached
[1:06:12] anything about the Rapture in the seven
[1:06:14] compound
[1:06:16] name cuz all I was preaching about is
[1:06:18] what's over Earth right
[1:06:20] now all those sell compound Nam is right
[1:06:24] here even coming down to Shamar meaning
[1:06:27] what his presence right well if he don't
[1:06:31] come here we don't go there right
[1:06:36] right then what should we be praying
[1:06:39] for well I'll figure out one of those
[1:06:42] compound names and it'll fit in there
[1:06:43] and I'll pray for
[1:06:49] that that won't
[1:06:52] work why not pray for the complete
[1:06:55] revelation of all the compound names
[1:06:58] amen cuz you know what they wound up
[1:07:01] being you take every one of them that's
[1:07:03] what I've been preaching every one of
[1:07:05] those compound names comes out to be
[1:07:08] where to bring Jesus Christ upon the
[1:07:12] Earth
[1:07:16] amen all of that Old Testament offering
[1:07:19] those lambs and those sacrifices and
[1:07:22] things was only speaking of Jesus Christ
[1:07:24] right
[1:07:26] you know that that only that didn't do
[1:07:28] away with sin that only covered it just
[1:07:32] you know and it was every bit pushed to
[1:07:35] Calvary that's why the scripture said he
[1:07:37] died once for
[1:07:40] all when Jesus Christ died on the cross
[1:07:43] he died for the Old Testament Saints as
[1:07:45] well as the New
[1:07:46] Testament cuz he had to pay the price
[1:07:48] for
[1:07:53] them but are we bringing it over to our
[1:07:55] day are still talking about oh it's a
[1:07:58] great wonderful thing that Abraham had
[1:08:03] Faith but you know
[1:08:06] what if that's all we know about it it
[1:08:09] should be embarrassing to us to
[1:08:12] realize that Abraham didn't have the new
[1:08:15] birth all that was brought to Abraham
[1:08:19] never gave him eternal life right
[1:08:23] man he toal dependence was Upon Jesus
[1:08:27] Christ to pay the price that's right am
[1:08:30] am just because it was Jehovah gy the
[1:08:33] Lord's provided sacrifice that only
[1:08:35] meant there was a lamb to be supplied
[1:08:37] there am but it spoke that there was a
[1:08:40] lamb
[1:08:47] come I am the Lord that heals all of th
[1:08:50] diseases Moses in his doctor satel to
[1:08:53] heal the diseases of the people that
[1:08:55] only spoke of Calvary
[1:08:58] amen Gideon was a great man of Valor
[1:09:02] raised up that God called it a
[1:09:08] banner that only spoke of what happened
[1:09:10] at
[1:09:11] Calvary cuz you see the seven compound
[1:09:13] names of Jehovah just like what your
[1:09:15] Prophet says about it Jehovah is not a
[1:09:20] name they translated that out of jvh
[1:09:27] they translated Jehovah from that and he
[1:09:30] says in the scriptures by my name
[1:09:32] Jehovah was I never
[1:09:36] known right and that's
[1:09:38] scripture when I told Jehovah Witness
[1:09:41] one day I wasn't making light of him I
[1:09:42] just told him I said Jehovah is not a
[1:09:44] name
[1:09:46] sir well yeah it is it's
[1:09:49] Jehovah I said no it's a
[1:09:52] title right
[1:09:55] it's a title to a name right it's not a
[1:09:58] name thank
[1:10:02] you it was only speaking of Jesus Christ
[1:10:05] that's why when the prophet saw that it
[1:10:07] was such a great thing for him to
[1:10:09] understand that Jehovah the old was a
[1:10:11] Jesus of the
[1:10:14] new making it one true and living God
[1:10:17] right
[1:10:20] amen and then seeing it then seeing him
[1:10:23] manifest himself that dire all of those
[1:10:26] things was only speaking of the day that
[1:10:28] he would walk on earth
[1:10:30] right he's our
[1:10:33] peace he's our Banner right he's our
[1:10:38] Shepherd
[1:10:40] Hallelujah when we took that Wednesday
[1:10:43] night and tried to to show it
[1:10:45] there and save that one to the life of
[1:10:47] the seven compound names with Jehovah r
[1:10:50] r a a h they spell it two three
[1:10:53] different ways that's all right
[1:10:57] to think did you catch what I was
[1:11:02] saying that it took many many books many
[1:11:05] many places for God to cover that he was
[1:11:08] Jehovah jarak to one Jehovah RFI to
[1:11:11] another Jehovah Banner to another one
[1:11:13] Jehovah peace to
[1:11:15] another but we took it right there from
[1:11:18] the 23rd psalm in showing that in there
[1:11:22] in five verses cuz there six verses 23rd
[1:11:25] but the six verses are summing up with
[1:11:27] what was said in five
[1:11:32] verses the psalmist David went through
[1:11:36] all seven compound names of Jehovah and
[1:11:39] there even are 10 compound names because
[1:11:42] you got mananas Manasses you got all and
[1:11:45] all of those is in Psalms
[1:11:49] 23 what about a man catching that
[1:11:51] revelation
[1:11:55] that summed up in five
[1:11:58] verses the entire
[1:12:00] revelation of Jehovah
[1:12:04] God and the man wouldn't even born again
[1:12:07] that received the
[1:12:11] Revelation there was no person in the
[1:12:13] Old Testament in a born again
[1:12:16] experience cuz Jesus Christ had not died
[1:12:18] that's why we read all the other in
[1:12:20] Hebrew cuz he he see you can't have the
[1:12:23] New Testament without you got to death
[1:12:25] to the
[1:12:26] testator right that's why I say to
[1:12:28] people you know turn to the book of New
[1:12:30] Testament they'll turn to
[1:12:32] Matthew that's not the first book of the
[1:12:34] New
[1:12:36] Testament cuz Jesus was still under the
[1:12:38] law in Matthew he why he told him he
[1:12:40] said healed the people they said go down
[1:12:41] there and offer the offering to Moses
[1:12:45] right see the New Testament never come
[1:12:47] into being until the day of Pentecost
[1:12:49] when the Holy Ghost came Jesus Christ
[1:12:51] was that New Testament amen
[1:12:55] and he had to shed his life for that
[1:12:57] life to be able to come into somebody
[1:12:59] why he told Nicodemus you must be born
[1:13:05] again the way we do it is we say well
[1:13:07] what he said to Nicodemus Nicodemus you
[1:13:09] just need to know about all of the
[1:13:11] compound names with Jehovah now you
[1:13:13] think Nicodemus didn't know it the Bible
[1:13:14] call him the original translation called
[1:13:16] him the
[1:13:18] teacher Jesus said th a teacher the
[1:13:20] original translation said th the teacher
[1:13:25] the highest of all the teachers of
[1:13:26] Israel and he couldn't comprehend what
[1:13:28] the new birth
[1:13:30] was of course we Baptist come along and
[1:13:33] what we said well all you got to do is
[1:13:36] believe oh now Paul said have you
[1:13:38] receive the holy ghost S you believe
[1:13:39] that's right that don't mean anything
[1:13:43] not throwing off on the bad is where I
[1:13:44] come from cuz this is what I Su you I
[1:13:46] know what her Doctrine was
[1:13:48] right but you see then according to the
[1:13:51] Baptist Doctrine then Nicodemus was a
[1:13:54] born again
[1:13:56] believer oh my cuz he believed
[1:13:59] everything Jesus said and he brought he
[1:14:00] put his life on the line in other words
[1:14:03] he'd be throw out from being in any line
[1:14:05] of priest or anything if they found him
[1:14:07] sitting over talking to the Lord Jesus
[1:14:09] right
[1:14:10] amen come on am right he put his life on
[1:14:13] the line he put his job on the line to
[1:14:18] get to
[1:14:20] Jesus and Jesus said you must be born
[1:14:23] again what do you you mean I know all
[1:14:25] the laws I know all the rules I know all
[1:14:27] about Jehovah gy I know all about
[1:14:28] Jehovah Rafa I know all about Jehovah
[1:14:31] tishu I know all about these
[1:14:33] things but Jesus said that's not what
[1:14:35] I'm talking about I'm mean you got to be
[1:14:37] born from
[1:14:40] above cuz that's what your original
[1:14:42] translation say You must be born from
[1:14:43] above Jesus was from above right you got
[1:14:47] to be born from where I come from right
[1:14:50] cuz I'm the head of the New
[1:14:53] Testament but you see then do we really
[1:14:56] see
[1:14:57] that what we need is a personal
[1:15:00] revelation
[1:15:01] today
[1:15:03] amen hallelujah of the hour that we're
[1:15:06] living come on Amen and we'll get to it
[1:15:09] this afternoon
[1:15:11] some that's why Paul said therefore leav
[1:15:14] in Hebrews 6 leaving the principles of
[1:15:16] the doctrine of Christ let us go into
[1:15:17] Perfection
[1:15:20] right I'll repeat this evening what I'm
[1:15:23] saying
[1:15:25] therefore let's leave the principles of
[1:15:27] the doctrines of the seven compound
[1:15:29] names of
[1:15:31] Jehovah and all of them applying to
[1:15:33] Jesus Christ and let's go on to
[1:15:35] Perfection come
[1:15:36] on
[1:15:41] Hallelujah wasn't that what Paul
[1:15:45] said but get to the point of what I'm
[1:15:48] saying we talk about a
[1:15:50] Rapture but see Rapture is a revelation
[1:15:53] unto you
[1:15:56] healing is a revelation you can't be
[1:15:58] saved right you cannot be saved without
[1:16:02] a revelation of Jesus Christ amen cuz
[1:16:05] you're only saying the Bible said no man
[1:16:06] can call Jesus the Christ except it be
[1:16:08] by the Holy Ghost that's right amen so
[1:16:10] you're only saying what somebody else
[1:16:12] said the preacher said it your daddy
[1:16:14] said it your mother said it thank God
[1:16:16] for all the says but what is it to
[1:16:18] you is it something
[1:16:22] personal is it something real to you
[1:16:26] come
[1:16:27] on Hallelujah well I'm just in the
[1:16:31] message preach
[1:16:33] brother no oh my Paul said have you
[1:16:37] received the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:38] Since You Believe come
[1:16:40] on have you have you received the gift
[1:16:42] of the Holy Ghost since you come in this
[1:16:44] message come on brother what do you mean
[1:16:46] prove the come in oh my well don't worry
[1:16:48] about you're fixing to leave anyway oh
[1:16:51] cuz that's what people are going to do
[1:16:53] that's right you can't help but manifest
[1:16:55] what you are that's right
[1:16:57] amen you let this thing go on for just a
[1:17:00] little bit longer right amen she's
[1:17:02] dragging pretty low now people are
[1:17:04] walking out
[1:17:06] amen you let her drag a little further
[1:17:08] that's
[1:17:11] right but see those who really have it
[1:17:14] will stay those who don't will be moving
[1:17:16] on oh to somewhere
[1:17:19] else CU they don't know what's going on
[1:17:22] oh Father
[1:17:26] but you see your Prophet said Jehovah
[1:17:28] the old and Jesus is the new
[1:17:31] right so then all of the compound names
[1:17:34] of Jehovah must be applied in a new
[1:17:37] testament form amen as to Jesus Christ
[1:17:44] Hallelujah am I right right I believe it
[1:17:48] he must be all of those things that's
[1:17:51] right but he must be all of those things
[1:17:53] to you and I by revelation amen amen
[1:17:56] before we can talk about going on to
[1:17:58] Perfection oh my you know that Paul
[1:18:00] understood Jehovah the old was Jesus of
[1:18:02] the new you think Paul and him didn't
[1:18:04] understand the the seven compound names
[1:18:06] of
[1:18:07] Jehovah you know that really the
[1:18:09] revelation of some compound names of
[1:18:11] Jehovah would only be based in our in
[1:18:13] doing the New Testament would only be
[1:18:15] based in the face of the father because
[1:18:18] they understood exactly what Jesus was
[1:18:20] talking about after the New Birth came
[1:18:23] that's right amen they didn't understand
[1:18:25] what he's talking about at all right but
[1:18:27] when the new birth came it was brought
[1:18:28] to their remembrance what he had said
[1:18:31] have you read your
[1:18:36] Bible and then they were willing to give
[1:18:38] their life for what they believe that's
[1:18:44] right so then what is a Rapture Rapture
[1:18:46] is a
[1:18:47] revelation
[1:18:49] amen Rapture is a revelation
[1:18:55] what is
[1:18:56] healing how do you get
[1:18:59] healed let's start off how do you get
[1:19:01] saved sa what does the Bible say about
[1:19:05] salvation how do you get
[1:19:08] saved he that cometh God must believe
[1:19:10] that he is and reward of them that
[1:19:11] diligently seek him that's scripture
[1:19:13] right amen but what does he say in
[1:19:16] Romans
[1:19:17] there he said because what confessing it
[1:19:20] with your mouth that's not all of
[1:19:22] it plenty of confessions is made by the
[1:19:25] mouth
[1:19:30] right that's what I said you talk to
[1:19:33] people about Christianity you talk to
[1:19:34] them about one true and living God and
[1:19:36] you know what they'll tell you most of
[1:19:37] the time I can't deny the father I got
[1:19:40] to believe in a trinity if I deny the
[1:19:42] father I'll deny the son
[1:19:45] yeah talk to them ask no about
[1:19:48] it and see what they'll tell
[1:19:52] you but see it says
[1:19:55] what to believe in your
[1:20:00] heart and confess with your
[1:20:03] mouth now what's in the heart must be
[1:20:06] said the same by the
[1:20:09] mouth that's why I quoted that other
[1:20:11] scripture it said he that cometh to God
[1:20:13] must believe that he is amen not was
[1:20:16] that's right he is right now amen
[1:20:20] personal to you
[1:20:22] right and a rewarder of that diligently
[1:20:25] seek him see that's why people don't get
[1:20:28] saved they quote what somebody else
[1:20:31] says now God don't have to to to honor
[1:20:35] what somebody else
[1:20:38] says right you go to him talk to him so
[1:20:41] and so said so and so he'll just tell
[1:20:42] you I don't care what he
[1:20:46] said but go to him and say you told
[1:20:50] me that's right and he'll come right on
[1:20:52] the scene that's right because it's got
[1:20:55] to be something personal to
[1:20:58] you it's not just words letters on the
[1:21:01] page doctrinal
[1:21:04] issues that's right it's believing in
[1:21:07] your heart right that God ha died for
[1:21:11] you and I right and raised for our
[1:21:14] justification as the scripture says
[1:21:16] right and then to confess that with our
[1:21:19] mouth what that he died for me amen not
[1:21:23] that I shout and spoken tongues cried or
[1:21:25] done something
[1:21:26] right oh that's wonderful but that's
[1:21:29] after the baby gets here let's get the
[1:21:31] baby in with life first
[1:21:36] right normal baby what happen when it
[1:21:39] comes forth in the
[1:21:40] womb a lot of times the struggle of
[1:21:42] doing that will make it gasp out and
[1:21:44] start crying but something takes place
[1:21:46] life comes right
[1:21:51] right but then it cries and T what
[1:21:54] because it's a
[1:21:55] baby Christians cry why because they're
[1:21:58] Christians Christians speak in tongues
[1:22:00] why because they they're Christians
[1:22:02] right Christians see Vision why cuz
[1:22:04] they're
[1:22:07] Christians but don't try to base it on
[1:22:09] something you've done
[1:22:14] right based on what God Said
[1:22:20] right but you see that's hard for people
[1:22:23] to do they can't do like I've told you
[1:22:25] my experience of two years after coming
[1:22:27] in this
[1:22:29] message to not claim that I could read
[1:22:32] six books a day and listen to two tapes
[1:22:33] would be my salvation not claim that I
[1:22:36] could explain the one true and living
[1:22:37] God to the letter back there
[1:22:41] too but I based it on a personal
[1:22:44] experience that I had after 2 years amen
[1:22:46] of confessing
[1:22:48] it well you sure what's slow I guess
[1:22:50] that's about right I am I still am now
[1:22:54] bless
[1:22:56] I got something Hallelujah and what I've
[1:23:00] got is Hell me after all these 40
[1:23:02] something years come
[1:23:05] on but it's held me to the
[1:23:09] word it's hel me to the
[1:23:13] word then I can read back there and I
[1:23:15] can see Jehovah the old is Jesus of the
[1:23:19] new and then I can read that Jesus
[1:23:21] according to Paul said is not I that
[1:23:22] liveth but what
[1:23:25] the Christ that liveth in the the life
[1:23:26] that I now live in thee flesh I live by
[1:23:28] thee faith of the
[1:23:29] son cuz who's living in you Jehovah Gyra
[1:23:34] Jehovah
[1:23:36] RI all the seven compound names are
[1:23:38] living inside of you by the new
[1:23:40] birth we don't have to go somewhere else
[1:23:42] to try to get it it's not that you got
[1:23:44] to pray it down from
[1:23:46] heaven come on it's inside of you come
[1:23:49] on Amen it's in thy mouth as Paul said
[1:23:53] right the word of faith that we preach
[1:23:56] that's right Hallelujah but we must say
[1:23:59] from the mouth what God says
[1:24:04] right that's where our trouble's
[1:24:07] at we say what somebody else
[1:24:11] says we talk about what somebody else
[1:24:14] believes put it in your own oh my thank
[1:24:20] you see I'm honest you this way explain
[1:24:24] to me your Revelation amen thank you
[1:24:27] don't tell me brother Brown said so and
[1:24:28] so and so you know that's fine I
[1:24:31] understand but tell me what's in your
[1:24:33] heart that's right
[1:24:36] amen tell me something personal about
[1:24:38] yourself come on
[1:24:45] Amen cuz see Rapture is a revelation
[1:24:49] amen for you to be saved it must be
[1:24:53] revealed to you
[1:24:57] Amen Brother D I've never had a
[1:24:59] revelation I say well
[1:25:01] then I'm just as honest as I can be I
[1:25:04] know one man one time said something to
[1:25:06] me and I offended him because I told him
[1:25:08] I said people are saved don't act like
[1:25:10] that come on he walked out the door and
[1:25:12] didn't come
[1:25:14] back he said I degraded his Christianity
[1:25:17] no I
[1:25:18] didn't I just told him the
[1:25:21] truth right right
[1:25:24] I mean brother Donnie if I told you
[1:25:26] would say now you they know about you
[1:25:29] you out drunk you done all these things
[1:25:31] and I said Christian don't act like that
[1:25:33] did I degrade your Christianity no you
[1:25:35] didn't have
[1:25:36] any that's as blown as I can
[1:25:39] be if you had it you wouldn't do
[1:25:45] that what you brother Dale you offended
[1:25:48] brother so and so for what for telling
[1:25:51] the truth come on
[1:26:02] listen the seven compound names of
[1:26:06] Jehovah all right now they all had an
[1:26:09] Old Testament application I'm trying to
[1:26:11] get it down a quit right they all had an
[1:26:14] Old Testament application and every one
[1:26:16] of them was to people that were not born
[1:26:20] again right
[1:26:25] now you
[1:26:29] agree there were the people that were
[1:26:31] not born
[1:26:36] again well now if we're born
[1:26:39] again how much greater should those
[1:26:42] things be to you and I right
[1:26:51] amen do I need to say it over and over
[1:26:53] and over
[1:26:56] I know I do a lot I repeat a lot because
[1:26:58] I want you to think about
[1:27:02] it it didn't bring Salvation to
[1:27:06] Abraham it brought Deliverance to Isaac
[1:27:13] right it never brought Abraham the new
[1:27:16] birth
[1:27:24] you couldn't do that in the Old
[1:27:27] Testament you had to wait till Jesus
[1:27:29] Christ came and
[1:27:31] died to be able to have the new birth
[1:27:34] now I'm not saying they were
[1:27:37] lost I explained that what they done
[1:27:40] pushed to Calvary and Jesus Christ paid
[1:27:43] for that right amen not saying they were
[1:27:47] lost no but I'm saying they wouldn't
[1:27:50] born again that's right amen cuz that's
[1:27:53] the New Testament amen the New Covenant
[1:27:56] amen which would require a New Birth
[1:27:59] come
[1:28:06] on listen
[1:28:15] L each one of those things of the seven
[1:28:19] compound names of
[1:28:20] Jehovah only spoke of of what was to
[1:28:25] take place in the New
[1:28:27] Testament all
[1:28:29] right each one of them was dealing like
[1:28:33] I said about Jehovah is not a name see
[1:28:37] Jesus was the name they didn't name him
[1:28:39] Jehovah when he came right and the Bible
[1:28:42] said it's supposed to name him Emmanuel
[1:28:44] come
[1:28:44] on right right is that Bible right his
[1:28:48] name Shall be Called
[1:28:50] Emmanuel and you know out the four
[1:28:52] writers not one of them named em
[1:28:54] Emmanuel that's right and Paul of all
[1:28:57] his writings and the thing he never
[1:28:59] brought it to
[1:29:05] that why because what was the name of
[1:29:08] Emmanuel Jesus Jesus God what was the
[1:29:12] name of Jehovah
[1:29:15] Jesus the first time that it was
[1:29:19] spoke to a human mortal right by another
[1:29:23] human mortal right it brought John the
[1:29:26] Baptist to life that had been dead in
[1:29:28] his mother's wom Hallelujah he hadn't
[1:29:30] moved or anything read your Bible that's
[1:29:33] right it brought life the first time
[1:29:35] that it was pronounced
[1:29:39] amen it because now get me come on the
[1:29:45] word Jesus I'll show you where the
[1:29:46] Prophet said this so you went on a
[1:29:48] problem with it amen don't have it with
[1:29:50] me but the name Jesus has been used many
[1:29:52] many right
[1:29:56] that wasn't a a thing that it waited
[1:29:58] until right there at that point and in
[1:30:00] the name Jesus just happened to appear
[1:30:02] no no the name Jesus was used many many
[1:30:05] times before
[1:30:09] then that was that was a
[1:30:14] name but when it was spoken by the lips
[1:30:17] of a mortal
[1:30:18] being that had an experience come on of
[1:30:22] knowing what that name was
[1:30:24] it brought
[1:30:26] life
[1:30:29] right that's why you can say Jesus Jesus
[1:30:31] and not get
[1:30:33] nothing you pray Jesus Jesus but who you
[1:30:37] praying to come on Brother come
[1:30:40] on well brother D I'm praying to the
[1:30:42] second person so he can take care of it
[1:30:44] with the third person and all these
[1:30:46] secretaries and I I just don't agree
[1:30:48] with that no you know how secretaries
[1:30:50] mess everything
[1:30:52] up right all they got to do is
[1:30:55] misunderstand the boss and they write
[1:30:57] the wrong letters right that's right and
[1:30:59] they send out to places and they send
[1:31:01] things and some of you that are
[1:31:03] secretaries are grinning because you
[1:31:04] know it's happened that you send out the
[1:31:06] letters to the wrong people because
[1:31:08] you're
[1:31:09] secretaries you don't know what the boss
[1:31:11] wanted you're only reading off the paper
[1:31:13] and you
[1:31:14] misunderstanding and you goof everything
[1:31:16] up right I don't want no
[1:31:20] secretary I want to talk to the person
[1:31:23] all right
[1:31:25] when I talk to Jesus I'm not saying
[1:31:27] Jesus will you take this and deliver it
[1:31:29] up to the father I know who I'm talking
[1:31:31] to right and his name is Jesus
[1:31:36] amen where did the Rapture I'm going to
[1:31:39] end it right here cuz I won't get it
[1:31:40] this evening now it'll be later where
[1:31:43] did the rapture
[1:31:45] start right amen well it started in 63
[1:31:52] I well
[1:31:54] you sure didn't listen to the series I
[1:31:56] preached
[1:31:57] on when did he start his second
[1:32:03] coming he started his second coming on
[1:32:06] the day of Pentecost
[1:32:08] right it will climax in this age the
[1:32:12] Revelation and the doings will climax
[1:32:14] here right right but he's been coming
[1:32:17] all the way there
[1:32:24] when they received the new birth on the
[1:32:25] day of Pentecost I thought the Bible
[1:32:30] said that they were
[1:32:32] resurrected sitting in Heavenly
[1:32:35] places in Christ Jesus
[1:32:40] Hallelujah now remember what I'm saying
[1:32:43] just what it took me a long series to
[1:32:45] preach on the second
[1:32:47] coming that there's plenty of things
[1:32:49] that take place in this day
[1:32:52] yes and the rapture could not have come
[1:32:55] until this end time
[1:32:57] yes but the Rapture started on the day
[1:32:59] of Pentecost when the baptism of the
[1:33:01] Holy Ghost came into the hearts of the
[1:33:03] Saints because it resurrected them and
[1:33:05] set them in Heavenly places the Rapture
[1:33:07] is inside of you
[1:33:10] amen cuz it's a revelation
[1:33:14] amen it's a
[1:33:17] revelation I'm just leave that part but
[1:33:20] I want you to think on that the Rapture
[1:33:23] started when the day of Pentecost came
[1:33:25] with the Holy Ghost descending CU it
[1:33:27] raised them people up into Heavenly
[1:33:32] places but there's a lot to the Rapture
[1:33:34] that's got to take place because
[1:33:36] according to the prophet of God and the
[1:33:38] Bible there's like three things that
[1:33:41] take place in the Rapture right the Lord
[1:33:43] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:33:45] shout voice of an archangel of trumpet
[1:33:47] right and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:33:49] first and we which will arive and
[1:33:51] remain will be changed right
[1:33:54] so there's a lot to take place don't go
[1:33:58] say brother Dale says the Rapture is
[1:34:00] just the new birth I didn't say that
[1:34:02] right so you're
[1:34:04] lying I never said that the second
[1:34:06] coming of Jesus Christ was just the holy
[1:34:08] ghost coming on De Pentecost I never
[1:34:10] said
[1:34:12] that I said it would have to climax
[1:34:15] because if it don't climax in this day
[1:34:17] that's why I've been reading that
[1:34:18] scripture over every service this is the
[1:34:21] sum of what I'm talking about right this
[1:34:24] is a summing up of all the message that
[1:34:26] your Prophet has brought in all the
[1:34:28] scriptures and over 40 years of
[1:34:30] preaching on it this is the sum of it
[1:34:32] don't think I'm backing
[1:34:35] up you're going to get out on the limb
[1:34:38] when you do
[1:34:40] that yes but brother Dale it's very
[1:34:42] simple I thought it was supposed to be
[1:34:44] so simple that an that an illiterate
[1:34:46] child can understand it
[1:34:55] the days of
[1:34:58] Simplicity that's why people don't
[1:35:00] understand me I preach simple and they
[1:35:02] try to figure me out of something
[1:35:04] deep very
[1:35:07] simple cuz I'm very
[1:35:12] simple-minded I try to relate everything
[1:35:14] back to
[1:35:15] you I got a note from a person from
[1:35:20] today and they listening to the seals
[1:35:22] that I preached in 198
[1:35:25] 2 said you got a unique way of trying to
[1:35:28] make things instead of it being so great
[1:35:30] big out to people that you make it
[1:35:33] simple thank you as being in our hearts
[1:35:36] and lives
[1:35:37] right why is it not that way that's
[1:35:43] right but you see if something has to be
[1:35:45] revealed Brother Gary now listen to me
[1:35:49] something has to be revealed to you
[1:35:50] brother Gary you know what that means
[1:35:53] you didn't know it right is that simple
[1:35:56] enough if it's something to be revealed
[1:35:58] that means you didn't know it you may
[1:35:59] know all the mechanical lineup right you
[1:36:02] may know all the quotes right you may
[1:36:04] know all of the statements
[1:36:08] right but it's not revealed come
[1:36:13] on that's just like so you come up here
[1:36:17] and I say anybody need to be prayed for
[1:36:20] and you come up here well I'm not not
[1:36:22] going to say that I'm sick

[1:36:32] walking up here come on right then you
[1:36:34] going to turn around and say I'm not
[1:36:35] going to admit I'm

[1:36:41] you well I'll tell you the doctor said
[1:36:44] what's
[1:36:49] wrong come on well brother Dale that's
[1:36:52] reason I don't call you

[1:37:03] my cuz I'm sick brother Dale and you
[1:37:06] tell me that no I don't tell you're not
[1:37:08] sick I tell you I know you're sick cuz

[1:37:17] sick but you see we like to make them
[1:37:20] great big
[1:37:21] confessions confession is fine if it's
