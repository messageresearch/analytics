something that they will take with them for years to come amen praise the Lord Jesus and and uh some of us who worked there did a lot of walking doing security for the void knows about it hey man I got almost 20 000 steps just in one day one day so uh uh so it was good it was good it was good exercise but uh just every aspect of a camp you know is for the furthering so the gospel for the for the young people right it doesn't matter if it's the Cook or if it doesn't matter if it's the security uh it's in order so that the young people can get the word amen so I believe that that brother boy did a wonderful job brother Aaron did a wonderful job and it was just wonderful to to be able to see and to meet other brothers there as well while we were working together amen no matter what differences we may have had we were just working together for one common goal I mean that was that was so that the young people can get us experience with God hey man praise the Lord so we appreciate your prayers and uh I appreciate each one of those uh one of you brother John thanks for filling in Sunday and we just appreciate each and every one of you remember us in your prayers this weekend we'll be in in Saint Augustine Florida uh we'll be ministering down there so you just remember us in your prayers um I'll be interpreting there at the ministers meeting there on Saturday Friday night I'll be interpreting for for for a uh uh special meetings that they're gonna have during this weekend as well and so I'll be there Friday Saturday and then coming back Sunday so we'll be heading straight to the wedding on Sunday then just remember us in your prayers as we travel so let's go to the where where this this evening how many love the word amen praise the Lord Jesus I want to speak this evening on a tale of two sons amen a tale of two sons and we want to read from Luke chapter 15 Luke chapter 15 and we're going to start at verse 1. first one the Bible says then Drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him now I want you to I want you to notice that who was coming to Jesus to listen to him in his word and it was we see here that it was the publicans and the Sinners came to hear him and then in verse two it says and the Pharisees and scrubs murderers saying this man received the Sinners and eateth with them so it wasn't just publicans and sinners that were coming to go hear Jesus it was Pharisees and scribes that were there to listen to Jesus as well so keep that in mind that when Jesus gives these the following Parables and then we're going to talk about the The Prodigal Son uh uh and and concentrate on that but when he gives these Parables and when he talks about this he's talking to two different people there at that moment he's talking to the publicans and to Sinners and he's talking to Pharisees and the scribes the ones who thought that they were right the ones who thought that they were correct that you couldn't put anything on them because they followed the law and he was right there talking to also the Sinners and and and and and and publicans and they were there glad to hear him amen so just keep that in mind in verse 3 it says and he spake this Parable unto them saying what man of you having 100 sheep if he lose one of them does not leave the 90 and 9 in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it and when he had found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbors saying unto them Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost Hallelujah I say unto you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over 90 and none just persons which need no repentance and then he continues here with the parable of the lost coin either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece does not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she had found it she called her friends noticed that in both Parables friends are being called rejoicing is done and and seeking is done in order to find what was lost but it's not so in the parable of of the of the of the of the of the uh the the Lost Sun the uh the parable The Prodigal Son and when she had found this she called her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found this the peace which I had lost likewise I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repented amen over one sinner amen so what did the brother Brandon say one soul is worth ten thousand worlds sometimes us as preachers we get so hard on ourselves because oh we're only preaching to one person and one person is just enough how God wants is just one person with one person he turned the world upside down with Paul with one person he can do more than we can do with a 600 member congregation praise God all he needs is just one person will you be that one person amen I want to be that one person tonight praise the Lord Jesus so let's let's bow our heads our heavenly father we just thank you once again for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word We Appreciate You Lord your word father and Lord I pray that you would just forgive us father for our sins and our iniquities or anything Lord that we may have said done or even thought Lord that was not like you father place it under the blood of Jesus Christ and we pray Lord that you would uh just guide us Lord this evening as we Endeavor to look at some things here in your word father God this is your word Lord you're the one who spoke these Parables Lord and I pray that you'd help us to understand them Lord God let us get in a fuller understanding from your word father than than what we came with it tonight Lord Jesus granted Lord Jesus meet every need amongst us heal every sick one father God and bless Lord those that just made their the effort for the Lord to be here father not to hear a man Lord but to hear you Father the Son of Man would just commit ourselves now into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you may be seated appreciate your patience amen all right so I want us to take a look here at at the at the parable of the Prodigal Son because when we when we read the prodigal son we normally concentrate on the part where the prodigal the the younger son leaves the house and comes back and is restored and all that is good and we're going to talk about that but there is an element to the prodigal son or to this to this story which is the the the the the older son that we sometimes overlook and what is would Jesus talks about him in there there's a reason why he talks about him in there and of course it has to do a lot with what the younger son the with the younger son so let's continue reading here in in Luke chapter 15. and uh we're just gonna we're just gonna read and just and just comment as as we read this this evening praise the Lord it says here in verse 11 and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that followeth to me all right so when when we look here this the younger son is there's there's a portion that is allotted to him now there was an older son and the older son was supposed to get the majority of the portion of what his father what his father what was you know what he was of his estate of his father's estate so the older son he got like two-thirds of of of of that portion while the younger son only got one third so what the younger son is asking for is give me that one-third or give me that portion that belongs to me right and and and and and so he says here give me the portion of goods that falleth to me now during that time if you're just looking if you're if you're looking at at the history of Jewish Jewish history during that time mainly people the way they showed that they had wealth was by the lands that they had the cattle that they had the the the properties that they had that was mainly how they showed how they showed their wealth so you can pretty much think that that the way the way the father was going to give this portion uh to his son was that he needed to go and sell a piece of land or something in order to give him what what what he what what his son what his son required and his father did not deny him that portion man and in order for him to do that normally the father had to die how how else how else are you going to get somebody you know what's what belongs to you in a will if the father does not pass away first right and here is the same thing right but the father without having passed away still goes ahead and gives him what he was he what he's asking for so what the son is really doing if you think about it what the son is really doing is he's wishing that his dad was dead come on think about it what he's really doing is that he's wishing that his dad is dead so that he can go ahead and get that portion and I know sometimes as as as as parents Saints sometimes we we go through hard times and we go and we feel like that's what our children desire of us just because we're trying to train them in the right way that they should go right amen but you know God God is working things amen and God works in mysterious ways praise the Lord and so it says here and he divided unto them and he divided unto them his living and so so the younger son was basically wishing his dad was was dead he wanted he wanted the father's things but he didn't want the father he wanted the father's things but didn't want the father now when you look here at the word at the word here uh uh uh property here in the next well if you read the in the NIV version that this is what the NIV version says the younger one said to his father father give me my share of the estate so he divided his property between them and then when you look at that word property is the word Bion and and it and what it means it's a primary word which means life the present state of existence by implication the means of livelihood so basically what this son is trying to tell his dad then I want you to tear your life apart so that I can get what belongs to me how many of us parents have ever felt that way I want you to just go ahead and just tear yourself apart break break your your status in in society so that you can go ahead and just give me what I desire yeah some of a lot of us would think my goodness that child just needs wow but that's not what the father did now remember the Father Here types our heavenly father you always have to think that yeah and so normally the way we as parents our first reaction but I've always I've always heard this that normally the first reaction the way you react uh the way you want to react to something the first time is usually the wrong way that's probably not the right way to react right because we don't stop and pray about things we don't stop and think about what we should do and normally our our flesh will react in a way that usually leads us wrong so we must work on that amen right but thank God for the holy spirit that helps us Amen to think according to the word and help us react accordingly praise the Lord Jesus well maybe you came to hear something else tonight but this is what you'll hear amen so in those days that the land a man was a man's wealth in those days so what so that the sun was really trying to tear this father apart and the father went ahead and did went out of his way to make sure that his son that he loved so much got what he was gonna what he what he needed amen praise God he literally tore his life apart in order to cater to his son all right amen sometimes I mean I wish I wish somebody our children amen could see amen that you literally amen sometimes sacrifice sacrifice yourself and have sacrificed yourself all your life in order so that they could get the best when and then as they get older amen they they forget all that they don't see that until they have their own children then they realize wow my mom and dad were really trying to amen they actually he bought he bought that bag of Funyuns and he never ate them so that I could have them exactly he he literally did that for me not just using that as an example because we bought a bag of Funyuns this weekend and my wife was asking me where's that bag of Funyuns we never opened them and and we're like where's it at I think we left them at the hotel room Brand New Bag of Funyuns we didn't tip the the the cleaning lady but she got a Brand New Bag of Funyuns though so amen all right let's continue and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country now watch what it says here that not many days after that after the sun came to the to the father asking for his inheritance for his one-third portion not many days after that the son the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living now we're not going to talk about all that he did all that he got involved in maybe he got into a business and was trying to make money and maybe he went out and uh and went and spent it all on prostitutes I I don't know we don't know but that's not the point because whatever he did the father didn't look at that and neither mentioned it to him when he came back that wasn't his concern it was the concern of the older brother but it wasn't the father's concern all right that's not the point amen whatever your children is doing whatever is going on whatever's happening that's between them and God there's nothing that you can do about it hey man you put him in God's hands and leave them there leave it there and God Amen will take care of the rest you just be salty before your children you be salty and you love your children no matter what son daughter I'm here for you I'm here to to to talk I'm here to whenever you want to come back I'm right here for you amen amen I'm not here I'm not going to give you a lecture I'm not going to tell you give you a powerpoint presentation to tell you what you did wrong or not nothing like that I'm just gonna I'm here to love you and I'm here to listen to you first praise God our children will appreciate that amen amen sometimes we want to give them a PowerPoint presentation about every single point of the things that we've learned in life and in reality that it never lead them to they don't care about that right because they got to have their own experience that was your experience that's not their experience amen they're interested in wanting to have their own experience and sometimes it takes for them to have to go out this way I'm not I don't want them to neither do you but sometimes that's what it takes for them to go out amen and experience what it is amen the Hard Knocks of life amen the the hardships of life oh my I gotta really save money in order to get this and that yeah you do amen and that you don't get things for free forever amen now it's your turn to pay that back for that bag of Funyuns that used to be a dollar ninety nine now it's 3.99 because of inflation four bucks yeah yeah now they they're they're they're a little bit more careful now how they spend their money yeah all right praise the Lord and their wasted something without this living when he and when he had spent all the Bible says when he had spent all all the money that he had gotten the one third portion of his father's wealth he spent it all now I don't know how much he how how long it took for him to spend it all he might have spent it in a year might have took him six months might have taken him 10 years amen but he spent it all right and there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began and he began to be in want yeah kind of like we're seeing now amen and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that Country Now I want you to also think that that when as we're reading this you know we're reading in the physical but think about it also in the spiritual yeah because he had spent it all yeah is that we've given it we maybe we've given it all to the world we've done all and there now there's a there's a famine even in the land for for the true word of God that's right I mean the people really want to hear the word of God I mean our young people really want to know what the Bible says not just our opinions and our theories and our and our challenges to each other yeah because that's what it was like a couple of years ago it's just challenging each other and see who knows more about the word of God but that's not what it's all about it that won't change young people that won't give them Holy Ghost and that won't change you amen who knows more than the other about the word who's going to speak the third pool morbidden no that that that that has nothing to do with it amen it's about changing lives it's about about receiving the Holy Ghost praise God it's about living like Christ amen Christ wasn't there to challenge anybody people were challenging him amen praise the Lord and when he had spent all those their Rose of Mighty fowl right we read then and he went and joined himself to a citizen of the country and sent him into his field to feed swine now in those days you know you know for a Jew to be with with with pigs it was a horrible thing they didn't even eat them much less be around them and he would feign and have filled his belly with the hus that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself and I like what the NIV version says that when he came to his senses yeah and he said how many hard Servants of my fathers have bred enough and to spare and I perish with Hunger I want you to to look at this uh uh parents and I want you to I want you to see that he came to himself right he came to his senses he didn't stay in that condition the whole time right amen he finally came to his senses he finally that word that he received at some point in time in his life amen something sparked in him and he remembered that amen right amen so our children they've heard the word I mean our kids they've heard the word now let that word do a work in them amen amen let that work do a work and then let that word do a work in them because that that will change them from the inside out you see that that was the father wasn't there amen telling the Sun come on get come to yourself come on no finally he sat down when he was in terrible hardship when when everything was gone when he'd spent all his money at prostitutes and there was nowhere for him to even work or anything like that he finally said you know what I need God he finally said I need God I will arise and go to my father now now you notice that he did not say I will go home because his father was his home he he left home but the relationship he broke was with his father right and so he said I will go to my father and I will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee amen the father was home that was home that was that was what he was missing amen that relationship with his father and and Saints you know home home isn't home isn't just a place it's not a physical location it's not your house that's just that's that's home is a home is a relationship amen home is a relationship that we have with one another my family is my home that's right amen you could take away my house you could take away my cards you could take away everything but if I'm missing my family amen I don't have a home you don't have a home if there if your family is not there and so that's what this sons was saying he said I will go home I will I will rise and go to my father and he was planning his mind while he was going to tell him he was thinking in his mind this is how it's going to be I will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee amen and I will go home where I'm belong Where I Belong where I'm accepted amen home for us is where we belong and where we're accepted amen home in the word that's where we belong that's where we're accepted in the Beloved amen amen you're never rejected and when when you come with a True Heart praise God hallelujah in verse 20 it says and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet I love that word but but because if there was a problem before but amen there's a resolution after but amen but is a conjunction that that that makes that that that brings a solution afterwards or it could bring a problem too right but it's a conjunction in this case it was a solution but when he was yet a great way off it doesn't say that he was from here to the doors and he was a great way off a great way off amen watch what the father did his father saw him now most of us fathers amen we would probably we'd probably see our son I mean we're probably there working on our car and we and our son did that you know did what he did yeah and we'd probably be there some better have something good to say you better come in here with something good he don't cause all kinds of nonsense in my family he better have something good to say let's see what this boy got to say most of us would probably do that what our fleshly and instinction that's what we would do it right well this this boy did me wrong I might wait until he actually rings the doorbell before I open the door I ain't gonna wait to open the door I'ma wait till he rings the doorbell and as a matter of fact I'm gonna wait until he talks on the doorbell camera before I actually open the door laughs but that's not what the father did look what the father did his father saw him and had compassion all right man and had compassion and watch and ran and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him now remember his son had done already took in one third of his wealth of his estate his land his his status in in in in the in the community that was already gone but the father didn't care not one bit about that while he was concerned and why he loved most is that his son was returning now I I was looking at this part right here where he talks about that he ran and it's very interested in in Jewish tradition amen because why did he run Jesus brings in there why did he run and there's a reason why now according to the talmud there is a ceremony performed that's called the kizazza all right now this is what this ceremony is if a Jewish son married a gentile woman or he lost his inheritance among gentiles and then returned home the family and the community would perform a ceremony called the kazaza they would break a large pot of fruit in front of him and yell you are now cut off from your people the community would totally reject him not just the community but the family as well amen so what the father did basically because in those days the a man you know with this book because we see that this father he was a man of status he had money all right he was and his garments you know a man you know children ran back then maybe a woman or girls you know they might run back then but a man of that status a man back then didn't run especially man of that status because they would be showing their their legs and it was just embarrassing for them to have to pick up their skirts to be running everywhere you know so a man didn't run it was it was it was kind of like a shameful thing but this father didn't care about that this father picked up his Curts and ran to his son amen amen and and watch what he did he met him outside of that Village outside because he saw him from far off he met him outside before he come into the city because he knew that if he would get to him first before the village would get to him then he could restore him and he'd bring him to his home nobody would know but then once the people and the people in the community would know that the father restored him right they couldn't perform the ceremony this kazaza ceremony because why the father had already made the choice to restore him amen they think about that so I like it because the Bible you know Jesus gives these little these little things and he ran and and fell on his neck and just these little things they're there for a purpose so so the father basically he embarrassed himself he embarrassed himself Amen in order to go restore his son amen by lifting up his skirts in public and showing his legs in order to get to his son first amen the father was not interested at all and publicly shaming his son he didn't care about him being embarrassed he just didn't want his son to be embarrassed I wonder let that sink in parents you shame your your children in public that's not the attitude of this father that's not he was trying to protect his son who deserved all kinds of of of of of of uh of uh you know punishment of rejection yet the father does everything to protect his child isn't that what we're supposed to do as parents we protect our children no matter what the cost we don't shame them whatsoever because in general later on that's gonna hurt them more than to help them just think about that amen in verse 21 it says and the son said unto him father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and I'm no more worthy to be called thy son amen this is what the sun said this is how he felt praise God and so what the son was trying to do here is what the son was trying to earn his way back to the family but the father didn't want him tearing his way back that's what the father was not interested in earning his way back he said I'll I'll make sure yeah to do it for you hey man watch what verse 22 says but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet amen praise God he wanted him to have the best no matter what he had done no matter what he had gone through no matter how much of his father how much his son had embarrassed him he wanted him to get he wanted to give him the best see the father wanted to let his son know that he was going to be in charge of fully restoring him now this is kind of like a it's kind of like a process of adoption amen if you think about it and what does the road represent it's a robe of righteousness right a ring gay man the ring had the father's seal on it a man of that status back then had a certain seal it was a family seal on that ring And that son amen was he he didn't deserve that but the father gave him that ring and not only that he told his servants of the house come and put that ring on my on my son and also come and put that robe on my son amen a verb of righteousness a ring with the father's seal and shoes yeah amen which means that he was prepared and ready praise God he was prepared and ready now maybe the son may not felt that way but some probably didn't feel that way he was probably still I can't believe my dad is doing this to me I can't believe I can't believe this is happening to me when I'm supposed to he wanted to work for his dad in order to pay him back what he what he lost he didn't even want to be his son but the father wasn't interested in him he said no you're not going to be like one of my hired servants you're going to be my son because you are my son and let me publicly demonstrate that you are my son you're not going to you're not going to serve me you're going to be served amen hence the reason why he told his servants Amen to go and place these things on him amen parents I don't want you to think that your child is gone yeah amen he or she they're only getting prepared amen for for what's coming ahead for them that's right amen I like that song that brother Michael sang last time amen he's there just working on their testimony he is only working on his testimony amen she is only working on her testimony amen there have they have to go through something in order for there to be a testimony there has to be a test in order for there to be a testimony praise the Lord Jesus father here wasn't concerned about anything that the son had done now remember Jesus is the one telling this this this this Parable here and the father represents the heavenly father so how much should you and us you you and I parents should be with our children gracious oh we're gracious with everybody else but we're not with our own children well our own children well we treat them any old way hit them upside the head shame them and do all kinds of stuff but we'll show Grace to everybody else you're you're breaking the word you're breaking the attitude of this father because as Jesus is telling this here to us amen he's trying to show us he's trying to show us a relationship issues issues that are going on between parents family members and and and and and and and and so we need to look at it that way amen all the different aspects amen all right verse 23 and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry this is the father continuing the gifts for the for the for the son for the son that didn't deserve it for the son that spent all his living for the son that was in sin and everything here he brings in the fatter calf now the fatter calf is when you look in the scriptures is only killed and eaten only on special occasions only on special occasions they would they would let set aside a little calf atten him up over time and when a special occasion came I mean it had to be a real special occasion they would take that fatted calf and kill it and eat it share and they would invite the whole Community I mean it was a it was a Throwdown yeah yeah it was a party of parties because it was expensive during that during that time people the the Jews back then they didn't eat a lot of meat right right and if they did eat meat they would they would you know they would find the the you know how we we look at Walmart you know we're looking for the the cheapest meat now you know yeah the the ground beef you know ground beef you're looking at you know it's now uh what is it uh as seven sixty is 70 fat you know six seventy twenty or whatever you know that I think that the more fat it has the the cheaper it is right yeah like sister and said it's supposed to be eventually they're gonna make us eat bugs just just see what what Bill Gates is saying about that yeah and you don't you don't believe me you think that's just a conspiracy theory they talk publicly about it about eating bugs and feeling it they're feeding it to children now at schools and they're using Hollywood stars to promote it too yeah yeah I just hope that we're out before that amen yeah but the fatted calf amen they it was for a special occasion and this is what the father was asking to be done for this most disobedient unworthy unfaithful unjust sinner boy who didn't deserve nothing this is what the father was asking him but you know what you know sometimes we think of people that way and you forget where you came from amen you forget where the things you did when you were younger the sins that you committed and yet you were received by people yeah and most importantly by God for this my son was dead and there's a live again he was lost and is found and they begin to be sad doesn't say that doesn't I began to be married amen and this my son was dead now we we see here that he wasn't physically dead but he was spiritually dead which is what the father was saying and is alive again amen praise God now watch so we see here that that Jesus is talking about the the stops talking about the younger son and you think that maybe everything is is done maybe the family's restored back and and uh everybody is happy and they lived happily ever after without one-third of the father's uh portion of course but that didn't matter to the father you know that didn't matter because all he cared was that his son was back right but it wasn't that way and in act two right an actor you know how in stories they have Acts this is that was act one now in act two man amen Jesus continues he says now his Elder son was in the field and as he came and Drew nigh to the house he heard music and dancing I mean they was throwing down up in there it was it was a it was a I mean they had a party she talking about man it was it was good food it was good music it was good Fellowship everything was good but the Father the Son wasn't there the older son wasn't there and verse 26 says and he called one of the servants the son did and asked what those things meant in other words he asked him he said hey what's going on in there now his son was in the field and maybe he was maybe several days working I don't know maybe he was he was but there seems to be a disconnect there with the family because he should have known that his son his brother had returned right right because I don't think that that happened killing the fatted calf and and putting the ring on the finger and all that stuff happened in within within an hour yeah yeah it probably took several days so where was this brother there was some sort of Disconnect in the family already on from his part there was something already building up in him towards his father that he didn't like right oh come on and we got to be careful hey man with the little things this is the little foxes that spoil the vine little things that build up over time and it's usually the ones within the family that we started we have issues with ones within the family and this is what happened here and this is what was happening here with his son things were building up with with the father things were building up and he called one of his servants and asked what these things meant and he said unto him thy brother is come the servant was telling him that brother has come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound Amen in other words he told him the good news and isn't that good news that's wonderful news but that's not how the son received it right now in order for his son to receive it in in the way that he says it here in verse 28 something must have been already gnawing in him and he was angry look at the look at the attitude of his son and he was angry and would not go in so now the younger son had already assaulted the family so now it was the turn of the older son now to assault the family it was his chance to assault the family now therefore came his father out and entreated him now I want you to pay attention to that because the father did to his older son exactly what he did to his younger son he didn't wait till his older son went to him amen he came to his older son to try to talk with him when he found out that his son had that attitude and wasn't in there in the festivities and and in the rejoicing of what was going on he was he was worried he was concerned and he went looking for his older son found him outside like this foreign my father's the fathers one-third of a portion spent it all in harlots did everything or that and now they're using my portion to give this this boy a party [Music] yeah this is exactly what he was thinking is that right they're using my portion in other words he was not concerned about his father being happy about his younger brother coming in he was concerned just like his younger son he was concerned also about getting what he could get out of his father but not about the father himself I wonder if we're that way if we are because let me tell you this son the oldest son did everything he was supposed to do he was good he went to church got there 30 minutes on time prayed made sure that his mom and dad saw that he got to church on time made sure everything I mean he was but his heart was not in the right place right right yeah after that he did everything right so you could do everything right for the wrong reasons right and you can do everything wrong as well just like the younger son but this shows me and this is what Jesus is trying to show us that they both needed repentance they both needed God one wasn't better than the other one one wasn't wasn't higher than the other one just because they were able to do everything amen some of us come in here I mean sometimes running 30 30 40 minutes late amen some of you all get here on time that doesn't make you better than somebody else amen because God knows your heart God knows what's really in your heart why why you do things and why why what's the purpose of you doing things to be seen or do you really want a relationship with God I want y'all to think about that in light of this story what's the purpose of you doing things that you do is it to be seen and please those around you or is it to please God amen and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and entreated him he talked to his son amen his son this son what he was saying in his heart was I will not be part of this family I'm the heir and I don't want to be in the same family with my brother in it that's what he was saying that's why he wouldn't come in so the father came to him just as just as he went to the to the younger son amen it's always God seeking us amen we're never seeking God there's always God seeking us looking for us because he he's concerned about relationships he he doesn't care about your do's and your don'ts and what you do or don't do that's good but but he wants your heart first where is your heart that's what's more concerning about to him because you could do every single thing just right and your heart be in the wrong place I ain't gonna help you in life they won't help you even with the people at church with your family eventually you will show what's really in your heart at the right time the right moment comes and the right things happen you will eventually show what's in your heart [Music] so make sure that your heart is right amen because out of the abundance of the heart speaks the mouth out of the abundance of the heart Jesus said is what you will do amen and he answering and so I I wanted I wanted to show this that that Jesus says here that the father didn't treat one son differently than the other there was no preferential treatment there yeah isn't that what we're seeing all right so it's not it's not good parents oh my God I better be careful when I tread on this but it's not good parents we treat one child better than the other that's not going to lead anywhere good look what happened with Jacob they did and look what happened to his family so don't give preferential treatments treat them just the same love them just the same they have a soul just as much as all your other children do they need God just as much as your older one does or your younger one does they need God you know I wanna I wanna let my children know that I love them just the same and we know our children we know that sometimes some of our children they they they're different I mean you know with with with with Bella you know we we have to be a little tougher on her a little bit you know more she was a little bit more hard-headed more strong-willed right yeah and I think she's learned with Zoe all we have to do is just look at her and just kind of and I mean she was crying I didn't have to pull my belt off I didn't have to do anything amen and yes because of that reason she did not get as much spanking and as Bella has told us this foreign she did not get much spanking but it was because we knew that that's what worked for her right right so you know your own children you know how you can deal with one to the other amen but don't do one thing for the other and not for the other one they both are doing the exact same thing they're both causing the same problem I have the same attitude but yet you prefer one over the other that's wrong that's wrong that's not teaching neither of your children anything right and it's it's wrong before the eyes of God and he answered in verse 29 and he answered and said to his father Lo watch what this older son says hello and when you read this here in in in in the NIV version this verse 29 look he says but he answered his father look all these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders he doesn't even call him father at least the younger son called him father even though he went out into the world and did everything he still had some sort of respect and called him father this older son right here you could tell that he already had something with his dad that he wasn't liking and he tells him low doesn't even call him father Lo these many years do I serve thee neither transgress Ayah any time that commandment I was a good boy I was a good daughter and yet thou never gave us me a kid that I might make Mary a kid that I might make Merry with my friends but watch what he continues saying his bad attitude I mean he was obedient son did everything good but he has this bad attitude why because it was coming from his heart it was hiding in there all these years and eventually at the right moment it came out that's right it eventually it came out but as soon as this thy son was come so he don't even call him his brother as soon as this my brother he didn't say that no he said as soon as this thy son in the NIV version says when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home you kill the fattest calf for him he's concerned about his own estate his own well-being not even concerned at all what his dad is feeling for his younger son coming home matters of the heart right here it's matters of the heart you can hide it all you want for many years eventually the right thing will happen and it'll bring it out of you just let it happen here to this older son you just wait is it all my child will never do that my child you just wait until the right moment comes whatever was hiding in there in their heart that's what eventually come out if they haven't gotten God I mean they'll play the part for years and you know what I'm not exempt from that either I'm not saying I'm you know my children will never do these things amen that's between them and God I've given them amen I've told them you you got to have your own relationship with God I can't always be there supervising every single thing that you do amen God knows but I know that that word amen that God's put in your heart amen that that we have preached for years amen that's the word that's going to change you right I can't change you Mommy can't change you hey man the pastor can't change you the preacher at the Youth Camp can't change you it's got to be the word of God Amen that changes you amen and when that change takes place that's a that's an enduring change hey man that will last do you think that this young son amen he left the house again after all the grace that he was shown after all that he had done doesn't say but we are just assuming that he did right because the father let God be God amen you th areas the father just let God do the work and God took care of the rest amen amen so he says here but as soon as this dark sound was come which I devoured thy living with harlots he start he's the one who starts naming his sins look what you look what he does I mean isn't that what we sometimes do we keep record of what people do at church I mean we make sure we write it down too I mean it's in a notepad somewhere came in 30 minutes late oh Wednesday came with his shoes untied um I mean we just keep track of it when the father God himself wasn't doing that didn't even mention it to his son well the word of God is still the word of God amen amen so this brother refuses to acknowledge his brother as part of the family this brother was mad that his father was using his inheritance in a way that he didn't approve of because because that was his inheritance that fatted calf was part of that older brother's inheritance it belonged to him maybe belonged to his dad because he was still alive he wasn't going to get that fatted calf until he died but it still belonged to him so so when the dad tells him and he said unto him son now the the he wasn't called father by his son but his father calls him son he says son ever with me and all that I have is done I mean that was literally true remember he didn't have the one-third portion anymore because his son his younger son had already spent it so that was gone but that wasn't even in his dad father's mind the two-thirds portion that was there was belonged to his older son so when he told him son everything that you have everything that that I have is yours that was literally true when I die everything that I have everything that you see now it belongs to you it says and all that I have is done it was meat that we should make Mary in other words it was important that we should make Mary and be glad for this thy brother he he tells him that this is your brother he didn't say he's this thy son look what he did but now his father tells him this thy brother remember he's your brother remember she's your sister he's your brother watch how you treat your brother and your sister all right remember he was dead and there's a love again and was lost and is found and Jesus stops right there leaves us with a cliffhanger almost and leaves you guessing what happens next leaves you to your imagination to think what's going to happen next what happens does the brother get restored with his with his younger brother the older and things you know and move on for the common cause of the family for the common cause of of of of of of of of the work amen or does he just leave separating and severing severing more of the family amen so I want you to think about this in the last few minutes that were there that we're that we have that Jesus amen he was he remember he was talking to publicans and he was talking to sinners all right the publicans and the Sinners represent the younger son right the older son is represented by the by the old uh uh by the Pharisees man how do you think those Pharisees felt when he was tucking those things because this story wasn't just a feel-good story that you so that you can boohoo and cry the old younger son came back with it that's good and that's part of it but he was trying to make a point and you sometimes think you sometimes think Jesus is just all about love and he's just all about no he he's about publicly shaming people when they need to be publicly shamed all right sure yeah yeah all right bro when it's deservant of it because this is what this is the the Pharisees were a bunch of Hypocrites see in their mind they're thinking that they're good works and everything they felt like they were slaves to God and that God was just their master and and they and if they just did everything exactly by the law everything amen that they would get in but see in reality they were trying to be their own savior and not depending on God the savior they were thinking that they were dependent on God the Savior but in their attitude of their heart by their works and by the things that they were doing and and the disgust that they had for the for the publicans and the Sinners and the prostitutes and everything like that amen you see from the heart speaks the mouth Jesus said so see from their heart God knew where their heart was even though that they did exactly everything they had the exact the long hair exactly the way they did they were the phylacteries everything amen and you couldn't put one thing on them physically you couldn't Jesus could amen because he knew their heart and God knows your heart God knows your heart so here the older son is represented by these Pharisees and these the older son he worked hard for his dad he'd obeyed him he did everything amen but in the end there was a heart problem there yeah now the younger brother he was trying to obtain the father's wealth by by breaking the rules he was forcibly asking his dad give me what I did what I did by breaking the rule by being a bad son and God gave it to him his father gave him what he was while the older son was trying to obtain the father's wealth by being good and then doing what he was supposed to do but both of their hearts were not for the father those are their hearts were for material things and external things amen I like silence silence is good amen both both needed God just the same that's what Jesus is trying to tell us both needed God just the same your good works ain't gonna get you in your obedience to your parents all your life and and and and your and you come in 30 minutes early to church that's good and that's what we need to do that I'm not trying to say we don't do that but that won't help you in the long run if your heart's not right so the older brother was thinking that he was getting in by his Works was looking down at the younger brother who was needing Grace that's what the Pharisees were doing with the Republicans and the sinners looking down on them when when they when they needed Grace amen and I want you to I want you to look at this because what the older brother should have done if if the older brother really loved his brother his younger brother the way he should what he should have done is that when the older brother went out the older brother should have gone he said that don't worry I'm gonna go out and look for him I'm gonna go out and seek him I don't care what is going to cost me I don't care if it cost me all my inheritance I'm gonna find him because that's my brother that's my flesh and blood that's that's part of me just as much as it's part of you but that's not what the older brother did the other brother had already had maybe some sort of Vendetta towards his towards his younger brother and towards his dad because all he was thinking was about himself amen and isn't that what Jesus did for us remember he is our Kinsmen Redeemer he he our older brother yeah that's what he did he came looking for us he came seeking us he came he gave up his throne of Glory he gave up his inheritance he gave up everything that he had amen the peace and everything in order to come find you amen in order to come find you because you were the younger son you were the one who needed restoration you were the one who were out spending money with it with harlots and and and and and and overspending and spending and living living righteously and he knew that and yet he still came for you what a great older brother we have once I have an older brother like that amen well you you and me have him our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I never had a brother I always say I grew up with women in my in my household all the all of my life it's not a bad thing don't get me wrong you know I grew up with two sisters my mom my dad he worked third shift a lot so I was the one who was in charge of the house pretty much Tom was always around women and girls all the time and now is the same thing [Laughter] it was like God was training me I mean I have my wife I have my two daughters and even our dog is a female [Laughter] surrounded but you know what I wouldn't I wouldn't change it for anything else because I know that was my portion God prepared me for that amen amen amen maybe with a son I wouldn't be able to handle him but see God gave you a son because he knows that you could handle it all right praise the Lord Jesus amen so he became our Kinsmen Redeemer amen he became me that I might become him by grace that's what the older brother should have done he should have become amen what his younger son was going through in order just to win him that's what Jesus did and so see Jesus there speaking to the Pharisees and to the publicans and the Sinners amen I'm sure the publicans and the Sinners were just receiving that word and so you wonder you know how did the story end because Jesus Lives leaves us there with a cliffhanger you know you wonder how did things happen what what happened if the older son represented the Pharisees what did the Pharisees end up doing to Jesus so maybe that was the way the story ended up in the family I don't know but I'm so glad that we have an older brother this evening amen I'm so glad that we have we we have a redeemer parents don't fret don't don't worry my sister Rachel was singing that song you don't have to worry amen commit him into the hands of God just like the father did that's it just like the father committed him hey man eventually all things will work together for the good to to them that love God and if you know that you love God then everything that's happening now amen is not the end of the story amen it's not the end of the story God is in control amen amen amen how many love the Lord amen let's send to our feet why don't we sing this song he became me that I might become him by grace to stress her I'm not sure if there's a key for me there for that song it's page 239. 239 if not we'll sing it in E flat C okay let's do c [Music] he became

whatever you're doing amen God can provide for you and restore you fully because that's what he wants to do his love [Music] let's sing it one more time oh ye became me that I might become him my grace oh thank you thank God for the father he became [Music] in my grace he took my place [Music] oh he became me that I I've become in my grace [Music] hallelujah amen praise the Lord let's just bow
