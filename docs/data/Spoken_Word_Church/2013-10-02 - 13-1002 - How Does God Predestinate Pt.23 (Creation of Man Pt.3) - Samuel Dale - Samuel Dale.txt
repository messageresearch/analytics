Just Have Your Way come tonight and then speak to us as we try to speak about you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in Jesus name amen Romans 8 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate than he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us let's go to Genesis 1 26. and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the hour and over the Catalan over all of the earth and over ever creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his in on image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now remember as we get on into the part of talking in a little bit that God created you know them they Adam and Eve as we call it male and female as we called it but keep that in mind and don't think about that that there was just one part there and we'll try to get to that you know and try to understand now we spent a lot of time talking about predestination and how that it's by God's foreknowledge in those who he did for no he could predestinate and now we're still as far as our thoughts and our concept of the poor we're talking we're still back in uh the eternities and coming out tonight and coming down you know we've had a little company lately so we had to kind of change things around I don't mind that sometimes I think it's very needful for even you here for me to back up and and review some things and and then we'll try to carry on with the with the thought but I hope it's in instilled in your mind enough by now to what we've read and what we've we've talked about that God is revealing himself it's not a condescending or a coming down of God is you know that's wordings that we use but it's really God revealing himself to mankind and as he reveals himself to mankind see these things were a hidden Mystery man probed at it you could get certain things you could study things as Scholars could bring out wordings and and Mankind could speak on it but it was a hidden Mystery until the end time to be revealed in this last days and we thank God that he sent us a prophet to where the word of the Lord could come to him and we could receive things that even a man with great abilities is pro Gap and you know the Bible even says that the prophets desired to look into the things that you and I see amen the things we talk about as simple things of one God and different things like that the the prophets desired to look into those things you know and we're chosen to bring what they could but yet they could not bring it all into fullness but then it would wind up in the end time that God would send a prophet to be able to show us these things and we could do as he said that we've used off a Christ a mystery that he could go back into the back part of God's mind and speak of the things that were sealed up before the foundation of the world and speak to you and I and they become common everyday language I guess you'd call it to you and I because it's things that we talk about that you know that is simple to us and uh you know in doing that we've had 40 something years to study a prophet's message so we ought to at least have a little bit of understanding you know and uh it uh it would be a shame to be based to base it on the fact that we didn't know because we've had so much of a time and an opportunity to be able to understand but now we spent a good bit of time talking about how that God is revealing himself to mankind and as he's doing that he's bringing forth his attributes his uh nature his ways his being and coming down to you know to where we can understand and and just taking a simple prophet's message you know and talk about how that Our God dwelt Alone but then from him came forth a form of God not another God but a part of God went out that would be called logos theophany uh Holy Spirit it would even be called a son of God but yet he didn't definitely believe in Eternal sonship so it's not dealing with that see it's the Eternal God revealing himself in another form just as we are father son human many forms of us but we're only one person right right it's being made known and it can't be made known all at once you know I mean when when brother dick there was was a baby laying in the Cradle all he could do was call him a baby he couldn't uh uh there wasn't no granddaddy there you know in him it was Debbie and him daddy had brought him into the world then you say well his DNA was back in granddaddy that's fine but it brought him into the world well he couldn't do anything there he was not a father he was not a grandfather he was not a husband and we had the form of being a baby all right see then as time brought to pass he and morphed from one form to the other going but it was the same person not many people there's not many gods just one God but he's unveiling himself get the message the unveiling of God and then listen right after then to the Mighty God unveiled and put those together and listen to what he's talking about you see it's like I've told you now we believe in God not uh say moving as much as revealing himself he's revealing himself because we're looking back there we can't see logos we can't seek theophany we can't see the Son of God that went out right you can only see it by Supernatural eye and that would only be by way of the Prophet because the word comes to the prophet you can say well I saw him back there as a baby well that that might be true but remember the word comes to the prophet all right but now looking at it then we see that God is he's a supernatural being and how can you explain the supernatural being but you can't even comprehend a supernatural being unless you become one right right I mean wouldn't it be something for us to walk up to Einstein and try to tell him how to you know run a light bulb and make it that'd be something wouldn't it well you wouldn't even have time fool with you because you know but yet somebody that could comprehend what he was talking about I heard the story told said it wasn't but one man and he was an old drunk that hung around with him and you know said he could kind of follow him because why because I mean who can talk to a man that says if you're standing here and you're looking out that way and you're looking that way with unlimited eyesight you see the back of your head yes boy that's crazy you know I might see a long ways but you know see you couldn't comprehend what he'd be talking about and that's the way God is but yet take Mankind and down through the uh abilities of teachers in school and and then you get into what is the word physics and and and all of those things you get into all of that by the teachers and gradually it unfolds of what Einstein was talking about well that's simply what we're trying to do in studying the message of our the Bible the prophet's message is to understand him as he begins to reveal himself bring himself into a a form that you and I can comprehend see then it's not another God it's the same God revealing himself all right now see we talked about that little white light and how the first that went out from God was a logos he calls it the anointing go ahead with number one questions and answers on Genesis paragraph 28. and look what he calls it he said we're standing on the banisters watching now that's just wordings right watching what God's doing meaning we're we're seeing by by the eye of the Holy Spirit because you cannot see any other way right the things that are back there all right now so we're standing on the banister watching and the question and things about brains said no man has seen God and now the next thing we begin to see by eyes are Supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there what is that that was called by Bible readers blow gosh are the anointed or the anointing or the as I was going to say the part of God began to develop into something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it was it was a little low a little light moving he that was the word of God now God gave himself birth to this son watch which was before there was ever an atom you know or anything like that and Jesus said glorify me with the glory that I had with thee before the foundation world God has given birth to a son but now that son remember is God in another form not another God not a second person it's God in another form called a son logos anointing but good to it in a minute to where did he'll use the word theophany all right but we're not trying to show how smart we are by words we're trying to comprehend an eternal God that the Bible said it could be understood that the prophet would go tell a simple illustration you know you're a father you're a human you're a person and there it unveils the godhead the great thing that's been a mystery to mankind can be revealed by simple terminologies if we take that and allow the Holy Spirit but remember now the Bible is not written to the world it's not written to sinners it's only written to the people who have the Holy Spirit the inside teacher right you can have the outside teacher all your life and not do any good look at gamalia and Nicodemus and all of them you know all the great that they had but they couldn't comprehend but yet we don't even have an education you know at all compared to theirs and yet we can understand God but remember now he reveals to whom he wants to be wants to reveal that's not uh some kind of a predetermining to choose certain that's a fact that he knew who would so now we've done been through all of that it's not just all of the doings we're not through with predestination don't forget that because we've got to get down out of the eternities and down on earth into a a form of mankind in the natural before we can even talk about predestination right because where we're at now we're in the eternities talking about the Eternal God and seeing how that that God he he was lonely right he was lonely he had attributes in him he desired those attributes to be known he desired to be a father he desired to be a Healer he desired to be all of those things for you and I and just think about it we are now fulfilling that desire it has been being fulfilled down through time we know that but yet we are in the end time when it's all going to be made known what a wonderful opportunity to sit here and understand the Bible and it unfolds all right now go ahead with number two because we were on this one the message we've used these quotes but of some of it but I just want us to think about some things now prior to this in the paragraph before he's explaining that God is created the animals the leaves the trees that they so paragraph 51 so he couldn't just leave it in that state see in other words he had a world he had a the animals he had everything but he couldn't leave it in that state so he said let us plural make man plural now what if he'd have said let me singular make man plural that wouldn't work would it that would not be in His image right or if he said let us make man singular you see when you you started out and saying well I'm gonna get through in a hurry tonight I'm gonna run through these quotes tonight and get through this because I've had these quotes laying and they have back there two weeks now or more this is part three I guess that we're on this I mean on the part but look what he says let us plural make man plural in our own image and let us make man in our own image so then when God made his first man he was a spirit man look he was something on the order of God or the son of God the Lord gosh that was the first man then he gave this man jurisdiction over see that to lead to all the animals just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today now think of this in a little bit he gives his spiritual man rule over the animals but when man is made in physical he is a ruler of the animals he's the god of the Earth right right all right but see he makes man in a with a spirit man he was something on the order of God or the Son of God the little god well because that's who he was he never took something else and made a son that's what we think about we think that the the part that we're talking about let us make man we'll get to it later on in the message or that run around and said he didn't make man you know like one man he made not all mankind after this one way right he never made all mankind after his own image come on he never made all mankind after his own image he made one man the man Christ Jesus right simple terminologies not the man Jesus the flesh the man Christ Jesus who created all things and by him was all things made he was the creator what the son of God civil terminologies yet we we we cut ourselves off see because we thought well we just can't understand it just wait a little while and they didn't speak to you but you see if God was a logos if God was the anointed or the anointing or what he then what is this man that he makes this is not the physical creation of man that happens in Genesis 2. which takes place in Genesis 1 at the end of the sixth day of the creation of animals and life all right we haven't got down to speaking of the natural man being created we're still talking about the spiritual man and by looking at that we see that God never predestinated anything wrong amen we haven't even dealt with dealt with him as predestinating yet he never predestinated this uh son to come into being right then if he created man in that image he never predestinated that right that was his desire that was his whole thing you see why I do believe in eternal life I do believe that eternal life you have received by the new birth always was eternal and is a part of God it's God in another form amen amen called a son a bride a wife a many many titles can be laid upon the children The Offspring see because this spiritual man wasn't made on the sixth day spiritual man was made before the foundation of the world right that was one of the morning stars that signed together the sons of gods are shout for joy that's why Jesus could say I knew you before the world well that's pretty that's that's predetermined no that ain't Predator we ain't even got any to it yet we ain't got to the predetermining redetermining his Earthly matters come on predetermining his Earthly situation time existence I'm still talking about the Eternal God and to see that if he made a man in that image and we saw Sunday there in the message from Blasphemous names that when he did put Adam into flesh he breathed into his nostrils eternal life now Adam never came with eternal life Adam was standing there the prophet said and God breathed into his nostrils amen eternal life he said church I haven't got to that because we'll go back to it when we get to it go on through Blasphemous names and listen to him where he said Church borned by the Breath of God like Adam was breathed into his nostrils and he become a living soul he said he breathed on the day of Pentecost into the Bride of Jesus Christ eternal life you see it's hard to keep from going on that way and I put in enough to where that at least those listening won't just keep running a channel and think well he don't know what he's talking about he said well I know I don't know what I'm talking about but I know a God that knows what he's talking about and that's who I'm dependent on right but look what he says on the next one now remember it let us plural make man plural do whatever you want to call it whatever words you want to use he made a two-part man or whatever you want to call it Adam in the natural was male and female but in his spiritual creation said let them now hold on real careful Eve was in Adam right agree to that and we'll get to it in a little while that she was in him in theophany but just remember if that theophany had eternal life that's the eternal life you and I must have okay hold on to that point so look what he says this is taken from George to Father 1953 16 uh paragraph e65 and when he made everything that looked nice and good to him now he said let us plural make man plural and own image what was he he was a supernatural being so what did he create a supernatural being right okay there's the one that could not be seen God the father never was seen never will be seen he'll never be seen as what we want to look at him he'll be standing there we'll know who that is we'll know that's the father why because that's the revelation all right and there he is and now here's the son what which is a logos that went out of him Made In His Image supernatural being that went out in the beginning now you can argue and say well he's talking about that that went out of him the amorphy to come forth that's fine it's a supernatural being but look where he goes right to let's make man in our image actor he made a man in his own image he made a supernatural being yes indeed Genesis 1 28 I'll get to that scripture later read and see if that isn't right and then when he made man in his own image he had rule over the Beast he led the beasts around then like the Holy Spirit supposed to lead to church today he's leading us go on to the next number four which is taken from who is God that's a good message to listen to the whole message of course all of them's good to listen to right on what we're talking about E20 1958 15 who is God then we're going to make this second man I want you the first man you can't see him now he just said to take before that we read that you couldn't see the father all right we have used on a message the other day where brought around and said God's first creation was himself then out of him went to logos it's simply showing and revealing God all right the first man you can't see him he's God second man was a Halo there's your your uh Speech coming out now he takes a third man it makes him like a little white cloud coming over we can see him Holy Spirit coming down and he's all man that's the soul of man Eternal then huh yeah there's never been but one Soul eternal amen so you can see what we're talking about the Genesis 1 26 and 27 man is one man the soul of almighty God the theophany the logos the speech the all in all amen dividing himself into a multiple form of him making it to Christ all right let's go on just a little so now remember what we're talking about God the way he come into being talking about how man comes into being because man is made in the image of God all right and look what he says look at number five questions and answers on Genesis 53 7 29 paragraph 43. he got all those things together and made and made all the other things all the animal life the birds the bees the monkeys and whatever it was put them all here on Earth and then he asked this question let us who let us who father and son word and spirit almighty God revealing himself huh make man in our own image now if a man was made something like that little sacred light Yonder or something like that it could not be seen which is a spiritual being he manifests or unfolds himself down a little more and to make a trinity of himself a father Son and Holy Ghost our solar spirit and there was God in himself now down into now God unfolding himself this is not coming of me and you he says not this we're talking about this is not Samuel Dale you're talking about this is the Christ the low gospel Son of God the image of who that were to be made here was God unfolding himself now into let us make man which was his son and Offspring on him man in our own image he was a supernatural being and let him have dominion over the cattles in the fields and so forth now I love this part look what he said the voice of God out there the voice of man rather watch him would speak and say call the cattle this way call the Sheep over this pastor call the fishes to the water so he had Dominion everything obeyed him what about the voice of God the voice of man the voice of man is that God but around him said you take a born-again Christian take the word of God place it on his lips and speak it he said it's deity speaking right yes amen you see where we're living so far below our privileges I said we all of us are living below our privileges they shouldn't be a sick one in this building tonight I blame myself as much as you the only thing I know I can do I told you years ago any preacher can preach if you want a Revival in just making you jump up and down and shout and run out I can preach it if you want healing to take place and just healing I can preach it if you want salvation just for the children I can preach it well brother that we need well let's put them all together right and that way we're not stopping on one thing because with the restoration of the word what comes a restoration of Power with the restoration of the word comes what the Sons and Daughters of the Living God to speak the word of God the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God see we can approach it from one way I'm telling you and you know the reason I can tell you that I watch it of these preachers that are out there and I go home and weep and cry I see these preachers that can get people to the pulpit and get them to Salvation I see preachers that can get healing don't you signs and wonders taking place and I'm not saying that's wrong I'm saying it's all right but that's not the full manifestation that's not what you and I are supposed to be dealing with that's right we're supposed to be coming taking the word and speaking God's word and that's where we're all failing well brother Dale I wish we were that well I wish we could have a little I don't have enough time to slow down I'm sorry if I'm wrong you can get you another Pastor anytime you want it I'm just me and I've seen it 40 years ago and I've hammered at it ever since and any of you that's ever been here with me you know that's what I've done is hammered at the opening of the word the revealing of God's word trying to get you and I to see that word and stand there and let that word inside of us speak out and see it even create we've seen the dead raised we've seen the sick healed would you think well all you ought to do brother Dale brother dick here he's he's on up in age he'd like me to preach him back to a young man well the only way I know to do it just keep on going the way I am you think I don't love my wife and and don't cry when I hear her screaming in pain but yet I've got to keep on preaching when I'm preaching amen because within that is the healing and that is the new birth and that is the chain to the body you think I don't think false I try to Pastor a group of people and to get them to see God but it's just like I told Brother Carly years ago I said brother call him my goal we was coming back out of South Carolina and I said my goal is to preach to you the word of God that if something goes wrong that you can't find brother Dale brother mold or whatever that you'll be able to stand on the word of God that's my desire to preach the word to look into the things the prophet said and go into the things that others are scared to speak about evidently they must be scared they don't speak about it I don't have a back lord of sermons you know laying down okay forgive me forgive me for being me that's when I told my wife one day I was only just forgive me for being me she said how am I going to forgive you for being you she didn't know what I meant yeah I mean I just what I am and forgive me you know okay let's go on to the next one what was God all right if we're going to be in the image of God what was God all right now we're going to get to something in a minute that you're gonna wake up a little bit or close me off one see I believe that God can be here tonight in many forms and just be one God he can be here to heal he can be here to save he can be here to deliver he can be many many forms and yet still be that one God now we're going to talk about God being a theophany now remember in Webster's and things you'll find the word theophany will be dealing with really a body of a deity you know that's as good as you can come up with but think about what happened when that great Eternal God the self-existing revealed himself as not moving over into another form or a part of him went out like an arm slinging off but yet he simply in Morpheus into another form and he's a little white light the prophet says he's a Halo he's a logos speech but now listen he's done this this way we didn't so there's no argument with him he had to take a form there to be able to speak so he stepped forth in a theophany he had a body that's what I told you I really enjoyed down at the Passion Play that time when that was the way they had it always start off at a certain thing they started off in the creation and you could you know it was just like floating around everything was without form and void it just moving and all at once out just stepped a man and the man said let there be you know they done the best they could do about bringing the world et cetera the things and and then all at once that man just disappears and they started a baby crying in a cradle well you know when that man reached about 30 years of age the Earth Stood on Earth the one that stood back there but Ryan said Moses saw the back part of God in a theophany that was the same God that walked ashore to Galilee but he said you can't see my face because see you couldn't see the face of God and live that wouldn't work so he could move over into another form so remember what happened in the garden that this great Eternal begins to reveal himself make himself known and he's a light and then from the light steps her body a theophany and begins to speak let there be huh and if he does then coming into being is the things that he spoke around said he believed his own word I love that how can you comprehend what a prophet would say he'd say in the beginning before the Eternal now how in the world are you going to get that kind of language down to understand it in the beginning before the eternal the only thing I can say is that we we use the word Eternal for a circle but back before it was ever a circle he was almighty God all right but look what he says just think of it is there two eternal life we're on number six yeah you couldn't answer that could you there's one eternal life and that's the life of God this other kind of life no matter what it is it's got an end to it anything had a beginning has an end but anything that had no beginning has no end and God said he would give us eternal life without beginning we were just made a part of him this man is just a part of him all right and actually the life that's in US wasn't brought here by human nature nature gives us Spirit but that Spirit died and we got the spirit of God glory to God what was God was God a man said certainly let us make man in our own image what was God but the offney body yeah what was God but the off any body you couldn't see him we'll get to it there's no way to be able to look at him at what we're talking about except by the eye of faith you can't look at him and see him it's by the eye of faith look what was God a theophany body and their man was made like that and put over the garden now when Adam was put in the garden the spiritual atom not the physical man now we're still not there yet okay he would be called a random God at low God Son of God speech uh supernatural being Holy Spirit theophany All For Adam mm-hmm and he ain't brought a thing into existence yet because this is before the foundation of all of those things all right watch him and their man was made like that and put over the garden but there was no man to till the soil in the senses then he created man Out of the Dust of the Earth in the animal life and that man till the soil and the man fell by transgression correctly and God the theophany come down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem the man God the theophany came down to dwell were in Jesus Christ right to redeem the man all right now go ahead and number seven entombment 19. 19 and 57 420 the entombment program 77. the Bible said he ascended he went and preached to the souls that were in prison they repented not in the long suffering in the days of Noah now this has proven what God is all right to see what we are his soul his Spirit his theophany of his being run theophany and you'll find it's 44 times I think and a lot of those I can give you laying on the desk at home is dealing with the coming into the being of Jesus Christ going to hell to pay the price for you and I but he sold his Spirit his theophany of his being went down and you know what they could look at him and see him he wouldn't have just a floating cloud but it was his soul his theophany the spirit of his being it was almighty God that went to hell for you and I but it was the soul of God come on that's why he's a creator of all time not to flash me in there come on the spirit man the Christ Colossians 1 Hebrews 1 John 1 read them James 3 and verse when I'll get that one where it says that Jesus Christ created all things so that had to be the Creator God all right would you like to follow him a few minutes let's see where he went just below the regions of mortal beings lays this realm of the demon power below that just below that lays the soul to the unjust blow it lays the very domain of Satan hell then just above us lays the Holy Spirit and in under the altar lays The Souls of the just men and the next is God himself one going downward one going upward the two Spirits are here on Earth influencing the people of the Earth because I'm sure it's in here I'll get to it in a minute but around said he went to speak to those in hell that were he went in theophany and he said they were in theophany the center has a theophany has a place to go to which is his soul the body don't go to hell Spirit don't go to hell it's the soul of mankind see we don't think about a soul being real we think our souls at each Square compartment with some kind of little spot but around said Moses saw the back part of God called it a theophany a man that was the back that finally took the stripes for you and I not that physical back that physical back was not there come on this is theophany you can't beat a theophany you can beat the person that's in there's no way to kill her theophany even God has to destroy the soul of mankind eventually nothing else can the following let's take a quick trip for six thousand years then we'll jump back to this we'll bring this back later okay go to the next one go to 7A this is Israel in the church and here he goes torn Riven Torn to Pieces he saw what to God listen God blessed him and then Israel returned back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that comes into every believer to sanctify clean up the Mind clean up the heart and leave a portion of the holy spirit in there he said yeah but it's so we just got through reading it do I need to read it again if so went to hell first then his soul went to God right did not he raise and go up all right come on look what he says the holy ghost in the his soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into every believer to sanctify clean up the Mind clean up the heart and leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in there we only have a portion of the Holy Ghost well because we had all that we'd be God so we have a portion of the Holy Ghost which is eternal life that makes us a child of God is this time manifest in a many membered body right that's his form now watch I love this here and there and when the Holy Ghost is given out you know when he's given out amen so this not running out right but all he's going to give out not running out of it but all he's going to give out will end in the last days in Redemption be over now you go to the Jews you go to all of the other things all right all right and when the Holy Ghost is given out that same Holy Spirit that brought the body of Jesus out of the Grave will Rapture and that Covenant has to dovetail has he torn here and gave the body went back to God and the Spirit came back to the Earth then your spirit will have to be the same kind of spirit or it'll miss that place going together amen yes sir not cause you make yourself not because you make yourself but because what something the love of God is swept into your soul and tore every Earthly out there it is the soul of mankind go ahead still talking about God and the fact that he's a theophany questions and answers on Hebrews part 2 57 1007 paragraph 412. here's his body was in the grave and his soul was in hell now do you need these because I've got them at home I don't think I put it in here but brother Ryan said on Calvary that God tore the soul out of that body it wasn't gone up here reaching down here poor now he exited out of the body come on the anointing that came on him on the River Jordan wrote around and said left him in the Garden of Gethsemane but it didn't leave him as though not being God he was God on the cross he said into thy hand I commend my spirit my soul is troubled in the garden there he was still almighty God that Holy Spirit came back on the day of Pentecost into your soul and my soul that's why we're not just anointed ones that comes into your spirit come on here his body was in the grave and his soul was in Hell preaching alive what about that he was in his theophany again his soul was down there with those people that were in theophany also and was witnessing to them that they repented not in the long suffering remember a while ago we read it where he said one is going downward one is going upward the one that's going downward has a body to go to who does work goes to hell it is your body is it your spirit or it's your soul that goes to hell it's the soul of mankind because what is it this finally destroyed the soul of mankind has finally destroyed because that's his body until he gets to the place he's not in his physical it's down in the ground right and see Jesus's body was laying in the grave but down in hell he was paying the price for you and I your soul was in hell his theophany of his being the Holy Spirit himself God Almighty what else you want to call him what else could we bring go ahead number 8A 57 1006. questions and answered on Hebrews part three that's Genesis 1 where he created man in his own image which was in the theophany and in Genesis 2 he made a man out of dusted Earth which was the human man that we have now so what was the Man created yep in the image of God what was it logos the awfully Son of God right amen Holy Spirit supernatural being what else you want it was called a theophany look at the next one this is paragraph two 78. of Hebrews chapter that was who that was uh when we just read 278 okay and now the logos that went out of God which was the Lord gosh all this began to form into a body shape and this body shape was called in the Scholar's teaching logos the logos that went out of God in other words a better word for it was was what we call a theophany now watching theophany is a human body that's glorified what not exactly with flesh and blood but theophany is the soul it's not the flesh and blood come on it's not the Flesh and Blood all right the theophanese human body that's glorified not exactly with flesh and blood like it will be in a glorified state but it is of a form of a human body watch a form of a human body that doesn't eat neither does it drink but it's a body a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one now in there we enter into that body and that's the kind of body that God was for he said let us make man in our own image in our likeness and when man become into that body theophany spiritual body he had control of the fish in the Thousand beasts and then he there was not a man to tell Genesis 2 he made man male to female that there's no man until the soul all right you see it look down at the bottom of this and this is one we love now remember he's talking about let us make man this is pirate page 80 of the Hebrew Book if you want to read it on the naturals paragraph 279 were you getting a paragraphs but the difference between a man and a man between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man he didn't put it in the animal the cause of soul that was in the man is that theophany all right and that was a sinner theophany in the natural and he's on his way to hell in his soul not the body and spirit goes it's his soul when you're born again what happens you start the upward eternal life comes into you by the new birth now your soul is your theophany are you with me think on these things yeah let's talk a little bit because I've asked the other day I mentioned it and I was asked to speak on this a good bit but we won't spend as much time but we'll try now remember when we first started that we were talking about to remember that the Man was created male and female right Adam and Eve but in his spiritual creation in his spiritual creation Eve was in Adam where was she at she was in Adam but not in Adam like we talk about being an atom if Adam was going to get eternal life into natural I believe Eve got eternal life in her soul don't have a quote for that I don't think I need one but that's all right that gives you something to argue with out there but listen look what the prophet of God says questions and answers on Hebrews paragraph 8 26. 19 and 57 1008 oh 10 or six excuse need my glasses look for when he was first made he was made two people together you say but but that that was the natural okay we know that's right he was made both male and female the man was the Bible said he was God made man both male and female created he him notice when this man was separated from the theophany and put in flesh he was he wasn't just all together there part of his being was still in theophany so it didn't look right so that's not talking about Adam naturally right Thomas theophany to when Adam was given eternal life Eve was not in existence physically right she had to come out and God had to breathe into her nostrils and she become a living soul but in the beginning now we're going to talk a little bit on what Wade's language okay if Adam and Eve had the same theophany and that's what we're fixing to show that should be enough then there's only one theophany it's eternal and that's the soul of God and might I inject just a thought around said when you get a revelation that your wife is your wife he said she's your wife for life you mean me and Peggy had only one Soul one theophany we'll get to that later we're created both of us as a soul as an individual this is not talking about that this is talking about the eternal and sister Gail if brother dick was your husband and God saw that then you was in him now if you think that's not right or maybe coming wrong I'll remind you that we were in Christ when he came though we may be masculine our feminist either way what does it matter we're the bride of Christ which has got to be a part of him the only way to be a part of him is have his life now brother Dale they got that started years ago and started Soul swapping well you go ahead and swap All Souls you want to I Don't Give A hoot that ain't none of my business I'm a preacher of the Gospel trying to get you and I out of here don't believe in it but Paul had another Heist I don't know what are you trying to say I'm trying to say the Plan of Redemption makes a husband and a wife as the Bible would call it and they were one it's okay so we just read that when man was separated and put in theophany put in the flesh he wasn't us all together there part of his being was still a theophany where's Eve okay roll up the next one questions and answers on Hebrews 3 this is paragraph 8 29. which is a continuation huh and Adam was lonesome and God to show that they could not be separated now I'm going to get back into this same thing just a second look he never went and got dirt and made Eve but he made man from the original dirt Adam he took a riff from his side and made him a helpmate and there was Eve she was made for the man and part of the man she was part of him in the beginning into Creation in theophany she was part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided in another creation she had to be made in the same creation rolled it up just a little that's exactly why Christ and God had to be the same person it could not be anything different if he'd have been a good man or a prophet he couldn't have been a redeemer he had to be the Creator himself but he's still at theophany now see and that's the way he was then you realize we're talking about eternal life we're not talking about just some form of what's going on look at the next one the questions and answers on Hebrew this is 6 39 57. God in the beginning when he knowed that man and woman was made one not two they were made one they were separated one put in flesh and one in theophany he knew that so in order to prove that to you when God made the woman he never took some dirt and made her like he did the man he took a rib out of the shot of Adam and she become a product of a man byproduct of a man because she's part of him you get it now see there you are he never went that's what I've tried to do I know the marriage and divorce and I know what the prophet has said but I know also what he said that there's nothing greater you could be given than a wife if she was a true wife nothing outside of Salvation he said could be greater than a real wife amen why because she's part of it if you and I become part of one another by marriage you know physically why couldn't we think about you know I I don't I just kind of Coach sometimes let this old mind wander and had there not been a fall I believe my wife and I would have come if you don't believe that about your wife you must have the wrong one but I don't suggest you go hunting for another one I said yes you start repenting of that demon you got on you and find out what you got and if she's part of you okay go ahead to the next one with 12 seeds not out with a shook 1965 429 paragraph 51 especially but let's go let's read it all but the church is doing today for Jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is part of the groom right therefore the word that is to be fulfilled and fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day I'd suggest you read that over and over and over it's the same word same experience same life for God when God separated Adam he was both we find out Adam was Spirit to begin with he made man in his own image created he male and female and gen Genesis 2 and on he created a man in Out of the Dust of the earth Man was created in God's image God is a spirit so he's a spirit man and when he become flesh man animal Flesh on the earth he is showing portraying here the bride he was showing the bride she was not another product byproduct we look at that and we want to buy product of gas right we'll buy products go home and look it up you don't even look in your dictionary I don't need a dictionary I got a REV life byproduct is something of equal value or even greater right Brother Dean wrote up here in that Buick I guess of you again Lincoln okay better get his car right you know what that is that's a byproduct of an a model right right which means of greater value I sure do like it better you can keep the a model I'll hold that up set it in the building to look out but when I ride I want to arrive in style right but see we take byproduct oh that women ain't nothing just garbage cans a true wife is not a garbage can a true wife is part of you let's go on what's the next one or did we get through with that one okay so we're talking about the bride of Christ we're part of his Spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to Christ the bride and Christ are one right what's the next one e37 which is the messiah which is 61 117. talk about Messiah so where's the eagle has got so has the eagle has got it we know that and now we say in the man the man before I believe leave that subject the man with what he is he's got a hand you're going to read off the wrong way but you better read what he says man what is he he's got a hand like God no no no he's got a hand like a monkey well what is that quote uh-huh you've got eyes like God you've got ears like God a body like God he was fashioned after God he was given an earth and a Dominion he was made God over the Earth to rule the Earth a Lesser God rules the universe everything but man was given the Earth to rule the Earth he he was a messiah that's what he is tonight if he gets back to God he is a messiah a little Messiah if he had if Messiah means anointed one and you're anointed then what are you that's exactly right I Messiah we call it that just for the words sake till we get a little father down in the scripture on it a messiah a Lesser God now if he wasn't in the spiritual creation if he wasn't into spiritual creation he's not even considered in this point if we don't have eternal life tonight we're nothing but cannon fodder 245 pounds of cannon fodder what did Doctor asked me the other day he said what are you up to I said 2 45. he just died laughing but listen Church God likes to work through man he made him a god it's going down to 14. it was round 13 let's go to 14. and I want to leave this one 1966-26 the unfailing realities of the Living God God always likes to work through man it's God's program to work through men do you believe that congregation says amen God works through men he made man his helper on Earth he made him a Lesser God than himself any problem now look where he goes now we've been through that in the teaching lately of Genesis 1 26. when he was Elohim the all-sufficient the self-existing one and then in him was attributes of Father Son and Holy Spirit not three Gods three officers in him that he was to live in those dispensations he was a savior he was a king he was a God all these things displayed theirselves it's the attributes of God see but in that in him at the beginning Bruno that was in him at the beginning so I just cut it off all right roll the next one up let's get it and then we'll quit I think it's 15. yeah and when God made man in his own image he put him on the earth as a Lesser God Jesus declared it when he said it is not written in your laws it's your gods and if we call those Gods who the word of God come to which were the prop was the prophets how can you condemn me when I say I'm the son of God he said see they just couldn't understand see but a man was put here with a dominion over the Earth he had everything under his control okay all finished I'll bring you the quote if you'd like it I've given it to you but around said when he said let us make man said he didn't say let us make man he said to make a man a singer in other words Genesis 1 26 and 27 is one man that's the man Christ Jesus and only through that can you and I have a new birth it's true receiving the life of Jesus Christ the soul he gave his soul a ransom all right his theophany of his being went to hell in your place and mine his soul but then he sent his soul back on the day of Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost eternal life eternal life is a person not a thought or a concept or a Doctrine so what did he make in Genesis 1 26 and 27 he made a spiritual man he made Christ the son of the Living God that's why Peter that's what he would call him who the man say hi to son of man he said to our Christ and what did he say he said Peter you didn't get what I'm talking about I asked you about the son of man but you didn't get it he said you answered the question I am the Christ but sit up on that rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it look what they've done with it though they've Twisted pushed it hammered it doctored it done everything in the book to turn it away but yet God has brought it on all the way through the prophet of God said reading one day he said there's always been just a fine little line that stayed with the truth a fine little lion that stayed with the truth you know why because they're just a fine little line of Genesis 1 26 and 27. you said what brother Dale looks like that then is God predestinating us and choosing you and I now we're going to get to this flesh this being that we are and see why we need a new birth see this being that we are Body Spirit and soul comes into the world lost yeah but but I I understand and the prophet said the little woman at the well and the little seed of representation from predestination another time he said by predestination predestination only deals with your Earthly Journey I haven't spoke any of predestination so far after I told you we was going back in the mind of God some five six sermons as being on eternal life not talking about him predestinating he didn't predestinate a bride he didn't create a bride the bride is him made manifest in another form called the children of God The Offspring of God Eve was in adamant theophany and when Adam was put into flesh we just read it was still a part of Adam wouldn't write that's why he was lonely right Adam was lonely because part of him was still in theophany right I thought we believed too that right around said God was lonely now get out of your masculine feminish and I say that as hard as I can say it get out of your masculine feminist thinking there's doctrines in this message it was what down here in Florida that there was a female Holy Ghost God had a male Holy Ghost and we was a female Holy Ghost see they tried to preach the truth but without having a teacher to put the word together I wanted to do with it I don't back up what do they do with it split the message I talked to the man that believed that Doctrine and I told him I said them two brothers one of them was teaching two Lords the other one was teaching a female Holy Ghost a male I said you split this message wide open and both of you saying the same thing two Lords two Holy Ghost same thing two Souls did all the same thing did you see why I fight so hard and ain't never been very well liked as far as my ways of speaking and my doings but come and let's talk about the word coming let's sit down and talk about it but because listen if Even Adam was one soul they wasn't but one soul back there right and that's the soul of God and if we have the new birth in our soul then that soul is made eternal and that Soul was the soul of God to come from for the foundation of the world God was lonely Adam was in flesh and he was in theophany and Adam was lonely he wasn't lonely when he was in theophany controlling the animals because he was in theophany with him come on but when he was put in flesh he was lonely God was lonely he brought his children into being so he could fellowship with his children are we the female well that's kind of problem don't it because there's a lot of us male sitting here tonight but see if you want to get into some silliness sat down with the truth and think about it all I'm talking about God revealing himself to mankind that's all I'm trying to bring out and how he comes down is going to call it condescend or whatever or change it in form reveals himself and to know that before the world ever begun he knew how many children he was going to have and he was lonely because he couldn't put him in the flesh but one day he put us in flesh he's not Lonely no More I get up in the night sometime three or four times every night go to the bathroom 73 years old stupid enough to drink a lot of drinks before I go to bed but you know what sometimes I love to just get up and walk through the house and I just talked to him and I said Lord thank you for waking me up Lord I love you and I'm not a prior Warrior that's got all these great languages that can be said I just speak from my heart and say Lord I love you and Lord you know that old church up there we got and trying to help them Lord you know the needs of everybody desire he just used to supply their needs you guide us all Norman walk back and you don't know I'm gonna go back to bed and go back to sleep but I want you to know I love you somebody said one time said the reason you wake up at three in the morning said God wants somebody to talk to said he's lonely well talk to him just just walk through the house and just talk to him just like he'd be talking to me if I was there because he's a whole lot more real God is real he's not a thought in your mind he's real he's the person of eternal life come on brothers take on these things we got one more message it could be a hive and I have connected but we're going to try to start downward with the man then and then we'll really get on the predestination and how is it that God predestinates by his foreknowledge not that he chooses but that we choose to stand yes but you don't understand we don't choose okay go on forget it you know I know what he's talking about the Bible said it's the goodness of God that lead us to repentance I happen to do know a little bit about the scriptures you know you know what caused you and I sister Gail to come to God was his goodness but then we start he looked down and seen that we'd want it but he looked down and seen the others that he'd make contact with maybe more than you and he seemed they wouldn't want it so he could predestinate and he's not a respecter of person if you love God with all your heart you ought to be the happiest person in the world to think about God loving you and I what do we got all in him almighty God is Jesus the prince of peace you ought to hear them saying that song they wrote it talk to God it is see that's why they went to the Jesus only they can see all those scriptures but as I'm speaking to him I could just all I had to do was remind them do you know that scripture here is this scripture there only just shouting and I said now let's turn over here and read about this man in Romans 7. it's Melchizedek and let's talk about him that had no beginning of days and no end of No Life that's it Jesus had a beginning with flesh man Jesus had to be beginning and he had to be made Eternal or they quietened up it really quietened up because they they knew I'd hit something but they couldn't argue scripture foreign but Jesus Christ the almighty God had no beginning and that's who Melchizedek was the man the Bible says he was that at least what I preached on this when Jesus comes again and remember that is John 1 1. in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God then that word was made flesh and dwelled Among Us the Great understanding to think about it I'm trying to get you to see God is real if he chose to he could try here tonight change and stand right here in morphe reveal himself right here because he's God and what would you say well well I feel it alive that's what everybody does they want to grab a camera when you mentioned lights or something then we'll take a picture of the camera run you mentioned billified they want a camera that's right you mean that angel of the Lord that appeared to brother Bradham that was about 200 pound about six foot around six foot 200 pounds and kind of long hair and wearing a rope you mean he's more real than God oh when that man would stand there he said that God created a world is not no more than three or four feet right over here foreign he was standing there is a lot of people never see it to that form I know it saying it real like 40 years of testifying about it don't make me nothing but it makes him something he's kept his word he told me he said well why don't you do this without the other you're talking about he told me this one day he said you preach the word he said I'll back it up I said yes sir but I've been trying my best to do how many gods in Israel have how many gods is a bride of Christ's house yet they had many many different times of seeing him look what mankind did when that man walked on Earth that had been down through that Old Testament revealing himself killed him let's don't turn down the word turn down the word in the end time we don't understand it that's no problem I don't understand it and I believe what I do understand is alive I believe it don't you I'm set up right oh they tell me sing it unto him before we go tell me 171 . last day out before we go far away everybody rise
