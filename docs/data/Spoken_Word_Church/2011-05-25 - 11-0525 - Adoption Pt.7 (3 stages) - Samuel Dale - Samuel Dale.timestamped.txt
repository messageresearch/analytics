[3:32] in us and manifest yourself we thank you
[3:35] we commit it all to you now in Jesus
[3:37] name amen
[3:40] visions
[3:42] one verse 3.
[3:46] blessed be the garden father of our Lord
[3:48] Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all
[3:50] spiritual blessings we're at now in
[3:52] Heavenly places in Christ
[3:54] according as he had chosen Us in him
[3:57] before the foundation of the world that
[3:59] we should be holding Without Blame
[4:01] before him in love having predestinated
[4:04] us unto the adoption of children by
[4:06] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[4:09] good pleasure of his will
[4:11] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[4:13] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[4:17] Beloved amen now let's go to
[4:20] first Peter
[4:23] 1 verse 22 and 23.
[4:26] seeing you have purified your souls and
[4:29] obeying the truth through the spirit
[4:31] unto unfying that means why hot in other
[4:34] words the best you can do clean it up
[4:36] and everything
[4:37] unfined love of the Brethren see that ye
[4:40] love one another with a pure heart
[4:41] fervently being born again not a
[4:45] corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by
[4:47] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[4:50] forever it may be seated the Lord had
[4:53] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[4:56] yeah
[4:58] we
[5:00] have been on this on adoption
[5:03] you know this is message number seven
[5:05] but it's adoption in three stages we're
[5:08] trying to to get a better understanding
[5:11] and and you know that's the the hour I
[5:15] believe that we're here
[5:16] that this is the time I don't believe
[5:18] it's the prophet gave it in the the
[5:21] message manifested sons of God he said
[5:23] where my brother and where my sister's
[5:25] outside of this time was it ever
[5:28] promised right for the manifestation of
[5:31] the sons and daughters you know of the
[5:34] Living God to be made manifest all right
[5:37] see and we know that Romans tells us
[5:39] that the whole world is groaning waiting
[5:44] for you and I amen all right so you say
[5:48] well let's just get on with it well we
[5:50] can't do it until God
[5:52] comes down to Quicken the time it can't
[5:54] be done but we're trying to to get an
[5:58] understanding to where you know that
[6:00] we're just not like the world and uh and
[6:03] I don't mean the natural world I'm
[6:05] talking about the religious world of the
[6:07] misunderstanding and doing like that but
[6:10] we try to get into the word and believe
[6:13] the word and just move on in the word
[6:15] because that's all all I know to do see
[6:18] this is the hour this is the time right
[6:21] not if they wasn't manifested Sons and
[6:25] Daughters of God listen get the point
[6:26] and read it and listen to the prophet
[6:29] they were manifested Sons and Daughters
[6:31] for their age if I don't understand what
[6:34] I'm saying for their age all right see
[6:37] the book of Acts they were Sons and
[6:39] Daughters of God they they had the faith
[6:41] of the father but they did not have the
[6:45] headstone to come and and bring the
[6:48] message to them you know and that but
[6:50] still they were for their day and their
[6:53] hour they were God's manifestation upon
[6:57] the Earth amen see we're just trying to
[6:59] get into it to bring it for this age
[7:02] amen all right and recognize the
[7:04] international main thing I've been
[7:06] trying to get see is to recognize in
[7:08] your day in this message now we
[7:11] recognize the prophet
[7:13] we recognize the message of the hour we
[7:15] recognize those things but do we
[7:18] recognize our day amen and I've been
[7:22] over that and over that that the prophet
[7:24] said you know that there was a word for
[7:26] every age all right it's the word that
[7:28] comes predestinated eternally
[7:31] it's not the person right it's the word
[7:34] right now what we've got to do in this
[7:36] day though for it to wind up is what
[7:38] wind up for that person and that word to
[7:42] unite together right all right now
[7:45] that's what I believe will bring about a
[7:47] Rapture a change of things is when you
[7:50] know you and I become the word that you
[7:53] know and you can say well we we know
[7:56] this doctrine of one God we know the
[7:58] doctrine knowing a Doctrine and knowing
[8:01] the god of that message amen is two
[8:03] different things amen all right so you
[8:06] can you can know the quotes you can know
[8:08] you know all the things but if it's not
[8:10] revealed right right and if there's one
[8:13] thing
[8:15] one thing
[8:17] now listen this is what I've been trying
[8:19] to get you to see if there's just one
[8:21] word
[8:22] to be revealed the Rapture can't come
[8:25] right
[8:27] now because that's what's holding off
[8:28] the Rapture is not just time and
[8:30] elements in people and whatever it's the
[8:32] revealing of God's word all right all
[8:35] right so then we shouldn't be concerned
[8:38] about you know the point of we've been
[8:41] here all of this time
[8:42] we should be concerned with the fact
[8:44] that whether or not has God been able to
[8:46] reveal his word have we turned down the
[8:49] Revelation right
[8:51] you know because it didn't come our way
[8:53] our thoughts I was just reading uh back
[8:56] there a while ago on some things brother
[8:58] random was saying that everybody's got
[9:00] it figured out their way that's it right
[9:03] there amen all right and I would say and
[9:06] wouldn't back off of it probably here in
[9:08] the building you would find it's
[9:09] basically everybody's got a little
[9:11] different thought about what things are
[9:13] right or to expect or what to be amen
[9:16] you know may we we may have the overall
[9:18] view as one thing too but yet we we
[9:22] would have our different ways of looking
[9:24] at things
[9:26] there's no problem as long as we don't
[9:28] turn down the revealed word right right
[9:32] turning down the letter of the word is
[9:34] one thing but turning down the word when
[9:37] it's revealed right now that's another
[9:39] thing right see when it's made revealed
[9:41] unto his arm but see we've been talking
[9:43] about manifestation
[9:46] as I said most people think
[9:48] manifestation is signs and wonders
[9:52] you know Miracles taking place and and
[9:55] all that and that's wonderful that is
[9:57] manifestation
[9:58] that that's something the word there
[10:00] means that but the prophet of God what
[10:03] did he say he said what is manifestation
[10:05] a manifested sons of God preached
[10:08] 1965-18 he said what is manifestation he
[10:11] said make it known right amen amen make
[10:14] it known that's right she didn't I've
[10:17] tried my best to get you to see one
[10:19] thing that signs follow them that
[10:22] believe amen we don't follow signs
[10:26] if we did we'd better get out of here
[10:28] and go somewhere else because there's
[10:30] probably a lot more on some of these
[10:32] other churches going on than what would
[10:34] happen here tonight maybe right
[10:36] see
[10:38] because that's just the way that it's
[10:40] being done and to me now I I don't have
[10:43] any problems with that
[10:46] it wouldn't change me none whatsoever if
[10:49] if ever Church in the world was having
[10:52] signs and wonders and we didn't have any
[10:54] at all that's not going to change me
[10:56] about what I believe right
[10:58] amen I want you to know that up front
[11:01] what I believe I stand on
[11:04] because what else can you stand on
[11:06] signs and wonders
[11:09] but Iran's done told you he said even
[11:12] the gifts and the things that was in his
[11:14] life was not to be done that away
[11:18] that's right we were supposed to believe
[11:20] the word without having to have signs
[11:23] and wonders
[11:24] but God is so gracious
[11:27] rich in Mercy
[11:30] that he would give the signs and wonders
[11:33] to try to attract our attention to what
[11:36] right
[11:37] to the word right
[11:40] I'm like I've told you over and over
[11:42] then people to say well you trust
[11:43] brother random while he's he's the
[11:45] discernments and the things like that
[11:47] he's prayed receipt but sit down watch
[11:49] him when he starts preaching you know
[11:51] well now isn't that something right yeah
[11:53] sure right I mean to me that's so carnal
[11:56] until I I can't conceive the idea of
[11:59] that
[12:01] but if we see signs and wonders are we
[12:03] supposed to go after the signs and
[12:05] wonder
[12:07] are we supposed to go after the word and
[12:10] expect signs and wonders to follow the
[12:11] word which way is it that's right amen
[12:14] see that's all I've ever been right see
[12:17] people say well brother Dale you don't
[12:19] believe in signs and wonders you're
[12:20] you're messed up in your mentality it's
[12:22] the best way for me to say
[12:24] because I believe in signs and wonders
[12:25] more than you I can tell talk to you
[12:27] about it if you want to talk about it
[12:29] hey
[12:31] because I believe it
[12:33] but I believe the word first that's the
[12:36] way it comes to me it's got to come work
[12:38] first and then signs will follow all
[12:41] right and see then that then is what
[12:45] if we make him known by the preaching of
[12:48] the Gospel by talking to people
[12:50] fellowshipping you know out in the world
[12:52] talking to people and you witnessing the
[12:55] people you know and things like that see
[12:57] you're making your father known right
[13:00] amen maybe you never thought of it like
[13:02] that until you know you started thinking
[13:05] about manifestation but that's what it
[13:06] is you're making him known right well
[13:09] he's going to make you known that's
[13:12] right
[13:13] he's going to make you known but my
[13:16] prayer is always this Lord open your
[13:20] word
[13:21] right
[13:23] I've tried my best for all these 40
[13:25] years coming up you know pretty quick
[13:28] to make him known even here in this
[13:30] building you know to make him known
[13:35] all right I believe that he's made us
[13:38] known amen you said well I'd like to
[13:40] when I would too
[13:43] but I'm satisfied with what he's doing
[13:45] amen I'll get down to that in a minute
[13:46] you know I'm doing to see what's the
[13:48] great deception in the last days
[13:51] all right but just follow with me now
[13:54] we'll find it see
[13:56] we covered Jesus said now what is
[13:59] manifestation make it known right
[14:03] we make him known he might trust no all
[14:05] right
[14:06] all right now it's not that he's making
[14:09] us known and then we make him no no
[14:11] that's reverse
[14:14] we must make him known and then he can
[14:16] make us know amen
[14:19] we've got to be secondary in in the
[14:22] point to work that we are departure that
[14:24] way see signs follow them that believe
[14:27] that night
[14:30] we don't have to have signs and wonders
[14:32] to believe God's word do you
[14:35] all right I mean do you do you've got a
[14:38] house signs and wonders before you can
[14:39] believe what God Said now you show me in
[14:41] the Bible any sign that ever happened
[14:43] before the word was spoken amen
[14:47] me
[14:49] I mean you know show me in the Bible
[14:51] he said well Abraham right but I'm glad
[14:53] you said that because God spoke to him
[14:57] out of his word his signs and wonders
[15:00] took place
[15:01] right
[15:02] right see it's always been the word
[15:04] first
[15:06] and then signs following the word right
[15:09] check it by
[15:11] dude I I can't check the signs and
[15:13] Things by other signs
[15:15] that's right well we got more signs than
[15:17] you got that's about like it was when
[15:19] Josh and them was playing he was playing
[15:22] in the band up there in their their
[15:23] football team wasn't too good but he
[15:25] said there's one thing about it our band
[15:27] will beat your band any day
[15:32] let's just don't get into the wrong
[15:34] thing with it
[15:36] signs follow them that believe all right
[15:39] but yet to be able to see we must
[15:42] recognize
[15:44] our day
[15:47] and its message see we we take the point
[15:50] we recognize the prophet as I said a
[15:52] moment ago we recognize the message but
[15:55] do we recognize that if we if we
[15:57] recognize the message and the the
[16:00] prophet then we've got to see ourselves
[16:03] because he didn't can't speak of himself
[16:05] right
[16:08] he come to speak of a word born bride
[16:10] amen man he didn't say he was the
[16:12] foolish so that God had bodilies I gave
[16:14] you that doesn't it but he said the
[16:15] bride with me right all right
[16:18] see
[16:19] and even saying that to God he is not
[16:21] complete without me and you amen that's
[16:23] right
[16:25] we see we we declare the message
[16:29] and we declare to the messenger thank
[16:31] God we believe it but what about the
[16:33] message this brought
[16:36] see Martin Luther he couldn't he
[16:39] couldn't if he'd have been the only one
[16:41] that would protesting the Catholic
[16:42] Church while they'd have blowed him off
[16:44] and said forget it right right it
[16:46] wouldn't have been concerned but when
[16:48] the message he began to bring begin to
[16:52] develop in the hearts and the people
[16:54] right right that's right and they
[16:57] started protesting it wasn't just him
[16:59] protesting it right
[17:02] it's when the message come forward right
[17:04] man the people begin to protest the
[17:07] Catholic church then they got concerned
[17:09] they started losing converts in a hurry
[17:11] right
[17:12] he would have never run around what did
[17:14] he say
[17:15] he said when that bride begins to say I
[17:18] and my father are one that's right and
[17:20] these other things he said he said the
[17:22] shark will pull away that's right all
[17:25] right
[17:25] well
[17:26] why don't we get over recognizing who we
[17:29] are amen my brother tell you what do you
[17:31] mean I'm in the bride I'm in the bride
[17:33] that's not recognizing it you know
[17:38] that's not the the point I'm talking
[17:40] about recognizing I'm talking about
[17:42] recognizing yourself in the word right
[17:45] find the message for this day now what
[17:47] did we preach that months and months ago
[17:49] that the Book of Revelation shows the
[17:52] bride that's right never shows Jesus
[17:55] Christ by himself
[17:56] always with his pride or someone like
[17:59] the Jews or whatever he's not shown by
[18:02] himself right but now listen but there's
[18:05] a word for each age and that word must
[18:07] be made manifest why because it's a
[18:09] predestinated seed amen
[18:13] the word is predestinated eternally well
[18:17] whether you and I like it or not we
[18:19] ain't gonna change what this is right
[18:21] all right
[18:23] see the way we've done and the reason
[18:25] we're here 40 something years after the
[18:27] prophets went off the scene it's why
[18:29] because that we haven't recognized
[18:32] ourselves right and seen what's going on
[18:37] right man
[18:39] no no listen we'll get down to it in
[18:42] just in a second let's go ahead and just
[18:43] cover it
[18:45] brother Branham said
[18:48] you believe him
[18:50] God in Simplicity 1963 317.
[18:55] God will hide himself in something so
[18:58] simple that'll cause the wise to miss it
[19:00] a million miles and then turn right back
[19:01] around in that some simple thing in the
[19:05] Simplicity of his way of working and
[19:08] reveal himself right out again right
[19:11] knowledge
[19:13] he said I thought it maybe take a text
[19:16] on this you know before we get to the
[19:18] teaching of the great teaching of the
[19:20] Seven Seals many miss him by the way he
[19:24] reveals himself
[19:27] now here's the Great
[19:29] mix up it's always been
[19:32] here's the greatest mix-up of all things
[19:34] you say denominationalism you say this
[19:36] is them that is and we're afraid of this
[19:38] we're afraid of that now here's what I'm
[19:39] afraid of all right
[19:45] by the way he reveals himself
[19:48] now man has their own ideas of what God
[19:52] ought to be and what God is going to do
[19:59] and as I have made the old statement
[20:02] many times
[20:03] that man Still Remains man
[20:06] that's right
[20:09] man is always giving God praise for what
[20:12] he did do
[20:17] and always looking forward to what he
[20:20] will do
[20:22] and ignoring what he's doing right man
[20:26] now there's the greatest denominational
[20:28] mix-up that's ever been right
[20:32] to the people today you know with my
[20:34] time
[20:35] if we're back there they don't even know
[20:37] that's exactly scripture because when it
[20:39] was facing you know they said if we'd
[20:41] have been back there
[20:43] that's man and that's his ways to do it
[20:45] all right listen he goes on to say
[20:46] that's the way they miss it they look
[20:48] back and see what a great thing he'd
[20:51] done but that's failed to see what a
[20:53] simple thing he used to do it with
[20:57] and then they look forward and see a
[20:59] great thing coming that's going to
[21:01] happen and nine times out of ten now
[21:04] listen to it
[21:05] that's pretty good average right nine
[21:07] times out of ten right
[21:10] right it's already happening right
[21:12] around them and it's so simple that they
[21:15] don't see it right
[21:18] that's right now
[21:20] I want to make sure to identify Christ
[21:22] of all ages 64 401 he said man is always
[21:26] praising God for what he done
[21:29] always looking forward for what he will
[21:33] do and ignoring what he's doing right
[21:36] amen amen now there's the thing
[21:40] Fredo
[21:43] organize religion no right
[21:47] denominationalism no right
[21:50] we ought to be already above all of that
[21:52] all right amen yes sir if you're
[21:54] concerned about whether or not you can
[21:56] be deceived
[21:58] by doctrines that are flying around the
[22:00] land and I'm telling you up front you're
[22:03] all ready to see it that's right of
[22:06] course that's the deception
[22:07] why can't you trust the holy spirit amen
[22:12] the only problem is if you have it right
[22:14] amen right because it's never allowed me
[22:17] to go into those things right
[22:20] and yet I studied the doctrines that
[22:23] they would bring
[22:24] right because I wanted to see what they
[22:26] were talking about exactly right amen I
[22:29] studied them but once I be once I seen
[22:32] what it was then forget it
[22:36] I mean it didn't take me six months I
[22:38] didn't do it that way I was just seeing
[22:40] what they were saying
[22:43] didn't drop it and forget it
[22:45] because once I seen it was not in the
[22:47] word
[22:48] yeah
[22:49] right and everyone that I ever watched
[22:52] like that
[22:53] it was always pointing man watch this
[22:56] and you'll see it it's always pointing
[22:58] forward
[23:00] huh because the ones that started the
[23:03] doctrines didn't look backward now
[23:05] here's the biggest portion of the group
[23:07] of the message people are Looking
[23:09] Backward to what brother random done
[23:10] what he done and what took place all
[23:13] right
[23:14] now but these doctrines they don't look
[23:17] back to brother Branham right right
[23:19] because they don't base it on what he
[23:21] said oh yeah they take quote quote quote
[23:23] quote but don't take it all so they're
[23:25] looking forward in other words you know
[23:27] what they're looking for
[23:30] the two Soul people you know
[23:33] they they had it down and they caught it
[23:36] you got to come to them
[23:39] you got to come to them
[23:42] they tell you what it is
[23:44] they'll tell you where the changes are
[23:46] at the seventh under virtue people
[23:50] they'll tell you whether you got it or
[23:53] not
[23:54] you got to come to them
[23:56] well that's that future right
[23:59] see so the great thing is to either look
[24:01] you're either Looking Backward are you
[24:03] looking forward and failing to see
[24:05] what's going on
[24:08] yo but I don't see much going on well
[24:10] then open your eyes
[24:15] what would you see if you were heading
[24:17] down the the the ramp going to work so I
[24:21] understand oh Gloria hallelujah we're
[24:23] going to die today Lord I don't think so
[24:28] I'm sorry
[24:30] now when it got down where the line was
[24:31] at it might have struck
[24:33] because in the lines a lot of times
[24:35] wouldn't even hurt them and they had to
[24:36] probe the line to get them to come after
[24:37] them right
[24:39] but just get my point it wasn't Glory
[24:41] we're gonna die
[24:43] no
[24:45] notice but see people were not
[24:48] recognizing what's taking place
[24:52] well if y'all had what y'all believe
[24:54] we'd have more signs and wonders
[24:59] how can God tutor his children right
[25:04] that's the whole point
[25:08] we need rain now Pray For Rain that's
[25:11] right man all right but if it's a
[25:13] monsoon season we don't need rain
[25:17] we need for it to stop
[25:20] so get your story correct
[25:23] oh
[25:25] see looking back look what God done
[25:28] through the prophet I'm looking forward
[25:30] look what one of these days now one of
[25:33] these days is going to be a great thing
[25:37] well
[25:40] now let me just put it this way and I'll
[25:42] be as blunt as I can so you listening
[25:46] looking back will not bring you to
[25:48] adoption
[25:49] looking forward will not bring you to
[25:52] adoption right amen that's right you'll
[25:56] only come there by recognizing your day
[25:59] in this message
[26:01] recognizing where we're at right now
[26:03] amen you will never do it by looking
[26:05] forward
[26:07] there is things to come amen We Believe
[26:11] amen there have been things took place
[26:13] amen we believe in that
[26:16] received the greatest day that's ever
[26:18] been in the world
[26:23] now I thought your Prophet taught this
[26:24] time
[26:27] I thought the Bible said that the whole
[26:29] world is waiting for the manifestation
[26:31] of the sons of God that's it amen
[26:34] I thought the prophet taught that in how
[26:37] many messages how many are there to hear
[26:38] ye him right let alone all the others
[26:41] were in it
[26:42] yeah
[26:43] that he was talking about that the whole
[26:45] world is waiting for the manifestation
[26:47] of the Sons and Daughters of the Living
[26:49] God
[26:55] the world's not waiting on it to come to
[26:57] an end
[26:59] all right the world's not waiting on
[27:01] great earthquakes and stuff like that
[27:04] the world's waiting to see manifested
[27:07] Sons and Daughters of God
[27:12] they saw it for a little time there in
[27:14] the prophet because there he would stand
[27:16] and
[27:17] speak
[27:19] and he speak to squirrels and you know
[27:21] into existence he would speak to the
[27:23] world and he would speak to the Hornets
[27:25] and things like that they saw their
[27:27] master
[27:31] the trees the people the animals
[27:34] they saw their Master for a moment
[27:38] but he said what you've seen in part
[27:41] yep that's right you'll see in his
[27:43] fullness
[27:44] but if we don't know what to look for
[27:47] all right
[27:50] that's my whole point now here this is
[27:53] all that's on my mind for for tonight
[27:55] all right
[27:58] that all I've ever watched of people in
[28:01] the Rapture form of speaking it or
[28:03] whether they was talking about adoption
[28:05] or whatever it's it's they're waiting
[28:08] for something to happen
[28:11] one of these days
[28:13] we're going to speak the word
[28:17] one of these days we're gonna do this
[28:20] it's always in the future
[28:24] well you know that's that's easy to do
[28:25] isn't it you know I could always say you
[28:28] know you talk to people about they talk
[28:29] to you I'll talk to somebody and they'll
[28:31] start telling you oh we're here in the
[28:32] end time we're in the end of the world
[28:33] oh it's bad isn't it you start giving
[28:35] really scriptures real quick and then
[28:37] they'll say oh but now wait just a
[28:39] minute now where nobody knows the days
[28:41] or the hour see they start back pedaling
[28:44] when they were the ones bringing it to
[28:46] you
[28:47] right right but you see Church
[28:51] people are looking at adoption as a man
[28:54] of transfiguration experience
[28:58] all right
[28:59] I know
[29:01] I preached it to you
[29:03] your new birth is not your adoption
[29:07] your adoption will be amount of
[29:09] transfiguration experience right all
[29:11] right
[29:14] now we believe that because that's where
[29:16] the Prophet called it but he also taught
[29:19] it in three stages and so did Paul and
[29:21] Romans
[29:24] all right he taught it like Paul is as
[29:27] an identification
[29:29] there on the River Jordan
[29:32] then a matter of transfiguration coming
[29:34] to recognition
[29:38] and then go on to the change
[29:41] all right now let me put it this way and
[29:44] you think about it
[29:47] the biggest portion of Greta Reynolds
[29:49] message would not be dealing with what
[29:51] has been like
[29:55] the biggest portion of his message is
[29:57] not dealing with what will be
[30:02] now you understand what I said he
[30:04] brought those things all right
[30:06] but the biggest portion to me of the
[30:09] message is trying to point to where you
[30:11] and I are at to get us to see who we are
[30:15] amen amen
[30:16] that to me is the most important thing
[30:19] because it could ever be thought of
[30:22] yeah see and the biggest denominational
[30:24] mix-up is to look back and say look what
[30:28] they had
[30:30] and look forward one of these days we're
[30:33] gonna get it
[30:35] and failing to see what's going on right
[30:37] you know your Prophet said it like this
[30:39] one day he said the same Holy Ghost
[30:43] that justified the Lutheran sanctify the
[30:45] men just baptized the Pentecostal Now
[30:47] set in order to come into the Lord
[30:51] you know what the same Holy Ghost it was
[30:53] back there that caused those people to
[30:55] walk into a lion's den
[30:57] he said it's the same Holy Ghost you
[31:01] live daily
[31:03] in the basis the word that you can
[31:05] overcome by that Holy Spirit
[31:07] that's right
[31:10] we want to make something big out of
[31:12] this and something big over here instead
[31:14] of seeing what's going on right
[31:18] but but Brother David yeah I'm looking
[31:21] forward to many things
[31:25] there's many things your Prophet spoke
[31:27] of that I look forward to
[31:30] even to drastic horrible things that he
[31:34] said California going under Etc
[31:39] earthquakes in diverse places but see
[31:41] we're seeing it work now oh man
[31:45] he said after a series of earthquakes
[31:50] California would go under
[31:52] me
[31:53] why
[31:55] but see our point is always California
[31:57] Glory we're here 77. Glory we're here
[32:00] we're here
[32:04] we're still here
[32:10] but instead of dying in 77 or as a man
[32:13] told me he planted trees where you get
[32:14] that Spirit off of him I didn't know
[32:16] that planting trees would get a spirit
[32:18] off of you I thought repenting did right
[32:20] right
[32:21] I know what the man said he said I I had
[32:24] the idea we were going out here now I'm
[32:25] playing trees where they'd grow up and
[32:27] watch them grow
[32:29] but we don't need that
[32:31] but now listen
[32:35] what is going on now is the most
[32:38] important thing that has ever been amen
[32:46] what has been going on since the prophet
[32:49] left the scene
[32:51] is the most important thing in the Bible
[32:54] because it's what the Bible is looking
[32:57] for it's the finality right it's the
[33:00] climax it's the last act to the play
[33:02] it's whatever you want to bring up to
[33:05] talk about it's the end of all things
[33:12] all right
[33:13] but she always looking back
[33:19] are looking forward
[33:21] and not seeing what's going on now
[33:24] to me if instead is the worst
[33:26] denominational mix-up that's ever been
[33:33] but you see Church
[33:37] I want to think about your adoption
[33:41] and I told you now listen I'll say it
[33:43] again where are you going to understand
[33:44] me
[33:45] I know what the prophet said your new
[33:47] birth is not your adoption
[33:50] your adoption is a man of
[33:51] transfiguration experience which is
[33:53] really that even is not the adoption
[33:56] that is the change of the body would
[33:59] bring you to the completion right right
[34:01] all right but there must be a matter of
[34:04] transfiguration experience in the bride
[34:07] all right
[34:08] see your new birth is the spirit of
[34:11] adoption right Romans 8 14. that's right
[34:15] the spirit of adoption
[34:19] see then we've been in the process of
[34:22] adoption
[34:23] amen that's right I'll try my best to
[34:26] get you to see that because if the Holy
[34:29] Ghost is our tutor and that's what the
[34:32] prophet said it was and according to the
[34:34] Bible it is
[34:37] Anna
[34:39] then if that be true
[34:42] then something that's been going on Amen
[34:46] right for 40 something years right right
[34:49] something had been going on in those
[34:51] that would walk in the light
[34:56] because you've never heard me get
[34:58] negative about the hour that we're
[35:00] living in that's right
[35:03] that's right amen
[35:06] of course your brother told me one time
[35:07] he said oh you're just a good old
[35:09] Madness
[35:10] see because a good old Baptist he just
[35:12] kind of looks at everything plain blunt
[35:14] and he just says well don't tell you
[35:18] huh whatever it is
[35:21] it is here and I still believe what I
[35:24] did and uh
[35:25] mice to the 60s about adoption
[35:30] I told him then they said one day we're
[35:32] going to speak the word I said you've
[35:33] got to have it before you can speak it
[35:38] well of course we've got it
[35:41] we got the books and the tape
[35:44] oh my well we had the Bible yes I didn't
[35:50] do something with that right man
[35:53] yeah
[35:54] you see right
[35:57] see don't miss what's been going on
[36:04] don't fail to see that
[36:09] see people you know what I gave you the
[36:11] quotes about around saying Pentecostal
[36:13] people that's it when they got the new
[36:14] bird that was all of it they got it
[36:17] that's good Baptist just moved up a step
[36:19] they say I just spoke tongue that's bad
[36:21] just said we got everything when we
[36:23] believed
[36:26] well we spent a lot of time saying that
[36:28] ain't right
[36:32] and we spend a lot of time staying with
[36:33] them Pentecostal tonight
[36:36] but what about the Pentecostals of this
[36:38] message
[36:40] and that don't mean you got to be a
[36:42] Pentecostal denomination and come out of
[36:44] it to be one or whatever it ain't even
[36:46] talking about
[36:48] I'm talking about what your Prophet was
[36:50] talking about when he gave I gave you
[36:51] the quote I'm talking about people that
[36:55] think look what was back there
[36:59] yep
[37:00] look what was back there
[37:04] and we got it
[37:07] because we believe it
[37:09] foreign
[37:22] you ever seen it no
[37:25] well you don't know where it's leaning
[37:27] right or left
[37:28] right
[37:32] you understand what I try to make a
[37:34] point with that
[37:36] me brother dick's been on the Brooklyn
[37:39] Bridge
[37:40] he could tell me all about the Brooklyn
[37:42] Bridge but I don't know a thing about
[37:44] the Brooklyn Bridge I don't know whether
[37:45] it's going north south east or west or
[37:47] how it turned to you
[37:49] God I've never been there seen it
[37:52] but because they're saying what somebody
[37:53] else says
[37:57] now does that ring a bell
[37:59] that no man can call Jesus a Christ by
[38:03] what somebody else says
[38:05] is that scripture that's right must have
[38:08] your own experience
[38:11] all right
[38:14] but you see we say we've got the new
[38:16] birth brother Dale
[38:18] we got everything no we didn't I told
[38:20] you I talked to two men one of them said
[38:21] he hadn't got everything when he
[38:23] believed in other words he said when I
[38:24] was born again I was adopted I was
[38:26] everything
[38:27] the other one on the other side of the
[38:28] table said well I'm sorry to tell you I
[38:30] don't agree with you
[38:32] he said because you ain't got nothing
[38:33] yet
[38:36] I saw my brothers they forgive me for
[38:39] being this and I'm just somewhere right
[38:40] in between you two and I was I was kind
[38:42] of setting they were in my life yeah I
[38:44] said I just don't work out in between
[38:46] here because you know I believe that I
[38:49] have the new birth right
[38:51] right exactly like it they didn't like
[38:53] it but then you brought around and made
[38:54] the quote I said brother and said he met
[38:56] people with the Holy Ghost 50 years they
[38:58] got it before he come on see he said
[39:00] exactly like the book of Acts both of
[39:03] them said they didn't believe that
[39:06] but they said they couldn't understand
[39:08] it
[39:10] but they didn't want to sit and listen
[39:11] to me explain there was a difference in
[39:12] the upper room experience in the 3000
[39:15] later it only heard one actually right
[39:17] but you know what they all got the new
[39:18] birth amen that's right but you see all
[39:21] right that's one side of it
[39:25] I only got the new brother we got
[39:27] everything the other side of it one of
[39:29] these days it's coming it's coming one
[39:32] of his face all right now that's the
[39:34] denominational mix-up right and the most
[39:37] dangerous one it could be time now let's
[39:40] get into what we're talking about
[39:46] we talk about adoption
[39:49] as
[39:50] a person
[39:53] that was born in the family
[39:57] and according to Galatians about four
[40:00] then he's no different than a servant
[40:05] because he's a child
[40:07] right right
[40:09] and we talk of that as Galatians brought
[40:12] it that he's under 2
[40:15] until the time appointed
[40:18] all right
[40:19] now
[40:22] what I think most people are saying if
[40:25] I'm saying what you're saying then I'm
[40:26] sorry I'm just trying my best to say it
[40:29] okay the word it'll catch you and me
[40:34] but see
[40:40] spirited our tutor we had to quote quote
[40:42] quote
[40:43] but how many have you ever thought about
[40:45] until I started bringing it out I'm just
[40:47] saying I don't understand what you want
[40:49] to do but
[40:50] but how many of you thought about that
[40:52] the Holy Spirit and the father is a
[40:54] self-sane spirit amen
[40:58] and then the tutor can't be a different
[41:00] Holy Ghost right from the father that's
[41:04] dwelling within you amen
[41:06] had you put it together that way she
[41:08] said that's what we're far that's our
[41:09] job okay
[41:11] the Lord speaks and we just go on and do
[41:13] and try our best to help right
[41:15] all right then it's the Holy Spirit and
[41:18] the father is the self-sane spirit if
[41:20] not then Jesus had two daddies
[41:23] right
[41:24] I'm quoting brother random man
[41:26] huh but you see that it would have to be
[41:29] the Holy Spirit would have to be the
[41:31] spirit of the father coming in and
[41:33] dwelling the natural story
[41:36] is not like that the natural story The
[41:39] Father hires somebody else to do the
[41:43] tutoring right
[41:44] that's just the story
[41:49] and I'm sure that every one of which one
[41:53] was it um Joseph's standing on
[41:56] Jacob
[41:58] every one of them kids was probably
[42:00] adopted
[42:12] it's when a child gets you at a certain
[42:14] age then they have this thing that
[42:16] happens and they bring them out and they
[42:18] they're coming into manhood right and
[42:21] it's not a play thing Wade brought it
[42:23] out here one time I really enjoyed it
[42:24] because I really didn't know all about
[42:26] those things myself
[42:27] and he was bringing out how that that
[42:29] child has to know all of them do certain
[42:32] things of the Bible that he had to know
[42:35] to be able to talk and tell about it or
[42:38] he wasn't brought to the position right
[42:40] all right
[42:42] it wasn't just a little kid and he grows
[42:45] up and he gets up pretty good size and
[42:46] he's able to shoot a ball you know oh
[42:49] that's my boy
[42:51] but you know what
[42:55] now if we change the story and get it
[42:57] correct
[43:00] the natural story they hired somebody
[43:02] else to tutor
[43:05] the spiritual story
[43:07] is the father coming and living in you
[43:12] in the form of the baptism of the Holy
[43:15] Spirit to make sure that we come out to
[43:18] the correct
[43:21] that's right
[43:23] amen ciao
[43:26] amen right right
[43:28] see the natural story The Natural story
[43:31] you can only use a natural story as a
[43:34] time right
[43:35] right
[43:37] as I said probably uh Jacob adopted
[43:40] every one of them but Joseph was the one
[43:42] of his heart
[43:43] that got the coat of many colors right
[43:46] but every one of them probably went
[43:47] through their their day in their time of
[43:49] being brought into the family right
[43:53] because that was the natural story
[43:56] all right
[43:57] but you see it's not somebody it's not
[44:00] God hiring somebody else to raise his
[44:02] children in the spiritual Kingdom God
[44:04] comes down himself to dwell in us right
[44:08] Amos to bring us his nature and his
[44:11] feelings that's right that's it right
[44:12] there right
[44:14] amen
[44:17] listen what I'm saying
[44:19] your adoption is going on that's why I'm
[44:22] trying to bring it in three stages you
[44:24] see
[44:25] recognition when you're born into the
[44:27] family by the new birth then growth
[44:29] development down through the statue of a
[44:31] perfect man into things
[44:32] and then one day the change of the body
[44:36] but it's really not even to that because
[44:38] to show you that it stops into the
[44:40] manifestation the Bible doesn't say that
[44:42] the Bible says to understand the
[44:45] Redemption of the Bible
[44:48] that's not the change in the body is not
[44:51] the not the adoption they still
[44:53] understand the diet the to how it's
[44:56] going to take place right and then it's
[44:58] got to take place if we understand how
[45:00] the people amen that's right but you see
[45:04] the the tutor in the natural he's going
[45:07] out making sure he's supplying
[45:09] everything the child needs and he's
[45:11] going back every once in a while he says
[45:12] father he's he's doing good he's acting
[45:14] like you you know he's doing pretty good
[45:16] but see in this situation
[45:18] the holy spirit is reporting to the
[45:21] father
[45:24] all that Unitarianism well then if you
[45:27] realize the Holy Spirit the father is
[45:29] the Same Spirit you're not that's right
[45:31] you're back to the truth
[45:34] my point is
[45:36] God is not waiting for you and I to come
[45:39] down there to amount of transfiguration
[45:41] to be able to show us
[45:43] that's a part that is in the story
[45:47] he's doing that now because we're making
[45:50] him known right
[45:52] that's what I've been doing for 40 years
[45:55] and making my father known
[45:58] what happens he didn't have to do
[46:00] anything because he knows what I'm
[46:03] saying true I'm never asked him to give
[46:05] a sign
[46:07] I've asked him about something to show
[46:09] me but not a sign of whether the word
[46:12] was right or not
[46:14] I'm asking natural or something
[46:16] spiritual in the extent but I've never
[46:18] asked him to give me a sign to tell me
[46:20] the word was right
[46:23] what do I need that for I got his word I
[46:26] want him to reveal it to me right yeah
[46:30] I've got the letter of the word this
[46:33] prophet's message is the letter of the
[46:34] word amen that's why I've been so long
[46:37] in all these years of taking the things
[46:39] like Daniel 70 weeks and the seals and
[46:41] and all those things and spending
[46:43] lengthy times on them right
[46:46] to try to make my father known
[46:50] thank you
[46:51] well he's giving us enough signs and
[46:54] wonders
[46:59] but you see I'm Not Looking Back
[47:01] and I'm not looking forward
[47:04] to press again
[47:09] I I hate to be like a guy you know that
[47:14] fictitional story but he got a newspaper
[47:17] a day ahead of time oh he could bet on
[47:19] anything he could buy anything and he
[47:21] could make money just rolling like
[47:22] everything
[47:24] but one day he read the obituary and
[47:26] found out he died to die before the day
[47:28] before
[47:30] that's not a joke it's just to tell you
[47:33] right I'm Not Looking Back I'm not
[47:35] looking forward
[47:37] I don't play the lotteries my thing
[47:41] that's right my brother said you know
[47:42] play the lottery make sure you pay your
[47:44] tithe don't bring time I won't take
[47:47] times out of a or or out of a
[47:50] lottery sometime that's right don't
[47:52] bring it to me I don't want him why
[47:55] because it's not good money
[47:57] and I've been blown about the things
[47:59] that are and I've expressed it to you
[48:01] about it somebody gives you something
[48:03] that's not it but when you take a gamble
[48:05] is when you're putting down something on
[48:07] your own that's right amen
[48:10] it ain't a gamble when somebody walks up
[48:11] to you and hands you something that
[48:12] gives you trash my gambling this when
[48:14] you put down the money and trying to bet
[48:15] on it or or making you know that's
[48:17] gambling we don't agree with it that's
[48:19] right but now listen
[48:23] the father
[48:26] has been tutoring his children
[48:29] from birth
[48:34] whereas in the natural Story the tutor
[48:36] was tutoring the children but you know
[48:38] the father wasn't sitting back I mean do
[48:41] you what do you think the story is just
[48:43] let me let me Express the natural story
[48:45] of what most people seem like in their
[48:47] mind about the they can explain the
[48:50] tutor they can explain the razor and
[48:52] everything it's just like that that the
[48:54] father he he gets the baby you know
[48:56] and and the baby now we're just going a
[48:59] little bit you know maybe make it three
[49:00] four years old before you ever start
[49:02] much you know but all at once the father
[49:04] he just hands the baby over to the tutor
[49:07] and then he leaves the country
[49:12] is that what you think a doctor is that
[49:15] what you think that that the Cooter and
[49:17] the things was doing
[49:19] don't you realize that that child and
[49:21] that's why the scripture says
[49:24] yeah it is no different than a servant
[49:30] and the servants eat at the master's
[49:32] table
[49:34] you mean the tutor feeds the baby the
[49:37] tutor raised it he gives it see right
[49:42] you say wait what do you make that
[49:43] Carnival for because of the carnality of
[49:45] her mind
[49:50] you mean the child is not allowed to go
[49:52] to the table
[49:56] don't eat with a family
[50:01] and they're supplying everything he has
[50:03] need of
[50:06] who the father
[50:08] you don't throw the baby out
[50:11] he's there with the child hip and raise
[50:13] it even in the natural right right well
[50:17] what about in the spiritual when the
[50:19] spirit of the very tutor himself the
[50:21] very God himself can come back and dwell
[50:23] in you and I to be able to start us up
[50:25] the statue of a perfect man and then
[50:27] that doesn't make no difference because
[50:28] when we're born again it don't matter
[50:29] what age you are
[50:31] you know you could be born again at 10
[50:33] or you could be born again at in a
[50:35] hundred what would be the difference
[50:37] it's still a baby in Christ
[50:40] Desiring to sincere milk of the word
[50:42] that we may grow thereby
[50:44] as Peter said what being born again
[50:49] let's see Paul get Peter gave two of
[50:51] them
[50:52] I wrote it down somewhere in the notes
[50:53] I'll find it in a minute
[50:56] but it's being born again growing in
[50:59] Grace and knowledge
[51:03] all right the father is not gone
[51:06] somewhere else so that's what
[51:08] everybody's saying the father goes off
[51:10] the scene the tutor raises the child
[51:12] that's all I've ever heard
[51:16] let's see to me in this spiritual
[51:19] application the father is coming on the
[51:21] scene in the child that's what he did in
[51:24] Jesus wouldn't it right amen
[51:26] he came on receiving so much in Jesus
[51:29] until Jesus was almighty God Amen
[51:32] right amen right right
[51:34] well I can't we believe what he's done
[51:37] for us right right he give us a new bird
[51:39] amen amen then he starts feeding us sure
[51:43] maybe sometimes milk yeah sure
[51:47] that's right
[51:49] but yet growing in that the word that
[51:53] the father is supplying everything that
[51:55] we have to go
[51:58] but you know he gives it to us when he
[52:00] wants to
[52:01] because he's a good father right brother
[52:03] Gary
[52:06] he's a good father he didn't catch that
[52:08] because he's still asleep
[52:10] punching Hey Brother Gary I'm using you
[52:12] as an example
[52:13] okay
[52:16] see it's not that the father's gone
[52:20] that's right the father is not feeding
[52:22] him
[52:24] amen all the way through your spiritual
[52:27] journey amen from the new birth until
[52:30] the day the Redemption of the body will
[52:33] come it's the father
[52:37] inside of you and I preparing us
[52:40] what do you do with your children that's
[52:44] it it's gonna be about 12 years old you
[52:45] throwing the keys and don't try to go
[52:47] pay the car and drive it
[52:50] no no what do you do
[52:53] three or four or five years old what hey
[52:55] that's the break that's the guess this
[52:57] is the starting room here's the gears
[53:00] you surely don't do like uh Papa used to
[53:03] do Matthew either because he got an old
[53:05] lawnmower and Matthew you know he could
[53:07] do anything in the world I've seen him
[53:09] he'd Drive forwards right down through
[53:10] the middle of the floor I ain't kidding
[53:12] you right down through the carpet he
[53:13] would nail boards to the middle of the
[53:15] floor and I'll dish that turned around
[53:17] let's go get him the nails
[53:19] you know
[53:20] it is here but take it out on the
[53:23] lawnmower
[53:24] and he cranked that lawnmower up and ate
[53:26] a little Old Wagon thing on the back of
[53:28] it and we'll pop out shut back on that
[53:30] wagon he just turned Matthew loose he
[53:32] run over the flowers he run over the
[53:34] neighbors he run over to catch the dogs
[53:36] he run over everything in the world
[53:44] but still he don't wait
[53:48] you start telling your children right
[53:51] you're telling them table manners right
[53:55] of course that's generally gone now but
[53:58] table manners manners you know to to do
[54:01] you know to be polite
[54:04] I like the six kids like Zachary you
[54:08] know what yeah sure no yes sir no sir
[54:13] well actually kids do like that you know
[54:16] that women get offended at me when I'll
[54:18] say
[54:19] yes ma'am
[54:22] I'm not your mama
[54:24] no but I'm recognizing you as a lady
[54:27] right baby
[54:30] yes ma'am what
[54:34] the nature of the father is being
[54:37] instilled right
[54:39] all the way through your Christian
[54:40] Journey
[54:43] the statue of a perfect man is showing
[54:45] that you don't just start off down here
[54:47] and say well I jumped up here you know
[54:49] because then that's what people say now
[54:51] people say this is a doctrine that I'm
[54:54] right here where it said brotherly
[54:56] kindness lady will see an age because
[54:58] that's the age I was born there
[55:03] what does it matter about that right
[55:07] you've got to get the new birth
[55:11] you got to start
[55:13] we're all through our Christian Journey
[55:15] has been a growth development right
[55:18] yeah I've caught you over and over it's
[55:21] doing revealing of the word
[55:23] and you're sitting listening sometimes
[55:25] right and you're hearing somebody I may
[55:28] be preaching on the seals and I'm really
[55:29] just going through the shield right down
[55:31] Atlanta and you're sitting there and God
[55:33] revealed something to you about one God
[55:35] right imagine divorce something click
[55:39] all right right yes sir not even what
[55:42] I'm talking about right you know what
[55:45] I've done my job
[55:47] I probably said all I'm supposed to do
[55:49] is break this fail Satan has it over
[55:50] your eyes where God can speak straight
[55:53] to you yeah that's right amen amen do
[55:56] you understand what I'm talking about
[55:57] we're looking out there to a
[55:59] Transfiguration
[56:02] right now oh any days you take us out
[56:06] there and oh he'll speak the word
[56:15] but you don't take a child out and give
[56:17] them the keys to the car right
[56:20] but when they get 10 11 12 years old you
[56:23] start letting them do little things
[56:24] right
[56:27] I learned to travel in the backyard
[56:31] in a big old backyard
[56:33] I just take my brother's car and just
[56:35] pull up back another back on the back
[56:37] first time I decided to drive up there
[56:38] and it's that little building with a
[56:39] little house right straight across where
[56:41] you come out of the driveway from the
[56:42] house that used to be a store
[56:44] I drove up there and there's a great big
[56:45] old Road during a great big parking
[56:47] there and a great big road that goes
[56:49] over to the house and I pull in there
[56:51] and I get what I'm going and I'm back
[56:52] out and I look see if there's anything
[56:54] coming I back out I wound up the ditch
[56:56] over on the other side in the garden
[57:02] call my place to turn around in my back
[57:04] clean out of the road over on the other
[57:06] side into the ditch
[57:08] I didn't know how to drive
[57:11] oh boy I got my license I mean we'll
[57:13] forget that every time I go through
[57:14] there I think about Admiral 50 Mercury
[57:16] and I went around this courage going
[57:18] from my house toward Danny over there
[57:19] and I went around this curve and I
[57:21] remember boy I you know I was sitting at
[57:23] the truck he's holding up things the
[57:24] time I'd see it now and I just by the
[57:26] grace of God I finally made it around
[57:27] because I didn't want to go I knew
[57:29] better to turn real quick and I didn't
[57:31] turn enough and I'm going around the
[57:32] curve and I'm off the road by the time I
[57:34] finish the curve up you know
[57:37] right Mary you think you know all about
[57:42] it no to you and Hobie
[57:45] yeah when you get to be about 60 you'll
[57:49] learn how to drive
[57:50] then you're too old to know anything
[57:52] about it
[57:53] but you understand now the point I'm
[57:55] trying to make everybody get the point
[57:57] I'm trying to make a point right and my
[58:00] point is one thing
[58:02] why don't look back we don't look
[58:04] forward
[58:06] I thought we believe that I am men ever
[58:09] present for eternity amen I thought
[58:12] that's what the definition the prophet
[58:14] gave of I am
[58:16] see there's no yesterday with tomorrow
[58:18] and with God and there's no
[58:21] tomorrow
[58:22] everything's present tense
[58:25] he's not over there he's right here
[58:28] living with us and I spend the father
[58:30] down to our life from a debate today we
[58:32] were a birth as a baby
[58:34] in the spiritual Kingdom we started our
[58:37] adoption
[58:39] the tutor came on the scene and he
[58:41] started raising us
[58:45] he's been doing that for some of us for
[58:47] 40 years
[58:50] just a little slow
[58:53] if it don't matter
[58:56] power in the tortoise prove that right
[58:58] amen
[59:00] now that's highest you are so
[59:02] continually just grinding used to call
[59:05] her and he said that's the way he
[59:06] preached he said it's like a cat
[59:09] in the ground I just don't when it's
[59:11] tall
[59:12] you said that's impossible you never
[59:14] didn't know what he was saying that's
[59:16] not impossible
[59:22] because once that tongue touches that
[59:24] grinding stone a couple of grains of
[59:26] that rhinestones coming off
[59:28] oh yeah the tongue is being cut and sure
[59:30] you ain't gonna lick it again for a
[59:32] while but it's just like the prophet
[59:34] always said about it if you pray about
[59:36] something he said maybe a few grains
[59:38] will move today
[59:41] yep but he said there's something taking
[59:43] place
[59:44] why can't we see in our Christian
[59:46] Journey there's something been taking
[59:48] place
[59:49] oh we're waiting on something out there
[59:51] or no I'm happy where I'm at
[59:56] I'm satisfied see we start out on our
[1:00:00] simple Journey
[1:00:02] with a cougar training this simple thing
[1:00:07] and then he just keeps training us
[1:00:09] that's right
[1:00:11] see Peter calls it being born again and
[1:00:14] then he calls it growing in grace and
[1:00:16] the knowledge of Our Lord
[1:00:18] the whole Bible
[1:00:20] oh he's not pointing back and it's
[1:00:23] not pointing future heard some things in
[1:00:25] the Bible that would face and there are
[1:00:26] some things that'll be future yes sir
[1:00:28] because it's the word of God but the
[1:00:30] main thing God wants us to see is where
[1:00:32] we're at right now
[1:00:36] you're not going to get any fake on
[1:00:37] what's coming
[1:00:41] right
[1:00:42] you get more faith off of what has
[1:00:44] already been than you do off of what's
[1:00:46] coming right
[1:00:49] but you see
[1:00:51] I want to live right where I'm at
[1:00:54] present tense gospel
[1:00:57] see watch Ben I wrote it like this he
[1:01:00] wants Ben for some of us 40 years
[1:01:03] in our tutoring in her child training
[1:01:06] because God wants to raise his children
[1:01:11] to be his children that's right
[1:01:14] and he may have to tell us and Hope
[1:01:17] brother said I know from God when I
[1:01:21] asked him he said it's just as much as
[1:01:23] it would be he told me yes right that's
[1:01:26] right now how many of us do
[1:01:29] we asked for something to be removed
[1:01:32] from us and it's not immediately gone
[1:01:40] was it going from Paul about his
[1:01:42] eyesight
[1:01:44] that's right
[1:01:46] but you see what he was talking about
[1:01:47] this side but why not use all of it it
[1:01:49] wasn't going about his eyesight
[1:01:51] but he said to the Lord
[1:01:55] your grace is sufficient
[1:02:00] this year is on me for a reason
[1:02:04] we should see we can take every sickness
[1:02:06] and try to make it something that's on
[1:02:08] there for a reason
[1:02:10] you know let's don't do everything okay
[1:02:14] see Jesus didn't even preach the gospel
[1:02:18] until he was 30 29 and a half years old
[1:02:23] is that true
[1:02:25] but it's somewhere around 13 14 years
[1:02:29] old he was straightening out the
[1:02:30] Pharisees
[1:02:33] he didn't wait till he got dire to just
[1:02:35] start talking about the word
[1:02:37] you understand he was in a growth
[1:02:40] development
[1:02:42] being a child learning he obedience
[1:02:44] through the things that he suffered and
[1:02:45] being made perfect he become what
[1:02:49] see we must in our training sometimes
[1:02:51] it's just a little at the time
[1:02:56] wouldn't it be wonderful to live in a
[1:02:58] place to where every time you open the
[1:03:00] Bible God had just quickened it to you
[1:03:02] or you take a put a tape on or you you
[1:03:05] read a message or something and you just
[1:03:07] you just turn it on and got it just
[1:03:09] quickened it right there wouldn't that
[1:03:10] be a wonderful place
[1:03:12] no I'd raise a bunch of see if it's
[1:03:14] bombs
[1:03:16] you say no no well okay
[1:03:19] but you see sometimes we read the same
[1:03:22] thing over and over and over
[1:03:25] and all at once one day he speaks to us
[1:03:28] well you know that that's your father
[1:03:31] he knows you got need of something so he
[1:03:33] quickened that
[1:03:35] it may be as I said one God when the
[1:03:37] preacher is preaching on the seals or
[1:03:39] something
[1:03:42] you understand what my point is it comes
[1:03:46] true with what now
[1:03:49] how does our growth development come
[1:03:53] through the opening of the word amen
[1:03:55] right
[1:03:58] through the opening of the word
[1:04:01] well
[1:04:03] you know who the problem is there's a
[1:04:04] bunch of preachers that ain't been
[1:04:06] getting into the word and preaching the
[1:04:07] word that's the reason you're looking
[1:04:09] back the reason you're looking forward
[1:04:12] because they can't see what's going on
[1:04:14] right
[1:04:18] the prophet made a statement one day he
[1:04:19] said you can't understand
[1:04:23] the seals
[1:04:25] until you understand Daniel 70 weeks
[1:04:29] did he say that amen well
[1:04:33] you know who wants to know about Daniel
[1:04:35] 70 weeks that's right
[1:04:38] see everybody knows you're all about to
[1:04:40] see you don't know about Daniel said you
[1:04:42] leave
[1:04:45] but I didn't make the statement the
[1:04:47] prophet did
[1:04:48] yep he said you can't understand
[1:04:54] well he was wrong here and he was wrong
[1:04:56] there and he wouldn't
[1:04:58] you know and if you can correct him then
[1:05:00] you must be God
[1:05:04] what do you understand my poem
[1:05:09] something is going on
[1:05:11] the greatest thing that could ever be in
[1:05:14] the world
[1:05:15] is the trial the child training of a
[1:05:19] child up to bring it to an adulthood
[1:05:24] and the father's right there with you
[1:05:26] just like I said the natural father he's
[1:05:28] sitting right at that table and the
[1:05:30] tutor he may not even see him but he's
[1:05:33] looking and he says
[1:05:36] I see some good things about tutor's
[1:05:38] going to do a good job
[1:05:40] okay
[1:05:43] but you know what your Prophet said too
[1:05:48] he said that tutor would have to come up
[1:05:50] and said the Holy Spirit would have to
[1:05:51] say sometimes that your children are not
[1:05:53] acting right
[1:05:54] the defussing and arguing and
[1:05:56] complaining and griping
[1:06:01] he said they're not acting right
[1:06:05] father said okay
[1:06:08] now here's one that's hard sometimes for
[1:06:10] us to understand
[1:06:12] but around him and referring to it one
[1:06:14] day he said the tutor said father
[1:06:18] that I've made your children sick
[1:06:22] you want to quote for these
[1:06:24] right sure you said they just raised
[1:06:28] their hands and said Thank You Lord and
[1:06:31] it says by Stripes I'm Healed whatever's
[1:06:34] going on my father's got a reason for
[1:06:36] this let me find a reason and get out of
[1:06:39] it amen
[1:06:44] see we can quote a lot of things like
[1:06:46] the prophet of saying says father your
[1:06:50] daughters
[1:06:52] cutting a her and wearing clothes and
[1:06:54] painting her face is not correct
[1:06:59] that's where we want to do then we want
[1:07:01] to justify something we want to turn
[1:07:02] around and say Well they're not born
[1:07:04] again they're not children of God
[1:07:07] your Prophet said Do Well
[1:07:11] you better change your attitude
[1:07:16] he said they're yours they're my
[1:07:18] children
[1:07:22] man it got drunk right
[1:07:25] sure
[1:07:26] what's his name
[1:07:28] Smith or something
[1:07:31] Ramsey in the Hebrew series
[1:07:35] got him some beer and went out and sat
[1:07:37] down got drunk a preacher
[1:07:43] God took him off to see
[1:07:46] he said he couldn't let his child marry
[1:07:48] his name
[1:07:51] we don't look at them things
[1:07:55] we've got a set of standards in our own
[1:07:57] minds that we call
[1:08:00] the word of God
[1:08:03] and we look at others as those standards
[1:08:05] if they don't meet them
[1:08:08] they're out
[1:08:14] but we failed to quote what brought
[1:08:16] around would say your sons and daughters
[1:08:18] are doing wrong
[1:08:21] but
[1:08:22] we want to save the devil's children the
[1:08:24] ones doing wrong
[1:08:30] think on these things
[1:08:32] take on these things
[1:08:35] my whole point
[1:08:37] we've been in
[1:08:38] the most wonderful thing that could ever
[1:08:41] be
[1:08:42] is to those that know what's been going
[1:08:45] on that's right for 40 years I preached
[1:08:48] it to you
[1:08:50] I preached child training tutorship
[1:08:54] for 40 years
[1:08:58] trying to get you and me to see
[1:09:01] something's going on
[1:09:09] don't look back don't look forward
[1:09:14] the things that are past you can do
[1:09:16] nothing about it the future will come
[1:09:18] because God promised it
[1:09:21] right she said he won't send a headstone
[1:09:22] on your marriage right he said he'll
[1:09:25] send it because he promised it
[1:09:31] but you know what he wants us to do it's
[1:09:32] just
[1:09:34] it's like that two to train us
[1:09:40] maybe tutors such a father tutor
[1:09:42] assistant inside teacher we don't have
[1:09:44] an outside teacher it's an inside
[1:09:46] teacher right we don't have an outside
[1:09:48] tutor we do that in a natural world but
[1:09:51] we have an inside tutor which is the
[1:09:52] Holy Spirit
[1:09:55] let him raise us
[1:09:59] okay
[1:10:02] number two nine number 290 I surrender
[1:10:06] all amen
[1:11:22] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:11:25] Christ
[1:12:14] only because you're worship
[1:12:33] okay
[1:13:28] we're going through everything
[1:13:34] brilliant turtle
[1:13:38] s
[1:13:54] I'm trying my best to get to see one
[1:13:56] thing
[1:13:57] we've been going through a journey
[1:14:01] in fact there's a Christian Journey
[1:14:03] right you may think nothing's going on
[1:14:08] but what would it be when we get over
[1:14:10] there
[1:14:11] and those that are back behind us and
[1:14:13] the ones waiting on us are saying yep if
[1:14:17] you hadn't went through that trials and
[1:14:18] troubles and tests in fact you'd have
[1:14:21] never come to the right place
[1:14:22] that's right
[1:14:24] that's enough
[1:14:27] look what you went through but my point
[1:14:30] is one thing we don't think we're going
[1:14:31] through a thing
[1:14:34] the prophet said the spirit they used
[1:14:36] back there to give their lives is the
[1:14:38] spirit you use to this daily overcome
[1:14:41] and I've told you over and over
[1:14:44] you bring them brothers down here they
[1:14:46] couldn't stand it all right
[1:14:50] he said oh yes it can well they're not
[1:14:53] here
[1:14:54] they're waiting on you and I if they're
[1:14:57] waiting on you or not they never admit
[1:14:59] it to say we couldn't have took the
[1:15:01] pressure
[1:15:02] that's right
[1:15:04] you did
[1:15:06] right just living day by day yep
[1:15:12] as a Christian
[1:15:16] uh you make it to where we just you know
[1:15:18] we just you know
[1:15:22] tough day by day my father is revealing
[1:15:25] his word right and it may be a long time
[1:15:27] sometime between what he reveals tonight
[1:15:29] and he meets me the next time
[1:15:32] that's no problem
[1:15:36] how's your school
[1:15:39] just keep walking down that line
[1:15:44] I don't know what I'm gonna preach after
[1:15:45] I finish this series but you know what
[1:15:48] I'm sure there'll be something sure
[1:15:49] right because I'm not worried about it
[1:15:53] I think I learned to trust my father
[1:15:54] amen it's what I've always tried to
[1:15:57] explain and you can't explain a gift
[1:15:59] but I've always tried to explain to you
[1:16:01] you know it
[1:16:02] if I could have the confidence in
[1:16:04] everything
[1:16:06] that I have in the basis that God will
[1:16:09] meet me and give me a message to preach
[1:16:11] to the people
[1:16:12] if I could have that confidence in
[1:16:15] everything else
[1:16:16] we wouldn't be here today
[1:16:20] because I can just say well Lord
[1:16:22] come and give me a message
[1:16:25] and he's never failed me yet
[1:16:28] but then I asked him for healing don't
[1:16:30] get it
[1:16:31] I ask you for you for healing we don't
[1:16:34] get it
[1:16:35] these child training us
[1:16:39] you say oh no that's an excuse I don't
[1:16:41] make excuses I tell the truth
[1:16:44] you tell the truth you'll have to make
[1:16:46] excuses
[1:16:50] child training
[1:16:52] all the way from the time
[1:16:54] of use
[1:16:55] the new birth all the way up through is
[1:16:59] child support training
[1:17:02] think on these things really
[1:17:06] and just just remember this place I

[1:17:30] something that's been going on all
[1:17:32] through our Christian Journey
[1:17:34] we don't have to look back but we look
[1:17:36] back and see where you led us
[1:17:39] we don't have to look to the Future
[1:17:41] because we know you will lead us
[1:17:44] but we look at the present tense right
[1:17:46] now and see you dwelling Among Us
