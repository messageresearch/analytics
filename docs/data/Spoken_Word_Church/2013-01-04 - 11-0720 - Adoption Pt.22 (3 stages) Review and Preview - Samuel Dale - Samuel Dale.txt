him too don't you I believe we're seeing him through the opening of the word that's the main part where we at now because he's not here physically but he's here to reveal himself amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Ephesians 1 and we're still in Romans 8 now what we want to do tonight is kind of have a kind of like a review back you know and pick up the message and bring it up to a place and then uh you know kind of where we're at and then uh talk about what we expecting to come are a future part of it the and we'll call it review and preview but it's still message number 22 on the adoption in three stages but I want to cover that with you and and to make sure we're lined up and you understanding what I'm saying you know and what I'm trying to bring to you and then that way we can go from there cuz there is some things that we are expecting to take place that's right and there is some things that we know have taken place that's right so somewhere in between there is where we're dwelling right and I'm happy about it had a good good time this past weekend with brother brother Keith Brown there and enjoyed his messages and things I hope that you enjoyed it and have a good time with him you know we really appreciate it amen Ephesians 1 Romans 8 our heavenly father we thank you Lord for most of all for being you and then being you then you can reveal yourself unto us we ask you to help us to understand because Lord we truly in this hour desire to see you with our spiritual lives because we we don't want to see you yet with our physical because we couldn't stand that it's why the prophet said even these bodies would have to be changed for us to meet you in the air so we we don't want that part others may be talking about but we don't want that part of it we want to have it our spiritual eyes opened unto the revealed word and Lord just be with us forgive our sins bless those that are sick among us remember Jeffrey there Lord with the the the problem with the the antibiotics or whatever it is causing his sickness and we ask you to just take care of that and let everything be all right we love you and we thank you guide us each one tonight as we speak about you then you come and speak unto us and lead us by thy Grace in Jesus name amen amen Ephesians one the next Minister visiting Minister will be brother Quinn will be the seventh I think it is of August is blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved now let's go back to Romans 8 where we've read from and we'll read verse 8 through I mean verse uh 14 through 23 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry out by father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then ours ours of God and join ours with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected to same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the Redemption of our body man may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said I want to I want to review kind of you know come back start and come up and just put it in one message and review and then uh we will try to uh you know preview some things which means like get a preview of what to expect where we're at and what's going on and then to move on into what to expect now the prophet of God said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here her purpose and things that she would be then you know uh as he would call it maybe in another place an invisible Invincible Army that would be able to walk off of this Earth in a Rapture all right but now we've been talking about adoption we've been talking about it in three stages which is like your new birth adoption and that's why Paul would say that in Romans 8:14 and all through there 15 and and you know being the spirit of adoption and showing who we are as the children of God you know and by the new birth we are ours and join ours with Jesus Christ by the new birth see we don't have to wait this is not a time in the end time to wait to come to something I believe that's our biggest problem and the basis of what I'll be preaching on for the next 6 months or 6 years I don't know which way we'll be on trying to get you and I to realize Who We Are by what God has said about us all right because that's the only way that we can do it and then we'll we'll try to cover a lot of things but see Paul said we've received the spirit of adoption see all right so that's the Holy Spirit when you receive the new birth all right now then there is a time of going from the new birth with the growth development of the stature of a perfect man Etc I'll say this again in just a minute but to just put you to a point to let you think about it and then coming out to the adoption and then you know that adoption being the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of a living God and in comparison with the same as the Lord Jesus on a matter of transfiguration but then coming to to Wi as Paul said in verse 23 to to Wi to understand the Redemption of the body now I I want you to think about it cuz I've made this statement many times throughout the series uh if you'll notice I I haven't spoke about the uh basically the change of the body as much as we've been trying to talk about the Revelation right all right right now I hope everybody follows that because see to me the adoption the being in three stages is completed in the basis or or was to be completed in the basis of an understanding of the Redemption of the body see then will come the Redemption of the body see then will come the change then will come the things and I've asked you to look up those words and I won't get to it tonight or and probably W Sunday morning but maybe Sunday afternoon it's just according to how it goes cuz I'm just waiting I've asked you to look up the words glorified and uh you know translation and and remember to look up to what brother brandham says about those things and that way you know maybe we'll get into something all right but now you you follow me what I'm saying see the adoption in three stages is not taking you to the change right that is a fulfillment of what you've been going through all the time right you've been in that process from the time you received the New Birth when you received that new birth you you were in a process all right right being born again as Peter would say and even talking about the fact that when we receive the new birth that God laid claim on that body that you're living in that's right and see you're not to expect to get a new body or nothing like that because he's already laid climb to it that's right he gave you the new birth while you were in this body you know so why would he want to give you another body somewhere down the road see and that's why I don't believe that you know that the people understand the the point of what the prophet is trying to say that we don't get a new body it's this body made new you say well I know what the prophet said new new that's right but check all he's talking about that's right I believe in this body made new right amen because it's not going to be of the same let me rephrase I was fixing to say something but it's not going to be exactly like it is right because if this body is redeemed it would mean it would go back see and if it goes back it's got to have a place to go back to and if it goes back then uh there's something got to happen and we're not going to be and I hope you listen to what I'm saying uh this pull pit was a piece of wood at one time it has went through a process and brought it down to where that it is now and then by that process the it it has reached its goal and you and I one day will reach a place to where that we can be changed in a moment the twink of an eye and you'll see then why the prophet would say and they asked him said what is this great translation conduct order and Doctrine he said just to change right it just as simple he said just to change then he explained how that would taken place and we've been through that before but I I want you to stay with me tonight and let's just review a little all right see talking about adoption in three stages see first is your new birth all right now we know the story in case somebody hears it out you know and uh don't understand things uh the scripture said in John 1:11 that he came came to his own but his own received him not but as many as received him gave he power to become the sons of God see not all Israel is Israel right amen all right see it's not that way all right so then he came to his own to receive them and it would be then a a a kingdom to be set up and then that Kingdom would be different from what most people would be even thinking because even to we talk about adoption uh Romans 9 and4 you'll find that adoption pertained to the Israelites so does the covenants the Commandments the the oracles the the things see come to Israel why because he had to come that way to be what he's just what I just quoted from John that he would come to his own because Israel was his chosen people right in the Old Testament it was a people chosen now I'm going to preach on that the Lord willing Sunday uh on chosen maybe Sunday evening but anyhow Chosen and uh but it's not you know we want to keep the point of listening see adoption pertaineth pertain to them right they had to right they had the lineage they had the the promises we were Gentiles we didn't have any promise whatsoever that's right we had nothing now we had examples or types and shadows that like Rahab the Harlot and things like that down in the Old Testament while it was being done but still you got to remember one thing he was dealing strictly with them that's right all right cuz they were his people right now you could become a proelite unto the Jewish faith you know and things like that that was fine but that still didn't make you a chosen people of God like Israel was first in her beginning all right but see then when she rejected him that's right then it would show that he would now have to come to the Gentiles which Gentiles means Nations all right the the Israelites are in this Gentile Gentile means Nations it mean Russia China Israel uh whatever it just means Nations and see that was what he was showing in the tops and the Shadows that it was going to come to that as Paul said the mystery of the bringing in of the Gentiles right all right and in doing and bringing into to the Gentiles it would show what he was doing with Ruth and Boaz and all of the tops and shadows that it would come to pass but now remember this is a kingdom that he come to set up the natural Israelite people were looking for a king yep all right that's right they were looking for a messiah y absolutely they were looking looking for all of the promises of the Bible right to be fulfilled right right but when he came the way he came they wouldn't accept him had he rolled out as the prophet would refer to a carpet right down to and walk up to Kus and say oh cus boy you stayed with it you know you're really something and here I am now we're going to take over well Israel could have received that that was their idea but that was not God's plan amen because he come to set up a kingdom y a kingdom that would not be dealing with the natural flesh right amen right see this Kingdom I'm talking about the one that Jesus spoke of in the Matthew Mark Luke and John of the kingdom of God you know and the kingdom of heaven and all it's not speaking of these natural flesh beings it's speaking of a spiritual Kingdom see that he would be the head of that Kingdom om all right and then he would come down and be able to transmit into the human being that would be living in this domain or Kingdom you know transmit with inside of us the new birth right all right making us then the children of God now the prophet's right when he's saying that God adopted his own children cuz that's what he does cuz now he's moving it from bringing it into a birth he's bringing it through the development down through in the end time to the adoption stages all right amen but see get to Point what I'm saying we had to get the new birth but you know every Israelite right that ever got saved had to get the new birth right just because they were Israelites did not bring them the to Wi the red I mean did not bring bring to them the the spirit of adoption right that's right just because they were Israelites right now sure the day of Pentecost 120 were Israelites the 3,000 outside were Israelites yes but see then immediately it changes to a gentile dispensation but to show that's what it was going to be you remember we tried to preach this many many years ago to show it was going to be a dispensation Jesus went around picking them out Peter James right John yep not as a nation right amen he wasn't comeing to deal as a nation then that's right see that the adoption would pertain unto the Israelites see all the promises and everything is to Israel but they rejected it all right right but he came to set up a kingdom the new birth amen that new birth BR brought you and I into the body of Christ that's right all right see then you got the growth development you got the stature of a perfect man you got the things to transpire that is taught there in the word and it you know the prophet preached those things unto us and we must not be just babies tossed to and fro with every little wind of Doctrine but we must grow in Grace and knowledge all that's written in the Bible amen all right but knowing and realizing then that something was missing those disciples had the faith of the fathers right amen all right you see that faith of the fathers glasting on down as the prophet would cover it on down into the fourth Church age right see when you would get down to Columba and all of those they would still be dealing with the faith of the fathers maybe getting smaller in amounts yes but still it was there for the people but then you seeing it as it's passing away and that was what Jesus said the corner of wheat must die and fall into the ground or it will abide alone speaking of himself but speaking then of what would happen to the church right all right see then we must be restored back to that faith of the fathers before we can even talk about a change of the body am are the things see all right then that's why that I've tried to cover it to you and and give you examples of showing you see that we started a new birth that's right Jesus started not having to have a new birth but receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit on the River Jordan yes and God saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell all right see then when he gives you an i of a new birth you remember that that that he's still saying this is whom I'm pleased to dwell why because if he's not in you you don't have the new birth right and if he's in you then he's pleased to dwell in you or he wouldn't be in you right is that plain enough that's right but see that was what I was trying to get to point to us to where we could see it all right see then we have to to follow the prophet's message in the line of growth development bringing us from the New Birth being in the family of God now remember the family I'm talking about is a spiritual condition not a physical condition right if it was a physical condition you'd be required to be Jewish in your lineage you know natural y because that's what they think and that was what it was for them but they rejected that and God turned to the Gentiles right to bring us into the position to where we could be brought into the family of God by the new birth or adopted see then we must grow through the growth development see y coming to a place and see Jesus being an example not having to get a new birth right but yet he was an example pleased to dwell all right we get the new birth that makes us the children of God God identifies us as his children by giving you the new birth that's why you cry out by father all right father father coming out and doing it then you have to have the growth development that's right the Lord Jesus went through three years of growth development and then he finally came to a man of transfiguration experience all right amen now you remember that he went to a amount of transfiguration experience to where it was not just my beloved Son but then it became what hear ye him all right now that would be in the adoption and we must come to that right amen but see that's the growth development that I tried to explain we must come to a place to where that he can not only say I'm pleased to dwell but say hear ye him all right that's right coming into the position of the adoption right amen all right now we know for a certainty the prophet taught it we brought it out and tried to explain it that even though the disciples had the faith of the fathers but still having the faith of the fathers that did not bring the adoption back to the position of the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God that's right as Jesus had it to hear ye him right all right see that would have to be when the head would unite all right yep you remember when we were bringing that out see when it come to the place there on the Mount of transfiguration The Headstone was there which was almighty God Amen showing and manifesting showing full Authority right and from that he goes to the change all right now but see we come to the position of the The Authority being brought back to the church thank you Lord and see what what gets me about it is is when you speak of authority everybody wants to jump all the way Hallelujah way off out your under somewhere why not just take it where we're at right that has been my argument I guess you call it ever since I've been in this message why can't we realize what's God is doing right amen well if we had what we talked about having we'd have this we'd have that we'd have that show me in the Bible where that was at right you got count but what about all the other accounts you got times that it would say Peter and John you know would say I don't have it but in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk amen well we've seen people rise up and walk we've seen people healed we seen people delivered that's right when are we going to quit looking for something to come and look at what's taking place am I tried to explain it to you and I know when I do that that it's automatically going to drive you away from the and I I know now what that is and and I'll get to it Sunday but when you try to explain something people will go away from it because they'll have the wrong idea right see people think when I say look at what's going on that I'm not looking for more to come no I'm looking for greater and greater and greater and greater things to transpire all but I'm also looking at what has transpired amen that's right right amen MH and I tried had to explain it for all these 40 years here that take this group of take that group of people that was back there with the faith of the fathers bring them down here where we are now right and let them live under this environment in this place and these denominations they fought too Pharisees and Sadducees right and we have 969 that was just way back under 40 years ago or 50 and then 2,000 or more in this message right of those demons and they're all loosed on us those 200,000,000 demons was not loosed on the apostles back there right I'm not trying to justify something I'm trying to tell it like it is right where we'll believe it that's right and have an opportunity to believe it Lord will if I can drive that down Sunday I want to get it hard to let let you see we've got to quit looking for something and start looking at what's taking place that's right amen right and by doing that then we've got to see what God has been doing that's right well look out there quit looking out there right righten M that's anointed ones those disciples and thing wasn't facing that like we are no right I'm not trying to justify nothing I can stand here and talk about the things I've seen and the healings that God has taken place so you know I'm not trying to just justify something right amen but you see Church to try to preach the truth is the hardest thing that is the prophet said cuz he said preaching a lie is easy people will fall for it like everything right but if this message is not preached correctly God will not come and honor it that's right amen all right see that's why I've been so jealous about what I've tried to do not comparing with brother random when he was saying he so zealous of the word that he planted but you you better be zealous of the word that's in your heart amen amen whether you be men women children or who you are that's right amen we can't flop flip flop around in this day all right right but you see the Lord Jesus came to the Mount of transfiguration was when the head and body United in him amen then he went forth from there all right now I've tried my best to explain to you for 40 something years that The Headstone to the Bride of Jesus Christ is the revealed word amen now I'm not talking about the anointing I'm not talking about the thing I'm talking about the headstone right amen that's right right that we'll get to it at the light of the message where that brother randam covered how that those two tables of stone come in that Temple and there was still nothing going on right amen but they had to be in there before anything could start taking place right amen right I believe the headstone to the Bride of Jesus Christ when that Prophet brought those Seven Seals right amen there's a headstone yes sir come into the church because the same he was the Cornerstone which is the face of the fathers he's The Headstone the fully revealed word am but you see what I'm talking about see we take the adoption and we take there was the Lord Jesus River Jordan and then Mount of transfiguration and then he brought a message right and I tried my best to explain that to you that's what happened to brother brandom y there he was received the new birth started God raising him up because he was a prophet right he could receive the word amen and when he walked in that word one day he walked right on into the fully revealed word the opening of those seals right and then he brought his message amen see we look at adoption that's trying to say oh one of these days we're going to get the Redemption of this body it's already started you receive the new birth you're adop your Redemption has already started amen that's right we just need to wait until it's completed amen see and the finish of it to where we can come to it see all right on matter of transfiguration there is The Headstone that came y right to prove it was he went right over and preached Matthew 24 y he was the word right amen right and the prophet say the Ten Commandments came those seals come down that's I believe it's unveiling of God right he covers it making the seals and The Headstone and the the Commandments the same but see we're looking for something to happen but get back into the Bible with it amen find out what's in the Bible to see what we're doing that's right when that head and body unites then there's a message to be brought amen not another message when the head you with the Lord Jesus is what what we call in top at a mount Transfiguration he didn't change his message right right sir amen it was a deeper depth of the same message amen right right right bringing it more into understanding all right right see when brother randam received the new birth and then taught up through the statue of perfect man and the seals open to him he said it become a a new book but was it a different book no why did he preach Christ the Myster of God revealed in after the seals broke right why did he preach who is this mzc after the seal bro he just went into a deeper depth and that's all we've ever done that's all I've ever tried to get you to see that's right what you see today is just a foundation for what's tomorrow but if we don't get the foundation right today what's tomorrow worth that's that's that bothers me because I know that's what people are are doing but just just get to Point see when that head United with that body he had a message to bring that's right when that head United with brother Bram out there I believe in Tucson Arizona you can believe what you want to that's up your business cuz you'll do it anyway but you show me where it met with him at show me where it Compares with the the prophet saying he'd meet you and give you something for the people right you show me any other place than the the 63 when he met that out there right all right but see he comes from th preaching a message am cuz that's what he was saying on Christ the Myster God revealed and gave to you page 76 what does he say 1963 728 and the word and God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body and watch it that is redeemed to bring the message in the last days and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and to restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning gardeny the three-fold mystery of God he said that when the head would Unite with the body it bring its own message that's exactly what transpired right he was standing there preaching the message right right showing that the head had United with him may not have been nobody else in the world with it but that don't make no difference that's right if that head can Unite with one person it can fulfill all the scriptures remember John on Pat must represented the entire bride as one person y right but see you and I then have got to come to the place that's right by way of the message let's see the the Bible becomes a brand new book I've heard people be in the message 6 months and quote that boy when them seals broke to me the Bible become a brand new book I'm not arguing with nobody I'm just selling it like it is don't give a novice to the novice is one to mess it up just asked a few questions that's all you got to do somebody tells you the Bible came a brand new book when the seal broke say well well is Daniel 70 weeks do you have an understanding to that what that got to do with it yeah CU your Prophet said y if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks you cannot understand the seals I didn't say that your Prophet said it on the Daniel 70 week series amen all right see just ask if few questions and asking a few questions you'll find out where the people believe what they believe or not or is it just a quote right that's but now listen see then it's got to be that when the body of Christ all right we covered brother brandom he brought the message righten we're not looking for another message we're not looking for another Prophet to come somebody else to come and explain it to us or tell us all about it cuz brother random was confused no sir be if that's it pull your shoe off on the kiss your toe cuz you got to be almighty God that's not a joke because the next would have to be almighty God that's why brother random would bring and he didn't say the fullness of the godhead bodily dwell in the prophet he said the fullness of the godhead bodily would dwell in The Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time that's right yes sir go to the unveiling of God and the Mighty God unveil and see if I'm right see if the prophet said the fullness of the godhead bodily would dwell and the bride amen and see if he makes these statements where he said that the godhead is not complete without you amen but are you listening see that Prophet proved he came to adoption yep all right God proved it Vindicated it come down and proved it there at the Tabernacle and the things and proved it but he had a message to bring amen right well what we got to do brother they just bring his message that's right I agree with you but we got to bring it in the correct order right right amen if it's not in the correct order it's not his message amen that's correct that's why I told you many times that he used to let other people preach and then he would come out behind him and perform the the signs you know and the and the healings and he stopped doing that and started preaching his own message right m CU he he knew they wouldn't bring it the way he want it brought that's right and he knew there was a message to come right there was a message to come and he knew that cuz if it was a healing to come there had to be a message follow it amen that's right and see then it would follow that okay and it would come out to that position see all right but then what would it bring see when the headstone would unite or United with an individual the Lord Jesus man of transfiguration brother brand where you want to put it I say out in Arizona 63 whatever you want to do it you got to still admit it came and you got to admit it was adopted you got to admit it come to the place to where it would hear ye him you got to admit that because he comes over to the marriage and divorce and and he actually speaks into first person and says I say right see then in doing that see then that was bringing it to the bride of Christ and when the bride of Christ comes to the place to where that she can be adopted as an individual because that's the way God does it he adopts individuals he doesn't adopt a group he doesn't adopt a nation or a people like that he adopts individuals that's right all right then when all the individuals are adopted see then the body will be complete and The Headstone will be United with the body body it ain't that you got to have each individual get adopted and then come up to a place and then well now we're all adopted now here comes adoption no that's that is your adoption yeah right when you adopted as individuals into the body of Christ then God can do great things yes but then see the message would have to Spring out from that right that's it what message a message would spring out from The Headstone uniting with you right cuz it did from the Lord Jesus it did from brother brandom and if a if a person in this Bride is a a Capt individual in The Headstone not like I told you about the brother told me years ago said they I got the new birth I doed right there headstone everything well I didn't agree with him I certainly didn't agree with the other fell though but that's all right right but listen see you remember how we tried to bring it out the other day the Lord Jesus wants that headstone United with him to man of transfiguration y he went forth to explain the Redemption of the body now you remember that message a few weeks ago and how that brother brandham when the head United with him and the Bible became a brand new book and he began to preach the things after the seals broken the things like that that it come to a place that he was explaining to Wi to understand he had reached the third stage of adoption the third third stage of the adop adoption is not the change of the body right amen I've tried to explain that the third stage of adoption is to bring us to an understanding of to we to understand the Redemption of our bodies right amen it's not something that we come up to a certain place and in this no it's what is taking place so the head and body can unite to bring the message not a different message not something else the prophet did bring right come on no but to bring forth what he has brought unto us amen then I asked a question I said do you understand that you're just as perfect as God is that's right that's hard for the human being to accept isn't it yes Lord that's right but you know what somebody some days is going to understand that that's right amen and they're not just going to be talking about it it won't be a quote right amen it'll be a revelation amen that's right and when it is God can take it and make it come to passen now remember it's got to be revealed see so what is the third stage of adoption it's not the coming of The Headstone right come on it's the coming of the understanding it's the message The Headstone will bring to bring us to an understanding of to Wi to understand how this body is going to be redeemed amen all right see then as it brings forth what will it be it be like the prophet said on sign of the this time number two on you note 63 11-13 and this great life's great step must come into the Perfection that the Holy Spirit has to live in that church so perfectly it'll make the head and the body unite together see that that's the body he is the head in the body now listen to him read it he is the head in the body I'm not misquoting that you read it yourself now we find that he promised in this last days that that would be done we find it the last great step y to take place when the head and body unites is a great step to take place there's a message to sweep out now may I say it again not another message that's right when Jesus come to his position he had preached a lot of things but when he reached that position of the headstone he brought a message to him Amen brother randam had preached a lot of things but when he come to that headstone that adoption he preached his message cuz as we proved it showed it he said that not in the preparation of the years and things like uh the Rapture message he said not in the preparation but he said when he begins to bring his message brother R's message began with the seals opening and then he brought the message of redemption right amen so I've invited you to go and even read the titles after the seals broke Christ the mystery future home things that are to be who is this male chesd married and divorce everything goes into a future extent even the titles of the message itself shows of what he was bringing well when are we going to get into it that way right well we're just in the message we're in the message but what are we doing why can't we see what God has already done amen sure when the when the pyramid is completed and the head will Unite with the body see there will be the fully revealed word standing there amen that's right all right now as it is then the prophet told you what that would be what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ or what shall I do with Jesus 63 11:24 their big church is to be United the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just exactly like even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight through disguise the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit righten all right amen so what will it be when The Headstone unites with the body something's going to take place amen that's right right something's going to transpire amen a refilling of the Holy Ghost is going to take place absolutely all right now to show you a little future what we're talking about you remember in First Kings 8 and6 through 11 or go into 2 chonicles is really better 5 9-14 if you write them down and read them you'll find that that was where when Solomon finished the temple when Solomon finished the temple come on Solomon done all he could do that's right now I'm reading brother random if you look down on dedication you'll see it did you notice after the building was completed it was still an empty building yep there was nothing in it but Furniture right I'm reading bre around so Solomon had done all he could do now the great day of dedication come when they were going to dedicate this building for worshippers to worship something now watch worship something now without Something There To Worship the building would have been in vain are you listening but the building was now ready for dedication now it was nothing there but Furniture now they were outside if you read and they were offering sacrifices by the thousands y all kind of things was transpiring cuz they were getting ready the priest was ready washed clean yep and I'll tell you what I bet you that the cleanest fell you've ever seen that's right because if I was going to do what he done you better believe amen it would take more than chor rocks right to clean me up and you could scrub me with a scrub brush with Red Devil eye soap and I wouldn't have said a word you know why because he was fixing to go in a position that if he wouldn't clean he was dead everything was ready y everything thing was set now I know the high priest didn't go in right there so just go on you got to keep reading your scripture to get the rest of it right but now look nothing there but Furniture nothing there to worship now watch and the Levites positionally took their place went into the corner and got their H run them through the rings on the ark now this is the building of the temple not the one Moses done in the wilderness so that sacrifices and things the high priest had already done back there in case you missed what I said want ago but watch what he says run through the rings on the ark where the tables of stone was on the inside two tables of stone yep same Stone these two are one same Commandments same Covenant when these two tables are stone with the CH beims and their wings pitched across one to the other now what is that the Ten Commandment was in the Ark of the Covenant right right see now get the point when that went into the temple it was still just Furniture yep you say but you're in bad shape no I'm not because the prophet is not referring to the Shak of Glory until after they reach their position he's not talking about back there where Moses was at those two tables of stone came in that still didn't bring the shot and Glory Hallelujah we can say say we believe the message but has the message been revealed yep see Moses constructed it got everything ready down through the building of dedication they came till they brought it to its resting place where it fit down into the sockets of the great huge place that had been set for it and when it fit down and finally came to its resting place the ark the Bible said that the Lord descended down upon the place after the word was in place he didn't call it the coming of the two stones coming into the building follow the prophet till it filled the entire Temple the pillar of fire came in there with such great glory of God till the ministers could not Minister anymore because of the glory of God that's when it found its final resting place listen the Shak of Glory that followed those capping Stone right not the corner the capping Stone the main that's right all other Stones was of none effect until then yep but this main Stone came into came in The Headstone and took his place position ly for its resting place for that generation the glory of God filled the building where they were sitting and there was sh kind of Glory upon the whole building and the glory was so great till the priest couldn't even Minister because of the glory that's right you said Brother D what are you looking for right that even after the head and body unites even after the adoption of the head and the body unites and you see manifested Sons and Daughters of God yep then this your kind of Glory will be able to have something to fall on or in other words bring us the message the head and body you not and bring a message what would be that message to it right to understand the Redemption of this body amen now what are you saying brother Dale I'm saying that just because you read the book doesn't mean you got it right amen because brother brandom I'll get to that Sunday and I will not say no more about it tonight I will say it now this way when brother brandom preached those seals if God had not come down and quickened that it would have been letters on a page that's right and that's exactly what it is right now to you and I right the Bible if letters on a page right this message if letters on a page right right if you ever noticed I'll say this cuz I'm said I wasn't going to say nothing but it will a little bit you notice you can read a book one time and you're not getting a whole lot out of it and you go back and read the same book and you get more out of it amen amen I'm going to say it and you ain't going to like it it's not necessarily that that's been revealed to you right you may be now I didn't say that I said not necessarily right I said could be cuz you just had your understanding open right right right yeah I have to end that there because I get the message and can't see we talk about adoption in three stages we talk about everything in three stages justification s case the baptism good adoption in three stages what the new birth the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God the hear ye him but see then there's more to it beside to hear your him what you want to manifest his sons here father now come on when I first come in this message you know what they taught us we don't need manifested Sons here we'll have them in the Millennium though I said what in the world do we need them in the Millennium for I didn't know brother brand made that statement but one day I found he made that statement he said we need them now y that's right I said why do you need them in the Millennium we need him right now right right that's right but I'm going to make another statement brother Steven I noticed he mentioned it he said brother Dale said that everybody in the world can have the faith of the fathers or something like that you know that won't bring to Rapture I know you're going to differ from this this but go ahead all the Bride of Jesus Christ could have the headstone United with her there's still got to be a message y right there's still got to be something to happen you're only at the stage of being able to understand that's correct amen now do you think brother Dale has died and dried up I am looking forward amen but I'm also Looking Backward to see what God has already done there's got to be a quickening power strike this church but it'll only be after the bride has the word completely sown down there's no need of bringing it until it's sown down that's why we've been here 40 years amen that's true and the sewing down of the word the planting of the word the fussing around horrible your arguments and the and the bickerings Y but it's time to go into the promised land what are you looking for brother Dale I'm looking for people to stand up and preach the gospel that God can vindicate y amen he told me that 40 something years ago he said you preach the word exactly and I'll vindicate it and back it up I thought Lord God I've been doing the best I could to preach it like it is but then one day it struck me right after that headstone unites with you is the only way you able to be able to understand the Redemption of the body right inside of that you're only talking about it you're only planting seed in the field right you're only getting your understanding opened once your understanding you said my understanding is open that means I got the new bird that's the new bir now the disciples had their understanding open before they got the new birth if they hadn't they would have know what the new birth was see I'm looking forward to something brother said there be a baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll come down and fill fiber of our being and take us in rure but you know what it didn't come there until the tables of stone they had plenty of room in there they had a beautiful wonderful place but all of it was machry all of it was what we call mechanics in the basis of that it was Furniture sitting there right and when that art took its place it there was more furniture but inside of that Ark now watch why did it say I'm asking you a question why did it say that the prophet was bringing it out so it must have said it in in the scripture that when that Ark reached its resting place then the Shan Glory came kind of Glory didn't come when it walked in the building kind of Glory didn't come until it got right up and set it in the place right where it's supposed to be and then when that was done here come the sh amen when the word that's all I've ever tried to do I never tried to do what one thing right and try to get you to see and open your understanding to God's word amen where God could come down and speak to your heart right and Quicken it unto you amen that's right there's plenty of things left for us to do and and going on cuz we got to go on to a change of the body right that's right amen you see everybody wants to think that quick as The Headstone comes it's all over with no when The Headstone comes to the body even as a group it's just now ready right it's just ready then for the Shak kind of Glory to Quicken all you have in your feeli anybody got any questions anybody got any questions I hope I've tried to make myself clear CU that's that's almost that's 40 something years of studying to see what this Prophet has said that's right oh but brother Dale I always thought that when that should kind of Glory that's right when it comes but it's got to have something to land on right that's right amen the Bible's right when it said when the day of Pentecost will fully come right yep yep there is a place in the time for all things or two all things excuse me Ecclesiastes says there's a time to understand to understand the Redemption of these bodies adoption is not covered as the change right that's what we think it is the third stage of adoption is to be the revelation of what it will take to change us right Amen to Wi yep the understand the Redemption of the body there's plenty to come that's why it doesn't bother me 40 more years what would that make me that' be 130 110 11 years old I believe I can make it I know I still have something to preach right matter you say no so we're getting older I was listening last night we was to brother brandom as he was talking and you better listen what he says because that's right what he says but you know we're getting older losing our memories and everything else but you know what he said he said if I had a choice whether it was first 25 2 25 3D 25 or the fourth one right he said the first one now I'm quoting him he said the first one would be all right if you running after women right that's you know you know if you been huncho muncho first 25 but he said the next 25 you start doing this the next 25 he said if I had my choice I'd want to be here from 75 to 100 right you say he never lived to be that old I'll agree with you but that's what he said cuz he said I'd be more mature right right he something happens you say well now what about alimer we ain't talking about all right we ain't talking about all hamers that's the devil's doings right we're talking about what God says can happen if he can take a 110 year old man and house eight I believe it is I think he had seven sons and daughters didn't he actually but I know it at least that and he he could do a lot with you and me right you say yeah but but 100 years old you're getting so you're sleeping I may be sleeping but the one that's inside of me I like what brother R said about the old black man when he was up there you know had that old long trench coat on the little Ring Of Hair run around he said my Lord why didn't they get some of them young guys to get up there and preach why they put that old man up there he said that old man read so the others was fooling around with what was on Earth said the old man read about how that it started for the foundation of the world and said he preached a while and said he jumped up H whoe said you ain't got enough room up here for me he said Lord I want some of that that's right I want some of that amen you see maturity comes with age you may not have enough sense to be able to explain it but it's still there see we deal with only the negative the prophet was looking at the positive that's right of the maturity of the individual absolutely to where they're settled can they come and talk to you and deprogram you and get you to believe a trinity yeah now come on if they can do that you know you're lost to start with amen that's right I mean people can turn you against this message brother over in Alabama just broke my heart amen he preached right here in this pull pit y pray for him brother Jeremy was gun that his last name what's his last name gun gun gun and him the big guy that come here and preach for from Alabama preached when brother uh he it was preaching but preached two Services he just walked away from the message said brother Brandon was wrong y it was all over the tent because he's trying to figure it out said brother Brandon was wrong said he said if he's ever wrong one time don't believe him oh my so of course he found one where he thought he's wrong right you say well brother Dale what about it we're all going that way if we're not genuine that's right right amen that's correct yes sir this is the age of manifestation right this is the age of making known y some guy run for president you ain't never heard his name don't even know the man exists and the next day the papers is full of his life story they know every where he was born that when he was birth and how many people was in the birthing room and who's fank him right you know what I'm saying and they nailed the man's ey with his life cuz this is the manifesting time that's right this is the time to make known that's right I ain't caring about making known who's going to be president and what's going to take place I just want to know to it I want to understand how this body can be redeemed yeah all you got to do is just get in Jesus Christ amen we preached that 40 years ago we preached that 2,000 years ago and all you had to do is get to Christ that's true but why hasn't it brought right the P right the rapture did the prophet say the quote I gave one go so when the bride realizes who she is and what in other words paraphrasing the quote what she here for that's right amen y we're here to strip Satan of one power that he still holds amen right now you say hold no God took it away from him but you don't want him say it he still has the ability to bring man to the Grave you agree that's right right so he still holds that ability to take us to the grave but we got to strip him of that that's right and we can't strip him of that running around and little sugar tit playing around things that's right and arguing and fussing over little things right and our little petty feel we've had 40 years to get rid of them 40 something years to get rid of them think on these things I'm going to say one more just I'm going to make sure you understand what I'm saying cuz see I believe you got to get the new birth and I believe the growth and de development brings us to the stature of perfect man and then The Headstone can Unite with the body or the individual amen all right and that's the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God verse 21 18 through 21 or something 22 with the world's waiting on that why is it waiting on it it's waiting on them to bring a message that's right that's what do you think these sons and daughters are to do in the last days to bring a message Amen brother R said and he even talked about I don't remember the man's name but said he takes the word and just stands there and said he preaches it so straight and hard he said until the devil can't do nothing with him that's what I want to do all right amen that's right the devil is driven out by the revealed word amen the only way he can be driven out amen right let's Stand Together come on that's right think on these things think on these things to Wi to understand the Redemption of the body when we understand that the Shak of Glory will fall upon that understanding that is brought into us that's right to Quicken it to us there is where in the temple was when those 10 commandments came in and found their stocket place that's right then the sh Glory fell that's right God was in his Temple you receive the new birth God is in in your temple that's right when you receive adoption of the hear your himy God is more in that Temple when you get the understanding of the Redemption of the body God is more in that Temple when it's all Quicken to us we're going to
