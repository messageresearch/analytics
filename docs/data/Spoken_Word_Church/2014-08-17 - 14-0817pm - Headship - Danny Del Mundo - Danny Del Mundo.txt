========================================

jesus said good to see everybody in the house of the lord glad to have our visitors with us we always say when you come here one time you're a visitor you come two times you're part of us because we don't have anything to join we don't have anything to do we're just part of the body of christ but you know you come back and be with us and fellowship with us you're just part of us because they're not something big but good to have you with us i'm glad to do it and we're going to go right on into the service so you can go ahead and be seated and a musician everybody can go down we'll turn it over to ryan and let him uh direct the part now to because he's got a little bit he's wanting to show you and talk about the miracle baby then we will have the baby dedication all right all right good afternoon everybody this may take a while get comfortable i'm gonna actually uh thank you i'm gonna set my stopwatch okay to stop me at a certain point because i don't want to go too long i'm glad to have my family here with me before i forget cake downstairs after service do not leave without eating some cake we don't want to take it home i'm so glad to have all my family if i could just take a moment to introduce them uh starting over here on the right my grandmother uh ginger bonnet beside her is my dad joel and my sister brooke and then me conor juan carlos rolica mentosa nicaragua and my two nieces and i and aleah and then uh let's see my mom back there behind my dad there and my grandma my other grandma marlene my mom is deborah sorry and then over here uncle bill where'd they go oh they moved uncle bill and aunt susan dover now let me tell y'all something that's important to me that i thought of when they walked in my grandma and my aunt suzanne are children of my great-grandmother eula who you all know my baby is named after they left eula and floyd night they left a legacy of godly christian love and that's part of the reason i'm standing here today is because the bible says it's one simple law in god's word that train up a child in the way he should go when he's old he'll not depart from it they train their children to pray and they pass it down to the next generation my dad and mom taught me to pray and my grandma prayed with me and my sister and read our bibles and she read her bible with us and that's she's part of this testimony if it weren't for that i wouldn't i don't know if i'd be here so um i wanted to give that to them now i'm trying to make sure i don't leave anything out um thank you all so much for your prayers about iva god did something tremendous i mean not just healing her but delivering me from fear and so many other things that i want you to see in this testimony and i hope it can be a help to somebody sorry that you didn't know all the circumstances most of you didn't know she was dying frankly i didn't want to think about it i didn't want to tell anybody i didn't want to confess it and like brother dale says you don't have to know the circumstances that somebody's facing to know how to pray just pray you don't pray hard if they're dying and pray soft if they got a cold just pray and brother gary atkins sister mary daugherty they're on my heart everybody's hearts i'm sure we keep lifting them up we don't know exactly what they're facing to every detail but we just pray now iva was born premature as most of you know she had underdeveloped lungs that was the initial diagnosis and she got worse and worse and worse over the first few days by the third day she was in critical condition on life support heavily medicated heavily sedated in a medically induced coma and under constant supervision from a nurse not one to two but i mean one to one ratio a nurse constantly watching just our baby that's how bad she was constantly working diligently to get her stable by the third day now by that time all through this trial scriptures kept coming to my remembrance because he said he'd make a way of escape in the trial and the word is the way of escape you always go back to the word when jesus was tempted he always went back to the word he said it is written it is written it is written and that's how we overcome now by the third day i was under a tremendous load of fear not the good kind of fear the reverent fear for god but the torment fear now the bible says fear hath torment and that scripture came to my remembrance and i told gabby you know gabby we've got to overcome this fear by this time i was crying okay because of the fear i was so scared for losing my baby now that was god speaking to me and i didn't know yet i thought it was just another good scripture to come for me and later that day we were at our dying baby's bedside and she by this time her skin was pale she was cold and clammy her fingers and toes were beginning to turn purple and blue her oxygen saturation at the lowest point that night got down to 37 percent it's supposed to be between 90 and 100 percent hers got down to 37 percent she was in terrible shape nonetheless there was a bible study here that night we left our dying baby's bedside against all rational thought i'm not saying this to brag i'm saying that that i stood because i saw something in the bible that having done all to stand we stand and to me standing is reading your bible praying going to church diligently living to serve god and believing so we left our dying baby's bedside that night or that afternoon and went to church cried all the way here cried all during this they're in the bible study and most of you know this part of the testimony because i testified a few weeks ago by the way it approached me after the service not presumptuously holding his head down ringing his hands you know ryan will keep praying for it maybe everything will be okay no he came to me and spoke boldly and said these words and simplicity he said he smiled and said don't worry stop worrying quit worrying like that about three times then he went on to say some other things and i accepted that okay that was the net result but he doesn't know this but when he spoke that to me a battle began to rage in my mind because that oppressive spirit of fear was beginning to it was confronted by faith perfect love cast without fear if you can read that on the scripture there perfect love which is faith casteth out fear that's how you overcome fear that confronted that fear and the fear began to be afraid itself because it was being loosed now watch i didn't know this until later on because weeks later after this it all passed i didn't realize what was going on but i pondered these things i kept these things in my heart like mary and i began to think on these things and god began to show me some of what was going on behind the veil of the flesh if you will that fear was confronted by faith the first thought that came to my mind brother wade was how dare you stand there and tell me not to worry when my baby's laying in bed dying i wasn't mad at him because he didn't know she was dying see but that was the first thought but what about my baby laying in the bed dying and you're just telling me something so simple just don't worry like jesus said fear not only believe don't doubt and i went to mark 4 38 later on that scripture came to my remembrance y'all can read it while i'm talking but just for sake of time the jesus and the disciples were in us in the sea in the boat at sea being tossed about by the winds and the waves and the disciples through a spirit of fear went to wake jesus because he was asleep there was no fear in that man he laid there sleeping and in the midst of the trial in the midst of the storm he laid there asleep not worrying one bit but the disciples through fear went to wake him and said carries thou not that we perish in other words don't you care about my baby laying there dying see the same spirit acting the same way pointing to the circumstances just the same way false evidence appearing real fear pointed me back to the circumstances and then for a moment i thought yeah my baby's dying but this is faith this gives me hope this gives me peace and joy so i'm going to take what brother wade gave me and you know jesus awoke and rebuked the winds and the waves and the winds and waves ceased and then he addressed the spirit of fear in the disciples he said unto them why are you fearful how is it that you have no faith okay so that same spirit of fear was doing the same thing in me i realized that only later now um that night we went home went to bed i felt so much more encouraged i wasn't i didn't cry anymore after that in the middle of the night the worst wasn't over yet okay that was the turning point but not not just yet okay that god gave me something he was in the middle of giving me something to overcome the greatest battle was just ahead in the middle of the night the doctor called and said ryan your baby's not getting any better she's she's getting worse and we're going to send her down to eggleston children's hospital in atlanta and the children's health care of atlanta where she can get some more advanced care so we went down there to meet the doctor in the middle of the night and while waiting to meet the doctor i pulled up my bible and began to read despite my baby dying despite her having to be moved in the middle of the night which shows she must been pretty bad and despite being a one-hour sleep i just pulled out my bible began to read as i did the day before that and the day before that the day before that i refused to stop my daily bible reading and you know what the very chapter that contained that very verse is the one that i read in my daily bible reading now i go one chapter day out of the new testament two out of the old testament and just to show you how unlikely this is i look this up on google there's 260 chapters in the new testament so it's a one in 260 chance that this would happen that i would read that very verse now god was speaking to me and i began to realize that the bible says three as a witness the previous day fear hath torment came to my remembrance just out of the blue then that night brother wade spoke to me don't fear don't worry and then in the middle of the night in my bible reading waiting to hear the verdict from the doctor about my baby there came that scripture again and i turned to gabby and said gabby look at this i said god is speaking to us god is showing us do not worry no matter what do not fear now this is beautiful let me show you the next slide please psalm 23 later again i realized we were walking right down the middle of psalm 23. yea though i walked through the valley of the shadow of death gabby and i collectively don't cry gambian it's going to make me cry yeah i mean i collectively and individually we're in the worst trial of our lives the deepest valley yet and my baby was shadowed to death yet i will fear no evil that was david's proclamation or declaration and that was my mandate god told me don't fear what would be evil my baby dying it put her in the presence of god it'd be wonderful for her but for me it'd be terrible i'd never know what she'd become this side of eternity i'd never know what color i should have what color hair she'd have everybody agree with me that'd be pretty evil i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and my staff they come for me now he was an ever-present help just as he always is and bringing the word from my memories give me scriptures to overcome and to comfort and everything and my favorite part i never understood what this meant thou prepares the table before me in the midst of mine enemies what were david's enemies here fear and death what were our enemies fear and death our baby was dying we were afraid fear and death the last enemy to be defeated is death the bible says fear and death were our enemies okay now god didn't wait till they were at bay somewhere off bothering somebody else and sneak in and slide us a little manna under the table so to speak god's not afraid of fear and he's not afraid of death right he walks in waltzes in right in the middle of fear and death right in the presence of our enemies and opened the table before me and gave me exactly what i needed to overcome this very trial at this very moment they opened the table before me and on that table was not a seven course meal it was one little morsel of bread he was saying here son you're going to need this for the battle that lays just ahead right because he knew what that doctor was going to tell us when she walked into the room and that morsel of bread was this that fear had torment and no matter what the outcome of your trial you will never be benefited by fear so cast it down it's a disease it's a spiritual disease that only dr jesus can diagnose you with okay like depression which i've also overcome years ago now he waltzes into the room and gave me that little morsel of bread and no sooner than i had read that scripture and understood what was going on that the doctor walked into the room and she sat down and this was a real surreal moment she looked me in the eye and i wished at this point that i could be just a bystander watching her talk to somebody else about their baby but she looked me in the eye and was talking to me about my baby and said your baby is dying and we have a treatment here we can give her called ecmo which is a lung bypass machine we'll take and cut her jugular vein send this tube down her jugular vein into her heart to draw the blood out and circulate it through a machine and put oxygen in it because the lungs were not doing that and put it back into her jugular vein and thus get oxygenated blood to her body because if we don't do that soon she said she'll start having brain damage and before too long she's going to die her body's going to start shutting down and there'll be no hope for her lungs then but this would give her time her lungs time to heal so she said uh and we'll leave her on that machine for up to two weeks and if she's not even better we'll take her off and let her go because she's not gonna make it if she hasn't made it in two weeks gabby was bawling by this time and i was trembling like i've never shaken before under that load of fear it was like a lion roaring in my face because satan is a roaring lion roamer to and fro and seeketh whom he may devour and that fear was just roaring at me and yet this little still small voice be not afraid don't doubt it is not be not afraid that little still small voice kept speaking kept echoing through my mind and so the doctor said uh we're gonna hold off a little bit because she's stable right now so we walked out of there and went to be at our bedside at her bedside and watched her for about four hours we sat there from 2 30 to 6 30 sunday morning and they still hadn't done the ecmo so we left we told them we'll see y'all this afternoon we're going to church it was sunday morning so we came here and i testified about that very thing that if anytime you're in a trial at the end of the trial you will never look back and be glad for the worry and say boy i'm glad i worried i'm glad i feared because that's what got me through that's when i realized that see and that's what i testified about and then i only made one confession about ibis i still didn't know if she was going to make it but i knew i had to overcome the fear either way so i simply confessed i said y'all pray for ava she's she's fine just keep praying for her and at that moment as far as i knew she might have already been dead or dying or already on the ecmo machine well we left church and headed back down there that day and called the nurse on the way down and i said is she on ecmo yet is she on the long bypass yet and the nurse said no she's she's actually getting better and from that hour she began to man she got better and better and better every day she stayed there all together for 30 days in the nicu okay getting better each day now here's the wonderful part about all this this is something that nobody knows but me and god i haven't even told gabby this because i wanted to give god all the praise before all you at one time and if after i say this if you're not praising god i'm going to step outside and look at the rocks on the church to see if they're actually praising god okay because this is wonderful i shouted over this in the chicken truck now there were four nurses the first four nurses that i've had at eggleston were named kathy katie kate and caitlin because i mean i called called them every day if we weren't there to ask them okay that's how i remember kathy katie kate and katelyn pretty much different variations of all the same name right so i said hmm something significant here i didn't know what i texted it out to several people brooke texted me back said that name means pure p-u-r-e and i thought that's neat sounds pretty two days later it finally struck me what that means look up pure it means untainted it means free from disease free from ill see god he works through nurses he works through doctors he works through medicine but god is the healer god was beginning to purify our baby from the severe lung disease beginning to draw it out of her because that was her diagnosis by this time was severe lung disease he was cleansing her and why four because three is a witness three would have got our attention but there were four of them don't get ahead of me now he's already got me figured out i'm sure four is god's number of deliverance in the bible the children of israel were 400 years in the land of egypt in bondage when they were delivered lazarus was four days in the grave when jesus resurrected him and delivered him from death and the children of israel i'm sorry let's see the hebrew children there you go he mentioned this one the three hebrew children in the fiery furnace uh and the fourth man seen in that fire was their deliverer okay four is god's number of deliverance through four nurses whose name means pure which is a four letter word god was beginning to purify her baby and cleanse her from the sickness and watch this she was born she was delivered from the womb if you will at four minutes till midnight and by the way a side note that was the best delivery best that gabby's done so far everything went so smoothly i believe the other midwives were anointed but this time more than ever because i stand there praying you know i have to believe it and four minutes till midnight is when she was born she went into the nicu just a couple hours later and all day saturday all day sunday excuse me all day thursday friday and saturday she got worse worse and worse and saturday night she was at the point of death but on the fourth day which was sunday the resurrection day of the day we honor and celebrate the resurrection god began to raise her and heal her from that sickness and i'm not done she's our fourth child and you know god delivered me from fear on her fourth child and she has a four letter name i have her middle name is a four letter name june now watch this what was the next thing i didn't write any of this down i just practiced it a lot four and four okay and uh my now plum forgot it it'll come to me four and four all the four is in her name now watch she is her name means uh god is gracious did i say that at the start of it i don't remember god is gracious is what ava's name means it's a hebrew name god is gracious and all through this trial god was gracious not only to deliver me but gracious to deliver her from the sickness god's grace was manifested over and over and over and um and those just so many other things just one thing after another i'm trying to jog my memory because there was four i know there was another four in there uh but god was gracious and let it be said of iva from this day forward whenever you think of iva remember that god is gracious to to deliver god's grace is sufficient to deliver okay and um if i remember that other thing i'll just have to come back up and say it later oh yeah here it is oh it's a big one hang on this is a big one see any time god gives you something the devil makes you doubt it so immediately after this the dog's making me down and i said okay big boy we'll see you come the next trial we'll find out if i got delivered from fear or not the next trial came a couple weeks later as last sunday morning brother quinn was preaching eula laid there on her back asleep and gabby and the girls were in the bathroom and uh the devil thought this pretty good opportunity to sneak in and cause some mischief caused some trouble i was holding either my hands were tied okay and eula was laying there on her back asleep and her arms began to flail like this about once every second with her heartbeat you know and she was asleep now i thought maybe it's just a nightmare but it'll just go away but no she kept doing it and then i noticed she's not breathing so i went up to raise her up she was just as limp as could be not breathing she opened her eyes and her eyelids okay and her eyes were rolled back in her head she was having a febrile seizure her seizure had spiked it was up to 103.5 and she was not breathing now i just all i did i handed off the baby to terrence and and took eula picked her up and carried her out and said lord bless my baby and no sooner than i did that that she coughed all that out and she began to breathe and it was in just within moments the brother aaron and a whole host of other people and our two of our church staff nurses were out there assessing her people are surrounding us with prayer and praise and it wasn't too long after that she came out of that and she's perfectly normal and well right now but here's the thing i didn't fear i just simply went and picked her up and acted i just prayed and carried her out and said lord if you take my baby she's yours the lord giveth the lord blessed us the way the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord no worry i just walked out and just believed god delivered me from fear now uh the sisters if you will come there's one last thing i want to do uh the sisters are going to sing the song i need sister esther and brother

miller's been working god isn't he's still miracle worker amen let's stand together we're going to have the baby dedication so you want to go ahead and bring up the little one and we always do here come up with the parents the grandparents and great grandparents the whole family and uncles is any ants come on with it bring the whole fantasy she's wanting you back here let's just sing bring them in while they're getting everything ready okay bring them bring the little ones to jesus bring them in bring them in bring the little ones together jesus bring them in bring them here amen and amen amen that's what we do we bring the little ones to jesus you know a lot of churches they do different things but remember in the scripture they brought the little children that's right to jesus and he blessed them right it's not a thing that we call it a baptism or anything it's just the basis that we bring them to the lord we hand them into the hands of the lord and ask the lord to take care of him that's right he's been gracious to have done all so far so we know he'll finish the day but how do we also do we also do one thing the family standing see when we come to a baby dedication it's a little bit different i guess than most people and like i said it's not an infant doing things it's not a saying or saved or anything it's just we've come to dedicate them to the lord give them into the hands of the lord and then you know what they would take them to jesus he'd bless them he'd give them right back to them because you know who raised the children jesus didn't raise the children it was the people the ones around that raised right and we always say even to the church that everybody in this church today is a people that are dedicated to one thing for you to live a life that this child would have an opportunity to be able to see jesus christ that's the point of all of it the whole thing is the dedicating right but the dedicating of the people that are a witness to all of it that's right that now we're to live before this child to where the child could have an opportunity of seeing jesus christ that's all we try to do and that's what we try to bring them to the to the lord everybody father we bring little iva jim to you lord family brother dedicated to you it's not me standing here in the basis of anything it's just what we're planning to do if you was here you would take the child and you hold it up and you just bless it then you give back to the family for them to live god take care of it you raise the child for your honor we thank you father that we've had this opportunity to be a part of this be a part of seeing the family standing here but they realize that a miracle yes has transpired in all of their life that they can see that you brought a baby even the doctor said he couldn't live because you dropped it to the basis that now it's in your hands we just commit little obviously we believe we thank you in jesus name now lord we give her back to the man for them to raise yes we love you and we thank a little you a little bundle of joy think of all of the the little ones and we've dedicated all of these little ones each one's had their opportunity to be dedicated amen what do you mean when you were praying for her and i was taking the picture and you said the word near her she raised her hand she is a miracle and we believe it amen appreciate the family coming to be with us and all right and just you know enjoy the message this morning my brother brought them to us an opportunity to say that uh a lot of you have said you wanted to give you'd give some checks and we ran out of cash to give him in the basis of cash that was in the funds it was here so if you want to write checks write your checks out to the church here and we just transfer it right over to him instead of you having to write out so many checks for him to try to take back with him so if you want to give something just write a check and just write on it what it's for put down at the bottom you know for danny del mundo and a missionary we appreciate our brother he gave us a good testimony this morning of of what they had done and i've been there and and able to witness some of the things that they have done and you know the the doings in in the philippines and the work of the lord that is going on there and the lord has really blessed them and taken care of them you know so let's just sing open the eyes of my heart as our brother comes to minister unto us this afternoon now the children has been moved over to next week okay the children the singing of the children will be next weekend also when i remember the lord willing brother uh samson shetty from india will be here with us wednesday preaching and then we will have brother samuel prakash kota which will be with us next sunday and he is from india so come and be with us and just not then you pray for all of these okay open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see i want to see glory glory glory amen hanging in the light of your glory holy holy lord amen hallelujah the bible said no one had seen god but the same bible says blessed are they that are pure in heart for they shall see god amen that's the only way we can see god by having the pure heart right amen and he is the one that purifies it amen by his word and so we're just going to take this opportunity while we still have the presence of the lord in our midst we go straight to the reading of the scripture amen so we're not going to go long so that great that great testimony will continue to linger amen in our hearts amen proving that god is still alive in our midst it remains to be you know uh he's still doing things to prove that he is alive amen so since we talk about david this morning we just want to move on let's read from first chronicles chapter 12 amen so we're talking about war amen but you know war is one way of satan to cast fear amen but that's the same thing you know that uh the best amen comes out amen amen so in first chronicles 12 38 it says all these men of war so you're going to find out in that chapter where we see all the warriors from different battlefields you know they came to one place amen they came all together uh with all their ranks amen for one purpose right and he said all these men of war men of war that could keep rank came with a perfect heart to hebron to make david king of the overall israel and all the rest also of israel were of one heart to make david king amen what a what a situation what what what a a condition on this uh natural side amen where people have one heart they are in one place and they have one king amen amen this is bar heads in prayer dear heavenly father once again we approach your throne of mercy to appeal and plead once again for you to speak your word that will lift up our faith and uh lord we claim and we will continue to believe that you remain alive in our midst so all these things lord that we continue to experience are nothing but proofs lord that you love us and you care for us we thank you in jesus christ's name amen hallelujah god bless you amen you may be seated so my title is short so that means this message is short amen so this is only one word amen it's about headship amen amen so when we talk about headship we believe that there is only one head and that's christ and he has a uh he has a pattern uh as we read again in another scripture in ephesians 5 23 he said for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body amen so i believe that that makes him that makes him head of the body because his sacrifice even he redeemed the body and that makes the body submissive to the head because she recognized her position amen so there's no way for there's no way for when we go back to the garden of eden there's there was no way for eve to get back amen because that uh that relationship that contact with the serpent you know put a separating line right between the woman and the man and uh we see that uh after the fall that was the time when the woman had her name he was she was named eve right after the fall prior to the fall amen she was called woman amen so i believe that's the same thing today when all churches have their own names that's after the fall amen but prior to all these denominations and religious group and uh you see it was only called church amen and that's the church of the living god and and if you call church of the living god there's no separation in it you cannot divide the body of the lord jesus christ amen but all these you know thousands of denominations have put so much lines you know that that we have come to a point today that when you ask a person are you a christian they will answer i'm a baptist you know you ask a person a christian are you a christian amen well i'm a catholic amen and and that puts you know a a separating line amen because of the name amen be and and its name uh uh uh is being followed by uh by by by divisive doctrines and theologies and creams amen but god has only one head all right and he only has one body and uh so that's the same thing that's why even in the homes he established the hardship of the husband it says he poor the husband in the head is the head of the wife and nobody can change that it is god's program and the same thing and the same thing we we don't allow not because we don't want it but the bible says amen a woman cannot be a head of a church amen she cannot stand behind the pulpit thieves and something it's not allowed by the bible because you see it it it speaks also of the headship amen because the pastor is the head of the church the local congregation nobody can nobody can change that and god hates a perverted relationship amen so you see christ is the head he's the bridegroom the church is the bride the wife amen so the wife amen uh uh she has a husband so the relationship is husband and wife it is man and woman it's male and female see but you see well uh people allow this thing but when you see when somebody a woman standing here amen being the head of the church so then you you have a spiritual perverted relationship because you turn a woman with woman amen so that's that's not the right relationship that's not the right uh uh uh uh program of god okay so we talk about headship amen so uh uh being the head that's why with the testimony that we uh that we hear and the lot of various things you know he being the head always proves amen himself that he is the savior of the body he's the redeemer of the body he's the provider of the body just like the father must be the provider amen just like the pastor who provides and feed his flock amen and by the way it's not his plaque but it is god's flaw amen so that's why that was the instruction given by jesus christ himself amen to peter amen do you love me then feed my flock amen you know feed my lambs so you see it's it's uh the man must always be the provider amen so i'm not i'm not against women uh working if that's needed you know and uh but but it remains that the handshake must come you know from the lord jesus christ the same thing with the household which is the uh uh but but just just uh for us to have some kind of a springboard here but let me uh again allow me to to to read a statement from the message proving his word you see in paragraph 211 let me read this it says here he was in defeat in luther in the thighs in wesley in the shoulders in pentecost right see what i mean he is the head you have a part that joins that together this hour that we're living now not the feet part not the thai part not the shoulder part but the neck part right amen so we are we are in that position so uh if we understand you know some submit to these people some uh uh protestant people they they tend to misunderstood that that we disagree with them but somehow there are some points amen because there's truth in them amen for some time right okay but if we recognize amen in luther's time he was in the feet part which was the foundation of reformation amen so and i believe that was that was actually the start of restoration okay so they were reformers then amen so god was not finished in the time of luther uh so it moved on the light moved on amen in the thighs in wesley so he's coming up and then and this is building up the body of jesus christ and then in wesley in the shoulders in pentacles where the gibbs amen were being restored amen people started to see vision recognizing the the gifts amen but but the gift was we're only representation of the giver amen but praise god we come to a point that those gifts only represent the giver amen but we know that at this point in time amen it's not the the blessings that we seek only but the blesser himself it's not the gifts only but it's the giver himself amen so but to receive that there must come to a point amen and we see the stature of a perfect man here amen that we're it looks like we're go going into the ladders taping you know from faith virtue knowledge amen temperance patience brotherly kindness godliness brotherly kindness so all these things must be built up together amen and and brings the new birth amen and and and so you see amen we're no longer in the shoulder part not the thai part not the shoulder part but the neck part amen right there and there's a connection amen so uh we cannot connect you know we cannot connect the head in the thigh it doesn't look good amen we cannot connect the head to the feet it doesn't look good amen it must be connected to the neck and that is the hour that we are living in right amen so we have come to a point that the the the messenger of god have come to tie uh uh the loose ends amen so amen we have come to that point so all these things today that's why we see in this first chronicles we see that all these men of war they are not ordinary men they were men they were leaders they were they were warriors and if we go up and read you know we can see uh things maybe uh we can read few parts here in verse 31 it says and of the half of tribe of manasseh 18 000 which were expressed by name to come and make david king and of the children of issachar which were men that had understanding of the times so now you come to a point of various gifts in the body amen so you have people here they were menopause they're good you know they're good in instruments they were good in uh uh in in weapons amen and then you have come to this point the people children of isakar which were men that had understanding of the times maybe you can they can look up and see those stars are being lined up and they they can interpret they can see what what what will come to pass what will take place and they can locate where they are because they can understand amen so there are gifts in the body like that to know what israelis ought to do the heads of them were 200 and all their brethren were of their commandment of zebulun such as went forth to battle expert in war amen so uh these are different group of people amen uh they're men and they're not just uh uh war people they were experts with all instruments of war fifty thousand which could keep rank they were not of double heart of zebulun such as wentworth to battle i'm sorry thirty-four and of napoli a thousand captains and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand and of the dynamics expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred and of us such as went for to battle expert in war forty thousand and on the other side of jordan of the rubinites and the gaddites and half of tribe of manasseh with all manner of instruments of war for the battle a hundred and twenty thousand all these men aboard amen all these men of war that could keep rank came with a perfect heart to web run to make david king over all israel and all the rest also of israel were of one heart to make david king right i believe amen if we you know try just trying to imagine trying to imagine i mean that all the people that were of one heart and their intention was only to live king david that was the natural king and in if that natural thing amen happened here on earth amen i believe with the w with the leadership of the holy spirit that only if all the people should have one heart one motive one desire amen and that is to make jesus christ king of all kings amen not to make somebody bigger than the other right not to build a kingdom that is more powerful than the other kingdom amen not to make known just like what job did and we read this morning and then he had the opportunity to make a name for himself but he did not took that opportunity he did not take and and credit for himself amen but he wanted king david to be present and to take the crown of the other king amen so that's the same thing today the body of the lord jesus christ must come to this same point amen to bring up christ and the bible said and i if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw all men unto me hallelujah so this is our intention this is our desire hallelujah now let me just read another scripture in matthew chapter 8 if you would follow me and if we can put it in the bimmer in matthew 8 18 to 20 20 20 18 now when jesus saw great multitudes about him he gave commandment to depart and to the other side and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will follow thee with whosoever thou goest and jesus said unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man had not where to lay his head amen now we you know most of the time he myself i use this scripture to show how jesus during his time during his ministry suffered a lot talking about poverty he did he did suffering amen going to the mission barrowing horse even borrowing both just to be on the other side amen uh reaching out poor people amen presenting them the kingdom of god talking about the poverty amen he did suffer all these things but if we look at this scripture i see more than natural things on this because in verse 18 now when jesus saw great multitudes about him he gave commandment to depart on the other side and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will follow thee so this scribe was looking for a leader that he had to follow somebody that could lead him amen and in verse 20 jesus said unto him the faxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man had no where to lay he said and if we continue on down low if you would allow me we can see the scripture that there was a man who wanted to follow jesus but but he he had something to do because he had to bury somebody amen so i believe this is more than just poverty but this is hardship when jesus said foxes have holes and the birds of their and the birds of the air have nest but the son of man had not where to lay his head because birds you know when they get tired they go back to where they will lay they had nest faxes they had holes to rest amen but notice that jesus he came to his own and his own received him not right he came to the time when people were religious and those scriptures there the most holy city supposedly they supposedly the most holy people people of god crucified four words also there they crucified him the most shameful death was given to him the king of glory amen glory amen why because he was the rejected king right right he was supposed to be the head of all religion but the most religious people amen at that time when he came 2 000 years ago amen he was supposed to be the head amen but the son of man had nowhere to lay his head right amen amen so but praise god amen after 2 000 years after two thousand years since then and then he looked for the bride right amen and every time we're going to see that you know joseph types the lord jesus christ joseph had the gentile bride amen moses had the gentile bride amen so the same thing jesus christ look for a gentile bride amen because he came to his own and his own received them not and what a blessing what an amazing grace amen that we as a people that were like dogs in those days amen what a privileged people we are now amen simply because we accepted him to be the head amen of our generation we accepted him to be a man of the headship of the body and we are part of that body hallelujah so two thousand years ago jesus had said pastor but the sun had no nothing to lay his head on amen but today jesus could say amen foxes and balls birds of nests and also amen and also the son of man has a neck amen because eliza has found rebecca for isaac amen thank you lord and if we see amen the beauty of all these things we see how god has extended his grace to be able to reach us there's no amount of words on our side you know to be able to explain god's grace there is not much space in my mind in my brains even in my heart to comprehend how the grace of god had worked in me amen amen he's been so gracious and with that kind of experience where when when there seems to be time where we can say it's hopeless and and and everything seemed to be uh out of range amen but when we cannot hold on to something anymore then we find out god is there amen we can do everything amen but it has a limitation but somehow when we get to a point that that's the end of the line and then we cast everything into his hand hallelujah then god will be working right amen when when when when when we are trying to lead ourselves head ourselves that you know as if we're saying lord i can do something amen but the only thing that we can do all things is only through christ amen so we have many uh many experiences amen we have many things uh that have happened simply because we recognize him being the head of our lives hallelujah so i believe it's not only me amen it's not only one in in this means that since we take jesus christ being the head of our lives everything have changed everything has everything you know it's never been the same again i could relate with with our precious brother this morning we were confronted with that kind of uh uh situation before uh just a little testimony just to keep the flow how god you know how god really worked even in the times when we really cast everything upon him amen you know i was i was also given a sickly child my uh my elder uh my eldest son i believe i have testified something on this previously but it just uh get back on my mind you know about the goodness of the lord she was he was also found with a congenital heart disease when he was three months old and he needed to undergo major surgery and not only certain single surgery it must be two surgeries i mean they had to cut his side you know to put a artificial vein because as he was growing the vein was not growing and the uh oxygen uh supplied by by through the blood is not enough for his uh pc uh body demand you know and uh uh and in the philippines you know when you talk about surgery it you know it's beyond rich amen of your financial capacity and at that time i was i was working as a public school teacher and then just to cut the story short you know so so three months old and uh uh for three years you know my my my uh our baby you know he will turn black because he was a blue baby you know his uh nails are violet his lips violet his eyes are red you know you see and from time to time he just collapsed you know but the lord really delivered him you know because uh the doctors could not believe you know how he was able to to survive three years without having a stroke with those uh numbers a number of of uh uh collapse you know but when he was three years old uh he he was in the surgery he had the surgery and and then after which the doctor said you know we're not sure if he can make it here because his body is so weak and he he if he makes it then we will be expecting another surgery for another year and uh so uh but by that time you know we also had a baby girl and this baby girl was so healthy very beautiful amen but suddenly because we were watching our baby boy uh our baby girl who was nine months old and got sick and in just a matter of two weeks you know uh the lord took her and just before that you know i i was because i i was really at the brink of the ministry and at that time uh i was having some promotion in my in my job i was promoted as a master master teacher in the school and there's a possibility to being promoted to a higher position i was intending to to be in that position also and i never had any intention in making it to the ministry and my wife didn't want it also because my wife uh she's a daughter of i'm sorry she's the daughter of one of the pioneer ministers in the message in the philippines and she said i'm against for you to be a minister because you know i grew up as a as a child of a minister and it's not easy all eyes are looking at you you know you have to you have to everything you do must be good must be right you must be friendly to everybody you know and i saw you know i saw my mother you know and i don't want to be a minister's wife amen and so we agreed amen but during those days this is what what we were telling you just like when david when he was out of the position when he was supposed to be doing something amen to fulfill his commission to fulfill his position amen just like jonah we see a lot of things that you you you cannot get by with it you get con you suffer the consequence and the people that are close to you are being affected also amen and and you know it was so sad and and and when when when our baby was just right there in icu and i was raising my hand i was in in desperation and i said lord please don't take our baby girl because she she might she will be the one to take care of her you know brother when they you see but god is absolute you know so it looks like our requests were not granted amen but even then now we were left with a child that is sick and and had to undergo two major surgeries amen but then we come to a point that god put us in the corner that we had nothing to do but to raise our hand you know god can just let you go as far amen god can just let you go as far but when when his time comes amen he's going to pull you amen and just do and you'll just going to you you'll be in one corner and just going to say lord i'm here and so by that time you were just right there and and my wife and myself we held hands together and we just pray amen perhaps we have to do something amen god has been dealing with us i knew that call is there but we're just running with it because of our you know our reasons amen but somehow probably the lord is talking to us and if we agree no matter what we're going to serve him i'm willing to serve and preach this gospel preach this message no matter what and so when i handed my my my child to to the surgeon and i said lord i'm giving my child to you amen it's up to you lord but let me tell you something lord whatever happens i'm going to serve you glory brothers let me tell you this the doctor said amen he will have a poor memory and he had to undergo neck surgery the following year but it took us three years and the doctor were mad at us you know you don't love your uh baby boy you know you don't want him to have this second surgery which is needed we want to do it amen but it's just that we cannot have anything to pay you know but you see you know but god we know god is in control glory amen and we believe god you know if this boy you gave this boy to us and then you're going to do something you're going to save him you're going to spare him remember you're going he needed to be uh to to undergo that next surgery which which they call the total correction then he will be there and you will provide and it took us three years and the doctor said you know it must be in this first year the following year and second year it will it will not be possible for him you know he might have you know stroke or something get worse and it's not possible for him to stay three years amen but to their surprise because they were thinking how come because that uh that little artificial vein that they put in would not reach three years for him to survive to provide him enough oxygen amen but you know what happened because of the prayers of the saints amen we prayed and we committed to the lord amen and and and the people were praying and then when they when they tried to to look at their uh at his uh heart amen you know they they compared they compared their first uh uh uh you know x-ray or something to the latest x-ray and you know what they found out they found out that there is uh that there is a natural vein that grew you know god knows how to do it amen god knows how to do it and and by that you know we were comforted by god simply because amen we accepted him as the head amen and he is going he knows he knows best he knows better than we think amen and so by then and today my son is 23 years old amen and i'm pushing and i'm pushing him and i'm pushing him come on get away for you you need to have a family and give me grandchildren and you know the the uh my boy said you know he will have a poor memory but he is an id and he's good in coding amen he do websites and he do programs softwares and everything amen you cannot outdo god amen and so all these things and now i cannot i cannot i cannot complain i cannot question god and the only thing that that i can do is that lord god you put me here you are my head amen it's up to you whatever right hallelujah right and so these things amen you know we're not being bothered because we are we are in our rightful position amen because he is the head he knows right amen and this head one time in john chapter 27 it's not in the uh but i know you know the scripture when he said you know nobody can pluck us out of his hands amen so when we are in our right pool position he being the head and he is the one taking full control of us nobody can take us out of his hand amen and the only way the only way we can we can be in his hand you remember you know he is the same that is walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks amen and in the midst of those seven gandalf sticks in the book of revelation amen he was right he was in in his hand he had in his hands seven stars amen and in the seven stars i see myself being identified without with one of those stars and as long as as i stay amen with the message of that star which is in his right hand nobody can take me out of his hand hallelujah so there are seven stars through the ages even through the ages and then he kept watching his bride he kept watching and he's watching us he was watching me right at the perfect time where i am going to come in hallelujah you know even even in the parables we see in the parable of that good samaritan we see how in the back of god's mind if we look back in that in that parable we see amen that that you know there are many uh many preaching sermons today that we they can only see that good samaritan as far as a good man in the neighborhood that if you help your neighbor you're a good samaritan well there's nothing against that which is true because that's the only the spirit of the samaritan in you amen but if we're going to look at it amen by message point of view we see amen we see amen that that man that was being robbed in jericho is not a man naturally born in jericho right right that man in jericho he came from jerusalem down to jericho amen so that means he had an origin he came down from jerusalem to jericho amen and this good samaritan came where he was so that means he came where he was so this man in jericho is a citizen of jerusalem and this good samaritan that came from jerusalem also and notice that these two religious people the levite and the priest amen they just came around by chance amen it's by chance they see this man in jericho but this good samaritan it's not by chance the bible said amen as he journeyed right that means he's so definitely specific in his thought at the back of his head he knew this good samaritan of mine he knew why he was going down to jericho because he's going to pick up that man in jericho because he does not belong to jericho he is a citizen of jerusalem amen so he is in the mind of god so i see myself in this condition we were in the mind of god amen we were we were in that in god's mind we were attributes then i mean because we were in the head we were in the back of god's mind amen god is always responsible god is always responsible for us that's why the same thing as he was walking in that you know he when he was walking that uh uh seven golden candlesticks in throughout his his throughout history amen he is responsible that's why in this good samaritan you know when he pick up that man and then he poured in oil and wine amen which is the stimulation of revelation amen and the next thing which i like the portion that i like there and then when he when he picked up that man and he laid him in his own beast hallelujah he laid him in his own best and throughout all the ages we messaged believers amen in the first four seals we see in every seal that is being opened amen there is a a a a horse that is coming out amen the white amen the red the black and in the late the the last one was the pale horse but every time there is a beast also that god has sent forth amen from from that amen those those throne guards amen in heaven were being released and then here on earth to bring up to bring inspiration and to anoint his people amen and those are the beasts amen so the first beast was the lion so in the first part you know this good samaritan place us in his own beast amen that's why the the believers in those days they were like lions amen they were so brave and courageous enough amen and they they test whether uh uh everything comes from god amen and then later on they suffered because the the the beast was the ox and they had to bury the burden amen they have to receive all these persecutions amen they could still worship god and raise their hand while they were being killed being martyred amen they can still raise their hand and while the the sisters amen with their with their long hairs being being dipped into the into the oil and then being burned in the middle of the night and while the men were hanging on those big trees being burned also by those persecutors in those days and historians could not believe how these people could stand all those kinds of persecutions and sufferings and giving their lives historians could not believe how god being worshiped and being promoted by these people could just keep himself watching them amen but somehow these people could stand all those kinds of sufferings and conditions because they were anointed to do so because the samaritan has placed them in his own beast and then came the the man anointing and then today he has sent us the flying eagle anointing amen and so we had to ride in this beast as we always say and that's the power amen that's the eagle anointing that we enjoy but remember amen as rebecca when she was being found by a loser the same beast amen that she gave water to drink was the same beast that brought her to isaac hallelujah so i believe we should be sensitive enough amen we are and i believe we are even sensitive enough and that's the reason you know there's no way i mean whether it's far whether it's me whether it's hard whether it's raining whether we're in a hard time we're sick or somewhere amen the eagle will always fly and look for that eagle food amen to feed amen that kind of anointing that is being given to us amen so he said now in in in the message jehovah jireh he said how that rebecca water that came in the cool of the evening eliza didn't find her in the morning he never found her at noontime he found her in the evening light it shall be light in the evening time right that's where he found her she veiled her face so she had no head amen she covered amen that's why even the wedding you know the women covered their head amen she was going to her head right a woman it's her nature of a woman to surrender to a man again a woman eats her nature to surrender to a man so if you see a woman that's not surrendering to a man it's not her nature you know that he she is not in her nature amen because the nature of a woman is to surrender to a man and it's the nature of the church to surrender to christ surrender to his will just surrender she has no thinking of her own she takes his word not somebody else's if eb would have done that we'd have never had to die but she listened to reasonings but the real bride of christ takes the headship of christ the word right and only believes god's word that's the real the restored bride hallelujah it's nearly time francis later than you think we're at the evening time the holy spirit is here amen and another message the spoken word is the original seed is that they will love him love his and will have his potentials for he is their head amen and they are his subjects subject to his head headship of christ was his notice what harmony jesus never did anything until sin of the father or the father showed him purse harmony between god and christ see john 5 19 so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret the word is in the bride in the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the lord and it is germanized so the holy spirit waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose amen so only when we find ourselves amen in our rightful position then we can be serving god's purpose amen and god will bless us hallelujah somehow during the time you know again i remember that story of that uh uh you know i people you can look back at samson where you know he found that uh that job on amen you know no one would think that rottening joburn would be would be abuse right but during the time when samsung needing something to hold on that jawbone was just right there it was right at the right place at the right time and then it serve its purpose it was useless but when it was in the hand of samson amen that's why when i read i was surprised because if we read judges chapter 15 we're going to see in verse 15 and he found a new jew bone of an ass and put port his hand and took it and slew a thousand men there with amen how could that rottening jawbone be a new job on there amen but somehow it became a new job because now it will serve its purpose because it is in the right hand hallelujah so we can we can do something we can accomplish something for our own but as long as the right hand of god is holding us amen we cannot be amen serving our own purpose according to god's will so that new that job on became new because he was in the hand of samson which is the hand of god right at that very moment hallelujah so that's why when we when we submit ourselves we fully surrender ourselves to the lord amen what's the bible said behold all things are become new amen we become new creation in christ amen because we we we just humble ourselves and we just give ourselves this remains to be a neck amen and there is a connection there and whatever the head says the body will follow amen that's why the heart is placed here right yeah and the heart is placed in its rightful position amen and so i like what other preachers say you know sometimes there are people that will you know in their natural head they will miss the rapture by just merely a single foot amen right because they had it in their natural head but it didn't fall in their heart amen so it must be in this heart amen to get connected with to the right head which is jesus christ amen so you see amen how when when when when we recognize the headship of christ only then we can accomplish something for his own glory only then we can lift the name of the lord jesus christ amen when we fully surrender we don't reason we don't question and you know satan satan's trait is always to put question in god's word amen but when we fully surrender our will our hearts our lives to his word there's no more question and i remember when when when that when satan threw the serpent questioned the word amen and the next thing that that he said to eve know you not that you shall be like gods they wear amen because a son and daughter of god they were a mature god you know a kitten when he grows he's a cat amen so a son of god when he matures when he's in rightful position what will he be amen so adam and eve were amateur god right then amen but satan wants to put question right in those potential that they already have amen so by saying you see amen you know uh you can be like god amen well if only he could you know just said well i am there's no question amen so the same thing amen you know when when he puts question to your position to question you being the bread of jesus christ being part of the body of jesus christ but when you know your position when you know who you are amen that's where the mystery becomes unfolded right amen when you know who you are and we know what's to be done with the world amen and when we know our rightful position then only then we can be an invincible part of the invincible army amen so you see all these things through the message of the hour through through our relationship with the lord jesus christ and it has you know our relationship is uh as some has a great deal you know in serving the lord i read one time an article that says you know it's not religion but it's relation right and i agree and and he keeps on saying that the true the true uh true religion says true religion is uh sitting in the pew in the church and thinking about the lake fishing and relation he said and true relation is sitting on the lake fishing thinking about god but let me add something to that just make sure it's not on a sunday because i remember i remember two friends you know that you know they used to go to church together and say let's go to church oh i'm thinking i need to go fishing today just be like to go fishing really okay well i cannot go with you i go to the church and then you know the friend while he's in the church he's thinking of his friend so it is an example of a man sitting in the pew thinking about his he should be in the lake and the other man in the lake he's speaking and then he said oh what brother what what you you know what is brother samuel preaching today so you see let me tell you both of them are losers we should occupy our rightful position amen we should always occupy our position you see you have you have seats in here i don't know but you have seats here amen that every time you feel comfortable right you want to be there just right there and every time you sit there and then you feel comfortable as if god you know there is there is some kind of a channel that the blessing is just going straight to you that's why you go to church because you want nobody will take that position amen and and and you see but somehow you know just you also remember your pastor amen that your pastor amen when you when he looks in this area he knows who's sitting there right yeah amen but you see amen it kind of encouraged us also amen that you know amen you know all of us are in need and and we are submitting ourselves we cannot we can sacrifice everything and see it and encourage the ministry i mean encourage our brothers sometimes we go to church not just to get blessings but we want to be a blessing we want to be an encouragement hallelujah that just merely our presence hallelujah can glorify god because somebody's sitting in here when when when when when you are there just right there people you know you just say amen how are you god bless you amen and the the some kind of a spirit kindred spirit that will bring up encouragement to each and every one of us amen and all these things amen so just like the warriors the fighters of israel they came from different battles they came from barrio's location they had different gifts but they came to one place amen to bring david as king to recognize him as king hallelujah and no one but david must be their king and it's the same thing today we come here we we fought our own battles for a week all of us have our own battles with different sizes with different places but it's the same satan amen but all these warriors men expert in wars hallelujah come together to bring david king hallelujah we have come here to leave jesus christ as our king i mean he's the head of all amen and and we we we submit ourselves to him and we declare that he has taken the hardship of our lives oh my on what a relationship with that kind you know when we come into that relationship you know there's many things just like you know just like hosea that we we often we often call you know uh uh chapter 2 verse 16 that in that day he said you're not going to call me ba ali but also easy amen and easy means husband and ba'ali means lord but it's a prophecy for you and i and me that the time has come that he is not only lord for us but he is husband for us amen and with these two kinds of relationship there is much difference because him being our lord there is some kind of of course he is our lord abraham remains to be the lord to sarah amen but you know when you when you violate when you uh violate something against your lord you get the penalty amen but look at eve amen but her head was there because she was part of him adam did not say well lord i still have many ribs here you can take another one but no it will not make adam complete without that right because she that was the predestinated bride for adam she's born of her bones and flesh of his flesh and with those kind of relationship amen you know when you broke something a wife can broke something in the house can break something in the house but the husband will not ask him to pay for it but if you work in a company and you broke something the boss will ask you to pay for it because the relationship is lowered right and servant but when it comes to the relationship of husband and wife it's all the rest brothers and sisters amen we find rest in the presence of the head hallelujah and so we see that's why everything he's the provider of all our needs he's the healer and he is the redeemer of the body so i thank the lord that we have come to the point that we have already recognized him as our absolute head amen and when we read this scripture jesus is happy to quote this scripture today nest birds have nests boxes of holes and i thank for the bride because the son of man also has the neck right amen to lay the head hallelujah so god bless you and may this little ministry has been a blessing and you're always been a blessing to me amen brother samuel and brother wade there's been a great encouragement for us amen and i really appreciate you staying amen and uh i really enjoyed that great testimony amen and i i keep it in my heart amen that god he's the same god here and he's the same god over there hallelujah so god bless you and you keep on praying for brother dany and don't forget that on november 18 19 and 20 there will be 150 ministers in myanmar that will be hearing this message for the very first time we're not after numbers or not after quantity but it's the quality but if there is one there peter branham said only one amen can can turn myanmar upside down hallelujah but who knows amen who knows so we just give them the opportunity because we believe amen that if there's seed laying there it only takes the rain and the sunshine and the life will come out right hallelujah so let's keep it in your prayers and also my trip to japan this coming october and now uh uh by the way does shown me an email somewhere in davao in the philippines that's all that's that's also my route because i go to ghidapawan that is uh part of that kidapawan city which is cotabato if you if you see in the uh in the map you see that that portion there are muslims also that's further south of the the country where muslims in the philippines stay but we have we have ministry also there and there is no straight flight to kidapawan but you have to come to pass through davao and probably if there's opportunity that contact we're going to drop by there and meet him and we just don't know what the lord will uh will do so god bless you and always stay in our position let him be the head of our lives and we don't reason we don't question him all things work together for good right i love him god bless you amen for the same amen thank you lord amen enjoy the message make sure you tell our brother how much you enjoyed it because we believe in headship yes sir you know a headless horseman wouldn't do too good because it wouldn't know where it's going that may be where we've been in our lives a lot of times we maybe didn't know which way was going oh yeah but we've come to find our head and our head is christ and he's the word amen so then we go to the word we know who the headship is and know what to do with it right so go ahead brother number 80 in the red book number eight anybody have a need you know just remember these ones that are sick among us and things remember to pray for them that the lord would
