[0:25] let's pray Heavenly Father we were ever
[0:31] grateful and thankful that we have a
[0:34] savior that we can call upon blood that
[0:37] would bless our hearts Lord and give us
[0:39] strength father even it may seem dark
[0:42] our lost fear you of the light unto us
[0:44] guide us Lord in the pathways of
[0:47] righteousness whether we will surrender
[0:50] Lord always unto you register blessings
[0:53] be with us but we ask you to bless the
[0:56] sign of school classes father grant unto
[0:59] them Lord that which they have me to
[1:02] here found that they will be strong from
[1:05] the word that they do here

[1:10] scriptures this morning well let him
[1:13] bless our hearts and letters we
[1:14] surrender to father we ask you to bless
[1:17] brother day I will test him in a special
[1:19] way and he would bring unto us lo words
[1:22] that we strengthened to our hearts and
[1:25] leadership where we have neither and
[1:27] just bless us all until Christ and we
[1:30] pray amen
[1:36] I'm going to read proverbs 16 the
[1:42] preparation of the heart and man and the
[1:45] answer of the tongue is from the Lord
[1:56] the mid that works unto the Lord and
[1:59] that thou shalt be established
[2:10] everyone that is proud in heart is that
[2:13] abomination to the Lord through a hand
[2:16] John in hand he shall not be unpunished
[2:28] when a man weighs please the Lord
[2:32] you make it theme that his enemy to be
[2:35] at peace with him a man's heart devises
[2:45] his way the Lord direct his steps
[2:52] a just weight and balance are the laws
[3:00] all the weight of the bag showed he'll
[3:04] work out his works righteous lips are
[3:15] the delight of kings and they love him
[3:19] that speaketh right in the light of the
[3:30] King countenance his life and his favour
[3:34] is a cloud of latter rain
[3:45] the highway of the upright is to depart
[3:49] from evil he that keepeth his way
[3:52] preservative so bear is it to be of a
[4:03] harmless peer with the lowly then to
[4:07] divide this pause with the proud the
[4:19] wise and heart shall be cow poo and the
[4:23] sweetness of her lips increase learning
[4:34] the heart of the wise teaches his mouth

[10:41] to see everybody in the house of the
[10:42] Lord
[10:42] you'd like to turn in your scriptures
[10:44] learn where we've been reading in
[10:46] Ephesians 2 in 1st Thessalonians 1 I
[10:52] don't know whether they've hooked up in
[10:56] the basement to get started or not but
[10:58] we were expecting a company but okay
[11:01] we'll just go on and they can do in the
[11:04] basement those little that'll be the
[11:07] best part they meant sister Monica's
[11:10] class says plus his act black it's
[11:13] supposed to be meeting in the sanctuary
[11:14] at 12:42 practice or song so remember
[11:18] that you know inordinately in Ephesians
[11:21] 2 in 1st Thessalonians 5 now if the Lord
[11:27] willing this coming Sunday wait and I
[11:31] will be going up into Illinois to put up
[11:36] deer stands and do some things on Monday
[11:38] Tuesday not on the sunday but we're
[11:40] going up and going to visit with a
[11:42] brother up in that area
[11:43] on Sunday and white would be ministering
[11:47] probably there but then we'll be back
[11:50] maybe Tuesday Wednesday aren't ever what
[11:54] it takes to try to get done but what
[11:56] we're going to do is we're going to make
[12:00] the announcements then I've told them if
[12:01] they have to change because of some
[12:04] company coming in that needs an
[12:06] interpretation but as far as laying out
[12:09] right now next Sunday morning brother
[12:11] Louise will be taking the morning
[12:13] service but Aaron will be taking the
[12:17] afternoon service and brother Bob black
[12:20] will take the Wednesday following which
[12:23] is the 29th so that will be the
[12:26] announcements as now something goes
[12:29] wrong with thee because they're supposed
[12:31] to bend some people come they would need
[12:33] interpretation so if it is with you
[12:36] attach that up and you know do whatever
[12:38] whatever we need to do well
[12:41] they need to do they can take care of it
[12:43] while we're going okay all right father
[12:45] we thank you for your love and your
[12:47] grace we thank you for the day thank you
[12:50] for loving us Lord and do we do this we
[12:53] just ask you to guide us now as we
[12:55] attempt to speak a little bit about you
[12:58] because that's the main thing that we
[13:00] need we need hearing to come and we
[13:03] believe faith comes by hearing and
[13:05] hearing by the word of the Lord so we
[13:08] pray that you would bless each one and
[13:10] open our eyes and understanding and that
[13:13] our hearts be set on you forgive our
[13:15] sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[13:18] and help us to walk in you we love you
[13:21] in Jesus name any other yeah Father's
[13:30] Day sign up now to all of the brothers
[13:34] would want to go in up and we'll have a
[13:36] couple of days of relaxation for all of
[13:41] the father's visions too we've been
[13:45] reading so we're just going down to
[13:46] verse eight to save time and pick that
[13:49] up then we'll go over to first
[13:51] Thessalonians
[13:52] says for by grace are you saved through
[13:56] faith that remember back in verse five
[14:00] you know you told me by grace you're
[14:03] saved now he says by grace through faith
[14:07] which is a journey it's traveling this
[14:10] week you know and that we're by grace
[14:14] are you saved through faith and that not
[14:16] of yourselves it is the gift of God okay
[14:19] now let's pick up 1st Thessalonians 5:23
[14:24] this isn't the very God of peace
[14:26] sanctify you wholly and I pray God your
[14:30] whole spirit and soul and body be
[14:33] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[14:36] the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be
[14:39] seated the Lord had his blessing to the
[14:42] reading of the word now we've been
[14:47] attempting for a while to minister about
[14:54] salvation talking about salvation and
[14:58] we're - we chose that as a point because
[15:02] so many things can be covered in using
[15:07] the word salvation more than to talk
[15:10] about redemption or different things but
[15:14] now remember what we've been driving at
[15:17] if you're saved by grace through faith
[15:21] it's a journey it's the trowel it's just
[15:25] like life you born into the world you
[15:29] come into the world and you you you you
[15:32] know you live but you're taking a
[15:34] journey through life well your Christian
[15:37] journey is the same way it starts here
[15:40] in our world of life and you know and
[15:44] then continues on until we leave from
[15:47] this world all right
[15:49] and as we finish that part up of leaving
[15:53] from this world you know all the way
[15:54] through until we either die go by the
[15:57] grave whatever or come to a change in a
[16:01] moment a twinkling of an eye whatever
[16:03] the existence we will one day change
[16:05] from this way of living our more
[16:10] thoughts and will be brought in to a
[16:13] glorified condition in what you call
[16:17] heaven whatever you want to call it and
[16:19] do another point but then it would come
[16:22] to of an existence greater than this one
[16:27] all right so then we don't expect I'm
[16:32] one firm believer in the future we don't
[16:37] expect things to just play around and we
[16:40] go up to heaven and and we sat down and
[16:43] we play harps and and stuff like that
[16:45] you know and do now we're going to be
[16:48] human beings and we're going to be a
[16:51] living according to the Book of
[16:52] Revelations right here in this world on
[16:54] this earth that's been totally renewed
[16:57] not destroyed but to be renewed or
[17:01] changed and will go into an existence of
[17:05] that and
[17:06] we'll get a message of cheer down to the
[17:09] endless ages coach I've taught you from
[17:12] the beginning this is what I believe I
[17:14] believe that the time we have here on
[17:17] earth in our Christian journey as we're
[17:20] talking about is only a preparation for
[17:25] the future to come all right see the
[17:30] heaven help I love being a Christian and
[17:33] I like believing and I enjoy living I
[17:36] have a good time at it and all but I
[17:38] sure do hope this is not all of it you
[17:41] know I mean that's that's the best I can
[17:43] say if this is all of it then you know I
[17:47] don't know so I want to you know I want
[17:51] to believe in a future as the old Indian
[17:54] called it - happy hunting grounds and
[17:56] this one we call it this and that we
[17:58] called it that but it's a future time to
[18:01] be living after this existence here but
[18:06] this is the preparation right this is
[18:11] the life the preparation we spend our
[18:13] life preparing for the future right you
[18:17] go to school you go to college you go to
[18:20] this you go to do a job you learn this
[18:23] you do that and you're preparing for the
[18:26] future we'll see one day the future will
[18:29] take place and when it does then we'll
[18:32] see that what we've been here is it's
[18:35] just a foundation it's just getting us
[18:37] ready to where we can and understand so
[18:40] there'd be a message of cheer to be down
[18:43] through the endless ages as time runs
[18:47] out of here
[18:48] alright now we've covered in our life's
[18:52] messages talking about as I said we've
[18:57] been dealing with for salvation all
[19:01] right we'll keep that title for a while
[19:03] to deal with salvation because it will
[19:06] cover any avenue that we need to cover
[19:09] but what have we been talking about what
[19:11] is the new birth all right now Jesus in
[19:18] speaking
[19:19] we'll get to it another message later
[19:20] but speaking to Nicodemus he said you
[19:23] must be born again when Nicodemus
[19:25] couldn't understand that terminology now
[19:29] he was the greatest learned scholar of
[19:31] all the times you know and Jesus spoke
[19:35] of him and honored him for that the
[19:38] teacher of Israel and didn't understand
[19:40] what he was a saying but he was saying
[19:43] you must be born again Nicodemus said
[19:45] you mean I got to go to my mother's womb
[19:46] I got to be born again he said now
[19:49] that's not what I'm talking about
[19:51] said in other words the original
[19:53] translations literally says you must be
[19:56] born from above they so Jesus was saying
[20:01] you got to be born from where I come
[20:02] from but said you don't understand this
[20:06] earthly things you know said because the
[20:10] earthly things that are happening are an
[20:12] example to you and you don't understand
[20:15] that how can it be that you'll
[20:17] understand
[20:18] heavenly matters that I would speak up
[20:20] all right but he said you must be born
[20:23] again or what is the born-again
[20:26] experience what is the new birth as we
[20:31] talked about well I cried I shouted we
[20:34] come to the altar we've done this we've
[20:35] done that all that's well and good but
[20:38] that's an outward manifestation of an
[20:42] inward work or it's worth nothing unto
[20:44] you all right see because we we've got
[20:48] to be born from above like he was born
[20:51] all right then you know we'll get to
[20:54] that in a minute and cover some parts of
[20:56] it but what is the new birth
[20:59] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[21:02] personally reveal to you what I never
[21:08] never heard of the new birth of our
[21:11] born-again experience being a revelation
[21:13] well that's where I think we need to
[21:17] grow up and start learning a little bit
[21:20] from you know the Word of God and start
[21:24] understanding above our little sugar
[21:27] tier thoughts that we have you know well
[21:30] I cried I prayed I asked
[21:32] to save me that's well and good but did
[21:37] he save you I accepted him as my savior
[21:41] and I believe that's all I need to do
[21:44] well the Bible says being born again
[21:49] it's a process that's taking place and
[21:53] like I've tried to say to you that it
[21:56] took the disciples 3 and 1/2 years for
[22:01] the Lord Jesus to bring his message to
[22:04] them that they would qualify for going
[22:08] to the Upper Room and the reason I use
[22:11] the word qualify because the Bible said
[22:13] that Jesus was seen of over 500 brethren
[22:16] after his resurrection but only 120 made
[22:20] the upper room some reason or thought
[22:24] they didn't qualify so they didn't get
[22:27] to go there all right but those that did
[22:31] qualify and had three and a half years
[22:33] of teaching of the word of God and see
[22:36] we think all you got to do just walk
[22:38] down the altar and say I accept Jesus
[22:40] Christ as my savior well that's the
[22:43] starting right direction that ain't the
[22:46] whole journey that's what I'm trying to
[22:47] get you to see when you was born into
[22:54] the world what do you two do well well I
[22:56] was just born into the world no you got
[22:58] to eat you got to live you got to
[23:01] prepare you got to do to grow right and
[23:06] so is it in your Christian journey and
[23:09] that's what Nicodemus they couldn't
[23:12] understand Jesus explaining taking the
[23:17] natural life that he was looking at he
[23:20] said you must be born of water and
[23:22] spirit and applying that to him
[23:25] to try to get him to understand what it
[23:28] meant but see those people back there
[23:31] they believed in God they done all they
[23:36] could do those disciples for three and a
[23:39] half years were great believers but they
[23:43] they had to go to Pentecost
[23:45] to receive the new birth alright and see
[23:49] then what do we do what I've just
[23:50] accepted Jesus Christ is my Savior what
[23:53] else can I do
[23:55] what is God done and we use the
[23:59] terminologies and we say well you know
[24:02] abraham believed god what else can we do
[24:06] other anymore than what Abraham did was
[24:08] right but God done some day Brian
[24:11] abraham believed God the Bible said and
[24:15] it was imputed unto him imparted
[24:17] translated down to him our move brought
[24:20] to his room of a point that Abraham the
[24:28] believing is what brought God on the
[24:31] scene right he believed God and it was
[24:34] imputed unto him for righteousness all
[24:37] right and then believing it then it
[24:39] brought God on the scene but what did
[24:41] God do God gave Abraham circumcision
[24:43] there's a sign of the new birth a sign
[24:48] of the change of life or to making us
[24:51] Christians and he gave that to Abraham
[24:54] so what is God done for you and I well
[24:58] I'll tell you order I don't understand
[25:01] the way that you folks talk you know
[25:04] because I've always just thought with
[25:06] this just one of them shook the
[25:08] preachers hand or cried or or said some
[25:11] Creed or some doctrine or some idea you
[25:14] know and where's it saved well where'd
[25:19] you get that from you didn't get it out
[25:20] of the Bible in the Bible they had an
[25:24] experience doesn't matter whether it was
[25:29] 120 in the upper room the 3000 outside
[25:32] later on that day no matter how many or
[25:36] whatever or how long it took they had to
[25:40] have an experience a sensation you don't
[25:45] have to have sensations are stimulations
[25:48] upon your flesh you know beings coming
[25:51] out but the experience is something you
[25:54] live through you've lived through I'm 79
[25:59] years
[25:59] I've lived through that part alright see
[26:04] because it's been a journey to me
[26:06] alright see then what is the new birth
[26:10] yeah it's the birth of the word that
[26:16] you've heard what was the new birth to
[26:19] the disciples come on what was the new
[26:26] birth to the disciple like I said there
[26:29] were three and a half years and then
[26:30] Jesus teaching them that didn't give him
[26:32] eternal life right they had to go to the
[26:38] Upper Room to receive Jesus Christ as
[26:41] their Savior and he had to die to
[26:43] release that life to where they could
[26:46] come back upon them to give them eternal
[26:49] life so it's a lot more than just saying
[26:52] well you know I believe God I accepted
[26:55] God I'm a Christian that's what's wrong
[26:59] with the world today then you see them
[27:02] just go right see people just go right
[27:04] back I don't throw those stones I just
[27:06] try to tell truth when was the Baptist
[27:09] Church we had this one man we'd go to
[27:11] him and talk to him when they were
[27:12] having a revival and he'd come to the
[27:15] altar and he'd cry and pray and he'd get
[27:17] up and he'd say I'm saved now I'm saved
[27:21] well he never made it to the next night
[27:23] no I'm not telling no joking or lie I'm
[27:27] telling it like it is he never made it
[27:29] to the second night all right so then
[27:32] finally they come another revival time
[27:34] and they go to the we would we go to him
[27:38] and talk to him about accepting it he'd
[27:40] come to the altar he'd cry he'd pray
[27:42] he'd get up he'd say I got it now
[27:46] but he never did get it as far as I was
[27:49] concerned I heard later he did become a
[27:52] Christian well I I hope so but I'm just
[27:56] saying what I knew or know about the
[27:58] story every year he would make the same
[28:02] commitment or ever revival how about you
[28:04] and I come on what have we taught our
[28:09] children well all you got to do is just
[28:10] go to church and be good
[28:13] well Alcoholics Anonymous has got you
[28:16] beat don't mean that is a joke
[28:20] I'll tell us the truth they do go to the
[28:23] meetings and and and hang with it all
[28:26] the time and at least dedicate
[28:28] themselves to that Missy will accept it
[28:32] and it works for a little while Sigma
[28:33] and all the once it just seems to fall
[28:35] away and then you see people just
[28:37] dropping off dropping off leaving and
[28:41] they'll come back again one day when
[28:43] they get contacted again well I didn't
[28:49] know that was to be the Christian life I
[28:53] thought the Christian life was to be
[28:55] Christ to come and live in you and no
[28:59] matter what would come and go from that
[29:01] day on you walked in Christ and believed
[29:05] him and followed him and tried to live
[29:08] the life and tried to walk right and do
[29:10] rock I thought that was the Christian
[29:14] life see we've got to deal with
[29:20] something greater than and that's what
[29:22] I've been trying to do is is to speak to
[29:26] you about the new birth the new birth
[29:31] we've read it from the Prophet over and
[29:33] over when the Christ the mystery of God
[29:35] revealed what is the new birth he said
[29:38] he said it's revelation of Jesus Christ
[29:40] personally to you not you shouted not
[29:44] you cried not you spoke in tongues not
[29:47] you've done all of those things that's
[29:50] the aftereffect the baby cries after the
[29:56] baby gets here
[29:57] that's the after-effects are proof that
[30:00] it's alive if something has taken place
[30:04] to the little feller and they cry out
[30:06] all right because that's part of the
[30:09] experience okay but now think about it
[30:15] how many churches teach there under
[30:19] struffoli asking you the question you go
[30:24] to the baptist they have their way
[30:26] and you say you must be born again and
[30:28] and they'll tell you what you need to do
[30:30] you need to accept this you need to do
[30:32] that you need to come to church you need
[30:34] to do that you need to be good you go
[30:37] over to the Methodists they're gonna
[30:38] tell you this and they're gonna take it
[30:40] out you go to the Catholics they're
[30:42] gonna tell you this you go to this when
[30:44] you're gonna tell you this I'm gonna
[30:45] tell you that but where is the new birth
[30:49] involved in it why is it not that
[30:52] Nicodemus it's hard to stay away from
[30:58] that message kind of got my thoughts
[31:00] laid out for but you don't you think
[31:04] that Nicodemus knew all about living a
[31:08] good life
[31:12] don't you think Nicodemus lived a good
[31:15] natural life the position he was in
[31:21] really demanded a life be left are they
[31:27] would remove him from it one way or the
[31:29] other he didn't get by with sin because
[31:32] he was the high priest he was held
[31:35] responsible more than anyone else as
[31:40] being a high priest or a great leader in
[31:43] in Israel because he he was expected to
[31:48] be something well don't you think
[31:51] Nicodemus could tell all about that why
[31:54] was it he didn't understand Jesus who
[31:58] all it is is we just cries out well if I
[32:00] saw we're gonna do what did intimidate
[32:01] Messiah
[32:05] what did Nicodemus just say what I cried
[32:08] nicely I didn't had a good don't you
[32:13] think he did don't you think he served
[32:17] God to the best of them of could be why
[32:22] didn't he just say wooden tit that's
[32:24] what it is this is I've done all these
[32:26] things now Lord Jesus so so I'm saved
[32:30] no I like people I don't mean it's wrong
[32:35] meaning the right way I like intelligent
[32:38] people and that
[32:40] not necessarily how much education you
[32:41] got under so many intelligence I like to
[32:44] talk to intelligence people not college
[32:47] degrees that ain't nothing
[32:48] that's not intelligence to me
[32:49] intelligence to me is how flying
[32:51] common-sense that's intelligence is you
[32:55] just got plain common straight since
[32:59] that's the best intelligent anybody
[33:01] could use all right and you think
[33:04] Nicodemus wasn't that formula night well
[33:09] yet when the Lord Jesus said you must be
[33:10] born again he says I don't understand
[33:16] you
[33:17] if you telling me that I need to shout I
[33:21] need to cry I need to go to church I
[33:24] need to live good enough I've done that
[33:25] all my life come on right put yourself
[33:30] in this situation with Nicodemus don't
[33:34] you think that he had a good Oh
[33:36] he bragged on the Lord Jesus he told him
[33:40] he said no man can do the things you're
[33:42] doing unless God be with him and then
[33:44] Jesus turned back and gave him the
[33:46] greatest report he said you are the
[33:49] teacher he was the greatest of all the
[33:54] teachers and he couldn't understand if
[33:58] it was crying if it was shouting if it
[34:00] was speaking in Talk it was if it was
[34:03] some emotional situation any form
[34:06] whatsoever
[34:07] why would Nicodemus not be able to say
[34:10] I've got that you remember the rich
[34:15] young ruler when the him that said for
[34:18] I've kept these things for my youth you
[34:23] know he said what mustard only 19 I said
[34:27] I've kept these things for my youth but
[34:33] yet he didn't accept Jesus Christ as
[34:35] their Savior but yet he lived all that
[34:39] life do you understand the point that's
[34:41] a message I'll review it when we get to
[34:43] it but think about it when Jesus said
[34:47] you must be born of water and a spirit
[34:54] now that water there is just not you
[34:56] gets your baptism that's part of it
[34:59] go on repent every one of you about what
[35:02] must we do to be safe repented one hard
[35:04] that's part of it now but that's not all
[35:07] the story that's not that water these
[35:08] home out there I'll show you where the
[35:11] Prophet said it that's washing of the
[35:13] water by the word it's not just water
[35:17] baptism and Holy Ghost baptism that puts
[35:20] you in the kingdom it's washed by the
[35:24] water of the word we'll cover that on
[35:26] sanctification when we get down to
[35:28] talking those you see I'm talking
[35:32] basically there's a few people here that
[35:35] come through Pentecost and they know
[35:39] their basic doctrine was to be justified
[35:42] sanctified and how the baptism of the
[35:46] Holy Ghost which rest of us or Baptist
[35:48] Methodist Presbyterian whatever you know
[35:52] and we never had none of that all we
[35:55] have just go to church be good shake
[35:57] hands with the preacher you know pay you
[35:59] tithe make sure everything's running
[36:01] good
[36:01] you know have a good family do all this
[36:04] and you're saved make sure you play the
[36:07] part you know we had an old say in the
[36:10] Baptist well you know that feller made
[36:12] it because he paved the parking lot well
[36:14] in other words our point was he was a
[36:17] good guy because he showed what he was
[36:19] doing he done a lot of good things and
[36:23] that was alright but we had one it was
[36:24] kind of little on the others flaky side
[36:27] of the story and he painted the church
[36:29] will everybody put him in heaven when he
[36:31] died well I ain't got none to do with me
[36:33] I don't care what got done with him
[36:34] that's his business I'm just making a
[36:37] point
[36:38] all right but listen do you realize that
[36:45] we have examples in the Bible that we
[36:49] need to go by and look at you know that
[36:53] Mary made a confession in her life that
[36:57] she was virgin born right
[37:03] she told everybody you know she's virgin
[37:05] born in other words not she be Birds
[37:07] anymore the babies that she had was
[37:09] virgin bowling or not you with me they
[37:12] finally even the Catholics made her
[37:14] virginal that's all right that's nothing
[37:16] to me but the point is you know that she
[37:21] actually denied the Lord Jesus she
[37:23] denied the virgin birth she denied the
[37:27] fact that Jesus was virgin born you
[37:30] remember the story when they were there
[37:32] and they they had been there for about
[37:34] three days and then went back and he
[37:37] wouldn't among them and he's they got to
[37:40] hunting for Jesus and they found out he
[37:42] went back and they found him talking to
[37:44] the scribes and Pharisees and things and
[37:48] the big rulers and all you know and when
[37:52] they did then here comes Mary up and she
[37:55] had given her confession all of her life
[37:56] code at that town these 13 14 years old
[37:59] and her confession had been that she was
[38:03] a virgin and that had a child and
[38:06] fulfilling the scripture within right
[38:08] there in front of everybody she said
[38:10] your father and I taught you diligently
[38:16] acclaiming what that Joseph was the
[38:20] father of Jesus she denied the virgin
[38:26] birth right she denied him being virgin
[38:33] born and by denying all of that it would
[38:37] have put her right in a bad position
[38:39] because that would have made her a
[38:42] prostitute okay but what did Jesus say
[38:49] he said I must be about my father's
[38:51] business but she did not die virgin
[39:00] birth
[39:01] you know what the Prophet says on the
[39:03] sea not air with her shut the
[39:06] Pentecostals denied the birth of the
[39:09] word
[39:15] your denominational Church systems has
[39:18] denied the birth of the word in other
[39:21] words that have word with virgin born
[39:27] they claim him to be one of the three
[39:29] you know the Trinity doctrine came out
[39:33] and they declared him to be one of the
[39:35] three denying him to be Almighty God
[39:42] what about me and you come on you
[39:51] remember what we were talking about on
[39:53] the last message a little bit according
[39:56] to the book of Revelation there's three
[39:57] unclean spirits like frogs comes out in
[40:01] the last days the Prophet said after the
[40:04] opening of the seals it comes out which
[40:08] would mean after he preached the seals
[40:11] come out a new Trinity what is that new
[40:17] Trinity your ideas and my ideas contrary
[40:20] to the word cuz what's the old Trinity
[40:22] come straight from Rome not in the Word
[40:26] of God has no Basics in the word there's
[40:29] no Basics in the word for a Trinity a
[40:32] trial and being YESCO that's what God is
[40:35] but not a Trinity not three persons see
[40:40] we told that you know God in three
[40:41] persons Blessed Trinity where's that in
[40:43] the Bible
[40:45] it's not dark see so we're denying the
[40:49] virgin birth we're denying the fact that
[40:52] Jesus Christ is Almighty God oh I didn't
[41:00] know was that bad you know what we've
[41:04] been taught actually destroys the fact
[41:07] of understanding that Jesus was God when
[41:10] he said I and my father are one he said
[41:14] unless you believe that I am he
[41:16] you'll die in your sins he declared
[41:19] himself to be Almighty God in human
[41:22] flesh the Bible plainly holds that up
[41:25] all the way through right
[41:30] let's see what are we doing we're
[41:33] denying the word do you say well I think
[41:39] he's a Trinity I think I think there's
[41:41] really three guards well then you're
[41:43] denying the word the same thing Mary
[41:44] done that's what your prophet is
[41:49] illustrating Mary denied the birth of
[41:54] Jesus Christ as to be in virgin and made
[42:00] him the son of Joseph what do we make
[42:08] him
[42:17] if the new birth is what the Prophet
[42:20] said it was and the Bible says it is
[42:22] Jesus said it would he said you must be
[42:25] born again you must be born from above
[42:29] you must be must have a new birth called
[42:32] your natural birth is not good enough
[42:35] was that simply what he was explaining
[42:38] that's what the Lord Jesus was
[42:40] explaining to Nicodemus Nicodemus said
[42:42] all these things I kept all of my life I
[42:43] shouted I cried I've spoken to you
[42:45] understand what I'm making the
[42:46] illustration I'm making the illustration
[42:49] the way we talk it wouldn't back there
[42:52] of they cried shouts well I'm staying it
[42:54] today what we're doing we're denying the
[43:01] fact that Almighty God dwell in human
[43:05] flesh in the man called Jesus Christ but
[43:10] yet claiming him as our Savior right but
[43:18] how do we declare him well how did you
[43:23] get born again
[43:24] well I shouted I cried out spoken up I
[43:26] felt good I had a shout and good time on
[43:28] glory hallelujah I've done all coming
[43:32] now whether you call what I was doing or
[43:35] not that wouldn't work with Nicodemus go
[43:39] Nicodemus had ever better this ducks in
[43:41] the road right plain old language he was
[43:45] a straight up and down guy yet
[43:52] everything in perfect order to fit what
[43:54] Jesus was saying about the new birth but
[44:00] because of his terminologies he couldn't
[44:03] understand him
[44:06] do we understand him how can you have
[44:11] salvation without the blood of Jesus
[44:14] Christ oh I believe what Judas believed
[44:23] and according to the Bible just one oh
[44:28] brother used to say the last time I read
[44:30] it still there
[44:30] according to the Bible the devil's
[44:34] believed in one God and they tremble
[44:39] about it that's according to the Bible
[44:42] now what does that make them saved see
[44:50] what is your new birth that's that's all
[44:57] I've been trying to drive that for a
[44:59] week after week what is your new birth
[45:01] what do you count your point of
[45:03] salvation that's being well I really
[45:08] don't know brother then I just always
[45:10] been a good person went to church and
[45:12] try to do what was right
[45:13] praise God Alcoholics Anonymous like to
[45:16] have you there's a good neighbor that
[45:20] don't make you a Christian come on I
[45:25] keep laying it down
[45:26] don't you think Nicodemus had it and he
[45:28] had everything in line he was a great
[45:32] guy yet everything in perfect order yet
[45:38] he couldn't answer the simplicity of
[45:40] when Jesus said you must be born again
[45:47] the rich young ruler said all of these
[45:51] things I've kept from my youth what
[45:55] Jesus say you like one thing go sell
[45:59] what you got and give to the poor the
[46:01] Bible said he went away sorrowful why
[46:04] because he let his riches get between
[46:06] him and God what about it what is the
[46:14] new birth could we be denying the fact
[46:22] of Jesus being Almighty God no no I
[46:27] believe it president I've always
[46:29] believed Jesus was God well why did you
[46:32] have him as a second person running
[46:34] around or the third or whatever you had
[46:37] him well that's all I know
[46:41] well that's good
[46:43] but what about the truth see what is the
[46:48] new birth if it's none of those signs
[46:54] and one of the things that you deal with
[46:55] you know emotions or sensations or
[46:58] speaking in tongues or crying upfront
[47:00] then what is it the I stand here today
[47:08] to say to you and declare just like the
[47:11] Lord Jesus said you must be born again
[47:15] you must have come about me you all of
[47:19] us must have the new birth if not we're
[47:25] lost yet I can sit and read I can stand
[47:31] here and read faces I don't have to read
[47:33] inside he's telling me I'm lost if
[47:45] you're not born again you are what's the
[47:48] point I ain't arguing with nobody come
[47:53] on if I'm not born again I'm lost
[47:57] what about you
[47:58] I believe the Prophet does that make you
[48:01] something different Nicodemus would tell
[48:07] you he believed all of the prophets
[48:11] right we claim to believe one prophet he
[48:16] claimed we believe every one of them
[48:19] come on church I wish you'd get down one
[48:22] of these days to just thank him sensible
[48:24] we read the Bible and we think more
[48:28] we've got it I've taught you over and
[48:31] over you realize we read the account of
[48:36] Nicodemus and the Lord Jesus takes you
[48:38] two or three minutes to read it we think
[48:42] he gathered helper in a room with him
[48:43] somewhere in about three minutes later
[48:46] he's walking out the door
[48:52] come on that situation could have taken
[48:57] hours for them to sit and discuss my
[49:03] Bible don't say that with common sense
[49:12] you think Nicodemus put his life on the
[49:15] line you think the Lord Jesus met him
[49:18] and said those few words to him and
[49:20] Nicodemus gets up walks out the door
[49:22] something's wrong with your mentor there
[49:25] are there's that common sense part
[49:26] something's wrong with your common sense
[49:28] maybe you're smart but you don't have no
[49:31] common sense they could have been
[49:37] talking for hours about the Scriptures
[49:41] well because it would start out in a
[49:44] good situation
[49:45] Nicodemus making the confession that no
[49:49] man can do the things you do unless God
[49:52] be with him
[49:54] Nicodemus saying you know that about
[49:58] Jesus Jesus saying about Nicodemus he
[50:02] said you are the teacher the greatest of
[50:08] all the teachers of that day stood there
[50:10] with the God of glory and you think they
[50:13] spent about 5 minutes talking over a
[50:16] little situation and got up walk out the
[50:18] door I'm just playing I'm sorry that
[50:22] shows me you don't know how a plain
[50:24] common sense you had plain common sense
[50:29] you'd sit down thank it over what would
[50:32] what would be your argument for them to
[50:34] take hours discussing the Bible pretty
[50:43] good
[50:43] situation we sat on wooden pretty good
[50:46] opportunity for them to be able to
[50:49] discuss the Scriptures but my main point
[50:57] is one thing Nicodemus life and things
[51:02] he had everything in order but he
[51:10] couldn't understand you must be point
[51:14] again all of his life he'd been taught
[51:21] go to church pay your tithe live a good
[51:26] life do all of what God said I do or
[51:31] don't do what he said don't do right and
[51:35] he would sit down saying these things
[51:37] I've done pretty good man wouldn't he
[51:47] you understand he's pretty good man
[51:50] that rich younger older was a good guy
[51:54] he had kept all the commandments yet
[52:05] that didn't make him born-again he said
[52:12] well if he did just went and sold
[52:13] everything give it that have been
[52:15] written off it went sold everything he
[52:17] still had to went to the upper room they
[52:19] come on don't don't go that way with me
[52:21] if he went and sold everything give
[52:23] everything away he would have still had
[52:25] to went to the upper room to receive the
[52:27] new birth because that was their only
[52:29] possibility of receiving eternal life
[52:32] the only possibility and the Bible
[52:35] terminologies are speaking was an upper
[52:37] room experience that they had to be born
[52:44] again
[52:49] what about it could we be like Mary
[52:53] could we be denying the Lord Jesus to be
[52:58] who he says he is maybe that's why we
[53:06] don't have the new birth well I see I
[53:14] don't I know you you're I'm not that
[53:18] smart but I got a little decent common
[53:20] sense I think I've been argued about
[53:23] that a lot that's all right I think we
[53:29] taught don't try to sit down and think
[53:32] about things we must be born again well
[53:37] you got to shout and cry grandma done it
[53:40] and and she's saved here's one that's
[53:47] flat back in your face you know just
[53:49] cause you've done them things don't mean
[53:50] you're going to have them you say in
[53:51] Grand mine in heaven see that close to
[53:54] home story that he ended it between
[53:57] Nicodemus and Lord Jesus if that's where
[53:59] they got anything out the door you said
[54:03] my grandma was lost cause I was there
[54:05] when she shouted will praise God
[54:08] grandma's gonna face god herself because
[54:14] this is one thing I firmly believe ever
[54:17] born-again believer has to have their
[54:21] own personal experience with God now
[54:27] that's as plain as I can believe about
[54:29] anything it's not because mom and daddy
[54:32] were Christians that was a help to bring
[54:36] them to church put him in the right
[54:38] atmosphere and that everything but it
[54:40] didn't save nobody come on I'm this
[54:48] plane this can be even with the way that
[54:50] I'm talking the way that I do and I'm
[54:52] sorry I had a good family that kept me
[54:56] in church I didn't save me
[55:05] and the fact that was the biggest
[55:07] hindrance I had was the church of the
[55:10] day I've told you about it and they're
[55:14] not throwing awful nobody I knew and I
[55:19] told them they'd come talk to me about
[55:21] getting saved one day I said look I said
[55:24] I live a better life than your Deacon
[55:26] board lives and but they didn't want me
[55:29] to explain it they never asked me who or
[55:36] what not they got up and left I said
[55:41] because I live a better life than your
[55:43] Deacon board lives and then you're
[55:46] talking to me if I need to be saved you
[55:48] need to be there talking to them right
[55:54] because I was just honest and sincere
[55:57] that's why I was 18 years old before I
[55:59] was ever converted in any form in a
[56:01] Baptist Church or anything because I was
[56:05] above the point of just accepting this
[56:08] or that or the other you know what all
[56:10] you got to do is just be saved and just
[56:12] oh well you know God understands hell is
[56:19] gonna be full of people that know God
[56:20] understood don't you think that Mary
[56:27] thought she understood she said your
[56:30] father and I Jesus said I must be about
[56:39] my father's business he straightened her
[56:43] out right there in front of everybody
[56:45] now I'm serious and honest I don't even
[56:48] believe Mary had that problem any moment
[56:50] I'm seriously not I think that ended
[56:54] Mary's statement it was only the one
[56:56] time that she flopped wrong no because
[56:59] once she heard that she knew who she was
[57:02] talking to because she knew that was a
[57:05] virgin born son of the Living God
[57:09] she had birth names shorter noted right
[57:20] but brother Dale huh
[57:22] you know and that's what I told you
[57:24] don't misunderstand me there's 120 in
[57:27] the upper room took him three and a half
[57:28] years but the first thing downstairs I
[57:31] don't took him a few minutes I've never
[57:33] taught nothing like anybody would say
[57:35] that you know that you've got to go
[57:37] through a long experience of getting
[57:39] born again no it's according to what you
[57:43] can believe what you can understand
[57:49] there was people that receive the Holy
[57:51] Ghost just from hearing the word but I
[57:54] can quote to where the Prophet said very
[57:57] few will believe all the way to receive
[58:02] in the Hall to go you know why because
[58:05] they don't know come on I'm serious with
[58:11] you and many preachers you ever heard
[58:13] preach on the new birth and keep trying
[58:15] their best to read to you over and over
[58:17] and over and over
[58:18] knowing you're resenting it knowing
[58:20] you're you're not accepting it to be but
[58:23] knowing that the prophet of God told us
[58:25] what the new birth was and we're
[58:27] supposed to be believing him and that
[58:29] the new birth was what the revelation of
[58:33] Jesus Christ personally to you those
[58:37] disciples for three and a half years had
[58:40] a great experience but when that Holy
[58:42] Ghost fell in the upper room they went
[58:47] up there is scared to death because they
[58:51] thought that is going to die right they
[58:58] had seen the Lord Jesus and seen what he
[59:00] went through and thought he would be the
[59:02] one to deliver but when they come down
[59:05] to the point they've seen all of that
[59:06] they say we ain't delivered yet they get
[59:10] to the upper room and like I've always
[59:16] said if it's all you got to do is just
[59:18] believe it words the other four are 380
[59:20] that had seen him after his resurrection
[59:22] the Bible says that I don't that's not
[59:25] me
[59:25] the Bible said though he was seen of
[59:27] over 500
[59:28] brethren the Bible calls them brethren
[59:33] I'm not saying they didn't go later and
[59:36] receive the new birth no but why did
[59:41] they turn away from him do you know what
[59:51] the new birth is see there we go well
[59:58] I've done this I don't know I didn't ask
[1:00:00] you that
[1:00:00] what is the new birth it's the
[1:00:06] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:00:07] personally do you come on you won't
[1:00:12] scripture you don't want an ax to it I
[1:00:15] believe it were that Peters describing
[1:00:18] the message going back to him you know
[1:00:20] in the coming back over after Pentecost
[1:00:22] and he said listen Peter what is your
[1:00:27] new birth well I was up here and there's
[1:00:32] this guy come down and these things
[1:00:33] happen and we shouted we cried we don't
[1:00:36] know it now he did to say nothing like
[1:00:37] that
[1:00:38] what did he say come on I thought was
[1:00:43] supposed to be Bible reading Christian
[1:00:45] didn't it say didn't Peter say this is
[1:00:49] that that was spoken of by the prophets
[1:00:56] there's another one of them things do
[1:00:58] you think that's all they say it this is
[1:01:02] that he might have spent 30 minutes
[1:01:05] explaining what this and that was he
[1:01:09] could go back to what is it
[1:01:13] Ezekiel he could have went and took a
[1:01:17] see kill and read it write to him you
[1:01:19] know what is equal 36 or is it 35 I want
[1:01:22] to Ezekiel work there's so much to get a
[1:01:25] new heart and you spirit see we had that
[1:01:29] all messed up
[1:01:30] new heart and you know I get feelings I
[1:01:32] get that he said did I not put my spirit
[1:01:34] in you but Iran said that new heart a
[1:01:36] new spirit was not the new birth that's
[1:01:39] what's your prophets here
[1:01:41] but I put my spirit in you he said darts
[1:01:45] the new birth see Peter could have been
[1:01:49] explaining all of those thing yet we
[1:01:53] think it's a five minute and it's new
[1:01:54] probably longer it's over with
[1:01:59] let see put your own experience in there
[1:02:04] some time and think about it think about
[1:02:10] your own experience in life where you
[1:02:14] come from and what led you to where
[1:02:15] you're at and what you're doing you're
[1:02:21] surely not just putting it on you shout
[1:02:22] at you away where you're at cuz I'll
[1:02:26] tell you you're wrong I'll tell you you
[1:02:28] cried you way to where you're out
[1:02:30] come on I won't argue with that one you
[1:02:34] didn't do or how to lose you all your
[1:02:36] life know that a lot of our life
[1:02:39] Christian life has been crying out on
[1:02:41] our knees trying to find out from God
[1:02:43] what to do and where was that wasn't
[1:02:45] going on I walk out of that Baptist
[1:02:48] Church I was a deacon and everything

[1:04:07] hallelujah I was down and out go right
[1:04:11] now nowhere to go nothing to do they
[1:04:15] what none of them had me hey Church my
[1:04:22] family was one of the biggest ones in
[1:04:24] that church I could have pulled some
[1:04:27] strings with all of my brothers and
[1:04:29] sisters and took over that church but I
[1:04:34] knew I wasn't gonna do that
[1:04:38] nobody's gonna search for God until I
[1:04:44] found him and already hearing about the
[1:04:49] message reading sometimes six books in
[1:04:51] one day things like that I read this
[1:04:54] constantly brother calling to you I'd
[1:04:56] sit down there where he was working at
[1:04:58] and this had books Ireland just read and
[1:05:01] half the night sometime I already had
[1:05:07] that working but that wouldn't my new
[1:05:10] birth I'm gonna I've told you seen the
[1:05:15] angel of God when I was 11 years old
[1:05:17] standing in a church that would my new
[1:05:19] birth and tell you things that happened
[1:05:25] in my life but I never claimed none of
[1:05:27] him as my new birth the new birth that I
[1:05:32] have was the birth of the word when the
[1:05:34] word come unfolded to me and it's been a
[1:05:38] fun folding ever since I'll take that as
[1:05:42] my experience of the new birth what is
[1:05:45] yours
[1:05:47] you say yeah but how do I teach my
[1:05:49] children to teach your children exactly
[1:05:52] what we're gonna go through you're gonna
[1:05:54] go through justification you don't
[1:05:55] repent of your sins that's God to
[1:05:57] forgive you then you're gonna go to
[1:05:59] sanctification and how to cleanse and
[1:06:02] set aside and do then we're gonna go to
[1:06:04] the baptism the old ago we've got a long
[1:06:06] ways to go kids hang on
[1:06:08] but you've been with me long enough to
[1:06:10] know that I've always just been one time
[1:06:14] always my love and times is for these
[1:06:16] children to try to get them to God
[1:06:26] because I know what the new birth is
[1:06:30] people that say well well that wasn't
[1:06:33] what happened to me when I got born
[1:06:34] again well I'm not - got it wrote the
[1:06:36] book but if my life patterns the book
[1:06:40] better and your life patterns the book
[1:06:41] then I'm I'd be worried about it if I
[1:06:43] was you right well all I've done is
[1:06:49] cried no you can't tell me I ain't safe
[1:06:51] that's where you're at you're doing the
[1:06:54] same thing you don't understand you're
[1:06:56] doing the same thing that meri denied
[1:06:59] Jesus being the virgin birth you're
[1:07:06] denying him being Almighty God he had a
[1:07:15] natural birth into the world right and
[1:07:17] when Nicodemus said how can I do these
[1:07:19] like he said if I can't get you to see
[1:07:24] natural things you won't be seeing no
[1:07:29] spiritual time he said you're going to
[1:07:37] be born from where I come from are the
[1:07:42] originals I said look it up it says to
[1:07:45] be born from above
[1:07:50] in other words born from where he's born
[1:07:52] from well he had a birth I thought our
[1:08:00] new birth was our that part there that
[1:08:03] Christ is coming to live inside of us I
[1:08:06] thought that was the deal burger I
[1:08:09] didn't know it was shouting and crying
[1:08:11] even I thought it was a person come on
[1:08:18] church if you don't understand what I'm
[1:08:21] talking about
[1:08:22] I believe that new birth is a revelation
[1:08:24] of Jesus Christ which is the person of
[1:08:26] Almighty God that's come to live in you
[1:08:28] and me go to spoken words reading those
[1:08:34] seed read a little bit on that one but
[1:08:37] brother Branham said for the birth of
[1:08:40] the word is Christ not of polluted with
[1:08:44] denominations the early church no
[1:08:48] denominations just the word and spirit
[1:08:52] irrigated whether God laid the word down
[1:08:56] like that and the Holy Spirit irrigated
[1:08:59] it and Darcy went she brought four
[1:09:01] children you understand what he's saying
[1:09:05] God laid the word into them disciples
[1:09:09] for three and a half years on the day of
[1:09:15] Pentecost the Holy Ghost come to in and
[1:09:20] irrigate that as he's saying or in other
[1:09:22] words to make the word alive under their
[1:09:27] Pentecost the word was made alive into
[1:09:30] their hearts they knew that was Jesus
[1:09:32] then they died no argument that a
[1:09:35] revelation of who it was have we ever
[1:09:39] had that experience let us rather don't
[1:09:46] understand it go you you seem like you
[1:09:48] make a you seem like you make the new
[1:09:50] birth some kind of revelation what are
[1:09:52] you gonna make it at least minor fit the
[1:09:54] Bible come on brain what you got I'll be
[1:10:00] in office come brain won't you God at
[1:10:05] least I could put what I'm talking about
[1:10:07] in the Bible because that's where I got
[1:10:11] it from from the prophets message which
[1:10:15] is the Bible brought down to us in
[1:10:17] sermons and messages don't make the
[1:10:23] manly thing this mixing what God
[1:10:29] promised to be a messenger
[1:10:33] but what about it christ being revealed
[1:10:42] to you well what's our purpose for
[1:10:52] church than going to church and the
[1:10:54] preacher and the gathering and doing why
[1:10:57] don't we just eat drink and be merry and
[1:10:58] go home and just have a good time and
[1:10:59] forget the whole time I thought we were
[1:11:07] supposed to be desiring revelation more
[1:11:10] than anything right I thought we were to
[1:11:17] desire revelation more than anything
[1:11:20] else because the Bible says upon this
[1:11:24] rock I'll build my church
[1:11:25] Lord Jesus cetera and the gates of hell
[1:11:29] can't prevail against it well I priests
[1:11:34] opened up to the internet and I thought
[1:11:35] man Oh Lord we're gonna get tore up
[1:11:38] they're gonna be after us ain't doing it
[1:11:41] why because if I can read to you what
[1:11:44] the Prophet said don't you call me on no
[1:11:46] internet systems and try to tell me how
[1:11:48] wrong I am I'm gonna tell you that you
[1:11:51] show me where the Prophet says you show
[1:11:53] me where the Bible says it and we went
[1:11:56] all of these years without having any
[1:12:00] contact from people oh yeah they don't
[1:12:03] believe it because you know what they
[1:12:06] don't understand it
[1:12:11] now I'm gonna say this I'm acquitted
[1:12:13] only if you don't have the new birth you
[1:12:18] don't know what I'm talking about
[1:12:26] youuuu just gettin too strong why why if
[1:12:35] I don't have the new birth do I have any
[1:12:38] trouble with whether the words right or
[1:12:40] not now I'm gonna deny every bit of it
[1:12:44] marry deny
[1:12:46] the virgin birth I thought am I wrong in
[1:12:57] quoting that little random said the
[1:13:00] bride was to be delivered of a new birth
[1:13:03] from according to were Malachi 4 I
[1:13:11] thought that's what he said
[1:13:13] the bride was to be delivered of a new
[1:13:16] birth from according to Malachi 4 now
[1:13:20] Malachi 4 is behold I send you elijah
[1:13:23] the prophet well you know what he
[1:13:28] brought is wonderful but he expects the
[1:13:36] bride to make the word alive that's all
[1:13:41] I've ever said this bride is to make
[1:13:45] alive what that prophet brought it's not
[1:13:48] a humdrum sitting around going to church
[1:13:50] being good because you know what you do
[1:13:54] now argue with me you know what you'll
[1:13:57] do you'll go to church for a while and
[1:13:59] you'll be doing good and then all at
[1:14:01] once you'll just float away you
[1:14:04] backslide
[1:14:05] then you slide by hacking and then use
[1:14:08] backslide and president don't like that
[1:14:18] is it true
[1:14:26] is it true well I'm just guilty of
[1:14:31] exposing it in me and you both come on
[1:14:37] these issues what is the new birth
[1:14:42] it's the revelation because listen
[1:14:47] Church I've taught you from day one that
[1:14:49] after coming in this mess and I've seen
[1:14:51] it the new birth starts with you
[1:14:54] believing and ends when you leave the
[1:14:56] world right starts when yous beginning
[1:15:01] when you believe it then it ends when
[1:15:03] you leave the world and we just quoted a
[1:15:05] quote to start with that a message of
[1:15:07] cheer will be down through the endless
[1:15:09] ages after this world oh well so we just
[1:15:11] getting started let's don't deny the
[1:15:16] word do you believe Jesus Christ the
[1:15:22] same yesterday today and forever see if
[1:15:29] not then we're denying the work
[1:15:33] now come on gonna slap it down and yeah
[1:15:37] we're now brother down I believe that
[1:15:39] 4050 years ago when the Prophet was here
[1:15:41] oh you don't believe it now then so when
[1:15:46] did he stop being Hebrews 13:8 simple
[1:15:51] question let's see what do you agree
[1:15:54] with the word or denied I've talked from
[1:15:59] day one in this message that Jesus
[1:16:01] Christ is the same that he's ever been
[1:16:03] and I've seen him deliver with it if you
[1:16:10] think he's alright because did not know
[1:16:15] the new birth is a birth of the word
[1:16:23] did the prophets say it when we were
[1:16:25] that quote and want to go God laid the
[1:16:28] word down and the Holy Ghost quicken
[1:16:31] that word there is a new birth that's
[1:16:39] our new birth today as well as it was
[1:16:41] then if we're brother Dale I've never
[1:16:43] done I've never had a revelation it's
[1:16:45] something wrongly then something wrongly
[1:16:54] what about it
[1:16:56] a standing it flow through me
[1:17:05] [Music]
