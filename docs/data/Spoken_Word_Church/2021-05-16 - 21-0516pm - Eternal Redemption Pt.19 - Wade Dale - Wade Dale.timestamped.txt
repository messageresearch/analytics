[8:43] the house of the lord if you've got your
[8:44] bibles let's turn to hebrews 9
[8:48] and continue on our thought with the
[8:50] eternal redemption
[8:52] we'll get into a little thought maybe
[8:54] toward the end
[9:00] that we haven't discussed yet because
[9:01] we're heading we've got
[9:03] uh we got to talk about this man that
[9:05] the plan's hinged on them it's hinged on
[9:08] jesus christ
[9:09] amen it's not hinged on me and you we
[9:11] are a part of the plan
[9:13] but it's hinged on him getting us out of
[9:15] the problem we had
[9:18] and the plan is helping us to get out of
[9:20] that
[9:21] amen because we can't get out of it
[9:23] ourselves
[9:24] man has tried for years and years and
[9:26] thousands of years to save themselves
[9:27] and they can't do it
[9:29] all right so hebrews 9 remember these
[9:32] announcements and like i said thank you
[9:35] all again
[9:36] for going to you're doing your sunday
[9:37] school duty and everybody doing it in
[9:38] orderly fashion there was no disruption
[9:40] there was no
[9:42] um uh
[9:45] calamity it was all done really well and
[9:47] i appreciate that and all you uh uh
[9:50] sunday school teachers
[9:52] thank you so very much for what you do
[9:54] hebrews 9 verse 11
[9:57] let's pray dear heavenly father thank
[9:58] you for this day that you give us
[10:01] we pray now that you sanctify us for
[10:02] this journey that we're on lord

[10:07] and does the speaking

[10:10] father we pray that you'd be with the
[10:12] ones that are sick
[10:13] the ones that are not here today lord
[10:15] the ones that have ailments in their
[10:17] bodies we pray that you just touch them
[10:18] lord
[10:19] and heal them lord even as the word goes
[10:21] forth you said lord you sent your word

[10:46] said father just take care of us lead us
[10:47] in guide us by your holy spirit bless
[10:49] people the best brother bob lord on the
[10:51] way back home father for doing his duty
[10:53] there
[10:53] in occasional and one's lord that are
[10:55] out doing other things we pray that you
[10:57] just touch each one
[10:58] bless us in jesus name amen
[11:01] but christ being come a high priest of
[11:03] good things to come by a greater more
[11:05] perfect tabernacle not made with hands
[11:07] that is to say not of this building i've
[11:10] been reading in solomon about how they
[11:11] built that building man what a building
[11:13] they built god
[11:15] in the old testament there what a
[11:16] building they took them 30 years
[11:20] almost to build that building and to
[11:22] build a place for solomon to live
[11:24] and they and they didn't even have they
[11:27] it was
[11:28] so perfect until they had the plan
[11:31] laid out they knew that this rock needed
[11:33] to be 15 inches wide
[11:34] and somebody over there made it and had
[11:37] it shipped there
[11:38] it's kind of like a prefab that we have
[11:39] a prefab house now because the bible
[11:42] said no hammer and no saul was heard
[11:45] in the building of the temple no hammer
[11:47] no saw
[11:48] everything and you know what that's a
[11:49] testament that the word of god is right
[11:51] the word of god will fit together if
[11:54] you'll let it they don't have to be no
[11:55] bunch of noise a hammer and nails and
[11:57] all that stuff
[11:58] if you'll just let god he's already got
[12:00] the pieces the pieces are there for us
[12:02] to what just put it where it's supposed
[12:03] to go
[12:04] that's the thing put it where it's
[12:05] supposed to go neither by the blood of
[12:07] goats and calves but by his own blood he
[12:09] entered in once into the holy place
[12:11] having obtained eternal redemption for
[12:14] us you may be seated
[12:16] let's read first john 4
[12:20] and we have known and believed the love
[12:21] that god hath to us god is love
[12:24] he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god
[12:26] and god in him
[12:28] hereby is our love made perfect that we
[12:30] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[12:32] because he as he is
[12:33] or are we in the world i'm glad brother
[12:35] dale covered that about the
[12:37] judgment because it is confusing to the
[12:39] world it shouldn't be
[12:40] confusing to the bride that we don't
[12:42] stand the major judgment
[12:43] of anything we don't stand we're not in
[12:45] the major tribulation
[12:47] we're not major judgment but there are
[12:49] things if we don't get taken care of
[12:54] like the thing that i had with the
[12:55] brother that i said something about and
[12:57] i had to get it right if i only got that
[12:58] right i was going to meet that
[13:00] not at the day of judgment but at the
[13:03] reward ceremony
[13:05] remember brother branham had a reward
[13:06] ceremony remember
[13:08] they were giving him his reward and
[13:10] remember hope came up on this side and
[13:12] and and the media came up on this side
[13:15] and they went up the steps to get his
[13:16] reward
[13:17] and they told him he was a special
[13:19] person why because he gave his life
[13:22] to get me and you the gospel so there's
[13:24] there are
[13:25] there are levels and i don't understand
[13:27] because there's not a level of eternal
[13:28] life eternal is eternal
[13:30] but there is positions there and you say
[13:32] well i thought we all going to be one
[13:34] well we are going to be one but remember
[13:36] israel will never be the bride
[13:43] adam you got abraham you've got
[13:47] all eyes they are not won't be bright
[13:49] and never will be bright they have a
[13:50] position because i'll read it here
[13:53] that remember jehovah had to divorce
[13:57] his first bride right so she'll never
[14:00] carry that position again
[14:02] as the bride we're the bride we live in
[14:06] the city they can come in the city and
[14:07] go out of the city but the bible even
[14:09] tells us
[14:09] that the kings of the earth will bring
[14:12] their goods into the city
[14:14] and i like what brother claude said they
[14:16] bring their tithes in
[14:19] but there are kings so there must be a
[14:21] hierarchy and it must be some kind of
[14:22] it's not anarchy
[14:24] but there must be some kind of a
[14:26] government set up outside the temple
[14:28] or outside the new city and it won't be
[14:31] that
[14:32] well i'm better than you but it will be
[14:34] that you know you may have done better
[14:36] than me in a certain
[14:37] situation you've been done better than
[14:39] brother louise in a certain situation
[14:41] and you'll be known for that because i
[14:42] believe brother brown will always be
[14:44] known as the prophet of the end time
[14:45] he'll never lose that
[14:46] he'll never lose that title so that's
[14:49] the same way but now remember
[14:51] like what i was reading there in timothy
[14:54] if you don't get it confessed and get it
[14:55] out of the way brother michael was
[14:57] confessing just a few minutes ago he did
[14:58] had to do the same thing about somebody
[15:00] it makes you feel so good and so clean
[15:02] you never have to worry about that
[15:03] anymore so that doesn't have that will
[15:05] not be a
[15:06] a a crown taken away that'll be actually
[15:09] a crown
[15:09] given because you went an extra step to
[15:12] ask forgiveness but if not then that
[15:14] thing has to go with
[15:16] us right some sin some man sin go before
[15:19] some go after all right so if we send
[15:22] that sin and let it be covered by the
[15:23] blood
[15:24] and we take this love to where watch now
[15:29] see we get down to verse 20. if a man
[15:31] say i love god and hateth his brother
[15:33] he's a liar
[15:35] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[15:37] he also seen how can he love god whom we
[15:38] have not seen
[15:40] so there you go that's why brotherly
[15:42] love is way up there on that pyramid
[15:44] it's not down at the bottom
[15:46] because it's a character development
[15:47] that we all need to develop that we all
[15:49] need to have
[15:52] working in our life all right so let's
[15:54] read ephesians one according that
[15:56] has chosen us in him before the
[15:57] foundation of the world
[15:59] i sent her this morning i thought man as
[16:01] many times as brother dale brother
[16:02] louise brother bob and myself and
[16:03] brother aaron's read that scripture in
[16:05] the past two months they ought not be no
[16:06] questions
[16:08] we can almost quote it by heart because
[16:10] we've all used it in our sermon in some
[16:12] part
[16:13] in the past several months but you know
[16:16] what
[16:16] when god does that i think he's trying
[16:18] to tell us something
[16:21] according as he has chosen us in him
[16:23] before the foundation of the world
[16:24] that we should be holding without blame
[16:26] before him in love there's a position
[16:27] that we've got to come to
[16:29] that we should be holding without blame
[16:31] when you say my my
[16:32] listen god don't blame you the devil's
[16:34] the one that does the blaming
[16:36] okay so if we do go without blame we're
[16:39] listening to
[16:41] god and as john told us he said if you
[16:43] don't have the love of god you don't
[16:44] understand what the love of god is
[16:47] and you can't have the love of god you
[16:50] look at the world the world is trading
[16:52] agape love with what they think is agape
[16:55] love they're just
[16:56] it's just filial love and it'll only
[16:58] come to a certain spot and it will end
[17:00] same way with the people that send the
[17:01] message if they have true agape love
[17:03] you'll never leave the message of the
[17:05] hour
[17:06] you may have listen you might have
[17:08] questions you may have problems
[17:10] you may have situations where you don't
[17:12] understand things but you'll never
[17:14] ever in your soul say this is not right
[17:16] right
[17:18] because how can agape love contradict
[17:21] agape love
[17:23] but now filial love will always
[17:25] contradict agape love
[17:27] you can't trade them they can't be
[17:30] traded and you can't carry a
[17:32] filial love into another dimension but
[17:34] you can take agape love into any
[17:36] dimension you want to
[17:38] amen hey even agape love went to the
[17:41] fifth dimension but
[17:42] he didn't stay that long amen jesus went
[17:45] to
[17:46] went to hell that was agape love but see
[17:48] that was the love of god to even go to
[17:50] hell to tell them people
[17:52] i'm the one you turned down you made a
[17:55] choice
[17:56] to be where you're at and i can't do
[17:59] anything
[18:00] about it though i'm almighty god and i
[18:02] have
[18:03] the perfect love i can't take you out of
[18:05] that situation
[18:07] i was reading the other day brother
[18:08] brown said death doesn't change anything
[18:13] just your dwelling place if you're a
[18:16] sour here you're gonna be sour there if
[18:18] you're
[18:19] xyz you're gonna be xyz there it's not
[18:22] gonna and i think maybe sometimes the
[18:25] the denominational world and i don't
[18:27] even know maybe some of the people the
[18:28] message think that
[18:30] you know once they die and go over into
[18:32] another dimension that
[18:33] that that's going to better themselves
[18:37] no this is where you get better
[18:40] or this is where you get worse see
[18:42] that's the eternal plan of redemption
[18:44] that god had to come into this part of
[18:46] our world
[18:47] that was fallen that we knew we were
[18:50] going to die
[18:50] and listen we were spiritually dead he
[18:53] had to come into this dimension
[18:56] and bring agape level show me because
[18:58] listen brother brown said outside of the
[18:59] bride there'll be no love
[19:02] why because the bride will be the only
[19:04] one that has agape love and agape love
[19:07] is translated
[19:08] the new birth there is no agape love
[19:12] outside a new birth and there is no new
[19:14] birth outside of agape love
[19:17] now brother brown i read you that quote
[19:19] where brother brown said you love with
[19:20] your spirit
[19:22] but that's only filial love that's not
[19:25] agape love
[19:27] never can and never will be if it stays
[19:30] in your outside realm
[19:32] or your second realm of you you're lost
[19:34] on the inside
[19:36] agape love is not squishy ushy gushy
[19:40] greasy grace love agape love is
[19:43] corrective love it's
[19:45] love that god loves you and he wants to
[19:48] tell
[19:48] you he's already told you in the bible
[19:51] the problem is is we sometimes say well
[19:54] that's not
[19:55] god because it's too hard or that's not
[19:58] god because
[19:59] i don't think god would have me do that
[20:01] i was a girl
[20:02] a couple days ago talking about going to
[20:05] church and
[20:06] one of the guys at work asked the girl
[20:08] there said
[20:10] do you wear your jeans to church you
[20:12] know what they always say
[20:14] god knows my heart doesn't matter what i
[20:17] wear
[20:18] god knows my heart and i thought yep he
[20:21] does that's why you go to church with
[20:22] your pants on
[20:24] because god knows your heart but see let
[20:26] me tell you something
[20:27] unless that girl gets born again she's
[20:30] gonna have to meet god with that same
[20:32] attitude right
[20:33] that's right
[20:36] and he's going to say i know your heart
[20:38] because i and see
[20:40] they think but see that's what i'm
[20:41] saying is they think that negates what
[20:43] the word said
[20:45] but i love god so i'm going to go to
[20:48] church naked
[20:50] but i love god right right
[20:53] or i'm going to go do this and do that
[20:55] because
[20:57] listen the devil has sold this plan he
[20:59] has a plan too it's not a plan of
[21:01] redemption
[21:02] it's a plan of destruction and he wants
[21:04] to destroy this whole plan of redemption
[21:07] but listen if it's an eternal plan
[21:10] satan cannot get his greasy hands on an
[21:14] eternal plan
[21:16] because there's nothing about him
[21:17] eternal
[21:20] he can't make eternal he can't give
[21:22] eternal
[21:23] he has no eternal to get listen that's
[21:25] something you can do that the devil
[21:26] can't do you can give your eternal life
[21:28] away
[21:29] or you can connect somebody to your
[21:30] eternal life
[21:32] a cup of water in my name change my tire
[21:35] on the side of the road
[21:36] you can impart eternal life something
[21:38] satan cannot do
[21:40] he only imparts evil but see he uses
[21:44] filial love to make you think you've got
[21:45] a guppy love
[21:47] and that's what's happening in the
[21:48] message of the hour they just think it's
[21:50] shouting and speaking in tongues and
[21:52] and whooped you do and i felt that so it
[21:55] must be good
[21:57] okay it's okay so let's see how the life
[21:59] let's continue
[22:01] that's why god's let this thing go so
[22:03] long he's continued to allow us to go
[22:05] so long to where that what happened with
[22:08] a mixed multitude what happened with the
[22:09] ones that died in the wilderness they
[22:11] just kept
[22:12] going away going away whether it was
[22:15] only two original joshua and caleb was
[22:17] the only two listen moses was even gone
[22:20] there was just joshua and caleb and a
[22:22] group that had grown up
[22:24] that didn't know the first group of
[22:25] people
[22:27] and god has done that now he's raised up
[22:29] not a young as far as young age but a
[22:31] young group of people
[22:33] coming to the end time that's going to
[22:35] be able to go across that promised land
[22:37] and not only go across the promised land
[22:39] but to be positionally placed as we read
[22:41] this here because
[22:42] this is all look at verse 5 having
[22:46] predestinated us
[22:47] unto adoption not just to a child
[22:51] but to adoption to where you and i can
[22:54] speak
[22:54] and things will happen that's right
[22:58] i'm just telling you what god said to
[23:01] the praise of the glory of his grace
[23:02] when he hath
[23:03] made us accepted in the beloved
[23:07] in whom we have redemption through his
[23:08] blood the forgiveness of sins
[23:10] according to the riches of his grace
[23:11] when he hath the boundary toward us in
[23:13] all wisdom and prudence
[23:14] having made known unto us the brother
[23:16] devil saying this morning the mystery of
[23:17] his will what's the mystery of his will
[23:19] to adopt you to save you to make you a
[23:22] child of god that's the mystery
[23:24] you know listen don't you can't talk
[23:26] about adoption or growth development out
[23:28] in the
[23:29] in the denominational world and most of
[23:31] the message people don't think you have
[23:32] to have that what what do you mean i got
[23:34] to go
[23:34] i got everything when i believed
[23:38] you might have got a part but you just
[23:41] came into a place that you could get it
[23:45] see you can't get any of that see
[23:46] brother branham when he preached statue
[23:48] a perfect man
[23:49] he knew there was some because of filial
[23:51] love
[23:52] they could go up that statue of a
[23:53] perfect man and just be a human
[23:57] right that's what he said he said you
[23:58] can have some of these virtues without
[24:01] having the holy ghost
[24:02] but you can't have holy ghost temperance
[24:05] you can't have holy ghost patience
[24:07] without having the agape love to connect
[24:09] it to
[24:10] right now it just won't fit right
[24:13] but if you have agape love that's why
[24:16] the prophet of god my brother dale said
[24:18] many times and i agree
[24:20] that there's a lot of people in this
[24:22] message that does not have the new birth
[24:25] because they've never been taught right
[24:26] they've never been taught well
[24:28] and they're just sitting in a message
[24:29] church and dying because if you have
[24:31] agape love folks if you have agape love
[24:35] which is the new birth it will connect
[24:38] to brother brown said
[24:39] every word in the bible so every word in
[24:42] the bible
[24:42] says faith virtue knowledge temperatures
[24:45] godliness are required
[24:47] virtues and it takes a five-fold
[24:50] ministry apostles prophets pastors
[24:52] teachers and evangelists
[24:53] to bring you that only under agape love
[24:56] can you have that
[24:57] whole deal the whole plan
[25:01] is hands on you having the new birth and
[25:05] it hinged on you
[25:06] as as john says here believing something
[25:09] you hadn't even seen
[25:13] how can you says if a man say i love god
[25:15] and hate this is brother for he that
[25:16] loveth not his brother whom he in sin
[25:18] how can he love god who is not sinned
[25:20] right right we haven't seen god
[25:23] but we have now we have now through his
[25:27] word we know where to look for him at
[25:30] amen we know to look that we had a
[25:32] prophet that turned us
[25:34] literally turned us back to the faith of
[25:37] the fathers
[25:39] look that in the dispensation of the
[25:40] fullness of time he might gather
[25:42] together in one
[25:43] all things in christ listen there's not
[25:44] 10 brides
[25:46] there's not two brides there's one bride
[25:50] and we know who that is now because the
[25:52] methodists say
[25:54] we're bright the pentecost say
[25:58] we're bright the baptist says
[26:01] we're bright the people says always was
[26:04] eternal
[26:05] they say they're bright so who's bride
[26:09] you gotta know right right you gotta
[26:12] know whose bride
[26:13] but we gotta keep going on and on and on
[26:17] because look in whom also we have
[26:19] obtained an inheritance
[26:21] we literally obtained this we weren't
[26:23] born with it
[26:25] listen if you were born perfect
[26:29] why all the trouble what kind of
[26:31] testimony would you have
[26:35] really come on i told my kids they
[26:38] wanted to be famous i said just do
[26:39] everything your parents told you
[26:41] told you to do i said you'll be famous
[26:42] nobody's ever done it in the world
[26:48] they dab they say how can i be famous i
[26:49] said you'll be on oprah winfrey and all
[26:51] the mother shows
[26:52] if you can stand up and say without
[26:54] lying
[26:56] i did exactly what my parents told me to
[26:58] do
[26:59] they ain't a person on earth ever did
[27:04] that
[27:07] except one that's right right and he had
[27:11] a problem with his parents at one time
[27:13] jesus did of course you know that in him
[27:16] also we have obtained
[27:18] redemption or inherit an inheritance
[27:20] being predestinated according
[27:22] to the purpose of him that worketh all
[27:24] things after the council
[27:25] of his own will let's read this next
[27:27] quote tell me my brother tell me my
[27:28] sister
[27:29] when was the time that the sons of god
[27:31] was ever to be manifested outside of
[27:33] this time now now
[27:34] this is the prophet telling us only in
[27:36] the end time
[27:37] when will there ever time in history
[27:39] that to manifest the time to deliver
[27:41] all nature you see moses had a had an
[27:44] anointing
[27:46] to do what he was supposed to do but he
[27:47] didn't deliver on nature now all nature
[27:49] fell on
[27:50] egypt almost but we're talking about to
[27:52] bring this thing back
[27:53] every i was thinking this the other day
[27:55] everybody brought it back to a degree
[28:00] to upright everybody brought it to a
[28:02] degree and then they had to stop
[28:04] because they didn't have the fullness of
[28:05] the word and you know even baptist and
[28:08] methodists they brought it to a degree
[28:11] god was working through those
[28:12] denominations before they were
[28:14] denominations he was working with the
[28:16] word they had but what did they do they
[28:18] stopped
[28:20] god said don't stop keep moving they
[28:22] said no this is it right here
[28:24] once saved always saved don't have to
[28:26] worry about it no more
[28:28] let me just sprinkle you don't worry
[28:29] about it no more
[28:31] let me just speak in tongues don't worry
[28:32] about it no more you're born again we'll
[28:34] say
[28:35] god just said no i'm moving on that's
[28:37] why god had to bring us a prophet
[28:39] that he moved on in the astronaut age
[28:42] and to deliver all nature nature itself
[28:45] is groaning
[28:46] waiting for the time of manifestation
[28:47] now we know that's romans 8
[28:50] verse 14 through about 20 why before the
[28:53] atonement was made before the holy ghost
[28:54] was ever poured out
[28:56] in the old testament on down look there
[28:59] couldn't have been manifestations
[29:01] it had to wait till this time now all
[29:04] things have been brought coming shaping
[29:05] to a headstone
[29:06] to the manifestation of the sons of god
[29:08] coming back and the spirit of god coming
[29:10] into these men so perfectly until the
[29:12] ministry will be so close like christ
[29:15] till they'll join him and his church
[29:16] together now how in the world are we
[29:18] going to have a ministry like jesus
[29:20] christ
[29:20] if you have agape love you're on the
[29:23] road right there already
[29:25] but if you don't have agape love you you
[29:27] just had to love that
[29:28] the pharaoh had or or love that kaifas
[29:31] had or all the different ones like that
[29:32] they had a
[29:33] certain portion of love that they could
[29:35] love but you know what when the
[29:37] very epitome of agape love when the very
[29:40] headstone of love
[29:41] walked into their temple right they
[29:44] killed him
[29:46] they killed him called him beelzebub
[29:49] called him the prince of devils
[29:51] called him the worst of the worst wine
[29:53] bibber all he done was hung around
[29:54] prostitutes and centers
[29:58] and that was agape love sitting there
[30:00] the epitome not just the part of
[30:03] he was all of agape love everything he
[30:06] was
[30:06] what do you think how do you think peter
[30:08] patterned
[30:09] these virtues from from jesus christ
[30:13] that's where he got him from he didn't
[30:14] get them from nobody else
[30:16] he got them from jesus christ which was
[30:18] perfect love
[30:20] but we had a prophet that went over into
[30:22] another dimension called the sixth
[30:24] dimension
[30:25] and he saw that let's skip on to that if
[30:27] you don't mind brothers and go to number
[30:28] two
[30:29] we know about the dimensions now one two
[30:31] three four five and six we've been
[30:33] through them all
[30:34] we're going to kind of get away from
[30:35] that now and keep on continue going
[30:39] to uh
[30:42] perfect love just keep going
[30:47] keep going keep going keep going keep
[30:49] going keep going there you go
[30:51] all right he says look this is perfect
[30:53] love go down to the red
[30:55] or the yellow for y'all this is perfect
[30:57] love said isn't that what you spoke the
[30:59] holy spirit was i said yes
[31:01] and this is perfect love that's what he
[31:03] went across the curtain of time now
[31:04] watch him in hebrews chapter four number
[31:06] three
[31:07] quote says the first is perfect love
[31:09] that's god's love
[31:10] pure and unadulterated now see it's not
[31:12] greasy grace it's not sloppy
[31:14] sloppy love right
[31:18] this love has judgment behind it this
[31:22] love
[31:23] is a righteous judge listen
[31:27] god would that all would be saved all
[31:30] right
[31:31] see that's agape love that he would that
[31:33] all be saved but
[31:35] in order to be god and to be a righteous
[31:37] judge he had to allow you to make a
[31:39] choice
[31:40] whether you would accept that agape love
[31:42] or not and some will
[31:44] and some will not but we know one
[31:45] thing's for sure when brother brown went
[31:47] across that curtain of time that's all
[31:48] he saw
[31:51] you can say perfect love agape love same
[31:53] same thing
[31:54] that's all he saw he didn't run into
[31:56] somebody that didn't have it
[31:59] he didn't run into he didn't see of the
[32:01] millions of people he didn't see one
[32:03] that
[32:03] didn't have it no every one of them had
[32:05] it
[32:06] but listen they didn't receive it there
[32:10] they received it right here this is
[32:13] where you receive
[32:14] perfect love this is where you receive
[32:15] agape love
[32:17] i think a lot of people are waiting to
[32:18] get perfect over there
[32:20] and you you look you look at your
[32:22] denominational world you say oh well
[32:23] when i get over yonder
[32:26] well i hope they're over yonder ain't
[32:28] the over yonder that
[32:30] ain't a good over yonder you understand
[32:32] what i mean
[32:35] but that's what they've been taught
[32:39] and that's all that we can go by but
[32:41] we've been taught different
[32:43] you and i have been taught the correct
[32:45] way to receive agape love
[32:48] and what to do when that agape love
[32:49] comes
[32:51] amen all of you and as brother ryan was
[32:54] talking about this morning what happens
[32:56] you're born with a gift
[32:58] see elvis presley was born with a gift
[33:02] there's no doubt and there's a lot of
[33:05] other great entertainers and even
[33:07] you say comedian anybody that can can
[33:10] take a thought
[33:12] whether it be evil or good that can take
[33:14] a thought and make hold people's
[33:16] attention and make them laugh or make
[33:18] them cry
[33:19] they've got a gift there's a gift
[33:23] there but what you have to attach it to
[33:26] either the devil
[33:27] or to god right same way with with um
[33:31] what did he say about elvis presley sold
[33:33] his soul for a fleet of cadillacs
[33:35] well see he was telling us he was a
[33:37] pentecostal boy a good pentecostal boy
[33:40] when he was growing up
[33:41] but he took that anointing
[33:45] and what'd he do with it he turned it
[33:46] over to the devil for money
[33:50] but he could have turned it over to god
[33:53] and been probably one of the
[33:54] like billy graham and and oral roberts
[33:56] and some be some great something because
[33:57] he had such an anointing
[33:59] listen you read some of these people
[34:01] what kind of anointing they had what
[34:03] kind of presence they had when they
[34:04] walked into the room
[34:07] even other things that go on that they
[34:10] could
[34:11] make women do and make men do and make
[34:14] people do things that
[34:15] that's ungodly but what if they were to
[34:18] turn that and that's the same thing
[34:20] brother dale myself
[34:21] any good minister we're not trying to
[34:23] make you do something
[34:24] right but what we're doing is opening up
[34:27] a channel
[34:28] so that you can see what god's already
[34:30] said we're not bringing some kind of new
[34:32] thought
[34:34] you know there's not some res
[34:35] reservation in there
[34:37] no it's all been open right if you've
[34:40] read anything of the
[34:41] of the message of the hour you know the
[34:43] principles are like i said you know the
[34:45] essence of the message
[34:48] all the other things are the other
[34:50] peripherals it's already in the bible
[34:52] then it's like i said before the people
[34:53] leave the message they just throw
[34:54] they must throw the bible out because
[34:56] they start cutting their hair and
[34:57] smoking and drinking and
[34:59] that that was in the bible before
[35:01] william branham got here
[35:03] that was taught back in old pentecost
[35:07] so why not if you're going to go back to
[35:08] something go back to that
[35:10] that's right at least you might have a
[35:12] chance over there
[35:14] but you won't have no chance you just
[35:16] leave the greatest thing it ever was and
[35:17] you turn yourself out to nothing
[35:20] and it's happening all the time because
[35:22] look the next comes in filial love
[35:25] that's love that you have for your wife
[35:26] and your children the next drop after
[35:28] that is what
[35:29] lustful love the next is ungodly love
[35:32] and that's what you yield yourself to
[35:33] kids don't yield yourself to even
[35:35] playing music of the world
[35:37] if you can help it now concerts and
[35:39] things like that you have to do
[35:42] let's not be so dogmatic right you know
[35:47] huh scoop thank you josh school concerts
[35:50] i i
[35:50] there's a reason i had him school kind
[35:53] of school concerts
[35:55] but but that's really that's what i
[35:56] meant any kind of something that you're
[35:58] you know told to play beethoven's fifth
[36:01] symphony
[36:02] play it you're in school do the thing
[36:06] don't make it a rock and roll party
[36:07] that's gonna be one of the part that
[36:09] you're gonna have to
[36:09] deal with but use your talent for the
[36:12] glory of the lord because you know what
[36:13] you have an anointing
[36:15] you have an anointing just every one of
[36:17] these this this is just
[36:19] this is just instruments to use and to
[36:22] channel your anointing through
[36:24] i don't know why i guess i'm picking up
[36:26] on what brother dale talking this
[36:27] morning
[36:27] but it's a channel that you channel what
[36:30] you have already
[36:32] you take a piece of music or you take a
[36:35] scripture or you take
[36:36] the prophet's message and you weave
[36:39] together something
[36:40] that you try by the lord by the help of
[36:43] the lord
[36:44] that you you convey it to one person
[36:47] maybe today
[36:50] just one person is going to get this
[36:52] today
[36:53] but that person being a child of god
[36:56] god's not going to leave them hungry
[36:59] he's going to feed them whether the rest
[37:00] of you say well i'm full i got full for
[37:02] i got here it's like louise said you
[37:04] know sometimes we do we think
[37:05] well we don't heard all this about 20
[37:07] times no there's always a little
[37:09] something that you can get
[37:11] there's always god will never return
[37:14] void
[37:15] his word will never return void it will
[37:18] accomplish what it's set out to do
[37:20] the problem is is we quench the spirit
[37:22] of god
[37:24] by our attitude right that's right this
[37:27] is not part of the service but let's
[37:29] just continue down that road
[37:30] the next is ungodly love and just goes
[37:33] down until it's filth and keeps on
[37:34] perverting
[37:35] perverting and like brothers dale says
[37:37] listen you all got a gift everybody does
[37:40] of something but if you'll use it and
[37:43] stay in that gift it's like
[37:45] then brother brown said no if you got
[37:47] you know if you got an anointing of
[37:48] ephraim
[37:50] what are you doing over in manassas
[37:51] cornfield what are you doing over here
[37:53] you need to get into what hey listen
[37:56] this plan
[37:57] needs people this plan of redemption
[38:00] and you know what god saw you fit into
[38:03] that
[38:04] anointing you just got to figure out
[38:07] whether it's
[38:08] you or god
[38:11] listen if you're a born-again christian
[38:12] to help brother ryan with his question
[38:15] this morning
[38:15] if you're a born-again christian did i
[38:18] not say
[38:18] prayer was a vehicle to
[38:22] talk straight to god you don't have to
[38:24] go and you don't have to
[38:25] listen you don't have to find a mentor
[38:33] right you talk straight to god
[38:36] now listen god may choose to speak to
[38:39] you through brother dale
[38:42] but he's not the mediator amen we've got
[38:45] one mediator and that's jesus christ
[38:47] because
[38:48] he can't forgive your sins i can't
[38:49] forgive your sins but i can help you
[38:51] pray
[38:52] i can try to get you in a channel that's
[38:54] what a song leader does
[38:55] gets you in a channel so that god can
[38:58] talk to you
[38:59] see we think well now brother boyd's
[39:00] gonna get up and he's gonna sing three
[39:02] songs
[39:02] brother the way he's gonna come out and
[39:03] he's gonna preach and that's it
[39:06] no they're setting a stage in a channel
[39:08] so that god can talk straight to you
[39:11] through the ministry to me that's agape
[39:14] love and he'll not leave one of us
[39:18] not one of us he'll leave us behind will
[39:20] not leave us behind folks i promise you
[39:22] he will not you say well i don't
[39:24] understand i don't understand
[39:25] if you've got agape love somewhere god
[39:28] is
[39:28] obligated to put somebody in the pulpit
[39:32] you can understand
[39:33] right yes because he's not going to let
[39:37] why confuse your own kids right why
[39:40] would god confuse his own children
[39:43] the bible tells us why if your child
[39:45] asks for bread you give it a piece
[39:46] give it a stone he asked for meat you
[39:49] give it a scorpion
[39:50] what kind of daddy is that no he's a
[39:52] good dad
[39:54] he's a good dad let's continue on
[39:57] number four let's read the red except
[39:59] you have that perfect love you'll never
[40:01] be there because nothing could ever be
[40:02] there without it
[40:03] this is what we've been touching on i
[40:05] got a little head i'm sorry but your
[40:06] spirit would be out of place there
[40:08] you see when when elvis presley was
[40:12] probably
[40:12] in the anointing of the of the
[40:15] pentecostal realm
[40:16] man it was good because he had an
[40:18] anointing
[40:20] people would listen and they would
[40:21] respond to him but what did he do he got
[40:24] caught up in his self
[40:26] and he took on another spirit and it
[40:29] wasn't holy
[40:30] amen so that pushed him in another
[40:32] direction and that took him where he was
[40:34] at
[40:34] and brother brown said sent more people
[40:36] to hell than the bar joint bar joints
[40:39] at that day would send to hell he sent
[40:40] them to hell
[40:42] wow let's read number five brother
[40:44] dale's talking about gifts look where
[40:46] there is gifts
[40:47] they can be questioned but when there is
[40:50] love it is perfect that's right and if
[40:53] you had perfect love
[40:55] you'd have perfect gifts
[40:59] that's right so work first with love
[41:04] that brings fellowship and fellowship
[41:06] brings
[41:07] gifts amen because you don't want to
[41:11] have worthy knowledge you want to have
[41:12] knowledge of god you don't have
[41:13] just regular normal faith you want to
[41:15] have the faith of god these virtues are
[41:18] the virtues of god
[41:19] and it takes a perfect faith to have
[41:21] that
[41:22] look at number six christ is revealed in
[41:24] his own word
[41:26] it's that anointing now this is only in
[41:28] this age that layout of cna is naked
[41:30] blind miserable don't even know it
[41:32] it's that anointed anointed with the
[41:33] real spirit
[41:35] see that holy spirit can fall upon a man
[41:38] in his spirit
[41:40] but his soul is his german that germ is
[41:42] the word
[41:43] and how i don't care how much you can
[41:45] preach how well you do this and how much
[41:47] you love
[41:48] that's one of the inlets to spirit you
[41:50] can't love
[41:52] you can't love with your body you love
[41:55] with your spirit
[41:57] that's one of the endless and you can
[41:58] love and even love god
[42:00] and still not be right you can cast out
[42:03] devils and preach and do these things
[42:06] still not be right jesus said so said
[42:08] many would come in that day
[42:10] that word settles it in other words the
[42:12] word is the whole thing that we're
[42:14] looking at today we're going to read
[42:15] that in just a minute where god
[42:18] sent the word to us john 1 1 said in the
[42:21] beginning was the word
[42:22] where was with god and the word was god
[42:24] but let's read number seven
[42:26] this is a quote i quoted you wednesday
[42:28] night
[42:30] real genuine love will create a
[42:33] confidence
[42:35] in his word real genuine love will
[42:38] create a confidence
[42:40] in his word i love that now the next
[42:43] quote
[42:45] we'll get started here we're gonna we
[42:47] were looking at the chart
[42:49] where jesus comes into play because look
[42:52] david when we were talking about prayer
[42:54] this this morning
[42:56] david knew there was a messiah coming
[42:59] all the people in the old testament knew
[43:00] there was a messiah that was coming but
[43:02] they'd never seen him before
[43:04] they'd seen him in part through
[43:06] different prophets in the word and the
[43:07] different things that they brought
[43:09] but they knew it had to be blood that
[43:11] come in
[43:12] to bring this thing to pass so god had
[43:15] to create to bring blood into the world
[43:17] to offer that blood so god had to create
[43:20] himself
[43:21] a blood cell so he did that by what
[43:24] becoming
[43:25] a baby he became a baby behold
[43:28] isaiah 7 verse 14 says behold a virgin
[43:30] shall conceive and bear it's son
[43:32] and shall call his name emmanuel
[43:35] everybody in the old testament was
[43:36] looking toward that they were looking
[43:38] for something to come
[43:40] they were looking for the redeemer
[43:43] even job says i i know there's a problem
[43:45] here
[43:46] i know my redeemer liveth i know that i
[43:49] in the last day
[43:51] i'll stand on my in my own body and in
[43:54] my flesh
[43:56] i shall see god but they didn't see him
[43:58] in there but look
[43:59] matthew 1 verse 19 says jesus
[44:02] when he was born remember joseph had a
[44:05] dream
[44:06] because it was kind of hard for him to
[44:09] conceive that she had conceived but this
[44:11] child is conceived by the holy ghost and
[44:14] she shall bring forth a son now shall
[44:15] call his name jesus for he shall save
[44:17] his people now look
[44:18] save his people from their sins today
[44:20] we're going to cover that's what i've
[44:21] been trying to get to
[44:22] because remember he came to a group of
[44:24] people
[44:27] he didn't come to gentiles not at first
[44:32] because the whole old testament was what
[44:35] jews
[44:36] jews there's a spattering of gentiles
[44:39] every once in a while
[44:40] got put into that you saw brother brown
[44:42] this morning talked about rahab and all
[44:44] the different ones
[44:44] that there was a few gentiles but but
[44:47] jehovah had a bride
[44:49] that was jewish because that was his
[44:52] first people that was his chosen bride
[44:54] that was the ones he was going to work
[44:56] through
[44:57] but now remember god knows all things
[45:01] he knew what they would do and he knew
[45:05] he would want to get a gentile bride
[45:09] so he sent jesus
[45:13] and jesus stood up one day and said
[45:15] don't go to nobody
[45:16] but my people go to the lost sheep of
[45:20] the house of israel don't even go the
[45:21] gentile call them dogs
[45:24] but deep down inside of that man
[45:28] somewhere he knew that he was going to
[45:30] have a gentile bride because every time
[45:31] he would come up against a gentile the
[45:33] centurion
[45:34] the woman he called the dog and all the
[45:36] different ones he would get
[45:37] he said i've never seen faith like this
[45:40] in israel
[45:41] so he knew that the gentile bride would
[45:43] have more
[45:44] faith because what does israel have
[45:46] faith in signs touch me
[45:48] remember jarrius come and lay hands on
[45:50] her come and do this brother brown talks
[45:52] about it many times
[45:53] a jew you've got to have what signs
[45:55] that's why god's got to send two
[45:56] prophets
[45:58] to israel when we're out of here he's
[45:59] got to send them two prophets
[46:01] and they're going to do signs and wonder
[46:02] signs and wonder signs of wonder signs
[46:04] and wonders
[46:05] yeah because they're jewish
[46:08] they have to have that but we read yet
[46:11] wednesday
[46:11] isaiah 53 and i believe we should read
[46:13] it again
[46:14] who hath believed our report to whom his
[46:16] arm of the lord revealed
[46:18] for he shall grow up before him as a
[46:20] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[46:22] ground
[46:23] he hath no form or commonness and when
[46:25] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[46:26] we should desire him
[46:28] in other words he wanted an elvis
[46:29] presley he wasn't somebody that was
[46:31] that was easy to pick out in a crowd he
[46:33] kind of fit in
[46:35] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[46:38] of sorrows acquainted with grief
[46:40] we hit as it were our faces from him he
[46:42] was despised and we esteemed him not
[46:45] listen even the 12 well the 11 disciples
[46:48] that were with him
[46:49] they left him at calvary they did not
[46:51] really know what was going on they knew
[46:52] this man was different they knew it was
[46:54] special
[46:55] i know what peter said thou art the
[46:57] christ but i don't
[46:58] he said you heard that from my father
[47:00] right then he tell peter he said you
[47:02] heard that from my dad
[47:03] you didn't you didn't get that on
[47:05] yourself you heard that from my father
[47:07] he put that in your mouth to speak that
[47:10] because you don't understand who i am
[47:14] but when you interject agape love into
[47:18] that
[47:19] on the day of pentecost
[47:22] they understood right cause peter
[47:26] stood up and preached the sermon listen
[47:29] to this
[47:31] have y'all lost my y'all lost my quotes
[47:34] back there
[47:38] if you need to go back to wednesday
[47:39] night on number
[47:41] 18 if you need to surely he has borne
[47:44] our grief and carried our sorrows
[47:45] because this is basically what us
[47:46] preach wednesday night except for a few
[47:48] added
[47:50] few added um scriptures but he was
[47:53] wounded for our transgression he was
[47:54] bruised for our iniquities
[47:56] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[47:57] him with his stripes
[47:59] we are here we are healed and as i said
[48:01] before he was a lamb of god
[48:03] he was the sin bearer he was the one
[48:06] that was put on the altar he was the one
[48:07] that was beaten and bruised
[48:09] for your healing but healing is only
[48:11] temporary
[48:14] the bible says right here that he gave
[48:16] his soul a ransom
[48:18] so that he could see his seed and we're
[48:20] going to talk about because remember
[48:21] what happens in the bible
[48:23] in the parable of the sore of the seed
[48:25] who's the sore of the seed
[48:26] the son of man the son of man's the sore
[48:28] of the seed that was jesus christ in
[48:30] human flesh
[48:31] he was the sower of that seed
[48:34] as we all sheep have gone astray we have
[48:36] turned everyone to his own way and the
[48:38] lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us
[48:40] all he was oppressed and afflicted yet
[48:42] he opened not his mouth
[48:44] he didn't have a wonderful time here you
[48:46] know
[48:48] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[48:50] and as a sheep before her shears is dumb
[48:52] so he opened not his mouth
[48:54] he was taken from prison and from
[48:56] judgment and who shall declare
[48:58] his generation so who's going to declare
[49:01] his generation
[49:02] only people that are born again
[49:06] listen there's been generation upon
[49:07] generation upon generation upon
[49:09] generation
[49:10] but there's never been a generation that
[49:12] was born without sex
[49:14] right never never been a generation that
[49:18] didn't have some kind of an
[49:19] act or some kind of genealogy going one
[49:22] way or the other right
[49:23] so this the bible says who shall declare
[49:25] his generation
[49:27] because or for he was cut off out of the
[49:30] land of living
[49:30] listen isaiah caught down and said well
[49:32] this guy's going to die
[49:36] he's going to die and not have any
[49:37] children
[49:39] how is he going to be this person that's
[49:42] going to give
[49:42] eternal life to everybody well
[49:47] you're going to see it right here and he
[49:49] made his grave with the wicked with the
[49:51] rich in his death because he hath done
[49:52] no violence neither was any deceit in
[49:54] his mouth
[49:55] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he
[49:57] hath put him to grief
[49:59] when thou shalt make his soul an
[50:01] offering for sin
[50:02] he shall see his seed
[50:07] amen not a progeny from the earth or a
[50:09] progeny from
[50:10] from somebody doing something here on
[50:13] earth
[50:14] no it came from almighty god he shall
[50:16] see his seed he shall prolong his days
[50:19] and the pleasure of the lord shall
[50:20] prosper in his hand he shall see the
[50:23] travail of his soul
[50:25] listen his soul was what was in anguish
[50:27] on the on the cross
[50:30] his soul was what what his soul is what
[50:33] he was giving for your soul
[50:36] his soul is what was paying the price
[50:39] not the body the body paid for the
[50:41] healing part the body was the lamb
[50:44] but that and that listen that human body
[50:46] didn't come back on you
[50:48] that's right right
[50:52] and i'm not to say it didn't do any good
[50:54] but i'm telling you what i'm saying is
[50:55] the
[50:55] literal body of jesus doesn't make you
[50:58] eternal
[50:59] it's the soul the soul of jesus christ
[51:02] is what makes you eternal
[51:04] because he can he knows listen when he
[51:06] looked around he saw
[51:08] that genealogy that was produced by the
[51:10] garden
[51:11] by sex and he knew i believe in his
[51:14] in his mind he's like man these people
[51:16] are trapped
[51:18] there's nothing they can do this is a
[51:21] cycle they've got to be
[51:22] born by sex die go into whatever
[51:25] dimension
[51:28] but he knew that if he could give his
[51:30] life
[51:32] give his soul a ransom he would see a
[51:36] seed
[51:37] he shall see of the travail of his soul
[51:40] and shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[51:42] shall my righteous servant justify many
[51:44] for he shall bear their iniquities
[51:46] therefore will i divide him a portion
[51:48] with the great and he shall divide the
[51:50] spoil with the strong
[51:52] why because he has poured out his soul
[51:56] unto death you can't kill you can't kill
[51:59] a soul
[52:01] the one that can kill a soul is the one
[52:02] he's talking about
[52:04] you can't kill a soul soul's not there's
[52:06] not a soul died yet
[52:09] that's right they're somewhere they're
[52:12] in a slot they're in a dimension
[52:13] somewhere that
[52:14] they're they've got to wait till the day
[52:16] of judgment listen i
[52:18] just think about this other day even
[52:19] though god knows every person
[52:21] exactly what they're going to say at the
[52:23] judgment and exactly what's going to go
[52:25] on at judgment
[52:26] he's still going to let them present
[52:28] their case
[52:34] why would we have a white throne
[52:35] judgment if he wasn't going to let them
[52:37] give their case right because the bible
[52:40] tells us that many will come in that day
[52:43] and say have i not they're going to make
[52:46] a case have i not
[52:48] healed the sick have i not cast out
[52:50] devils he said depart from me i never
[52:52] had an agape love relationship with you
[52:56] and that's exactly what it is because he
[52:58] has poured out his soul
[53:00] unto death jesus was on the cross he
[53:01] said into thy hands i commend my spirit
[53:05] and that spirit went to hell and
[53:06] preached to the what the ones and the
[53:08] souls that
[53:09] were long suffering of the days of noah
[53:11] he knew me
[53:12] he knew they were going to they were
[53:13] going to die and reject him too but you
[53:14] know what
[53:15] he still had to go through the plan
[53:19] even though the plan of revelations 13 8
[53:22] says he was a lamb slain before the
[53:24] foundation of the world
[53:25] he had to come down here and die of the
[53:27] death
[53:28] you know who he has proven it to the
[53:30] devil
[53:33] he's proven all this to satan that hey
[53:35] i'm god
[53:36] you got them people into the problem
[53:38] they're in i'm going to get them out
[53:41] the ones that will believe me and satan
[53:43] says ah they're not gonna all believe
[53:44] you i'll just get all the ones i can
[53:47] and that's what he's trying to do he's
[53:48] trying to get as many as he can and
[53:50] round them up together and preach a
[53:52] sermon like he did i guess to the angels
[53:54] back before time
[53:57] that's his job so now let's go to john 1
[53:59] 1.
[54:03] the bible says in the beginning was the
[54:04] word the word was with god and the word
[54:07] was god
[54:09] the same was in the beginning with god
[54:13] all things were made by him
[54:16] i want to ask sometimes
[54:19] you know if jesus is the second person
[54:21] of the trinity to denominational people
[54:24] i want to ask for where he fit in in
[54:26] this creation because the bible tells us
[54:28] in many many places
[54:30] even somebody one of the disciples says
[54:32] you're the creator
[54:35] i want somebody to explain to me why did
[54:38] did the father just stand there and
[54:39] watch him do the creating or
[54:41] or you know what is this what's the deal
[54:44] here
[54:45] the bible says all things were made by
[54:47] him and without him was not anything
[54:50] made that was made
[54:52] in other words there's nothing in the
[54:53] world made that god didn't make
[54:57] there was a man sent from john noah in
[55:00] him was life and life was a lot of men
[55:02] and the light shineth in darkness and
[55:03] the darkness comprehended it not
[55:05] there was a man sent from god whose name
[55:06] was john the same came for a witness to
[55:09] bear witness
[55:10] of the light now remember john wasn't
[55:11] the light
[55:13] the prophet of god in the end time was
[55:15] not the light
[55:17] the light was we were pointed to the
[55:20] correct light
[55:22] listen satan is a god of light
[55:26] and i'm sure there's people pointing and
[55:27] saying well there there's god right
[55:28] there
[55:29] there's god right there there's god
[55:31] right there but
[55:32] john said behold glory the lamb of god
[55:36] that takes away the sin of the world
[55:38] this and there was no doubt
[55:40] especially in john's mind now we know a
[55:42] little bit later that john had a little
[55:43] bit of issue with that
[55:44] but listen he was dir directing a group
[55:47] of people
[55:48] to look at this man jesus you need to
[55:50] watch him
[55:52] that's the lamb of god to take away the
[55:53] sin of the world i don't know how is it
[55:55] all going to happen
[55:57] right he was not that light but he was
[56:01] sent to bear witness of that lightness
[56:03] what we had in the end time
[56:04] that was the true light which lighteth
[56:06] every man that cometh into the world
[56:08] he was in the world and the world was
[56:10] made by him and the world knew him not
[56:13] now listen this is one we'll bring right
[56:15] here he came unto his own
[56:18] and his own received him not jesus came
[56:21] to save
[56:22] the jewish people israel
[56:26] the lost sheep of the house of israel
[56:27] jesus came
[56:29] to give them an opportunity first
[56:32] because they were his first love but
[56:33] look but as many as received him
[56:35] to them gave he power to become the sons
[56:39] of god
[56:41] even to them that believe on his name
[56:44] which were born not of blood nor of the
[56:47] will of the flesh now he's not looking
[56:49] then
[56:50] to israel because listen all israel was
[56:53] born flesh
[56:55] there was no new birth in the old
[56:57] testament so there was no regening or
[56:59] regeneration
[57:01] it was natural genealogy
[57:05] but he said but which were born not of
[57:07] blood nor of the will of the flesh what
[57:09] carnally by sex nor of the will of man
[57:13] but of god
[57:14] so he's bringing a whole new generation
[57:16] in here that's
[57:18] we go back to isaiah who shall declare
[57:19] his generation well listen
[57:21] it started on the day of pentecost and
[57:22] it has not ended yet there's a
[57:23] generation
[57:24] declaration and every every time that
[57:27] god does something he's got them in
[57:29] seven church ages and in all of us right
[57:31] up to the end
[57:32] which were born not of blood and the
[57:34] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[57:37] and we beheld his glory the glory as of
[57:40] the only begotten of the father
[57:42] full of grace and truth now let's go to
[57:45] jeremiah
[57:47] now remember jesus came
[57:51] virgin born we know that he was born a
[57:55] man
[57:56] could perform as a as a man because he
[57:59] was ever with man
[58:00] but he sanctified himself because he did
[58:03] he knew one thing's for sure
[58:05] all this sex that was going on around
[58:07] him that was producing people
[58:09] was killing them right right
[58:13] so he knew he had he had to come up with
[58:15] a plan
[58:16] see there but it wasn't then he'd
[58:18] already done it before the foundation of
[58:19] the world
[58:20] to birth us by spiritual birth that's
[58:23] why he told the sower the seed was the
[58:25] son of man
[58:26] what is the seed it's the word what do
[58:29] you get you're getting
[58:30] you're getting regened
[58:33] by the word of god not buy something out
[58:37] there
[58:37] i can't have a different daddy seeing
[58:39] these first three dimensions you're
[58:41] locked into your gym
[58:42] natural genealogy sorry you just
[58:46] are there's a lot of you can pick your
[58:48] friends but you can't pick your family
[58:49] remember
[58:51] there's other things but there's one
[58:53] thing you can't pick you're born into
[58:54] this but you know what god knew that
[58:56] but see you have a choice whether it be
[58:59] get into this family of god or not
[59:02] you have a choice it's your choice to be
[59:04] follow me paul said
[59:06] in the regening or the regeneration
[59:10] follow me into the regeneration you've
[59:12] got to go
[59:13] somewhere to get regene and it's the
[59:16] word of god
[59:18] now watch this in jeremiah we know the
[59:20] jesus came a virgin he came to sow seed
[59:22] but look that seed that he sowed they
[59:25] never had him they never had
[59:27] jesus in the old testament
[59:31] i'm talking about savior of the old
[59:33] testament
[59:34] while the old testament we know he was
[59:35] coming under the old testament we know
[59:37] that right
[59:38] but he was the testator of the new
[59:41] testament
[59:43] because the new testament became sowing
[59:45] of spiritual seed not natural seed
[59:48] everybody got that because look it said
[59:50] in jeremiah 3 verse 6
[59:52] said the lord said also unto me in the
[59:54] day of josiah the king
[59:56] hast thou seen that which backsliding
[59:58] israel hath done
[59:59] she has gone up upon every high mountain
[1:00:01] and under evergreen tree and there has
[1:00:03] played the harlot
[1:00:05] and i said after she had done all these
[1:00:07] things turn thou unto me
[1:00:09] but she returned not and her treacherous
[1:00:12] sister judah saw it now watch
[1:00:14] and i saw when for all the causes where
[1:00:17] with backsliding israel committed
[1:00:19] adultery
[1:00:20] i had put her away and give her a bill
[1:00:22] of divorcement
[1:00:25] yet her treacherous sister judah feared
[1:00:26] not but went and played the harlot also
[1:00:28] so
[1:00:28] god divorced her in the old testament
[1:00:32] put her away because of her whoredom she
[1:00:35] went after other gods if you'll read in
[1:00:37] first and second kings and reading
[1:00:39] chronicles there'll be a king rise up
[1:00:41] and
[1:00:42] he'll destroy every grove except for the
[1:00:44] high grove
[1:00:46] josiah i think he was pretty much the
[1:00:48] only one that destroyed it all but then
[1:00:50] you'd have another king come up
[1:00:53] asa would come up king asa would come up
[1:00:56] and he'd
[1:00:56] destroy a certain amount but he wouldn't
[1:00:57] destroy all of it then this one would
[1:00:59] wouldn't destroy none
[1:01:00] he'd go right back to what he'd go right
[1:01:03] back to idols and balaam and
[1:01:05] and i just never could understand why
[1:01:07] there had to be a religion where you had
[1:01:09] to put your kids
[1:01:10] and sacrifice your children what was
[1:01:13] that moloch
[1:01:15] moloch that was what they done that was
[1:01:17] a religion
[1:01:18] you went to a place you went to a chapel
[1:01:19] and you put your kid up on the altar and
[1:01:21] you had them burnt
[1:01:22] for this god are we that serious about
[1:01:25] ours
[1:01:28] some of you more serious about sleep
[1:01:32] yet her treacherous sister judah fear
[1:01:34] not look at romans
[1:01:35] 11 25 and i'm gonna stop right there
[1:01:39] don't seem like we're getting anywhere
[1:01:40] and i guess the excitement's gone
[1:01:42] so maybe god will put you away
[1:01:50] romans 11 verse 25 let's see if they can
[1:01:52] find that
[1:01:55] and we'll read it because i want you to
[1:01:56] see this
[1:01:59] now remember jesus was the plan he was
[1:02:01] he wasn't part of the plan he was the
[1:02:02] plan
[1:02:04] of redemption and he knew that israel
[1:02:06] was going to fall
[1:02:08] that they would need redemption that he
[1:02:10] had to come in flesh
[1:02:12] but remember when he got here he done
[1:02:15] one thing to them and then took a
[1:02:17] gentile bride
[1:02:19] and he did this just for me and you so
[1:02:21] romans 11 verse 25 says for i would not
[1:02:24] brethren
[1:02:24] that you should be ignorant of this
[1:02:26] mystery
[1:02:27] lest you should be wise in your own
[1:02:30] conceits
[1:02:31] that blindness in part
[1:02:34] is happened to israel until the fullness
[1:02:38] of the gentiles be come in
[1:02:40] and so all israel shall be saved listen
[1:02:43] it's not that he's
[1:02:44] choked israel out on the side of the
[1:02:45] road he's going to save her but she's
[1:02:47] not
[1:02:48] she did what we were talking about a few
[1:02:49] minutes ago she lost a position
[1:02:52] by the way she acted you and i could
[1:02:54] lose a position
[1:02:55] by the way we acted or the way we act
[1:02:58] we could lose a position because israel
[1:03:01] lost a position
[1:03:03] that jesus at one time said don't go
[1:03:04] anywhere but the lost sheep of the house
[1:03:06] of israel
[1:03:07] and he came to his own but we know his
[1:03:09] own received him not but he kept going
[1:03:10] to the
[1:03:11] jews and going to the jews and going to
[1:03:13] the jews but he finally knew one thing
[1:03:15] right here in romans 11 verse 25
[1:03:18] you say jesus knew well he was talking
[1:03:20] through paul
[1:03:22] the holy ghost was talking through paul
[1:03:24] right
[1:03:25] said that blindness in part has happened
[1:03:27] to israel until the fullness of the
[1:03:29] gentiles
[1:03:30] be come in and so all israel shall be
[1:03:32] saved added
[1:03:33] as it is written there shall come out of
[1:03:35] zion the deliverance shall turn away
[1:03:37] ungodliness from jacob
[1:03:39] for this is my covenant unto them
[1:03:43] he made a covenant with them i can't
[1:03:45] forget israel how can i forget israel he
[1:03:48] can't forget those people
[1:03:49] listen there were some mighty prophets
[1:03:51] how are you going to do away with isaiah
[1:03:52] jeremiah
[1:03:53] abraham you can't do away with them and
[1:03:56] even listen
[1:03:57] those are just people that's in the
[1:03:58] bible there are some mighty people in
[1:04:00] the bible look at
[1:04:01] look at hebrews 11. barack and all the
[1:04:04] different ones and even the prophets
[1:04:05] the little minor prophets there wasn't
[1:04:07] much spoken but boy they come in they
[1:04:09] bring a message
[1:04:10] and boom it would be something for
[1:04:11] israel well they'd either turn him down
[1:04:13] or they'd do what he said most suddenly
[1:04:14] turn them down
[1:04:16] there shall come out of zion the
[1:04:17] deliverer and shall turn away
[1:04:18] ungodliness from jacob
[1:04:20] for this is my covenant unto them when i
[1:04:24] shall take away their sins now how is he
[1:04:25] going to take away their sins
[1:04:27] go back to isaiah 53 he's got to give
[1:04:29] his soul
[1:04:30] he didn't just give his soul the ransom
[1:04:32] for me and you
[1:04:34] he gave a soul ransom for israel and for
[1:04:38] us to bring everybody in so that they'll
[1:04:41] be able to live
[1:04:43] and be given eternal life but see that
[1:04:46] very soul
[1:04:48] couldn't come back into those believers
[1:04:50] but that very soul is in me and you
[1:04:52] today if you've got the new birth
[1:04:54] that very soul that he gave a ransom
[1:04:57] that's why sometimes when you tell
[1:04:59] people look you've already been to hell
[1:05:00] you don't have to go
[1:05:01] i really believe that now me as a person
[1:05:03] i wasn't down there
[1:05:05] standing beside jesus no i was inside of
[1:05:08] his genetic makeup
[1:05:09] because that wasn't a body that came
[1:05:11] down there to hell
[1:05:12] it was his soul it was a king theophany
[1:05:15] it was the one that's
[1:05:16] genesis 1 26 it was part of that genesis
[1:05:19] 1 26
[1:05:20] it was the genesis 1 26 man amen
[1:05:23] and you're part of that so you've
[1:05:25] already been to hell
[1:05:27] how do you think one more time how do
[1:05:29] you think we can understand a word like
[1:05:30] we do and not have the new birth
[1:05:32] the same person that wrote it is looking
[1:05:34] through your eyes
[1:05:38] but this plan had to bring a group of
[1:05:40] people called israelites or jews
[1:05:43] because they were his first love they
[1:05:46] were his first
[1:05:47] ones that he fell in love with knowing
[1:05:50] they were going to absolutely kill every
[1:05:52] prophet he sent
[1:05:53] and turn him down and that he was going
[1:05:56] to have to
[1:05:57] listen he literally blinded them
[1:06:01] because think of how religious they were
[1:06:04] though
[1:06:05] take isaiah and jeremiah and all those
[1:06:07] different ones that by a prophetic
[1:06:09] utterance
[1:06:10] they could see not maybe jesus christ
[1:06:12] standing like we see him
[1:06:14] but they knew there was something coming
[1:06:17] they just couldn't put their finger on
[1:06:19] it there was something coming because
[1:06:21] even paul said i see through a glass
[1:06:22] darkly
[1:06:24] i don't see all things amen
[1:06:27] but he literally had to put his hand
[1:06:30] over israel's eye
[1:06:33] and blinded them for me and you
[1:06:36] that was part of the plan though but he
[1:06:38] said i won't forget them for this is my
[1:06:40] covenant unto them when i shall take
[1:06:42] away their
[1:06:43] sins as concerning the gospel
[1:06:46] they are enemies for your sake
[1:06:50] let me read that again as concerning the
[1:06:52] gospel
[1:06:53] they are enemies
[1:06:57] for your sake he's talking to gentiles
[1:07:01] he's talking to a gentile bride but as
[1:07:03] touching the election
[1:07:05] they are beloved for the father's sake
[1:07:08] so you're not kicking israel out
[1:07:09] that's right they're enemies for your
[1:07:13] sake
[1:07:14] to bring you in and then god's going to
[1:07:15] do what he's going to israel
[1:07:18] they are beloved for the father's sake
[1:07:20] listen to this for the gifts and calling
[1:07:22] well somebody used to read somebody read
[1:07:23] that not too long ago
[1:07:25] right that's part of what brother dale's
[1:07:27] been reading
[1:07:29] because gift and calling gifts and
[1:07:31] callings are without repentance
[1:07:33] that's right but as concerning the
[1:07:35] gospel
[1:07:37] they are enemies for your sake just to
[1:07:40] get you in he
[1:07:41] literally blind listen because they're
[1:07:43] not listen how many
[1:07:44] how many years have we been
[1:07:48] since the day of pentecost which was 80
[1:07:50] 30 to this day that we're at today
[1:07:52] we're still trying to understand one god
[1:07:59] i mean we understand it more than
[1:08:00] anybody ever has but it's been all
[1:08:02] convoluted down through the ages
[1:08:03] but listen israel had it right to start
[1:08:06] with
[1:08:08] that's why when when uh the two prophets
[1:08:12] go to israel and they appear and start
[1:08:14] preaching one god that's what we're
[1:08:15] going to get into
[1:08:16] next sunday is where he says where do
[1:08:18] you get those scars
[1:08:20] he said in the house of my friends
[1:08:22] they're going to preach jesus christ
[1:08:24] so real till that blindness is going to
[1:08:26] be pulled off their eyes
[1:08:28] and they're going to say man we missed
[1:08:30] it that's right
[1:08:31] he was right there among us and we
[1:08:33] missed him
[1:08:36] let's not do the same thing let's stand
[1:08:39] our feet let's don't do the same thing
[1:08:42] let's don't miss it because listen
[1:08:45] god will not blind gentiles
[1:08:49] like he blinded israel because the
[1:08:52] fullness
[1:08:53] the bible says the fullness of time has
[1:08:54] come
[1:08:56] in in ephesians the fullness of time is
[1:08:58] our time
[1:08:59] that's right we can't plead ignorance
[1:09:02] that oh no no god blinded my eyes no
[1:09:05] no you blind yourself you put your own
[1:09:08] hand and you know what you have no
[1:09:09] covering for that
[1:09:10] but see if god does something he said i
[1:09:12] blinded you
[1:09:14] so i could get the gentile bride but i'm
[1:09:16] not going to leave you
[1:09:17] i made a covenant with you i still love
[1:09:20] you
[1:09:21] you didn't get agape love like the like
[1:09:23] the gentiles did but i'm fixing to give
[1:09:25] it to you
[1:09:27] amen so he gives them the agape love
[1:09:30] let's
[1:09:30] musicians come because listen
[1:09:34] like like i said before the only thing
[1:09:36] that's going to be in heaven is agape
[1:09:38] love
[1:09:39] there's not going to be any filial love
[1:09:40] that's why brother bryan said all the
[1:09:42] things sex glands all the
[1:09:43] hugging and all that won't be any
[1:09:45] problem won't be any problem shouting
[1:09:46] and rejoicing and praising the lord
[1:09:48] because there won't be any what
[1:09:49] carnality there won't be a carnal mind
[1:09:51] listen what goes into that other
[1:09:53] dimension didn't come from your mama or
[1:09:55] your daddy
[1:09:56] that's right that shell came from your
[1:09:59] mama and daddy so you can make a choice
[1:10:02] amen pretty simple but i love this
[1:10:06] eternal plan of redemption
[1:10:08] because it includes everybody even the
[1:10:11] lost
[1:10:12] but it includes everybody you can either
[1:10:15] decide to be redeemed or decide to be
[1:10:17] unredeemed
[1:10:20] because only the bride can be redeemed
[1:10:22] the others can never be redeemed because
[1:10:24] they'll never come to a place to where
[1:10:26] they
[1:10:26] see what you and i see let's sing a song
[1:10:29] god bless your heart
[1:10:31] remember all these things that we've
[1:10:33] that we've announced
[1:10:35] coming up brother aaron will be speaking
[1:10:36] for us sunday and then
[1:10:38] i mean the wednesday and then next
[1:10:39] sunday we'll have our regular sunday
[1:10:41] school like we have before
[1:10:42] so let's sing a song god bless you page
[1:10:45] 3 14.
[1:10:46] that's just his way
[1:10:51] of telling me
[1:10:54] he loves me
[1:11:00] it's a love beyond
[1:11:03] all human understanding
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:24] that's right of telling me
[1:11:28] he loves me first verse
[1:11:32] he he lets me
[1:11:36] walk down roads of disappoint
[1:11:44] now oh he watches
[1:11:47] and he knows what's best for
[1:11:52] me
[1:11:56] all the more i've tried the better he
[1:12:02] can mold me
[1:12:08] change my life completely
[1:12:12] that it will fit his perfect will
[1:12:19] well that's just his way
[1:12:24] of telling me
[1:12:27] he loves me
[1:12:31] it's love beyonce beyond
[1:12:36] [Music]
[1:12:43] and i won't question
[1:12:50] bring me to my knees
[1:13:08] [Music]
[1:13:12] should be that way
[1:13:17] he'll give me strength to climb the
[1:13:21] highest history
[1:13:27] my greatest strength comes
[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:13:38] and my greatest joy
[1:13:41] is knowing that he can fully
[1:13:46] trust in me
[1:13:50] well that's just his way
[1:13:54] of telling me he loves me
[1:14:02] it's a love beyond
[1:14:05] all human understanding
[1:14:15] [Music]
[1:14:25] that's right
[1:14:30] he loves me
[1:14:33] listen there's something that god has
[1:14:35] for each and every one of us
[1:14:37] you gotta find it he's not gonna come to
[1:14:40] your door
[1:14:42] and just lay it out
[1:14:46] you gotta fight your way through this
[1:14:48] you gotta struggle
[1:14:51] but just remember one thing
[1:14:54] what the world calls wonderful we should
[1:14:57] call
[1:15:00] filth but what we call wonderful they
[1:15:06] kind of shake their head out but we're
[1:15:08] looking at an eternal plan they're
[1:15:10] looking at something uh
[1:15:11] look the other day you know you you read
[1:15:14] some of the stuff online and it tells
[1:15:16] you how
[1:15:16] you know this is going to happen and
[1:15:17] that's going to happen and this is going
[1:15:19] to happen then that's going to happen
[1:15:20] that don't worry me they shouldn't worry
[1:15:24] you
[1:15:25] because god said he'd take care of us
[1:15:28] amen
[1:15:30] so let's just believe be prayerful
[1:15:33] watch
[1:15:36] and remember we're sheep
[1:15:41] we have to be led we have to be told
[1:15:45] we have to be led
[1:15:49] and god is leading us to the right
[1:15:52] pastor he led us to the right pasture
[1:15:56] door now we're going to be led to the
[1:15:58] right pasture
[1:15:59] because that's where the green grass is
[1:16:01] at when we eat amen
[1:16:03] listen settle yourself down
[1:16:05] [Music]
[1:16:08] and realize that you're in the right
[1:16:09] place and i don't mean i'm not saying
[1:16:11] this physical place
[1:16:12] you got to decide whether you're in the
[1:16:14] right place or not
[1:16:16] and if you believe the bible says if you
[1:16:18] believe
[1:16:20] then stand brother donnie read that this
[1:16:23] morning i believe it was
[1:16:25] if you believe you've done all stand
[1:16:28] right where you're at
[1:16:29] brother brown said if you've done
[1:16:30] everything you know to do stand around
[1:16:31] where you at but listen
[1:16:32] clear all that junk out of the way
[1:16:36] clear everything out don't have one
[1:16:39] thing
[1:16:41] i was telling them this morning
[1:16:45] when i'm standing here when somebody's
[1:16:46] being prayed for
[1:16:48] i really don't pray a prayer of healing
[1:16:51] or whatever they need
[1:16:52] you say that's kind of strange no
[1:16:54] brother branham said
[1:16:56] you can cause someone not to get their
[1:17:00] healing
[1:17:02] you know what he said you can call
[1:17:04] somebody by your unconfessed sins
[1:17:07] and your what you're thinking in your
[1:17:09] mind
[1:17:11] so you see me standing here and somebody
[1:17:12] comes to get prayed for i'm really not
[1:17:14] praying for that person because that
[1:17:16] person has come to a place that they
[1:17:17] want to pray
[1:17:18] with the person standing up here now
[1:17:20] sure pray that's okay
[1:17:22] but you better make sure god forgive me
[1:17:26] of my sins
[1:17:27] forgive me of my thoughts and let this
[1:17:31] brother and sister
[1:17:33] have what they need but don't let it be
[1:17:36] there's that sin that may be carried
[1:17:38] forward
[1:17:39] because you're back there playing on
[1:17:40] your phone are you back there doing
[1:17:41] thinking other thoughts or you want to
[1:17:42] get out of here and you want to leave
[1:17:44] and this person's they've got three or
[1:17:46] four in the line and i'm worried
[1:17:48] where they're really wanting to go home
[1:17:49] well if you cause any of those people
[1:17:51] to not get their healing that's on you
[1:17:54] not them
[1:17:55] not on the pastor not on the person
[1:17:57] praying that's on you
[1:17:59] so i just hold my hand up i say god
[1:18:01] clear me of everything
[1:18:03] that that person can get their healing
[1:18:06] now see that's the way you approach god
[1:18:08] yes see that is his way because we're
[1:18:11] going to talk about it next week
[1:18:12] when you pray believe boy that's hard no
[1:18:16] it's real simple
[1:18:18] if i'm going to take my time and pray
[1:18:20] i'm going to believe what i'm praying
[1:18:22] for
[1:18:23] and who i'm praying to how many times
[1:18:26] brother dale told us when somebody's
[1:18:27] preaching
[1:18:28] the word of god's coming forth and you
[1:18:30] get an unction that that ain't nothing
[1:18:32] but the truth like hattie said
[1:18:34] you need to raise your hand and say god
[1:18:35] my children or god my healing or god my
[1:18:38] this
[1:18:38] because god is close when he brings a
[1:18:41] revelation
[1:18:42] he's right here he didn't send a second
[1:18:45] person or a third person
[1:18:47] and he don't send an angel listen he
[1:18:50] never sent an angel to william branham
[1:18:52] to give him a revelation
[1:18:57] either god came himself and talked to
[1:18:59] him
[1:19:00] or the angel said now william branham
[1:19:02] have you ever read over here in
[1:19:03] deuteronomy
[1:19:05] remember what he said he said the angel
[1:19:07] would give me scriptures he said i'd
[1:19:08] spend
[1:19:08] all day searching the scriptures
[1:19:13] well
[1:19:17] when there's a revelation comes it's
[1:19:20] fresh
[1:19:22] and whether you get that revelation or
[1:19:23] not
[1:19:25] god's closer than he
[1:19:28] he'll be if you're sitting somewhere
[1:19:30] else you say well no no listen
[1:19:32] the way the song is that's just his way
[1:19:34] that's his way of doing things
[1:19:36] why would a why would god say hey if you
[1:19:39] get in trouble
[1:19:40] [Music]
[1:19:42] find the temple and the bible even says
[1:19:45] if
[1:19:46] even if you're in another country
[1:19:49] if you'll find the way and i bet you
[1:19:52] i'll promise you
[1:19:53] every one of those people that believe
[1:19:55] that
[1:19:56] knew the direction that temple was in
[1:19:59] and when they turned to the direction of
[1:20:01] that temple they were doing they were
[1:20:03] holding god to his word
[1:20:06] that god was obligated to get them out
[1:20:08] of trouble because he said i will get
[1:20:10] you out of trouble
[1:20:11] if you will look toward the temple and
[1:20:13] pray
[1:20:15] so there's jonah floating around in
[1:20:19] whale guts
[1:20:20] and i believe he did this one time
[1:20:22] [Music]
[1:20:23] and got about right here and he said
[1:20:25] there's the temple
[1:20:27] lord it's dark down here and it stinks
[1:20:29] get me out of this and god had to honor
[1:20:32] that
[1:20:34] and god spat him out right where he was
[1:20:36] supposed to been
[1:20:38] not somewhere else he spat him out on
[1:20:41] the
[1:20:41] on the very shore of wherever he was
[1:20:45] supposed to be in the first
[1:20:46] time so god's going to have his way but
[1:20:48] if you'll turn
[1:20:49] we don't have to turn and find a temple
[1:20:51] you are the temple
[1:20:53] so you say god you've sent us a prophet
[1:20:56] you've sent us good preachers
[1:20:57] you've sent us good elders you've sent
[1:20:59] us good deacons and all different ones
[1:21:00] but god you're right here
[1:21:03] clear myself out of anything that'll
[1:21:07] keep
[1:21:07] even in here
[1:21:12] brother brown said one unconfessed sin
[1:21:14] can make the church
[1:21:15] bitterly fail not just fail bitterly
[1:21:17] fail
[1:21:18] maybe that's why we're not moving on but
[1:21:20] you know what confession is good for the
[1:21:22] soul and your brother michael
[1:21:24] it's good for you i enjoyed it it makes
[1:21:27] you feel so much better to just get it
[1:21:29] out
[1:21:31] and it don't hurt
[1:21:35] if it hurts your feelings you really
[1:21:36] didn't
[1:21:39] you really didn't ask forgiveness right
[1:21:40] if it hurts your feelings
[1:21:42] right because you're saying i really
[1:21:45] meant what i said but i'm just going to
[1:21:46] do this for
[1:21:47] no you better not clean it out brotherly
[1:21:50] kindness is loving those that hate you
