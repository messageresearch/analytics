bless them on the way back home give everybody a safe journey let your love in your grace be with each your never one of us we love you and we thank you and we commit it to you now in Jesus name Amen we've been reading from Jonah bringing a point of salvation alright but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will play that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord now that's the main point the reason we're using it and the Lord spoken to the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land all right he was delivered because that's what salvation means deliverance in all of the ways and using it okay we go to now we're not gonna get as much into but we're gonna we want to read this because it tells you the Old Testament way of what it is and see and then you you say well I can't find this back here well it'll come over in the New Testament and pick up and read and you go back okay so keep that thought in mind and and it'll it'll help you alright verse one I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law in the service of God and the promises now that was all to Israel all right now okay the worthies alike to whom this pertains the adoption time whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed forever amen not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for this is the word of promise at this time when I come and Sarah shall have a son you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading brother Aaron may have to come and click the arrow on us a little you know I tried to run it this morning and get it and did do the fan on but we may have to have a little more than just a fan because this you know stuff you all right now as I said people are saying over and over we're talking about the word salvation salvation means deliverance all right so that we're not dealing with the new birth yet the born-again experience in the point of salvation we haven't gotten to that we're trying to go real slow to show you all the things of the Old Testament are types and shadows coming to the New Testament you know and and things taking place and I hope that you've listened to the point of what we've been saying and trying to bring out an example or a lineup to work that it would just go this way this way this way this way and then comes out to Christ so we read over you know today and pick it up in Romans that we'll get back to it a little bit in there thank you very in the services and just pray that my voice will hold out because that's been I've been coughing and having a problems with it but it'll be there all right but now we've been talking about the point of trying to bring out as I said what that happens the Bible says that the Old Testament was types and shadows right of the thing to come okay all right now if you watch what we were talking about in your order of events you may have to listen to many messages to find this lineup but the lineup I've been using is the basis that when Adam failed Adam first off was God's example child of what he wanted you know to to to be and all of us would have come that away had a fall not taking place all right but then the fall came into being and when it came into being God could not bring forth his children you know the way he wanted to so he had to revert to another way but did he's going to have his wheel that's gonna work out for his honor and glory everything will have to come to that part of it all right we see that Adam in his rebellion and the things through even Adam and the natural acts the took place there in the garden that it brought man as we talked about to a fall all right fallen condition okay now there was no sin there was no problems no nothing until man come into that situation - were the Adam as we talked about it and trying to bring it into the messages that Adam literally lost the right to the earth because the earth wasn't eternal Adams body was not eternal his soul was eternal but his body wasn't alright but then he lost the right of the earth okay now you said what is that related to us was you listening when we were trying to talk about that in losing the right of the earth that he literally lost our bodies because our bodies were laying in this earth right if not where to come from I mean it you know it's plain language but our bodies were in the earth and when Adam lost that he lost not only his Park that were he would have come to eternal life in flesh had he held on and then we were going to come into being had to seeing that happen but he lost it and when he did he made it to the basis that the world the Prophet said was cursed remember he didn't curse at him he didn't curse Eve he cursed the beasts put him on his belly he cursed the earth and thorns and thistles would come forth and as it would come forth it would be a horrible situation and you realize then our bodies was dire alright i've inside that over and over to you to think about our bodies were laying there in the earth in the elements alright and you said what I didn't I wasn't born from over there I was going to see you get stuff like that in your mind and you're not even listening spiritually so I'm glad the Prophet said it he said not necessary this I'm chemical you know the same gases excuse me but to simon chemicals alright sixteen elements you no matter where they come from and how long it took you to get here you realize our bodies didn't been in that for six thousand years and we think we're old now okay but the point we brought was what that God didn't leave it in that situation because in the genesis 3:15 remember he says to Adam and Eve but the seed of the woman is going to come to take away these problems that you've created and the seed of the woman was the promise of Jesus Christ because the woman has no seed all right but it was the promise of Christ in other words I will come and I'll make a way and he did come down personally you know God came personally stripped the animals put the skins upon them and everything to make it to where he would pay the price speaking of the coming of the great Messiah all right now what I tried to get you to look at is to look at the Bible as like you're not just looking at it as you read it as a textbook or a thought but to look how this is in order this is in order this is it why would God do this why would he do this why would he do this you know why would he have the world in such a horrible condition and then he'd send a flood any cleanse and climbed the earth through the flood you realized that according to what it is a future home brother Branham says then your body's worth in the earth so then you were claimed Roth IRA the body you're living in today was claimed right dark alright blood dropped on it at Calvary bringing it further on alright but remember you know they could come under justification wiping off sweeping it away God wouldn't put it all into one thing is my point but if you'd look at it look at the fall look at as this goes down all right looks like no hopes but then you see it as it starts an upward turn raise your Bibles that way sometimes I asked you to read Genesis I mean you know I'm gonna ask for a raise of hands I mean he's done it but I ask you to read these things and see what takes place I tried to emphasize the point see that when you come to the flood with Noah he had a purpose we get the art we get two things and all like that but he cleanse and claims the earth he starts a process of salvation Redemption to bring back all right now he cleanse and claims it he brings it to a situation and said I will not destroy the world anymore because of mankind then in Genesis 9 and he starts talking about not only the land I hope you followed the point that we was trying to brain watch it pick up a little bit land world people world cleanse cleansed all wiped out doing great the guard just didn't come back and say ok now Noah we're gonna give you the earth no we're gonna give you the Abraham we're gonna give you that was true it happened but that was not his point he's moving on so he moved on in Jonah I mean in in Genesis 9 about 7 & 8 he said multiply and replenish the earth all right now then he starts talking to Noah about his seed nobody's seed he starts showing the plans coming back who that genesis 3:15 man is the seat of Almighty God right let's either the woman cuz she don't know see then he starts a promise not just just to find the world cuz that would deal in cleansing of the body but he starts talking about his seed he deals with Noah and his seed all right and as he deals with him about that he starts putting it into to higher order he starts bringing it more back toward not just the world now you picked up something and was he listening he picked up a seed to start talking about first it was just the world we couldn't we got into Abraham you remember it was land that he dealt with first promise of land but then he said now you're saved see showing you that it's coming back to a Redemption not only for the earth but for the genesis 3:15 man to come into being to bring us salvation of a seed that's what gets me you get all of these great message people and I'm sorry but they preach about all these seeds and you get it all in that light that was great message about that seed that seed comes in that seat comes in here let's see come through this woman let's see it come through destined and brought it right to take more and brother brother said it was adultery and he said of predestination seed can't come into adultery when we don't listen to that we just all great it was great message we enjoyed this and wonder what kind of seed are you talking about and watch see he told him said multiply and replenish the earth bring forth a literal seed through Noah but sit through that now I'm lining it up to work it's gonna come to words Christ and we read there in Romans that do the line of that that it would come out to Christ alright now we see then when he comes to Abram or Abraham and he starts dealing with Abraham and he deals with him as didn't land first I'll give you from this place to that place give you everywhere you said the sole of your foot then he says and unto thy seed I'm gonna give you a seed and they Brown says I don't even have one said the best I've got is fluid healers are or what isn't everyone's a guy's name he said the best I got is that feller I don't have nothing he said yeah but I'm gonna give you a seed you realize he was promising to give him the beginning of the seed of the woman I remember the seed of the woman is Jesus Christ she'll now follow me what we're talking about so he starts talking of something greater than land he starts talking to Abraham I'm greater than just uh children could he speaks to know about the children but he starts see we went down now you're supposed to be following me coming back up following it from the earth in its redemptive plan but seeing that we start then and see we move ahead of the earth you realized it when you receive that new birth we'll get to it later so you've moved away ahead of Abraham Noah had them you moved into a wonderful situation and you're no longer gonna be dealing with flesh you remember will reread this in a minute remember what it said in there about that flesh is not to be counted see that's over into the New Testament right it's bringing forth back dark he told him in Genesis 15 he said I'll give you the land from here desire to that in Genesis 15 is the one where we count the Covenant chapter and he speaks of a seed coming toward the fact of not just having children but toward the real true seed takes that man through many situations takes him through the land that he walks don't own a dab of it right but yet to God and him as far as that's concerned you'll never been at it because everywhere you put this over your foot I'm gonna give it to you that was what I told mother even about an unconditional covenant an unconditional covenant I've tried to preach it over and over and over to get you to think an unconditional covenant we think it means there's no condition whatsoever I hope you listen to that last message were the very people that God was talking about was into bondage because of their sin time and time again the children of Israel was put into bondage because of their sin if it's unconditional why did he do anything so it's not you can just get by do anything you won't do no the unconditional covenant i ended it up there the other day by finishing boy what the unconditional code that means God done it and he's going to keep it it's going to be his way that's unconditional you don't have enough to do your salvation except one time you got to believe it we'll never get tired of see I mean this today I started to say we do it this evening yeah we'll never get to our today where I'm headed but we'll take care of it later now listen he brings in a seed point he brings in two people now remember Adam was people you know and they fail right now he comes forth in Abram you know Genesis 17 and comes to the circumcision why does it come to circumcision why does it come to circumcision because it's coming up he's gonna cleanse this world with no one did now through Abraham he's gonna bring forth the seed and he's going when that seed gets here and he never went into that until Isaac came read your Bible then when Isaac went when God God got away from a lot I mean Abram got away from locked and God told him to then you started seeing God moving toward Abram and his covenant that he'd made back before them that he was gonna come through him you remember he told him he said when I don't even have nobody what can I do he said what you're gonna have a child Sarah is gonna be the mother and you're gonna have a child and said it's gonna be a seed and said it's gonna be a special one and said when he gets here you're circumcising now he's dealing with this flesh I know what circumcision means come on we gonna go get to it it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost right but is that not supposed to work back through this flesh he starts showing thou her that he's cleanse in the natural flesh the circumcision that's what I was trying to get you to say following God through the line then he talks when he gets it Isaac you remember even after Abraham we got his name change after all the things that happened he still said Lord said Lettie a small liver for you he said it was gonna be this out of the earth but said that a who I'm talking about the Isaac and he named him rayji scripture God named him and he said his name is Isaac and said he's going to be the promised son he realized then that God says it three times God says three times Genesis 22 and to take thy son not only son Genesis 22 and 12 not only son Genesis 22 and 16 and has not withheld thy son thine only son remember the words of the Prophet this is what if God says something like surely surely fair leave early listen because something is very important when you see a repeat it's a very important point and God Himself repeated three times if Abraham's son not only son because it would be the promised son coming to Isaac because that's what the scripture said it would be all right and as it would come to as ik he would bring in circumcision but no one and all of those children that Abraham was brought forth every one of those sons yet eleven according to the Prophet I know one time I can read quote to when Tommy says seven but twice he says eleven ain't argued and many times it might have been in the middle ain't gonna do it you argue them things he is dying listen to what the point the point was he had more than them two children and every one of them children you know they've all had to be serviced you'll never hear my preaching about the ISM will be circumcised you don't ever hear nobody the message preaching Hagar and the promise of brother branham bring a whole message about Hagar and says God heard her voice but don't know is Hagar that that's a bad thing that's out of it you don't listen in to your prophet that's what I mean but listen it was coming to a promised seed what it started at genesis 3:15 promised seed now you seemed this taken and bringing Isaac as the promised seed hey I've got the quote slain you so don't worry about it but one said the world thinks that the promised seed was Isaac he said that was the natural he said the spiritual promised seed was Jesus Christ come on don't get all out into the wild lands with you well he don't know what he's talking about that's why I say them things because out there you never know who's listening and what's going on that's why we put these notes on the internet where at least they can read it even if I don't read it to you but listen Abraham then was told my son not only son it wasn't the others the children of Abraham Isaac what he saw was there was about seven more or a more 10 more I mean he wanted put in there are the children of Abraham but none of them got counted because God had already said a small she'll be the promised son naturally a small was God's chosen son it turned out sitting highs in Isaac shall thy seed be called listen God speaks and when it says in Isaac shall thy seed be called let's retail okay let's just read Romans nine over again whether they get these up or whatever it's okay we can go Romans nine those are the fathers of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came and who is over all God blessed forever amen not as though the Word of God had taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are Israel nepal's explaining Hebrew had that Abraham had more than just one or two kids and all Israel is not integral thinking everyone say a small right over that right now everyday right in the sound of all Jerusalem in the city the horn is proclaiming Oh God and each small was his son get sister Barbara talked to her husband explain me they say a small was the one that Abraham took up to be crucified God he's the son of Abraham but according to the Bible according to God he's not because you're not even looking at natural seed you're looking at the promise not as though God hath taken none of it they are not all Israel neither because they are the seed of Abraham this one neither because they are the seed of Abraham are the old children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called these narrowing it down because this is the New Testament writing of the Old Testament okay that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for this is the word of promise at this time I'll come and Sarah she'll have a son listen church I know you don't like me being sarcastic but you tell me it's not the truth I knew them Scriptures is that in the Baptist Church we had a saying all Israel's not Israel with all Jews or Jews you ever heard that one that was a saying through the Baptist in time see all this realize they knew all their lives wouldn't cousin you eat smoke and then you had more sons but Jew means God's chosen and it ain't even dealing with Abraham it's coming through Judah see all the Israel's not Israel but all Jews are God's chosen we do that back then what's matter now what's the problem with understanding that all of that back there was to bring down till we could understand how that we could be of the seat of Abraham and it we're not of the seed of Abraham we have no salvation oh wait a minute now okay you want the promised natural come through Isaac Abraham to Isaac to Jacob Jacob's changed to Israel the 12 patriarchs comes out of Jacob this changed to Israel plenty of the leanings down through that comes right on down and comes down as I said the other day to Christ in that lineage on you it back then see go we could read the Lee needs come to Joseph not to Mary because you had no lineage of the women but Joseph was not the father of Jesus or at least how that lets you to understand it but the promisee back tyre was to walk he promised Abraham that through his seed now listen I made a promise with you in the beginning when I first started smoking Abraham and said now I'm telling you Isaac's gonna be that child not each more know anything helps cut him a hold it the one gonna be one seed you remember how I made that statement now many of you believed it the Covenant was never made with everybody it was made with Abraham and his seed after him so you better start wanting some way or connection whatsoever somewhere down the line to have a little bit of link toward Abraham because there is no covenant he didn't make a covenant with everybody in the world he didn't even make the covenant with all of Abraham's literal seed that was the point he made it with Isaac because it would come down to speaking of Jesus Christ how are you listening you should be understanding that what it done when when it fell and went down you started coming back the land comes back promising but then he starts talking about a seed then he starts specifying that seed then when that seed falls on the line and he comes forth which was Isaac he circumcised him he small s get circumcised - Abraham had to get circumcised - started coming towards this human part of you and I are you listening coming towards this human part that we are we can see our bodies come from the earth fine but there's got to be some redemptive to form to deal with you and I yeah we're a lot of hands don't blame your called we're not Jews and he this is you in would believe it wanna see I mean outwardly what the Jews had you in word it C as rulers not outwardly not just one see inwardly gotta be by the new birth the only way you and how I ever be worth anything but remember it had to be right back here so how wonderful it was when he just kept unfolding his story to Abraham in what he would do turn him back to a young man before Isaac could come on the scene for any promise could be made I kept but he said I done told you back you're not gonna do it he said now I'm gonna do it he said you don't get in trouble you gonna have problems and said your lineage is only even gonna be told him to start with it 6:15 chapters you he said your lineage is gonna be your peoples gonna be an agent for 400 errors I said don't you worry about it doesn't made my covenant I'll go get him I'll bring him out coming back two words of promise coming to Isaac one seed and Isaac speaks of Christ because in Genesis coming in Galatians 3:16 not unto thy seeds as of many but as unto thy seed which is Christ and had been no Isaac and a promise I'm trying to get you up to a point looking at something that dark in Abraham God started making it - showing you it was going to be the seat of promise not all of his descendants but the seat of promise was gonna fall in Isaac and did he top Christ and then the seat of promise would come into being you better hope you can get related in some way to the seat of promise you can argue all you won't do a brush there's like you know say but the guy that didn't want to Theron boy truth a boy ain't gonna take that you know know me because I got to raise up children to that harlot over there that won't endure that's dirty dog does that Gentile you know what he rejected that boy said I'll take it and from there came Christ what if that guy had a cookie beautiful but he didn't garden you and you don't do it okay I love that but Abraham had many sons but only one son listen one son of promise they come through Sabra no Sara had one son Isaac there was nothing else promised now Abraham had many kids running around he had a whole bunch of kids running around in the yard but that had nothing to do with it God was waiting on Isaac to come into being he had to turn his body back before he could do it then he brought Isaac brings Isaac up circumcised he gets him up so far some were 13 years old whatever close whatever time you want to make and God says take my son down only so not children kill him now watch this because we're gonna we're not gonna get to it but remember I'll ask you a question you remember the last message when we asked why did God choose Abraham you remember that why did he choose Abraham why did choose you remember that last manager why'd you choose you well I predestination that's just confusing to me I agree because you don't understand it God had a reason to choose Abraham or he wouldn't have chose him and I like to weigh the profit I gave you the quote where the Prophet said I know Abraham will raise his children and he knew that before the foundation of the world in it come on did God just look down over time and say I'll take that one I'll take that one he said what but brother daily you get it to Jacob and Esau you know well here's your answer which you don't even realize your answer condemns your answer condemns your questions and talks because the Bible said Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated before either one of them was even born now I can adjust God do that now you answered it just now what you said garden you what Jacob would do and God knew what he saw would do right now you just condemned your own self put your own self out in the open she ain't got nowhere to hide with it so what do you mean I mean God you say does he pick it's huge no he would did everybody be saved but he knows who'll accept him if you don't get nothing out of this you get this one thought in your mind for the later on four times the Bible says abraham believed God and it was imputed or counted or reckoned unto him for salvation our righteousness and may I say it this way what is righteousness what is righteousness according to the Scriptures we just quoted it was Abraham believing God now you won't make anything else they believed God and it was imputed unto him do you believe God or do you believe in God or bow to God or you believe God four times the Bible said abraham believed this will be in the message for later what is the seed of Abraham the ability of a man to believe God is the seed of Abraham what is all of this great seed is everybody's born with you no one talking about you know how the people of the message preached in it you mean brother Dale you're telling me that it's not some kind of a seed I'm telling you what your prophet said it is the ability to believe God that is the only seed God has do what you want to you're not listening anyway listen Abraham was not concerned about all of his children oh yeah he want them all to be good and doing everything I'm sure God he's he's a father don't misunderstand but he was trying to find the promise the promise was in Isaac see but ran him on the message Israel in the church Abraham had eleven sons you know but only one of them was the promise drew Isaac now listen only one of them through Isaac that's the reason Paul said in Romans the night chapter that all Israel are not Israel but through Isaac shall thy seed be called and then God through Isaac representing Christ what about it Abraham had many sons Joe vajura 61 but the Promised One was through Isaac and through Isaac came Christ the Royal seed the real seed of Abraham are you listening but the promise was through Isaac and through Isaac came Christ the Royal seed the real seed of Abraham what is the seed of Abraham it's Jesus Christ how can you be the seat of a brown by a new birth but Jesus Christ sees not air were too short 1965 sister Sarah written that there would be a son born and through this son the world would be blessed all nations would be blessed of the Sun and it's commonly believed especially among the Jews that this was Isaac but it wasn't this promised son of Abraham is Jesus and he is the Royal seed the promise of Abraham Abraham having two sons you know he's talking about if smoke goes one way no Israel in the church but in Isaac was his seed called here is the results of Abraham's seed Jesus Christ is Abraham's seed that we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and her heirs according to the promise what about it so you don't have a dash of your the seed one one seed not seeds but one seed these others were not seed of Abraham this one because Abraham's seed was the face seed that God was speaking of and not the natural seed he wasn't speaking of a natural seed there was a natural Steve Darcis okay listen the faith seed that God was speaking of and not his natural Abraham's seed he was Abraham's seed one and that was Abraham's faith seed pointing to the royal seed that was to come through Abraham's faith now Abraham's natural life but Abraham's spiritual life what about Steve Donaire with a shot they can pull these we won't do 12 if you're catching up with me now you see Mary through Mary not through sex with through faith something exactly like Marie was not that seed Marie was a carrier of the seat he was a genuine faith seed because the Word of God is by faith that he give to Abraham and only faith can produce what God said he'd do faith in his word modern events made clear by prophecy now we're supposed to be this royal seed of Abraham Isaac was the natural seed but the faith seed is the faith in the promise word the promise word don't miss it he said don't miss it was that royal seed that was the seed Abraham's faith and we being dead in Christ become the seed of Abraham what seed was God looking at and thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy but then come the real faith seed the royal seed of Abraham Jesus a promise Abraham had Isaac fruit after the flesh but the real seed wasn't in that organization system it was in that promise of God's Word that he would make him a father of Nations not through Isaac but through the Royal you'll see Jesus that was the royal seed which actually the seed of Abraham Jesus was not a Jew nay there was a Gentile he was Almighty God spoken words original seed helis Christ the seed of Abraham not in his so much in his body cause Isaac that seed of Isaac finally fell and died it backslidden hybrid then what he can't talk straight then he said Isaac and finally fell and died and it backslidden hybrid we'll get to it he said see but the seed of Abraham now listen that he believed God's Word regardless of what the circumstances was what is the place seed of Abraham I just read it the faith seed of Abraham was to believe God's Word well what you mean brother I believe the word do you believe it like Abraham do you believe it's strong enough to take your son out on the hill and kill him oh that's pretty rough in what is the seed of Abraham what was that seed that Isaac only spoke of the Word of God the seed of Abraham what was it not Abraham's body but Abraham's faith Abraham's faith in what the Word of God no matter what come he called anything contrary though there's no it wasn't what is the seed of Abraham as I said now he's back there coming it went down physically Worrell mankind everything promise or the wrought the seed to come the royal seed which would be Christ right genesis 3:15 all right you see Noah starts washing the earth he's getting it ready but he steps up higher to Noah and says no enough multiply and replenish the earth of course you know what our minds stopped right there and many of you stop multiply replenish what did that replenish mean go look it up when plain common sense it simply means go and bring forth not that something was back over there go and bring forth the earth not to replenish it of course at that time you had people but you don't know what I'm talking about there's doctrines that there was people before Adam and Eve and that's where they used that hmm my Bible solves it one problem I mean one statement he's the mother of all living forget it he faced a man on Mars today if there's a monkey apart looking like this and twisting it around that away some kind of something he come from here you know me and my ways don't tell me about all these extra rest girl beings if there is somebody out there he needs salvation he needs a gospel preached to him but he had to come from here because my Bible says Eve is the mother of all living so whatever monkeys is out there come from here see I'm just playing I'm sorry but being playing is blunt you don't have to worry about worth staying but what is Abraham's faith seed is to believe God's work four times they said four times he says in Genesis 15 and 6 and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness romans 4 1 for what saith the scripture abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness glassing 3 and 6 even as abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness jain's 3 in James 2 in 23 and the scripture was concluded which saith abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him righteousness and he was called the friend of God you want to be the friend of God I think I do believe his word that my friends was what made God come from glory because he had a man that would believe him nobody else in the world would believe him that's why I chose Abraham he chose you for the foundation of the world God he knew what he'd do right he knew Abraham would believe him so before the world ever begun he already predestinated Abram Abraham to come forth and to bring that seed Isaac into being and believe that God was gonna get him a child we didn't have none you know no children say I got ahold of it and really messed it up didn't she not even a small hill never turned out to be anything wasn't even accounted in the Bible as a son of a God of Abraham what are you getting at getting at one time as that went down the word he's coming back he came back through door washing the earth your body was there picks up an Abraham and he circumcised that body the meaning is going to retain the body circumcision I know what it means I know we'll get to certain overseas at the top of the baptismal ago this is the man to whom God will not impute sin and may I quote brother Branham you know what he said about that he said you can't impute sin over the token no the only man that qualifies that his sins are not imputed is it person that's got your token see to believe God I studied in the Baptist Church and I thought that's just a plain old human man I remember it so well thinking about Abraham and why would God choose him I didn't know your prophets message to have any answers I knew God loved Abraham for some reason and God picked him above all the others chose him above everybody in the world and made a covenant with him and then to be with his seed after him Dishman disqualified Eastman's the seed but he's disqualified all he gets is a natural blessings you remember he saw an Jacob number one yeah he blessed Jacob when Esau comes in find out what went wrong what'd he do look at it look at the human being what he saw say he said father you give him the blessing said he stole the birthright he said now you get in the blessing and is there not something for me read your Bible Jacob turns around to him and he's lazy and don't even he said you'll be a great nation Kings will come out of you that's all he's holding the Esau wanted some lineage of some form Jacob wanted the birth not which would be the baptism when all that goes right see we'll get to those times but he's getting you to think about it I don't want to end this part of a man in the Old Testament all that God would do and say about him and he says he's my friend but he's called him imputed unto him for righteousness he's called a friend of God he believed God that's yours listen why can't you think about it a little what church did you come out of what do you do this or better do it why can't you think a little bit there's something about you believing can we get into the scriptures you know style evening he that believeth in this baptized she'll be saved they don't say he this baptized he said he that believeth and is baptized look at all of the scriptures as they come into view from a man of Abraham's caliber all it was he believed God he that cometh to God what does the scripture say must believe that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him what a wonderful thing how's the ability to believe am i quoting your prophet he said a lot of people can't believe packin people can't believe what you tell them that this message why then we all when we heard it we went oh no we don't believe that but then after a while it just come in we found that we couldn't believe nothing else how come people don't want to believe you when you start talking about it now you know this is true you finds you about a 50 60 year-old man a woman and you start talking to him about one true and living God and this is what they'll say in the conversation they'll say you mean to tell me do you believe my momma and daddy wouldn't say you ain't mention Mama and Daddy you ain't said a word about mom and dad right you ain't called mom and daddy's name you ain't done nothing why would I do that you mean to tell me that my mom my dad is not saved because you see they know you just said something that mama and daddy didn't believe it that way not if you used any word about mom and dad right there's only one seed that I ever won't have anything to do with now you forgive me I'm blind but you tell me that's the truth I don't have to be born this or born to add or kinfolks to this can't voc's of that and invite you all night you know people say well we got a good lineage down through there he's like I told him one time they said we we got a good lineage you know cuz our people come over in the Mayflower I said there wasn't nothing but a bunch of crooks come over to my flower so your mama admit your mom and daddys crooks right they didn't send the best over here there's been a bunch of garbage can I told him I said you run a line back on my family you might not find too many of them hanging by the tail but you probably run into finding a good many of them hanging by the neck because they were crooks he said well my family come over on the Mayflower what were your news in the back what good does that do you're trying to make some leash out of it and that's what that old you said when when Boaz said redeem your right he said raise your Bible the kinsman he said I will redeem my rock raise your Bible when boys said redeem me right he said I'll redeem my right Boaz said but now sir let's talk about this little bit no I said now when you take that naomi did remember you got to take Ruth and since she's a Gentile and she's your first child it comes from you and now are you and Ruth he's got to be put back to the man's name because it was the law he said ain't having nothing to do with it you can have it he was willing to give it to him he's willing for him to take anything he didn't want no problem what about you and me Oh but my family's a good family praise God that's fine they don't like him saved salvation is of the Lord thought of any thing we do or don't do and your salvation whether you believe it or not they'll get back to more of it ministry it will have to be from somebody that can do what Abraham did they could believe God no matter what went wrong yeah but you don't understand brother Dale I I've done this i went you have not done that and the Lord filled me and he done I'll praise God but do you believe God now come on musician do you believe God now because Abraham seed is a face that and it's to believe God God said it four times did he believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness if you won't have anything to do with righteousness believe God you can go down no Rogerson no other way but I don't do this and I don't do that that is flesh the only thing I want is a faith seed that's all I've asked all of these seed doctrine people where is that seed in you is it in your body in your spirit any soul or is it at all I've ever stood is on one time abraham believed God I believe him and he promised me that he started to work and he wouldn't stop it I don't put it on the fact that I've even seen him at 11 years old I put it on the fact that what I can believe him or not may I put it in this point for you to believe that you're healed there's got to be a PI stench point am i right did you believe it's already finished now I believe in God's gonna heal you he's already done it now that's believing God to believe God will do it is believing in God that's not the faith of Abraham the faith of Abraham believes God no matter what even God does God told him to take his son up and kill him now look at the faith of Abraham walking up that hill curing that knife and his son says daddy said we got the fire we got the wood we got the knife the worse the sacrifice you can get people to realize what that scripture he just said Abraham later statement he said God will provide we're talking about the lamb no God will provide for himself God Himself is going to provide because God's going to be the sacrifice now you getting it right God Himself will be my sacrifice in other words he said Isaac God promised me for you that would be a lineage it would come instead Isaac how can God lie he that's not written in the Bible yesterday all that's written in the Bible they pick up some wood they're going up the hill and Isaac asking now I got more confidence in my kids and my grandkids great-grandkids can't you understand probably the whole journey Abraham was trying to describe Jehovah Jireh to Isaac he got the word you got to he said what God's gonna provide he said if I kill you he'll raise ya read your Bible called he said he counted it he's oh no they didn't talk about it why don't you have a sensible conversation with God a little bit about something every once in a while and listen to him talk he's wonderful and he'll express things to you that are so marvelous he said the way I can reason I chose Abraham because he believed me then now if you're gonna be anything you don't believe me help me little Horton you're gonna walk in the word you gonna believe me and I don't mean this disrespect I mean in truth that's where I've always walked alone in God's Word I've had a lot to try to pull me into different camps yeah I couldn't do it I've walked alone that's where you're just stubborn a thank you but say one thing for certain that I've always tried my best to get you to see Jesus Christ now at least say that that I've always tried to get you to see Jesus Christ he'll not about me I

on God speaks to him and he just moves out sands and water father coast John's father the believer believer don't have father signs up all through Abraham's life God was moving over the knocks at the time yet he wouldn't human pause it he staggered not go back read over the Genesis he said God if it would be let a small walk before you it looks like died out don't it let's see we think boy Abraham Abraham is your boy he was just short people the only thing Supernatural about Abraham was ability to believe God the only way you can ever be saved is to believe God well not a sir no it's based on what you could believe base don't want you gonna believe the father of our faith hey Brian believed God made it manifest what about you and me father we just ask you to go with us now as we separate

come down till it would be in spiritual a promise and then it would go in to the point of being a royal seed not to man but to see that he would produce which would be Almighty God oh you only some lied to believe you thank you Lord forgive our sins leaders and keep us in Jesus name you dismiss [Music] be the rock let's be the rock of my salvation Jose bless it be the wrong lets it be the rock
