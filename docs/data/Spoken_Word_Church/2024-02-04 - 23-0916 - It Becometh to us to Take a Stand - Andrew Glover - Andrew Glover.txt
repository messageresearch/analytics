your healer he's your deliverer amen he's our everything amen with him we can do all things without him we can do nothing amen I'm a firm believer that the word says if God be for us then who can be against us amen if somebody said well all we've got is him I believe that's all we need amen we want to say God bless you all this afternoon how many's glad to be a Christian today amen you're thankful to be in the house of God on a Saturday afternoon and to be enjoying the presence of the Lord and fellowshiping with the Believers and amen it's just a special time to be serving the lord seems like everything is attached attacking Christianity and the things of God in this generation but to be a numbered as one of them I believe that's the greatest honor of Our Lives amen and if you have your Bibles today we go straight to the word we want to turn to the Book of Matthew the third chapter The Book of Matthew the third chapter and then also we're going to look in the book of Ephesians the 6th chapter and we also want to say God bless you and we sure appreciate the invitation brother Wade inviting us to come back and be with you all again and I think last time he asked me if about coming I asked him if he was going to be here I it's just not the same being here and him not here picking on you think last time we was here he was uh I think he was out maybe in Illinois killing them little old deer out there you know I tell you man things are small out there you know no we're just just just joking with him amen but we sure appreciate brother Wade appreciate his stand for this message and what the church here stands for and uh just to have a burden on your heart to do something for the young people we want to say thank you Amen to stand for this word and give him a place to Fellowship amen we sure appreciate the burden here on this assembly for this word and of course it's good to have my wife here Mariah I think sister uh June back there's already grabbed a little baby so we're sure sure thankful to have them here with us this weekend and in the Book of Matthew the third chapter we want to look here in the 10th verse um very familiar scripture here the Bible says and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees there therefore every tree which bringeth forth not forth good fruit is shune down and cast into the fire I indeed baptize you with water under repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to Bear now he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand he will thoroughly Purge his floor gather his wheat into the Garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire now then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me and Jesus answering saith unto him suffer it to be so now so this is not in the future not in the past but suffer this to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him amen now I like about that is John is speaking to Jesus Jesus speaking back to John and he's showing them this is our purpose or this is our commission now in the book of Ephesians the 6th chapter I just want to read two verses from there H we'll pray and let you be seated uh this is another very familiar reading to to the Believers it's where Paul is addressing the Christian Soldiers and in Ephesians the 6th chapter and in the 13th verse he he says now wherefore take unto you so you got to you got to possess it you got to you got to you got to take it take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to they and having done all to stand now watch this stand so he does not give you another option if standing don't work here's something else to try he said but when you've done all to stand stand therefore having your loins G about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness amen let's just bow our hearts together how many would say Lord speak to me today Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here this afternoon we are very well aware that we're not in this building by ourselves but Lord I believe there's an Angelic host in this building father to push back against the spirits of unbelief the spirits of doubt and Lord to bring a faith into the hearts of your children now Lord I pray that you would send the anointing in the building for Lord without the anointing the Yoke will remain but Lord because of the anointing the Yoke shall be destroyed father may you destroy the Yoke over the lives of these young people Lord whatever the enemy would be trying to tempt them in their minds and bind them in their Spirits oh God I pray that you would release him by your word today and Father may this be an emus Road experience Lord and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen you may be be seated here today I I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments to take those two passages of scripture and if I'd speak to you today I want to title this it becometh us to take a stand it becometh us to take a stand now uh brother Brandon preaches 1961 he preaches an entire sermon beautiful sermon and he calls it it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness now uh those of you that have the table you have the folio views on your computer if you'll look there you'll find that right underneath the title it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness you'll see that brother randam actually originally titles that sermon stand for righteousness so it it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and in there I remember when I was first studying that tape over and over and over you're hearing him talk about stand stand stand and I begin to wonder why is he focusing so much on a stand but then I realized he's actually preaching stand for righteousness now in the book of Ephesians Paul says having done all to stand he says stand therefore amen having your loins G about with truth now when you look at this word stand the word means to set it means to establish it means to stand still it is to be to stand by it is to set up in the presence of others Amen in the midst before judges before members of the Sanhedrin it means to place to to make firm to cause a person amen or a thing to keep his or its place so when something is standing it's in a position when something is standing it is not moving to the left or to the right but it is fixed amen it is to establish a thing it is to uphold or to sustain amen The Authority or the force of anything it is to stand in movable to stand firm of the foundation of a building so actually the foundation of this building is is the stand of this building amen another definition means to continue safe and sound to stand unharmed Amen to stand ready or prepared to be of a steadfast Mind of a quality I love this one it is one who does not hesitate or does not waver amen so when one is standing they're not hesitating they're not wavering amen they're standing there amen without without wavering now my next question for you is how are we going to stand amen without wavering well brother brother brandham says the only way we can stand without wavering is we must have an unwavering Faith now in the message resurrection of Lazarus 51 he says now look deity I'm a part of Charles brandham because I was born from Charlie brandham my Daddy I'm a part of him I got a forehead like him my hair was like him I'm a small man like him I'm in the nature like him because he's my dad and if we become in spirit sons of God Amen then deity dwells in the man see then you talk about blind eyes being open he said they said nothing is impossible to God Amen but God said nothing is impossible with you amen if you'll believe not with God but you amen deities in man amen amen deity is in man see the very God that stood back there on the mythical platform of the eternities and rolled the worlds off of his hands and created these things give you the privilege Amen to be his son and you are a part of him and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity now that that's not that's not a skim milk man himself is deity amen there you are it might choke you amen but God dwells in man and man becomes a Son of God not him in himself amen but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God Amen the Creator lives in the creation he said then stand with an unwavering faith and ask what you will amen and it will be done unto you amen if you have got the holy ghost in your soul amen then you're not just the son of an Earthly father amen and an Earthly mother but there is an element of deity amen God himself is in you amen now come on church because you're a two-fold being amen you're a human being but you're also let me say this way you're a you're a a human being but you're also a god being amen I believe that the humanity is the wavering part amen I believe it's the humanity that wavers H I believe it's the humanity that gets discouraged I believe it's the humanity that gets tired amen but there's another part of you amen and greater is he that is in you amen than he that is in the world now come on church amen it's the humanity that is wavering it's the deity that's unwavering now the prophet of God said what made that big tumor disappear in my wife yesterday amen just a few days ago she was ready for the operating table and now they can't find a thing it's because the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that token of God that he still lives destroyed it what does these things what causes them to happen amen it's because you're he said no he said you're a product see amen so hold the token in your unwavering faith in his Word of Promise amen hold the token in his unwavering faith in the word Word of Promise now amen I know there's two ways we could say this amen we could say make a stand and take a stand now I know you're probably thinking there's no difference but actually I got to study on it and I found out that there is a difference in making a stand and taking a stand I didn't I did not title this it becometh us to make a stand I titled it it becometh us to take a stand because when you make a stand amen it refers to a single event or a decision amen but when you take a stand it is more often applied to taking or adopting amen a stance or position to actions amen over a period of time so if you make a stand it's temporary amen but if you if you take a stand amen it's something that's going to last more than just a service it's going to last more than just a youth camp it's going to last more than just a special meeting amen when you take a stand you are AOW to God that what I'm standing for is something I'll still be standing standing for a year from now amen or two years from now amen because see our stand is our position amen our stand is our position that's why the prophet of God said amen God may we tonight take our stand amen our position in Christ he said they're like men and women of God Sons and Daughters of the Creator who just spoke the world came into existence he said God we called ourselves Christians and can't even believe for little healings amen what you promised to give us God forgive us amen of our stupidity and may we rise tonight like real men and women Sons and Daughters of God and go forth in the earth conducting ourselves in like manner amen then as Sons and Daughters of God Amen it is our duty Amen to stand for Jesus Christ I love what the prophet said he said it's our duty to take our stand it's God's duty to back us up amen it's our duty to take the stand amen but it's God's duty to back us up amen that's why now I'm just going to preach for a second he said because if you do your part amen then you'll find out that God will do his amen if you do your part your part is taking the stand amen but God's part is to supply the strength Amen to continue in the stand that you've taken now another place he said then when we take our stand today when men say these things can't happen don't be fussing with them amen that's wrong don't fuss with them but pick up the sword see now watch here's your part amen pick up the sword amen look at what's supposed to be in this day when God give his promise for today he said now pick this up this Bible The Sword and go and all the goliaths will fall under it amen when you pick up when you do your part and you pick up the sword amen and go forward amen all the goliaths will fall underneath the sword come on church it was not David's job to put Goliath under the sword it was David's job to pick up the sword to take God at his word and to withstand amen that uncircumcised Philistine but it was God's part Amen to lay Goliath underneath the sword of David listen church it's not your part Amen to put the devil underneath your foot it's not your part to defeat the Devil amen God already defeated that devil 2,000 years ago amen your part is to pick up the faith in the word of God Amen and March over those Devils with a full unw ing faith in the Vindicated word of God now come on amen amen sometimes you got to realize it all add all up to the preacher it ain't all up to the pastor it ain't all up to the youth leader amen sometimes you got to realize you got a part to play amen it was David's part to pick up the sword it was David's part to take a stand it was David's part to confess that God was bigger than that uncircumcised Philistine amen but it was God's part to lay Goliath under DAV Avid sword amen David was too small to do that David had no physical ability Amen to take a giant and make a and make a a defeated enemy out of him but God had the power because David had the courage to take a stand you know I find many times that people make stands at camps and they make stands in meetings and conventions and the reason they make those stands is because the atmosphere amen is so charged and amen it's so easy to say that's right I I'll stand for Jesus you know amen getting a good hot meeting on a Saturday night and the power of God moving amen and it's easy to Rejoice it's easy if you got a sickness in your body amen go through a good prayer line and the anointing is there and the power of God is there and you say I'm Healed and you walk out the door amen now what you did was you made a stand amen but when you get home and you wake up the next morning and that old Lon symptom is still there amen you got to take a stand now amen you made a stand last night amen but now you got to take a stand said you got to make a stand and then continue to stand amen you got to take a stand by continuing to stand I don't believe that God is looking for people Amen to make a stand temporarily but I believe he's looking for someone who will take an eternal stand now the prophet of God said faith cannot rest upon the shifting SS of man's theology but Faith takes its Eternal stand upon the unchangeable and unshakable Rock of Ages and can stand there while the waves amen is beating the bottom out of it amen and the grave is open and look across the sea to him that said I am the resurrection and the life see amen stand there now I said like this if you don't stand for something you're going to fall for anything if you don't stand for something you're going to fall for anything do you realize that there's actually only two positions today amen that people will find themselves in they're either standing or they're bowing they're either standing or they're bowing you say now now now preacher what are you getting at well as Believers I believe that we are to stand I I just don't believe we're to bow to Leota I don't believe we're to bow to spirits of this world I I'll be honest with you I don't believe that a church ought to bow to the spirit of lukewarmness I I just don't think we ought to bow to these things I believe amen that the time has come that Satan don't want us to stand amen but God is calling for us to stand brother said it's so strange to see that when people take a stand for God looks like the devil throws everything in their way that he can Amen to throw in their way but do you realize we're one of the greatest experiences in your life comes from it comes from standing brother ra said the greatest experience I've ever had is to come up against something I could not get over or under it but I just stand there amen and I watch watch God make a way through it see that's the way to do it just move just keep moving amen press your nose against it amen just keep moving on God Will Make A Way amen then your stand is connected to your Victory amen your stand is connected to scene amen the situation change amen and God come on the scene and get the glory I believe that time is at hand Amen to make a stand and take a stand what about it young people I think it's time to make a stand but I think it's time to take a stand said if you're going to make a stand for God make it now amen this is the time now's the time that we need it he said another place I want to go on record in heaven tonight that in this Auditorium here in this great City of Chicago in the High School auditorium I want to go on record amen that I stand for Jesus Christ I want to go on record today that I stand for Jesus Christ and for his righteousness another place if You' lived in some days gone by when they crucified Jesus you'd say oh I would have stood for him I'd have give my life for him amen but you have more of an opportunity to do that now than you would in them days see he said stand now amen the opposition is greater today than it was then amen well if I had have been there man in the days of the crucifixion I would have stood for him amen but right here in this age they're crucifying amen the word of God young people and you've got his much a chance right now to take a stand amen as they did on the day of Calvary amen because the word is being crucified again but I believe that God is raising up a generation of young people who will not back up they will not turn around they will not lay down amen but they will put their nose to the devil and they will push back against that devil until Liberty comes and deliverance come on church I think that's what we need in the house of God Amen it's not so much arguing and fussing and who can do what who can say what I think we need the liberty of the Holy Ghost Amen to come back in the church and the fire and the Dynamics of the spirit of God until there comes a strength in the church now amen I don't believe that God Amen has called us to be weakens I don't believe God has called us to be cowards amen but I believe it takes courage to make a stand I love what the Bible says in second Peter 1 it says the prophecy came not in Old Time amen by the will of men but holy men of God fake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost you know what kind of men we're talking about we're not talking about church members we're not talking about religious uh uh social gatherers we're talking about God called individuals the prophet of God said and God don't want cowards woo brother God don't want cowards he cannot use you if you're afraid to take his word and believe him he wants Gallant men Heen that won't pay attention to nothing amen but what the Lord says that's the kind he has to move with now listen Church regardless of what the church says what the pastor says what the church stands for he stands for God and righteousness and his word amen a god- calleded man is not a coward amen a god- calleded man is a gallant man he's a man that stands for God his word and righteousness now as message Believers I know sometimes as young people uh we we spend a lot of time Amen instilling in our young people what we stand against we we we let's just be honest we do we stand against this and we stand and we do we we we we actually do stand against things but I just want to say this as message Believers we don't just stand against something but we actually stand for something we're not just here standing against something we actually stand for something remember said in the church age book he said now remember this that that Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and would defile it make it lukewarm amen formal and Powerless it exposes Satan it Reveals His works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word amen right down to the time he has cast in the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it because he knows listen the devil knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is now listen and what she stands for amen not just what she stands against amen but what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit amen then Satan will be powerless before her come on church amen the devil is not powerless before us amen because of what we stand against I'm going to preach to you amen cuz we're not the only people that stand against women cutting their hair we're not the only people that stand against boys not wearing shorts well we used to amen we're not the only people that stands against having televisions and if we used to we ought to do it now because it's still the word of God now now it's Saturday morning or Saturday afternoon I might as well preach I'm here amen what we stood against then we still stand against today but that's not where the strength is coming from Amen to defeat the Devil and to do the Greater Works amen the strength is coming from what we stand for see he will be as definitely forwarded today as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the desert oh yes Satan hates Revelation amen but we love it amen we love Revelation with the true Revelation in our Our Lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail against them see what she stands for amen not against is what produces an invincible Army now somebody said well brother Ram said there we got to discern that's right amen but let me break this down for you Discerning is one thing and withstanding is another Discerning is one thing but withstanding what has been discerned is another you know the prophet preaches an entire sermon called the discernment of spirit right he says and every Christian is under commission Amen to deser or to try the spirit amen and to prove whether it's of God or not right amen now listen it's easy to discern something and say well that's right or that's wrong amen but where the battle comes is when you got to withstand what you discern to be wrong I can prove it to you from the Bible in the book of Samuel the Bible says that David spake to the man stood by him and said what shall be done to the man that kth his Philistine and taketh away the approach from Israel amen now watch for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God now watch a prophet amen picked this up in scripture he shows you what the Bible says how that David slew both the lon and the bear and he said now this uncircumcised Philistine amen shall be as one of them when David identified that that Goliath was an uncircumcised Philistine who had put a reproach upon the armies of the Living God and something ought to be done about this devil amen David discerned Goliath amen but that was not David withstanding Goliath the Bible says that he went and took his staff in his hand and he chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even in a script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the Philistine so David didn't just stand out there and say brother Zach something's got to be done something's got to be done but when David went over there and picked up five smooth stones and he got his slingshot and he walked out there and met that Goliath he was no longer just Discerning Goliath amen but now he was withstanding Goliath and I believe there's an army here today that's not just Discerning things and way out of See You Is Wrong amen but there is a strength and there is a courage that has come into the heart of this generation Amen to withstand those Devils listen we don't just withstand the devil at church we withstand him on Monday morning we withstanding on Tuesday week amen because we're not here just to say well this is wrong and that's wrong we're here to withstand these things yes but you got to take a stand now remember said by faith David saw the victory he said he saw the victory he said look out Goliath you got to fall and when he set that loose the Holy Ghost amen got a hold of that little Old Stone and and picked up a speed about 1,000 mil per second and struck that giant between the face and he fell forward Hallelujah Oh my he said like a little Jim Crow danced up there jumped on him pulled his sword out chopped his head off said how do you like fat boy reached down got him by the hair of his head said come on boys amen let's preach Divine Healing and away they went he said you know what they done the rest of them seen it could be done and they cut Philistines Plum to the wall the come on Amen Goliath had every one of them is a bunch of cowards amen scared to death to do anything amen but when God got a hold of a David and he discerned that devil and he withstood that devil and he cut Goliath's head off amen that brought a liberty into the entire Camp Amen to believe that God if he could do it for David he could do it for me let me say church amen we don't need a thousand people here today we just need one believer Amen to get in contact with the god of Abraham and believe that if he did it for you he can do it for somebody else and in a few minutes Devils will go to fly spirits will be defeated listen because God just needs somebody to get some courage to get some grit to take a stand listen David I love how David says this in Psalm 16:5 he says the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou amen maintain us my lot you know what David here is saying brother way I believe that David is saying the Lord is my portion you agree the Lord is my portion now when you start looking at this word portion amen portion means territory so what David is actually saying is the Lord is my territory in other words he is all that I have and all I have is because of him in other words there will be no fight until the devil gets on my territory there'll be no there'll be no Bloodshed there'll be no swords drawn until the devil gets over on my inheritance then there's going to be a battle because the Bible says in Psalm 73:26 My Flesh and my heart faileth amen but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever Psalms 1 1957 Thou Art my portion oh Lord I have said that I will keep thy words Psalms 142:5 I Cried unto thee oh Lord I said Thou Art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living Lamentations 3:24 the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in him so David here is speaking of an inheritance he is speaking of a portion he is speaking of a Heritage now do you realize that we as spiritual Sons and Daughters of God we have a spiritual Heritage and our spiritual Heritage is none other amen than the word of God the Bible says in Acts 20:32 now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up amen and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified amen now the word of Grace can justify you then it can bring you over into the second step or or stage of restoration and can give you an inheritance among those which are Sanctified listen what the prophet of God said he said if God can ever get a people under his un own control if he'll a man or a woman that won't compromise on his word but will stand there like the Rock of Ages amen when you have been given a portion of inheritance among those which are Sanctified you have been given a place in the Rock of Ages and you will stand like the Rock of Ages stood that'll believe every word of it that'll believe that he's behind it and a man who believes it you must act like it and if you don't act like it then you don't believe it but if you believe it then act like it and you oh that's powerful can I read that again amen if you believe it then act like it if you don't act like it then you don't believe it but if you believe it then act like it and you can put it to work and the word will be in you see then how is our heritage lost amen our heritage is lost by compromising when we give up our stand when we give up our position the problem of God said we lost our heritage because we just compromise and when we compromise now listen church when we compromise then we cannot expect God to keep his promise to us when we compromise we cannot expect God to keep his promise to us are you ready for this because we broke in upon the sacred trust and defiled the trust that God gave us he said then let us keep that trust keep it sacred keep it holy keep every word of it and compromise nowhere then do you realize as young people that you did not stumble into this age you did not accidentally stumble into this age amen we have been sent into this age do you know why we've been sent in this age to prove God's word Paul said in Romans 12 he said I beseech you verse one therefore my brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable amen now watch this unto God which is your reasonable service and being not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that you may prove that ye may prove what is that good amen and acceptable and perfect will of God preaches an entire sermon and he calls it proving his word paragraph 210 he said he proves all of his words just think of it all of his words and you were his word he was the word and you were a part of his word and that's the reason you're sent here is to confirm your place in life so you didn't stumble into leosia you didn't stumble into this message but you were sent here amen by the predestination of almighty God Amen to confirm your place in life now watch a prophet turn a corner and say there will be a resurrection of the Dead there will be a Rapture of the church there will be a millennium there will be a new heavens and a new Earth amen and he'll prove it because his word said so and only the righteous will be there only the righteous only the ones who took a stand amen and they did not back off of the Sacred trust they did not defile The Inheritance they did not compromise one place but they stood and they put their nose against the devil and every day every week every month every year they fought back against the devil amen because they're here to confirm their place as a Victorious son and daughter of God Only The Righteous will be there amen all now can I preach to you only the ones that's been made part of this word see will be their part and their position in this word for this day for their age will be the only ones will be there because that's just what it is he is the word and what is a woman she is the image of a man what is the church the image of the word only the True Believers in his word amen know this and can believe it amen only the True Believers in his word know this and can believe it then what is is this message the message of the hour amen is a spiritual union to Christ by the word amen you are the bride of Christ right then listen what a prophet said he said the bride will know her husband will know her mate the revealed word then you are married to the revealed word there is a sacred trust in the revealed word you have got a position to confirm in that revealed word and this bride amen this bride then she's not going to to come into this Sanctified among the Sanctified but the way she's going to come in is she's going to be Washed by the Water of the word Paul said amen that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word I love what the prophet said he said cleanse us Lord how many say Lord today just cleanse usen just cleanse us Lord amen from all unbelief that we might be drawn nigh unto thee as a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God Amen for this is our reasonable service what did Paul say he said that we might be washed By the Waters of the word do you know what a washing means a washing means a bath or a bathing amen do you know what a bath does Amen a bath actually separate you amen from the dirt now now some of you Brothers you come home you've been outside working all day dirt under your fingernails dirt behind your ear smell like a pole cat am me and there's a there's a beautiful table spread with all kinds of good food you know amen you don't walk in amen kick your boots off go sit down at the table all that fil on you and partake of the meal but your wife says honey go take a shower amen and what do you do you get in the shower now when you get in that bath you're going to get underneath the water then there's going to be some soap come on Amen hopefully you believe in taking baths there going to be some soap amen and what's going to happen is the dirt is going to be attached to you but when you get out of the shower you're going to get out but the dirt's going to stay you know what that tells me brother Mike that tells me that the dirt is not more powerful than the water the dirt is not more powerful than the soap there is something in the water and the soap that can assur and authority over that dirt and cause it to take its hands off of you and let you come out clean don't you see why you need to come to church it's cuz dirt gets in our lives it gets into our homes and when that word begins to lay out over the church the wash Into the Water by the word amen begins to push back the dirt and you come out clean you come out clean and the dirt stays behind amen because our bath is the Waters of Separation brother Bob it's not the Waters of mixing it's the Waters of separation and the Waters of separation is by the word now we read Matthew 3 I love Matthew 3 because in there Jesus is speaking with John and John is asking Jesus why would someone like me have to baptize someone like you basically and the prophet picks this up and says now why would a man like Jesus had to be baptized he said why would a person have to be baptized like a man coming baptism is after confession he had no confession to make because he was God see but what it is is he was our example right our example is Christ so then there must be a basis that we can put our faith on brother said like this he said the truth of it was he was the antitype he was the high priest and before the high priest could be anointed he had to be washed amen so before an anointing there must be a washing I'm just going to preach to you when I believe for a second I believe we tried to have too many anointings without without without Washings come on Amen we're screaming for the anointing but we don't want no washing amen but the anointing follows the washing it's in Ezekiel or Exodus rather sorry Exodus 29 when the Bible said shall wash them with water then shalt thou take the anointing oil and pour it upon his head and anoint him see Aaron the high priest before he could ever be anointed he had to be washed with the water see the Bible said that Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost and went about doing good things so before Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost he was at the river of Jordan the water and he received a baptism amen as an example to every believer who will believe on the name of the son of God and will be baptized in that name will come fo a washing that there will come an anointing upon the life of that believer because why we are Kings and Priests unto God now the Bible says in revelation: 15 he said we have been washed which means loose from our sins in his own blood see then the blood was greater than the sin when you went through the blood you come out but the sin stayed in the sin could not pass through the blood because there was something greater in the blood than there was in the Sin oh if you got Hallelujah if you can raise your hands and say God I've been sealed I've been saved I've been cleansed by the blood you ought to be the happiest person in this church today that there's a blood there's a propitiation there's an atonement and there's something in that blood that's greater than what was in your sin come on Church the blood is strong the blood is powerful brother said what washed he said actually the word washed means loosed he said now it was in his own blood that he loosed us completely from our sins it was not human blood can we agree it was not human blood he said now watch it was the blood of God Peter called it the blood of Christ Paul called it the blood of the Lord and the blood of Jesus it was not three persons but it was one person there's that Revelation again one God that omnipotent Jehovah God came down and made himself in a body by means of the Virgin birth and indwelt it that he might be the blood of God that would free us or loose us entirely the blood of God would loose us entirely from our sins and would present us spotless before himself with exceeding great joy Revelation 1:5 he has washed Us in his own blood Revelation 1:6 now watch after the washing comes 1 six and hath made us amen Kings and Priests unto God right after the washing amen comes an identification that you're not just a washed church member but you was washed for a purpose you were washed to become a king and a priest unto God oh God wash first you were washed first now come on Church you were washed first but now watch a prophet and then anointed for service that's right you were washed first and then anointed for service amen see you've been washed and anointed brother brother brother L what have we been washed for what have we been anointed for to bring forth a testimony for god brother B said now watch in 1 Corinthians 5 he says read it now to Wi that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us amen the word of reconciliation are you ready for this amen the Christ was God's testimony because God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself amen God was in Christ reconciling the so what was Christ doing he was bringing forth the testimony of God now come on church let me preach because all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the church then Church of the Living God you've not been brought on the earth to be a slave to depression to be a slave to Suicide to do a service under the world you have been liberated by the washing of the water of the word to bring forth a testimony unto God you're not put here to do Le out a service you're here to do God a service you're not here come on don't get mad at me you're not here to do education a service you're here to do God a service come on adults you're not here Amen to put your business on the map your business on this Earth is to do God a service and everything everything everything falls secondarily to the word of God having preeminence you're here to do a service now I I think it's amazing because I'm just going to I'm going to slow down and read this I I I love this because who else could go to the Book of Matthew 3 like a prophet and could go back and could rehearse to you a conversation between John and Jesus he said now and brother picks it up he said now he said suffer this to be so he said that's right in other words now listen at this John now now John here is asking brother Bob he's asking why do I need to baptize you you need to baptize me he's got all these questions but what he don't realize is John has a position he has a place in life to confirm and Jesus says John you're a mighty man you're a great man you're a mighty Prophet your revelation of me is exactly the truth you know who I am you you know because your ministry didn't come from man your ministry came from God you never learned it of man you wasn't taught this in a seminary but at the age of N9 years old you went into the Wilderness because you were born an odd peculiar child and from your very birth God be to deal with you and even before your birth the prophet saw you and you are a lie of this day now watch this you know who I am you know who I am because God in the wilderness told you there'd be a sign following me and you've already bore witness of it and you know it and we know who each other are we know each other and it is true that you need to be baptized to me but let's suffer that to be so for John if we are the lights of this day if we are the lights of this day then we must fulfill all righteousness all of God's word must be fulfilled by us for this day for it is becoming to us it is behooving it is becoming it is like us for if we are the true Witnesses of God today then John we are the lights of this age and if we are the lights of this age there's so much scripture that's got to be fulfilled during this age and it's up to us hallelujah it's up to us to see amen that all of God's righteousness is fulfilled and what is his righteousness it's his word so before Jesus sat down and had a youth service with John on the Saturday afternoon and and looked at him face to face and said John you're here for a greater purpose you're here to do more than just run the woods you're here to do more than just eat the Locust and the Honey amen but you are here because you are the light of this day John you got a commission upon your life you got a purpose upon your life and the prop of God said every age had light listen it can I I don't know how to do this maybe like this you know brother Wade it'd be like me and you sit down here you know and we talk and you're sitting over there and I'm sitting here and you say now brother Andrew we we going to go in this building we're going to tear out the walls we're going to build a new wall we're going to lay a new floor we're going to paint the ceiling we're talking about this and I'm saying but brother brother Wade who's going to do this who's going to do this brother Wade I know some of y'all there can't see me let me move over here brother Wade uh oh sorry I put it back who going to do this uh brother Wade I'm not good enough brother I just I just don't think I

job to do listen and if you don't do it Andrew it ain't going to get done this is your assignment you're a part of this you're a part of this uh this Pro this project you know what I'm going to do when when reality strikes me that I got to do this I'm going to stand up and I'm going to say well it ain't going to get done sitting here crying about it we got to get to work when the reality hits my heart that I've got a job to do and as long as we're sitting here rehearsing it it's never going to get done come on church when are you going to realize you got more to do amen than just sitting Church three times a week you got a job to do it's to be more than a church member it's to be a living walking breathing talking manifested adopted son of almighty God walking in Authority walking in anointing walking in power walking in reality walking in Revelation listen it falls your lot it falls your lot we got to do it amen we got to do it if it's going to get done it's got to be done by the ones who's called to do it so let's get up and get to work I'm preaching to you now let's get up and get to work in other words see the lot of this age should do the same thing the word will not come easy it comes by observation you've got to press your way to it but yet it behooveth us it behooveth us it's becoming to us to fulfill all of God's righteousness we must do it can we say that together we must do it brother said let's go back for just a minute and take up some characters who knew their position in their day and was willing to stand criticism or anything else amen that the word of God might be fulfilled do you realize that John had to overcome amen the Mind Battle of being criticized for baptizing Jesus brother he had to overcome that but when he realized that it becometh him to take a stand and taking a stand to fulfill the word of God he said let them criticize let them say what they want to I'll Stand for God and left a world go by I said like this Jesus desire should be our desire you say preacher what was his desire brother his desire was to fulfill the word that was written concerning him that's why he said amen suffer it to be so for now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness amen can I preach you a little bit amen it becometh us look at this word becometh it means beely oh brother Wade to stand out when Jesus told John it's now now now are you seeing where I'm going when Jesus told John it's becoming of us brother Bobby was saying John it falls our it falls our lot to stand out to be conspicuous to be imminent to be seemly to be fit in Hebrews 2:9 Paul says but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels what was Jesus he was conspicuous he was made to stand out from the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man look at verse 10 for it became him it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons un glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect suffering listen Church it became him in other other words young people amen it behooves us it falls our lot to fulfill all righteousness that's why David said thou maintain us my lot and in verse number six in Psalm 16:6 he said and thy lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places thy lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places yay I have a goodly Heritage brother should remember me and the days are numbered my L is set my lot is set someday that's going to squeeze the body and the life of my body and I've got to meet Jesus another place oh you know in speaking the horses you know putting the Bridal on them they know the work was coming well I'm just glad the Lord makes us a Workhorse so we can work in it so we're never too tired to do something we're never too tired to do something for the Lord if it falls our laot to do listen young people you ain't got to go to some counselor Amen to find your laot life you ain't got to search

thing you got to do is come face to face with God and recognize you got a position you got a purpose you got a lot you got something to do so you got to get off your excuses you got to get off well I

reason for being is to fulfill the word I rebuke them mind battles I rebuke them right here right now in the name of Jesus Christ they shall not have authority they shall not have free reign in the

place the devil belongs underneath your foot then put put your foot on that devil put that devil in his place show him who you are you're a Son of God you're a messiah at you're a part of the heritage of God now I'm I'm going to take a few minutes here and I'm going to hurry but I'm going to lay this out to you Noah knew his day Noah knew his position and you know what Noah knew he knew brother it was becoming of him to build the ark he knew the plan for his day Noah was criticized but listen what the prophet of God said he said no matter how much they say there's so there's such there's no such a thing as the Holy Ghost there's no such a thing as Divine Healing it behooveth us it is becoming to us us that we fulfill all righteousness are you ready for this that we stand in this hour of trial and pound away if the Ark of the Lord what are you saying preacher I'm saying this what is becoming to the believer that's right is Unbecoming to the critic and what is Unbecoming to the critic is becoming to the believer that's why Peter said amen knowing this first that there shall come in the last day scoffers who will walk after their own lust Jude 1:16 there are murmurous complainers I hope they're not here murmurous complainers walking after their own lust and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of Advantage but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before the Apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time we should who should walk after their own ungodly lust can I say this to you it becometh Ju Just as it become John to baptize Jesus it becometh the critic to criticize it falls their lot that's what they was brought on the earth to do was criticize well brother Andre I tell you what well these days bless his name when they quit criticizing me I'm going to do something for god well I'll see you in another 10 years if time terries and you'll still be saying the same thing because the critic is never going to stop criticizing no matter if you called them up and ask them how they wanted it done and did everything to the tea they would still find some little something that didn't get done and they would criticize you but you got to learn to walk as a Believer and if you're going to walk as a Believer you got to walk unconscious of criticism the Bible said that Jesus had given us an example that we should do unto others as he has done to you remember said now watch are you ready for this anybody ever been criticized three of you four of you you ever been criticized he said when he came in the world when there was more as much belief in this world right then as there ever was it didn't even slow him up he went right on preaching just the same healing just the same it never bothered him there was critics the man was criticized from the time he was a baby until he died on the cross did it stop him no sir well let me say this if criticism didn't stop the head it will not stop the body right if criticism didn't stop Mr Jesus Christ it will not stop Mrs Jesus it was becoming of Daniel Amen it was becoming of Daniel to stand for the word in the face of idolatry amen it it's becoming of a Christian to be it's it's Unbecoming of a Christian to be ashamed I love what Paul says he says listen church I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ it is the power of God and the Salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek brother said because it's becoming to a Christian not to be ashamed of your religion come on young people lose your lose your embarrassment of this message lose your embarrassment of the church you go to come on I'm going to preach to you a me you got to lose that you got to quit getting all blushy all all red face when somebody ask you what you believe come on you got to take a stand and you got to let this world know I believe this message I and you got to know what you believe from the Bible so you can back every devil the Corner up and say this is not a man's idea this is not following men's words for Advantage this is following Vindicated word it's a it's a oh God and I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed of this Prophet I might as well go and attack another devil while I'm here and don't ever be ashamed of the church God put you in can I take some Liberty don't you ever be ashamed if God puts you in a word-based message teaching Holy Ghost filled fire baptized church that believes this message and gives this message pray don't you let some devil of carnal comparisons amen anoint you to compare your church with some other church and say well if this church they do this and if that church well I'm here I might as well preach and now it's got down to where well if this church ain't doing this it's a dead church and if that church ain't doing this amen but when in God's name that we put the measuring stick in the hand of some preacher to identify what his life and what is death what identifies life and what identifies death is the message of the hour and if the church is in the word of God you ought to get behind the vision it's a devil that crawled out of the pits of Hell of carnal comparisons that's right they don't do it like we do well they ain't you listen I've been evangelizing I started preaching when I was 13 I've been been traveling since I was 16 by myself on the road preaching I've preached in churches God's given me Grace to preach in churches all over this world but you know what I can't do I cannot come to Lula and see how they do at Lula and go to go to go to Alabama and tell them how to do it in Alabama like they did in Lula come on church I cannot go to Canada and tell them to do it in Canada like we do it in Virginia every church is Sovereign in itself you know what brings us on the same page is the message of the hour so if we're all preaching the message then we ought to be able to go in each other's church and have good Fellowship because the basis of Fellowship I hope this okay the basis of Fellowship is the message that's why Paul was saying don't you ever be ashamed of the Gospel that's what you are not ashamed of the Gospel it's the thing are you ready for this it's the thing that holds in the hours when the ship is a rocking and ever stars out aside and the moon and the stars and the storms are blowing but it still holds it's the Gospel of Jesus Jesus Christ in Genesis 22 it was becoming of Abraham when he walked up there to sacrifice Isaac it was becoming of Abraham to separate from unbelief in Acts the 2 chapter it was becoming of the disciples at Pentecost to go to the upper room and to receive power in Acts three it was becoming of Peter and of John to speak the word over the lame man at the gate called Beautiful amen it fail their lot now I'm going to close on this one brother said look here at Enoch in paragraph 126 it becometh us to fulfill our is this okay to fulfill all righteousness in the days of Enoch just before the flood when Enoch looked out there and saw Noah building the way on the ark Enoch was a prophet now watch Enoch knew that he was a type Enoch knew that he was a typ and he knew that before the floods came that he had to give an example so one after noon it was becoming to him to take a walk brother brother Wade it was becoming of Enoch it fell his lot it behooved him it was conspicuous of him to be to be translated without seeing death because Enoch knew he was a type of rapture Amen to go before the floods came can I can I can I can I lay some word to you young people it's in Genesis 5:22 the Bible said that Enoch walked with God after he begat methus 300 years and he begat Sons and Daughters listen Enoch was a family man he had a wife he had babies he had grandbabies but all the days of Enoch were 365 years but in all that brother brother in all that Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him you know what Enoch means it means dedicated you know what no matter how dedicated Enoch was he was still in a battle you know what he did he battled with the position listen sometimes we're going to battle with the position that God called us to but Enoch was an example that whatever position God calls you to you can walk with God if he calls you to be a preacher you got to walk with God if he calls you to be a Sunday school teacher you got to walk with God if he calls you to be a housewife come on Church you got to walk with God because how was Enoch walking brother Lis my faith my faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before somebody preached with me now before before before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God not after he was translated but before he was translated he could testify that his life was pleasing to God you know what the prophet of God said he said faith is unconscious you've got faith and don't even know it that's right Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm and The gales were knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in the face of masses of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him that's right whether it's going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he know it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say oh wonder if I prayed through wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if I did this he

becoming of him to do so you ready for this he didn't want to leave Enoch didn't want to leave but yet it was becoming to him to fulfill all righteousness because he was a type of the church today he was the type of the church that's going to take an afternoon stroll we're going to strike the King's Highway and Away we'll go it was becoming of every one in the Bible to stand in can I say this to you now somebody say now now it's becoming of us to stand he said now it's becoming to us in this day we know we've just been through the church ages we know we've receive the Holy Ghost we know that

signs and wonders and nobody can say it isn't so he's here now he's here in the church he's in the people no nobody can say is and so we know he's here so it behooveth us to take his word it behooveth us to believe all righteousness it's behooving to us it's becoming to us that we fulfill everything he spoke of the church is weak the churches of today he said but we know that with same Pillar of Fire that led Israel that same Ministry that accompanied Jesus Christ by that Pillar of Fire that had him anointed is accompaning the church today Sciences proved it we didn't need that but God proved it we need the ministry of Jesus Christ to fit that headstone coming Yonder that's brought the church into a place where this ministry is exactly like it was when Jesus left let our musicians come this afternoon what are you saying preacher I'm saying it's your turn to stand Noah stood Enoch stood Daniel stood Paul stood Peter stood brother brandom stood right now it's your turn to stand it's your turn to stand won you won't you stand with us this this afternoon it's your turn to stand you know I want I want to leave this with you right here when you brother B says it very beautiful he says now when you say I believe Jesus Christ is my healer I believe this morning he's going to heal my sick body some something told me to come to church I'm here among the Believers I'm taking my stand this morning I believe it I'm going up to be prayed for now when I'm prayed for there on that stand I'll remain no matter how dark it gets or where it's at it's what I want that's what I want you to take home with you church I'll still stand on that stand amen I'll still stand on that stand you took your stand because it's becoming to you and after you once made a confession you must stay with your confession that's right it's behooving you as a Christian as a Believer to stay with your conviction don't let the devil push you off here and there you're always muddied up you're always off the main road you're always in and out that's why you can't stay nowhere you can't have confidence in yourself or you can't no one can have confidence in you you got to stand and when you've done all you can do to stand then stand am just keep on standing that's right we must do that it's becoming to us it's behooving us that we do it how many can say I want to stand amen yes I take my stand my position is my stand amen my position my inheritance will not be taken from me I gon't take my stand Peter did that's right Enoch did you said brother Andre all had it easy they were Bible characters they had it all they had it all easy brother Zach I mean it was just easy for them what do you do when brother B said Enoch didn't want to leave that's right do you realize Enoch left his family when he didn't want to to fulfill a type for you cuz there had to be a type for the seventh from Adam to take a change one day without seeing death there had to be somebody walk like Enoch walked there had to be there had to be somebody so it fa Enoch's lot to do it right and he didn't want to leave his family he didn't want to leave his wife he loved his home probably but he had to walk what are he saying I'm saying there's going to be times you got to do things right you don't want to do but it behooves you to do it part of your lot so what do you do not do it and not fulfill the will of God or say Lord I'm gonna put my nose to it I've been anointed to fulfill this position there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a new heavens and a new Earth there's going to be a body change that's right there's going to be a married supper of the lamb and only the righteous will be there can I say it this way only the ones who fulfilled his word in the age and day they were living will be a part of it how many say Lord give me courage Lord give me courage give me courage sometimes I just get to thinking brother Bob where would we be had people give up their stand that's right where would we be I think about you in this church where would you be today if brother Dale give up his stand somewhere along the way just backed up a little bit and said well you know I guess we could probably re it but he stood there declaring this message you know why because it fail his lot well it falls your lot to stand in your home to uphold convictions in your home I don't know why I'm here but I'm here on this point right here do not tamper with an eternally right word for a temporary situation don't tamper with it well brother we're just going to change a few things here in the message in the word we're going to do a few things yeah I had a guy tell me that one time he said oh God get in trouble he told me he said yeah he said brother and he said I got television I said oh really he said yeah he said yeah when I was he said my son growing up he said I think he had like three or four or five boys you know had some Sons he said yeah he said I had a my son he said he wanted television he said we wouldn't get one because you know brother BR taught not to have one I said yeah that's what he taught and he said well I got one I said Well why'd you do that he said well I found out my son was going over to other people's houses watching it and so he thought well I just bring one in the house and he can watch it here and we'll be at least be know what he's watching you know I'm sitting there scratching my head I'm thinking they're all out of the house and the television's still in there hello we'll just give up a little bit here and it's okay and then before long the devil gets a foothold yes come on Daddy makeup comes in your home you might as well stand with a prophet CU we got to go eat the message is Right

worshipers arise let the sons and the daughters see I'm surrendering my arm I surrender to the king wonderful [Music] message Father I he GL the song of your redeem of your redeem as the you God has never been never been without a generation of Bel never from our heart never been a gap been gaps of different things in life different things happen but they never been to Gap there's always a generation of people that will let the worshipers AR sing it to him oh let your sons and your daughters see I'm surrendering my way I surrender to the king let the worshippers arise let the worshipers

Rapture in the body change I'm surrender I surrender to the king amen you love the Lord let the worshipper arise come up out of this place but I was thinking when you was preaching I thought man that's true God has never there's always been a cycle of God somewhere on the earth amen may not have been in your generation at where you were standing but in somebody's generation there always was a bride amen when he come on the day of Pentecost he never put a gap anywhere because God's moving all the time yes sir he's moving he's moving through his people and you think well who well if you figure out it's you then you don't have to worry about anybody else amen Enoch kind of figured out he said well there's something going on here and I I I I don't know I don't know what's going on I got to walk but I got to go amen because the Bible said he walked with God he didn't so now he walked with God and he was not cuz God took him well that's what he's doing in the every generation God took a people but he's going to take a people by a body change correct destroying death where they stand on their own two feet right could be a young kid could be an old guy it really doesn't matter amen right what does that matter to God but we're heading toward something we're walking as our brother said this it's a paradox though Paul said let's run but our brother said let's stand well that's the same identical thing that's right cuz you're not standing sleeping you're you're taking a stand on what you believe right amen and as we move forward you take a stand as you move forward like I said Every Generation I Got a little sermon on that that's good every generation though Enoch left his generation but there was still a generation the people that came through methusa all the different ones and that's why the Bible gives you genealogy tells you that God has been he's just there's a big strand of God that just he just pulled it out and said I'm going to have people everywhere there's not going to be a gap and I'm going to put the best at the last that's right that's right I'm going to put the best at the last that can handle it that can take it ain't it took it then we're going to take it now but it's by listening to the word of God it's the washing of the Water by the word you're not going to get it any other way you going to get you're going to get washed by the word can't get it set in at home no no you got to get under the fountain that's right this is the fountain that's right elij our brother said the the message of the hour is what we stand on and if it's true then we're true that's right amen I like what brother Ernie Bill W always said he said we have plugged oursel into the Eternal and that's what I like cuz it's the Eternal and you decide and you plug yourself into that well guess what that does that puts the current back inside of you amen and makes you oh wow anytime you touch Eternal eternity is the only thing that can come from it amen so we we have we have plugged oursel into the Eternal and then we're just Eternal people that think different talk different act different and we look different yes sir amen so let's give our brother another big hand and God bless him he's always poured his heart out he's always been a um somebody that stands for the truth and I appreciate that and and um always have appreciated him since he was I've known him since he was about 14 years old when somebody when brother uh Bill y had to haul him around to preach I remember that kid so it but he stood for the word even as a young kid when
