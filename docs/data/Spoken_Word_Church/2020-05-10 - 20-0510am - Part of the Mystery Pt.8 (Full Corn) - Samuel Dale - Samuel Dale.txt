everybody in the house we would not be able to see downstairs or you know my cat but we sure there's some dire seating and because they're missing from up here so that's the part that we have to do to try to make everything do we're gonna try to to abide by as much of rules and regulations and things as they put on until it gets to a point of where it's crossing the wrong time we we try to do the best we can so we put up with it and everything like that so just we appreciate it glad to see the sisters here close there we've been missing you know we have we had services and all and we've done real good and you know and the Lord's blessed us and everything but we still miss our wives and miss the children and and all of the ones that in order to be here we're glad you here now and as far as what we're doing from that day on we will be running regular services like we were from you know Wednesdays and in Sundays and dice so that'll put it to where you can make your schedule to make everything right or what you're doing we're just trying to serve the Lord and to do what we can make sure now that you follow the Deacons and the things they're set to word that everything is right - were you coming in going out and all like that make sure all of that is done correctly and don't just window service in don't just turn and start out like we've been at it we're going to have to keep from being that big crowd going back so the Deacons and things will come to the rose you know we're gonna be uptown we're gonna escort you out so don't go don't turn and run out you know wait until somebody comes to escort you out the door and let's go down that way it won't be everybody crowded at once you know and remember what we're trying to do as much as possible to stay you know so much apart whatever we can do until things change on that so keep all of this in my know don't be trying to I've always been one in this is this is contrary to my rule because I'm I'm the kind of a person to always have been wanted to - welcome to people and greet you and I've been a lot of places and this is way back and shook hands with people and hugged her neck when found out later they didn't believe in that you know what it didn't take long I got him to believe it in it or at least they abided by it and done it you know because they would do it with me but you know just trying to make you contact as much as least as you can and everything with each other and talk and fellowship together but try to do everything you don't have to get out there and spin round and around to try to find out who's closest to you just just be you know let everything be done decently and in order to where we can do it all right if you like turning you scriptures turning mark the fourth chapter of Mark and then we're gonna go to Hebrews 1140 so there's any other announcements happy mother's day and I've got all of that down here so we thank you for all of the mothers we appreciate all of you that has been to the part we we're gonna try to speak on a last part of our message if we can today and it will be related to you'll still be related to the sisters of the church alright so if you'd like to follow along with and in mark for father we thank you for your grace in your love we thank you for the day in the hour that we have thank you for being you we just ask you now that you'd come among us Lord and should be with us thank you for the opportunity for the sisters and all the others to be I gathered together to where we can be in fellowship together in you together in a house where we can call it your place that you asked you we set it aside for you so you just take care of it you keep all of the sicknesses away from the people and everything Lord remember those that are the different ones Lord brother Kali brother Daugherty and and sister Gianni and sister Jean Lord be with them be with other Dale and sister Mary all of these Lord just remember each one and just take care of and just keep those old sicknesses away from your little bride around the world because that's your promise to us that you said you wouldn't let the enemy come in and take over so we believe you and we trust you and we depend upon you have your way forgive our sins and lead us by thy grace and love in Jesus name we're gonna go to mark this is where we used but we'll try to tie it together and bring the message to a close if we can mark for verse 26 and he he said Joy's the kingdom of God as if a man should catch seed into the ground he should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring for spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bring forth fruit of herself first the blade then the corn after that the full ear in full corn in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put us in the sickle because the harvest is come now you see what if somebody's it's gonna be there when it comes to this fool corn in the ear then the sickle is placed in together all right now Hebrews 11 40 was the scripture we used for many many many many services but God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word you know I I do see something there's this the families are sitting together and sometimes you know you you look around and you see in in the regular services we'd see one over here and one over here one back there and one over here everybody didn't have a regular seat like that they just sat down where they wanted to but this is kind of putting maybe a little little contact into the point but what I want to do now today I want if I can in you know how that is maybe ten more services but I want to try to bring this series to kind of conclusion that we've been talking about for many months and I earn Hebrews 1140 that they without us could not be made perfect and the whole everything we know is groaning according to Romans 8 waiting for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of the Living God and you know a time is here it has to be a place a position or something we're not saying the end of the world is here we've never taught nothing like that we've always just kind of held things to be what it is but there will be an end of all things and I do believe that we're in the end and that a lot of this that's going on now among the world around the world you know I say that it is the plagues and the things that was spoke up by the Bible and spoke about a prophet to come you know and how things would be here in our last days or but we are not a doomsday quit this or scared to death we ought to be the happiest people in the world now I mean that's as honest as I can make it we ought to be a Christian or to be the happiest time now of any time you've ever been in the message because we're here to end how long that's not a business but we're here at the end of all things has come upon us and and this happening and and all like that and just watch it around the world I wouldn't be talking you've never heard me say things like that but you've never seen a time when the entire world was affected by the situation the way it is now and you know so that has to be meaning that if satire is finishing we're at the end of all things we're not worried as I said we should be happy and say thank you Lord come and finish up what's to be done and get us out of here we look for this we've longed for this we started with our Christian journey and the baptism of the holy ghost in our heart to be happy and joyous that no matter how bad the situation gets life in troubles and everything it's still it's there for us to be happy because we're Christians we're born again believers we're in in and being in the place you know that God can come and live in us and get this finished up so that's that we should be thrilled about it instead of sad about it you know oh now humanly speaking we don't know what's going on I don't claim to know that's that's worth you know I don't claim to know this is though and so this is the one from there no no we just walk day by day and just me what it is now and then we'll it'll finish up and God will make it manifest we're supposed to be all right but we're going to try to speak a little message you to be related to mother's day because we appreciate all of your you the mothers of the church because you know it is a wonderful situation and I've made my emphases I hope over the years on enough to to get you to realize that we really appreciate true Christian sisters now that's something to have children do you know that can look to their parents and see in their parents you know the love of God and trying to raise them into being sons and daughters of God to to be you know good people that's what our point is is always have being a lot of emphasis is made in the Bible especially after we came into the message we didn't you know we study the things we talk about the things while we were there in their denominations but ever since I've been in the message the emphasis is more to the sisters alright because it is the basis that you are the mothers of each one you know and it's your part you you're doing your part and all like that like I always tell you you know you go down to Walmart and you walk around old man he walks around it didn't matter you know he did it how he looks I mean you know and all like that and George did get onto me one time because I had my pants my painting pants on and I was in Walmart walking around but still you know not it's not a lot said about that but when a sister's walk down through Walmart or anywhere they're recognized the higher the dress the the mannerisms the things you know are dressed and honored and welcomed among people because it is a you know you are the the mothers of all and it was connected and it see I've always even taught you this that see that you say well that Adam was the first creation that's right but without Eve there would have been nothing to taking place without a woman of a woman to put into the position you wouldn't had no word about naming animals or what you're doing or what everything was to be done you wouldn't have to worry about what this is or that is but then when you put the woman in there you know we we get into a lot in the message ranks that a lot is condemning the women for their ways and maybe that's true I mean if you it needs to be condemned it needs to be spoke out against alright that's true you know if women are not dressing right and acting right you know looking right and trying to be what they're supposed to be there ought to be rebuked you know it ought to be but what about the men - they just don't leave us men out because see we've got our part to go - all right but that's the point I want you to think about today because we we have spent quite a while talking you know speaking about the bases of day without us cannot be made perfect all right we went through that covered in many many different ways and avenues and coming to find out that you know the whole world is now waiting on you and I what about that the whole world everything you do you think the natural world out there today if they knew who it was that was you know it's horrible right it's horrible I mean deaths on everything all the way around the world but you just think what it would be if the little bride wouldn't here right you realize that there right now saying if they knew what they was doing they would be glorying and they'd be bowing down to you and and saying you know stay here with us because without you being here we don't have no hopes all right because there's no oh no what would you call it no promise to the world of anything it's only promise to the bride all right and see that little bride then she's she should be honored she should be as I tried to emphasize during one of the messages you know when you go through a wedding then the hold for session or what you call it the whole thing is related around the bride and her coming in and her dress in her clothes you know everything you know it's all pointing toward her well that's that's a great honor that's a great time that we we should honor it like that alright but you see that goes from the natural now into the spiritual okay from the natural to the spiritual in the spiritual I believe God's waiting on this bride that's what you're probably says he's waiting on you and I well why can't we believe that that and not be down and out about the times and situations but to realize that he is there with us no matter what he's promised to be there all right and I've never seen him fail have you I mean we've seen him everything in the world to come forth and and manifest itself in our day well there's no need of getting down and out about it now on you know and all but to be happy in God to realize that this has happened to which to be all right just get that little point of your mind that's getting that's the thought I have to use the sisters we honor you we cherish you and all and we don't have to put it we don't do everything here you know we we try to do it on the basis of sisters we count sisters and sisters you don't have to be a mama to be a sister you know that's that's that's not the point you don't have to be that way you can can you know you're a sister in Christ all right and we honor you young old or whatever we honor the sisters because you are cherished among us so thank on that alright now what I want you to think on is a situation that brother branham I ask you to read our to study listening the masterpiece and there's two of them only seeds not our with shucks I ask you to go through them and read them and study them and then let's talk a little bit about it because after all of the foundational part I'll make it as an F to you if it is true that the whole world is waiting on the Bride of Christ alright if it's true that all the world's waiting on the sons and daughters of the Living God alright then in them waiting on that to manifest who we are see then that little bride is the most valued part there is but to find her day all right we went through talking about the broad across we don't as I said we don't just pound on the women and glory on the men we we talk about the body of Christ the Bride of Christ which is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ which is male and female we're all feminine in the body of Christ right you understand that we're all male or whatever we are we're feminine in the body of Christ our part is to be a wife not to be a husband to it to be a wife all right and to serve Him has to be that part and don't you worry about he'll serve you he'll take care of you but my point now is today is thinking about you realize without the the bride there would be no hopes without the finishing up of God's Word is my whole point okay now trying to get a thought because I didn't want to study this I put down just a few notes and just run off from a few things to hand out for you to think about something but I wanted to just speak on it has to be as from a mother's day situation and honor and you know respecting the sisters to bring it down to the finishing up of the where it says they without us cannot be made perfect all right now meaning the bride as long as she's here as we still God's gonna be here he's gonna take care of us so we don't have to worry about that we're not concerned but what we're concerned with is honoring him are are obeying him are being what he wants us to be all right and then take the message and study it from that to see what it's talking about and what I want to be talking now is you've heard the word used and if you listen to the couple of messages asking you heard Brett around and speak a lot about carriers you know he even says the denomination's were carriers then you know they were when they don't know them denomination see so you're blinking out totally what's being thought the thought that I'm trying to progress to bring to you me the Baptist was the move of God for the day the Methodist was the move of God I'm saying move of God all right you understand me they were the people of God they were a part of the body of Christ to be made manifest in the day they were living all right but yes knowing that day was more to come okay all right see then being a carrier is not a bad thing Mary carried the word right she carried the words he she brought forth the word all right the denominations for their day were carriers but we want to put it know though they're out there other than that's where you missing it you can't study the message and do like I asked you to read it you did you you read it over and over where brother Branham was talking about Luthor Wesley Pentecost and he said how that they started out the Luther started out in the right but then he denominated now not Luther the Lutheran not him he stayed with the word as much as he could until the day was dying I guess then it comes in to Wesley we talked about then come in to Azusa Street on Pentecost there were each displacing they were not the full word you say you haven't no wait a minute your area now listen to what I'm saying it says there in the scriptures that you have it this way you have this way but it says then the full corn in the ear in other words a full ear of corn a full ear of corn is not a green ear of corn either a full ear of corn is corn that's ready to be replanted if necessary it has a two-fold compart I mean part of it can be replanted right then if it's full if it's fully matured dried all right but it can also be ground up and made into bread to eat so it has a great situation me and like I've tried to tell you he's in Luther he couldn't produce all of it he done the best he could do he brought it forth and for the day it was the Word of God and the move of God for that our baddest mood in Methodists Presbyterians all kind of groups came in and they started out as being the word for that day but yet things went wrong before brother run said before they could go on and and and produce and God could come to his bride he said Satan entered there in all right that's what's happened in the last days that's why we're here so many years after the Prophet going off the same well because Satan has moved in all right and he's pounding away at this little bride now doing it in the natural but it's coming into spiritual don't worry about it it'll be here but think about it now but around cause Luther a carrier because he a carrier it means really what you're saying to line up with a spiritual application that Luther was not the full word he had the word for his day it was the seat of God for the day it was the part of the the part of the bride across for that day but he didn't go on and finish it Wesley was part of the word but he didn't go on and finish it the greatest of zeus the street was part of the word but it didn't go ahead and finish it all right so now when you're talking about something that's I'm hoping this will come to the right point but when you're talking about a carrier that's something that's taking place of are standing in awe of you know and being and do it Luther he didn't finish it Wesley didn't finish it Zeus the street didn't finish it but there's a bride in the last days it's not to be part of the work that's one malachi for luke 1730 revelation 10 seven had to come into being that's why the prophet had to come to bring the message his message was to bring the bride to the full maturity not if there was anything wrong i would i'm right here standing and i would have been happy to been brought forth in the days of martin luther if I'd have been in the word of that day wouldn't you I would have been glad to have done I've been glad to bring for God to put me in any age as long as I'm part of the pride of that age all right you get one gone by it doesn't matter what it a DD as long as I'm part of the bride of that age I'm happy to be what I am but then I'm happy that he chose me to be what I am you realize he chose you to be to finish this thing up he chose you to be the word not saying that Luther wasn't the word when it was just part word he proved it by the fact that that went on denominated and died off all right see it proved what it was but next thing would come Wesley next would come and proving what they were but they would die and go all because there was not the full word but somebody's not gonna die you remember now that we tried to bring that out in the message over and over they without us you realize the whole brighter Jesus Christ is hinged upon whether or not somebody can receive the word and believe it and become it for where we're at right now Luther's word was great Wesley's was great Pentecost was great I'd have been happy to been in any of those ages you say well I wouldn't want to been back on them Pentecostals no I would have I'd have been happy if God chose me for that age but he didn't choose me for that he chose me for the endtime he chose you to be here he chose a prophet to bring a message but he chose a bride you remember how we brought it out in the life service now even right was the sheath waive all right now what what was the purpose of the sheath wave whatever was standing there waving to remember the high priest when we started off in the first turn Canaan then it got into individuals life to them but there was that sheaf being waved to show that there was a whole field full of wheat you remember that see the purpose of it and so alright they without us cannot be made perfect if somebody is reaching the position then it shows that the rest of the field is there when the Prophet brought his message I don't care if it's 50 years later you know from the time he went off the same the message is still alive that's the greatest of all the message is still alive to the people of the end time that believe it and they're thanking God for those that are really into the word because why because we're not to be just part of the word the last age is not to be just part remember out I was thinking on the I will restore the years of the cankerworm locust caterpillar no he promised to restore it all right and to go into that you go into what Wade was talking about see that you've got three stages and then you got to go into the fourth to finish in our day because number four is sure you can call number four an antichrist number but it's also a restoration it's a number of restoration you got four combat beasts I'd hate to take out the fourth one when you when you hate to take out if you say well well that we don't want that to be for a number so we're gonna take one out make sure you don't take the last one out for heaven's sake you'd be in a lot of trouble right alright but are you following my point my point is one thing a carrier can be a part of anything all right it carries that own it takes it forth just like in the in the garden you got in the garden elder ways got doing there's a house in the corn to about that heisting all right now it don't look like corn it does to our mentality of our words and thoughts it looks like corn it don't look like you know okra beans or whatever would get the point but it's not it's not full it won't be full until it's the full corn in the ear and as I said a moment ago it won't be full until you've got an ear of corn that is capable of the two-part thing one either to be replanted and come forth or to be ground up to make bread you couldn't do that in any age now are you listening you'll see that what it means but the profit would be over and over keep on talking about a parked Luther name was a part of this but there has to be an age when it's a full of it it's all coming to full maturity alright and in doing that it in the day when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for the and to realize that if there is to be an end time it must be here if not who worth it coming from all right so you don't go and touch the corn right wait look how do you say well what wait you what do you got there I got some corn well that don't look like corn it does in the stage where it's at in part cause these two shoots front uh but it don't look like an ear of corn and if you don't get nothing out of the message that just remember that one time - been talking about the word of God in its fullness you got to be able to plant what you've got or eat what you got you know you've got to be you got to have it - the basis that you can see the day in the hour that you're living and that day an hour is it's putting it to the basis of the word Luther had the word of his age right but he didn't have the full maturity of your he was just the two shoots - running up or something you know uh-huh you say that's corn sure that's corn but don't watch out and gather it you got to wait until everything comes to full maturity once it comes to full maturity then you've got a full ear of corn ready to be either ground to make food are to be eaten you know as to what you need to do of it I want that part in your mind and you'll see why brother branham would call them carriers I remember when I first heard him making no statements I thought and they don't sound right to say that Luther was a carrier Wesley was a carrier and he even says Mary who represent Azusa Street that Mary was a carrier he said she was not the seed and listen to it said the seed was in her she's not the mother of God he said the seed was in Mary right she gave birth to the seat but that didn't make her the full-grown seed either come on you got to get Jesus Christ Burt which means the full word what is the full word you know what the last of masterpiece and look at him as he's talking about the seals and the opening of the seals and the things that's coming forth and how that is coming into full maturity in this day because this is not a carrier the day is not a carrier come on now listen to what your prophet said so I've got them here if you want me to really there's nothing pipes Mary there's no other move come on you say yeah but what you're getting the point but listen there is no women no mother no point of Pais Mary she's the life because she gives birth to Jesus Christ Azusa Street was the last manifestation to give birth to Jesus Christ and they did but that didn't make them Jesus Christ didn't make them God but somebody's got to have that other there is a life stage to be made manifest somebody has got to be there there had to be a people to manifest Luther's message right they had to be a group of people to manifest Wesley's message right they had to be a people to manifest Zeus the street Pentecost right all right come on there's got to be somebody to my manifests the full Word of God you've had your prophet he's coming down his part he's manifest in his whole part it was done is his day is finished uh-huh see if there's not another woman to be able to put it there because Mary was the lies the Prophet said there's no manifestation pipes Mary as far as people that's why you got oh is it Hagar Sarah and Mary that's as far as you go because see you got to go justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then the word right and see then that's what it is not carriers in this day we're not a carrier I know that's gonna go hard on a lot of people's thinking because you're gonna you're thinking I'm trying to make something greater than what Lutheran Westland I am so get on to it listen the Word of God is the great thing the Word of God in this day we are the people to make manifest the last move that there is to the Gentile dispensation are you following me somebody's got to make it none of this somebody's got to be that life spark but the live part can't be a carrier because the carrier would always signify part and not a fullness see brother Branham said and one of them said when the bride begins to say I and my father one of these other things that's why they gonna come after you they wasn't trying to come after the people back in the Old Testament but when the Lord Jesus stepped out to her and said I and my father are one that was ready to kill him because they knew what he meant alright now if you'll listen swallow if you think it'll ever be a persecution unto the people of this bride in any form to try to do then realize what you're doing something's got to bring that to PI's do you go to bring it down on your own self if you don't know it by being what you are is going to bring the church system after us it's not what is it somebody tell me I'm frightened appreciate 50 years what one thing to know that the bride of Jesus Christ what you and I the preaching the living the doing that we bring in this day is going to bring the world after us right they're going to bring it after us they're gonna they're gonna try their best to close us out well because we're going to preach contrary to them now if you don't understand what I'm saying listen you'd never hear a denominational person claiming two denominations were carriers do you think the Pentecostals would say they were just carriers brother Brown said that's what it was he said the Baptist was carriers the messages you know read the book carriers of the word but somebody's got to be the word the full word because that's what the scripture said that we read the full ear the full corn in the ear now Luther named manifested today they were living there there was Arthur that was the time of the hour they were living and they made it manifest and God honored out sees in it denominated and died because they didn't go on with this life stay there's no place to denominated run run said you came to nominate this medicine he said now they'll organ and I organized it into lady osya which you came to nominate this message well cuz it's back to the word how can you denominator word you can de nominate anything that stays in the line of carriers because that's the only part word but when it comes to the point that you come to the peer work there's no carriers involved it's finished the bride of Jesus Christ is standing here in the last days to finish up to finish up what did brother Branham say it this way he said listen he spoke original see he said Jesus never finished his work while he was here you remember that he said there was things that he didn't finish he said yeah he did no he didn't he didn't finish the message brother Branham come to finish the message more than the Lord you're gonna swallow harder take this one down we're taking but a random come to the point of a finishing of the message more than even the point of the Lord Jesus why because it wasn't I'm the Lord Jesus preached the seals right come on when he couldn't make it manifest why cause it wouldn't I'm right where was it to be telling ya if he had a brought that forth and finished it up you wouldn't have Malachi 4 in Luke 17 13 I like that you wouldn't have those things to be involved come on but he brought the word that was to be brought left it in that form until the Prophet could come in the last days and take us on into the full word the full maturity right of the coin then how many of you remember what we talked about the other day about it see when the children of Israel entered Canaan land they ate of the old corn of the land I preached that about 40 years ago the old corn of the land the manna ceased Ricci Bible the manna ceased the manner that carried them through the wilderness all the time that they live by when they entered the land of Canaan the Bible says the banner ceased why because the old corn is a greater deeper depth of the word it's not as wrong it's a deeper depth of God's Word it was full maturity you got to get into the promised land Cana was the promised land which was a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost with what followers the baptism of the Holy Ghost then into the word right so that's why you see say the four is see I know I've had discussions with people Oh forth Antichrist quote brother branham before is also restoration cankerworm palm warm local caterpillar justification st. kidding baptism holy ghost and the full word adoptions statute of perfect man the things you want to use making it too that way but listen the old corn the old corn is a fool gathered ear come on like I said do you mean you know you don't think maybe a lot of times about it but maybe an old farmer think more about it you know you need some corn bread you look out in the field and you see a whole field full of corn they go here's this big you know yelling sweet and I'm gonna try and get me some of that and cook me some corn bread you're gonna mess up you you can go cook what you got out there and you can eat what you got out there and live by what you got out there but when they come to the old corner of the land that was the land was ready to be gathered you don't gather in mature corn come on you said I'm going out here and get me some corn us good but you're gonna need it right to in or it's gonna rotten you take the good corn you got to wait til this like November here the most people wouldn't even think about that you don't you don't think but November somewhere wrong in there it's in our area your corn starts getting to enough that you could go out there and pull it off the stock but remember because you pull it off stock you better not taking a burn to the grinder even though it's dry where they ain't dry enough you know what you're doing we put it in the barn spread it out because you don't let it be green if it's green it's gone rotten mess up so you spread it out in your barn and left it for another month or two then you could go gather it pick that up and take it down to the meal and having ground up it's got to be fully gratefully ground able that's what I'm trying to say you've got to get it to the basis the work can be eat our planet you can take that corn that you've got in about December somewhere in a month of that and and you can take the corn and go down and get it out of your bill and go plant it one because it's a dry tira corn its fullest in the corn it's it's done it's corn but it can also be made into bread right Zuko that's why your old corner of the land it was already done it was ready to be harvested and getting ready to be you know cooked no might still have to lay it up for a while cause it's got to be that away but when you get that part then you can eat it that's the word this message is is it should be drying it you remember what he's talking about how that be linked up in the top of the trees is your prettiest fruit thing because that's where that's the day in the hour that we're living listen sisters listen to what I'm saying I'm bragging talking about you as a a woman and representation of a bride of Jesus Christ God has been waiting on you and I he's done his job he's brought all he promised right tell me something else he's promised tell me something else in the Bible that's promised ain't no woman Pais Mary the Mary was the one that said it and when you use it in you correct huh she said be it unto me according to thy word that's what brought forth the birth of Jesus Christ when she said it anyway there's no woman out - then why because the next stage is the seed she had to give birth to the rock you burped she gave birth to the work she carried it nine months and birth the word rot but she wasn't the word that away he said no that don't sound all right you read what the prophets hidden let's say you say it so that's what he keeps saying he says Mary I know it's four or five times he said Mary is not the seed he said she was a carrier what's he talking about he's talking about it there's nothing pipes Mary well quickly she gave birth to the word that settled but you can see she was a carrier because if I'm looking at a prophet what happened to Mary when she denied the Lord Jesus as the virgin birth you'll see she was a carrier she didn't nominate heed it that's what's your profit see because see that's what happened when they worked went over and come back you know and started in and she said where was Jesus and they found him and said I must be about my father's business but I run said the biggest mistake she ever made was saying that because she was denying him to be the virgin birth he was denying the virgin birth of the word that she had given birth herself - and Jesus corrected her the word that's why brother Branham had to come in the end time for that word to be able to come back and rebuke everything he rebuked ever denomination and toria's all them and coming down especially Azusa Street rebuking them for denying the word all we got to do is just eat the word God has given it to us what else what we won't what else do you need then to just eat the word as he brings it to us you see that's one of them you know I'm like it as a mother's day because he's waiting on the bride to come to form Authority come on he's standing in revelations one but when he gets over 12 and 13 What did he say one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man Girt about the paps with a golden girdle but one said that was the bride so everything has been waiting on the bride and you are that bride when are we gonna realize that I'm say thank the Lord married to him who is the word we don't have to look for another message to come no no there's no such thing as another message to come to try to perfect the people or what it's this message made alive is a perfection this message is the word it's the fully matured word whereas Luther you would call him part word Wesley you'd call him part word even if Zeus the street you'd call it part word with bread around a wooden part word come on I said that to reading them in it he wouldn't fart word no way he brought the forward not making him the Lord Jesus Christ cuz he was not he said don't you do that but he brought the pure unadulterated word what are we waiting on maybe that's what's taking place now maybe this is the final getting ready to go away are we ready because remember now there's no move pace Mary you go back to the word remember what we've been teaching now for months the bride of Jesus Christ is the son of man the Word made flesh the bride of Jesus Christ is the fullness of the Godhead bodily we won't over and over and over it to make sure you wouldn't misunderstand but have you really listened to that you realize what I've been teaching is all of these here the bride of Jesus Christ is God made manifest in another form there has to be there has to be some body make the word live if not there's nothing to wait on the window bride realized that who she is it starts tightening up on that word Satan's don't come after so brother tell the best thing to do is this just shut up now it's like firing my bones how can I shut up how can I stop talking about something that Ford almost 50 years ago that the Lord spoke to me and showed me that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man the Word made flesh not a carrier son of man is not a carrier son of man is the word the fullness of the Godhead bodily in bride form is what's gonna bring Satan after you and I okay and we worried about whether or not they can do this or not they can do that all right but think about it do you understand what I've been saying then they without us could not be made perfect who us the bride the little bride God is looking at that little bride and he's saying just come on you remember how the prophet saw her when she was in the visions and sigh it's in one of the scene out of the show when he saw the vision of the woman you know and never he said in the last ones they was kind of getting out of line he would hollering at him to get that word lined up seeing him struggling to try to line up like on these times carriers are wonderful but they have their day but the bride she doesn't stop as a carrier she becomes the word made manifest the word made manifest is the son of man I didn't realize it we you're not listening you're trying to make son of man something else he's trying to make it some other point listen to what I'm talking about the son of man is the word why can't we say we're the word we know we're gonna start saying we're the word then you're going to see it because when the bride begins to say I my father won and these other things the shuck he said is gonna pull away well don't you think that it's kind of pulled away ain't talking about just from a Lula and a little I'm talking about worldwide from the bride because that's where it's gonna be ain't just Lula uh-huh but I'm glad to be a part of it I count myself to be a part of it I count myself to be the point that it's that I've held on for almost 50 years screaming at the church and hollers trying to get us to realize who we are but it is he that hasn't made us and not we ourselves we are as people the Sheep of his pasture whatever we are he made us that he chose us that's what I said I'm glad to be here I'd have been glad to have been in Luther's day I wouldn't have been dissatisfied with it as long as I knew I was part of the word of that day and I have no doubt whether or not I was standing by what Luther was teaching what are you talking about what are you thinking about what are you looking for well I don't know what they're gonna do I don't know we just haven't really weren't such a bad problems and all like that yeah the natural seed was only a carrier of the spiritual seed the natural seed would only a carrier or a spiritual seed topping it showing it coming down through Mary was a carrier of the word reading what he said this is from she's not our with the show taking the great thing of MU Mary she was only a carrier Mary was not the seed now you see what he's talking about the seed would be the fourth stage which is the revealed word that was the Lord Jesus Christ and still is the Lord Jesus Christ Mary she was only a carrier Mary was not the seed she was a carrier of the seed but she had nurtured brought forth out of her wound just like the show brought forth from the the wound that ordered a real seed I'm trying to find one let's see okay yeah but when you come to say I and my father are one and these other things the shuck pulls away from it but the real genuine bride Church will bring forth the entire Word of God in his fullness and its in its fullness and in its strength where he's the same yesterday today and forever the Bride of Christ we're not to be a carrier we're not to be a carrier of God's Word we are supposed to be the word that's alive in this day not a carrier the word that's alive and the day that we're living you see it's why some others day is a great thing because you see there's got to be a bride you talk about the bride of Luther Wright of Wesley bread a rod of Pinnacle but he's got to be a bride not one person not one group not one a worldwide bride is going to be the word you said well I just don't see it well no you wouldn't see it if you're standing back there with the Lord Jesus Christ when are we gonna get away from that if cold I don't see something does that mean it's not real are you about like that guy was I bad you know to get brother molten TV but no guy named dozer General Motors then bike earning the sixties you know and they went they went to the moon and everything in old dozer he said he'd it's nothing been gonna he said they it and go to the moon they just when I learned desert somewhere he said didn't believe it well you know brother Rodman what he says when they people say well I don't believe that he said it wouldn't fire you know does that put it do you enough I've told 50 years on one kind do you believe it but a bride of Jesus Christ in the last days would finish up as being the full son of man made manifest in a group of people to make her the fullness of the Godhead bodily do you believe that can you believe it cuz you see if you can believe it you're part of it if you can't believe it not part of it right I'm not trying to throw stones or slap nobody around to make them believe something I'm just trying to tell it like it is do we believe who we are I look for something else when we know where we're at and where we're standing let's see then don't worry about the enemy does this thing if it don't happen pretty quick you know what I'm talking about everybody's fussing this way and fussing that way about but you remember one time this economy can't keep going like it's going this thing can't keep running like it's running something got to take place be a perfect time for the Catholic Church to step in and pay off our debt I'm not seeing that's what they're gonna do but I'm saying that's one thing but you probably said one day they will okay I can say one day they will see then what are we gonna do who would have ever thought six months ago that you had trouble getting to church you know problems from different time who would have thought that you would have had a whole world brought to its knees not over one little virus come on church wake up at least a little bit you think one little virus that worked bothers me it's one little bug that is eaten away we can't come the palmer worm the locust the caterpillar that little bug is eating away at this message trying to destroy the fact of the word that's what I'm talking about what about Mother's Day we found that perfect mother now this message will produce a bride she'll be the word made flesh because he promised it come on musicians he promised it he said it would take place it's here appreciate these girls and all coming in and playing today and always really missed ins we missed all of you sisters you know when you're you're musicians and things like that cuz you know we were we were well we can do pretty good but it's still not as good as the is it sound today I was just setting our meditating a little bit when brother Joe walked in it was just something to listen and hear the music and hearing us back in church today back in church if they put us out we're no problem we'll find some other way I ain't worried about it they worried about what they're doing I'm concerned about what meaning you're doing as you see this is gonna prove what we are irregardless of what takes place do you agree with me this is gonna prove what we are we're gonna show what we are by what we do and how that we handle that you say what do you think I'm not saying nothing I'm just saying this is don't show what we are we're gonna prove what we are we're gonna manifest what we are going what we got less than [Music] not a carrier the real seed itself [Music] we're little bride [Music] Jesus [Music] [Applause] he touched me anybody having AIDS what about it who are you [Music] clutz my soul [Music] something [Music] gum surgery and it just won't heal up so let's just believe it let's just thank him for it right father in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our hands upon our sister living your word that by your stripes he's healed now take away the problem the hurt and the trouble for this tooth or whatever you let it be you father we love you thank you Jesus amen anybody else [Music] yeah me he touched me [Music] realize what he has made us and he's waited waited patiently on you realize who we are what we're doing oh you touched me [Music] [Applause] can you say that and just think about it you think about when he first heard she [Music] we're gonna go out remember now follow the line and do what you're told to do remember services it's coming we need a brother Bob will be ministering for us and just pray that the Lord would bless but if you don't think of nothing about the service today you think a one time there is a was a woman pipes Mary the broader crop she's here to finish this thing up it'll all be done because she is his wife she's not a carrier you ended that with Mary no carriers no more the bride of Jesus Christ now do you see one without us they cannot be made perfect this is the finish of it there's probably one from another Happy's mother's day again how many people would you think Kent is here today 85 85 people here today that's counting the ones in the car than the one here so thank you for coming thank you for for electrifying the building it's like brother Joseph was saying I believe that that's a kind of glory come in when you brought it in we've been kind of had a spark slow Shekinah glory little spark going on but you brought it all in here today so I think we've we've had a good time so a few announcements let me clarify something brother Dale is
