try not to get emotional and cry so y'all forgive me if I do cry I'm a crybaby but um when we first came here to preach um uh I didn't know that a few months later that the doctor would tell me that uh before we moved before we moved to North Carolina um the doctor diagnosed me with a condition um that he said I would have with I would have for the rest of my life and um I got discouraged and I began to accept what the doctor said you know even though the word says that God has the final say so and uh I got the I Was Defeated Within Myself um but when God wants to do something in your life he's going to send you some encouragement and that night I went to work and um it was a clip of brother uh of a pastor preaching and he said uh sometimes God allows conditions to come in your life just to see if you'd be crazy enough to believe that he'll heal you from it and of course y'all know me I'm I'm I love saying that God is going to do something Supernatural but not believing it at that time and so from that point on I took it and I ran with it and uh moved up to North Carolina and one of the conditions was it was a possibility I couldn't have children anymore and um so we were praying for a daughter and it just wasn't working out wasn't working out and we got so low to the point to where we both got depressed and broke down and um one day that one day it got really really bad and the inspiration of the Lord came at the right time and something came over me and I went to my wife and I said you tell me what you want and she said I want my babies and I said God said

to see good foreign hallelujah amen amen amen that's why we're here this morning amen we come to see the Lord Jesus amen I think I got that on hey man we'll see anyways I'm reminded of something I believe it was Dwight Moody if I'm not mistaken said a reporter or somebody came out to see him when he was speaking and uh and went back and wrote his article and told him he said I don't know why anybody would want to go see that Dwight Moody he said he's on I forget all the terms pretty much he was country you couldn't understand him he was uncouth and this and that he wasn't educated and all these things and they brought the paper in and showed showed the white and they said you know what do you think about that he just laughed he said well of course not they didn't come to see me they came to see Jesus right amen amen we want to see him that's what it's all about amen just to see the Lord Jesus Christ you know the there's there's a greater need for Jesus Christ right now than there has ever been in the world before this world is in the Sawyer come up a little bit this world is in a sorrier state than it has ever been that's good I got the thumbs up back there I think we're all right amen but we got Jesus so praise the lord we got Jesus do you love him this morning amen I'm going to say morning while I can still say this morning amen and uh brother brother Wade was so gracious to to remind me of something that brother Dan daisley said he said if you sing for an hour and a half I'm going to preach for an hour and a half you didn't quite make an hour and a half so we'll just go with that anyways but uh anyways it is good to be in church this morning amen it is wonderful to be in the house of the Lord this morning I really had a good time last night I really did it was a full a full and a fun evening for sure amen and we we made it back to the room with no problems last night even in that cold rain and it's got colder as the day went on got a little rest I feel bad for the for the ministers here though I I just can imagine that that after that last game you probably had to stick around to past midnight in the counseling sessions and everything else there's just nothing like seeing a man when they say you know who who does your wife say you are Prince Charming goofy sleepy enough Dopey and the men are all like Prince Charming Goofy Goofy Dopey sleepy anything but Prince Charming the man the look that comes over those faces at that time oh my goodness gracious it's Priceless you know really you know but I told April when all this was going on brother wait I said you know I said I'm reminded of what Jesus said he said when you go to the feast don't begin to take the seat that's the highest unless they come and put you down low right so you want to put yourself low and let them bring you back up high amen so I chose Goofy but I was wrong she said sleepy amen I still wasn't I still wanting the prince charming by no means but Sleepy's a little bit better than goofy I'll take that amen anyways it was we really had a good time really really had a good time amen and uh also I want to tell you that you know I got to be honest and tell you that brother Wade told me to take as long as I like right as long as I like this morning and uh that that usually goes to me means long you know it translates along with me but I want to try my best not to amen and uh maybe I should just cut it short and let's just have prayer meeting this morning yeah anyways or something like that but anyways seriously we did have a good time amen and uh again I just want to thank brother uh brother Wes almost at brother West brother Wade I got the W ride anyways I want to thank you brother Wade for the for the invite again hey man it has been a wonderful weekend looking forward to this morning here and um thank you guys for for everything brother Bob I really enjoyed the that that this morning I got in kind of late so forgive me for that but that's the truth we got to go beyond this old Noggin here we gotta we gotta go to where we can get a hold of a true Revelation right amen a substance Revelation this morning and the truth that's what sets us free and I say that because I also want to thank you guys for for praying for us with the the many needs that we send out via the text and the email um I know several of you guys get those and um we're all a part of the family of God you know amen I think the old saying is the family that prays together stays together right and man we got eternity together so praise the Lord amen and I believe that God is really he's answered so many of your prayers he's answered so many of your prayers and I just want to say I'm thankful and grateful for that amen I really am God is a good god he's a faithful God right he's a faithful God he's a good God Amen now just like to this morning also ask prayer for a sister there at our church again she but on that list for so long Sister Christina Doss and uh she's halfway through her 10 radiation treatments for the cancer that she's fighting and I think the doctors have already looked and said you know we're going to have to do something else we have to do something more and uh she's trying to stick around long enough for her daughter's graduation and uh and all these things man all right God is able yeah and I know that some of you guys are fighting that same devil you know I just want to tell that devil right to his ugly face and it's an ugly face you're a loser devil yeah yeah yes sir he lost that battle two thousand years ago can you just imagine what it must have been when those cruel cruel Roman whips were lashing across his back brother Branham said there were pieces of Glass and Metal and everything else embedded in the tips of those whips and with every every lash that it would it would grab hold of a piece of Flesh and just Yank A chunk of that flesh out the scripture says that my bones they stare out at me right and with every lash that he was taking at that time he was taking it for you and me I can just imagine that when you have one of them would fall across his back he would say sister Freedom that one's for you right yeah [Music] the other one to fly across his back and a piece would come off and he'd say Sister Christina that one was for you perfect good job as for all of us by his drops we are healed we are here but I just want to say like brother Jewel and brother I want you to be able to make sure you greet him for me I just want to say like brother brother Jewell says they're boo devil back and we ain't for the wildsy wildy Woos and we ain't defeated and we are not the overcome we are the overcome earth right and I just want to put that devil on that notice this morning just to say that amen you are a loser and God's already won amen and God's already won amen so praise the Lord Saints praise the Lord you just keep on standing you just keep on fighting this good fight of Faith amen God has already won this Bible this battle amen so praise the Lord I don't want to keep you standing too long here of course I've done didn't it but let's let's go ahead and take up our swords this morning I'm going to turn back to the Book of Genesis we're going to go back to the Book of Genesis and for those of you who were not at last night's couple's banquet there I say back because I read from Genesis last night too um this is just such an awesome portion of scripture really here and God puts everything in its proper order right if you want to know what the proper order for God for God is go back to Genesis and look at it he shows you exactly what it is he puts everything in his proper order there and mercy me ain't that what this world needs today you know it needs to be it needs some order to things we need to order two things here we've we've sang this song for years I believe is what this world is falling apart you tell I'm not a singer I'm so glad I got Jesus down in my heart is that right and that's the truth this world has fallen apart but you know what we can look around now today more than ever you know and before I used to love to sing that song I can sing it better when I'm in my truck by myself and and you know I used to love to sing that song and we'd go through those things he said man it is everything's falling apart but you know the day that we're in right now we look at these things we think man it's shot you know I mean it's not just it is falling apart it has fallen apart right we look around now and no matter where you look at you no matter what you Turn Your Eyes Upon it has already fallen apart the politics are gone the education system's gone the medical system is gone the supply chains are broken right the minds of the people are broken the spirits of the people are broken that's even worse it takes a 399 no 399 500 missile flying out of a 216 million dollar jet to bust a balloon I mean come on you know they they need to go see the mcculloughs down in down down in Macon we'd go down to their birthday parties and they'd let balloons loose and we'd all be sitting there go boom boom boom and blowing those balloons out you know with whatever you have they've shot more balloons down than I guess this government's ever done you know it was kind of exciting to watch it kind of go across the country though it was almost the most fun I've had since the O.J Simpson chase you know some of you are too old too young to get that some of us are too old to remember it good grief amen that's the state of things anyways I think we could stand a good old dose of God ordained order at least this time right now amen so anyways Genesis chapter two don't worry I'm not going to try to put everything back in order here this morning that would really take a long time here amen but uh hey just be sure though that the answers to put it all back in order and those those good old books you're holding in your hands right there right it's in those Bibles amen but I just thought again since this weekend you know I'm not going to try to do it all at one time but I just thought since this weekend is uh it was the couple's banquet and Tuesday is a holiday this this honoring some naked baby with wings doing flybys and shooting arrows you know and everything maybe I just take a thought this morning from Genesis where God put everything in place for the man and the woman you know the man and the woman here the man and his wife and the woman her husband and don't worry brother Wade I'm not gonna blow it up so bad that you gotta put everything back together I pray amen if I do then I will never be back but I don't want to make brother Wade mad because he's got to come back and preach for us again yeah I know I know so I'm going to title this this has already been up there for a while they twain shall be won before we read our scripture let's bow our heads right quick Heavenly Father dear God we love you this morning we love you with everything that we have in our hearts our hearts are full this morning dear God when we think of the goodness and the grace of the faithfulness Lord we think of the promises that you've give us Lord the prayers have been answered dear Lord Jesus and most of all dear God we think of the faith and the stand of the people here they couldn't do that if it were not for the Holy Ghost so Lord we just pray this morning that you would just that you would come amongst us Lord you're already here Lord but I pray that you would just just move amongst us in such a way dear God to to speak to our hearts to encourage us and help us Lord to do whatever needs to be done to do the Greater Works dear God that you promised that you would do Lord the Lord we thank you we pray that you take these words that I have Lord open them to our hearts Lord take the thoughts that are Upon My Heart Lord Jesus dear God and just deliver it in whichever way would seem pleasing to you let you speak the Lord in Jesus name we pray amen Genesis chapter 2 verse 21 and the lord caught the Lord God calls the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and here we see the great physician performed the world's first operation right the first surgery amen so verse 22 and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her into the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and they were not ashamed amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning amen so I want to start out just by looking at the uh looking at this scripture and looking at the the woman that came out of Adam or like I like to say sometimes looking at the whoa men that came out of Adam right I got in trouble for saying it that way one time years ago but the Whoa man that came out of Adam who is the spoken word Son of God right we know that it's true and and I say that he is the spoken word Son of God because Adam is eternal right he's Eternal yeah Adam was the first Earth the first Earthen vessel to have been filled with eternal life when this world was formed he is the first vessel flesh and blood vessel to have been filled with the Holy Ghost amen amen praise the Lord and the Bible tells us in Genesis chapter 2 that the Lord God formed his body Out of the Dust right and then he breathed the Breath of Life into his nostrils and he became a living Soul right amen Adam was not even called Adam until Genesis 2 when he was formed Out of the Dust which means red Ruddy you know that sort of thing it was a man that was there and that that vessel that vessel became the the the the the the holding Place amen it became the dwelling place for the life of God for the Breath of God that word breath there when you you break it down is a very simple word it means to to blow or to be blown is to cause to breathe out and also to give up life God gave up life listen to this now that don't mean that he did away with his life but he gave up life in order to be able to breathe it into the nostrils of Adam look at what he's done for you today look at the breath that he's put in you today for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son right amen yeah and he said he he breathed upon them right receive ye the Holy Ghost amen and so that's what that's what the word there literally to breathe means amen so so you know God breathed he he literally breathed into into the nostrils into this vessel he he blowed his breath into that don't tell me God's not real he's got breath right yeah he's got breath he can breathe there must be some lungs or something that can squish some breath out some way or another there was something that was that was placed into this into this vessel that we'd call Adam here correct and by the way again that word used for Life there he breathed the breath of life that word for use for Life there is the same word that God uses just two verses below there in verse nine it's the very same word that he uses there when he first speaks of the Tree of Life the first mentioned the first idea the first concept that Humanity has of something called the the tree of life amen and he takes that same life and he breathes it into that spoken word Son of God right like same life same life that was flowing through the tree life and we know who that tree of life is Jesus Christ is that tree of life it's Christ God and that same life that flowed through the Tree of Life In The Garden it's the same life which the Lord God breathed into Adam and then and that flesh and blood formation from the dust of the earth became a living Soul he was an eternal Soul which came forth from the life source of God himself come on now all right the same Life Source who is he's the word and Adam's a spoken word Son of God and that same spoken word Son of God or seed of God that was spoken Genesis 1 he placed there God said in Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and 27 and God said let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over to all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created him in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them is that right all right good and in the day that God created man in Genesis 1 in the day that God created man he created him male and female and they were created as we said last night as one unit one unit he was male she was female and they were one and there was no such thing as a wool man at the time of Genesis 1. until she came out of Adam and then when she came out of Adam oh boy we got a lot of whoa oh I'm going to get in trouble but hold on trust me here I'm not trust me I'm not a card-carrying member of the He-Man Woman Haters Club I am not you can ask my wife you know when we first got married we first got married oh my there's a lot of good stories yeah I think I think she left she has left the building when we first got married we you know actually let me back up even before we got married we were uh we were just dating that we were already we were already engaged and uh we were you know had our Whirlwind engagement and everything else and we're already engaged and we we went and I went in and visited we were going in and visiting with her sister her sister was married a couple years before we were and her brother was married just like five months before we were so we were all pretty much learning at the same time you know and again it's all about this concept of unity of of they twain shall be won right and so so we go and and we sit down and and I'll just raise a little Methodist boy as I said last night I was just raising a little Methodist boy that went to church maybe two or three times every three or four years you know that's that's kind of how we did and and you know you just you're we were just out there and and but but you know there was something in my heart that God had been pulling along right and and my wife as I said last night again she was my end she was the one that witnessed to me and and gave me the opportunity to to hear the voice of God Amen and I give her all the credit for that like I said again last night but but you know we were sitting there oh she come back in I am in trouble so sister dude said yeah you are so we're sitting there in her Sisters in my sister-in-law's house and we're sitting there and and you know again this little Methodist boy that didn't know anything about anything hardly I've been going to church for a little while and and uh and I said you know I asked Elise I said well Sister Lisa do you have do you have a Coke or something I can you know I could drink I'm kind of thirsty would you have you know something and so and she said yeah it's in the refrigerator and I'll get it and I said no no no I'll get it you know I'll get it myself I wasn't raised to let somebody do things that way I was gonna go get it now it was her kitchen I will say that But but so she said no no I'll get it I'll get it and I said no no Lisa I'll get it and you don't have to do that you we're all just having a good time and she looked at me and I'll never forget it she looked at me and she said Dutch and and the way that we believe the woman Waits on the man I was like whoa man you know that's that's pretty awesome right and she got up and she fixed me a Coke and listen I'm not even her husband but she fixed me a Coke and she gave me you know the glass of Coke and we sat there and we had a good time it wasn't long after that and April then closing her eyes here but it wasn't long after that we were married like that I said I'd like to have something this and she said you got two legs right oh I am so much trouble [Laughter] but you know I learned real fast it has to be a Unity right it's got to be a Unity it's not one way or another we had to learn you know there's a family we came together and we had to learn and this was a lesson for some maybe some of the younger ones here I don't know I see a lot of young faces here this morning you know perhaps you're thinking you know you're you're as you get up in teenage years and everything else you begin to chafe it the bit as it were you know I'm My Own I'm a man right or I'm a woman and and I can I'm grown I'm all of 13 years old and I don't know what it is where that switch was but I remember when my girls turned 13 the day they turned 13 somehow between the night when we went to bed they were 12 years old and the morning when we woke up and they were 13 somebody slipped in my house and they found a switch that I never could find and they flipped that switch and it was like the invasions of the Body Snatchers came in and they took my 12 year old girls and they placed something there I don't know what it was and man they were grown you're not going to tell me what to do you know it's lessons that you learn but as you're young the younger ones that are here and everything else don't get this idea in your head that you're going to listen I'm gonna go out I'm going to be I'm going to get married and and nobody's going to tell me what to do and and we're it's everything's gonna be easy and everything's gonna be wonderful and and you know I'm gonna get to eat all the ice cream that I want be careful you'll get a figure like mine if you do that I'm gonna be to do all these things like that but you know the thing of it is when we when we got together when we began dating and we we got you know we finally got married and everything else we I found that you know it's one thing when you're when you're one individual living under your parents house and you've got you you know the rules you might Buck the rules but you know the rules right you know what they are and they're there for a reason they are there's an order to things and it has to go a certain way right it has to go a certain way or there's chaos and God is not the author of Chaos so if what you're thinking and what you're going through is bringing chaos and everything in you need to realize listen this might not be from God God might not might not mean for me to go out and be a full-grown man when I'm 13 years old right he might not mean for me to be a full-grown woman when I'm 13 years old but there's an order there's an order that's taking place and after we you know when we came up we one thing I found was again we were taking a I was taking my life my life that had been raised up under my mom and dad and there was an order to things and and you know regardless whether I enjoyed all that order or not it was there yeah yeah but then but then you know then I come and again I find the the girl of my dreams and and we get married and but you know what she was raised up that's that and her in order too it was a different order than what my order was and the challenge was bringing these two lives together in such a way that it could produce something Godly amen and beautiful right useful something that has a purpose to it right because you say God always has a purpose if God's going to do something in your life there's a purpose for it right if you're going whatever it is that you're going through right now there's a purpose for it I know that's hard to say sometimes when we look and the pain and the hurt and the uncertainty and and life is you know life is it's not just rough life is terrible sometimes it's brutal right don't seem like there's an answer right it seems like it's full of chaos and pain and hurt and Terror and all the different things like that but I just want you to kind of step back and just realize that God is in control he is in control and there is a purpose he's actually bringing about an order to things right in order and as Christians we want God's order because we realize that God's will is best right God Knows Best God Knows Best and when it's his time for me to get out of here when it's his time when he's done with me that I'm ready for my my purpose is over I'm ready to go right I want to fulfill his purpose and I want to go home right but again I remember going through these things and trying to put all these things together and come under you know try to try to put things in in order in a seeming order that's there it's hard to do that you need the Lord you need the Holy Ghost this is hard to do that sometimes it's really really hard to do that sometimes you know I can imagine as I was trying or I don't have to imagine but I remember when we were trying to get things together before we were you know we were just fixing to be engaged we were just dating and everything else and I remember you know what the order I was seeing was that I was going to marry this beautiful lady and that we were going to go off into the sunset and it was going to be wonderful right there's not going to be any anything that's going to stand in our way hey the the sky's the limit right now I was working at a plant making like 200 a week and after we paid you after I paid everything I didn't have money for nothing but man it was going to be wonderful but there was a hurdle I had to pass I had to get over and that hurdle was her dad and I remember I remember going in and saying you know what I've got to ask for her hand in marriage I'll just old-fashioned enough to think that you still need to ask permission right now so I walked up to you one morning I got up she wasn't there I got up and we'd already discussed that I was going to talk to her dad and she was going to talk to her mom because I was more scared of her mom than I was her dad still am in a lot of ways but I remember I got up early and you know I worked second shift but I got up early one morning and it was a hot summer day and and I drove over to their house and I get out April's not even here I'm not even seeing her yet or anything wouldn't see her for the rest of the day after what I was about to do and so I go up you know I get out of the truck my whole truck and I walk up there and her dad I don't know if you know some of you know him some of you don't he he was about he was in his early 40s I think at the time and he was a man and I was not he was a mechanic he had these big old Popeye arms you know he was muscles he could pick up a a 350 and walk with it I mean the dude was a he was a horse he still is he's in better shape now than I've ever been in my life my shape is round he's still got he's still got a trim figure I don't know how he does it my wife's got good genes so I stepped out of the truck and the first thing he comes out of the shop and it's hot and he don't have his shirt on because he's working on the shop at home and there's nobody around and it's hot and he's so sweaty and those muscles are huge and I get to look into those hands I mean have you ever you know mechanics hands they're not like a normal person's hands mechanics and and concrete workers do not mess with those two individuals right I mean they got hands that could ring the bell on the whole world at one time I don't know what it is but and I walked up to him and I said I said well I'm here sir I'm here I'm gonna I'm gonna I need to I need to ask you something and he just looking at me like what is wrong with you boy and I said I I I wanna I wanna ask for for your your daughter's hand in marriage I want to marry April and he he just kind of stands there and the only word that comes out of his mouth is Mercy looking back I think he was praying that God would have mercy on me because he knew what he wanted to do right and he didn't say nothing else he didn't say anything else so I said finally I said now that I have ruined your day I'm going to get back in my truck and go home that's what I said I'm going to get back in my truck and go home and all he said I think it would be best and I hightailed it back to that truck and I'm here oh and I'm down the road April it's your turn you gotta go talk to your mama right but as I said last night I was persistent you know and we kept the course and and we finally we were married right we were married and I thought that was a big hurdle it was at the time but that was nothing to what was coming putting two pieces together we put our two little pieces together and her her brother and her sister and their their wives and their husbands they put their two little pieces together and then we tried to bring this whole family so now we had three or four families all coming together man you talk about some some hot nights on the back of the desert you know the brother Branham said Moses back there and his wife a hot-headed wife not saying my wife is hot headed don't take that wrong that came out wrong but just trying to put things together and make it work it was hard to do but I want to tell you it was worth it 34 years and three months today right we made it we made it I'm so glad that we make it there's a lot of work that goes into these things to bring two into into one in one relationship one bonding one they twang shall be one and you put these two things together and boy the fun times are on buddy right tough times Rough Waters decisions lots of discussions sometimes they get you know the voices get up a little bit and sometimes they come down a little bit sometimes this you know we we get these things and we put all this together and we call it this wonderful institution of marriage right and you know what it is wonderful yeah yeah it really is it's wonderful in the good times there's nothing like it when everything's going right yeah but you know what there's also definitely definitely nothing like it when things are not going right either amen and the Lord can bless that relationship 34 34 years or three months my goodness gracious we used to come with one of the lessons we used to have we used to come to a place and and us us people us men of the the Tatum Clan would joke and we'd say woman get in your place yeah you talk about for a smooth and righteous sell and that'll do it every time right we were kidding we really were kidding but there's nothing like that as a the the all arms start going off the blaring and everything all hands on deck I spurred directly ahead but we survived these things and again at the end I think that the success of our marriage has to do with us both it takes both one on one cannot do it alone and your brother's sitting here this this morning you need to be the husband that God meant for you to be I'm going to tell you a little bit here how to do that just just a little bit if this is okay but you need to be the husband that she needs you to be you're the one that said I do you did play time's over and sisters you got to be the wife that he needs you to be that God meant for you to be right not just that he wants you to be because sometimes us men we're stupid and we don't know what's best but you know God has a way and you as sisters you have a wisdom about you that sometimes a whole lot more than the men do about what needs to be done or what needs to be said I loved it last night one of the questions wait a minute I was told that what happened they were supposed to stay there well I'm going to anyways but I loved I loved it one of the questions there was who who is the more decisive one yes I'm just gonna go ahead and say it probably seven eights almost every one of them in there was saying her her her her I did too her yeah he'd say my goodness these bossy women no it's God puts away God put a wisdom in you right it takes both to work together right and God's able to do that and do that in such a way that the marriage works now I'm not telling you to be bossy women don't get me wrong but but you know the thing God puts this thing together so that it works amen and God God needs you to be the wife that God meant for you to be and sometimes it's to stand there and to make a decision and say you know what we need to pray more about this right maybe we need to pray more about this when the husband gets all excited about something we're going to go do this and we're going to go do that or I want this and I want that maybe the wife is the one that stands up and says whoa whoa right or it might be vice versa it could be the other way too and the woman but the the point I'm trying to make is it you need to be that spouse that God meant for you to be he gave us the order through his word they twang shall be one it takes one unit to make this thing work because if we if we go in too many times I used to work for my parents they had a they had a grocery store they had a convenience store sorry a convenience store with the gas pumps out front and these were you know this was the days when there was no such thing as self-pay I know some of you have never even lived in times when there was no self-pay it was all now I was all we I am young enough to say that the full service gas stations were almost gone at that time do you know there's places in the U.S you can go where they they have to be full stage yeah they have to there's it's against the law for you to pump your own gas New Jersey that's right I got out there as fast as I could but you would where was I going with that good grief but they did they did by the way they owned a convenience store and one thing I would see preach brother Wade one thing I would say is that people would come in you know this then they would come in they'd go up and you'd have your cars come in from two different directions and one pull up this side of the station the gas pump so this and pull up over here and the same gas pumps you know you got gas nozzles on both sides and they pull up like this and and so so the the man would get out and he'd get it say is put it in the tank and he's sitting there before cell phones too so you know they wasn't sitting here doing this number right that's what you do now right everybody gets at it when they're pumping gas they're doing this number when they're waiting in the line they're doing this number they're going down the road they're doing this number whatever and but they would sit there before that they would sit there at that tank and he would sit there and just kind of like and the wife and if you didn't know him you didn't know it was the wife but the the wife would be here on her car over here on this side facing him because you know they're they're like this so she's facing him going and it wasn't just they were mad it wasn't that they were mad you can tell when they get mad right you can tell when your spouse is mad and you can tell when somebody else's spouse is mad I know that look right but they you you there was no it was like there was no Community there was not even just no communication it's like they never they didn't even really know each other there was no relationship there there was nothing and they would put their gas in their nozzles back in the you know the tank when they're done and they'd come into the store one would walk behind the other just like strangers and they would come in there and they would wait in the line just like this he'd fiddle with something on the counter she'd fiddle with something over there he'd come up there he'd break his wallet out and he'd pay for the gas and he turned around and he'd walk out turn around and walk right past her and never even look at her and she would come up there and she would pay for her gas like that and she would turn around and follow him right out the door they would get in their cars and put them separate ways and I'd sit there and I'm thinking they're married they're married I didn't even know there was a scripture at the time saying that they twain shall be won I didn't know that I had never read that at that time but I knew something was off wouldn't you like to be in that house tonight no you talk about iceberg right but there was something that was missing and I tell you what that something that's missing and it's still missing for so many today is that it's that ability to let go of yourself to die to yourself and become one and become one this is kind of practical stuff we're talking about Valentine's Day right so it's a it's that ability to become one because without it the relationship just does not work the secret to a good marriage is first it takes both amen and the main secret to that is that both must know their positions in the one body that is who God created us to be the one body he created us to be one and I don't I'm not just you know I'm not I'm not taking that figuratively there it's a matter of speech no he said so God created Ant-Man in his own image in the image of God created he them male and female created he them and if you think there's two of them there just go over and read in Revelation Revelation where'd that come from Genesis and Revelation just go over and read in Genesis chapter 2 when God created Adam where we just read and he created him out the dust of the earth there was still just one you looked and you could only see one but there were two in that one right they were so much they were there were so much of two in that one that God had to put Adam into his sleep and sleep he did and then reach into his side I wonder how do you cut him open hmm probably just just think it's the way he just spoke God's light maybe he used laser surgery I don't know whatever how it was he reached inside and he took a rib out of his side and he closed up the flesh thereof right they were so much there was two in that one so much so that God could literally reach inside of him and pull the woman out amen come on brother that's right it's an amazing thing yeah it is an amazing thing and she became Whoa man yeah she became woman right she became woman they were created one then God separated them but I want you to notice this before the fall now I want you to notice something though that that even though with the rib being removed from his side from that there was a separation that took place between the male and the female there but I want to just point out again that separation did nothing to negate the truth that they were created one in the very beginning they had to be one there's a purpose for me saying this this morning there has to be that Union take place there's got to be a Oneness take place so amazing when I was when I first came into this message I remember reading a sermon or having questions about the Trinity and the godhead and all these things I may have said this here I say it a lot but but I remember you know what I wanted to understand what the godhead was I wanted to understand these things and you know I came from a trinitarian background but now here here we are in the message and brother Brad I'm talking about Oneness and everybody's talking about Oneness and I was just baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not in the father's Unholy ghost right and all these things come together and I believe that don't get me wrong I believe that I believe what my pastor told me I believe what I read in the books I believe what the Bible said but you know you're always you you just you won't understand right and then I I get this this sermon I pull up a book and this is before the computer days and I pull up and I found a book Oneness and I thought yes that's going to show me everything I need to know about that and I open up and I start reading and I was floored flummoxed what I don't know what do you call just a shot he was not talking about the Trinity nearly so much as he was talking about the Oneness between the bride and her husband Jesus Christ the Oneness of the godhead and he was taking me and he was putting me in that godhead and I thought Lord have mercy what have I missed my whole life right what have I missed and look at it I could say this is awesome this is wonderful stuff right so so when Adam and Eve when they're separated at that time remember now before the fall that they were still it did nothing that separation did nothing to negate the truth that they were created one in the beginning that was still there that Oneness was the truth according to God's word and I'm just going to go ahead and tell you this morning I might get out there just a little bit here in a second but I really believe that Oneness still exists [Music] and for true happiness in the in in the marriage you must find that Unity again you've got to come back to that Genesis 1 Unity right Genesis 2 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh Jesus said in Matthew chapter 19 have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this call shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let no man put asunder right I think the problem today and we see it all over you used to be the problem that you would see outside the message ranks but we see it a lot in the message ranks now too but I think the problem today that we see way too too many times is that there are far too many marriages that have never truly been joined together I don't care what the preacher said I don't care how long the honeymoon was they have never joined together the two remain two separate individuals right through the fall that's what happened the they were they had before the fall they were they were they were Twain amen after the father came a separation there was sin separated there amen I praise the Lord God's able to heal things God's able to put stuff back together God's able to fix marriages God's able to blend a relationship back together amen if he was not able to do that I guarantee you it would be a much worse world than it is right now thank God for True Christians that can stand up for a word of God Amen but the problem is is that people have not joined together they've not really United they've remained two individuals instead of coming together as that one that God saw and spoke them to be before the foundation of the world and the woman has a hard time coming under the headship of the man and losing her own fleshly identity and truly taking on his name his identity now I don't know you folks some of you folks and if I say something it might kind of step on your toes I'm sorry here but one of the things that just gripes me to know in is to see these newfangled marriages yeah where the where the woman will not take the man's name or it's a hyphenated name yeah call me old-fashioned I don't care I'm old enough to not care right if she's not if she's if she's holding on to enough identity up from her past life she can that she will not surrender her last name then she is not she is not going to join she's not going to be able to adequately join this is just practical stuff brother wait I'm sorry but it's just you're not going to be able to just add adequately no that's a tongue twister if you've got a tongue from Plainville adequately join together amen and be the kind of husband or wife that you're supposed to be I was told a while back said well you know in some places overseas the man takes the wife's wife's name and it's true and I said but they ain't Christian right and I don't care if they do or they don't or whatever I don't want to identify with that I identify with the Bible I identify as a Christian I'm a Christian it's not even an American thing or a western thing or this thing or that I'm a Christian it's a Bible thing and the woman is supposed to yield up surrender her identity to her husband it's called headship and the problem is is that they don't that the Lots will not come under that headship now I'm not just talking about the women because the problem I see too is the men will go many times and they will not yield up their identity you say wait a minute I'm the man I'm in control listen he took her it took the rib out of the side not the bone out of the foot right well she's got to do what I say no she won't with that attitude or if she does you better watch out there's going to be something in your food and you've got to go to sleep sometime right he said oh she's so Meek and timid she would never do something like that you'd be surprised humans are ingenious things they'll figure out a way to get you back right just smile all along yes my Lord yes my Lord oh my God it's a it's a lack of ability to I'll tell you what it is it's selfishness I mean just be plain spoken in selfishness you know I know in 2023 that sounded like an outdated narrow-minded hateful position to take but it's the truth times have changed but the word of God has not there could be many reasons there's really there's a lot of reasons for this lack of unity there you know the fear of losing one's individual identities as we said I'm my own person but what Satan hides are and he's really good at hiding things but what Satan hides here is the fact that neither the man nor the woman can ever truly know their God given their full god-given identities and Freedoms because man there is nothing like the freedom that comes with having the right kind of relationship with your wife or your husband there's nothing like the freedom that comes with that I can go home and I can just open myself up I can unburden myself from the day not that I just want to go dump on my wife at the end of the day I don't do that but at the same time I'm able to talk about open up share my feelings share my love everything else and it's just it's a freeing thing if I had to carry everything by myself I would be a miserable human being and to be honest with you I don't think I'm strong enough to carry it all by myself I don't think I am I think I'd be so overwhelmed and listen guys do not take your wife for granted God give you the best thing he could give you outside of Salvation when he gave you a wife right a Godly wife don't take it for granted Satan is so good at hiding that though and saying well you know you're gonna if you do that if you if you have that attitude or if you think about it this way if you you know whatever it might be if you go by the word of God if you do this you're you're not going to even be a person anymore he robs them of that blessing of they twain shall be won robs him of it I mean he just reaches down there and snatches it right out of him too many times he puts a line such a way that they can they'll just freely give it over right but God said he made you male and female he made you one Yes Man now I'm talking about marriage here obviously I'm talking about marriage here this morning and I know according to to Paul that marriage is not for everyone he he did say that he plainly said that in his opinion it was better if you stayed as he was right as he was but then he turned around and said but not many can do that and it's better to marry than to burn that's not the reason you get married but it's better to marry than to burn the problem though again is that they never they never truly the problem is they never truly die to themselves and they're they're selfish natures and all these things in order to advance the cause and the purpose of the family unit the family unit must come first there must be a true Union take place for everything to work right and again that so far here I've been just talking about marriage relationships that it's not just the natural marriage relationship here but this is a type of a relationship with our husband with the Lord Jesus Christ right we are his bride amen and through the marriage Union of the baptism of the Holy Ghost for this day through the bonds of holy matrimony to the Lord Jesus Christ we have become wife in every sense of the word Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord have your way Lord right amen for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives and I pointed out last night that word love there that's a special word that word there husband love your wives That's not the Greek word Eros which is a lustful word it's the lower the lowest form but the lowest form of love that there can be Eros and he did not say husbands filio your wives That's to have an affection for you know I kind of like her she cooks really good since I've been married I put on 80 pounds my wife can cook she gets it from her mama honey I feel you owe you I love how it feels to sit up pull up to the table and be able to you know just just eat to you know my heart's content I have affection for you you're so pretty you know and all that may be true there's nothing wrong with that that's true but that's not what what God is commanding us here that's not what Jesus is saying he's saying husband loves your wife and it's the word it's the Greek word agape yeah I'm probably not putting enough oil to that or oh or something to that but of the GoPro that's my playable Greek and Agape means according to the prophet he said it's not filio he said we're talking about the love of God right so husbands agapo your wives love her just as Christ loves his church and I'll tell you what that love is like that love is so great that he went to the cross and threw out his hands amen and he said nevertheless nevertheless God not my will but thy will be done you see agape love which is the identifying characteristic for the age you're living in remember if you go through the statue of the seven of the the the perfect man you go there to up to the top there's the Capstone that comes down and brother Bradham said it was love right love there love yeah there Holy Spirit that's the bonds of matrimony and The Headstone comes down and that's the identifying factor for our age love agape love husbands love your wives that way love your wives like God loves you surrender everything to her amen amen give your very Life Force to her right everything you are I go to work I'm working for my family right I go to I go to church I'm praying for my family I go whatever it might be there's something that's taking place and oh god I've Got A Something's Gotta Move and I'm praying for my family and all these things as the love of God I'm sacrificing everything I am for that one for that family unit for that family unit love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or a wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish I love going places with my wife she stands out and I love it I'm presenting her as a glorious bride right and I'm so thankful for the privilege to be able to do that don't you know that when you walk the streets when you go to Walmart I used to say you know I used to say all the time when you go through that Walmart or cashier and you and everything they don't have those anymore right now you're just in this big thing and you're having to do it all yourself and then they got the audacity to check you out when you get you to make sure you did it right when you get to the door listen Bob if you're not going to pay somebody to check me out don't look at my bags when I walk out the door you trust me trust me but don't you know when you walk through Walmart or Home Goods or tarsier or wherever it is that you like to shop we heard a lot of that last night even Amazon somehow I figured that one out see I'm old school still yeah I'm afraid if I ordered through Amazon it ain't going to fit yeah you know I'm not going to like it I ordered a kit one time on Amazon it was a Legos kid it was a it was a there was a wall you remember back in 2020 19 whatever it was and the trumps thing would build the wall and everybody boy everybody yeah yeah yeah you know all this kind of stuff and I did it as a joke with a little a little party gift to give to to my nephew or different ones I thought this is going to be such a hit and the other pitcher had this this wall the Lego wall and Trump with his big hair and everything else and I ordered that thing and I think I paid 30 40 bucks for that thing and when it came in it was in a box this big and I was like I I sent them an email I have been gypped Trump is a Salesman but you guys ripped me off you know the blocks were like you know the smaller than the size of my pinky nail but don't you know that when you go to these different places I know I get sidetracked way too easy but when you go to these places and and you're walking through the you're wherever it might be in the workplace or here or there and all these things and you're walking and people are looking at you and you're you're Heavenly bridegroom your heavenly husband is looking at that and he's saying that's my wife yeah that's my wife you know I'm he puts you on display he puts you on display so that he can show you all he says that's that's there's none like her she's beautiful she's gorgeous this is the it's everything I have to have thought about everything I have created everything I have done is wrapped up in this one this one this not an individual this one unit this one relationship this one bride this one wife right hallelujah amen that's who you are and he looks at you and he's just so proud of that amen that's right sometimes he sends you to the doctor's office to put his Union his Oneness on display sometimes he puts you in an MRI machine sometimes he sometimes he puts you in an oncologist office right what is he doing he's putting you on display because you're his wife can you just imagine what it must have been for job oh Lord I'm going to I'm about to be careful I'm just I won't finish and y'all just go eat there ain't no finishing that's the problem see he told me to can you just imagine what it was for job I mean we think of hard times I mean there's some pretty hard times but I mean you know when people go bankrupt and man I've seen people go bankrupt by the Lord's Grace I've never had to go bankrupt I've got really close we used to come through our through our years and I'd have after I paid my bills I had nine dollars to put gas in the tank that wouldn't work today nine dollars put gas in the tank and buy some hot dogs or a bag of potatoes or whatever for us to live on the rest of the week and we made it we did it we ate a lot of of homemade fries fried Eddie fries and and Polish sausages they were cheap back then you get a bag of five pound bag of potatoes that last you about all week long for a buck fifty yeah no wonder I put on 80 pounds and I think about it that way can you imagine though I mean here's job and and job goes through these things and and and and he loses he loses all his you know his cows are gone his his camels are gone his sheep are gone he loses everything that's that's enough to take a family down but you know it just stops there didn't it and then he lost his kids he lost his reputation his friends came so-called friends came they turned their back to him wouldn't even talk to him for seven days and then when they finally did start talking to him oh my goodness the the vitriol the vial that was coming out of their mouths you're a secret sinner we knew it all along well just it was the you could tell it was just the jealousy that was in them absolutely right his own wife literally almost verbatim almost verbatim quoted Satan back to job Satan had stood before God and and talking about putting on display it wasn't that Satan came up and said hey there's a man down there you got a hedge built around and I think I should be able to get to him that ain't what he said he comes up and and God just says oh catch me oh where you been what are you doing have you have you considered my servant job now we would think hush don't do that don't spring my name up but you see God had so much confidence so much love that Union was so he knew that he could trust job there was a union that had taken place and he put him in the hardest of places the hardest of conditions amen all at one time because he knew what God what what job was capable of even when job didn't know what he was capable of God knew what he was capable of right he knew what he had in him have you considered my servant job off you won't let me at him he's privileged yeah he's got privilege he's got this he's got a hedge built around him he's got all the different things and God says okay I'll show you I'll take the Hedge away have at him and job gets down to the place we know the story gets down to the place he's on the ash sheep he's scraping his boils and everything else he's lost everything he's wailing don't get me wrong Joe wants some superhuman that's sitting there saying ah God's got this he's in control that wasn't job at all he was human just like me and you and literally job's own wife turns to him and says why don't you curse God and die that's almost exactly what Satan told told God Satan took to him he said if you were to take that hedge off and you let me touch him let me get a hold of him he'll curse you to your face and here's his wife saying why don't you curse God and die shows where her inspiration came from that was not a Godly wife being represented there yeah a Godly wife would have been falling on her knees and praying with her husband at that time right amen so but job but job stood there and that was all because God had put him on display I preached a message one time called God's display case we think oh that's where you put your grandma's China and that's where you put your your great Grandmama's silverware and this and that and the little knickknacks that you collect that your kids give you and everything all these things that you want to put on display for for whoever comes into your house that you invite in your house you want to be able to display that and say look this this was special to me this is this is not just something that stuck back in the drawer this is something that's special to me oh you're special to him Saints and then he takes him and he puts it up there in the display case but God's display case is not like our display case and God in your iron display case except for the stuff that we don't want nobody to touch God sits there and says touch them kick them bite them custom tear them tear their hearts out of them tear their everything but their soul you just can't touch their life you can touch their mind you can touch their body you can touch their Spirit even you can break their Spirit even sure yes all right hey man but there's something inside of you Satan can't get a hold of Hallelujah it's a seed of God it was predestinated before the foundation of the world to believe his word because God said in the beginning he created them as one one for a part of him in the beginning you were one and if you were there in the beginning you'll be there in the ending right praise the Lord Jesus amen praise the Lord Jesus oh my God husbands love your wives he presents it to himself a glorious church not having spotted a wrinkle or any such thing but then it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies that he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherished in it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh is that right for this call shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined into his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church I guarantee you this is not just a church-going experience this is not a Pew sitting experience this is not something to where somebody just gets oh I've read a few books or something like that I've got some ideas I tell you I think some of the hardest sermons I've ever preached was when there was this one particular individual that would come visit with his soon-to-be wife at the time and he had he had read he had studied Buddhism he had studied Shamanism he had studied the Catholics he had started the Protestants the Pentecostals he had studied uh Hinduism he had studied I mean he got smart he's super smart he had all these things going through his head and Islam and all the things going through his head and he didn't he didn't believe any of it and he'd sit there in that church in my church and he'd sit there and he'd listen to me preach and I'd preached to who wouldn't have it but it just seemed like it wasn't going nowhere it made it so hard those are some of the hardest sermons I ever preached because it just it was just the man thought he knew enough there was no way that you could get to the man because you see he was so full of himself there's a reason he said let us be living sacrifices remember oh it's a mystery all right yeah it's a great mystery it's a mystery that Satan with all his lies and his lustful Spirits is covered over and buried very well today amen very well but God wants us to be one even as we sit down here and Satan's Eden and we can definitely say we are the wool man we've got a lot of whoa that we go through right we've got a lot of that stuff that we have to face fights or battles we have to fight all these different things amen that's the truth man but you gotta understand you got to remember you were taken out of his side the woman was taken out of the side of her spoken word husband Hallelujah praise the Lord the woman came out of the side of the spoken word Son of God the second Adam right amen he said it's necessary that I go it's necessary that I do this for if I don't go you can't come where I am there had to come a there had to come a separation even from that they had to come in Separation The Bride had to be pulled out she came out from that Riven side of Jesus Christ and as that blood and water poured out of that precious body there was a life given to the Bride of Jesus Christ and through that life we can find our true Oneness in him ain't that something that had to come out of his side so that we could go back into him right what a paradox he'd have to go to the cross and die and go through all these things and and literally have that life the life remember all he was the fullness of the godhead bodily it was dwelling within him that God seed that God life was held within that blood cell the life was in the blood and it was in there but for but for us to truly be able to come back and be one with him it had to be set loose there's a saying what if you love something let it go right if you love something let it go I'll pick up my little niece here well we got I've got this this gorgeous little great niece and you just want to pick her up I could just scream just go out there you know she's so cute after a while she's gonna have to get up and she's gonna have to go on her own and express who she is and that's what God knew he had to set you free so you could express who you are in him he gave you the ability to express Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever across the mystery brother Brandon said now you see the secret what two to restore Fallen Eve sorry Brothers I didn't get you that quote the secret what to to restore Fallen Eve as she was a free figure of the church and now notice as God opened up the side of Adam and took out Eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his Spirit from masculine and feminist to feminist and he put it in eve took the rip from under his side and made Eve out of it so God did the same thing taking out of the sight of Christ the blood and the water and Christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church Eve see back to himself again Redeemed by the blood that was come from his body you see it now God's great mystery being unfolded that's been hit since the foundation of the world but prefigured it all the way down through Ain't That Wonderful Paul said it's a great mystery it's a great mystery and here in this day we have a prophet comes and he says oh you see it now God's great mystery being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world but prefigured all the way down through Hallelujah and glory to God the way was made through the death of Jesus and the wife was set free perfect type perfect type the woman and it truly is I mean this fleshly Journey that we're on you know we're I love brother brother Ernie used to say he said we're not fleshly beings Heaven having a spiritual experience he said but no he said We Are Spiritual Beings having an Earthly Earthly experience right we're literally we're literally Spiritual Beings having a a an Earthly experience down here in flesh and you know what it's not easy not at all it's it is full of Woe and it's full of Sorrows and it's full of heart heartaches and all these different things to all who are dwelling in these fleshly Dwelling Places is hard it's not exclusive to the Christians either it's hard all over the world breaks your heart when you see somebody go through some of the hardest things of life and they don't know Jesus man if only you know Jesus right I had an employer one time first survey I ever worked for and he was an alcoholic and and druggie prescription druggie genius it's just a genius absolutely Genius of a man could figure things in his mind faster than 10 times faster than I can do it on a calculator and he would he would he would sit there and he would just get so strung out and everything else and he'd cry and everything else and he's I don't know why and you know one time he actually broke down he said Dutch I don't know what's wrong I don't know how to fix it I don't know what to do and all these things and I said Anthony listen you need Jesus you need Jesus I don't know the answers to all these things but I know Jesus does and Jesus Christ can fix this situation he can break these bonds he could break these Cycles he could do all these you need Jesus and he looked at me and he said Jesus is mad at me I said no he's not Anthony no he's not he says he's not mad at me he's not mad at you he's calling for you to come back he's calling for you to come back never could get over that hump never could get over that hump I walked in and I found him dead of an overdose he took blood pressure medicine in a 24 case a 24 case of these huge beard but ice or whatever it was nasty stuff drank himself to death with a blood pressure medicine stroked out right there four days later you know brother Brown talks about those ones that that die and it hurts to say this I'll just tell you that but he talks about those ones that that die but they don't have a body to go to remember you've got a word body are you are you a Christian today are you a Believer today you've got a word body if this if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting for us Eternal in the heavens right there's a sixth Dimension that is full of theophanese word bodies that are there amen and if if I was to fall over Dead with a heart attack right now and and I'd be I'd be there I'd go I know my Lord amen I trust him I believe him I have no doubt whatsoever that when I'm absent here I want to be present there I'll close my eyes here and I'll wake up over there Hallelujah right oh what a time that's going to be praise the Lord amen but he said if you don't have that if they don't have those those that theophany that word body waiting for him he said they're they're just kind of there many times not all the time but many times it's almost like limbo they're just stuck they can't go there because they don't have a body and they they're not it's not judgment yet they can't go to the Judgment so they're just kind of stuck and he said well do you think the loss would go to hell that is a hell it's a separation which is what death is death is a separation there's a natural death and it's nothing but a separation from this Earthly body that has nothing to do with who you are Christians do not die amen because they cannot be separated from Christ Jesus who loves them right but when they go you know if they were to go on beyond that that without that without that love of Christ without that Assurance without that body and they go he said they're just kind of wondering four days after my my boss my friend because we'd become close by that time four days after that my other bosses at the time his wife was walking down the road doing you know she was exercising she's doing a power walk you know and she

things still hurts yeah yeah you don't want that for somebody you don't want that for somebody and you've got that opportunity to know Jesus like nobody else has don't take it for granted amen love him with everything you got mad serving with everything you got Unite with them with everything you got open yourself up and surrender with everything you got Paul tells us that in this thing here we groan earnestly [Music] amen Desiring to be back to that Oneness to be clothed upon that's that Oneness amen praise the Lord Jesus praise the Lord Jesus that's that's the Oneness I'm talking about right I'm just going to start my other 20 Pages said okay I'm kidding but that's the one that's that we're talking about this morning to be this afternoon to be able to so be so yielded to him to be so surrendered to him to to lose everything I am I have to lose my whole identity I Die daily now that's a that's a battle but Saints it's worth it yeah it's worth it to give everything you got over to this yes amen if if you've heard Lord speaking down in your heart if you if you've had if he's dealt with you like that don't take that for granted that's right and if you've walked away from him

make you make mistakes but when you find Mr Wright you give everything you got to him and sometimes it's tough to do so it's tough for us to find our Heavenly husband and turn it everything over to him but do that what's our theme here for this year last year and this year too let it out let it out get it out of there let out everything you are and give it to Jesus Christ turn yourself over and lay that lay that Veil over on his shoulder and be one with him Oneness I love that that book I love that book one is for God it's really neat because brother Brown tells you he says you know what

he'll never turn you away and you know what he can't be mad at you if he loved you before the foundation of the world he can't change his mind he loves you now you just might think he doesn't because he has ways that we we don't have but it all works out for the good Ness [Music] there is like you over there is amen [Music] I don't want this to ask not a good day to end this I wish they had

will hatred vile things go on in the world that ain't God but like brother Dutch says you sisters why would God put you on display that you don't cut your hair that you don't wear in modest clothes that people can go instead of turning looking oh my God they turn and look oh I see God right there's a big difference in saying oh my God like but oh they look just like God they Godly there was a man that left close to Gillsville that he saw June one time in Walmart and he's walking down he looks back and he says I just want to shake your hand he said he said I don't see many Godly women so see that's your that's you on display that's you showing the world that there is somebody that is Godly that God can live a life through and us being the bride you men you got to do the same thing too you want don't be cussing fussing he's right running people off the road first time getting tickets we learn a lot when you get people coming to the Valentine's banquet but listen we're all human beings but you know at least one thing different between us and Them is we've got God in our heart amen we've got our spiritual Rudder that when things go wrong and things don't go the way you think
