[0:01] all right
[0:08] right see if
[0:12] this we are live good morning everybody
[0:15] good
[0:18] morning we're going to keep speaking on
[0:21] the subject of
[0:23] communion which is what we've been
[0:24] talking on for quite a while wonderful
[0:26] and communion is is fellowship with God
[0:30] moving up the statue of a perfect man
[0:33] moving in Union with him
[0:36] until we're speaking the same language
[0:39] where we understand what uh our purpose
[0:42] is and who God is and what we're doing
[0:44] here and when the process is completed
[0:46] and we'll take a body change amen
[0:50] so while we're down in Mobile I just
[0:52] kind of last night I was trying to put
[0:54] some notes together and I threw some
[0:56] things together and based on just you
[0:59] know just here the brothers preach and
[1:01] everything and and I got to thinking on
[1:03] on this
[1:05] scripture blessed is the man from
[1:07] Jeremiah 1778 blessed is the man that
[1:10] trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the
[1:13] Lord is for he shall be as a tree
[1:16] planted By the Waters and that spread
[1:19] out her Roots by the river and shall not
[1:22] see when he cometh but her leaves shall
[1:24] be green and shall not be careful in the
[1:26] year of drought neither shall cease from
[1:29] yelding
[1:32] FR you know we a lot of us have been in
[1:35] the message a long time and and years
[1:37] ago it seemed like everything was was
[1:39] very mysterious and um long and long
[1:44] everything begins to make more sense
[1:46] amen that's what I've been that's what
[1:48] I've been kind of getting at until as we
[1:51] keep growing and growing and our Our
[1:54] Roots dig down deep into the word of God
[1:57] then then we get to the point where
[1:58] we're not like like in First Peter
[2:01] chapter 2 where uh Peter was talking
[2:03] about don't be like newborn babies
[2:05] anymore right but grow up so that you're
[2:08] not swayed by every wind of Doctrine
[2:10] every little thing that comes along
[2:11] where you're you're wondering is this
[2:13] right is that right and I I was
[2:15] listening to I was reading a sermon the
[2:17] other day I was trying to find that
[2:18] quote this morning and I couldn't find
[2:20] it but um brother V was talking about
[2:23] how when he's preaching he can get these
[2:25] these little he he discerns what people
[2:28] are doubt from different people and he
[2:30] said they'll be from this direction
[2:31] somebody saying but what about and from
[2:34] over here somebody will say but what
[2:36] about so as we draw into Union with
[2:39] Christ all of those little what abouts
[2:42] are blasted Away by the revealed word of
[2:45] God that's till we don't have any more
[2:47] whatabouts anymore amen and that's what
[2:50] that's how we'll take a body change yes
[2:51] sir because there won't be no more
[2:52] whatabouts exactly Enoch just walked
[2:54] right on He Walked on up and walked with
[2:58] God was right in commun with God am and
[3:01] he took a walk to glory and his body was
[3:03] changed amen so as you draw into
[3:05] communion you you you're your roots are
[3:08] are just going down into the Wellsprings
[3:11] of everlasting life you're planted by
[3:15] like like a tree planted By the Waters
[3:17] and look how he changes the tents now
[3:20] look what he's talking about he shall be
[3:22] planted he shall be as a tree and then
[3:25] he changes the tense he changes the the
[3:28] the the gender that spread without her
[3:31] Roots by the river and shall not see
[3:34] when he cometh all around things are
[3:37] going to gross darkness in the land but
[3:40] it it doesn't bother bother somebody
[3:42] that's that's rooted in the word amen
[3:44] that's right shall not see when he
[3:45] cometh but her leaves shall be green and
[3:47] shall not be careful in the year of
[3:49] drought neither shall there there's
[3:52] coming a famine in the land a family for
[3:54] the hearing of the word but to a real
[3:56] believer that's that's been feasting
[3:59] like that song we sang Feast on the body
[4:03] word of God Amen eat from the body word
[4:05] of God Amen cuz that's how we'll take a
[4:07] body change do you want a body change
[4:09] from the body word that's right and
[4:11] neither shall cease from yielding fruit
[4:13] and the believer's fruit is the doctrine
[4:16] that we've heard right quickened by the
[4:18] spirit made alive in us so that it's not
[4:21] written on the page anymore that's right
[4:23] now it's written in the life of the
[4:25] believer
[4:26] amen cuz we're building up and if you
[4:30] look through all the scriptures one of
[4:32] the words that means building is this
[4:35] new testament word edifying and you know
[4:39] you kind of think of edifying as a as a
[4:41] as a the minister saying things to edify
[4:44] the Believers but one of the things I've
[4:46] been one of the points I've been trying
[4:47] to get across is that this the spirit of
[4:50] God communion is not just for a Ministry
[4:53] but every member of the body of Christ
[4:56] is supposed to be being built up that's
[4:58] right and now now when we have
[5:00] conversation one with another our
[5:02] conversation should be edifying cuz you
[5:05] know brother brand said every believer
[5:06] is an optimist every believer is is if
[5:10] if if the word of God is living inside a
[5:13] Believer our conversation should conform
[5:16] to what's written on the pages when we
[5:18] talk to one another we should we should
[5:20] edify we shouldn't say well you know
[5:23] what about
[5:25] about it should be rooted in God's word
[5:28] I believe that God God will heal you
[5:30] amen I believe that you know whatever
[5:33] you have needful of let our conversation
[5:35] be edifying because this is what Paul's
[5:37] getting the cross Romans 14:1 17-19 for
[5:40] the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink
[5:42] but righteousness and peace and joy in
[5:44] the Holy Ghost for he that in these
[5:46] things serveth Christ is acceptable to
[5:48] God and approved of men let us therefore
[5:51] follow after the things which make for
[5:53] peace and things where with one may
[5:56] edify another that's it amen cuz we're
[5:58] growing we're building right word on top
[6:01] of word amen and sometimes you know uh
[6:05] sisters and and and different ones in
[6:07] the church can save things to help me
[6:10] and oh my brother sure sure
[6:14] but we're all helping water we're all
[6:17] we're all growing you know uh uh because
[6:21] the least in the king like Jesus said
[6:23] the least in the kingdom is greater than
[6:25] John the Baptist the least in the
[6:26] kingdom is is can have can you can pull
[6:29] virtu right from the least in the
[6:31] Kingdom
[6:32] amen all things are lawful for me but
[6:35] all things are not expedient all things
[6:37] are lawful for me but all things edify
[6:40] not yeah so we should be concerned about
[6:42] edifying and you remember brother
[6:43] Brandon this is this is maybe a strange
[6:45] little scripture for me remember brother
[6:47] Brand's explanation of this is if a
[6:49] sister comes and ask for advice or
[6:51] something goes into his into his study
[6:53] then it would be lawful according for
[6:55] for God you know from God's vantage
[6:57] point for him to go and and give her
[6:59] advice but for our Vantage Vantage Point
[7:03] we might look upon that and say well he
[7:05] shouldn't be going into that study
[7:07] something might be going on going wrong
[7:09] he's in there with a woman a sister
[7:11] alone it doesn't look right it's not
[7:14] edifying it doesn't it it you know
[7:18] things could be said things could be you
[7:20] know it looks strange so we should be we
[7:23] should be concerned about helping one
[7:26] another to grow that's right and when
[7:28] you do things like that that don't don't
[7:31] appear well then it it can cause
[7:33] somebody to stumble that's your
[7:35] knowledge yes cuz that's the deser to be
[7:38] able to discern what's going on cuz all
[7:40] things don't edify that's
[7:42] good but the discernment is what up the
[7:45] statue of perfect man that knowledge in
[7:47] there tells you what's edifying and
[7:50] what's not cuz some things you eat you
[7:51] kind of like some things you eat you
[7:53] don't like you eat them cuz you have to
[7:57] yeah
[8:02] first Thessalonians 5 8:14 but let us
[8:06] who are of the day be sober putting on
[8:07] the breastplate of faith and love and
[8:09] forign helment the hope of salvation for
[8:12] God has not appointed us to wrath but to
[8:14] obain Salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ
[8:16] who died for us that whether we wake or
[8:18] sleep we should live together with him
[8:20] because we're we're communion with God
[8:22] through through the word and communion
[8:24] with one another that's the only way
[8:25] that we can come into the unity of the
[8:27] faith is by his word right that's right
[8:30] communion with one another and real
[8:31] communion with one another edifies one
[8:33] another right wherefore Comfort
[8:34] yourselves together and edify one
[8:37] another even as also you do and we
[8:39] beseech you Brethren to know them which
[8:41] labor among you and are over you and the
[8:44] Lord and admonish you and to esteem them
[8:47] very highly in love for their work sake
[8:49] and be at peace among
[8:51] yourselves that's
[8:55] good now I I'm just kind of go through
[8:58] some of these quotes very quickly cuz
[9:00] I'm I I'm kind of going from that that
[9:02] tree that cannot be shaken through a few
[9:06] things and we'll come back Circle back
[9:08] around and end up at that
[9:10] tree because in this last in this day
[9:13] there's so many things that can shake a
[9:14] real believer there's so many things
[9:16] that that that this in this layout of
[9:20] see and age all the devils are turned
[9:22] against the bride to to attack and and
[9:25] the only thing that we can be fortified
[9:27] by behind is the word of God Amen
[9:29] right earnestly continuing for the faith
[9:32] that was once delivered to the Saints in
[9:33] 1953 this this brother was telling um
[9:37] trying to trying to get across this
[9:38] point that we don't need that the
[9:40] Pentecost anymore uh I said they're the
[9:43] ones that believe and he said well he
[9:45] said brother brand I think that
[9:46] Pentecost was a scaffold said that God
[9:48] was going to put up a building and he
[9:50] put made Pentecost a scaffold well I
[9:52] said that's right I'll agree with you he
[9:53] said well see after the scaffold work's
[9:56] done we don't need the scaffold anymore
[9:58] in other words the build is complete but
[10:01] God is still building right the scaffold
[10:03] work isn't done when the build is
[10:05] completed God will take it up so so
[10:08] we're still working on the building
[10:11] Foundation got to have
[10:13] foundation so now
[10:16] now pay real attention to what brother
[10:18] Dale's been preaching on on anointing
[10:21] because as you get up to the C Stone
[10:22] remember the difference between the
[10:23] bottom and the top is the bottom is a
[10:25] feeling the top is an anointing and the
[10:27] word that that anointing has got to come
[10:29] up p a word born bride somebody that's
[10:32] that's
[10:34] uh you know you well let's let me read
[10:37] some close let get ahead of myself Jesus
[10:39] keeps all his appointments in
[10:41] 1964 he said just like this when my
[10:44] shadow here of my hand if I never seen
[10:48] my my hand seen the shadow it's kind of
[10:50] it gets pale as it gets away but as it
[10:52] gets closer and closer the negative and
[10:55] positive are coming together until they
[10:56] both become the same thing what's he
[10:59] about he's talking about communion he's
[11:01] talking about how we're eating the body
[11:02] word of of God and we draw closer and
[11:04] closer to him until we become the same
[11:07] thing right amen and that's exactly when
[11:09] the church and the word has to be one
[11:11] like Jesus and God was one just exactly
[11:13] that's it God has was in it was in
[11:15] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[11:17] and so will Christ have to be in the
[11:19] church the anointed of the word to make
[11:22] everything fulfilled and that's the
[11:24] Capstone that comes upon the last Church
[11:27] age not the lay out of sea now out of
[11:29] that a bride out of a church church out
[11:31] of a church in other words just like he
[11:33] called a nation out of a nation in Egypt
[11:37] and now we're living in that day what a
[11:39] day
[11:41] amen and the choosing of a bride brother
[11:43] Brown
[11:44] said he's kind of explaining the
[11:46] difference between
[11:47] anointing and the birth you know the
[11:50] birth of the word we kind of explained
[11:52] that last time that the way you're born
[11:54] again is by two things coming together
[11:58] the way that spirit and Truth the way
[12:00] that we take a body change is that head
[12:02] coming and uniting with the body amen
[12:05] the anointing upon the ano upon the body
[12:08] word a Believer that's been that's been
[12:10] mature that's grown through Grace uh
[12:14] through through eating the word if you'd
[12:16] say you got the Holy Ghost and won't
[12:18] cope with the word it's another spirit
[12:20] in you
[12:21] uhoh now see there's the evidence of a
[12:23] real Holy Ghost filled believer a real
[12:26] Born Again Believers that they will line
[12:28] up or or their desire is to line up with
[12:30] the word and when it's presented to you
[12:33] you'll you'll follow right after that
[12:35] word you'll line to agree with every
[12:38] word not just nod your head not just say
[12:41] well here I am in church and because the
[12:43] pastor uh agrees with the word that I've
[12:46] got it or that somebody else agrees with
[12:48] it but you agree with the
[12:50] word if you have that anointing on you
[12:53] then you you think you're anointed by
[12:56] the the genuine Holy Spirit a genuine
[12:58] baptism but you won't follow the word
[13:01] you'll you'll think you're okay somebody
[13:03] will present to you that your your your
[13:06] addess is not right or or different
[13:07] things uh that's why in in churches or
[13:10] in denominational churches you got
[13:12] people smoking cigarettes in the parking
[13:14] lot and stuff because they're or or like
[13:16] remember that story that brother bam
[13:17] told of the of the um the the couple
[13:20] that the brothers that were one was
[13:23] speaking in tongues and one was
[13:24] interpreting and one uh was living with
[13:26] a woman that wasn't his wife and whatnot
[13:28] and no anointed by genuine baptism but
[13:31] not filled right with the word that'll
[13:33] make that word live inside of you make
[13:37] like a a tree that's bearing
[13:39] fruit cuz your fruit is your Doctrine
[13:43] made manifest and without that word
[13:45] quick and living inside of you that
[13:48] Doctrine cannot live it's just an
[13:51] anointing on on you if you'd say you've
[13:53] got the Holy Ghost and won't cope with
[13:55] the word it's another Spirit In You
[13:57] God's spirit is on his word the m in it
[13:59] the anointed word the bride must be a
[14:02] messiah it y the anointed word
[14:09] amen in Matthew 242 24:28 this this is a
[14:13] scripture that's all that's familiar to
[14:15] us that if any man shall say unto you Lo
[14:18] here is Christ or there believe it
[14:22] not Christ is over there at this church
[14:25] Christ is over here at this church or
[14:26] over at this place or or uh you know
[14:30] that that Peruan doctrine that that God
[14:32] came down in 1963 and is over here I
[14:36] want him in here right amen not over
[14:38] there
[14:39] somewhere and this is this scripture
[14:41] shows where he is for there shall arise
[14:44] false Christ and false prophets and
[14:48] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[14:50] much that if it were possible they shall
[14:52] deceive the very elect if it were
[14:55] possible now that goes back to that tree
[14:57] that I'm getting to once you grown up in
[14:59] Grace and knowledge you're not a newborn
[15:01] baby anymore shaken by the wind shaken
[15:03] by everything can you be deceived that's
[15:05] right once you once that calf Stone
[15:07] comes down and and you're you're a uh
[15:11] the image of Christ the image of a
[15:13] stature of perfect man behold I've told
[15:16] you before wherefore if they shall say
[15:18] unto you behold he is in the desert go
[15:20] not forth behold he is in the secret
[15:22] chamber believe it not for as the
[15:25] lightning cometh out of the East and
[15:27] shineth even un the the West so shall
[15:30] also the coming of the son of man be
[15:32] amen and we know uh in uh in Revelation
[15:36] chapter 7 uh that angel ascended from
[15:39] the East having the Seal of the Living
[15:41] God sealing all the 144,000 from the
[15:43] East to the west and brother Brown
[15:45] taught how that the word has traveled
[15:47] from the East to the West it's not in
[15:49] any particular place but it's in an
[15:52] individual communion with God where you
[15:54] enter in into fellowship with him
[16:00] for
[16:01] whatsoever see what he's talking about
[16:03] is where you going to find where you
[16:06] going to find Christ over there over
[16:08] here we'll find him where the word is
[16:10] wheresoever the carcass is there will
[16:12] the Eagles be gathered together not old
[16:14] rotten carcass but a fresh carcass that
[16:16] the Eagles can Feast upon and these are
[16:18] all things that maybe are are common
[16:21] that's why you find out you see it says
[16:23] here is Christ so there believe it not
[16:25] the only way you're going to not believe
[16:26] it like you said is in here
[16:29] so that's why you see people go over
[16:30] here and they go over there and they're
[16:32] searching for this this this brother's
[16:34] got it or this brother's got it well you
[16:37] better have it first yes cuz if you
[16:39] don't have it if you got it first then
[16:40] you stay right where you're at because
[16:42] you'll go in the desert you'll go to a
[16:44] secret chamber you'll go looking for
[16:46] things but if he's inside you then
[16:48] you're not going to you're going to be a
[16:50] believer yeah cuz somebody's going to
[16:53] say unto you that's what them false
[16:54] Christ going to say I have him you got
[16:57] to come to me or he in brother brandom
[16:59] and he left and we're waiting for him to
[17:01] come back or he's in this one and we got
[17:02] to go over here that tree don't move
[17:06] that tree stays right where s right like
[17:08] that quote brother Brandon uh wanding
[17:10] Stars
[17:13] wondering but that tree don't move say
[17:16] works out
[17:19] y for as the lightning that lith out in
[17:22] Luke 1724 that lighten us out of the one
[17:25] part under Heaven shineth under the
[17:27] other part under heaven so shall also
[17:30] the son of man be in his day that lith
[17:33] that makes Darkness light you read the
[17:36] scripture I don't understand that it's
[17:38] all dark but then the let the light of
[17:40] the word just like in the beginning he
[17:42] spoke and it was light and he Shone upon
[17:46] what was dark and exposed it God's
[17:48] revealing his word and that's that's
[17:51] where you'll find him and it's a
[17:52] personal a personal communion a personal
[17:55] experience and and Jo Jehovah is explain
[17:58] now his body can't do it when that comes
[18:00] time is over as the light lightning
[18:03] Cometh From The East unto the West so
[18:05] shall the coming of the son of man be
[18:07] but his Spirit by a revelation of of his
[18:11] word a personal experience with
[18:14] him now anointed one and and in this
[18:17] sermon anointed ones at the end time
[18:18] anointed one is one with a message and
[18:21] the only way the message can be brought
[18:23] out is by one that's anointed and that
[18:26] would be a prophet anointed there shall
[18:28] rise f false anointed teachers a prophet
[18:31] teaches what his message is Anointed
[18:33] teachers but anointed people with false
[18:35] teaching anointed ones Christ plural
[18:38] prophets plural now now think about that
[18:43] false Christ and false prophets and I
[18:46] just I started off by talking about how
[18:48] we're supposed to be edifying one
[18:49] another now what happens when when a
[18:52] minister like brother Dale gets up and
[18:53] and he lays out the word just as plain
[18:55] as anything and I'm going meddle a
[18:57] little bit and then you go home and and
[19:00] and the wife or the husband or whoever
[19:02] says well that's not right what about
[19:04] that that's then then what what what
[19:08] ends up happening you see we we we're
[19:10] all trying to be in communion with one
[19:12] another if you if all the ministers in
[19:14] this church are not uh ride in line then
[19:17] it it just causes confusion and then if
[19:19] the if the minister gets brother Dale
[19:21] brother Wade gets up and preaches and
[19:23] lays it out straight and then you go
[19:24] home and tell your kids well I'm not
[19:26] sure when they just laid it out straight
[19:28] in the Bible then it just it messes the
[19:31] whole thing
[19:33] up and there's some there's some strong
[19:36] things that I can say right there that I
[19:37] I will
[19:41] not pour your why not why not Bob you
[19:45] got
[19:48] time you can be you got plenty you can
[19:51] be you can hey I'm trying to have mercy
[19:53] and not
[19:56] sacrifice I have mercy and not sacrifice
[20:00] what you
[20:01] saying go ahead all right let's let's
[20:04] keep on going the anointed ones of the
[20:06] end now in every case you will notice
[20:08] that a false prophet is one who is
[20:10] outside the word y just as we showed you
[20:13] that Antichrist means anti- word so
[20:16] these false prophets come perverting the
[20:18] word giving it a meaning that fits their
[20:20] own devilish ends have you ever noticed
[20:23] how the people who lead others astray
[20:24] bind themselves closely bind themselves
[20:27] bind them closely to themselves by fear
[20:30] Now isn't that the same thing that we
[20:31] were reading coming down from Kush and
[20:33] nrod where they get that that hammer and
[20:35] try to come found the people with
[20:36] beating them and everything they say
[20:39] that if the people won't do what they
[20:40] say or if they leave then destruction
[20:42] will follow they are false prophets for
[20:45] a true Prophet communion here won't
[20:48] stand between you and God but tries to
[20:51] take you to Christ a true Prophet will
[20:54] always lead one to the word and bind the
[20:57] people to Jesus Christ that's right and
[20:59] he won't tell the people to fear Him or
[21:01] what he says but to fear what the word
[21:05] says boy you can say a lot about that
[21:08] don't be concerned about what other
[21:09] people think about you be concerned
[21:11] about the one that can destroy the soul
[21:14] don't don't fear what anybody else well
[21:17] brother so and so going get mad at me if
[21:20] I but fear fear God and try to line up
[21:22] with him right fear what the word says
[21:26] now now that's true communion that's
[21:27] what a true Prophet will do that's what
[21:29] a true Minister will do is bind you to
[21:32] God not to himself or anything like that
[21:35] notice how these people like Judas are
[21:37] out for money they get you to sell all
[21:38] you have and get up to them and their
[21:40] schemes they spend more time on
[21:41] offerings than the word that those who
[21:43] attempt to operate gifts will make use
[21:45] of a gift which has a margin of error in
[21:49] it that's a good quote I like that and
[21:52] then ask for money and neglect the word
[21:54] and call it of God you remember what
[21:57] brother Rand said about prophecy you
[21:59] better make sure that it's correct every
[22:02] time if you say you got a gift or
[22:04] anything I remember I forget who it was
[22:06] but uh there was a brother in his church
[22:08] that that had a little a little a gift
[22:10] of Prophecy or whatever but every around
[22:12] then it was a little bit off he said
[22:14] just lay it to the side cuz it's got to
[22:17] be 100% in line we don't want we don't
[22:21] want to fool around anything that's 99%
[22:24] right and people will go to them and
[22:26] bear with them and support now that's
[22:28] that's W people will go them that's the
[22:31] ones that you the scripture you read go
[22:34] to the desert go here cuz it's not in
[22:37] here if it was in there they'd see that
[22:38] yeah they just keep putting up cuz it's
[22:40] a way of death people will go to them
[22:42] and bear with them and support them and
[22:44] believe them not knowing it is the way
[22:47] of
[22:48] death yes
[22:51] yes did I just read that same question
[22:53] yep mhm I got in there twice that's all
[22:56] right now look what communion is in the
[22:59] Old Testament that they try they stand
[23:01] they try to get into that holy of holies
[23:04] standing outside looking in and trying
[23:06] to get in there and there was a veil and
[23:08] they never they could never see the the
[23:10] way they covered up the Ark of the
[23:12] Covenant I I was reading that all the
[23:13] process they went through they took the
[23:15] covering the batter skins and everything
[23:16] and laid it on the Ark of the Covenant
[23:18] and wrapped it up nobody ever saw it
[23:20] when they were carrying it and
[23:21] everything it was it was something
[23:22] hidden it was always veiled even when it
[23:24] was moving right and and you know they
[23:27] couldn't get inside in this into this
[23:29] little room the holy of holies and then
[23:32] one day Jesus died on the cross in that
[23:34] Veil that was as thick as a man's hand
[23:36] there was no way for that thing even
[23:38] naturally you couldn't cut it but
[23:40] supernaturally God RI just split that
[23:44] Veil into two so now you have access
[23:46] into that little room where you and God
[23:48] can come and have
[23:50] communion and he actually split it from
[23:52] top to bottom to make sure man you know
[23:55] a man can split it from the bottom to
[23:56] the top but no man can get up there on
[23:58] that thing and split it down yeah from
[24:00] the top to the bottom so it came from
[24:02] God all the way down to man instead of
[24:04] man going that
[24:06] way I like that picture cuz that's split
[24:10] it split from the top to bottom cut it
[24:14] split and the bottom still got it's
[24:16] still connected like it was split down
[24:19] when you split something like that it
[24:21] don't don't do real straight it goes all
[24:24] Jack oh
[24:26] yeah mm
[24:29] problem was problem was they sewed it
[24:31] back up that's the whole problem they
[24:33] seed the thing back up wasn't time yeah
[24:37] was of time so now look at the day of
[24:40] Pentecost they were in a little room up
[24:43] there on the Pentecost when they were
[24:44] all Gather in one place afraid coward
[24:46] sitting in behind the wall walled in a
[24:47] little room but and then all of a sudden
[24:49] there came a sound from heaven like of a
[24:50] little rushian Mighty Wind It fill all
[24:52] the house they were sitting in that
[24:54] little
[24:55] room and and this look at this vision
[24:58] brother brand had about the third pool
[25:00] like a fire whing around licking blazing
[25:01] it left me went right down over the top
[25:03] of that audience and went and stood over
[25:05] the top of that little building and then
[25:07] settle down on top of it and one place
[25:09] he describes it as a little room several
[25:10] places a little building and then when
[25:12] it did this one they was standing behind
[25:14] me behind me the same voice the Angel's
[25:16] voice he said I'll meet you in there and
[25:18] this is the third pool but nobody will
[25:20] know nothing about it well I don't
[25:22] understand why in there why there well
[25:24] there's the answer it w't be a public
[25:26] right I don't understand going in that
[25:29] closet like that well there's the answer
[25:31] and he said it's is it not written by
[25:33] our Lord when thou pray be not like the
[25:36] Hypocrites who like to be be heard
[25:38] before men but enter into the secret
[25:40] closet and pray to the father who seeth
[25:42] in secret and he who seeth in secret
[25:45] shall reward thee openly
[25:48] yes you have that secret communion with
[25:51] God and you're going to Bear forth fruit
[25:53] openly because you got to be written
[25:55] Epistles known and read of all men where
[25:57] the book can be
[25:58] get plainly exposed that's
[26:02] right and that's what that's what we're
[26:04] getting to communion right there yeah
[26:07] right question is the anointing that
[26:10] you're talking about the Holy Spirit on
[26:12] the pyramid yes okay U the Capstone
[26:15] Divine
[26:17] love so
[26:21] that well let me let me go ahead I'm
[26:24] going to get to
[26:26] that now see brother br talked about
[26:28] three pulls how that how that what what
[26:30] are the three pulls God drawing people
[26:32] in fellowship with him correct from
[26:36] justification sanctification baptism all
[26:38] but okay get in the new birth and then
[26:42] it keeps drawing you up into communion
[26:44] with him so that you're like a tree
[26:47] playing By the Waters that can't be
[26:48] moved that's right and when that head
[26:51] comes down when that Capstone comes down
[26:52] then you're in perfect communion and
[26:55] that's why the the seals had to be open
[26:58] so that so that we could take a body
[27:00] change so that that uh that that third
[27:03] pool had to come so that all the
[27:05] scriptures everything all the little
[27:07] whatabouts right could be done away with
[27:10] now look what happens with with Noah
[27:12] with his third pool he he preached then
[27:14] he went in the ark then the door was
[27:17] shut and he's in there for seven days
[27:19] and his testimony was here I am inside
[27:22] of the Ark it's true the word he was
[27:25] sealed inside and they were sealed out
[27:27] Witnesses to the people that were out he
[27:29] was sealed in the process had been
[27:32] completed he was inside the ark now what
[27:35] about Abraham those three the three men
[27:37] came to him and he wasn't deceiving he
[27:39] knew there wasn't there wasn't no
[27:41] Trinity or anything he called him my
[27:43] Lord not my Lord's and and and the first
[27:47] pull of course we know that lot was down
[27:49] there in in uh brother Brown called it
[27:52] Mercy lot was down there in Sodom and
[27:54] gomorah mercy to them and they turned it
[27:57] down and then sent two angels and they
[27:59] turned that down and then God himself
[28:02] now see what there's two PE two things
[28:04] going on while while God is revealing
[28:07] himself to the elect in Genesis Chapter
[28:09] 18 he's opening up the Mysteries to
[28:11] Abraham showing him all these secret
[28:13] things while at the same time judgment
[28:16] is is is striking gamar right I like
[28:19] that picture you see how young mzc is I
[28:22] like all the people that's Jesus at 20
[28:25] years old
[28:28] that's SW came was a theophany right yes
[28:31] cuz you'd look at other pictures of mezc
[28:33] and he looks like Abraham old man God
[28:36] ain't never been
[28:38] old oldest God ever been was
[28:41] 33 in the human body but that's a good
[28:45] picture maybe maybe some of these will
[28:48] kind of stick in our minds and help us
[28:49] to remember
[28:53] yes now did you notice there was three
[28:55] pools of it three turns of it and
[28:57] another place he got three jumps when
[28:59] they went out first and call them or bid
[29:01] to come and they didn't do it so they
[29:03] went out a healing campaign went out to
[29:05] get the Blind and hard and I'm going to
[29:07] skip over man has always tried to make
[29:09] excuses not to receive God's word of his
[29:12] invitation let skip down now we see when
[29:15] God makes gives a man an invitation and
[29:17] to do something to receive the
[29:18] invitation that he's given him and he
[29:20] returns it down then there's nothing
[29:22] left after Mercy is bured but judgment
[29:25] if you step over the boundaries of Mercy
[29:27] then there's only one thing left and
[29:29] that is judgment and we find that man
[29:31] has done that in all ages it's happened
[29:34] most every age in the Bible God drawing
[29:37] us into communion with himself and if
[29:39] you turn that down after God has pulled
[29:41] out all stops with the prophets message
[29:44] had a man up there that could turn his
[29:46] back to the audience and and and reveal
[29:49] the word open the word and and call
[29:51] those those those rainbow trout that
[29:53] were deep down in that deep water that
[29:56] one of the deep things of the word
[29:59] right and Look Away to Jesus he said
[30:02] it's tightening and when that time comes
[30:04] and the Press comes to a place to where
[30:05] you're pressed then watch what I'm
[30:06] fixing to tell you in a few minutes
[30:08] watch the third pulled in see and it'll
[30:10] be absolutely to the total loss but it
[30:13] will be for the bride and the church
[30:16] that's
[30:17] right Elijah in the meal offering and
[30:20] now Jesus the son of God has com into
[30:21] this Remnant to pull the people for the
[30:24] Capstone to bring back the Son of God to
[30:27] to complete the thing for the coming of
[30:29] the Lord Jesus he said as it was in the
[30:32] days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[30:35] coming of the son of
[30:40] man and souls that are prison now and oh
[30:43] this is a powerful message remember when
[30:45] we we first heard this way back in the
[30:47] day and my goodness it it it it like it
[30:51] put fear like Peter was talking about
[30:54] that we should live in fear to do the
[30:56] word of God that's right it's the word
[30:59] living there it is if they' have only
[31:00] looked he was Messiah he was the Living
[31:02] Word made manifest and a man that's got
[31:04] the spirit of God in him or a woman
[31:06] lives that word lives right out in them
[31:09] that's the heartbeat the predestinated
[31:11] for the word of the Lord comes to them
[31:12] and they are the word to the people
[31:15] written Epistles read of all men is that
[31:18] right could the third pool be on true
[31:21] cuz you know what what I'm getting at is
[31:22] the third pull is the opening of the
[31:24] word right first pull is the opening of
[31:26] the word second pull is the opening more
[31:28] the third pool is over all world Amen
[31:31] and and he says there the lamb come and
[31:33] and took the book out of the right hand
[31:35] of him and set down and claimed what he
[31:36] owned what he had redeemed that right
[31:38] it's always been that third pull through
[31:40] is perfection the ministry come to his
[31:42] Perfection when it reproduc Christ again
[31:44] in natural amongst human beings as was
[31:48] predicted as it was in the days of lot
[31:51] which is what we're trying to do
[31:53] communion
[31:55] reproduces Christ in Earth
[31:59] I'm running out of time three jumps is
[32:01] what brother R call it cuz God's drawing
[32:04] people by three pulls that brother brand
[32:06] got up there on the stage and he put his
[32:07] hand out and put put his hand on
[32:09] people's hand drawing people come and
[32:12] see all you that lab under heavy L and
[32:15] then he began to discern the things in
[32:16] people's hearts and and calling people
[32:19] now when you get in when that when that
[32:21] word that you've heard is quickened
[32:23] inside of you then he he keeps drawing
[32:25] you up that's right through the three
[32:27] pull your journey like brother Wade
[32:29] priest years ago and and keep just keep
[32:32] drawing you up into a personal walk a
[32:35] personal
[32:37] Journey the anointed word the first pool
[32:40] healing second pull prophesying third
[32:42] pull the opening of the world the
[32:43] Mysteries revealed no more there's no
[32:45] more higher order to reveal the word
[32:46] than prophets but the only way the
[32:47] prophet can be Vindicated is by the word
[32:50] and remember the third pool is the
[32:52] opening of them Seven Seals to reveal
[32:53] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[32:55] the word it is then in that day when
[32:57] this thing is to take place that Janice
[32:58] and jam impersonators will appear again
[33:00] just like they did when Moses appeared
[33:02] with the original word to say it they
[33:04] appear to impersonate it just exactly
[33:07] right they appear to impersonate it y
[33:11] now you see what Matthew 24:24 is
[33:14] Anointed ones anointed ones that have
[33:17] that that baptism that the spirit on
[33:20] them but not in them to make them
[33:23] conform to the word to make it live
[33:26] inside of them and it it is so close
[33:29] that if were possible it would deceive
[33:31] the very
[33:35] election only the elected or
[33:38] predestinated mm will be able to detect
[33:41] that's right the difference between
[33:45] them let me read this whole I'm fixing
[33:48] to wrap it up here I just got about two
[33:49] more minutes here is the word Christ
[33:52] himself that's the anointed word which
[33:54] shall come for the rest of his body the
[33:57] bride
[33:58] the anointed of the same water that
[34:00] water the wheat as we talked about also
[34:02] Waters the Terrors anointed ones only
[34:06] the elected or predestinated will be
[34:07] able to detect the difference between
[34:09] them now I'll finish with this little
[34:11] story cuz I don't know if you've been
[34:12] following the news but there's this this
[34:14] this uh just crazy story about this fell
[34:17] in Russia or somewhere that he's got
[34:19] this horrible disease in his body so
[34:21] they going to they he's found this
[34:22] doctor is going to try this new thing
[34:25] where they're going to do the first ever
[34:27] head
[34:28] transplant they going to take his head
[34:30] off and put it on somebody else's body
[34:35] now
[34:36] look that's kind of that's kind of
[34:38] absurd but what we're talking about is
[34:40] God is building up from the feet to the
[34:43] neck and he's going to come down the
[34:45] head and have preeminence the head
[34:48] uniting with the
[34:50] body and and spiritual now and and then
[34:54] we can go in the Rapture and I'll end
[34:56] right there
[34:59] have a
[35:20] picture landed with science fiction yeah
[35:38] turn
