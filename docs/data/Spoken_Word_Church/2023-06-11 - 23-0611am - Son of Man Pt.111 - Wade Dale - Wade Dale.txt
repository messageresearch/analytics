annual anniversary event on July the 4th 1971 we started a church and uh and we continued to appreciate the Lord for letting us be here for those 50 50 something years and uh to have brother mode as our first pastor and brother Dale is our second pastor and that's been a long time we we now had to go through a bunch of administrations we appreciate that remember brother Aaron he is a brother Tom Christians today speaking uh remember on July 14th 15th and 16th now downstairs will be a sign up sheet for you to sign up to go now this is for anyone this is kind of like Ohio is for anyone to go we were going to have we are going to have a youth service on Saturday but we'll have regular church service on Sunday but anybody is welcome to go all right now the cutoff is June the 24th which will be a few weeks from now June the 24th or 25th somewhere that Sunday if you want to go and you need we're gonna the reason we need to know is we're going to double up the church will be paying for your motel room so we'll be doubling up now and we'll double up on carpool but the church will be providing the rooms that's why I need to know who's coming who's going to be there Friday and Saturday all right everybody say Amen all right I hadn't lost you yet but food and gas is your responsibility outside of what we're going to do at the venues now I talked to brother Andre yesterday Friday we're going to kind of get there when you can or when you want to it's just going to be a fellowship at the Unicoi Park from five until whenever but whenever you get there he's already rented that place and on Saturday we're not going to have it at brother uh Andre's Church we're going to have it he has rented the Methodist Camp Community Center all day so it'll be basketball volleyball we're going to have a worship service with specials get your specials ready use they're going and even adults at probably around five but I got to get my brother Joe uh and brother Joe can get my brother Andre about the song service we'll find out maybe who's going to speak that afternoon and if we can get Luis there in time maybe we can do it later on in the afternoon all right Sunday will be a regular service and I'll be speaking Sunday morning it's not an afternoon service but I need to know downstairs when you you see that sheet of paper this is important if you're going to stay over now it's about a three and a half hour drive it's very easy to get there three and a half hours from here sorry and then you may be a little bit further in Atlanta but on Sunday afternoon after the service is over we're going to go to a place called The Farmer's Daughter and it's an Amish Restaurant there they've got a place to hold about 50 people in the back excuse me brother Andres got that reserve for us for Sunday it is a Amish I mean meat and it ain't a meat in three it's like a meat and 30. because it's an Amish place and they raise their own vegetables they raise their own beef they raise all that stuff at The Farmer's Daughter afterwards so I need to know who's going to stay over for that meal now you will be responsible for that meal also but now whatever we eat at at the two camps which will be Friday evening will be sandwiches and stuff like that uh Saturday we got to get that menu nailed down but like I said before please let us know just like we did with Ohio we'll have an itinerary and let you know when to be there and what's going on but the church will pay for the motel you just need to get there and the food that you eat outside of the venue will be your responsibility so we appreciate brother Dale Pam for the motel rooms because that's the biggest expense is a place to stay so brother Andre said he did not have a place to put 45 people and that's how many signed up to go at the moment so if you want to go though please sign up we want everybody to go we will have service here that Sunday regardless there will be a service here on that Sunday and we'll give you that itinerary later on so all mine's clear Lord bless you thank you for being tentative attentive and for helping in all this and let's go to the Lord in prayer just remember these ones that are sick and not here remember the ones are on vacation the heavenly father Lord we're standing here in our Humanity knowing that without you lord we're totally insufficient we have nothing to say but father if you'll just speak for a little while to your people Lord you be the active participant in this service you do the speaking father you do the revealing Lord and I pray that you would you would heal all sick Lord from their body all the way to their soul because many souls are sin sick in this hour Lord but they can be healed there's a bomb that will cover that Lord there's also a bomb that will cover the healing of the body and father we pray that you would Quicken that to us today bless the ones that are here with us the ones that's visiting and coming in they're really not visitors they've been here before but we sure appreciate them coming Lord in this rainy day oh again thank you Lord for this rain Lord the the pro Garden was crying out yesterday thank you so much for giving us rain and father I pray that should be with us now and further on this service in Jesus name we pray we've been speaking on the son of man which we've really been on the Statue of a perfect man we're on godliness this is Part 111 yes Jonathan I am slow but we're breaking it down pretty much so this is Part 111 so let's begin with John 1 1. in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word became flesh or was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now we know that's Jesus two thousand years ago but what about in your flesh what about when he comes by the new birth and comes into you and makes your flesh huh the word all right that's what we gotta we gotta see that the statue of perfect man is making us into His Image molding us into his likeness and we behold his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full not halfway full of grace and truth you may be seeing the Lord has blessing to the reading's word second Peter 1 verse 5 says besides this giving all diligence out to your faith virtue in the virtue of knowledge and all his Temperance Temperance patience and patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity he had a man that had a problem with all these but once he got the new birth he was able to pin it into the Eternal Word of God the man named Peter Peter had issues but God said I prayed for you and he said I prayed for you Peter I know you're gonna get sifted like wheat he's just get behind me saying now he was always letting Peter have it well Amy let Peter have it then guess what he let Peter have this Revelation right here that somebody that way an old naked sailor come on somebody an old naked sailor he could have him write this and it'd be the Eternal Word of God and that we can set in 2023 and see that we have to become that hey man no going back we have to be this we're not walking backwards we're walking forward all right first Timothy 3 16 says without controversy all right great is the mystery of godliness there is a mystery connected to Godliness and you got to get all the way up and you got to have you got to have virtue and you got to have knowledge and Temperance patience all that working in your life and then God requires that you become Godly Now read you a quote I did last week where brother Brown said what so my soul brother I can't do that he said oh yes you can now we believe God sent a prophet right we believe that his words are the words that transferred from the mind of God down through him that little Kentucky Englishman and he spoke and said yes you can yes you can all right all right then I think there is a way amen that we can do it we just got to get in that way not our way this afternoon Lord willing we're going to start on brotherly kindness but the first word we're going to look at is selfishness selfishness amen there is nowhere selfishness should be in Christianity I'll read it to you I don't think I know how quote but look Paul said without controversy so in other words there's no disputation I'm not going to sit here and argue whether you say well I can be Godly and I can't or I can't and I said you can you can there is a way though that you've got to get into in that plan and and God saw Listen by foreknowledge what did God do he saw somebody make it right under this plan he saw a group of people in the end time they made it they came in the open book they understand the healing of the Soul they understand the healing of the body they know that the healing of the soul is is eternal the healing the body is temporary all right everybody with me so there was a mystery and God gave us a prophet that could go down and he would say he would say well cancer starts as a bruised cell now that wasn't in any science book that wasn't into AMA that wasn't in John Hopkins that was in the mind of God he knew that that cell started that part of cancer and he could tell you by what by a vision by somebody by him knowing that there was a great mystery so let's look at that just for a minute because if there's a mystery of godliness we need to see the mystery all right and I we know what the mystery of God is godliness is because Paul told us what it was right it's crafting you the hope of glory Pastor Ministry so mystery is what a hidden thing a secret religious Secrets confided only to the initiated now when you got up this morning and you said I'm coming to church well you didn't say you're coming to church you said you said uh maybe I don't want to go but the one inside of you said let's go okay oh I'm the only one that has that problem oh okay all right well pray for me so you initiated something inside of you that says I'm going to hear from God Amen so you're initiated or not you you said I'm going to get up and go and not to ordinary Mortals if it was the ordinary Mortals this place would be packed full of people if that's what they wanted but we have a hidden secret a hidden or secret thing not obvious to the understanding none of these are obvious to the understanding sure man has their own uh knowledge they have their own Temperance and different things but it's totally contrary to God all right so we got to look at the things that are Godly all who live Godly in Christ what shall what suffer persecution all right number three is a hidden purpose so if there's a mystery behind it it's just it's not just going to be I'm gonna unfold this and then let the air out of the bloom no no it just keeps unfolding and what you see is you see the secret hidden Mystery of God and where he is the secret Council which govern God in dealing with the righteous that's us which are hidden from ungodly and wicked men but plain to The Godly man I saw a mystery should be plain to us uh the prophet of God tells us one place he says the mystery is now what history we have an open book back during the end back during this part of the 2000 years of church ages there was a great mystery what is this seventh seal what is this Elijah coming in Malachi for all they you know they tried their best to hit it but they couldn't it took a profit in the end time to bring us the word of God to open that mystery up and say not William Brown I'm saying here I am Christ saying here I am in you all right brother Brandon was the most unselfish person in the world so we can put him up there where we can see at brotherly kindness that that's why that his son said Remember the greatest one of the greatest qualities of his dad was he did you couldn't tell who was his enemies or friends in other words when him and Billy would drive down the road for thousands of miles remember he didn't like to fly when they drive down the road from Jeffersonville to Arizona at that time it was probably about a 20-something hour trip because it wasn't many interstates back at that time they talked so you know what Billy's Billy's telling us Billy's telling us that brother Brandon didn't for two hours talking about one preacher let that sink in he didn't spend two hours at the table complaining or telling you Billy how wrong this person is or how wrong this church is or how wrong this preacher is Billy couldn't tell so brother Bradham I'll read you in just a minute well no I'll read you this afternoon brother Brown said he got a selfish Spirit on him I'll read it to you brother Branham yeah you know what if you'll read a lot he had plenty of complexes Colossians 1 verse 21 says you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled where in the body of his flesh through death to present you what read that with me holy and unblameable an unrepute reprovable in his sight all right not the side of the world but in his sight yes if big word if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard yes you have heard the gospel you have no excuse me and which was preached to you wait a minute and not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven wherefore I Paul and made a minister I like Paul's boldness but you know what he could back it up who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church in other words Paul being unselfish he's giving us listen he didn't have to go to prison he didn't have to go before Pilate I mean uh um in Rome he'd have to the Holy Spirit even warned him to go to Rome right he went anyway now he wasn't out of the will of God he was fulfilling what God saw happen in his life but Paul knew I believe that little part of Paul was always saying man I've got this thing because I put a lot of Christians to death I persecuted the very church that I'm ahead of so so I'm gonna give myself for that church unselfish we'll talk about that this afternoon wherefore I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God now watch even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and generations but now has made manifest to the Saints now Paul is standing in probably the year 80 50 something or 60 something right before he died he's standing there telling us the mystery that was hit from back in the Old Testament until today alrighty and from Generations yes but now has made manifest to his Saints so they got a mystery on unfolding but they didn't get it all right to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom look that we may present every man in Christ Jesus Bible I'm just telling you what the Bible said all right wherefore I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily boy he had something inside of him that he had to get out so we come to this and we see that Paul Paul is telling us that the great mystery is is going to be that that God's going to inhabit a group of people in their human flesh even though they are born in sin even though that that they might be healed and and and and temp It's All Temporary to the outside all right you can be healed to cancer today and die of it tomorrow night that's what brother rap said because what happens is you get that you get whatever you got you get that taken out of you but the fall was I was thinking about this yesterday that fall was so horrible that it separated God and man here stands Adam and Eve nothing going on full Fellowship their bodies being renewed they're not getting older they're not stooping over for hundreds of thousands of years they walked through the garden with God but all of a sudden the fall happened and then the presence of God was separated so that he can't deal with man like he used to so what'd he do he took that he put the curse on his flesh remember he didn't curse Adam he encouraged Adam Saul he couldn't he can't curse his own self if you're born again today you're not under the curse he has revealed to you that you are his and he can't curse himself Hallelujah you're covered man buys blood and he can't ever if he ever loved you he can't unlove you don't ever say God don't love me no more no he don't love you no less either he's loved you from the beginning he can't unlove you you cannot love yourself oh yeah but when Jesus was here he said okay we're going to have this great mystery I'm going to come into this people I'm going to come and be the I'm the Holy Ghost because that's what now you can um agree with me or not but when we're in the Garden of Eden there stands God and Adam and there's nothing in between all right there's no there's no wall total just there's there's really no Mysteries now God withholds a mystery because he knew they were going to fall but he didn't tell Adam because Adam was a free moral agent he let Adam choose right all right we're all on free moral ages he preached on that several several weeks you didn't come here with eternal life and just Lock Stock and Barrel sealed and ready to go I'm sorry you were born in sin now you had representation in the Bible and the word of God you had representation but when you got here you was Dirty Rotten filthy born in sin shaper than the neck with the prophet said bound he said I was on my way to hell but thank God Jesus now we take John 3 16 as the Lord's Prayer right Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be the name thy kingdom come thy will be done all that to me that's to the world to me that's that's to the world like we were talking about last Sunday there's a big difference between being saved and being born again amen big difference you can be saved and be lost and go to hell but you can't be born again and be lost and go to hell so there's a difference and say people can be can be given eternal life but they don't have eternal life right believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved now that would be if somebody want to give their heart at a deathbed confession or or something like that and they died they would not go in the sixth Dimension because that's where we would go if we pass away which is the born-again but they would be somewhere and then if the day of judgment they would be given eternal life right but if you're born again like I said before you can be saved and not be born again but you can't be born again and not be saved amen all right you got to go through that salvation plan and if you stop that's your business but the Bible says believe in the Lord Jesus Christ there's a lot of people going to be saved there's not going to be in this group that Jesus came to get amen he wouldn't all be saved but when he come down to the very end yes he died for every person but he knew this group right here would be the only group he was going that was going to receive his Blessing of eternal life and that's his bride or his body is everybody with me John 17 verse 10 says and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them oh where's the glory of God me and you but listen you tell the world that first thing you're going to say what ain't perfect and you ain't perfect don't tell me you perfect well I'm not God told me I was perfect and now I asked to me this is the bride's prayer Brother John this is Jesus praying to put to put a comforter he said he was going to come back send a comforter that'll lead us and got us into all truth right the true Holy Ghost and I saw not just anointing on our spirit realm or even anointing on our bodies everybody with me we know this is Anointed ones at the end time time all right and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world now remember I told you Jesus didn't say father Shield them from the world put a bubble around them make sure that make sure that they don't get no bills no more when they get born again make sure that car don't tear up make sure your house gets somehow supernaturally painted and for your sister supernaturally cleaned I wish everybody with me that's when your problems start is when you become a Christian all right you might get an extra bill but uh but the world's not going to realize and understands you they're not going to understand us they never will because listen I'm gonna read it right here Jesus said you're of me if the world hated me they're gonna hate you but I prayed for you Peters I prayed for you I prayed for you bride this is the prayer to the bride and now I'm no more in the world but these are in the world I come to thee Holy Father keeps doing thy own name now what is the name of the Father the Lord Jesus Christ we know that whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are oh but brother wait I can't be the Bible says yes you can Jesus prayed a prayer have you ever heard a prayer Jesus now listen we prayed a lot of prayers that didn't come to pass hello Jesus never prayed a prayer that didn't come to pass though all right so I'm gonna tell you this prayer is going to come to pass while I was with him in the world I kept him in my name oh yeah he hearded those 12 and one of them was a son of perdition those that thou give us me I have kept and none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come out to thee these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves I have given them Thy Word amen we'll talk about amen that word is a seed all right and the world had hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should have keep them from the evil yes that's in the world they are not off the office even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth that's why the word is the most important thing and our life is getting the word of God and getting it down right as thou has sent me into the world even so I have sent them into the world so he's not put them in a bubble he's not put them in a camp hello somebody he's not put them in a commune he puts you in the world to rub shoulders with the world for the world to see Christ in you the hope of glory as thou has sent me in the world even so I have sent them into the world and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray now here he's praying again neither pray I for these alone what is 12. but for them also ask me which Shall Believe on me through the words they preach that they all might be 12 14 18 23 no one amen as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in US protect me Lord put me inside of you again that the world may believe that thou has sent me the glory which thou gaveth me I took with me that they may be one even as we are one how many times as he said that that's about the third time he be made and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou Hast loved me Romans 8 heirs and Joint heirs whatever he gets we give father I will that they also whom thou give us me be with me where I am he wasn't just want y'all to be in the world he's taking you to a place where he's at man and we got to come to that place spiritually here amen hello somebody we got to come to that place fiercely here like Christ did with the headstones the statue of perfect man we'll get into that later on that they may behold my glory where in a book on a tape now in your flight and your life your everyday walk or I am that day May behold my glory yes which thou has given me for thou loveth me before the foundation of the world now wait a minute hold on what did Jesus say that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world right now hold on man oh and the glory which thou give us me I give them that they may be one even as We Are One he must have loved this before the foundation of the world hey man and what do we do we got to give it back there's a connection there everybody with me so there's the prayer to the bride to keep us from the evil not take us out of the evil now we're going to be taken out I promise you when the Rapture takes place we're gonna be out of here we're not gonna stand any of this junk that's going on now but we still have to live here and be what functional Christians yes someone walking talking breathing the word of God not just quoting it I'm in the message that's what the devil says the devil can say that but the message is not in him but you can say the message is in you amen John 17 what is the message the good news it's the gospel I was listening to him um song this morning you know when the trumpet sounds the dead are going to rise you know and we shall rise and bring all and I know everybody's sitting in that Stadium it was Jason Crabb or somebody was singing it on YouTube in their heart in their Doctrine and their gospel they're going Something's Gonna just walk out and go [Music] right you asked somebody out in the world what's going on all that trumpet we're gonna hear that trumpet sound it's sounding now in the gospel it's sounding according to brother Branham it's here the trumpet sounding will be a bride standing on the earth at the end times that says death you don't have any dominion over us and now death come on somebody you don't have any dominion over them that are in that other dimension bring them here we're going home but we got a journey to go through it's not just we're not going from kindergarten to college Renee it had been that easy wouldn't it no it wouldn't have you'd be in college with being kindergarten be drawn on the wall no you have to go through the process you have to grow up all right they've all grown into fine individuals Bob and Sharon's done a good job with their kids we sure appreciate that I mean Ben and Sharon Bob done good job with his too man don't tell your daddy I called your daddy no do it please I pay you Genesis 17 what when Abram was 90 and nine nobody heard 99 there's one getting close but the Lord appeared to Abram and said I am almighty God walk before me and try to be thou perfect oh it says and be thou perfect Now That Word Perfect is what complete morally innocent having Integrity one who is morally and ethically pure and like I said before when we look at the word godliness we see reverence respect piety towards God and remember I gave you a list for those of you that weren't here we talk about living godliness and then brother Brown says right here said you're moving right on up to line fifthly at godliness Temperance patience wow you say I can't do that brother Branham oh yes you can you can live this godliness you say well I I what do I do listen but when we are judged we're going to read this this afternoon at the communion service but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord now that word is instructed we are instructed on how to be this godliness that we should not be condemned with the world Saint John 17. he took us out of the condemnation of the world we we are not condemned with the world everybody that's not born again is condemned with the world whatever the world gets they give I don't care if you foolish virgin I don't care if you just saved if you're not filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost today by the new birth in your soul the old you dead and the New Life coming in to live it through you you will be here when the world is judged sorry about that Noah didn't shut the art God did God's getting ready to shut the ark I told you before we're going to talk about back again um in just a second but I have a list and I want you to kind of think about you see I can't live Godly I can't live this godliness which is piety which is which is uh Perfection as the world would say but we would say it would be completion or how complete we are but not complete according to the world into the Bible hey about with me well I can't I can't I don't know we're not a denomination that makes us closer to God than the denominations because we've been taught we'll talk about the horse forehead in a minute you sisters don't cut your hair well that's what the Bible says so guess what 99.9 of the people in this world are not living Godly because they cut their hair but you are you are living Godly all right dress the world don't mind wearing pants they don't even mind wearing shorts to church now they have no respect but you do and then we've had some that come in Among Us the new people they'd come in wearing pants the girl the ladies and brother Dale never got down and and you know nailed them to a tree you just preached the word something's got to change from inside anyway a lot of y'all I mean a lot of y'all if you if you're wearing pants now then you know you're not born again number one see what I mean you moved yourself from godliness over to this group all right uh what about uh your our actions and as I said before uh many big churches and I'm not knocking them they're doing the best they can but most churches have the program for the widowed a program for the divorced a program for the divorce singles a program for the you understand you understand for the for the alcoholics the a program for the smokers do we need to add on to the church huh well then we're living more Godly than they are everybody with me on this all right our manner of life we don't smoke drink cuss I hope you never get a DUI that means you're drunk but if you don't ever drink well Jonathan if you never drink we don't if you never drink that law of uh blowing 0.08 or whatever it is to make you legally drunk to you don't even worry the books I don't even worry about it I don't keep up with that right but man I'm telling you the people at home being the mayor of the city oh Lord they want to have alcohol in the convenience store and they want to have all this stuff they're worried about that now I'm not worried about it you shouldn't be worried about where the beer costs six dollars a can instead of five but there's a lot of people got up this morning cussing about yeah we say cousin about all that do y'all have to do you worry about that no we you're living more girly than 99 of the denominational world you're clean according to his Divine Powers giving us all things at what pertaining to life yes we have life lessons here because we live a life I would love sister Nikki from my life to be Godly 100 of the time sorry pray for me if you are pray for me I ain't we need he's still working on me to make me what I want to be but we live more Godly than the world does obviously now we live in more Godly than the denominations which the Bible says they have a horse forehead I know it's a strange a strong word to use but explain it to your kids if you need to explain to them we know what a is a some person that can't contain their self now buy with me yeah all right and it's in the Bible we'll talk about in just a second because that's what this world's come to and we're not we're out of that yeah yeah we don't have a horse forehead if you're not in if you're not born again you have one already am I with you are you with me I don't want to hurt your feelings but if you're not born again you have a horse forehead yes you are selfish we'll read about it later talk about it later on we don't have to worry about what bar is closed and what bar is open right just want to make sure that we be not condemned with the world the world's over here and get their condemnation you and I have come out of the world we're over here living listen we fall that's what Grace is for listen God didn't want to take Grace and put it on shelf Grace is to be Redemption it was given for us to use it so use it now listen don't use greasy Grace but now listen if you're in Greasy Grace get born again and then he'll start being some good grace some good grace that if you do make a mistake you do say something sideways to somebody so God forgive me how did God tell me yesterday on the phone it worried him to death somebody passed away and he owed him ten dollars so he said he went to the grave and he said he said buddy he said I'm sorry this guy just died well it was um James Lau yeah James Lowe uh he was a motor builder for uh Bill Elliott back in the 80s and he was like well known all over the the community well he passed away so this guy walks up and he says man I'm sorry I said I owed you ten dollars I'm sorry there's nothing I can do about it he said there was another man standing beside of him at the grave so he looked over and said he don't need it now oh but you know that stuff like that bothers you because you live more Godly than than somebody's saying I cheated him out of ten dollars and I'm happy about it right listen when people steal stuff they don't steal it to be sad they steal it to be happy amen somebody have you ever thought about that they don't steal something go I just got 12 million dollars diamonds no you never see him again if you don't get caught he's over in the Bahamas somewhere living it up he's happy that's why Satan is happy when he seals your victory I won't ask to make him the most miserable person on the face of the Earth and in another dimension and you know what he's even in heaven I want him to be nervous real nervous I want him to be pill-taking nervous I thought I'd throw that in there but this whole thing is is is what we've been the series we've been on I hope it's been helping us in our life and helping us to be more Godly than we have before John is teaching us how to do the Life part and the godliness part through money and through finances and and all that we really appreciate that because you know what it's the whole thing there's people and and out of the world uh you know you get these scammers call you and you get people call you about social security they will not call you about that on cell phone all right they'll send you a letter I work for the Post Office the IRS will not contact you on the phone they send you a letter through the post office everybody with me life lesson here don't get on the phone and let them tell you you owe them two thousand dollars and you bought numbers Rock if you give them your number but I had a girl one time at the post office young girl she was on the phone had it on speaker I walked in from working and there it was she had owed 2500 more dollars they said on her taxes and they were going to send the sheriff out the next day with a warrant for her arrest if she didn't pay that twenty five hundred dollars well they went through this and Kelly's late didn't mean to call her name she said I know I let me call my let me call my um accountant let me call and I'm over going hang up Jesus this is serious well see that's how much they had scammed her I mean get serious I said no it's not so what I've done is I immediately pulled up IRS scam well there was five things on my phone and I went over and I said read it he's done all five while I've been standing here she said oh Lord she ain't she just hangs the phone up then and she said I was getting ready to give them my number well they had to pull more than 2500 if it had been just if it had been more than that in your account but listen the point is there are people in this world that are scammers that get up in the morning go to work just like you get up and go to work to a public good paying job honest job they get up and do the same thing to scam you to mess you out of your hard-earned money but you know what that's over here they will be condemned with the world I hope they never do it to a bride of Jesus Christ I'll promise you the fires of Hell will rain down on them so but you don't get you don't don't do that okay don't no information on the phone I don't care if it sounds good what's y'all say if it sounds good is what too good to be true all right now life lesson number 743 now we're going and besides this giving all diligence so we're going to work on life we're going to work on godliness and besides this giving all diligence add add what so look let's look at this just for a minute we were looking at last Sunday let's look at it just for a minute for them for the ones that weren't here we're looking at the analogy or the um the parable of the sore of the sea now remember who is the sower the sower is the son of man the ministry that today I am showing hopefully I'm sowing good seed all right but now remember the ground is you the ground is yours if you came in with a bad attitude where's that seed gonna land if you come in with something on your heart that's why I said you better get it read get rid of it right back there and then come in here and enjoy the service but we know the seed is the word of God every time God talks about a seed in the Bible and brother random talks about a seed he's talking about not talking about some Wiggly Little sperm with a tail on it everybody with me that is not what God is all about Adam's seed polluted the world his natural sperm polluted the world hey man brother Brown said that we should know it without a quote but the seed is the word or the sermon you hear or the Bible you read all right and the ground is yours not this Earth your Earth today you come to get spiritual water if the word has been planted if there's no word there it ain't coming up because there's no seed there to come up everybody with me so everybody knows the parable of the sore of the seed so we're going to continue on down a little bit further because remember he explained it in detail here you therefore the parable of the sower all right so is who son of man the ministry we're under the son of man Ministry we're under the ministry of the sower of the seed all right we have a former reign which is this rain right here which is a teaching Reign which is when you plant the seed I needed this rain for my crops I planted some extra ones yesterday so praise God they'll come up the other ones didn't because it didn't have good moisture all right so then there will be a rain in September or around October that will be a harvest rain that'll be the rain righted end that pops everything to maturity that makes that corn of wheat get real heavy and hang over because it's become back to the original that's when my apple trees in September those things limbs that I used to cut grass underneath didn't hit my head I hit my head all the time on apples why they they they're coming to maturity they're heavy the apples are big then you get that last rain and you know you look at your corn Chucks and and they start drying out you need that one more good rain to just make everything and that's the same way with me and you we're gonna have that one more good rain I believe we're having it now to mature the bride to get us ready for Harvest to get us ready to get out of here amen this world is not my home I'm just passing through right my treasures are laid up wear here no somewhere beyond the blue all right here you therefore the parable of the sore when anyone heareth the word of the Kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catch us away that which was sown look in his heart now remember be careful that is not the heart of the soul of you Satan can't steal anything out of your soul your soul is sealed until the day of your Redemption Satan can't make your soul sin he can't make your soul make a mistake we'll be happy in that if you're sealed in he's sealed out but now that second realm that we're working memory reason conscious effects of imagination that is his playground God has allowed him yes that access to your brain to your memory your reasoning your conscious affects imagination there's the Battleground listen there is no battle in your soul if you're born again it's God if you're not it's the devil that's just plain as black and white all right so what are we dealing with here with the Statue of perfect man though we're dealing with that second realm or that Spirit realm of man you you so sometimes we do hear the word but you remember in Ezekiel remember he gives he takes the Stony heart out and gives you a new new heart brother Brown said that's not the new birth all right he's trying to soften you up under sanctification to get you ready for God to come in and we've been taught that for 50 something years so we know that's the truth but now that's sanctification that's not the Holy Ghost the good man of the house oh sure everything's been cleaned out but there's the devil going to come back according to Luke right unclean Spirit goes out of a man walks in dry places comes back comes back finds the house swept in garnished but the doors are still open it's not been sealed you need to get it sealed until the day of your Redemption therefore he cannot get into your that part of your house when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not that means you didn't study that means you didn't prepare yourself that means you just came here because you was afraid I'd say something if you did praise the Lord anyhow then coming to Wicked one and catch us away that which was sown in his heart we've seen that they come here they disappear this is he which receives seed by the wayside in other words on their way they sat down in the church and heard of a message and it sounded good it sounded different I know something you don't know but you got to know Christ first you got to get born again first I Pro listen I promise you you get born again it will take you to the message because it has to lead you and guide you into Altru it's not just some truth all right so you get the Holy Ghost first that's my brother Ram said most important get the Holy Ghost and it will drive you to the message listen folks you you don't have to I was listening to preacher the other day he said you don't have to beg a Christian to come to church and we still beg and they still don't come but he that was just Stony places what you got some issues you had a problem with your wife on the way to church or your kids on the way to church you got that Stony heart you sit here and worry about it I don't for me to be quiet so you can go outside and bless your wife out or wait a minute vice versa are your kids or your neighbor when I get home I'm going to church better time out but when I get back and I'm gonna drive two or three people off the road getting there road rage yeah it happens the same as he that Hearth the word now watch here's another one but either received seed in the Stony places the same as he that here at the word all right and are not with joy receiving oh man it's great but wait I felt some I want you like bro dancing I'll send you back y'all be shouting and speaking in tongues so I told William Berlin he was staying with us in our when we put the shower in we put the it's one limit does this and it says hot on this side and cold on this side well me and dad put it together backwards I don't know if he did just to play with him because that's where we put all the preachers at so he went over to the hot side it stayed cold he never did he said this is Heist it must be something wrong with the hot water heater so he gets in there you can hear him wow wow come out I said you're not speaking in tongue he said that water cold I said ain't nothing worse than a cold preacher I said if you'll turn it on the other side so we put a little thing June's laughing now I'm sure that we put a little sign that says this backwards and for the use of this is the hot over here which says see life lesson 769 don't ever do that to a preacher the same as he here at the word and we receive it with joy shout pink and tongue yet hath not root he didn't sit there long enough or she to get rooted and grounded to that when the wind did blow it didn't knock your plan over some people it knocks him out of church some people that want it so bad their feet that tree bends them Roots get loose but they don't fall over they might get loose a little bit why they're loosen the soil up so they can grow some more they're loosen in the soil that's why wind blows you either hath no root in himself but endureth for a Time hangs around for a little while for when tribulation or persecution arise oh because of what not somebody because of the word by and by He Is offended he also that receives seed among Thorns is he that heareth the word his sermon comes to church and the cares of this world well I got to work on Sunday I can't get here on Wednesday because I go to work some of you have to and I understand but don't make it an excuse if you make it your crutch then you're in this part right here and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word now the word's not choked you are you're choking the word and he becometh unfruitful but he that receives seed in good ground we're just going to say we all had good ground today he never received seed or heard the message or the word of God into good ground is he that heareth the word an understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some 100 some 60 and some 30. not everybody's going to be a hundred my man not everybody there's going to be a lot of 16 a lot of 30 which means it's a 30 percent though it was just as important as the hundred percent all right everybody with me so there's that Parable then let's look for a second of this horse forehead because I want you to understand there was a question about this it does sound awful and it is awful God hates it there's a lot of things God Haze you know that look it up in the Bible God hates a lot of things so when Jeremiah talks about therefore the showers have been withholden and it has been a lot of rain in other words no Harvest rain seed's been planted but it was wrong timing and thou Hast the horse forehead thou refuses to be a shame now that word means highly fed and therefore want and in other words to commit fornication be a harlot to be unfaithful to God because he told Israel one time he said you've went whoring and I had to put you away what were they doing they were sacrificing to other idols are you sacrificing today to other idols to something that's keeping you out of church something that's keeping you away from The Fellowship Of God with God and with his people all right to play the Harlot to cause the commit adulterer to adultery or to commit fornication but I like that one said highly fed that means man just get just give me all the worlds you can give me I can't control myself because that's what a does a can't can't keep theirself all right everybody with me but God said they have a horse forehead from an unused root word man to be clear or conspicuous which is the brow or the forehead so so you've got unclean and then you've got what you've it's at the Forefront some of us have real prominent foreheads remember a collie some of y'all but you you see that though I can look back here and I see your forehead so what's happening in the in the religious Realm a horse forehead is is something that's being shown that they don't care whether they show it or not that's why this is the ungodly group we are The Godly group because we don't have a horse forehead we are we are keeping ourself in the word of God we are not one time we are not uh highly fed except for the word of God we're not highly fed in the world so this is a this is a um a definition brother Brown doesn't say anything about horse forehead I think he makes a comment about it one time or reads it one time but this is used in the Bible as an analogy for a person or a group now if this doesn't cover the Church of the day I don't know what does our church who has broken all meaning of integrity now the church has broken all meaning of integrity so severely they no longer recognize the damage of the evil of their actions women come to church with their hair cut they come to church with pants on they just come to church anyway you know what I mean the big thing is Come As You Are I believe that but if you come as you are you won't go away as you came if you really get something you will not go away as you came if you get something I can't agree with that come as you are come on Cindy came sister came for two three months and then nobody had to blast her over the head about it she quit wearing earrings she quit wearing makeup she quit wearing pants dad just sat there and preached the word of God and just remind them that it's in the Bible and you remind you know all this all these things and you let them do it their own self that's better than having to be a slave to do it all right it is a relevant term today describing how the average person's sense of right or wrong has been warped from its natural we're not living in that world shooting on every hand transgender I I love this guy his license he's not back but it's something else they were challenging him a transgender was challenging him on something about male and female he said I just want to ask one question he said how many of you that was born a man have ever given birth can't happen won't happen won't ever happen so that person you know goes off on his face and answer my question how many men in the Dawn and history of time he said all the way from recorded history how many people that were born men all right has had a baby well well none well okay then we know there's a separation between a male and a female hello somebody I mean see look back to the world it's become now the natural thing to be whatever you want to be not here we have godliness now they're bringing it into churches the Methodist Church allowing every bit of that parts of the Methodist church thank God there's a part of the church that's standing up says no our neighbor he said I'm not listening to a gay woman tell me about God is it okay because he's a Methodist but you see how that see we don't debate that here that's never a debate we don't debate clothes we don't have we don't debate whether it's father son holy ghost or Lord Jesus Christ do we we don't do debate those things in here we don't debate debate there's no difference great is the mystery of godliness because he come into me and you told us how to live what the bible really says or in other words what it means straight from the mind of God people in the world they got their own work sense this has led to the destruction of marriage massive numbers of fatherless homes and bastard births I'm sorry it is nothing now for a woman to get pregnant out of wedlock it's nothing it's just wide open sorry 30 percent to Upward of 80 percent illegitimacy rate in some groups now in the Old Testament if you were born a bastard child you didn't you and your family you and whoever was didn't go in the congregation for 400 years 400 years you were barred from going to church wow and We Know listen we've done been through this so the blood of Jesus Christ takes care of that now I don't care if he was born and you don't even know who your mom and daddy is it's your choice whether you get the new birth or not it's your choice whether you whether you uh let that bother you or not sure we let it bother us I know that because humanly it bothers us but but you're not going to hear from this pulpit and from the pulpit of the message of the hour that you're going to hell because you're a bastard child and you can't come in the congregation no the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse if you'll do it the right way don't come in with greasy Grace though and keep doing it have four kids and well I'm under grace where's the husband I well all four of them gone well that's not that's greasy Grace don't do that open and increase sexual perversion homosexuality pedophilia transvestite bestality pornography adultery prostitution and the sexualization of young children especially girls have we not seen that that's a forehead that's that's become accepted practice now when I was growing up it wasn't if a girl got pregnant when I was growing up she disappeared for a little while anybody with me now who's the daddy I don't know these passages all have a similar context they were written just prior to the fall and scattering of either Israel to the north of Judah to the South each shows a wealthy people unblinkingly focused on their pleasure is that not the United States of stinking America giving no thought to God listen we raised to that ceiling just so we could stay in debt how's that fit brother John how's that feel we raise the debt ceiling so we can borrow more our credit card went to 70 trillion instead of 40 trillion there's got to be a day that that's going to fall but they unblinkingly focus on Pleasure giving no thought to God they're casually uninterested in the moral welfare welfare of their Nation that is crashing into utter depravity shame for sin has disappeared amen the interpreters commentary the Bible states that the Bible shows that in a period before Nations fell their societies show significant breakdowns in two areas political and business hello somebody and in family life with specific blame falling on women churches women are churches brother Brown said the weakness is what pulpep he said uh not it's not of children or juvenile delinquency is what parental delinquency and these passages the Fallen characteristics are either directly named or strongly implied Rebellion obstinacy betrayal distrust shamelessness and greed now I hope we don't have that problem here an audacious self-centeredness against God and fellow man we're going to talk about selfishness this afternoon these are not the characteristics of a nation that would bring honor to God at one time in the history of this nation the overwhelming majority of people expressed a strong sense of Shame when they sinned Shane was an ugly thing and due to these sense of Shame they did whatever they could to hide their moral flaws from others but today the horse forehead is all painted right here look at me some of that still exists the period of late 1950s and 60s was probably the beginning of the end of that attitude sin has gradually carried less of a stigma and the sense of Shame has been slowly replaced by a growing boldness of attitude a flocking of sin much of that sense of Shame has disappeared from the American psyche some remains in a small percentage of the population thank God that's why we living God garlic territory but we'll subcute him because if we stand here against that they're going to persecute us yet increasingly bold immorality has become the way of life so that sin is now blatantly committed civility is becoming a thing of the past rudeness and open Brazen misconduct is becoming the normal way of doing things if this is not the world come on that's what the conduct of a horse forehead pictures it represents the blatant audacious sin of the streetwalker who is out in public openly displaying what she is promoting herself and tempting others to engage in sin with her wow I've had enough of that let's talk about godliness for a second I had enough of that so here's that group over here and listen folks you may think that's that that's you know we say we got the the world that don't care about God we got the world that thinks a little bit about God the world that goes to church under their denominance denominational idea and then you got the bride well every bit of that is from us now that's for most down I'm saying us too because we let a lot of stuff creep in Houston not creep in churches in the message either oh don't say now brother wait now you did good till you put us in that in that room yeah well you just look around takes a lot of things goes on in the church that and this one and others not just this one that that you know 40 years ago wouldn't happen why because it's right you know what you see it you look around a deity is a supernatural the shaping of Western Christianity well let's get to deity for just a second then we'll close it was coined by Saint Augustine the Theologian whose writings were very influential in the shaping of the western Christianity deity comes from the Latin word for God Dias the divine nature of deities is believed to be immortal goodness and powerfulness or any supernatural being brother Ram tells us right here and he swore by himself in 1954. he said let's just read the red in it the same life that was in the corn down here at the first talk is in it up here in the ear of the grain just the same the same God within the pill of fire was in Christ Jesus all right hold on the same one in Christ Jesus and you that's right God in you the hope of glory is that right the baptism of the Holy Spirit dwelling in the person now you become what sons of God no wonder he believes in the Supernatural no wonder he believes in anything why is it in him as a portion of God wow wrapped up in that mortal body where there's sin and everything else has created this body but down in there some work of God Alone in regeneration somehow he come down through all that mess and save yourself has come down through there by the shedding of his own blood taking away that blood that was in there as a way and set it aside and entered into this sinful man and put him in a hope that he'd die for it just as freely as he'd stand there now what's he saying in in simple terms you still got your old stinking blood because you were born in sin shaping a nickel you came from your daddy's sperm and your mama would give you the body right everybody with me and that's inside of you and that that you know the song his royal blood flows through my veins and not happening right now but by what representation of his blood last brother Ryan talks about a blood transfusion but he said right here see I like what he said and set it aside he shed his own blood and taken away that blood that was in there not taking your blood all the way out but as a way and set it aside and entered into this sinful man and put him in a hope that he'd die let's stand to her feet we'll stop right there we'll finish this afternoon we didn't even get the godliness much musicians come let's sing a song but we got to believe that we're not just another part of God in another situation or another separation we are God made manifest in another form called bride right so right here brother
