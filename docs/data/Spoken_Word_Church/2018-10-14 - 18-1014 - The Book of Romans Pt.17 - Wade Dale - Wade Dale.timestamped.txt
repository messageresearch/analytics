[0:00] they're so uh-huh here we go well I
[0:05] wanted on here more than me but I'm
[0:07] gonna stand right here that's what I was
[0:09] trying to trying to say something
[0:11] Bob's helping Joe upstairs brother
[0:15] Anderson is right a little bit late so
[0:19] we're saved by hope the hope that is
[0:22] seen is not hope for one of Mencia why
[0:24] does he hope for Abraham didn't have to
[0:27] hope for the baby because the baby was
[0:30] here when at the time when they were
[0:32] turned back but they had to be turned
[0:33] back to young men and women to have the
[0:36] baby but when they got to turn back the
[0:38] young men and women man and woman they
[0:41] had the baby we had enough of hope for
[0:42] the baby the more there was there was an
[0:44] I think there was the product of what
[0:47] had been prophesied that's my brother
[0:50] Adam tells us that we have to meet male
[0:53] kenseth II just like Abraham did every
[0:57] son of the faith will meet and take that
[0:59] journey than Abraham took because
[1:00] Abraham journey was by faith but he met
[1:05] God in human flesh called Milko today
[1:08] and then after that 28 days later he
[1:12] said according to the time of life which
[1:15] the 28 days sample according to the time
[1:17] alone you'll have it in other words
[1:19] you'll have a baby one out here's the
[1:21] mystery that I want to leave my talking
[1:23] about upstairs here's the mystery he
[1:26] never told Abraham and Sarah how he
[1:32] never told him how he said 28 days
[1:36] you're gonna help you'll have a baby and
[1:38] they brands like well okay that's why
[1:40] Sarah laughed in her heart she said me
[1:43] have pleasure with my lord again she
[1:45] knew what he was gonna take to have the
[1:46] baby and then she has having it anymore
[1:49] and he didn't either so
[1:52] supernaturally what I'm trying to say is
[1:55] I'm going we're going through the seals
[1:57] we have the steelbook brother branham
[2:00] spent one night on the force deal
[2:02] we've been now ten services on the force
[2:04] field to try to get an understanding
[2:07] we'll see what happened was he gave
[2:11] brother round them something to give to
[2:12] us but you and I don't have to figure
[2:14] out the end between you and I got to
[2:16] figure out the details cuz he never told
[2:18] Abraham acero
[2:19] now I'm gonna come in one morning you're
[2:21] gonna wake up you see what I'm saying he
[2:22] didn't go through and say you're gonna
[2:23] help he just see you going out baby
[2:25] right the part in between was Abraham's
[2:30] faith and Sarah's faith to believe what
[2:33] God had already said and it wasn't a
[2:36] prophecy anymore it was a reality when
[2:38] he came to pass so what we've been
[2:41] talking about upstairs is those who
[2:43] prophesy must die so everybody that
[2:45] prophesy does not why because you
[2:47] prophesied to somebody else
[2:49] brother Branham prophesied of you and
[2:51] I'm sitting here that's why he had to
[2:53] pass up Jesus had to die because he
[2:56] promised I'd of a ride and now here we
[2:58] come people were coming so you see what
[3:00] I'm saying so anybody that prophesize
[3:02] all that's good you know we're going to
[3:04] go on a rapture no you got to bring it
[3:07] to where the ground said Abraham as good
[3:11] as had the child the day God told him
[3:14] that now you have to wait 25 years to
[3:16] get it we've had to wait 50 something
[3:18] geared for the property being off the
[3:20] same but you and I are gonna have to get
[3:22] booked you aren't wrong I'm saying the
[3:23] seal books about that thick and there's
[3:27] well you've got the breech and then
[3:29] you've got guarding simplicity you got
[3:31] seven eight nine ten sermons when you go
[3:36] to questions and answer then that one
[3:37] book well in that one book the
[3:40] revelation that comes out of that book
[3:41] is gonna change our body and it's going
[3:43] to it has sustained us for 50 something
[3:48] years but it had to nobody said the body
[3:52] change it it's in that book reference
[3:57] AIDS lies in the books in the tape
[3:59] so it's our responsibility it was
[4:01] Abraham's responsibility in other words
[4:03] to carry out what God had told him I'm
[4:06] always telling you before why didn't God
[4:08] went down when he first went Abraham why
[4:11] had he changed him right then you ever
[4:14] thought about left of God can do it he
[4:16] might he just changed Abraham changed
[4:18] Sarah and actually didn't have to change
[4:20] Abraham hello you know James Abraham
[4:25] Abraham to have a child because he had
[4:27] Ishmael so he could produce she's the
[4:30] one who couldn't predict so he had to
[4:32] change the bride yeah change the bride
[4:37] change we're talking about our Heavenly
[4:40] Father God that maybe I'm afraid needing
[4:46] a change at that time but on as we go on
[4:51] the natural story yes he had to have a
[4:53] change because it's what his body was
[4:56] doing as faith then his faith didn't
[4:58] waver but his body was going just like
[5:00] ours do I know he did change Sarah
[5:13] didn't changer at the moment when he
[5:15] told Abraham at the beginning of the
[5:17] journey
[5:17] he didn't tell something he didn't even
[5:19] tell Abraham he was gonna have the baby
[5:21] by Sarah if he had told him the whole
[5:23] story
[5:24] there would not have been an
[5:25] instrumental and there was gonna been a
[5:27] Hagar till they ramble to camp itself
[5:30] and waited for Sarah right what am I
[5:35] saying is God lets us go out through
[5:37] this journey as a free moral agent and
[5:42] not and we've tried to figure it out for
[5:45] years will Abraham trying to figure it
[5:47] out and got in trouble he finally said
[5:49] one day Abraham said can't have this
[5:51] baby no more I can't produce it any more
[5:54] I don't I can't even with a young Hagar
[5:56] you know they ever say what I'm saying
[5:58] so he got to one day before you just
[6:00] went email mail Kevin they can I believe
[6:01] Abraham in his heart said dot if you
[6:04] don't do something I'm gonna die cuz I'm
[6:06] 99 years old and then God comes on the
[6:10] scene just like the children of Israel I
[6:11] was reading a couple of things coming
[6:12] the children of Israel were okay you
[6:15] need you until Pharaoh started pulling
[6:19] things out of there you can't use this
[6:21] and you can't use them you got you got
[6:24] to double your production and all that
[6:26] stuff well then they started crying for
[6:28] a deliverer that's our problem that's
[6:30] why the brother brown said the bride
[6:31] does better on the persecution why are
[6:32] we persecuted well I heavenly things no
[6:34] we got one in our pocket we go home and
[6:36] we eat we go out and eat there's enough
[6:39] cars sitting out here it's a million
[6:41] dollars where the cars almost sitting
[6:43] out here in the parking lot in our
[6:44] parking lot
[6:45] so they've gotta come a time where
[6:50] something's got to come to put our focus
[6:55] back on dependent on God I mean really
[6:58] how many times do we depend on God yeah
[7:00] we depend on God for a lot of things but
[7:01] don't pin on God for our food
[7:03] go to Walmart oh right sighing Damon
[7:14] they take that little thing no I mean we
[7:17] do and I was thinking the other day our
[7:20] sustainability of life guard allows that
[7:23] because that's what he knew we were
[7:24] going to this was going to be this way I
[7:25] mean this is not a surprise to him so he
[7:28] knew that same way with Abraham Sarah he
[7:30] can how long it's gonna take them and
[7:31] have that baby don't you think no Kenzi
[7:32] don't guys anything walked off and said
[7:34] Abraham I talked to you 25 years ago no
[7:37] there was a position what we're going to
[7:40] talk about this afternoon and second
[7:41] service there's a position that
[7:43] everybody has to come to thank God and
[7:47] it goes along with this that God comes
[7:49] to you in that position right because
[7:55] the Son of God was down through the
[7:56] seventh church ages but why does the Son
[7:59] of Man have to appear back in the end
[8:01] time it's promised the son of man had to
[8:02] appear in the intact
[8:04] why for you and I because it's not oh
[8:08] man you're the one that knows nothing
[8:10] about each other
[8:12] the only one that knows I'm type of
[8:14] money James the son of man cuz he's the
[8:15] one who went through so yeah
[8:21] that's great sure and he actually has to
[8:28] let things happen cuz you know what here
[8:30] you got a lot you got to bring lot in
[8:32] well I had to develop to a place to
[8:35] where God finally said pay for him you
[8:39] go that way a lot actually a lot chose
[8:41] remember like hey bring him come down
[8:43] and says hey I got this whole plane all
[8:46] these kind of little things he said do
[8:48] you want split it down the middle and I
[8:49] don't think this side you take that side
[8:51] blocks it well I'll take that side which
[8:53] included Sodom and Gomorrah so he made
[8:55] her own choice
[8:56] hey I made the right choice King I heard
[8:59] a preacher say one time let lot go his
[9:02] way
[9:03] cuz he's fulfilling Scripture - correct
[9:05] block was fulfilling what he's given a
[9:07] lot right sure
[9:09] and brother bowed many times I'll bring
[9:10] it last night brother bad and many times
[9:12] tells us that law was a righteous man
[9:14] the Bible says that the sins of Sodom
[9:17] vexed his righteous soul so he wasn't a
[9:19] sinner but he wasn't the chosen of the
[9:23] bunch
[9:24] Abraham was the chosen of the bunch to
[9:26] take the body change and produce the
[9:29] child a lot was not included in them but
[9:32] now lot was included in Abraham journey
[9:34] okay so same way with the denominations
[9:38] in the foolish virgin he's a top of the
[9:40] foods virgin alright then you had Billy
[9:44] Graham on Oral Roberts identified in the
[9:46] word going down to Sodom and blind in
[9:48] their eyes doing their job preaching
[9:52] what salvation gospel to them but that
[9:56] was what they were that was their box
[9:58] but brother Brown had to come and preach
[10:00] what we've been talking about upstairs
[10:03] the coming of the Son of Man
[10:05] because son of man is to you and I
[10:09] listen so you and I the Son of Man
[10:11] revelation is the most important
[10:13] revelation you'll ever get ever get son
[10:17] of gods fine
[10:18] you saw what's the same it's the same
[10:20] but it's a different dispensation I've
[10:22] been reading that quote three Sundays in
[10:25] a row it's different
[10:28] brother Brian said sunny dog through the
[10:29] church agents on land in the end time
[10:31] it's a different way what is a different
[10:34] way for God to produce its people okay
[10:37] so the Sun man revelation demands demos
[10:41] his well that's what brother brown flash
[10:43] green half of your ministry was wasn't
[10:45] was a revelation to the son of man that
[10:47] God in human flesh not in just him but
[10:50] God in human flesh and the people and he
[10:53] said he'd be the Ministry of the Sun man
[10:56] right not the man right there was only
[10:59] one son of man that was the Lord King
[11:01] described but collectively we make up
[11:04] the body of Christ and the body of Jesus
[11:07] Christ was flesh and would be son of man
[11:10] so when will be the son of man because
[11:16] you know brother Brown said Jesus had
[11:17] three poles in it in his ministry first
[11:20] full faithful purple he explained that
[11:23] when somebody brother Branham will it
[11:25] wasn't different than Jesus's ministry
[11:26] it was the same three colors the same
[11:28] three phases of the message than he had
[11:33] right healing right then bigger fish and
[11:38] then the last one was Jesus was
[11:41] preaching to the totally lost the church
[11:44] which was the people that the mate well
[11:47] let's say the lost and let's say the
[11:50] camellias end up jail d'emilia and
[11:57] Nicodemus that didn't deny Jesus but
[12:01] then walked with him and then you had
[12:03] his he lack which was only twelve one of
[12:06] them was the devil so that's what he had
[12:08] in his in his message same way your
[12:11] brother around him he comes started with
[12:12] a healing campaign millions of people
[12:14] followed him then he started preaching
[12:17] to the Pentecostals the denominational
[12:19] world trying to get them to move over
[12:21] well the ones that did move over he was
[12:23] preaching to the bride to the church and
[12:26] totally lost so that's the same and
[12:29] that's what's happening now well that's
[12:31] why brother man preach three kinds of
[12:32] believers non-believers may believe it
[12:35] from true believers that's the same
[12:37] three full unbeliever
[12:39] make
[12:41] okay so let's finish here likewise the
[12:44] spirit also helpeth on health
[12:46] informatics for we know not what we
[12:49] should pray for as we all know we talked
[12:51] about this last Sunday sometimes we
[12:54] don't know what to pray for
[12:57] you've never been that way how that been
[13:00] that way many times you don't know what
[13:02] to pray for and you pray for thy will be
[13:04] done but you have to be careful there
[13:09] you can't just I've always said it's a
[13:11] those of you and there's nobody here but
[13:13] people of competences pray that God
[13:15] would give me a job and then he go home
[13:18] and sit on the couch so I'm not gonna
[13:20] come knock down the door and say I got
[13:22] to get God he wants a little effort
[13:26] Abraham give a little effort at least
[13:28] Abraham tried to figure out what God was
[13:30] doing he was he was in the motion he was
[13:33] moving all the time same way we got he's
[13:36] not gonna just dump them a job in front
[13:38] of you you got to go because that's your
[13:43] friend Malaysia what more would it be
[13:44] that God to give you a job grab the
[13:46] middle of a turmoil that you weren't
[13:47] looking for something and then all of a
[13:49] sudden there it is you may be looking
[13:53] over here I mean you're looking but then
[13:54] all of a sudden something comes this way
[13:56] well you know that's God before we know
[13:59] not what we should pray for as we off
[14:00] but the spirit itself maketh
[14:02] intercession for us with groanings which
[14:04] cannot be uttered a green scripture
[14:06] yesterday morning where Jesus is telling
[14:10] them going back I'm going back to
[14:12] Matthew Mark Luke and John the scripture
[14:14] that he tells the people that when you
[14:17] come up before judges and Kings to not
[14:20] think about what you were saying well
[14:21] that's what they said he said let the
[14:24] Holy Spirit talk that's the same way
[14:27] with you and I'll let the Holy Spirit
[14:28] talk a lot of times when we talk we get
[14:30] in trouble but is he let the Spirit talk
[14:32] won't be income and he to searches the
[14:35] heart knoweth what is the mind of the
[14:36] Spirit because he maketh intercession
[14:39] for the Saints according to the will of
[14:41] God and we know that all things
[14:44] only that less sunny all things work
[14:47] together for good to them that love God
[14:48] now you have to separate this all things
[14:53] work together for good will have to
[14:58] happen to anybody
[15:00] I'm non-christian but now watch God put
[15:04] this in to them that love God and you
[15:06] can only love God that's that love is
[15:09] not feel your love that's the doctor
[15:12] love you cannot love God with filial
[15:14] love that's back you get in trouble if
[15:16] you do that's a godly love from the
[15:19] inside that's one this thing right here
[15:22] this actually starts down here to see it
[15:25] comes to a head comes to a culmination
[15:28] well we know that all things work
[15:30] together for good to them that love God
[15:32] to them who are the called according to
[15:36] his purpose now to them that are called
[15:38] you go back to the scripture meaning of
[15:40] calling for your chosen but if you're
[15:43] called according to his purpose
[15:45] you're writing it live the whole
[15:47] scripture lines it right back up where
[15:48] you're in the will of God
[15:50] for whom he did foreknow that's what we
[15:53] were talking about last Sunday that's
[15:54] when we've had the groan that's what
[15:55] we're going for whom he did foreknow he
[15:58] also did predestinate so predestination
[16:00] is not just like we were saying
[16:03] predestination is not just that's about
[16:07] predestination according to God
[16:09] now that's predestination according to
[16:11] garden for knowledge he saw your back by
[16:18] foreknowledge he knew exactly the route
[16:20] he was going to take that way but he
[16:22] didn't put you through that - you know
[16:27] I'm gonna make a real bad example but
[16:30] here is the mind of God alright
[16:38] the mind of God this is foreknowledge
[16:42] because he for knew those who he did
[16:47] foreknow all-knowing God be before the
[16:52] foundation the world what was gonna
[16:53] happen but you know what he did he did
[16:56] not make you do this no he saw you do
[17:01] this because you're a friend little
[17:04] agent even brother Brown says you're
[17:05] afraid after you're born again you're
[17:07] free one thing to me to me let me put it
[17:12] this way to me your free moral agency
[17:13] counts more when you're born again than
[17:15] it is when you're not but if you're not
[17:18] born again you're not will is out anyway
[17:20] you're just brutally slain for
[17:22] destruction you're just people walking
[17:23] down the street spilling out space sorry
[17:27] walking dead you know they have a movie
[17:30] The Walking Dead will get what you got
[17:32] plenty oh brother I'm callin cannon
[17:38] fodder now that's pretty rough that's
[17:40] what he said but he also cornea them he
[17:45] didn't pull him through their tube in
[17:48] the center he didn't pull through that
[17:51] cube he saw what they would do and it
[17:55] really helps me because you said well
[17:57] why are these people like and I'll be
[18:00] learning all the bad just real bad
[18:02] people why are the bad people and
[18:04] sometimes you even read in the Bible
[18:06] where it says Lord why in other words
[18:08] one of these people prosper and David
[18:10] said that many times why are my enemies
[18:12] prospering well God's like David
[18:16] don't worry about them leave them there
[18:19] they're there over here but if you're in
[18:23] the mind of God eternal section in the
[18:25] mind of God because there is two
[18:27] sections in the mind of God because
[18:30] Judas he saw all God's thoughts are
[18:32] eternal his thoughts of Judas can't be
[18:37] eternal
[18:38] his thoughts of your sins before you put
[18:41] them under the blood can't be eternal so
[18:44] you got a problem here when you think
[18:46] that well
[18:47] God knows everything God knows
[18:49] everything but one thing he does not
[18:50] know praise God he doesn't know my past
[18:52] sins because they're not in his mind
[18:55] anything they actually never were in the
[18:57] mind at all
[18:59] hello they weren't now he saw what you
[19:05] did yes
[19:06] okay but that part right here in the
[19:10] eternal section because really this is
[19:12] the book we've been looking at this is
[19:14] the book of life and then there's an
[19:18] eternal section because the book of life
[19:26] never biting than that yes a book of
[19:29] life because when you go to revelations
[19:33] revelation says the book we wrote was
[19:34] open we're not in that book oh we're not
[19:40] in the book
[19:41] we are the book now see yeah I'll go
[19:47] with eternal security with the Baptist
[19:50] if they'll believe it like that by
[19:52] foreknowledge
[19:53] we always was eternal I'm going the
[19:56] people in the message about
[19:57] foreknowledge we always look eternal but
[19:59] not that we started with eternal life
[20:02] right no we were here in eternal life
[20:08] for though he don't form from whom he
[20:12] did foreknow he also did predestinate
[20:14] pre destined predetermined destiny now
[20:19] if you take that then this is
[20:20] predetermined destiny without
[20:24] foreknowledge you can't have that
[20:26] there's no free will in there there's no
[20:29] free moral agency my brother Branson God
[20:31] didn't put you that's one man cube God
[20:33] didn't clue you through you
[20:34] they saw the cubed over by your choice
[20:39] you have plenty of choices plenty of
[20:42] choices
[20:44] sorry
[20:50] you know really he knew that it can you
[20:54] that we don't see that we're never going
[21:00] to take a body thing because you know
[21:01] what that's what you're seeing that's
[21:07] what you're seeing now let's go back to
[21:10] foreknowledge eternal section or not the
[21:15] eternal section you come from the mind
[21:18] of God God met you in a new birth you
[21:20] walked your path and then you're gonna
[21:21] take a body change or die go by the
[21:23] grave and you still think I'm right this
[21:27] is our problem
[21:33] now that may be our leader need to get
[21:35] the gun right but this is all these
[21:39] needs listen even a property God told us
[21:43] he said God don't even see a Christian
[21:45] since they're coming he only hears your
[21:47] voice this whole world is covered by the
[21:49] blood of Jesus Christ he hears our voice
[21:55] but now that eternal section that's that
[22:01] Genesis 1:26 man that's that man never
[22:04] sinned if you're born again today you
[22:05] never gender dating on that person did a
[22:09] man that's what were you saying I'm
[22:12] going while I knew that you're making a
[22:13] laundry list God didn't see that if you
[22:20] put it under the blood it can never be
[22:24] remembered again that's according to the
[22:27] Bible so those he foreknew he did
[22:31] predestinate to be conformed to the
[22:33] image of his son that he might be the
[22:35] firstborn of many brethren Paul's not
[22:40] finished with his thought moreover of
[22:43] whom he did predestinate by
[22:44] foreknowledge then he also called and
[22:49] whom he called he also justified and
[22:53] whom he justified them he also glorified
[22:56] there's only one way God could do that
[22:58] and says no your journey from beginning
[23:00] to the end right why shall we then say
[23:04] to these things free to read them
[23:11] that takes all the curves out and then
[23:16] it takes all the curves out because if
[23:19] he predestinated you by foreknowledge
[23:21] knew you would accept the word knew you
[23:24] would become the word made flesh then
[23:26] those whose justified Authority
[23:28] glorified in God's eyes were already
[23:30] glorified we're already sitting in
[23:33] heavenly places the Bible sarcomas then
[23:35] that's our biggest problem then we go
[23:38] well I do this I do this I do this I do
[23:41] it
[23:42] that's what's keeping us here
[23:49] he despairs on his own son but delivered
[23:52] him up for us all this is how we got it
[23:55] how shall he not with him also freely
[23:59] give us all things
[24:01] who shall they look who shall lay
[24:04] anything now they don't say anything you
[24:08] notice that's two words any thing so you
[24:13] can make that thing sin who shall lay
[24:17] any sin to the charge of God's elect you
[24:21] can't it's God to justify who is he that
[24:26] condemneth exactly the question it is
[24:30] Christ that died yea rather that is
[24:32] risen again who is even at the right
[24:34] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[24:37] for us Freda that's your your on curve
[24:40] when you get outside of that cube he
[24:43] makes intercession well if you're a
[24:45] child to god guess what you come right
[24:46] back you know you just keep go wrong
[24:48] right who shall separate us from the
[24:53] love of Christ shall tribulation or
[24:55] distress or persecution their family all
[24:58] want to know about this he been through
[25:00] him a bit famine or nakedness or peril
[25:04] or sword as it is written for thy sake
[25:08] we are killed all the day long we are
[25:10] accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[25:13] NAND all these things we are more than
[25:15] conquerors through him that loved us for
[25:18] I am persuaded let's see what that
[25:21] worked me good my nifty little
[25:24] concordance here
[25:30] convinced by analogy
[25:38] but with one down here less thing to
[25:41] realize by n-word certainty outside mass
[25:46] not one good but inside man can to
[25:50] persuade to induce one by words to
[25:53] believe bosses for I'm persuaded in
[25:56] other words all this that God has given
[25:57] me that I'm writing to you I am so
[25:59] persuaded I am convinced I am convinced
[26:07] I am convinced that neither death nor
[26:11] life nor Angels nor principalities nor
[26:15] powers nor things present nor things to
[26:20] come nor height nor depth he's not
[26:24] covered at all nor any other creature
[26:26] shall be able to separate us from the
[26:30] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[26:32] Lord
[26:33] that's our lover right there Christ you
[26:36] miss our Lord no one can separate I love
[26:40] what Paul said the Paul is really verse
[26:44] 1 through 37 he's give us the journey
[26:47] but in verse 38 and 39
[26:50] he's just sewing it all up Brian
[26:53] persuaded that neither death nor life
[26:54] nor Angels nor principalities nor powers
[26:57] nor things present nor things to come
[26:59] nor height nor depth nor any other
[27:01] creature shall be able to separate us
[27:04] from the love of God which is in Christ
[27:05] Jesus our Lord
[27:07] nothing can separate so therefore if God
[27:11] be for us who can be against us and
[27:13] that's what we
[27:17] all right let's read this just for a
[27:19] minute and we'll to me Romans 8 is just
[27:24] a chapter that covers all of your
[27:28] cushion along rings in your adoption
[27:31] brings in plate while the placing and
[27:34] adoption that brings in your
[27:35] Christianity it brings in your walk and
[27:37] even tell you what God thought about you
[27:39] and thinks about you right and we got to
[27:43] believe that and we are believe in time
[27:47] we're living in that's one that that
[27:50] brother Branson will know who we are and
[27:53] what we're doing here one know our
[27:54] position our position is not to throw
[27:59] this to somebody else our position is to
[28:02] take this make it manifest and take a
[28:04] body change and you know I just got an
[28:06] automatic to take a body cam like I said
[28:10] before my god just coming to Abraham
[28:13] there in her of Jodie's and rock 22
[28:16] Abraham get up walk and take a journey
[28:19] why do you just change him then we
[28:22] didn't need to any change at that time
[28:24] I've done benefit that the bride was one
[28:28] it needed to change not him I say the
[28:32] truth in Christ I lie not my conscience
[28:35] also bearing me witness in the Holy
[28:37] Ghost then I have great heaviness and
[28:39] continual sorrow in my heart for I could
[28:42] wish that myself were accursed from
[28:44] Christ for my brethren my kinsmen
[28:46] according to the flesh who are
[28:48] Israelites to them pertain of the
[28:50] adoption of an eloquent comment on this
[28:52] will this is Scripture
[28:54] Romans 9 for is relaxed to whom
[28:57] pertaineth the adoption that the glory
[28:59] and the covenants and the giving of the
[29:00] law and the service of God the promises
[29:03] it went to them first
[29:07] Jesus even and he said yeah yeah I have
[29:11] a problem with this scripture Jeep
[29:15] Duvall says he came to his own and his
[29:16] own received him not
[29:18] they were never his own now because we
[29:24] were his own
[29:25] we were the kingdom of God they realize
[29:27] whenever the kingdom of God he divorced
[29:29] them in the Old Testament but I'm not
[29:33] saying scriptures bad I know what it
[29:34] means but in when you first see that you
[29:37] go what do you mean we men go and you
[29:40] remember Jesus told them he said don't
[29:42] go he said only go to the lost sheep of
[29:45] the house of Israel Jesus was telling
[29:47] them no you know the Gentile Wow because
[29:50] that dispensation had not come yet he
[29:52] knew that Paul and Peter would be taking
[29:54] it to the Gentile because I'm telling
[29:56] you every time he met a Gentile they got
[29:59] what they wanted thank this air
[30:06] Phoenician woman the Centurion one or
[30:12] two other instances I've read it the
[30:13] other day where Jesus said I have found
[30:16] no greater faith in them well he wasn't
[30:18] probably to Israel he was talking to the
[30:20] woman that he called her dog and the
[30:23] Centurion that said I don't want you to
[30:25] come to my house on my word just say the
[30:27] word and he said I found no greater
[30:29] faith but what was that he was the Roman
[30:31] he was a Gentile so and I know what it
[30:36] was when Jesus came to his people or was
[30:40] born among those people he considered
[30:42] them his people earthly where his
[30:46] children Israel's not his children where
[30:52] his children
[30:55] if the intros his children they go to
[30:58] the future home with us Israel is not
[31:00] his children he said what about 144,000
[31:03] they get the Holy Ghost here that
[31:05] remember remember nobody no one from
[31:09] Jesus back which was the Old Testament
[31:11] which was the Jews with truth Israel
[31:13] received the Holy Ghost in their soul
[31:15] until Jesus died resurrected came back
[31:17] on a dampened cough then there was 120
[31:20] and then remember the 3,000 downstairs
[31:21] was all over the nation they weren't all
[31:23] Israelite because the day of Pentecost
[31:25] on the day of Pentecost that wasn't just
[31:28] Israel if you'll study your history even
[31:34] now the day of Pentecost all a lot of
[31:36] the people from many nations gather in
[31:38] Israel for the day of Pentecost it's
[31:41] like a festival to them now I'm sorry
[31:46] that's correct because they came from
[31:48] different places they heard him in their
[31:51] own language remember they said that how
[31:52] these we hear in their own language so
[31:54] there was a lot of different languages
[31:56] out there a lot of different nations but
[31:58] don't get me wrong about one kid but you
[32:00] don't think what Jesus said he said
[32:01] don't go don't go to Gentile go to my
[32:03] people go to the lost sheep of the house
[32:05] of Israel why he was well he was trying
[32:08] you know what he was doing he was trying
[32:10] his best to get them to see it even
[32:12] though he knew they weren't you know why
[32:15] gotta be witness I came to you and you
[32:18] turned me down okay so that's why it's
[32:21] written that way but Jesus Christ came
[32:24] to earth to get a bride that was inside
[32:28] of him that couldn't get out that was
[32:30] that was longing to get out and we're
[32:34] talking about that maybe a little bit
[32:35] this afternoon that's why the son of man
[32:37] had come son of man was flesh God they
[32:41] had us in him the Son of God we were in
[32:45] the mind of God that Genesis 1:26 men
[32:47] talk about the Stephanie good everybody
[32:52] runs around the country and especially
[32:53] in the message saying son of man son of
[32:54] man son of man son of man whoa weren't
[32:57] they saying you better know what they're
[32:59] saying the last son of man what's going
[33:02] to change your body people have had the
[33:04] son of God
[33:05] and sense did they back off Caladan have
[33:09] son matt revelation he left sent back
[33:13] the whole ego sent back the Holy Ghost
[33:16] to go in their soul to teach them how to
[33:18] be Christian but my son man have to come
[33:22] back in the end time you seen your Bible
[33:24] I read it this morning and when I tell
[33:26] you this afternoon you able to shock you
[33:31] it's been there the whole time why the
[33:33] son of man had to come back and it's in
[33:35] a scripture that we read all the time
[33:39] and it pertains to this age it's in the
[33:42] book of Revelation and then I found one
[33:45] clover brother better tell exactly
[33:47] explains what I thought it was but he
[33:49] explains it so I'm gonna let the Prophet
[33:51] really think that's the last thing we'll
[33:52] read this afternoon so most heavy trucks
[33:55] they away who are is a lot to new
[33:57] pretend the adoption and the glory and
[33:59] the covenants and the giving of the law
[34:00] the service and God promises because
[34:03] listen put folks God never wanted to
[34:05] live in a tyrant ankle with badger skin
[34:09] and he he never wanted to sacrifice an
[34:14] animal
[34:15] none of that he wanted to do but it was
[34:18] allowed because of the sin that Adam and
[34:21] Eve caused in the garden so that he
[34:25] could be a savior he could be Jehovah he
[34:27] could be the father all these different
[34:28] attributes this is the way I had to go
[34:32] there's no other way I could win this is
[34:33] the only way to the win there is
[34:36] realized in things adoption to go in the
[34:38] company and the giving of the law
[34:41] service of God promises because remember
[34:45] what Jesus told him he stood there one
[34:47] day and he said you see y'all keep all
[34:49] these days and times and you keep all
[34:51] these washing into the pots and you you
[34:53] you've garnished you go out there and
[34:55] you you wipe the tomb of the prophets in
[34:57] other words you go out Washington take
[34:58] it's pretty Washington watch them you
[35:00] know and he said you put them in there
[35:02] that's how hypocritical they were and
[35:05] that's why they hated him because he
[35:06] said you put the people that's in that
[35:08] tomb you
[35:09] put them in there anyways it y'all put
[35:12] y'all killed the prophets whose are the
[35:16] fathers of them as concerning the flesh
[35:18] Christ came to see look flat in the
[35:21] flesh who is over all and God bless
[35:24] forever amen not as though the Word of
[35:28] God hath taken none effect for they are
[35:32] not all Israel which are of Israel right
[35:38] why what neither because they are the
[35:45] seed of Abraham are they all children
[35:49] Abraham had many other children beside
[35:51] one but he had one chosen son Ishmael
[35:54] they guard told Ishmael said you'll be
[35:58] like the sands of the sea just like your
[35:59] father you'll be a wild child well
[36:01] that's all them people is over there now
[36:03] there's a lot of people come from
[36:05] Ishmael then they came right straight
[36:07] from a pronounced natural loins but not
[36:10] considered them from Isaac and Isaac but
[36:17] in Isaac shall thy seed be called and
[36:20] that's not natural that's going to
[36:22] spiritually was natural and Isaac hey he
[36:25] has some problem children down in his
[36:26] lineage okay so you know naturally but
[36:30] remember what are we going back to that
[36:33] is they which are the children of the
[36:35] flesh these are not the children of God
[36:39] but the children of the promise are
[36:42] counted for the seed not natural seed
[36:47] because remember it says not unto
[36:49] Abraham with seeds that are many but one
[36:52] seed which is Christ these are all
[36:54] allegories these are all examples in the
[36:57] Old Testament Abraham did not birth
[36:59] Christ but he birthed the promised child
[37:02] in the Old Testament which was a topic
[37:04] right okay that is they went through the
[37:07] children CL I'm telling you all these
[37:09] are taught but everything is talking you
[37:12] and me that is they were through the
[37:15] children of the flesh these are not the
[37:17] children of God
[37:18] but the children of the promise are
[37:20] counted for the seed for this is the
[37:23] word of promise at this time will I come
[37:26] in Sarah shall have a son remember what
[37:28] I said before
[37:28] when Abraham started his journey he was
[37:31] married to Sarah but God said you're
[37:32] gonna have a promised child he never
[37:35] said by who
[37:37] but when Melchizedek met him and changed
[37:40] his name
[37:41] no cassia Nick told him said by Sarah
[37:45] you'll have that child will Abraham me
[37:47] write them well then we got a problem
[37:52] a real problem now because I could be
[37:58] with Hagar and have children I compete
[38:00] with this other woman and now children
[38:01] but I've been with her since we kids and
[38:04] we don't you you gonna tell me what I'm
[38:06] saying even when things were right and
[38:08] going through today right I like that
[38:11] too and I want to bring this in because
[38:13] what did Sarah say she said me have a
[38:17] pleasure look my word again she
[38:19] remembered all the the she remember that
[38:22] in her humanity she's like god you're
[38:27] telling me we're gonna well he didn't
[38:29] give her the whole leaders say what I'm
[38:31] gonna change you and you don't know and
[38:35] that's the same way I think it will be
[38:36] with a change I don't think it's gonna
[38:38] be God's gonna say this day is when the
[38:40] change is gonna come
[38:41] you know the excellent know caliber I
[38:44] think right now it's already happening
[38:46] it's a gradual change it's a gradual
[38:50] change for us it was one time for them
[38:53] but I think it's a gradual change no
[38:54] we're not gonna start looking younger
[38:55] but we gotta let this thing come into
[38:58] that outside mother of a middle man
[38:59] remember reason consolation imagination
[39:02] the spirit realm it's what we need to
[39:04] work on now and that's what this is
[39:05] working on a man because if you're born
[39:10] again in your soul you don't have a
[39:11] temper in your soul but you do have
[39:18] temperance in that spirit realm then you
[39:21] live in that when your mom and daddy
[39:23] hurt you you got a nature
[39:25] and it's all contrary to God's so that
[39:27] temperance is contrary to go ahead until
[39:29] God changes it takes that out and then
[39:33] the same thing with each one of these I
[39:34] hope you see that that's one of those
[39:36] types of perfect man to me it's one of
[39:37] the most important things that we need
[39:40] to understand because without it you
[39:43] can't change your body without it you
[39:45] die then I mean just physically died not
[39:48] spiritually though physically there let
[39:53] me read this verse 9 then will for this
[39:57] is the word of promise at this time will
[39:58] I come and Sarah shall have a son and
[40:01] not only this but when Rebecca also had
[40:03] conceived by one even the fire father
[40:05] Isaac for the children being yet born
[40:07] have done no good or evil that the
[40:08] purpose of God according to election
[40:10] might stand it is said to her the elder
[40:13] shall serve the younger as it is written
[40:15] Jacob my love
[40:16] and Esau have I hated now God didn't
[40:20] choose that he knew what he saw was
[40:22] gonna do before he saw was born go back
[40:25] to what he saw Mike before knowledge by
[40:27] foreknowledge he knew and it always
[40:30] bothered me about things like that but
[40:32] you know what God knows that if he gave
[40:34] Esau a million years to live he'd never
[40:36] repent and come back same way with a dog
[40:41] the other same way with everybody in the
[40:42] world he knew that he'd given time and
[40:44] they do not repent
