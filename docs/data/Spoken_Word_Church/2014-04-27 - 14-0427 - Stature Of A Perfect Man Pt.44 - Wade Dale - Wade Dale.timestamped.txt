[0:29] turn to second Peter
[0:31] 1 let's get started on
[0:37] godliness we were
[0:40] patiently finished with
[0:42] patience so now we're going to get into
[0:49] go it's going down the
[0:56] table I
[0:58] it
[1:01] now where are we patience godliness
[1:05] patience have
[1:07] patience be patient have patience why
[1:12] triv when it run
[1:15] down there you go thank
[1:28] you second Peter
[1:31] one verse
[1:34] one I should have made these can you see
[1:38] that Rebecca can you see that me what
[1:44] okay D
[1:47] Joe right okay I'm going to make it a
[1:50] little bit bigger next time but when I
[1:52] get you have I'm doing this on the
[1:54] computer at home and I'll go up to about
[1:56] 14 or 16 on the fonts and I don't know
[1:58] how big that looks but it must need to
[2:00] go to 20 because that's I mean I can do
[2:04] this but that's not going to that's not
[2:08] going to help a
[2:10] lot so
[2:13] anyway okay Simon Peter a servant and
[2:16] Apostle of Jesus Christ to him that have
[2:18] obtained like Precious Faith with us
[2:20] through the righteousness of God and our
[2:22] Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[2:25] multiplied unto thee through the
[2:27] knowledge of God and Jesus our lord
[2:28] that's what we're doing now we we're
[2:30] getting into the knowledge of God cuz it
[2:32] all is Godly knowledge there's knowledge
[2:34] on the pyramid and we went through that
[2:37] but all this is knowledge cuz knowledge
[2:39] is knowing right knowledge is having is
[2:43] knowing what you're doing all right so
[2:46] that's what God wants us to do he give
[2:47] us the new
[2:49] birth as a
[2:51] guide but even being our gu if you have
[2:54] a guide you need to be guided to
[2:57] somewhere uh Danny and I don't need a
[3:00] guide where we went fishing yesterday
[3:02] we've been going up there for 30 years
[3:04] we know every inch of the place so we
[3:07] don't need a guide there why cuz we
[3:09] already know what we're doing but now if
[3:11] he and I were to go to Colorado fishing
[3:12] on the White River or go to Montana on
[3:14] the White River fishing we going to need
[3:16] a guide CU you never been there before
[3:19] so being the God's give us the a guide
[3:22] the Holy Ghost and being that he was a
[3:25] guide then he's the one that's going to
[3:26] have to guide us into all truth that's
[3:28] what the Bible says he lead and guide
[3:30] you into all truth and all truth is is
[3:33] that we're not just to get the new birth
[3:36] and then sit down and and be
[3:39] still no we got to fight for every inch
[3:42] of ground same with Joshua Joshua had to
[3:45] fight sure the land was his but he had
[3:47] to fight for every inch of it so that's
[3:49] what we're doing now we're fighting a
[3:51] battle and we'll see here that in
[3:56] godliness watch as we go on through this
[3:58] cuz I want you to see grace and peace be
[4:00] multiplied on you through the knowledge
[4:01] of God as we grow up this statue of a
[4:04] perfect man we should be more
[4:08] aware of what's going on around us we
[4:11] should be growing we should be how many
[4:13] of you are praying for godliness how
[4:14] many of as we go through I know Sister
[4:16] Johnny is cuz she sends me emails and
[4:18] how that God's helping her and and
[4:20] that's wonderful you can send me emails
[4:21] if you want
[4:22] to it it's nice to to sometimes to voice
[4:26] you know what's going on in your life
[4:28] but have you prayed godliness or we just
[4:30] going through this and you're saying
[4:31] well then you just teach me see that's
[4:33] no more than Catholic Church that's
[4:35] right that's no more than a Catholic
[4:38] Church I'm standing up here and you say
[4:40] oh brother way that's wonderful I just
[4:41] about saying well Pope thank you very
[4:43] much for that's right you understand
[4:45] what I'm saying you got to obtain
[4:50] listen verse one to them that have
[4:53] obtained to them that have obtained
[4:55] Peter didn't say I've obtained it and
[4:57] you can't get it see that's what the
[4:59] Catholic Church does they say we've got
[5:01] it the Pope's got it and nobody else can
[5:04] get it but we're going to tell you what
[5:05] it is and you just accept what we say
[5:08] right okay well see that's where like I
[5:10] was saying the other Wednesday night
[5:12] about Dogma that's a personal view
[5:15] personal view that's just like this now
[5:18] that's totally different than Revelation
[5:20] now Revelation is this Jesus didn't have
[5:23] a Dogma Jesus had a Doctrine that's
[5:26] right there's a difference in dogma and
[5:28] Doctrine right if you bring
[5:31] Dogma then you bring your own idea
[5:34] that's right that's
[5:36] right that's right it's pretty simple
[5:39] you know if you're dogmatic about
[5:40] something that's okay to be you say that
[5:42] word but still you got to be careful cuz
[5:45] the Catholic Church says this is the way
[5:46] it is and that's what brother Bram said
[5:47] Creeds and dogmas has bound the Holy
[5:49] Ghost why CU this is it Pentecost bound
[5:52] the Holy Ghost by their Dogma that says
[5:53] You must be you must speak in tongues to
[5:56] receive the Holy Ghost that's a Dogma
[5:58] now that's not a Doctrine right sure
[6:00] they say it's a Doctrine they uphold it
[6:03] as a Doctrine but it's man's ideas
[6:05] that's right and if we're just preaching
[6:07] man's ideas then we're just preaching
[6:08] Dogma we're just preaching dogmatic
[6:11] ideas that's my ideas and nobody else's
[6:14] right but if you take the word of God
[6:16] though it's a Doctrine Jesus had a
[6:18] Doctrine and his Doctrine was the truth
[6:21] every word of it that's right so if we
[6:23] come back to that I I I don't I don't
[6:27] understand when when uh some people say
[6:30] that that even I you know well Dad for
[6:33] one is is is uh arrogant and no there's
[6:38] a confidence and arrogance is really
[6:41] close but when you preach the word of
[6:43] God in its Purity that's not arrogant
[6:45] that's right Paul stood up one day and
[6:47] he preached to a great big group of
[6:49] people and he said you'll be judged by
[6:51] my gospel right and if an angel come
[6:54] from Heaven that's where he got his
[6:56] Revelation from he said if an angel
[6:58] comes from heaven in other words if an
[6:59] angel walked through that door and Stood
[7:01] Beside Me and preached anything else
[7:02] besides what I preach to you let him be
[7:06] a cursed that's right in other words he
[7:08] didn't come from that's right Heaven
[7:11] that's right you understand what I'm
[7:12] saying yes so why can't we be confident
[7:14] but not arant but confident in what
[7:16] God's given us and confident that if one
[7:19] word got us out of the garden being one
[7:21] word off going to keep us out of the
[7:23] garden that's
[7:25] true that's right but if we can find
[7:27] that one word and I a mean one word you
[7:30] what I mean the word that'll get us back
[7:33] in the garden why not be confident about
[7:36] it why not be like Paul Paul said I run
[7:38] this race well he was pretty you know he
[7:42] was a staunched Jew he was confident
[7:43] though you know why cuz he met
[7:45] God Moses was pretty confident Moses was
[7:48] a Meek and Mild man but he was very
[7:50] confident cuz God told him you're the
[7:52] one that's going to lead children of
[7:53] Israel out of out of Egypt that's right
[7:56] okay and even in his inadequacy even he
[7:59] need needed Aaron and he needed 70
[8:01] people so
[8:02] what he got him to the promised land
[8:04] didn't he Joshua took him over but he
[8:06] got him to the promis land all right so
[8:08] that's what we're going to look at in
[8:09] godliness I hope that that we're
[8:11] building The Virtue knowledge Temperance
[8:14] patience and I hope that's something
[8:16] that you're praying for not just
[8:17] something that I'm going to teach you
[8:18] and you're going to hear it and it's
[8:20] going to click on and now I have
[8:21] knowledge of it and now I know no it's
[8:24] it's a daily walk it's your walk not
[8:26] mine nothing more than a daily walk with
[8:29] God in your job and if you're not
[8:31] working if you're retired then you
[8:34] should be more blessed that's right you
[8:36] got more time to study that's true okay
[8:40] so take that as take this as the virtues
[8:44] that we that are required remember
[8:45] they're not just needed they're required
[8:48] for us to take a body change right
[8:50] there's no way we're going to take a
[8:51] body change without these virtues
[8:53] working in our life is that right say
[8:55] amen that's right will not take a body
[8:58] change now you doesn't mean you're not
[8:59] born again doesn't mean you're not going
[9:00] to you're going to have to die that's
[9:03] right period there ain't no F there the
[9:06] butts about it Peter James and John had
[9:09] all the virtues they're dead Paul had
[9:11] the virtues he's
[9:13] dead something's got to take us on up to
[9:16] the Capstone that's right and not only
[9:20] change Sarah's
[9:22] body but Sarah's body had to be changed
[9:24] inside that's right right cuz she
[9:27] couldn't receive a child in the in when
[9:29] she was a young girl in the first place
[9:31] so not only did God change her
[9:34] back he changed her atoms inside her
[9:36] body so she could receive a child that's
[9:39] right so God's not only going to change
[9:41] these bodies he's going to like I was
[9:42] saying the other Wednesday night he's
[9:43] going to change this thing this thing is
[9:46] vile this thing is is not there flesh
[9:49] and blood is not going to inherit the
[9:51] Kingdom but but the flesh and blood that
[9:53] he gives us that's right that's right
[9:55] what he did last Sunday dying for our
[9:58] sins and and raising up in in that
[10:01] raising up he glor he took us and we're
[10:03] already in a glorified condition right
[10:06] in his mind we're already in a glorified
[10:08] condition that's right right that's
[10:10] right okay and I really caught something
[10:13] the other day and here we are back to
[10:14] what off the subject again but okay but
[10:18] I was thinking about something the other
[10:19] day um Daddy's always said I got to quit
[10:24] saying Daddy they they tell me on the
[10:25] internet not to say Daddy because they
[10:27] don't some don't know what I'm talking
[10:28] about brother Dale
[10:30] says that watch that you don't redeem
[10:32] yourself out of existence okay see I
[10:35] caught that when I was preaching on that
[10:36] little Wednesday night if you say this
[10:39] body is going to be redeemed as it is
[10:44] you hear me as it is M what is redeemed
[10:47] is to take back to its original
[10:49] condition well the original condition of
[10:51] this is back down in the
[10:54] earth that's good ain't that right
[10:56] that's right the original condition of
[10:58] this thing right here was my mom and
[11:00] daddy ate beans and potatoes and it's in
[11:03] the earth so if I want this redeemed
[11:04] back right I'm going to redeem myself
[11:07] out of
[11:08] existence I'm going to be potach and
[11:11] calcium and all that stuff we got to get
[11:13] to see that God in his
[11:16] mind before the foundation of the world
[11:19] he saw what you were going to look
[11:21] like and he connected to you down here
[11:25] that's right and this is going to go but
[11:27] it's not going to go in this
[11:29] right exactly this is Fallen condition
[11:32] right but redeem means to bring back
[11:34] right right so what's he going to bring
[11:36] it back to what he saw right what he saw
[11:41] cuz it's always remember and that
[11:42] brought back Ephesians 1 again that we
[11:44] were chosen in him not of him in him
[11:49] right so if his body's redeemed M mine's
[11:53] were that's
[11:55] right he didn't see Sharon Rose at8
[11:58] months he saw no he didn't he saw her as
[11:59] a 20-year- old woman so where did that
[12:01] body come from that's right that's what
[12:03] we saw and you know when you and I were
[12:05] discussing that listen one more thing
[12:07] cuz there was a lot of people thought I
[12:09] was saying something I wasn't it is this
[12:11] body redeemed MH right but it's not this
[12:14] body redeem you understand what I'm
[12:16] saying it's the framework it's who I am
[12:18] it's the human being that I am all right
[12:21] but with Sharon Rose now she died in 6
[12:24] months old
[12:26] right or 8 months whatever it was she
[12:28] was a baby yeah now listen let's just be
[12:31] plain and honest Sharon Rose the baby
[12:34] that died when hope died brother Brown's
[12:37] first child when he went wherever he
[12:40] went in that Vision he saw a 20-year-old
[12:43] girl standing there she says Dad he said
[12:47] I didn't know who she was now listen
[12:49] let's just be real honest you say well
[12:50] it was that 6mon old body made into 20-y
[12:54] old now those things that was in a
[12:56] six-year-old body six-month old body
[12:58] that's not in 20 old body everybody
[13:00] understand what I'm saying yes humanly
[13:02] speaking yes that had to come from the
[13:04] mind of God that's right but see in the
[13:07] mind of God is calcium potach hey he's
[13:09] that where do you think he created it
[13:10] from that's right he created it from his
[13:13] mind his mind the expansion of God is
[13:16] what we're standing on right and then
[13:18] brother BR said he brought us down here
[13:20] to what
[13:22] display his
[13:25] attributes amen that's right to display
[13:28] his RB because we're going back not into
[13:31] the mind of God because we've already
[13:33] come forth and once he speaks
[13:36] it we're not going back cuz like Brother
[13:38] D said we're going to speak oursel out
[13:40] of existence if we keep going back too
[13:43] as as a lot of message people say you
[13:47] know we're we're going to we can't go
[13:49] back to because back to in the Garden of
[13:52] Eden this was in the dirt right we got
[13:55] to go back to that mind of God where he
[13:56] saw this here and he's going to put it
[13:59] together change everything that's why
[14:00] it's called change that's right he going
[14:03] to change everything and then we're
[14:05] going to walk on the earth like we
[14:06] should have had there not been a fall
[14:09] right now we spoke that a thousand times
[14:11] but I hope it comes more alive to you
[14:13] now that that we are
[14:15] not we are not going to redeem oursel
[14:21] out of existence the true ones that's
[14:23] right the True Believers know where you
[14:25] come from and you can say I came from
[14:27] God and I go back to God well where was
[14:30] I then I was in the mind of God but once
[14:33] he spoke it once it come from a thought
[14:36] and then it was expressed it can't go
[14:39] back the other way because it's already
[14:41] expressed that's right so this is the
[14:44] mind of God expressed right in its
[14:47] natural reality right because God's
[14:50] thoughts are
[14:52] Eternal so if anything comes from God it
[14:54] had to be Eternal if we come from God
[14:56] and go back to God it's got to be
[14:58] eternal
[15:00] right God saw a positive photogra of us
[15:04] correct and we came in a negative in the
[15:06] negative form I read that quote that
[15:07] Wednesday night we're being developed to
[15:10] that positive if you'll read it says
[15:12] this the person inside of you there's a
[15:14] person being developed what it's for our
[15:18] it's not for God that's right it's for
[15:20] our Understanding God's already
[15:22] developed it before the foundation of
[15:23] world you and I just got to like I said
[15:26] the matching pieces they got to come
[15:27] together but see in our in our baby form
[15:31] of our new birth we're not at that
[15:34] condition yet everybody understand that
[15:36] cuz we still have the carnal mind we
[15:38] still have the things of the world and
[15:39] we still going to have the things of the
[15:40] world but we're going to have to learn
[15:41] how to handle the things of the world
[15:43] that's right by faith virtue knowledge
[15:46] Temperance you know what it's going to
[15:47] take a special Faith to get us out of
[15:48] here but it's not going to be a faith to
[15:50] where it's 10 steps where we've been
[15:53] taking one step it's just the same
[15:56] Journey one step at a time because you
[15:58] and I are finite right we forget stuff
[16:03] we remember stuff and then we forget
[16:05] more than we remember yes never do we
[16:08] remember more than we forget so we sure
[16:09] are not in a infinite condition cuz we
[16:13] forget well praise God I
[16:16] do I forget a lot more than I remember
[16:19] so we're going toward the positive
[16:21] though but you know what if this is
[16:23] laying in our in US it can be quickened
[16:26] that's right it's not laying in US it
[16:28] can't be quickened that's true like
[16:30] Aaron said Wednesday night in nonseed
[16:32] there's nothing to Quicken right okay so
[16:35] if you're nonseed you can't be quickened
[16:37] to this but if you are seed you can be
[16:39] quickened to this that's right and to
[16:42] take a body change we must have this
[16:44] because this is the power that works its
[16:47] way out that's right cuz God works from
[16:49] an inward to an outward Satan's trying
[16:52] to work outward and get our inward being
[16:55] cuz you can't get in the soul if you're
[16:56] born again that's right but he's trying
[16:58] to kill your body he's trying to get
[17:00] enough
[17:02] people killed you know to take the to
[17:05] take try to take godliness off the Earth
[17:08] but here God he
[17:09] puts all these wonderful people down
[17:11] here and Satan's edting and he says hey
[17:14] go at it yep because watch we're going
[17:17] to see it if we get to it brother random
[17:20] gives you a key right here let's finish
[17:22] reading this according as his divine
[17:23] power given us all things that
[17:24] pertaining to life and godliness through
[17:26] the knowledge of him that's called us to
[17:27] glory and virtue so he's already talking
[17:28] about godliness and a't got to it yet
[17:31] whereby are given to us exceeding great
[17:32] and precious promises that by these you
[17:35] might be partakers of the divine nature
[17:37] having escaped the corruption that is in
[17:38] the world through lust besides this
[17:40] giving all diligence add to your faith
[17:42] virtue virtue knowledge knowledge
[17:44] Temperance Temperance patience patience
[17:46] godliness godliness brotherly kindness
[17:48] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[17:51] things be in you and abound they're
[17:53] already in you can you bir yes
[17:57] right you got all you need then you burn
[18:00] yes but abound right that means be
[18:04] overflowing that means be full that
[18:06] means you get a that's where the word
[18:08] Bountiful comes from you get a bountiful
[18:10] crop all right a bound if these things
[18:12] be in you in a bound they make you see
[18:15] that word I like that word make yeah CU
[18:19] it's like Monica with that spanking
[18:20] spoon she makes them kids be quiet why
[18:24] because she they know that that spoon's
[18:26] coming at of them not not going to feed
[18:28] in the mouth is going to hit the other
[18:30] end got it yes so so they make you these
[18:34] things in other words this is what I'm i
[18:36] i i i Circle that word in my Bible cu
[18:39] the way I see it is is when when you get
[18:41] these virtues it'll make you that's
[18:44] right it'll make you be this kind of
[18:46] person that's right cuz you lose your
[18:48] will after that yes sir not my will but
[18:51] thy will be done all right same way with
[18:52] you and I that you shall neither be
[18:54] Barren it'll make you that you shall
[18:57] neither be Barren nor unre fruitful in
[18:58] the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
[19:00] now buddy if you got the knowledge of
[19:01] Jesus
[19:03] Christ you're there that's right okay
[19:07] and that's what I believe brother
[19:08] Brandon brought us was the mind of God
[19:10] he brought us the knowledge of Jesus
[19:13] Christ who he was what he was doing here
[19:16] exactly and why he was here right so
[19:19] then we can understand how we got here
[19:21] that's right what we're doing here and
[19:22] where we're going all right that which
[19:25] was which is which is to come right
[19:28] brother bam read that many times in the
[19:30] in the seal book and people don't catch
[19:33] that but that's exactly what the Seal's
[19:34] done it showed you where you come from
[19:36] what you doing here and where you
[19:38] going there's not a hope
[19:42] anymore there's not a hope you know in
[19:44] the Baptist Church meth they have a hope
[19:47] right we hope this happens we hope when
[19:49] Jesus comes we hope and it's okay to say
[19:51] hope because the Bible does in Romans 8
[19:54] it says therefore we you know we have
[19:56] hope for it but but hope has to turn
[19:58] into faith and faith is where you have
[20:00] to say that's where the confidence in is
[20:02] in because hope is like well I don't
[20:04] know if Daniel 70 weeks is right or not
[20:06] brother randam made this here and he
[20:08] made so many mistakes here and brother
[20:09] randam wasn't right here the cloud here
[20:11] see that to me that's breaking all Faith
[20:14] down that's right and that's what Satan
[20:17] did with Eve he broke her faith down
[20:19] that's right now that's what he's trying
[20:21] to do you and I as the Bride As the eve
[20:23] of the end time he's trying to break us
[20:26] down right whether we're Christians or
[20:28] not he knows listen Satan knows whether
[20:31] you're born again or
[20:33] not you may
[20:35] not but Satan knows if you're born again
[20:38] or
[20:40] not he feels it he's the spirit he's a
[20:44] supernatural anointed
[20:46] being y so he knows whether you're born
[20:49] again or not that's why brother BR says
[20:51] when you get the new birth Satan turns
[20:53] every gun on you why cuz he
[20:55] knows he's going to try now to destroy
[20:58] destroy your body that's right get you
[21:00] off this Earth because this is his
[21:02] edting for right now right he wants to
[21:05] get you away from here he don't even
[21:06] want to see you again cuz see he can't
[21:08] go in the sixth Dimension that's one
[21:10] thing for sure Satan might can go in
[21:12] Four 3 2 and one or even five but six
[21:15] and seven he's not allowed I don't
[21:17] believe right I don't believe he's
[21:19] allowed there cuz only Christians going
[21:21] in the sixth Dimension and Jesus is the
[21:22] only one in the seventh glorified body
[21:24] in the seventh Dimension so Satan can
[21:27] only roam see to and fro in the Earth
[21:29] the Bible says right but not in the six
[21:32] Dimension he ain't roaming around I
[21:35] promise
[21:37] okay I got to quit preaching and start
[21:39] teaching finish that's good Greek
[21:41] lexican okay godliness means
[21:44] Holiness that's pretty simple but look
[21:47] reverence respect pety towards God or
[21:52] godliness and here is where that same
[21:56] word is used
[21:58] used Timothy must have had a good
[22:02] observation of this cuz a lot of this is
[22:04] in Timothy talks about godliness but
[22:07] watch and without
[22:08] controversy great is the mystery of
[22:10] godliness so there's a mystery of
[22:12] godliness what is it God was manifest In
[22:15] the
[22:16] Flesh justified in the spirit right seen
[22:20] of angels M preached unto the Gentiles
[22:24] believed on in the world received up in
[22:27] the glory now about Jesus Christ
[22:29] right what about me and
[22:35] you if we don't make it personal that's
[22:38] right then it's just a hope
[22:41] so I hope Jesus did that that's right I
[22:45] hope he did no if you got the new birth
[22:48] you know that cuz great without
[22:51] controversy other words I'm not even
[22:52] going to argue with you Paul say I'm not
[22:55] arguing with you about this I'm just
[22:57] telling you who it it is God was
[22:59] manifest In the Flesh if you're born
[23:01] again that's exactly true justified in
[23:03] the spirit amen seen of angels preached
[23:07] unto the Gentiles aren't we doing that
[23:09] now same thing believed on in the world
[23:11] and received up into the glory that's
[23:13] where we're going to go when we get out
[23:14] of here then Timothy says in 1 Timothy
[23:18] 4:6 if thou put the brethren in
[23:20] remembrance of these things Thou shalt
[23:22] be a good minister of Jesus Christ
[23:24] nourished up in the words of faith and
[23:25] of good Doctrine wherein to thou Hast
[23:29] attained but refuse profane and old
[23:32] wives fables and exercise thyself rather
[23:35] unto godliness
[23:37] exercise do something all right exercise
[23:40] your faith for bodily exercise profit is
[23:44] little but godliness is profitable unto
[23:46] all things that's right okay having
[23:50] promise of the life that now
[23:55] is he just showed you what was right
[23:59] Jesus Christ what is you MH having
[24:03] promis of the life that now is and of
[24:06] that which is to come that which was
[24:09] which is which is to come all right
[24:12] that's good this is a faithful saying
[24:16] and worthy of all acceptation in other
[24:19] words you should accept
[24:21] this it's worthy of all acceptance we
[24:24] should accept this that that's what he's
[24:26] talking about in second Timothy talks
[24:29] about the other side having a form of
[24:32] godliness not having godliness but a
[24:34] form because Satan has a form of
[24:37] godliness he's spiritual he's
[24:40] Supernatural so he has a form what's
[24:44] form is an image Satan wants to be
[24:48] God okay so that that's pretty simple
[24:51] having a form of godliness but denying
[24:54] the power
[24:55] thereof from such
[24:59] turn away right so turn away from those
[25:02] things that are not godliness let's see
[25:04] what brother Brown talks about here but
[25:06] if you got genuine Faith then put
[25:08] genuine virtue to it then genuine
[25:10] knowledge then genuine Temperance then
[25:12] genuine patience see you're moving right
[25:15] on up the line all right fifthly add
[25:19] godliness oh my godliness to be added
[25:22] what does godliness mean I looked on
[25:23] four or five dictionaries and couldn't
[25:25] even find what it meant finally I was
[25:27] brother Jeff there we found in the
[25:29] dictionary God and this means to be like
[25:34] God oh my after you got faith virtue
[25:37] knowledge Temperance patience then be
[25:39] like
[25:40] God you see I can't do that brother
[25:42] brandom oh yes you can there's where you
[25:46] better lay it on right there yes sir oh
[25:48] yes you
[25:51] can let me just read a few scriptures
[25:53] now then he's fixing to tell you how you
[25:55] can is that kind of right pretty simple
[25:58] if he says yes you can a prophet just
[26:00] don't say yes you can and leave at
[26:02] handang he brings you back to the word
[26:05] because being a word prophet he has to
[26:06] tell you how this is going to happen
[26:08] that's right all right let me just read
[26:10] you a few scriptures here just in
[26:11] Matthew 5:48 we'll take this one and see
[26:13] what it sounds like Matthew 5:48 see if
[26:15] you're supposed to be like God you know
[26:18] the Bible says ye are Gods Jesus said so
[26:22] why all the virtue all the things that's
[26:24] in God is in you mhm Matthew 5:48 be e
[26:29] Jesus speaking in Beatitudes be
[26:31] therefore p e r f e c what's that
[26:35] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[26:38] perfect you get way up here now before
[26:40] you're asked to do that so you're
[26:42] getting way up there before he asked you
[26:44] to be actually you can't act this you
[26:48] you can act but you can't be this part
[26:50] of godliness without faith and virtue
[26:52] and knowledge and Temperance these
[26:54] things are exactly the way they're
[26:55] supposed to be all right
[26:58] but
[26:59] now you get way up here before you asked
[27:01] to do that all these things has to be
[27:03] added first then when you get up here
[27:07] he's asked you now to be perfect
[27:09] godliness Sons and Daughters of God
[27:10] that's right how many things I could say
[27:13] along that line now he goes to Ephesians
[27:18] 4 what's Ephesians 4 how are you going
[27:22] to get
[27:25] godliness watch Ephesians 4
[27:29] he gave some Apostles some prophets some
[27:32] pastors and some teachers some
[27:34] evangelists for the perfecting of the
[27:38] Saints let's turn to Ephesians 4 and
[27:40] find out over here in the book of
[27:41] Ephesians it says about this thing to
[27:44] about how we should how we should do
[27:46] Ephesians the 4th chapter begin with the
[27:47] 12th verse Ephesians 4 begin with the
[27:49] 12th verse all right let's begin up here
[27:51] at 11th birth and he gave some Apostles
[27:54] and some prophets remember last night
[27:55] don't try to take the other man's office
[27:57] see some evangelists and some pastors
[27:59] and some teachers for the perfecting of
[28:02] God does it read like that congregation
[28:05] say no the perfecting of what Saints who
[28:09] are the Saints the Sanctified ones the
[28:11] one started from down here I'm sure he's
[28:14] pointing at the bottom of the pyramid
[28:15] from down here all right perfecting of
[28:18] the Saints for the working of the
[28:19] ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ
[28:21] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[28:23] for the edifying building it up edifying
[28:25] until till what till we all come to the
[28:28] unity of the faith and the knowledge of
[28:31] the Son of God and to the perfect man
[28:33] and to the Assurance oh my to the
[28:35] measure of the stature of the fullness
[28:37] of Christ wait what sermon was that H
[28:40] what sermon was that stand the name of
[28:43] that statue of perfect
[28:45] man yeah there it is right there on the
[28:49] header okay
[28:51] right yeah that's what we're going to be
[28:53] on we're on the Statue of perfect
[28:55] man perfect takes godliness you have to
[28:59] add to your faith godliness see you
[29:01] start off down here with virtue then you
[29:03] go to knowledge and you go to Temperance
[29:05] then you go to patience now you're on
[29:07] godliness godliness oh my our time's
[29:09] getting away let's see but you know what
[29:11] godliness meant you sing the song to be
[29:12] like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I
[29:14] long to be like him all through life
[29:16] Journey from Earth to Glory I only ask
[29:18] to be like him that's
[29:20] godliness when he was Smite on one side
[29:22] of the face he turned the other when he
[29:24] was spoke too rough he didn't speak he
[29:27] didn't back they guard they always
[29:29] looking for one
[29:30] thing here's the key I always do that
[29:35] which pleases the father now boy we got
[29:38] a long way to go
[29:42] yes I always do that which pleases the
[29:47] father but now remember I stopped right
[29:49] there because it's a
[29:52] requirement we've come up this far and
[29:54] you say oh godliness is the is the
[29:56] roughest one one no I think brotherly
[29:59] kindness is the roughest one
[30:01] right
[30:04] patience patience is you know
[30:06] everybody's got their different ones
[30:07] that battles they got to fight but
[30:09] brotherly kindness brother randam says
[30:11] You must the Bible says You must love
[30:14] your neighbor as you love yourself you
[30:16] say well I love my neighbor he's a good
[30:17] guy don't ever give me no problem you
[30:19] got to love him just like you love you
[30:21] that's right that's what Jesus said he
[30:23] said the greatest
[30:26] commandment then what do he tell them he
[30:27] said love one
[30:29] another we'll see what brother Bri says
[30:31] about brotherly kindness that's why it's
[30:32] way up there at the top yeah cuz you got
[30:35] to have every one of these virtues
[30:37] before you can have brotherly kindness I
[30:39] promise you cuz that goes back remember
[30:42] we talked about faith virtue knowledge
[30:44] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[30:46] kindness is something that's got to come
[30:49] from
[30:50] inside can you imagine what was said
[30:53] about brother bran and he knew what was
[30:57] said and yet they said he nobody knew
[31:00] who his enemies were that's what Billy
[31:02] Paul said said he did not know who you
[31:05] wouldn't know if you talked to brother
[31:07] brandham there was no way you could tell
[31:09] if somebody was for him or against him
[31:11] he spoke about every well see he had
[31:13] brother he had the Seal of God he had
[31:15] the Holy Spirit sealed all that
[31:18] in and and and before we get to there
[31:21] but I want you to chew on something you
[31:23] know brother brandham had to go up this
[31:24] statue of a perfect man before he could
[31:26] preach it
[31:29] you can't preach something you're not
[31:30] aware of you can't I mean you can preach
[31:32] it but you preach it in vain you preach
[31:34] it in Hope but brother B said it took
[31:36] him 30 years to preach this why CU God
[31:38] had to take him up that statute of
[31:39] perfect man just like he did Peter but
[31:42] see Peter and them stop where exist
[31:44] brotherly kindness there with the Holy
[31:47] Spirit molding all that together but the
[31:49] headstone or the Revelation that brought
[31:52] all these things together had not come
[31:54] yet but it did come to brother brandham
[31:56] see that's the adoption part you're not
[31:58] adopted at Faith you get the spirit of
[32:00] adoption at Faith everybody understand
[32:03] that maybe we'll talk about that next
[32:05] Sunday for a little bit because to come
[32:07] to adoption you receive the spirit of
[32:09] adoption in Romans 8 right somewhere in
[32:12] 16 or 18 somewhere in there in Romans 8
[32:14] you receive the spirit of adoption
[32:16] crying ABA father daddy daddy crying you
[32:19] don't cry when you get up to brotherly
[32:23] kindness okay yeah but it's always go
[32:26] ahead to me a scatch up man is a working
[32:30] process all the time that's correct but
[32:32] but the whole thing is you try well I'm
[32:35] grown a lot I really do I have worse Val
[32:38] I have a better time with driving
[32:40] because of
[32:41] Dr um and she told me some some things
[32:44] to do but in the grocery store I have
[32:49] and it's not because somebody looking at
[32:50] me but the me and the devil we have a
[32:54] wonderful time where you have made a a
[32:57] me aware of I don't take nothing I I I
[33:01] cuz it's hard it's all get I to go to
[33:05] the the dairy Department you way over
[33:07] there in the bread Department yeah you
[33:10] don't took something you don't want it
[33:12] once upon a time I never PL where I left
[33:14] got it throw it out right but I have the
[33:17] worstest time in the grocery stores now
[33:19] when I get something and I got to go way
[33:21] on the other side and put it back
[33:24] because you got to Bight but but the
[33:26] whole thing is
[33:27] what I'm saying you working cuz I told
[33:30] you to make it better you got to make
[33:31] yourself better no nobody nobody know
[33:34] down but God knows and the devil said
[33:37] uhhuh and you I've done it recently
[33:42] Rome got to the car and said uhhuh you
[33:45] didn't put that SW back where you got
[33:47] from did
[33:48] you so he he check me out and said okay
[33:51] you can't count that as doing it so it's
[33:53] a working process it's not like you br
[33:56] you know you put your
[33:58] got go back but you always got to go up
[34:01] you got to keep
[34:02] checking check check to the check the
[34:05] check it's never finished
[34:07] project it's it'll finish but still
[34:11] that's human
[34:13] life I did the same thing yesterday I I
[34:16] went somewhere Jacob wasn't with me
[34:18] yesterday he went somewhere else and did
[34:19] some work and I was by myself I walked
[34:22] by a piece of
[34:24] paper I did the same thing that he had
[34:26] Dred on the ground cuz I knew where it
[34:28] come from it come out of Jacob truck it
[34:30] was in your yard or the yard up there
[34:32] and I walked by it and I was my back's
[34:35] been killing me for 2 or three days and
[34:37] I didn't want to bend over no more than
[34:38] I needed to you know I walked past that
[34:40] thing and I believe it was the Lord
[34:42] might have been the devil but sometimes
[34:44] you can't tell the difference maybe you
[34:46] can but I can't you know what but it
[34:49] came to my memory though you told them
[34:51] people y'all to make a place better
[34:54] whether you did it or not you make the
[34:56] place better when you leave so I turned
[34:58] back around walked over there and pick
[35:00] that piece of paper up put it in the
[35:02] trash okay so that it may not be the
[35:05] devil since Journey may be God saying
[35:08] hey there's your example and it's like
[35:10] you said I'm watching you I don't care
[35:12] whether everybody else is watching see I
[35:14] feel better now that's right by doing it
[35:17] you say pick a piece of
[35:18] paper the devil's going to condemn you
[35:20] all day if you don't that's right so
[35:23] best thing to do is even if he is
[35:24] condemning you walk over pick the sucker
[35:26] up put it in in the trash and go I'm
[35:28] done I don't have to deal with that no
[35:30] more just like here yeah this is a big
[35:35] example right here yeah big up like the
[35:37] other day I was coming up step they
[35:39] piece of paper about that big about in
[35:42] front of study I watched I don't know
[35:45] how many people walk over that pie of

[35:50] that piece of paper up they did I did
[35:54] and I I did that in the store I'll see a
[35:57] piece of paper pick up I mean you just
