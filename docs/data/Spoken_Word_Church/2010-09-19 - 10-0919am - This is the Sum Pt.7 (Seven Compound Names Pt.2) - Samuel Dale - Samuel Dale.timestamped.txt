[40:08] remember our point of what we've been
[40:10] bringing
[40:13] that Paul is saying here in the book of
[40:17] Hebrews now the things which we have
[40:20] spoken of this is the sum now of the
[40:23] things what all of the whole thing that
[40:26] he spoke spoken of and he is to some we
[40:29] have such an high priest who is set on
[40:33] the right hand of the Throne of the
[40:35] Majesty in the heavens what a wonderful
[40:38] thought to be thinking about you know
[40:41] who our Lord and our savior is okay
[40:43] Ecclesiastes when he's finishing up he
[40:45] said let us hear the conclusion of the
[40:48] whole matter fear God and keep his
[40:50] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[40:54] of man you may be seated the Lord at his
[40:56] Blessing to the reading of the
[41:00] word let
[41:01] me set this ban here at least
[41:14] running now we've been speaking for
[41:17] quite a while on the the things that I
[41:20] said the bringing it like from
[41:23] a partial understanding to a perfect
[41:26] understanding
[41:27] and you know trying to uh bring things
[41:30] into the situation that we can we can
[41:34] understand uh the things of God you know
[41:37] and I I hope you've been enjoying it I
[41:39] really have myself just thinking on it
[41:41] and doing it now this past Wednesday
[41:44] then we took and I hope you have the
[41:47] notes that we gave if you don't have the
[41:50] notes we gave on
[41:52] Wednesday uh would you please just let
[41:55] us know and we'll try to uh get you a
[41:58] copy of Cu we want you to uh do it I
[42:01] hope if you didn't get it you got to be
[42:03] able to see our hearers on the internet
[42:06] all right now what we've been doing or
[42:08] what we was doing this past
[42:11] Wednesday was you just brother
[42:14] especially if it's one of those or so of
[42:17] this one has everybody got a copy of
[42:18] this
[42:19] one this the seven compound names do
[42:22] anybody I didn't think about it brother
[42:25] if there's not enough in our brother Joe
[42:27] will run some off on the the uh computer
[42:30] back at the back so you know if you have
[42:33] those but especially read those notes
[42:35] because what we done Wednesday was just
[42:39] read what brother randam
[42:41] said and I hope you you enjoyed it to be
[42:45] able to just see what he was saying
[42:47] about the compound names of Jehovah all
[42:51] right and how that they all must be
[42:55] found in Jesus
[42:57] Christ right now so that was what Dr
[43:01] brother Bosworth asked Dr beess you know
[43:04] to the seven compound names of Jehovah
[43:06] apply to Jesus Christ yes or no well he
[43:08] couldn't answer it because if he said
[43:10] yes on one side no on the other side he
[43:13] would have been wrong and he knew it so
[43:14] he couldn't answer him to to that but my
[43:17] point this past Wednesday was one thing
[43:20] I want to restate it to you that do we
[43:26] count all of the Redemptive names of
[43:30] Jehovah do we count them as all to
[43:35] be the same
[43:38] value I don't know of any other way to
[43:40] say it or whatever to do but I believe
[43:43] that's where we're
[43:45] missing the way that we need to be
[43:47] seeing God okay because we put uh a lot
[43:52] of emphasis and thank God for it upon
[43:55] Jehovah Gyra which which would be the
[43:57] Lord's provided sacrifice and Amen on
[44:00] that because everything is connected to
[44:02] do into that and like I said if you
[44:05] didn't have him as Jehovah Gyra the
[44:08] Lord's provided sacrifice then you
[44:09] wouldn't have him as as Jehovah RI the
[44:13] Healer you wouldn't have him as Jehovah
[44:15] TI you you know our righteousness none
[44:17] of that would have be of any value right
[44:19] had he been we say well we were just uh
[44:22] the the stripes brought it I tried to
[44:24] bring that out Wednesday if you just had
[44:26] the beating the back of the Lord Jesus
[44:28] the blood running out without the death
[44:31] at Calvary
[44:33] right you wouldn't have no
[44:36] healing right cuz it takes life to
[44:40] heal the blood is not what heals
[44:44] you it is not taking a compound you know
[44:48] of the blood and putting it on you it's
[44:51] faith in the blood it's faith in the
[44:55] blood that was shed for you
[44:58] that heals you all right and if it
[45:00] hadn't been the shedding of the blood
[45:02] see if there hadn't been a
[45:05] sacrifice there would be no uh point of
[45:08] even talking about healing or anything
[45:11] else so that was what I was trying to
[45:13] say Wednesday and I want you to think on
[45:15] those things I believe we put emphasis
[45:18] upon the Jehovah Gyra which you know is
[45:21] the Lord provided sacrifices we'll get
[45:24] in a minute but I don't believe that we
[45:26] put enough emphasis upon all of the
[45:30] other you know compound names which are
[45:33] not names they are titles to a name
[45:36] because there's only one name and that's
[45:38] the name of Jesus but then you got those
[45:41] uh compound names as revealing you
[45:45] remember we brought out brother Brandon
[45:46] was talking about how that through those
[45:48] names it would be brought out about his
[45:52] attributes would be revealed how that
[45:55] his nature would be revealed even God's
[46:00] attitude read those notes and and look
[46:03] at them even his attitude toward man
[46:07] would be brought out through the
[46:08] revealing of his name all right and even
[46:12] to the bases of the very nature or
[46:15] character of
[46:17] God would be displayed through those
[46:20] things and and you know and we could
[46:22] look at it all
[46:23] right and remember now that you cannot
[46:28] separate those
[46:30] names so you can't make one greater than
[46:33] the
[46:34] other as I said it's all hinged upon
[46:37] whether or not he was our sacrifice
[46:40] Jehovah Gyra yes sir read it all hinges
[46:44] upon that but was he going to just
[46:47] display that he was the
[46:49] Healer what is the attributes of God
[46:53] savior healer Redeemer all the things is
[46:56] his attributes well then being his
[46:58] attributes was one greater than the
[47:03] other you know where would we get the
[47:05] idea that that would be but I believe
[47:07] that's where we miss our
[47:09] healing sure we want to say that we're
[47:13] saved and like I said Wednesday you
[47:15] wouldn't dare to get anybody you know
[47:16] walk up somebody are you saved yes I'm
[47:20] saved but didn't you walk up to somebody
[47:22] say are you healed well don't know now
[47:27] how what would give us the right to say
[47:30] that
[47:33] right well healing is just temporary
[47:36] brother Dale but it's already paid
[47:39] for it's already
[47:42] finished we're the ones that's limiting
[47:45] that that's what I was trying to get
[47:46] across Wednesday I want to get into the
[47:48] names you know and just cover the
[47:49] scripture but I want you to see what I
[47:51] trying to say if we look at him as
[47:54] Jehovah Gyra
[47:57] but we make it of some lesser value or
[48:00] some uh you know way of De demoting down
[48:04] or whatever you would call it I don't
[48:05] have the education so I just talk in
[48:07] plain sense that I got on my own that's
[48:10] very little
[48:11] but how can you make one greater than
[48:14] the
[48:16] other if he is one I gave him to you
[48:19] there Wednesday brother R said he if he
[48:22] is Jehovah
[48:23] Gyra then he must also be Jehovah Raa
[48:28] our healer right but now if he's not our
[48:31] healer he's not our savior that's right
[48:34] if he's not our savior he's not our
[48:36] healer either way you want to go
[48:37] backwards and forth everywhere you want
[48:39] to go you can't separate
[48:43] it cuz he's the same yesterday today and
[48:46] forever
[48:48] am but see I believe that we we put too
[48:50] much emphasis upon now and I don't
[48:54] Heaven Help Me forgive me you know
[48:57] somebody listening to me they don't what
[48:58] in the world I'm talking about anyway
[48:59] and I guess that's true but we put
[49:02] emphasis upon the fact that he is our
[49:06] savior but do we put the same emphasis
[49:09] upon the fact that he's our healer right
[49:13] well in a way I guess you could say that
[49:15] now there's no such
[49:18] thing you remember how we were bringing
[49:20] it out from page 31 there the church age
[49:22] book where brother random was talking
[49:24] about if we believe that he died for us
[49:26] us we must believe that we're just as
[49:29] righteous as he is by being in him he
[49:32] said to accept one is to accept the
[49:33] other to reject one is to reject the
[49:36] other that's
[49:39] right and I bring that over to what
[49:42] we're talking about here that to reject
[49:46] the fact that each one of the compound
[49:49] names of Jehovah is trying to reveal
[49:52] God to
[49:54] us and to turn that down and say well I
[49:58] don't
[50:00] know sometimes I feel like I'm Healed
[50:03] sometimes I don't feel like I'm Healed
[50:04] that's what's wrong with us that's right
[50:06] Amen brother God's word don't talk that
[50:10] way amen God says we're healed God says
[50:14] we're perfect God says we're righteous
[50:18] amen but I just can't see it that's
[50:21] what's
[50:22] wrong so we're
[50:24] putting not the correct value you up the
[50:28] point that I'm trying to make we're
[50:30] trying to make one thing greater than
[50:32] the other now how can you do
[50:36] that that was the whole thing of
[50:38] Wednesday night you know and I know I
[50:40] was my wife even said going home you
[50:42] know said sometimes you found sound like
[50:44] you just having trouble starting off and
[50:47] all but I want you to get it I don't
[50:50] care what it takes amen I mean we can go
[50:54] here six and seven sermons and amen and
[50:57] all like that that's wonderful and good
[50:59] you know and the exhorted messages I
[51:02] love that but I still like to just get
[51:05] down and think about it that's right you
[51:08] know then somebody preaches an exhorting
[51:10] message I got something to shout
[51:13] about I know what I'm doing I'm happy
[51:16] then but
[51:19] now get let's get that and then we'll
[51:21] get off of it if he's greater in one way
[51:25] than he is in the other how can you make
[51:26] him God
[51:30] right well you just don't understand but
[51:32] I agree so you got to pull pit this
[51:34] evening you explain it to
[51:39] us okay no sarcasm just truth sisters or
[51:44] whatever give you the ppit this evening
[51:46] and you explain how that he can be
[51:48] greater on one thing than he can on the
[51:50] other and then you make him Hebrews 13:8
[51:58] see we're we're not counting it in the
[52:00] correct
[52:02] way especially to get down to the last
[52:05] one that I told you that I kind of moved
[52:07] these around from what they were in the
[52:09] run off the computer not not not R
[52:11] around them now the computer thing to
[52:14] where that it showed you know the seven
[52:15] compound Redemptive names I moved them
[52:18] around purposely because I wanted to
[52:20] bring it out a certain way and to finish
[52:22] it up by saying Jehovah shal Jehovah Tom
[52:26] Mar which means his presence but do we
[52:30] believe he's
[52:34] here
[52:36] we amen
[52:38] amen now how could you ever be saved if
[52:41] you wouldn't hear amen but do you put
[52:44] that on there though do you put that
[52:47] value exactly like your
[52:51] salvation not no that's that's what
[52:55] we're not doing all right so we need to
[52:57] do
[52:58] that but now let's just get into to the
[53:01] message for or the part today I want you
[53:03] to see because for me to keep on harping
[53:06] on that will not show you a thing that's
[53:10] what everybody
[53:11] thinks you know no but revealing of the
[53:15] word of God will show us the
[53:18] truth so then we'll we'll learn the
[53:21] truth from that all right so now the
[53:23] first one that we look at is Jehovah
[53:28] Gyra so if you want to go ahead and turn
[53:31] to Genesis
[53:33] 22 then let's just start on these seven
[53:36] Redemptive names or compound names of
[53:39] Jehovah and like I said now be this
[53:44] sensible talking it's not names because
[53:47] there's not seven names of God there are
[53:51] seven uh
[53:53] manifestations of God cuz there not said
[53:56] seven spirits of God there's it's the
[53:58] spirit of God in each Church age
[54:00] manifesting itself and the Seven
[54:02] Redemptive names is God
[54:05] revealing under those names his nature
[54:09] his character his
[54:11] way what he has been doing what he's
[54:14] doing now and what he'll continue to do
[54:17] it's being revealed throughout the word
[54:19] of
[54:21] God okay so then we will find those
[54:25] things and now some of the these words
[54:27] I'll try to remember them when I get
[54:28] there some of these words are spelled
[54:31] different in some
[54:33] forms and you will not find a couple of
[54:36] them as actually being Jehovah Rah R
[54:40] A- ah which is the Lord our the Lord our
[54:44] my shepherd uh you won't find that word
[54:47] Jehovah re in the scriptures there are
[54:50] some I think there's five of them in the
[54:52] scriptures maybe and a couple of them
[54:54] that are not but let's go over there and
[54:55] look at it Jehovah
[54:58] Gyra now why would he be called Jehovah
[55:04] Gyra well it means the Lord will
[55:09] provide okay so let's go over in Genesis
[55:12] and just pick these and go kind of slow
[55:15] with it and just read the scriptures and
[55:17] things you know and and see what's going
[55:20] on now we know the background story of
[55:23] what here is happening in Genesis 2
[55:27] 22 this is the time that Abraham is told
[55:31] to take his son upon the
[55:34] mountain and kill
[55:38] him
[55:39] now he starts
[55:43] out and he comes to the
[55:47] place to where that he's fulfilling what
[55:50] God is saying now what about God asking
[55:52] him or telling a man to go kill his only
[55:54] son he said now wait a minute God
[55:57] doesn't do things like that well what
[55:59] kind of a God are you
[56:04] got you know I mean it's in the
[56:08] Bible well God wouldn't ask us to kill
[56:11] one of our
[56:13] kids now somebody's already done that
[56:16] but what if he asked you to believe the
[56:19] word you got any
[56:23] problems you got any problems of with
[56:26] him asking you to do
[56:29] something
[56:33] you you understand what I'm saying God
[56:37] called me to
[56:40] preach well I just do what he called me
[56:43] to
[56:45] do okay I I I I've never been a Hell's
[56:49] Angels and I don't have tattoos all over
[56:51] my bodies and I never was a drunk I
[56:53] never was a dop adct and things like
[56:55] that so I don't have any anything to
[56:56] brag
[56:58] about you know that's what most
[56:59] preachers do you know they try to tell
[57:01] you where all they come from all I can
[57:03] do is
[57:04] preach you
[57:06] know that's just the only ability I have
[57:09] that's you know I don't have all that
[57:11] other to brag about I was sinner
[57:15] enough you know but I just have to to be
[57:20] what I am but all right now what
[57:22] happened to Abraham
[57:26] we know the story that he goes and he's
[57:30] going to offer
[57:32] Isaac he's going to do what God told
[57:35] him Isaac up about the 11th verse you
[57:38] know whatever uh 10th 11th he said uh
[57:42] you know in other words father he's
[57:45] getting kind of concerned about that
[57:46] time you know cuz he looks around and
[57:49] there they work here in the wood and
[57:51] carrying the fire and you know now they
[57:53] didn't carry the fire the whole 3 days
[57:55] so evidently the last day they buil them
[57:57] a fire you know and they picked up and
[57:59] they started down the road going on and
[58:00] left the servants over there you know
[58:03] and y'all stay here the Lin I go and the
[58:05] ltin I shall return now that's what
[58:08] Abraham had said cuz he believed it but
[58:11] what was he going to do he was going to
[58:14] go kill his only son right you know I
[58:17] like the way brother Richard Wilson says
[58:19] about it he said he didn't have nothing
[58:21] to bring him from and he got a son named
[58:24] Isaac no no hulks no whatsoever now if
[58:28] he took him up there and burned him he'd
[58:30] at least have some
[58:32] ashes you know so Abraham had a whole
[58:35] lot more you know than you'd think all
[58:38] right but he he's going up you know the
[58:40] little lad says
[58:42] uh you know here's the fire and here's
[58:45] the wood you got a knife but said
[58:47] where's the
[58:51] sacrifice so I like what it says and
[58:55] Abram made his Abraham made his
[58:56] statement verse
[58:59] 8 he said my son God will provide
[59:03] himself a lamb for a burnt
[59:09] offering now you can read that two ways
[59:11] but it comes back to the same
[59:17] answer so you can read that is saying
[59:20] now son God's going to provide a lamb
[59:28] that's what he
[59:30] done but then you can read it the other
[59:32] way of said now son God will provide
[59:41] himself a
[59:43] lamb that's two ways looking at it ain't
[59:46] but you know to come out to be the same
[59:48] thing because wound up with a lamb but
[59:50] it was a prophecy of
[59:53] what Calvary
[59:57] that God would
[59:59] himself come
[1:00:01] down to die for our
[1:00:04] sins he wouldn't send a son he didn't
[1:00:08] send a second person he came
[1:00:11] himself so the Lord provided a sacrifice
[1:00:14] a lamb for Abraham in a
[1:00:19] natural but he was
[1:00:20] saying one of these days there's going
[1:00:22] to be a great sacrifice coming
[1:00:26] and the Lord himself is going to take
[1:00:27] care of that son see because this is
[1:00:30] working but like I told you Abraham is
[1:00:34] going up
[1:00:35] there and you know what the lamb that he
[1:00:38] was going to offer cuz he's told to do
[1:00:43] it the lamb he thought he was going to
[1:00:48] offer was his
[1:00:52] son that true now he said now he had
[1:00:55] this great
[1:00:56] no if he had that great Revelation why
[1:00:58] didn't he walk out there and find a lamb
[1:01:00] tied in the bushes and grab it and take
[1:01:02] off with
[1:01:03] it no no no no get the whole story he
[1:01:06] was just plain oh honest man walking up
[1:01:08] there he was going to go do what God
[1:01:10] told him to do that's right God told him
[1:01:14] to kill his son that's right he's going
[1:01:17] to go do it amen cuz he believed God
[1:01:20] that's but see then God comes on the
[1:01:23] scene and says okay now I'll take care
[1:01:25] of it bring a lamb so he
[1:01:30] did see God stopped his hand he had him
[1:01:32] right up ready to kill him verse 10 11
[1:01:37] all and God calls from Heaven the angel
[1:01:40] of the Lord called out if you'll notice
[1:01:42] that's big old capital l r d he calls
[1:01:45] out unto him and he says you know hold
[1:01:48] your hand just St don't do
[1:01:51] it Abram lifted up his eyes verse 133
[1:01:54] and behold behind him a ram caught in
[1:01:57] the
[1:01:58] thicket looked and behold behind him a
[1:02:00] ram caught in the thicket by his horns
[1:02:03] and Abraham went and took the RAM and
[1:02:05] offered him for a burnt offering in the
[1:02:07] stead of his son
[1:02:10] now verse 14 and Abraham called the name
[1:02:14] of that
[1:02:16] place Jehovah
[1:02:20] Gyra as it is said to this day in the
[1:02:23] Mount of the Lord it shall be seen
[1:02:27] Jehovah
[1:02:29] Gyra actually it means Jehovah c s e
[1:02:36] e s is the way it's really pronounced
[1:02:40] Jehovah SE are in other words God sees
[1:02:44] the need and he's going to take care of
[1:02:47] it right right because he's Jehovah
[1:02:52] Gyra our Lord's sacrifice
[1:02:56] and I think that we need to see you know
[1:03:01] if anything I think you and I need to
[1:03:03] see who our sacrifice is right cuz I
[1:03:07] said There Goes Abraham up there to
[1:03:08] offer his son he thought that was the
[1:03:10] one that he was going to kill and he
[1:03:12] fully had it in his mind to go do it cuz
[1:03:14] God told him am but then God steps on
[1:03:18] the scene and provides a natural lamb
[1:03:21] for
[1:03:23] Abraham showing that it calv what would
[1:03:26] take place that the Lord himself would
[1:03:29] descend
[1:03:31] right not another person's
[1:03:34] here you get another person your
[1:03:36] sacrifice is
[1:03:38] wrong now Abraham at that time had
[1:03:43] another
[1:03:44] son right they believe his name was
[1:03:51] ishma but God made it specifically the
[1:03:55] point saying Abraham take thine son
[1:03:58] thine only son right all right we know
[1:04:01] the
[1:04:04] story ishmail never come from when his
[1:04:06] name was Abraham Ishmael came when his
[1:04:09] name was Abram right amen all right so
[1:04:14] Abram was the father
[1:04:17] of you know ish
[1:04:21] right but then his name was changed to
[1:04:24] Abraham right and that made him the
[1:04:26] father
[1:04:27] of Isaac but now if you go to reading
[1:04:31] your scriptures see people don't read
[1:04:33] and try to keep the story straight if
[1:04:36] you'll keep reading if you don't last me
[1:04:38] I'll show you on the computer and you'll
[1:04:40] find out that the scripture talks about
[1:04:43] ishma being the son of
[1:04:49] Abraham why because he's the same man
[1:04:53] right right right right it's just
[1:04:57] distinguishing the fact of thine son
[1:04:59] thine only son promised son is what
[1:05:03] you're talking about right Isaac was the
[1:05:06] promised
[1:05:07] son okay that's why Abraham was going to
[1:05:10] offer him right he was the promised son
[1:05:14] all right but he stopped because God
[1:05:17] stopped him to show him who the real
[1:05:19] promised son was going to
[1:05:23] be and that would be Jesus
[1:05:27] Christ but now watch what I'm the point
[1:05:29] I'm trying to get you to say see he said
[1:05:32] he would provide a lamb verse eight God
[1:05:36] will provide a
[1:05:38] lamb all right so it's easy to
[1:05:41] understand so it was written out there
[1:05:43] and the scripture and they actually
[1:05:45] wrote out the
[1:05:46] name and said is this the name of this
[1:05:49] place
[1:05:50] here will be Jehovah Gyra because God
[1:05:54] saw the need Jehovah
[1:05:56] overseas and he became the
[1:06:01] sacrifice right now that goes all the
[1:06:04] way to Calvary because there where God
[1:06:06] provided the real
[1:06:11] sacrifice like I said now if you try to
[1:06:13] make him some other person so you take
[1:06:15] this and try to bring down your River
[1:06:17] Jordan doctrines and Things They said
[1:06:19] that Jesus was just a man till the River
[1:06:22] Jordan and then he become God and then
[1:06:24] God left him and and all that and the
[1:06:26] other then you don't you don't have God
[1:06:27] giv his life right then you got so old
[1:06:31] they're so wonderful in their Revelation
[1:06:33] but my God can't die when mine
[1:06:36] dead that I might
[1:06:42] live that's the difference in the way I
[1:06:44] believe it and what everybody else
[1:06:46] believes it
[1:06:48] seemingly you say what God can't die
[1:06:50] brother
[1:06:52] Dale the life went out of that body
[1:06:55] right
[1:06:56] that was death right that was God
[1:06:59] himself providing a sacrifice that was
[1:07:02] not God providing a son to pay the
[1:07:07] price it was God coming
[1:07:11] himself to make a
[1:07:15] sacrifice now we're quick as I say to
[1:07:17] accept the
[1:07:19] fact and we believe on it that he is our
[1:07:24] savior
[1:07:27] M but can we believe he's our
[1:07:31] healer the same way we believe he's our
[1:07:38] savior have you ever even studied these
[1:07:41] names I asked you the other day would
[1:07:43] you listen to even just one tape I ain't
[1:07:46] no going to ask for no raise of hands
[1:07:48] but I just wonder how many of you heard
[1:07:50] that tape you know I ask you just to
[1:07:53] Simply listen to Jehovah under the seven
[1:07:56] compound names of Jehovah right but
[1:08:00] now have you ever just studied these
[1:08:04] Redemptive
[1:08:05] names Amen to see whether they apply to
[1:08:08] you or not
[1:08:11] right and that's why I keep saying it I
[1:08:14] want it buried into our head if nothing
[1:08:16] else maybe get in a heart
[1:08:19] sometime do we value each one the same
[1:08:23] or do we try to make it in degrees
[1:08:29] but see he's our
[1:08:33] sacrifice he took my
[1:08:36] place who took my place God took my
[1:08:40] place
[1:08:42] amen not a son of God there's no such
[1:08:45] thing in the Bible as those
[1:08:47] things God came himself
[1:08:52] righten that he could taste death your
[1:08:55] Prophets it we see everybody's got over
[1:08:57] they're so smart see but brother Dale
[1:09:00] God can't taste death God is a spirit
[1:09:04] there's where you're hooked
[1:09:07] at you just got God as a spirit that's
[1:09:15] floting how long could we preach on it
[1:09:17] how long have we preached on it the
[1:09:19] condescending of
[1:09:21] God that God himself descended to
[1:09:26] man he didn't send somebody else he came
[1:09:30] himself but he provided
[1:09:33] himself as a
[1:09:38] sacrifice all right and in doing that
[1:09:40] then see the word
[1:09:43] itself Jehovah
[1:09:45] Gyra God sees the the
[1:09:49] situation and God gives his own life
[1:09:55] the lamb was just a natural thing
[1:10:00] there cuz that wasn't that sacrifice
[1:10:03] that was made that one that that Abraham
[1:10:06] made was not the one to cover sin even
[1:10:11] in the natural that was not the one to
[1:10:12] cover
[1:10:15] sin the one to cover sin would have had
[1:10:17] to been taken to the high
[1:10:22] priest you would had to taken it up and
[1:10:24] made a sacrifice
[1:10:27] that lamb was just exactly what it was
[1:10:30] for to take the
[1:10:34] place of Isaac
[1:10:38] right right it didn't make Abraham
[1:10:45] righteous he didn't cover Abraham's
[1:10:54] sin he just saved Isaac's
[1:11:01] life see because Isaac was not the
[1:11:04] promised seed
[1:11:06] right right Jesus Christ was the
[1:11:09] promised seed so God would have to come
[1:11:15] himself are your sacrifices no good
[1:11:18] that's
[1:11:20] right you see why the my point of trying
[1:11:23] to we I try to preach to you to get you
[1:11:25] to think just just think about
[1:11:27] it man we're not supposed to think we're
[1:11:30] supposed to get it by Revelation amen
[1:11:34] but you can't get it by Revelation if
[1:11:36] your brain don't
[1:11:41] operate you can't get it by Revelation
[1:11:44] reading G omin
[1:11:49] it you get it by the study of God's word
[1:11:53] amen
[1:11:57] but you see do we make him what who was
[1:12:00] that sacrifice I know I was going to go
[1:12:03] through all of them today oh boy we may
[1:12:06] take three months on on this
[1:12:10] but get your mind on that
[1:12:14] sacrifice you know then that every time
[1:12:17] a little animal was taken up and killed
[1:12:19] it was speaking of Calvary
[1:12:22] yes then the high priest and they begin
[1:12:24] to offer lamb and you know they begin to
[1:12:26] do and every that bit of that just got
[1:12:29] getting stronger and
[1:12:31] stronger you know but you know after a
[1:12:33] while God
[1:12:36] said I'm tired of
[1:12:39] it you've made my
[1:12:43] offering a garbage can right that's what
[1:12:48] he
[1:12:48] said he said it's become a stink in my
[1:12:52] nostrils the things he Ed aain for man
[1:12:57] to
[1:12:59] do and you know what man was doing it
[1:13:03] they never quit offering the lamb and it
[1:13:06] became a stink no
[1:13:09] no it was the fact of not their
[1:13:13] sincerity right about what they were
[1:13:15] doing
[1:13:16] amen have we got to where we just go to
[1:13:19] church and claim to believe the message
[1:13:21] and just you know we're in the message
[1:13:23] what else do you want brother Dale
[1:13:26] I'm more worried right now than I have
[1:13:28] ever been in my life
[1:13:32] amen I try to keep it under cover and
[1:13:34] don't let you know it but you know if
[1:13:37] God don't step on the scene pretty quick
[1:13:40] folks we got a
[1:13:45] problem how many of you are over 60
[1:13:55] how many is over
[1:13:57] 70 we are 70 and
[1:14:02] over now time don't have nothing to do
[1:14:04] with it ain't worried about that time's
[1:14:06] not worrying me what's worrying me is
[1:14:10] you and
[1:14:11] me because we got to get out of
[1:14:15] here but it'll take the revealed word to
[1:14:18] get us out of here
[1:14:20] right it won't take this sermons of
[1:14:23] making us feel good
[1:14:25] and that's good it won't take you know
[1:14:29] things of like that or things that you
[1:14:32] know we think makes sense when they
[1:14:35] don't it's going to take the word of God
[1:14:38] Amen what kind of a sacrifice do you
[1:14:44] have my sacrifice was almighty God
[1:14:50] am no Brother D was a son
[1:14:57] no my sacrifice was almighty
[1:15:02] God that was the only way that God could
[1:15:05] taste
[1:15:06] death was to enter a human
[1:15:10] flesh by and mzc couldn't do it mzed
[1:15:16] could have felt pain mzc could have done
[1:15:18] this that the other but he couldn't be
[1:15:19] our
[1:15:21] sacrifice this one had to come because
[1:15:24] the word said it would that he would
[1:15:25] come virgin
[1:15:27] born and that it would be
[1:15:31] Emmanuel what kind of sacrifice do you
[1:15:39] have if he died that I might live then
[1:15:43] who
[1:15:45] died the you get into all of that with
[1:15:48] your mind it is don't try to figure it
[1:15:51] out just believe it
[1:15:55] God came down took him 4,000
[1:16:01] years because he came the wor the way he
[1:16:03] said he would come right and he came
[1:16:06] down to be Jehovah
[1:16:10] Gyra so the Lord did provide
[1:16:13] himself to be my
[1:16:16] sacrifice and yours if you'll accept
[1:16:21] it what greater could it be
[1:16:25] well I just can't understand I just I
[1:16:27] just can't understand because I don't
[1:16:29] see how God that's where you you're not
[1:16:31] looking at God correct
[1:16:33] way see then you get off of that and you
[1:16:35] get back and you need to go back and
[1:16:36] start in Genesis and preach one God
[1:16:38] again all the way
[1:16:43] down do you believe God died in your
[1:16:48] place see there's no reason to talking
[1:16:50] about how the the next one that we could
[1:16:52] we could be as righteous as he is
[1:16:55] that's why I moved it around see instead
[1:16:57] ofing Jehovah gyus and then Jehovah RFI
[1:16:59] and all the way gen is used that's why I
[1:17:02] moved it because I wanted it moved out
[1:17:03] way how can he be Jehovah just can you
[1:17:06] our righteousness if he wasn't righteous
[1:17:09] himself
[1:17:13] right now brother randam said if Jesus
[1:17:16] wasn't
[1:17:19] God he said he was the biggest deceiver
[1:17:23] that ever been
[1:17:26] right but yet do we still toy in our
[1:17:28] minds any thought or concept whatsoever
[1:17:32] of mankind that would make him anything
[1:17:35] other than God
[1:17:42] himself well you can't see God I'm glad
[1:17:46] you
[1:17:50] thinking but the man that stood here on
[1:17:53] the shores of Galilee said if you seen
[1:17:57] me you seen the father
[1:18:00] am remember the lady that was really
[1:18:02] good to brother Bram talking you know
[1:18:05] but brother
[1:18:06] Brandon that's like a husband and his
[1:18:10] wife because you're
[1:18:12] one he said not that kind of
[1:18:18] one she said pardon he said do you see
[1:18:22] me she said yes he said do you see my
[1:18:25] wife she no he said then it's not the
[1:18:30] same kind cuz Jesus said if you seen me
[1:18:32] you've seen the
[1:18:36] father if he wasn't our
[1:18:41] sacrifice then surely were not even no
[1:18:44] concept or thought could be made of
[1:18:46] anything about being righteous
[1:18:50] right we're found in our
[1:18:53] sins needing a savior if that was not
[1:18:56] almighty God that died on
[1:18:59] Calvary yeah but I just don't understand
[1:19:02] how he could die how can you
[1:19:08] die come on how can you
[1:19:12] die I mean you sit right there and say
[1:19:14] BL and
[1:19:16] die now you being silly no I'm not being
[1:19:18] silly tell the truth let's see you
[1:19:23] die we'll try pray for you to be raised
[1:19:26] if you don't we take you an
[1:19:28] Undertaker well now you ought not be
[1:19:29] sarcas I'm not sarcastic I'm telling the
[1:19:31] truth you can't die right I could take a
[1:19:36] gun and or a knife or something and cut
[1:19:38] your head slap off of you and I could
[1:19:40] not they call it killing you that that's
[1:19:43] all right cuz that's human
[1:19:45] words but God's the only one that can
[1:19:47] take your life
[1:19:51] that's right
[1:19:54] God was the only one that could die
[1:19:59] right one man could die for another and
[1:20:03] plenty of men have done it that told
[1:20:05] stories of how somebody you know in the
[1:20:07] militaries and the things and and
[1:20:09] somebody threw a hand grenade and the
[1:20:11] guy just jump on that and just blow him
[1:20:13] all to pieces when he know it was going
[1:20:14] to kill him and died for other people to
[1:20:17] save a company or whatever and that's
[1:20:19] that's
[1:20:23] great but this man didn't just fall on a
[1:20:25] hand grenade to try to keep somebody
[1:20:27] being killed
[1:20:29] right this man took sin that I'm talking
[1:20:32] about it he nailed it to the Cross
[1:20:36] amen he became
[1:20:39] sin for me he didn't have any sin he
[1:20:43] became sin for me that I might become as
[1:20:46] righteous as he is there's no need to
[1:20:48] talking about
[1:20:50] righteousness and that goes to show that
[1:20:53] what the prophet said there in the
[1:20:54] church age
[1:20:55] book he said the revelation of it is
[1:20:58] missing to most people what that we're
[1:21:00] just as righteous as God is by the new
[1:21:03] birth amen he said it's missing with
[1:21:07] that's
[1:21:08] you I agree with it what do you
[1:21:12] agree oh some days I read and I'm
[1:21:15] feeling pretty good I'm doing all right
[1:21:17] I look at the word and I say you know
[1:21:18] Lord I'm just as righteous as you
[1:21:22] are about 30 minutes later I'm in I'm
[1:21:25] the biggest sinner there is in the
[1:21:28] world because that's what I'm thinking
[1:21:30] in my own
[1:21:35] mind cuz see we got to get it
[1:21:38] straight but the main thing to get
[1:21:40] straight is who is our
[1:21:42] sacrifice if that was a
[1:21:45] man and that's all he was with just a
[1:21:48] man that died at
[1:21:51] Calvary then you and I are lost that's
[1:21:54] right
[1:21:58] going to
[1:22:00] remember this one that dies must be
[1:22:03] able to not only pay the
[1:22:08] price right right but he must be able to
[1:22:12] come back
[1:22:15] in the person that he died
[1:22:20] for now I ought to do away with all this
[1:22:22] about the body of Jesus
[1:22:30] I'm not against those Brothers I'm
[1:22:31] against what they preach yeah well they
[1:22:33] don't agree with it but you know what
[1:22:34] they're trying it is just it still ain't
[1:22:37] just a a bunch of people just six and
[1:22:39] seven and trying to preach good
[1:22:41] something to make you feel good and and
[1:22:42] tell you all this that and the other at
[1:22:44] least these other brothers is trying to
[1:22:45] preach something right I got more
[1:22:49] respect for them than I have for the
[1:22:50] biggest portion of the people of the
[1:22:52] mess because at least they're trying
[1:22:55] I don't agree with it it ain't right but
[1:22:57] they're doing better than the others you
[1:22:59] understand what I mean
[1:23:02] yes cuz this thing is not being good and
[1:23:05] going to church
[1:23:08] right this thing is you and I going to
[1:23:10] walk off this Earth one day or we're
[1:23:12] going by the
[1:23:20] grave but you see it's what our minds we
[1:23:23] get in them and what do we think in our
[1:23:26] human mind our capacities of our
[1:23:28] mind I was laughing yesterday telling
[1:23:31] them something thing about it was
[1:23:33] Brother Ray about think coming back last
[1:23:37] night you know I I say something here
[1:23:39] about you know people sleeping and I
[1:23:42] know that's a problem and I have a
[1:23:43] problem
[1:23:45] too but you know what I say like this is
[1:23:48] you know I say to you say well why not
[1:23:50] between services today go lay down and
[1:23:52] take your nap
[1:23:56] and then you won't have no trouble in
[1:23:57] the evening service cuz that's what I
[1:24:01] do whether I'm preaching or not I try to
[1:24:03] sneak off and get me a little nap you
[1:24:06] know but brother Dale if I took a nap in
[1:24:09] the middle of the
[1:24:13] day I wouldn't be able to sleep
[1:24:18] tonight I'm mean I
[1:24:22] know I know I'm mean is right s but the
[1:24:26] point's there you sat here and sleep do
[1:24:30] you stay awake at night after sleeping
[1:24:36] here come on folks amen so don't tell me
[1:24:40] that you know I can't take a nap in the
[1:24:42] middle of the day you take a nap at
[1:24:45] church is that a different
[1:24:48] something
[1:24:51] you okay
[1:24:54] but who is your
[1:24:57] sacrifice don't worry about who your
[1:24:59] righteousness is cu you can't understand
[1:25:01] it that's what we don't
[1:25:05] understand we want to jump from Jehovah
[1:25:07] Gyra to jeh Jehovah RFA we don't want to
[1:25:10] go through the
[1:25:11] other to get into the situation of
[1:25:14] understanding what they mean and how
[1:25:16] their relationship to us
[1:25:20] Abraham when he said the name of this
[1:25:23] place is Jehovah
[1:25:27] Gyra he was saying in relationship to me
[1:25:31] they was a God that created a lamb
[1:25:35] because you know the story 25 miles back
[1:25:38] over the mountains and all up in the
[1:25:39] hills why didn't the animals eat him up
[1:25:41] you you heard the message of the
[1:25:45] prophet he said God created a
[1:25:51] lamb Jehovah created a lamb
[1:25:54] to take the
[1:25:56] place not of
[1:26:00] Abraham he created a lamb to take the
[1:26:03] place of
[1:26:05] Isaac so he says the Lord Jehovah sees
[1:26:08] Jehovah sees he sees down he realizes
[1:26:11] there's a need and he comes
[1:26:14] down and he
[1:26:17] creates because only God can
[1:26:20] create so he creates a land
[1:26:25] but that was only speaking of Jesus
[1:26:31] Christ see God just didn't come down in
[1:26:34] the last in their days after you know
[1:26:36] the prophets and all and create a
[1:26:41] lamb he came
[1:26:45] himself he came
[1:26:49] himself this is not a good luck story or
[1:26:52] a bedtime story
[1:26:58] this is the gospel
[1:27:02] truth if your God didn't die on Calvary
[1:27:05] then you're not saved right right that's
[1:27:08] just sensible as can be but you don't
[1:27:10] understand I know I don't
[1:27:13] understand brother BR said that's why
[1:27:15] they come up with this great big God in
[1:27:18] three persons Blessed Trinity he said
[1:27:20] just don't you just don't he said I know
[1:27:22] I don't understand
[1:27:25] I don't understand how they could be
[1:27:27] that
[1:27:32] right but you
[1:27:34] see Jehovah Gyra doesn't
[1:27:39] mean that God sent somebody
[1:27:43] else Jehovah jyra means god stood there
[1:27:48] before Abraham and spoke that
[1:27:52] lamb where would have not have been
[1:27:53] called Jehovah
[1:27:56] J he spoke that lamb into
[1:27:59] existence
[1:28:06] right what about The Real
[1:28:10] L what about the lamb that takes away
[1:28:13] the sin of the
[1:28:17] world what about the one that provided
[1:28:21] way what about the one who died
[1:28:27] have you ever thanked God for dying for
[1:28:29] you have you ever done I mean just thank
[1:28:32] him for dying for
[1:28:34] you well you see why that they come up
[1:28:36] with all these other doctrines and it
[1:28:38] makes it so
[1:28:41] sweet my God didn't
[1:28:45] die oh it just makes it so sweet of a
[1:28:50] story that's what gets me about all of
[1:28:53] us you you can talk about Jesus dying on
[1:28:56] the cross and you can preach to the
[1:28:58] congregation and all the things and tell
[1:29:01] all about the what happened and how he
[1:29:03] was beat and how he was done people just
[1:29:05] sit there and look at and go
[1:29:06] sleep would you start talking about
[1:29:09] brother random and how his wife died and
[1:29:11] his baby died and people just cry all
[1:29:14] over the
[1:29:16] building I'm I'm not throwing off on
[1:29:18] that I cried
[1:29:20] too I'm just telling it like it is
[1:29:24] we put more value our thought
[1:29:26] emotionalism reaches us quicker of the
[1:29:29] things brother Bram tells than it does
[1:29:31] about what Jesus
[1:29:41] done but who is our Jehovah
[1:29:48] JRA if it's not God
[1:29:51] himself then we're left in our sins
[1:29:59] right who come down in my place God
[1:30:05] did not another
[1:30:10] person that's why I said if we don't go
[1:30:12] to the Jehovah
[1:30:15] righteousness you know our
[1:30:19] righteousness why because we can't
[1:30:21] understand Jehovah
[1:30:25] listen folks I'll run this on back go on
[1:30:27] your computer and run into the seven
[1:30:29] compound names of Jehovah and then go
[1:30:31] down the line and just keep reading the
[1:30:33] commentaries and the the
[1:30:36] things you see Jehovah means that's why
[1:30:40] it was only used there it wasn't used in
[1:30:42] Genesis 1 the word God was used in
[1:30:46] Genesis 1 which means Elohim
[1:30:49] self-existing Jehovah means like a
[1:30:52] father with his family and and he's
[1:30:54] bringing his name down to his family
[1:30:56] because the family has to have the same
[1:30:58] name but when it was first brought out
[1:31:01] it was jvh V I know you use it sometime
[1:31:05] jvh U and it be different word but just
[1:31:09] remember one
[1:31:11] thing there was no vowels in it so they
[1:31:14] had to add the vowels to make it come
[1:31:17] out to be
[1:31:22] Jehovah if you read read the story they
[1:31:24] have now it's on the internet if you
[1:31:26] want to go on and read it where that
[1:31:27] this uh Jewish
[1:31:30] rabbi was
[1:31:32] dying and for years before he died he
[1:31:37] began to preach that the name of God was
[1:31:47] Jesus I going there very
[1:31:49] little but when I see something like
[1:31:51] that it interests me of course it goes
[1:31:54] back to Jehovah se you know but he was
[1:31:58] pronouncing his
[1:31:59] name and saying that was the name of the
[1:32:04] Messiah to leaving his own son said
[1:32:07] Daddy got into
[1:32:08] delusions but he sure did brag on his
[1:32:11] daddy he said Daddy saw visions and
[1:32:14] daddy talked to God
[1:32:18] personally he went along with all that
[1:32:20] but he couldn't go along with it and him
[1:32:23] having any connection to understanding
[1:32:25] the name of the Messiah would be
[1:32:30] Jesus but you know the old brother could
[1:32:32] have been broke right into something you
[1:32:36] know where you can see it see a lot of
[1:32:39] people don't understand about the
[1:32:40] Messiah to the Jews and thing you know
[1:32:42] that there was a 90y old man about 3 or
[1:32:44] 4 years ago up New York died and they
[1:32:46] believed he was the Messiah they had a
[1:32:48] group of them believe that that was the
[1:32:49] Messiah because they believe some of
[1:32:52] them believe that he's not coming back
[1:32:53] act like that that it just be an
[1:32:56] understanding comes to you of you know
[1:32:59] the Messiah but you know when things
[1:33:01] will take place but there's others
[1:33:03] believe that there will literally be a
[1:33:04] person stand out
[1:33:07] there and that'll be the
[1:33:10] Messiah but you see that's what I told
[1:33:12] Ruben when I was over there with him
[1:33:14] Brother Dean and US was out there with
[1:33:16] him and prayed for him when he had a
[1:33:17] rice on him he couldn't go to sleep at
[1:33:19] night I said
[1:33:22] Ruben you believe
[1:33:24] the messiah's coming he said yes
[1:33:26] sir I said we just believe the messiah's
[1:33:29] already
[1:33:31] come I said we both believe in the
[1:33:33] Messiah it's just a Bas as we believe
[1:33:35] he's already
[1:33:37] come you
[1:33:39] believe that he's coming and you telling
[1:33:42] us all about this one that we believe to
[1:33:44] be the Messiah he said yeah and you
[1:33:47] telling me that he existed yes
[1:33:51] sir I prove he existed
[1:33:56] said this Messiah told us this Jesus
[1:34:00] told us to lay hands on the sick and
[1:34:03] they'd recover you believe in praying
[1:34:06] don't you yes sir I said you mind if me
[1:34:09] and Brother Dean and I lay our hands on
[1:34:12] you he said no I wish you would he got
[1:34:15] up the next morning he didn't have no
[1:34:17] rash
[1:34:20] right see but you say well why didn't he
[1:34:23] believe it cuz his mind is blackened his
[1:34:25] heart is darkened he's not born again
[1:34:29] right that's right he's telling y'all
[1:34:31] about
[1:34:31] Jesus but he just doesn't have Jesus in
[1:34:34] his heart that's
[1:34:36] right his sacrifice did not become
[1:34:40] personal to
[1:34:42] him he still wants to go back and offer
[1:34:45] the
[1:34:47] lamb Because he believes he keeps
[1:34:49] offering the lamb and the and the Rams
[1:34:51] and the the red heer and everything
[1:34:54] right that the Messiah come well he's
[1:34:56] not looking for the Messiah to come and
[1:35:00] die they don't believe the Messiah is
[1:35:03] going to come and die no
[1:35:06] way but you see if the Messiah didn't
[1:35:08] come and die there is no salvation
[1:35:14] right what about Jehovah
[1:35:17] Gyra the Lord will provide
[1:35:22] himself and did provide himself for you
[1:35:25] and
[1:35:27] I that we might be
[1:35:31] saved no need of talking about being how
[1:35:34] that he is our righteousness or even
[1:35:36] speaking of righteousness until we
[1:35:38] understand who
[1:35:40] died because if it wasn't God we're not
[1:35:42] righteous it was just a man that died
[1:35:44] we're not
[1:35:49] righteous if that was just a man that
[1:35:51] died you're not not righteous there's no
[1:35:53] way
[1:35:55] brother R said it's impossible for one
[1:35:57] man to die for
[1:36:00] another well why don't you believe what
[1:36:03] he says well Brothers don't so makes it
[1:36:06] so sweet and wonderful
[1:36:09] okay but is it the
[1:36:12] truth will brother so and so stand up to
[1:36:15] the
[1:36:18] truth come and let's
[1:36:21] see let not being Circ itic nor hateful
[1:36:24] or nothing just being truth if I ain't
[1:36:27] right I want somebody to show
[1:36:30] me why because my life is at
[1:36:33] stake
[1:36:35] right and brother D you just won't
[1:36:40] listen will
[1:36:43] you I'm talking to Lula
[1:36:47] Georgia what's out there is anybody
[1:36:49] else's business I'm talking to you and
[1:36:51] me who is your
[1:36:59] sacrifice I want you to know that I
[1:37:02] believe and it's surely not one this
[1:37:05] because it took 4,000 years for him to
[1:37:08] get here and a lot of Jehovah jyra
[1:37:10] Jehovah kishu Jehovah arban Jehovah
[1:37:13] Shalom it took a lot of things being
[1:37:16] made manifest before he could step out
[1:37:18] there to be God in human flesh that's
[1:37:21] right so don't make me a
[1:37:25] Oneness I'm Oneness in true Oneness yes
[1:37:29] sir but not to denominational
[1:37:33] Oneness I believe in one true and living
[1:37:36] God
[1:37:37] Amen but oh if I had about two hours or
[1:37:41] three to preach on
[1:37:43] it cuz you know how I preach it now I
[1:37:46] believe
[1:37:48] it that's why they couldn't understand
[1:37:50] as we're bringing out the other day they
[1:37:52] couldn't understand Satan has never been
[1:37:54] understand how that Michael could step
[1:37:56] on the
[1:37:57] scene can't understand that he can't get
[1:38:00] that comprehended in his mind cuz he
[1:38:02] don't know where he come
[1:38:08] from he's standing there talking to the
[1:38:10] devil and now here
[1:38:14] goes a Halo of light the great son of
[1:38:19] the Living God the word of God and
[1:38:22] begins to say Let There Be
[1:38:24] you know what he looked like that was
[1:38:26] theophany you know what he looked
[1:38:29] like Jesus that stood on the shores of
[1:38:32] Galilee sir cuz that's who he
[1:38:35] was I really enjoyed that time the only
[1:38:37] time they allowed it cuz he wouldn't do
[1:38:39] it no more there at the The Passion Play
[1:38:42] when they had that about the creation of
[1:38:44] the world and they had the same man that
[1:38:46] played Jesus in the parts that came on
[1:38:48] and I thought I we said she that every
[1:38:50] time of course it didn't mean anything
[1:38:52] probably the 99% it was D but it did to
[1:38:55] me because dire he was and all at once
[1:38:58] here come a baby crying and then they
[1:39:00] showed him it coming up there he was a
[1:39:02] man same
[1:39:05] man that ain't Oneness see Oneness can't
[1:39:09] stand that God just moved over in
[1:39:12] another form and here stands God still
[1:39:14] talking to the devil right today he's up
[1:39:17] there talking to the devil but yet God's
[1:39:20] in your heart yes they can't understand
[1:39:22] that
[1:39:24] and there are all the fullness of the
[1:39:26] godhead B that dwell in Jesus Christ and
[1:39:28] the devil's still up here
[1:39:32] talking Heaven Wasn't emptied
[1:39:37] right see they don't understand the Son
[1:39:39] of
[1:39:41] God Where's God now I thought we were
[1:39:44] the children of God oh how you want to
[1:39:46] preach I thought we were the sons and
[1:39:49] daughters of God well then if we're the
[1:39:50] Sons and Daughters of God we God made
[1:39:52] manifest in another form Bri
[1:39:58] for I
[1:40:00] can't see there's no need to talk about
[1:40:02] Jehovah tishu which means he's our
[1:40:05] righteousness until we see that
[1:40:08] Jehovah of the old was Jesus of the
[1:40:14] new and how je Jehovah God dwelt on
[1:40:20] Earth in him that body standing there
[1:40:23] dwelt the fullness of the godhe bodily
[1:40:27] that's why I believe that when that baby
[1:40:28] was born his soul was the soul of God
[1:40:32] Amen his Spirit was the spirit of God
[1:40:35] Amen the body was just a creation
[1:40:38] right but you can't separate him no more
[1:40:41] once he created
[1:40:43] it cuz that's when he become Jehovah
[1:40:46] with his family like a father that's
[1:40:48] what Jehovah means like a father with
[1:40:50] his family
[1:40:53] that's when he really become
[1:40:56] that and could stand on this
[1:40:59] Earth and Proclaim unless you believe
[1:41:02] that I am he you will die in your
[1:41:07] sins oh but Brother D left what was in
[1:41:10] him come in him and then then left out
[1:41:11] of it what kind of a god do you
[1:41:15] have what kind of a comprehension of God
[1:41:18] do you
[1:41:20] have that he just comes into something
[1:41:23] uses it and goes out of it and don't use
[1:41:24] it no more what does he do with that
[1:41:27] that he don't
[1:41:30] use well brother Dale I'm glad you said
[1:41:32] that yeah I'm glad you thought it
[1:41:34] too cuz see brother brandom said when
[1:41:36] MDC came that God
[1:41:41] just and spoke a body into existence and
[1:41:44] stepped into it right he said but then
[1:41:48] he just and spoke it right back out of
[1:41:51] existence because we never never see Mel
[1:41:54] jezdic no more we see
[1:41:58] Jesus who is your
[1:42:04] sacrifice is he Jehovah
[1:42:09] jar then God himself amen came
[1:42:15] down to give us
[1:42:19] life it's the only way
[1:42:23] cuz when we get there I've preached it
[1:42:26] to you when we get there we're not going
[1:42:28] to see a Halo of light over here and
[1:42:30] something over here represent the the
[1:42:32] dove looking around you know
[1:42:34] and we going to see
[1:42:38] Jesus and we going to realize who he
[1:42:45] was think on these
[1:42:48] things there's no need to talk about
[1:42:50] Jehovah T can you our righteous until we
[1:42:53] see who our savior
[1:42:55] is because only our savior that can take
[1:42:58] our place can make us righteous you
[1:43:02] agree there's no way for us to be
[1:43:04] righteous that's right somebody's got to
[1:43:06] take our place will me to take your
[1:43:09] place won't make you righteous
[1:43:15] right come on
[1:43:17] Brothers think on these things
[1:43:24] he's Jehovah
[1:43:26] Gyra the Lord has
[1:43:29] provided a
[1:43:33] sacrifice and that sacrifice he provided
[1:43:36] was not just a one
[1:43:40] lamb all that just spoke of
[1:43:42] him but it was the one who stepped on
[1:43:45] this Earth 2,000 years ago that we call
[1:43:47] Jesus
[1:43:50] Christ and he could stand there and say
[1:43:53] I and my father are one that's certainly
[1:43:55] not Oneness is it but it's certainly not
[1:43:58] trinitarianism either because he was
[1:44:01] telling the
[1:44:06] truth and he can be in every one of us
[1:44:09] and still be up in heaven
[1:44:15] today
[1:44:17] right because he's
[1:44:20] Jehovah let's stand again what we got
[1:44:23] 669 is power 669 anybody have a
[1:44:28] need think of that one that you
[1:44:34] serve is he your savior after
[1:44:46] all
[1:44:48] lifted and we stand upon the
