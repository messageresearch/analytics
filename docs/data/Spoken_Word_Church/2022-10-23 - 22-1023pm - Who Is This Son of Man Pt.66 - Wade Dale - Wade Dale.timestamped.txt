[0:14] desire and I long to work worship thee

[0:28] [Applause]
[0:34] um
[0:35] can I give just a short testimony
[0:38] I know that you guys knew that I was
[0:42] going to have more scans done but I
[0:44] never really give a report on it but I
[0:47] just didn't ruin the same thing negative
[0:49] after the great news
[0:52] but then it dawned on me that this
[0:55] wasn't such bad news but when I went and
[0:58] and they called me in immediately back
[1:00] to from my house back up to the doctor's
[1:03] office said you got to Commitment you
[1:04] got blood clot in your lung
[1:06] so I went turns out I had little teeny
[1:10] tiny bits of blood clots in both lungs
[1:14] and that scared me but then um
[1:17] I thought you know that's that's just
[1:19] like God I mean that could be God
[1:21] breaking that cancer up what was left in
[1:25] in all they know it is that it's little
[1:29] blood clots
[1:30] you know and then and and it's just like
[1:33] God to have me come in so they could
[1:35] give me a blood thinner so those little
[1:37] blood clots wouldn't
[1:38] shoot through my heart and kill me you
[1:40] know so anyway I'm taking it as a
[1:43] positive that's what it is so I'm taking
[1:45] blood clot I mean I'm taking blood
[1:46] thinner
[1:50] in this song I'd like to dedicate to

[20:48] he going in the trunk you better put
[20:49] somebody small in that drunk
[20:52] you see those things now you know for
[20:53] about for Halloween they got the hands
[20:55] hanging out the trunk like somebody's in
[20:57] the back of it well his hands would

[21:29] second service we got Pastor
[21:30] appreciation month this month and we've

[21:34] again less as brother Louise said we
[21:37] sure appreciate this there's no way
[21:38] until we get to the to the streets of
[21:41] Glory
[21:42] how much an impact that this church has
[21:45] had through brotherdale through the in
[21:47] in the world
[21:48] in the world
[21:54] so you know sometimes we think you're
[21:57] you might be asleep and you're going to
[21:59] the land or not but somebody's in the
[22:01] promised land listening it may be that
[22:04] they're listening later on or uh or you
[22:07] know listening to different series but
[22:09] uh we appreciate that we appreciate the
[22:11] the brothers that did all the work for
[22:13] putting this thing together
[22:14] because at first if you'll know my pot
[22:17] was not for this internet business
[22:20] but I thank God God changed his mind
[22:23] amen and we did were able to put it out
[22:25] over the airwaves and and y'all just
[22:28] don't know how much it costs to do that
[22:29] it cost a lot and it cost a lot of the
[22:32] brothers
[22:34] um time
[22:35] to uh to put this together and to keep
[22:37] it going and to keep brother Joe you got
[22:39] you know you it's like working on cars
[22:41] just you there's always something
[22:42] tearing up
[22:43] and you gotta fix it I know all you that
[22:46] are in
[22:47] and computers know that it just don't
[22:49] when you mash the button it just don't
[22:50] always come on
[22:52] man so they have to fix and I don't know
[22:55] one thing's for sure if there's
[22:57] something happening and it's not going
[22:59] from here out somewhere else that phone
[23:00] starts ringing in the back
[23:02] immediately
[23:03] we can't get the unlined we can't hear a
[23:06] thing we can't see nothing
[23:07] so and then they have to go and scramble
[23:09] and try to get everything back together
[23:11] so we sure appreciate them but let's
[23:13] give them a big hand too
[23:17] all right November the 5th uh also no
[23:21] November the 5th there'll be no Bible
[23:22] study because we're going to have to
[23:24] come here and we're going to do
[23:26] excuse me we're going to get ready for
[23:28] the uh wedding we're doing a rehearsal
[23:30] here uh and so there won't be any Bible
[23:33] study also November the 6th will be the
[23:35] wedding for Lily and Zach
[23:38] and uh yes
[23:40] well anyway
[23:42] um yes
[23:44] but we're sure looking forward to it but
[23:47] now let me ask you a question
[23:48] that will mean we won't be able to take
[23:51] communion and foot washing that Sunday
[23:52] because we'll have one service and some
[23:55] of them won't be here they'll be over
[23:57] there getting everything ready which is
[23:58] fine and we won't be able to have
[24:01] communion and foot washing that Sunday
[24:03] we won't be able to have it that next
[24:05] Sunday because that's the Thanksgiving
[24:07] dinner we'll only have one service the
[24:10] next weekend Orlando Glover will be here
[24:12] and we won't be able to have it then we
[24:14] might we could be able to have the last
[24:16] of November but
[24:18] why don't we have it and then in
[24:20] December
[24:22] we got the church thing on the fourth so
[24:24] that's gonna We're not gonna be able to
[24:25] take communion for a couple of months so
[24:27] why don't we yeah I said the same thing
[24:30] and brother Bob came up with a good idea
[24:31] we're just going to take it next Sunday
[24:34] end of the month which would be the 29th
[24:36] that'll be for November so we're going
[24:39] to take communion foot washing next
[24:40] Sunday I know some of you won't be here
[24:42] but that's okay but next Sunday we'll do
[24:44] communion and foot washing and that will
[24:46] be for November and then we'll try to
[24:48] figure out December if we can but a lot
[24:50] of times we don't in December because of
[24:52] all the things that goes on so is that
[24:54] okay with everybody we'll have it next
[24:55] Sunday
[24:56] okay I don't want to do it without it
[24:58] two months in a row y'all be all kind of
[25:00] backslid
[25:02] when I say y'all I mean me too
[25:05] okay it's it's y'all and all all y'all
[25:09] amen
[25:11] I told Brother
[25:13] um I told Sister Janet yesterday we were
[25:15] talking about brother Mike I said look
[25:16] he's getting the best prayer and the
[25:18] best care
[25:20] so he can't lose
[25:23] like I said before he's people praying
[25:24] around the world Chris long I called to
[25:27] tell him about it and somebody already
[25:28] called him from the Ukraine right in the
[25:31] middle of a battle over there they're
[25:32] fighting Russians and somebody had
[25:33] enough to to hear what was going on and
[25:36] call brother Chris because they had just
[25:38] went over there to Norway and they knew
[25:41] who brother Chris was and they called
[25:42] him and told him about it so you just
[25:44] never know this this thing that we call
[25:46] a world wide web I like the one we have
[25:50] I don't care about that one but you got
[25:52] to use the devil's equipment every once
[25:53] in a while to get the uh to get the
[25:56] message out and to get messages out for
[25:58] people to start praying amen so we'll
[26:01] have communion foot washing next Sunday

[29:07] hearts that we'll hear from you Lord may

[29:54] furtherness of this service we love you
[29:55] and we thank you for all things thank
[29:57] you for our pastor Lord they will give
[29:58] him a little bit time today but as he's
[30:00] always said
[30:02] the greatest gift we could give him is
[30:03] to live what he preaches and Lord I pray
[30:06] that we do that father that we live up
[30:07] to that expectation Lord and that you
[30:10] will be the one that gets to praise and
[30:11] honor and glory in Jesus name we pray
[30:13] amen
[30:16] part 66 in the beginning was the word
[30:18] the words with God and the Word was God
[30:20] and look the word was made flesh and
[30:22] dwelt among us and we behold his glory
[30:25] we're beholding now his glory
[30:28] you and I are as victory you and I are
[30:31] his glory because we are now the word
[30:34] made Flesh on the earth amen and we
[30:38] behold his glory the glory the only
[30:39] begotten of the father full of grace
[30:42] and Truth first Thessalonians says that
[30:44] every one of you should know how to
[30:45] possess that's our whole thing we're
[30:46] trying to get where we're listen where
[30:48] are you possessed at where do you where
[30:50] does it begin where did Eve get
[30:52] possessed first in her mind
[30:54] right
[30:55] Satan took over her psyche her memories
[30:58] and conscious effects imagine that he
[31:00] took that over first and then the act
[31:02] happened and that's the way me and you
[31:04] everything's got to be run through our
[31:05] brain first
[31:07] then we react according to that all
[31:10] right if you've got something down in
[31:12] here to control you you know what it's
[31:13] going to do it's going to try to turn
[31:14] you I said try to turn you to God
[31:17] but if you have nothing down here you're
[31:19] going to the world every time all right
[31:21] that's why the world is insane you may
[31:23] be saying the Lord has blessing to the
[31:24] word that's why the world is insane it
[31:27] doesn't think the way we think it
[31:29] doesn't act the way we act and Bella
[31:31] since you've come up here I'm going to
[31:32] let you give these out in case that she
[31:34] didn't want to do it anymore
[31:40] she said don't call me today
[31:42] okay
[31:44] what's your face red for
[31:48] hmm
[31:49] yeah I know it's okay there's 50 of
[31:52] those so maybe it's some and we'll look
[31:54] at them a little bit later but give one
[31:55] to
[31:56] everybody that wants one if we have to
[31:59] have any more we'll get them but I want
[32:01] us to realize you say well why are you I
[32:03] told Bob I said I can't get off the
[32:05] foundation because something something's
[32:07] got to change us
[32:10] even us that's been in the message for
[32:12] 50 years something's got to change us a
[32:15] little bit closer to gun now where does
[32:17] it start you've already had the change
[32:19] in your soul if you're born again
[32:22] if you're not you're going to do the
[32:23] world the things of the world I'm sorry
[32:25] that's just the way it is amen
[32:28] but those of us that are born again
[32:31] those of us that have the seed of God or
[32:34] the word of God planted in our heart and
[32:36] it is quickened then we should be able
[32:38] to what conform
[32:42] or transform be transformed by the
[32:46] renewing of our mind now what is the
[32:48] renewing of your mind you thought this
[32:50] way right here and now you got to think
[32:52] this way over here
[32:54] and I was thinking yesterday or coming
[32:56] back home
[32:57] I was thinking about you know people
[33:00] people are uh we everybody wants
[33:04] a soft nest
[33:06] every don't don't tell me no I want it
[33:10] rough I want it just rough I don't want
[33:12] no electricity I don't want I gotta eat
[33:15] eat rats and sticks and you know put
[33:17] sticks on a fire that's what I want no
[33:20] you don't
[33:21] you want doordash
[33:24] bring it to me
[33:26] right that's what we want because we
[33:29] want we're lay out of sins we want the
[33:31] easy way out but listen
[33:33] there God stood himself
[33:37] in
[33:39] a body of Flesh
[33:41] no different than me and you except not
[33:43] by carnal
[33:45] sex by sex you know he comes he comes
[33:48] spoken word but he had a body just like
[33:49] me and you had to wash it you had to
[33:51] feed it
[33:52] and you know who gave him the worst
[33:54] problem
[33:56] the religious people
[33:58] gave him the worst problems
[34:01] and you know what he didn't mind he
[34:03] didn't mind getting in their pulpit
[34:06] come on somebody and call him snakes
[34:10] called them vipers and said your daddy
[34:12] is not my daddy so he separated them now
[34:16] the Sinners and the ones and the lady
[34:18] that washed his feet and all these
[34:19] different ones they loved him
[34:21] why because he was bringing something
[34:22] new something that was renewing
[34:25] the way they had thought before and now
[34:27] they're thinking a different way the
[34:28] Pharisees didn't want to think a
[34:30] different way we've got Moses we can
[34:34] quote him from cover to cover
[34:36] we got 1100 sermons we can quote it from
[34:39] cover to cover listen most of the time
[34:41] you only quote what you like
[34:44] if it bothers you you kind of do like um
[34:47] brother Tatum said Acts 2 38 it kind of
[34:49] bothered him so he got to flip through
[34:50] it real quick
[34:52] you know he'd read the Bible and he'd
[34:53] read Matthew 28 19 baptized follow us on
[34:56] Holy Ghost and when he gets when he get
[34:58] to Acts 2 38 he said I'd read it read it
[35:00] and he said I'd flip over that one
[35:03] because it condemned him he didn't know
[35:06] how to handle it but you and I now we
[35:08] know how to handle it the world don't
[35:09] know how to handle these things
[35:11] psychology whatever you want to call it
[35:13] the world is tuned totally different
[35:16] than what the son of man was when he was
[35:18] on the earth there was nobody agreed
[35:20] with him in the Christian World nobody
[35:23] if you might want to call them
[35:24] Christians then I guess you you probably
[35:26] couldn't but they were they were
[35:28] Orthodox Jews they were somebody that
[35:30] knew the Torah lived the Torah hey Rich
[35:32] Young Ruler
[35:36] couldn't find one mark
[35:38] not one mark
[35:40] well Jesus found the one
[35:43] sell everything
[35:44] in other words my mind and somebody was
[35:48] reading it the other day
[35:50] well you know what he did when he left
[35:52] there he built more barns
[35:56] he got more wealth and then all of a
[35:58] sudden he died
[36:00] and his soul was required of him that
[36:03] day didn't matter that he had a brand
[36:05] new barn that might have had a brand new
[36:07] Cadillac didn't matter if he had a brand
[36:08] new house
[36:09] hello somebody didn't matter about that
[36:12] but the requirement was when he met the
[36:14] word he couldn't go now he could do 99
[36:16] of it right man amen amen
[36:20] Jesus kept going through and he kept
[36:22] saying done all that for my youth
[36:26] I know every quote in this in the
[36:28] sailboat the church book
[36:31] I go to so-and-so's church hello Church
[36:36] can you do one more thing for me
[36:39] can you sell everything you got
[36:42] and follow me
[36:44] he couldn't pick that cross up he could
[36:47] he could look at that man and say I know
[36:48] you're this and I know you're that I you
[36:50] know like the we're reading a little
[36:52] while the Centurion he knew this he was
[36:54] a man of power but he didn't want to
[36:56] connect himself to that
[36:58] now I'm going to go build some more
[37:00] barns I'm just gonna go get some more
[37:02] wealth well then his soul was required
[37:04] of him because he didn't have a renewing
[37:07] of his mind continual to make what to
[37:10] make his path Jesus said sell everything
[37:13] you got in what follow me
[37:16] come with me take up your cross as we've
[37:19] been reading take up your cross and
[37:21] follow me is that what we're doing or
[37:23] are we sitting in a message Church
[37:24] saying I've got tenure
[37:27] I've been here longer than you so you
[37:29] ain't got to tell me what to do I've
[37:31] been here longer than you
[37:34] no
[37:35] is how much you got packed in
[37:39] not how much you can quote
[37:42] but what renews our mind is is totally
[37:45] different from the world and listen
[37:47] 50 of the people in the message
[37:50] nah seventy percent of the people in the
[37:53] message nah ninety percent of the people
[37:55] in the message
[37:58] listen if you're not born again the best
[38:00] you can do is be foolish virgin
[38:02] the best you can do
[38:06] then you got to die you got to go
[38:07] through the tribulation you got to come
[38:08] up and on judgment and be given
[38:11] account of what you do I don't want to
[38:12] do that I want to pass Jesus said I want
[38:14] you to pass from Death unto life I want
[38:16] you to get past all that yeah you do get
[38:19] a free pass everybody like playing
[38:21] Monopoly and remember the Monopoly you
[38:22] like to you love that you hated getting
[38:24] on go to jail
[38:27] right right
[38:29] then you get that little card says pass
[38:30] go collect 200 everybody wanted that one
[38:33] well if you'll get born again today you
[38:35] can pass all that junk you're not gonna
[38:37] get 200 but you're gonna be what
[38:39] Priceless yeah
[38:41] 10 000 worlds
[38:44] with one Soul saved
[38:46] so we've got to see that our mind we've
[38:48] got to ratchet it up just a little bit
[38:50] more you should not have to wonder you
[38:53] should not be double-minded we're going
[38:54] to read it here in a few minutes where
[38:56] you're wavering or uncertain or doubting
[38:58] or divided in interest you should say
[39:01] this is true this truth has been
[39:04] preached to me this is the way it is
[39:05] this is the way I believe it I may not
[39:08] understand it right now
[39:10] come on
[39:12] but I know where the fountain is
[39:16] I can get it from the fountain
[39:20] renew our mind
[39:22] that you may what prove you're going to
[39:24] prove to the devil that you can do it
[39:27] you are
[39:29] it's true you but you're going that's
[39:30] why
[39:34] if he rose from the grave and just said
[39:36] hey this I'm it
[39:38] this is all I got
[39:40] no he was just the beginning of it
[39:42] we're the continuation of that creation
[39:45] we're a continuation to go ahead to the
[39:47] body change
[39:49] can your mind handle that
[39:52] your heart can
[39:53] listen if you're born again today you're
[39:56] already changed
[39:58] you already started your change but
[40:01] that's going to carry you even if you
[40:02] have to go by the grave it's going to
[40:03] carry you to a body change but if you're
[40:05] not born again it's not
[40:08] right but we which are alive and remain
[40:10] has to come to a place
[40:12] to where we have to look at death and
[40:15] not just fool it but destroy it
[40:17] [Applause]
[40:18] you know you know people trying to fool
[40:20] death
[40:22] I'm gonna get in trouble here
[40:24] hair color
[40:25] go to the plastic surgeon
[40:31] take a pill
[40:33] somebody find that pill for me please
[40:35] [Laughter]
[40:38] I'll be 63 in a couple of months
[40:43] I know some of y'all are older but a lot
[40:44] of y'all are younger
[40:47] and I'm telling you
[40:49] these bodies I I don't think I'd want to
[40:52] live to be 900 years old
[40:55] even 200.
[40:57] ah not in not in the condition
[41:00] but listen we're heading toward eternal
[41:03] life that body change is not going to be
[41:05] listen
[41:07] um
[41:07] sorry elazarus got a temporary body
[41:11] change Abraham got a temporary body
[41:13] change but when our body has changed
[41:15] that's an eternal body change
[41:18] we're heading towards something Eternal
[41:19] not something temporary this is all
[41:22] temporary everything you see is
[41:23] temporary
[41:25] yeah
[41:28] Luke 8 verse 45 Jesus said who touched
[41:31] me when they all denied Peter said they
[41:33] were to him Master the multitude
[41:35] strongly impress thee and say and you
[41:37] said who touched me Jesus said somebody
[41:39] have touched me for I perceive that what
[41:41] virtue is gone out from me
[41:44] Matthew 8 verse 5 when Jesus was entered
[41:47] in Capernaum that came unto him a
[41:48] centurion beseeching him saying Lord my
[41:51] servant lies at home sick of the palsy
[41:52] grievously tormented him Jesus said unto
[41:55] him I'll come and heal him in other
[41:57] words he said I I
[41:59] I'm gonna go Centurion said no
[42:03] uh
[42:04] Lord I am not worthy that thou should
[42:06] come under my roof but speak the word
[42:08] only
[42:09] speak the word only
[42:12] look and he said maybe my servant shall
[42:15] be healed
[42:16] what'd he say and my servant shall be
[42:20] healed
[42:21] there was the faith that touched Jesus
[42:24] because Jesus said after that we'll read
[42:26] it maybe later on where Jesus said I
[42:28] have found no greater faith in Israel
[42:29] because all Israel wanted him to touch
[42:30] him
[42:32] Darius said come and touch my daughter
[42:34] then when he went in there they laughed
[42:36] him to score and you know remember he
[42:37] had to put them people out of the room
[42:38] before he could raise her from the dead
[42:42] first thing we got to do is be born
[42:43] again
[42:44] we got to leave the principal of the
[42:45] doctor listen our mind is not just got
[42:47] to be I got I'm going to come to church
[42:49] and I'm going to hear a a live good
[42:51] sermon
[42:53] you can get that and on the internet
[42:55] outside somewhere
[42:56] Joel Osteen go listen to him he don't
[42:58] preach on sin he preached on Happy stuff
[43:01] just be happy everything happy you get
[43:03] you know you get rich make sure you send
[43:06] it part of it to me but you get rich and
[43:09] you know I got to get a bigger airplane
[43:10] to get to my people faster you know and
[43:13] foreign
[43:14] and what are they looking for
[43:17] I'm telling you people
[43:19] as we come closer to this end time
[43:21] they're going to fill the pool just like
[43:24] we feel the pull because it's a
[43:25] spiritual pull
[43:27] now they're not going to be inside the
[43:29] part that you and I are because we have
[43:31] the word unadulterated word but they
[43:34] filled the pull of that anointing of the
[43:36] end time I know anyone's attend time
[43:38] that's the real pull of God or the real
[43:40] anointing of God on a group of false
[43:43] people
[43:45] wow
[43:46] so this is why we need Apostles prophets
[43:49] not not false ones not false prophets
[43:52] not false evangelists or false pastors
[43:54] or teachers we need the truth so if
[43:56] there's a false brother Michael there's
[43:57] got to be a true got to be you need to
[44:02] find it if you don't know where it's at
[44:05] for the perfecting of what you yes for
[44:08] the Perfection of you
[44:10] make it are you an auto saint
[44:13] you're either saying or hate
[44:15] and my brother random said he says do
[44:17] you know like a saint to me so like I
[44:18] ain't
[44:19] brother Brown didn't mind cutting you
[44:21] through the core did he he said he told
[44:24] that guy that what his wife looked like
[44:26] he said I don't think she's a saint
[44:27] brother I think she's a hank had all
[44:30] that pain on her face and stuff
[44:32] look
[44:33] we all come to the unity of the faith so
[44:35] don't worry we'll go get Unity of faith
[44:37] is to bring that five-fold Ministry in
[44:38] and let him help us up the statue of
[44:40] perfect man amen we're not going to get
[44:42] it any other way all right
[44:46] and you listen you've got to have
[44:49] confidence

[44:54] in brother Bob brother Aaron bro Louise
[44:56] myself brother Dale

[46:35] were moved by the Holy Spirit In other
[46:36] words to write the Bible she was wanting
[46:38] to know where that's at well now she
[46:39] didn't go down here to Dollar General
[46:41] and asked the manager over there
[46:46] he probably said or she would have
[46:48] probably said what are you talking about
[46:50] I can sell you groceries and and air
[46:53] suppressioners and toilet paper but I
[46:56] don't know what you're talking about she
[46:58] went to the source
[47:00] that she knew she could draw something
[47:02] from that's what we're going to get to
[47:03] when we get to Virtue when we ever get
[47:05] there
[47:06] let's just continue and get a strong
[47:08] Foundation First if we got a strong
[47:11] Foundation that we can what we can what
[47:13] live that Son of God Revelation or what
[47:17] being come to a higher level of
[47:19] sanctification because what happens is
[47:22] we're looking at virtue that the world
[47:24] sees and virtue that that we see then
[47:27] you're looking at knowledge which is
[47:28] worldly knowledge over here
[47:30] we don't want any of that worldly
[47:32] knowledge we got to have an education
[47:33] don't you ever forget that you need an
[47:35] education
[47:36] you need to go to school
[47:38] you need to learn get a diploma
[47:40] because in this world you got to have
[47:42] one to succeed all right
[47:44] but let's don't lay it over here and say
[47:46] well I've got two degrees and so and so
[47:49] so I don't have to go to church no more
[47:53] okay that's it then let's go over here
[47:57] I'm gaining Heavenly knowledge when I go
[47:59] to church
[48:01] and I listen to the word of God I'm
[48:02] gaining heavily knowledge which is what
[48:04] Eternal this is temporary this is
[48:07] eternal
[48:09] have you ever thought about this
[48:11] you know the things that bothers you
[48:14] so much the trials and tribulations as
[48:17] I've talked about a little bit this
[48:19] morning like with brother Mike the wreck
[48:21] and all and all the things that went you
[48:23] went through in your life all those
[48:25] things that you went through
[48:27] are going fade away one day
[48:31] I don't make you really happy
[48:33] all your struggles trials tribulations
[48:36] we can't even really fathom it by our
[48:39] human mind
[48:40] because what happens remember our memory
[48:43] takes us back to it
[48:45] and there's a scar left somewhere
[48:47] because we did so and so and so and so
[48:49] on such and such but if you're a
[48:50] born-again Christian today that will go
[48:53] away the former things will pass away
[48:56] behold yes behold
[48:59] all things have become new
[49:01] behold there'll be no cancer in heaven
[49:04] behold there'll be no scars in heaven
[49:06] behold there'll be no nervousness in
[49:08] heaven
[49:09] why can't we have a little of it now
[49:11] because I thought Heaven I thought we
[49:12] were in Heavenly places right here hey
[49:14] man
[49:17] and I want the world to think we're
[49:18] crazy
[49:20] they thought Jesus was crazy they called
[49:23] him not just the devil they called him
[49:24] the prince of devils
[49:28] but he was God
[49:30] he was more God than me than you are
[49:33] and the world just despised him
[49:36] so well they despise you when we come to
[49:38] this Capstone the son of man Revelation
[49:41] is going to make us different
[49:45] brother random said when no sales open
[49:47] think about it
[49:50] you take brother Branham he had preached
[49:53] in the 50s and all the way up to 1962 he
[49:56] had read the scripture on Revelations uh
[49:59] 6 verse 1.
[50:04] right
[50:05] horse
[50:07] my horse went riding out with a bow
[50:10] conquering him to conquer he preached
[50:11] the mighty conqueror
[50:22] when it was the devil the whole time
[50:25] yeah he had come to a place though where
[50:29] the son of man Revelation had to take
[50:31] over
[50:31] when the seals open that's why he said
[50:34] it become a brand new book that's why he
[50:35] said thousands of my friends were what
[50:38] go away from me because what thousands
[50:41] of Jesus's friends went away from him
[50:43] when he said I am my father are one
[50:46] when he come to Matthew 24 and he said
[50:48] there'll be perilous times you're going
[50:49] to be what there'll be false Christ
[50:51] you're going to try they're going to try
[50:53] to deceive you they're going to try to
[50:54] deceive the very elective possible
[50:57] and they didn't like him for that
[51:00] that's when they killed him remember
[51:01] after Matthew 24 is when they put him on
[51:03] the cross
[51:06] so the son of man Revelation but look we
[51:07] got to get this Revelation first we've
[51:10] got to get so Sanctified that God has
[51:12] pulled all that junk out of us and that
[51:14] we got to what have Godly virtue Godly
[51:16] knowledge Godly tempers Godly patience
[51:18] brotherly kindness and all those
[51:20] different things
[51:21] we got to come to it yes help us that's
[51:23] what I want to do I want it to help us
[51:24] yes
[51:26] um
[51:27] for soul is the will of God that we're
[51:28] doing well doing you may put to silence
[51:31] listen the only way you're going how did
[51:33] Jesus put him to silence how did Jesus
[51:35] put the devil to silence the devil takes
[51:37] him up on a a pinnacle of the church
[51:41] I'll tell you something right there
[51:43] Satan was comfortable in church
[51:46] hello somebody
[51:48] he took him up on the pentacle of the
[51:50] temple yeah right and he showed him all
[51:52] this and said this is all yours if
[51:54] you'll worship me Jesus said Thou shalt
[51:56] not tempt the Lord thy God
[51:59] and then he said
[52:01] the last thing and Satan had to leave
[52:03] him what it wasn't that he formed this
[52:05] great miracle or pull this great ball of
[52:07] Fire
[52:09] now he just quoted him the word
[52:13] correct because he was the word
[52:16] you said well I don't get nothing when I
[52:18] quote the word
[52:19] try to become it
[52:21] know that you're the word first if you
[52:23] know you're the word first then that
[52:25] helps a lot amen
[52:28] we've got to know folks that we know
[52:30] that we know
[52:31] amen because we can and will be deceived
[52:35] if we're not born again
[52:38] we will be deceived there is no other
[52:39] way there is no in between you're either
[52:41] true or false I hope we get that in our
[52:44] heart
[52:45] but when it comes to The Showdown are
[52:47] you able to possess the things that you
[52:49] profess to have that's the thing brother
[52:52] we've got to get it we've got to take it
[52:54] it's ours but you'll fight every inch in
[52:56] other words you're going to fight every
[52:57] inch going up that statue of perfect
[52:58] it's not going to be perfect man it's
[52:59] not going to be just God's going to lay
[53:01] it in your lap man you got to fight for
[53:03] it fight sleep
[53:06] some of you don't even fight that you
[53:08] get all wiggled in you get down and
[53:11] down
[53:13] all right
[53:15] if I had a cactus
[53:18] and a bowling ball
[53:23] I'd put that Cactus behind your head and
[53:26] I put that bowling ball on your hands
[53:27] with your feet right up underneath it
[53:29] fall asleep one time you'll see one
[53:32] either your toes are gonna get master
[53:33] your head's gone
[53:39] look we're all tried
[53:41] every Christian every son every child
[53:44] that comes to God is Tried by what by
[53:46] the word you're not tried by the devil's
[53:48] word
[53:49] you're Tried by the word of God
[53:53] see if you'll be loyal what to the word
[53:56] of God
[53:57] am I with me when The Showdown comes
[54:00] this and there is going to be a showdown
[54:03] that's why the battle is up here the
[54:05] Battleground is here there's going to be
[54:06] a showdown where one day you're going to
[54:08] say Satan death you have no dominion
[54:11] over me anymore
[54:15] and just as Jesus stood up one day and
[54:17] said all power and Heaven and Earth been
[54:19] given unto me
[54:20] you're going to be able to say the same
[54:22] thing
[54:25] when The Showdown comes what
[54:27] are you going to make
[54:28] that's it and he that cannot
[54:32] stand for the world he's an illegitimate
[54:33] child and not a son and daughter of God
[54:35] certainly not but look the spiritually
[54:37] minded catches the word now look catches
[54:39] the word
[54:40] catches the word
[54:42] here's the hard one
[54:45] it's okay to catch it
[54:47] line up with it
[54:50] and the spirit comes down now look if
[54:52] you do these things I'm gonna read we're
[54:54] gonna read a minute about brother Brown
[54:55] if you catch the word line up with a
[54:58] word and the spirit comes down under the
[55:00] shed blood and what takes that person or
[55:03] what possesses that person possesses
[55:06] that vessel
[55:09] you're gonna be possessed to one of the
[55:11] two
[55:12] all right we're gonna read how brother
[55:14] Brown does that in just a few minutes
[55:17] now remember talking about the three
[55:18] Hebrew children I want you to understand
[55:19] the trials that we go through free the
[55:22] different ones all y'all that go to we
[55:23] all we all go through trials I was
[55:25] telling brother
[55:26] um well Luis have trial you know been
[55:29] going through for a couple years
[55:34] I'm still alive
[55:37] but she's still alive
[55:39] looks pretty good be in the shape she
[55:42] was supposed to be in
[55:44] I like it when you're not in the shape
[55:45] you're supposed to be in
[55:47] because the doctor said you should be
[55:49] this
[55:50] because they're looking at the book
[55:51] we're looking at Dr Jesus in his book
[55:54] which said by my stripes you're healed
[55:57] by my stripes you're healed but we all
[55:59] got to go through something listen your
[56:01] demon is not my demon my demon is not
[56:03] yours everybody with me and we all have
[56:06] Spirits I'll talk to you about that the
[56:08] other day we all have a spirit around us
[56:10] of different things all right
[56:14] but look it delivered them from the from
[56:16] the bonds in other words we got to know
[56:18] that when we go through these trials
[56:20] when we go through these trials it's for
[56:22] our what Perfection not for tearing us
[56:24] down
[56:25] if for something to build character to
[56:28] what to sense that crack up because
[56:31] listen you may not see that crack but
[56:34] God does yes right
[56:35] God knows where that crack is and guess
[56:38] what the devil is right over his
[56:40] shoulder looking at the same crack he's
[56:42] looking at and the devil does what tries
[56:45] to go around God and stick his old nasty
[56:47] hand in that crack
[56:49] I'm sure it's never happened to y'all
[56:51] but y'all pray for me
[56:54] but look you have to stand on that
[56:56] decision like they did and it all worked
[56:58] together for the good so you stand
[57:00] listen I read your quote the other day
[57:02] brother Robert said when you've done all
[57:03] you can do stand there
[57:06] don't go backwards don't quit Church
[57:07] don't quit reading your Bible don't say
[57:09] this ain't the message ain't right don't
[57:11] say God don't hear my prayer stand on
[57:13] what you got
[57:15] if you'll stand there long enough God's
[57:17] got to do something
[57:21] it never hurt him it loosed them
[57:24] your trial will loose you from whatever
[57:28] like my kitty cat thing and I appreciate
[57:30] all y'all want to give me cats but I'll
[57:32] find my own men the Lord will do that if
[57:34] you don't mind
[57:35] I don't want that when the kids from
[57:36] Ohio sent us either
[57:39] that poor cat looked like he'd been run
[57:41] over
[57:43] by a truck
[57:46] I'll find my own thank you
[57:51] but listen you say that's simple
[57:55] but just like I told you
[57:57] a couple years ago
[58:00] when I said something about a preacher I
[58:01] shouldn't have said
[58:03] that bothered me
[58:05] bothered me
[58:07] and bothered me
[58:09] but boy when I call that brother and
[58:10] said hey
[58:11] I said something about you I shouldn't
[58:13] say I shouldn't say it I said would you
[58:16] please forgive me guess what
[58:19] I was heading toward the furnace
[58:21] because I was bound by that
[58:24] I was bound by not thinking right
[58:26] I was bound by something I had done in
[58:29] the past and I was bound
[58:31] but as I headed toward that what what's
[58:33] the worst what's the the worst thing you
[58:36] do in your life
[58:39] say I'm sorry
[58:42] boy don't get quiet on me I'm gonna
[58:44] preach anyhow
[58:46] I'm sorry
[58:47] or I was wrong
[58:52] y'all pray for me if that's not for
[58:54] y'all just it's for me
[58:58] so what a man has to do sometimes look
[59:00] is come out and make his stand get the
[59:03] thing out yes and get him out of the
[59:06] thing so he can get the thing out of him
[59:07] that's why we come to church I believe
[59:09] we come to church to get the thing out
[59:10] of us amen that's why I come here
[59:14] why else would you come here you don't
[59:15] come here to get to be you know well me
[59:18] and Michael we've seen each other three
[59:19] times this week that's wonderful no we
[59:21] both coming what fellowshipped under the
[59:23] word of God and we've become better
[59:25] people because of it all right
[59:27] now there's a perfect way in a
[59:29] permissive way and I feel if God here on
[59:30] the platform and I'm going to stop when
[59:32] we get done with this and read these
[59:33] quotes that you got in your hand can
[59:34] show me things that's been done in my
[59:36] room and so forth he's able to tell me
[59:38] where he wants me and what he wants me
[59:40] to do look but I feel as long as I've
[59:42] got it all hooked up in other words if I
[59:44] put myself first I feel like he won't
[59:46] put his hand on it as long as I'm doing
[59:48] it
[59:50] everybody with me and that's the way it
[59:52] is anything as long as you're going to
[59:54] do it if someone talks about you and you
[59:57] talk back God can't fight your battles
[59:59] remember I told you there's a scripture
[1:00:01] that says if you'll not do that it'll
[1:00:03] keep coals on their head all right and
[1:00:06] you're fighting it yourself we got to
[1:00:08] stop fighting amen ourself
[1:00:11] God's already got the battle one
[1:00:13] we just don't need to get in the way
[1:00:16] the greatest weapon that I know of a
[1:00:17] Christian today is what a committal to
[1:00:20] God yes amen all right let's stop right
[1:00:22] there and let's read this
[1:00:23] pull your quotes out here they won't be
[1:00:25] on
[1:00:26] uh they'll be posted online for the
[1:00:28] brothers and sisters in Ohio I'm sorry I
[1:00:31] wasn't able to put them on the screen
[1:00:32] let's look at the second page Queen of
[1:00:34] Sheba 1961.
[1:00:37] always remember Church
[1:00:40] God's words are true everybody with me
[1:00:42] everybody there second page page number
[1:00:45] two we'd be on the back side of the page
[1:00:46] you got
[1:00:49] I believe the right mental attitude
[1:00:51] toward any Divine promise of God will
[1:00:53] bring it to pass
[1:00:54] look if you can look at it in the right
[1:00:57] way now watch how he's going
[1:01:00] but remember here's been my standard in
[1:01:03] life now what a greater pattern
[1:01:05] messenger than brother Branham and for
[1:01:07] us to pattern ourselves after him
[1:01:08] everybody with me
[1:01:10] if God wanted somebody else to carry
[1:01:12] this perfect word he'd give it to
[1:01:13] somebody else but he give it to William
[1:01:15] Branham amen
[1:01:17] so listen if we listen to 1100 of his
[1:01:19] sermons and say Amen you need to say
[1:01:21] Amen to this quote right here too okay
[1:01:22] everybody with me all right wake up so
[1:01:25] you can read
[1:01:26] I have tried to do this
[1:01:29] the first thing I want to find out
[1:01:31] whether it's the will of God or not how
[1:01:33] many of us do that don't raise your hand
[1:01:36] because most of you would be lying if
[1:01:37] you raise your hand
[1:01:39] anybody with me all right I'm sorry I'm
[1:01:42] in your face a little today but guess
[1:01:43] what this is real this is life all right
[1:01:46] this is life we want to go ahead and do
[1:01:49] something or go ahead and say well I
[1:01:51] think this is right come on
[1:01:54] no how many times have I told you
[1:01:56] tonight listen I got a quote here
[1:01:57] somewhere and I believe I left it in
[1:01:59] there where brother Brown said
[1:02:01] brother Brown said if you start wrong
[1:02:03] you're going to end wrong
[1:02:05] if you'll go back and start right you'll
[1:02:08] end right but you'll never ever end
[1:02:10] right if you start wrong
[1:02:13] think about that you won't
[1:02:17] I want to find out whether it's the will
[1:02:18] of God or not then I know it's God's
[1:02:21] will all right ratchet one up
[1:02:23] everybody with me we're going up one one
[1:02:25] notch he's found it was the will of God
[1:02:27] so he's going to the next step
[1:02:30] the next thing is my objective to it and
[1:02:34] my motive in doing it
[1:02:37] all right what am I going to get out of
[1:02:39] this and what is my this is what I'm
[1:02:41] saying for brother Brown what is my
[1:02:43] congregation going to get out of it what
[1:02:45] is my brethren and my sister is going to
[1:02:47] get out of this all right watch
[1:02:50] the next thing is my objective to it and
[1:02:52] my motive in doing then if the look
[1:02:54] watch if it's the will of God number one
[1:02:58] and my objective is right number two and
[1:03:00] my motive is right part of number two is
[1:03:02] right I have faith that'll be done
[1:03:06] because first it's the will of God
[1:03:10] and my objective is to glorify him and
[1:03:13] my motive is to give him all the glory
[1:03:15] so there's no selfish motive we go back
[1:03:18] to the selfish part there's no selfish
[1:03:20] motive about it if you have a selfish
[1:03:23] motive it won't work all right so stop
[1:03:24] right there
[1:03:25] if you have a selfish motive it will not
[1:03:27] work
[1:03:30] I'm going to do this remember what
[1:03:32] brother Brown said one time about
[1:03:33] brotherly kindness or somewhere in there
[1:03:35] he said he said it's not that if you'll
[1:03:37] scratch my back I'll scratch yours
[1:03:39] right
[1:03:41] he said if your back itches I'll scratch
[1:03:43] yours whether you scratch mine or not
[1:03:44] now it's hard for us to do
[1:03:46] hey man
[1:03:48] don't be a score keeper
[1:03:50] you know it wouldn't bother it's like
[1:03:52] brother Dale I always said
[1:03:55] you can give him a thousand gifts and
[1:03:57] not live what he preaches and that
[1:03:59] Thousand Gifts won't do him or you one
[1:04:01] good
[1:04:03] it just Heats coals on you
[1:04:06] but live what he preached and you don't
[1:04:09] ever have to give him but you can't give
[1:04:11] him a bigger gift
[1:04:12] because you've gave him ten thousand
[1:04:14] whirls you give him your life you've
[1:04:16] given your your wife your kid your
[1:04:18] family all everything has been dedicated
[1:04:21] wow I just saw that everything
[1:04:24] Everything You Touch
[1:04:27] everything you do
[1:04:28] there's no selfish motive about it
[1:04:31] if your objective is to make money for
[1:04:34] yourself oh
[1:04:37] if your objective is to make money for
[1:04:40] yourself or something why you'll never
[1:04:42] succeed
[1:04:44] and then try to do something outside of
[1:04:46] the will of the lord it's not going to
[1:04:48] work to begin with
[1:04:51] amen so there is genuine Faith but you
[1:04:55] must come into the real channel of God
[1:04:57] to have that genuine Faith what is the
[1:05:00] channel of God go back up to read number
[1:05:02] one
[1:05:03] make sure it's the will of God number
[1:05:05] two make sure it's the your objective
[1:05:07] and your motive is right and then what
[1:05:10] have faith
[1:05:11] that it'll be done everybody with me on
[1:05:13] that
[1:05:14] so there is genuine Faith but you must
[1:05:16] come into the real channel of God to
[1:05:18] have that genuine Faith you must come
[1:05:20] into that channel to have what virtue
[1:05:21] knowledge you got to come into that same
[1:05:24] channel to have these virtues living in
[1:05:26] your life
[1:05:27] there's human faith and then there's
[1:05:29] faith of God
[1:05:32] okay
[1:05:34] and you must have a Godly Faith to
[1:05:36] believe now then to have Godly Faith you
[1:05:39] must have the mind of Christ in you
[1:05:42] the renewing of your mind have the mind
[1:05:44] of Christ
[1:05:46] listen the mind of Christ is not going
[1:05:48] to ever tell you do something wrong you
[1:05:51] will override
[1:05:54] you'll override God a lot of times and
[1:05:57] try to do something on yourself on your
[1:05:59] own and guess what happens
[1:06:01] failure
[1:06:03] failure
[1:06:04] that was an old brother one time and
[1:06:06] Lord blessed him my love brother anyway
[1:06:10] and he said the Lord told him now the
[1:06:13] Lord told me that's what he told us the
[1:06:15] Lord told him to get an extra job on
[1:06:18] Sunday
[1:06:19] so he could send that whole check of his
[1:06:22] to Mission work
[1:06:25] uh
[1:06:27] that don't work right that ain't that
[1:06:29] you got to go back to number one
[1:06:31] you can't go back to number one that
[1:06:33] wasn't the will of God or he actually
[1:06:35] turned against his own word
[1:06:38] right
[1:06:39] so this brother for about a year
[1:06:43] worked on Sunday got like paid double
[1:06:45] time
[1:06:46] oh I mean it looked good he was given
[1:06:48] missions
[1:06:50] but he absolutely backslid quit going to
[1:06:53] church now he's back in church now
[1:06:55] but he just it was a wreck
[1:06:58] his motive and objective was not right
[1:07:00] but go back to it now listen this motive
[1:07:03] and objection may have been right to him
[1:07:04] but it wasn't the will of God the very
[1:07:06] first day all right now if you say I'm
[1:07:09] gonna work Saturday and get paid double
[1:07:11] time
[1:07:12] okay all right I'm gonna work a little
[1:07:15] extra during the week but don't ever
[1:07:16] think God's gonna give you a job on
[1:07:17] Sunday
[1:07:22] well praise the Lord
[1:07:25] just a minute look committed to God and
[1:07:28] God will take care of it
[1:07:31] and then he talks about we talk about
[1:07:32] the Army we'll kind of skip through this
[1:07:33] a little bit more where's the
[1:07:35] Battlefront we know where it's at it's
[1:07:37] in our mind all right it's not fighting
[1:07:39] this over here even even Paul told us he
[1:07:43] said look you're not fighting people
[1:07:45] I'm not fighting people today
[1:07:48] we're fighting demons
[1:07:50] listen demons is what gets mad you don't
[1:07:52] get mad the demons inside of you get mad
[1:07:55] now see that made you mad
[1:08:02] we all got them
[1:08:05] we'll praise the Lord believe it or not
[1:08:07] we do
[1:08:09] thank you brother Kylie
[1:08:12] look I believe he's been dressing them
[1:08:14] though for 60 years I believe he's been
[1:08:16] training and dressing a bride
[1:08:19] getting her ready now remember we got to
[1:08:21] make ourselves ready but what does he do
[1:08:24] the Army brother Donnie now the Army
[1:08:26] gave you the best of equipment
[1:08:28] all right
[1:08:29] and they gave it to you and said here
[1:08:31] all right take it take it here okay
[1:08:34] that's the best clothes that's the best
[1:08:36] armor the best gun the best bullets and
[1:08:40] everything I'll give it to you all right
[1:08:42] here you go and brother Ronnie goes oh
[1:08:44] thank you man that's great I appreciate
[1:08:46] that
[1:08:52] you gonna die
[1:08:54] thank you
[1:08:55] you're gonna die they gave you the best
[1:08:58] equipment for you to live and you
[1:08:59] throwed it away
[1:09:01] you're gonna die
[1:09:03] so what do you equip us with it but we
[1:09:05] gotta put it on
[1:09:07] we got to put it on we got the what
[1:09:10] head toward the furnace
[1:09:13] they didn't run away from it they went
[1:09:15] toward it
[1:09:17] amen and I don't believe they were poked
[1:09:19] into it I believe they said well you
[1:09:21] know what they said before they got
[1:09:22] close to it they said God be God if he's
[1:09:24] going to take us out then he's just
[1:09:26] going to take us out but if not we're
[1:09:27] not going to go back and bow down to
[1:09:29] that
[1:09:30] so the greatest battle ever fought in
[1:09:32] her mind but what'd he do he gave us
[1:09:34] something to come back with to fight
[1:09:37] with he gave us armor he gave us all the
[1:09:39] things we needed let's don't throw him
[1:09:41] in a closet
[1:09:42] unless it's your prayer closet yeah
[1:09:45] then you go in there and put them on
[1:09:48] all right there has to be a place
[1:09:50] selected we know that where is it it's
[1:09:51] in our mind
[1:09:54] that Battleground begins in the human
[1:09:56] mind
[1:09:57] there's where the battle starts the
[1:09:59] human mind was chosen for the place of
[1:10:01] battle
[1:10:02] where it was begun and that's because
[1:10:04] that decisions are made from the mind
[1:10:06] decisions
[1:10:08] that's where you make decisions from the
[1:10:09] mind
[1:10:10] and we we are talking about being
[1:10:12] selfish so let's let's get skipped
[1:10:14] through all that brother Brown talks
[1:10:15] about being he isn't he was not selfish
[1:10:17] and a Christian life means you're not
[1:10:19] selfish you want to give away you want
[1:10:22] to what you want to stand behind the
[1:10:23] pulpit and sweat and have your voice all
[1:10:25] messed up brother Dale did it for all
[1:10:27] those years while we was out playing
[1:10:31] thank you
[1:10:33] characters of Victory not a gift
[1:10:36] a man without character can't Reign
[1:10:38] because power apart from character is
[1:10:40] satanic
[1:10:42] power with character
[1:10:43] is fit to rule
[1:10:45] head toward the fire
[1:10:47] not away from it
[1:10:50] if you didn't go through trials listen
[1:10:54] let me say this without hurting your
[1:10:55] feelings again
[1:10:56] the trials that we go through here
[1:10:59] are temporary we're not going to
[1:11:01] remember them anymore
[1:11:03] and you know what happens after years
[1:11:05] there might have been things that we did
[1:11:07] way back when we were young kids that
[1:11:09] we've forgotten about
[1:11:12] I mean do you remember sisters you
[1:11:14] remember the exact pain you had when you
[1:11:16] had a baby
[1:11:17] no right some of you had to you remember
[1:11:20] the exact pain
[1:11:22] no you just had the baby now back then
[1:11:25] you were in the exact pain
[1:11:27] all right
[1:11:28] ask Jim she'll tell you
[1:11:30] exact pain she didn't have anything for
[1:11:32] like 12 hours
[1:11:34] finally she had Hannah been a storm ever
[1:11:36] since
[1:11:37] so
[1:11:40] she was born on a stormy night
[1:11:42] Josh was not he she was he was born
[1:11:46] um on a beautiful Sunday afternoon if
[1:11:48] y'all been reading the CEOs or listening
[1:11:50] to the seals he was born on April the
[1:11:52] 9th April the 22nd May 22nd sorry well
[1:11:56] the seals were being priest daddy said
[1:11:58] Nanny's going to the hospital said our
[1:12:01] first grandbaby is going to be born so
[1:12:02] it's in there somewhere in one of the
[1:12:04] seals but uh
[1:12:06] and
[1:12:08] mama was standing up there like a
[1:12:09] soldier she was wondering if we'd had
[1:12:10] the baby at home I reckon but
[1:12:13] we didn't we had it at home we had it at
[1:12:15] the hospital
[1:12:16] but look these are gifts of God that's
[1:12:19] what I want us to understand we all talk
[1:12:21] about
[1:12:23] uh
[1:12:24] we want to speak in tongues I would
[1:12:26] enjoy somebody speaking tongues and
[1:12:28] interpret all right I would enjoy that
[1:12:30] it would be nice it would be able to to
[1:12:32] to to say you know somebody stand up and
[1:12:34] say well well that's that the Lord if
[1:12:36] sister Anna don't go home that way go
[1:12:39] home 51.
[1:12:41] because it on Guilford highway or on uh
[1:12:43] County Line Road there's going to be a
[1:12:45] wreck they'll say at the Lord
[1:12:46] and there'll be an interpretation that
[1:12:48] says that where she can hear it that'd
[1:12:49] be wonderful
[1:12:50] but now every service it's not going to
[1:12:53] happen
[1:12:54] it's for edification not tearing down
[1:12:56] that's why brother Brian said you got to
[1:12:58] do it right
[1:12:59] even though it's the right thing to say
[1:13:01] if you say it in the wrong time
[1:13:04] it disrupts the service
[1:13:07] but these virtues though are something
[1:13:10] that you have inside of you that you
[1:13:13] carry into this room with and you go out
[1:13:15] of this room with
[1:13:17] gifts of speaking in tongues like it's
[1:13:19] not something that well I just speak in
[1:13:21] tongues Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[1:13:22] Thursday Friday said no no that's a gift
[1:13:26] that's a gift here it's a gift
[1:13:28] but these virtues
[1:13:31] inside of you you're a walking living
[1:13:34] breathing instrumentality of God that's
[1:13:37] what we want
[1:13:39] we want listen we want the gifts of
[1:13:41] wisdom but I want it to be the wisdom it
[1:13:43] comes up on the Statue of perfect man
[1:13:47] but look this has to be first
[1:13:49] and when you have faith virtue knowledge
[1:13:51] he's telling you to have the virtues
[1:13:54] first and then the gifts will come
[1:13:56] behind it and it'll be true
[1:13:58] they work hand in hand
[1:14:02] I would to God that we had gifts like
[1:14:04] that but see everybody talks about them
[1:14:06] last two ones
[1:14:07] we have gifts of Faith wisdom knowledge
[1:14:11] in the nine Spirits together nine of not
[1:14:13] two
[1:14:15] anybody with me on that all right I do
[1:14:18] think we ought to have the other two but
[1:14:20] it's not imperative
[1:14:22] it's imperative that we get these down
[1:14:24] right once you get these down right then
[1:14:27] the gifts will come
[1:14:29] and it'll roll off our tongue like
[1:14:31] speaking in tongues amen then the Holy
[1:14:34] Ghost come down and seals you as a unit
[1:14:35] what those cracks he's trying to get
[1:14:38] those cracks filled up why by the Holy
[1:14:40] Ghost remember why he poured into the
[1:14:43] box honey
[1:14:45] if you we know honey
[1:14:48] it gets in every crack every crevice
[1:14:51] and you can't get it out
[1:14:54] you'll swear you got everything I mean
[1:14:57] the place is clean right June yeah it's
[1:14:59] clean you turn around and walk out to
[1:15:01] the front of that store and you go
[1:15:06] Mr spot
[1:15:09] but that's what honey is it runs
[1:15:13] and it's thick enough
[1:15:15] stop up
[1:15:17] our flus
[1:15:18] that we need stopped off now there's
[1:15:20] something we need to have opened up but
[1:15:21] that box needed to what it needed to be
[1:15:23] lined with honey which brother Brown
[1:15:26] said that was white the Holy Ghost
[1:15:28] all right
[1:15:29] the way he makes his bride is the way he
[1:15:31] makes his individual made out of the
[1:15:33] same material like Eve was made out of
[1:15:35] Adam or rib from the side here's the
[1:15:37] thing that you have to have first you
[1:15:38] can't impersonate them you can't imitate
[1:15:40] them they've got to be god-sent and God
[1:15:43] born imitation only causes confusion and
[1:15:46] that's what we were talking about this
[1:15:47] morning so let's read the rest of these
[1:15:49] right here I want to read these the
[1:15:50] right mental attitude
[1:15:52] now listen
[1:15:54] let's go to page number one and read
[1:15:55] these
[1:15:57] that'll help you stay awake a little bit
[1:15:59] expectations 1950 brother Brown said we
[1:16:02] always get what we expect when people
[1:16:04] expect anything well then they usually
[1:16:07] get what you look for it's the mental
[1:16:09] attitude that you have mental
[1:16:12] listen your soul if you're born again
[1:16:16] when you walked into the door it didn't
[1:16:19] need to be revitalized
[1:16:21] it's Eternal it's the fire of God it's
[1:16:25] dunamis everybody with me but when you
[1:16:28] walked in here you walked in here with a
[1:16:30] spirit
[1:16:31] hey
[1:16:34] yeah
[1:16:35] memory reason conscious affects and
[1:16:37] Imagination and probably another one we
[1:16:39] all drug in everybody with me
[1:16:42] so what happens is you got to take right
[1:16:44] here this is the Battleground
[1:16:47] which one do you which one are you going
[1:16:49] to yield to
[1:16:50] all right
[1:16:51] remember this and never forget it
[1:16:55] the right mental attitude toward any
[1:16:57] promise of God will bring it to pass the
[1:17:01] right mental attitude toward any promise
[1:17:02] of God it doesn't take Gifts of healing
[1:17:05] to heal sick people
[1:17:07] huh
[1:17:09] we've seen that many times
[1:17:12] ma'am several several years ago sister
[1:17:14] Gail was sitting there she was certain
[1:17:16] so bad she couldn't move I mean she was
[1:17:18] trying to move to get her back better
[1:17:20] and I was just preaching away and all of
[1:17:22] a sudden a big smile came over her face
[1:17:23] and she was just you know she's looked
[1:17:26] like something just fell over and she
[1:17:28] told me after the service she said you
[1:17:30] said something she don't remember what
[1:17:31] it was she said you said something she
[1:17:33] said it just went away just like that
[1:17:34] that's the way a gentile is supposed to
[1:17:36] be healed
[1:17:37] he shouldn't need an emotion the Bible
[1:17:40] says why the word was being preached the
[1:17:42] Holy Ghost fell on the people you can
[1:17:44] get the Holy Ghost without coming up
[1:17:46] here and getting shook to death
[1:17:48] everybody with me
[1:17:50] that's to me that's the right way of
[1:17:52] getting it anyway you can have a lot of
[1:17:54] emotion and never get it but when you're
[1:17:55] sitting back there and you're hurting
[1:17:57] and I mean hurting spiritually
[1:17:59] when you're sitting back there hurting
[1:18:01] spiritually and all of a sudden God
[1:18:02] comes and just waves you over with just
[1:18:04] a just a warm feeling and all that stuff
[1:18:06] leaves you and gets out and you're like
[1:18:09] whoa
[1:18:10] that to me
[1:18:12] you put that down right there and the
[1:18:14] devil can't say I think he just felt
[1:18:17] good
[1:18:18] I I I think you just you're just a
[1:18:21] little cold and that's why them chills
[1:18:22] went up your spine that brother just
[1:18:24] moves you around a little bit in it and
[1:18:26] it excited you a little bit but when
[1:18:29] you're sitting back there
[1:18:31] and the word of God just bathes you and
[1:18:34] you just get this feeling you're like oh
[1:18:36] man where'd that come from
[1:18:39] enjoy that
[1:18:41] then you can say devil no emotion
[1:18:44] I did have a a little bit of a sensation
[1:18:47] but there was no emotion involved
[1:18:50] I just believe what that man was saying
[1:18:54] what did Hattie Wright do
[1:18:55] she wasn't in church
[1:18:57] she went into great Revival brother
[1:18:59] random wasn't under the anointing
[1:19:02] oh
[1:19:04] he what he was standing in the kitchen
[1:19:06] table
[1:19:07] talking to some brothers and Hattie was
[1:19:09] in another room
[1:19:10] listening to the conversation
[1:19:13] Mary or Martha whichever one y'all were
[1:19:15] preaching on another night you know Mary
[1:19:16] and Martha want she heard the
[1:19:19] conversation and she just probably stuck
[1:19:21] her head in and said brother Brown that
[1:19:22] ain't nothing but the truth
[1:19:24] and the third poll the greatest power
[1:19:27] that ever was
[1:19:28] fell into that room and said whatever
[1:19:30] you asked for
[1:19:33] God will give it to you
[1:19:36] wow
[1:19:42] Marshall look
[1:19:45] let's finish reading this and I'll read
[1:19:46] this right here it doesn't take get of
[1:19:48] healing to heal sick people
[1:19:52] to meet Satan watch
[1:19:53] it anywhere
[1:19:55] if you're a Christian and defeat him on
[1:19:57] any if you're a Christian and defeat him
[1:20:00] on any grounds that he could stand on
[1:20:03] when Jesus was here on Earth he was the
[1:20:05] fullness of the godhead body all the
[1:20:07] power was in him in other words
[1:20:08] paraphrase
[1:20:10] all he done was Tim give him the word
[1:20:13] 1951 The Hours come not uh e17. now the
[1:20:18] right mental attitude all you along here
[1:20:20] he's talking about the people that come
[1:20:21] into prayer line do you understand what
[1:20:24] I mean when I say the right mental
[1:20:25] attitude your right mental attitude
[1:20:27] toward God's Divine promise will bring
[1:20:29] any promise to pass now maybe you don't
[1:20:32] believe that you say well my faith is
[1:20:34] weak
[1:20:35] I wouldn't confess that
[1:20:39] see don't let the devil know that
[1:20:44] remember brother Brown said if I say it
[1:20:47] he said Satan will fight it he said but
[1:20:49] if I keep it in my heart yeah the devil
[1:20:52] can't get to it
[1:20:54] don't let the devil know it always say
[1:20:56] I've got good faith
[1:20:59] I believe God with all my heart see
[1:21:01] don't testify nothing of the devil
[1:21:06] one more time don't testify nothing of
[1:21:10] the devil and when you accept him as
[1:21:12] your healer don't never act like you're
[1:21:14] sick
[1:21:15] wow are crippled anymore
[1:21:18] believe that you're healed take him in
[1:21:20] his word then it's all over on God now
[1:21:23] not you
[1:21:25] you transfer every bit of that over to
[1:21:27] God
[1:21:28] and say God this is what you said
[1:21:30] when you meet him on the right grounds
[1:21:32] you give it to him and say you said that
[1:21:36] and you know what if he don't act
[1:21:37] immediately
[1:21:39] continue to stand right there
[1:21:42] stand right there
[1:21:44] laughs
[1:21:45] believe that you're healed take him in
[1:21:47] his word then it's all over on God and
[1:21:48] not you see as long as you take God at
[1:21:50] his word then the word will produced
[1:21:52] will produce what it's promised to do
[1:21:57] amen
[1:21:58] let's go to 1960.
[1:22:02] may I go on record now saying this
[1:22:04] I believe that the right mental attitude
[1:22:06] toward any Divine promise of God will
[1:22:09] bring it to pass if you can take the
[1:22:13] right what
[1:22:14] attitude
[1:22:18] your attitude what
[1:22:22] toward any promise
[1:22:24] your attitude what determines your
[1:22:27] altitude also
[1:22:28] how high you can go with God
[1:22:32] look watch this if you can take the
[1:22:34] right attitude toward that promise for
[1:22:36] the promise is a seed
[1:22:38] a seed goes into the ground and if it's
[1:22:41] germatized seed got life in it it'll
[1:22:43] bring forth its kind if it's put in what
[1:22:45] the proper place
[1:22:47] if a seed is put into the ground Jesus
[1:22:49] said the word of God was a seed a man so
[1:22:51] so how are you going to get your relief
[1:22:53] how are you going to get your healing
[1:22:54] how are you going to get your salvation
[1:22:55] from the seed word of God
[1:22:58] amen the word of God quickening in your
[1:22:59] heart
[1:23:00] put in the right place put it in the
[1:23:03] right atmosphere
[1:23:04] put in the right dirt
[1:23:08] we're all just dirt
[1:23:10] look the word of God was the seed a man
[1:23:13] sowed and he was a man that sowed it
[1:23:15] I like the way brother around he and he
[1:23:17] was the man that sold it
[1:23:19] and then if the word of God is a seed
[1:23:22] and the seeds put in proper condition go
[1:23:24] back up to 19. whatever we read over
[1:23:27] there in 19 uh
[1:23:29] 61. take what brother Rob said will of
[1:23:32] God
[1:23:33] motive right objective right and have
[1:23:36] faith
[1:23:37] all right if you've done that right here
[1:23:40] if you've done that right here the seeds
[1:23:43] put in proper condition in a Heart full
[1:23:45] of Faith it'll make every promise live
[1:23:49] now see he's talking about promises
[1:23:51] living
[1:23:53] that's me and you
[1:23:55] you and I are the promise of God you and
[1:23:57] I are the promise of God in the end time
[1:23:58] to destroy Satan by what by your
[1:24:02] feelings no
[1:24:04] by your emotions no
[1:24:07] by how much of the words you are
[1:24:10] it'll make every promise live bring
[1:24:12] forth what it's promised all right let's
[1:24:15] go over to the back side and read the
[1:24:16] last one
[1:24:18] we already read the first one up there
[1:24:19] in 1961.
[1:24:21] 1963 show us the father
[1:24:24] and I go on record he's done said that
[1:24:26] twice I say this about the word of God
[1:24:28] being a seed if you can take the right
[1:24:31] mental attitude toward any Divine
[1:24:33] promise of God he will bring it to pass
[1:24:37] look if you can get yourself in position
[1:24:42] to believe that that promise
[1:24:45] was to you
[1:24:47] he thought every bit of it now to us
[1:24:51] if you believe that promise was to you
[1:24:54] well that's not me no you know what
[1:24:56] Peter said stood upon a dead Pentecost
[1:24:58] he said repent be baptized name of Jesus
[1:25:00] Christ remission sin you shall receive
[1:25:01] the gift of the Holy Ghost for what for
[1:25:03] the promise was given to you
[1:25:05] and your children praise the Lord
[1:25:09] you and your children and then they're
[1:25:11] far off
[1:25:13] if you get in your position what is this
[1:25:16] right here positionally placing you in
[1:25:19] the body where you're supposed to be
[1:25:21] foot hand toe
[1:25:24] uh hair I whatever it is little pinky it
[1:25:28] doesn't matter
[1:25:31] if you can get yourself in position to
[1:25:33] believe that that promise was to you
[1:25:37] not to your neighbor
[1:25:39] not to your wife
[1:25:41] to you
[1:25:43] and then what you do is it you take it
[1:25:46] and you live it out
[1:25:49] you present it then to the world
[1:25:52] God is going to present us to the world
[1:25:57] he's going to stand on the day of
[1:25:58] judgment and he's going to have all of
[1:26:00] his Saints behind him and he's going to
[1:26:02] declare I promise you he's going to
[1:26:04] declare he said these people fought and
[1:26:06] overcome
[1:26:07] and now they are going to judge you
[1:26:12] and some of them are going to be shaking
[1:26:14] in the boots
[1:26:17] because they remember what they did
[1:26:18] wrong to you
[1:26:20] and they remember that they didn't do
[1:26:22] right they remember that they didn't do
[1:26:24] what God Said through us through us I
[1:26:27] mean all of us
[1:26:29] or there's going to be going to be group
[1:26:30] two six round of his sister Anna's going
[1:26:32] to be standing there one day and she's
[1:26:33] going to say that guy changed my tire on
[1:26:35] side of the road
[1:26:40] well he may not know one thing about God
[1:26:43] right but God said because you did it to
[1:26:46] one of my little ones
[1:26:48] you've done it unto me enter into the
[1:26:50] joy of the Lord
[1:26:51] amen they won't get to live in the city
[1:26:54] but you know what they'll be just as
[1:26:56] Eternal As You Are
[1:26:58] but you'll be able to sit down sister
[1:26:59] Anna and sit down under a tree for a
[1:27:01] couple thousand years and tell him how
[1:27:04] your fire got lit and why God did what
[1:27:07] he did through you because God was in
[1:27:09] you
[1:27:10] because he didn't know how God got in
[1:27:12] you because he didn't know that God did
[1:27:13] wasn't in hell we knew God wasn't in him
[1:27:15] right he may have heard a preacher he
[1:27:18] may have turned it down but
[1:27:20] eternal life was going to come through
[1:27:21] me and you
[1:27:24] and today folks into a Dying World this
[1:27:27] is all they got
[1:27:30] this is the only hope they got they
[1:27:32] can't get it out there come on
[1:27:35] this is the only hope of Redemption full
[1:27:38] Redemption is only hope is with the
[1:27:40] bride
[1:27:41] you call it what you want to call it
[1:27:44] but the message of the hour was given to
[1:27:46] us for full Redemption
[1:27:49] and to take full Redemption is going to
[1:27:52] redeem what us first then the Earth
[1:27:56] then the people have to watch on
[1:27:57] judgment wow
[1:27:59] wow think of that it won't give you a
[1:28:02] big head you'll thank God yes
[1:28:06] thank you
[1:28:07] thank you for presenting it to me
[1:28:10] and I said yes
[1:28:12] or I said that ain't nothing but the
[1:28:13] truth
[1:28:15] and I didn't have to stand judgment I
[1:28:17] didn't have to go through the
[1:28:18] tribulation
[1:28:19] I didn't have to watch Israel in 144
[1:28:22] 000. I don't have to watch an atomic
[1:28:24] bomb I don't have to worry about atomic
[1:28:26] bombs
[1:28:28] they're worried about now Russia having
[1:28:29] dirty bombs
[1:28:31] and dropping little Bombs over here and
[1:28:33] little Bombs over here
[1:28:34] our Prophet told us everybody believe
[1:28:36] brother Brown said is our Prophet right
[1:28:38] he said they want an atomic bomb hit the
[1:28:40] earth until we're out of here
[1:28:42] I'll take that
[1:28:45] because look because we are equipped for
[1:28:48] the battle
[1:28:50] go and read the countdown
[1:28:54] read the countdown he'll tell you we are
[1:28:57] equipped
[1:28:58] for this end time
[1:29:00] we're equipped for this not just
[1:29:01] breaking the sound barrier we're going
[1:29:04] to break the eternity barrier
[1:29:06] because there's nobody on Earth Eternal
[1:29:08] but the bride
[1:29:10] but there's a whole bunch of them over
[1:29:11] there in the sixth dimension
[1:29:13] a lot more than is over here everybody
[1:29:15] with me
[1:29:16] there's a lot more over there and they
[1:29:17] are here but they're all coming here
[1:29:19] because of what death being destroyed
[1:29:23] in me and you but we got to show god
[1:29:25] listen we know and I'm telling you one
[1:29:28] more time that we these are requirements
[1:29:30] so we have to go through this is a
[1:29:31] course that you can't miss
[1:29:35] this is a course you can't go from first
[1:29:38] grade to 12th grade and Miss all the
[1:29:40] other
[1:29:40] grades
[1:29:43] you got to go up this statue of perfect
[1:29:44] man one virtue at a time now all the
[1:29:47] virtues will be working in you but you
[1:29:48] got to come to a place one time and say
[1:29:50] all right that's it
[1:29:52] I got this
[1:29:54] I'm working I got this I'm working
[1:29:57] what are you gonna do
[1:29:59] God's gonna try you
[1:30:02] oh bro why are you coming here you're
[1:30:04] not gonna get
[1:30:07] but just like I said this morning by
[1:30:10] about the little cat I mean that's to me
[1:30:12] that's a victory
[1:30:15] that's a victory may not be for you
[1:30:19] some of you still don't like cats I'm
[1:30:22] praying for you
[1:30:23] somebody said amen
[1:30:28] we pray for the sake
[1:30:36] but ain't it the little things though
[1:30:38] that once you get rid of those little
[1:30:40] things that you you there's got to be
[1:30:42] listen if you're a Christian today right
[1:30:44] we'll close right here we'll read these
[1:30:46] later on because I wanted to talk about
[1:30:47] a double-minded man the Bible says the
[1:30:49] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[1:30:51] ways you know what double mind means
[1:30:52] wavering uncertain doubting divided in
[1:30:55] Interest Who divides
[1:30:58] Satan divides God does not divide he's a
[1:31:01] separator he separates us from out there
[1:31:03] brother I'm calling him a
[1:31:04] segregationalist
[1:31:06] because he separates us from the world
[1:31:09] but listen
[1:31:10] a double-minded person is wavering
[1:31:13] uncertain and doubty how are you going
[1:31:15] to build now if you had this Foundation
[1:31:17] right here and it was uncertain wavering
[1:31:21] in other words built on shift and sand
[1:31:24] you ever been out in the ocean and the
[1:31:25] wave come in you put your foot down all
[1:31:28] that sand underneath goes right out from
[1:31:29] under your foot
[1:31:30] why because it's sinking sand
[1:31:33] but you can't do that with a rock
[1:31:35] you go put your foot on a rock that
[1:31:37] Rocket Gibraltar has been there for
[1:31:38] thousands of years and haven't moved an
[1:31:40] inch hey man
[1:31:43] that's what we want to be on that rock
[1:31:46] and not be on sink and sand not be
[1:31:48] double minded well I think I might but I
[1:31:50] and I want and
[1:31:53] go back to this and read
[1:31:55] what brother Brown said to do kids
[1:31:59] young adults us how to make our decision
[1:32:04] is that it that's it right there
[1:32:07] find out it's the will of God
[1:32:09] make sure it lines up with the word in
[1:32:11] other words
[1:32:13] right then check your motive and
[1:32:16] objective not his yours
[1:32:19] and then have faith yes you stand on it
[1:32:22] if you do those things stand right here
[1:32:25] if you want to go up this statue of
[1:32:27] perfect Man start at the we've started
[1:32:29] we've got the foundation I believe ready
[1:32:31] to go but you can't be double-minded
[1:32:33] well I think I I don't think I need
[1:32:35] those I think I'll do this up here and I
[1:32:36] think I'll do this over here that's not
[1:32:39] God
[1:32:40] God's requirements
[1:32:42] are that we go up that statue of perfect
[1:32:44] man the curriculum is already said
[1:32:47] but listen the rewards is already there
[1:32:49] too
[1:32:51] remember I said before you're not going
[1:32:53] to get rid of all your problems but
[1:32:55] you're going to be able to go through
[1:32:57] them and handle them and make them a
[1:32:59] victory
[1:33:01] where the world when they go through
[1:33:03] something they need appeal come on
[1:33:05] somebody they need a pill they need a
[1:33:08] psychiatrist they need to go this they
[1:33:10] need to go dry out for a couple weeks
[1:33:11] they need to go there am I hitting
[1:33:13] something
[1:33:13] but what do we do when we go through a
[1:33:15] trial we're going hey
[1:33:17] when's the next one
[1:33:20] if it made me feel this good give me
[1:33:22] another one
[1:33:24] oh now see y'all say I'm crazy
[1:33:27] y'all looking at me like no I don't want
[1:33:30] another one
[1:33:33] I got delivered from being a cat killer
[1:33:35] okay let me have my day
[1:33:41] and like I said again don't set no caps
[1:33:43] on my porch
[1:33:45] I'll find my own
[1:33:47] me and Tabby's going to have a talk
[1:33:50] before we have to do this me and Jim's
[1:33:52] gonna have to have a talk first
[1:33:54] can I go home with some of y'all today
[1:33:58] she says she's allergic to him so am I
[1:34:00] they die every time I get around them
[1:34:03] not anymore
[1:34:05] not anymore
[1:34:10] but watch this let's read this right
[1:34:12] here and then we'll close let musicians
[1:34:14] come on
[1:34:15] a person of virtue I'm talking about all
[1:34:18] the virtues a person of virtue makes the
[1:34:21] progression from knowing what is right
[1:34:23] to doing what is right
[1:34:26] good to know listen to First
[1:34:35] step and Jesus said
[1:34:38] ain't doing you no good
[1:34:41] you're just going by rituals you're just
[1:34:43] coming to church you're just coming
[1:34:44] because brother white said you need to
[1:34:46] come to church no you need to come to
[1:34:48] church like brother Brown said because
[1:34:49] you want to
[1:34:51] you have a desire yes
[1:34:53] he or she intentionally chooses what to
[1:34:56] say do in value reaching beyond the good
[1:34:59] toward the best in every situation a
[1:35:03] virtuous person knows that they have an
[1:35:06] opportunity to honor the Lord and
[1:35:08] reflect him to others now that was a
[1:35:11] that I got that from a preacher on the
[1:35:13] internet
[1:35:14] not a message preacher either and that's
[1:35:17] profound
[1:35:19] in every situation a virtuous person
[1:35:21] knows that they have an opportunity to
[1:35:23] honor the Lord and reflect them to
[1:35:24] others let's stand our feet
[1:35:26] the problem they have with now listen
[1:35:28] let me let me just
[1:35:30] just for a minute
[1:35:32] the problem they have is is they can't
[1:35:33] live every word
[1:35:35] so God don't have to honor everything
[1:35:37] they do I said not everything right God
[1:35:41] can't honor something non-word
[1:35:44] but if we line ourselves up and get
[1:35:46] behind the word that that's a prophet
[1:35:49] brought that we look through the filter
[1:35:50] of the message and see what the word is
[1:35:53] saying and we get behind that or
[1:35:56] actually get in it
[1:35:58] then we've got a one up on the world
[1:36:01] but now problem
[1:36:02] kids all y'all you're gonna look at
[1:36:05] people and they're gonna say
[1:36:06] why y'all wear dresses
[1:36:08] why y'all why y'all not cut your hairs
[1:36:11] and man I can trim mine up and I can be
[1:36:13] up I'm gonna be gone in 15 minutes
[1:36:17] and it takes 15 minutes for y'all to
[1:36:19] find your hair sometimes
[1:36:21] where'd it go
[1:36:27] but they got something then people the
[1:36:28] world don't have
[1:36:30] they've got faith in what God Said in
[1:36:33] his word
[1:36:35] that a virtuous woman
[1:36:37] in other words dresses herself right
[1:36:40] a virtuous woman acts right clothes
[1:36:42] herself right knows what to do knows
[1:36:45] that her hair is her glory knows that
[1:36:47] she's to present herself not to the
[1:36:49] world so that everybody can see
[1:36:52] amen
[1:36:54] but then she can give herself to her
[1:36:55] husband
[1:36:56] what a great thing
[1:36:59] just like us giving ourselves to Christ
[1:37:02] and him what
[1:37:04] the Bible says we're accepted in the
[1:37:07] Beloved
[1:37:08] I want to be accepted
[1:37:10] but you're not going to be accepted if
[1:37:12] you're a prostitute
[1:37:13] now you might have been one I'm talking
[1:37:15] spiritually if you might have been well
[1:37:17] even naturally but God if you take God
[1:37:19] at his word and say God this is what I'm
[1:37:22] going to live from this day forward
[1:37:25] I'm going to try my best to read my
[1:37:28] Bible
[1:37:29] pray listen to the message of the hour
[1:37:32] come to church come to Sunday school do
[1:37:35] everything and then God you know what he
[1:37:37] said you know boy brother I'm saying if
[1:37:39] you motivate objectives right
[1:37:41] just have faith that that you're going
[1:37:43] to grow have faith God's going to heal
[1:37:45] you have faith God's going to give you
[1:37:46] the Holy Ghost if you're thinking Holy
[1:37:47] Ghost today just have faith that you got
[1:37:49] it already what I read here with brother
[1:37:52] Brown said don't tell the devil that
[1:37:54] you're sick
[1:37:55] don't tell the devil you don't have
[1:37:57] faith
[1:37:59] don't testify nothing of the devil
[1:38:02] I've got good faith I believe God with
[1:38:04] all my heart see don't testify nothing
[1:38:08] of the devil nothing
[1:38:11] nothing don't testify anything of the
[1:38:13] devil all right you know why because if
[1:38:15] you give him an inch you what takes a
[1:38:17] mile don't give him an inch give God an
[1:38:20] inch and it'll be Eternal let's sing a
[1:38:22] song God bless you

[1:39:31] underneath your wings
[1:39:37] [Music]
[1:40:03] went at the store
[1:40:08] underneath your wings not concrete not
[1:40:12] stale I Rejoice
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:19] they told us you know in the Book of
[1:40:21] Psalms they said run into there run into
[1:40:24] that Refuge
[1:40:26] be hid in the Pavilion that God has put
[1:40:30] up for me and you it's so strange that
[1:40:32] brother Brown read that Psalms for the
[1:40:35] Rapture message
[1:40:37] you're my refuge run into my shelter
[1:40:41] watch what we got to do before we go
[1:40:43] take a rapture
[1:40:44] we got to be what under his wing under
[1:40:47] his shelter not concrete not Steel
[1:40:50] feathers
[1:40:52] underneath his feathers you know what
[1:40:54] humanly
[1:40:56] you'd rather try stealing concrete right
[1:40:59] humanly speaking if you had
[1:41:02] here comes the bomb you've got a bomb
[1:41:05] shelter made out of concrete a bomb
[1:41:07] shelter made out of steel and you've got
[1:41:09] an eagle there with feathers out like
[1:41:11] this
[1:41:14] bro John
[1:41:15] we going to one of these over here
[1:41:19] but God said go to that one
[1:41:21] these are going to be destroyed
[1:41:24] but underneath his wing
[1:41:26] underneath his wing is eternal life
[1:41:29] that may get you temporary but let me
[1:41:31] tell you something about them about them
[1:41:33] bunkers then people just don't realize
[1:41:35] that when all the when all hell breaks
[1:41:37] loose and all the atomic explosion comes
[1:41:39] out it's gonna be months before they can
[1:41:41] come out of them bunkers
[1:41:42] and they're gonna have to bring
[1:41:44] something they're gonna be breathing
[1:41:45] Atomic junk
[1:41:46] they gonna die
[1:41:48] that's right you know why because they
[1:41:50] didn't take up some feathers
[1:41:52] if they just start giving themselves to
[1:41:55] God and get placed under his wing
[1:41:58] you know what they'll make it but the
[1:42:00] world don't want that the world does not
[1:42:02] want they want technology
[1:42:05] they won't they want somebody to put
[1:42:08] something together
[1:42:09] [Music]
[1:42:10] so I can hide under like we're talking
[1:42:12] about the the
[1:42:13] shot and everything they want everybody
[1:42:15] now is going to take any all kind of
[1:42:17] shot they got one for flu they got one
[1:42:18] for uh shingles they got one for this
[1:42:20] one for that and that's okay take them
[1:42:23] but
[1:42:24] wait what if one day we can't get to a
[1:42:28] shot
[1:42:29] or you can't get to your blood pressure
[1:42:31] medicine
[1:42:34] when you can't buy or sell that means
[1:42:36] drugs too
[1:42:38] we better start conditioning ourselves
[1:42:41] not not taking them but say God when the
[1:42:43] time comes I'm gonna have to trust in
[1:42:45] you but I'm gonna start having to trust
[1:42:47] in you right now I'm gonna trust in you
[1:42:49] right now and then let's develop into
[1:42:53] that if we need to have blood pressure
[1:42:55] medicine guess what you know what an old
[1:42:58] Indian said one time
[1:43:00] he said me don't need Pharmacy
[1:43:03] God put everything I need in ground
[1:43:07] we've just developed Walgreens and
[1:43:10] something in the past hundred years
[1:43:12] before that what'd you do you ate a root
[1:43:15] you boil some tea you put this together
[1:43:18] with that together and the old Indian a
[1:43:20] lot of our things that we got come from
[1:43:22] the Indians because you know what they
[1:43:24] believed in God
[1:43:25] they believed there was a god they
[1:43:27] believed there was somebody that put
[1:43:29] their provisions on Earth so they can
[1:43:30] live
[1:43:32] so they give them all the herbs and
[1:43:33] everything they needed that's what the
[1:43:34] Bible says he give the herbs you know
[1:43:36] for us to what live by
[1:43:38] and that's okay but that's what they're
[1:43:39] doing they're mashing up all the herbs
[1:43:41] giving it to you a little pill
[1:43:43] but we got trust in God
[1:43:45] let's learn to trust in God
[1:43:48] he's our refuge
[1:43:51] the world's not
[1:43:52] the doctors are not
[1:43:55] this is our refuge
[1:43:57] he's our hiding place
[1:43:59] Satan can't find you when you're in
[1:44:01] Christ
[1:44:02] he can find you everywhere else
[1:44:04] when you get in Christ he can't find you
[1:44:07] your head
[1:44:09] you're sheltered
[1:44:10] try brother Brown priest out because
[1:44:12] when we run into that Pavilion
[1:44:14] that's Jesus Christ that's when the
[1:44:17] Rapture is going to take place problem
[1:44:18] is we're running around here trying to
[1:44:20] figure something out to see if we can
[1:44:21] make it make it through because of this
[1:44:23] make it through because of that we're
[1:44:25] only going to make it through because of
[1:44:26] God that's the only thing we're going to
[1:44:28] make it through is because God's gonna
[1:44:29] give us the provisions We need he will
[1:44:32] absolutely he is he has recruited us
[1:44:36] hey man he's recruited us he's given us
