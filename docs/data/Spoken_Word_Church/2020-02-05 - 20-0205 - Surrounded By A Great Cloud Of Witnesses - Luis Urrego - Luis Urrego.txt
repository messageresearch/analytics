the Lord today thank the Lord for allowing us to be here another day appreciate brother Dale allowing us to take the pulpit a man and justwait share something with you that maybe might be helpful amen praise the Lord I appreciate all the prayers for this this Sunday as we were ministering I appreciate it brother Kenneth Boone's in Greenville South Carolina in the morning and then at brother gene Williams in the afternoon so they all send greetings to both both brother Dale and brother Wade and all of you and also spoke briefly to brother Tim Burdette and he sends his greetings as well to Dale so we certainly had a good time and I appreciate all of your prayers amen so we're just gonna go ahead and go to the word and we want to turn to Hebrews chapter 11 hebrews chapter 11 we're gonna start at verse 39 amen if you have it say Amen I know brother Dale he's been bringing out from Hebrews 11 I want to read verse 39 and then we're gonna agreed to the next chapter which is two up to verse three so let's just start at verse 39 and says and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us keep that in mind that day without us should not be made perfect and then it continues right into chapter 12 Paul continues to say wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and it sat down at the right hand of the throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your minds so if that can't happen then Paul wouldn't have given that that that warning because it can happen doesn't matter how long you've been in the message we can get spiritually weak in our minds if we don't continue in the word amen so I want to I want to talked about tonight and I want to title this surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses amen so let's just bow our heads our Heavenly Father we thank you lord once again for the opportunity to open that back the pages of your word we ask for your blessing now Lord and just may you just meet every need amongst us father God as your word goes forth Lord minister to those needs Lord speak through my lips Lord and then let us something be said Lord that it would help and benefit the people and encourage them in their walk Lord with you we committed this time into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated praise God amen hmm alright tonight tonight I want to I want to discuss I want to discuss we're gonna talk about a couple of things but I want to get the meat of it I want to I want to talk about this cloud and that it's you know it's been it's been the controversy of us for since it first came up here it's been a controversy brother Dale I'm sure I know that he had to deal it with it back in the 70s people misunderstanding what this what this is leaving the message just because of of what they thought you know they knew about the cloud but I want to tie it in with a couple of other things so I would ask you all this evening I believe God has something for you tonight so please don't fall asleep please try to maintain awake because I promise you I will get everybody to stand it's becoming a nice little habit here and I will do it too I believe God has something his word and it also encourages us because I mean we labor for hours taking this information and and when and you know if you're paying attention hey it just blesses us so man so so thank you very much now brother Brown says here in Jehovah Jireh in 1962 and I'm just gonna I'm gonna do a lot of reading so you just bear with me but if you want a copy of these notes or a copy of any of these images and things that I'm going to show you're more than welcome to it and so you you can have it you can have anything here about brother Branham says here in the 11th chapter these things was for our example seeing that where compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses we are to lay aside every sin what is sin unbelief so when we were reading there in in that verse you know lay aside the sin in the easily besets us it's the unbelief amen and so when you have unbelief in your life and which is sin it's gonna cause you I mean the the effects of that is the smoking and the drinking and the gambling and the doing all these other things and you do all those things brother Branham said is because you don't believe truly in your heart you don't believe amen but how many believers do we have here tonight amen and so brother ban says what is in its unbelief every sin every unbelief of God's Word that that does so easily beset us we come up against something say well they preach that that was don't you do that you do just what God said do stay with it to the letter amen say it don't make any difference amen so I believe there in Hebrews chapter 11 if you read the whole chapter and we don't have time to read it it's the faith chapter and it's the witnesses Amen that God has had through the Paul was speaking through the Old Testament witnesses of what God's power in a believers life amen and and so here in every in every age God has a wit as a matter of fact he even told the disciples there and and that we went for them to go to the upper room and they would be endued with power from on high and from there they'll be there with his witnesses so when the Christian has the holy ghost tonight amen we are his witnesses amen praise God we are his we are his his love his his witness amen to the dying world it's dying in this hour amen praise the Lord so God always has witnesses and the Bible says he also that in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established amen praise the Lord Jesus so Paul continues to say and if we want to let's read in 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 and the reason why we want to make sure we don't forget the things that God has done and this our day is one of them is so that your minds won't be corrupted a man Paul says here for I am jealous and verse 2 for I am jealous over you with godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve though hyssop through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ amen how many believe that Christ is simple amen he's complex to the world because they can't figure him out but to the believer the longer you stay with that word and feeding on that word the more simpler he gets I don't think he gets more complicated he gets more simpler at least that's been from my case they meant as the word as you're growing in the word he gets more simple amen so it's so it's always good to remember what God has done in 2nd Peter chapter 1 Peter says it like this wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things don't you know them and be established in the present truth amen yeah I think it meat as long as I am this Tabernacle to stir you up now brother he's been talking about revival they may what is revival stirring what you already have up stirring that word that is already in you amen that is a revival in your heart we're not waiting for lots of jumping a shout and screaming things like those are wonderful things and if it happens we needed amen well I believe we need that but but it's the word Amen that's that that needs to be stirred up in our hearts amen so just Paul says here to stir you up by putting you in remembrance or sorry Peter says here knowing that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ Christ hath showed me moreover I will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance amen for we have not followed cunningly devised fables as as they say we have as the people out there the unbeliever says we have cunningly devised fables but when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty now here's Peter talking about him being an eyewitness because he was an eyewitness of what happened in Mount Transfiguration when Jesus took him and the other disciples he saw firsthand what had happened man for he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from him the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy amen so Satan when he comes in a man tries to give you bring some unbelief try to bring some of that doubt well you know what in the world - why when in the world do I believe what is it that I believe you know I he still can do it 40 years he into the message he still can do it 50 years in the message amen he still comes in and tries to bring that unbelief in our lot in our lives but but Peter says here we also have a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine a--the in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts amen praise God so let's look at the word witness the brothers can bring that up now look this at in Webster's dictionary and let's just down to the two the third one it says one asked to be present at a transaction so as to be able to testify to its having taken place one who has personal knowledge of something and then I like fob a some things serving as evidence or proof a sign it says right next to it so I clicked on the word sign and this is what the meaning of the word sign means a mark having a conventional meaning and used in place of words or to represent a complex notion a posted command warning or Direction something material or external that stands for or signifies something spiritual amen and then something indicating the presence or existence of something else amen praise the Lord now that's Webster's dictionary for the word sign amen praise God keep that in mind as we as we continue to look at look at this cloud now God he's given signs since the beginning he's always McGinn ado something on earth he always declares it in heaven Amen even brother Branham said that in Genesis 1:14 the Bible says there and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years so even from the beginning God established a man that that delights the the the the the things up in heaven amen the celestial bodies would be used for signs amen and so we see that and we have seen that throughout all of our years that God amen speaks to us even even in the and this our day he spoke the same exact way Amen brother branham had a sign Amen when he was born we saw that Amen when when when God Amen he said that he would write his first Bible was the zodiac and so he used the zodiac as his first Bible and and we see that the a star appeared before Jesus's birth that only only certain people were able to catch to it or see what it wouldn't what it was nobody maybe a lot of people like most people today they're not paying attention to what's going on but those individuals were and they knew that Messiah was to was to come on the earth because they were looking for him amen so God always declares his word in heaven first before he declares it on earth praise God now I want us to read this here and I'm just going set in this foundation as quick as I can so that's why I'm going a little quick amen because I have more content God in Isaiah chapter 7 because sometimes we we we say to ourselves well you know we don't sign we don't win that win as believers we don't follow signs or we don't look for signs and that is very true we don't we're not I don't need a sign amen to validate a man that God has given me the Holy Spirit or that this message is real or that the Bible is real they meant that means that God has not revealed his word to you amen praise God but sometimes God amen he's he's pleased to show signs amen to declare that his word is but to become is about to be established here on earth amen so if we read in Isaiah chapter 7 verses 9 through 14 this is a speaking of a has and a had this is a very familiar scripture to us but he has here I believe he was a commander of the army of Israel or and they were enough they were fighting against Samaria and some other some other nations at that time and watch what verse 9 says in the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is room is remilia son if you will not believe surely you shall not be established so Isaiah came to to Ahaz and he gave him a word 2 and this is the word that he's telling him and so he's saying surely he shall not be established if you don't believe amen so verse 10 says moreover the Lord spake unto a has same as the a sign of the LORD thy God ask it either in the depth or in the height above so God is telling through Isaiah to tell a has asked me for a sign go ahead tell I could give it to you in heaven or I can give it to you on under under the under the earth or in the ocean but watch what a sir said a a has says but a has said I will not ask neither will I the Lord now that's very important and he said hear ye now o house of David it is a small thing for you to weary man but will ye weary my God also and there and then this is what this is when God through the lips of Isaiah speaks this to Ahaz and he says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel I'm pretty sure a has didn't understand what that was about what was about but that is where it was written a man that it was going to happen hundreds of years later and and and an a has he was not seeking a sign because you noticed what he said there and then but God was going to give that sign amen that word as a sign to let her to let them know hey this is going to take place here on earth it doesn't matter when hundreds of years laters it could have been the next day but it was going to happen because there was God speaking Amen now compare that to the difference of the way the Pharisees approached Jesus Christ and they were seeking after a sign they were seeking and they were saying okay if you're the Messiah assigned in other words tempting him amen and and Jesus says there in mark chapter 8 verse 11 he says and the Pharisees came forth and began to question with him seeking of him a sign from heaven tempting him and he sighed deeply Jesus I start deeply in his spirit and said why did this generation seek after a sign Amen I verily I say unto you there shall no sign be given unto this generation Amen and he just left it at that so God wants to show forth signs Amen but to those who are ready to receive them a man with a good and glad heart and know that that the word is true know that that it that it's right with the word a man God has shown us signs has shown us signs but if you come with the attitude of a like the Pharisees came to Jesus tent in him or are you are you really the Messiah are you really who you say you are you know didn't really believe exactly who he was yet seeking a sign God does not does not play around for nobody you see God doesn't need to give you a son just because you asked for it you see God does not need to do anything the same thing with the devil the devil showed him if you are the son of God do this that and the other and he could have but he didn't because he doesn't need the clan around for Satan right God has specific purposes of why he shows signs amen so they were tempting him and and in Deuteronomy 616 clearly says thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God so they were not getting a sign because they were already breaking the law there and then and then the sign that they needed was already standing before them the word was already fulfilled in the Virgin amen when when Mary gave birth to Jesus that was already fulfilled that was a sign right there but they failed to see that and they were not getting any more signs amen so so signs from God sayings they're usually prelude to the word to the coming to the word coming forth amen now I know saying the human side of us sometimes we need that assurance amen - let us know hey we were going in the right direction amen this is this is right this is and God knows that God God was a human being just like you and I are a man and God created you and I so he knows that we have those those needs to be reassured amen and and so for for example I like to use this example that if you're traveling to Albuquerque New Mexico and you're using your GPS you don't have a paper map like the way we used to we used to use everybody uses their GPS now on their phone and so you're traveling and and brother Joe and sister Rachel they know the way they know the way to get to New Mexico and I know from my understanding you go hours with like nothing around you all of a sudden your GPS you're traveling and all of a sudden your GPS goes out and it's not working anymore what are you to do what are you supposed to do it there you probably start panicking what turn am I supposed to take next what everybody supposed to do next amen but if you see a sign amen and it says Albuquerque New Mexico 50 miles ahead well that helps you a man that gives you an assurance Amen oh ho well I'm on the right track amen I'm on the right Road my GPS may not be working but I see and I see that there's a gas station about three miles up ahead praise the Lord amen you see that as humans it reassures us amen so so God knows that and so that's what he has sent us signs amen not because we were tempting him not because we were asking but because God wanted to do it I mean in order to establish a man a sure word in our hearts amen praise God in Saints I believe in this day we serve mighty God amen with a sure word that has come down and this our day amen we don't serve anything no fables no cunning devices a man this is for real what's happened in this our day praise God and so Saints these signs they usually stumble the unbeliever and make and they make believer but it it gives the Oblivion assurance amen praise God so as we have read Amen in Hebrews 12:1 wherefore seeing we also compassed about with so great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us amen so we see that there were witnesses there in Hebrews 11 and and you know what Saints nature is a witness amen remember brother brown talked about the the tree and how it loses his leaves amen and how it those leaves the life of that tree that sap a man goes down into the root of the tree and showing that the tree that there's a death but then what happens in the springtime the leaves start growing again amen and the showing that there's a resurrection taking place that's not the end of the tree just because you see it looks like it's dead out here doesn't mean that it's dead amen then it then it has a life amen through the summer until fall again and Saints we have to remember sometimes things may be going on in our lives amen there might be that fall time in our lives praise God where things are dying things seem bleak Amen but you know what that's the most beautiful time in God's eyes that's what the Bible says that the death of his Saints they're so precious in his eyes amen that's the most beautiful time for God the death of his Saints for one they're coming home but to a man that's that's beautifully meant because they have that promise of a resurrection amen for them praise God so and and and like I said earlier you and I are witnesses of Jesus when when the Holy Ghost is in our hearts amen when you have the new birth your witness amen of what God has done amen in the through through you in the word amen to be the word so now let's talk about here just a moment let's talk about clouds in the Bible amen how many are still with me praise the Lord amen all right so let's look at some clouds in the Bible amen because surely Saints if if this if we say that this is spiritual something spiritual just took place and I believe it is amen then surely there has to be an example in the Bible amen where this ties to right because God doesn't do nothing just doesn't bring anything new amen it has to tie in with the word somehow praise God and I believe it does so let's look at Exodus chapter 19 and we're just going to go through these quickly it happened in the in the in the ministry of moses and verse 7 and Moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their face all these words with to the lord commanded him and all the people answered together and said all the LORD hath spoken we will do and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord now watch verse 9 and the Lord said unto Moses lo I come unto thee in a thick cloud that now this is the reason why watch that the people may hear when I speak with thee and believe thee forever and Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord so there's the reason why God was going to speak he was getting ready to deliver his 10 the 10 commandments the law to the people and God used this cloud this thick cloud that Moses went into and heard the voice of God so that they people could see it and believe what Moses came down from the mountain to tell them praise God so keep that in mind Saints as we as we continue we also see it in Exodus chapter 24 and verse 12 it says in the Lord said unto Moses come on to come up to me into the mount and be there and I will give the tables of stone and a law and a commandment which I have written that thou may just teach them teach the people and Moses rose up and his minister Joshua and Moses went up in the Mount of God and he said unto the elders tarry ye here for us until we come again unto you and behold Aaron and Hur are with you If any man have any matters to do let him come unto them so Moses he took some witnesses up with him right he had some witnesses that that went up to the mountain with him amen and Moses went up into the mountain verse 15 and a cloud covered the Mount and the glory of the Lord abode upon the Mount Sinai and the cloud covered it six days and watch in the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud now that pattern right there six days and then the seventh day something happens he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel so the children of Israel were watching this and Moses went into the midst of the cloud and got him up into the mountain and Moses was in the Mount forty days and forty nights and we know that he came down with the tables of stone with the commandments the Word of God to the people they men praise God so if that cloud was not important they wouldn't it wouldn't shouldn't have been in the word but it was very important to God because God had men put it in the word amen it happened in Moses ministry praise God now let's look at Mount Transfiguration Jesus ministry a cloud a cloud appeared as well in Matthew chapter 7 17 and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John and his brother his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart so Jesus also took witnesses and then and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the Sun and his raiment was white as the light amen and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him interesting these two prophets are the ones that come on that scene what was the ministries that brother Branham was was was was was - what I'm looking forward the ministries that brother bran was typing Moses and Elijah amen praise God let's just get down to verse 5 while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear you him again a cloud came on the scene as the word was going to come forth to Moses for the children of Israel here comes the Word of God which is Jesus Christ getting ready to come on the scene now everybody was to hear him amen from there God said hear ye him amen from that from that event and mount Transfiguration praise God so I'm going to skip some of these verses amen now let's look at brother Benton's ministry brother Browns ministry as I said it typed amen Moses and Elijah and brother Branham also the brothers could bring bring up the first picture we got some slides here for you tonight amen so this is very familiar to us but we should not take it lightly Saints honestly I feel that sometimes we just we take things so lightly and forget the great things that God has done and what this really represents to us today as a matter of fact I think this is greater to us now today than it was back then when it first went when it when it appeared because now we have a further understanding of the word amen and some of us as some of us may be younger ones we've grown up with these things we've grown up with looking at the seven church ages the hoffmans head of Christ and all these things added to us so it doesn't doesn't seem like it does anything to us but it's it's God a man showing to us a mandate he's revealing himself to us in this our generation you know and we should be thankful for that praise God so so brother Branham as as we see Moses he had some witnesses that went up to the mountain with him Jesus had some witnesses that went up to the mountain with him and of course if we brothers Branham also tells us that when he was up in the mountain there when that cloud came down he had some witnesses with there with him as well and two of those were brother Jean Norman and brother fred sauceman and they tell their testimonies as well of what happened there and it concurred with what brother Branham said and so and just and just reading this real quick this cloud was a sign for brother Branham to go back east to Jeffersonville Indiana to preach the seals amen it was a cloud that when the cloud appeared it was a sign to us of the coming opening of the word amen through the preaching of the seals amen so in all events in moses and moses the cloud came down to to show forth the coming word the ten commandments that was going to be for the people in the mount transfiguration the coming word amen Jesus amen there was a transfigured and he came to his to his full adoption there amen full adoption and and and so God says hear ye him and now amen and this day God said showed that cloud and brother branham and told brother Brown to go back east to preach the seals amen and so the cloud is a sign to us that Christ is here manifesting himself through his body called the bride amen praise God now I'm going pretty good amen praise the Lord how many are still with me I mean so you're understanding where we're going amen this is not just a picture and this is not just one single event there's a backup of it in the word amen so if somebody comes to you and saying well what is this you could tell them then the word it's there you know praise God so now let's just look at a couple of highlights if they could if they could search to the second second picture now this is the picture that we saw in this magazine here alright and and this is a it's on insultin page 111 and page 112 interesting numbers by the way as well and so this picture was there and it was in a pyramid shape I think and we know Saints that Christ amen he's the head of the church and as we see here this is this is this is us growing a man walking in this in the statue of a perfect man they meant but I believe this that this this headstone right here is Christ and it's this message amen it's what brother Brennan preached after 1963 amen when those seals were opened this is what was coming down amen and so before that word was gonna be open those seals was gonna be open God manifests himself on in the form of a cloud in a form of a pyramid amen now the brother brother brother Joe gave me this just right before service started and I did not know this amen but the same constellations of angels that had appeared to William Branham on sunset peak also appeared in a cloud front form above Sunset Crater a mountain without a peak now I didn't know that there was a mountain without a peak there the southern edge of the cloud rested above Sunset Crater a mountain without a peak if the brothers could just skip all the way to picture number 12 you can just kind of close this down and skip all there it is right there where where this cloud appeared was over sunset mountain but apparently there's a mountain there with a crater right in it and look at this that is that's not a coincidence and watch the southern edge of the cloud rested above Sunset Crater in other words the southern part of the cloud I'm not sure if it's talking about this part or this part so anyways it was resting upon that crater and as you know the Pyramid was never capped this is a quote brother branham day stones yet to come it's been rejected could it be brethren sisters or is this that third pool that he told me three or four years ago amen so god that's interesting that and I did not know that amen so we can go back to picture number two again praise the Lord you love the Lord amen all right Saints so if you look closely here that brother Branham said that there was this a constellation of angels amen now to me and I don't know if you see this or not but to me if you look up here this is the way the the picture was shown on on yeah I believe yes this is the way the picture was shown on the magazine on Life magazine all right now we see here to me that looks like a lamb I don't know if it is or not but it looks like a lamb to me amen and so we see that right here amen if he turned the picture of sideways brother Brandon was told to turn the picture sideways and it's on the next on the next and then we see that it looks like Hoffman's head of Christ amen now in revelations chapter five Saints Amen the the the lamb amen if you read I don't we don't have time to read it but if you read revelations chapter five the only one that was that could open the seals was the lamb amen if you read there in revelations chapter five amen and so when he when he was going to open the seals amen this was a turning Amen that God Amen was turning from was was changing to from mercy and grace amen to to wrath and judgment that get ready to come he's looking down on the earth now a man if he if you look he's looking down on the earth and if you go to the next picture and we see that that picture looks that that cloud looks exactly just like Hoffman's head of Christ I mean we have it up here and you see and she the exact same thing so that is no coincidence and I could read to you Saints all kinds of quotes and all kinds of other things but we would just be here for days amen so let's look at the at the next as the next picture now we all know this magazine and I just pulled it up right here amen and it's interesting that this magazine was was came out on May 17th 1963 and the we know that may is the fifth month of the of the year the number five being the number of grace amen that's very important I don't think that's there just to be there amen but to 17th is also a very important number it's a number of judgment and victory amen brother Branham said and also the Bible supports it that that Noah went into the ark on the 17th of the second month and brethren say on May 17th now to us the second month would be February right amen but if you look at the Jewish calendar a man the first month is a beef which is April the second month is May so the Bible's not wrong and neither was brother branham's right praise God so that is no coincidence that this magazine came out on may 17 1963 showing us that God was turning it was it was God was turning now to four it is looking now all the grace they he was shown and of course he's still showing grace but it's just a sign a man that judgments get ready to strike the earth the word and of course we've seen judgment has been striking the this this nation ever the thing has gotten worse ever since then here in this on this nation amen so so so if you look at the magazine it's interesting that I'm just pointing out these things I'm not saying these things as doctrine you know but it's just interesting a Rockefellers honeymoon and as controversial as that may have seen is interesting that it's on the cover of this magazine amen as a union taking place amen and a honeymoon get being pronouns they met and I believe that's what God is doing right now a man then is bride Amen that's a union we should already be married to Christ that's why Paul said I've espoused you amen I was Powe sure and now while we're waiting is for a honeymoon to take place amen praise God very interesting also that it speaks about I believe it was Gary Cooper yeah Gordon Cooper to complete his twenty second space flight on a ship now I looked at that Gordon Cooper you know what the ship was he completed it later on that year the name of the ship was called faith 7 that was the name of the ship so so that was his gonna be his 22nd orbit and it was it was to be the longest orbit that he was to be that he was gonna be on so faith 7 that's very interesting so the next picture and we also know that brother Branham had during this time in 1962 he starts preaching the countdown amen showing us say men that we are the different stages Amen that this church has been moving that the church has been moving and now we're spiritual astronauts amen spiritual eagles that we can see anything amen praise God because we have that we have that we have the revelation of the word in this hour praise God now when you look at the magazine if those maybe you don't have don't have not looked at the magazine and page number 112 this is the the what's there and this is the article that's there and just I'm not gonna read all of this but just kind of highlight it this is hovering like a giant smoke ring a great cloud appeared at sunset over Flagstaff Arizona last February 28th and set off a continuing scientific mystery now the number 28 has a significance a man in God's and it's the number of life you man it's the number of life and what is the name of the magazine Life magazine so that's just a coincidence right brother Brennan was in a conspiracy with Life magazine and all that came out it gets better though instead off a continuing scientific mystery watcher struck by the clouds odd shape and huge size took pictures like these for at at different times and from widely scattered locations notice that if from almost every angle it looks like a pyramid kind of like a triangle tight dr. James McDonald the meteorologists at the Institute of atmospheric physics and Tucson has been accumulating the pictures using them as the basis for trigonometric calculation he has made a startling discovery that the cloud was at least 26 miles high and 30 miles across a lot higher and bigger he says then a cloud should be so is interesting that it's dr. James McDonald who you know he was an expert in clouds viewing clouds and he was the one who studied it and said that that that there wasn't any ordinary cloud at the at the spot where that cloud appeared clouds normally don't show up on there he says a lot higher and bigger he says than a cloud should be the circle was too high to be made by a jet plane and so far as planes as so far as dr. McDonald can determine there were no Rockets rocket planes or bombs being tested nearby that day he hopes anyone else with pictures will lend to him for he would like some more clues about the cloud 26 26 miles up no water droplets exist at that height to make a cloud so that was the article that was I was reading this right here that's what Life magazine put out amen so so we know that the number 28 is that is the number of life it's also the 28 is that is it 28 days in a woman's monthly cycle and according to eyewitnesses the cloud was shining for about 28 min and then you can see this in other and other magazines where this article came I came out where this was reported 28 minutes it was glistening and shining which is of course again very interesting because of the number 28 amen as it was it was coming it was it was shining over Sunset Mountain the evening time sunset mountain amen and and it was if you notice the the Sun was setting when when this but yet the cloud was still luminescent Amen enough for the picture to be taken amen so the Rays a man it shall be light in the evening time hey man it was still enough light a man to show a man that Christ a man was trying to proclaim something to us a man praise God alright now if you notice here it says and a high cloud ring of mystery now you notice when you look at when you see dot dot dot Amen that's normally that looks like with that some thing it was talking about something and then dot dot dot it can there's a continuation you see all right so if you look go over to the next picture I was look I was looking at this the other the other last summer with my wife and I knew this picture was there the page before this is this picture and it's an article that says rainbow of moonbeams amen and the article the article talks about I'm not going to read it but the article talks about that this picture was taken by him by the the light from the moon so the cameraman was took the picture that moon was a full moon behind him and there was a storm in the distance and so the lights of the of the of the of the moon were there and it created this rainbow now according to the article and what I was looking up online this is a very rare occurrence some this this hardly ever gets much less beat a picture be taking of it but yet it was taken and placed just right before the article about the cloud just right right before it amen so if you read in the article it was taken at this picture was taken at 11 o'clock at night right before midnight that's not a coincidence 11 o'clock and we are the 11th hour workers amen praise God like it's hard for me to read that article here and where this was taken was on and on the and in the state of Hawaii now if those tho Hawaii is the 50th state of the United States 50 of course is an important number to us it means do believe it amen praise God oh that's just a coincidence I don't think so amen now the word Hawaii means the homeland amen the homeland that's what the word Hawaii means and the picture was taken this picture was taken on the on the third largest island of hawaii called oahu and so my wife and me were reading and and and looking at this and we and she looked up and she what oh ah who meant and of course this is the third the third largest island of hawaii and of course three is a number of perfection so that's that's significant as well but Oahu means The Gathering Place Oh alga means the Gathering Place and so I think that's very interesting man praise God that we're to be gathered a men together God's trying to gather us together amen amen into one mine and to one Accord Amen so that we can get out of here st. so that the next step of the of this of the story could take place amen we're looking for a resurrection amen praise God so the the article says rainbow of Moon and then on the next picture if the brothers can bring it up and a high cloud ring of mystery so really it's one article you see cuz it's it's one right it's it's not two separate articles but it's one the person whoever was there put this together just so happen to just put these two together I don't think brother Branham called him up as hey can you put these two pictures together and bring them up together no I don't think that happened now I'm gonna just say this Saints that if that's if this is a conspiracy then then gods in it amen because this can't be done by anybody a man then just conjure this up then think of this up so you know to put this together but remember Saints that we have about a cloud of witnesses amen the Bible says a cloud of witnesses praise God so the articles that's a rainbow of moon beings and a high cloud ring of mystery and you see and is a conjunction it unites words together and sentences together amen and that's what God is doing in this hour amen he's uniting his bride to his head Amen that the capstone is coming down amen on top of the body and we are his body amen praise God we are the head we he is the head we are the body amen praise God now let's read revelations chapter 10 I hope that you're enjoying this praise God I don't know of any other way to talk about this but but this way amen I appreciate your your your your patience the brothers could bring it up revelations chapter 10 this is very in this is a very scripture that's very known well known to us now watch this and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud all right and what and and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun remember the cloud the rays of the Sun were still shining on the cloud so that the picture can be taken even though it was evening time and he had in his hand a little book open amen that's the most important part amen and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as where where a lion roars and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices Amen so if the brothers could bring up the next picture I I just happened I was when I was reading this with my wife and I I thought my so this before this was even I looked I looked this up online but it is confirmed by others on online and I said I wonder what happens when you when you put this cloud over this picture over into the light amen and that and if the brothers could bring up the next picture this might be old news to you but it's new news to me the next picture or did he already click it go back go back alright so when you when you hold this article into the light they man this is exactly what you see you see you see the rainbow Amen jumping over over the cloud the the the cloud amen exactly amen exactly what revelations chapter 10 talks about Amen if you have that magazine you can try it yourself I'm not going to attempt to try but I found these online that people had already done it and took pictures of it so if you hit the next picture if you rip out that that upper part where it says an acai clobbering of mystery this is exactly what that what that looks like right there I don't think that's a coincidence ain't Amen God amen declaring himself Amen as as the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God and using Life magazine as a witness amen as a witness to let us know amen that we're not believing cunningly devised fables amen again I don't think brother Brennan was in a conspiracy with Life magazine I just have a hard time believing there I mean and I don't I don't know maybe the person who put this together these two articles together was I don't know if he was a Christian or not probably probably wasn't God anointed amen or to put that together amen for you and I it's gonna be for the unbeliever it's just gonna make him be more of an unbeliever amen for the for the make believer is just gonna make them be more make-believe for the believer it helps us in our walk amen praise God now Saints I want you to keep in mind that this is not amen this is not what saves us this is not what feels this way the Holy Ghost amen this is just a sign they men pointing amen and we're gonna talk here just a moment about the voice of the sign amen because that's very important we need to be listening to the voice of the sign sometimes again signs and wonders we need them amen but it helps us but it's not what saves us amen and so sometimes we use these things a man as a comfort as a as a blanket amen for for our salvation and you can have this magazine in your and your in your house you can have every picture everything every diagram and you still not believe the word and you still not understand the word amen I hope you understand that so it's perfectly laying out what revelations tens one says Amen brother branham gets caught up into that cloud and he's told to go back east to preach the seals Amen now so we read in Revelations 10:1 and then further down in Revelations 10 7 if you want brothers want to bring that up revelations Tim 1 was the mighty angel which was G which is Jesus Christ comes down with the open book right because remembering in revelations 5 he was the only one that could open the seals thereof a man of that book he opened them now at revelations 10 and then but the mystery there was still mysteries there because the thunders the the the thunders roared and John was prohibited to not write what those thunders had said but in rib in that same chapter in Revelation chapter 10 verse 7 it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished amen and of course the magazine's also calls it a mystery amen but for us amen when when that's that's what brother Branham was to do amen was to reveal these mysteries they come from him it had to be God to give him a man what we needed for us to hear in this hour brother Brandon didn't know himself amen look what brother brown says here in this quote look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of God see the quickening power of God foretold this would take place the see the quickening power of God made the world testify to it it's the truth he's talking about this cloud here and this and this quote the angel the Lord I told you was around in a pillar of fire quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was and when you just looked this away and it's our Lord up there you see he is the one who opened those seals he is those he is those seals for the whole Word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing Christ amen revealing it and if it's very revealing Christ as those seals if that words in you then it's revealing Christ in you amen praise God and that's a mystery Paul said but it's a mystery to the world but it shouldn't be a mystery to us say Amen praise God the greatest mystery was Christ in you the hope of glory nope with the US with the open book Saints I mean we have so much to be thankful for amen so much to be thankful for so much amen so much to to - that has happened and that God has done for us to be bored to get bored with the word oh it's another service now Christ has done great things in this hour and he's still a man this the same yesterday today and forever praise God but brother Branham came on the scene on verse 7 right because we know that was brother Branham in Revelations 10 7 right but revelations 10 8 vs. 8 verses 8 through 11 that was the part that we need to do you know the Bible says there in revelations 10 verses 8 it says and the voice which I heard from heaven this is John speaking and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take that little book so it wasn't enough for the book to be open Saints it was great that it was opened and it wasn't enough for then the next step amen remember the hot the cloud that the mighty angel came down and opened a book so the cloud came down it showed itself there in all over Arizona that was wonderful brother Branham went over to Jeffersonville Indiana preached the seals the seals were opened amen that's wonderful but what's the next step it's for us to eat up those seals as for us to eat that word amen now though he asked me the other day he wants us to eat a book my Zoey yes he wants us to eat a book not a literal book he wants us to eat the life of the book hey man cuz you can eat this book and you can or you can ingest it physically reading it the letter killeth but the spirit is the one that gives lives amen praise God so it says in the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and take the little book which is opening the angel hand of the angel which stand it upon the sea and upon the earth a man and as brother branham had to obey the Lord the voice of the Lord that told him when he went up into that cloud and that constellation go and the seals will need it to be preached they men and he went he needed to fulfill that he needed to obey same thing for us when the voice is speaking unto us amen when the voice is speaking unto us and verse 8 that's exactly what we need to do we need to eat this book amen I hope you understand what I'm trying to say basica amen in verse 9 it continues to say and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up it's free take it you didn't have to pay anything for it God did it all they meant he took care of it praise God and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey verse 10 and I took the little book out of the Angels hand it was it was the mighty angel amen and ate it up amen brother branham he can't spoon feed us Amen he's given us the word he's he's he's given us the word amen but it takes you amen to take the book grab it and do something with it they meant it takes you to get a personal revelation from God I can't depend on brother Dale to give me a revelation he can't brother we´d can't give me a revelation another minister can't give a relation but God amen whoo I'm grabbing the book from can give me a revelation praise God Christ can give me a revelation of that book and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings and I believe that's what the Bride of Christ is doing right now the true fivefold ministry in this hour amen that's exactly what we're doing amen praise God it doesn't have to be the fivefold ministry Saints praise God you have a were a sure word of a in this hour of prophecy in this hour amen take advantage of the word and the word will fight for you praise God so we need to obey Saints the voice of the sign praise God and I'm almost done we need to obey what that voice said all right the sign was good praise God for the sign thank God that God showed himself a man he's got witnesses witnesses have the guy with the cigarette and he's got witnesses in this hour we're witnesses amen Life magazine was a witness oh my god did but it's time for us to eat the book sentence it's time for us to get the life the true life of Christ amen watch what brother Branham says the voice of the sign in 1964 Noah a prophet on the land in the land a sign of the coming judgement Moses a prophet in the land the sign of a coming judgment elijah prophet in the land sign of coming judgment john a prophet in the land a sign of coming judgment to israel they were absolutely cut off notice sign what does the sign do the sign is to attract the attention and get the elected ready and out of the way before judgment strikes that's what that sign was amen that's what Noah did it got the elected ready the rest of them and what does it do the sign and the voice of the sign condemns the unbeliever and gets him ready for judgment see Saints the same water that saved Noah in the boat is the same water that condemned the unbelievers in that hour that same water that helped raise the the boat up and saved Noah it drowned the unbelievers in that hour see and this sign Amen that is a blessing and a grace grace unto us a manna for the believer but it's a judgment sign for the unbeliever for the world you see the sign and the voice of the sign condemns the unbeliever and gets him ready for judgment it gets the elected ready for this for the escape that's what sign is that's what signs are given for for the coming judgment to the elected they see it Amen praise the Lord Jesus amen aren't you thankful that you can see it in this hour praise God many people cannot see that many people cannot cannot cannot break these things down and look at God hid it in such a way that they can't do it instead they'll criticize it but blessed are your eyes for they see praise God now we'll finish my it's awesome I was able to finish up I thought I had a lot of a lot of stuff and I guess I I just went really fast Hebrews chapter 12 let's just read that again to kind of seal the the thing here again wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so a great with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the sin which does so easily beset us Saints God has done so much for us amen for us to be dilly-dallying with the things of the world for us to be in sin in this hour the sign has already been given judgment is getting ready to strike they could come at any moment for you to say I'll serve God in about 10 years 10 years may not happen I'll serve God next year next year may not happen I'll serve God in in next week next week may not happen for you they may happen to others but it may not happen to you because you are not guaranteed to live the next five minutes I am NOT Gary to live the next five minutes but that sign has already said that there's judgment coming in men and if you don't believe the sign amen if you don't believe that sign that God has sent amen in other words that has take us to the voice of the sign amen the word amen in this hour to apply the word into your life so that God can do something great through you I'm afraid the only thing left is judgment that's the only thing left because God has already given us everything that we need God has already done everything that he could for you and I he's died on the cross he's paid the way for you and if you reject it and you keep rejecting there will be one day where you will reject it for the last time you will reject it for the last time and there will be no more mercy for you then you're gonna have to depend on going in through your works then and I don't want to go in by that because my the Bible already says that my works are like filthy rags before God's eyes my works are like filthy rags before God's eyes I want to go in and his marriage Saints I'm gonna go in with what he's already done see we complicate the thing when God has already made a way easy for us ensure Saints the Christian life is not easy whoever said that the Christian life was easy is lying to you or they're trying to take your money because that's not the case all of you who are true Christians know that that's the case it's a mind battle every single day Satan is battling you and if you don't have that battle in your mind then God has not been doing something in you but it's got if you're if that battle is there and then your wrestling event day by day trying to defeat this flesh trying to defeat yourself dying out to yourself a man then God a man I believe God is doing something in you I believe God is doing something no man let us lay aside every weight in other words when the runners Paul speaking here of when runners were running the races back then in the stadiums and you know running the races they would get a get rid of every weight off of them some of them probably even shaving their hair off their skin to take every weight off so that they can run the race and man and get to that finish line praise God and that's what Paul is telling us let us lay aside every weight and the sin the unbelief which does so easily beset us the unbelief so easily besets our life in other words sin so easily creeps in into our life it's so easy for sin and then it's so hard to get rid of it amen when you've already let it just just a rock you to sleep once you're in it it's hard to get out of it but it's not impossible because God's made the way amen in the sin which this so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us let us be patient Saints God has done his part let us do our part let us be patient God's not selective fulfill his promises looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith looking unto Him remember the boy who was riding the bicycle a man and the others did not make it to the end of the race and they asked him how did you win the race he said I just kept my eyes on the finish line on the mark of the high calling amen Christ Jesus amen praise God not looking to anything else not looking to the world not looking to the music of the world not looking to the movies of the world not looking to everything else going on around us coronavirus or no coronavirus it doesn't matter God has come down on the scene amen God has manifest as himself through his word amen all the coronavirus can be right at the door but the Bible says that no plague shall dwell not dwelling come nigh thy dwelling amen praise God and if God's not ready to take you a man then you're not gonna go amen looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith that's why he's the Alpha and the Omega verse 3 for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds praise God Saints it's not time Saints too slack it's not time to to to let's look at these things amen let's remember what God has done so that it can help us amen to move forward with what God is doing now amen praise God I'm so thankful they meant that God's moving in a month many membered bride amen and he is the head praise guy how many loved a lot a mess so let's stand to our feet tonight let's just give the Lord a clap of praise thank you Lord Jesus I appreciate your your patience and I appreciate listening and I hope I didn't bore you but there's just a little something that that you know it they just what it should help us amen that we're not following our obeying because cunningly devices saying so many people are just falling around us people that the people that you wouldn't have thought that they would go that way 40 years 50 years and the message believing and preaching it and then all of a sudden that they don't believe it anymore but blessed are your eyes and blessed are your eyes for they see these things I believe that we should be praying for those people amen I believe that I believe that maybe they're just going through phases amen because God can be the one to open eyes you and I can't Amen but God
