[0:00] what is of juner I'm sorry
[0:05] Jer we'll have to look that
[0:08] up burn in juniper tree soon you talking
[0:12] about the smell of it for those of you
[0:15] that
[0:16] uh all right turn on here thank you we
[0:20] got we got we cooking with grease now
[0:24] people but uh but if you did bring your
[0:27] book go to paragraph 328 if you want to
[0:29] read along if not you read right
[0:35] here I don't remember that pole
[0:38] being middle it uh it hadn't move mom
[0:43] that go way can you see that
[0:50] now over turn it that
[0:53] way way can y'all see it listen you can
[0:58] see that an angle
[1:03] I'm
[1:06] okay all right now we've been talking
[1:09] about the Statue of perfect man now
[1:10] we're going to read what the prophet
[1:11] says and we're going to read and then
[1:13] we'll make some comments but I want to
[1:15] get to the Blasphemous names
[1:18] part and listen
[1:20] there's this is tricky to understand
[1:23] it's like brother Louise said last
[1:24] Sunday many people in the message many
[1:27] people in the message teach that you get
[1:30] that you got to get all these virtues
[1:31] before you get the Holy
[1:33] Spirit a lot of people yeah okay right M
[1:37] that's right A lot of people do and and
[1:40] that's not true at all that's not
[1:42] according to the Bible it's not
[1:43] according to the prophet's message okay
[1:45] so if it I've got two witnesses there
[1:48] that's enough for me right and the
[1:51] teaching of this church is you must be
[1:53] born again at faith that when you get to
[1:55] this holy spirit that is an anointing
[1:59] not different from the holy spirit that
[2:01] you received but it is to a degree a
[2:04] little bit different because it's
[2:06] anointing that comes on you I'll read it
[2:08] in just a minute watch this but we'll go
[2:10] to if we got enough time we'll go to
[2:11] Blasphemous
[2:13] name cuz brother Bram says the true
[2:15] baptism now this one down here wasn't
[2:17] false
[2:19] that's but now Revelations 3:14 says the
[2:22] faithful and true witness Jesus talking
[2:24] about Jesus that didn't mean he was
[2:26] false at one time and become true that
[2:28] meant he was true all way through I
[2:31] understand that brother Brown explained
[2:32] that in the in the um Church age book he
[2:36] said the faithful and true witness not
[2:38] that everything else was false or that
[2:39] he was false and become true cuz see in
[2:42] our brain we go well this is false but
[2:45] it become true right you can't take
[2:47] something that's false and make it
[2:50] true you can't that's right if it's
[2:53] false it's like Brother D talking about
[2:54] Wednesday night if it's true it's true
[2:57] if it's false it's false okay now
[2:59] remember trly we were false in our
[3:04] birth okay right but the true baptism of
[3:08] the Holy Ghost okay came to us at a new
[3:10] birth all right right to make us
[3:14] positive okay to make us positive but
[3:17] then there's anointing that that comes
[3:19] on because
[3:21] remember there's got to be anointing of
[3:23] this Holy
[3:25] Spirit to take you into a different
[3:28] level that must most people will never
[3:32] see um most all these Church age
[3:36] Messengers will never see past that or
[3:39] have never seen past that they're
[3:40] already gone on they can't attain to
[3:42] that that's why Paul said they without
[3:44] us cannot be made perfect they without
[3:46] us cannot be made perfect all right so
[3:49] that doesn't mean that we're false down
[3:50] here and then we become perfect no we we
[3:54] receive the
[3:55] perfect perfect New Birth in our soul
[3:59] but now
[4:01] remember our spirit still has memory
[4:04] reason reasoning there's no reasoning in
[4:06] the center realm the center realm is
[4:09] either Faith or doubt that's right
[4:11] there's no reasoning in the center realm
[4:13] if you reason on the word of God you're
[4:16] reasoning in your spirit that's right
[4:18] right right that's right you can't
[4:20] reason in your soul that's right that
[4:22] soul is the perfect word of God that
[4:25] never sined a day in his life amen
[4:27] Hebrews 13:8 like Brother D was talking
[4:29] about w not Jesus Christ came yesterday
[4:31] today and forever that Soul that's in
[4:33] you now it's not your soul that came
[4:35] somewhere that's God's Soul right come
[4:39] to you at the new birth right brother R
[4:42] said vulcanize the only time he ever
[4:43] says vulcanize is in this statute
[4:45] perfect man vulcanize that together and
[4:48] you and him become one as person so
[4:50] you're not that's why brother said I
[4:51] don't believe in pre-existence of Soul
[4:53] so we weren't pre-existing in the in the
[4:55] condition that that you had a soul and
[4:57] you were walking around on Earth on up
[4:59] in glory and you had a soul because you
[5:01] were predestinated no you were
[5:03] predestinated in the gene of God the
[5:06] gene seed of God like me um just we're
[5:10] all adults here males have sperm right
[5:14] now I don't have all the sperm I'm going
[5:16] to need for the rest of my life to
[5:18] produce children now you sisters have
[5:21] all the eggs right so you've got all the
[5:24] eggs your egg you're not going to
[5:25] produce any more eggs they're all laying
[5:27] in you somewhere but now ale if you'll
[5:31] if you'll study this a male sperm is
[5:34] produced from the spinal
[5:37] cord yeah the blood is like brother it's
[5:41] highly conal blood the blood is
[5:43] compacted together and by a chemical
[5:45] process goes down into the testicles
[5:48] okay I mean I'm I'm making a point I
[5:49] want you to realize something but
[5:51] remember Josh was not in me in that
[5:55] sperm
[5:56] form when I was in my day because sperm
[6:00] if you don't use
[6:01] it let's be plain it's it's it comes out
[6:05] sometimes during sex and all the things
[6:06] like that well see that's that's all
[6:08] seed that's right but there was one that
[6:11] was
[6:12] predestinated that come Josh Dale but
[6:15] now but Josh Dale couldn't be me
[6:17] couldn't be in me in sperm form that's
[6:19] why brother BR said you were in your
[6:20] great great grandfather you weren't in
[6:22] your great great great grandfather as a
[6:25] that as a as sperm form you were in
[6:28] genetic form your jeans the jeans that
[6:32] you
[6:33] have come on in yeah we I knew they were
[6:36] coming I just didn't know when they
[6:37] going to get
[6:39] here and we have a molecular biologist
[6:43] with us today and she's going to explain
[6:49] DNA I left the spot for you for you no
[6:54] put you on the spot
[6:58] listen you're already standing up tell
[7:00] every by your name Grace okay that's
[7:03] sister Grace and she go she goes to
[7:06] brother Jean Williams Church in uh
[7:10] Anderson okay and then you stand up and
[7:12] tell them your name hi I'm Shan she's a
[7:15] Florida
[7:17] F
[7:19] yeah no and your sister I'm Christina hi
[7:24] you stand up CH she's Christina
[7:27] Christin I'm Dena
[7:31] amen good to meet him good to have you
[7:33] with us today and everybody knows his
[7:41] Chris but as we were talking about it's
[7:44] genetic form it's Gene form that we are
[7:47] in not in a in an act okay so as we're
[7:51] born again we're born again we're we
[7:54] come from the gene of
[7:56] God cuz remember God doesn't have sperm
[8:02] he doesn't he's spoken word but the
[8:05] genetic form that we are comes from the
[8:08] Bible it comes from the strands that was
[8:10] in God that genesis: 126 man let us make
[8:15] man in our own image well now the reason
[8:17] that my son looks like me the reason he
[8:19] was created in my image is because he
[8:23] has my genetic makeup that's why he
[8:25] doesn't look like Bob's kid right he
[8:27] looks like my kids cuz he came from my
[8:29] genetic makeup so we come from the
[8:32] genetic makeup of God now we come human
[8:36] form right become human form babies born
[8:41] just like we were talking about there in
[8:42] the Bible from the fruit of the womb
[8:45] which was the mother all right but when
[8:47] we come to be born again we're born
[8:49] again Jesus said from
[8:51] above Nicodemus said do I need to go
[8:53] back into my mother's womb well see he
[8:54] was thinking natural thoughts but God
[8:57] said no you got to be born from above so
[8:59] the the quickening power of God the gene
[9:01] seed of God had to come to Quicken
[9:05] you bir you into another
[9:08] family remember it's out of and into two
[9:11] right you got to come out of this family
[9:13] right brother said I'm not the son of
[9:15] Charles n Bram I'm a Son of God now he
[9:18] didn't deny where he came from you
[9:20] couldn't cuz his mom say no I know he
[9:22] came from me but when he realized that
[9:24] the one inside of him was so much God
[9:29] till he said no I'm a Son of God so this
[9:33] when we start down here at the bottom of
[9:35] the pyramid you are a son of God you
[9:38] have the genetic makeup of
[9:41] God that's right amen we believe in this
[9:45] church you get born again here and then
[9:46] you go up through this process of growth
[9:50] development all right now here your
[9:52] newborn babies Romans 8 says we won't
[9:55] put it up there but Romans 8 says 8 says
[9:58] what you you receive the spirit of
[10:00] adoption see this is adoption here right
[10:04] this is adoption this is not adoption
[10:07] you come into the family you receive the
[10:09] spirit of adoption in other words I
[10:11] can't adopt Ryan's children sure
[10:14] Naturally I could if something happened
[10:15] to them too and they passed away I'd
[10:17] adopt his kids that's natural but I
[10:19] can't adopt his kids because they're his
[10:23] kids so God can't adopt the devil's kid
[10:26] cuz they're not his they're not part of
[10:28] that Genesis 126 man but if you're part
[10:31] of that Genesis 126 man you receive the
[10:33] spirit of adoption whereby you cry cry
[10:37] out by father crying as
[10:39] baby right Paul says you can drink milk
[10:43] but you need the sincere meat you need
[10:45] the meat of the word so that Spirit of
[10:47] adoption is the holy spirit we receive
[10:50] that's correct Spirit of adoption right
[10:53] because you in other words you're in
[10:55] line for adoption if you're not born
[10:58] again you're not going to be in line for
[11:00] adoption right just because you're in
[11:02] the message and been in the message 30
[11:04] years message has no seniority this
[11:06] message has zero seniority somebody
[11:09] could come in the message and be in the
[11:11] message 30 years just use you for an
[11:13] example we grew up together sister Fred
[11:15] and I did and and now things are being
[11:18] quickened to you that may be it was
[11:20] quickened to somebody else that may be
[11:22] only in the message a year right so God
[11:24] he does so he's not a respector of
[11:26] person but when you make yourself
[11:28] available for the word
[11:29] right see you got to make yourselfself
[11:31] available because we're not going to get
[11:33] into this weekend this week but the word
[11:37] is the seed you're looking
[11:39] at see the word this is the genetic
[11:42] makeup of God this is the only thing we
[11:43] got to go
[11:45] by this is the if you want to see my
[11:47] genetic makeup look at my kids if you
[11:49] want to see God's genetic makeup look at
[11:51] his
[11:52] kids but we have to reflect back to here
[11:55] right because the remember the so went
[11:58] out to what so
[12:00] seed right and the disciple says well
[12:02] what are you talking about he said then
[12:04] he broke it down he said okay the so is
[12:06] the son of man what that's God in human
[12:09] flesh a
[12:11] preacher hello a preacher we don't
[12:14] believe God in human flesh is Jesus
[12:17] 2,000 years ago or William brand 50
[12:19] years ago I believe if you're born again
[12:21] you got your God in human flesh standing
[12:23] here today if you're going to hear like
[12:25] we talking about down in in Mobile
[12:28] that's a little but they got it good if
[12:30] you're going to hear from MDC you're
[12:32] going to hear from him through me right
[12:34] that's right cuz MDC was God in human
[12:37] flesh preaching to Abraham amen amen
[12:40] amen so if you're going to hear it from
[12:42] Brother je forny this morning that's God
[12:44] in human flesh talking to you there's
[12:46] MDC the priest remember he's a high
[12:49] priest MDC is a high priest he's the one
[12:50] that's talking to you he talked to
[12:52] Abraham didn't he right amen amen so
[12:55] this is the gene seed of God right here
[12:57] right it's not some little seed runs
[12:59] around somewhere and it's in your body
[13:00] somewhere this is it here cuz the sewer
[13:03] went out and Seed the seed cast it threw
[13:06] it out some fell on good ground some
[13:09] fell on ground that was hard some fell
[13:11] on ground that didn't get watered very
[13:15] well it's the situation that you put it
[13:19] in it's the situation you put the seed
[13:22] you know I can take seed out there and I
[13:23] go what I found in concrete and say oh
[13:25] dear Lord give me a
[13:27] crop right
[13:30] I'm doing it a miss or I'm doing it I'm
[13:32] doing it by iniquity cuz I know better I
[13:35] know the law the law says you got to put
[13:38] it in the ground it's got to have
[13:40] moisture it's got to have warmth for it
[13:42] to crack that seed and to bring the life
[13:44] out okay that's the same thing with the
[13:46] statute of a perfect
[13:47] man we're born again here at Faith and
[13:51] then add to your faith add to your faith
[13:54] you see what Peter says add to your
[13:55] faith so in other words it's my
[13:58] possession brother say this is my eye
[14:00] God gave it to me right okay it's God's
[14:03] holy ghost but when he give it to me
[14:05] it's mine he's not an Indian giver so he
[14:08] don't want it back he wants me to give
[14:10] it to somebody else okay so you come up
[14:14] through here and we're going to read now
[14:16] we've already come up and for those of
[14:17] you that that are that are new today
[14:19] we've already been through this is
[14:22] number 63 so we've been 63 Sundays on
[14:26] this statute of perfect man starting at
[14:29] faith and going all the way up to
[14:30] brotherly kindness and we're right here
[14:31] where it says Holy
[14:33] Spirit and many people teach that you
[14:36] have to get all these virtues to get the
[14:37] Holy Spirit we do not believe that
[14:39] because the prophet didn't teach it or
[14:40] the Bible doesn't teach it you have to
[14:42] take everything back to the Bible second
[14:45] Peter says having the divine nature of
[14:47] God add to your faith now what's the
[14:50] divine nature of God that's right that's
[14:52] a new birth you can't be divine without
[14:55] having God the devil's not Divine that's
[14:57] right if the Divine divine nature see
[15:00] there's that nature that comes the gene
[15:03] yes right I walk like my grandfather um
[15:06] Mama's daddy of course I can't see
[15:08] behind me thank God but when I walk she
[15:10] says you walk like your grandpa the
[15:12] reason I walk like my grandpa is cuz I
[15:14] have his genetic makeup in
[15:16] me okay you understand what I mean so
[15:18] The Way We
[15:21] Walk it's because we have the genetic
[15:23] makeup of our father that's right that's
[15:25] right because remember New Jer Jalem is
[15:30] your mother the scripture says ain't
[15:32] that pretty girl that's my grandbaby not
[15:36] this one that
[15:38] one
[15:44] easy genetic makeup of God is Faith CU
[15:47] that's what at the bottom these are the
[15:49] traits these are the Hey listen these
[15:51] are family traits okay okay we a't got
[15:56] into that we got to get closer to the
[15:57] family part now but these are family
[16:00] traits right right that's right each
[16:04] family has a different trait that's
[16:06] right each some some family you know
[16:08] like to do this and that and the other
[16:10] and we're all different as far as
[16:11] humanly genetically make up our genetic
[16:13] make up different but when we receive
[16:16] the soul of God that takes us out should
[16:20] takes us out of that human nature right
[16:23] kills the nature not the soul kills the
[16:25] nature that's on that Soul that's right
[16:28] amen man you kill the soul you die
[16:30] that's right so it kills the nature
[16:32] that's attached to that Soul cuz when
[16:34] you were born into this world you
[16:35] received the nature that what that was
[16:37] contrary to God Amen cuz you were born
[16:40] contrary to God why Jesus told nicodem
[16:43] said you must be born again cuz you
[16:44] weren't born right the first time right
[16:46] Jesus but now remember Jesus could say
[16:49] that because he was born right he was
[16:51] born spoken word that's right so he
[16:54] could say You must be born again he
[16:55] didn't say Nicodemus mean you need to be
[16:57] born again he said you need to be born
[16:59] again and then when Nicodemus took the
[17:01] carnal application said well I got to go
[17:03] back in my mother's womb be born again
[17:04] he said no you got to be born from above
[17:06] right so this is being born from above
[17:10] and then we
[17:12] display the attributes are the genetic
[17:15] makeup of God because remember in
[17:18] scripture in the scripture you see all
[17:22] these words right you see all these
[17:25] traits and characteristics all up the
[17:27] statue of perfect man and thank God that
[17:30] that God sent a prophet that could put
[17:32] the thing together for us cuz Peter even
[17:35] Peter couldn't stand there when he wrote
[17:38] it and and put it together like
[17:41] this right that's right that's right he
[17:45] couldn't that's right he had a partial
[17:47] Revelation on what he spoke right right
[17:50] CU Paul had a partial Revelation he said
[17:52] we which are alive and remain that's
[17:54] right well he ain't a we no more that's
[17:57] right he's not a we he's dead he's
[17:59] waiting on WE that's right waiting on us
[18:01] to come to what Perfection right right
[18:05] be therefore perfect or complete this is
[18:08] completeness but let's
[18:11] read we didn't get to it last week
[18:13] hardly going to get to it this week I
[18:15] get to talking too
[18:17] much well you are that clock is
[18:21] fast okay now in building The Virtue
[18:25] building this Monument building this
[18:27] stature not a statue
[18:29] right a statue doesn't move that's
[18:33] right stature is growth development
[18:36] that's right like we were talking about
[18:37] giving the keys of the car to a kid for
[18:40] those of you that are new we did it last
[18:42] week see when you were say Zoe there's
[18:46] Zoe there give her the keys and let her
[18:48] drive your car let her drive your car
[18:50] she got to all that fart you
[18:53] call I told you I was going to pick
[18:56] on well now wait a minute she's got the
[18:59] same ears you have she's a human she's
[19:02] got a nose two eyes she has the
[19:05] capability of having
[19:06] children but in the form she's in baby
[19:10] form yeah she can't produce like an
[19:13] adult right but wait a minute she's a
[19:16] human she's got two legs she can touch
[19:18] the gas metal if you get her down there
[19:20] far enough she touch The Brak well why
[19:22] can't we give her the
[19:23] key cuz she's a baby she has not
[19:27] developed enough
[19:29] mentality to handle the situation of
[19:32] driving a car but yet she can yet she
[19:34] has all the ability to do it same way
[19:37] with God when you're born again you're
[19:39] born into the body of Christ you have
[19:41] all these potentially M right all right
[19:45] I said potentially you have all these
[19:48] right cuz God don't sit there and and
[19:51] you know hand stuff out like cards
[19:53] that's right right but remember the
[19:55] teaspoon of the ocean has the same
[19:57] ingredients of the ocean but it's in a
[19:59] small quantity that's right but see God
[20:01] wants us to step out of that teaspoon
[20:04] and get into the
[20:05] ocean this is the ocean okay okay but
[20:08] you got the same makeup she's got the
[20:10] same makeup as all you sisters in here
[20:13] right but she's not her growth
[20:14] development has not come to a place to
[20:16] where she can be mature enough to handle
[20:20] the situation of driving or being a
[20:21] mother or all these other things you
[20:23] understand what I'm saying so the I what
[20:25] I do is is the natural things I see I
[20:27] can put it in the Bible and I can put it
[20:28] in prophet's message because he said an
[20:31] illiterate person can receive the Holy
[20:32] Ghost that's somebody can't even read so
[20:34] you must have to be able to see to
[20:36] understand see to understand all right
[20:39] so we see that you're given the ability
[20:42] once you move into this family watch now

[21:19] somewhere but they the original drawing
[21:21] that brother random Drew there's
[21:23] squiggly lines that go down through here
[21:24] from this holy
[21:27] spirit so that's what what he saying
[21:29] right
[21:29] here here these little waves come what
[21:32] is that the holy ghost coming down
[21:34] through Christ SE Holy Spirit the holy
[21:36] spirit is above all this welding this
[21:40] together what did we talk about last
[21:42] Sunday to weld something you need two
[21:47] pieces you can't weld just one piece
[21:49] where you going to weld it to you got to
[21:51] have two pieces so it's you m and God
[21:55] the Holy Ghost welding all this together
[21:59] and sealing it in so this is this is the
[22:03] holy spirit Christ coming down Christ is
[22:06] what the anointed so he's going to
[22:08] anoint you with these virtues seal you
[22:12] in now
[22:14] listen the holy ghost coming down
[22:16] through Christ the Holy Spirit the holy
[22:17] spirit is above all this welding This
[22:21] Together building a what an almost
[22:24] perfect
[22:26] Church wait a second perfect oh perfect
[22:29] church for the Capstone to cap it off
[22:32] because remember that's got to come down
[22:39] here that's that's why Christ has to
[22:42] come here before we go there it's not us
[22:44] coming up here we come to a place it's
[22:47] God coming
[22:50] down Christ came down in
[22:53] 1963 two brother ranom but has he come
[22:56] to you right you got to have an
[22:58] experience like brother Bram had not an
[23:00] experience of a prophetic experience but
[23:03] you got to have an experience if God's
[23:04] going to say and and let me say this one
[23:08] make this one statement even Jesus
[23:09] Christ when he came up to the River
[23:11] Jordan we know he didn't need the Holy
[23:13] Ghost cuz he was born with it or he
[23:15] couldn't tell Nicodemus you must be born
[23:16] again but there was a there was a Dove
[23:19] came down and a voice from Heaven said
[23:21] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[23:23] pleased to dwell
[23:25] stop right he say hear ye him heop he
[23:28] said this is my beloved Son in whom I
[23:29] pleased to dwell well you know what God
[23:32] said the same thing the day you got born
[23:34] again he said this is my beloved Son our
[23:36] daughter in whom I'm pleased to dwell if
[23:38] God give you the new New Birth there's
[23:40] something about you he's pleased to
[23:42] dwell okay but now you go on several
[23:46] years later Jesus had to walk brother B
[23:50] said and even the Bible says he grew in
[23:51] Grace and knowledge and favor with man
[23:55] and the Bible says being made perfect
[23:57] now Jesus didn't need need to be made
[23:59] perfect in his soul that's right or his
[24:01] Spirit but he had to bring that body
[24:02] under subjection right right that's
[24:05] right so he comes up through here and
[24:06] then he comes up into Matthew
[24:09] 17 up on a
[24:12] mountain and God comes down now and says
[24:15] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[24:16] pleased to dwell hear ye him in other
[24:20] words I have instilled everything that I
[24:22] need into this man right here and if
[24:24] you're going to get anything from me the
[24:27] father if you're going to get anything
[24:28] from me you're going to get it through
[24:29] that guy right there so they so God
[24:32] takes brother Bram he comes to this
[24:33] position brother Bram comes up to a
[24:37] mountain and God said this is my beloved
[24:39] Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell here ye
[24:40] him amen go back to Jeffersonville cuz
[24:43] see this is the seals this is not the
[24:46] seals people for those new ones uh Paul
[24:50] had all this Peter had all this he
[24:53] couldn't preach about it right right see
[24:54] we're not coming to brother brand
[24:56] brought us up to a place and if he would
[24:59] have stopped right here there would have
[25:00] had to been somebody come cuz the
[25:02] headstone has got to come
[25:05] amen
[25:06] right so brother Brown said not in the
[25:08] years of preparation this is getting us
[25:10] ready to receive this that's right this
[25:13] is getting the flesh under this is
[25:15] getting the flesh under and the spirit
[25:17] cuz remember see our spirit is not the
[25:19] Holy Spirit that's right right our
[25:20] spirit has memory reason right conscious
[25:23] affection imagination there's none of
[25:26] that in God as far as the your birth
[25:29] right cuzz you can't you can't imagine
[25:32] having the Holy Ghost now you either got
[25:34] it or you don't that's right but that's
[25:36] the filter that we're talking about we
[25:38] several weeks ago we talked about the
[25:40] filter cuz if you got God in here and
[25:42] there's the new birth now that's God
[25:44] Genesis 1:26 man that never sin a day in
[25:46] its life if you're born again that's
[25:48] what you have in your soul right but
[25:50] since we've been born into this Fallen
[25:53] condition our body and
[25:56] spirit and soul needed Redemption right
[26:00] but the soul gets redeemed first right
[26:02] when you're born again your soul is
[26:03] redeemed it's not faith and
[26:06] doubt that's right it's Faith or doubt
[26:09] that's right one of the two doubt or
[26:12] faith then you come out into the second
[26:14] realm which is five senses memory reason
[26:15] conscious F and Imagination now listen
[26:18] it doesn't matter about the first
[26:21] five the first five just giv you to
[26:24] contact this world see taste feel smell
[26:27] and hear and you can abs absolutely fool
[26:29] all five of those senses right right go
[26:33] to a magician or go to some a hypnotist
[26:35] or something they can fool those five
[26:38] senses right so that's just given to you
[26:40] as a filter to contact the world you see
[26:42] through your eyes but God wants you to
[26:45] see that's right not see through your
[26:47] eyes that's right but see through your
[26:49] heart right okay but the memory reason
[26:52] conscious effects and Imagination my
[26:55] problem is in my reasoning my memory of
[26:58] what I did before I got bornn again cuz
[27:01] it didn't go away right but you got to
[27:03] bring it under subjection that's right
[27:05] right conscious
[27:07] M imagination there's no imagination in
[27:10] God that's right so what God has to do
[27:12] is is he has to come
[27:14] down through all that and birth you and
[27:17] then work his way back
[27:19] out through your memory reason conscious
[27:21] faction imagination cuz you're using
[27:23] your memory now and your reasoning to
[27:25] reason out what I'm saying that's true
[27:28] and either it either like brother BR
[27:30] said it either that symbol goes ding or
[27:32] it goes
[27:33] bong one of the two but you're working
[27:36] back out that's right you're working
[27:39] back out through the senses but Satan
[27:41] can still get all the way down into that
[27:43] Spirit realm and that's where the flu
[27:46] are memory reason conscious faction
[27:48] imagination that's the Devil's
[27:49] Playground right but also God has to use
[27:53] them for you to contact him are we
[27:57] reasoning together right now we're
[27:58] reasoning together right now which is
[28:00] not bad if you're if you're doing it
[28:03] from a spiritual aspect but if you're
[28:05] reasoning saying well this man over here
[28:08] said I don't care what that man said if
[28:11] if brother Bram said and the Bible said
[28:13] you got to be born again before you
[28:15] receive these you got to be in a family
[28:17] before you receive these
[28:18] things you can't be the devil's kids and
[28:21] have these virtues and be Godly
[28:23] virtues these are divine nature of God
[28:27] not just nature I mean there are some
[28:29] people that have worldly knowledge
[28:32] that's true but this ain't worldly
[28:33] knowledge this is the knowledge of
[28:34] almighty God to reason right right or
[28:38] wrong because you're going to set up
[28:39] there brother J for is going to be
[28:40] preaching and you're going to reason
[28:42] whether he's preaching the truth or
[28:45] error I mean we've been some of us for
[28:47] sure have been sitting in other churches
[28:50] and hear a false Doctrine I heard and
[28:52] something go
[28:54] off uncertain sound if it didn't right
[28:57] it's an uncertain sound but if something
[28:58] don't go off you're in trouble that's
[29:00] right that's right cuz I've been here
[29:01] I've heard one we were at one place and
[29:03] I tell you this before we leave 600
[29:05] people were in the crowd and they were
[29:07] up shouting except for about eight of us
[29:09] and I thought God are we so wrong yeah
[29:12] you Tre was there too it was false it
[29:16] was false I wasn't going to amen
[29:18] something that false tell what they said
[29:21] I don't don't matter you got to reason
[29:23] that out
[29:25] yourself but I thought are we that wrong
[29:27] and some spoke and says no fear not
[29:29] little flock that's right but something
[29:32] rang in my heart that said that's not
[29:35] the truth now buddy if that's the holy
[29:37] ghost that ain't the devil cuz the devil
[29:39] will agree with eror before he'll deal
[29:41] before he'll agree with truth that's why
[29:43] they were all shouting I'm not calling
[29:44] them all Devils but they were in a
[29:46] deception right they had their flu had
[29:48] been stopped up cuz you can be in error
[29:50] and have the Holy Ghost okay so you
[29:52] can't be all wrong and just be of the
[29:54] devil no you can have the Holy Ghost and
[29:57] be wrong wrong in your Doctrine for a
[29:59] little while but if truth is ever
[30:01] presented to you like Martin Luther let
[30:03] me finish with this Martin Luther
[30:05] preached a just yah by faith now look if
[30:07] Martin if I was to come and preach
[30:09] Martin Luther's Doctrine
[30:11] today it'd be
[30:14] Antichrist that's right true because he
[30:17] baptized in the name of father son
