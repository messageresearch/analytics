[2:28] brother Michael you're supposed to help
[2:30] me yeah Brown explains it and now sama
[2:39] and the one that found it Bethlehem I
[2:42] hit on my bullet but I don't have that
[2:44] stuff you know
[2:49] and it he talks about why would the
[2:54] gutter heaven pick a small town like
[2:56] Bethlehem to have his son won so he
[2:59] talks about different people like God
[3:15] well let's read a scripture why he
[3:27] [Music]
[3:35] Micah
[3:39] chapter 2 chapter 5 verse 2 he said by
[3:45] no no where's my Bible Bethlehem Ephraim
[3:57] though be little among the thousands of
[4:00] Judah yet thee shall he come forth unto
[4:03] me that is to be the ruler in Israel
[4:06] which going from heaven from have been
[4:10] from old from everlasting in what
[4:19] stretcher with that hmm what's picture
[4:21] was that my cup 5 first to
[4:47] the chapter four we started from 13 to
[4:58] 17
[5:03] so boy has to room and she was at what
[5:07] and he went into her the Lord gave her
[5:10] conception and she bare as son and the
[5:13] woman said unto Naomi let's be the lord
[5:16] three said not let be that they without
[5:19] a king spent that his name of the
[5:21] claimant and Israel and he shall become
[5:24] to be restore life and Mercer not all
[5:29] each with our daughter in law which
[5:32] levity which is better to be than seven
[5:34] sons have borne him and I only took the
[5:38] child and laid it on her bosom and they
[5:40] came nurse unto it and the woman who
[5:43] never gave it a name saying there was a
[5:46] son born to Naomi and they called his
[5:49] name
[5:49] Obed now he is the father Jesse in the
[5:55] father David so she's kind of on the
[5:59] lineage of all the people that were born
[6:01] or that were in Bethlehem you know
[6:17] my brother Brahim said that the one that
[6:20] founded it was Caleb's son Taylor son
[6:23] whose name was selma and he founded the
[6:25] bible said he was a father the father of
[6:29] it which meant he was a founder of
[6:31] bethlehem in other words he must move in
[6:36] there and started some sort of business
[6:37] and commercial and training and so forth
[6:40] they brewed up and later we find out
[6:43] that the real reason of it that the
[6:46] whole lens were jealous that little
[6:49] piece of land which plays to the north
[6:51] and east and slopes they lived to the
[6:54] south on the sperm and it was the most
[6:57] fertile of all palestine it was a
[7:00] Cornbelt in a rebuilt in her great olive
[7:03] orchards and so forth in it in that part
[7:07] of Bethlehem or Palestine and Judah
[7:12] Providence
[7:16] he also she also talks about Rahab we
[7:24] have after she'll spare she got all her
[7:27] people in everything that was under the
[7:29] court was saved just like when God in
[7:32] Egypt when he was when I was under the
[7:37] Bible save it you know what under the
[7:40] scarlet cord was saved and all under the
[7:43] blood of Jesus estate all from under it
[7:48] it is lost but it's ready for
[7:50] destruction
[7:51] and we find out now in doing this that
[7:54] we understand by history day she courted
[7:57] some general I don't know his name right
[8:00] now in Israel or me and she finally
[8:02] married that man and they set up here in
[8:05] this near this little place and her son
[8:07] Selma was the one who found it Bethlehem
[8:11] see a Gentile is connected with it to
[8:15] begin with a Gentile Rahab the harlot
[8:25] and he provide all with and boys was
[8:28] they wanted to marry another Gentile and
[8:32] we're following this lineage now Ruth
[8:35] she got she was a MOBOT and she married
[8:38] forward and came into this little city
[8:41] just embarrassed
[8:42] barley season or we had the time this
[8:45] morning to do on that I hope he says
[8:48] there's a little of the match he said
[8:51] hold my wife's expresses glass guests

[9:17] but we accept a gift so we pray
[9:21] father that you'll make us a gift of
[9:23] life to this dying world many here have
[9:27] raised their hand that they want the
[9:31] gift of God that he had to himself gave
