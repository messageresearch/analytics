[Music] our fear is gone [Music] he holds my fishes [Music] thank you all again it's been the atmosphere the whole weekend's been just a sweet spirit yes it's been yesterday it's been just yeah the house is about all you say i want it to be that way for words can't explain amen we've got four at least maybe five and some of you else one of you about that we got clothes we got plenty of towels we will uh we'll somehow we'll somehow get you uh get you some clay some dry clothes but brother roger could you open our service for me please in prayer you can speak in spanish that's okay that's okay jesus lord jesus thank you for these brethren that have come here we're here to fulfill one of your commandments your word tells us if we believe whatever if we're baptized shall be saved [Music] and also it also goes towards our uncle because lord you have given us a wide promise yes them in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen thank you brother never had that before in spanish it's going to be kind of fun you know when we get on the other side sorry luigi no interpreters on the other side we'll all speak one language yes amen yeah you have to get rid of me listen to the southerners another day or two before you get used to it good to be here good to have each and everyone over here thank you for the ones that are participating and like i said before if the uh if the lord strikes you hit the water yes i believe folks ain't getting them before the devil dies brother brown never said somebody was too young never there's not a quote in the in the whole 1100 sermons where brother man said no you need to wait he said no get them to the waters back that's right amen and you know what they might not totally understand everything but you know what some of these that we're going to baptize may not totally understand everything either but it's an outward show of an inward work it's something somebody wants to do because of what's inside of them about the age of the child so let's read romans 6 verse 1 says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound thank god brother mike brought all that wonderfully this morning yes god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know you not that so many of us as we're baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism buried died buried resurrected all right that's what we're going to do today therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him and for the mighty was talking this morning the whole nature so nature is dead the old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed and henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin how many wants to be free today amen this whole weekend i wanted some people to be free as they could be yes and y'all worship man good job the lord was with us let's just keep that and continue and go on with it amen even back to our own homes take that anointing with you and worship god don't be afraid to worship the lord that's right he adores worship yes amen for he that is dead is free from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe that we also shall live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead diet no more in death have no more dominion over him friend that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god to jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourself into god as those that are alive from the dead in your members as instruments of righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you for you're not under the law but under grace like what brother mike said grace found us yes that's right we didn't go looking for gray grace found us and then all the efforts that we do this is an effort if you were standing in the water right now you'd say it was an effort but this is an effort but you know what it is it's going to clear it should clear your conscience to where satan can't say any more i need this and you're that no when we put that when we put you in the ground right here you leave everything behind you even if you're just justified even if you're just sanctified if you don't have the holy ghost that's okay start somewhere yes start right here just leave all those sins out here into this water they'll just go back to the devil and give them to you yeah but i want us to to be able to to see that and be free from all a lot of these things that we're that's binding us all all of us binding us to not move on with god and move on with the lord sincere and serious uh with the lord from now on so let's see um now listen uh we have four so far sister gwen and um well there's brother elisha melissa and then we've got sister mary all right so um assistant if you want to go first or sister mary wants to go first and then you go second okay you want to do that let sister mary go and then you go second god i don't want y'all to uh get it's not going to be cold i mean i'm not calling now so it's not going to hurt you okay it's cold it won't be cold our lord told us he said go into all the world right before he left this place he said go into all the world and preach the gospel find a miracle he said do one thing he said baptized all new converts in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost and we know that that's a that's a that's throwing it forward that peter on the day of pentecost he picked up the revelation he knew what jesus was talking about that father's not a name and son is not a name and holy ghost is not a name but he told us that the whole family in heaven would be named jesus christ so that's why we don't baptize the way other people baptize because those are titles we have a name this weekend we had a name those preachers kept calling us bright right well you know what still we got a name you know what we're the bride of the lord jesus christ yes amen so we are buried in his name and by a commission that god told us to go into all the world and baptize a new converse we're gonna baptize our sister mary kamani in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Applause] all right the lord told us our sister quinn she just started coming to church with us and she's become one of us and the younger sister sister cleta way younger than she is but she's come to make a confession today she come to show satan number one yes that she's changed amen to do what god says so what god told us to do he told us to baptize all new converse in the name of the father the son and of the holy ghost amen i now baptize my sister sister gwen hulsey in the name of the lord jesus [Applause] all right the lord told us these new converts praise the lord baptize them in the name of the father and of the son yeah the holy ghost my sister melissa negro yeah amen amen to
