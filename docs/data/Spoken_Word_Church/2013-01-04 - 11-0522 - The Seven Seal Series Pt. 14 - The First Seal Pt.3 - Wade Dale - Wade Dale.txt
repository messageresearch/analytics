========================================

hit the button thank you each and everyone for coming today good to be back thank you brother Joe for doing a good job last week and helping out while we were at brother Bley Williams and had a good time there had a good time fellowship meeting yesterday I guess the rest of you did talk about the ball game every yeah that guy I think we for the Lord pray we'll have another one today Revelation chapter 6 we're back online everything's back up so I'm not on just half of you no we not seeing you no nobody but me thank you thank you nobody but me on the screen thank you yeah not Revelation 61 all right and we are actually really looking for a new way to do all this so any suggestion will help except the one mil did so put me back in that corner over there but we found out that the U heater is going to be right there now I'm not going to be in that back corner with no heater on Just for joce well don't fine see everybody everybody well thing I don't know about putting the board up put it down so low because of this thing to be about well I may take and put the board on that easel like we use up there anyway all right let's go Revelation chapter 6 now we've been talking for since the first of the year we've been on the breach started through the first seal and got into some things and uh talking about iniquity and man of sin we're going to read Revelation 6 kind of just back up we had done this in a couple weeks but just back up and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals I heard it was the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and we know who that Beast was right what was that Beast somebody lion thank you the lion all right lion ox man and Eagle we're going to go back through that again for those of you that are fresh here good to see sister Vanessa with us today morning with us and just for thoughts in your mind we're we're going to take the natural aspect of the seal the spiritual aspect of the seal and the literal opening of the seal when we're gone all right and also take the combat Beast each horse each power we've been on the White Horse and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given remember we talked about Satan he has no power well jeel was speaking of a little bit last night but Satan has to be given power all down through here I've circled all to given power was given now when Jesus resurrected what did he say all power in heaven and earth been given unto me so everybody else and every other thing is powerless there's nothing more powerful than that man or Eli right so he had to permit or give power to the devil actually he doesn't do it we do it we're the ones that give Satan the power all right and power was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer in other words he was conquering in that day and to conquer means brother randam said that man got on that white horse rode through the church ages got off that horse got on another horse but that horse kept on going that horse was a power the people gave that horse that power which was the white righteous Church all right and like we said a couple of Sundays ago I want you to see that there was a white righteous Church Paul Peter that was a white righteous church right the True Vine but there was a false Vine that wanted to be righteous too they wanted to look light and they wanted to you know power had to be given to them they had a bow no arrows in other words they had they had something to do during that time but they couldn't they had no effect on the people power was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now let's go to Second Thessalonians cuz we know from the teaching of the word of God that when brother random went come to that first deal we know the white horse rider became exposed and we use that word reveal and I said you know remember we we use that word too Loosely um I don't want a revelation of the devil I want a revelation of Jesus Christ so much that it exposes is the devil but if I get more of a revelation of who Jesus Christ is in my life that exposes what the devil's doing and it drives him out that's why that white horse was riding away brother R said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes a white horse rider he was riding away he was riding away from something all right so now second Thessalonians we understand that uh that truly the symbols watch this person we're going to go from symbols which is horses and things like that so this is the man this is the man you're talking about here because it's not it's not a symbol of sin it's not a it's not White Horse this is the man of sin this is the person all right chapter 2 now we beseech ye Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand not a day like the guy prophesied yesterday that we were going to you know that was the day of the Lord and we were going home well we didn't go home we understand one thing for sure no man knows the day or the hour and if you set one day as a day you broke the scripture and you can't break the scripture regardless of what the prophet said regardless of all the other things how this is going to happen if any man sets a day brother ra said you may know the week or the month but see they're not setting week month prophecies they're setting days CU you cannot set a day the Bible says no man will know the day or the hour all right that's why even brother Brown says between 6 and 9 see there's no way brother R could have come out and said oh it's going to happen at 7:00 no he'd know the hour he hadn't break scripture it's from 6:00 to 9:00 in the morning you have a lap in there of time that no man knows but we will I was just wondering it's 6 to9 when it's here in the states it's not that hour across the world and I was wondering because he was a an American prophet he was 69 I think so I think the Rapture will start here I just I don't know that's just my thought but the man said he got everything out of scpt oh yeah he went through Daniel 70 weeks and the whole works I mean he was he was nailing it right down to the day be like and everybody wouldn't know it that's right that's why everybody knows a little bit of the word of God but we had a Prophet come that knew all the word God he put it together and I put my dependence not on just that man William Brandon but God speaking through that man to me okay he was a vessel he was a mute trumpet okay he actually yielded hisself so much to God till God actually used that man let no man deceive you by any means for that day what the day of Christ shall not come except there come a falling away first now we talked about that you see the and looking yesterday we saw 155 people or more here in this church and you see that churches are growing and and sister Vanessa said that she come from church you know 3 400 people 300 people people probably beig Church Falling Away people is not people leaving church it's people coming to church thinking they're saved thinking they're born again and they're in the message because this man of sin is not being made known in a lot of places all right not saying anything about big churches or little churches but I told somebody the other day somebody said something about a church I said well Jesus God himself only had 12 and one of them was the devil First Church God set up the first church with 12 people and one of them was the devil so guess what we ain't going to do any better all right but for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition how is he going to be revealed or made known by this message this message is the only word of God powerful enough you say powerful enough yeah they had the the word of God down through the Through the Ages but they only had a little portion we got the whole portion who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God as God sitting in the temple of God now where's the temple of God it's not some Dwelling it's not this building it's not four wall the only Temple that God is worried about is the one that you brought with you today that you washed and put on clothes and all that okay all right when you say Temple and going to prepare place and you look at all these Mansions it's you a body thou has prepared Me Not Just for Jesus Christ he did the same with you and I okay so that he as God sth in the temp sth is th that's an ongoing thing so he's not just going to stop showing himself that he is God now the only way he can get his perfect anti- anointing is in this message he's got to watch and see what's going on in this message cu no other people on the face of the Earth has ever had the word of God open as pure as you and I see it so that man of sin is not sitting in a Budweiser joint or down at the prostitute house he comes to church more than most of us do in a message Church okay he never misses a day he's always in my brain when when when I walk in sister Vanessa it's not that we're not immune but remember what we do we cast down reasoning we cast down imagination we cast down these things remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things Paul was trying to get the people to understand Jesus Christ was not coming during his time he knew that he was a prophet now this Prophet this was the alpha Prophet which knew he wasn't coming at the end at that time but the Omega Prophet brother randam knew he was coming cuz there was no more Church ages Paul could see other ages when when Paul said I look through a glass Darkly he was prophesying something to come brother brandom didn't prophesy something to come he went across a curtain of time he preached the future home he preached it right up to our eternity Paul didn't Paul could look and maybe see part of it but he couldn't understand it like you and I I've always said that uh those great saints that went on they're going to look for you when you tell them you come from this loud of seeing age they're going to want to sit down and talk to you and ask you how you did that's right how in the world did you make it through the most vile super religious age that ever was they're going to want to ask you and find out how you made it through cuz the seals were not revealed to anybody in any age until this age right here and that was what man was looking at Paul could look right at him but he could not pull that seal back because the and it's not saying that Paul was a lesser Prophet Paul was a prophet but a great man like I said the alpha uh you know the beginning and that's why he and brother r on their life parallels but but there was a time that Paul knew there was another church Aid see it had to come to the last Church Aid brother random knew the seals had to open for the Redemption of the body because there was not another age for you to die off see they come into Paul's age they come in and then as Paul left he said Grievous wolves are going to come in they're going to eat away the word of God and he said it's going to not come from the outside it's going to come from here we're going to read that in just a minute but there's going to be a falling away well here here see he saw another Prophet irus come up but brother rown comes he says this is it there's no more falling away if you fall away it's going to be this one right here this great Falling Away In other words brother R said one time he said we're on an ax blade he said raise your Edge he said you slide off this side he said there's no way to come back cuz it just keeps going away but if you make it on this side you going to God you understand what I'm saying but see there was the falling away in Paul's time but the people that fell away there was another age sprung up and brought the people back up into the word of God there's nothing else people but us being caught up we're the caught up group okay is it falling away from the truth of the word it's falling away from the truth of the word but listen to this right here let me read this right here we're going to read this in just a second let me read one and now you know verse six that what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time and now you know what withhold it he's fixing to tell us why it's withholding remember we talked about this but we going back over to refresh everybody's memory for the mystery of iniquity does already work now let's read this like a like somebody with no Revelation only he who now leth will let who Satan oh I Satan Satan's going to let all this happen hold that in your mind we know that's not right but hold it there until he God be taken out of the way are he his people no we had a Prophet come in the end time I read it to you it's on page 116 of the seal book we read it we won't read it for a second time you you got your seal book with you he said only he got it took a prophet look at that little age God hid that from the people only he God who now leth will let in other words God let this thing go on until he the Bible says he little age but here brother R comes along God reveals the word to him gives him the give him the Love Letter the the in between the lines he said that's Christ or the bride the bride she is him she is him now until he the bride be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with what the spirit of his mouth what sharped story speaking of the word of God and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming remember we went to Isaiah and read about that in the end time that the moon was going to be as bright as the sun and the sun would be seven times brighter so the moon's going to be seven times brighter in this last day so we're going to shine there's no difference between the Sun and the Moon in the end time all right there's no difference in the sun cuz that's the sun of righteousness the sun you know the Moon is the Lesser light but the Bible tells us that that lesser light's going to be seven times brighter in the end time and that's in Isaiah 30 let's read that while while we got just a little time that's why brother R said one seal can tie the entire Bible together you can go through all the Bible and just read we're still in just the first seal and we're going to go to Genesis next week and show you how the seal started in Genesis all right just for the first seal and I hate this thing put my hand on it what there's no adjustment no that's for this there's not one down there I take to your place let you well up together now listen if Brother Ray ever speaks he'll be just fine all right I'm sorry Isaiah 30 just nose I'm going cut up anyway so I don't have to put on a show do I okay all right but now listen to this verse 26 Chapter 30 keep our comments ourselves Chapter 30 verse 26 moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun now when is this going to happen you know verse 25 tells us when the towers fall okay that happened September 11th 2011 of 2001 see that shall be upon ever high mountain ever high hill rivers and streams of water in the day the great of the great Slaughter when the tow fall all right so the towers had to fall in New York first before this scripture brother R said this day this scripture is fulfilled I can tell you now this day this scripture it's been 10 years since the towers that fell and look what happened moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be seven four so if the sun's going to be seven times brighter and the moon's going to be the same light as the sun here we got seven times brighter the moon as the light of seven days what seven Church ages and the day that the Lord bindeth up the what the breach brother preach what the breach between the church ages and the seal the breach of his people and health The Stroke of their wound now what great wound are we looking at right now there's only one wound and that is the wound of death death is the last thing to be destroyed now let's go back to Second Thessalonians and finish that up verse 8 then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive here is the key people listen to this and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because this is why because they receive not the love of The Truth Listen they receive the truth they just not did they just did not see the love of the truth brother R said perfect love that's the only thing that's going to get you to heaven is perfect love and the only you know that like I said before all the I was preaching brother burle and and you know people people say that boy perfect love brother R's got to come back and give us all perfect love when brother Brown went across a curtain a time there was short people tall people white people black people all different colors they were different sister Vanessa were different but they only have one thing in common that angel come around and stood and brother BR said are all these brandom he said no he said well how did they get here he said they all have perfect love so what did they all have what was it all in common in the sixth Dimension doesn't matter if you're short don't matter if you got a lot of understanding don't matter if you got a little bit of understanding don't matter if you're a great scholar if you're born again that's the only thing that's going to put you in that sixth Dimension was perfect love which is the Born Again experience see these people people right here receive not the love of the truth not just the truth they receive the truth cuz they got to believe a lie be down by it we want to read this in just a minute they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness see there's the first seal opening now what is got most people there's there's one thing that I'm going to find that scripture and I haven't found it yet but I was looking through it the other day remember I talking about the Holy One of Israel what does everybody believe except the really that knows the Bible that knows you know believes what the message of the hour we're the only people that have a true revelation of one God how he came how he did what he did how he wasn't three persons how he wasn't you know three Spirits how he wasn't three individuals that's what a trinity is I don't care how they say it they're saying three distinct individual persons so they're saying there's three Gods but the Bible says the Holy One of Israel and it's in capital letters one one means one he didn't say the holy two or the holy three or the holy third person or the second person right he said the Holy One of Israel so in our studies let's go to Matthew I told you to keep a marker in Matthew 24 I took mine out when I was at bur so I got to finally again myself 24 we just read second Thessalonians right what did we say there would be there would come a man of sin that would dece deceive the people and make them believe a lie or believe this message with a little twist and be down by let's just be truthful people if if if if Satan has the denominations have a trinitarian idea the denominations have father son Holy Ghost baptism Satan's already got those people so where's he after he after the ones with be through that have the love of the truth but it's the ones that was always the mix multitude that have the problem verse five Matthew 24:5 for many shall come in my name what did we just talk about man of sin showing himself that he is God not wanting to be not like to be but he's showing himself that he is God for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many just same thing in second Thessalonians now let's go to verse 23 let's go to 22 and said those days should be shortened there shall be no flesh there should no flesh be say flesh didn't say Spirit didn't say flesh so we're dealing with the flesh right right s seals were given for the Redemption of the body not for the soul Paul's Soul was redeemed without knowing a thing about the seal irenius is soul brother randam Soul was redeemed Eternal before the seals ever open but the opening of those seals are for the Redemption of your body all right so that's where we got to tie it in and we will do so if God permit but for the elect sake those days shall be shorten you know when the uh earthquake happened in Japan you know what happened right the days got shorter the Earth's access actually went so many degrees back up God's not throwing this thing out of cater he's trying to get it back in cater right okay day shorten by so many milliseconds I you know us older people like like the ones that are getting close to 50 or over um oh sister Vanessa had a birthday yesterday happy birthday s but though I mean that means something but look at the scripture the scripture says for the elect's sake that's mean in you for our sake these things are happening for our sake God is shortened even by a millisecond God knows we need it I need it myself a millisecond is okay for me but what is he doing that earthquake took that whole ball called the Earth this huge thing we live on and tilted it back up so it's going back remember we're going back to an even condition where the where the where the poles are straight up and down not so many degrees off we're not going to wobble anymore we wobbled as Christians down here long enough in this flesh for the elate those days shall be shortened then this day the scripture fulfilled then then if any man shall say unto you L I got the revelation of the message and they don't are there low here see low here is Christ L we got we got to go over to brother so and so we got to go over to this we got to okay you understand what I'm saying Lo here is Christ are there whoa the Bible says oh believe it just go for no it says believe it not now listen people the only way you're not going to be deceived by that is to know that Christ is right here that's right why do I have to go get Christ when I got him right here why do I have to go even it even says like over the sea and over here and over there you understand then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ brother R said that was false Christ not not not demons false Christ Capital CH r i s and false prophets and shall show show Great Signs and wonder in so much that it if it were possible they should deceive the very leg behold I have told you before you remember what brother Dell always tells us if God repeats himself in the Bible you better listen cuz God don't repeat itself but right here it repeats itself in other words it's telling you a little different angle behold I have told you before this is Jesus speaking wherefore if they see Jesus is speaking this they what that rider that's going out they that power that were given that horse they that other person they shall say unto you the elect behold he is in the desert go not for behold he's in the secret chamber well that sounds good the Bible says for us to go into the secret chamber and pray what did Jesus say believe it not and I wrote in my Bible because he is in the bride and that's the only place Christ is I'm sorry that's just the way it is I didn't write the Bible but God is only going to take care of his own children he is not going to take care of the devil's children I love all your children but mine comes first sorry cuz they're my flesh and blood and God's going to take care of his kids first cuz they're we're his bone of his bone remember bone of his bone bless of his flesh remember what we said here sister Vanessa this is our kind of our theme you know when a minute that's what job said in my flesh I shall see God in the end time in other words those skin worms destroy my body and we lay brother Tom to rest you know we I'm going to read the scripture about that just a second want to do it in his honor here's what an end time bride says right here I am My Flesh I shall see God without dying that's a promise somebody's going to do that sir thank you she said right there so that's what we're talking about because in my flesh I'm going to see God whether I go by the grave didn't matter we go by the grave in his flesh when we Clos that casket the other day you'll never see that man because that man was born in sin that part we saw was from a mom and daddy that flesh won't inherit the kingdom of God right but he's going to change that flesh because I this is what I believe there's going to be empty tomb cuz Jesus's tomb was empty his body wasn't laying in there and he was walking around all over the Earth push's body is going to come up out of that grave not pushing a bunch of dirt out remember this is secret secret going away and when that body comes up he's going to be changed in that picture that we saw of him being 20 years old so let's but let's read what let's read what we had to do let's turn over to I'll have to find it I was going to write it down and I didn't the other day hang on me I'll find it I got it wrote right on top of my Bible it's in the Corinthians all right turn to First Corinthians this is this has nothing to do with what we're talking about but it has everything to do with what we're talking about CU if the seventh seal is revealed brother r that brings God back to the Earth and God back to the Earth is in human flesh mine and yours all right let's read this in honor brother Tom and let's understand why we had to do what we did right 1 Corinthians 15 verse 39 this is in honor of no let's go with verse 35 this is honor of brother Tom just for a few minutes he's a very dear very dear brother very dear friend of our but we won't see that man that walked Among Us will not see that man again we will not see that old Decay bent over um body ever again and this is why right here but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come sorry 15:35 now y'all think I'm a little rough read that next verse 36 Paul said thou fool boy sometimes when we don't understand stuff we want people to go well that's okay brother that's you just understand what you can understand that fool Jesus said fools and SL heart hypocrite snake in the grass Jesus was uh pretty plain thou fool that which thou sest is not quickened except it die and that which thou sest thou sest not that body that shall be what did God do in the garden he didn't curse Adam and Eve he cursed what the ground the Earth right he cursed the Earth he cursed that crust what is this right here this is our Earth I want to preach on this one day cuz the Earth has a outer core I mean an outer crust an inner core and a center we're Body Spirit don't right this part was cursed right right you can't see this on here that's okay but this part was cursed right now what we had to do is we had to get Tom back into here so it can come back here what I was hoping somebody would have read that that's okay and that which thou sest H thou humans thou sest not that body that shall be but bear grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body All Flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of Flesh of men another of Beast another fish another of birds there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one say Amen to that and the glory of the terrestrial is another when you say Amen to that that's the one that likes the football games and all that stuff there's one glory of the sun another glory of the Moon another glory of the stars for one star differ from another star in glory now here's his answer the question was how are the dead raised and with what body do they come verse 42 so also is the resurrection of the Dead it was sown made we change that to just a little bit because sewn and the word planted mean the same what do you do when you plow a garden you you sew the seed into the garden right you put it into the Earth and you cover it up right it is sown in corruption that's what we did to brother Tom we we committed his body we sowed him into the ground in corruption in not not not in corruption but in space corruption cuz that's what went down but here's the wonderful part it the same thing we sowed cuz it was cursed and had to go back into that crust of the ground right it it the same body is raised in in corruption there's when he's going to come out of the ground his body's going to be changed sin's going to be over for you and I that's why we have to do we have to plant everybody back into the ground there's only one group of people that's going to make it it's not going to have to be swn they're going to have to destroy death while we're standing on the top of this ground you say how can that happen Jesus Christ did it when he came on earth when he come up out of the Grave he said you don't have to do this anymore we just got to understand back to my statement Jesus said all power in heaven and earth been given unto me and where were you and I where were you and I when he spoke that word in him so if we're sown in Jesus Christ This is the part we're going to have to understand we keep leaning toward being swn from the parents that's swn in corruption that's why we have to put it down in the ground that's why we have to put it back because it's it's there's a curse on it has to go back down under the ground but the Bible gives us this cons consolation that we it will be raised in incorruption you will never see that corrupt body of K PA Bush ever again for eternity but you're sure going to see that man the real man yes man' something I often wondered how the gra how that body would be changed and be secr no gra open that body going get out Jesus went through the wall through the wall and that's right absolutely going to pick that body up and just what I believe I mean you know people say that you know say well we go out and we'll see the resurrection because the graves will be but why would they need to be busted open if we're in a glorified condition that's what people always say brother R got to come back get an airplane if he comes back he ain't going to need an airplane he ain't going to need an airplane people he going travel like a th airplane just slow him down that's
