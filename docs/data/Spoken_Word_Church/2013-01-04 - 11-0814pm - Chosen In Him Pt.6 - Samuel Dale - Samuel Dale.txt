follow me with me good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn back in your scriptures turn where we're read this morning from Ephesians 1. and John 15 and then we'll read John 6. so just remember these things remember the ones that are away waiting Aaron Brother Dean and preaching and being away from us and traveling back to keep them in mind pray one for another Lord with blessing God each one of us in his love you know uh sister and I'm not going to call her name but hernatius is milka gave me a thing about people sleeping in church and I thought it's a pretty good point you know we can we can we can build a new church like this because a guy was yawning and showing bad signs of being sleepy in a courthouse and they find him a thousand dollars you know so uh you know that'd be pretty good of course the judge was even nice enough to to take it down he took it down to 100 so still if we got the hundred it would would be all right and said there was a lady in the uh at the doctor's office or something and she was you know she had went to sleep and and all and she was really snoring away and the little girl woke her up and said Mama wake up you're not at the church so much you know no sleeping Spirits remember the box outside on the right just for uh to help people around here they won't help me in it but it's to help people around here so you just drop your money into the top slots you know as you're going to I understand the sleepiness that this we fight the best we can and do the best we can just understand what the older I get the worse it kind of gets on you you know and everything but and uh remember me the devil is still on his duties you know he's doing his good job he uh he jumped on to me now and they say that my throat has got a Gorder in the inside on the it's not wrote it what you call it is enlarged and they're wanting to do biopsies on that to see what it is now you're still knife and all of them say buy a Stripes I'm Healed because I ain't worried about what it what you're saying but they telling me you know that she said it's not closing in on you I said no it doesn't seem to bother me now that Matt does but it doesn't seem to bother me he said because you know I've always been able to just talk and go on anyway she said well we'll take a look at it okay so this week there or next week I guess it is one week we're supposed to look down in there and check it but you pray about it because I'm saying by the stripes I'm Healed you know older we get we're not as I've told you I don't get up every day expecting the new element that is not the way to be I get up every day realizing the older I get I probably will get one but you know that's no problem you just keep on going you know I don't want to stay in this old Pastor house in much longer anyway to you you know we're we want to get out of here and get into a change because that's the main thing is to still be in the word okay Ephesians 1 John 15 and John 6. dearly father we thank you for this day and we thank you for being what you are because we realize realization that there's nothing worthy in any of us to be able to be anything but yet you are the great of all things without you what would we be there would be no hope whatsoever and we would not even exist without a father to create us we realize that you are the father of all mankind but we as we're saying this morning that's not the kind of father you want to be you're wanting to be a different father with us we pray that you would just help us and lead us into that understanding of what you really want Lord you created us for a purpose now get out of us in the end time what your purpose is that you've created this God each one bless those that are away and Lord traveling back home be with each one give a safe journey we love you and we thank you and we commit everything to you as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts and our lives in Jesus name amen Ephesians 1 verse 3 and 4. they should be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessing in Heavenly places where in Christ according as he has chosen us were in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love now I'd really like to preach on that part of it but that's that's when you read the Bible and you try to bring something out and then it just keeps unfolding you know you know like that because it uh it takes him to make us holy right okay turn to John 15. 16 we'll just read that you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask the father of the father in my name he may give it you now drop over to chapter 6 and verse 44. it says no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day so you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing for the reading I've got just a little bit on one part of a quote that they added in instead of trying to go into to the next message because it's hard to just try to preach something and you know Bring It Forward because it all ties together and we realize that but now remember what we're talking about we're back before the foundation of the world we're not down here in time and doing and and all we're still talking about the things that was there like the the old colored brothers that run around and spoke of that talked about you know how to do all everybody else are down on Earth preaching and he took them up in heaven now that man had something because he uh you'd be surprised how many probably a hundred times wrote around them I don't remember the exact number but it's a large number of references he makes to that you know you know but he's bringing it how that that man told what went on in heaven and then come down to earth well that's what I'm trying to do is talk about what was in heaven and then we'll come down to earth and see these things come into reality and we read here in John that verse 44 6th chapter and Jesus said no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I'll raise him up in the last days now we don't believe in trinitarianism we believe in one God and we don't believe that God sent a son you know like in our references of of the uh the way we would think about it you know that we would pick somebody else to go down to do something and uh you know it's not as the trinitarian concept of thought is that you know there it was up in heaven and Jesus come over and said father I'd like to go down you know and do this or that or the other it's not in those forms right it's in the bases that God is revealing himself the unfolding or unveiling himself to bring himself into view to where that we can see and understand him right and see then the the son the the Creator the what we were talking about this morning the part of God that went out of God is Not Another God is God in another form or God taking a form to reveal himself see he's stepping over into something that uh that could be talked about because first it would be uh in the beginning as the prophet said before the Eternal and that's beyond our comprehensions of our mind but you know he knew something dark and and back there you can't even speak and you say well God we don't know who God is or what God is or or anything like that but see It's Beginning by way of the prophet's message after all of these years we should be getting a an understanding at least opened unto us on how the one true and living God truly is and that it's not God in three persons it's none of these other you said well we understood that 40 years ago well I doubt it so that's that's all right uh because I doubt most people still understanding it because it has to be revealed all right and it's the condescending of God so we never sent somebody else all right so then now the scripture says as the father had sent me what did Jesus say so I sent you now how did Brother around say he sent the father sinning he said he came in himself that's simple in it he came himself in that form but when you look at something and begin to be able to visually see it or any in any form of words to be used like in Genesis 1 God uh created the heavens and the earth when you're trying to get to that basis see it it's just words to try to express the the Eternal God that's trying to reveal himself all right and in doing that then if the if Jesus was almighty God in human flesh what are you and I are we a second person a third person or you know something or are we that same God just manifest in another way another form only this time it's a Mark it's a you know it's a mini-membered body right you know it's it's the bride of Christ and they're making him known to the world see I just don't believe that we're we're getting into that enough yet to understand that's just what I'm saying that I I keep going over and over and I will keep going over and over because I don't care I can take the same notes for each 20 years off of them I wouldn't have no problem because it's just the way it's made you can't exhaust an eternal word what we were trying to get on the thought this morning was is God's word being eternal and he he can never have another thought now see that that's beyond our thoughts right and that's why the scripture says that that my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways he's in my ways and my thoughts are so much higher until see our thoughts are not even involved in right because it's it's unveiling of God how can you try to bring God down into words and as I was trying to say this morning about it see because that's bothered me for a long time is is how people they condemn you for preaching deeper things than they do and you know and and like that and and and they claim you're stealing their people from them or something and they don't want you around them because they're afraid to lose their people and it's really the truth I guess but still you know you're you're what it what's the point like I said on the day of Pentecost they heard a sermon but God come down and prick their heart and you think about it this this is this is what's been on me for for many many years to try to express it you just think about it do you know that you go say say you leave here and you go to somewhere where they never heard of God okay now there's an illustration I mean you you just go and you float upon an island and you get off and walk up and the people start running out with their Spears and their little bows and their things you know and darts and and you say I want to tell you about Jesus well sorry to say you're going to get full full of poison darts if God ain't on a person on the other end that's right you know I'm an honest right that's right because what do you got to show Peter them the owner death Pentecost didn't have any great miracles to show that would they would have could have reminded him of of uh what happened in Jesus's Ministry all right but I mean they didn't say no look you don't have seen all these people healed now you know you need to have what they got what we got they didn't they didn't do that they just give them a message and God came down into the heart of the individual and creeped that heart of that individual and they wanted to do it they wanted salvation right right yeah see but now like I said if you got washed up on an island and you're walking up there and here comes the chief out and he's done had a dream that something's gonna happen he's not had something maybe or somebody that God spoke to his heart and he said hold on a minute let's listen to this person it's not that that everybody knows the Bible and you just go and start talking to them about it they don't know the Bible and even those that know the Bible are the hardest ones probably to try to get converted because they've been taught so many different ways as we were using their one this morning we're running around and said you go into them he said all it does is form cults and then he was nice enough in it to say that he went thrown off on him he said they just need an understanding you remember when you say when we was in this and we were tonight yeah we was in college and you know we can be a cult right here at Lula yep exactly right because you were to look up the word when he did you find out what it means it's something contrary to to the practice or a point of what anybody else believes so the Methodist is to call to a Baptist advantages of course the Manchester this and and all this that and the other if they really went by that but when you establish a a mineral Middle Ground than anything contrary to that is a cult do anything contrary to a concept of one God entry person or you know whatever it is then they can call the rest of the world a cult see that's it's a cult it's something contrary to what you believe right and I like the scripture there where it says they went out of us from because they went out from us because it wasn't of us right when I left the Baptist they could say he left he went out on others because he wasn't one of us because the scripture said if he went one of us he'd saved him and that's that's true but you see we go over on the other side and we're looking back at it and we'll say it they went out from us and if they'd have been what we are they'd be where we're at that's right but you see I'm trying to get you to understand and and it it's like brother dick says about the the uh ability to come to a change of the body if you don't understand one true and living God how can you ever come to that concept I mean what can never be the point because you're still tied up into too many things if we don't understand one true and living God I mean by Revelation that's right that's right not just our understanding even open to the scripture yes what about revelation then we are as other people deceived amen and that that's that's something that we've got to get out of the but now consider the point of what I'm trying to get and I'll get back to this scripture to end no man can come to me Jesus said except the father that sent me drawing and the way that Jesus was almighty God is the way that your almighty God because you're an Offspring You're a child of God I wish I could get that to work but I wish I had some words for that to be revealed you would be running into each other shouting all over the place I know that because I know it's with me too I mean it's just this is honest no problem with anybody because I realize that it takes a revelation and you say but I see it well then there should be more life involved if I was looking we were the other day one of the messages the Priestess recently you see ever since I've been in this message I've been in the Revival 40-something years in a Revival well a Revival don't last that long it has in me what has it that happened in you that long some of you been around that long and longer but see what I mean about it it's not a great thing of signs and wonders and healings and things it it's a constant unveiling of God's word if that's not the greatest Revival give me that Revival you can have all the others right right all right and I'm not against all the others I'd love to have been there with each one of them but you know what each one of those revivals were was an opening of the word you remember one they had a great Revival back one time and they went back to this really checked up and see where did the Revival started from and they come find out it started from the cleaning lady that was going along and cleaning the seats she was saying Lord bless this person that says here Lord bless this you know why to create a Revival in the whole church well see then whose fault is it that we're not having a revivalist mine and yours right but I am having one I'm having a Revival because the word revive is for the Christian not for The Sinner right but I'm just trying to get you to see what I see or believe about God see to get you to understand it all right so then Jesus said you didn't choose me I chose you now how did we choose as I was I keep going back to it it's chosen Us in him all right who's the hymn it's Christ who'd under choosing almighty God back before you existed with the word god see that's our quick answer when you say God everybody says he not a god till he created something we'll run around can call him God and we'd rack before the world he can call him God and he said God would back there and gwelt alone well you know he didn't have to have nobody to explain that that God wasn't God at that time yet but around him you're all messed up he could enjoy just talking about God why can't we see that's what I'm saying we we're so trained until we we got into the bases that we can quote but but why is it why can't we believe what the Bible says about us why is it so hard for us to believe that we're the children of God now we can believe it in a way right yeah yeah now you know what I mean by that until you say whatever right now in a way right around that might be right he said no no such thing when you say in a way that means it's not diarrheal we're in a way now brother Dale actually I'm God now you don't see what I'm talking about you don't see what the Bible says you say in a way I can see that I'm I was chosen before the word you don't see what the Bible says he said what do y'all do no you don't because it's just hey that's right Jesus wasn't God in a way that's right you know he was either God or wasn't God right all right we're even The Offspring of God and we're not The Offspring of God we're either the children of God by the new birth and we are not the children of God simple language right but see I want a revelation you say you do it yeah because it's been revealed to me and that's what I'm speaking on what's revealed to me but I I believe that will keep unfolding because to me I believe that is the end time the message and I'm going to say this person when you do what you want to you remember a few weeks ago a couple of services ago that I was preaching about the hidden body would unite in the last days to bring the message your brothers Branham said win the fully matured work would come see him we're expecting God to come down and anoint our understanding all of those things I believe we're here at that time I never make predictions or anything like that at the end of time there's there's no need to think of what and none of us are right anyway and like I told you you sit down and you take 365 people and each one of them say well it's going to be this day and in this day nothing this day you still got a force to deal with you got that one day out of four years to deal with so it can't be done why don't we believe what God Said that's where I believe that her healing problem is that we don't believe what God Said God says we're healed we want to see something happen we want to get better or we want the doctor to tell us we're better instead of saying What God Says let me say it until the last moment and then don't put it on my Tombstone that he died with this put it on there he died saying it's healed Why Can't We Believe What God Says Lee all right so just keep going and believe it all right now let's get down to where we left off this morning and we were talking about the thoughts of God being eternal and be into the bases you know that our names were written on the last book of life but being to the basis of one thing now let me try this hard into our thoughts if God cannot have a new thought and we were talking about that this morning God's thoughts are Eternal now if you can't have a new thought then he could not speak a word that would not come to pass right you agree yes yes I mean whatever he says must come to pass now we could go in there and we can figure it all out but brother Dale you don't understand that could be this for this person or it could be different that may be true but why can't we believe it's for us I believe the eternal life that I have is a part of God's own life amen all right and that part of God's own life was before the world ever begun or before anything was ever even thought about it in the world to do it like I said this morning then I don't want to be just in God's mind well brother that was just in God's mind he just saw these things in his mind and he done this what no I want to be a part of his mind amen I want to be a part of the Thinker yes right I want the one that's doing the thinking to live in me amen right see then that to me is what the Bible says let the mind that was in Christ be in you that's not the brain because it's not talking about it's almost soul mind being what you are let the mind that was in Christ not his transplant of his brain or or intelligence no it's the soul it's the lie that's why it'll make you a new creature and that's what we want we want Christ to be made manifest all right see but when God speaks a word it's got to happen that's right amen now he can't promise you something and take it back that's right amen that's why I believe the Bible says you know and I believe that scripture and seen it produce itself where he says you'll be there with your offspring I believe it yes yes I mean I believe what he said yes right yeah you know there's a lot of things in the Bible that can't be explained there's a lot of things in life can't be explained that's right someone said in the Bible said the other day I wasn't making a joke of that we just all have a good time in Bible study we just sit around and laugh and have a good time and someone said something about the slim-eyed people you know and I said well if you'd been hanging upside down all of your life we think we're on top don't you who's on top you know we're hanging in space who's up Who's down you know how to do with your eyes planting they just just we make you know we just having a good time talking about God's glory and I think all right but listen Church me God stops are Eternal not now listen they're not just perfect now to be honest it's beyond our comprehension to have a mind that would be perfect right right it's beyond our comprehension to have anything perfect they said oh the old store or we have now the the Mustang you can go buy a brand new Mustang 56 Mustang no you can't you can't do it you might buy a restored one put back together into pieces and part but most of the time it's going to be pieces of two or three of them but right but see we we think we have it under our understanding and being in our understanding we think we comprehend what's going on but remember it's got to be revealed amen no matter how simple it is the prophet would say like this he said you don't need a revelation about water baptism he said it's right there in black and white but then he turned around and say pray for God to reveal those things to you because see the revelations on one God if you see the one God you don't have no problems with seeing water baptism but you know what if you don't see one God you're not going to believe what's the scripture that's right you're still going to believe in a trinity that's right but see we're not believing What God Says the prophet never come to give us another Bible another interpretation another he come to turn us back to the original word amen well what's your problem hmm why can't we just settle down and believe it okay let's get started I'm gonna spend it too long all right go to the last book of life paragraph e or E 58 because you'll have to do that in a second 1956 603 it'd be number seven on your notes because I said I keep giving you these notes you know until we get through because I want you to take these notes home and read them I want you to take these things home and read them and so what did brought around say I mean he gives us the answer thank you you shouldn't crash to make sure God revealed he says it like himself but it's a question what is the new birth brother Brown then you say what is the newborn well they've been talking this audition see now what did he say he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you is that deep you don't watch deep because it done away with all them things you used to think the new birth of us they just shattered them but that's what I'm saying if we have any question why can't we ask the prophet okay you know what I'm talking about that's the message well that's your way pulling it we'll pull up some and bring it to me shall be different I want to be right my soul is involved in this thing I want to be right I want to know yeah but you need some I'll agree with you on that now don't come and tell me what I don't think right bring them bring the goods and lay them out write the Bible in the message and lay them down and we'll spend weeks studying it together is because our shoulders involved in this right eternal life is decided in this message in times but look what he says he's praying they said our heavenly father we thank thee this morning for Jesus we thank thee for the Perfection of the gospel for the perfecting and the Eternal sovereignty of God's Eternal spoken word now sovereignty means nothing else can be added right nothing else can be done that's sovereign and according to his word he called us and chose us in him before the foundation of the world and wrote our names before the foundation of the world when God speaks a word it's got to happen it's good just got to happen so then he says and you and you spoke our names when you spoke his name you chose us with him before the foundation of the world so there's nothing we can say we could do Lord now listen there's nothing we can say we could do Lord oh no argument either God's right or wrong which one is it either God's word is right or wrong if it's wrong let's go home forget him man have a good time because we're all old enough we're fixing to die anyway so don't worry about it keep on with Obamacare ain't no telling what we're gonna have no I ain't worried about him ain't no different nobody else you put in all of the others on the other side it's not going to do any difference everybody's got their way we're going to straighten this out ain't nobody can straighten this out we've probably done told you you can put a George Washington in every office in the country now think about it George Washington Abraham Lincoln in every office in the country he said can't pull this out right he said well if we just had George no he can't pull it out right why because the devil is behind everything that's right gives the politics he's out of the things but think of it all right now if his word is true now the point of me using these quotes after this quote is for one thing if God's word is true why cannot We Believe God's word the prophet of God is to give us the interpretation of the word of God is that true that's right it's not to give us his own ideas or thoughts or concepts all right Jordan if we read then these things see what I want to be able to do is just say listen Church do we believe the word of God to be true more to just say okay the Bible said we were chosen in him before the foundational World forget it we know God's gracious enough to us to have sent us a message that would tie together the word of prophet could speak in the 50s and 40s and 60s and all and still be using the same form in the same thing to get us to see why didn't he just walk out on the Ohio River and say he's here let's go home you know what he was there right right he proved it was that right right but you know God's a good god he'd give us 40 years sure there's been a lot of dilding playing around man but he's given 40 years because you're looking at a man now you can say what you want to argue anyway but you're living in a man named Dallas around a diddle-daddling this message for 40 years now you can't say that well brother you're preaching the same thing right now you would 40 years ago I'll agree with you but it's in a deeper depth I'll agree with you because I was free today because that's what I saw I believe God's Bible if it's everything everyone be baptized out of the name of Jesus Christ I think we're a good baptize the name of Jesus Christ don't you right man Lord you do what God says right but you see then my point is using these quotes to back up what he's saying that the the thoughts from the morning's message that God's word is eternal his thoughts are Eternal you can never have another one and then we're reading that when God speaks a word it's got to happen right right when he said the voice of one crying in the wilderness what is it Isaiah 42. was there any way in the world that that would not take place somewhere upon the Earth that's right oh it had to be because God said it that's right amen if he said they'd be in rapture is there any way that could be changed okay you see any possibility that Satan can stop the word of God from being true no why so when he tells you something but see we believe in as long as it's working okay I remember a brother one time I'm not throwing off on him but he was going to get a uh an albino groundhog don't kill one and uh I'm not throwing off on him now I love the brother no problem just I'm just saying to him we got a lot until the day I die I confess I was going to get an albino groundhog hi but I wouldn't sit in my my house and wait I'd go out in the wood because there ain't too many albino groundhogs or blue groundhogs or any colored groundhog gonna come in your house try to at least go to the woods right that's what your brother kept telling me he's going to kill this deer and I said well we don't get honey we don't do you know good time in New York because you didn't say it would be in New York you said there's one I shot at thank you go then go go this way that's right I went and did about the property it just built me a housecoat he said I shot at him I just sit right there waiting on it to come to my you know but you see then when it don't come device then you start propping things off I ain't no need to profit nothing up just stay with it like it is all right what did he say well let's take a few quotes you know just from doing it for the point like I said for to see that wrote around said it and it wrote around and said it is what the Bible said don't you believe that okay 1959 1223 questions and answers paragraph 129 or in Jeffersonville he said now you that's been called like that I want to speak to you you the chosen ones that God chose us in him before the foundation of the world think of that God chose us in him before the foundation of the world God knew before the foundation of the world that I speak this same subject tonight he's infinite amen now don't you think God knew you'd be sitting here today right now a brother years ago brought around and told his brother said you said you had to fight your way all the way to a meeting at Jeffersonville I talked with a man personally that talked with this other man so I wish I were saying but anyhow he and he asked the brother said well when you went to that meeting he said you feeling different he's not got in the car drove up there well see there's no telling what the man went through let me tell them how many wrecks was deterred from him don't tell him what took place to be able to bring the man to that place you know what I'm talking about he might have been running on a rubber band car you know what I'm saying when he's fixing to pop and God kept it from popping until he got there right right see if God tells you something I don't mind it I'm not running around him if God said God told me raised George Washington he said I'd invite the world you know what most people do let me sneak up a few of y'all won't go along we'll sneak up to sneak up there and try to raise him from the dead and then we'll go tell the world no no no no God came to me come to pass I stood right here and told you Wade was coming back before he came so that settled it I told my wife he'd be preaching in this bullpit with me when he was still in the world if God tells me something I'll just tell you he's told me this on one God that's why I'm trying to tell you that's where it's been always my point of trying to take the things that others don't want to tackle the Sydney went to Daniel the the the the the things and managing divorce and things like that and speak on them why because he told me and I ain't going to come here tell you that he tells me because I got enough sense to know I can't figure it out I got a lot of questions still left in my mind but they are gradually coming to pass that there are not as many questions amen you know because I have questions about this I told you I did I couldn't see exactly I knew that we was in him I could see that but I couldn't understand how and how to bring it down without it being something that would be contrary how did he chose us when we thought we chose him me come on with it look at what he said God chose us in him before the foundational order he said just think of that what a wonderful thing to think about God shows us well well he didn't choose these others I've explained that everybody in the world was not a child of God it never will be a child of God correct no the choosing was not that way and season to choosing is not like we think the choosing of explained that over and over and over here's one more time it's not that God sat down and I'll take this and I won't take that one I'll choose this and won't choose that one there's no such thing right that would make him a respecter person the point is that he chose to condescend downward you remember that get that in your mind he chose to condescend downward to reveal itself to his children to his offspring that's why he's a father I told you this morning I'll go ahead and answer it for you Adam never made God a father like he wanted to be right even Christ standing there was a completeness in him before the world to be able to create and calling that hashan was not a word that would make him as a father he wanted to be he wanted to be a father to his children that would be part of him and that started on the day of Pentecost a new creation a new race that's why Jesus brother random says the only way that he could be a father was to be the son of man now what is he saying that are you listening yes why did he say that because the son of man was almighty God in human flesh agree and you know what he done he's so deceived through his mouth that's right he sowed you and I into this world the seed he stood there just as he stood back before the world and said let there be in a world slung off and these things happen he stood right there on the earth and preached the gospel which so deceived and if we're not one of those seeded he sowed we will have eternal life as a new person so what did he do how does he become father he wants to be is right now in the new birth he's your father he now has what he wanted it started on the death Pentecost he has exactly what he wanted to be a father of a new race of people and Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God Amen and Brethren said we are the rest of that creation that's right because God was wanting to come down to reveal himself he could do that in Christ but he wanted to reveal himself to his creation are the people not through the world he wants to reveal himself to his children amen this is not revealed this can't be revealed to the world you might run around said even the book of Ephesians was not written to the world he said it was written to those in Christ when Paul said he'll say in the scripture we've been reading that he chose us in him that wasn't written to the world that was written to those that are in Christ go to The Sinner can't get the word of God he can only get the word to get him convicted to be saved that's right sure he can have a lot of hit knowledge we cannot come down into his heart you realize you realize what I'm trying to say that the Bride of Jesus Christ down through the seven churches is now making him the father that he always wanted to be he always wanted to be a father now listen as I told you we only look at the Healer the savior here and savior didn't make him a father healer and savior deals with her son in the basis of the son coming in to do what he had to do what was that point to your thinking but see Savior and here has to do what Jesus done on earth right he had to come and pay the price on Earth for to be the Savior to heal her yes hmm but listen was he not a Healer in the Old Testament come on yeah and he was a father in the Old Testament as far as father you realize that every person in the world now listen please close ever born again I mean every person that's in this world has ever been in this world is a child of God by creation Satan cannot create so he's the father of all even the lost people that's right why because he created them that didn't make him the father he wanted to be he wanted to be a father over his own children he wanted to come and live in you and I to make us his offspring to make us him May manifest amen that's the only way he can be the father that's right it can't be any other way see the fall didn't make him father he was already a father the fall made him a redeemer the father was the father that's why Jesus could say our father he could speak back to a father he said well I don't understand that because he was God who was he praying to he was praying to his father who do you break it I pray to my father because now I know who my father really is yep all right okay you know that's right now what's the point reading these quotes to show the word is spoken about us in this let's get on with it okay paragraph 57 questions and answers 53 7 29 go right down to the bottom what I got under lines you read all the rest of us want to give it to you according as it's chosen Us in him before the foundation world that's pretty good isn't it that's not pretty good that's real good now listen to your profit before there was a foundation of the world God knew armor Neville and knew that he'd preached the gospel isn't that wonderful has chose why he's a member of the church and God knew he was going to have that church he said Paul was speaking to the Church of Ephesus said he has chosen Us in him now we're all the members of the body of Christ is that right and God before the world was ever formed chose you and I in him before the world was ever formed we might isn't that wonderful I read 43 the Perfection 1957 for 19. then my salvation your salvation tonight does not hinge upon the merits of our own Acts okay it hinged I like that past tense upon the positive Sovereign Grace of almighty God who has chosen Us in him certainly I could never be perfect nor you could never be perfect and we don't claim to be perfect but we have this one consolation that our faith rests in a perfect sacrifice that's already been received already been received run around said the minute you sin you want this quote the minute you sin he says already been taken care of man now it doesn't say that you can pay for it before you do it doesn't work so here's one we read this morning from questions and answers 123rd at 127 59 12 23. according to see is chosen as he hath he has chosen us that we didn't choose how could I choose 400 billion million billion trillion years ago how could I have chose him but he chose me amen oh brother wood that's it see chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy now don't try to make it yourself because you can't chosen than him five identifications of the True Church of the Living God paragraph 174 1969 11 the evening service he's coming down blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which bless us with all you remember my last two messages all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according listen let this shock you now according as he had past tense chosen Us in him at the last Revival that'll read it did I read that right according his chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world before the world look at here before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him enough having predestinated what did we do nothing what he done is what I'm looking at when did he do it chose us put her name on this book on this church book to be a member of this mythical mystical you how you pronounce it body before the world ever be none okay keep reading chosen in him see spoken words original seat 1962-318 paragraph 246 247 248 249 250 251 252. all right so we're gonna read a whole lot you'd be surprised what I got for the next and Wednesday night I got three pages out of church egg books already run off because I love to read what he says and to see that he keeps it talk and runs it through so that's what he said did we choose him huh oh right around him I I beg your pardon I didn't know you according to the word you didn't Jesus said you never chose me I chose you oh yeah when did he choose it when when Jesus say he chose his church before the foundation of the world according as he has chosen Us in him at the life Revival that Dr so-and-so had no no you might read that in a Creed a textbook but not in this one see according as he had chosen this in him before the foundation of the world when we were chosen at the last Revival the night we got saved why when when there wasn't no world was no star there was no atoms no molecules that's when we were chosen amen oh don't let me start preaching on that I'm just trying to explain something here all right before the foundation of the world that we should be what members know we should oh after we're saved we just do as we want to no we should be holding Without Blame before him membership no no it's love ain't it that's right all right in love excuse me I'm just cutting up I guess now I shouldn't do it all right you know having predestinated oh predestinated us unto the adoption of children the seed from the beginning no problem I'm living a seed the children of of children by Jesus Christ himself according to good pleasure as well who did it God when did he do it before the foundation of the world then if we come in in an illegitimate birth then we come in an illegitimate birth through ease corruption making us all her children a subject to death then the Sovereign God has to make a way to redeem his children what does redeem mean what does redeemed mean to go back where we come from then the Sovereign God has to make a way to redeem his children why all that the father had given me will come to me and no man can come unless my father draws him oh my where's your great big thing you've done you never done nothing you ought to be ashamed God who done all things the wheel is working just right Christ is a mystery of God reveal paragraph 1 6 182 1963 728 when did he choose us before the foundation of the world when this great hidden Mystery is great secret so you can tie the whole Christ The Mystery of God reveal to the what I'm talking about that he had a plan and a purpose and a hidden Mystery that he was going to be revealed he was going to reveal it it was all in there that he chose us now here's where the hidden Mystery is that's the Christ is the mystery of God revealed he didn't say Jesus is the mystery see Christ is the mystery all right Christ being the mission where's Christ at Christ in you I thought the Bible said the hope of glory I thought that's what the new word was right Jehovah Jireh part three not uh 62 707. paragraphs 57 . now let's background Abraham first God met Abraham unconditionally nobody made with Abraham not anything at all Abraham had nothing to do but believe God the Covenant was purely by grace and unconditional not if you will God said I have and now every man remember all Abraham's seed that ever come to God comes the same way not nothing you could do nothing you there's not nothing you could do you could not save yourself no more than you could take your boot stress but I won't used to protesting I really love it and jump up over the moon you cannot save yourself no man ever sought God is God seeking man you never chose me said Jesus I chose you 1964. 402 Jehovah Jireh part one progress 17. and that's the way it is in any life it takes God it ain't what you do it's what God does see you say I saw God I sought God you're mistaken no man seeks God God seeks the man see it's not you seeking God it's God seeking you Jesus said you haven't chose me but I chose you see so you're Joe so you're chose before the foundation of the world or you wasn't chose at all good point right you just come to redeem that name and all whose names are not on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundational World he's the only one's going to be there now you've got to tie together what he's saying because you know what he's not saying the point that the little words go Lord Foundation word he's the only one's going to be there anyhow because your name was not on the Book of Life it will never be there but if it's on the Book of Life you can't change you were chosen than him before the foundation of the world when the lamb was chosen then you were chosen with him before the foundation of the world and you are as I said last night an attribute of God's thinking see that's the only way you can be Eternal and only form of eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's so that's all he is the one that's eternal right all right going down God's only provided place of worship paragraph 271 1965 11 28 the morning service Moses was in him Joshua was in him and if you are in him you was in him before the foundation of the world the family of God you suffered for him you died with him you went to the cross with him you raised with him and now you're still with him sitting in Heavenly places reflecting the message of the age to the world the likes of the world right now how did we suffer in in things how did we die in him not that we were little bitty pieces running around in his body not that we were a DNA hook up in his body right it's the eternal life it was in him how were we before the world I don't want somebody on the tape gun so far and then they throw off and say oh that's what old brother so and so did all right let's bring it all back I don't care what Russell said I only tell you what I believe I believe you didn't come into the world with eternal life because he did Jesus Christ you didn't have to die that's right I don't solve that problem that should that statement should solve everything all right but you come into this world knowing god knowing one thing that you would want to be saying amen and that's just for knowledge transmitted over into Earthly times but the eternal life that you have in you was a part of God before the world ever begun come on there's not enough to eternal life and see then it's got to come down to a basis that I can be redeemed back to the eternal life that once was that's the only way I can be reading I can't be redeemed because I can quote a random or the things no I can only be redeemed because that I wish for the eternal life that I'm talking about it brother around and said you always was eternal that's the eternal life you have in you that always was eternal I never had a beginning right you see the people this quote always was eternal they won't go through the whole message to express see what God done for you and I that we had to come to this world and be lost and he had to come down and become one of us and had to die to release that life that's right amen that's right to worry could come back because there's no way to explain what the prophet is saying it's got to be revealed he said we were in him right now then he goes and says that despair in Jesus's side is what removed us from him explain that there's no human mortal on this Earth can express that and explained but around couldn't explain that come on show me the spirit of his side he said remove the bride which we understand now he was already dead when the spirit went in the shot right so you can't explain how that we could be inside it's just a way of saving things how else can you say it we was in him if we was in him we had to be removed somewhere when the spirit went into his side the blood and water came out which was his life but the life had already left the body and that blood didn't drop down on the earth and then happened to hit me and you get part of that there's no way to explain sometimes that's right I believe that's right you got to accept What God Says amen all right when are we going to get to the point that we can't accept you listen to what your Prophet had to say on a message being led of the Holy Spirit E30 which is 56 219 number 18 as you notice you don't understand there's no need in trying to explain it listen to it you just believed it I ain't trying to explain it no more are you reading what your Prophet said people's going to believe are well that's all I'm going to do about it that's up to God to do the rest I can't take his job now that's as honest a man this could be even right that he couldn't do it takes God to repeat it if God's not pulling on your heart strings it won't never work show faith and believing and if you're ordained to eternal life Jesus said no man can come to me except my to come to me anyhow except my father draws you that's right and if you were ordained to eternal life to see and believe you will and if you want it's just like pouring water on the Ducks back you need to do no good at all no matter how much you try to explain it those who God has chosen before the foundation of the world and if you are chose in God you were chosen not here you were chosen before the world began do you know that yeah and see what are we doing let me listen I just ran you the other one off we're running around talking about the the things they're saying that you can't come to me except the father drawers right now let's go back and read that scripture because you'll see that around always quotes it a certain way and there's only one time that the computer runs him that's using it this way no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him right around him says no man can come to me except the father draws him now did he change the scripture no that's what it said it's just not even he only used it one time let's see if I can find it it's on these numbers to get to you the ones we're on this afternoon number one number number 21 okay let me get number 21 would be the unconditional Covenant that God made with his people uh e26 page 54 3-0 I mean 54 306. man said oh brother I shot god I saw no man ever shot god not in a man to seek God no man at any time at any age ever saw God it's just vice versa God's seeking the man not man seeking God Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him is that right see that's the same still still the same way but around is quoting it then he draws it but see the scripture actually says no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him but random always says it draws you know changing scripture God is what he's doing but he's telling you what happens that's exactly what I've been trying to tell you all the whole service of what happened let's read that scripture and see what happened no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me now as he's in him came down went any right right John 6 44. with that May draw him Joy we're not of the same material he can't draw us the Bible calls us of the same source no man can come to God unless to Jesus said nobody can come to me except the father draws me see you can't be a son and daughter of God unless God has foreigned you to be so when he comes I will in no wise cast him out I'll give him everlasting life all of these quotes you'll find on Me on the same thing it's on this one talking about the fact that the father has to draw you first one quote said as I said on the death Pentecost you might have thought I was just trying to make a point this morning of some form but on the day of Pentecost they heard one sermon they did not hear three and a half years of preaching they heard one sermon about a man that had died on a cross and they were convicted in their heart how many people have heard sermons about a man dying on a cross I see God does the drawing and the Reason God does withdrawing is because his own it's his children he's drawing his children you're going to come to save his children there'll be a lot of people giving eternal life but he only come to save his children and when they come to Satan's offspring well brother now how do I know whether or not there's a quote on one of those there brother said you're sitting here he said something spoke in your heart that's right how many times have you ever heard him make this expression he said do you want something from God to raise your hand he said now it's impossible for you to raise your hand he said there has to be a spirit within you that's right right there's a spirit within you makes your hand go up right God is Not one's a problem with hitting you on the head and your hand don't go up right you know what I'm saying you become immobile that spirit he said you made a decision yes you say come down here and I'll pray for you people get up to come down he said when you left the seat you're healed he said cause you made a decision how many times you ever listen to the messages like that he said you made a decision what about the man that brought around spoke up that said he went everywhere all over to different preacher and all to try to be saved but around said you remember when you picked up that track the track red said where where you spend eternity come on your Prophet said and the man turned around he said you may not saved right there he said yes yeah but he didn't shouting crimes Glory had a look at it no he didn't but he believed it amen something spoke in the man's heart and he started searching for God how many of you can remember when God spoke to you in your heart and told you you're lost can you remember it the greatest time of your life was that day that's right because that's when God contacted you amen then you could do something about it that's right you could choose to accept him as your savior see that was the father of drawing him that was the positive of God drawing you from where you were did no man could come to the father but by Me Jesus name unless my father Johnson all right let's see it's not for everybody but we can't preach it's not for everybody about to preach it's murder everybody because we don't know who the children are that's right but it's only four of you Offspring on God Jesus said the one that sent me is once drawing you know what he was saying saying that's why I said brother I'm always just he usually says drawings you you didn't use that other points because that's what it's doing the one that led Jesus Christ in this life is the one that spoke to you and told you to turn around and run around talking did he say to Charlie he said Charlie the voice that told you one day stop and turn around he said one day the same voice would tell you to come up mine because it's the voice of God Elijah didn't care about the Thunder and the light in the clouds and the storms and everything else is going on it was a little still small boy what about it has the father been drawing you yes have you been drawn closer to God by the opening of his word or is it like I was saying this morning is it getting given from the prophet that it's getting dull and you go away and you go to other churches and do fine when are we going to get to the base of standing on What God Says you know somebody one of these days will understand you and say I'm changed does God be safe you gotta say you're sick you're healed you got to say that you're saved but he won't save you without it being said do you say well what do we do then why don't you just following that dude you follow that and it brought you to the church for some reason you're here today whether you're Christian or non-Christian well I'm here called mom and daddy made me come that's a good point yeah I hope and keep making you come until God gets to hold heavy but nobody can come to God unless the father draws you what about the drawing power in the stand again the drawing power of almighty God draw his people took place to receive eternal life what about a church eternal life the greatest thing that could ever be Jesus said all that the father had given me will come you think there's anything Satan can do to stop it you sure got a misconception of God in his ways another round of reference and one time about making a place to where his son would be safe and he said it wouldn't matter if you could pour concrete for I forgot how many wide it was and how deep and all and in case it around and he said no which if he's in God and take care of it why do we worry why are we scared why not all of the problems with people and you're going to start seeing them do it more and more people are losing their home by the millions now around the country losing their jobs losing everything thank God you got a home and a job right amen because they're falling apart now you keep falling apart for a while you're going to see them worse than it wasn't under depression because in a depression they at least was able to knew Mom and Daddy was at home and had something that went back home they went back to the farms and was able to make a living for a few years gonna the economy began to turn there's nowhere to go now all of our food he said well I'm going to buy some food all of your food there is no such thing as a storage anymore right everything is coming straight from the guy that's raising it straight to the camera and straight to the grocery store that's right there is no Surplus in America they won't let us do it but think of these things if we're in Christ we don't have to worry about nothing he took care of us all this way I told you I used to be as a human mortal I was kind of that away and always been I never did like to to venture out on a lot of things and you know and all and and going especially places and I was going down the road one day and I was going to Thomaston really on Highway 36 going down and going down to deer hunt with another time where Dean's brother and uh you know what I was thinking well I've never been this way before you know when they talked about her in the Bible said you ain't never been this way before you know kind of pull up tighter you know the other end and everyone is fixing to cross over because you ain't never been this way before when they hadn't and uh but in a minute there's just like something said well somebody's been this way before you're riding on a road that somebody made the roads got to be going somewhere so just follow it you know okay you don't have any problem sexy but I realize that road going to leave me somewhere around turn around and come back let's see think about it if you were chosen in him what great thing did you do when you got into this world if he chose you before the world what great thing did you do when you got here to make him want to choose you but you see we want to lay it all I want to find out we want to lay it all on the bases that he he uh looked down and saw forgive me for a second this is all for the message the church age book page 265 the sardesian church age and he said he's quoting the scripture no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me this is the one we're used at draw him draw him and we'll raise him up at the last day armenianism you know what armenianism is armenianism is works and deeds and doings Armenian to work arm you do you you done something to get saved me that's armenianism all right armenianism makes the will of the father not a sovereign purpose but merely a complacent desire as he stands back to see what all men would do with his goods and gracious gifts and even life eternal thank you armenianism is thinking that you had something to do with it you was good enough to be saved or are you done too much to be saved you know you ever had the devil tell you that you're just too mean to be saved well then I look back to find out the Bible that was the people he saved but around in the church a book he said he chose Moses he chose this one he chose that one he said what are they he said liars and different things right you go back and try to figure out what did any of them do Abraham gave his wife away a couple of times right one time he Matthew had the change of the body foreign my heart praise I want to talk to you about my father 's day I have a wonderful father get to know my natural baby I guess that's why I may be worried I can be like I am he passed away when I was about four years old but I found my real father and I found out what if Desiring is is to be a father like I've always told you my kids could never do enough wrong killings and murdering or whatever to make me the word and I would not say I was their father to make me deny them doing up wrong
