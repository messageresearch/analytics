[4:39] we'd like to try to bring this stop -
[4:42] not too close if we can now if you have
[4:45] questions and answers if we have them
[4:48] time tonight you can cover them but if
[4:50] don't you can write it down and we'll
[4:52] try to cover it you know to see if
[4:57] there's anything that needs to be
[4:59] covered is the main thing so that'll be
[5:01] your part but now this coming Sunday I'm
[5:06] going to Lord willing the way it goes
[5:09] right now I want to speak on something
[5:12] that I believe will be interesting for
[5:15] all of us and I would ask you to come
[5:20] and let's see maybe we can get some
[5:24] things to where we can look at it a
[5:27] little bit better and you know believe
[5:30] it but there's think on these things
[5:32] okay
[5:33] father we thank you for this day in your
[5:35] grace and we just ask you to help us and
[5:38] Lord to guide us in your grace and let
[5:41] your light shine father in our hearts
[5:43] that we may see you and want to walk in
[5:46] your love Lord just come down and touch
[5:48] this old back and make everything
[5:50] alright it clean us up in you that we
[5:54] may walk in your grace we love you and
[5:56] bless the word bless those that are sick
[5:58] you said you sent your word and healed
[6:00] us and delivered us from destruction so
[6:03] we thank you and just have your way Lord
[6:06] that's your light shine into our hearts
[6:09] in Jesus name now with all the topic
[6:18] Sundy but if I were you I just try to be
[6:23] here that's the best way to say if you
[6:26] can't at least get to take listen to it
[6:29] okay first Peter 1:13 or for a guard up
[6:36] the loins of your mind be sober and hope
[6:38] to the end for the grace that is to be
[6:40] returned to you at the revelation of
[6:44] Jesus Christ okay now let's go over to
[6:48] because I gave him a couple of more
[6:49] scriptures but maybe they can pull it up
[6:52] on revelations 4 1 & 2 all right after
[7:01] this I looked and behold a door was
[7:04] opened in heaven and the first voice
[7:07] which I heard was as it were of a
[7:09] trumpet talking with me which said come
[7:12] up hither and I will show thee things
[7:15] which must be Hereafter
[7:18] and immediately I was in the spirit now
[7:21] remember you get over in chapter 1
[7:25] remember he's in the spirit going to the
[7:28] Isle of Patmos and he's now he's here
[7:30] and he's getting he's in the spirit and
[7:33] we know what this represents
[7:35] because chapter 4 represents the rapture
[7:38] it's the going up of the bride all right
[7:41] but think on it now and immediately I
[7:44] was in the spirit and behold a throne
[7:45] was sitting
[7:46] and one sat on the throne you may be
[7:49] seated for that is blessing to the
[7:52] reading of the word now what I want to
[7:55] do is I covered it Sunday we listen to
[7:59] it again and trying to get our thoughts
[8:03] in mind to line up the word and you
[8:08] might order to keep these notes you'll
[8:11] especially that keep them you know and
[8:15] we are putting it on the internet that
[8:17] they will be getting all the notes
[8:19] tonight whether I read them or not
[8:21] alright and see that'll make it to work
[8:25] that at least they can understand maybe
[8:29] what we're trying to bring alright
[8:31] I said I'd try to cover a whole scope of
[8:34] the Pais 1213 messages try to bring it
[8:39] together for understanding purposes for
[8:42] all of us to see where we're at and
[8:45] what's taking place all right now you
[8:49] remember we started off in Revelations
[8:51] one and God said now I want you to know
[8:55] John who I am before I show you anything
[8:59] all right
[9:00] I wrote around and explains that on the
[9:02] Patmos vision you know all right he said
[9:06] I want you to know who I am now who is
[9:09] he
[9:11] this is supreme deity this is the Lord
[9:14] Jesus Christ speaking to John to bring
[9:19] the word run said that was the Lord
[9:23] appearing to John alright and the first
[9:26] thing he then covers once he gets that
[9:29] done I told you a secret to keep in mind
[9:32] if you would listen to it that what I
[9:35] would do would try to cover it and come
[9:38] back to this point all right now coming
[9:43] back to revelations 113 where it says
[9:47] there's one in the midst of seven golden
[9:49] candlesticks like under the Son of Man I
[9:52] said don't forget that because we're
[9:54] going to come back to that but we're
[9:57] going to come back to it in the last
[9:58] days
[10:00] now that's our point tonight is to try
[10:03] to get it down to where red and brother
[10:05] Branham says on the seven search ages
[10:07] says not a man this is a woman Girt
[10:10] about the paps he said it's the gospel
[10:14] that held the power and glory of God
[10:19] over the body of Christ all right now
[10:24] that's an odd thing to look at that
[10:26] you're seeing once then admit seven
[10:28] golden candle is like unto the Son of
[10:30] Man and then he describes what that is
[10:32] that it's the glory of God all right so
[10:38] it's it's bringing it to a position for
[10:41] us to have an understanding all right
[10:43] then we went on to why are we are not a
[10:46] denomination in brother branham's says
[10:49] and he turned to see one he saw one like
[10:52] the Son of man standing clothed how was
[10:55] it it was a bride standing in two
[10:58] candlesticks draw it out all right now
[11:02] remember our point back there was he's
[11:05] showing who he is which was the Lord
[11:08] Jesus Christ
[11:09] all right then he's showing where he's
[11:11] going and what he's going to be doing
[11:14] all right and he started to church ages
[11:16] now that starts chapter two all right so
[11:19] he's showing where he's going and what's
[11:22] going to take place and showed how
[11:24] beautiful perfect that he showed the
[11:27] bride that before she ever even started
[11:31] the ages what she looked like to him you
[11:34] remember that I'm trying to bring the
[11:36] point C to word that we can see the one
[11:39] standing in the midst of seven golden
[11:41] candlesticks is the Lord Jesus Christ in
[11:46] bride form or I are in the form of the
[11:49] bride or in Morphy the Bride of Christ
[11:53] coming forth to be not the son of man
[11:57] like that to be a person because if
[12:02] you'll remember in the book of
[12:04] revelations now think of this thought as
[12:07] we go through you don't see him as a
[12:11] person
[12:13] you see him in the Book of Revelations
[12:15] as a form he's in all right so you say
[12:21] yeah but he comes with here you know
[12:22] yeah but there's a form there he's
[12:25] taking a form for us to see it alright
[12:28] did the Prophet say this he said the
[12:30] Book of Revelations is like the acts of
[12:33] a play alright if we see the acts of a
[12:37] play you know what that means you got a
[12:39] scene then you go through it and you're
[12:42] never seen you go through it saying you
[12:44] go through it you keep on going to the
[12:46] end of the story
[12:48] alright now so we come up to her that we
[12:53] were talking about that the Prophet said
[12:57] on how can I overcome that where he's
[13:00] sitting on the throne he's not sitting
[13:02] on it he's sitting in the throne right
[13:07] not on the throne see it's in his domain
[13:11] all right now then being in the throne
[13:16] the baptism of the holy ghost all right
[13:19] now let's back up a higher now that's
[13:23] what I said I try to cover the whole
[13:25] thing let's back up a little bit you
[13:28] remember the Prophet told us that he
[13:30] always he comes in three sons names sort
[13:35] of man son of God son of David all right
[13:41] now so you may not have understood why I
[13:46] emphasize so much that you can't go from
[13:49] son of God to son of David
[13:52] I'm not emphasizing as much as I'm
[13:56] telling it like it is that's what your
[13:58] prophet said see something that's to
[14:04] happen in this end time that is to show
[14:07] us the way of all of it and what's now
[14:10] so only his strong then we went through
[14:14] I'll review these in a second what is
[14:17] the father strong is the baptism of the
[14:19] Holy Ghost right that came on the day of
[14:23] Pentecost he was on the earth
[14:26] now listen to this point and follow it
[14:30] the Old Testament gave birth to Jesus
[14:35] Christ right the prophet said to you
[14:39] know the Brethren said the prophets
[14:41] built the body all right John being the
[14:44] last one to introduce the head and then
[14:47] there he stood all right now when he
[14:51] came forth he came forth as son of man
[14:54] not son of God he came forth the son of
[15:00] man so the Old Testament gave birth to
[15:06] the son of man right now watch the point
[15:13] they gave birth to the word that's the
[15:17] son of man right
[15:20] Jesus was according to John 1:14 was the
[15:23] Word made flesh all right who is he then
[15:27] he's the son of man but now isn't it a
[15:31] hard situation to think about that when
[15:37] John introduced him he didn't introduce
[15:40] him as calling him the son of man what
[15:46] did John introduced Jesus as behold the
[15:51] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[15:53] the world
[15:54] all right in that Lamb of God what would
[15:57] he be a kinsman redeemer right which
[16:01] would be then once the Son of Man
[16:06] so John introduced the son of man but he
[16:11] didn't introduce him as this to say he's
[16:12] the son of man because all of this is in
[16:16] mystery and parts of a play and things
[16:19] that's got to be put together but he
[16:22] introduced him as the Lamb of God that
[16:25] takes away the sin of the world
[16:27] now don't forget that and don't forget
[16:29] that that Lamb of God is who the Son of
[16:33] Man the Redeemer the kinsman all of the
[16:39] things that goes in
[16:40] okay now he gave his life then release
[16:47] the life - were that not his strong he
[16:53] spoke of his strong his kingdom but it
[16:57] didn't come forth back there it had to
[17:00] be the Father's throne first Father's
[17:03] throne is the baptism with the Holy
[17:04] Ghost so the Lord Jesus as I tried to
[17:08] explain to you many times he came and
[17:11] gave His life to release that life that
[17:16] was within him so he goes from son of
[17:20] man right to the second stage or second
[17:25] scene of your movie that you're making
[17:30] or whatever you want to talk about
[17:31] that's to help the children to see it
[17:34] you all right and he comes from the Son
[17:37] of Man the Son of God the Son of God now
[17:42] is not his throne son of God is the
[17:47] Father's throne
[17:49] that sounds odd to be look like it would
[17:52] be maybe the other way but that's the
[17:53] way it's been explained and that's where
[17:55] your prophet explained it all right the
[17:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the father
[18:01] strong the son of man the Lord Jesus
[18:05] Christ as acting out two parts of the
[18:08] play for his part you know the scenes of
[18:12] things he comes forth as to be her
[18:16] kinsman you know and as he does he
[18:19] releases that life that life comes back
[18:22] into the church on the death any cost it
[18:28] comes back a son of God see they
[18:32] couldn't understand that when he said
[18:33] who two men say either son of man
[18:36] Peter said dark the Christ the Son of
[18:38] the Living God all right watch the point
[18:41] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[18:43] the gates of Hell can't prevail
[18:47] so he said you didn't understand what I
[18:49] say it I asked you who you say the son
[18:52] of man is and said you answered who or
[18:55] what that I'm going to and that's what
[18:59] I've always been amazed with the
[19:01] perfection of the Bible because what if
[19:06] what if John had her you know what if
[19:09] Peter had said something else me but he
[19:15] asked him who the son of man were he
[19:16] said you're the Christ the Son of the
[19:18] Living God the Christ is the creator God
[19:22] the Son of Man is not the creator he
[19:27] said well that's just all it is it's
[19:29] just all one God but it's the acts of a
[19:32] play or taking partake in place as each
[19:37] manifestation of God we believe in many
[19:40] of those but the one true and living God
[19:42] all right but he goes through son of man
[19:46] releasing the life and come back onto
[19:49] their Pentecost as son of God the
[19:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[19:55] all right he comes over into the Book of
[19:59] Revelations and he does what I said
[20:02] there to start with
[20:03] he tells John down John I'm going to
[20:06] show you the future but said first I
[20:09] want you to know who I am all right so
[20:13] he showed him who he was and all about
[20:14] the Christ you know all the things the
[20:17] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[20:18] end
[20:19] he said now I'm going to show you where
[20:21] I'm going he said I'm going to a
[20:26] morphine ow change my form to the
[20:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost or bring that
[20:37] BA or that part into being and the
[20:40] baptism with the Holy Ghost would come
[20:43] onto their Pentecost to start the
[20:46] Father's throne or his kingdom or his
[20:48] domain all right but he said I want to
[20:52] show you where I'm going before I say
[20:57] anything
[20:59] so what did he showing he showed him the
[21:04] bride are you with me
[21:08] he showed him revelations 1:13 one
[21:12] standing in the midst of seven golden
[21:13] candlesticks like unto the Son of Man he
[21:16] showed him all the way down to the age
[21:19] that we're living that's what I tried to
[21:22] get to the point to you for you look at
[21:23] he showed how perfect the bride was
[21:27] before she ever sinned you remember I
[21:31] tried to emphasize that because the
[21:34] church ages have got bad and good you
[21:37] got people doing wrong you got things to
[21:39] be repented of you got rebukes you've
[21:41] got all kind of things well yet God
[21:43] before it ever started
[21:45] he didn't just show him starting on the
[21:49] bride he showed him all the way to the
[21:51] end and that end would be when standing
[21:57] in the midst of seven golden candle see
[21:59] like unto the Son of man so he shows
[22:04] that now that once Jesus was crucified
[22:11] all right that he would never be back on
[22:15] earth in a corporal body until the
[22:25] millennial reign right is that the words
[22:28] of the Prophet we meet him in the ire he
[22:31] doesn't come here we meet him in the
[22:34] earth all right now then it'll be a
[22:36] corporal body in the Millenium and he'll
[22:40] be on his throne then son of David okay
[22:44] so then down to seven Church ages then
[22:50] we kept emphasizing over and over each
[22:52] church age gets the revelation of his
[22:54] deity each church age gets a explanation
[23:00] or a defining of what they're the
[23:03] overcomer of that age would receive then
[23:10] he comes down and he writes the ages
[23:13] and he brings us through the seven
[23:16] churches okay down to seven Church ages
[23:21] it was son of God because that's the
[23:26] baptism when the Holy Ghost in the
[23:28] people but in this age now if you want
[23:34] these are the father whatever you know I
[23:36] mean what you need if you needed
[23:38] father's strong he is sitting on the
[23:41] Father's throne
[23:42] now this is from the message the
[23:45] identified Christ of all ages it's been
[23:53] when he died rose assented sit back the
[23:57] Holy Spirit that was the son of God now
[24:00] this is identify Christ of all ages
[24:01] number ten if they pulled it up for
[24:04] another God is experienced through the
[24:07] church ages it's been son of God and
[24:09] then in the Millennium that son of David
[24:11] sitting on the throne ruling he has
[24:14] ascended up he that overcomes to sit
[24:16] with me on my throne is I've overcome
[24:18] and sat down on my father's from he is
[24:20] sitting on the Father's throne
[24:22] now but in the Millennium he sets a
[24:28] process upon his own throne because he's
[24:31] the son of David now he is the son of
[24:34] man son of God son of David he's all of
[24:38] that but it's showing the acts of a play
[24:42] if you study the book of Revelation and
[24:44] talking to the chiropractor today about
[24:46] it he said why you don't appreciate my
[24:47] said well I'm in the book of Revelation
[24:49] he said well almost everybody kind of
[24:51] shines away from that I said it's one of
[24:53] those wonderful things for me I said
[24:56] it's according wants you and what you
[24:58] can understand I said if you just think
[25:01] about it it's being the acts of a play
[25:06] you know what else can you say to
[25:08] somebody like that but that's the key if
[25:10] they just think he said hey that's good
[25:13] just the acts of a play being unfolded
[25:17] he started it
[25:19] work started it back in the creation of
[25:23] the world and come down through and he
[25:26] would speak
[25:27] man son of man son of man all the
[25:29] prophets but he only spoke like once or
[25:33] twice a son of God like the three Hebrew
[25:35] children one lakh under the son of God
[25:37] all right he would speak of that but
[25:40] that son of man would be coming through
[25:42] so if you were making a movie you would
[25:45] be bringing him up from the Old
[25:47] Testament and one day a baby would be
[25:50] born and that baby would be the Son of
[25:55] Man the Lord Jesus Christ God in human
[25:59] flesh then you'd bring him up through
[26:02] his life and then you'd bring him to his
[26:05] death Calvary and releasing of the life
[26:08] and it would change forms he would in
[26:12] morphe from the form that he was in into
[26:16] the bride to come down through seven
[26:20] Church ages as son of God the spirit God
[26:27] dwelling in man father's strong new in
[26:34] the Millennium he would be the son of
[26:36] David what is it the same God all the
[26:39] time just changing his mask right all
[26:44] right
[26:45] now he changes his mask so down through
[26:50] seven church ages now you got him as son
[26:54] of God now how are you going to get to
[26:57] the Millennium these are is the key that
[27:03] man doesn't understand and I'm just as
[27:05] honest to say it to you the people of
[27:08] this message don't understand that
[27:10] because I'm too honest to tell you I've
[27:12] listened I've never heard it you said
[27:15] well ice exalted we'll do what you want
[27:17] to about that that ain't got nothing to
[27:18] do with me when I preach the gospel I
[27:21] preach from my own point I don't care
[27:22] what anybody else believes none of my
[27:25] business what anybody teaches in their
[27:26] church and what they do I'm not on the
[27:29] internet to try to correct anybody I
[27:31] preach if you want to go on the internet
[27:34] you want to listen that's fine that's
[27:36] your business we just remember I'm not
[27:39] your pastor
[27:41] if you call me and bite me your pastor
[27:44] send your tithes and that'll be you I
[27:46] can be that pastor thataway
[27:49] but I'm not gonna try in no way to pull
[27:52] people to the message but I've taught
[27:55] this all the way down to try to get
[27:58] people to see it for over 40 years to
[28:02] see this point of what I'm illustrating
[28:04] tonight how that God changes his form
[28:08] from son of man the Old Testament
[28:11] prophets gave birth to the word
[28:14] now if you look go to masterpiece she's
[28:17] not out with a shocked birth pains you
[28:22] hear all of these things the Prophet is
[28:25] saying alright and see if you don't then
[28:30] you say well I can't understand that
[28:32] well you won't go listening those times
[28:34] so it's not my fault see I'd do
[28:38] everything I can i crying praying he
[28:41] even told bro that once you said I don't
[28:43] you standing up there hurting I don't
[28:46] care this gospel has got to be preached
[28:50] if it's preached for my bedside let it
[28:53] be I want to see the word made alive
[28:59] it's got to be made alive in this
[29:02] endtime people sure we saw it for a
[29:07] moment in the Prophet I mean oh I didn't
[29:10] see it but some of you did you saw that
[29:12] and have always tried to illustrate it
[29:15] you saw the the master of the world for
[29:19] a moment when that bull wasn't laid out
[29:24] who was that God in that man not the man
[29:29] the Hornets that was God doing that
[29:33] showing it but he was showing what he's
[29:35] gonna do this in Thai bride that's what
[29:38] people don't believe you know how they
[29:43] quote it like one brother said they
[29:45] quote it all God was reporting the cross
[29:47] all crossing into brother Branham and he
[29:50] died and took it with it then we've got
[29:51] nothing left
[29:53] you see you're not talk like that why
[29:56] not it's what a lot of people believe
[29:59] because they're sitting around now well
[30:01] we don't know what to do
[30:02] hey we faced it some of you were old
[30:05] enough I wasn't Darwin the Prophet was
[30:08] there but by 68 what was they doing
[30:14] wondering who do we follow are we
[30:18] supposed to follow brother so-and-so is
[30:19] he the son of man it's either this is
[30:21] either that or is he the Elijah who's
[30:23] there I appreciate brother Billy Paul
[30:27] coming out there one day when was up
[30:29] there he came out cuz everybody says who
[30:31] is Elijah who's Elijah he said I just
[30:34] listened to a tape the other day and I
[30:36] know who Elijah is he said called my
[30:39] daddy said Elijah this day was the Lord
[30:42] Jesus Christ well that helped a lot of
[30:47] people who didn't have everybody cuz it
[30:49] didn't change nothing but now listen
[30:51] let's get a point
[30:53] follow my point now the Old Testament
[30:57] gave birth to the word which was the
[31:00] Lord Jesus Christ the Son of Man that's
[31:04] why he kept referring to himself as the
[31:07] Son of Man he didn't refer to himself as
[31:09] son of God
[31:10] that was not the office to come into
[31:12] being at that time he had to die to
[31:14] release that that was within him that
[31:17] could come back on the people to bring
[31:20] the kingdom of the baptism of the Holy
[31:22] Ghost back into the church which then
[31:24] would be God or as Paul said it Christ
[31:26] in you the hope of glory same God with a
[31:31] different form a different manifestation
[31:35] so goes down through seven Church ages
[31:38] as son of God in Watchmen gamma as the
[31:44] old testament gave birth as the prophets
[31:49] gave birth what was happening in the
[31:52] ages in the church ages it was coming
[31:59] forth and molding that body
[32:04] Jesus Christ then who is about if you
[32:07] you are the born-again believer is the
[32:11] body of Jesus Christ right so it was
[32:14] coming forth molding that into being and
[32:18] the life would strike that a little man
[32:22] would walk out there and he'd start
[32:25] preaching and as I've emphasized over
[32:28] and over don't mean a thing maybe to you
[32:30] but he sure does to me none of those
[32:33] people understood son of man Paul and in
[32:36] the embrace of it it's like a mystery it
[32:42] was hidden and yet Jesus priests
[32:46] constantly son of man son of man son
[32:48] who's the soul or the seed how long
[32:50] could we stay on this for years because
[32:54] you can go into the masterpiece and all
[32:56] of those things because Jesus Christ is
[32:58] the story of the seed according to the
[33:00] Bible the Son of Man come on then here
[33:07] comes a prophet in the high stage walks
[33:09] out and what's his purpose to sow the
[33:14] seed now our wind spoken-word original
[33:18] seed so the seed of the entire Bible
[33:23] right was that brother branham's purpose
[33:26] or his manifestation or whatever you
[33:30] want to call it here's part that he was
[33:33] to bring and you see then right during
[33:36] the lies - of ending up of lady of SIA
[33:41] that here comes a profit on the scene
[33:44] and ever service he's telling that son
[33:47] of man son of man son of man son of man
[33:56] he was
[33:58] claims that he was son of God through
[33:59] the ages within the last days has got to
[34:02] come back to a different form now there
[34:05] is were your catchiest see everybody
[34:09] says there's only three sons night and
[34:11] that's quote from rota brown am I gonna
[34:12] give them to you three sons nine son of
[34:18] God I said oh man it's Oh God
[34:20] son of David but then to find what he
[34:24] says to get the answer to the situation
[34:30] that gives hope to be able to go from
[34:33] son of God to the millennial reign or to
[34:37] get there
[34:38] remember there's got to be a rapture
[34:40] there's got to be a change of these
[34:42] bodies there's got to be all of that
[34:44] before the millennium comes into being
[34:47] right and in the Millennium he sits on
[34:51] the throne it's not we are there with
[34:54] him as the bride but I tried to explain
[34:58] to you do we look at her throne we want
[35:00] to try to get everybody up on the throne
[35:02] let's sit down in our thoughts know the
[35:07] baptism with the Holy Ghost is the
[35:10] throne of God in your heart and soul and
[35:15] when it comes to that in the Millennium
[35:17] there'll be a throne just like over in
[35:22] Revelation 4:1 it comes to a throne you
[35:32] take Revelation 4:1 now you got a hopes
[35:34] of being able to connect between the
[35:37] ages and the Millennium the Old
[35:44] Testament gave birth the word what do
[35:48] you think this is for the bride across
[35:49] to do I mean or do we just sit around
[35:52] here and walk off or wait on this or we
[35:54] don't matter whatever I mean at least at
[36:02] least we could try to live so that
[36:08] Christ would be happy about this age
[36:12] we've listened to another day I've
[36:14] mentioned it many times but around
[36:16] talking about the Azusa Street people he
[36:18] said they were closer to the coming of
[36:19] the Lord and we are now what was he
[36:22] talking about he wasn't talking about
[36:24] the word right come on he wasn't talking
[36:27] about the word they didn't have started
[36:30] it started being returning but what's he
[36:32] talking about the lives they were living
[36:37] you reckon that might be the reason
[36:39] we're here fifty years after the Prophet
[36:48] maybe it's in that connection all right
[36:51] but let's start right here okay brothers
[36:54] go ahead to the number 12 and we'll pick
[36:57] up and try to get her thought if I'm a
[36:59] little over I'll try not to I just want
[37:02] to bring this to a conclusion to where
[37:06] you can look at it and you'll see what
[37:08] I'm talking about whether you believe it
[37:11] or not that's up to you it ain't up to
[37:14] me to reveal it I can't do it
[37:16] I didn't reveal it to myself and the
[37:20] Lord showed me in 1969 if the bride
[37:22] would be the son of man I've told that
[37:28] over and over people - oh you just he's
[37:30] not know I've always said it like this
[37:33] everybody's always told off on brother
[37:35] Peregrine all he just a bragger he's a
[37:38] bright guy says he's been to 164
[37:42] countries well you know what I say it
[37:44] and I wouldn't have cared for anybody
[37:46] told him what I said I said if he's been
[37:49] to 164 countries
[37:50] he ain't bragging he's telling the truth
[37:52] if he's been there but if he'd been 263
[37:55] lied because he said he was 164 so
[38:00] that's how easy it is to be a lie all
[38:03] right see I tried my best to get two
[38:07] people to see back then the Word of God
[38:12] okay but listen
[38:16] let's go to number on we want number 12
[38:18] which is God's provided place of worship
[38:21] all right roll it on up to where we get
[38:24] to coach you can read in between a lot
[38:27] son of man into the church will come
[38:30] through justification through Luther
[38:32] through sanctification through Wesley
[38:35] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:37] are the Pentecostals and go right on
[38:40] into the perfection of the Son of Man
[38:46] oh you mean there's more than just a the
[38:52] Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:55] you're in bad shape if you don't know no
[38:57] better than I I'd invite you to go to
[39:01] masterpiece and listen to your prophet
[39:03] when he said Mary was not the seed she
[39:09] was only a carrier of it he said cause
[39:13] the seed is the Lord Jesus Christ now
[39:16] did he mean Mary didn't get the baptism
[39:19] of the Holy Ghost no she did get that
[39:24] right it means what this is not the seed
[39:31] he's the seed he's everything listen to
[39:38] him through the baptism of the Holy
[39:41] Ghost or the Pentecostal and go right on
[39:43] into the perfection or the son of man
[39:46] that when husband and wife will be the
[39:49] same self persons God will be so
[39:52] manifested into his bride his church
[39:55] till they'll both be the same they are
[39:59] one now you see where we're at now we
[40:02] start right there to see a point if the
[40:09] Old Testament gave birth to Jesus Christ
[40:12] now what's going to give birth to Jesus
[40:15] Christ in the last days are we going out
[40:17] of here of a flowery bed of these and
[40:19] got nothing we just are we just floating
[40:21] along we just you know I always say
[40:25] waiting on the bus to pull up or
[40:26] something huh no
[40:29] maybe we were to realize what's taking
[40:31] place the reason that we're here you
[40:37] know he's always been ready but what did
[40:41] the prophets say said he's waiting on
[40:43] the what his weight said wasn't the
[40:48] readiness of the bride now the readiness
[40:52] is of the bride would have to do with
[40:56] the opening of God's Word so if you see
[41:01] what I'm driving at then we'll read the
[41:03] quote driving it one thing the Old
[41:06] Testament gave birth to the word which
[41:08] was the son of man he shows in
[41:12] Revelations 1:13 what it will wind up
[41:15] being in the after the church ages is
[41:18] over in the end of it and it's one lakh
[41:20] under the son of man Girt about the paps
[41:22] for the golden girl
[41:23] because it's not in the bride coming
[41:26] back to be a physical neither did the
[41:29] prophets give birth to Jesus Christ Mary
[41:32] gave birth come on if you're gonna be
[41:34] carnal I'll be carnal will you
[41:36] the prophets never gave birth it was
[41:41] Mary that gave birth when she gave birth
[41:44] to the world that was brought to her and
[41:52] she said be it unto me according to thy
[41:53] word and she gave birth to Jesus Christ
[42:01] now the Prophet said then go right on
[42:05] into the perfection of the Son of Man
[42:09] when the husband and bride will you not
[42:13] together all right
[42:16] you see what is expected in this life
[42:19] days and like I said it it odd with the
[42:25] odds and I say that's all right it's
[42:27] just odd to me that before he ever
[42:29] started talking to the church ages he
[42:31] showed where the bride would go to to be
[42:34] one standing in the midst of the seven
[42:36] golden candle see like him to the Son of
[42:38] Man rode around said the bride draw it
[42:39] out
[42:43] who's gonna give birth
[42:45] I thought your prophet said she's to be
[42:51] delivered of a new birth from according
[42:53] to Malachi 4
[42:54] I said birth names I'm pretty sure all
[42:58] right see what do you saying brother
[43:01] Dale is far we've got to give birth to
[43:03] the word no no no brother Adam doing
[43:08] that now the Earth's word you're wrong
[43:09] because you're making him the son of man
[43:15] well brother Dale you preach the bride
[43:17] right what I preach it as the Prophet
[43:20] said it because there's not a physical
[43:29] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to be
[43:33] here until the millennial reign so it
[43:38] will be the acts of the play it will be
[43:40] the opening of the word
[43:42] it'll be just what I said the prophets
[43:45] of the old kept bringing that word it
[43:47] kept building that body starting with
[43:49] Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and all and
[43:51] it just kept building and finally one
[43:54] day John stepped out and said behold the
[43:59] lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[44:01] the world what did brother run say in
[44:03] the church in the spoken words original
[44:06] seed he said this prophet will be
[44:09] pointing I'm pretty sure it's not but I
[44:11] know I'll find it for you he said this
[44:13] prophet would be pointing to the skies
[44:16] at the word born right you see yeah but
[44:25] brother Dale you've always preached like
[44:27] bride bride said you you seem to leave
[44:31] brother branham out of it hey we
[44:35] wouldn't even know what to talk about
[44:36] without him he'll get that off of you
[44:40] get that part away from you to think
[44:43] that we're trying to do away with the
[44:44] bride because that's what I'm trying to
[44:46] place who introduced Jesus Christ who
[44:53] called him the Lamb of God the
[44:56] take away the sin of the world the
[44:57] Elijah of number three right John the
[45:04] Baptist so that shows you the play and
[45:07] the acts and what it's going to be it's
[45:09] going to take one to come in the end
[45:11] time to introduce Jesus Christ yeah he's
[45:16] not not what your prophet done you come
[45:22] to introduce Jesus Christ they said
[45:27] that's where the people can't keep it
[45:28] straight he said I'm not the son of man
[45:33] he saw I am a son of man I've gotta
[45:37] clean here will read it them in here
[45:40] he said the son of man is the Lord Jesus
[45:43] Christ and no way in the world am i
[45:48] trying to preach something that elevates
[45:50] the people above their God I've tried to
[45:53] make that plain when it says they were
[45:56] thrown
[45:57] I made it playing there's one on that
[46:00] song you got to put the rest of us
[46:04] around it yeah
[46:05] but not on it cuz we're not the king and
[46:10] even the Queen don't sit on the king's
[46:12] throne she has to sit beside of him
[46:15] that's alright but in the natural but
[46:18] she don't get on the king's throne as
[46:22] she does she's King the church
[46:31] John introduced the lamb in other words
[46:37] he brought forth I brought into the open
[46:41] this is the Lamb of God and the lamb of
[46:45] God stood after and told who he was the
[46:47] son of man now there is no physical
[46:51] coming I've tried my best I was
[46:53] listening to that yesterday we would
[46:56] there is no way that you've got any
[46:58] Bible or the prophets message in any way
[47:02] to bring anything about the son of man
[47:06] because you know coming physical
[47:09] Perl because the son of man is the Lord
[47:12] Jesus Christ and we meet him in the
[47:14] Millennium we meet him in the air going
[47:16] to the marriage supper yes but he
[47:18] doesn't come here in a corporal body but
[47:23] he's got to have a body see when we
[47:27] leave out of here he'll have a body
[47:28] he'll have them two prophets standing
[47:30] here with the word that's where wager on
[47:32] that I wish you'd listen over and over
[47:35] brother branham striking that in the
[47:37] seal book and striking those two
[47:39] prophets and opening that seal you
[47:41] remember what he said he said I had to
[47:43] get up and walk out come on are you
[47:48] listening so what'd he say he said I had
[47:50] to get up Walker you know why because he
[47:53] knew that if them two prophets was gonna
[47:57] open that seal he knew what was taking
[48:00] place that day in his own life he was
[48:08] not the Son of Man but telling the
[48:10] difference was the body butter I'm
[48:14] talking about me and you've been God he
[48:15] said only difference is the body right
[48:19] he's the body we can't beat the body by
[48:22] the way no physical we can't make her
[48:24] body but we're the body of Christ the
[48:27] body of Christ down through 7 Church
[48:29] ages gave birth brother Branham was not
[48:38] the messenger of Lady of seha come on
[48:42] we've been through that you think he was
[48:44] he said he wasn't he said you'd make me
[48:47] wrong if you make me the messenger he
[48:50] said no see he's 2 when it comes at the
[48:53] end of the age he coming to end of lady
[48:57] Oh seal not at the beginning we've been
[49:01] over and over and over to try to get you
[49:03] to see it but what did he say go ahead
[49:12] to number 13 brothers because he's got
[49:16] to come back to do something God he's
[49:18] got to come back in the end time to be
[49:20] able to
[49:22] do a work and take us to meet Jesus in
[49:26] the Millenium cuz we're supposed to be
[49:28] that right is that true now we're
[49:31] supposed to be there on a honeymoon with
[49:32] our husband in the Millennium is that
[49:35] true
[49:35] we Baptist out that not using the
[49:39] wording like that as much but it was the
[49:42] fact that he was the to be the son of
[49:44] David and that we sat on the throne with
[49:48] him
[49:52] listen I've told you over and over
[49:54] whether you like it or whether you don't
[49:56] like me at all that's alright but we
[49:58] ain't gonna get on the throne it's got
[50:00] to be in the throne and you know what
[50:02] that's already here right now the
[50:05] baptism when the Holy Ghost is here
[50:07] right now not to wait one of these days
[50:12] no it's not one of these days listen to
[50:13] what he said he's coming down
[50:17] congregation so had to come according to
[50:20] the scriptures a prophet now watch that
[50:23] in a second hold on to it he never
[50:25] called himself the Son of God he called
[50:27] himself the son of man the Prophet is
[50:31] the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:32] alright but now he is through the church
[50:36] ages now he has been son of God in the
[50:41] Millennium he'll be son of David sitting
[50:43] on David's strong but between this time
[50:47] now what time to quotes who got in
[50:55] between the times now what time in
[50:58] between the Son of God and the son of
[51:02] David he's coming back for just for a
[51:06] moment
[51:09] hey don't miss me up then cuz brother
[51:13] Brandon was the first one started
[51:14] talking about son of man so you know
[51:17] where the emphasis is I put it that's so
[51:20] close just don't make it go over too far
[51:24] and you'll make him deity now I was like
[51:31] I stood up Jeffersonville and the man
[51:32] standing out to her said you you believe
[51:34] brother Branham was deity
[51:36] said this brother I pulled over I said
[51:38] that brother there has a baptism with
[51:39] the Holy Ghost and you were if you'll
[51:41] agree with me that that's deity standing
[51:44] there by the new birth I'll agree with
[51:46] you brother branham was deity oh no I
[51:50] said forget it
[51:52] I turned and walked off his point was
[51:58] not I was putting it I believe every
[52:01] born-again believers deity is that the
[52:04] words of your prophet but you see we're
[52:09] not that beauty huh in the Millennium
[52:12] he'd be son of David sitting on David's
[52:14] throne but between this time we find out
[52:17] by the scriptures evidently he must have
[52:21] had it lined up he is to reveal himself
[52:23] again a son of man a prophet then you
[52:31] can start with brother Branham in his
[52:32] ministry but it'll climax in the earth
[52:37] son of man go ahead to the next one what
[52:40] is it that was off of the then we're
[52:43] going to the unveiling of God notice now
[52:46] I'll tell you a little story behind this
[52:49] most of you heard it what you see I know
[52:52] that I'm technical I know that I'm
[52:58] arrogant and hateful and sarcastic and
[53:01] anything you want to put on there you
[53:03] don't have to worry about it I know I'm
[53:04] that all right but see it always
[53:08] bothered me when he said three sons now
[53:15] son of God I mean son of man son of God
[53:18] son of David well I knew there was
[53:21] something wrong in my understanding or
[53:26] you know he was wrong in what are you
[53:29] saying
[53:29] oh you mean you thought like that yeah
[53:32] and so did you so don't look at me you
[53:36] did too you thought he was wrong and
[53:39] something he said until it was revealed
[53:41] to you all right
[53:44] but you see we had an old time
[53:49] battery-powered which would Electric
[53:50] would work but it'd run off of batteries
[53:52] a tape recorder to play 70s reels most
[53:56] of you remember them and so we they was
[54:00] like five of us riding to work which one
[54:03] was not even in the message but he had
[54:05] to be listening and one day he said if
[54:07] we're gonna listen turn that thing up
[54:10] where I'd hear it alright cuz he just
[54:15] died life and the things brother Brennan
[54:16] was telling you no but we all had a time
[54:19] of choosing a message like I take Monday
[54:22] than those two you mean to order well
[54:26] for about three days or four days in a
[54:28] row nobody brought an extra message
[54:30] I was listening to the unveiling of God
[54:33] I said Lord say something that I ain't
[54:39] getting because I realized that there's
[54:42] three sons named so no man
[54:45] so no God son of David no how are we
[54:50] going to get to the son of David there
[54:52] is no way of just picking up something
[54:55] and laying it over the heart the last
[55:01] day three or four days in a row here it
[55:03] came I finally got it you read it
[55:06] notice now he came first as the Prophet
[55:12] with you and they crucified him now who
[55:16] is that the Lord Jesus Christ right
[55:18] lisanna plan his own crucified him he
[55:22] came as the son of man then after the
[55:26] Holy Spirit came he was then the son of
[55:29] God God is the spirit he was the Holy
[55:33] Spirit son of God he lives through the
[55:35] church ages at son of God now in the
[55:38] Millennium hit me son of David sitting
[55:41] upon the throne of his father David he's
[55:43] the son of David now cuz he is - you and
[55:45] I are going to understand you know at
[55:49] sickens me people say who do you pray to
[55:53] do we pray to the Father or do we pray
[55:56] for the son or do we pray that the Holy
[55:58] go
[56:01] he never had people to say that to you
[56:03] who did we pray to see if we don't have
[56:10] to explain to him who he is what has to
[56:13] be explained and who we think he is or
[56:16] our statements are he knows who he is
[56:20] well when the day comes that we know who
[56:23] he is
[56:26] it'll all be settled rah
[56:28] and remember between the Son of God in
[56:34] the labium States in church age they put
[56:37] him out and who did they put out they
[56:42] put really this message out right
[56:44] they put this prophet out right but who
[56:47] was it being put out did he not say one
[56:50] day he said it's not you they're against
[56:53] this mean that's how close it it's very
[56:56] close but it's still not not close
[56:58] enough to make it to be what we're
[57:00] talking about all right
[57:02] and remember between the son of God in
[57:05] the ladies in church hey they put him
[57:07] out and in Luke he said he would be
[57:09] revealed again as son of man the Prophet
[57:13] fulfilling the rest of it see the
[57:16] scriptures type perfectly together son
[57:19] of man son of God son of David what was
[57:22] it it's the same God all the time just
[57:25] changing his form in morphe he just
[57:28] changed it's a great drama to him he is
[57:32] acting it out and see coming up there's
[57:35] got to be okay then you got to sex him
[57:38] clean him but you can read that see
[57:39] where it was rejected and what does he
[57:42] do now now what does he do now return as
[57:49] son of the man I see nobody knew that
[57:55] you know what I'm talking about your
[57:57] denominational people I still don't know
[57:59] that with your theologian they didn't
[58:01] know that he was to come back a son of
[58:05] man cuz they could count three sons
[58:09] named are we is that the way the people
[58:12] the messy do it
[58:13] three sons none brother Dale you're
[58:16] making four out of something and I love
[58:19] this but it goes sour but they'll say
[58:22] four you got son of man son of God son
[58:27] of man son of David
[58:29] that's Fogler and a four is an
[58:33] antichrist number you know it's direct
[58:35] quote but force an antichrist number
[58:39] black white yellow I mean white and gray
[58:43] you know you got four but remember also
[58:46] four is the number of restoration
[58:49] justification of Saint case and baptism
[58:51] of the Holy Ghost and the word let's see
[58:56] we're so smart all four words an
[58:58] antichrist brother the hell they don't
[58:59] understand these numbers he's an
[59:01] antichrist number evidently your prophet
[59:05] didn't understand it because I'm reading
[59:08] what he said okay I kind of think he
[59:13] understood it don't you see how close we
[59:16] are son of man son of David son of God
[59:19] he is revealed in the last days the son
[59:22] of man according to Malachi 4 all the
[59:27] rest of the prophecies pertaining to
[59:29] this hour no more dealing with the
[59:31] church i-tree they put him out on the
[59:34] outside knocking at the door some
[59:37] predestinated seat in there yet he must
[59:40] get to them the in-between now we've got
[59:49] hopes of understanding because we got
[59:53] something in between son of God and son
[59:57] of David
[59:57] I don't like it worth something but
[1:00:02] heaven help me the son of man is gonna
[1:00:09] come back in the life stage
[1:00:15] that's according to your prophet the son
[1:00:19] of man is to come back in the life stage
[1:00:21] but where's he going to be
[1:00:23] where's he showed in Revelations 1:13
[1:00:28] the people you don't read and listen you
[1:00:32] know that brother Branham says
[1:00:33] revelations 1:13 is the same as a
[1:00:37] revelations 10:1 you need that same as
[1:00:50] revelations 10:1 revelation of 10:1 is a
[1:00:54] angel standing there and see we put it
[1:00:59] all brother Branham come on I told you
[1:01:04] winds died Sunday where I stand
[1:01:06] brother Branham is not least on a man
[1:01:10] but he was a son of man okay now but
[1:01:14] remember he is also a member of the body
[1:01:19] of Christ now come on and you'll get why
[1:01:22] that when the angel appeared to the man
[1:01:25] back there and said brother Branham you
[1:01:26] were higher no wonder he's a born-again
[1:01:29] believer
[1:01:30] he's a manifested son of God
[1:01:33] he's an adopted son of God he is a
[1:01:37] prophet
[1:01:38] no wonder he's greater than any of the
[1:01:41] rest is that his statements are you
[1:01:48] listening and remember between the son
[1:01:57] of God in the lady you see in church age
[1:02:00] they put him out and in Luke he said he
[1:02:04] would reveal it be revealed again a son
[1:02:07] of man the prophet fulfilling the rest
[1:02:10] of it return
[1:02:18] back is sort of man okay
[1:02:23] now give me a little time and let me
[1:02:25] read some time because I've had these in
[1:02:27] the front of my Bible says 1969 and this
[1:02:34] is the things that I was trying to
[1:02:36] preach dark and read it from the Prophet
[1:02:39] so let's go to 15 the trial cusan 1964
[1:02:46] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:02:49] and forever and he's identifying himself
[1:02:51] as he promised much more could be could
[1:02:55] we say in these last days as son of man
[1:02:59] making himself known among his people
[1:03:04] amen the Prophet started it but as I was
[1:03:07] bringing that there never wrote around
[1:03:09] him as a part of the body of Christ and
[1:03:13] I didn't make the statements were
[1:03:15] brought around and said they that the
[1:03:18] God here is not complete without you why
[1:03:21] don't we realize that yeah but that
[1:03:24] makes us too much too much of what if
[1:03:28] God says it why can't we believe it much
[1:03:34] more could we say in these last days of
[1:03:35] son of man making himself known among
[1:03:37] his people in the form of his people no
[1:03:44] that's all for brother branham hey he's
[1:03:47] the one saying it what are you making
[1:03:51] him
[1:03:52] you make him all of it he deity
[1:04:03] but people is that what you ear this you
[1:04:05] know okay remember I didn't start this
[1:04:09] today so don't you think I started
[1:04:11] picking on you cause you here tonight I
[1:04:16] taught this for over 40 years ago of the
[1:04:21] same notes as son of man making himself
[1:04:24] known among his people in the form of
[1:04:27] his people would that not be in the in
[1:04:28] more fee of his people
[1:04:30] all right see not son of God not son of
[1:04:34] David
[1:04:38] but Son of Man the Son of God was the
[1:04:42] supernatural see if we stay on the Son
[1:04:45] of God we're not going anywhere it's got
[1:04:49] to go farther than son of God you got to
[1:04:53] have something to put between Son of God
[1:04:55] and son of David and that's where it's
[1:04:58] at go ahead number 16 serves we would
[1:05:06] see Jesus and there was one the other
[1:05:16] was one to call elected church that was
[1:05:18] showing the sign that God was in flesh
[1:05:20] Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is
[1:05:24] in you tonight it's still God
[1:05:27] manifesting himself in the last days the
[1:05:30] Son of man revealed himself in his
[1:05:33] church in his church he didn't say to
[1:05:36] his church
[1:05:37] we know that's automatic he had to be
[1:05:40] revealed to his church iris where the
[1:05:42] Prophet come into being
[1:05:44] look manifesting himself in the last
[1:05:49] days the Son of Man revealing himself in
[1:05:51] his church the human flesh making
[1:05:54] himself known you get it see God down
[1:05:58] here in his church making himself again
[1:06:01] the word the son of man being revealed
[1:06:04] in the last days as it was in the days
[1:06:06] of Sodom 17 crises identified
[1:06:13] jesus said noticed
[1:06:15] in today's when the son of man shall be
[1:06:18] revealed being revealed in the last days
[1:06:21] it'll be like it was in the days of
[1:06:23] Sodom garden manifested in his church
[1:06:27] the human beings revealing himself see
[1:06:32] in human flesh like he was then no look
[1:06:38] now this for throwing out on the
[1:06:40] Internet in case of the a lot of people
[1:06:43] think I won't say this but I said it's
[1:06:46] far the Internet people I sure hope it's
[1:06:48] not here but a lot of people think
[1:06:50] brother Branham deliberately blinded
[1:06:52] people by saying things well I'll agree
[1:06:57] he blinded he blinded me to my old
[1:07:03] denominational thinking and I hope he
[1:07:09] covers my blinded eyes do you think he
[1:07:14] did you think he said things to blind
[1:07:17] people don't do that
[1:07:24] go ahead 18 which is the trial down at
[1:07:28] the bottom you read in between all of
[1:07:30] this you know you know where I stand
[1:07:32] read between see if it don't fit I
[1:07:35] challenge you to believe that Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ is revealed in the form of son of
[1:07:42] man in human flesh through the bride's
[1:07:46] body worthy to be revealed
[1:07:53] in the bride's body are the body of the
[1:07:56] bride is that Alright come on keep on
[1:08:03] going
[1:08:08] mighty God unveiled before us Luke the
[1:08:14] seventeenth chapter I believe in about
[1:08:16] the 20th or 21st verse them were a
[1:08:18] longer he said and when the Son of Man
[1:08:21] is being revealed the Son of Man back in
[1:08:23] in in the church again revealed in human
[1:08:28] beings plural now not son of God but the
[1:08:33] Son of man again back in his church
[1:08:35] again in the last days we find that he
[1:08:37] promised that in God's promises go ahead
[1:08:43] proven his word he promised these things
[1:08:48] to happen in the last days that the same
[1:08:51] son of man will be made manifest and
[1:08:54] remember that was not Jesus talking to
[1:08:57] Abraham Dyer that could discern the
[1:09:02] thoughts in Sarah's mind you know who it
[1:09:04] was it was no charity right that was not
[1:09:07] Jesus he had not yet been born but it
[1:09:10] was a man in human flesh that Abraham
[1:09:13] called Elohim the great almighty showing
[1:09:16] and Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:09:18] shot him watch close in the days of
[1:09:21] Sodom so will it be in the coming of the
[1:09:23] Son of Man when the Son of Man is being
[1:09:25] revealed not no more as a church watch
[1:09:28] see not no more the bride is called in
[1:09:33] that day the Son of Man will be revealed
[1:09:36] what to join the church to the head
[1:09:39] unite the marriage of the bride the
[1:09:42] bride groom will come rod groom call
[1:09:46] will come right through this when the
[1:09:48] Son of Man will come down and come in
[1:09:51] human flesh to you not to two together
[1:09:53] the church has to be the word he is the
[1:09:57] word and the to unites together and to
[1:10:00] do that it takes the manifestation of
[1:10:03] the revealing of the son of man not a
[1:10:05] clergyman I don't know I do you see what
[1:10:08] I mean it's son of man Jesus Christ will
[1:10:11] come down in human flesh among us and
[1:10:14] will make his word so real that'll unite
[1:10:17] the church
[1:10:18] him as one the bride and then she will
[1:10:21] go home to the wedding suffer it
[1:10:22] manifests the son of man again not
[1:10:25] Church theologian theology dude I said
[1:10:27] theologian yeah what theologians the son
[1:10:34] of man the word and the church becomes
[1:10:36] one
[1:10:37] whenever the son of man whatever the son
[1:10:41] of man done
[1:10:42] he was the word the church does the same
[1:10:46] thing what about it what about it do we
[1:10:54] believe it he said yeah but brother Dale
[1:11:01] we can't get it straight
[1:11:03] what are you talking about okay let's
[1:11:06] emphasize again I go back the old
[1:11:09] testament gave birth to Jesus Christ he
[1:11:13] was the word lease on his man he gave
[1:11:17] his life to come back into the church to
[1:11:20] give us the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:11:22] save our souls and would make way for
[1:11:24] the Father's throne to come into being
[1:11:26] the son of God and then he would come
[1:11:29] over in the last days and reveal himself
[1:11:34] again as son of man which he would start
[1:11:40] out in Revelations 1:13 1 lakh under the
[1:11:45] son of man heard about the pouch for the
[1:11:47] golden girdle he said it was the bride
[1:11:52] draw it out what is it now the bride is
[1:11:57] to give birth to the word the word is
[1:12:02] Jesus Christ and we were to give birth
[1:12:03] to that word what did he say you become
[1:12:09] the word as you receive the word alright
[1:12:12] perfect thing okay now listen Church for
[1:12:17] just a second now in no way ever said
[1:12:22] anything that I believe in derogative
[1:12:25] points against brother Branham and
[1:12:27] anything I've always stood
[1:12:31] upon my basis all the way through I've
[1:12:40] always stood on one thing to know
[1:12:41] without God sending a prophet we would
[1:12:45] have no hopes now can I help it that
[1:12:53] before I ever heard this message I was
[1:12:58] 18 years old and I told my wife I was
[1:13:02] reading a Bible I said according to what
[1:13:04] I'm reading there's going to be two
[1:13:08] prophets come before the end of the
[1:13:10] world so they had Malachi three miles
[1:13:13] off for so when brother Moe started
[1:13:16] talking to me about prophets since I
[1:13:18] mustn't wait just a minute now would you
[1:13:19] mind explaining times go see I knew how
[1:13:22] the Baptist explained Malachi 3 they
[1:13:26] explained that correctly which they
[1:13:28] couldn't explain Malachi 4 they just
[1:13:30] made it's the same thing flopped it over
[1:13:32] all right brother mode he started
[1:13:35] talking about son of man I said we're
[1:13:37] not why test a minute would you tell me
[1:13:41] who this Melek I 3 is he told me I've
[1:13:44] done that to try to get a make sure he
[1:13:46] understood where we were standing and
[1:13:48] what I could get her what he was saying
[1:13:50] he explained it it's John the Baptist
[1:13:53] that's ok now who's this Malachi 4
[1:14:00] because I was looking for two prophets I
[1:14:05] didn't have to wait to come into message
[1:14:07] to get the Hat I received it from
[1:14:10] reading the Word of God why can't we
[1:14:13] read the Word of God sometimes of our
[1:14:15] own sense and come out with something
[1:14:16] out of it let's see when he explained my
[1:14:23] Licata for I said okay no problem
[1:14:26] he said eyes dire seeing the dead raised
[1:14:28] the sick healed us brother you've heard
[1:14:30] me tell this to original I said brother
[1:14:33] I wasn't there
[1:14:36] I believe you he said well you know
[1:14:39] Robert tell them is right I said we know
[1:14:41] that items they're wonderful people
[1:14:43] moving back and before ever heard of the
[1:14:46] message means that he said there's
[1:14:50] they're insane I said yeah but you don't
[1:14:52] understand I'm trying to tell you I
[1:14:53] can't take what you say but this is what
[1:14:57] I've told him I said you tell me what he
[1:15:00] talked and I'll know whether he was a
[1:15:03] prophet or not
[1:15:05] thank God I run into a man that could
[1:15:08] quote three-quarters of the Bible half
[1:15:10] the message and didn't just jump up in
[1:15:13] my face
[1:15:14] you gotta believe brother branham was a
[1:15:15] prophet are you gonna be lost he went
[1:15:19] through the scriptures the one God the
[1:15:23] water baptisms you know what I said
[1:15:25] about the Godhead he asked me said what
[1:15:29] do you believe I said I believe in one
[1:15:32] true and living God Jesus is his name he
[1:15:36] said how do you explain it I said God
[1:15:37] three persons Blessed Trinity I said
[1:15:41] because that's the only way we could
[1:15:42] explain it he said if your person your
[1:15:45] personality personalities and individual
[1:15:47] individuals a person so your Trinity
[1:15:49] like everybody else I looked at him I
[1:15:51] said don't believe that in the more I
[1:15:52] didn't have to wait to the lights turned
[1:15:54] on the how about something hollered at
[1:15:56] me or visions or dreams or whatever I
[1:15:58] knew the word said it but can we put
[1:16:05] what we've got on the word I've had to
[1:16:12] put my whole life on this word this
[1:16:14] message because I believe it I've seen
[1:16:21] it live too so that helps all right that
[1:16:25] helps to see it live but the word is
[1:16:31] right if you understand what I just
[1:16:34] doing I just put a the Bible now I'm
[1:16:38] going back into the message we talk what
[1:16:40] was it we taught in that the writing of
[1:16:43] the Bible do you remember that that was
[1:16:46] message like one two or three the
[1:16:48] writing of the bow
[1:16:52] you realize that we went through the
[1:16:54] Bible tonight to go through the Old
[1:17:00] Testament come out of it with Jesus
[1:17:02] Christ to start the New Testament come
[1:17:06] all the way through and come out with it
[1:17:08] being Jesus Christ standing in his
[1:17:09] people and there's no way that we would
[1:17:14] been there without the introducing by
[1:17:16] the prophet of Malachi 4 there's no way
[1:17:22] we could be anything without that and
[1:17:24] giving all glory and honor to that
[1:17:28] thanking God for what we've heard but
[1:17:36] what about it is the son of man just
[1:17:41] brother Branham no I've tried to make it
[1:17:49] as plain as I could the entire body of
[1:17:52] Jesus Christ which would mean Paul Peter
[1:17:55] giant you know I mean all of these
[1:17:57] coming up all come together in the last
[1:18:00] days because it's going to be a
[1:18:01] resurrection and they're part of this
[1:18:03] just as much as we're part of this and
[1:18:05] remember what I told that ever age
[1:18:08] inherits what the other ages had so this
[1:18:11] age when it comes up to say to sit with
[1:18:14] me and my throne that's 11th hour people
[1:18:19] that come forth to receive the same pay
[1:18:23] as the first people God to get it to her
[1:18:27] that we can have the Word of God
[1:18:30] revealed unto us and that word revealed
[1:18:35] is the son of man it's the son of man
[1:18:41] leaving and there's that Old Testament
[1:18:46] produced Christ the New Testament must
[1:18:49] produce Christ our elsewhere is he
[1:18:53] coming far to take us are worthy coming
[1:18:56] from to take us that's as simple as I
[1:19:01] can make it worthy coming who
[1:19:02] coming watch they do it alright but then
[1:19:14] do you follow me what a wonderful thing
[1:19:17] to think about that there in Revelations
[1:19:23] one he said before I tell you or show
[1:19:25] you anything I want you to know who I am
[1:19:27] I'm the Alpha Omega the beginning the
[1:19:30] end they all I'm all of it
[1:19:31] and then he says now I'll show you where
[1:19:33] I'm going I'm going into the church on
[1:19:37] the day of Pentecost and she's going to
[1:19:41] be my body and I'm gonna stand in the
[1:19:49] church ages as not to be a physical
[1:19:55] standing but to be the word revealed and
[1:20:03] each age had the word reveal for that
[1:20:05] age and without any of those you're not
[1:20:08] gonna make it
[1:20:09] you think we don't need this we don't
[1:20:11] need that uh-uh we're standing on that
[1:20:13] just remember whatever you think our
[1:20:16] roots is Jewish right
[1:20:20] our roots were Jewish it hadn't been for
[1:20:25] him coming in do it no words in the
[1:20:30] houseful you know that's what I loved
[1:20:31] were that God knows all of our thoughts
[1:20:34] than what we're going to say even if we
[1:20:37] make him smart sarcastically he knows
[1:20:39] those thoughts
[1:20:40] I thought Abraham was agenda I didn't
[1:20:46] know he was a Jew I thought he was a
[1:20:52] Gentile
[1:20:56] you didn't appear to over in Jude and
[1:20:59] like second Kings or something
[1:21:01] it didn't even appear though Abraham who
[1:21:07] are you the man looks at him one day and
[1:21:10] he's walking down through there and he
[1:21:11] said who are you he said I'm Abraham he
[1:21:14] said you're a Hebrew now you start the
[1:21:16] Hebrew tiger because you know what it
[1:21:20] meant look up Abraham in the Hebrew and
[1:21:24] see what it means it means one from the
[1:21:28] other side of the river that man seen
[1:21:31] him cross up Euphrates or whatever it
[1:21:33] was and he said you're a Hebrew but I
[1:21:37] love the Bible he said I brought your
[1:21:40] father Abraham from the other side of
[1:21:43] the flood reach you Bible we want all
[1:21:50] these seed doctrines and it's that and
[1:21:52] the other and don't even know how to
[1:21:53] read the Word of God he didn't see if he
[1:21:59] didn't say that so I brought your father
[1:22:01] Abraham from the side to fluid
[1:22:08] understand that
[1:22:09] well the region Bible see if it said it
[1:22:11] maybe be like a man down at work was one
[1:22:14] day me Oh God
[1:22:15] not a wouldn't it that it was brother
[1:22:16] George brother George oh the guy he told
[1:22:20] him something and he said I don't know
[1:22:21] what I said in the Bible or not he said
[1:22:22] we're gonna read you Bible and find out
[1:22:23] and some time later he'd run across the
[1:22:26] same guy and he said did you ever find
[1:22:28] out in the Bible he said no but I found
[1:22:29] a lot of other good stuff so we could at
[1:22:32] least find some good stuff in the Word
[1:22:35] of God
[1:22:38] you see Church it's not because of this
[1:22:43] that the other it's gonna bring the
[1:22:45] devil after me and you it's because of
[1:22:48] the opening of the work it's the opening
[1:22:54] of the word is gonna brain Satan after
[1:22:55] us with the opening of the word comes a
[1:23:02] restoration of power come on
[1:23:06] come on Satan you can't do nothing with
[1:23:10] us it's too late
[1:23:13] what hurts my heart is to hear these
[1:23:16] 4050 years in the message and preaching
[1:23:19] and then now they're up preaching
[1:23:21] something else that might not tear your
[1:23:27] heart out but it does mine
[1:23:28] I hope it's what the Bible says the
[1:23:32] Obama knows a sign cry for the
[1:23:34] abominations done in the city so I don't
[1:23:37] throw off on these people I don't make
[1:23:39] no fun on them was post pray for him
[1:23:45] we're supposed to pray for him pray for
[1:23:50] those that just by flee use you what
[1:23:55] about it come on musician I've done a
[1:23:57] little quicker than I thought but let me
[1:23:59] make this final point while they're
[1:24:02] coming I believe the son of man which is
[1:24:08] the Lord Jesus Christ in ever form
[1:24:12] except his corporal 16 element corporal
[1:24:17] body is here right now not now not
[1:24:25] coming he's here well I don't see him
[1:24:32] open your eyes now listen let me make
[1:24:37] this statement I'll end it with it
[1:24:39] caught them on the end of series on this
[1:24:40] point if the Dead is raised the sick is
[1:24:46] healed now I hope you understand the
[1:24:50] Bible says if a prophet come and give
[1:24:53] you a sign and it comes to Pais you're
[1:24:56] supposed to believe him
[1:24:57] that's one Scripture but now there's
[1:25:00] another scripture that right see if a
[1:25:02] prophet comes and gives you a sign and
[1:25:04] it comes to Pais but he takes you to
[1:25:06] another God don't listen to that prophet
[1:25:10] another God is another revelation or
[1:25:13] another one
[1:25:18] what do you think what do you think
[1:25:24] about it I think and believe that the
[1:25:28] bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:29] I'll make this table cut if I don't know
[1:25:32] I don't think I'll pick them up but if
[1:25:33] you'll go to the mighty guard unveiled
[1:25:36] if you'll go to the scene on air with a
[1:25:40] shocked masterpiece you'll hear brother
[1:25:44] Branham telling how great the bride is
[1:25:48] you know he says that the fullness of
[1:25:50] the Godhead bodily is in the bride today
[1:26:03] you're making the bride too much no
[1:26:08] because you see I'll never be on that
[1:26:14] throne no matter how close I can get
[1:26:17] I'll never be on that throne you will
[1:26:21] never be on that throne because that
[1:26:23] throne is reserved for him and him only
[1:26:29] because we exalt him I told it
[1:26:33] chiropractor today I said he starts off
[1:26:36] in Revelation saying I want to tell you
[1:26:38] who I am I said he's the Lord Jesus
[1:26:41] Christ that come to John to give him the
[1:26:45] word he said that's wonderful
[1:26:52] see we hear it and we think no it was
[1:26:55] brother Branham had done this it was
[1:26:56] rough it was I've made myself clear but
[1:27:02] around him is not the son of man he is
[1:27:06] not the Lamb of God to take away the sin
[1:27:08] of the world from now the Lamb sitting
[1:27:10] on the throne is the lamb he's not
[1:27:15] brother Branham and he's not me and you
[1:27:20] try to take a book for each other
[1:27:22] come on the Lord Jesus Christ took the
[1:27:25] book open the seals

[1:28:06] bring forth the faith of the father
