========================================

BL you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and we're certainly glad to be here with Brother David and come expecting y'all pull on the word this morning like you want it and this morning we've been studying on Hebrews chapter 13 um the last chapter in the book of Hebrews and just reading um uh studying out uh let Brotherly Love continue um I've got this picture of Paul what he might have looked like may maybe who knows let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word and to be able to look into these things Lord and we just ask Lord that you'll help our understanding this morning Lord and be with us this morning Lord Jesus be with Brother David as he's preparing Lord Jesus to labor for us this morning and I pray God that you'll set the right atmosphere in our hearts and in this building this morning Lord Jesus for us to receive and Grant it now in your name amen now the first three uh script uh verses in Hebrews chapter 13 are kind of dealing with our relationship to one another as he says in verse one let Brotherly Love continue and as we were studying out the last time we spoke on this it's it's very strange that the only one in the New Testament to use this phrase Brotherly Love is Paul that Paul would would uh tack these two words together of course a lot of other Peter and many others spoke of of of of the concept of um you know Peter talked about brotherly kindness and how we need to love one another but Paul is the only one to put these two words together like this and he said let Brotherly Love continue and be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares in other words we we need to treat even the ones that we don't know very well somebody might show up your your door want some food or a beggar on the street treat everybody treat everybody with this brotherly love because you never know when you might be entertaining an angel and just don't realize it remember them that are in bonds is bound with them so we got to have empathy for one another if somebody's going through something to enter in with them uh that's what you know when somebody comes up for prayer if you can really enter in with them then you'll see something accomplished if you can enter in with love and and enter into the predicament that they're in remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body to be able to identify yourself with their predicament you know sometimes it helps to to remember the things that we have gone through when you see somebody else suffering um like all the examples that have been used in the past somebody going through kidney stones and if you've gone through kidney stones yourself or back trouble and you gone through back trouble yourself you can enter in with that person and identify and really enter in with with prayer for that person or just any any kind of predicament now now you think about what brotherly love is and we'll get into you know when love is expressed love is expressed it becomes kindness and that's what kindness is kindness is Love In Action so we got to when you when you some that that love that you hold in your heart when you begins to express to somebody else there you've got brotherly kindness so Paul is saying let Brotherly Love continue and you think about what Brotherly Love is is really um you know all through your Christian Journey you're expressing love to have it to mature to a place where it's constant and consistent and no matter what the devil can throw at you it's it's it's constant to think about that concept now at the top of this pyramid we've got love but when you're born again in your soul you've got love but what what's happening is it mature it's got to mature and mature and mature until it comes like a bright shining Sun that somebody can uh throw something at slap you on the face or whatever but love answers back and all these things when like it's like a little baby when a little baby's born it's got all the you know the attributes and things that it's going to have when it matures but it's got to it's got to grow and grow and mature a little babies come comes forth and it's you know crying for its mom for milk and but you know how's it going to have knowledge you think well well the baby's got know the baby the baby might mature just just enough to to um say well I I like applesauce and that's maybe all the all the knowledge it has but to have knowledge knowledge where you can look at the stars and recognize that there's stars and look at the Earth and recognize that there's you're standing on a planet and recognize your purpose and that you got a purpose to work and you're going to have a a mate and all those knowledge you can't have that kind of knowledge when you're just a little baby so you grow into it and you can't have knowledge until you got virtue how's a little baby going to be able to open up the Bible and read if it can't stand up on its own two feet you got to have some strength you got to be able to have some strength stand up on your own two feet so you can't have that kind of knowledge until you got virtue you got to have virtue strength first and then you got to have so you got to have you add all these things one to another like Peter said first add to your faith virtue and now once you've really got it sealed in once it's sealed in and constant then then you can add to your virtue the next and add the next and add to the next so you can't have brotherly how are you going to have brotherly love if you don't have knowledge knowledge like when somebody says something mean to you you can recognize that that person is still a Christian because you have knowledge of the difference between Soul spirit and body that the devil might be working in their Spirit to make them make them jealous or make them upset make them have a bad day or something but that doesn't mean they're not a Christian so that's where you can really because you got knowledge that you begin to understand things so now and you've got patience you got to have patience to have brotherly kindness how are you going to be able to deal with somebody and and look at look at the sit see patience we come you might be you might have patience in your natural birth but patience this kind of patience is Godly patience you know I I maybe I'll use my example and I'm saying I'm using myself an example to say I cannot boast of this when I was when I was a young child I I had well you say natural patience I was my mom one time she went to a job interview and she set me over in the corner and I was a little kid and I I was just you know I was that kind of kid I could just sit there and listen and and my mom was in a job interview and I was a kid over in the corner letting her do her job interview and just sitting there and listening now that's natural patience I was I just I was born with just a little good little kid but that ain't got nothing to do with Godly patience Godly patience comes by the new birth you must be born again to have this kind of patience now you might be a kind of a good little kid but that don't mean that you've got this kind of patience this kind of patience means you're standing at the platform and you're saying well I got I got a need God's got to come on the scene he's got 60 seconds left or disaster is going to strike but you well he's going to show up I I know he's going to show up because he promised and yet you don't let it get all out of cater because you know that he promised like the bride that brother Brown talked about waiting for the the the groom to show up she's waiting for the stage coach will she we waiting for Christ to come he promised we know he promised and patience is waiting on him to come now see that's different that's different that kind of Godly patience to wait on God to come and answer his promises different from that natural patience that you might be born with that you're just you're just a good little kid you're you're just you you know and and knowledge where somebody you might have natural knowledge what like some of these lawyers that I work with that they got they got uh two or three degrees and then the law degree on top of that and they they got a degree in chemical engineering and they know how everything works and how everything fits together and how your body works and they they know enough to to talk to somebody that has a chemical engineering degree and then on top of that they got a law degree and that's knowledge but that won't do you any good that won't do you any good in this Christian Journey you got to have Godly knowledge so see where how Paul is saying let Brotherly Love continue you'll have you might you'll have some brotherly love when you're born again you'll have some some love to be able to dis love and you want to love but to have it really mature and manifest so it's so when somebody says something against you that you don't R back ever that it's constant and consistent you cannot have that until those other things are also in you that's why we're adding one to the other I I think one of the most Sublime things that brother R said is say it like I say it just say it like I say it if you say it like brother brandham said it and we preach it like brother brandom said it and we use the pattern that he said everything will come out right add add to our faith virtue add just keep adding these things and when you see these things mature in you and keep building up one after the other that's why it's so important to have the right understanding what you believe matters because these things build one on top of the other one on top of the other until if you've got if you got your foundation wrong if you've got your foundation wrong you will not be able to come to the K headstone if you got something off kilter and the you end up at the end the building looks I'm way off my notes I'm I'm just if you got something off kilter you will not it will the the it's like building a wall and if you don't have the foundation straight you you'll lay one block on to top of the other and the wall will start leaning over and then you then you got a how you going to add that top block on if the walls all off kilter but each of these thing each of these precepts are like little stones that you're adding into your life and you can't you can't add that headstone until you've got the other things all lined up and all built up right so say it like brother randam said it you first you got to have faith you got to have God's faith you got to have his he the Holy Ghost in you and then you add to that now once you once you're born again then you can add then now that you got that strength the holy ghost manifesting in your life now you can add that add to that knowledge and you keep adding adding adding until it's manifesting concrete something that's consistent somebody that you can look at your own self and see that it's there others can look at you and see that it's there and it's manifest that it's on display constant where your where your children can look at you and say he don't R back he's he's patient he's he's not screaming at his wife all the side he's patient and temperate temperate that he's in control control he's in control of his spirit and what's happening as as the word is is built up within you it's casting out the devil that's the second seal he's casting out the devil is being cast out of your spirit so that so that your spirit is is God is in control of your spirit and now see God is is building us up by the word precept upon precept line upon line here a little there a little until you come to the place where brother L love is not just some some little some little maybe something that happens every once in a while but it's something that's constant and consistent now we go back to to the to the dream that sister Shepherd had that brother Bown talked about in Blasphemous names and and we're talking about listen listen as as we study this thing this this this dream out that you think that your rock confession will fall apart but there's got to be something to contain and what that thing is that makes it sticky to hold everything together is the honey of Brotherly Love brotherly kindness that makes everything hold together that make that keeps things from running out now listen to way brother R explain I know this is a little bit small so just listen to this and I know uh I used artificial intelligence to get this um to draw this picture and it's not you know I I I played around with this for a couple hours and I you I couldn't get it quite right but it's pretty close it's pretty close to kind of give was an idea you think about this picture that brother man painted for us as he saw the dream that sister Shepherd had sister Shepherd there at the mount on the top of the mountain a man was standing there pouring water into a rock box and her husband was over there to the side now that was Sister Shepherd put our put ourselves in that place the bride of Christ watching as the messenger of the day pours the water the message into that rock box of our confession and our husband is standing over to the side watching our husband husband and and the water it is it well let's listen he said she dreamed she was up on a mountain she dreamed that she saw a rock box like a framework sitting right in top of this mountain and her husband was just behind her and she saw a large man standing there with work clothes on with sleeves rolled up bailing the most pure water that she ever seen and pouring into this box this Rock Box sitting in top of the mountain and The Rock Box would not hold the water not the rock box is your confession it wouldn't hold something think about this now somebody rubs you the wrong way some and you start I'm not going to hang around them nor I don't I you know you but something's got to hold something's got to hold where even if somebody treats you wrong even if somebody don't you but brotherly kindness just holds everything together the honey of Brotherly kindness no matter what people say to you how people how people treat you something's holding it all together The Rock Box would not hold the water and it rolled right out of there and just bowled up all the trash and sticks and everything in there and bowled it out and rolled down the mountain and it rolled over her feet and she was standing right in that stuff only it didn't stick to her and then she asked why the Box didn't hold it and the man said that is not water that's the Holy Ghost and said nothing will hold it and said then he went back see he said that nothing will hold it but then he went back and got another bucket that that that might be a good sermon to preach God's got another bucket then he went back and got another big bucket and this bucket was full of honey and he poured the honey in there so he's pouring water buckets of water and then he goes and gets a bucket of honey and he poured the honey in there and he said now it will hold now it will hold this and she thought she thought that the box was a rock box was going to burst out and spill the honey now see those those are the situations in life where it looks like it ain't going to hold but it held when the honey was in there but she said she thought that the box was a rock box was going to burst out and spill the honey but it didn't it finally stuck together and held it she turned and went down the mountain going down the mountain she stopped at the bottom of the mountain and looked back she saw five streams of this pure Crystal Water not contaminated by the things that it had went through still pure and clear coming swiftly and brother R talks about how that's Grace going down five streams of Grace then it slowed up then almost fading out and she was wondering would it ever reached the bottom of the mountain five strings and she woke up now I just pulled out some highlights of this this so that we can meditate on the things that brother manam said as he explained this dream The Rock Box would not hold the water the man said that is not water that's the Holy Ghost and said nothing will hold it and Rockbox is Rock confession now like Jesus said in the scripture he said Peter said who Jesus said who does men say I the son of man am that's your confession and each Church age has had that rock confession on up to this rock confession of the Le oosa in this church age the message is being poured into the church yes so that water being poured into that rock box of your confession is the message what was the water doing it was boiling out all the trash that was in it that's what the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit does boils it up now now the honey represented brotherly kindness Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and remember kindness is the expr expression of love when love is in action that's kindness so you got love it's got to be on display you got to share it which is this age I just got through telling see of Brotherly kindness the age that we live in now brother Brown said as he went on to explain this he said I'm an old man I see I've got honey being poured in water I'm an old man I was once young and now I'm old I've seen it down through the age do that hear people say I just won't have no more to do with it now see that's our reaction sometimes when people people treat us wrong or they say something that that's what I'm talking about you got to have knowledge before you can have brotherly love to recognize sometimes maybe you're somebody in your family maybe somebody in the church maybe the devil can interact with them in their spirit and make them have a spirit of jealousy make them make just having a bad day stuff of Life somebody will say something to you and it might not that person might not even know what what they're doing what they're saying and you hear somebody say you and treat something do something wrong to you and you say man I I don't want nothing more to do with them and you'll think that that Rockbox confession ain't going to hold oh but with honey in it it's going to hold honey Brotherly Love is going to hold right and something happened to that man so let something happen to that man though and it'll still hold it nearly cures you something on the inside it's that love reaching out that that you still love that brother even though they might have treated you wrong though might they might have done something wrong or said something hurtful to you he thinks oh God I let my precious brother go without making friends with him you see see see it's brotherly love it looks like it won't stick but it does stick the honey it sticks and blasphemous names he said now I should saying this a few days ago thinking that the church will be spiritual enough to catch it and maybe better turn this tape off right now because I don't want to get it out amongst Brethren but you could speak with tongues you could shout you could dance you could cast out Devils do anything you want to and still not have the Holy Ghost didn't them disciples come back rejoicing and shouting because the Devils was subject to them right among them was Judas did not Jesus say in that day when he come that many will come to me and say Lord have not I cast out devils and in your name done Mighty works and I'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity I didn't know you those things are not indication of the Holy Spirit by their fruit you shall know them now what's he talking about you're born again but you want to see it on display yes and that's what the fruits are is the stature of a perfect man that as you grow then you're putting on display that kindness patience Temperance knowledge all those things now it's on display now there's like we brother Wade was talking about in Bible Study last night there's the experience of being born again where you're not looking at like a sensation that happened on a particular day but you're looking at what God has done the experience in your life that now you can see the faith that you believe now is on display and you look back and you've got a journey where you you see that God has brought you somewhere and even though you may not feel it right now you may not feel something but yet God has changed your life to be in Oneness with him and now you believe like he did and you walk like he did and you're acting just like he did that's that's the evidence of the new birth it's not just maybe something that just happened on one particular day but an experience that you have walk through and live through and seeing God take you from point A to point B byy their fruit you shall know them buy their fruit and you'll know them because their Doctrine is on display the word that you have heard is visible and on display where somebody can look at your life and see what you have believed on display because you react differently and you talk differently and the love of God is on display visibly in your life and you say now you say brother Brown do we should we speak with tongues absolutely that's gifts of God but those gifts of God without these virtues in them makes a stumbling block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by God it's a stumbling block why is it a stumbling block it's a stumbling block when somebody says I'm a Christian but yet they they haven't they don't have they're not displaying it yet somebody somebody Strikes Back you and is mean when maybe you have a Bible question and somebody's somebody's mean to you and you wonder you know why are they not patient with me why why why this why that and it'll stumble you and trip you over that's why it's so important for us to seek God and labor and and and and and strive to see these virtues in them because I don't want to be a stumbling block to nobody and we'll see as we study these things out how Paul talks about real kindness as being concerned about how you're presenting the gospel to other people being concerned about where somebody's at he would say well you know somebody some a young Christian might or a young believer might might not want to eat in his day eat something that was offered to Idols because they would think well I don't want to enter into idolatry so he's he's saying well let's be careful when we're presenting somebody to something to some young believer that might be offended in the way that you're presenting it think about those things because ask kindness kindness to think about somebody that maybe they're they're not as mature as you think you are kindness and the sture of a perfect man he said then sixth let's add the Bible said here adding Brotherly Love brotherly kindness now that's a good see how he equated brotherly love with brotherly kindness because kindness is Love In Action so it's the same thing with kindness is on display now that's a good one right here the 67th all right adding brotherly kindness all right when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on on the matter now see there's why you can't have brotherly kindness until you have knowledge patience and Temperance cuz you got to have those things to be able to put yourself in his place and put yourself in his shoes and look through his eyes and think about the way that his experiences my brother sinned against me said Peter shall I forgive him he said seven times a day 70 * 7 brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see you got to have patience before you have brotherly kindness patience is working out through all those things until it's com coming out in brotherly kindness you got to have patience first be kind to him and kindness is love and action in 1 Corinthians 13 He Paul said charity suffer long and is kind in Ephesians 4:32 be you kind one another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you and Colossians 3:12 put on there is the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering now we we'll end on this in just a few moments but let's really dive into what kindness is because if you got to have brotherly kindness you got to know what kindness is and kindness is is Is Love on display it's it's that love that you got now it's in action and you're displaying it but what's so difficult to articulate about kindness is that there's two sides of kindness that's why it's it's and you'll see when I explain this you you take a beggar on the street and you say I want to be kind to this person there's two sides of kindness on the one hand kindness is an attribute of Mercy you don't want to you don't want to Heap heat more coals on his head and tell him look at this situation you're worthless you're just a you're just a pile of trash you're nothing nobody cares about you nobody this and that see this is what sometimes I I'm saying this for a reason sometimes we'll think we we'll lean so much to kindness is a desire for honesty and truth that we're a little bit too harsh with our truthfulness but kind you got to mix those two things together kindness is an attribute of Mercy sometimes sometimes kindness we we need to be patient and wait and let's not let's not be so quick to to tear somebody up because we we kindness is going to be merciful but kindness also is a desire for honesty and truth if you're not truthful with this beggar and tell him look you're in this situation because you got a problem with alcohol or drugs and I I I listen if you'll listen to me I I've got a remedy for your for your fix and I can help you out of your maybe you know you see some of these people on YouTube that make their videos of being kind and they'll go out and they they'll put a beggar and and uh take him to a hotel and put them up and those kind of things and and you know that's you see you got to have a mix of of mercy and a desire for honesty and truth and that's why it's so difficult to really articulate what love is and what kindness is because there's got to be a balance a balance between those two sides of the coin to be merciful you know um well let's just keep reading John Chapter 13 and we'll we'll stop on this Paul said or or John said or Jesus said who who is this talking Jesus a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples amen if ye have love one to another and love on display we'll stop right there is when somebody treats you wrong you can Rec return it return evil with good give good back to evil and we're as we study these things out we're talking about oh the the point I'm going to get to always speak something positive always be positive because the right response respon the right display of love and kindness is what's what's going to get that beggar out of his situation is is not telling him how worthly worthless he is or telling him how nobody cares but telling him something that'll get him out of his fix and that's that's the essence of love and kindness we'll stop right there God bless you [Applause] amen
