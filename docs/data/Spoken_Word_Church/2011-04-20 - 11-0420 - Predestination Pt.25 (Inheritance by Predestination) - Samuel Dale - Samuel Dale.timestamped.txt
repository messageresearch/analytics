[16:23] to been dropping eggs but they landed I
[16:25] heard a report the other day that they

[16:55] for the word to be able to bring us to a
[16:57] place that that we can even think about
[16:59] as salvation for these bodies that we
[17:02] live in to where that we don't have to
[17:04] be like everybody else and try to find
[17:06] some way to get a new body or some kind
[17:08] of a doings but can see that this body
[17:10] is the one to be redeemed we love you

[17:52] before and been real low but the Lord's
[17:53] always brought him out and everything
[17:55] but he's back now in the nursing home
[17:58] and and everything and everything's
[18:00] going great but we appreciate that okay
[18:02] Ephesians
[18:04] 1 it's where we' read for a while we
[18:07] drop backward and forth in this because
[18:10] this is to me is the basis of all of it
[18:13] verse three blessed be the God and
[18:14] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha
[18:17] blessed us with spiritual blessings in
[18:19] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[18:22] he had chosen Us in him before the
[18:24] foundation of the world that we should
[18:26] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[18:28] love having predestinated us unto the
[18:31] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[18:33] himself according to the good pleasure
[18:36] of his will that's right to the praise
[18:38] of the glory of his grace wherein he ha
[18:40] made us accepted in the Beloved in whom
[18:43] we have Redemption through his blood the
[18:46] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[18:47] riches of his grace wherein he ha
[18:50] bounded to wherein he hath abounded
[18:52] toward us in all wisdom and Prudence
[18:55] having made known unto us the mystery of
[18:57] his will what to adopt us all right
[19:00] according to his good pleasure which he
[19:02] had purposed in himself that in the
[19:04] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[19:07] might gather together in one all things
[19:10] in Christ it started in Christ wind up
[19:13] in Christ right both which are in heaven
[19:15] and which are on earth even in him in
[19:17] whom also we have obtained an
[19:19] inheritance now there's where we're
[19:20] going to be getting to tonight so we
[19:22] have obtained an inheritance that's
[19:24] right being predestinated according to
[19:26] the purpose of him who worketh all
[19:28] things after the counsel of his own will
[19:31] that we should be to the praise of his
[19:33] glory who first trusted in Christ in
[19:36] whom you also trusted after that you
[19:39] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[19:41] your salvation in whom also after you
[19:44] believe you were sealed with that Holy
[19:46] Spirit of Promise which is the earnest
[19:50] of our
[19:51] inheritance for what until the
[19:54] Redemption of the purchased possession
[19:57] unto the pra way of his glory so there's
[20:00] something to come is it we've got the
[20:03] salvation of the soul but there's
[20:04] something to come okay 1 Peter
[20:08] 1 we'll begin verse
[20:11] three blessed be the God and father of
[20:14] our Lord Jesus Christ which according to
[20:16] His abundant Mercy hath begotten us
[20:19] again unto a lively hope H by the
[20:22] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[20:24] dead to an inheritance watch now
[20:30] Incorruptible and undefiled and that
[20:33] fadeth not away reserved in heaven for
[20:36] you amen who are kept by the power of
[20:38] God through faith under salvation ready
[20:41] to be revealed in the last time you may
[20:45] be seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[20:48] the reading of the word
[20:52] now we've been talking
[20:55] about predestination and coming on down
[20:59] through the line and trying to we still
[21:01] haven't gotten down to adoption yet but
[21:04] we're we're gaining ground but just
[21:06] remember uh you know and pray for us the
[21:10] Lord would bless us and but
[21:13] now this past weekend we were talking
[21:17] about the birth of the word or the new
[21:21] birth of the
[21:22] Soul all right and in that we saw and
[21:26] we've been trying to bring bring out the
[21:28] point to us over and over to get us to
[21:33] understand that it's not the body and
[21:36] it's not the spirit that receives the
[21:39] new birth right that's why that we still
[21:42] are waiting the Redemption of the body
[21:44] see all right we'll get to that in a
[21:47] minute but yet it's not complete yet you
[21:50] know
[21:51] finished and but we have the new birth
[21:54] and the new birth starts in the soul the
[21:57] soul is the feel you not your heart not
[22:00] your your thumping gizzard you know as
[22:03] we call it and people wonder I guess
[22:04] what that means but see not not the
[22:07] thing that pumps the blood people say in
[22:09] my heart all right that's fine but the
[22:13] heart of an individual is really your
[22:15] soul because that's what you are that's
[22:18] where your life is at uh the life of a
[22:21] peach is in the seed that's in the peach
[22:24] SE in the peach gathered around by the
[22:27] PO and all the other things to make it
[22:30] where it's edible but the the center
[22:32] part of it is the main point and that's
[22:35] that's what we've been trying to deal
[22:37] with is the soul because to make
[22:40] Christians as I brought out Sunday to
[22:42] try to make Christians in body will not
[22:45] help any of us to get you to go to
[22:48] church to get you to be good to do like
[22:51] that that's all well and
[22:53] good but it still will not change us and
[22:57] make us New Creations in Christ Jesus it
[23:00] takes a new birth the birth of the Soul
[23:02] which is a birth of the word that we
[23:05] have heard see that's the the point that
[23:08] no one in the Bible ever receive the
[23:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost without first
[23:12] hearing the Worden so then Faith cometh
[23:15] by hearing and hearing by the word all
[23:17] right that but that new birth now begins
[23:20] in the soul because that's where Satan
[23:23] attacked him from the head that he took
[23:27] the head God takes a heart attacking
[23:30] from the head Satan comes down through
[23:33] and perverts the nature of our soul cuz
[23:36] he cannot create amen and not being able
[23:39] to create he can't give you a soul he
[23:43] can pervert the nature of your soul
[23:46] because of the domain that we're born
[23:48] into Etc and all like that but see
[23:52] that's where he begins to mess
[23:53] everything up but that's the place that
[23:56] God begins through the heart as the
[23:59] prophet said the soul all he begins from
[24:02] there to make a work of redemption to
[24:06] come into being all right so then the
[24:09] greatest battle is fought in the mind
[24:12] because God also has to use the human
[24:16] mind brain hearing seeing Etc he has to
[24:22] use that to be able to contact us and
[24:26] and to to to speak to us you know so it
[24:29] all comes through the same channel and
[24:31] don't ask me I don't understand it I
[24:32] don't understand how the devil can just
[24:35] bombard me 24 hours a day and you know
[24:38] and just every time I'm it's just he
[24:41] just there working like everything but
[24:43] all at once God can just come along and
[24:45] drop something down in you you ever had
[24:47] that to happen you ever had it to be
[24:48] that you've had a bad day as we call it
[24:51] not a bad High day but a bad day you
[24:53] know but in a bad day where everything's
[24:55] going wrong right and it just seemed
[24:58] like Satan is just just hammering you to
[25:01] death and it just you know it just and
[25:04] you really you can't even seem to get
[25:07] your your mind on the Lord I remember
[25:10] what the prophet said he went out to
[25:11] pray one day and he said I tried to pray
[25:14] over here and he said the sticks were
[25:15] sticking me he said I moved over to
[25:17] another place and he said Here Come the
[25:19] mosquitoes and they was after me he said
[25:21] you know I was trying to pray said after
[25:23] a while I just said get your belly full
[25:26] something like that said just eat I'm
[25:28] going to pray and said you know he begin
[25:30] to pray well see he had his days so do
[25:34] all of us have our days but to think
[25:36] right in the middle then of a day all at
[25:37] once God will drop down and reveal
[25:40] something to you sister Gil what on one
[25:43] God while she was vacuuming or something
[25:46] at the
[25:47] house not necessarily your mind dwelling
[25:52] on not meaning it's not but not
[25:54] necessarily dwelling on something but
[25:57] God could just drop right down and just
[25:59] speak and it's wonderful you know it's a
[26:01] great thing and then you spend the rest
[26:03] of the day doing like I told you one
[26:05] time I was really down and out and I got
[26:08] in the car and drove down the road you
[26:09] know and I was just crying and just just
[26:12] just having it out cuz I was having such
[26:14] a a battle within me about some things
[26:17] and I got about halfway down to Mayville
[26:19] which is about 6 miles or something and
[26:22] the Lord said who's in this battle you
[26:24] or
[26:25] me I mean you think what you're going
[26:27] through is worse than what I've been
[26:28] through well you know what I turned
[26:30] around drove all the way back home
[26:32] crying and praying but you know is a
[26:34] different crying a different praying I
[26:36] was really rejoicing and and rejoicing
[26:38] and crying because he' speak to me right
[26:41] in the middle of all of the junk that
[26:42] was going on that he'd come down and
[26:44] talk to me well that we don't understand
[26:47] it but we thank God for it but God
[26:49] begins in the soul what to drive
[26:53] out that that Satan has placed within us
[26:57] of his nature his
[26:59] ways his thoughts right the domain that
[27:02] we're we're born in so he starts to
[27:04] drive out all right we found from the
[27:07] future home that that brother around
[27:09] says the that you know you repent of
[27:11] your sins in other words you you you get
[27:13] a new heart because you you you've got a
[27:16] Stony heart not that your heart is Stony
[27:20] this those are
[27:21] examples he melow it's just a hardened
[27:25] because of the sinful condition of all
[27:27] of the things it hardens the uh
[27:30] individual and just makes us hard you
[27:33] know in in life but he he gives you a
[27:36] new heart amen see not taking out your
[27:39] heart putting in another heart not that
[27:42] way he just Mellows you down in other
[27:44] words he brings you under
[27:46] conviction all right and see then in
[27:49] doing that you realize well that's
[27:51] something wrong I'm lost and then you
[27:53] repent you remember that right and you
[27:55] say Lord forgive me and just a sweet
[27:58] peace comes over you all right wonderful
[28:01] place to be in but you know what about
[28:03] an hour later things will start getting
[28:05] bad again you know I mean that that you
[28:08] wish it wouldn't but you may Li for a
[28:10] while but it's going to come back why
[28:13] because the thing that made you do it is
[28:16] still there right you just repented of
[28:19] what you done from there back right and
[28:21] you can't repent of what you've do what
[28:24] you're going to do no that's right amen
[28:27] it it it it can't be done you just just
[28:29] don't try that's Catholicism right don't
[28:31] try to repent of what you're going to do
[28:33] right I have enough trouble with What
[28:35] I've Done Right a worried about what I'm
[28:37] going to do all right but see the thing
[28:41] that made you do it the prophet said was
[28:42] still there amen but see then
[28:45] sanctification deals with driving out
[28:47] that unclean spirit and I told you what
[28:50] I likeed of what that Pro what the
[28:51] prophet said he said that unclean Spirit
[28:53] goes out of it's own accord right well
[28:55] see I always thought that we drove it
[28:58] out you know brother R said it goes out
[29:01] of its own
[29:03] accord you said well that don't sound
[29:05] right I agree with you because see we
[29:08] think that we drove him out right no
[29:11] it's through the hearing of the word
[29:13] amen that's right we hear the word we
[29:17] listen to the word we read the word we
[29:19] pray and we study see then the unclean
[29:21] Spirit he he don't have no place to stay
[29:23] amen thank you Lord that's the way we
[29:26] ought to think about got it see the
[29:28] Lord's bringing up some little things to
[29:30] me that and and there one in tonight's
[29:32] message but little things that that's
[29:34] always been bothersome to me see like
[29:38] that quote you know the prophet saying
[29:39] he goes out of his own accord well I I
[29:43] sure don't sound right right but then
[29:46] after you think about it a little bit
[29:47] it's the only thing that could be right
[29:49] right you just put in the word yeah you
[29:52] just keep hearing the word all right see
[29:55] Satan he can't he just can't stand it
[29:57] right so he leaves out but be careful
[30:00] now right come on because the Bible said
[30:02] he goeth out that's why he says he goes
[30:04] out on his own all right see we want to
[30:07] cast The Devils off we want to cast this
[30:09] out we want to cast that out that's fine
[30:11] the Bible says those
[30:13] things but why don't we just get deep
[30:16] enough into the word until Satan don't
[30:18] know what to do with
[30:19] us I'd rather do it that
[30:22] way see because that puts it right in
[30:24] the scripture all right but see then be
[30:27] careful because that unclean Spirit
[30:29] goeth out of a man seek a thre findeth
[30:31] none come back and find a house swept
[30:32] and garnished that's right the Bible
[30:34] said clean right and he enters therein
[30:38] and the state of the man is seven times
[30:40] worse when he becomes religious amen
[30:43] that's right goes to church y wants to
[30:45] be good wants to help everybody right
[30:48] wants to give you know wants to do you
[30:52] know that's right cuz that's just a
[30:54] religious uh you know religious part of
[30:57] us us that that we want to try to do
[30:59] something or help somebody right but see
[31:03] the thing about what I've tried to get
[31:04] us to see is if we can hold on in that
[31:07] word is as disciples that said they held
[31:09] the word they didn't understand right
[31:13] they didn't understand what was going on
[31:15] oh but they just knew one thing for sure
[31:18] was that Peter said we we don't know
[31:20] what's going on we don't know how to
[31:21] handle all this but there's one thing
[31:23] for sure you're the only guy that's got
[31:26] the word to eternal that's right so we
[31:28] just stay with you right until we see
[31:31] what's going to take place well others
[31:33] didn't want to stay didn't they so there
[31:35] was no way for the Holy Ghost to fall on
[31:37] them because they had took man's ideas
[31:40] and went away see there's that uncan
[31:43] Spirit coming in that's right that
[31:46] unclean Spirit coming in will bring in
[31:49] man's ideas right now not just men only
[31:53] that women okay right you know the the
[31:55] first preacher there was was a woman
[31:57] preacher that's right it don't make it
[32:00] right but she was the first one see so
[32:03] get what I'm
[32:04] saying but that unclean Spirit still
[32:07] come back and you become super religious
[32:11] Amen to me there's your anointed ones
[32:14] right amen cuz the anointing of the Holy
[32:16] Ghost is on their Spirit they're
[32:17] rejoicing you can't tell them they're
[32:19] lost that's right that's
[32:22] right you think I don't want to call his
[32:25] name but the man that got caught you
[32:27] know not too long ago and he was making
[32:28] $137 million a year so you'll probably
[32:31] remember who that was you know he got
[32:33] caught by the fact he was going down to
[32:35] see a woman you know oh he claimed he
[32:38] wouldn't have no sex with her he just
[32:39] had her to dance around him you know
[32:41] yeah but see all them years he preached
[32:44] hard against right but one day he got to
[32:47] hold of it right so be careful but that
[32:52] unclean Spirit can be only driven out by
[32:54] the word that you hear that's right
[32:58] you can lay hands on brother Brown said
[32:59] you you can pour oil on by the gallons
[33:03] he said if Satan's got a right to lay
[33:04] there said he'll lay right
[33:07] to all right but see the point I'm
[33:10] trying to get us to see is it's the
[33:12] birth of the word amen so we get the
[33:14] word everybody said brother they L
[33:16] nothing but word word word all he talks
[33:18] about word word word will you tell me
[33:19] something else to talk about amen I
[33:22] thought I believe I thought you believed
[33:23] in John 1:1 in the beginning was the
[33:25] word word was with God and the Word was
[33:26] God amen that's right you know I thought
[33:28] we believe the word amen but you see the
[33:32] planting of the word will drive out
[33:35] that's right those things out of your
[33:36] life read the Bible you'll find out it's
[33:39] got the answer to all your
[33:41] questions right I don't care what kind
[33:44] of question you got you just read the
[33:47] Bible or read The Prophet's message
[33:49] you'll find something that'll answer all
[33:51] of the questions all
[33:53] right but see once we get the new birth
[33:59] now we read here in
[34:01] Ephesians about 3:14 there that we get
[34:05] the
[34:06] earnest 13 says we get the baptism of
[34:08] the Holy
[34:09] Ghost 14 says what one you know
[34:13] Ephesians 1:14 the earnest of our
[34:15] inheritance
[34:17] right until the Redemption of the
[34:21] purchased product right all right now
[34:25] Calvary everything that's what we're
[34:28] going to deal with tonight now at
[34:30] Calvary
[34:32] everything was finished
[34:34] amen at Calvary that's right all right
[34:38] now but all wasn't
[34:40] applied amen that's right see it would
[34:43] be applied then as the beginning of the
[34:46] the the uh Redemption would be applied
[34:49] on the day of Pentecost with the baptism
[34:51] of the Holy Ghost right amen and the 120
[34:55] in the upper room would be word that
[34:57] you're looking behind me here that it
[34:58] says faith of the fathers on the
[35:01] pyramid that would be where they were
[35:03] birthed at because they had held the
[35:04] word and receive that amen but then
[35:07] downstairs cuz God had to start his
[35:09] church amen that's like we've always
[35:11] said people say oh which come first that
[35:13] the chicken or the egg oh smart man well
[35:16] how do you know I know what the Bible
[35:19] said he created right it didn't say he
[35:21] created chickens it didn't say he
[35:23] created germs and laid them on a rock
[35:26] right and let produce a
[35:29] cow right right he created all the
[35:33] beginning of God's creation begins and
[35:36] full grown the Lord Jesus Christ was the
[35:38] beginning of the creation of God he was
[35:39] full
[35:40] grown Adam was full
[35:46] grown Adam was full grown he he wasn't a
[35:49] baby right the Lord Jesus sure had to
[35:52] come as a baby and grow up but yet still
[35:55] he was the beginning of the creation of
[35:57] God they're in the fullness right growth
[36:01] development brought him to the position
[36:03] but now think about it we get the
[36:05] earnest of our
[36:07] inheritance right now the earnest is a a
[36:10] down
[36:11] payment I gave you some quotes on it you
[36:14] go over about three four five and look
[36:15] at them and read them on your
[36:19] notes and as you're looking at them
[36:21] you'll see the prophet says the earnest
[36:23] he said that's just a down
[36:25] payment
[36:27] H you go down you're going to buy a car
[36:31] and they say you got to have $500
[36:34] down of course now you can buy them
[36:37] without anything down cuz they figure
[36:39] they're going to repossess them two
[36:41] weeks later anyway but that don't have
[36:43] still have nothing to do with it you but
[36:47] you pay $500 down what is that the
[36:49] earnest
[36:51] money that'll hold that until you can
[36:55] pay the rest all right but that allows
[36:58] you to be able to take the
[37:00] car or the home you buy whatever to go
[37:03] live in it because you've made a partial
[37:09] payment all right see promising to
[37:13] finish the rest of the payments now
[37:15] we're not talking about defaulted loans
[37:17] people that can't pay we're talking
[37:19] about serious matters in Christianity
[37:22] why because when God gave you the
[37:24] earnest of your inheritance he didn't
[37:27] give you a a part like a part that we
[37:29] called a
[37:31] part he didn't give you $500 down and
[37:34] the rest of it to be paid later
[37:37] right like I told you there the other
[37:39] day and that really struck me it may not
[37:41] mean a thing to you and maybe you seen
[37:43] it all your life but when I seen that it
[37:47] really struck me greater is he that is
[37:49] in you than he that is in the
[37:52] world do we believe that's Bible within
[37:55] the day you got the baptism of the Holy
[37:57] Ghost that baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[37:59] your soul is not just a match for the
[38:02] devil it is a conqueror of the devil
[38:05] amen that's right but see we think no
[38:08] man's a match for the devil all right
[38:10] then we limit ourselves won't even try
[38:13] well I'm not a match for the devil you
[38:15] think you're a match for him no no but
[38:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your
[38:19] soul is not just a match for him come on
[38:22] brother he's his God he's his maker he's
[38:25] his all in all that's right you just
[38:27] don't believe it that's it that's where
[38:29] we ought to start believing who we
[38:31] are the prophet said we live below our
[38:34] privileges
[38:37] amen do you say well brother Dale how
[38:39] long you've been preaching 40 something
[38:40] years and the Lord finally showed me
[38:42] that bless him I preach sermons off
[38:46] greater is he that is in you than he
[38:47] that's in the world Hallelujah but I
[38:49] mean really see it amen amen that's
[38:51] right to say that new
[38:54] birth what is it like a Prophet said if
[38:57] it's an Earnest what is it he said it's
[38:59] like a spoonful y right a spoonful of
[39:02] water out of the ocean is identically
[39:05] the same chemical as the whole ocean
[39:07] full right it ain't a
[39:10] part a part of God is
[39:13] God Amen we look at it and say part well
[39:16] you got a part I got a part we get our
[39:18] parts together you know that's what we
[39:20] want to talk about well that's
[39:22] fine that's in the body of
[39:25] Christ
[39:27] but see a part of God is God Amen that's
[39:31] right eternal life is eternal life amen
[39:35] you can't get a part of eternal life you
[39:38] either have eternal life or don't have
[39:40] eternal life it's one of the two There's
[39:42] No Gray areas that I feel like it you
[39:45] know I'm beginning to feel I might have
[39:48] something come on now you beginning to
[39:50] feel like knowing you ain't got nothing
[39:51] that's what you're propping it up amen
[39:54] but get what I'm talking about
[39:57] that Earnest that you
[39:59] receive you know what it means I read
[40:02] run the last one off and I was just
[40:04] sitting there looking at some quotes and
[40:05] I don't think it's in yours but this is
[40:08] taken from uh paragraph 102 Revelation 5
[40:11] part one brw serpent I don't think it's
[40:14] in your so don't start looking look what
[40:16] he saids and notice we as we go
[40:19] on now we know it's a finish we are
[40:22] predestinated with the lamb the holy
[40:25] spirit is our seal the earnest means
[40:27] more Is Yet To Come amen that's right
[40:31] now that's what I like we only have the
[40:34] earnest of it now the earnest is just
[40:36] the down payment oh how beautiful just
[40:40] the down payment that holds it and
[40:41] secures it and anchors it so no one can
[40:44] touch it amen it's the earnest of our
[40:46] adoption amen the holy spirit is now the
[40:49] earnest of God in our hearts seal the
[40:52] adoption of sons waiting at the end of
[40:55] the road Sons and Daughters of God Amen
[40:59] that's right means more to come
[41:01] y right ain't like making payments on
[41:04] the house right you making payments on
[41:06] the house you got to work on the
[41:08] house right this is not like that that's
[41:12] carnal
[41:14] comparison this means if you got the
[41:17] earnest no matter
[41:19] what the day you receive that Earnest
[41:22] that new birth amen that eternal life
[41:25] you die that okay you're automatically
[41:27] sealed it's all it's sealed in by the
[41:29] Holy
[41:30] Ghost and there's nobody can touch it
[41:33] right but it means there's more to come
[41:36] amen there's a statue of a perfect man
[41:39] to climb up while we're here right amen
[41:42] that ain't all of it
[41:45] right if everybody I preached it to you
[41:48] many many times if everybody in the
[41:50] world had the statue of a perfect man
[41:52] where the disciples had they wouldn't be
[41:53] a change of the body that's right he
[41:55] took this message to come by the end
[41:57] time Amen to bring us to a place to
[42:00] understand the
[42:02] change why because Paul and them can
[42:04] only prophesy of it that's right we're
[42:06] not prophesying remember I preached the
[42:08] message years ago all who prophesy must
[42:12] die that's right now come and show me
[42:15] where that's wrong that's right you just
[42:17] keep prophesying that's what we've been
[42:19] doing we keep prophesying we're going to
[42:22] die and go by the grave right but when
[42:25] we quit prophesying start saying this is
[42:27] it right amen I like what brother R said
[42:30] about Paul or Peter and them if this
[42:32] ain't it brother R said let me keep this
[42:34] until that gets here that's
[42:36] right but see Earnest means there's more
[42:39] to come right amen it's not all there's
[42:43] more to come you said well how could it
[42:45] be more there's more word to be revealed
[42:48] on is it that's right well if the word's
[42:50] revealed the Holy Ghost the words the
[42:52] same
[42:54] amen amen what is it we we talked about
[42:56] it the other day the revelation of God's
[42:58] word you can only be saved by Revelation
[43:01] right you can only be saved by faith
[43:03] amen it's not
[43:05] intellectualism right it's an experience
[43:08] amen right amen faith is a substance
[43:11] Paul says in Hebrews 11 right substances
[43:14] brother Mo used to say years ago that it
[43:16] means that the definition of substance
[43:18] means what what anything consist of
[43:23] whether it be natural or
[43:29] spiritual whether it be God or whether
[43:31] it be anything else you make a payment
[43:33] on something that means there's more to
[43:35] come that's right amen I love to do that
[43:37] like the prophet would call it and i'
[43:38] never been there don't know what in the
[43:39] world he's talking about but he said you
[43:41] walk into a pen
[43:42] arcade I don't know what that means you
[43:45] probably know but I'm just a dummy I'm
[43:46] sorry I got a little sense but he said
[43:49] you walk into Penny Arcade and he said
[43:51] you look around yeah well then you just
[43:53] start looking around and then you look
[43:55] around and you look around see there's
[43:57] more right and the more you look the
[43:59] more you see right what I mean that's to
[44:03] me that's way the gospel
[44:05] is the opening of the word today
[44:08] tomorrow is former rain
[44:12] right right what you have today tomorrow
[44:16] will be former rain cuz you got to have
[44:18] a latter rain that's right there's
[44:21] always got to be a revealing right right
[44:24] until the last one comes but
[44:27] listen we get an Earnest of our
[44:34] Salvation that nobody can take it away
[44:37] from us
[44:38] right you can't lose eternal life that's
[44:41] right and an Earnest of eternal life is
[44:44] not a part pay but a part of eternal
[44:46] life it's eternal life amen the baptism
[44:50] of the Holy Ghost is eternal
[44:52] life but it's in a baby form is a way of
[44:56] saying an Earnest
[44:58] baby baby's got everything it has unless
[45:02] something goes wrong now we're not
[45:03] talking about that a baby that's born
[45:05] normal has got five fingers on one hand
[45:08] five on the other you know Etc something
[45:11] wrong that's perversion we're talking
[45:13] about natural things that are right it
[45:15] won't grow another finger right it's got
[45:19] what it's supposed to have right but
[45:21] what does it need growth development
[45:24] right right growing up you know right oh
[45:28] yeah sometimes I I've told you about it
[45:30] I'm just human we used have pictures on
[45:32] the wall of the kids when they was born
[45:34] and then the next and two and four and 6
[45:36] and 8 and 10 and 12 16 and all like that
[45:39] you and you look in there and I looking
[45:42] one day and I thought boy I'd love for
[45:43] Wade stayed right there left the terance
[45:47] be right there and Anna to be right
[45:51] there and then I thought no that
[45:53] wouldn't be right all right cuz God
[45:56] didn't bring them into the world to
[45:57] right stay there in that place that's
[46:00] right he brought them in the world to
[46:02] grow up and be their own s right and
[46:05] have their own
[46:06] family then they could look at the
[46:08] pictures and say they wish your kids to
[46:10] stay right there you right it would make
[46:14] it come to that place but get what I'm
[46:16] talking
[46:18] about what is an Earnest of eternal
[46:21] life it's eternal life amen it doesn't
[46:24] mean you one of these days you're going
[46:26] to get it no amen that's right it means
[46:30] you already have
[46:34] it because God gave it to you it's
[46:38] eternal
[46:39] life right all right
[46:44] now think on these things a little bit
[46:47] now
[46:48] Earnest cuz I was going to put this
[46:50] license and Lord no you got to go first
[46:52] okay we change it first see I've been
[46:55] doing that a lot lately he's been
[46:56] changing me back and forth Sunday
[46:57] afternoon I preached on there out of
[46:59] Ezekiel which I didn't have that plan so
[47:01] I wrote the notes sitting in the office
[47:03] in there while everybody was coming up
[47:04] down the steps you know to preach Sunday
[47:07] afternoon well that's kind of the way
[47:09] this is I had it all what I planed on
[47:11] going but it didn't work out so we just
[47:13] go the other way amen all right so the
[47:15] earnest of our
[47:19] inheritance means that you already have
[47:24] it
[47:27] M it is not as we say the payment of you
[47:32] pay it down on the car and you got to
[47:34] pay the rest of it before you can get
[47:35] the
[47:37] car no you already have it
[47:42] right either you have eternal life or
[47:45] you don't have eternal life right
[47:47] there's no gray areas nowhere in that
[47:50] you either have the baptism of the Holy
[47:51] Ghost or you don't have the baptism of
[47:53] the Holy
[47:54] Ghost there's not a place in there
[47:56] that's the greate cuz you say well I'm
[47:58] believing unto that's okay right but
[48:00] believing unto means you don't have it
[48:03] that's right amen no I'm confessing it
[48:06] that's good can keep confessing it
[48:09] right that means you don't have it if
[48:12] you're believing unto amen all right see
[48:15] once eternal life comes there is no
[48:17] believing
[48:18] unto that's right he becomes the
[48:21] believer amen that's inside of you to
[48:24] take up his possession in your soul
[48:27] oh because that's in your being that's
[48:30] why I believe then
[48:32] see by the new birth then your soul is
[48:35] your theoy that starts an upward
[48:40] pull
[48:42] see and will take us out through the
[48:44] statue of a perfect man and On Through
[48:47] To The Chain of the body
[48:49] right but now to me the reason that it
[48:52] says
[48:54] earnest
[48:56] is because there's more to come right
[48:59] amen all right now I believe there's
[49:02] more to come in the Statue of a perfect
[49:04] man don't you yeah you know Faith virtue
[49:08] knowledge temper PA God is Brother come
[49:10] that's more to come all right but you
[49:13] know what that's more to come up the
[49:14] same
[49:15] thing right
[49:18] am it's the same thing it's just more of
[49:22] the same thing right but now as I said
[49:26] if every one of us was sitting here
[49:28] tonight with the baptism of the Holy
[49:30] Ghost as the faith of the
[49:33] fathers we still don't have the change
[49:35] in the body right amen you know what you
[49:39] have you're Earnest
[49:43] right now that's what we want to get to
[49:46] cuz the title of the message tonight is
[49:50] what inheritance by predestination amen
[49:56] all right now we'll read that in a
[49:58] minute but get my
[50:03] point
[50:05] inheritance by
[50:08] predestination
[50:12] okay the
[50:17] earnest
[50:21] is Christ in you the hope of glory amen
[50:25] that's right all righten that's the
[50:29] earnest but now watch now this is this
[50:32] is the way ahead but I keep this in your
[50:33] mind and you'll see what I'm talking
[50:34] about is it gains ground see when you
[50:37] receive the earnest of the baptism of
[50:39] the Holy
[50:41] Ghost you know what God
[50:45] done the reason it's called an Earnest
[50:47] he gave you the baptism of the Holy
[50:49] Ghost will you agree to that amen all
[50:51] right Earnest the reason it's called an
[50:54] earnest
[50:56] is because there's more of you than the
[50:58] soul right you got a body and the spirit
[51:01] to be dealing
[51:03] with
[51:05] all are you with me right let's read in
[51:08] Ephesians now and see what it says what
[51:10] does it say there in
[51:17] Ephesians
[51:21] 114 13 talks about seal with the Holy
[51:24] Spirit of promise which is the earnest
[51:26] of our
[51:28] inheritance
[51:32] now
[51:34] until that's
[51:36] right until read that's right until
[51:41] means something is not
[51:45] complete I give you this
[51:49] until right right it means more to
[51:53] come see
[51:56] it doesn't say which is the
[52:00] earnest and you have it no
[52:04] until the
[52:06] Redemption of the purchased
[52:13] possession now that would look like that
[52:15] you just had something outside out
[52:18] here and the purchase possession is out
[52:22] dire uhuh right amen the baptism of the
[52:26] Holy
[52:28] Ghost is the
[52:31] earnest and right there the day you
[52:33] receive that new birth just a baby in
[52:36] Christ God lay claim on that body you're
[52:39] living in am that's
[52:42] right amen that's why I don't believe
[52:44] like all the people of the message are
[52:45] going with it now we're going to get a
[52:46] new
[52:47] body course the way they say it you
[52:49] don't know whether they're saying new
[52:51] body or what they just say new body
[52:56] and then you just leave it for you to
[52:57] think about what you want to yeah well I
[53:00] like no no I like to be blunt
[53:04] right I believe in this body being made
[53:07] new am amen I believe I'm going to live
[53:10] in this same body but it ain't going to
[53:11] be this old pest house that I'm living
[53:13] in but it's going to be the
[53:15] same what the prophet say not even the
[53:18] same gases but it's going to be the same
[53:21] person that I am right I don't believe
[53:23] in getting a new body amen that's right
[53:26] see the reason you don't believe in it
[53:27] cuz you don't believe the blood of Jesus
[53:28] Christ is sufficient to pay the price
[53:30] amen you think he can save your soul but
[53:32] he can't he can't save your body now
[53:35] what kind of a thought have you got what
[53:36] kind of a god do you have that's right
[53:38] amen I'm trying to make a point to you
[53:41] the day he gave you the new birth he
[53:44] also laid a claim amen right that's
[53:48] right on that body you're living in
[53:50] absolutely
[53:52] amen that's right now watch what I'm
[53:54] talking about
[53:56] the day the word came in to drive out
[54:00] that unclean
[54:02] Spirit out of your soul before you were
[54:06] born again
[54:07] there see what it done it laid a claim
[54:12] right
[54:14] amen the word being revealed are brought
[54:17] to you laid a
[54:20] claim on that
[54:23] Soul that's why the disciple that laid a
[54:25] claim on
[54:27] 120 but 500 seen him the Bible says
[54:31] after his resurrection and 380 didn't
[54:34] make it to the upper room that's
[54:37] right something
[54:44] happened well it's gone on vacation man
[54:47] garbage
[54:50] again we can go through all of that I
[54:52] bought a wife and married a cow or done
[54:54] something you know right
[54:57] It thatou song all messed up but that
[55:00] stuff don't work right be serious about
[55:03] it
[55:06] amen be serious
[55:09] amen right the day you receive the new
[55:12] birth Brother
[55:14] Gary I don't care what that body look
[55:17] like God laid a claim on it right there
[55:20] that's right yes sir said this is the
[55:23] body you going to live in amen
[55:26] I'm going to make it Eternal it won't be
[55:28] in this that won't be listen I know how
[55:30] to preach about what you're talking
[55:32] about so don't go too far with me when
[55:35] the soul is given the new birth it's not
[55:38] the old soul washed
[55:41] up right I know how to preach what your
[55:43] Prophet said he said it's not that he
[55:46] said it's a brand new
[55:49] unit not a
[55:52] different a brand new he said you don't
[55:55] wash it up polish it
[55:58] up he said that's why people still start
[56:01] out and they doing good and all at once
[56:02] you see them going
[56:04] back see then this body is not going to
[56:06] be just an an old body we're not going
[56:08] to raise up in an old
[56:11] body we're going to raise up in it
[56:13] because that's what we're going to talk
[56:14] about here amen we're going to talk
[56:17] about it in a way that you know I wonder
[56:20] if you thought on
[56:23] it cuz this is the way I like to preach
[56:27] let's just read what your Prophet had to
[56:30] say I thought about this and I thought
[56:33] boy I'm going to get Josiah up tonight
[56:34] to ask some questions where you at
[56:37] Josiah I want to get him to ask a
[56:40] question I a I don't mean to come up
[56:43] here I just saying that he asked me a
[56:45] question one
[56:47] day and it's a serious question for
[56:50] about a 6 or seven year- old little boy
[56:52] at that
[56:53] time and he he said if Jesus
[56:57] was Mary's Creator see cuz we believe
[57:01] that Jesus Christ created all
[57:04] things he said then how was she his
[57:07] mother well you want to ask
[57:10] it that's some of these questions i' be
[57:12] glad to turn them over to you if you
[57:13] want to you
[57:15] know what would you
[57:17] said cuz the little boy had a point
[57:20] right if Jesus created her how could she
[57:24] be his mother
[57:27] so let's get serious let's read
[57:30] something right
[57:31] here this is always bothered me so you
[57:34] just bear with
[57:36] me look at number one on your notes
[57:38] position in Christ paragraph 177 preach
[57:40] 1965 22 the morning
[57:44] service inheritance by
[57:49] predestination I inherited
[57:52] something what inheritance
[57:56] there had to be somebody leave me an
[58:01] inheritance now we
[58:04] automatically
[58:06] think of the process today of
[58:09] inheritance is generally upon the basis
[58:12] that somebody has
[58:14] died
[58:17] right but see that's not necessarily
[58:20] true like I'll tell the kids I say hey
[58:24] they said prob you out there pay in that
[58:26] driveway I said yep spending your
[58:29] inheritance you're not going to get that
[58:32] much you going to have to eat the
[58:33] payment if you do yeah well you know
[58:39] they say yeah but that's our
[58:41] inheritance yep but see then we have at
[58:44] times just walked up to the kids and
[58:46] just give them money for reasons you
[58:50] know because you can give away uh you
[58:52] can give away what is it 10,000
[58:55] $10,000 without having to be a taxable
[58:58] thing which I'm just playing now you can
[59:00] do what you want to I'm not already
[59:01] again with nobody that's why my bank
[59:03] account is low like it is and yours is
[59:06] big but you go right ahead now I'm not
[59:07] arguing but you go along through
[59:10] life and you hoard it all up and then
[59:13] when you get to and you kick the bucket
[59:15] you know you die and the kids is arguing
[59:17] over who's going to get the
[59:20] money
[59:22] right I don't care how good they are
[59:25] they're going to have discussions about
[59:27] who's getting over too much on what
[59:32] side but the easiest thing to do is just
[59:35] make sure they get the same
[59:38] amount used to give money to the kids
[59:41] years ago and all of them we do things
[59:43] Terrence he's always you know been the
[59:45] one that had a
[59:46] little money on his hip a little bit but
[59:49] he'd say but Daddy give it to them don't
[59:52] uh don't give it to me I don't need it I
[59:56] said yeah but you're not
[1:00:00] Daddy I said one of these days you'll be
[1:00:02] Daddy right and you'll find out you
[1:00:05] can't do that
[1:00:07] right you know right cuz if you treat
[1:00:10] one different than the other one after a
[1:00:12] while it's going to show
[1:00:14] up so you treat everybody the same and
[1:00:17] then you don't have no problem that's
[1:00:19] why you've heard me say it many times it
[1:00:21] wouldn't bother me to buy a millionaire
[1:00:23] a meal
[1:00:26] that would bother me right cuz I do what
[1:00:29] I want to
[1:00:30] do I ain't buying no million no meal
[1:00:34] it's all right your money do what you
[1:00:36] I'm not trying to tell you how to run
[1:00:37] your business I'm just telling
[1:00:39] you if you got something better right
[1:00:42] now especially the way the economy is
[1:00:44] you'd be a whole lot better off to divy
[1:00:46] out some of it
[1:00:48] now and you go ahead cuz my point is you
[1:00:52] don't have to die to get an inheritage
[1:00:54] okay okay amen that's right that's the
[1:00:56] point now
[1:00:58] right we always Bas it on somebody had
[1:01:01] to die all right all right now did God
[1:01:06] die now before you answer all of that
[1:01:08] you better listen and we're going to
[1:01:10] read did God die to give you an
[1:01:20] inheritance you better hold
[1:01:23] on all right
[1:01:25] more serious what you
[1:01:28] think but let's read what your Prophet
[1:01:30] had to
[1:01:32] say he didn't say somebody had to
[1:01:36] die he said there had to be somebody
[1:01:38] leave me an
[1:01:42] inheritance okay right now
[1:01:47] yep why you say Jesus left you an
[1:01:53] inheritance
[1:01:57] beg your
[1:01:59] pardon
[1:02:00] right Jesus never left me an
[1:02:05] inheritance Jesus never left you an
[1:02:08] inheritance
[1:02:10] amen that's
[1:02:19] right he only came down and paid for
[1:02:22] your inheritance amen brought you to
[1:02:25] your inheritance that's right amen now
[1:02:29] that don't bother
[1:02:34] you try some way to figure it all out
[1:02:38] what they're doing nowadays would be
[1:02:39] really bad all this River Georg and
[1:02:41] stuff because they automatically thrown
[1:02:42] away from Jesus even be enough form of
[1:02:44] God and just made a man out of him but
[1:02:46] surely they don't even have no
[1:02:47] inheritance no that's right
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:56] but did God die to give us an
[1:03:01] inheritance now God can't
[1:03:05] die you said well I've heard you
[1:03:08] preach
[1:03:10] yeah but you better go back and listen
[1:03:12] to what I said to
[1:03:16] right I've never taught you that Jesus
[1:03:19] the
[1:03:20] body was
[1:03:23] eternal
[1:03:26] do you understand what I say Jesus the
[1:03:28] body that's right
[1:03:33] now and Jesus the God I don't know how
[1:03:37] to say these things so forgive me I'm
[1:03:39] just I'm just as dumb as can be but just
[1:03:42] forgive me and and think about it let
[1:03:44] God speak to
[1:03:45] you Jesus the God never died right the
[1:03:49] reason I say Jesus the God because the
[1:03:51] only name God ever had was
[1:03:53] Jesus
[1:03:57] so now what
[1:03:59] happened
[1:04:03] yeah Jesus never left me an
[1:04:06] inheritance Jesus never left you an
[1:04:09] inheritance well I got quote for bring
[1:04:11] them
[1:04:13] on cuz you won't find them right I save
[1:04:17] you the trouble of going to
[1:04:20] hunt the prophet couldn't tell you that
[1:04:22] Jesus never let you an inheritance then
[1:04:25] tell you Jesus left you an inheritance
[1:04:27] right amen
[1:04:29] right cuz he did he's contrary one to
[1:04:31] the other well years later he got
[1:04:34] straightened out see that's so Glory man
[1:04:36] ain't it
[1:04:38] beautiful that's why we're here 40 years
[1:04:40] later right
[1:04:44] amen what's the prophet talking
[1:04:51] about he only came down and paid for
[1:04:55] your
[1:05:00] inheritance price had to be
[1:05:04] paid brought you to your inheritance all
[1:05:08] right that's
[1:05:11] it but your name was put on the Lamb's
[1:05:13] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:05:15] the
[1:05:17] world God give you your
[1:05:23] inheritance
[1:05:27] your inheritance was
[1:05:34] first
[1:05:39] now what are you talking
[1:05:45] about I'm asking you do you understand
[1:05:47] what brother Brown is say
[1:05:53] it
[1:05:56] see God didn't
[1:05:58] die that's
[1:06:00] right
[1:06:04] amen God can't die
[1:06:13] amen
[1:06:15] now that human flesh that we call
[1:06:21] Jesus he never gave you any inheritance
[1:06:29] right because his flesh was Mortal
[1:06:34] right subject to death yep a man that
[1:06:39] was 33 years old and looked to be 50 yep
[1:06:45] right everybody says I'm 71 it looked to
[1:06:48] be 60 but I differ with them on that cuz
[1:06:51] I look at the old thing every day but
[1:06:54] it's old and wore
[1:06:57] out but he was 33 years old and looked
[1:07:00] to be
[1:07:01] 50
[1:07:03] right because of all the things he had
[1:07:05] to go through with
[1:07:08] right what you
[1:07:10] see we are not the children how many
[1:07:14] times have I made this statement right
[1:07:16] we are not the children of Jesus which
[1:07:19] was a child of
[1:07:21] God right that would make you a Grand
[1:07:25] child right simple right I said I'm deep
[1:07:30] how much more simple can you
[1:07:36] get are we
[1:07:39] grandchildren no we got to be Sons and
[1:07:42] Daughters of
[1:07:43] God but we had to receive a new birth to
[1:07:46] be able to come to that
[1:07:47] position there had to be a way made that
[1:07:50] that could take place amen that's right
[1:07:54] so Jesus never left us an
[1:08:02] inheritance he only came down and paid
[1:08:06] for your inheritance amen that's
[1:08:11] right well if he paid for it you know
[1:08:14] well if he paid for it it didn't belong
[1:08:16] to him
[1:08:20] right see are we this Trinity which one
[1:08:25] is
[1:08:30] it say he brought you to your
[1:08:34] inheritance that's
[1:08:37] right but your name was put on the lamb
[1:08:40] book of life before the foundation of
[1:08:42] the world God give you your
[1:08:46] inheritance he said your inheritance was
[1:08:48] first
[1:08:50] amen now what is our inheritance he
[1:08:53] eternal life right amen
[1:08:57] right what is the inheritance that we
[1:09:00] desire eternal life
[1:09:04] amen well see how could God bring that
[1:09:08] eternal
[1:09:09] life to a place that it could be
[1:09:13] received by
[1:09:17] mankind he said well people just didn't
[1:09:19] know how to
[1:09:21] believe well you want to go back in the
[1:09:23] Old Testament and let's spend about 2
[1:09:25] weeks talking about some of those
[1:09:26] Brothers back there and their faith and
[1:09:29] their doings and their their abilities
[1:09:32] and their actions
[1:09:34] and right I don't believe you want to do
[1:09:37] that do you cuz you know you'd wind up
[1:09:40] in
[1:09:41] trouble cuz some of those fellas make us
[1:09:43] ashamed of ourselves and they didn't
[1:09:45] even have the new
[1:09:49] birth
[1:09:52] right
[1:09:54] see Jesus never gave you an inheritance
[1:09:57] that's
[1:10:00] right he paid the
[1:10:05] price that the ability for God to
[1:10:09] transmit his life into you and I
[1:10:14] Amen to give us eternal life right the
[1:10:17] price had to be
[1:10:20] paid they had to be a redeemer they had
[1:10:22] to be a Kinsman
[1:10:26] right one that would even give his own
[1:10:29] life
[1:10:31] right I'm not saying he's a separate
[1:10:33] person so get off your garbage
[1:10:36] can I Don't Preach to you too
[1:10:40] long you ought to know now what I'm
[1:10:42] talking about right
[1:10:45] amen God was in Christ the Bible said
[1:10:48] reconciling the world unto
[1:10:51] himself right in body he was a man now
[1:10:55] how many quotes have we done on that how
[1:10:57] many sermons have we preached on that
[1:10:59] that in the spirit he was God and said
[1:11:02] in Soul he was
[1:11:04] God all right so when that baby was
[1:11:08] born God's own life not a second
[1:11:14] person God's own life by spirit and soul
[1:11:18] came into that
[1:11:20] body it was a baby the prophet said
[1:11:24] little Jehovah crying in the Cradle he
[1:11:26] said think about your God with no
[1:11:29] teeth
[1:11:31] yep
[1:11:33] amen God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:11:37] world to
[1:11:38] himself amen outside of that you're
[1:11:41] going into the Oneness or Trinity one of
[1:11:43] the
[1:11:44] two well you just sound like a Oneness
[1:11:47] will come on with the scriptures and
[1:11:48] quotes let's see if we
[1:11:52] like
[1:11:55] that was either almighty God laying in
[1:11:57] that cradle amen or the biggest deceiver
[1:11:59] the world ever had that's right amen
[1:12:02] that's what your Prophet said that's
[1:12:04] right amen you want to amen him you owe
[1:12:07] me me but amen him at
[1:12:10] least right cuz there's one thing about
[1:12:13] it you can't argue with him you can
[1:12:16] argue with me and figure out well I
[1:12:17] don't believe that well it's go right
[1:12:19] ahead but am I saying what the prophet
[1:12:21] said that's why I like to give it to you
[1:12:23] unless you read
[1:12:25] it
[1:12:27] all
[1:12:33] see Jesus
[1:12:35] Christ died Jesus the flesh the man
[1:12:39] that's right the human
[1:12:42] part died to release the life of
[1:12:47] God brother Rand said God tore his soul
[1:12:50] out right that was the way he said what
[1:12:53] did
[1:12:55] mean cuz what have I always taught you
[1:12:58] the soul of God was God standing there
[1:13:00] in that body that come out of that
[1:13:05] body that spirit and that Soul there on
[1:13:08] Calvary came out of that
[1:13:12] body that body didn't go to hell that
[1:13:15] body didn't go to heaven that's right
[1:13:17] your Prophet said it was hung between he
[1:13:20] said hell wouldn't have it and Heaven
[1:13:21] couldn't take it right you want them
[1:13:24] quotes he talking about the
[1:13:30] body it was the soul of God that went to
[1:13:33] hell that's right to preach to those
[1:13:36] souls in
[1:13:37] prison but when that Soul came back up
[1:13:40] that Spirit was released and steep back
[1:13:42] in that body there already stood am
[1:13:44] amen amen see that body couldn't give
[1:13:48] you eternal life
[1:13:51] right but eternal life was housed within
[1:13:54] that body right
[1:13:56] amen that's it the only thing Could
[1:13:59] Happen was he could pay the
[1:14:05] price the animal life was no way to come
[1:14:10] back right it didn't have a soul right
[1:14:13] amen it couldn't release it wouldn't
[1:14:15] matter how many times you killed that
[1:14:16] animal it wouldn't bring no eternal
[1:14:19] life but here God Ste down in human
[1:14:22] flesh
[1:14:24] and one day on Calvary that laugh came
[1:14:27] out of that body right and that body
[1:14:31] hung there for the three days that the
[1:14:32] soul went to
[1:14:34] hell
[1:14:36] right they took it down put it in a
[1:14:39] tunb then he raised amen amen thank you
[1:14:43] Lord see all right eternal life step out
[1:14:48] of the
[1:14:51] body but it pi that body back
[1:14:56] up and that body according to the
[1:14:58] scripture went up to the father right we
[1:15:00] got to open up the Everlasting Gates all
[1:15:02] in the Psalms you know the Lord Of Glory
[1:15:04] coming in who is this the Lord Of Glory
[1:15:06] king of glory you
[1:15:09] know and when he did it would but just a
[1:15:12] little bit right
[1:15:14] back right he went up and he just come
[1:15:17] right back right but when he come back
[1:15:20] he come back with Body Spirit soul there
[1:15:26] Eternal in a glorified condition
[1:15:31] right now God is God of
[1:15:34] all he stepped back into that body but
[1:15:37] he made that body Eternal cuz that body
[1:15:40] had a beginning and that body had to
[1:15:42] have a time that it had to be made
[1:15:44] Eternal amen so that body can't give you
[1:15:46] eternal
[1:15:48] life but by hanging on Calvary now do
[1:15:50] you see why he would say into thy hands
[1:15:54] Lord take this away from me the body
[1:15:57] outside the spirit reason reals and all
[1:15:59] of the facts of humanity there in the
[1:16:02] garden he was crying out Lord if there
[1:16:04] any
[1:16:07] way then he said not my will thy will be
[1:16:11] done in other words the this is the only
[1:16:13] way it can be
[1:16:15] done that eternal life can come back
[1:16:17] upon these people that I've tutored and
[1:16:19] trained for three and A2 years if this
[1:16:21] is the only way that can ever come to
[1:16:23] humanity that eternal life can come this
[1:16:26] if if this is the only way they can get
[1:16:29] their
[1:16:32] inheritance let me pay the
[1:16:38] price God pulled out of that human
[1:16:42] body Soul and Spirit left that body
[1:16:47] hanging and your Prophet said it was
[1:16:50] dead yep sure abely the Bible said it
[1:16:53] was dead amen why because the Soul and
[1:16:57] Spirit left out of it right but then one
[1:16:59] day he stepped back in
[1:17:02] it he hung around a while 30 40 days or
[1:17:06] something with the
[1:17:08] disciples seen a 500 you know ate with
[1:17:12] them talked with
[1:17:14] them then one day he ascended up he said
[1:17:16] now I I've got to go up
[1:17:19] because the price ain't finished yet
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:23] oh are you ready to return acts 18 you
[1:17:26] going to return to the kingdom to Israel
[1:17:28] now right you wouldn't fight before yeah
[1:17:32] we tried to help you Peter cut off a
[1:17:34] guy's ear and you didn't back him up you
[1:17:36] put his ear back on right now you ready
[1:17:41] he said you don't
[1:17:43] understand you don't understand I've got
[1:17:45] to go finish this thing
[1:17:48] up cuz the only way that eternal life
[1:17:51] can be brought the only way hey Peter
[1:17:53] you can get your
[1:17:55] inheritance is for me to go up and come
[1:17:59] back in the form of the baptism of the
[1:18:01] Holy Ghost yes and bring eternal life
[1:18:05] right now you see why the prophet would
[1:18:07] say that you say well that's never
[1:18:09] bothered me Brother D but you don't
[1:18:11] understand
[1:18:12] me if it's not revealed to me I don't
[1:18:14] just take it because the prophet said it
[1:18:16] that's right I've got to wait until God
[1:18:18] reveals it to me I believe it until I
[1:18:21] quote it until I believe it until I
[1:18:23] don't get my own ideas in until but then
[1:18:26] one day God will speak amen
[1:18:30] right that life had to come out of that
[1:18:32] body
[1:18:34] right my inheritance was there in
[1:18:39] him cuz I was chosen in him before the
[1:18:42] foundation world we read here in
[1:18:43] Ephesians been over and over and over
[1:18:45] and over I was chosen in
[1:18:47] him right so my inheritance was in Jesus
[1:18:51] Christ but how could I get get
[1:18:54] it well all he had to do just say get
[1:18:56] the Holy
[1:18:58] Ghost he done that over in the scripture
[1:19:00] you remember he said breathed on them
[1:19:01] said receive you the Holy Ghost and they
[1:19:02] asked brother BR said what's what's the
[1:19:04] difference in what he said and breathed
[1:19:05] on them he said that was a promise right
[1:19:08] right right they didn't get the Holy
[1:19:09] Ghost retired he said that was a promise
[1:19:11] right
[1:19:14] am they had to wait
[1:19:17] until see but see my inheritance was in
[1:19:20] Jesus Christ amen
[1:19:24] the only way I could get
[1:19:27] it was for him to
[1:19:30] die that's right to release that life
[1:19:33] thank you Lord that he could come
[1:19:35] back now I can say I am my father's
[1:19:41] one
[1:19:43] Amen to an
[1:19:48] inheritance
[1:19:49] Incorruptible we read in Peter
[1:19:54] we have an inheritance that's
[1:19:57] Incorruptible amen that's right
[1:20:01] corruption can't touch my
[1:20:03] inheritance now here's where we're going
[1:20:05] with
[1:20:07] it death can't touch this body until God
[1:20:12] is through with it right amen yours
[1:20:15] either that's right am so why be afraid
[1:20:19] am why be
[1:20:21] afraid well you just ain't never been
[1:20:24] where I've
[1:20:26] been I'd like to tell you a few times
[1:20:28] about some
[1:20:31] things sometimes maybe it's best not to
[1:20:33] but I tried to tell you one time about
[1:20:34] it I was standing up on a deer stand
[1:20:36] about 15 18 ft off the
[1:20:40] ground and all at once my left arm began
[1:20:43] to just ACH and my heart was paining
[1:20:46] aching
[1:20:47] just the devil says I got you
[1:20:50] now you're out here by yourself
[1:20:53] s if you're lucky they'll find you where
[1:20:56] you fall off of that and
[1:21:00] die well most people would have screamed
[1:21:02] bloody murder and jumped off of there
[1:21:04] and wouldn't have had to call 911 cuz it
[1:21:06] could heard them hollering
[1:21:08] for I don't mean that a joke I'm just
[1:21:11] telling it like it
[1:21:16] is I just simply sat down I said Lord if
[1:21:20] this is it I'm f 18 ft off the ground
[1:21:25] I'm higher up than I would be if I was
[1:21:26] on the ground and if I'm having a heart
[1:21:29] attack and it's a major one that
[1:21:31] wouldn't matter to me if every doctor in
[1:21:32] the world was standing here if this is
[1:21:34] it I'm true and finished so thank you
[1:21:39] Lord you said well why didn't you go to
[1:21:44] doctor cuz you didn't have no more
[1:21:45] trouble
[1:21:48] right so I don't tell a lot of things
[1:21:50] cuz I go home with a wife you going to
[1:21:52] the doctor well that's normal it's all
[1:21:55] right no problem I
[1:21:57] go I told you about the time you know
[1:21:59] that I was bleeding like my wife she she
[1:22:02] knew that I'd bled but she didn't know
[1:22:03] what and it was all about and she said
[1:22:06] you got to go to the doctor well that's
[1:22:07] about 3 or 4 months later you know had
[1:22:09] my troubles done over with then problem
[1:22:11] I i' be glad to go they couldn't find
[1:22:15] nothing go what it matter to
[1:22:19] me you see do you fear death
[1:22:23] that's where your problems
[1:22:24] at when you fear death you got a problem
[1:22:28] right you going be afraid every
[1:22:31] moment hey we're not dumb I ain't
[1:22:34] walking out on the railroad track and
[1:22:35] holler to the train to keep
[1:22:37] coming you know what I'm
[1:22:40] saying right we don't tempt God that's
[1:22:43] right
[1:22:44] amen well why worry about death death is
[1:22:47] a death is my slave that's
[1:22:50] right is that what your Prophet said he
[1:22:53] said it's the thing to get me out of
[1:22:55] this pest
[1:22:58] house and into his
[1:23:01] presence you see Jesus never gave you an
[1:23:05] inheritance that's right amen but the
[1:23:08] only way you could get the inheritance
[1:23:10] was for him to
[1:23:14] die well brother T he must have not have
[1:23:17] been God cuz God can't die you just said
[1:23:22] it while ago about four times let me say
[1:23:24] it one more time God can't die
[1:23:27] right but what happened on
[1:23:30] Calvary God stepped out of the
[1:23:33] body you explain it he stepped out of
[1:23:37] that body amen and allowed that body to
[1:23:40] hang there cuz they had to be a Kinsman
[1:23:42] in the body cuz this ain't just for the
[1:23:45] for the soul right that's only the
[1:23:48] earnest that's
[1:23:51] it amen a a inheritance
[1:23:55] Incorruptible right why would the
[1:23:58] scripture say
[1:24:00] that Incorruptible means at once it was
[1:24:06] corruptable right right and my
[1:24:10] inheritance is a change of the body amen
[1:24:13] right that will go to
[1:24:15] incorruption amen this Mortal will put
[1:24:18] on immortality right here amen right
[1:24:25] if you got an
[1:24:27] inheritance here in this world friend
[1:24:31] it's a corruptible inheritance number
[1:24:33] two of you know Revelation 5 part 2
[1:24:37] paragraph
[1:24:37] 242 but we receive an inheritance that
[1:24:40] fadeth not away the prodical son went
[1:24:43] away and left his inheritance and he
[1:24:45] took part of it with him when he
[1:24:48] returned back his inheritance his
[1:24:50] inheritance was defiled
[1:24:53] but if you run away from yours it's not
[1:24:56] so in the kingdom of God we receive an
[1:25:00] Incorruptible inheritance don't you want
[1:25:03] to receive it he talks about people
[1:25:06] raising their hand going down that was
[1:25:08] 243 this is 246 we have an Incorruptible
[1:25:12] inheritance that is salvation Redemption
[1:25:15] watch go back to the Garden of Eden
[1:25:20] again now he ain't talk talking about
[1:25:22] just the soul is he that's
[1:25:26] right come on he ain't talking just to
[1:25:28] the
[1:25:29] soul think of it Lord who wouldn't want
[1:25:32] to go back like Adam and Eve and live
[1:25:35] back
[1:25:38] there an Incorruptible
[1:25:45] inheritance if you've received the
[1:25:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a promise
[1:25:50] to you that your body is also claimed
[1:25:53] right it don't matter how bad it gets
[1:25:56] that's right amen it's claimed right and
[1:26:01] one day it will have to
[1:26:04] to be made Immortal
[1:26:08] right so we have an inheritance
[1:26:10] Incorruptible as we read there in
[1:26:12] Ephesians says until the Redemption of
[1:26:15] the
[1:26:16] purchased
[1:26:19] possession brother Rand in future home
[1:26:21] like gave you some of this so you've got
[1:26:24] it in the future home he
[1:26:27] said and when Jesus received that Holy
[1:26:30] Ghost there on the River Jordan said he
[1:26:31] said this is my part of the earth that
[1:26:33] I've redeemed and from this part of the
[1:26:35] earth I'll redeem the rest
[1:26:38] amen he said we have page 49 future home
[1:26:41] we have the Redemption of the Soul he
[1:26:43] said we're waiting the Redemption of the
[1:26:45] body now what does he say waiting in
[1:26:47] other words we're here waiting in this
[1:26:49] pest house waiting for it to be made
[1:26:51] manifest
[1:26:53] f as far as God is concerned it's over
[1:26:56] with and that's where we ought to be
[1:26:57] saying as far as I'm concerned it's over
[1:27:00] with but now you tell me and I'm just as
[1:27:03] honest as you are you tell me where you
[1:27:05] come from I don't mean that you come

[1:31:17] not in God's mind right right what I am
[1:31:21] now in this old body is not in God's
[1:31:24] mind right amen he sees me what I am
[1:31:28] amen I like about that old colored man
[1:31:31] that BL around said he heard said why in
[1:31:33] the world now he said it you read it he
[1:31:35] said why in the world they put that old
[1:31:36] man up
[1:31:37] there you
[1:31:39] remember said come out there that old
[1:31:41] trench coat on little r h and everything
[1:31:43] said why in the world why didn't you put
[1:31:44] any young men up here that's your
[1:31:45] Prophet talking you know what he's just
[1:31:47] a
[1:31:48] man amen he said after a while said he
[1:31:51] took his text out of heaven and come
[1:31:52] down to horizontal rainbow where the
[1:31:55] morning star sang together and the sons
[1:31:56] of God shouted for Joy he jumped up and
[1:31:58] clicked his heel said you ain't got
[1:31:59] enough room up here to me he said God
[1:32:02] give me some of that I want that amen
[1:32:06] you know what he was saying now you be
[1:32:08] honest he said them other guys could do
[1:32:11] a pretty good job but this fell had the
[1:32:14] good this is the fell I want to be like
[1:32:17] he didn't say he want to be like all
[1:32:18] them others he' heard all them days no
[1:32:20] all though he said agreed with him as
[1:32:25] good eternal life Jesus never died to
[1:32:30] give you an inheritance that's
[1:32:32] right he died to pay the price amen cuz
[1:32:36] my inheritance was eternal life right
[1:32:39] before the world ever
[1:32:42] begun all right transmitted down the
[1:32:45] only way God could transmit it down was
[1:32:48] to come down and create a body step into
[1:32:52] that body you say that's just Oneness
[1:32:54] I'm
[1:32:55] sorry I'm sorry for you and your peanut
[1:32:58] brain that you can't com for him
[1:33:01] right because one that stops in Jesus
[1:33:04] and say he's the life form of God no I
[1:33:07] differ with you you're looking at the
[1:33:09] life form of God which is a bride of
[1:33:10] Jesus Christ and God the greatest thing
[1:33:13] that's ever been on Earth God living in
[1:33:15] his people this is the LIF morphe of God
[1:33:19] no oness will ever touch that no
[1:33:22] amen neither were your one this Doctrine
[1:33:28] right God
[1:33:31] said to the prophet when you begin to
[1:33:34] say I and my father are
[1:33:37] one amen and these are things amen he
[1:33:42] said the shock will pull
[1:33:47] away when you begin to say Jesus never
[1:33:50] left me an inheritance that's right now
[1:33:52] they got one side of it it said he
[1:33:54] wouldn't even God at
[1:33:55] all so I don't know he couldn't give us
[1:33:58] no way of giving
[1:34:00] inheritance if he wasn't God at all God
[1:34:03] just come on him and left back off of
[1:34:05] him there's no way to get a new
[1:34:07] birth the birth can only be from the
[1:34:10] soul of almighty God right that's right
[1:34:13] or else you're just anointed one come on
[1:34:16] amen amen that's
[1:34:20] right ain't going to change nobody right
[1:34:23] but it makes me rejoice in my heart amen
[1:34:25] for him to reveal something to me right
[1:34:28] let me see it amen maybe as simple that
[1:34:31] you've seen it 40 years ago to you see
[1:34:35] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:34:36] that's in the world that new birth you
[1:34:39] receive is just a baby in Christ Satan's
[1:34:41] no match for that new birth
[1:34:44] right that's
[1:34:47] right but he's greater match than for
[1:34:50] all of us in In the Flesh yes that's
[1:34:53] right but just yield yourself to that
[1:34:56] man that's inside of
[1:34:58] there remember brother brandom that old
[1:35:01] devil was coming up saying
[1:35:03] Boop he said I'm going to just see
[1:35:05] what'll happen he said boo back at
[1:35:09] him he said he stopped said I just booed
[1:35:13] again and said every time I said boo to
[1:35:16] him said he got smaller
[1:35:20] y see because Satan is no match for that
[1:35:23] new bird
[1:35:24] amen that's right I don't care how small
[1:35:27] or whatever you want to make it he's no
[1:35:29] match for that new birth amen that's
[1:35:32] right just yield yourself to God but Dev
[1:35:36] aren't you afraid to go on the internet
[1:35:38] and and put it forth and say come and
[1:35:40] show me where I'm wrong that's right no
[1:35:43] because if I'm wrong I want to be right
[1:35:46] you know if you can come tell me I'm
[1:35:47] wrong I can accept it and I can make it
[1:35:49] right so I I can't fail
[1:35:52] as far as being afraid huh I'm Not
[1:35:53] Afraid cuz you see I won't back off from
[1:35:56] telling you
[1:35:58] something I don't like that kind of a
[1:36:01] Lon type Spirit somebody comes along you
[1:36:03] know and you say you said so well well I
[1:36:05] I didn't really mean it that way yeah
[1:36:08] you know I I I really meant no I mean
[1:36:13] what I say and I say what I
[1:36:16] mean whether you like it or lump it cuz
[1:36:20] that's the way I've always been and
[1:36:22] there's no need to change it
[1:36:24] now I'm just as straight as I can be and
[1:36:27] as honest as I can be and what I believe
[1:36:29] I'll tell you and you come up later and
[1:36:31] say brother Dell you said this you
[1:36:32] change now I'll say okie
[1:36:35] dokie I'll straighten that out this
[1:36:38] Sunday I'll go tell the truth and I'll
[1:36:40] tell who told it you know who
[1:36:42] straightened me
[1:36:44] out but I've always said one thing you
[1:36:47] make sure you come with the word right
[1:36:51] that's don't come with your
[1:36:53] ideas that's right and we do have the
[1:36:56] tapes and I have had to rely on that to
[1:37:00] say you said it okay we'll get to tape
[1:37:03] and see if I said it slips of the tongue
[1:37:06] mistakes of words yes human beings we
[1:37:08] all make them so do you right exactly
[1:37:13] but I say what I mean and I mean what I
[1:37:15] say there's only one true and living God
[1:37:18] and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:23] amen and if we can't find ourselves in
[1:37:28] him we got a problem amen that's right
[1:37:33] exactly but if we can see ourselves in
[1:37:36] him then we can see all the way back
[1:37:38] before Glory that's right and come all
[1:37:41] the way down exactly right remember the
[1:37:44] message of predestination when I said if
[1:37:47] you can't look back just as far as you
[1:37:50] can look forward you don't know what
[1:37:52] eternity is that's right amen cuz you're
[1:37:54] only looking forward right eternity
[1:37:57] comes from as far as it
[1:38:02] goes there's no way to express
[1:38:06] it come on brother think on these
[1:38:10] things
[1:38:12] inheritance by
[1:38:14] predestination I didn't get to finish up
[1:38:17] but that's all
[1:38:18] right predestination
[1:38:22] God knew who would want to be saved I
[1:38:24] gave you them
[1:38:25] quotes so he'd have it ready for us he
[1:38:29] knew who would accept eternal life he
[1:38:31] had it ready for us
[1:38:35] y he knew also who would have enough
[1:38:38] Faith to be able to withstand in this
[1:38:40] last days and be able to come to the
[1:38:42] change of the body right that's right
[1:38:45] and he would
[1:38:48] predestinate see now from where are we
[1:38:50] going on on from here now I'm going to
[1:38:52] say it all right so you write it in your
[1:38:54] mind where we're going on from here
[1:38:57] there's no backing
[1:38:58] up amen cuz everything from here on is
[1:39:01] eternity
[1:39:02] right when you're talking about
[1:39:05] predestination I'm talking about
[1:39:07] predestination
[1:39:10] revealed if you have the new
[1:39:13] birth and we're predestinated in this
[1:39:16] day to adoption that no other age was
[1:39:18] predestinated to reach this place
[1:39:21] every age was predestinated unto the new
[1:39:24] birth right y but we're
[1:39:29] predestinated for the change of the body
[1:39:32] that's right God said it would be here
[1:39:36] and whether you believe it or I believe
[1:39:37] it that ain't going to change it at all
[1:39:40] that's right go out there in the morning
[1:39:43] and just sit down there and doubt all
[1:39:45] you want to and let's see if the sun
[1:39:47] comes
[1:39:49] up right
[1:39:51] right amen but if you're real serious in
[1:39:55] God and God is using you you can say to
[1:39:58] that son son stand still right right and
[1:40:02] it
[1:40:03] will that's right we were praying for a
[1:40:06] man years
