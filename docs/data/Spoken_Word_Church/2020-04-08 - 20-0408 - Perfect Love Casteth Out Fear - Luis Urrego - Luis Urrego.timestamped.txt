[1:27] I want to see you
[1:33] praise the Lord Jesus gonna be in the
[1:36] house of God good to be here and hope
[1:39] that everyone on line that's streaming
[1:42] in and listening I hope they're all
[1:43] doing good with the blessings of the
[1:46] Lord and though we've been shut in most
[1:48] of the time but hope you've been blessed
[1:51] taking this time this opportunity to
[1:53] seek the Lord and draw closer to him
[1:55] amen because we have no excuse in this
[1:59] hour I have no excuse
[2:02] praise the Lord so appreciate brother
[2:05] brother Wade and preciate brother Dale
[2:07] for just just the all the different
[2:10] things and everybody coordinating things
[2:12] as we've been changing things around in
[2:14] the last few weeks just thank God for
[2:17] for brother Dale you know just still
[2:19] keeping the doors open and matter and
[2:21] but at the same time of course you know
[2:24] trying to stay on abide by the law so
[2:26] that we don't they don't have to say
[2:27] anything about it about us right amen so
[2:31] we thank God for this opportunity so
[2:33] while you're standing let's just go
[2:35] ahead and go to let's read from first
[2:37] John chapter 4 first John chapter 4 and
[2:41] I don't know the brothers will can bring
[2:44] that scripture up I don't have it in the
[2:46] slideshow so that's why I don't know
[2:50] they got my text or not but all right
[2:53] thank you first John chapter 4
[2:57] and let's start at verse 16 and it says
[2:59] and we have known and believed the love
[3:02] that God hath to us God is love and he
[3:07] that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God
[3:10] and God in him here herein is our love
[3:15] made perfect
[3:17] what's this verse urine as our love made
[3:20] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[3:22] day of judgment because as he is so not
[3:27] that we will be or that we were but so
[3:30] are we in this world all right because
[3:33] he the way he is if you have eternal
[3:36] life in your soul that's the way you are
[3:37] just just just like him amen
[3:40] there is no fear in love but perfect
[3:43] love casteth out fear because fear hath
[3:49] torment he that feareth is not made
[3:52] perfect in love that's pretty strong
[3:57] words but that's what the Bible says we
[4:00] love him because he first loved us if a
[4:04] man say I love God and hateth his
[4:06] brother he is a liar for he that loveth
[4:11] not his brother whom he hath seen how
[4:15] can he love God whom he hath not seen
[4:17] and this commandment have we from him
[4:21] that he who loveth God love his brother
[4:24] also praise the lawlessness by our heads
[4:26] this afternoon and this evening and we
[4:29] just want to just speak about this
[4:31] afternoon just little thought maybe a
[4:33] little Sunday School lesson about
[4:36] perfect love casteth out fear perfect
[4:40] love casteth out fear so let's just bow
[4:41] our heads our gracious Lord Jesus as we
[4:44] come before you father we thank you Lord
[4:47] for the opportunity to open back the
[4:48] pages of your word Lord father God
[4:51] you've heard their many requests that
[4:52] were mentioned here Lord we ask that
[4:54] you'd be with those individuals Lord we
[4:56] pray tonight that you would be with
[4:57] brother dick sister Gayle Lord God ask
[5:00] that you would just have your will have
[5:02] your way Lord brother dick Lord and your
[5:04] mother neighbour father to even

[5:16] other ones Lord and ask that you bless
[5:18] them be with them provide for them as
[5:20] you promised that you would Lord be with
[5:23] us here tonight Lord as we open back the
[5:25] pages of your word and endeavor to speak
[5:27] on this little thought that it may
[5:29] encourage one another Lord and give us
[5:31] father's strength Lord for the days to
[5:33] come
[5:34] bless anoint my lips Lord God and just
[5:37] help me Lord Jesus this evening I pray I
[5:41] commit myself into your hands now commit
[5:43] the rest of the service into your hands
[5:45] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[5:48] god bless you you may be seated
[5:50] praise God you know I was reading a
[5:58] little story a little story about uh
[6:02] there was a couple who was getting
[6:04] married and there was a the the bride
[6:09] had had a friend and it was a group and
[6:13] the girl she wanted to she couldn't
[6:15] attend the wedding so she she wanted to
[6:19] send the bride and the groom I mean the
[6:21] groom and the bride a text message and
[6:22] this is the verse the day that she sent
[6:25] them you know she wanted to send him the
[6:27] you know first John chapter 4 verse 18
[6:31] you know where it says there is no fear
[6:33] in love but perfect love casteth out
[6:35] fear but you know out of had of her you
[6:39] know rushing and writing the text so
[6:41] quickly you know she forgot the the the
[6:45] first the number 1 John chapter 4 so it
[6:48] said John chapter 4 verse 18 so of
[6:51] course when the girl when the girl
[6:53] received it it said for you have had
[6:56] five husbands the one you live with now
[6:59] is not your husband so you know that's
[7:06] that's one of them typos you know but I
[7:09] thought that that was funny and kind of
[7:11] make ya'll laugh and kind of start it a
[7:14] little bit right you know praise the
[7:16] Lord so but we want to talk take this
[7:20] topic and just you know sometimes we
[7:22] I've always thought you know I wonder
[7:24] what what it is what what is the
[7:26] connection between love fear faith and
[7:29] all those things and there is a huge
[7:31] connection there and and so you know
[7:36] because the Bible says Paul Paul tells
[7:39] us that he had the Lord has not given us
[7:41] the spirit of fear but of power and of a
[7:43] sound mind you know I'm also reminded of
[7:46] what of what Paul said that the the
[7:49] gifts or the fruits of the spirit are
[7:53] love joy peace longsuffering and all
[7:58] those good things you can read there in
[7:59] Galatians I believe it is there but none
[8:01] of those and none of those do you see
[8:04] the word fear it's always a love love
[8:08] and that love Saints is the love of God
[8:11] which is the agape love of God amen so
[8:14] for us for us Christians amen
[8:17] you have this this evening I mean if
[8:20] you're born again by the Spirit of God
[8:22] amen perfect love in you amen that's
[8:26] this is just what the Bible says amen
[8:28] the perfect love resides in you even
[8:31] though it's hard for us to manifest it
[8:33] on the outside that's the reason why we
[8:35] need the statue of a perfect man amen
[8:37] praise God but if if God's eternal life
[8:41] dwells in your soul amen then all of God
[8:43] dwells in you amen
[8:45] praise God so we're just waiting for
[8:47] this body to catch up to that praise the
[8:49] Lord Amen so we're gonna just look at
[8:51] some slides here and hopefully the the
[8:53] ones at home can benefit and be able to
[8:57] view them tonight so amen so we see here
[9:04] in first John chapter 4 verse 16 and
[9:08] says and we have known and believed the
[9:10] love that God hath to us god is love and
[9:13] he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God
[9:16] and God in him Amen why because God is
[9:21] love so love dwells in you Amen if God
[9:25] is in you right it just makes sense
[9:28] praise the Lord first John 4:7 says
[9:30] beloved let us love one another for love
[9:33] is of God
[9:35] and every one that loveth is born of God
[9:38] and knoweth God next slide amen what is
[9:43] agape love the word love in verse 16 is
[9:48] agape love which is is the Greek word in
[9:51] which the love that God loves us with it
[9:54] means charity I think I meant to put
[9:56] something else there and I'm that I
[9:58] missed it but charitably feasts of
[10:00] charity brotherly love amen
[10:03] affection goodwill love benevolence love
[10:06] feasts and first John 4:16 says and we
[10:09] have known and believed the love that
[10:12] God hath to us amen praise God so that's
[10:16] the love that God loves us amen that
[10:19] loves us He loves us with he doesn't
[10:21] love us you know he's not like you and I
[10:24] mean we do something to one another and
[10:26] something a man might get in between
[10:29] that love that that's an affiliate love
[10:31] you see they may get in between there
[10:33] but Amen when you truly love by man with
[10:37] the perfect love of God amen no matter
[10:39] what happens amen
[10:40] the love of God outtakes outshines amen
[10:43] and we're gonna see later on a man that
[10:45] the love of God the perfect love of God
[10:48] is shown most of the time and most in
[10:52] most instances in the word it was
[10:54] displayed in the times of trials and
[10:56] tribulations Amen so let's go to the
[10:59] next slide so what is filial love and
[11:02] and it's feel love is which the physical
[11:06] human love we have for one another or
[11:08] even animals see if you have a pet
[11:10] that's and you love that pet that's
[11:13] that's filial love it's it means to love
[11:15] to approve up to kiss to show signs of
[11:18] love to treat affectionately or kindly
[11:20] to be fond of doing and verse that
[11:23] mentions that kind of love in the Bible
[11:26] he that loveth father or mother more
[11:28] than me is not worthy of me jesus said
[11:31] and when you look up that word loveth
[11:33] that's the word phileo the Greek word
[11:36] phileo
[11:36] so nothing wrong with this love as a
[11:40] matter of fact when we're born in the
[11:42] world that's the first love that we have
[11:44] for your mom and your dad you know
[11:46] for the first fake in the first face
[11:49] that you see is your mom's most of the
[11:52] times sometimes it's nurse butt or the
[11:57] doctor but that's that's the first type
[12:01] of love that we come to this world and
[12:04] we have amen the only way you can get
[12:06] that filial love is through is through
[12:08] born-again experience that's the only
[12:10] way that you can obtain that filial love
[12:12] amen next slide where the Brenham says
[12:15] here now love one another above
[12:17] everything that you do love one another
[12:20] and as you love one another you'll love
[12:22] God's see you love each other and you'll
[12:25] love God for god is love and a man that
[12:29] walks in love walks in life praise the
[12:33] Lord I like that amen because again the
[12:36] this love of God this perfect love of
[12:38] God relates to eternal life right amen
[12:42] in next slide and perfect love casteth
[12:45] out all fear brother branham continue
[12:47] then if you can take him at his word and
[12:50] not fear a bit about it say lord I love
[12:54] you I know you're going to answer
[12:56] because you promised me you would and I
[12:59] just know you're going to do it see and
[13:02] it takes away all fear Amen praise God
[13:06] next slide how can you have faith in
[13:09] your wife if you don't love her that's
[13:13] in filial now how about a gap oh to to
[13:16] God how can it be if you don't love God
[13:19] if you said you love your wife and never
[13:21] tell her about it and never sit down and
[13:24] make love to her expressing it to her
[13:26] kiss her hug her and tell her she's the
[13:29] best cook in the country I hope you
[13:32] brothers do that amen we got some of
[13:37] them to raise their hands all the things
[13:41] that you know and how pretty she is and
[13:43] how much you love her if if you don't do
[13:46] that she'll never know it that's the way
[13:49] if you do love her you express it that's
[13:52] the way we do to God when we love him we
[13:55] tell him about it we sat down and we
[13:57] adore him and worship Him and
[13:59] love drives us to that amen all the
[14:04] things that you know and how pretty
[14:06] is this we're ready that next slide okay
[14:10] so so the the love of God you see we
[14:15] express our love to God amen both in the
[14:17] filial and when you have eternal life a
[14:19] man in the agape as well you see that
[14:22] sometimes I don't know if you ever had
[14:23] those instances where you just you're
[14:25] you you're just praying and you just you
[14:27] you you feel that love for him and you
[14:29] just want to worship Him and I've had
[14:31] times like that when you know where you
[14:33] just cry and it's just like Lord I I
[14:36] just wish I could just you could be
[14:38] right here and I could just hug you and
[14:40] you just have me around around you and
[14:42] you around me you see and and that's
[14:44] that and there's nothing wrong with that
[14:46] but Satan will come in and try to will
[14:49] try to pervert that in in people's life
[14:51] and we'll look at something here in just
[14:54] a moment so God doesn't want us to just
[14:56] abide in filial love because that love
[14:59] can easily fail you see that you know
[15:03] you see it in little kids you know
[15:06] little kids when they fight when I don't
[15:07] love you anymore and they'll do you know
[15:10] but sometimes they don't know what
[15:12] they're talking about you know but but
[15:14] you see that love fails you see brother
[15:19] Dale maybe I did I do something to
[15:21] brother Dale or Dale does something to
[15:23] me or something like that and and if we
[15:26] don't have the Holy Ghost amen and if we
[15:29] just loved one another in the phileo
[15:31] amen that something something that
[15:33] something happens in between there that
[15:35] could just break the relationship right
[15:36] there
[15:37] but see this shouldn't be so with
[15:38] brothers and sisters in Christ amen
[15:41] praise God God's agape love can never
[15:44] fail because it's eternal pure
[15:47] life-giving love amen it's it's eternal
[15:51] life right praise God
[15:53] next slide now here's a perverted type
[15:57] of love right here this is another type
[16:00] of love it's a perversion
[16:01] it's called narcissism how many have
[16:04] heard of that amen
[16:06] it comes from the Greek mythology who
[16:09] ableism it was a person by the name of
[16:11] narcissus a young
[16:12] man he fell in love with his reflection
[16:15] in the water and and and he was looking
[16:18] at it so long and just fell in love with
[16:21] it and there was people I believe it was
[16:23] a woman called echo was trying to call
[16:27] out the call to her and he didn't care
[16:29] anything about her
[16:30] he just wanted he just looked at his
[16:32] reflection fell in love with it so much
[16:34] that he fell in the pool and drowned
[16:36] that was that's that's the story see so
[16:41] he goes it teaches a lesson sometimes
[16:43] people are so stuck on themselves stuck
[16:48] on stuck on themselves and don't care
[16:50] anything about what's going on around
[16:52] them other people around them amen
[16:55] in and this is what narcissism means is
[16:58] this excessive interest or in in or
[17:00] admiration of oneself or one's physical
[17:03] appearance nothing wrong with wanting to
[17:06] look nice
[17:07] but if that's how you care about you
[17:09] have narcissism selfishness involving a
[17:13] sense of entitlement
[17:14] that's narcissistic as well a lack of
[17:17] empathy and a need for admiration in
[17:20] other words you always need somebody to
[17:22] pat you on the back or say something
[17:24] good to you in order for you to move on
[17:26] in life
[17:26] that's a narcissistic attitude as well
[17:28] and you know what says technology and
[17:31] society has made people that way today
[17:34] the other they just made us made them
[17:36] exactly that way let me give you an
[17:38] example everybody around you but this is
[17:44] all that we do nobody's talking with
[17:48] each other nobody's fellowshipping with
[17:50] each other that is a narcissistic
[17:52] attitude that's the reason why these are
[17:54] called iPads and iPhones and all those
[18:00] things because it has to do with III me
[18:03] me me
[18:04] [Laughter]
[18:05] so we're if we're not careful Saints the
[18:08] society can make us narcissistic and we
[18:11] don't even know it second Timothy three
[18:13] versus one or two this says this know
[18:16] also that in the last days perilous
[18:18] times shall come for man shall be lovers
[18:21] of their own selves
[18:22] and the verse continues but that but
[18:25] that's the that's the point I want to
[18:26] make with that so that's a perverted
[18:28] type of love and that's not the type of
[18:30] love we want it we want to we want to
[18:32] have now there are two types of fear in
[18:35] the Bible because Saints you know the
[18:38] Bible tells us in one place to fear God
[18:40] love him love his commandments fear him
[18:44] and then another place is as fear you
[18:47] know we shouldn't fear you see for
[18:50] example Ecclesiastes 12:13 let us hear
[18:52] the conclusion of the whole matter fear
[18:54] God but that type of fear there is a
[18:56] respect of reverence and keep his
[18:59] Commandments for this is a whole duty of
[19:02] man amen if you go back to the previous
[19:05] sermon that I preached about respect
[19:07] amen you can you can can look more into
[19:09] that and about fearing God amen
[19:11] respecting God amen second Timothy 1:7
[19:15] for God hath not given us the spirit of
[19:18] fear
[19:19] now that fear right there that Paul was
[19:21] talking about was cowardice or being
[19:23] timid now we're not willing to take that
[19:25] step for God that's the spirit of fear
[19:29] that got that that God does not want us
[19:31] to have but of power and of love and of
[19:33] a sound mind Saints that's that's the
[19:36] kind of that's the kind of power that
[19:38] God has given us in this hour so it
[19:40] doesn't matter what goes on in the world
[19:41] doesn't matter what's happening doesn't
[19:44] matter what's taking place a man when
[19:46] God is in you through the baptism of the
[19:48] Holy Ghost amen
[19:50] that you has not given you the spirit of
[19:52] fear amen but of power and a sound mind
[19:55] amen and we're more than what remember
[19:58] that he said he said what was it that he
[20:01] said do not fear because however I have
[20:04] overcome the world amen
[20:06] so if he's overcome the world amen and
[20:08] we're overcomers with him why do we have
[20:10] to fear you see there's no there's no
[20:13] space for fear in a believers life amen
[20:17] praise God next so where does love where
[20:22] does perfect love originate from now
[20:25] first John 4:18 that we just read it
[20:28] says there is no fear in love see there
[20:31] is no fear in love in other words it
[20:34] there is no space for fearing
[20:36] when you have the true love of God but
[20:39] perfect love casteth out fear because
[20:41] fear hath torment ya
[20:45] in other words it bothers you it
[20:47] torments you it condemns you it causes
[20:51] it even leads to hatred and all these
[20:55] things he that feareth is not made
[20:58] perfect in love
[20:59] Amen Adam and Eve were created in the
[21:02] image of God we believe that amen and
[21:05] Adam and Eve had eternal life in their
[21:08] soul praise God amen therefore Adam and
[21:11] Eve had perfect love amen
[21:14] they had dominion over nature full faith
[21:17] not afraid of anything that's why Adam
[21:20] could could step in with calm and peace
[21:24] and be able to name the animals and not
[21:27] be afraid be around the tiger be around
[21:30] the lion and say look you are lion or
[21:33] you are tiger
[21:35] and not be afraid at all because he had
[21:38] perfect love dominated his his being you
[21:42] see and there is only one source of
[21:45] eternal life and what and one source of
[21:47] perfect love and that is God and so that
[21:50] is that is that is what Adam received
[21:52] from God when God breathed into his
[21:55] nostrils that that breath of eternal
[21:57] life amen
[21:57] perfect love came right with it Amen
[22:00] because remember when were what God is
[22:02] God is love agape love amen praise God I
[22:07] hope I hope everybody's understanding
[22:08] where I'm coming from next now look what
[22:12] brother Brown says here he says and he
[22:14] must have took her by the hand speaking
[22:15] of Adam - even we'd say this said let's
[22:18] take a little stroll darling that was
[22:21] mr. and mrs. you years ago and we took a
[22:26] little stroll and they went down through
[22:28] the garden and the first thing you know
[22:30] there come a ferocious roar out of the
[22:32] jungle who was it it was Leo the Lion
[22:35] she couldn't get next slide scared she
[22:39] couldn't get scared
[22:40] wasn't nothing about her to scare she
[22:43] had perfect love and love casteth out
[22:46] fear
[22:47] amen and he Adam said come here leo
[22:51] I like that come here Eve you've never
[22:56] met you've never met it this I have
[22:58] called him the lion I've named
[23:00] everything here and he scratched him on
[23:02] the back of the neck and he me out like
[23:05] a kitty and followed them you see that
[23:07] that that's and we're destined to come
[23:09] back to that st. that's
[23:11] that's that's for sure that that's where
[23:14] we're coming back to amen
[23:16] we're and that's why we're the wades
[23:18] been mentioning lately but that's the
[23:20] reason why the the creation is grown and
[23:23] in travailing for this to be back they
[23:27] want to be led the leo the lion wants to
[23:30] be led what the tiger wants to be led
[23:33] wants to be able to be scratched by us
[23:35] on the back and purr like a kitty you
[23:38] see and you want that too and the reason
[23:40] why you want it and the lion wants it is
[23:43] because it's there hey man we just have
[23:46] to bring it to manifestation they men
[23:48] and you know what Saints it's trials and
[23:50] the problems that we are going through
[23:52] right now and the things and lot and
[23:54] there's life that's going to push that
[23:55] out of us amen I believe that with all
[23:58] my heart
[23:58] next slide so let's look at the law here
[24:03] for just a moment the law could not
[24:04] produce perfect love it couldn't Hebrews
[24:08] 719 says for the law made nothing
[24:10] perfect but the bringing and of a better
[24:14] hope did but by the which we draw nigh
[24:17] unto God so you see they with the law
[24:20] they were able to draw nigh onto God
[24:23] then give them eternal life they didn't
[24:25] give them perfect perfection in their
[24:27] soul but it draws them closer to God it
[24:30] was almost a form of salvation you see
[24:32] but it wasn't eternal life in their soul
[24:35] because the law made nothing perfect
[24:37] God's will
[24:39] was not to give his children to law
[24:41] right that's not what he wanted to give
[24:43] them but they wanted that and because
[24:46] they wanted that he gave it to them
[24:49] knowing that they were not going to be
[24:51] able to keep it and hoping that they
[24:53] were going to be able to realize I can't
[24:55] keep it and and of course that's why he
[24:58] came as as Jesus Christ
[25:01] and died for them and they were they
[25:03] think they couldn't realize well that
[25:06] they could not keep the law because even
[25:07] though Christ had come on the scene they
[25:09] were still yet trying to still keep the
[25:11] law and doing things on their own when
[25:13] Christ had already taken all that all
[25:15] the law upon himself so with the law
[25:19] with that law came worries it came from
[25:24] feared torment because they could not
[25:27] keep it that they were oh my goodness
[25:30] III didn't make such sacrifice today or
[25:33] I didn't I went past the time that I
[25:37] needed to to you know pass the Sabbath
[25:40] and all those different laws that they
[25:42] had you see they had all those things
[25:43] bombarded in mind and not being able to
[25:46] love God with all of their heart you see
[25:48] because they had to keep a book of rules
[25:51] you see and it wasn't what God even
[25:54] though it was God's Word it was still
[25:56] something that God knew that they were
[25:59] not going to be able to keep a child
[26:02] willingly obeying and respecting their
[26:04] parents is showing them love and the
[26:08] reason why if a child is showing them
[26:10] love and willingly respecting and
[26:12] obeying his parents it's probably
[26:14] because the parents are showing them
[26:16] that kind of love as well
[26:17] you see therefore the child responds
[26:20] that way as well but when a child is
[26:23] obeying a parent or showing respect but
[26:29] not doing it willingly or not doing it
[26:31] all with all his heart and and thinks
[26:35] that maybe is just doing it out of fear
[26:37] Amen there is it's probably because
[26:40] that's what the parent is displaying to
[26:41] them
[26:42] you see it's probably because that's
[26:43] what the parent is is showing them
[26:45] therefore they're just gonna respond
[26:47] back with fear you see so that's what
[26:50] the children of Israel we're almost
[26:52] almost like you see very few back there
[26:56] in the Old Testament could really you
[26:59] know David would express this I love the
[27:01] law I love the you know and things like
[27:03] that and and not be a burden but to a
[27:07] lot of them most of the time the
[27:09] children of Israel they would they would
[27:11] slack off from obeying God and in
[27:13] and it would become a burden for them
[27:15] and God knew that and God wanted them to
[27:18] realize that on their own but of course
[27:19] they didn't and then some people still
[27:23] live by the law today thinking that
[27:26] their own works will bring approval or
[27:28] disapproval from God and it can't you
[27:32] have to depend on what he's done for you
[27:33] already
[27:34] amen I've always said and something
[27:36] that's helped me as I was growing up
[27:38] because you know I grew up my first
[27:41] parts of my early years I grew up
[27:44] Catholic up to I was 12 years old or 10
[27:48] years old and then Jehovah's Witness
[27:50] came knocking at our door but but but
[27:55] you know I grew up Catholic so I grew up
[27:57] with that mentality that there's
[27:59] something that I have to do to please
[28:00] God you know and and and so if you're
[28:06] not careful Hispanic people they tend to
[28:08] lean that way a lot Latino people that's
[28:11] one of the things you go to a Latin
[28:12] country and preach the Word of God to
[28:14] them they have that mentality that
[28:16] there's something that they got to do to
[28:18] the reverence you know to the pasture to
[28:21] the preacher you know and you have to
[28:23] kind of snap them out of that you know
[28:25] and say just believe God you know just
[28:28] have faith in God God's already done it
[28:30] for you you see you see and when you and
[28:32] when you can come to that and say Lord I
[28:35] can't save myself and I can't forgive my
[28:37] own sin you're the only one that can do
[28:39] it for me then you can have freedom and
[28:41] liberty and no fear to continue moving
[28:44] on you see but sometimes we're the ones
[28:47] who bring the condemnation on ourselves
[28:49] and God's trying to set us free
[28:51] take us out take us out from the from
[28:53] the spiritual quarantine that we're in
[28:56] there to get us free but we we we
[28:59] somehow lock ourselves back in you see
[29:01] and it's not God's fault it's your fault
[29:04] because you don't believe his word oh
[29:07] man praise God next now Jesus comes the
[29:11] storm this is one of my favorite
[29:14] examples of the peace of God you want to
[29:18] find a good example the peace of God
[29:19] just just look at Jesus sleeping on the
[29:21] boat while in the middle of the storm
[29:24] I don't know of any other example about
[29:27] the peace of God than that
[29:28] I mean you're in the back of a boat and
[29:31] I don't know exactly how big the bow is
[29:33] and I don't think it was a cruise liner
[29:35] either but it was enough for for the
[29:40] disciples to be in as well as him but he
[29:43] was in the middle of the storm sleeping
[29:46] obviously he was tired but because the
[29:50] fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelled
[29:52] in him he couldn't help but display
[29:55] perfect love in the time in the time of
[29:58] fear you see that's the reason that's a
[30:01] great example of Jesus showing His
[30:03] perfect love casteth out all fear
[30:05] in the middle of a storm he knew who was
[30:08] in control you know that the sight Jesus
[30:11] had told him he said let's just go to
[30:12] the other side you can read that on
[30:14] Martin Martin chapter 4 verse 35 let's
[30:16] go to the other side the disciples
[30:18] should have known you know he's he's
[30:20] already healed many people things have
[30:22] already taken place they should have
[30:24] just said you know what we're gonna get
[30:26] to the other side we believe him because
[30:28] he says we're let's go to the other side
[30:29] so we're just gonna go go to the other
[30:31] side amen and you know and in this day
[30:34] Saints but I believe that God is Jesus
[30:37] is telling us the same thing the Word of
[30:39] God is telling us let's just move on to
[30:41] the other side amen
[30:42] praise God and we should just believe
[30:44] that he's gonna move us to the other
[30:47] side he's gonna move us ahead of ahead
[30:49] of this time amen aren't you thankful
[30:51] that there's a word that can take us to
[30:53] the other side amen
[30:55] praise God and so the disciples they
[30:57] should have known that but when the one
[30:59] the storm came oh you know it's just how
[31:01] we're happy you know roaring the boat oh
[31:04] you know rowing the boat of life and and
[31:06] it's fun you know when everybody's
[31:08] everything's going fine and dandy and
[31:11] you know in Mutt and your job is there
[31:15] and there's money in the bank and
[31:17] there's food in the pantry and all these
[31:19] kind of things but watch when the storm
[31:21] comes in all of a sudden what are you
[31:25] gonna do then are you gonna fear are you
[31:28] gonna believe God Jesus said so Jesus
[31:33] was sleeping in the boat during the
[31:34] storm
[31:36] said let's go to the other side and all
[31:38] the disciples have to do was just
[31:40] believe that and then after that when
[31:42] Jesus gets up the only thing is there
[31:45] why are you so fearful why didn't they
[31:49] have faith right the obviously they were
[31:53] not born again therefore they could not
[31:55] have perfect faith you see they could
[31:58] not have the faith that Jesus had
[32:00] because they were not born again exactly
[32:02] all right how many understand I hope
[32:07] that the listeners at home are
[32:08] understanding this a little bit next so
[32:12] you know as human beings as regular
[32:14] human beings that's just the the natural
[32:16] way of us for us to act they're in
[32:19] trouble sometimes but as a Christian
[32:22] saints we should not have to act that
[32:23] way you see brother Brown says this
[32:27] loving him always say we have faith we
[32:30] have love but if we had love we'd have
[32:32] faith for that is perfect love casteth
[32:36] out all fear and when fear is gone faith
[32:40] is perfect you're scared he won't you're
[32:44] scared he won't keep his word but I
[32:46] believe that he does and now we'll find
[32:49] what he did
[32:50] Amen so next slide now I like this I
[32:54] like this right here
[32:55] look what brother Branham says that
[32:57] faith is loves incentive now the word
[33:00] plainly states if you want to put this
[33:02] down in Galatians five and six and it's
[33:04] only mentioned in Galatians five but
[33:06] that's our that's right that faith
[33:08] worketh by love see faith worketh by
[33:12] love and the only way that you can have
[33:14] faith is have love first and we'll get
[33:19] to that in just a moment because after
[33:20] all faith is loves incentive what is an
[33:26] incentive it's something that comes with
[33:28] the package you see a little bonus a
[33:31] bonus the main thing is the love faith
[33:35] is the bonus that comes with it you see
[33:37] but you cannot be born without born
[33:39] again without faith you see you have to
[33:42] have faith in order to be born again
[33:43] right incentive that's exactly what what
[33:48] faith is is an
[33:49] incentive to love now you if you don't
[33:52] have love you can't have faith see next
[33:56] slide okay all right so I thought that
[34:00] that was it so you have to have now I
[34:03] put the statue of a perfect man here and
[34:05] I hope I hope this is understanding even
[34:08] if I'm wrong you tell me a birthday you
[34:11] tell me if I'm wrong because you are
[34:13] born again at faith right Christ is the
[34:17] foundation right which which gives you
[34:20] eternal life in your soul right Amen
[34:23] that eternal life is perfect love in
[34:27] your soul that's the reason why brother
[34:29] Branham just now said that he said that
[34:31] you can't have perfect love without
[34:33] faith oh but you can have faith without
[34:34] love they meant because love and eternal
[34:37] life is the same thing you see that
[34:40] eternal life is perfect love in your
[34:42] soul having access to this perfect love
[34:45] allows you to access faith in the time
[34:47] of need you see there's a there's a
[34:50] connection there's there's a constant
[34:52] connection here back and forth back and
[34:55] forth so potentially when you have the
[34:58] new birth you have all of this right in
[35:01] your soul it's just that the Holy Ghost
[35:03] as you're living and you're feeding more
[35:05] off the Word of God it's pushing these
[35:08] these things from your from your life
[35:11] into your life to express it on the
[35:13] outside man you see but all of this is
[35:15] already ends here so the why why should
[35:17] we worry Saints ask you at home why
[35:20] should we worry
[35:21] what can a coronavirus do to us what can
[35:25] man do to us amen when we have all of
[35:28] God in us you see
[35:29] praise God from grace to faith from
[35:33] faith to grace and love you see praise
[35:35] God next slide it's all Jesus Christ
[35:39] from faith to love Grace and back amen
[35:43] it's just kind of like I kind of say
[35:45] it's kind of like a like oh if you just
[35:48] kind of look at it carnally like an
[35:49] electricity just going back and forth
[35:51] back and forth it's a full connection
[35:53] you see Jesus is the cornerstone as much
[35:57] as he is the headstone
[35:59] you see he is the cornerstone he is the
[36:00] foundation a man just as much as he is
[36:03] the headstone praise God it's all one
[36:06] unit Christ in you the hope of glory so
[36:10] we are striving to manifest all of those
[36:12] virtues on this outside man praise God
[36:15] so this is this is what we striving for
[36:20] in this our saints but you you have to
[36:22] be born again at faith amen and when you
[36:26] born again amen
[36:28] that perfect love already resides in you
[36:30] now there's many times when and we'll
[36:35] look at here in just a moment but
[36:36] brother Branham there was times where he
[36:38] displayed that perfect glove in his life
[36:40] the the Raging Bull coming at him now he
[36:45] didn't he wasn't he he wasn't it
[36:48] he had not finished you know all of the
[36:50] stature of a perfect man in his life but
[36:53] yeah he was able to display that perfect
[36:55] love in his life you see I don't know if
[37:00] you understand what I'm what I'm saying
[37:02] because why that perfect love resided in
[37:04] him and in the time of need it came to -
[37:07] it came to to show forth you see all
[37:11] right examples of perfect love in action
[37:13] and this is an image when Peter and the
[37:16] disciples came out preaching to the to
[37:18] the three thousand Amen they were there
[37:20] they were there you know they went in
[37:22] there scared
[37:23] they went in there fearful but when he
[37:26] came out of it when they received the
[37:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul
[37:29] there was none of that after that there
[37:31] was boldness after that you see and
[37:33] that's what a born-again Christian has a
[37:35] man boldness to continue no matter who's
[37:38] making fun of me no matter what happens
[37:40] I'm still gonna move on with God's Word
[37:42] why because God's Word has taken the
[37:45] preeminence in my life amen
[37:46] so brother Branham he stops a charging
[37:49] bull we just talked about but the
[37:52] Branham stops a maniac from charging
[37:54] towards him and seed by in the
[37:55] campaign's maniac wanted to fight to to
[37:58] to to hurt him and and in brother
[38:01] Branham all he say he said he felt sorry
[38:04] for the man he loved the man rather than
[38:07] then oh okay alright let's go then from
[38:10] the pulpit you know he didn't do that
[38:13] no he said he said he just loved a man
[38:16] and that love caused that man to get out
[38:18] and down on his knees amen and of course
[38:22] Peter and the disciples were not afraid
[38:24] anymore after receiving the Holy Ghost
[38:26] amen
[38:27] that perfect love that dwelled in them
[38:30] you see amen
[38:32] next slide now as I mentioned earlier
[38:37] perfect love usually shines brighter
[38:40] during trials and tribulations and Jesus
[38:43] on the cross he could he could say at
[38:47] that moment Father forgive them for they
[38:48] know not what they do no fear he knew
[38:52] what he knew what was happening he was
[38:54] he was he was a there was no fear there
[38:58] was no condemnation there was nothing it
[39:00] was just perfect love being man if this
[39:02] blade and he could love those that were
[39:04] striking him he could love those that
[39:06] were putting they're putting him on that
[39:07] cross and so much that he said Father
[39:09] forgive them for they know not what they
[39:11] do
[39:11] and and because that fullness that
[39:14] dwelled in him when it's passed down to
[39:17] his children Stephen could do the same
[39:19] thing as well later on Stephen when he
[39:22] was being when he was being stoned and
[39:25] others later did the same exact thing as
[39:28] they were dying for their faith he they
[39:30] said the same thing Father forgive them
[39:32] for they know not what they do and you
[39:34] see Saints no matter what happens right
[39:36] now no matter what's going on there you
[39:39] know there it it makes me just draw
[39:44] closer to God it makes me love those
[39:47] that they're unlovable more and it
[39:51] should because you know there's many
[39:55] things that could be taken you know we
[39:58] hear the news we sometimes we don't know
[39:59] what they're not telling us but at the
[40:01] same time Saints no matter what happens
[40:04] you know this thing has to wind down so
[40:05] in some way or another and if they're
[40:09] holding like your thing brother doe said
[40:10] a couple of weeks ago they're holding a
[40:12] gun to your head what can you say at
[40:14] that moment do you just love it do you
[40:17] just love those that love you or can you
[40:20] still love in the midst midst of wolves
[40:23] that's that's a big that's a big
[40:25] question that shows if that perfect love
[40:30] resides and you are not or are you or
[40:33] are you gonna get vengeful are you gonna
[40:35] just go back hit hit back you know Jesus
[40:38] Christ didn't do that
[40:39] neither did Stephen and many of the
[40:43] other ones that died for the faith
[40:45] didn't do it either amen praise God next
[40:49] so how would do we obtain this perfect
[40:52] love is just a simple remedy get born
[40:54] again get born again receive the Word of
[40:58] God as you receive the word and believe
[41:02] it and it's revealed to you that makes
[41:04] you a candidate more for the Holy Ghost
[41:06] more of God more of God in you amen it's
[41:10] not up it's not something difficult it's
[41:13] as simple as getting born again a true
[41:16] birth will bring the sea to that will
[41:19] cast out fear amen the perfect love
[41:21] casting out for your next lot have
[41:25] boldness in the Day of Judgment first
[41:27] John 4:17 herein is our love made
[41:30] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[41:33] Day of Judgment in other words in the in
[41:35] the day of trouble right you see we know
[41:38] that with the believer doesn't have to
[41:40] go through the judgment but in the day
[41:42] of trouble because they let me tell you
[41:45] if you're a Christian you're gonna go
[41:46] through troubles and don't tell me that
[41:49] we're not going through troubles right
[41:50] now as difficulties are coming or have
[41:53] come and difficult more difficulties are
[41:55] coming on our way you need to assure be
[41:59] secure and sure that you have this
[42:02] boldness this perfect love dwelling
[42:04] within you amen boldness so that we hear
[42:08] and as I love made perfect that we may
[42:10] have boldness in the Day of Judgment
[42:12] because as he is so are we in this world
[42:17] and I like that because it's present
[42:19] tense so are we in this world so Saints
[42:24] this is your time to put in action what
[42:27] God has placed in you amen
[42:29] it is your time to shine don't look at
[42:33] this as
[42:34] as something that negative and yes it's
[42:38] bad it's terrible but look at it this is
[42:40] my time to shine and I'm not going to be
[42:43] able to shine any other way
[42:44] amen this is my time for that's for that
[42:48] sweet juice a man of the Orangemen when
[42:51] you're when you want to eat an orange
[42:52] that it can only be squeezed out it can
[42:55] only come out when it's squeezed this is
[42:58] our time to shine and if it's not the
[43:01] time a mint for the coming of the Lord
[43:03] or for the things that they are promised
[43:05] in the word to still be fulfilled
[43:07] amen we're at Lisa it helps it trains us
[43:10] amen it trains us because surf certain
[43:14] that time is coming amen praise God I
[43:19] think that's it or may might be another
[43:21] slide oh yes bourbon says I believe that
[43:24] the reason we don't have desperation is
[43:26] because it's a lack of love the love of
[43:29] God I think that the love of God causes
[43:32] desperation you see Saints we you know
[43:37] the children of Israel they were laxed
[43:39] and they were everything when everything
[43:41] was going fine in Goshen they had they
[43:45] had jobs they had you know the family
[43:47] was fine and everything was going good
[43:49] but when Pharaoh started putting in and
[43:51] started coming in with with laws and
[43:53] regulations and things like that
[43:55] that's what caused them to go into
[43:57] desperation then you see but we
[44:00] shouldn't allow we shouldn't have that
[44:02] those things ain't meant to bring us
[44:05] into desperation we should always be in
[44:07] desperation desperation for our children
[44:10] that need the Lord in desperation for
[44:12] the for the for the for the abominations
[44:14] that end in the sins that are done in
[44:16] the land amen
[44:18] but are those who cry inside for the
[44:20] sins the sins that are done in the land
[44:23] amen
[44:23] I think that the love of God causes
[44:25] desperation if God is in you the token
[44:28] inside of you and you see the conditions
[44:31] of times and people waiting in sin the
[44:34] way they are it'll throw you into
[44:36] desperation I believe it will brother
[44:38] Brendan sir amen next slide now let's
[44:42] just read here in Romans chapter eight
[44:44] and with
[44:45] we're gonna finish Roman scepter a very
[44:48] familiar scriptures to us but look what
[44:50] Paul says here what shall we then say to
[44:52] these things if God be for us who can be
[44:55] against us there is I don't see anywhere
[44:58] where fear fits in that you see who
[45:01] shall separate us from the love of
[45:03] Christ the love of Christ shall
[45:07] tribulation or distress or persecution
[45:10] or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
[45:14] as it is written for thy sake we are
[45:18] killed all the day long we are accounted
[45:20] as sheep for the slaughter
[45:23] nay in in all these things we are more
[45:26] than conquerors through him that loved
[45:29] us do you know that you and I are the
[45:31] most powerful people here on this earth
[45:32] day man it's not any government is not
[45:35] any man it's not Bill Gates it's it's
[45:38] you amen you're the most powerful man
[45:41] man and woman in the world right now and
[45:44] the world has no clue for I am persuaded
[45:47] that neither death nor life nor Angels
[45:49] nor principalities nor powers nor things
[45:53] present nor things to come nor height
[45:56] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[45:58] be able to separate us from the love of
[46:01] God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord
[46:05] and if you are in Christ amen then that
[46:08] love dwells in you that's why I can't
[46:10] you can't be separated from that love
[46:12] you see because your God in flesh in
[46:16] this day amen and-and-and-and those
[46:21] there there is the ones that you know
[46:24] who have the Spirit of God amen those
[46:26] that that not deny but confess that
[46:28] Christ has come in the flesh that Christ
[46:31] is here right now in flesh in you and I
[46:34] hey Maury praise God I believe that's it
[46:38] so I hope that somebody got a blessing
[46:40] out of that and and understand that love
[46:44] casts out fear amen right it's not
[46:46] something difficult is not something
[46:48] complicated it's just simple get the new
[46:52] birth in your life amen and that fear
[46:56] right man whatever it is fear
[46:58] whatever it'll go away you'll be able to
[47:01] face whatever and it wouldn't bother me
[47:04] one bit why because I know God's in
[47:06] control
[47:07] amen he's in control of my life and he's
[47:10] in control of the present day in the
[47:13] present day things you know Saints I was
[47:15] mentioning to a brother this week and I
[47:17] said you know you know Satan you know is
[47:22] is just a tool in the gut in the in the
[47:24] hands of God is what brother Branham
[47:26] said Satan is just a tool and you know
[47:28] he could maybe there there's there's a
[47:30] certain anointing right now going on in
[47:32] the world certain men are being anointed
[47:34] to to put out certain laws and do
[47:37] certain things and stuff like that but
[47:39] they they're just anointed by Satan amen
[47:42] and then Satan thinks that he's got it
[47:45] all under control but he's just a tool
[47:47] being used by God in order to express to
[47:50] for his word to come to be manifested to
[47:54] take place you see and so God's allowing
[47:57] this amen for you and I to shine in this
[48:00] hour amen
[48:01] to shine in this hour so take advantage
[48:03] of it hey man
[48:05] praise God how many love the Lord and
[48:07] then brother brother boy if you want to
[48:08] come kind of cut it cut it short this
[48:10] this evening but I hope that you got
[48:13] something out of that
[48:14] [Music]
[48:32] praise the Lord Saints what wonderful
[48:36] times that we live in in this hour you
[48:38] know brother Brandon was asked he said
[48:39] what age would you have rather lived and
[48:43] a lot of people may have said well I'd
[48:44] love to live in the days of Jesus that's
[48:47] wonderful to see and to feel and to hold
[48:50] Jesus hand and hug his neck and to kiss
[48:52] him and touch even to just touch the
[48:55] border of His garment that would have
[48:56] been wonderful or maybe in the days of
[49:00] when Wesley and then they were preaching
[49:02] a Great Awakening you know during that
[49:04] time and there was a revival taking
[49:06] place Charles Spurgeon and all those out
[49:09] man I would have loved to sit down and
[49:10] listen to Charles Spurgeon you know he's
[49:12] one of my my favorite preachers back
[49:14] then you know I would have loved to
[49:16] listen to him but you know what brother
[49:18] Branham said that this day is the is the
[49:21] best day is that I wouldn't I wouldn't
[49:22] trade this day for another day and that
[49:25] was back in the 50s and 60s when he said
[49:27] that so can you say the same thing
[49:29] because there some people are still
[49:31] living back in that era spiritually they
[49:34] are but you know what we are here in
[49:38] this present hour what are you going to
[49:40] do with what God has given you in this
[49:42] present hour it can't serve you back in
[49:44] the 40s 50s and 60s because that's
[49:46] that's a day gone by but the word is
[49:48] still the same amen and so if that words
[49:52] in you amen
[49:53] then it's your time to display manifest
[49:56] that word to a dying world amen brother

[56:45] hallelujah praise the Lord thank God a
[56:50] man I believe brother wait he's got a
[56:52] few words so come on by the way thank
[57:00] you we are practicing our social
[57:03] distancing tonight so we must practice
[57:06] it from here back for all of you that
[57:08] are that are online we're going to have
[57:11] to change our program for Sunday it
[57:13] looks like number one we could not get
[57:16] the FM transmitter we ordered it and the
[57:18] guy turned the order down or cancelled
[57:21] the order so we can't do that so now
[57:24] we're going to go in a different
[57:24] direction we will be working on it so
[57:29] you won't be able to set in your cars
[57:31] and listen to the FM radio and we were
[57:33] going to put brother Dale outside like I
[57:34] said before but now they're saying
[57:37] there's a hundred percent chance of rain
[57:38] so if it rains what we're going to try
[57:41] to do is is have a service in here just
[57:46] like we normally do with the ten or ten
[57:48] or eleven people in the building
[57:51] and if you want to sit outside they're
[57:53] working on extending the Wi-Fi outside
[57:57] to where you can sit in your car and
[57:59] pick it up on your phone you will you
[58:03] will need a youtube app if you don't
[58:07] already have one you'll need a youtube
[58:09] app on your phone so that you can pick
[58:12] that up and we can live stream while
[58:15] you're sitting in your car outside even
[58:18] with it raining and with window rolled
[58:20] up you should still be able if you want
[58:22] to come now that's your option or you
[58:24] can stay home and watch it online but
[58:27] that's your that's your decision
[58:28] but you won't be able to come in here
[58:30] and only maybe to use the bathroom one
[58:33] person at a time like we said before
[58:35] because we'd still want our social
[58:37] distance
[58:38] we want to make sure that that this
[58:41] thing does not we don't we're not in the
[58:44] news because several churches and
[58:47] different ones have been in the news of
[58:49] saying well whatever we're going to have
[58:51] it and then they have an outbreak so
[58:52] like I said always before we don't want
[58:54] to tempt God we're not going to do that
[58:57] we have faith and we believe that God
[59:00] will keep will look at us I mean even in
[59:02] Gainesville Georgia there's 200 people
[59:04] with the virus and this is no desk
[59:06] so I mean that's kind of not ain't
[59:11] strange is god this is the county we
[59:14] live in we live in Hall County we live
[59:16] in Banks County there's just a few cases
[59:17] there so we need to keep our deficits
[59:20] distancing and also brother Dale will
[59:24] not be able to shake your hands when I'm
[59:25] going to shake any hands we may run a
[59:27] run you threw up under the bottom those
[59:30] of you that come and remember when I
[59:32] told you those are you to come
[59:33] underneath no shaking hands but you can
[59:35] roll the window down and say hey to
[59:36] brother Dale he will be in full hazmat
[59:39] gear and Darth Vader style you know but
[59:44] no just kidding we will have a face mask
[59:47] on I'm in a mask just for his protection
[59:49] he's the oldest one in the building
[59:51] right now so we want to protect our we
[59:54] don't protect our elderly and our older
[1:00:00] ones yeah so anyway we want to do it but
[1:00:06] really we don't want to wouldn't like
[1:00:07] brother we said we don't want to make
[1:00:09] fun of this thing it's serious there's
[1:00:11] people dying every minute of this thing
[1:00:13] and it's the older and a lot of the
[1:00:15] different ethnical groups that are have
[1:00:18] let's just make sure we keep praying
[1:00:19] that God will keep it away from us
[1:00:22] because we have a God like brother we've
[1:00:24] Lewis said that that I was talking about
[1:00:26] the Claude today he said to tell
[1:00:27] everybody hello they're doing the same
[1:00:29] thing and he made a wonderful statement
[1:00:31] he said you know what brother wait he
[1:00:32] said I don't fear death he said by do
[1:00:35] fear dying and if you'll think about
[1:00:37] that that's exactly true you can't walk
[1:00:41] up and say I don't fear nothing you know
[1:00:43] shoot me in the head no you're gonna
[1:00:44] have a little butterflies going on here
[1:00:46] because you know we don't fear death
[1:00:48] we've already died but we do fear died
[1:00:50] and
[1:00:51] the part of dying would be that stinking
[1:00:54] virus out there that this really
[1:00:56] suffocates you to death and it's really
[1:00:58] if you get into it it's just it's
[1:01:00] horrible
[1:01:01] and but we don't want to do that we want
[1:01:03] to come here if you can like I said
[1:01:05] before I'll send a text message out just
[1:01:07] like brother Bob did before and on
[1:01:09] Facebook to tell everybody exactly what
[1:01:11] we're going to do once we get everything

[1:01:23] watch it in your cars
[1:01:24] then when the service is over you can
[1:01:26] drive by and see brother Dale but now I
[1:01:27] do need brother Joe can you come out I
[1:01:32] meant to ask you this
[1:01:36] we still need a count right do we need
[1:01:39] to count to find out how many people are
