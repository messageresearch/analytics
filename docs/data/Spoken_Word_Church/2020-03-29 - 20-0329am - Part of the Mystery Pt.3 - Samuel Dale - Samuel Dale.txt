========================================

it's a master of the wind let's just change the order of the service as her brother comes this morning open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you oh I want to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes I want to see your power and [Music] [Applause] [Music] your shining in the light of your glory pour out your power as we sing holy holy holy holy glory holy holy amen and amen and amen and I want to see you amen amen and amen I want to see him don't you it's been a wonderful time to follow her all the way through the battle and everything but I still want to see him and then we don't it'll be there Amen for that did you see about in the house of the Lord good to see everybody on the internet system and we want to thank everybody for the doing of working and getting the internet system part to where that that does work and keeps it going to work you know the people can listen and you know if they can't get it right then they can't at least get it the services you know from from the church one website and so that's doing it and we're getting a good mini I guess you call it connections or on it so that's that's making it work out good you know and everything in the to where we can do amen okay okay if you like turning your scripture let's go to first Corinthians 2 and then we'll go to Philippians 2 and just think on these things Lord willing or remember Richard and Aaron is driving back from up with his dad's they've been up there working trying to fix a handicap ramp where he can go out and I all and just remember that and we will try to get ahold of Aaron to see about the services Wednesday you know if not we'll jump over call brother Louise and we'll have one of them in there so we try to run the search and you know the church that's the way we was running it because they don't need to changing any rules or regulations you just keep on going we'll get right down the line okay first corinthians in philippians father we thank you for this day in your grace Lord we thank you for your understand thank you for being you and we just ask you now that you'd come on the scene and just open our understanding of that word that father we may follow into thy footsteps and to see you Lord walking in the light and then we can follow in those steps and walk with you have you a remember the sick ones among us brother dick brother Al and for brother Dale and for brother Colley and all of the different ones of many many sicknesses and things ry for their back hurt and earn things and just touch each one and Lord remember them around the world all of this whole situation is going on and we just plead to blood for everybody cuz they're human beings you know and we believe that we believe your bride is protected by the blood the it the blood is applied to all if we believe it and we think you have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name so we're going to 1st Corinthians 2 we go 14 through 16 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto Him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual now like this judges all things know what yet he himself is judged of no man because he they if if he's if his judgment is correct it would be the judgment of God so then no man can come forth and and try to add anything to or mess it up or anything for who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ okay now keep that in mind we have the mind of Christ now let's go to Philippians 2 and we'll go over to verse 1 if there if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels of mercy fulfil you my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind and I notice the scripture speaks a lot about the mind doesn't it let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word so we're still in our thought I want to hold that it's part of what we're doing we're still in our part and thinking about the series part that we've been running through and we just changed titles but we're still kind of going with the point of thinking about that they without us cannot be made perfect we're still connected to that and I hope this will you know the life's message of this message and it may be another one who anchor that in to a position that you can see why they without us cannot be made perfect more into view the one thing that I want you to think about is you know even God is not complete without you the Prophet said all right see because we're part of him because he's you know us living in us all right see then he's doing that and that's the thing that we've been hitting the past couple of services that that makes a great mr. e and now it's unveiled on to us by way of the life stay messenger to show us what those are and we can talk about the engrafting of the Gentiles and things like that it's coming in as the mystery and that's fine let's do it but that's not the fool mystery see the full mystery is in Christ the mystery according the way I read it is where the Prophet said she's part of the mystery and she must be revealed in other words she's part of the mystery honor what is it then down through time God was waiting to a place not to just now listen to the wording for you not to just say engrafted Gentiles that was great that's wonderful this wonderful spot don't misunderstand me but the greater point that I've been trying to drive at is one thing you know the very fact that Christ living in you by the new birth is not listen to the word it's greater than to be sayin grafted in because it's you know in grafting is you've got to do some things and all that's great it won't come forth produces the product but to me the great mystery that was hidden before the foundation of the world and come all the way down and the Prophet said we'll see it here in our day is what that the bride of Jesus Christ is part of the mystery she's just not an engrafted thing she's a very part of him think that before the foundation of the world he knew all of this and would have it in order he had it in his mind and it would come out to be were that the church the Bride of Christ then everything would be waiting upon that bride to come to her place that's the point I drove in trying to get you to see it in the message that see they without us no matter who it is it'd be the Old Testament or it'd be the new testament and in even we found there in our studies if you want it we'll read it in a minute where he says that even God is not complete without you and me well now that's a great mystery you better believe that's a mystery I can just see people you know on the internet and they're there listening to that and you're making that statement and say where is that I had you know oh we don't we just don't believe it like that well why not why can't we believe that we're part of the mystery if it's a three-fold mystery according to Christ the mystery of God revealed all God reporting the crime all Christ into the church take her back to the Garden of Eden within she's part of the mystery and that's the thing that was hidden before the world sure the engrafting of the gentiles was hidden into that point that it you know would not be understood until it would come down to that time but still it's it's not what the point that I'm trying to get us to see that if the bride is part of the mystery then she must be revealed and the whole message then is revealing the mystery you know not just the message of Christ the mystery but the whole message that the Prophet brought is driving to the one point that's why I asked you to to read or to listen to the unveiling of God and then to listen to the mighty God unveiled because both of those messages are wonderful situations as to explaining God in his ways and what he was and how he's not three and how he's this way he's that way but each one of those comes right down to the bride and we got a little bit to go on after we get through with a couple of messages that will back up to that and pick up that seed as it comes down to see how that everything works and comes forth but seeing are you following me so Paul said we have the mind of Christ now what is the mind of Christ using that background policy and I want you to see it go see what is the mind of Christ the mind of Christ is the baptism of the Holy Ghost dwelling in the individual making that individual a part of God's complete plan in Revelation alright there's your mind not your head not your thoughts not your your ideas it floats through your brain the mind the mind that was in Christ is the baptism of the Holy Ghost its dwelling in your soul it's not just in your brain into it that's wonderful for all that we've got there you know of the parts of the mechanical and and and I thank God every day for the message that has been given unto us that we've had the opportunity for 50 years now to study one message you know the entire Bible then talking the history of the Prophet not just one book or one thought but the whole thing comes out and when it does it just keeps molding and molding to me as it just keeps rolling in Word or ever how you would say it until the whole point is if we have the mind of Christ we're gonna salt spring get the point now listen I know that the engrafting and what that means to the Gentiles and what that is the new birth but see really to think about it to come to the last part of your thinking you're part of the mystery and if you are part of the mystery then you're gonna have to be revealed all right now what is revealed you know we talked about revealed and we say well revealed is God he's not too far and he's the father he's the son he's the Holy Ghost and all these things all that is well and good because that's thinking about the revelation but really what is the revelation of God you say the mind of Christ is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we believe that what see then if the mind of Christ be the baptism of the Holy go see words the revealing coming forth it's revealing you as part of God's plan think about that back even before the foundation of the world he had in his mind what he was going to do according to Christ the mystery he had it all in and laid out in his mind what he was going to do well then come to find out as it's going he he starts out like in Christ the mystery explaining one God that's why I want you to read some of these messages like the unveiling of God he starts out explaining one God yeah but then he gets to the bride as being part of that God that has been revealed the all of your messages if you'll get them in a way take Christ the mystery he starts off as a plan and a purpose to unveil himself right but in a little bit he is speaking of a church or a bride or a group of people that's him made manifest and part of the mystery and got to be revealed so if there's something about God to be revealed you know and I still believe that when we get out of this world it'll still be opening to us I've always believed that I don't think you'd I don't think the only end the word even when you get out of this world it's just beginning it would be just be the beginning point cause we'll have enough understanding well what about when you come to that point and he strokes back at you and he says we said you were part of my mystery you were part of my mystery because you're part of me that's what makes him part of me that's what makes him to have to be revealed then then you say well now now the revealing of Jesus and God is like it reveals the Godhead it revealed to this and idea okay it reveals the Godhead see then the Godhead is not complete without you so now you're still right back to the mystery it's the point of what I'm trying to say it's a point of of revealing not yourself he never came to reveal himself he came to reveal the father or to make that God know make the father known see all right and see that's what he's doing to me and you he's waiting on the church to realize who she is and what she's doing here and then he can move on the scene into that alright the Prophet said I have to back up you remember that he said now I can't go any further said I'll have to back up until this catches up over here alright now I'm serious about that I think this is out here is catching up you know I think the world is catching up I think it's caught up to the point that I don't see what it can be I mean in a snap of a pen or whatever they could just change anything and just make anything as a law and and degrees in things you know you know and and you know as Terence of the day and listening one of the doctors was talking about it and he had a good point he said they say well this has been proven to help and this has been proven to help he said give me both of them I mean that's what that's what you said he said just give me both of them because hey I'm in bad shape like anything I mean we're dying if people are just passing away well I try something yeah but that they see anything hey come on we are the any pigs we've been up the whole time but a dead guinea pig I'm gonna help nothing well if you can give him something give it to him no you said well that's brutal why is it brutal whatever you can do to try to help mankind you do what you can do I'm just saying that point to to get you to think about what the Prophet said with this over here catches up he said I'm dropping back until it's over here well I believe he was talking about the world and the systems and the thing and I think it's pretty well caught up right now because I've been here for 50 years in this message and from that to now I've been trying to figure out how in the world can this thing happen you know I'm just serious that's I've always been into that thinking how can this thing happen how can they just and it's done well we know now how it's done you said well I said it's because of this this disease over there no there was more lost in that swine flu back there than where they are right now they're getting up close because there's like a half a million or something died back in there or have any million or something yeah and now see it's it's catching up all right let's see if those thing if that's what the Prophet is looking at then we're looking at the end and that's what I want you to do is to look at everything as a positive complete point of view that it's here now you know what I you're spearing us Hey I didn't scare you by putting out and sending you home from work and telling you could go home and get paid and all these things and and people are worried to death think about what all this situation is I didn't start I'm telling you the Bible part of it the Bible tells us to be perlis time to be all kind of things happening well here we are all right we don't throw up her hands and quit no because this is the part that was meant to be mine but you say well well then you need to preach to us and tell us about this here tell us about that there and what's over here so what you know so what it's coming that's the best way for me to say it I'm trying to get me and you to see who we are and then you have no fear of what they are saying or trying to do your fear goes away because you realize that hey I'm a part of God I'm not concerned with what the world is doing I hate it because of the worldís situation I hate for those you know hundreds of thousands of people dying you know and all that that's bad I mean that's a bad point and you know but I like what Wade was saying about it the other day and his message there the plagues and things come upon us because we're turning down God's Word right I mean it comes because we turned down God's Word well eating it odd that all at once it fell through Luke or two or three months after all of this started saying the Prophet was wrong and in doing this that in the other than going on and changing it from this part to that part and saying he missed it it's the way and then all at once here comes the plague well I don't think that's accidental now I don't I'm serious I'm not trying to make no doomsday part out of it I'm trying to make the truth out of it to where that we look at the truth of it and say okay well what is the other thing see by Boyle as we was reading out the other day and trying to bring what when the enemy comes in like a flood what we've got the promises we don't have to worry about it we're not promised that sickness won't come upon us but we're promised that we have the promise within us and the Holy Ghost within us that we can ask our Father to take care of these things and he'll do it all right we have that we have the right to pray is enough said that's the that might not mean unto you but it is well if they could take away right to pray we'd be in bad shape yeah but we still have that right to pray and to call upon our Father and he'll come on the scene to do because that's what he's doing he's here now to make not now listen listen to the wording and get it right he's not coming to make himself known that's been down through time in the Old Testament it came to a point of ending the Old Testament what with revealing God right but you know it's hard isn't it that that God walked out in human flesh right the god that was being revealed what was being revealed reveal is to make known our to make manifest it's not that this man that's what I'm trying to get us not to see you know to look at it and think that we're part of the mystery well well we got this over here to be real now now just just find out who you are see who you are and what you're here for well then you can go all the way back into the message see I can stand here now and my mind just runs back 30 40 50 years in trying to get us to see who we are and what we're here for this is not a new thing to me this is 50 years old I mean we've got to tell you and things back there firm back on what about mm and somewhere right around 2000 that we've got from there up to where we are now so if you don't think that I'm telling the truth about it you can go back there and listen we had the others and we wound up being submitted to we had to get rid of them you know and but think about it what do you think now I'm asking you a point where you will get the connection why do you think the prophet was saying when he was saying the bride is part of the mystery you know I mean what do you think about that well I think that I think you're making too much out of us let's see that ain't what I'm looking at I am looking at your flesh and your being or what you are I've never looked that away I've always looked ice that then no matter what people don't I've been through horrible situations with ministers and things that you know ridiculed and done and all kind of thing but I never looked at that person with any hatred whatsoever I never got up and lambasted them from the pulpit and you know instead of a bunch of things and old look at them they've done this that they're so that means guarded or no no no cause see that ain't what am i I'm interested in I don't call that preaching to get up and beat people to death with the gospel I don't call that preaching well the Lord told me to preach is like okay I'm not second nothing that's fine preach it but make sure that he told you what to preach cuz I remember one brother in the message you know and he'd always made a statement and he'd say yeah brother branham told me what to preach well everybody just flocked to him he wound up being one of those seven guys it was supposed to have been the seven thunders back years ago you know okay but anyhow he he's doing so you know I'm like this huh I'm kind of interested in finding out what the story all of it is so I just asked him one day I said what is it that you know that you were told to preach he said hail firing it hot well that's what he told me to preach he told every preacher that he calls he's aprietale firing it hot but not the wrong way for it being Hellfire hot see that's part of the doing but I found out from that that see people were afraid of him because they thought he had some kind of something that the Prophet had told him and in an ordained demon you knowing things and all of that but see I'm not interested in there I'm interested in finding out who I am well what do you mean are you I'm Samuel day uh-huh I Know Who I am do you know who you was before the foundation of the world but remember the real you is the one that was back tyre then you say well I'm not too real me now you're the real you but you just you just got the wrong impersonation you you're thinking about trying to make known that fella that you livin in that body when that ain't what I'm talking about and they what God's talking about it's making known the Word of God bringing the Word of God out into the open to work that you can see what God has been doing all these years and following it down like I said 50 years I've been watching this and seeing things and said Lord no what's it gonna be and see if we've always been been able to have basic answers to questions when people would come along you know what do you think about this what do you think about that it's always been that God gave us some answers to those things that people were questioning all right and my question or my answer to any question is what like you say what is the mind of Christ okay we've got that in simplified form right do we say the mind or crowd one well we didn't know with the money no what is the mind of Christ what does the Prophet say about it the mind of Christ is the baptism of the Holy Ghost not your natural mind but the mind that was in Christ being you will make you a new creature new creation all right so now we know that all right and we know then that what we're doing is we're not trying to build up some kind of a something that hey we've got an image over here and we're trying to make that image now now we are that that's the whole point we're that that's being revealed see then brother Brennan says I lost my mind and now I've received the mind of Christ he said lost my mind he said if you have the mind of Christ and you're a new creation but he says what we need to do is lose our mind quit thinking about this brain quit thinking about those type of things get into thinking about the real thing that's being made known then you can see that your everyday you're being revealed you realize that God is living in you into you know walking into faith it's like he was before and the Prophet said the only difference is the corporal body right see his corporal body was virgin born and talking like that ours wasn't before the rest of it he turned of life if you have eternal life today then that's what we're supposed to be doing to let the world know who we are and what we're here for see if somebody couldn't ask you sir what do you think about this you've been in this message wondering what do you think of well I think it's supposed to do and I don't mean the wrong now I think it's supposed to be this I think it's supposed to be that but what do you hear that message is the revealing of Jesus Christ in you that's what we need to hear that's what brings hope to our soul and being is to realize that just us being born-again Christians is fulfilling God's Word and making known see the only way you can preach the gospel you have to preach what's within you right Minister brother said you have to preach watch within you because there's not you're saying what somebody else says and that won't do no good it's what's something within you that is where the point comes in God told me to preach this and I appreciate that that brings it to the right point because that's what he's doing he's coming he's using you now to think about it we found a great mysterious point in our thoughts as we come down through the Hebrews 11:40 series part that we spin in the one was one where brother Branham says lean not to your own understanding number five they want to pull it up that God is not complete without us now that's something they may not mean anything to you but it certainly means something to me to think that I'm part of what he had before the world and see one of these days we're gonna get on predestination cuz see if you go back in predestination and you stop in foreknowledge that's a wonderful place that's wonderful that's a good place to stop in foreknowledge and think it over but just remember God was a whole lot further than foreknowledge because his foreknowledge was that you was going to be him made manifest in this world that's not just for knowledge that's saying what it is the mystery listen see God is not complete without us alright and see we saw another great point of understanding one what we've been talking on for a little bit the brother branham in the cross the mystery of God revealed since he's part of the mystery she is part of the mystery now he's not complete without you now we covered our the last area life Sunday were spoken word a regional seat and it's I gave you a couple of others word was talking about that you know God wants to make himself known yeah but he wants to do it through me and you he's using this illustration he's using we use the sisters because they are they they you know ain't much difference much old man looking out at her but you know you you're going down to a store with your wife and everybody's looking at her and not lust in at that point but they're looking at her and her dress and clothes and things like that you know and you're walking with your mom you're walking along you know and they're Lynn see they're looking at that and they're saying they something different we'll see that's what I'm talking about that that's what's being revealed God is being revealed in you because whatever he would be doing now he would always have to be doing that so he's trying to make no and the sisters walk alone to see the higher they see the clothes the dress the actions and reactions and the things you know and if they do they say well there's something different about that person well there is something has happened on the inside see that's do it and then the outside its what's displaying the mystery the mystery is that you've realized and listen the mystery is that you realized who you are not if you quit wearing clothes of wrong type of clothes or or quit cutting you hire anything that's great that's wonderful but that's just that can be Oh an act of works and have nothing to do with Christianity who's that Crystal Gayle or whatever her name is that has her that just drags the ground along behind her and all I'm not saying she's not a Christian that's nothing to me I'm just making the point does it make you a Christian because of the hiring of clothes and things like that no it's as you have something that they don't have I don't made a statement the other day you know and I never did finish it up in Vegas it man you goofed on that one well I was trying to explain the back fact of being a Christian and we're supposed to be a Christian no matter where we're at you know 24 hours a day 7 days a week driving and running doing drive the trucks all dingy we're supposed to be doing that and I made that statement I said it wouldn't matter to me she put Merlin Monroe on an island with just you alone what was I saying I was just saying that both Lynne you know what you wouldn't be running around lusting after her then you wouldn't be doing those thing you wouldn't be having problems with it that was the point of running it if you're true Christian if you're true Christmas sure you could look at her and see and know all the things but yet you look back and see if if I could get to her what I've got in me that come into my life and changed me it'll change her that's what I thought Christianity was supposed to be and see our sisters wouldn't even think about it but every day they're displaying Jesus Christ through their lives and things and that's making known God because God is in them now to the point of saying that that you know always no no no no this I've always said it the prostitutes in my day had long hair and long dresses that didn't make the that wouldn't appoint you know he you know it was back there because there was not I don't know how you'd say that was just part of the day in the hour they were living but listen I thought that what Jesus Christ come to do was to make God known is that not the point see he come to make God known all right now and making God known God made him known and I've always said that about the people if you just listen and think what statement is always made if you make God known he'll make you know you just walk in the word of the hour that you've got and try to study that and just be what you're supposed to be we're supposed to be Christians it's not something of trying to reveal because that's the point of what I'm trying to drive to bring down see Jesus when he came he came to make the father known he brought him out in the open that he could be seen then he wasn't concerned about being seen he was concerned about making his father known well why wouldn't it be the same for you and me why would it not be that that this message is not a book of rules as message is not always like this message is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now I hope this keeps adding on to the point of what I'm talking about if it's so close to you that it's within you then he's in you trying to make yourself known again he's trying to make us known God is trying his best to make his children known to the world that's why we don't do is the world we don't run as the world we don't go out of all of the things we do what we do we don't I know in making the decision to where we would run the church the way we're running it now see naturally within my mind becomes thoughts of what other people will think then there was a guy wrote a paper in Gainesville the other day and he said what are we doing he said are we teaching our children that God is not real or you know to do so we're closing their doors well they had a good point you know I mean he had a good point that was the way with state it was a good point but the thing of it is you can't operate under a good point you can say well we ordered just to come to church and we'll get this brother Dale I'm I'm I'm just upset with you because you didn't just say we're going to how churches we're gonna do and all I have well what if you do that and pie some diseases among you then what you don't say that's all I was doing was just complying to the government but now when they start meddling with us and our teachings and our thoughts and our thing then is time then to reveal there's not time to reveal now now is the time to just sit back and wait and see what's going on it's for that role so we're learning what they're doing they're setting up things right now that could be used at any split second and in doing that then we have to be prepared we'll God will take care of it you mean God is going if you know you mean God is wanting to make his children known and then he's going where's he gonna put him right in the midst of the battle right he's going to put his church right in the midst of the battle we're not gonna get a bypass of all things and no troubles and heartaches and things we're not promised that we're promised that there's many afflictions but I like to rest that's true but the Lord lead us out of them all see we have that we have the word that we can call upon our Father in the word to show him that he said these things and believe it what you think he's wanting to do that in it you think he's wanting to kill us off anyway no but he's wanting us to stand up now and just be people or what we're supposed to be help everybody you can do what you can why because that's the Christian attitude okay listen but I want you to just think on this now the bride is part of the mystery and God is now revealing then there's like a quote another night where the Prophet was saying her the other day like you know he said that what is he talking about the well I think up in a minute convenient he's trying to get us to see who we are and what we're doing here and what the prophets say he says when the bride does that realized who she is what should you what did he say he said she'll be an invincible army alright then that's all I'm trying to get us to say that's what I'm that's my purpose is to get us to see who we are and what we're here for we're not here to fight and you know all kind of we're here to be Christians and just to walk in the light of the Lord and listen if the bride now listen to the point now for just a minute on this if the bride is part of the mystery and she must be revealed then now you can see why brother Branham so emphatically states that all God was he poured into Christ all Christ he pours into the church so whatever was there in him being made manifest as he was walking the earth and doing is our example of what a true Christians supposed to be right was the way that Jesus was himself all right then in that then all God was that was what it was there he was in Christ I don't know I was looking this probably 3040 or maybe more than that times that wrote around and we use that very statement all God was he put in the cross all Christ in the church take her back to the Garden of Eden the the threefold purpose all right now if he's not complete without us how could he be the fullness of the Godhead bodily are you listening see without us he's not the fullness you say wait a minute you're DB little in God no I'm saying what's your profit that's saying you think what you want to buy what I'm being in I'm not doing I'm building up God because remember one thing for sure he brought us here we're here to make our father manifest we're not here to make ourselves manifest we're here to make our father manifest and made known and doing it we look back and see that even the prophets message the whole message is a constant I don't mean the word bombardment of it of wrong time but it's a constant in every message that you'll see that he's speaking about what it is to be a Christian and how to be a Christian and what a Christian is supposed to be like we're here now to make our Father known because that's what Jesus was doing he made his father know so all God was he's the fullness of the Godhead bodily why did he pour that over into a church did he leave himself Oh as nothing no way he hen star magnified that's what I've always tried to get people to see that you know that when God passes out when the Holy Ghost goes out then it's not God running out in one of these days he's gonna run out of Holy Ghost angle how no Holy Ghost left to give away I've never believed nothing like that the more he gives away the more it increases the more members of the body of Christ that comes into being into it is more of him being made known and revealed not revealing me and you see that's where it's wrong you think that it's doing it because you look in the Bible like way we talked about the other day listen who was it when the one that went out in the field you know and the servant went after it who was it oh my goodness didn't mean to bring these out but I was thinking about she she comes out in the field and she sees him and she says is that Ellie's our honor it is that Isaac she had been told so much about him she knew exactly what he looked like but she never seen him but she knew what he looked like she didn't have any problem jumping off the camel taking off the wording because she knew who it was that's what God is trying to get me in you to see sure is to see who he is amen was to see who we are you've always heard me make the statement about it if David could whoop a line a giant and a bar and think without the baptism with over the ghost what if he had the new birth man he would he would have took on the whole nation by himself and wouldn't occur it he said bring wrong you know because that he would do but he was that because he knew he had been ordained or anointed way bringing this out you remembered the message ordained to be a proper King and if he was long if he was that until he reached that throne he's not to work he's out to be concerned now once he reached the throne what different situation it because he become capable of being the key old enough but he couldn't have been killed for then and see that's that anointing and that anointing came on Jesus on the river Jordan there to start his ministry he couldn't be killed during that without anointing on him but now when anointing left him in the garden well see you know how I've always thought that that anointing left him to be able to come upon you and me well if it can come upon me and you then we can't pass no way Satan can do anything with us as long as that anointing is with us and what Saul all of us completed once everything is fully made known and everything in order then we could be clear the point of being able to be killed but you can't be killed now cuz you got your gnawing on you you just think about that he's trying to get you to see who you are see the mystery part of the threefold mystery she's part of the threefold man he's in the three form if she's part of him so now go back to what I was saying then all God was he poured into Christ all Christ into the church the fullness do you think I was being received when I've tried my best learned in 1969 and Athens Georgia to explain about that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man but you see the Prophet was saying that was what I was trying to get the people to see the son of man brother Branham is not the son of man he's a son of man he's in the body of Christ making him part of the body of Christ making him part of the fullness of the Godhead bodily yes but the bride has to be the fullness something's got a Halpin Church it came to just wind up with with being this anything something's got to happen let's get a couple of these right here and then we'll quit go ahead to number 12 let's just jump over to that number 12 while they're getting there it's from Chrysler mr. God revealed he said he has showed and revealed an ever top that is in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ hmm the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible now listen and all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been in top and expressing what God's great goal is and now in the last days he has revealed it and showed it and God's help will see it right here this morning what but she's part of the mystery they'll get that and then we'll go to the other so follow me what I'm saying then grafting of the Gentiles is wonderful because that is part of the mystery but there's something there that's more mysterious than just the Gentiles being grafted in it's the mystery of the bride and Christ being one it's you becoming one with your father you've become at one with him now if that be true then look what he says don't serve as we would see Jesus Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight now listen if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifests himself in the last days in other words here we are part of the mystery Son of Man revealing himself in his church in his church right part of the mystery and it's promised to us Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he's identifying himself as he promised much more could we say in these last days as son of man making himself known among his people in the form of his people now I read that for well you know where I'll be going on the next called we'll go through the word in Morphy next services you know changing this form and think of where you can see it's in us I would look making himself known among his people in the form of his people the not Son of God me not son of David was Son of Man the Son of man was the supernatural so we're living in the supernatural ok fullness of the Godhead bodily in his sons and daughters ok let's get the lights 4:16 no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the Godhead bodily among you now no leaven let me take that dish for a minute no leaven among you no ideas or thoughts are contrary doctrines no leaven called living when you add to live in you know it makes rising us you don't do that in the communion bread you make it it doesn't have any bread in eleven in inter ends I see because that's that's Westmead all right no leaven in other words when it comes to a time finally that the bride of Jesus Christ will get rid of all of her ideas and thoughts and wonders about what's going on and settle down and just be what he told us we are and take that and do it see there's your leaven is your ideas or your thoughts or your something that you've come up with well I think it's this way I think I don't have no rights to think what it is no leaven among you the brings the fullness of the Godhead bodily yeah listen see what is this one on the mighty guard unveiled I didn't give him this one okay so don't lose then it was God in them days it was God in a man his son Jesus Christ we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man ordinary human it was God in Christ God in a man the fullness of the Godhead bodily in a man God in a man now it's God in men the fullness of God in the Godhead bodily in his entire Church manifesting our making known the himself fulfilling the word why can't we believe that why can't we believe that we are the body of Jesus Christ and the body follows ahead if you read boards reading them seat over and over your body always follows the head and see in doing that then we'll come out to realize who we are I hope this don't become boring to the church in any point of thinking about it of me trying to express something over and over but I want you to see what you are I want you to see what you are the brother Gary Atkins he said said I see here now that my point he said I can see because God is is revealed in in Jesus Christ I said that's great pressing the brain to yourself when God is revealed in you now you're getting down to heaven understand it what is the new birth then it's revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you of what you are he's making known to you who you are you're part of him and being part of him then he's not complete without us no he'll never leave us because he's United with us in the point to bring us his own life when we realize what we're doing here about that anything I've tried my best to to preach to the ministers of the message and the things you know is what a little bit I could try to get them to see that it's not arguing over this or that or other and that's never been nothing and then you know you know it's finding out who you are really say you mean that bobble is me no no my Bible says Joe we'll see you know how the Prophet says take and put your name and say by His stripes I Samuel dalem heal well now I could read over here and buy your stock Paul is healed but that's no good then won't heal me that heal Paul they didn't heal heal me but when it comes to me reading and putting my name there and see that all of these things is in the battle that's been going on it's not a battle of human wits it's a battle of realizing realization something happens it just clicks and you say you mean that's what it is yes that's what it is that's what he's been trying to get us to see the whole time who we are no no brother Dale he's been trying to get us to see who he is that should have been settled a long time ago now that should have been settled a long time ago when we come into the message and the prophet begin to explain one God and brought it into being in the points and thought man I was elated because I had never seen that way of God being revealed but then one day I see you had dog there was four of us in the car and we'd listened to a tape we had a battery-powered tape recorder Oh Kai I guess budino it was a battery-powered we'll see we'd take the tapes and we play them going to work well it would work good Kahn had eight batteries well you know eight batteries now years ago if there's a dollar piece yeah you still with money you know because doing it well sometimes we do for them didn't get to get the tapes you know I mean the the the batteries can play the tape I said to her many a time from here at adorable and turned that tape layer because it would have enough power to be able to bring forth the voice but it wouldn't have enough power to run the mechanical part of the machine I've said to her many a day and run that thing with a pencil I ain't gonna lose nothing like I know you weren't interested in the word I was interested in the word to hear what that prophet said to hear what he was saying that's why that I'm so emphatic about it like I said I noticed in the last message come on musician last message I was talking about sure little random as a part of this we're not no way in the world trying to leave him out of anything he was the one that brought the message to us well yet he's not the message the Lord Jesus is the message and see being part of the bride then he's part of the mystery okay because he's part of the bride and he's part of the mystery being revealed amen now our part is there we've done 50 years of doing you know this is like they told them in the country overseas it hey you've you've come over here and told us about the Prophet and the things and all that said now tell us what he told and I said something to the brother about it I said that's that means he you know you need to send somebody over there that knows the message you know and let them teach the message because they know the Prophet was a prophet now said I'm the message well it stayed with the same old story you know that won't never work out but listen I hope you'll go and think on these things goes next what I want to do is here these quotes basically we're read around talking about the bride being the fullness of the Godhead bodily and let him sell it tell us these things well if she's part of it and we're talking about her we're making her known when I read the books I'm trying to make brother Branham known you know I'm saying runaround brought this message Paul brought this Peter brought this I'm trying to make them known as to what they do because that's giving them their right place it's making them known well then I said wanna go then if we make him known you make us know I'm concerned about that boy less than what we go that's a sing that course Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus Jesus be the Lord of all the keen arms my heart whoa Jesus I surrender all to you Jesus I surrender all oh Jesus I surrender the kingdom he might have a name just think about it Jesus we've spent all of our life thinking that God was trying to make himself known and that's true but we didn't see that he had a mystery in his mind he had something in his mind that goes back so far us back past all mankind and everything go back into his mind and then we get into that and see that right back there so they said one day they'll preach predestination because when you get back to the earth it's not just for knowledge see we go to for knowledge that's wonderful cuz that's predestination God predestined a prize for knowledge but what does he predestinate himself he's waiting on you and me to just realize who we are and what we're doing here you'll take care of the rest of this the kingdom father we thank you Lord for this day in your love and to us when we pray then what we said that people on the internet outside and all here and that we can all come to a realization of realizing one thing Lord that you're trying your best to make us known and Lord the Prophet is there's one of the quotes we had there he said we keep turning it down we turned down you trying to make yourself known in us because it's not us anyway it's you living in us but just have your way be with us a wheat of natural meal and back this afternoon we've away dizzy ministers and that's your grace and love me with each one in Jesus name one o'clock [Music]
