«  38       †          He's omnipresent because He's omniscient; omniscient because He's omnipresent. Therefore, by His foreknowledge... Now, He can't be just like the wind over the earth, because He is a Being. He just isn't a myth. He's a Being. He dwells. He even dwells in a house. He dwells in a place called Heaven. And therefore, by His omni-, being omnipresent; being omniscient, knowing all things, then He is omnipresent because He knows all things.

7A) 57-0307  GOD.KEEPS.HIS.WORD.2_  PHOENIX.AZ  THURSDAY_
«  E-39       †        Every time the people are gathered together at the end of the road, at a junction, God sends a true prophet, and the devil sends a false prophet. And I said, "Brother Moore, we need a prophet." I wanted to see what he said. He looked at me a little bit. I said, "And we got a true Prophet. And that true Prophet is the Holy Ghost. He is a spiritual Being. God sent the Holy Ghost to lead the church."

13) 64-0705  THE.MASTERPIECE_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  V-4 N-7  
«  20       †          If it be the will of God, then, I want to speak on the Seven Trumpets. And that'll be about a eight-day service, and we won't be here at the tabernacle, perhaps. We try to get an auditorium here.
21    Now I never thought, of this new auditorium just being built up here, it's exactly where I saw Jesus the first time in vision. Now it's built, auditorium built right over the same spot. I went right there the other day, to look. When I looked and seen Him looking towards the east, you remember hearing me tell it, when I was out there praying for my father; a--a little boy, just a boy preacher. That's where I saw Him. Step, looking at Him; He's had His head turned sideways from me. I kept walking around, clearing my throat, in a broom-sedge field. And I kept watching, and He never did turn. Then I called His Name, "Jesus." And He turned around, held His arms out, and that's all I remembered until daylight....

can see if we just know how to look because that's what we're talking about all right good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn your scriptures turn to John 1 and then we'll go to John 14 John 1 and then the John 14 try to continue at our own from this past Sunday we're on the series now of I just titled it one God series and will I part 1 part 2 whatever you know as we go along in a subtitle and our subtitle this past Sunday was second title and what you want to call it how real is your God that was the question we were asking how real is your God we'll get onto one in a little bit tonight but remember now this coming Saturday will be Bible study 6 o'clock coming be with us and in all endeavors have a good time in the Lord and also remember now the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday of July it'll be at brother Hmong Goris and that'll be let's see the third Saturday be the 15th get wage going up to brother Jim Humes on the 14th so we'll have a lot of traveling because I guess rounding back that's okay we'll try to continue right any other announcements I know you have you done seen the picture it's just a Mary's little little baby and we thank God for it being everything being all right and take you here over because you know with her and the baby to pray that the Lord would read okay father we thank you for this day and your grace Lord thank you that all things that we could be speaking about we can rejoice in you to think about the day in the hour that we're living in the time that you have allowed us to be able to come to an understanding that mankind has never before understood because they've always sought after some way to understand you and to make you out of what you are and what your being but yet you have shown yourself unto us through the opening of the word here in the last days we thank you we ask you to just have your way remember somewhere away traveling tonight Joyce and Danny in them and many others it announced that they'll be gone for the weekends and time and just this you just be with each and every one take care of give a safe journey and bring us all back together and you because that's our desire we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you now in Jesus name you mean you'd like to turn there to us John one we use this this past Sunday we'll go from one to five and then we jump to verse 18 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him I notice what it I mean this is where I read you're talking about word word word now it says him me trying to make it more real personal all things were made by him who the word and without him was not anything made that was made now we know it we're all made by Jesus Christ right Ephesians 3:9 cautions 1 John 1 a bruised one all the scriptures saying Jesus Christ not Jesus the flesh Jesus the Christ is the Creator God all right and him was life and the life was a lot of men and the light shines in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there's no way the darkness can understand God it first takes light light brother Louie's speaking on it here a few weeks ago you know it first takes light to have an understanding then we can talk about it alright verse 18 says no man has seen God at any time but I like this the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father he hath declared him or brought him out in other words unveiled him revealed him brought him out will now remember see if we can read one scripture no man has seen God see God in the same God me it said that we're in verse chapter 14 verse 9 jesus said unto Him have I been sold on the word Philip saith unto Him Lord show us the father that it's a father satisfies us jesus said unto Him have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me Philip he said have seen me has seen the father no oh here he said you you can't see God now he's saying if you've seen him you say God all right he's declaring him right he's bringing him out he's revealing him okay but you'd be able to see him through that way all right now leave us now not that I am in the father and the father in me the works did I the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me what now watch our else believe me for the very works sake if you don't want to believe it just look around and see what's taking place at least you can believe it from that right so you can be seen as Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I don't want to back up too far but I want to us to keep the thought because the thought is still built even though I'll subtitle it different for a couple of messages but it still how real is your God how real is your god to all mankind they've always wanted some way to see God they went crazy as the Prophet said trying to write about him trying to think about him but you mean to tell me now that there is a great eternal God as we covered Sunday that has to be greater than anything we can see real because he made it that's simple terminology right so you you can go and get metal that is so hard until you know there's impossible even penetrate it with other objects or something because it's so hard but yet it had to have a creator and the creator had to be greater than the product because if not what kind of a God do you have is that simple is that simple thinking some simple-minded I have a 9th grade education I can't come up with a great theological things and say them I just say what I think for me to think about God has always been the greatest opportunity that you could think of in life to think that God would in this life days reveal himself under a group of people that we could realize he's real we could realize that he is so real that he's a being not like a myth or our floating around that we could even know his name but his name is Jesus and that we can see him or what it looks like maybe not him but what he looks like all by way of God sending a prophet for you and I to understand the Word of God all right you know that Rhett Dyer would be enough to rejoice till midnight to think about those little things to know that he's real they know he's a being didn't know his name and to be able to see what he looked like and remember they always say your prophet said and when I say it that way because you're the ones claiming he's a prophet I don't have no problems really I'm quoting that he is and always a study that is the point is is you claim him to be a prophet so why would we be quoting from somebody else or somebody else's ideas I remember an incident happened years ago here and some of them went to a church and they came back and one of the brothers especially we're talking about well the brother said so-and-so about God and said God is just floating around the Miller I said but that ain't right I said he's a being well he said it to him I said well why didn't he say to him he was saying brother Branham was saying it well it's all right do you to say what you want to but then when you say brother Branham said it I want to read it now I'm not liking what we're talking about news talking about it Sunday and wage we're talking about it we've been talking about you don't have to quote me everything you just tell me something I'll tell you where it's right or not from my own experience where were you what were you then that goes back to the who were used idea he said well that silly it is silly my whole point is the Bible tells us the truth and it said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free that does not say you shall know about truth till people come along and they bring up all kind of of Bibles and new ones and it's not the other one because they're not set on the King James being right if they believe it's right why when they come up with more see I just have to believe that and just leave it well you don't have enough education to be able to understand these other translations well there's no problem if they all reveal the same then I want no problem to see it and understanding it all right now but to get to the thoughts how real is your God is it capable of or is he capable of revealing himself to where mankind can understand him and I thought right around it I blues Christ mister God revealed he's talking about the new birth and thing and he said he could be revealed to the most illiterate person we see we think what they can't understand that because they're illiterate all of the shop was very literate as far as because I mean literate is for human educational ability because if you don't have a high school diploma you know I've got one but if you don't have one of those then you're considered illiterate and now high school diploma is almost illiterate you know if you don't have more than that you ain't going to get a good job you know but think about it how real is your God now we use this statement Sunday talking about that the Prophet said one day and made an outstanding statement on who is this Melchizedek when he said in the beginning but before the eternal so you can't do that you can't go back Pais that well on that message we'll get back to it probably a little later on that message he talks about going back into the mind of God then we talked about Sunday worth it and read the scriptures are on second Corinthians where it tells about Paul said he was taken up to the third heaven and saw things that were not lawful to speak off but right and said he went to the first heaven did he believe that if I went to the third well how about it is it more heavens besides us or whatever I don't know none of my business I'm just saying the Bible tells me there's that many right the prophet verifies there's that many so then we ought to be able to listen and think about the great eternal God is what I was trying to get at Sunday - you see our thoughts and ideas of an eternal God or a self existing one it's just like in the old quote brother Branham and say there was no ire there was no star there was no dish none of that you know existing well we just think that God is none existing and the best we can say is he's the spirit we got up into the message are talking about Sunday where the prophet calls himself existing and calls him Ella him and that's the best word or the only word mankind can use to define the self existing one is to say hello him right and then in doing that we can think about back before the world that he was real well it's just a spirit so I guess you means he's mister spirit season that's where somebody like me coming along and you don't like me because see if you say well God is just a spirit is well he made my answer man sister spirit one of the probably said in like mental spiritual he said he made him a spiritual being you don't read them to you he'll read where he said God was the great Jehovah dwelling alone nothing existed with him yet it was real my elder brother brother nobody can understand them great supernatural timing cause even the great scholars thank you're not trying to make him harder when Jesus came he walked up on the shores of Galilee and talked to a bunch of little fishermen they were ignorant unlearned before he ever went to the high priest why because he knew that only one is believing and he knew the high priest went on believing right I real we think that he he come this way did he become real he came this way to show how real he is we'll get back to it later when we talk about the attributes of God I've made that statement for 40 years that God never gained one attribute by coming into the world and doing all he's done he had all those attributes in him when he was self existing is that true well why would we think about attribute so being any other than the fact that they could dwell with him but yet he could be self existing nothing didn't exist with him but in that part dark he says there's a great supernatural being Jehovah God that second from which is an answer on Genesis he said Abraham you remember that then Abraham seen God many times they said one day he saw him as milk etc then wade bringing out you if you're doing twice as much as early put that same example and you'll follow into what I'm thinking about put that same example he met him here he met him here he met him here he met him here within he seen Moses met him here let him hear let him hear then he seen think about that is their prophet in the last days we talked about do you seen God in many forms appeared too many times in many forms in many ways why but one day he's seen you do you believe he's seen you I mean at least we're to be able to get anchored down on that and whether or not we believe he's seeing if short saved me a lot of trouble if you take that and believe it but they don't know they prove it to you we follow the prophets message and don't worry about it what about getting over to a place that we begin to talk about we talk about the self existing one and that that self existing one was the great eternal God real not just the spirit before the world before anything I mean do you think it was just fun there's nothing and then some way you begin to farm to do well you know that a much further along sorry then the evolution theory that somehow they wound up being a Polliwog and the Polliwog later over on one side for so many millions of years and growing arm he turned over on the other side like so many million groats another arm to use it you think like that that's the way I think what's the difference in an evolution of theory if you to take your theory of just nothing remember whatever you want to think about we live in life light and matter there's a fourth dimension above that which is demons spirits TVs proves it and tons of because it just turned it on higher division I never didn't understand I or limb people no John Wayne movies it that used to love so much and call them horses and all within that one little wire running in the back of that TV I couldn't comprehend that but what about it you see what I believe now listen here's what I believe alright I believe of how real you can think God is now he was that before anything ever existed come on we live in an atmosphere and it's called heaven above us right that's it's the human terminology right the heavens it just means simply up above within words the second third what he'll God himself existed in the third dimension our third heaven what were the words or terminologies third heaven to be scriptural you don't believe he was real in that situation you're not listening and thinking about what I'm getting at if there is a third heaven they polish all things then there was something dark to see is that simple you know I mean he said he saw things that were not lawful to speak of it he saw something what if he went at work God was before the world or anything ever existed we realized we're held in a frame of the world and all of the planets and the stars is just one heaven it's not that you go out so many stars and you get out to face the moon and there's another heaven this is one you call it atmosphere heavens place or whatever and it contained all of the planets all of the moons all of the stars is in this dimensional situation or whatever you want to call it a life light and matter right but what about two more heavens above there you said well so brother there you're trying to get us to believe that God is real that he was back there as himself I said that's exactly what I'm trying to do I'm trying to believe it myself not to say that you had to wait until he came in human flesh to be able to believe that he comes become real like I've told you over and over and over people don't like me because of that when I say son of God not eternal son ships with the son of God was the logos the word Jesus Christ that created all things back dark where to get the material to build it so you're not thinking about a third dimension you're talking about this well as over here and maybe live the hires of there you ever thought about this whole universe is one mass and it could be called one heaven one place what about God dwelling in a certain place is your God real enough to be able to live in a dimensional situation whatever you want call it and be so real until they could have been a world just like this world and could still be a world just like this world there applies to all of these heavens and I am NOT talking about an extraterrestrial beings or whatever you call it I don't believe in you you don't believe it some people if not the only planet no and I'll sell it like this to show you why I don't if there is anybody on Mars and living there they need a savior we need to get to Mars to tell them about Jesus Christ not going to try to go live come on folks you're going to figure out one big day what I've taught you for 50 years right here is the center of the universe Bible says it where there's your home's coming down upon this earth am i right so here's the center of the universe now we're just looks back this is where God lived this is where he's condescended down to what could it be could it be before anything ever existed in this dimensional forms that we look at out of this universe anything that could be a a place that he was living and that he was real per thought he's just it's just nothing and then it start with like brother branham said you say well you got a Polliwog bird into Polliwog come from right when we evolved from this word did the Polliwog come from remember what he said about it true he said - you better believe in that and said you better believe in a male and a female he said because they had to reproduce to make another Paliwal that's just putting it my language ok he said what are you talking about I'm talking about a real God I wish I had the education the terminology is the things to do to express it but what about the self existing God we existed totally alone you're going to strike it one of these days and you're going to find out something you're going to find out when the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy was before back when he was self existent they might have been something going on in the third heaven if you want to call it that whatever terms you want to use they might have been something going on before all of this started here you might find out when these days this is just a natural part of it remember you've got to have a negative make a picture not just have a negative yourself existing one who existed alone when there was nothing but by being able to let's say I wish I could find that those jobs got it I'll try to get it one day where these people is arguing over how real is God he is and the man done a good job because his point was they don't need talking about God being real there's no argument there there's no argument about God being real he said how can you prove it I'm looking at it are you real and there's no arguing about whether he was real or not because he had two creators so out goes that idea but now think about it the self existing one dwelt alone the Prophet said with his attributes brother Dale I didn't believe you believe in pre existence I believe in pre existence of eternal life I've always thought it that away I certainly flatly believe in the pre existence of eternal God I just don't believe in pre existence of mankind as we know mankind as we know mankind or even pre existence I don't believe it was something I find us running around as little identities running around up in heaven somewhere not believing in God existed alone he was somewhere why can't you believe he was at a place a real come on see I'm trying to anchor it to where your your human mind can't argue the point if there is a third dimension and there was something there it could not be told us then that's greater than where we are now you agree but if that was where God was here just just eat I just cringe where the day of course y'all know why you cringe because that old Catholic Baptist Methodist prosper Protestantism whatever isms and random ezrin's you know what I mean by that don't you I mean all the man's ideas he's always had God at something the way all thought you under they don't want him down here they don't want to think about a God that knows ever moved you make ever thought I was looking at him today Loretta Brennan said he knows ever thought it's you ever had now let me go one more step because I don't think he's arguing he knows the thoughtful you think yeah about that see that's the way my god gets griller my God gets greater whatever I try to limit into a space when I look at him he just gets greater geez goes out of that space you know we need to know this simple thing we need to know about salvation how can you be saved if you don't know what God is how can you be saved if you don't know God is real how can you be saved if you don't know the name of God cause according to my Bible there's only one nine given whereby man must be safe and that's Jesus if you think that is confusing the children sitting here understanding better what I'm saying to them and them - sleep and looking at books and drawing and everything else go talk to them sometimes and see what they got to say about you might want to listen to they might could tell you something now let's go on the end of this talk then now remember until I bring it down and say we have moved down into time or anything like that don't get your mind into anything dire just stay with me but I know we got another message at least we don't have to stay back in the beginning before the eternal to comprehend eternity to comprehend that God is real and to see him as a real person but random I know what he says and gets confusing to the mind he talks about the new birth and he said it's a person of Jesus Christ who comes and lives in you were then we're then he's in your soul by the new bar the very person the very being of Almighty God is living in you yeah but he was running the world oh that's nice I don't do that for the kids I do it with old age the old heads are things they knew all of us going home after 50 years you're still wondering about I'm talking to the Internet's never you're still wanders what's the matter with it God gave us 50 years after taking the profit off this thing for what reason where we could all get old enough to die just to clear your head oh is this little bit that's how we believe it I thought Abraham was 100 when he got his change so you know what there's a plea to just closer to changing Leon all right listen do you believe that God is a person do you believe in to be a person then how real is it like I said are we afraid with the president some God coming when I'm human I try to talk him in and try to be human cuz it's what we are I've heard people say you know that brother branham was given an altar calling like I said they didn't want to go to people so I wasn't want to go up in front of him what you got something you afraid would be brought out in the open it is that right if not why wouldn't you understand English president won't call his name but a manager in Atlanta Georgia one not preaching and he was bringing out that God was just revealing everything dire that he knew the people and whatever thing is you know what I said in the service is over I shook his hand I said in Georgia message I said but don't you ever be afraid to tell me what God says I am senator st. I said don't you ever be afraid to tell me I see because I want to know I know I make statements and feel it before I said I'd never worry about a thought that I ever had for my wife to know all of them Thomas I don't want my wife know every one of my talks well you got dirty thoughts when you want her to know him well I thought about it this morning I thought you were in here seeking went down what is the state when I make after then as long as she hears the life stop and I have I made that wrong about her you tell me I never thought wrong about my wife you just a liar that's just blunt as can be wife or husband don't tell me joke I just call you a liar cause you're healing ain't you if you tell me you ain't never had no thoughts I won't tell you we're good cause you ain't human but you get the point I don't mind my wife knowing anything about myself as long as he hears the livestock stop running how much I love her and what I cherish her honor her why wouldn't you want God to know your thoughts you know the reason I want him to know my thoughts where I can repent of them and get rid of it is that not right would you not want a clean slate between you and the Lord are you afraid of the personality of God are you afraid now listen come on hey I'm human I'm human these brothers said I Tara brother branham and him telling all of their thoughts and I'm here what I tell her said Lord wife it's like clean for he gets to me but it wouldn't bother me a bit for him to say or anybody to say the deal you thought so-and-so a while ago that's right I said did you hear the lifestyle I had the last thing I tell my Lord and Savior because I love you I love you I won't even know that the prairie green told it one time said bread around told him said brother Perry he said if you ever feel the president's the Lord close to you he said tell him I love him he wanted God to know he loved him don't you well why would you be afraid of a person or something real I mean you're afraid to come to church that I might call out your sin or somebody else might come in and cultures are you afraid of that why do you not want your sins under the blood maybe you like it I listen to run around him one day and I heard him to make this statement about that man that fell over him every demon and I'll break it fell over his feet you remember the life to that story Goethe Branham said he didn't want to get rid of that spirit he loved it study your message you'll find out he said he didn't want to get rid of that spirit he said that spirit never went off at him he just went under control maybe you love that person you are and going to be in the presence of a living God ain't going to get through now eaglehorn back I try but I hope you're listening to an honest person talking from an honest heart to you and to believing that God is real and there's more real than all your thoughts that you could ever have but you were to think about envision like that you sure want him on the scene when a racks taking blood right you own him on the scene when you're lost in the woods you want him on the scene when things are going wrong and you're hurting right but you only don't want even harder to get rid of something there whether you sell or don't don't come too far into my houses come inside the door I'm quoting read around them doors and doors if we say come in so far but don't you come in the rest of my home we blend it with how real is a person we spend a lot of time emphasizing to prove that the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is correct for the water baptism and what is our emphasis upon that then we don't believe in three persons Blessed Trinity because the person the personality personality is an individual individual is a person so if you got a person you're coming back to one we don't believe in the Trinitarian concept because at least we can see that much that he's a person is how real is he let's pick up a few quotes and read them and go as far as we can go would take up chandi couple minor rapture takes place we'll finish this an eternity don't we'll see you Sunday some of you a lot of going on I totally wanted the other day when it won't come on that I'm going to be going this right I'm gonna be going that way only but I look around I said maybe we need to just shut down and go with it no problem let's go to a number let's go to number three brothers to start from there how real is your God then watching no don't let it get to this is from the message the dedication in building a dedicating built of building to the Lord it's a path well I believe in a measure and listen to it that God is omnipresent in other words I think we about him being on the present God is omnipresent him being omniscient makes him omnipresent omniscient means you know all things I'm the present means you're personally present in all things you understand what I'm getting it omnipresent means that you're present everywhere is that I'm the present means your president so if God is just a floating spirit he can be everywhere no what is he saying God is omnipresent him being omniscient which means he knows everything makes him omnipresent now I defined that like this as far as I know there's no spaceships going to the moon right now you know so there's a couple of guys up there all that God's dealing with in couple of geysers up there I don't know how many is up there whatever did none of my business I'm just making a point you don't have to be on Mars because everybody on Mars we understand when he's omniscient means he knows to be wherever he needs to be good listen and watch it being omniscient makes him under pressure if God is omnipresent just like the atmosphere then he's a myth that's pretty strong talking in the most the illusions that learn you don't understand his Bible he said but I know the God of the Bible listen if God is omnipresent just like the atmosphere then he's a myth see the reason just ever were floating he's not that away what the God is a person therefore he has to have a certain place that he dwells and he's omnipresent by being omniscient therefore if he is everywhere because being omniscient and he knows everything therefore he knows everything he knows what's going on at every place but God Himself dwells in a certain place there for him being infinite and a word infinite cannot be broken down into any word by any language I love that you can't define infinite that's what he's saying in no language can you define infinite watching the red for the is infinities I guess we pronounce that it's from our own and God is infinite now watching and if I would try to make one quote tation what infinate means now watching your profit is going to try to define something and he said no language can define are you listening when they say we will figure out he was a prophet if I would try to make one quotation what infinite means that would be that a hundred million years before the world was ever formed the infant God knew ever FLE that would ever be on the earth and old ever time he bad his eye each to them that doesn't even start high of what it means to be infinite he said therefore God being infinite and omniscient now he believes God being infinite right he tried to define infinite there's no way to define infinite but he believes God is infinite therefore God being infinite and omniscient he knows all things he knows everything that's going on at all places at all times but he himself is a person dwelling in one place therefore he could we could call him omniscient now he's a person how real then is a person go ahead let's see yeah we read then let's read this one called we read it last week we'll go to number three a which is second Corinthians 12 into I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago within the body I cannot tell see to understand what was taken blood but around him when he goes beyond the curtain of time he said basically the same time he said I was in body or out of body of water go wait how can you define it you laying here need up here whether in body I cannot tell or whether out a body I cannot tell God knoweth such in one caught up to the third heaven and saw things remember the rest of screws you and you couldn't even speak up so in the third heaven God is real you think's up there in the third heaven well I don't see it you don't want to see it because you're afraid of it I'm sorry maybe that's the Lord or maybe it's me either one of them is right why would you want to be afraid of God I know there's a supernatural part about it for folks I've experienced I don't have to worry about it I've told you over the years what God's done and said and things like that I don't have to worry about it I know he's real and I know the feeling and I know the thing and I know the human elements of us is fear that's why he always in the Bible when he would come to man what'd he say you know we're understood after all of the thousands of times did he come in the presence of that being he said it still makes you afraid but I said don't get into that you know we're not afraid ain't talking about not being afraid ain't talking about unsensible think I'm dumb at sensible why wouldn't you want God close to you you're trying to hide your life you've never got to the place of what I'm saying my emphases were talking about my wife I don't care if she here in my life stop I don't care what God would bring up before me if he just remembers at the end of it I said Father forgive me that's the thing I want him to remember that you that's how really is to me when you get in something happening in your life is quick to be snapped away from you whatever you ain't got time brother browning said to pray you ain't got time to pray it out you ain't got time to try to figure out whether you've got any sin that needs to be done you better start speaking the word you better start believing but what about him do you believe he's a person that dwells in a place I'm going to read you one over here in this a minute okay they can pull it young - go ahead brother Joe and pull number seven he's taking the things that are to be now remember what we're saying over here God dwells in a place where is he dwelled Paul talking with third heaven where is he'd well he's on knit I'm the president because he's omniscient omniscient because he's on the pressure therefore by his foreknowledge now he can't be just like the wind over the earth because he's a being he just isn't a myth remember what we're going to go if it's just out of this floating around it's a myth you got to find that person it's just hidden the myth he's a being and he dwells even dwells in a house he dwells in a place called heaven all said he went to the third heaven why does the Bible say that when Jesus resurrected and he's young the one that reached immortality and that's Bible you say all you want to he said with him Old Testament Saints when they went up with Jesus how far did it go to what heaven did they go and stop now quote right around him when he went beyond the curtain of time he said I want to see Jesus he said you can't see him why he says he's up a higher another heaven just one I'm differed with the brothers about the Old Testament Saints in the way they're doing that's all hind forget all that that's just just talk about him being real and see how really really is even dwells in the place a house he dwells in a place called heaven yeah but brother Dale I kept my eye he said what's the future home is it not true in the future home that he's going to build before us is that not true you agree with that but here's your home we don't have anything to do with building it right is that right because he's done gone to build it hey he went up come right back down in here where's you working from right here but forget that going with the rest of it he says there's a river running true he says his byways and his way he says his houses he said if you get there and said you her old bread around him down by the river in a little old log cabin did you hear him sing hymns and what do you say blower he made it if the future home is real which one of the heavens is at and you say well it's the third or you can say it's the second he say what's going to that all right I'm just trying to get a point God doesn't just float in the air the Bible City walks in the fiery places the Bible said he travels throughout the land and in depth and it hide my Bible said he was in the fiery furnace the three Hebrew children he walks in those places he's real he's your God real or is he just a thought but I didn't I never thought it was required of anything he can drop back now we'll pick up go to number four let's pick up read a little bit and look like I know I won't get through I'm glad Adela get through it wasn't so from the beginning that God is omnipotent which means he knows all time right God is omnipresent which it means he can be everywhere he wants to by being omniscient makes him on the president and he knows all things because God could not be just like the air is because God has a dwelling place God is not a myth God is a being God Jesus he God pronoun he's a being therefore he's omniscient he's omnipresent he's omnipotent in His infinite and to be infinite it comes through a word infinite which there is no limit his eternal eternal is like a ring it goes and around and you're trying to find where it began to where it ends there is no beginning or ending to it he's a beating he's a beating go ahead number five adoption 1960 but being infinite then he knows all things knowing every time an at-bat since I know whatever bumblebee where he goes into the comb to get his honey he knows every Sparrow that sits in the tree he knows every thoughts ever thought that's in your mind and like I said I believe he knows it for you everything you know now that day I said I'll bet they look down too much a lot if you didn't know your thoughts who you think them then who is he we can pull things over on him every once in a while you know why they won't for Trinitarian concept go somewhere between Father Son and Holy Ghost maybe my life gets lost we want the Father to intercede with this and this an energy for that and well if it's over yes then with all that which we grab Mary and put her in the middle just in case we need a little more and once they do it now brother branham and put him down come on they believe he was God they was praying to it they were baptizing in his name or this reckon they are now he knows every thought they send your mind because he's infant enough that is he not only is he infinite he's omniscient he knows everything but he's a beating God is a being and out of this being begin to form bring forth these a being a person Oh ed number six we read that one that which one we were at you know number whoever number six and he's talking he said and God is a being God's not like you're like the air if he would this is why I love the Prophet he don't leave you no grounds to stand on I feel a little just Center oh I got him because he didn't quote this word and he's off over here and his power this is not according to that the land says that if he's a educated sensible man he's got enough sense to know I said that right if he's got any sense at all he knows the man knows what he's talking about brother Moke said what do you believe on one god I said God in three persons he said that's as much Trinitarian as anything else I said explain yourself brother he said cause a person of the personality personality the individual individual persons you got three God just like the rest I didn't get mad I didn't get to say nothing I looked at him when I said I don't believe that anymore why because I had enough sense to know the man had me our common words are saying nailed to the wall that I couldn't move oh I could have argued with him that God helps God not like you're like the air if he would you would never have to seek the Holy Ghost it would be in you because he filled all faiths and things God's omnipresent sure I'll be an omniscient no nothing but God has a dwelling place because he is a being exactly right and God dwells with social under the shed blood of his son in that alone not in your denominations we don't read the other one let's read it again number seven things that are to be he's omnipresent because he's omniscient omniscient because he's on president therefore by his foreknowledge now he can't be just like the wind over the earth because he is a being he just isn't a myth he's a being he dwells even dwells in the house he dwells in a place called heaven and therefore by he is omniscient being omnipresent being omniscient I'm nothing being unpleasant I miss knowing all things then he's omnipresent because he knows all the things let me continue at least a second talk how real your God is and remember the point that I'm saying is it by way of God sending a messenger to us in the last days do we understand these times we can understand that he was real we can understand he was a place that he dwells we can understand this even in heaven we can understand that he's not like the wind we can understand it he's not a me up there a thought of our mind we can understand all those signs one because God has delivered to us a prophet fifty years were eNOS fifty years I've been screaming and hollering this to the people that would listen why has everybody else run out of something to preach and then they start on all this junk stuff and they get on to it right now I'm just getting started what about knowing that your God is real no I need to being knowing he dwells in a place knowing that he was in a place before any other place ever come into existence or do you think he was just floating through there when I guess you're saying just I don't know what to do I do they said the other day even the thinker's got better Simpson had like weight said spend II think are setting their you wondering worse closer to heaven yeah at least he's thinking people in this message over the way they say we don't want them we don't want to know them deep time we get confused do we know them see ocean and seventy weeks of Daniel and all them like we get all confused honey don't worry about it there's more than confused much more confusion got to do it I'm trying to get rid of confusion to talk to you about a real God and how did we talk about it what about illiterate people and I mean that was all love and respect educated people in this message but human beings that we can't think about God being real yet we think we're real we can't think about a heaven and a heavenly place we had exists all around us we can't think about his name you remember when you was in the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Catholics and cetera and so I'd ask you what's his name you said Jesus and folks come on I'm sorry we know no more about God at that time than a Hottentot in Africa knows about an Egyptian not if you know your story there ain't no Egyptian not so you get that one yet we say his name is Jesus I tried my best explaining it wasn't Jes us that was lost in the ages they still called in Jesus the Catholics still call him Jesus everybody calls in Jesus but who do they believe he is the second person of the Trinity now you got two persons then you got two persons you got two god which one's the greatest come on I know their doctrine God in three persons Blessed Trinity co-equal and coeternal now how can you have a son go evil with the father when the son has a beginning but we said we already know the name of Jesus would it have to be restored down in ages or do we define the Bible let alone the Prophet to say it didn't need to be restored what they need to be restored who Jesus is not how to pronounce it what's his name but a Brenham says everything is named Jesus where it's the only name that God ever had it's the message of doctrine the only name God everything that we want to find some new nothing we will find something let's run out this name first I only asked this one simple question for 50 years what if it's not another name that we're looking for but a deeper revelation of the name of Jesus that's all I've ever asked well you got to remember one time the father is still in glory he may be the third heaven we haven't learned anything about him Co we're learning about the son then what did the Sun Shine I didn't come to speak about myself I come to tell you about my father will flicker one of these days the scripture is right when it says no man has seen the father I don't believe when we get up to heaven there's gonna be a little place over here for the father little place here for the son a little place over here for the Holy Ghost do you know I believe we're going to see Jesus and nobody is so will not run out this name first God's name is Jesus Christ I wish you could look at the stack let on my dash for that it just makes that statement what a neat computer run Jesus Christ emergency how many times wrote around said Jesus Christ remember Jesus the flesh man never created all things Jesus the Christ is the creator of all things the flesh man never created anything about it and his name is Jesus there's no name under heaven whereby men must be saved in the name of Jesus Christ what about it do you believe that there was a self-existing God that existed along the Eddy was a being you believe that and that being his name is Jesus and he stood here on earth and said if you sing me Philip he said you seen the father he said because I my father won you know what I love about the way the word is written new because when he come over to the ascension he raised up and Marie talked to everyone decided he said don't touch me I'm not yet ascended the what'd he say I go to my father and your father I go to my god and your God that's why we're missed Jesus right now and if there's a name change whatever it'll be we don't worry about it go will be missed whatever it is think about it now let's take this for a minute give me give me a little bit for nought and look you don't you think you could see she see God no man has seen God at any time that's probable then all of it says the only begotten has declared him brought him out in the open in other words showed what he looked like now what does your God look like well if he's just a floating blob out there he's just a floating blob is he's an elephant he's an elephant why does he look like there was a day when you said that the people and they just about run you out of the building right to think about somebody to say they'd seen God and emphatically stating it okay so I don't forget this I want this statement laid right here let her brand him I quoted it somebody the other day little ol brother branham said when that picture of the halo that's over his head is hanging in Washington DC he said for you to see that picture is more real and if you were standing there looking at he said because the cameras I won't catch psychology right are you getting a little second for you to pick up that picture that you've carry well no and see right around his picture with a halo part for you to see that and hold that picture is more real than it would be if you were standing there that day because if we were standing there that day something supernatural could take place and deceive you but that camera don't take supernatural in the right now I say one more then I'll pull up another for you to see that hail that lot at an Arizona that made the picture of the head of Christ you see that of a camera laid by a camera is more real than if you'd have been standing right there when it went up why because Satan could impersonate when a camera takes a picture it has to have something to strike the negative so don't forget that dog it will be valuable in just a minute or two you can see how real God really is he said well we've never seen this or never seen that have you ever seen Jesus read that not in a picture not a star not innovation no have you the visionaries I'd really think you seen Jesus but now what if your prophet said that Hoffman's picture was the closest to the way Jesus looked and your Jesus looked like some hideous you know I'm going to say you didn't see that by the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit I'm going to show one person a vision of Jesus and him being an old man or old their sir warped up twisted rubber and said you were to go to the Vatican and see what you got hanging that they say that's what Jesus looks like you need those clothes what about your prophet all of you or to know these things go to number 12 brothers in this hurry the message called faith 1953 he's talking about brother Bosworth and all of the things and there's burning in my heart knowing that something God had promised on the opening of the power and I'm waiting now for him which I believe will appear to me visible I set with reverence I'm seen in class 53 of course it was a vision and remember that remember what he seen with a vision he was standing in the IRA one night I stood you remember about his daddy in the time even broken extraord putting this is a mouth and shoot it looked again surely this is not a vision but surely this is not vision I stood during the broom stage you're looking I've been praying all night and I looked again and I seen him with his foot like that and his hands folded looking towards the east and I walked around this way and cleared my throat and when he looked around and when he looked around at me raised up his arm I fainted and didn't come to till the next morning I have an idea what he looks like and I've been feeling for the last few months that I'll see him again here pretty soon that he'll reveal again his something that's fixing to come I remember what I asked you to remember what I go if I remember that ask you remember something about Abraham what was it asking you to say about a brown Abraham seeing God in visions and we haven't seen God in drink and it was just kept seeing God within one day he seen melchester dick Moses his weight was bringing up seeing him here standing here seen him with a burning bush then one day he told him and said I want to see you he's go standing in the rock and we walked by he saw the back part of a man but I said that was Jesus you think it was an old man appeared them up to Abraham we think the old man it appeared to Moses if we're gonna stay on that in the vision this rumor one time they're gonna lean on my desk we'd like to see him you know Brett around sitting at the Alpha knee you don't eat they got three Lindholm in there you often they don't eat and he went beyond the curtain of time they told us we don't eat here we got to go back to earth and take up a body to eat they say yeah but wait a minute Mel chatter dick one glad you thought man I remember Melchizedek was a human being spoke into existence and spoke right back out that was not the theophany that theophany was inside of them you know what it looked like what was outside you got any problems with that what are your theophany look like Weather Center or saying what did you see how they look like look like you you know it look like somebody else oh come on all of us got a little bit doing here we want to think about well getting over our boy we know how all this that's how silly we think remember if the orphanage don't eat the ground was still right he said no charity with Almighty well charity was a theophany inside of a human element the human element could not die for your sins he was not your brother oh yeah you look he said I've seen him twice she walked around cleared his throat you know number 13 was read faced everything yes sure and they she's the masterpiece with what auditorally sitting there he said that's right exactly where he saw Jesus the first time in vision that's built orderto and built right over the same spot I went right here the other day and look and when I looked and seeing him looking toward the east you remember hearing me tell you when I was out there preaching for praying for my father a little boy just a little boy just a boy preacher that's where I saw him step looking at him he had his head turned sideways from me I kept walking around clearing my throat in a broom Said's feeling I kept watching and he never did never did turn and I called his name Jesus and he turned around and held his arms out and that's all I remember is that the one holding there that's 13 he called him Jesus he got his attention so evidently saw Jesus is right he saw Jesus evidently got it right go to the next scene not our the show wrote it up my street fight while I was praying and asking God to save him and not to let him die center that I loved him while I was in prayer I raised up to look up towards the east from here and there was a vision and standing just above me many of you know the vision was the Lord Jesus he was just above probably 10 feet above my head standing in a tower with one foot just making her step he had a white garment Lerman a friends around the side of it he had hired down to his old shoulders he looked to be a man about what the Bible said he was about thirty but a small thin built fella very small looked like wooden weighed over a hundred and thirty pounds he's been pretty good describing any because he described it he's describing Jesus come on and I looked at her thought personal that I might be wrong from I rubbed my eyes and looked up again and he was standing kind of sideways kind of a profile of his face in the looks of his face which I've always seen in the visions once he he didn't see an old man who envisioned a young man another vision is always seen in visions has been like Hoffman's head of Christ they use his $30 the others he uses 33 look that's the reason I have that in my house on my literature because that's the way it look more like that only seem to be small Hoffman so what does Jesus look like Oh well you said now not exactly okay he said it close close the only he was a small man and to get this place now there's true three more quotes about him Hoffman's with everybody agree with me whereas shorten it in a hurry then what brother branham saw standing out in the field in time was a picture close he saw Jesus and he was close to looking like Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 I know the difference between this and how all this makeover had been made I put these two pictures up here for this one to represent him at about thirty years of age and this one to representing them at 33 the reason is because I'm in the middle and I accomplished that problem he said well that don't do I don't care who job dad and what they done to get it I surprised you when they change it listen go ahead to the next one which would be spiritual food and you see then when that went up and what's he talking about Tucson Arizona seven angels right hey buddy women in the robe a career the seven angels coming to it you remember that watch I hope you'll catch this one and listen he saw a vision in jeffersonville in 62 saw the angels and saw the fame and saw all of the things he goes to Tucson did he see a vision you don't remember me walking down through that idiot he didn't see a vision in Tucson they took a picture of what he saw not realize things are right Abraham seen him singing sing then he appeared today that's all I'm trying to do that didn't make anything out of rudder breath it makes it to be heard supposed to be look Robert down in Mexico to son Edward taking the picture with it it was mysterious I George a picture or something that was real something struck the lens of the camera right I don't care what they say now that it was a jet it was short looks good it was material side brother Fred Salomon they're sitting right back there an iron brother Jean Norman standing right there president when it went up they took the picture still they don't know what about it you're some time ago even saying look at here this looks like this and the main JAL's wings how they unfolded in there now let's do something if I take a minute or two and you got to go go ahead too far clear would you pull up Hoffman's pitcher brother Joe 33 it'd take us a minute because we didn't know how this was gonna go you want to know what Jesus looks like you see the clothes as it was with Hoffman at 33 okay now this Hoffman's really is a crop off taken from the rich young ruler because Hoffman tainted rich young ruler Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane and then we'll do his three there's three of them where he was praying in the garden and then when he was a young child with the talking to the priest and that's the three Hoffman's all right there is that one so if we can get that one brother Joe we'll just say with that one get the one with Jesus where's the rich young ruler I asked him to crop off the rich young ruler for you to get a point you know that one and what it looks like there's what he looks like he said what I just too much now well that's what your prophet said now so if you think he's too much then goodbye you ain't going no further approval no because you done blinded yourself he's the one that said that's what it looked like the closest could be with Hoffman's and there he stands with the rich young ruler over on this side come that part of his garment Hoffman's were originally is that they cropped it off in my damp they pulled it down and laid this out of it he didn't paint just this by itself he painted that and they cropped it down from there now so when he went out to Tucson he saw the seven angels pulling up brother Joe just the part now not the end set there you go turn it over don't leave it like that turn it to we're supposed to be I'm supposed to be laying down and he ain't getting with it they can't can you flip it I'll flip the screen it everybody know what I'm saying you can't flip it alright now alright rotate it that is the original one right not up this way that is he written one he says on spiritual food said they told him to turn it to the right he was told to turn it to the right he didn't even see it when all of that he was told to turn it to the right now you've got this one earn it you say that's left no you got to go to wave lines it up I asked you a question oh he got it okay I asked you a simple question we Steve was pardoned went on the rider the one on the Left believe that there's what was seen in Arizona and he says here's the Angels there's been a lot of things been said in there here's an Indian with his nose his mouth in an Indian turn it right now put it like where you had it okay and when you turn it right I'll read it listen he's talking about the pyramid that wind that went up the big observation from way back in California and Mexico and Dane and the Lord told him in paragraph 85 one day turning it to the right looking there was Jesus Christ just as perfect as Hoffman never drove him he says that's Austin now I want you to put Hoffman in there which way you don't turn you looking at away which way you going plea he said to make the heavens declare it the Bible declares it the message declares it first time I ever seen him he looked like the head of hoffmann I had never seen that before and in Billy Sunday's Tabernacle years ago I saw it my house hasn't been without one of the pictures since then there in the sky saying that the very God that I saw up in this vision out in here just a little boy out here by where the schoolhouse stand he looked like that and in the heavens thirty-three years later the Claridge that is true that's the way he looks now as I said you can't put that in there he's looking the wrong right he's looking the wrong way our eyes there's the mobilizer thing some of them are gone and made differently but you can't put him at night that way right this is nothing brother Joe there's your Hoffmans in the cloud do you follow me you can't put the picture in to go that way there's Hoffman future in what he said and it was remember here he's turning that away talking to the rich young ruler I asked you a simple question musicians get ready with Steve on which side of Jesus did he pardon right or left Hoffman's disappear perfect what about it is your God real enough that you can see him and know what he looks like is he a being is he a person is he real was it matter what you look fly oh I won't go get paid a little extra benefit we get to see what he looks like is that any problem it's any problem just think about we could actually see what he looks like what about it come on musicians what about it how real is your God now there's no need to think about it anything for you to turn around on and go around to the world and say this is my Jesus this what my Jesus looks like that ain't gonna try to convert nobody we ain't out there trying to convert I ain't trying to convert nobody on the internet I preach to this church you out there or listening to see and do what you want - I'm not your pastor only pastor at this church what is your guard up well my god looks like this over here well then show me where it compares with the Prophet but what he saw all of those years when he saw him out in the field when he seen him many times and he finally come to it he said wait a minute where did he come to it where did he come to him - who the visible now for a minute I laid down a situation before you that the Prophet said for you to be able to pick up that picture it shows the halo above him is copyrighted up in Washington DC hang in there religious Hall of Arts but for you to be able to see that picture it's more real and it would be if you were standing there today it took place because the camera will not take psychology brother branham stood there in Arizona insult Jesus the way the Book of Revelations describes him the book of Revelation in chapter 1 scene 1 standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the Son of Man Girt about the paps with a golden girdle that vision has to go all the way and climaxing in the bride of Jesus Christ what he's been around see out there I'll read it to you haven't laying out where he said look at his eyes look at his beard look at the things he said it's just like Hoffman but who did he say he saw Jesus what do you want to see let's take what do you want to see we'll see Jesus now that the opportunity to be able to understand what Jesus looks like but what good is it to understand what a Jesus looks like to try to place it off if you don't believe he's real are you listening you don't believe he's a real person then he can't have his picture made if he's just a myth he can't have his picture money if you believe his picture was made and we believe it looked like Hofmann you've got to be at least to start to believe in that God is real what about it now real is your God but president you just don't understand I'm secured because I'm afraid that God is listen you don't understand human terminologies do you realize that to say that God is a real person you're putting him to a situation of bringing him not limited but bringing him into reality and that he's not by doing that under pressure do you understand why would you not be more scared of a spirit that's everywhere and knows all of your thoughts and your ways and he did it you didn't listen if he's a spirit has ever worked he knows every move every thought ever done he knows that he says it if he's a scary now let's go into the Bible I thought according to the Bible that if I confess my sins the Bible said what he's just and will forgive able to judge now does he see those sins after you've repented where their mama said see if forgetfulness never to be remembered no more far as the east of the Western ain't no far too easy with you go easy to come back we're at least welcome any there is if it's a North and South they would have limitations you can't see your sins because they're under the blood of Jesus Christ this blood world is covered by bumper blood of Jesus Christ and he can't see your sins why would you not want him call you like that Oh God how do I do it I tried to preach it years ago and got in trouble how do you preach a limit in God you don't want to be there saying that he said I don't remember he limits himself they blur and he said I don't remember your fin how come cuz it were annihilated not just forgiven annihilated are we still in the Bible we understand what it mean I mean he said well brother down you're trying to make him real like some kind of something with that realgar if he is that then he limits himself to that and by him being if he was a spirit he'd see everything over here and he'd have to remember all of my sins are you with me but if he's a person on the beating and by his own word he can lop it's like so clean until they can't be remembered and I quote brother Brandon let me never remember he back there say something paraphrase of his clothes he said I can't bring out from under the blood what somebody has put on the dock if you don't believe that it's a bit of quote you oughta believe it
