[25:13] understanding that the will of the Lord
[25:15] is
[25:17] and Beyond drunk with one wherein is
[25:20] success but be filled with spirit
[25:24] speak to yourselves and Psalms and hymns
[25:27] and spirit to some singing and making
[25:30] melody in your heart to the Lord
[25:33] new things are always for all things

[43:43] and lead us Lord as we read your words
[43:46] you come and speak to us about your work
[43:49] in Jesus name amen
[43:53] first John 2.
[43:56] now
[43:57] this will be a background
[44:01] far to be able to finish
[44:04] Wednesday night
[44:06] I didn't finish the message you know
[44:08] that we kind of just went through a
[44:10] preview and review but I didn't finish
[44:14] up what I wanted to because I knew it
[44:17] wouldn't have enough time and and the
[44:18] Lord's just began to reveal it to me so
[44:21] you know this will be now a background
[44:23] so remember that this will be a
[44:25] background up to so far in the message
[44:27] and then I'll tell you where that we
[44:29] change over okay and that way we'll
[44:32] you'll see how it all ties together but
[44:34] first John 2
[44:36] will begin in verse 18.
[44:42] little children
[44:43] I think that's who we are
[44:46] you know he speaks to the fathers he
[44:48] speaks to the to the grown-up ones and
[44:52] then to the children in the Book of John
[44:54] and I think we're just a little children
[44:56] and that's serious I mean that
[44:58] little children it is the last time and
[45:01] as you have heard that Antichrist shall
[45:04] come even now are there are many
[45:07] antichrists whereby we know that it is
[45:10] the last time they went out from us but
[45:13] they were not of us for if they had been
[45:16] of us they would no doubt have continued
[45:19] with us
[45:21] but they went out that they might be
[45:23] made manifest
[45:24] that they were not all of us see
[45:28] what's he saying they went out from us
[45:30] because it wouldn't of us you know what
[45:32] when we left the Baptist they said they
[45:34] went out of us
[45:36] because it wouldn't of us you know that
[45:38] was true
[45:39] you know when you left the Presbyterian
[45:40] you went out from them because you
[45:42] wouldn't of them right you may have been
[45:44] over them for a while but not to stay
[45:46] with them or would have stayed there or
[45:48] someone so now we're just manifesting
[45:50] what we are if I'm getting there
[45:52] but you have an auction from the Holy
[45:55] One
[45:56] and you know all things
[45:58] I have not written unto you because you
[46:01] know not the truth but because you know
[46:04] it and that no lie is of the truth
[46:07] who is a liar but he that denies that
[46:10] Jesus is the Christ
[46:12] he is Antichrist that denied the father
[46:15] and the son see then we're not Oneness
[46:19] all right the next verse we're not
[46:20] Trinity either
[46:22] we know the truth right because that's
[46:24] what he's just got to say and you know
[46:26] the truth I write to you because you
[46:27] know the truth see all right so we're
[46:30] going to look at what he said who is it
[46:31] who isn't alive but he that denied that
[46:34] Jesus is the Christ he is Antichrist
[46:36] that denies the father and the son right
[46:38] whosoever denied the son hath not the
[46:41] the son the same hath not the father but
[46:44] he that acknowledges the son hath the
[46:47] father also
[46:49] let that therefore abide in you which ye
[46:52] have heard from the beginning
[46:54] if that which ye have heard from the
[46:56] beginning shall remain in you
[46:58] now remember remain in you now that'll
[47:01] be more this afternoon's message you
[47:04] should you also shall continue in the
[47:07] Sun and in the father
[47:09] and this is the promise that he had
[47:11] promised us
[47:13] even eternal life these things I have I
[47:17] written unto you concerning them that
[47:19] seduce you
[47:21] but the anointing which you have
[47:23] received of him abideth in you and you
[47:26] need not that any man teach you but it's
[47:29] the same anointing teaches you of all
[47:32] things and is truth and there's no lie
[47:35] and even as it hath taught you you shall
[47:39] abide in him you may be seated the Lord
[47:42] that is blessing to the reading of the
[47:45] word
[47:46] thank you
[47:48] now we haven't got off of the adoption
[47:53] um we're just breaking down to speak
[47:56] about it because
[47:58] we studied on adoption and brought it in
[48:01] three stages you know the new birth
[48:04] and then bringing it up to the Authority
[48:07] or the you know the uh point of hearing
[48:10] him The Headstone coming on the
[48:13] individual and adopting them into the
[48:16] family and then at that time is to sweep
[48:20] out as the prophet said a message
[48:23] that would you know from the uniting of
[48:27] the head and body and it's not another
[48:29] message or another Prophet to come you
[48:32] know and stuff like that we're not
[48:33] looking at something like that it is the
[48:35] message of the hour that we're looking
[48:37] at so don't misunderstand that all right
[48:40] but because I wasn't the one that said
[48:42] that that it would sweep out
[48:44] and that there'd be a message it was our
[48:46] Prophet that said that but see we're not
[48:49] trying to concern ourselves then with
[48:51] the change
[48:53] in the basis of the moment the twinkling
[48:56] of an eye
[48:57] because that's what everybody talks
[48:58] about change change Rapture change
[49:00] change all right but see to me if we're
[49:03] not in the right place in the right
[49:06] position as I've always said you don't
[49:09] go down to the bus depot to get you an
[49:12] airplane ticket you know that's just not
[49:15] even sensible you know you you go to the
[49:18] airport and then at that place you don't
[49:21] go to the wrong terminal because they
[49:23] list each one you know you've got to
[49:25] you've got America you got the you know
[49:28] all of these others that are sitting
[49:29] there Pan Am and all and and
[49:32] doctor you've got to go to the right
[49:33] place you got to be in the right place
[49:36] and the prophet of God said to be in the
[49:39] wrong ranks at the Rapture would be no
[49:43] excuse that's right now I didn't say
[49:45] that he said it that's right so all I'm
[49:47] trying to do is to get me and you to
[49:50] find the right plane ticket okay if it's
[49:54] Delta and I don't like Delta well the
[49:57] only time my flute dealt to the Jamaica
[49:59] I lost my luggage and I had to wear
[50:02] brother Brady stuff and use sister
[50:04] Brady's uh cologne you know and the old
[50:08] Rooks and stuff and uh brother Brady
[50:11] chased me all day but anyhow but that
[50:15] was just you know and it wasn't their
[50:17] fault I know because it has so much I'm
[50:19] just saying that but uh see let's make
[50:21] sure we line up at the right place and
[50:23] be ready because that's all we're
[50:25] supposed to be concerned with and as I
[50:27] say now it is not that no more than
[50:30] about years ago I told that I'm not
[50:33] talking about or interested in the uh
[50:36] the going to heaven amen I said because
[50:39] I've always thought and believed that
[50:42] heaven was supposed to come here to get
[50:44] me to take me there right well if I go
[50:46] there I'm in the wrong place
[50:48] see because he's here all right see now
[50:52] that's not meaning you're not wanting
[50:54] the Lord to come it means an
[50:55] understanding you know of where we're at
[50:58] and what we're doing so we got into the
[51:00] adoption and the adoption is the third
[51:03] stage of adoption is not the change
[51:05] right it is to understand the change I
[51:08] hope by now that that is dwelling within
[51:11] our hearts and where it says in Romans 8
[51:13] 30 verse 23 to it to understand the
[51:17] Redemption of the body see so then
[51:20] that's what we're trying to do is to get
[51:21] him to understand that right and I
[51:24] believe that's what we're dealing with
[51:25] now is the understanding of that and
[51:28] we've been dealing with it ever since we
[51:30] started right see because it's not a new
[51:33] thing it's not something different it's
[51:35] like I told you when God gave you the
[51:38] new birth he said he is pleased to dwell
[51:40] in your soul all right and in that new
[51:43] birth that he gave you he laid claim on
[51:46] that body and says you're not going to
[51:48] get another one all right so it's
[51:50] working on this one that we're doing and
[51:53] you know and he's been gracious to us
[51:55] all these years and giving us 40
[51:57] something years to be able to preach to
[52:01] try to get us to the position that we
[52:03] can find the right airplane tickets no
[52:05] the airline to get in line and have
[52:08] everything right but now
[52:10] so we're not leaving that we're on the
[52:13] third stage of it which is to wit the
[52:17] understanding
[52:19] of the Redemption of the body in other
[52:22] words learning it right and we must
[52:24] first learn it by even in the mechanics
[52:27] you know you know what I'm talking about
[52:29] the prophet we speak of mechanics and
[52:31] Dynamics and mechanics is the word and
[52:34] the word of God must be sown down in our
[52:36] hearts that's right and that's what I'm
[52:38] saying that we've got to be at the right
[52:40] place if we don't know where to be how
[52:44] do we know what to do all right so we've
[52:47] been told all these years and and we're
[52:49] getting into a position to know where to
[52:51] stay what stay with the word amen let's
[52:53] stay with the word amen because it's the
[52:57] one that's going to lead us through all
[52:58] right amen now
[53:00] what's the point now of what we're going
[53:03] to try to cover today
[53:06] because
[53:08] according to what we read in the Bible
[53:10] it looks odd doesn't it
[53:13] he's just got through explaining to the
[53:16] people that's when we went back to verse
[53:18] 18 we should have read back to verse one
[53:20] and come over you read that sometime and
[53:23] try it all together
[53:24] but he tells you that you have
[53:27] little children you have the new birth
[53:30] you have an unction of the or about
[53:33] verse uh 20. which means like dynamite
[53:37] it's like a a you know uh an anointing
[53:41] all right right and uh
[53:45] you have that
[53:47] and we know he said verse 22 that we
[53:49] know the truth
[53:51] all right now
[53:53] so then don't let nobody deceive you he
[53:56] said
[53:58] because you know these things right all
[54:00] right see then after all of that saying
[54:03] it looks like he makes an odd statement
[54:06] in verse 27 because he's talking about
[54:07] the anointing that he's just talked
[54:10] about all right and then he says you
[54:13] don't need nobody to teach you
[54:15] well see that's what a lot of people in
[54:17] the message today they believe it that
[54:19] way and a lot of people in the world
[54:20] believe it anyway we don't need nobody
[54:22] to teach us
[54:23] we have the Holy Ghost
[54:26] well according to the prophet of God he
[54:29] said if we have the Holy Ghost it'll
[54:31] lead us to the word all right amen no if
[54:34] we're not led to the word we don't have
[54:35] the Holy Ghost that's not sexual that's
[54:37] not a that's don't take a big brainstorm
[54:39] to understand that's just plain language
[54:42] all right but see then I gave you the
[54:44] quote because we know what it says
[54:46] the Wildwood then the prophet said you
[54:50] know
[54:50] why would it be that we would God would
[54:54] write in his scripture
[54:56] that we need to fight for ministry right
[55:00] see and then you turn around you say
[55:02] well brother Dale I just stay at home
[55:03] listen to tapes I just do this I want it
[55:06] right straight from brother Brandon well
[55:07] according to the Bible you won't get it
[55:08] I know that that's the Bible
[55:11] responsible for other than telling you
[55:13] what it says you mean I can't get it
[55:16] without a thoughtfulness according to
[55:18] the Bible
[55:19] now I mean to settle it you know you say
[55:23] well brother Dale you shouldn't be that
[55:24] I'm not arrogant I'm just telling the
[55:26] truth
[55:27] seeing you say well we need no man
[55:29] teacher well then shut your tape
[55:31] recorder down and don't listen to
[55:34] brother Branham because that's a man
[55:36] teaching you that's right
[55:38] all right come on see
[55:40] we think that we're so smart in our
[55:42] doings and then we trap ourselves oh yes
[55:45] I stay with the prophet well that's a
[55:47] man teaching you right
[55:50] and no man can reveal anything to you
[55:52] we'll get to that this afternoon more
[55:54] that's right if he did what you need to
[55:57] hold it goes far then right
[56:01] they got to work together that's what I
[56:03] want you to see today that's my point of
[56:04] the whole message is to see how the Holy
[56:06] Spirit works with that
[56:09] that anointing of the Holy Spirit
[56:11] through somebody else will work in you
[56:14] amen it's on the inside of you and it'll
[56:17] come together
[56:19] what's inside of you comes together with
[56:22] what you hear right all right see then
[56:24] we have it in perfect order that's the
[56:27] whole text of what I'm trying to get so
[56:28] if you miss it that's my whole point see
[56:31] but see you say well we don't need
[56:33] nobody to teach us
[56:35] right all right then brother round and
[56:37] what did he say about it
[56:39] unless you Egypt in Israel and Egypt
[56:43] paragraph 104. he says well you say I
[56:46] don't need anybody to teach me glory to
[56:48] God I got the Holy Ghost well then the
[56:50] Holy Ghost was wrong when it said it set
[56:54] some in the church teachers
[56:56] God put them in the church as teachers
[56:58] that settles it
[57:01] mine he put teachers in there if the
[57:04] Holy Ghost is going to do all the
[57:06] teaching huh all right so now we say we
[57:10] believe brother Branham
[57:12] all right then you gotta say Amen to
[57:14] what he said and wrote me you know and
[57:18] I'm honest sometimes I've had to say on
[57:19] me you know it cuts you you know your
[57:22] work does and and but it's not for a
[57:24] reason all right amen but see then why
[57:27] would he put the prophet would say like
[57:29] Ephesians 4
[57:31] see we read in John we say we got the
[57:33] word well what about Ephesians 4 11.
[57:36] then he gave some Apostles some Prophet
[57:38] some evangelist pastor of teacher going
[57:40] on down through there to say for what
[57:41] for the perfecting of the Saints right
[57:43] and the prophet of God verifying
[57:46] right that they would have to be a
[57:48] Firefall Ministry to break this message
[57:50] down to the people on the Statue of
[57:52] perfect man he should fill me up Lord
[57:54] that I may teach others Apostle prophets
[57:56] painless pastor and teacher for the
[57:58] bringing of these things into the church
[58:00] all right sure that doesn't make
[58:03] anything that didn't give me a raise
[58:06] right you know I didn't get a raise
[58:08] because I said God's word
[58:10] I just believe God's word I believed it
[58:13] before I was a preacher or a pastor and
[58:15] I believe it now amen because that's the
[58:18] one thing that I believe I believe in
[58:20] Reading What God Says
[58:22] and believing it right then when if
[58:24] we're going to believe brother Branham
[58:25] brought us what God Said then we'll have
[58:28] to believe that he didn't bring us
[58:30] something contrary
[58:34] I'll get to it this evening all he's
[58:36] done was open our understanding right
[58:38] because he couldn't Quicken it unto us
[58:39] the Holy Ghost would have to be the one
[58:42] so when I watched this message this
[58:44] morning tie in now back to Wednesday
[58:46] night and then we'll get back and speak
[58:49] a little bit this afternoon on it all
[58:51] right but see the main thing I want you
[58:53] to look at
[58:56] is you've got to have the inside teacher
[58:59] right that's right all right
[59:02] and the Holy Ghost is not an outside
[59:04] teacher I said well now you're going
[59:06] this way then you're going that way well
[59:07] you show me which way to go I mean I'll
[59:09] turn the pulpit over you and I'll give
[59:11] you the notes and let you speak about
[59:13] this and tell you what we're talking
[59:15] about we're talking about the Holy Ghost
[59:18] being the inside teacher
[59:20] all right but that inside teacher that's
[59:23] inside of you
[59:25] buy the new birth
[59:27] the anointing right
[59:29] all right and I gave you a quote down
[59:32] here where right around said that that
[59:33] was where it come when it come down on
[59:35] Jesus it came down and went inning right
[59:38] okay because it's an inside teacher all
[59:41] right now so I gave you the quote that
[59:43] paragraph one or page 143 of the
[59:46] Samaritan Church age that it's not an
[59:48] outside teacher it's an inside teacher
[59:51] he said you could hear the word read it
[59:53] there's I'm talking you could hear the
[59:55] word every day of your life and put the
[59:58] wrong interpretation on it
[1:00:00] without having the inside teacher all
[1:00:03] right so then we must have the inside
[1:00:05] teacher all right now here's where the
[1:00:08] preacher comes in if he don't have the
[1:00:11] inside teacher how can he teach you
[1:00:15] absolutely amen he'll teach you his own
[1:00:18] idea all right he'll teach you his own
[1:00:20] thought his own Doctrine see so then the
[1:00:23] holy spirit's working on both ends right
[1:00:25] the holy spirit is supposed to be in me
[1:00:28] to get a message that I can speak to you
[1:00:31] that the holy spirit inside of you will
[1:00:34] say amen back to it now of course a lot
[1:00:37] of you don't amen but then that makes
[1:00:39] you say well brother Dale tell me what
[1:00:41] some of your people believe I don't know
[1:00:43] because they don't amen what I say so I
[1:00:46] don't know what and a lot of times
[1:00:47] they'll amen what other people are
[1:00:49] saying but that's all right that's your
[1:00:50] business I just don't worry about it I
[1:00:53] just preach the gospel you can do what
[1:00:55] you want to you know about the rest of
[1:00:57] it you can vote me out anytime you want
[1:00:59] to and get you another Pastor if you
[1:01:01] think somebody else can help us and then
[1:01:03] I'll sit down and say Amen to it because
[1:01:05] I'm I want to get out of here not not
[1:01:08] just playing around I want to get out of
[1:01:10] here all right and see you don't have to
[1:01:12] amen me for me to preach I was going to
[1:01:14] preach what I'm going to pray for you
[1:01:15] amen or not it's just you know it just
[1:01:18] helps you right you know it does have to
[1:01:20] keep you awake right amen amen I already
[1:01:22] amen and many a time because when
[1:01:24] somebody was saying something you know
[1:01:26] what was work on my eyeballs were doing
[1:01:27] dropping in that realize if I wake up
[1:01:30] and holler amen I'm gonna I'm not gonna
[1:01:32] go to sleep
[1:01:33] so maybe it'll help you to stay away all
[1:01:35] right but now listen amen amen get the
[1:01:38] point
[1:01:39] God uses someone
[1:01:45] to teach us right right
[1:01:48] but he cannot reveal it
[1:01:51] okay that's right right he can only
[1:01:53] teach it right all right
[1:01:56] she because the holy spirit's got to be
[1:01:58] inside
[1:02:00] to be able to make it alive and run
[1:02:02] around and said that Holy Spirit is down
[1:02:04] in your soul waiting on you to bring him
[1:02:06] the word he said and when he bring you
[1:02:08] bring it in pure in other words he said
[1:02:10] this immediately made a lot now if it's
[1:02:12] brought in not pure right he can't make
[1:02:15] it loud he's going to say
[1:02:18] he's going to say nope it's not right
[1:02:21] amen agree amen if he's in her so then
[1:02:26] why should we worry about it well I
[1:02:28] don't want to listen to brother so and
[1:02:29] so I might get deceived no you're all
[1:02:31] ready to see I mean we're just born to
[1:02:33] see why don't we admit that's right we
[1:02:36] going that away and until God takes us
[1:02:39] totally and changes us all the way
[1:02:41] through amen we still have a deception
[1:02:44] within us that's right that's correct
[1:02:45] it's called a human being right
[1:02:48] of what we are all right
[1:02:51] let's see
[1:02:52] he chose the foolishness of preaching
[1:02:56] what about that
[1:02:58] right First Corinthians 1 21. all right
[1:03:01] I'll give you a couple quotes from
[1:03:03] running around them there on it
[1:03:06] question answers on the Holy Ghost in 59
[1:03:08] and in the world and is falling apart in
[1:03:12] 63 where he said through the foolishness
[1:03:15] of preaching right
[1:03:17] it would say it in the loss that's right
[1:03:22] see then that way we have to depend upon
[1:03:26] the one that is inside of us
[1:03:29] to lead us now right
[1:03:32] and then by doing that then we must
[1:03:35] follow
[1:03:37] what is brought unto us that's right
[1:03:39] amen all right and that Holy Spirit
[1:03:42] within us will tell us whether or not
[1:03:44] the preacher is right that's right so
[1:03:47] why do we worry about being confused
[1:03:49] right right
[1:03:51] I could sit down and listen to the to
[1:03:54] the pope of Rome explaining the Catholic
[1:03:56] Church to the detail that wasn't deceive
[1:03:58] me come on brother you know I listened
[1:04:00] to a man eight hours one day explain the
[1:04:02] Mormon Doctrine when you finish you know
[1:04:04] what I said I said
[1:04:06] you wouldn't believe it but most of the
[1:04:08] people I follow around in myself believe
[1:04:09] what you believe they just call it the
[1:04:12] message
[1:04:14] the two souls coming down from the the
[1:04:18] Mormon doctrine of pre-existence
[1:04:24] get my point
[1:04:26] see we need the teacher
[1:04:31] or the faithful Ministry now see it just
[1:04:33] says teacher a lot of people just you
[1:04:34] know that they take one word now I
[1:04:36] believe we need to fight for an industry
[1:04:37] all right amen amen I believe we need to
[1:04:40] go over five four minutes not just one
[1:04:41] Ministry there's no such thing I don't
[1:04:43] have it all right it doesn't know what
[1:04:45] it won't work in one individual because
[1:04:47] a random had it all right but he sat
[1:04:49] down and listened to the five four
[1:04:50] minutes okay so then he showed what we
[1:04:53] need to do all right but we need to file
[1:04:56] for Ministry to speak to us the word of
[1:04:59] the Lord that God has made alive to them
[1:05:03] right that's it all right now at Earth
[1:05:06] where we'll get to this evening you'll
[1:05:07] see more about it you know how can they
[1:05:09] preach without Maybe
[1:05:13] all right because that way God cannot
[1:05:17] Quicken
[1:05:19] anything that has error in it right
[1:05:22] that's right that's right and you show
[1:05:24] me that again there's just no way
[1:05:26] you can't Quicken it because when he
[1:05:28] told me years ago he said you preach the
[1:05:29] gospel I'll back it up and I thought my
[1:05:32] Lord I'm preaching and would challenge
[1:05:33] the world of this message come show me
[1:05:36] what's wrong but I knew later on what
[1:05:38] he's saying
[1:05:39] stay with it just keep on going all
[1:05:41] right just keep going right on down the
[1:05:43] road no matter what everybody else does
[1:05:45] just go right on down the road preaching
[1:05:46] the gospel because it's foolishness
[1:05:51] but around you know what is to say
[1:05:53] he said now to God the world is
[1:05:56] foolishness
[1:05:58] he said but to the world God's word is
[1:06:01] foolishness
[1:06:02] because they don't believe it all right
[1:06:05] and see then through the foolishness of
[1:06:07] preaching
[1:06:24] and then you listen to the Lord Jesus
[1:06:26] you're listening to a man
[1:06:28] what we're saying falls apart right but
[1:06:31] yeah that's not going to change anybody
[1:06:33] because you know what they're gonna go
[1:06:34] right on believing what to believe
[1:06:35] they're gonna go right on listening to
[1:06:37] whatever and play it takes and that
[1:06:38] that's all right right
[1:06:41] you know that's that's their business
[1:06:42] that's nothing to me and you that's no
[1:06:45] concern it's just an explanation of
[1:06:47] telling you what I'm talking about
[1:06:49] right
[1:06:51] now
[1:06:52] I want to speak more this afternoon on
[1:06:54] the point
[1:06:55] of how the fifo ministry is involved in
[1:07:00] your salvation
[1:07:02] and but now we want to take a point to
[1:07:04] try to get it for this morning all right
[1:07:07] see my point I want you to see is
[1:07:11] as the faithful Ministry is teaching us
[1:07:14] the word
[1:07:15] see we must have that inside teacher
[1:07:18] okay
[1:07:21] because if we don't we have nothing to
[1:07:24] Quicken it unto us
[1:07:26] you know to make it alive to us and and
[1:07:29] we can't get what's being said all right
[1:07:31] so now we know
[1:07:33] that the anointing is the holy spirit
[1:07:36] right right
[1:07:38] and it dwells within you that's right
[1:07:41] the auction is within you all right now
[1:07:44] then we know that it's using others to
[1:07:47] speak to us it can even use people to
[1:07:51] speak that are not Christians yes that's
[1:07:54] correct amen you know not born again
[1:07:55] bride
[1:07:57] right I told you about the man that
[1:08:00] preached all you do in word indeed do
[1:08:01] all in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:08:03] everybody else start praying in Jesus
[1:08:04] Christ and I said brother mode I'm ready
[1:08:06] to go to the water because I was in the
[1:08:07] Baptist Church I had to go get that
[1:08:09] straight because I seen I had to get
[1:08:12] baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ see
[1:08:15] and God used that man
[1:08:17] and I hope he gives you eternal life for
[1:08:19] that one makes you deep right you know I
[1:08:21] do I want everybody to be there right
[1:08:23] amen but now listen
[1:08:25] see that anointing
[1:08:28] is to be the inside teacher
[1:08:32] that we must have
[1:08:35] to teach us the word
[1:08:37] now father what I'm saying for just a
[1:08:39] second because if it's not the inside
[1:08:41] teacher we will agree
[1:08:45] and the biggest Fortune religious world
[1:08:47] does this agrees with the Bible being
[1:08:50] right
[1:08:53] I mean you go to the Baptist church
[1:08:55] today and you hold up a Bible said holy
[1:08:57] Bible they said we believe every word is
[1:08:59] sitting there
[1:09:00] well you know to a degree they do
[1:09:03] but then you start telling them the
[1:09:05] things that are in there about one God
[1:09:07] the water baptism and they'll go along
[1:09:09] with the one God two you hit the water
[1:09:10] Baptist right right then they'll rebel
[1:09:13] against you all right why
[1:09:17] because they've been taught all of their
[1:09:19] life
[1:09:21] of the Trinity exactly right
[1:09:24] they sung songs since they were
[1:09:31] well you know don't condemn them just
[1:09:35] remember where you and I came from
[1:09:36] because we sung the same songs and we
[1:09:39] had the same thoughts right right
[1:09:41] amen we'll see we need the inside
[1:09:45] teacher to keep us straight right
[1:09:46] because now here's what I want you to
[1:09:49] see
[1:09:49] if you don't have the inside teacher
[1:09:55] then you'll take what man says become
[1:09:58] religious
[1:10:00] Etc go to church be a church member
[1:10:03] field abuse whatever do it right you
[1:10:05] know and the whole world will preach in
[1:10:07] heaven when you die
[1:10:09] right
[1:10:10] that's right right but see that don't
[1:10:12] have anything to do with it
[1:10:15] that you say well you don't want us to
[1:10:17] live right now I want you to get saved
[1:10:19] amen you get saved and you live right
[1:10:22] that's a simple answer to anything you
[1:10:25] know you don't want me to do this no no
[1:10:29] I want you to get bored again
[1:10:31] I'm not telling you to go out and live
[1:10:33] like the devil I'm just telling you you
[1:10:36] are that's right it's like problem
[1:10:39] solved we are the devil until we get
[1:10:43] born again what are we all right well
[1:10:46] then I get what we're talking about
[1:10:49] we know the message because this is
[1:10:51] what's hard was hard seemingly to a lot
[1:10:54] of us to understand but
[1:10:57] you know you could be anointed
[1:11:00] with the genuine Holy Spirit
[1:11:05] every day of your life and still be lost
[1:11:10] now you think it
[1:11:12] nominational world you think you can
[1:11:14] explain that to Pentecostal people that
[1:11:16] that's all they are is that upward
[1:11:18] geared gumption you know I feel it I
[1:11:20] still love to steal it and I'm going to
[1:11:23] say this about three times this morning
[1:11:25] Please
[1:11:27] don't panic
[1:11:29] that brother Dale is saying that there's
[1:11:32] not an anointing that comes down
[1:11:37] now you'll hear me the statements I'll
[1:11:38] be making in Reading will sound like
[1:11:40] that but please don't do it now because
[1:11:43] that's not what I'm saying because I
[1:11:45] believe in the prayer feelings of the
[1:11:47] Lord I believe in the presence of the
[1:11:49] Lord I've seen things I've told you
[1:11:51] about it so then don't misunderstand me
[1:11:53] all right
[1:11:55] let's see what is the good of all of
[1:11:58] that if we're not born again right amen
[1:12:01] right what is the good of all that we
[1:12:03] see all the presence of the Lord right
[1:12:05] over calling he said that's the
[1:12:07] blessings
[1:12:09] amen amen now who wouldn't want the
[1:12:13] presence of the Lord I know offended
[1:12:15] people that you remember some of them
[1:12:17] are talking about the peruzia or parsia
[1:12:19] the way they said you pronounce it and
[1:12:20] they said it's the presence of the Lord
[1:12:22] I said well according to the Bible it's
[1:12:23] Peruzzi is used for Pharisee is used for
[1:12:26] Antichrist as well as used for Jesus
[1:12:27] Christ I said it simply means standing
[1:12:29] beside of you I said I don't want the
[1:12:31] Lord standing beside me amen
[1:12:35] I want him with me everywhere I go
[1:12:39] I didn't understand what I'm saying
[1:12:41] right
[1:12:43] if he's standing over beside him and I
[1:12:45] didn't mean he's gonna have to kill me
[1:12:46] one day amen
[1:12:50] if he's standing right not in here he's
[1:12:52] not destroyed me
[1:12:54] but I want to talk about anointed ones
[1:12:57] right or the anoint King right would be
[1:13:01] the better part of the title right now
[1:13:04] we know the message yes
[1:13:07] and we're supposed to understand
[1:13:09] right all right that the prophet caught
[1:13:13] these things
[1:13:14] and says you can be anointed as a sin
[1:13:16] with the genuine Holy Spirit right amen
[1:13:21] it was hard for him to understand
[1:13:24] the Lord had to speak to him and show
[1:13:27] him right right right all right because
[1:13:30] that would be a hard thing to do is to
[1:13:32] try to understand how that could be done
[1:13:34] but he would use people like uh haphas
[1:13:39] you know we'll see the one one of them
[1:13:40] said you know that it's necessary that
[1:13:42] one died for the sins of the people one
[1:13:43] the high priest said that I believe it
[1:13:45] was confident well see that was Brethren
[1:13:47] said that was the anointing of the Holy
[1:13:48] Spirit speaking the word
[1:13:53] and that's why to me that that when John
[1:13:56] came and said who you see the Holy Ghost
[1:13:58] descending and remaining you remember
[1:14:01] John the Baptist who you see the Holy
[1:14:03] Ghost and remaining amen the Bible
[1:14:06] emphasizes why because you can go seek
[1:14:09] accomplished get up from the
[1:14:11] congregation under the high priest
[1:14:13] anointing and just prophesy
[1:14:16] oh yeah sure
[1:14:18] and surely he'd heard of Balaam
[1:14:20] yeah
[1:14:21] I'll let Balaam could say the thing you
[1:14:24] know they want balance since it's
[1:14:26] written in the Bible all right
[1:14:29] yep all right see but that anointing
[1:14:37] he can be upon you amen that's right and
[1:14:42] if you're not born again right what are
[1:14:44] you
[1:14:51] I gave you the quote so you read the
[1:14:53] quote
[1:14:55] um
[1:14:56] he said genuine anointing trying to do
[1:14:58] quite a service on his will
[1:15:05] the Christ revealed in his own word
[1:15:07] number nine on your note sir he said out
[1:15:10] here in the spirit realm you can be
[1:15:12] anointed
[1:15:16] with the genuine Holy Spirit right
[1:15:22] and the anointed ones right oh if I
[1:15:25] could just feel his presence
[1:15:28] oh if I could just feel the Lord
[1:15:31] know if I could have the lord inside of
[1:15:34] me right
[1:15:36] then I don't worry about the feelings
[1:15:38] because I know they're going to come
[1:15:40] right right amen
[1:15:43] anointed ones have to work upon the
[1:15:46] basis of gifts and and things and bring
[1:15:49] in the presence of God and singing him
[1:15:51] down and worshiping down our fasting or
[1:15:54] praying or doing
[1:15:56] and brother rather said they can even
[1:15:58] cast out Devils heal the sick
[1:16:02] all right
[1:16:04] you just be anointed on your spirit
[1:16:06] he said in their soul they're lost right
[1:16:09] now that's hard to slaughter sometimes
[1:16:12] that's correct amen amen right that's
[1:16:16] right so we got to believe it
[1:16:20] see so now is that anointing just
[1:16:24] anointing you or is it inside of you
[1:16:26] come on bro amen come on see what I said
[1:16:30] when I say these things like that see
[1:16:31] then you'll think that I'm saying that
[1:16:33] there is not something coming down no
[1:16:34] sir now don't get that
[1:16:36] I've seen God I've seen Angels I've
[1:16:38] smelt the presence of the Lord you know
[1:16:40] oh my testimony of all these years so
[1:16:42] don't think nothing like that about me
[1:16:44] that I don't believe in the presence
[1:16:45] I'll tell you sometimes they come on up
[1:16:47] here the presence of the Lord is here
[1:16:48] right that's right
[1:16:51] all right
[1:16:52] so I believe in the presence of the Lord
[1:16:54] and I want the presence of the Lord and
[1:16:57] I wish he would walk with me I used to
[1:16:58] when I was my brother first started
[1:17:00] talking to me about the message and I
[1:17:01] was lost as far as I was a
[1:17:03] denominational believer but I didn't
[1:17:05] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost when
[1:17:07] I feel his presence so close to me until
[1:17:08] and I'd be walking up the driveway at
[1:17:11] the house after getting out of the car
[1:17:12] talking with brother mold about the
[1:17:14] message and and I I knew he was tired
[1:17:17] and I'd look around but try to find him
[1:17:19] because it was somebody with me you know
[1:17:22] I believe in that
[1:17:24] in that so don't mention
[1:17:26] misunderstatements will make may sound
[1:17:28] like that I'm just doing no I just gotta
[1:17:30] have it inside I'd have it inside God
[1:17:31] had been said I ain't saying that so now
[1:17:34] you go tell somebody that's the way
[1:17:35] brother Dale believes that you're a liar
[1:17:37] and you'll face God is dead okay nice
[1:17:39] point but it's true but see I believe on
[1:17:43] the inside of you
[1:17:45] the Holy Spirit and I've explained it to
[1:17:48] you so I'll go through it again
[1:17:49] what's the difference in anointed ones
[1:17:51] anointed on their spirit and a genuine
[1:17:53] Christian what's the difference
[1:17:57] you have if you are a Christian
[1:18:00] you are born again Christian and you've
[1:18:02] been a Christian I don't care how long
[1:18:04] 10 years two seconds or 40 years
[1:18:07] do you know it's your anointed just
[1:18:09] exactly like anointed ones that's right
[1:18:14] that's what people don't understand see
[1:18:16] they don't want to go that way
[1:18:18] the anointing comes on your spirit right
[1:18:23] all right
[1:18:25] on your spirit Realm
[1:18:27] and the same anointing is upon you as a
[1:18:30] Christian as the anointing this upon
[1:18:33] I am are the others whatever
[1:18:36] anybody you would say is Fault what's
[1:18:38] the difference
[1:18:39] because what happened was that's why I
[1:18:42] did I believe it like I do that the new
[1:18:44] birth is a birth of the word those
[1:18:46] disciples took the Bible said they took
[1:18:48] the word and held it right and when the
[1:18:50] Holy Ghost fell it quickened what word
[1:18:52] they had inside of them it didn't
[1:18:54] Quicken the seals and the Thunders and
[1:18:56] the plagues and the vows
[1:18:58] amen it didn't Quicken that to him back
[1:19:00] there right
[1:19:02] it quickened what they heard
[1:19:05] it and made that alive so that Holy
[1:19:08] Spirit comes down that anointing upon
[1:19:09] your spirit and when it does if there's
[1:19:12] something in there for it to quickly
[1:19:14] Make That Word Alive in you then inside
[1:19:17] of you is not just an anointing but the
[1:19:20] anointed is inside of you
[1:19:23] and I remember I said this in the
[1:19:25] background if I get through now I'll
[1:19:28] finish you to see this is a background
[1:19:29] for what I left off Wednesday night okay
[1:19:31] that anointing
[1:19:34] see can be upon your spirit and you
[1:19:37] still be lost that's right amen so it's
[1:19:41] important to hear the word right
[1:19:45] and the disciples took the word and held
[1:19:47] it the Bible said
[1:19:51] it emphasize what they've done with it
[1:19:53] right how about Peter said where can we
[1:19:56] go
[1:19:57] thou Hast the words of eternal life what
[1:20:01] can we do
[1:20:03] all right so that anointing can come
[1:20:06] down
[1:20:08] and anoint you
[1:20:12] and you do great signs and wonders
[1:20:14] and still lost right
[1:20:18] but if you've heard the truth the word
[1:20:20] the truth then God when the Holy Spirit
[1:20:24] drops down as the anointing that Holy
[1:20:27] Spirit can drop right on into the soul
[1:20:29] as the person of Jesus Christ that's the
[1:20:32] difference between a person that's not
[1:20:33] born again and what it is one that's
[1:20:35] born again as the person of Jesus Christ
[1:20:37] which is not just the anoint King and it
[1:20:41] is the anointed himself right amen it is
[1:20:43] to God himself it is a very anointed
[1:20:46] right that drops within your soul amen
[1:20:48] amen and makes alive that word and
[1:20:51] urging your birth amen right you follow
[1:20:54] me with that amen
[1:20:55] coach if you follow me I want to go a
[1:20:57] little further and let you see but you
[1:20:58] would say then with brother Dale why
[1:21:00] would God allow these things to take
[1:21:03] place like that
[1:21:05] why would he allow the anointed ones to
[1:21:08] be there
[1:21:09] why would he allow all of these things
[1:21:11] to happen you know where I'm going go to
[1:21:12] Deuteronomy
[1:21:14] now let's read what the Bible says about
[1:21:16] it
[1:21:19] Deuteronomy 13.
[1:21:22] let's read what the Bible says
[1:21:25] of why God
[1:21:28] will allow anointed ones
[1:21:31] to be here in the last days especially
[1:21:33] because we've been down through time all
[1:21:35] the way down through from the time the
[1:21:36] Holy Ghost fell that's what John was
[1:21:38] explaining the Antichrist was already
[1:21:40] there
[1:21:41] three
[1:21:42] told that it was backed by our anointed
[1:21:44] ones with back there just like you know
[1:21:46] you know but uh listen all right go to
[1:21:49] Deuteronomy 13.
[1:21:51] verse 1.
[1:21:54] if there arise among you a prophet or a
[1:21:56] dreamer of dreams and give it the a sign
[1:21:58] or a Wonder now listen
[1:22:03] now see we're always based upon the
[1:22:04] bases that if a prophet give you a sign
[1:22:06] and wonder you're supposed to believe it
[1:22:09] all right that's wonderful that's right
[1:22:10] that's true watch the rest of the story
[1:22:12] though
[1:22:13] and the shine are the Wonder come to
[1:22:16] pass
[1:22:17] whereof he spake unto thee saying listen
[1:22:20] let us go after other gods that's it and
[1:22:24] watch
[1:22:25] which thou has not known and let us
[1:22:27] serve them
[1:22:29] now a sign is Wonder come to Pius he
[1:22:31] tells you what's going to take place 30
[1:22:33] people Landing caskets they're all going
[1:22:35] to race in the Dead all right
[1:22:38] all right Gloria Hallelujah we got to
[1:22:39] follow that but what if he's taking you
[1:22:41] to another God you don't want to know
[1:22:43] the God is
[1:22:44] another God is another form of the word
[1:22:47] or what you've taken of your own two
[1:22:49] Souls seven Thunder versus son of man
[1:22:51] River Jordan how many more can we name
[1:22:53] but if one after another God right one
[1:22:56] because they went after another Doctrine
[1:22:58] a word
[1:23:00] you said well you shouldn't talk about
[1:23:02] them
[1:23:03] I'm not talking about nobody I'm talking
[1:23:05] about Doctrine right
[1:23:07] all right but look what he says
[1:23:10] Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of
[1:23:13] that Prophet right or that dreamer of
[1:23:15] dreams for the Lord your God proveth you
[1:23:21] to know whether you love the Lord your
[1:23:24] God with all your heart with all your
[1:23:27] soul
[1:23:29] amen and he does it to prove you right
[1:23:31] he's going to prove you you're going to
[1:23:34] try you I want to go over that verse
[1:23:37] chapter 18 while we had it let's read
[1:23:39] another one
[1:23:46] let's see what it's 18 20.
[1:23:57] but the prophet which shall presume
[1:24:00] oh let's go to verse 19 to seal in what
[1:24:03] I was saying because he's talking about
[1:24:04] a prophet verse 18. I'll raise up the
[1:24:06] prophet among you among the Brethren
[1:24:08] like unto thee and thou will put and I
[1:24:10] will put my words in his mouth and he
[1:24:12] shall speak unto them all that I shall
[1:24:15] command him and it shall come to pass
[1:24:18] that whosoever will not hearken unto my
[1:24:20] words listen which he shall speak in my
[1:24:25] name I will require it of them so if a
[1:24:27] prophet says something you've got to
[1:24:29] believe it if it comes to pass
[1:24:32] amen balaam's prophecy was perfect
[1:24:35] is Doctrine wrong right right
[1:24:39] yep all right so watch now
[1:24:42] but the prophet which shall presume to
[1:24:45] speak a word in my name which I have not
[1:24:48] commanded him to speak
[1:24:51] or that shall speak in the name of other
[1:24:53] gods
[1:24:55] even that Prophet shall die at once
[1:24:58] and if thou say in thine heart
[1:25:02] how shall we know the word which the
[1:25:05] Lord hath not spoken
[1:25:12] he'll give you a shine and come to pass
[1:25:14] he said how
[1:25:18] are we going to know the word in other
[1:25:21] words how we're going to know whether
[1:25:22] prophet's right or not right
[1:25:24] how do you know where brother randoms
[1:25:26] right or not
[1:25:30] there's people that says he said this
[1:25:32] and it ain't come to pass that people
[1:25:34] said he said this and they come to fight
[1:25:35] if people said that he was hunting at
[1:25:37] the wrong date out in Arizona
[1:25:41] that the cloud appeared
[1:25:43] February the 28th which is correct
[1:25:46] and brother Randall wasn't out there
[1:25:47] until March the 8th
[1:25:52] and that's correct
[1:25:57] they can prove it it's correct right
[1:26:11] it's easy I might run a dick though I'll
[1:26:14] put it in my word this Prophet has
[1:26:16] brought me an understanding of opening
[1:26:19] it at least naturally to the Natural
[1:26:22] letter of the word being correct amen
[1:26:24] and right right and no matter what man
[1:26:27] says about him
[1:26:28] I'm not concerned
[1:26:34] condemned him remember for killing game
[1:26:36] for other people he promised the Lord
[1:26:39] but we better read all the promise he
[1:26:40] said Lord I won't kill no game for
[1:26:42] nobody else unless it's an emergency
[1:26:44] right yeah read
[1:26:48] it
[1:26:49] unless there was some reason that was
[1:26:51] needful he would kill the game
[1:26:55] yep amen because I go out and like I
[1:26:57] told in the door but one time he said
[1:26:58] we're getting laid off what are you
[1:26:59] going to do if we run out of money I
[1:27:01] said I got a milk bucket
[1:27:03] and I said my neighbor's got chickens
[1:27:05] unless I got a garden my garden runs out
[1:27:08] my neighbor's chickens runs out I said
[1:27:10] I'll go milk my neighbor's cow so we got
[1:27:13] to live
[1:27:15] and that's above the laws of God on the
[1:27:18] you know the natural lamb things up here
[1:27:20] all right but listen
[1:27:21] and if thou saying thine heart how shall
[1:27:24] we know the word which the Lord has not
[1:27:26] spoken
[1:27:28] Now read the next verse when a prophet
[1:27:31] speaketh in the name of the Lord
[1:27:34] if the thing fall or not
[1:27:37] now he's breaking it down nor come to
[1:27:40] pass that is the thing which the Lord
[1:27:43] hath not spoken but the prophet has
[1:27:46] spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not
[1:27:49] be afraid of him right but what's the
[1:27:52] point that's right God allows anointed
[1:27:55] ones to test you enough amen I gave you
[1:27:58] a couple of quotes after this the word
[1:28:00] brother random is covering that God
[1:28:01] tests you he'll make you sick he said he
[1:28:04] said put you in the hospital he make you
[1:28:05] sick he makes all kind of things happen
[1:28:06] to Christians
[1:28:09] the Lord does that he's got to permit it
[1:28:13] Satan can't get on me
[1:28:16] what do you think kept me well all these
[1:28:18] years
[1:28:20] God didn't let Satan get on me put on me
[1:28:22] what he did on other people all right
[1:28:24] sure
[1:28:26] I'm a first to admit that amen because I
[1:28:30] believe yeah I believe like brother John
[1:28:32] Martin said why can't we pray in years
[1:28:34] we met years ago he said why not pray
[1:28:36] before to keep it away instead of
[1:28:37] waiting till we get it and then pray for
[1:28:39] it
[1:28:40] praise God take care of you
[1:28:46] don't do the right thing you see God
[1:28:49] does things to test you and I am
[1:28:53] about to see whether or not we're going
[1:28:54] to stay with the word amen allow someone
[1:28:57] to come and give you a sign what would
[1:28:59] happen right today
[1:29:01] come on now you'll be just as honest you
[1:29:03] can be of course I try to be
[1:29:05] what would happen to 90 of the people
[1:29:07] this message if some man appeared on the
[1:29:10] scene
[1:29:14] and I'm going to quote you it's already
[1:29:16] to happen so hold on
[1:29:19] the signs and wonders would follow the
[1:29:22] person
[1:29:27] what's 90 of the people this Macy's
[1:29:29] gonna do probably 99.
[1:29:32] they're going to run after it like crazy
[1:29:37] there was a man right after brother
[1:29:40] Branham passed away now I'm quoting from
[1:29:42] what a man said and I've got where I'm
[1:29:45] trying to keep from saying names because
[1:29:47] you know but I can't call the name
[1:29:51] but they went to this man after Brett
[1:29:54] around him and shortly after he passed
[1:29:55] away
[1:29:57] and they went
[1:30:00] a big name in the message
[1:30:03] and sat down to listen to him because he
[1:30:06] had signs and wonders following him
[1:30:09] and they could not argue with him about
[1:30:11] what was taking place
[1:30:14] now that happened somewhere about 1966.
[1:30:23] don't you think Satan will try his best
[1:30:25] to impersonate everything
[1:30:28] what if somebody walked in here today
[1:30:30] and looked like brother random come in
[1:30:41] I'm not picking on nothing I'm telling
[1:30:43] you like it is
[1:30:46] how are you going to check what anybody
[1:30:48] does
[1:30:52] I'm going to take brother Brown's
[1:30:54] message
[1:30:56] and I'm going to sit down and listen to
[1:31:00] it when we're through I'm going to say
[1:31:02] brother what about this
[1:31:06] if he can't take what wrote around and
[1:31:08] said here and put it in what he's saying
[1:31:09] then I'm going to tell him to his face
[1:31:11] he's false
[1:31:15] you're not going to worry about it
[1:31:17] because that's what they've done in the
[1:31:19] days of power
[1:31:21] I'll be glad to see today to come to do
[1:31:24] it why because we got the message to
[1:31:26] check in other words if somebody come
[1:31:29] along you know what run around and talk
[1:31:30] hell's not Eternal well then somebody
[1:31:32] come along now and some big something
[1:31:34] happened somebody looked even like him
[1:31:36] somebody that would have mannerism like
[1:31:38] him or somebody preached like him and
[1:31:39] signs and wonders take place and he said
[1:31:41] when I come here to tell you brother
[1:31:43] round was wrong about that because hell
[1:31:44] is eternal
[1:31:48] something's wrong with your inside
[1:31:51] teacher if you don't get up and say you
[1:31:54] are false
[1:31:55] you mean you do it if I don't do it you
[1:31:58] make me do it I done told you that a man
[1:32:01] comes here and challenges us if I won't
[1:32:03] stand here and accept this challenge in
[1:32:05] him off the word you get me up and you
[1:32:07] throw me up here where he's at right
[1:32:10] I believe that mean it
[1:32:13] I've done stood too long for what this
[1:32:15] message is right for somebody to come
[1:32:17] along with some little 65 something to
[1:32:19] change it right all right that's why I'm
[1:32:21] so hard against all these doctrinal
[1:32:22] issues that come out because they're
[1:32:25] taking you to another God
[1:32:27] that's right they're leading you away
[1:32:29] from that and the inside teacher is what
[1:32:31] it's supposed to teach us amen we were
[1:32:35] sitting up in a certain place and a
[1:32:36] whole row of us
[1:32:38] we're sitting there I won't call the
[1:32:39] place into the names but we're sitting
[1:32:41] there and there's a whole row of
[1:32:43] Believers from here and brother Richard
[1:32:44] Wilson them was sitting there that's
[1:32:46] right and everybody in the building was
[1:32:48] up and down and enjoying and jumping and
[1:32:50] going all except one row
[1:32:52] that's right
[1:32:55] we didn't move a muscle we didn't make a
[1:32:57] scene I guess we was a scene but we
[1:33:00] didn't mean to be you know we just sat
[1:33:02] there because I wasn't going to jump up
[1:33:04] with the rest of them and holler amen
[1:33:05] but I didn't agree with a man
[1:33:07] sure did amen
[1:33:10] why
[1:33:12] we've got the Bible the prophet never
[1:33:15] come to change the Bible
[1:33:18] you come to tell us what it said
[1:33:20] he said well what do you mean tell us
[1:33:22] what it said he come to tell us and
[1:33:24] didn't teach Joe Kennedy right right but
[1:33:27] we said it did
[1:33:31] he didn't change the Bible if I was said
[1:33:34] that just one true and living God
[1:33:37] Church
[1:33:38] through the foolishness of preaching
[1:33:41] wow
[1:33:44] through the foolishness of preaching
[1:33:48] all right
[1:33:50] and what did he do
[1:33:57] the foolishness of preaching God's going
[1:33:59] to save people
[1:34:01] I didn't put that in the Bible
[1:34:05] I didn't make myself a preacher amen
[1:34:07] that's right
[1:34:08] God did
[1:34:12] we have to say in mama called Betty sin
[1:34:14] or Daddy called and Mama sin or
[1:34:16] something like that you know
[1:34:18] and that's what a lot of people do
[1:34:21] and you know what most people I won't
[1:34:23] cover that this evening so you don't
[1:34:24] come back that'd be all right
[1:34:27] I want to talk a little bit about
[1:34:29] of this anointing in a way like this
[1:34:33] you know that most people think that
[1:34:34] preaching the gospel is because they can
[1:34:37] get your attention
[1:34:40] and make you get involved with what
[1:34:43] they're doing
[1:34:47] brother dick you might as I quote
[1:34:48] something from you we were sitting in a
[1:34:52] ministers meeting years ago won't call
[1:34:54] no names or no do it
[1:34:57] we were sitting there in a ministers
[1:34:59] meeting
[1:35:02] brother dick was very young at that time
[1:35:04] and he picked up some
[1:35:07] his brother he got up they announced him
[1:35:09] and they introduced him and he was up
[1:35:11] there and boy he was dressed to achieve
[1:35:13] everything was wonderful you know
[1:35:16] and I I'm wrong we always say whether
[1:35:20] Richard Marlow's best dressed person in
[1:35:21] Luba
[1:35:23] that's not enough against it we'll do
[1:35:25] that but I mean he had everything he had
[1:35:28] to do what he had the Charisma he had
[1:35:30] everything
[1:35:32] huh
[1:35:34] and he started talking
[1:35:37] and he said now now brother Anderson you
[1:35:40] get scripture so Acts 2 38 you get that
[1:35:42] one now now now brother Danny you get
[1:35:44] this one and you get this one and you
[1:35:47] get that one and that's not nothing
[1:35:48] wrong with it no but you know what that
[1:35:51] is that's an involvement involvement how
[1:35:55] you say the word getting you involved
[1:35:58] right see look back there and I see
[1:36:00] brother Carly asleep and I said brother
[1:36:02] Carly stand up and read
[1:36:10] thank you
[1:36:11] everybody thinks that's preaching
[1:36:15] the Antichrist you'll see it there it is
[1:36:17] in John 6 666. never mind
[1:36:22] seen that
[1:36:25] I think they had to cross just go to
[1:36:27] 666.
[1:36:29] that's what really I don't say about
[1:36:30] that brother topped all them things and
[1:36:32] only went out look
[1:36:34] 666. he said man there's something so we
[1:36:38] stopped to get some gas and everything
[1:36:39] that all came up we stopped to get some
[1:36:40] gas and I was putting in gas and I
[1:36:42] didn't look I turned around brother
[1:36:43] house said put another penny in
[1:36:46] put some more guys then why
[1:37:01] when a black cat crosses I try to keep
[1:37:03] running over the cat
[1:37:06] right you want everybody thinks I ain't
[1:37:09] fitting right over the damn cat I ain't
[1:37:10] got no bad problems now you know
[1:37:14] okay
[1:37:15] just getting a point
[1:37:17] all right let me review just a second
[1:37:19] then
[1:37:22] see we believe in anointing
[1:37:27] we believe in the presence of God
[1:37:29] brother Brown would call it and I really
[1:37:31] don't know what it means I'm honest I
[1:37:32] never have been able to find out what he
[1:37:34] called it the August presence
[1:37:37] yeah in some sectors of the country
[1:37:39] August is good this section of the
[1:37:41] country always said hot
[1:37:43] now I don't know what it means maybe
[1:37:45] some of you do because there's a lot of
[1:37:47] things I don't know
[1:37:48] Aaron asked me a question when he first
[1:37:50] come down this way and I couldn't answer
[1:37:52] it and he said brother Dale couldn't
[1:37:54] answer that question well we don't need
[1:37:55] me telling him I could I didn't know
[1:37:57] that
[1:37:58] but listen
[1:38:00] I believe in the presence of God Amen oh
[1:38:03] what a wonderful feeling yeah
[1:38:05] I told you about sitting on that deer
[1:38:08] stand one day boy I was so man
[1:38:13] and I mean down in the middle of
[1:38:15] thousands of Acres of government land
[1:38:18] I was mad at horny
[1:38:21] I said ain't no deer around here nowhere
[1:38:23] and the Lord I asked you to give away
[1:38:25] the deer where I could talk to him and
[1:38:27] you ain't done it yet
[1:38:29] and here I am
[1:38:31] and about that time the prettiest
[1:38:33] perfume you've ever smelled in your life
[1:38:34] come down through them Woods
[1:38:36] and I said now some crazy female is up
[1:38:39] there in the woods popping her puddle
[1:38:41] you know it's brand new look there's
[1:38:42] stuff over with a perfume
[1:38:45] I've got damn went down on the ground
[1:38:47] sat down there crying and arguing and
[1:38:49] fussing Matt is a hornet I guess
[1:38:52] I said my Lord
[1:38:55] I get up
[1:38:58] walk back up to where we's camp
[1:39:01] here comes the truck
[1:39:04] what a great big old deer
[1:39:06] walk out look at us and Donald glad you
[1:39:08] got one he said I didn't get it
[1:39:11] that's my brother-in-law
[1:39:13] he's he got it see God was fulfilling
[1:39:17] his promise to me
[1:39:22] well I was argue and fussion about it
[1:39:26] and smelling his presence
[1:39:30] it's in the Bible
[1:39:32] read your Bible
[1:39:35] I've never done that well maybe you
[1:39:38] ain't prayed enough
[1:39:40] maybe you ain't never got through enough
[1:39:44] but I believe in the presence of God an
[1:39:48] anointed and I believe that anointing
[1:39:51] must be an inside teacher
[1:39:53] but the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:39:56] comes and lives within us
[1:40:00] like I've told you being in God's mind
[1:40:03] before the world is wonderful everybody
[1:40:05] wants to quote that I was in God I don't
[1:40:07] want to be in God's mind before the
[1:40:08] world I want to be part of God's mind
[1:40:13] I can be in his mind to be lost and die
[1:40:15] and go to hell
[1:40:16] because everybody needs mine
[1:40:20] but if I'm part of his mind
[1:40:22] let the mind that was in Christ being
[1:40:25] used you make you a new creature
[1:40:27] you see
[1:40:30] so that inside teacher
[1:40:33] uses the fivefold ministry to speak
[1:40:36] that's right that's got to have the same
[1:40:38] anointing
[1:40:40] to bring it so if they don't they'll
[1:40:42] bring their own ideas
[1:40:47] now
[1:40:49] what would we say in Wednesday and I'll
[1:40:50] close it
[1:40:53] we're bringing it down and got down to
[1:40:56] the time of Solomon and I gave it back
[1:40:59] to you of the dedication message that
[1:41:01] sorry with you
[1:41:02] these are on the internet people can
[1:41:04] pull them up and read them
[1:41:06] where brother random is covering
[1:41:09] how that what happened when Solomon got
[1:41:11] the temple bill
[1:41:13] and when the temple was built he said
[1:41:15] run around says with nothing but
[1:41:17] furniture
[1:41:20] sit first an empty building clean washed
[1:41:23] everything was perfect right he said
[1:41:26] then there's just Furniture put in
[1:41:28] he said just furniture
[1:41:31] I made a statement and I don't know
[1:41:33] where most of you noticed what I said
[1:41:36] I made a statement and right after the
[1:41:37] statement I said you think you've got me
[1:41:40] if you go back to listen to the message
[1:41:42] you'll hear me
[1:41:45] I said you think you've got me
[1:41:47] but you don't
[1:41:49] see I told that the two tables of stone
[1:41:52] where brother Branham said the two
[1:41:54] tables of stone was The Headstone right
[1:41:59] that come into the temple that's what he
[1:42:01] called it the capping stones
[1:42:04] The Ten Commandments that was the two
[1:42:07] tables of stone that was in the Ark of
[1:42:09] the Covenant
[1:42:10] now Moses later in outer Pockets put the
[1:42:13] five books right into that huh
[1:42:17] okay right now
[1:42:21] that
[1:42:22] word brother REM called it the hitch
[1:42:25] time
[1:42:28] but now brother rounds not talking about
[1:42:30] dead letter word or letters on a page
[1:42:32] being a headstone
[1:42:35] it's a live word amen amen that's why I
[1:42:38] wrote around him on it's the
[1:42:41] unveiling God
[1:42:43] he talks about the ten commandments and
[1:42:45] calls it to seals right when those seals
[1:42:49] broke to the prophet they were the Ten
[1:42:50] Commandments
[1:42:52] because blood around said they didn't
[1:42:53] get what they thought when they got the
[1:42:55] Ten Commandments he said they got God in
[1:42:58] letter form
[1:42:59] they thought it was a book of rules I
[1:43:02] shall not and I shall not they got God
[1:43:04] in letter form
[1:43:09] all said the word is spiritual but I'm
[1:43:11] carnal
[1:43:13] in other words my understanding of the
[1:43:15] word is carnal until God quickens that
[1:43:17] word to me amen and once this quickness
[1:43:20] Made Alive
[1:43:22] then it's God
[1:43:24] and I made the statement I said even
[1:43:26] though those two tables of stone in the
[1:43:29] ark came in it was still furniture
[1:43:34] and then we talked about how that when
[1:43:36] it was all finished in the Shekinah
[1:43:37] Glory the prophet said come and fill the
[1:43:40] room and they couldn't minister
[1:43:43] I was questioned a little bit after the
[1:43:45] service about it and
[1:43:46] I made a statement to the person and I
[1:43:48] said well
[1:43:49] you notice I said that you think you got
[1:43:52] me
[1:43:54] I said that's not true
[1:43:57] see it would have took so long to I had
[1:43:59] to preach this message to be able to
[1:44:01] explain it so there was no way to do it
[1:44:03] Wednesday all right
[1:44:04] now listen
[1:44:06] I know the Bible I don't mean that I
[1:44:08] know everything about it get off of that
[1:44:11] I mean I know the Bible what I looked it
[1:44:13] up okay
[1:44:14] that means I looked it up everybody said
[1:44:17] I know the Bible that means they know no
[1:44:19] I can't even quote John 3 16. that's it
[1:44:23] I ain't lying do you you tell me this is
[1:44:25] the quote to you the Lord's Prayer and I
[1:44:26] probably wouldn't get it correct because
[1:44:28] I never tried to memorize the Bible
[1:44:31] I tried to read the Bible to see what
[1:44:33] it's saying to me right Joy of it with
[1:44:36] the prophet's message
[1:44:37] read it to see what it says do you don't
[1:44:40] try to memorize it you're tying up your
[1:44:42] brain and memory you need your brain for
[1:44:45] the Holy Spirit to do it and I've
[1:44:46] noticed in life not a look at her today
[1:44:47] but we need our brain baptized I said
[1:44:50] Glory
[1:44:52] need our brains baptizing that's what we
[1:44:54] need but now listen
[1:45:01] when those two tables of stone came in
[1:45:02] that Temple
[1:45:08] I want to ask you a simple question
[1:45:12] the anointing failed right the Shekinah
[1:45:15] Glory King filled a room that they
[1:45:17] couldn't Minister the Bible do we need
[1:45:19] to read it do you read around and need
[1:45:21] to read it there in a second chronicles
[1:45:24] five
[1:45:26] is a little better than Kings is
[1:45:29] actually explained
[1:45:32] but it filled the temple
[1:45:35] all right
[1:45:36] now where did that anointing come from
[1:45:42] what do you mean brother they only just
[1:45:44] come down out of the sky did it come
[1:45:46] down out of the sky
[1:45:48] or did they come out of that Arc with a
[1:45:51] cubed that's all I want to know
[1:45:54] sure did he come out of that Ark of the
[1:45:56] Covenant
[1:45:59] or did it come something out of the
[1:46:01] Skies it feels like rain falling down
[1:46:05] I said you'd misunderstand me
[1:46:08] because you think I don't believe in
[1:46:10] something happening I don't believe that
[1:46:11] I believe that she kind of Glory was all
[1:46:13] over the place falling down but where
[1:46:15] did it come from
[1:46:21] coach you better remember that's why I
[1:46:22] said if you
[1:46:25] that's why I said I know what the Bible
[1:46:27] said go back over and read Exodus
[1:46:30] 30 of Exodus 40.
[1:46:34] and you'll find that when Moses got that
[1:46:38] Tabernacle in the wilderness finished
[1:46:41] everything was okay you remember they
[1:46:44] could work in there
[1:46:46] they could do
[1:46:47] but all at once
[1:46:49] when that Ark of the covenants was
[1:46:53] established and put in there
[1:46:54] they had to back out
[1:46:57] Moses the man that made the temple
[1:47:01] backed out
[1:47:03] and nobody could go behind her but the
[1:47:07] high priest
[1:47:08] after that word found its place in that
[1:47:12] Tabernacle in the wilderness the tent
[1:47:14] right see the one in Chronicles is the
[1:47:17] the Solomon building the natural Temple
[1:47:20] she was coming to a greater time right
[1:47:22] it doesn't say in Exodus 40
[1:47:26] that the Shekinah Glory come down and
[1:47:29] all of these things let's read it we'll
[1:47:30] make sure we won't miss it let's go to
[1:47:32] Exodus 40. so you won't miss what I'm
[1:47:35] saying
[1:47:44] so if you save time to read him coming
[1:47:46] down to get looking for 31 and Moses and
[1:47:48] Aaron his sons washed their hands and
[1:47:51] their feet are up
[1:47:53] when they went into the tent of the
[1:47:55] congregation and when they came near
[1:47:57] unto the altar they washed as the Lord
[1:47:59] commanded Moses now remember you could
[1:48:01] come in there so far
[1:48:04] right you know only the high priest
[1:48:07] could go behind the veil right
[1:48:09] see once it was made all right what and
[1:48:12] he reared up the court round about the
[1:48:14] Tabernacle and the Altar and set up the
[1:48:17] hang of the court so Moses finished the
[1:48:20] work
[1:48:21] now watch
[1:48:24] then a cloud covered the tent of the
[1:48:27] congregation
[1:48:28] and the Lord filled the Tabernacle right
[1:48:33] and Moses was not able to enter into the
[1:48:36] tent of the congregation because the
[1:48:37] cloud Abode upon and the glory of the
[1:48:39] Lord sealed the Tabernacle right all
[1:48:42] right and when the cloud was taken up
[1:48:44] from the Tabernacle the children of
[1:48:46] Israel went onward in their Journey but
[1:48:48] as the cloud were not taken up then they
[1:48:51] journeyed not till the day that it would
[1:48:53] take an up and it was a cloud by that
[1:48:56] day and a pillar of Fire by night next
[1:48:58] to our truck he'll get one saying
[1:49:01] when that Temple was finished back there
[1:49:04] with Moses the cloud came down
[1:49:11] come to honor the word
[1:49:13] but it doesn't say they couldn't
[1:49:14] minister they could do this because that
[1:49:16] cloud would raise up
[1:49:19] out from inside the Tabernacle
[1:49:23] and it would go off and they'd have to
[1:49:24] follow it that's what Moses followed
[1:49:26] nobody else didn't see it he said okay
[1:49:28] pack up let's go
[1:49:30] the cloud says move
[1:49:32] nobody else didn't see it
[1:49:34] Moses was the only one solitude
[1:49:38] Pillar of Fire would be there at night
[1:49:40] when it hovered in one place they camped
[1:49:42] get what I'm talking about the
[1:49:46] when they come over there we'll Solomon
[1:49:49] inside of that
[1:49:50] Ark of the Covenant
[1:49:53] develop the presence of the Lord
[1:49:57] the cloud
[1:49:58] the pillar of Fire
[1:50:03] dwelt better
[1:50:05] word of the anointing come from
[1:50:10] out of there
[1:50:12] uh so I'm gonna ask you one more
[1:50:15] question
[1:50:17] where's the anointing at now see you ate
[1:50:19] maybe up to now let's see if you thought
[1:50:21] of me where's your anointing at man
[1:50:23] it's inside of you amen amen right all
[1:50:28] right
[1:50:29] but that don't mean he can't come out
[1:50:31] here at enormous
[1:50:32] and feel his presence and walk and see
[1:50:35] things and open our eyes to things
[1:50:38] speak to us
[1:50:42] but let me see I could preach another
[1:50:44] couple hours but I won't
[1:50:47] Elijah was an Acadian one day and he
[1:50:50] heard Thunders and Lightnings and
[1:50:51] flashings and all kind of things
[1:50:55] and he wouldn't get up and walk out
[1:50:59] is that true
[1:51:01] and all at once was still a small voice
[1:51:03] from inside of him
[1:51:06] spoke
[1:51:08] he got up and walked out
[1:51:10] because he knew that was God now he
[1:51:14] didn't even have a new birth that's it
[1:51:15] right there man
[1:51:17] all right
[1:51:18] but he could be led of God Amen he could
[1:51:22] be anointed come on Amen but he didn't
[1:51:24] have the new bird that's right
[1:51:27] think about that all right Hallelujah
[1:51:31] see great things can happen to a person
[1:51:34] that's not born again that's right
[1:51:35] that's right
[1:51:37] but the revealing of the word is what I
[1:51:39] want amen come on
[1:51:41] revealing of the word is what I want
[1:51:44] the anointing
[1:51:46] that anointed that now let me give you
[1:51:49] one life one that's on the last page of
[1:51:51] your notes number 19. Daniel 70 weeks
[1:51:54] brother random says when the bride rides
[1:51:56] back into the millennial Reign
[1:51:58] fulfilling Revelation when at 19 I
[1:52:00] believe it is where she couldn't worth
[1:52:02] it if you come back to the millennial
[1:52:03] Reign he said the anointing is up on
[1:52:07] them right amen
[1:52:10] thank you the anointing is upon them
[1:52:15] it's not to come from somewhere else
[1:52:17] it's inside of you that's the only way I
[1:52:20] know what the truth is is whatever's
[1:52:22] inside of me tells me whatever has kept
[1:52:24] me from following these doctrines enough
[1:52:26] you know where it's at it's inside of me
[1:52:27] it's not up here in this head because
[1:52:29] this head runs Haywire over doctrinal
[1:52:32] issues
[1:52:34] but inside of me something says that's
[1:52:36] not right amen
[1:52:41] how can I argue with these people
[1:52:44] that's not right
[1:52:48] and I'll finish it because you'll think
[1:52:50] it's a wrong statement but I believe it
[1:52:52] how is it that I tell you to check a
[1:52:54] Doctrine
[1:52:56] how do I check a Doctrine how do you
[1:52:59] check a doctor brother Dale buy my new
[1:53:02] birth
[1:53:06] that's right because that's the only way
[1:53:08] you're gonna know where it's right or
[1:53:09] not
[1:53:11] it's my Year New Birth understand

[1:53:21] where I said that's furniture
[1:53:24] meaning it was a word but now we see
[1:53:27] right out of that word right out of that
[1:53:29] comes the anointing
[1:53:32] right out of there is where that
[1:53:33] anointing comes for the whole County
[1:53:35] amen if we could have seen it it would
[1:53:37] have just been that color of Fire coming
[1:53:38] up the cloud because the cloud was in
[1:53:41] there and it just went up and then it
[1:53:43] come down and just baptized everybody
[1:53:45] right
[1:53:47] where was that anointing at it was
[1:53:48] inside of Jesus

[1:53:52] death Pentecost and just anointed it and
[1:53:55] fulfilled Joel see I've got all these
[1:53:57] scriptures things written down but I
