[6:32] Revelation one the revelation of Jesus
[6:35] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[6:38] unto his servants things which must
[6:39] shortly come to pass and he s and
[6:41] signified it by his Angel and to his
[6:43] servant John who by record of the word
[6:46] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[6:48] and of all things that he sought blessed
[6:50] is he that readeth and they that hear
[6:52] the words of this prophecy and keep
[6:54] those things which are written therein
[6:56] why for the time is at hand the time to
[6:59] what time to understand is at hand now
[7:03] Revelations
[7:05] 20:7 and when the thousand years are
[7:08] expired Satan shall be loosed out of his
[7:11] prison and he shall go out to deceive
[7:13] the Nations which are in the four
[7:15] quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to
[7:19] gather them together to battle the
[7:21] number of whom is as the sand of the sea
[7:24] and they went upon the breath of the
[7:25] earth and compassed the camp of the
[7:27] Saints about and the below City and fire
[7:32] came down from God out of heaven and
[7:34] divided them you may be seated the Lord
[7:37] at his Blessing to the reading of the
[7:40] word
[7:43] that we were all life in this morning
[7:46] the brothers have an excuse if all the
[7:49] mechanical stuff they can blame their
[7:51] mistakes today on the mechanical because
[7:55] you know there did do so much and there
[7:56] is so much in here you wouldn't realize
[7:59] what it would take to uh you know to uh
[8:05] do something like just changing simple
[8:07] and putting in a few cameras and things
[8:09] but Richard has been well acquainted
[8:12] with the attic and anybody that's ever
[8:15] got up in there you don't want to be up
[8:18] in there you're on your belly Carling on
[8:21] shingles on other ceilings but we do we
[8:24] thank everybody for all of the doings
[8:26] and and the things that they've done and
[8:29] I was up here and we pulled I know over
[8:31] 30 cables are pulled back from the front
[8:34] to the back so that meant all them trips
[8:37] making backwards and forth but just
[8:39] remember that now all right now we tried
[8:42] this past Wednesday night we jumped over
[8:44] just a little and and we were at you
[8:47] know back over on the millennial rain
[8:50] there this past uh
[8:52] weekend and then we came over into the
[8:56] white Throne judgment just kind of
[8:58] getting a a line up in the Book of
[9:00] Revelations and uh now we're dropping in
[9:03] to pick
[9:04] up uh you know a point here that we want
[9:08] to cover one more thing and then we'll
[9:11] drop into the the Lord willingness
[9:14] coming Wednesday we will start on
[9:16] Revelations 21 and the the you know the
[9:20] the future we'll get a little bit of it
[9:22] today but not much but I want you to
[9:26] think about these
[9:27] things this past Wednesday I guess it
[9:31] was was when we were covering the white
[9:33] Throne judgment and we believe firmly
[9:36] that the Bride of Jesus Christ does not
[9:39] stand before the white Throne judgment
[9:41] why would you have the new birth and
[9:43] receive eternal life here right you know
[9:47] and then have to go there and be judged
[9:50] right no we judged ourselves guilty amen
[9:54] we judged ourselves to be lost amen we'
[9:58] seen that point and we then repented we
[10:03] asked God to forgive us and he gave us
[10:06] his own Spirit gave us eternal life then
[10:09] that way those with eternal life will
[10:11] not be standing before the white throne
[10:15] but they will be sitting with him on the
[10:17] throne because that we took the Book of
[10:19] Daniel and comparing it and I hope you
[10:22] enjoyed that with kind of into the Book
[10:25] of Revelations about the white throne
[10:27] and how that you can just read one thing
[10:30] a lot of times in the
[10:32] Bible and and it won't give
[10:35] you an overall view all right then you
[10:38] turn over to another scripture that is
[10:41] that same event or point and and and
[10:45] then you'll see Parts there right that
[10:48] maybe won't give you an overall view so
[10:50] then but you put them both together and
[10:52] I hope that was a a understanding to you
[10:56] there taking the Book of Daniel cuz
[10:58] brother randam said The Book of Daniel
[11:00] is actually the Book of Revelations of
[11:02] the Old Testament because what you cover
[11:04] in the Book of Revelations about the
[11:07] Beast and the Rome and the you know the
[11:10] dragon the different thing you just go
[11:12] back and read the book of of Daniel
[11:15] right amen and it'll tell you all about
[11:17] those things and who they are and the
[11:19] mees of Persians and the Greeks and the
[11:22] the things coming down to you know uh
[11:26] give us an understanding of the day and
[11:28] hour hour We're living to me uh just
[11:31] like John going to patmas and was there
[11:34] for two years writing the Book of
[11:36] Revelations well it doesn't say how long
[11:38] Daniel was necessarily in writing but it
[11:41] would take a good bit because he was
[11:43] having a continual dreams or visions or
[11:47] experiences and it would be over a long
[11:49] period of time but when you see the two
[11:51] put together you can see a beautiful
[11:53] picture amen one will say one thing the
[11:56] other will say the other one speak of
[11:59] the both of them speaks of like the the
[12:03] uh books but then one speaks of The Book
[12:07] of Life or the other one does not speak
[12:09] of it well then it's bringing it uh to a
[12:12] position of of understanding you know
[12:16] where we're at and and all that so just
[12:19] take that message and try to study on it
[12:21] but then we wanted to lay in one more
[12:24] thought of speaking about the what we've
[12:29] read here and it says after the thousand
[12:33] years is finished then Satan's loose for
[12:36] a little season amen all right now how
[12:39] long that'll be you can argue the point
[12:43] you can talk about well they can have
[12:45] another world and another people and
[12:47] another group or another things but I I
[12:50] searched as much as I could and I found
[12:52] a couple of places where the Prophet
[12:54] talks about it as it being actually the
[12:58] him loosen together his subjects y now
[13:03] he can't raise the
[13:04] dead but when he sees the dead being
[13:07] raised come to the general Resurrection
[13:09] as we would call it the resurrection at
[13:11] the end time going to the white Throne
[13:13] judgment and when he sees that then
[13:15] immediately he will be loosed himself
[13:18] from the chain of circumstances that's
[13:20] holding him right not a log chain cuz
[13:23] you can't do that with the devil you
[13:24] can't put him in a cubicle and lock him
[13:26] up cuz he's a spirit right all right but
[13:29] you can God chains him with a chain of
[13:32] circumstances there's nobody there he
[13:34] can work through that's right what about
[13:35] a thousand years on Earth of the
[13:39] millennial Reigns without Satan being
[13:43] there amen as I said to you there they
[13:45] have what they call the post millennial
[13:47] they have the premillennial and they
[13:49] have the a millennial you know on the
[13:52] the teachings of the millennial Reign
[13:55] but if you had it back there then where
[13:58] was Satan B
[13:59] right oh of course the Catholic church
[14:03] that has what would be known as the
[14:06] premillennial the Catholic Church
[14:08] believe that Satan was bound cuz they
[14:10] ruled the world for over a thousand
[14:12] years there of the Dark Ages and things
[14:15] that they could just kill and all that I
[14:17] I just don't believe the Millennium has
[14:19] come yet no I'm just honest because my
[14:21] reading of the Bible seems to make it to
[14:24] where that that even the the lamb and
[14:27] the lion would lay down together
[14:28] together and you know a child could put
[14:30] his hand on a on a real deadly Serpent's
[14:34] y Nest or hole or whatever you know and
[14:37] it wouldn't hurt him well I don't think
[14:40] that's happening yet so then I'm looking
[14:43] forward to a millennial rain and we
[14:45] found that it would be to the bride of
[14:47] Christ the
[14:49] honeymoon all right the honeymoon what a
[14:52] time to learn more about him
[14:55] amen I hope you enjoyed those points I
[14:58] was trying to to make about that because
[15:00] that's the way I think about it a
[15:02] honeymoon is where a man and his wife
[15:04] learn each other you know you find out
[15:07] what you want to eat you find out what
[15:10] you want to do or where you want to go
[15:11] or whatever this out there on your
[15:13] honeymoon and that way it'll be a
[15:16] thousand years of learning but you know
[15:17] what then we can take that right back to
[15:19] the people right that are there in the
[15:22] Millenium right and we can tell them
[15:24] about what he is amen be a wonderful
[15:27] time it's not going to be just no you
[15:29] know well we're going to put up there
[15:30] and play
[15:31] Harps we we we we I I ain't no good at
[15:34] playing music right you know and I would
[15:37] be at a disadvantage to you that can
[15:39] play but I don't mind sitting by and
[15:42] listening to somebody play good amen but
[15:44] I hate for somebody to you know it be
[15:47] like brother uh durett and brother uh
[15:51] perky was doing that time when it was
[15:54] brother perky was on the piano and
[15:55] brother durett was on the guitar vice
[15:57] versa and one of them said to the other
[15:59] one play a tune he
[16:01] went he's trying to find it on the piano
[16:03] and he said well give me another
[16:06] cord he said what are you doing he said
[16:08] I'm just frailing it said I I don't know
[16:10] about playing well that's the way I'd be
[16:13] and if you put me in heaven I wouldn't
[16:15] know no more about
[16:16] it I think we're going to have a
[16:18] wonderful time right here on this Earth
[16:20] amen that's right see to where we can
[16:23] have a time of peace with Satan bound
[16:27] amen but then he's loose
[16:29] for a little season the Bible says after
[16:33] the thousand years we just read is
[16:35] expired then he's Loos a little season
[16:38] all right he'll go forth and try to
[16:40] gather and he's going to try one more
[16:42] time to be able to conquer God he comes
[16:46] up around the city and and the the
[16:48] Saints and he won't be able to conquer
[16:50] that's right he'll done be defeated and
[16:52] he'll be destroyed and that's what'll
[16:54] happen here as we get into what is
[16:57] called go and M OG now there's a lot
[17:00] about that that people want to believe
[17:02] that it's this country and that country
[17:05] and we'll read in a minute where that it
[17:06] it basically would deal with
[17:09] Russia but remember Russia is not the
[17:14] whole
[17:16] world you're going to have to get a
[17:18] different
[17:19] idea because Russia's not the doing and
[17:23] what is causing the battle of
[17:26] Armageddon is Satan and is forces trying
[17:29] to come against the word of God and the
[17:32] people of God which is going on right
[17:34] now in a spiritual sense in you and I
[17:37] but then when we leave out of here
[17:39] there'll be a tribulation period as we
[17:41] call it Daniel's
[17:42] troubles for three and a half years and
[17:45] as that's going
[17:47] on the Antichrist is going to come forth
[17:51] and make his Covenant with Israel the
[17:54] natural Nation but he won't make his
[17:56] Covenant with 144,000 cuz they won't
[17:58] have anything to do with it they'll be
[18:00] out of it so it's going to be a a Time
[18:02] coming that Satan can do but then when a
[18:05] thousand years come see he's bound he's
[18:07] removed from the ability to be able to
[18:10] deceive anybody well I don't believe
[18:13] when he's loosed over there at the end
[18:15] after the the Millennium is over with
[18:18] we'll read in a minute the prophet said
[18:20] I don't believe he'll be able to go
[18:21] forth and do much deceiving to me it's
[18:25] just a point that he's he's Gathering
[18:27] his subjects to make one more
[18:31] battle you say well that could take
[18:33] millions of years of time I'm not
[18:35] worried about it because I'm going to be
[18:37] Eternal in uh we're already by then the
[18:40] bride will have lived already through
[18:42] the millennial reain she's done been in
[18:44] glory she's done rode back with him done
[18:47] had a honeymoon we're not going to be
[18:49] worried about it but why are you worried
[18:51] about it is that all you can get what
[18:53] your thoughts can be well you know that
[18:55] could start a whole new world system all
[18:57] over again and all this that and why not
[18:59] just take what the prophet said he
[19:00] gathers his subjects on the second
[19:03] Resurrection we'll read that in a minute
[19:05] that's what he says about it he didn't
[19:07] say go forth and and and bring all this
[19:10] nation to this nation and get what I'm
[19:12] saying it will deal with go and Magog as
[19:15] we're looking at
[19:17] Russia as we call Russia Gog and Magog
[19:20] because of the and that's
[19:22] fine but just remember the whole
[19:26] world is involved in this
[19:29] just as I was saying the battle of
[19:32] Armageddon will be the whole world
[19:34] coming together to fight
[19:36] Israel but see we want to make it to
[19:39] King of the North and it it'll works
[19:40] because that's fine if you want to read
[19:43] Ezekiel 38 and 39 you can really I just
[19:46] reading it this morning looking back at
[19:48] it and that
[19:50] is that battle coming forth of Gog and
[19:54] Magog you know just read it and you'll
[19:57] see but remember read reading it you're
[19:59] reading of what they say back there that
[20:01] there's going to be horses and chariots
[20:03] and and and all
[20:06] no ain't too many armies today needs
[20:09] horses and chariots they need horsepower
[20:12] for running their equipment and and you
[20:14] know and they need chariots which is
[20:17] tanks
[20:19] and Humvees and and jet airplanes and
[20:23] stuff like that so when you're reading
[20:25] the Bible sometimes you got to pick it
[20:27] up from where it is and what it's saying
[20:29] M Ezekiel I believe it was what was it
[20:32] he saw fire falling down out of heaven
[20:35] we see everybody thanks God one of he
[20:37] days he going to run and he will that's
[20:38] fine but what about a nuclear
[20:42] destruction right you realize right now
[20:45] I mean when I was a kid in school they
[20:47] was afraid that they were going to make
[20:48] a hydrogen bomb because they had already
[20:50] fooled with and broke the split the atom
[20:53] and and the things and they were afraid
[20:55] that a hydrogen bomb would set the whole
[20:57] world off mhm you know well they've got
[21:00] bombs way beyond that now you know
[21:03] that's dire just waiting and what would
[21:06] happen if one country just pushes a
[21:09] button a it can't happen it can't happen
[21:12] till the bride gets out of here but
[21:14] after then as you're left at the mercy
[21:16] that's right all right but let's let's
[21:18] get down to it now and think about
[21:22] it this Gog and
[21:24] Magog but I want to I want to get this
[21:27] to an of events I like to do it this way
[21:30] so let's go ahead with number one and if
[21:33] we have trouble throwing things up you
[21:34] forgive us because we're still in the
[21:37] playing stage of the brothers back there
[21:39] to to be able to bring up what we need
[21:43] we look what the prophet of God says
[21:45] questions and answers reel number 4
[21:49] 64830 the evening service paragraph
[21:52] 75 the church age ended and has blacked
[21:56] out the bride is called we have already
[21:58] entered into the tribulation
[22:00] period I've read this one to you many
[22:03] many times because it gives you an order
[22:04] of events you know and I like that to
[22:07] know what's coming next what to expect
[22:10] all right see somebody was asking they
[22:13] thought they'd already enter the
[22:15] tribulation he says no no
[22:18] no we're not in the tribulation right
[22:22] we're not in the Millennium we're not in
[22:24] but that's man in their ideas no no no I
[22:26] wish that I could just have more time on
[22:28] that see the bride now he's going to
[22:31] give you a series of
[22:33] events I I love this quote so it'd be
[22:35] good to write it down stick it in your
[22:37] Bible and keep it with you cuz then if
[22:39] you want to know something brother Rand
[22:41] will be talking he say if I don't see
[22:43] you anymore I'll see at the future home
[22:45] the next thing is the future home well
[22:48] that's not
[22:50] right that's not right you said well are
[22:52] you correcting him no he don't have to
[22:54] be corrected he corrects his own self
[22:59] because he gives you the series of
[23:01] events the future home is not the next
[23:03] thing the next thing from now is the
[23:05] rapture of the
[23:07] church the next thing is not the
[23:11] tribulation we got to get out of here
[23:12] before the tribulation comes cuz the
[23:15] bride don't go through the
[23:17] tribulation she don't sit at the white
[23:19] she don't have to stand before the white
[23:20] Throne judgment she don't have to be
[23:22] judged she don't have to have a
[23:23] tribulation to make her perfect right
[23:27] we're perfect through the blood of Jesus
[23:29] Christ
[23:31] amen not through some purging we have to
[23:34] go through you say yeah but this over
[23:36] well didn't what do you
[23:39] think what do you think about it the
[23:42] bride when she's taken from the church
[23:45] then the church age will cease and the
[23:48] church age don't cease until we get out
[23:49] of here people say today the church age
[23:52] is over I show me where it's at I know
[23:54] the quote you're talking
[23:56] about but see you're taking a quote and
[23:59] you're killing yourself with
[24:01] it to the church a you still here the
[24:03] lady seeing Church a time goes on in the
[24:06] Millennium they have a thousand years of
[24:08] Earthly time right come on lady oia goes
[24:12] into chaos the bride goes to glory and
[24:15] the tribulation period sets in upon the
[24:17] slooping virgins for three and A2 years
[24:20] while Israel is getting its
[24:22] prophecy that's simple just following it
[24:25] through the Book of Revelations then
[24:27] tribulation and sets it upon in upon
[24:30] Israel then comes the battle of
[24:33] Armageddon all right which destroys all
[24:36] things and then the bride returns back
[24:38] with the groom for a thousand years the
[24:40] millennial Reign after that comes the
[24:43] white Throne judgment after that comes
[24:45] the new heavens and the new Earth the
[24:49] new city coming down from God out of
[24:51] Heaven eternity and time Blends together
[24:53] all right now the only thing that he
[24:55] left out of it was the battle of
[24:58] Gog and
[25:01] Magog
[25:02] right so he gave you the order of events
[25:05] so if you ever want to know what's
[25:06] coming next just read the book that's
[25:08] right mainly just think with common
[25:12] sense see if we go out of here in the
[25:14] Rapture right now that's not the end of
[25:17] the world right you got to have your
[25:20] Jews called
[25:22] out see as long as he's dealing here
[25:24] you're not dealing over there you flat
[25:27] don't want to be here when he's dealing
[25:29] with Israel cuz that means you missed it
[25:32] you'd be one of the foolish
[25:34] virgins that they're going to have to be
[25:36] Purge and give their life all right but
[25:40] now think about
[25:44] it Rapture of the Bride tribulation sets
[25:48] in Armageddon comes Millennium
[25:52] [Music]
[25:55] comes all right Satan's looks a little
[25:59] season and Gog and Magog will take
[26:04] place then the future home will come
[26:07] down in chapter 21 right all right so
[26:11] we're going through the Book of
[26:12] Revelations to try to tie it together
[26:16] and and to to get an understanding then
[26:18] I told you and announced it the way
[26:20] ahead that we're going to enter a series
[26:23] after this and a couple of more
[26:25] messages maybe a month from now
[26:28] but we're going to get into a topic
[26:30] called marriage and divorce and we're
[26:31] going to cover what a wedding wedding is
[26:34] what a what a divorce is and the things
[26:36] like that from the scriptures amen and
[26:38] then we'll take that through the series
[26:40] okay but now listen why is Satan looed
[26:44] so go ahead to number two and let's just
[26:46] read what the prophet had to say why is
[26:48] Satan loose for a little
[26:50] season that's after the Millennium
[26:55] now Satan's loose for a little season
[26:57] season why will Satan be loose a little
[27:00] season after the Thousand Years of
[27:01] Revelation 20 and 3 and Revelation 20
[27:04] and 27 that's really 20 and7 because
[27:06] there is no 27 all right why will he be
[27:10] loosed is to gather up his people on the
[27:13] second
[27:15] Resurrection cuz Satan has to stand the
[27:18] Judgment also he has to be condemned now
[27:22] you say well that automatically throws
[27:23] away what you said the other day when I
[27:25] said Satan don't have to go to the white
[27:27] on judgment cuz he doesn't the Bible
[27:29] tells you he's casting the Lake of Fire
[27:31] before the white Throne judgment because
[27:33] Satan's not a
[27:35] man he's an Angelic being amen right
[27:39] sure he'll be judged we will even judge
[27:41] Angels Paul says they're in Corinthians
[27:45] right but Satan's not a man like we are
[27:48] so he can be throwed in there ahead of
[27:51] time all right now what
[27:54] happens he gathers his people on the
[27:56] second Resurrection that's said there's
[27:57] no way now he's saying that that Satan
[27:59] can raise the dead right now come on but
[28:04] he gathers the people when he sees the
[28:06] people he's loose and when he sees the
[28:08] people beginning together to go the
[28:11] resurrection starts taking place right
[28:15] and brother R said there The Sinner will
[28:17] be judged in the body that he lived in
[28:19] amen right so Resurrection to him is not
[28:23] replacement that's right why would we
[28:26] even say we're going to get a new
[28:28] body when Jesus raised with nail prints
[28:31] in his hands the Bible says why we want
[28:34] to talk about getting a new body of
[28:36] course we smoke and we drink and say
[28:38] well he can't redeem this
[28:40] one well did he redeem your soul amen
[28:44] right it's not the body that's the
[28:46] problem it's the
[28:47] soul right the body is useless without
[28:50] the Soul and Spirit to correct or guide
[28:52] it and Lead it see come on just being
[28:55] sensible amen all right
[28:58] so he's loosed together his
[29:02] people I read you one day the other day
[29:04] where he said that his that his people
[29:06] is in
[29:09] hell so when they come up out of hell
[29:12] when everything comes up in the
[29:13] resurrection and starts up towards the
[29:15] white Throne Satan's going to
[29:17] immediately jump in and say I got it now
[29:19] I got I I just had a few people back
[29:22] under now I got billions of trillions of
[29:24] trillions of people surely I can come
[29:29] God but he won't be able to do
[29:32] that he won't be able to do that all
[29:34] right look at the next
[29:37] one this is questions and answers on the
[29:40] seals 63 324 the morning service
[29:43] paragraph 340 through
[29:47] 341 I think that's right would you
[29:50] explain please explain about Satan being
[29:53] bound a thousand years and being loose
[29:54] for the battle of the battle of
[29:56] Revelations 20 8 which is Armageddon we
[29:59] I mean Gog and Magog we just read all
[30:01] right what relationship does this have
[30:03] with the battle of
[30:04] Armageddon what relationship does Gog
[30:08] and Magog have to do with Armageddon as
[30:11] mentioned in the four seal will Gog and
[30:13] Magog be gathered from the people of the
[30:15] new Earth see he's going well on over
[30:18] who's asking the question well this is
[30:20] alone and I'll just try to hit the spots
[30:22] all
[30:23] right would you please explain how Satan
[30:26] is bound a thousand years and being
[30:28] loosed again for the Battle of
[30:30] Revelation 208 all
[30:33] right this is not the battle of
[30:35] Armageddon Revelations 208 is not the
[30:37] battle of
[30:38] Armageddon all right Armageddon is on
[30:42] this side of the Millennium we're going
[30:44] to read it Gog and Magog is on the other
[30:47] side of the Millennium read your Bible
[30:50] it's in perfect order you don't juggle
[30:52] the books and say this comes before that
[30:54] this comes before that that's what we've
[30:56] tried to do do read it as it comes
[31:01] forth and see what it fits in it it'll
[31:04] stays in perfect order all
[31:07] right see this is not the battle of
[31:10] Armageddon the battle of Armageddon
[31:11] takes place on this side what on this
[31:13] side of the Millennium see all right at
[31:16] the when the tribulation period is ended
[31:17] because that's
[31:19] Armageddon now what relation does this
[31:22] have to do with the Battle of go and
[31:24] bega none What relation does armag get
[31:27] and things how none none one is this
[31:30] thousand years the other one is end of
[31:33] the the end of the Thousand Years one's
[31:35] on one side of the Thousand other's on
[31:36] the other
[31:38] self-explanatory all right says as
[31:40] mentioned see Satan was loosed out of
[31:42] his prison and went together all of the
[31:46] people the wicked to bring them to this
[31:50] place and God Reigns down fire and
[31:52] brimstone out of heaven and they were
[31:55] consumed see two battles all together
[31:57] all right Armageddon is one battle
[32:00] before the Millennium comes Gog and
[32:02] Magog is the battle after the Millennium
[32:05] takes place all right so then you're
[32:07] getting it for the correct order see
[32:10] putting it in order to understand that's
[32:12] the reason I wanted to make
[32:14] sure
[32:17] now in
[32:19] Armageddon it'd be a drastic
[32:21] destruction of the
[32:24] world but we'll get down in just a
[32:26] minute that's what mankind has always
[32:28] looked at the world being
[32:31] annihilated the world's not going to be
[32:34] annihilated right contrary to all the
[32:37] denominationalism teachings that's right
[32:39] amen because John saw the holy
[32:42] city coming down out of
[32:47] Heaven All Right Now where's it going
[32:51] right see we spent all of our time
[32:53] trying to see how we can get up to
[32:55] heaven the Bible tells you that he saw
[32:58] it coming down out of
[33:01] Heaven see this world will never be
[33:04] annihilated amen that's
[33:07] right all right to prove it now I want
[33:09] you to if you will by Wednesday to
[33:12] listen or read as much as you can on the
[33:15] message that is called the future home
[33:19] all right see then that way I won't have
[33:22] to do I'll just skim across the top of
[33:24] it and go on into what I want to say
[33:27] cuz I don't want to cover the future
[33:28] home the prophet has covered it I want
[33:30] to take the scriptures and just go
[33:32] through 21 and 22 all right so if you
[33:36] will read the future home or listen to
[33:38] the tape but now listen
[33:42] Armageddon Satan is
[33:46] bound he can't work
[33:50] right a perfect 1,000 years of peace
[33:53] upon
[33:54] Earth but there's things there that will
[33:56] never be in the future home that's
[34:00] right all right because it's two
[34:03] different events
[34:05] amen the M the Thousand-Year Millennium
[34:08] is not the future home it's right here
[34:10] on Earth
[34:12] right then the future home will come
[34:14] down Revelations 21 and
[34:16] 22 all right now in doing that then what
[34:21] I want you to think
[34:23] about Satan is bound during the
[34:28] you know Armageddon comes
[34:30] forth and
[34:33] he's killing the people doing what he
[34:35] can do working through mankind but then
[34:37] he gets
[34:38] bound all right now he's not
[34:42] destroyed right he's bound and then the
[34:46] Bible says he's loose for a little
[34:47] season so he's not
[34:50] destroyed but see in the Battle of Gog
[34:52] and
[34:53] Magog that's what we want to think about
[34:56] Russia China this and that the other
[34:58] coming
[34:59] around naturally they will be we're
[35:02] sitting there right
[35:05] now if you want something to do go home
[35:08] get your
[35:10] map and just put your finger on
[35:14] Israel and look around
[35:19] it what countries we don't have control
[35:22] of Russia and China and all those
[35:24] country have control of it is that not
[35:27] what the Bible said was it not what
[35:28] Jesus said he said when you see
[35:30] Jerusalem comp passed about on all sides
[35:34] look up your Redemption draw now all
[35:37] right we can see them sitting there now
[35:40] what far allil for number one that's you
[35:44] got to have oil to
[35:46] operate right it's got to right in that
[35:50] area you say well it's not in Israel
[35:52] they found plenty of oil in Israel and
[35:54] Israel is not letting the world know
[35:55] what they're sitting on
[35:58] that's right they don't have to worry
[35:59] about
[36:00] nobody they're sitting on enough y they
[36:04] captured that place and went over there
[36:06] and you to go over there you think of a
[36:09] desert and a dried up Place sure there's
[36:11] places like that but you ride right down
[36:14] beside the Dead Sea which is ain't
[36:17] nothing but salt you can't even sink in
[36:21] the Dead Sea there's so much consistency
[36:24] of minerals and salt that you can
[36:26] literally just lay out on it and won't
[36:28] go underwater now we've seen people
[36:30] doing
[36:31] it you don't have to worry about
[36:37] floating but if it wasn't for the
[36:41] all as I told you the other day many
[36:43] years ago I read that they captured
[36:45] Kuwait the reason they took Kuwait was
[36:47] for 50 years later they could get an oil
[36:49] pipeline to run through
[36:52] there you think we ain't sitting all
[36:54] around over there waiting we got to have
[36:56] it
[36:58] too but in that Dead
[37:00] Sea there's more minerals and things
[37:04] than anywhere in the
[37:06] world in the Dead Sea you know that all
[37:10] of your mud packs are made
[37:12] from Dead
[37:14] Sea
[37:17] mud all of those
[37:20] things see that's where everybody wants
[37:23] it we got to have some connection so we
[37:26] have to cap a
[37:28] country I why did they go after
[37:31] Kuwait when there was no
[37:34] listings come on there was no listings
[37:36] of any of those terrorists coming from
[37:40] Kuwait is that right right they come
[37:44] from
[37:45] Syria but we didn't jump on
[37:52] Syria that was just a a a blowed up
[37:56] thing to make it look like
[37:58] it we wanted that land we wanted our toe
[38:02] holes
[38:04] there and we've done a good job when you
[38:07] see Jerusalem Compass there's Compass
[38:09] now go over just get a map and look and
[38:13] look at the countries we've got and look
[38:14] at the countries they've got my point is
[38:16] what now see you want to lock it in and
[38:18] say Gog and Magog is just
[38:23] Russia no it's all of the
[38:27] world coming against Jerusalem the holy
[38:33] city it's you and I coming after it too
[38:38] that's it's United States being
[38:41] there no no we're over there to protect
[38:45] them if that's what you believe I want
[38:48] to sell you some stock in Brooklyn
[38:50] Bridge after the servic is over with if
[38:52] you're that mentality is that low we're
[38:55] sitting there
[38:57] because we want that stuff we've got to
[38:59] have it to
[39:01] operate right so we're there W to
[39:04] capture it just get a point but now
[39:07] listen what they don't realize
[39:09] Armageddon see it won't it won't destroy
[39:12] the demons and things
[39:15] right it just makes them where they
[39:17] can't
[39:18] work it Chains Them by Chain of
[39:21] circumstances Satan and his demons is it
[39:24] Satan just bound he's the only one Liv
[39:26] Ed but is it just him bound and the rest
[39:28] of them is loose to torment
[39:31] no he can't give no orders nobody can't
[39:34] go do nothing so all the demons
[39:38] are right in the millennial Reign
[39:41] there's no Devils can work there's no
[39:43] demons no little buddies of Satan that
[39:47] can go out and
[39:50] work so then Gog and Magog I want you to
[39:53] think about it not as a Russia coming
[39:54] down as a China coming down is us coming
[39:57] down and bombs are falling sure that
[39:59] will take place but what I want you to
[40:02] think about is what the prophet said
[40:03] about
[40:04] it that's why I want you to read the
[40:06] future
[40:07] home I want you to just go into the
[40:10] future home and read it and read it to
[40:13] not try to figure out how big the city
[40:18] is come on you know what I'm talking
[40:20] about how much preaching have you heard
[40:22] on the future home most of you have
[40:24] heard on the future future home and
[40:26] trying to do the
[40:30] dimensional come
[40:33] on but let's read what he had to say go
[40:36] ahead to number four and it's quite a
[40:37] reading so if I choose to read a little
[40:40] bit and jump over it just forgive
[40:42] me this is taken from the message called
[40:44] a future home preached in 1964 802 it's
[40:48] about paragraph 170 through
[40:51] 175 all right watch what he
[40:55] says
[40:57] Peter says the heavens will pass
[41:00] away with a great
[41:03] noise you remember that in the scripture
[41:06] but now watch in a minute when we get
[41:07] down to that that word pass away is the
[41:09] same word that when the the world is
[41:11] destroyed you know that that word pass
[41:14] away is the same word used for your
[41:15] baptism of the Holy
[41:19] Ghost when you get the new birth you
[41:21] passed away what from one condition to
[41:24] another one from a sinner to a saint
[41:28] from Lost to Eternal Soul not bodies and
[41:32] Spirits we didn't get that that's going
[41:33] to be later
[41:37] watch cause it's got to kill every
[41:41] disease every thistle every
[41:45] Thorn that doesn't happen in Armageddon
[41:49] no but it will happen in go and meog
[41:52] everything there is to be done the first
[41:54] fire will the fire will burn it up and
[41:58] remember it's not allog together just a
[42:00] literal
[42:02] fire it's also a holy fire see that will
[42:06] take away Satan and all of his all of
[42:09] the Devils both Heaven and Earth amen
[42:12] will pass away killing all the germs all
[42:15] the insects all the natural life on the
[42:18] earth even the H2O the water will
[42:22] explode think of it talk about a
[42:25] noise H2O two part hydrogen one part
[42:30] oxygen most deadly explosive there is in
[42:33] the world what did that guy blow up that
[42:37] uh out under oklah Oklahoma with
[42:41] fertilizer
[42:43] right nitrate ammonia nitrate that we
[42:46] put around the corn to get to
[42:48] grow right it's just cing to how you're
[42:51] doing it but what I love is this part
[42:54] about it see that's why when I get into
[42:56] looking at the future home I'm not just
[42:57] looking trying to figure out how big the
[42:58] city is and where it's going to set I
[43:00] love this you know when a man receives a
[43:02] baptism of a holy baptism of the fire
[43:04] you know the Bible says you receive the
[43:06] fire the the fire and the Holy
[43:12] Ghost and we call it holy ghost
[43:15] fire Holy Ghost and
[43:18] Fire but see it's not a baptism and then
[43:21] a fire it's the Holy Ghost itself
[43:23] burning out
[43:25] everything
[43:26] he burns out everything that's in that
[43:28] Soul it don't he don't give you a New
[43:30] Soul he don't destroy the soul that's
[43:32] right and no no where will he destroy
[43:35] this world that's right right
[43:40] amen we this Earth are the center of the
[43:43] universe amen you said no it's all out
[43:46] there and it's just moving us away well
[43:48] this is where God's going to choose to
[43:50] be right we're not going to moon to the
[43:53] moon or the Mars or to Jupiter
[43:57] right this is where God's going to
[43:59] choose for to be at well then this is
[44:02] the center of the
[44:04] universe you say yeah but we're all
[44:06] traveling all this that's okay but now
[44:11] listen there's a lot of noise around
[44:14] when a person receives a baptism and go
[44:16] go
[44:17] us they think that's a shame to hear
[44:20] people scream and shout like the do just
[44:21] wait till this Earth gets her
[44:24] baptism and we'll get the future home so
[44:27] I won't try to go into much of of it
[44:29] other than giving you thoughts we don't
[44:31] have the time see in that future home is
[44:34] going to destroy all
[44:37] demons all insects all
[44:42] germs they'll just be
[44:44] bound right in the Thousand
[44:49] Years but when you come to Gog and Magog
[44:52] it's not going to be just a atomic bombs
[44:55] falling
[44:57] it'll be a fire from God out of heaven
[45:01] right he'll use those atomic bombs
[45:04] because they will Blast away a lot of
[45:05] the things and it's on down through
[45:07] there if you read the future home you'll
[45:09] find it so many feet down in the earth
[45:11] will be annihilated or blow off as far
[45:13] as sinful man has been into the
[45:17] Earth that will be annihilated why
[45:20] because it's sin that's right everywhere
[45:23] we go we set our dirty feet on something
[45:26] when they went to the moon and set their
[45:28] foot up there that doomed that
[45:34] Moon do you understand what I'm saying
[45:37] that made a doom set on that Moon yes
[45:40] why because man polluted it that's right
[45:43] amen anywhere pollution goes God's going
[45:46] to destroy and it's going to destroy all
[45:48] the demons amen not just the germs yes
[45:53] right but all the demons amen right
[45:56] Satan's going to be cast into the Lake
[45:58] of Fire so all the demons are going to
[45:59] be cast in there right right
[46:03] amen and that's why we don't believe
[46:05] that hell is eternal right amen there's
[46:07] no Bible for it I want to see it amen
[46:10] right oh where the worm do not and
[46:13] everlastings and there's Eternal
[46:16] judgment but not eternal hell because as
[46:19] I say over and over if you're going to
[46:21] have an eternal hell you're going to
[46:23] have to have an eternal God living in
[46:24] hell so look what you messed up on well
[46:27] he can give eternal life to you where he
[46:29] can burn Eternal if he give eternal life
[46:32] to you you're born
[46:34] again right I thought that's what the
[46:37] new birth was have I missed it the new
[46:41] birth is God giving you eternal life
[46:44] right and then one day Body Spirit and
[46:46] soul will be totally Eternal and the
[46:49] Bible said have a body like un his
[46:50] glorious body that's right oh do you
[46:53] understand what I'm saying yes see I've
[46:56] got it in here about Russia and all like
[46:58] that where brother s they'll come down
[47:00] in Russia that's
[47:02] fine and they will be literal things
[47:05] happening but as I said read Ezekiel
[47:09] 38-39 they'll go through and burn the
[47:12] instruments of war they bury the bodies
[47:14] they do all kind of
[47:21] things but you don't have to bury no
[47:23] bodies when this thing blasts away
[47:26] but is not
[47:27] annihilated because the same word for
[47:30] your new birth is the same word that's
[47:32] used for this world passing
[47:36] away and you didn't pass away oh brother
[47:40] Dale I died Amen in Soul that's right
[47:43] rest of us is still alive that's where
[47:45] our trouble's at right these bodies
[47:48] these Spirits are not
[47:50] Eternal all right but you see Gog and
[47:54] MOG then is not just R countries coming
[47:57] together that's my whole point I was
[47:59] going to listen really leave this out
[48:01] you know and I thought well I'll go on
[48:02] to the Future home already started
[48:04] writing notes and I thought no there's
[48:07] something we're missing there on Gog and
[48:09] Magog Lord what is
[48:11] it I knew it was to be the destruction
[48:14] of of
[48:15] all
[48:17] germs and and all demons and things will
[48:21] be destroyed not just captured somewhere
[48:24] placed they may burn for millions and
[48:27] billions and billions of years that's
[48:28] where that the word Aon I believe it is
[48:31] or Eon Aon is applied
[48:34] to hell because you got sh goana Hades
[48:38] you got many words to use and Hell
[48:40] cannot be Eternal because you you can't
[48:42] put God in hell that's right am he went
[48:46] there one time for being and you amen
[48:48] that was to pay the
[48:50] price but you see the word Zoe is God's
[48:53] own
[48:54] life
[48:56] zo is eternal life amen all right so
[49:01] eternal life now there is no demon in
[49:03] your soul that's right I've heard
[49:05] preachers in this message try to preach
[49:07] since I got born again I got two
[49:10] Souls here I am and got in here and God
[49:13] and the devil in here living now you
[49:15] can't put that
[49:17] nowhere my Bible says God won't dwell in
[49:20] an unclean vessel now you do what you
[49:22] want to and believe what you want to but
[49:24] the Bible says he want amen so you can't
[49:27] put de the devil and God in you at the
[49:29] same
[49:31] time sure you're looking at the Devil in
[49:33] his works this flesh this being that I
[49:37] am is because of Satan in his works but
[49:41] inside of there is eternal
[49:44] life that there's no such thing as two
[49:46] Natures that's right
[49:50] right it won't
[49:53] work but you see that's man's idea
[49:56] little on organizational teachings of
[49:58] what we
[50:00] had but now
[50:04] listen
[50:06] anywhere that man has been is going to
[50:09] have to be
[50:11] purged anything he's done is going to
[50:14] have to be purged that's
[50:18] right the H2O will explode and we'll get
[50:21] to it later that the Bible says Heaven
[50:23] and Earth has passed away I saw no more
[50:25] sea
[50:26] that doesn't mean there's no more water
[50:27] in the
[50:29] world or it would have said all water no
[50:32] it says
[50:33] see the Mediterranean Sea the Sea of
[50:38] Galilee those are not
[50:40] oceans those are
[50:42] seas and for the city to set down we get
[50:45] later into Jerusalem then you got to get
[50:48] rid of some of that water that's
[50:50] there but don't worry about it got to
[50:52] take care of but it won't do away with
[50:54] the ocean
[50:59] everybody thinks one of the days when it
[51:00] blows up all the water in the world's
[51:02] gone we going to be no no it won't
[51:06] work so that's man's ideas and thoughts
[51:09] but listen to what I'm trying to
[51:13] say I'm trying to get you to look at
[51:15] armag I mean Gog and
[51:18] Magog Armageddon will be literal battles
[51:21] yes but it will still be caused by the
[51:24] word of God to the mouth of two
[51:26] witnesses that's what my Bible says the
[51:29] word will come through their mouth the
[51:30] fire of God will come through their
[51:32] mouth their words that will destroy all
[51:36] right but see this is a spiritual thing
[51:39] happening let alone a literal that's
[51:41] right any demon anything like that is
[51:44] going to be
[51:46] annihilated not captivated and put
[51:48] somewhere
[51:52] annihilated right we just remember then
[51:55] Gog and Magog wouldn't be covering
[51:58] Russia that's only nuclear
[52:03] Wars but if you can see what I'm talking
[52:05] about what I've quoted a couple of times
[52:07] the Bible said when you see Jerusalem
[52:08] comp passed about on all side look up
[52:10] your Redemption draw now go home and
[52:12] look at the map and look where we're all
[52:14] gathered around there we got our
[52:16] countries they got their
[52:19] countries sure they will be literal
[52:22] Nations yes
[52:27] but you know what was so amazing I think
[52:29] when you first read it it was to me when
[52:32] I first read the for seal about
[52:36] Armageddon cuz I was wanting to read
[52:38] that and I had all this figured out we
[52:39] did we taught it there's going to be
[52:41] Russia coming down China coming down
[52:42] this coming down that coming down
[52:44] brother randam never mentioned no
[52:46] country there he said Protestants and
[52:50] Catholics going against the word of
[52:54] God
[52:56] Armageddon will be Protestants and
[52:59] Catholics gathering together don't you
[53:02] ever heard this statement I was looking
[53:04] at this morning brother R said Russia is
[53:06] 1%
[53:10] communist he said then there 99% is on
[53:14] the Christian
[53:15] form you need that
[53:18] quote 1% of Russia is communist he said
[53:22] it had to be God allowing it to take
[53:25] place called how could
[53:27] 1% control a whole
[53:33] nation and see when they come riding
[53:35] down over
[53:37] there in literal
[53:41] happenings you know what'll be in those
[53:43] tanks coming from
[53:46] Russia people that call themselves
[53:49] Christians no no no well did any of you
[53:52] ever go to
[53:54] war
[54:01] I'm
[54:02] pausing I thought somebody might amen my
[54:08] point did you go over there and say I'm
[54:12] a Christian no you went over there and
[54:18] fought and it used to be that the tags
[54:21] was what you were either Protestant or
[54:24] Catholic now they got to have the
[54:25] whatnot of anything else you order to be
[54:28] put on there right or
[54:32] other you getting my point yes World War
[54:36] II you know that there was a lot of
[54:38] Germans and Japanese that was fighting
[54:40] against us that in their country before
[54:43] they were put in the military was
[54:45] Christians that's
[54:48] right see I'm trying to make a
[54:51] point brother BR said Protestants and
[54:53] Catholics coming down what is it going
[54:56] to be we read the Bible here it says
[54:57] come down upon the Beloved City what is
[55:00] the Beloved City
[55:04] Israel so who will it be Protestants and
[55:09] Catholics coming around
[55:11] this to try to
[55:17] destroy but God will destroy
[55:20] them because nuclear war listen Nu
[55:25] nuclear atomic energy does not destroy
[55:30] demons that is demons if you want to be
[55:34] plain nuclear war don't destroy demons
[55:37] that's right it takes God's word to
[55:40] destroy
[55:43] demons all
[55:45] right so when they come up there in the
[55:47] resurrection to go to the white Throne
[55:49] what are they doing you know that a lot
[55:50] of them will go there that Jesus said it
[55:52] he said they'll say one day have not I
[55:54] cast out devils done Mighty wonderful
[55:56] works in your name that he'll say depart
[55:58] from me cuz I never knew you right they
[56:01] never had an experience with
[56:04] God I'm just trying to get you to think
[56:06] Gog and Magog is not going to be just
[56:09] atomic energy pouring down sure that
[56:11] will
[56:13] happen but God is the only one that can
[56:15] destroy
[56:18] demons right germs might be annihilated
[56:22] by nuclear but what does it do it this
[56:24] creates more right some me we don't even
[56:27] know anything
[56:29] about but yet the Holy Fire of God will
[56:32] destroy
[56:34] right to Gog and Magog is going to be
[56:37] not just countries it's going to be God
[56:39] coming
[56:40] down raining fire down out of Heaven
[56:43] from his mouth to destroy all the demons
[56:46] the germs the things are going to be
[56:49] annihilated in Gog and
[56:51] Magog then they can be a future home
[56:57] am you get what I'm saying about the
[56:59] Earth what is it just as far as man is
[57:01] polluted it will be annihilated the rest
[57:03] of it's going to stay here right amen
[57:05] the core of the Earth is going to stay
[57:07] here right
[57:11] amen and then the future home's going to
[57:14] come
[57:16] down right CU what does it say in the
[57:19] future home there let's jump over
[57:22] this can y'all pull up in a hurry
[57:25] Revelations I got it somewhere in here
[57:27] Revelations 21 put it on there brother
[57:31] Anderson let me just say a few words
[57:33] about this cuz this is just a background
[57:35] to say it so you'll have it let's see if
[57:39] I can if you I got it written on one of
[57:40] the notes uh number six okay look what
[57:45] the scripture says in Revelations
[57:47] 21 I saw a new Heaven and new
[57:50] earth for the first Heaven and the first
[57:52] Earth were passed away and there was no
[57:55] more seed that's what the scripture said
[57:57] remember that word passed away is not
[58:00] annihilated it's changing from one form
[58:02] to another and remember there's no more
[58:04] seed not meaning there's not no more
[58:06] water in the world that means around in
[58:08] Jerusalem you'll have to be no more seed
[58:10] to bring the city
[58:12] down cuz it's what 1500 square
[58:16] miles he said and I John saw the holy
[58:19] city Jer coming down from God out of
[58:21] Heaven prepared as a bride adoring for a
[58:23] husband
[58:25] and we'll just stop there but I just
[58:26] want the first verse and I saw a new
[58:28] Heaven and new earth for the first
[58:30] Heaven and the first Earth has passed
[58:35] away that's going to be a great
[58:39] Annihilation what is the first heaven
[58:42] then brother
[58:44] Brandon you're the prophet we ask you
[58:47] the
[58:48] question look at number

[59:19] prepare it he's the Creator he creates
[59:22] all that gold and the streets are
[59:24] transparent
[59:25] he is the creator he's making a place
[59:27] over in Revelation 21 he said I John saw
[59:29] the holy city New Jerusalem descended
[59:31] from God out of Heaven there was no more
[59:34] SE the first Heaven and the first Earth
[59:35] were passed away what was our first
[59:39] Heaven it's going to pass away are you
[59:43] reading it it was the Millennium your
[59:46] Millennium will be the first heaven cuz
[59:48] that'll be the first time that God will
[59:50] totally be ruling over
[59:53] Earth
[59:55] from the fall in the garden he hasn't
[59:57] ruled over Earth Satan is your big ruler
[1:00:00] of the earth that's right even offered
[1:00:02] Jesus the kingdoms of this world and
[1:00:06] Jesus never said you don't own them he
[1:00:07] just said get behind me I got to pay the
[1:00:10] price for it but look what is our first
[1:00:14] heaven was the Millennium what is the
[1:00:17] first Earth was
[1:00:19] this this earth now right this is the
[1:00:23] first Earth
[1:00:25] the Millennium will be the first Heaven
[1:00:27] all
[1:00:29] right and it'll be right here on the
[1:00:32] Earth where the city comes down right
[1:00:35] Amen to rest on and redeemed into our
[1:00:38] Earth showing an example of it Jesus was
[1:00:42] standing on the River Jordan you can
[1:00:44] roll that up if you want to I of where
[1:00:46] they can keep on reading Jesus was
[1:00:49] standing on the
[1:00:52] earth God came down out of heaven right
[1:00:56] is that in the Bible where he was there
[1:00:57] at his
[1:00:58] baptism and said this is my beloved Son
[1:01:01] in whom I'm pleased to
[1:01:04] dwell settled on a redeemed entire
[1:01:09] Earth John saw the holy city sitting on
[1:01:11] a redeemed entire
[1:01:13] Earth Jesus is right now he said I go to
[1:01:16] prepare place for you if I go to prepare
[1:01:17] place for you I'll come again to receive
[1:01:19] you under myself what's he preparing the
[1:01:22] future home right Amen brother to
[1:01:25] live
[1:01:27] right cuz the first heaven and first
[1:01:29] Earth has passed away right changed in
[1:01:32] form the world will be
[1:01:38] renovated Armageddon will put it back
[1:01:40] like a Garden of Eden
[1:01:42] amen
[1:01:45] right Armageddon will put back the world
[1:01:48] like a Garden of Eden the future home
[1:01:51] will put it totally beyond the Garden of
[1:01:53] Eden right amen yes
[1:01:56] sir cuz remember in the Garden of Eden
[1:01:59] you had the devil running around hissing
[1:02:01] right amen he ain't going to be
[1:02:03] there those snakes and things that will
[1:02:06] be there won't be
[1:02:07] harmful
[1:02:09] right are you following me Gog and MOG
[1:02:13] then is not just to talk about
[1:02:18] Russia because you look at
[1:02:20] it brother around said communism will
[1:02:23] pass away yep you remember that whoever
[1:02:26] thought of that when the world talk
[1:02:27] communism was the
[1:02:29] Antichrist the mark of the beast and all
[1:02:31] of the different
[1:02:33] things and communism passed
[1:02:38] away when they demanded payment from
[1:02:40] Russia y now they're
[1:02:44] Russia but now show me where they done
[1:02:46] away with any of their bombs and things
[1:02:48] nope the prophet said it one day and I
[1:02:50] agree he said they've got a bomb sitting
[1:02:53] there
[1:02:55] waiting on the Vatican they're going to
[1:02:57] stick it down a smoke pipe in the
[1:03:00] Vatican why because the Vatican is where
[1:03:02] the world system is tied up
[1:03:05] to and Russia's also got one with
[1:03:07] Washington tied on it
[1:03:12] right he said you mean you think that
[1:03:14] this United States is going to be
[1:03:16] destroyed well if you don't you better
[1:03:18] go back and read your Bible a
[1:03:21] little I remember talking to my
[1:03:23] mother-in-law about it me she was honest
[1:03:25] she told me I'm not throwing off on her
[1:03:27] I loved her greatest person in the
[1:03:30] world but she said Sam God's not going
[1:03:33] to let anybody destroy this Christian
[1:03:40] Nation I just said there ain't no such
[1:03:42] thing as a Christian
[1:03:44] Nation it's Christ in the
[1:03:49] people do you understand what I'm
[1:03:51] getting at I'm just getting one point to
[1:03:52] you yes cuz they'll have to understand
[1:03:55] the future home as we get to going
[1:03:57] in Gog and Magog will not only be a
[1:04:00] literal
[1:04:01] destroying but it'll destroy all demons
[1:04:05] all
[1:04:06] Devils there won't be any devil nowhere
[1:04:08] after then there won't be no devil
[1:04:11] because he's even cast
[1:04:13] in to the Lake of Fire himself the Bible
[1:04:17] says which is what what is it called the
[1:04:20] Lake of Fire the second death right
[1:04:23] right that's right the total
[1:04:31] Annihilation it won't be no little
[1:04:33] Mounds pushed up in the future
[1:04:36] home
[1:04:37] right it won't be no devil there to
[1:04:41] hinder all be gone amen first heaven and
[1:04:45] first Earth is already passed away when
[1:04:46] that
[1:04:47] happens Butz we ain't got to this world
[1:04:50] being pised away yet no but it will we
[1:04:54] not to we're not to the Millennium yet
[1:04:56] but we're heading that
[1:05:00] way the word of God is brought the world
[1:05:05] and all the things into existence would
[1:05:07] you agree
[1:05:10] yes and the word of God will destroy all
[1:05:13] the things that needs to be
[1:05:20] destroyed it's so hard to even think
[1:05:22] about that there'd be a time that
[1:05:24] even in the Millennium that Satan would
[1:05:26] be
[1:05:29] bound cuz you can say all you want to
[1:05:31] that the devil don't bother you I'm
[1:05:34] going to agree with you he don't bother
[1:05:36] you because he's already got
[1:05:39] you right told you about the man at work
[1:05:43] one day he said I'm not working on
[1:05:45] commanding the devil no more said I'm
[1:05:47] working on commanding the
[1:05:49] Lord I said so
[1:05:51] long I never talked to that man
[1:05:55] again cuz he said I'm commanding God to
[1:05:59] do things
[1:06:01] now I thought I'm talking to the head
[1:06:04] man right now so I'm just going to leave
[1:06:05] you old
[1:06:07] booger and I never talk with him again
[1:06:11] but see he had that idea right cuz the
[1:06:14] Bible says command ye me I said that
[1:06:17] does not I told him I said that does not
[1:06:19] mean commanding God that means you ask
[1:06:23] God to fulfill his word and he will do
[1:06:26] it I believe that you're sick you ask
[1:06:30] God to heal you he'll do it but you
[1:06:33] can't command him to do it you can't
[1:06:36] order him to do
[1:06:38] it but if you believe his
[1:06:41] word he'll do
[1:06:43] it right you understand what I'm talking
[1:06:46] about Gog and Magog let's get it out of
[1:06:48] our mind that it's a Russia or this kind
[1:06:50] of all of that we that's in God's
[1:06:53] economy I mean they're coming around
[1:06:55] there but it's still Protestants and
[1:06:57] Catholics
[1:07:02] amen why do you think countries wants
[1:07:05] other why do you think the United States
[1:07:06] wants other countries to toh be under
[1:07:09] their domain where they can put their
[1:07:12] doctrines and ideas
[1:07:14] there
[1:07:17] right see we want to clear up a country
[1:07:20] yes we want over there to set these
[1:07:22] women free that was bound and what do we
[1:07:25] do we put them in honky ton and made
[1:07:27] drunks out of them and
[1:07:31] prostitutes is that true did we make
[1:07:33] them better than what they
[1:07:35] were oh we freed
[1:07:39] them what's happened
[1:07:42] right you see church I want to see not
[1:07:44] only Satan
[1:07:47] bound because I'm
[1:07:52] thinking you ever heard the prophet say
[1:07:54] like this he said if you offered a
[1:07:55] million years to live or either give you
[1:07:59] eternal life as a Christian which one
[1:08:01] would you take cuz
[1:08:04] remember
[1:08:06] 969 I mean
[1:08:09] 999 you might live A million or you know
[1:08:13] like one day but you're going to be
[1:08:17] destroyed if you have eternal life you
[1:08:19] can't never be destroyed
[1:08:22] amen
[1:08:24] I don't just want Satan bound amen I
[1:08:27] want him
[1:08:31] destroyed bind him he gets loose again
[1:08:34] that's
[1:08:35] true but if he's destroyed he can't do
[1:08:38] it see God can annihilate come ahead
[1:08:40] musician God can
[1:08:42] annihilate all demons all things all
[1:08:45] powers all of anything he can totally
[1:08:48] annihilate it remember the Bible says
[1:08:51] Don't Fear him that can destroy the body
[1:08:54] right right it says fear him that can
[1:08:56] destroy the soul right see Satan can't
[1:08:59] destroy the soul that's right no matter
[1:09:02] what he does he can't destroy the
[1:09:08] soul but God
[1:09:10] can
[1:09:12] amen the most you can do with the Devil
[1:09:15] is resist him that's right right turn
[1:09:19] him down resist
[1:09:21] him but God can destroy
[1:09:24] yes you know one scripture that I'd love
[1:09:27] to be fulfilled in my
[1:09:29] life one scripture I've always wanted to
[1:09:31] be fulfilled in my life you know what
[1:09:33] that
[1:09:35] is when Jesus said one day he said Satan
[1:09:40] cometh and have nothing in
[1:09:43] me that's
[1:09:45] Bible Satan cometh or devil cometh and
[1:09:49] have nothing in
[1:09:51] me well now did he mean that the the
[1:09:53] devil couldn't beat him and make him
[1:09:55] sick and and heartaches and no no no no
[1:09:58] no no that was happening every day
[1:10:00] that's right y but he could not get an
[1:10:04] inroad into
[1:10:06] him offered him the world offered him
[1:10:10] everything you realize what he offered
[1:10:12] him when he offered him the world he
[1:10:15] offered him the ability to bypass
[1:10:18] Calvary that he didn't have to
[1:10:21] die you never thought it like that
[1:10:24] Satan offered God an opportunity that he
[1:10:27] didn't have to
[1:10:31] die he could bypass it right he said
[1:10:35] ain't going to do
[1:10:37] it I know what I come for I'm going to
[1:10:40] pay the
[1:10:42] price Satan couldn't understand that why
[1:10:44] a man would want right something like
[1:10:46] that greater than right the fact of
[1:10:50] setting him free that he didn't have to
[1:10:51] kill
[1:10:52] him
[1:10:55] I don't want Satan just bound that's a
[1:10:56] wonderful thing I want him totally
[1:10:59] annihilated and it'll take Gog and Magog
[1:11:01] to do
[1:11:04] that you go back and study it just what
[1:11:07] I'm saying if you go back and study
[1:11:08] Ezekiel 3 38 and 39 you'll find Gog and
[1:11:11] Magog all the way through it and the
[1:11:13] description of the countries it come
[1:11:16] from which you'll also find it like Gog
[1:11:18] is a son of so and so and mag goog is a
[1:11:22] country
[1:11:24] but my point today is try to get you to
[1:11:26] see Gog and Magog is going to be a
[1:11:29] spiritual more than just a f physical
[1:11:32] burning but it'll be destroying every
[1:11:35] devil every disease every germ
[1:11:38] everything will be
[1:11:40] annihilated amen what a wonderful day
[1:11:43] amen let's stand
[1:11:45] together he said well why do we need a
[1:11:47] new
[1:11:49] Heaven because we get to live in the
[1:11:51] first one the Millen
[1:11:54] ium and we don't want it to stay that
[1:11:57] way cuz that's not the fulfilling of
[1:12:00] God's
[1:12:02] plan right think on these
[1:12:06] things and that way we'll get away from
[1:12:08] just Russia and China and you going be
[1:12:10] away from that what I'm saying I I keep
[1:12:13] saying that over and over on that for
[1:12:15] seal when that Prophet brought down
[1:12:16] those forces coming around Jerusalem he
[1:12:19] said Protestants and Catholics and I
[1:12:22] first thought
[1:12:25] man who are those
[1:12:28] people I thought she was going to tell
[1:12:30] me like one time there was a title of a
[1:12:31] sermon said invasion of the US you
[1:12:34] better believe I got that
[1:12:37] sermon and I was going to see how this
[1:12:40] United States is going to be invaded boy
[1:12:42] he told
[1:12:44] me he said they came over on the
[1:12:48] mayly and he said they come in here and
[1:12:51] said we've been taught their doctrines
[1:12:54] and the United States has been invaded
[1:12:56] by man's
[1:12:58] doctrines that came from the old Roman
[1:13:02] Catholic
[1:13:05] Church I was really
[1:13:09] disappointed cuz I wanted to see who was
[1:13:11] going to be the battling when he said
[1:13:14] what Armageddon would be Protestant
[1:13:17] Catholics I was kind of disappointed cuz
[1:13:19] I was thinking he'd tell how Russia
[1:13:20] would come down and how this would come
[1:13:22] down and then
[1:13:24] and they
[1:13:25] will but when God looks at it he calls
[1:13:27] them Protestants and
[1:13:35] Catholics you said but now you you got
[1:13:38] plenty of Muslims and and Islams and all
[1:13:41] like that ain't nothing but Protestants
[1:13:43] and
[1:13:47] Catholics nothing in the world with
[1:13:49] Protestants and
[1:13:52] Catholic you ever notice the pope don't
[1:13:54] never fight them islamics and
[1:14:00] things come on you ought to read a
[1:14:02] little bit think a little
[1:14:04] bit what's the difference in the
[1:14:06] Protestant and the Catholic what's the
[1:14:08] difference in the Catholic and the
[1:14:10] Islam in a lot of respects the Islam and
[1:14:13] things is better because in the Catholic
[1:14:15] form you have them trying to believe the
[1:14:16] pope is
[1:14:17] God at least in the islamics every one
[1:14:20] of them is they believe that all is God
[1:14:22] that's right
[1:14:23] they don't claim none of them to be
[1:14:25] Allah that's
[1:14:29] right what's the difference when you get
[1:14:31] a false doctorine or true doctor I want
[1:14:34] the truth don't you go ahead 381 381
