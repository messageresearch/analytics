is the God bless you may be sa amen thank you brother colie bless you you know that Matthew 6 that chapter 6 is always my go-to chapter when I feel like um concerned about my situation you know whatever my need is you read that chapter and it gives you such a comfort to know we have a loving father that knows every detail about her life and I I'll share this just for a minute we only have one service so we can take our time this morning um that you know the scriptures I believe in the Psalms where it says he leadth Us by Green Pastures and in my mind I've read that since a child I've always thought about God just leading us on a big field of Green Field just luscious belly deep out fou for the Sheep you know but that's not the way it is I saw a video where the man he went to the location where David wrote that and showed you what he was looking at and it was a it was a mountain full of just rocks and desert and he explained over time and you saw the the little Shepherd girls leading the Sheep uh through the side of the mountain but under the rocks on that side of the mountain the Dew Falls every day and it creates these little Sprouts of grass and the shepherd leads these sheep to these little Sprouts of grass so they can eat just enough for that day so they have to rely on the shepherd the next day and the next day and the next day what a revelation that was and then you just think Lord if I don't have nothing no money no clothes I'm living every day in the Overflow I am living every day in his spirit and he's providing for me what a cfor you know that is such it it turned it it's like a was it a a paradigm shift brother Ernie he goes that paradigm shift that we have and I tell you it's just a faith builder then you realize your life isn't your own it's all about him and you're just living each day for him amen so I appreciate that brother colie you never know how God leads him to read scripture sometimes it might seem repetitious but if you just get in the word and hear the word speaking to you uh it opens up life to you brother Michael would you come this morning and take our ties and offering amen let's um let's sing that song paid in full by the blood of the Lamb k amen we believe it's paid in full this morning the price is paid paid in full by the blood of the Lamb I'm free from sin free to live now I am and it reads on the page where my

glorify your name for there's no greater name I know I tell it I tell it wherever I go glorify glorify your [Music] name this song um the song is uh we've been practicing this song and I think uh We've sung it here before but it really speaks volumes of of um kind of like that quote in the back of the uh Church there on Christ The Mystery of God and our whole motive of us becoming more like him is to give him the preeminence it's it's not about us it's about him and a lot of times we try to make it about us and and we fall and we crawl back to the cross and we realize it's all him and it's him in US but um you know there's times that we try to make it about our talent and what we can do and our actions and our doings it's what he's already done for us he's just claiming that by faith so if you know it you can sing the song with us when the music Fades and all is stripped away and I simply [Music] come longing just to bring something that's of worth that will bless your heart

faces that are not as familiar might have in 1988 last time I was here you like to turn in your scriptures 1 Chronicles chapter 16 and verse 29 we'll read a scripture and let you sit down 1 Chronicles 1629 give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come before him Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness fear before him all the Earth the world also shall be stable that it be not moved that the heavens be be glad yes and the Earth rejoice and let men say among the nation the Lord reth let the sea Roar and the fullness thereof let the fields rejoice and all that is

and all the people said amen and praise the Lord thank you Jesus glory be to the god of our Salvation amen you may be seated good to see everybody I know am good to see you whether I know you or not give me it's seems like I don't know any strangers I just I'm just old brother Mike let me read you first questions and answers on Genesis speaking in tongues is a Divine gift of God which belongs to the church just the same today as it was back there in the beginning that's exactly the truth yes and d That's the Bible teaching it's a Divine gift and you deny that just the same as you deny the new birth you deny everything that Jesus taught when you try to cut that out now you can go wild on that many of them have but but I'm saying that has its place amen it's just like a pair of shoes when you buy a pair of shoes the tongues are in them and that's right and when you're into the body of Christ God has the whole table set full here amen why is not appropriate for our service today he's got a whole table set he has love he has Joy sir if I went to your table and sat down and you said preacher come and eat with me I believe you love me and you had beans and potatoes and carrots and and fried chicken and pumpkin pie and ice cream everything sitting there why I believe I'd be just as welcome to the potatoes that I was of the beans the only thing I believe I'd be just as welcome to the chicken as I was to the pie that's the dinner you've sit it's all on the table and the only thing I have to do is say would you please pass me the P I believe with a good free heart you're love to me you'd say certainly my brother have a nice big piece of it isn't that right if I would say pass me potatoes why certainly my brother here it is and every Redemptive blessing that Jesus Christ died for and purchased in his atonement Calvary it's sitting on the table and every believer sitting before it Hallelujah if I need healing I say father pass me some healing Genesis chapter 2 and verse seven we're retrogade a little bit the title that I've got on the top of the message is the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness there anyone here that doesn't believe that we are in wilderness Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into him the breath of life and Man became a living Soul where did he get the where did he get the pieces to make the man from what medical book did he read it would be easier to Make a Man Out of the Dust of the earth than it would to give him a living soul dust to the Earth is natural you can form all kinds of things out of the Dust of the earth what does it take to give it life not life like a puppy dog running r at your feet not life like a herd of cattle here was a life that was a seed to grow into a life like the one that created it a message called This is a rising it is the rising of the sun notice this quickening power Zoe bringing the word the mind that was in Christ was in you then I'm trying to show you that you when you raised when God raised Jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also Quicken to life with him you are now quick to life although then you were but an attribute in his thought but God had saw all in him in the beginning God standing alone with his thoughts am you were one of those thoughts you are as Eternal as God is when God raised up Jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also Quicken to life with him you are now quickened to life although then you were but an attribute in his thought that's right but God had saw all in him at the Finish see so did you mean at the beginning no no at the Finish amen when God looked down upon the body the spirit left him in the garden of Gethsemane he had to die like a man the spirit left him in the excuse me remember friends he didn't have to do that am he was God God appointed that flesh which was human flesh and he did if he have went up there as God he'd have never died that kind of of death you can't kill God but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there with you in him you were more real to him at that time yes sir then you will ever be here on the face of the Earth because you were a part of his eternal faults there's a quite a few people here that I can remember as pretty young people looking at my daughter Ruth I first brought her here she's just a little fella it's not all that big now but but remember remember he went there with you in him you went to Calvary in him there's one place brother Brenham said you paid for your own sins in him God had never separated the bride from the group yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body see they are the same same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride well how can the Bride come and fail fa to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even to proving it by raising himself from the dead afterwards then don't the bride have to do the same thing have to be exactly what the word said she would be in these last days don't she have to return through Malachi 4 amen don't she have to be manifest like it was in the days of Sodom don't the word have to be just exactly like it is believe that amen these are questions right isn't these things a perfect identification of the word of God made known to us glory be to Jesus when we look at each other we are not looking at just another person those of us gathering together in the name of Jesus Christ when you look across the aisle or you you shake hands with your brother and sister you're shaking hands with an attribute of God with that just a word of introduction to those to whom I am not a familiar face Michael htis more commonly known as brother Mike in 1975 I met brother Moz and Brother Sam Dale how old was you brother Wade I pastored churches in mville and Jefferson in Georgia yes did an assistant to Stan price in Nar Florida well enough about me as the song says more about Jesus I would know more of his grace to others show am thank you Lord Jesus some of just saying thank you he's not going to continue singing Hebrews chapter 2 now when man become into that body he had control of all the fishes and fowls and beasts of the field where we at we're back in in Genesis 2 again aren't we amen and then there was no man to till the soil Genesis 2 he done made male and female but there was no man to till the soil then God made Man Out of the Dust to the Earth he give him a hand like a chimpanzee give him a foot like a bear give him he made him on the image and this Earthly body is in the image of animal life and it's made out of the same kind of material your body is made just like the same a kind of material as a horse or dog or anything like that it's made out of calcium podage petroleum Cosmic light you're just All Flesh that is not the same All Flesh like that is not the same flesh it's different flesh but it's made out of the Dust of the Earth where it come from and except we are alive at the time of the Rapture where it will go back to but the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man he did not put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany just a little piece from a message called the Inon as God of old when we hear thy ashes to ashes and dust to dust it reminds me of long fow who said tell me not in mournful numbers life is just an empty dream the soul is dead that Slumbers and things are not as they seem he said yay life is real and life is earnest and the grave is not its goal for dust thou us to dust Thou Art to dust returnthe opony amen and when we leave here we go in somewhere else whatever it may be I take the apostles word when he said if this Earthly Tabernacle or Dwelling Place be dissolved we have one already waiting to move from this to that see our soul brother brandom said the soul that's in a man is worth 10,000 worlds and it's in you but it's not you're you're going to it but it's always been with you amen you say that must be Supernatural brother Mike who is this m jedc and he would hear that H cluck he would try his best to cluck he couldn't do it he he tried to cheap like a chicken but he couldn't do it see he was an eagle to start with he was an eagle he was just hatched under a hand like some church members that's about the way it is one out of a setting right one day Mommy flew over and she screamed he recognized it he had never seen an eagle he recognized it it sounded right amen why he was an eagle to begin with and this is the story brother brandham told about the man that climbed up and found this Eagle's Nest and there was two eggs in it and he took one of those eggs carried it back to his farm and put it under a chicken well the chicken had about 12 more eggs in the nest but when she sat on that one golly it was almost as big as the other 12 but Faithfully she sat on the egg until all of them hatched and then she lined up all those little chickens and took them out in the barnyard found them a nice bug grass seed weed seed and they rejoiced and clucked and they cheaped except for that big old thing my goodness that that little chick he could eat two or three seeds and he satisfied for a few minutes that big old thing he was looking around for something red it just wasn't there that's right one day his mamy flew over and screamed he recognized it that sounded right why he was an eagle to begin with that's the way it is with the gospel El or the word or the power of Jesus Christ when a man has been predestinated to eternal life he hears that true ring that scream of God am nothing can keep him from it I was a minister with the Assemblies of God when I first heard that scream amen I didn't know what to think other Mike what are you doing don't don't you know you you have been groomed and raised under a minister that prophesied he was going to be the next state of New York preser he was going to be the big guy and and and then you moved and we accepted you with open arms because you had such a recommendation from the New York district and now you're going after this Renegade what do you think you're doing I think I'm following God there was a scream I heard amen it sounded real yeah it stirred something in me that it the Constitution and bylaws of the Assembly of God never stirred me like that scream did it was something different yes it went way down inside of me not in here in was it in here yeah don't really know where it was just like I talk about my soul I don't know really exactly where it is I know it's real I know since that day I've had fellowship with him yeah amen I was predestinated to it that barnyard stuff wouldn't do for him anymore he's gone all things are possible he gets off the ground that's what's the matter with so many Christians today they can't get their feet off of the ground oh Mommy said Son jump you're an eagle come up here where I am he said Mom I never jumped in my life he said well you jump you're an eagle to begin with you're not a chicken so he made his first jump and he flopped his wings and didn't do too good but he got off the ground that's the way we do we accept God by Faith by the written word there's something in there that's eternal life you were predestinated to it sir his grandpa his grandma were Eagles he was an eagle all the way back Eagles don't mix with other things he's not a hybrid he's an eagle then after you recognized the very word of God was eagal food then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany if this Earthly ble be dissolved we have one waiting you say is that right brother Brenham in my humble opinion everything that brother brandom said Is Right how can I overcome he said some strange things though when you see them acting themselves out in your body and your mind your soul your theophany Rises up and shouts for Joy how can I overcome and there's always been an arc in God's economy there was an ark in the days of Noah for the saving of the people there was an ark in the days of the law the Ark of testimony in the days of the law following they followed the ark and there is a third dispensation now like Noah's time Lots time and now this time and there's an ark now and that Arc is not a denomination neither is it good works that you can do it's by one Spirit Romans 81 we are all all baptized into one body in the domain of that Kingdom one spiritual baptism no matter how good how bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by the Holy Ghost baptism see that's the only way you can overcome It's all under the shed blood his Overcomers because you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcome for you you are resting Ephesians 28 and N for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast Psalms 141:8 but mine eyes are unto thee Oh God am the Lord in thee is my trust leave not my soul destitute if like the high priest my soul has entered the holy of holies it must be in motion continually the high priest that went behind the veil he had on the bottom of His Garment bells and pomegranates and as he walked the bells and pomeranets rang together and that behind the veil there was a continual ringing cuz he was continually moving amen aren't you continually moving on Amen can you stand still in the gospel and prosper like the high priest my soul has entered the holy of holies it must be in motion continually holy holy holy holy unto the Lord one service brother brandham came down off of the platform to pray for the people he said I'm coming down to the people holy holy holy your soul is not limited to the three dimensions like your body is that's right remember your soul with the Holy Ghost life himself is not a type or a shadow of anything but you as the product the antitype you are what the whole Bible has has spoke of in all of its types and shadows John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the original that word is logos in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God yes and the same was in the beginning with God all things were were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made that includes me amen and that includes youen in him was life and the life was the light of man and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not and the Webster's Dictionary comprehended means to understand in the Hebrew or the Greek that this came from the word comprehended means it had no power over that to stop it to start it am or anything else you were in complete control of that light because you are the light just as someone came up along and spoke to you they were light to you you are the light that shines in the darkness to others those that were there with him at the foundation of the world not in flesh not in thought it was greater than a thought it was more positive than a thought yes sir almost like you were a part of him yes until you could become a part of him Colossians 4 verse two continue in prayer and watch the same with Thanksgiving with all praying also for us that God would open us would open unto us a door of utterance logos the same word utterance in Colossians 4:2 is the same word word in John 1:1 it was not a written word on a page it was not a form that you saw in a cloud well that looks like a word no no this didn't just look like a word any appearance of it to an individual idual they know for a fact it was a Loos that God would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ for which I am also in bonds that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak questions and answers what you are here get this in your mind now this is not brother Mike speaking this is the prophet Messenger to the last AG amen what you are here is a sign that you are some something else somewhere am you always wanted to be in Perfection you Christians there is a Perfection and that Perfection is not in this life right but this life ends nothing this life could we compare it to the little peep that came out of the egg no it's the little peep that's still in the egg that's waiting to be hatched out into something real that can move and can speak and can love amen every man and woman here that is a Christian every person that is a Christian here now is already glorified in the presence of Jesus Christ and you've got another body you won't have some other time you have right now right now there's another body waiting for you if this one should perish could you think of that study that just a minute brother Bram said that theop body waiting to receive you that if the Earthly habitat habitation of this Tabernacle should be dissolved we have one already waiting in the Heavenly that's the scripture right right that's what he's talking about amen he's talking about your soul your theophany your body that's waiting for you somewhere can't be far away because sometimes you know it's here yeah sometimes you think it's there you've got another body you won't have some other time you have right now amen right now there's another body waiting for you if this one should perish you think of that study that just a minute think about what brother brandom said beyond the curtain of time he fell asleep on the bed with his hands back of his head but he looked around and it was full of young people maybe this is Sunday school maybe yeah maybe they're going to have classes after a bit they're all young they're all yeah is this college is it no it was not no right because all those young people that he saw there were Souls that had been saved by the grace of God Amen some of them in the very early ages they took them and dipped their hair in pitch and tied them to a steak and burned them like like a candle you couldn't tell it now some of them were eaten by lions you couldn't tell it now because they went their soul not their mind their soul went from that body that some evil evil person tried to destroy they destroyed the flesh they couldn't touch the soul if they had a spear as long as this Sanctuary they still couldn't Pierce their soul with it that's right amen what would you have to have to pierce their soul you'd have to have the love of Jesus Christ spoken by the anointing of God Amen that will pierce your soul that's right brother amen excuse me a minute like everything with Pages you got to make sure you're the right page one two buckle my shoe three four Run for the door you've got another body you won't have some other time you have it right now 2 Corinthians 51 is where we were going for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands eat Eternal in the [Music] heavens brother Mike who was one time a relatively young man in the next few days will turn from 82 to 83 my soul is the same age it always was it's Eternal yes amen it never gets a day older it never gets a day weaker but it is a comfort to me yes day and night yes every person that is a Christian here now is already glorified in the presence of Jesus Christ and you've got another body you won't have some other time you have right now yes amen you think of that study that a minute that's where I stopped wasn't it 2 Corinthians 51 for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens well look at that it's in the scripture too for in this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so being that clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do grown being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon yes that mortality might be swallowed up of Life reality the reality of what how God has sold us in a person that never was born he always was yes he always is he always will [Music] be when he tells you he loves you he's telling you he loved you then amen he loves you now amen and there is never a time that will come that he doesn't love you and he wants to care for you like he cares for himself sir for we know if this Tabernacle of this habit Earthly House of this Tabernacle with dissolve we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we Gran earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven amen so if so being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle to Gran being burdened not that would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that has roll us for the self same thing is God who has given unto us the earnest of the spirit the down payment therefore we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him God providing healing for this generation why if I went into a department store and they said all this is yours all that is mine too excuse me all this is yours odd look on every shelf to see what belonged to me and some of these things that's up high I couldn't hardly reach them I'd go get me a step ladder and i' get up so I could look around find out what it's all about wouldn't you do that yeah that's the way when we come into Christ yeah if something seems just a little high Step Up In The Gospel ranks and find out what belongs to you God's got a step letter that reaches Plumbing to Glory Jacob saw it one night with angels coming up and down from Earth to Glory it's all yours God provided it for you just get on it tonight and climb right on out of this Earth down people here that says the days of Miracles are passed we are not Earthbound people we are heavenbound people filled with the Holy Ghost climbing the ladder going to Glory everything along the road belongs to us everything Jesus died for belongs to us sure don't none of you think you're poor you have riches that this world cannot imagine eternal life eternal health 19 to 21 years old actually you won't be 19 to 21 years old you will have a body that looks similar to a person who was 19 to 21 right but in that body you were never a little kid you'll never be an old man you will be that same condition not age not age condition you will be that same way forever and ever and ever how many Evers can you put on there there is no end to the string of them everything along the road belongs to us Everything Jesus died for belongs to us what went you out to see God doesn't send you to hell for being a sinner God sends you to hell because you won't repent and take Christ as your savior you refuse to take the right Road you send yourself to torment you send your own soul to its Eternal destination right upon the free moral agency of your own convictions amen God does not send anyone to hell he never did and he never will men send themselves to hell because they refuse to accept the way of salvation God is God is longsuffering he doesn't want any to perish never wanted it but man rather walk in darkness than to walk in light for which cause we faint not 2 Corinthians 416 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh far uh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal for if we know that our Earthly House of this Tabernacle would dissolved we have a building of God and a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven right go wake Jesus is any wonderful congregation says amen now think we mean that everything is surrendered I'm no more my own thinking I ain't going to think like I think Lord I'm just going to think like you think and you promise that I was healed I think that I Surrender my thinking I won't no more think about my sickness I won't more think about the disease I had I ain't thinking about nothing but what but thinking what you said now right out in front of you stands a person just like you was a few minutes ago you were sick down here but there's a well person standing there Jesus Christ is calling you to that well person right Beyond it now you just by faith as you close your eyes walk right into that well body amen see then you just keep on walking am just keep on going I surrender all the Lord bless you we're almost done like in in this world everything comes to an end I've only got one more page to turn at the end of this will be the beginning of something else end time evangelism oh I think they're so cute little fellas I like all people but children but I think children and then old people when you get old some old man or woman come down along the way so feeble and I think they're just pitiful like you know and I just think we should never you see them crossing the street stop what if that was your daddy or your mother see somebody so respect them and they talk maybe slow and a long time maybe even like brother Mike see them crossing the street stop what if that was your daddy or mother somebody so respect them and they talk maybe slow and a long time maybe maybe sometime they repeats too and maybe things that you don't want to hear but remember you may get old you may get old too someday so just always respect them and them little fellas who could mistreat one of those by the way you should never do that you know Jesus said to take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for their Angels always behold my father's face which is in heaven yes right remember they have an angel when you're born it stays with you all through life and now and then when you get saved and now then when you get saved you have the Holy Spirit then and it guides you and directs you questions and answers now he would if you notice Matthew 18:10 he was speaking about little children they was little children Little Tots three four years years old picked them up they brought them unto him children child children comes from the word name of child a child is just a little fell not an infant but between that and teenagers see he's not responsible yet for himself now he said take heed that you don't despise if you really take that interpretation of that word is mistreat see to mistreat one of those mistreat a child you should never do that they're children they don't know see and now notice because their Angels always beholds my father's face which is in heaven you see in other words that their Angels their Messengers their bodies the Angelic bodies that they'll go to if they die are always before my father's face in heaven it's not written on the page right there but it's written on all these Pages it's their theophany it's their soul always before my father's face in heaven Hebrews chapter 2 now when man becomes that body he had control of all the fishes he's back in Genesis all the foul and beast of the field and then there was no man to till the soil he done made man male and female no man to till the soil then God made Man Out of the Dust of the earth give him a hand like a chimpanzee give him a foot like a bear he made him on the image and this Earthly body is in the image of animal life it's made out of the same kind of material your body is the same kind of material as a horse or a dog anything like that it's made out of calcium poage petroleum Cosmic light All Flesh like that is not the same flesh it's different flesh but it's made out of the Dust of the Earth where it come from but the difference between an animal and a man you are not an animal you have flesh like an animal but you were not an animal God put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany last one unchangeable word of God oh my you go down at the restaurant get a bowl of soup and there' be a spider in it you'd sue the restaurant then you'll let the devil cram cigarettes tobacco and sin down your throat to damn that Soul that's worth 10,000 worlds and then talk about civilization oh my the wheels turn backwards again yes sir them boys standing there looked at that and the one looked at the other said Jack we're not worth much are we 84 cents that was the price of a body back in 1960 I said wait a minute boys you got a soul in there that's worth 10,000 World God bless you brother [Applause] amen anybody stand me the real you the real you more real than the person standing in front of you now the real you is that the aony how many times have I told y'all God ever loved you he can un love you you hear people you hear people say God don't love me no more there an it is an impossibility for God to change his mind that's right if he loved you before he love you now and he's going to love you all the way into eternity yes amen and uh I appreciate what our brother had to say he's a he's a seasoned veteran he preached a sermon I'll let the girls get ready downstairs when when this church was just that was the wall and the seats were this way no door there the door was

guy and he told me I was worthless he said there was more of me in the septic tank than there was in the that standing in front of [Laughter] him from the pull pit burst my bubble but he still

ground to begin with than they are U standing in front of you that's how worthless but how much is that inside guy 10,000 worlds one world would be okay but 10,000 worlds like this one that's how God
