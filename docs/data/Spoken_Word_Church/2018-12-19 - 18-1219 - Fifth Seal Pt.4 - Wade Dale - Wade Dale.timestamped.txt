[4:09] a Christian he said it should be
[4:11] Christmas every day and that's true they
[4:13] should be we got the greatest gift that
[4:15] ever was and and some people you know
[4:17] what some people keep him in a manger
[4:19] some people keep him on a cross but we
[4:23] got him in our heart that same baby that

[4:27] they've come and lived and died and come
[4:29] back he's in me and you today
[4:31] he's in same person same guy so when we

[4:36] where we're talking about the gut when
[4:37] the little man started but you know what
[4:39] he's living in your heart tonight as a
[4:42] full grown man but he had to start as a
[4:45] baby somewhere to be what to be our
[4:47] brother so that he could feel our
[4:49] infirmary so he could feel the things
[4:52] that we go through be a teenager be a
[4:53] little boy and do the things of life but
[4:57] to thank God that we have a God that'll
[4:59] do that you know I was thinking back
[5:01] there in the back to just Regina you
[5:04] know you
[5:06] some people may snicker at a dog having
[5:08] diabetes but it's just as important as
[5:10] the life of that dog just as important
[5:13] you know and what Satan has done and
[5:16] he's put that big demon on us and now
[5:18] he's putting it in the in nature you
[5:22] never heard of a dog being a diabetic 20
[5:24] years ago 30 40 years ago now Satan has
[5:27] just jumped in there you know it's not
[5:28] God but the whole world is groaning and
[5:33] waiting for the manifestation of the
[5:36] sons of God so that little puppy is
[5:37] waiting on us to come to a place and I
[5:42] believe that we're heading in the right
[5:43] direction so let's bow our heads and

[5:47] sister Christine and the girls and

[7:15] anything Lord just be the active
[7:17] participant in this service you do the
[7:19] speaking you do the hearing Lord and
[7:21] you're the only one that can do the
[7:22] revealing father just be with us now and
[7:25] the furthermore this service in Jesus
[7:26] Christ's name we pray amen all right
[7:30] tonight we're gonna take the fifth seal
[7:31] again as we were before but what we're
[7:34] going to do tonight is is we're going to
[7:37] look at we're going to background just a
[7:39] minute but we're going to look at the
[7:41] transgression what put Israel in its
[7:45] place because they were the bride
[7:50] of Jehova I'm gonna read your script
[7:54] where he says I was married to them in
[7:57] other words I were gonna read it here in
[7:59] Ezekiel that that he pretty much he said
[8:02] I found you naked I found you you were
[8:04] bloody and you were this and you were
[8:06] that and I clothed you I watched you did
[8:08] all these things and then see what you
[8:10] did to me so I had to put you away and
[8:12] give you a writing of divorcement but
[8:15] you know what and to see the grace of
[8:17] marriage and divorce to me I have to see
[8:19] the fifth seal to see the grace of
[8:20] marriage and divorce because God had
[8:23] Grace on those people brother Danny he
[8:24] just didn't kill him and kick him out no
[8:26] he put a place for him there's really
[8:28] two places for them there's the Jew over
[8:30] here actually there's three there's a
[8:32] Jew that's gonna be born again that
[8:34] receives God receives the Holy Ghost in
[8:36] their soul there's a Jew the 144,000
[8:39] that's gonna be after we leave that's
[8:40] gonna receive this message by the fifth
[8:43] Elijah and receive the Holy Ghost and
[8:46] then then there's that fifth seal group
[8:49] that's gonna be given eternal life and
[8:50] they don't have nothing to do with that
[8:53] God's gonna do it for them and that's
[8:55] the one we're gonna talk about tonight
[8:57] so in other words let's let's read
[8:59] revelation 6 and then we can be seated
[9:02] when he had opened the fifth seal I saw
[9:04] under the altar the souls of them that
[9:06] were slain for the word of God
[9:08] now watch the wording here and for the
[9:10] testimony which they held not the
[9:12] testimony of Jesus Christ and they cried
[9:15] see that these people didn't know about
[9:17] him and they cried with a loud voice
[9:19] saying how long O Lord holy and true
[9:21] just I'll not judge and avenge our blood
[9:23] on them that dwell on the earth they
[9:26] they've got a little bit of temperance
[9:28] that they didn't get rid of while it was
[9:29] over here all right and white robes were
[9:32] given unto every one of them and it was
[9:35] said unto them that they should rest for
[9:36] yet a little season until their
[9:37] fellow-servants also and their brethren
[9:39] that should be killed as they were
[9:40] should be fulfilled you may be seated in
[9:44] the Lord I just blessing to the reading
[9:45] of the word now tonight we're just going
[9:47] to kind of review real quick we know one
[9:50] thing's for sure that we are Gentiles we
[9:53] are not Jews
[9:56] you know and it's okay to to look at the
[10:00] types and the shadows and and pretend
[10:02] you're Jew but it's just pretending you
[10:06] can't be a Jew okay you're a Gentile I'm
[10:10] talking to you in this building they may
[10:11] be one of the line that's watching this
[10:13] listen Jew by heritage but I you have to
[10:15] say that sister Gina because you never
[10:17] know you know
[10:18] but these people that are sitting in
[10:20] this building have no they're not full
[10:23] fledged 100% juice so I'm not talking to
[10:26] that I'm talking to the Gentiles you and
[10:28] I did not have a promise you and I at
[10:31] first were not married to Jehovah we had
[10:35] nothing to do with Jehovah we were
[10:38] actually listen to me through the Old
[10:40] Testament only just a few times does the
[10:44] Gentiles look like they're on the Jews
[10:48] side
[10:49] I said look like because they're
[10:51] Gentiles they're dogs
[10:53] Jesus called them dogs okay the Old
[10:56] Testament called them don't you know
[10:57] they they really just didn't like
[11:00] anybody that wasn't you alright so there
[11:03] was a separation and even God said
[11:05] separate yourself don't even marry see
[11:08] that was the problem with Balaam Balaam
[11:11] couldn't curse Israel because Israel had
[11:14] the blessing on them but what did bail
[11:16] them do that shrewd devil inside of
[11:19] Balaam said okay I'm not going to curse
[11:21] them but you know what I'm gonna send
[11:23] some real good-looking Moabite women and
[11:26] I'm gonna send some real good i'ts down
[11:28] there some K nights and some highlights
[11:30] and some Jebusites and I'm gonna mingle
[11:34] with them and what I'm gonna do is I'm
[11:36] going to cause them to commit adultery
[11:38] so he got him one way or the other he
[11:40] got him he just didn't get them the way
[11:43] the way that that Balaam and him wanted
[11:46] to get him at first cuz he wanted to
[11:48] call whoever that was Baylock wanted to
[11:50] call down curses on Israel and just
[11:53] destroy the whole nation Balaam said I
[11:55] can't do that I can't curse at something
[11:59] that God's blessed and when you still
[12:01] can't curse something God's blessed look
[12:03] at that little compared to the world
[12:06] Israel is not even a pimple
[12:09] it's not even a period at the end of a
[12:12] sentence compared to this whole world
[12:14] but they stand alone and nobody messes
[12:18] with them hardly a man why because
[12:21] that's that's God's land you know we
[12:23] talk about the star thing about this
[12:25] other day we talked about the the son of
[12:27] man son of God son of David but now
[12:30] brother branham interjects one in there
[12:32] son of Abraham because son of Abraham
[12:35] I'm going to read it here in the minutes
[12:36] and I'm gonna talk about son of Abraham
[12:37] but what God did God said I'm going to
[12:40] disperse you because of your adultery
[12:42] but I'm going to bring you back to my
[12:45] lent to your land that I give you so
[12:48] that little spot over there in Israel is
[12:50] their land that's the Royal grant that
[12:53] Abraham brother
[12:54] I mean brother brother Jesus brother
[12:57] Jehovah told Abraham where every year
[13:00] I'm getting old gene wherever your feet
[13:02] walk that's your land
[13:04] okay so wherever he walked that's where
[13:07] Israel are the children of Israel
[13:09] they're gonna get their land they're not
[13:10] gonna get you know Reubens not going to
[13:12] get China you know Benjamin's not gonna
[13:18] get the United States
[13:20] that's for Gentiles that's for the bride
[13:23] but they're going to get their spot in
[13:25] what Israel or Jerusalem they have their
[13:29] spot that God had told them they were
[13:31] going to get so now they're dispersed
[13:33] but now what they're coming home to come
[13:35] back to the homeland cuz the only way
[13:37] they're going to get blessed is to be in
[13:38] the homeland all right so we got to
[13:40] bring this Jewish part in here but
[13:43] remember just review the police up on
[13:45] the board because the first four seals
[13:49] happen during the church ages that all
[13:52] right say man we've we've been one year
[13:55] on this so you ought to be able as soon
[13:56] as I say that you should say yeah that's
[13:58] exactly what it is one year we started
[14:01] in February of last year I know I'm slow
[14:04] pull that up on the board please
[14:10] well steal number one white righteous
[14:14] Church seal number two a Red Horse seal
[14:16] number three a black horse and look at
[14:18] the what we've got is them as the to me
[14:21] this is your seal to me this is your
[14:25] Thunder that's what it's telling that's
[14:28] the unwritten part justification is
[14:31] though you never did it sanctification
[14:32] through the statue of a perfect man and
[14:34] the new birth our adoption not this new
[14:36] birth down here remember we received the
[14:38] spirit of adoption whereby we cry father
[14:41] father but that's not crying up here the
[14:44] where the where the disciples were they
[14:49] weren't crying to God all the time
[14:52] silver and gold have I none but such as
[14:54] I have I give unto thee that's not
[14:56] crying
[14:56] that's authority but now they didn't
[14:59] come to to adoption like we know
[15:01] adoption like brother Branham came to
[15:04] adoption and we've come into adoption to
[15:07] where the heads because they didn't get
[15:08] the headstone they didn't get the head
[15:11] to headstones rejected it only come back
[15:13] under the son of man ministry and this
[15:15] endtime in this age just like we were
[15:18] talking about last Sunday or something
[15:20] yeah Sunday before last Sunday ten full
[15:23] life
[15:24] when we see the Son of God dispensation
[15:26] down through the seven Church ages when
[15:28] we come into the Son of Man revelation
[15:30] it has to be a different thought process
[15:32] so if not you're going to miss they miss
[15:35] Jesus with the same old trick remember I
[15:38] was doing this with the same old
[15:40] tradition they call Jesus a demon God
[15:44] came just like the Bible said he was
[15:47] gonna come and they called him a devil
[15:49] so why we keep doing this we need to
[15:51] turn and go this way a new thought
[15:54] process not not a new revelation or a
[15:57] new Bible or no same Bible we have not
[16:02] read a strange scripture in a year
[16:04] for them it might have not been revealed
[16:07] to us yet but it's not a strange
[16:10] scripture so it's not a scriptures I
[16:13] pulled out of the air somewhere amen
[16:15] so seal number four is the pale horse
[16:17] which is all the riders mixed together
[16:20] the Antichrist is gonna make his ride
[16:23] he's gonna have his superpower that side
[16:27] that seal has been broke and the
[16:31] underlying meaning is is when we come to
[16:33] this fourth seal and get a revelation of
[16:35] all this together death will be
[16:39] destroyed the word will be made flesh
[16:42] and we'll take a body change because the
[16:44] bride is caught up in seal number four
[16:46] not seen again until she comes riding
[16:49] back in the Millennium with Jesus Christ
[16:52] in revelations chapter 19 is that
[16:55] alright say ma'am
[16:56] amen alright so the rest of that you
[16:58] said well what do we need to do just
[16:59] tear that out know we get wet remember
[17:02] we're always spiritual Israel always we
[17:06] get the spiritual part of Israel and
[17:09] then because remember you and I can top
[17:11] the fifth seal Jew you and I can type it
[17:15] because did you want Christ
[17:18] did you want when you walked in sin you
[17:21] didn't say a man died on the cross and
[17:25] gave me eternal life did you say that no
[17:28] you didn't cuz I didn't either and be
[17:31] honest you didn't care cuz if you'd have
[17:33] cared you wouldn't have done what you
[17:35] did let's just be honest let's just get
[17:37] down where we live all right
[17:39] I wasn't thinking about the cross when I
[17:41] was doing the things I was doing if I
[17:43] would I would have went to the cross and
[17:44] finally one day when God knocked I
[17:47] believe for the last time I believe I
[17:48] responded and that's to me what happens
[17:51] to all of us we responded and then we
[17:56] responded to what the Word of God some
[17:58] preacher somebody told us and it sparked
[18:03] something in our life that now we look
[18:07] to Calvary every day we live under
[18:12] Calvary every day we didn't before
[18:17] neither that's the fifth sealed you
[18:19] remember we put we put the altar here
[18:20] put the fifth sealed you under that
[18:22] altar well the altar listen like I said
[18:24] before and those you weren't here this
[18:26] is not the altar this is the place to
[18:30] come for prayer sure but this is a
[18:33] Methodist tradition to come up here to
[18:36] an altar to be prayed for I read you all
[18:39] the quotes and I hope it didn't hurt
[18:40] your feelings cuz object the Prophet
[18:42] said I didn't get mad at him but the
[18:46] altar the altar is the cross we all live
[18:52] under the altar of the cross looking to
[18:55] what Calvary did for us and even the
[18:59] souls under the altar that was in the
[19:01] sixth dimension amen the ones that
[19:05] brother Branham saw went across the
[19:06] curtain of time he saw them in the sixth
[19:07] dimension the angel called it souls
[19:10] under the altar well it's not the fifth
[19:12] seal sold under the altar but what was
[19:13] it it was he said well where's Jesus he
[19:16] said what he's a little higher because
[19:18] this cross now that man that hung on
[19:21] that cross he's got an eternal body now
[19:28] he's got an eternal glorified body he
[19:31] did not have it when he was on Calvary
[19:34] dying but in the resurrection he comes
[19:38] up with a glorified body never to die
[19:42] again never to suffer again remember the
[19:45] Bible said he suffered once for all but
[19:49] what do we do we put him back on the
[19:51] cross what was it brother Brown said
[19:53] that what the Catholics if somebody
[19:55] couldn't get him off the cross we always
[19:57] look at Jesus on the cross no I look in
[19:59] an empty cross in an empty tomb he's not
[20:04] there he's reside ycq the living among
[20:10] the dead why do we do that when he's
[20:14] right here the same man that died the
[20:17] same man that rose the same man came
[20:20] back on the day of Pentecost is the same
[20:21] man that lives in my heart in your heart
[20:23] if you're born again tonight so we're
[20:26] under the altar of what God did for us
[20:30] he gave his soul a ransom Isaiah 52 he
[20:33] gave his soul ransom so he could see us
[20:35] what seed you and I spiritual
[20:41] multiplication not natural I'm looking
[20:43] at natural multiplication but that
[20:46] inside man didn't have to have a man and
[20:49] a woman an inside man had a man that
[20:54] could speak Satan can't even do that he
[20:56] has to borrow a body he has to incarnate
[21:01] we're not going to this time anymore
[21:03] money no but we're under the altar of
[21:08] what God did for us and we're not in a
[21:12] glorified condition the sixth seal
[21:13] people are not in the gorton sorry the
[21:16] sixth dimension people are not in the
[21:17] glorified condition they're in
[21:19] theophanies but they don't have an
[21:22] eternal human body like the flesh right
[21:25] the bow right with that so they're right
[21:27] here they're under an altar because
[21:29] remember brother Branham said and I'll
[21:31] skip the quote if you don't mind he said
[21:34] I want to see him the angel said you
[21:36] can't see him he's a little higher what
[21:39] he's in the seventh
[21:40] Inchon where only one man has reached
[21:44] immortality one man so I listen I don't
[21:49] you give me whatever quotes you won't
[21:50] you give me whatever man says the Bible
[21:53] says only one man has reached
[21:55] immortality there's only one empty tomb
[21:58] every other tomb has got something in it
[22:02] or the Bible's wrong amen
[22:07] now they're waiting somewhere even
[22:11] listen even you may not agree with this
[22:17] but even in the bosom of Abraham was
[22:20] just a place that they put the soul with
[22:22] that God put the soul waiting a time for
[22:25] Calvary they weren't eternal no how
[22:32] could the Witch of Endor call an eternal
[22:34] person back into this dimension no
[22:37] brother Brown said that was under the
[22:38] boy of the bulls and goats that she
[22:40] could do that can't do that now but when
[22:43] she brought him up he wasn't a young man
[22:48] he was the way he died why do you call
[22:58] me and the Witch of Endor said oh man
[23:01] that Samuel brother branham said it she
[23:04] looked at him and said he had still had
[23:06] the prophets robe on he looked just like
[23:09] he did when he died so you can tell then
[23:12] that wasn't a glorified theophany that
[23:15] was eternal so anybody in the Old
[23:17] Testament under bulls and goats their
[23:19] soul had to go over into a place of
[23:20] holding called Abraham's bosom and had
[23:23] to wait until Calvary then Calvary was
[23:26] emptied out and whatever you want to say
[23:28] they didn't come back and get a human
[23:30] body
[23:32] they couldn't have because they without
[23:35] us cannot be made perfect our brother
[23:38] branham or that angel would have had
[23:39] this table now brother brown nice people
[23:41] up there with him no he said you can't
[23:44] go there he's a little higher well man
[23:48] how much higher can you get well your
[23:49] glory five buddies how high is the
[23:51] highest point you can get and that's
[23:53] what we're heading toward a glorified
[23:54] body not this body but this body made
[23:58] new a man this body considering
[24:03] Redemption so everybody's under an altar
[24:06] not an altar the Bible says the only
[24:10] altar you have is your altar of your
[24:11] heart right an altar of flesh cuz
[24:16] Ezekiel when we read it in just a few
[24:18] minutes Ezekiel says I'll give you a new
[24:20] heart here sell give me a new altar he
[24:23] said I'll give you a new heart all right
[24:28] so this fifth seal Jew is one that has
[24:31] been put in a place if you want to pull
[24:34] that back up brother Joe or whoever back
[24:38] there I'm gonna pull that back up we'll
[24:40] look now when we get to the fifth seal
[24:43] like I said a couple Sundays ago when we
[24:47] get into this fifth seal we've got to
[24:49] lap it back underneath because we went
[24:52] through the church ages thereby alright
[24:54] with them
[24:56] there's your church ages seven of them
[24:59] it started at Calvary let's don't be
[25:02] technical
[25:03] it started at Calvary I know it started
[25:05] an eighty thirty something and went a
[25:07] little bit later when the Holy Ghost
[25:08] fell but that's the time we're looking
[25:10] at when Jesus died on the cross what
[25:13] happened that Holy Ghost came back on
[25:16] the group of believers called the bride
[25:18] that was his new bride that was his new
[25:22] bride that wasn't his bride in the Old
[25:23] Testament that was his new bride
[25:25] he had divorced the old bride and took
[25:28] the new bride and remember she won't do
[25:31] like the first bride did that's why he
[25:34] took her now sure they went off into the
[25:37] denominationalism and things like that
[25:38] but he's gonna have a true bride it's
[25:41] not got her skirts not gonna be defiled
[25:43] and that's where we are we're right
[25:45] about the I told you were right about
[25:47] that little dot right there and that's
[25:49] where we are so we've had four seals
[25:52] then we've had a rapture now the fifth
[25:55] seal is to truly when we leave its to
[25:57] the Jews and the Jews only right only to
[26:01] the Jews but you can't leave it over
[26:03] here for us because then we need to
[26:06] throw five six and seven out the door
[26:07] because when I'm gonna be here no what
[26:09] are we doing we're going to take this
[26:10] and we're going to put right back here
[26:12] the fifth seal happens well we can put
[26:14] it around here cuz it happens right here
[26:17] in this time here all right
[26:23] do we okay with that so now the fifth
[26:27] seal to us then the thunder under the
[26:30] fifth seal is not left us the souls
[26:32] under the altar it's that we're there so
[26:35] justified listen if God's justified them
[26:37] and they don't care nothing about him
[26:41] what about a group of people hallelujah
[26:44] that he justifies that really won't it
[26:46] they really know how how he did it and
[26:49] how he coming the whole plan of
[26:51] redemption the real you never did it
[26:55] that's what we got to say
[26:58] regardless of whether we get older or
[27:01] whether we get sag that doesn't matter
[27:04] the real you never did it if he did you
[27:14] couldn't get to that place you got to
[27:19] start all back over again because it
[27:21] can't be a spot they can't be a blemish
[27:24] they can't be nothing held against that
[27:27] person inside of you if you born again
[27:28] to not there is nothing nothing there is
[27:31] no dark spot there is no anything the
[27:37] only thing is going to hinder you is
[27:39] what I'm looking at right now amen
[27:44] that person inside of you
[27:48] can create a world we read it and go
[27:52] live on it if you weren't barred by
[27:55] these first three dimensions that we're
[27:56] in right now a lifeline didn't matter
[27:58] so I said when we get to this fifth seal
[28:00] you've got to enter into another
[28:01] dimension another another thought
[28:04] process because when John went to the
[28:07] fourth seal he saw there was no more
[28:09] beast and then he says the fifth seal
[28:12] when the fish Hill opened I saw souls
[28:13] under the altar so he had to see into
[28:17] another dimension because they're not in
[28:18] this dimension they're in another
[28:21] dimension somewhere in a theophany
[28:24] waiting I believe they're waiting on me
[28:28] and you cuz I'm going back to Hebrews
[28:29] 11:40 they without us can I be made
[28:33] perfect now they're crying how long how
[28:36] long to avenge our blood now they're
[28:38] waiting on the 144,000 but who's the
[28:41] 144,000 waiting oh let's just throw it
[28:44] all the way back anyway no nice to get
[28:47] out of here
[28:48] they cannot they can't one of them get
[28:52] saved while we're here but you gotta
[28:55] remember 144,000 and two
[29:00] the two prophets they gotta be saved you
[29:03] know they gotta be they got to be saved
[29:05] to give salvation to the Jews but
[29:08] they're waiting on us to get out of the
[29:09] way so that God can deal with them now
[29:11] that's God telling him I'm gonna bring
[29:14] you back into this land and I'm gonna do
[29:16] all these things for you but I'm gonna
[29:18] read you what he did mm-hmm
[29:20] what he told them now let's skip some of
[29:24] this if you don't mind I think we've we
[29:26] know that this is the seals are a plan
[29:29] of redemption it's not just sealed one
[29:31] two three four five six seven and it's
[29:33] the breaking of the seal sure that was
[29:34] already broke
[29:36] Jesus preached him 2,000 years ago and
[29:40] broke the airwaves and said this is what
[29:43] this seal is then we had a prophet come
[29:46] along in the endtime and God came to
[29:48] that prophet amen and broke those seals
[29:52] every day totally different than what he
[29:55] believed a man remember he was heading
[29:59] in this direction the angel turned him
[30:02] in this direction so you and I what's
[30:05] going to happen to you and I we can't
[30:06] keep going in this direction we got to
[30:09] go in this direction and you know what
[30:13] if you're born again and we're going
[30:14] through all these statue of a perfect
[30:16] man and we're growing in grace and
[30:18] knowledge then we've got to come to a
[30:21] place to where we do see that the real
[30:24] you never did it and there's not a hint
[30:26] of sin anywhere in that person you are
[30:29] because I'm telling you if there's a
[30:31] hint of sin and that in that fifth seal
[30:34] Jew how can he get a white robe and I
[30:36] say he now now listen I say he but
[30:39] there's there's women in there too
[30:40] okay and I was asked this question one
[30:44] time before because remember in the Old
[30:45] Testament they didn't count the lineage
[30:47] of the women so really it's really if
[30:51] you technically see 144,000 people being
[30:53] saved
[30:54] that's the men of the household that's
[30:57] not counting the women in the children
[30:59] so there's more than 144,000 that's
[31:02] going to be saved but it's got to go by
[31:05] what the 12,000 of this tribe 12,000
[31:07] this trouble and it was the men didn't
[31:10] count the women and children it was the
[31:11] men so see we're looking at a bigger
[31:13] group but God's got to save that man
[31:15] first they got to hear the gospel and
[31:18] the read they not gonna hear it listen
[31:20] you come to church next Sunday you know
[31:23] one thing's for sure Israel's not gonna
[31:26] hear from God the 144,000 if you come to
[31:31] church so in the afternoon no one thinks
[31:33] for sure the 144,000 they're not going
[31:35] to hear from God you come to church next
[31:38] Wednesday night can I keep going okay
[31:41] nevermind so when you walk through that
[31:43] door you remember one thing's for sure
[31:45] while you're here they're not getting
[31:47] anything so you and I are holding this
[31:51] that alright if you look at it that way
[31:55] maybe we'll see it a little different
[31:56] with every time we walk in bro the board
[31:58] what we're doing we're pushing time
[31:59] we're pushing time we keep pushing time
[32:02] but one day you know what one day time
[32:07] will be no longer somebody will come to
[32:11] that place and God will rapture group of
[32:14] people and he will go to the Jews he
[32:17] promised he would he said he was gonna
[32:19] do it but you and I have got to get this
[32:22] lined up and I believe we're doing it
[32:26] I believe we don't wonder I ain't gonna
[32:29] water up here Bob's not here okay
[32:32] can somebody get me a glass of water a
[32:34] bottle of water for I'm gonna drink out
[32:36] when Lauren's got in her hand
[32:37] yeah I'm just kidding just kidding I
[32:41] know you would I know I know you would
[32:45] it's okay all right let's go - I don't
[32:50] have to read all these cuz remember
[32:52] brother branham always thought before we
[32:54] went across the curtain of time his
[32:55] thought process was that if he went to
[32:58] wherever he died and went to heaven him
[33:01] and brother Neville couldn't shake hands
[33:03] they could talk to each other but they'd
[33:04] just pass by each other nothing solid oh
[33:07] I don't have to read all this then now
[33:09] but remember for God to set him up to
[33:12] see this fifth seal Jew and then for him
[33:14] to go across the curtain of time he had
[33:16] to go across the curtain of time to see
[33:18] that those people are real that's what
[33:21] he says right here they're real I can
[33:25] feel him I could hear him I could see
[33:28] him I could touch him there were real
[33:31] people but then God had to show him
[33:36] let's go ahead and go to number four and
[33:40] read in the fifth seal said now in the
[33:42] ninth verse souls under the altar now
[33:44] here's where I was going to get some
[33:45] real disagreement thank you buddy but
[33:49] just watch this for a minute I thought
[33:50] that too but it didn't come that way
[33:53] I've always thought that those souls
[33:54] under the altar were the martyrs of the
[33:56] other church now what brother Branham
[33:58] was doing he was looking
[34:01] here goes everybody this died is under
[34:06] that altar of the cross there in the six
[34:11] dimension but that's not the fifth
[34:15] sealed you remember the fifth seal Jew
[34:17] doesn't come until after we're gone that
[34:19] the revelation comes now you understand
[34:22] that the revelation of the fifth seal
[34:24] Jew because remember they're already
[34:26] there the fifth seal Jews already we're
[34:30] there got where they're at because
[34:33] brother Brown said that's right the ones
[34:35] who were killed under Eichmann and
[34:36] Hitler and all those people all the way
[34:37] back to right here I believe right so
[34:42] there weren't they're actually in a
[34:43] place and they're beings they're
[34:45] theophanies because remember they talked
[34:52] to John I just read it they said how
[34:59] long how long to avenge our blood all
[35:04] the ones that are what they did it to
[35:06] them while they were on the earth so
[35:08] they got knowledge they're people that's
[35:11] our problem we thought well we die we
[35:14] get lesser we get more we get less
[35:16] because we're so what no no listen that
[35:19] releases that eternal life that's in you
[35:23] and that's the greatest thing so he
[35:30] thought it was the murders of the early
[35:31] church but it was not so he was going in
[35:33] this direction and got stood up that's a
[35:36] whole different group and the reason
[35:38] it's a whole different group is because
[35:40] I'm gonna give you a revelation of this
[35:41] fifth seal I'm gonna give eternal life
[35:45] to a group of people that don't even
[35:46] know who I am
[35:48] amen the fifth said you look to get this
[35:52] out of your head the fifth seal Jew it's
[35:54] not the 144,000 the fifth seal Jew is
[35:58] not anyone that's died since Christ will
[36:02] now that has the baptism of the Holy
[36:03] Ghost in there so everybody got that
[36:06] same am it's a special I mean a special
[36:10] group of people but now who are you
[36:14] what are you you're a special group of
[36:18] people that God's put in this dimension
[36:21] to get them out of that dimension
[36:23] because remember they ain't gonna stay
[36:24] in that fifth dimension all the time
[36:26] they're coming out they're gonna be
[36:29] where we can see them I thought so
[36:35] myself but when the Holy Spirit showed
[36:36] the vision it wasn't it isn't the soul
[36:39] now he's not saying it is at the souls
[36:42] they are sold it's not the souls of the
[36:45] born-again believers that have died and
[36:47] went on so you got to take them out from
[36:49] the church ages that's what I said we
[36:51] gotta have a different table take them
[36:53] out of the church that's not that group
[36:54] of people the fifth seal Jew has its own
[36:58] place amen
[37:02] right the fifth seal Jew and they are
[37:06] Jews there's no Gentiles in there
[37:07] because look if you turn card down in
[37:11] the end of Gentile dispensation you're
[37:14] gonna be judged by what you do good or
[37:18] bad ugly or good you're gonna be judged
[37:21] if you're not born again if you're born
[37:23] again you are the one that's doing the
[37:25] judging okay but now this fifth seal Jew
[37:28] died because they were Jews they died
[37:31] one thing only they were killed because
[37:34] they were Jew period Hitler said I don't
[37:40] want to see another one kill them all
[37:42] six million that's half of the
[37:45] population of the state of Georgia right
[37:48] now half a population state of Georgia
[37:50] he destroyed wipe them off the face of
[37:51] the earth Eichmann and Hitler and all
[37:53] the ones that different ones coming down
[37:55] through there
[37:55] and even that ain't even counting that
[37:58] was just six million Jews that were
[37:59] killed right here actually about right
[38:03] here right at the beginning of the
[38:05] church age because it was in the 40s 30s
[38:07] and 40s they were killed right that's
[38:09] not even counting all these other Jews
[38:10] that we're back to here they got killed
[38:12] just because they were Jews because
[38:14] listen this is not a new thing of being
[38:16] persecuted the Jews Jews have been
[38:18] persecuted since they since they let
[38:20] look 80 70 when Titus came in they eat
[38:25] their kill their eat they eat that you
[38:28] eat the bark off the tree they eat their
[38:31] children because they didn't do what God
[38:33] said to do God said when you see them
[38:35] come pass about get out of there
[38:37] brother Ram said there wasn't any
[38:38] born-again believer see they got a
[38:39] revelation of what God had already said
[38:41] they got out of there
[38:42] but the ones that stayed in there died
[38:45] because simply they were a hard-headed
[38:47] you and I'm gonna I don't believe
[38:49] they'll you know they were hard-headed
[38:51] they didn't listen to one gon said and
[38:53] you know what God had to destroy him
[38:56] because they didn't do what he said so
[38:58] he let Titus a Gentile general come in
[39:00] and kill him on til what they said the
[39:03] blood run out the streets they killed
[39:05] him so many of them inside that city but
[39:08] remember we're gonna we're gonna read
[39:10] one scripture here at the very end that
[39:11] when we're gonna start next week we're
[39:13] gonna talk a little bit about Daniel
[39:14] seven two weeks because they stood up at
[39:18] Calvary and said let his blood be on us
[39:21] and our children brother Brown said
[39:26] that's where they made their most fatal
[39:28] mistake as they said let it be on us and
[39:32] our children well what's the children
[39:34] they said it right here and it continued
[39:37] on all the way to right here two
[39:41] thousand years of killing because a
[39:43] group of people said let his blood be on
[39:45] us and our children amen
[39:47] but
[39:49] God through Daniel seven to eight said
[39:54] I'm gonna do away with all that finish
[39:57] the transgression make an end of sin
[39:59] make reconciliation for iniquity amen
[40:02] that's what's happening now that's why I
[40:04] said the six the six fold purpose of
[40:07] Daniel shows the redemption of the Jews
[40:09] the six fold purpose of the six seals to
[40:12] us Gentiles shows our redemption because
[40:17] you don't get Redemption in the seventh
[40:18] seal you're already redeemed amen
[40:21] and when Christ comes down to get the
[40:24] 144,000 and they go they gotta take a
[40:26] body change somewhere because they're
[40:27] going in another dimension amen all
[40:30] right they're not souls of the bride
[40:32] Church we thought that was the bride
[40:35] Church waiting their souls in the ultra
[40:37] seat crying how long how long no that's
[40:39] not it
[40:40] brother Brown says right here is not the
[40:42] souls of the bride Church so this fifth
[40:44] seal Jew is not bride totally different
[40:49] group of people
[40:51] all right now that was number four let's
[40:55] don't read the rest of it let's go on
[40:56] down to number five where brother Brown
[40:58] says hey I thought me and brother
[41:00] Neville could we just be we just be you
[41:03] know in other words spooks floating
[41:05] around with no with no substance you
[41:08] could talk to each other but you
[41:09] couldn't touch each other but that's not
[41:10] true we know that remember that was
[41:13] grandma's you know really grandma's up
[41:17] there now walking the streets of gold
[41:19] with Jesus no she's not but you know
[41:22] what how long have we been taught that I
[41:26] looked at the guy the other day and then
[41:29] we're talking - we were at - eating at
[41:33] our postal Christmas dinner or not oh I
[41:36] told the postmaster he was talking about
[41:39] kids telling lies I don't know if the
[41:47] Lord let this happen
[41:49] but in comes Santa Claus right Jim this
[41:56] guy walks his go prayer short so he went
[41:58] been in the North Pole but he had the
[42:00] beard and the hair and the red belly the
[42:03] red and I looked at Don and I said you
[42:07] talk about lying I said right there's
[42:10] the greatest lie that this world has
[42:13] ever known and we told it to our kids
[42:17] and I'm not going in further with that
[42:20] just in case you know I don't want go
[42:22] any further but I'm telling you don't
[42:23] look at your kids like that bunch of
[42:24] liars you lied to them first
[42:30] hohoho right you know what the whole
[42:37] world got sucked into that the whole
[42:42] world you know there's a Chinese Santa
[42:46] Claus Thomas right who told you that
[42:56] your mama and your daddy but you know
[43:00] what my point is you see how if you keep
[43:02] telling something long enough it just
[43:04] becomes natural it just becomes a you
[43:06] know I mean who in the world would
[43:08] believe that a man could be in 65
[43:11] billion places at one time at midnight
[43:13] on Christmas Eve but yet we what we
[43:17] believed it Susan that don't happen okay
[43:24] nope
[43:26] so brother Ram goes across the curtain
[43:28] of time
[43:29] but let's look at number seven and they
[43:33] will we're gonna read some scripture for
[43:34] about thirty minutes and then we'll be
[43:35] done
[43:37] number number seven please
[43:40] and when we die our souls go under what
[43:43] the altar of God so when you in the
[43:46] sixth dimension it is the souls under
[43:48] the altar but it's not the fifth sealed
[43:51] you alter that okay with that the ones
[43:55] that died are under this altar this

[44:28] crying how long how long but this group
[44:31] over here though is is crying how long
[44:32] how long to avenge our blood so it's not
[44:36] the same group it's a totally different
[44:39] group that's why I'm telling you you and
[44:42] I have to be a totally different group
[44:44] in this end town don't try to separate
[44:49] yourself let God do this separate don't
[44:54] walk around think well I got this son of
[44:55] man revelation nothing can bother me

[46:21] we'll we'll read some scripture so
[46:25] remember we've got to we got to touch
[46:26] the seal here because that's what we've
[46:28] been talking about the whole whole
[46:30] service up to now and when he had opened
[46:31] the fifth seal I saw under the altar the
[46:34] souls of them that were slain for the
[46:36] word of God and for the testimony which
[46:39] they held now that's not this group
[46:40] right here this group is here for the
[46:44] testimony of Jesus Christ hey buddy look
[46:47] at me right here this is for the
[46:49] testimony of Jesus Christ not to
[46:52] testimony the hell what is the testimony
[46:54] they held I'm a Jew God I am God's
[46:58] chosen remember what Gershon our rabbi
[47:03] Richmond said I can't help it God made
[47:04] me and you he made me this way and he
[47:06] gave me these promises and that's what
[47:07] I'm gonna live under and you know what
[47:11] that's gonna get him somewhere if you
[47:13] and I would live under the promise that
[47:14] he gave us just say it and they cried
[47:20] with a loud voice so they could speak
[47:22] and they had intelligence they know
[47:25] they're in another dimension brother
[47:27] John because they said how long does
[47:30] thou not judge and avenge our blood on
[47:31] them that dwell on the earth
[47:33] they weren't dwelling on the earth they
[47:35] had at one time but they had passed on
[47:38] they were in another dimension they're
[47:40] over here
[47:41] and something they can see
[47:46] how long O Lord holy and true dost thou
[47:50] not judge and avenge our blood now
[47:53] that's not these people then that's this
[47:54] people and avenge our blood on them that
[47:57] dwell on the earth what the Eichmann's
[47:59] the Hitler's all the ones that killed
[48:00] the Jews they're all right and white
[48:03] robes were given under every one of them
[48:05] listen you're sitting here tonight born
[48:07] again you have your white robe on right
[48:09] now the only way you're going to get a
[48:14] white robe it's not in that dimension
[48:18] for sure but you got to come back here
[48:21] and the body you send in and somehow God
[48:23] is going to have Grace on you and give
[48:25] you eternal life I don't think I want to
[48:29] take that chance I mean listen we know
[48:34] there's a lot of people going to be
[48:35] given eternal life that for people to
[48:37] being good for being good to the bride
[48:39] we know that but don't think for one
[48:41] thing you sit in this building and say I
[48:43] think I'll just be good to Jeannie and
[48:45] Larry and I go - give me eternal life no
[48:47] you know what God knows your heart he
[48:50] knows your intention
[48:54] he knew your intention before you got
[48:57] here so don't fool with God you're not
[49:02] gonna be you're not gonna plead
[49:05] ignorance at the judgment you're not the
[49:10] world may somebody in the world MA but
[49:12] you're not so the only the only people
[49:16] that are going to be given white robes
[49:18] are the people that are given eternal
[49:20] life at the white throne which could be
[49:22] the hundred and forty I'm at night I'm
[49:23] sorry forgive me to fit the Jays sorry
[49:29] the foolish Spurgeon I keep forgetting
[49:32] Thank You genie you want to preach the
[49:33] rest of this for me the foolish virgins
[49:35] they'll be given eternal I would say
[49:37] that's white robes were given to them
[49:38] but they'll be given to them as a
[49:39] judgment bar these are not gonna go to
[49:42] judgment
[49:43] oh my so why doesn't this type of us bow
[49:47] down they don't go to judgment they're
[49:51] giving it they're givin white robes and
[49:53] they don't go to judgment do they don't
[49:57] look at me with your eyes wide open they
[49:58] don't go to judgment if they go to
[50:01] judgment God's got a judge them for
[50:03] being a human on the earth and drinking
[50:07] smoking cursing you know the laundry
[50:08] list it up because they turned him down
[50:14] same way with me and you you and I but
[50:18] our eternal life comes here there's has
[50:21] to go and be given in that dimension
[50:23] whatever dimension they're in and white
[50:25] robes were given unto every one of them
[50:27] and it was said unto them in other words
[50:29] God is speaking to them and telling them
[50:31] that they should rest for a little
[50:34] season in other words come down come
[50:38] down Jim the hot-headed you calm down
[50:43] it's what brother Brown : calm down for
[50:46] a little season what this season right
[50:48] here 2,000 years settle down until their
[50:52] fellow-servants which is the ones that
[50:55] are get them killed own into our day and
[50:58] their brethren
[51:01] because remember when John sees this pay
[51:03] attention when John sees this in time
[51:06] it's right here on the Isle of Patmos
[51:08] 1819 whatever they haven't even been
[51:10] killed yet a lot of them but probably
[51:13] 99% them hadn't been killed yet so this
[51:16] is what this is in another dimension
[51:18] this is looking what to the Future a
[51:21] vision because look they most of them
[51:26] the biggest part of them were killed
[51:27] right in here so they weren't John is
[51:30] not talking to them people it says and
[51:34] it was said unto them John couldn't tell
[51:39] them John's not God so I believe God
[51:43] told them just hang on a minute stay
[51:46] right where you're at until your
[51:47] feathers fellow-servants and also your
[51:49] brethren that should be killed as they
[51:51] were should be fulfilled in other words
[51:53] when 144,000 gets killed then we'll see
[51:56] something take a look take take hold ok
[51:59] so that was the souls under the altar
[52:01] they were there for the word of God what
[52:03] the Word of God says they're Jews I'm a
[52:06] Jew I'm God's chosen people
[52:08] alright cuz I'm gonna read it here tune
[52:10] just a minute the testimony they held
[52:13] they were Jews
[52:14] how long did judge and avenge our blood
[52:16] so it couldn't be the bride cuz you and
[52:18] I are crying Grace and they're not but
[52:21] they're getting the greatest dose of
[52:23] grace you'll ever see in your life white
[52:25] robes were given unto them wait for a
[52:27] little season so their fellow servants
[52:28] and brethren she'll be killed now now
[52:30] let's look at the at the transgression
[52:33] we got to go all the way back to the
[52:35] Book of Jeremiah we got just a little
[52:37] while we're just gonna we're gonna read
[52:38] alright so this is where they begin this
[52:42] is where God says I'm married to you you
[52:45] are my wife Israel all of jewelry you're
[52:49] my wife and I love you watch this right
[52:51] here
[52:51] well we're not this one but the next one
[52:54] what's the Lord said unto me the days of
[52:56] Josiah Josiah and the days of Josiah of
[52:58] the king how stout seeing that which
[53:01] backsliding Israel hath done now this is
[53:04] the Prophet Jeremiah looking
[53:07] and prophesied to Israel the Lord said
[53:11] unto me in the days of Josiah has now
[53:13] seen which that backs line is will have
[53:14] done
[53:15] she has gone up upon every high mountain
[53:17] and under every Green Tree and there
[53:18] hath played the harlot and I said after
[53:22] she had done all these things turned
[53:25] down unto me but she returned not and
[53:28] her treacherous sister Judah saw it now
[53:31] I'm not going to spend too much time on
[53:34] that but remember Judah and Israel split
[53:36] for a time and they had two kings they
[53:37] had a king of Israel then they had a
[53:39] king of Judah but now they got to bring
[53:41] it back together because it's not split
[53:42] they split it because of what because
[53:46] they because they didn't like each other
[53:47] one done right that was humanly they
[53:50] were split but watch she's returned her
[53:54] treacherous sister Judah saw it and I
[53:56] saw when for all the causes whereby
[53:59] backsliding Israel committed adultery I
[54:02] had put her away and giving her a bill
[54:05] of divorcement yet her treacherous
[54:08] sister Judah fear denied in other words
[54:10] she didn't fear she went played the
[54:12] harlot also so they're all in one big
[54:14] pot okay but now remember him according
[54:20] to the New Testament and even according
[54:22] to the Old Testament if you caught your
[54:26] wife committed adultery obviously in the
[54:27] Old Testament they killed him them in
[54:30] the lover but you couldn't take that
[54:32] woman back she's she's polluted and I'm
[54:35] will read in just a minute she's
[54:36] polluted herself so you can't take her
[54:38] back but now look at the grace of
[54:40] marriage and divorce because God's not
[54:42] gonna take her back as a wife though but
[54:44] he's gonna take her but he is gonna take
[54:45] her back as a servant alright so she got
[54:48] a lower position but he didn't kick her
[54:50] in hail either alright watch and it came
[54:53] to pass through the lightness of her
[54:55] whoredom I'm going to say some worse
[54:57] than that I'm sorry that but it's in the
[54:59] Bible that she defiled the land now she
[55:02] defiled the land that land is sacred to
[55:06] God the very dirt like I said before all
[55:11] in the world wouldn't know where that
[55:13] new City was going to push up brother
[55:16] Branham said it was right under where
[55:18] Moe Cassidy and and
[55:19] Abraham took communion they were
[55:21] standing on the peak of the new city
[55:26] Abraham was looking for a city all he
[55:28] had to do was dig down maybe a couple of
[55:30] hundred feet need to find the top of it
[55:31] but it wasn't time hey men committed
[55:38] adultery and I had put her away and
[55:39] giving her a bill of divorcement you
[55:40] know treacherous sister Judah fear not
[55:42] and went and played the harlot came to
[55:43] pass through the lightness of her hoard
[55:45] them that she defiled the land and
[55:46] committed adultery with stones and was
[55:48] stopped and yet for all this her
[55:50] treacherous sister Judah has not turned
[55:52] unto me with her whole heart but faintly
[55:55] sayeth the Lord and the Lord sent unto
[55:58] me the backsliding Israel has justified
[56:01] herself boy don't do something like us
[56:05] come on doesn't it sound like us the
[56:09] backsliding Israel has justified herself
[56:12] more than treacherous Judah go and
[56:14] proclaim these words toward the north's
[56:16] in other words he is God is sending
[56:17] Jeremiah to tell Israel this and say
[56:22] return thou backsliding Israel saith the
[56:25] Lord and I will not cause look I will
[56:28] not cause my anger to fall on you you
[56:31] have an option Cain you have an option
[56:36] spoke a word Church we still have an
[56:38] option it's called free moral agency
[56:40] amen
[56:41] I will not cause my anger to fall upon
[56:44] you for I am merciful saith the Lord and
[56:48] I will not keep anger forever only
[56:53] acknowledged on iniquity that thou has
[56:56] transgressed against the Lord thy gone
[56:58] and have scattered thy ways to the
[56:59] strangers on their evergreen tree and
[57:02] you have not obeyed my voice saith the
[57:05] LORD turn o backsliding children says
[57:07] the Lord for I am married unto you and I
[57:11] will take you one of a city and two of a
[57:13] family and I will bring you to Zion in
[57:15] other words I'll bring you right back
[57:16] I'm gonna restore you right but watch
[57:22] let's go to Ezekiel now this is gonna be
[57:25] some hard reading but we're gonna read
[57:26] probably 30 verses that all right okay
[57:29] cuz we're gonna because this is this is
[57:31] what happened during the
[57:32] time of Israel's backsliding condition
[57:35] now when I pass by Li and looked upon
[57:38] thee behold thy time was the time of
[57:40] love he's in love with him and I spread
[57:43] my skirt over then covered thy nakedness
[57:46] yeah I swear unto thee and entered into
[57:49] a covenant with thee saith the Lord God
[57:50] and thou became us mine ain't that
[57:55] beautiful then I washed him with water
[57:58] yea I thoroughly washed away thy blood
[58:01] from thee sanctified him and I nor did
[58:06] they were the oil I clothed thee also
[58:09] with broader dworkin shod thee with
[58:11] badger skin and I girded the about with
[58:14] fine linen and I covered thee with self
[58:16] he loved this person whoever this is I
[58:19] meant I decked thee also with ornaments
[58:23] and I put bracelets upon thy hand and a
[58:25] chain on the neck and I put a jewel on
[58:27] my forehead and earrings in my earring
[58:29] beautiful crown upon that head thus was
[58:33] thou decked with gold and silver and the
[58:36] arraignment was a fine linen and silk
[58:38] and brought at work
[58:39] thou did a state fine flower he didn't
[58:41] forget about their eating either thou
[58:44] needest
[58:45] eat fine flour and honey and oil and
[58:48] that was the exceeding beautiful and
[58:51] though did it prosper into a kingdom
[58:56] wow it's looking good for these people
[58:58] for right now and thy renown went forth
[59:04] among the heathen for thy beauty
[59:06] remember when Solomon took over there
[59:11] was so many years of hundred years or so
[59:13] or longer that there was no war had one
[59:17] of the greatest kingdoms had all the
[59:18] gold had all the silver had all brother
[59:21] brown said that was their millennium in
[59:22] the Old Testament remember he said down
[59:24] all right for it was perfect through my
[59:30] comeliness God made them that way which
[59:32] I had put upon thee saith the Lord but
[59:35] that Lord but but thou didst trust in
[59:39] thine own beauty and place the harlot
[59:43] because of thy renown and poorest out
[59:45] there fornications on every one that
[59:47] passed by as it was and of thy garments
[59:51] thou did is taking decades to high
[59:54] places with divers colours and play this
[59:56] the place the harlot there upon the
[1:00:00] light things shall not come neither
[1:00:02] shall it be so thou has also taken thy
[1:00:04] fair jewels of my gold it's what God
[1:00:06] give them you've took what I give you
[1:00:09] and you've defiled the whole I mean you
[1:00:14] well we're going to read it now has
[1:00:17] taken that find early golden my gold and
[1:00:19] my silver which I had given thee and
[1:00:22] made us to the images of men and did us
[1:00:25] commit whoredom with them now for those
[1:00:29] of you that are young they weren't all
[1:00:33] committing physical adultery they were
[1:00:35] they were sacrificing sacrificing to
[1:00:38] other gods setting up images taking the
[1:00:41] gold that God had given and making
[1:00:44] golden images and they were worshiping
[1:00:45] that image as it were God right so
[1:00:49] that's what the whoredom was they
[1:00:50] weren't they weren't true to their
[1:00:52] husband they went over and played what
[1:00:56] with the devil all right so just just to
[1:00:59] explain that they didn't all were just a
[1:01:00] bunch of prostitutes but in the
[1:01:05] spiritual realm they were prostituting
[1:01:07] their self before God and got in trouble
[1:01:10] for it and took his type broader
[1:01:12] garments and covers them and they'll
[1:01:14] have set my oil and mine incense before
[1:01:17] he they used the very old God give them
[1:01:19] in their in their sacrifices and they
[1:01:23] were not to God they were to what other
[1:01:25] gods you know he said behold o Israel
[1:01:29] thy God is one they forgot that because
[1:01:33] they made him many what have we done
[1:01:35] behold o Gentiles your God is one now we
[1:01:39] got three well I mean we don't but the
[1:01:43] world you know the world bounds to that
[1:01:45] to the whole world bowels of Trinity
[1:01:50] my meat also which I give the fine flour
[1:01:53] and oil and honey wherewith I fed day
[1:01:55] now has to even set it before them for a
[1:01:57] sweet savor what they're giving them to
[1:01:59] other countries God said don't do that
[1:02:03] separate yourself that's why we should
[1:02:07] be separated from the world God give us
[1:02:09] all these great things that we have
[1:02:11] maybe not gold and silver you understand
[1:02:14] what I mean but I'd rather have the gold
[1:02:16] of God than to have the gold of man
[1:02:17] because you know what the gold of man
[1:02:18] we're gonna walk that's pavement when we
[1:02:21] get the glory we're gonna walk on what
[1:02:23] man's killed us killed for all these
[1:02:24] times on the earth we're gonna walk on
[1:02:27] it my meat also which I gave you fine
[1:02:31] flour oil and honey where when I fed
[1:02:33] thee thou has to even set it before them
[1:02:35] for a sweet savour and thus it was it's
[1:02:37] the Lord God moreover thou has taken thy
[1:02:40] sons and my daughters now look this is
[1:02:43] how defiled they were because it doesn't
[1:02:47] say this here but there was some God
[1:02:50] named Moloch and they worship Moloch so
[1:02:55] much that when you read in the scripture
[1:02:57] where it refers to they put their sons
[1:02:59] and their daughters through the fire
[1:03:00] they sacrificed their children literally
[1:03:03] took their children and sacrificed them
[1:03:05] every month or every year to this God
[1:03:08] called Moloch that's what he's talking
[1:03:10] about right here more over than I was
[1:03:12] taking my sons and my daughters and thou
[1:03:13] hast borne unto me that was God's kids
[1:03:16] that got God's people and these have
[1:03:21] staff sacrificed unto them to be
[1:03:23] devoured it is of thy whoredoms a small
[1:03:27] matter that they'll have slain my
[1:03:28] children and delivered them to cause him
[1:03:31] to pass through the fire for them that's
[1:03:33] the Moloch who whatever he was he was a
[1:03:35] strong demon because everybody worshiped
[1:03:38] him even Israel started worshiping but
[1:03:41] why do each upstart why did Israel start
[1:03:43] worshipping because they turned from God
[1:03:45] okay and in all thine abominations and
[1:03:48] thy whoredoms thou has not remembered
[1:03:51] the days of thy youth when thou was
[1:03:54] naked and bare and what's polluted in
[1:03:55] thy blood remember I read that in
[1:03:57] Scripture in the very top he's reminding
[1:03:59] them of what he done what he took them
[1:04:01] from the world
[1:04:02] and made them a nation give them a spot
[1:04:05] of land to live on give them honey give
[1:04:07] them all give them wine and sit here if
[1:04:09] you'll do this right here I'm gonna make
[1:04:11] a covenant with you if you'll do this
[1:04:12] I'll do this that's why he had to make
[1:04:15] an unconditional covenant with Abraham
[1:04:18] called Abraham broke it he broke his own
[1:04:22] covenant he gave his wife away twice
[1:04:26] okay and it came to pass after all that
[1:04:30] wickedness woe woe unto thee saith the
[1:04:32] Lord that thou has also built under the
[1:04:34] in imminent place and has made the a
[1:04:36] high place in every street in other
[1:04:38] words they took all the temples that
[1:04:40] were God's temples and made him what
[1:04:41] made them into the temples of Moloch and
[1:04:43] this one and that one in the other one
[1:04:45] right Baptist Methodist Pentecostal
[1:04:47] whatever thou has built the high place
[1:04:50] at every head of the way and have made
[1:04:52] thy beauty to be abhorred and has opened
[1:04:55] thy feet to everyone that passed by in
[1:04:57] other words they were mingling with the
[1:04:59] other tribes or other Gentiles opening
[1:05:06] thy feet you know what that means
[1:05:07] opening thy feet to everyone that passed
[1:05:08] by and multiplies out horde them they're
[1:05:11] not gettin better than getting worse now
[1:05:13] that's also committed fornication with
[1:05:15] the Egyptians thy neighbors great of
[1:05:17] flesh and have to increase the hoard of
[1:05:19] to provoke me to anger Wow I'm like
[1:05:24] brother Branham if I was God I'd have
[1:05:26] stopped right there I'd wipe them off
[1:05:27] the face of the earth now to start it
[1:05:28] again right

[1:05:32] that's what I mean you and I can't
[1:05:33] brother John we can't we're not grace we
[1:05:36] got to be but we want to give that much

[1:05:40] that I gave everything to and they just
[1:05:42] took everything I have and they made it
[1:05:44] into idols and they don't even worship
[1:05:47] God any more than over here worship and
[1:05:48] all this other stuff

[1:14:29] jeremiah 31 32 behold the day's come
[1:14:32] saith the lord then i will make a new
[1:14:36] covenant with the house of israel and
[1:14:38] with the house of judah now there's your
[1:14:39] two separate but he's putting them
[1:14:40] together not according to the covenant
[1:14:43] that i made with your fathers why
[1:14:44] because they broke that one look not
[1:14:50] according to the covenant that i made
[1:14:51] with their fathers in the day that i
[1:14:53] took him by the hand to bring them out
[1:14:56] of the land of egypt which my covenant
[1:14:59] they break although i was a husband unto
[1:15:03] them saith the lord but this shall be
[1:15:05] the covenant that i will make with the
[1:15:08] house of israel after those days
[1:15:15] but let's not let's not add to the word
[1:15:17] but the days of the Gentiles after the
[1:15:21] days of the Gentiles this is what I'm
[1:15:22] going to do I will put my law in their
[1:15:25] inward parts and write it in their
[1:15:29] hearts look this v sells you is not
[1:15:31] getting a lucky'
[1:15:32] we say well we didn't get in a white
[1:15:34] robe their souls being clean come on

[1:16:03] people and they shall teach no more
[1:16:05] every man his neighbor and every man his
[1:16:08] brother saying know the Lord for they
[1:16:09] shall all know me
[1:16:13] in the end word man they shall all

[1:16:25] thou that's what they were doing they
[1:16:27] were dependent on that priest to read
[1:16:29] that sprinkled the blood and do
[1:16:31] everything for him can y'all not see
[1:16:34] that's where the Catholic gets their
[1:16:36] doctrine from they get it from the Old
[1:16:38] Testament where the priest does
[1:16:40] everything every year he goes in once
[1:16:42] you know he goes in every every Sabbath
[1:16:45] but then he goes in once a year what to
[1:16:47] clean the whole the whole of Israel
[1:16:50] remember the makes an atonement the day
[1:16:53] of atonement he takes one blood in and
[1:16:54] if for every person is in Israel that's
[1:16:57] where the Catholics get their priest
[1:16:59] thing where the Pope can come up and do
[1:17:01] whatever he wants to for they shall know
[1:17:04] me
[1:17:05] we know him amen for the least of them
[1:17:10] to the greatest of them said Lord for I
[1:17:11] will forgive their iniquity and I will
[1:17:15] remember their sin
[1:17:21] that's me and you but that's also leaves
[1:17:24] real I will remember all that that they
[1:17:27] done guess what they had a laundry list

[1:17:36] this I did this I did this Israel do
[1:17:37] this I did this I did this I will
[1:17:40] remember that no more because you know
[1:17:42] what right now God's not accusing you of

[1:17:51] see it hallelujah Jeremiah 50 let's read
[1:17:55] this one and then we'll be done and I
[1:17:58] will bring Israel again to his
[1:18:00] habitation and I shall he shall feed on
[1:18:03] caramel and Bashan and his soul shall be
[1:18:06] set now that don't sound like that group
[1:18:08] I was talking to a minute ago right
[1:18:10] right and his soul shall be satisfied
[1:18:13] upon Mount Ephraim and Gilead in those
[1:18:16] days and then that time says the Lord
[1:18:18] the iniquity of Israel shall be sought
[1:18:21] for
[1:18:24] and there shall be none and the sins of
[1:18:30] Judah and they shall not be found for I
[1:18:34] will pardon them whom I reserved amen

[1:18:45] all that they did all that laundry lists
[1:18:48] you done in all your life if you have
[1:18:50] been forgiven and that's been putting a
[1:18:53] sea of God's forgetfulness God can't
[1:18:56] even remember it he cannot bring it up
[1:18:59] that's what makes us clean is that God
