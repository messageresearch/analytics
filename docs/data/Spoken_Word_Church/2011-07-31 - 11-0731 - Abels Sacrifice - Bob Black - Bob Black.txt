========================================

morning brother there's some stories in the Bible you can just kind of identify with and Abel's story is one that just really stands out to me so I wanted to look at just part of the story and the part we want to look at is able sacrifice how he how he approached God and um so let's go ahead and and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceited and bear can and said I have gotten a man from the Lord and she again beared brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller on the ground and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel unto his offering but unto Cain unto his offering he had not respect and Cain was is very raw and his countless fa so if you look at what other people have said down commentaries of this of these scriptures there's always been two questions why was able sacrifice accepted and how was it accepted and so let's start off by reading through what brother said about it we know that first of all Abel came to God by faith he received a revelation from God um so let's let's set up the set up the story about thinking about what was going on um uh in Revelations 4 part three B said and these Cher there's four Cher standing at the East Gate of Ed and um they were placed there to drive us away to drive them away from the Tree of Life and now they're drawing us back was for the same for CH the lon man ox and Eagle brother said and these CH first mentioned was place at the East Gate of the Guard going four ways I should have made that a little different from that I can't adjust it to God's orders and things like that but I just so that you'll know what I mean there's the Garden of Eden and this is the gate right here opens up here swings out at this gate there was Cher Cher and remember it doesn't say a cherub it said cherubim cherabin was placed there to guard what the Tree of Life that's what they was to guard the way of the tree of life the way who is the way Jesus where is it reflected from here is the holy place here are the CH now watch put all this down here's the holy Hol this holiest of holies holy of holies this is the holy place and he starts going through the Tabernacle how the Tabernacle speaks of our our journey through salvation from justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then he talks about um so that shows that God's altar was moved and set here at the Garden of Eden and the only way back to Eden is by the altar here you are again see Back to Eden through the Altar and they were to keep that way there guarded that they couldn't get back there until this altar was covered by Blood so now in the revelation of Jesus Christ brother R said it was a revelation from God that made the difference gave you able eternal life and think about your own Journey how you received your Revelation I remember when I I received a revelation of uh one day my dad was I went on a walk well I let me back up I was raised in the message and for years I didn't really um I heard about all of these things for years and years then one day I took a walk but my dad he started talking about the future home and at that moment it just became it just opened up and I saw what the problem was what the solution was and what I need to do to accept Jesus so that's that's kind of the same Journey that able went through but look in the maniac of gadara in 1954 but look coming here at Abel not was working wraps a little Vine around this whole sheep's neck and here he come pulling him up there throwing him upon the alter and began to beat his throat and killed him why able had a revelation we're letting that took just a minut it was Revelation that Abel had that made him just he had a revelation of the requirement of almighty God and he brought a lamb and that's the only way that he'll ever be able to see Divine Healing the baptism of the Holy Ghost will be by Revelation and um the power of God 1955 he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of King God testifying that it he was righteous because he seen the program of God which was revealed to him now they had and the Bible wasn't written then so it came his brother who said under the same teaching my father and mother came down and brought fruit to make the offering but ail by Revelation he saw that it wasn't fruits that brought us out of the Garden of Eden and some people still think it was but it wasn't fruits it was the blood of his mother who made Mortal over his father so he came and offered the blood of the Lamb by divine revelation no one to tell him anything about it but he by faith he seen the Son of God coming off and offered the lamb and figured the type seeing that Jesus was the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world so Abel didn't just get a revelation to just bring a lamb he saw what the problem was and he saw what the solution was he saw and figured looking ahead to the Son of God coming and he saw he got a revelation of the mate that his parents have now here's here's God's plan the word was from the beginning God's plan CL I'm sorry this is the God of this evil age 1965 but God revealed by Revelation the very thing that he Vindicated and punctuated that that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being cons sincere but by the revelation of the word of God that's that's the starting point he getting Revelation from God you can continue on that then the next thing is he got a revelation that he needed to bring a lamb to the offer that God had put at the East Gate so that's what he did now what if what if he had not done that what if he said okay I know what to do but I'm just going to do what I what I you know what I want to do like Kan then God would have never accepted anything he would have never accepted it so that's the next phase is obedience to his word and show us the father and seis 1950 they didn't have any ropes in them days I guess so they had a Vine maybe wrapped around his neck because it was it was Christ that's who it was but they L him away like a lamb to the slaughter they put a rope around his neck and here he come leading this little lamb bleeding pulling back he laid him upon a rock perhaps didn't have have any sharp knives in them days probably took an old sharp Rock and held his little head back and begin to beat his little throat bble did see and the blood be to Spur out of his little arteries in his neck did you ever hear a lamb dying most pathetic thing you ever heard is to hear lamb die how it bleeds and bleeds and when you start to obey God then you become separated from the world you know can you imagine what Cain probably thought looking at watching Abel bring that lamb down and say what are you going to do with that and started hacking on it with a with a rock that that's the same same thing the world looks at us today and sees our our sisters going through the mall or wherever long dresses and long hair they always think something think we're strange obedience bring separation uh an uncertain sound 19 61 he's got to hear the sound of death bless God what God wants today is you to die die of the things of the world and yourself here scream Lord take me as I am that's what God wants he wants that sound of death that death rattle of an old man Adam is dying that he might come in and take his place and Rule you and be your lord and I will restore an 19ah 54 remember Abel died on the altar with his lamb and every man that comes to Christ must die on the same altar Jesus Christ did on the altar of self sacrifice forgetting your own ways forgetting your own reasons and taking God's word and saying it's your word Lord Lord I believe it and their dies able did on the rock with his same lamb died with that died for him ready we die out for Christ on the offers of God sacrifice and moving on after you've obeyed God then we've all read this quote in the token full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to the Token no other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the word not what somebody has put into it and added to it what God said about it and then uh Revelation 4 part three he just lays it out justification by here sanctification is what you do in regards to what you did and appreci an appreciation of that God still you by the Holy Ghost and let me so he's he's believed God he's obeyed God and he separated from the things of the world and the next thing is it's to wait because in Luke 24 Jesus told him behold I send the promis of my father upon you but tear you in the city of Jerusalem until you be undu with power from on high if you've done everything you know to do to just stand back and wait and this same formula applies to Healing to adoption to everything believe God and wait on it and I I like this story in Exodus when uh and Aaron went to pharaoh and they Aaron threw down his rod and they turned into a serpent and then Here Come The Magicians and they throw down their rods too he had believed God he obeyed it now he just waited right the serpent came and ha up the other two but if you just wait on God and God will do the rest in the message presuming brother around said they waited until the scripture was made made manifest to them they didn't presume nothing they waited till it was over they waited till they got it so now God's going to come and accept able sacrifice and this has been there's only one place brother R said how he accepted able sacrifice and I'm fixing to go through the scripture this in the message presuming 1962 How did Kain when he made an altar just as prety prettier than able he offered fruits he give his tith brought his income into the house of the Lord he knelt on the altar he B bowed him himself he prayed he worshiped just as sincere as any man but God Vindicated ail by consuming his sacrifice so let's get our Bibles out Leviticus 923 and we'll see how all the way through the Bible God always accepts the sacrifice the same way chapter 9 verse 23 this is after he had given Moses a commandment of how to set up the Tabernacle and the offerings and he had done all that the Lord commanded and Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle of the congregation and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people and there came a fire out from before the Lord and consumed upon the offer the burnt offering in the F which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces and now let's turn to judges 6:19 and this is Gideon sacrifice and Gideon went in and made ready a kid and unle cakes of an e flow the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the Oak and presented it and the angel of God God said unto him take the Flesh and the UN living CES and laid him Upon This Rock and pour out the broth and he did so then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the Flesh and the UNL cakes and There Rose up fire out of the Rock and consume the Flesh and the UNL cakes then the angel of the Lord departed out of his side now let's go to First Kings 18 verse 22 2 1 Kings 18 this is Elijah's sacrifice and I think everybody already knows what happens here let's let's go ahead and jump to verse uh 37 First Kings 18:37 hear me oh Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their part back again then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice in the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench goes on now let's go to Second Chronicles chapter 7 and this is Solomon sacrifice after the new Temple was Solomon's Temple was built he went to offer a sacrifice see how that sacrifice was accepted 7 verse1 now when Solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord fill the house I got all right well I had the scripture written now where uh in Matthew it says uh he send the Holy Ghost to fire John John the Baptist speaking and he said I'll send uh One Cometh that will baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire so on in Acts 2238 they were baptized with the Holy Ghost in fire as just goes all through the Bible and then remember papell just been preaching on the future home how the Earth has to go through the same thing cleansing by water uh blood and fire so it runs all the way through the bottom in that one so real quick before we have get just more things consuming I got many our souls are placed by this is must be born again 1961 our soul rep placed by faith on the brass offered God's judgment and our offering is consumed but if that offering has been received by God is consumed the world is dead to you you're gone but we reckon ourselves dead and buried we are dead and our we are hidden Christ hiding Christ and besides that then and after that we're dead and buried in Hidden Christ and were're sealed with the Holy Spirit the brass altar uh presuming 1962 the brass altar consumed the sacrifice that the sacrifice laid upon the alt that was not consuming God refused it see it's consuming and you are God's sacrifice laid yourself upon the offer said God just take it all out of me empty up so you can fill me up you that's right don't presume it believe it yes sir if you don't believe it you God won't receive your sacrifice 1959 watching his star may I say tonight that God has a sign today it's a sign of his spirit that where Jesus is there's life where he is life where Jesus is there's Gospel Life for he is a life where Jesus is there is fire for he is a consuming fire that burns up all your unbelief and draws 64
