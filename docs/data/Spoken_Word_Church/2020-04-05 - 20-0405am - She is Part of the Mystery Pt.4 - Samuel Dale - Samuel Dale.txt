you shining in the light of glory pour your power and love and we say Amen a holy high Oh shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy Oh Lord I want to see you amen and amen and amen you want to see him when we look right into the word doing good to see everybody in the house of the Lord we're glad to be here today had to house services and things and all of those out there that are viewing by way of internet and things we greet you and just say may the Lord bless you and be with you and we we just try to go on as much as we can with a normal form of services and things too until time comes and they get through with all of their doings with the government or whatever then it'll be alright but we don't know we had talked about maybe having this coming to Easter services we still got to check that out so you that are listening that would be able to drive up on next Sunday you know or drive to come we would start like 10 o'clock or something like that we'd have a service and have that people outside sitting in your cars and hook up a system to where that we can do and all and we won't be doing in the church we'll be doing that away so just keep keep a listening ear until we find out we'd love to how services called it to me it I know I've been able to be here every service but when you're not able to come to everyone it gets kind of wondering what types what happened to that day you miss it during all but just yes we're doing the best we can and working from that and just you at home just listen in and do that just like you would do here respect and everything and do everything you know connected around the service don't be running and going and doing dire in your home you know do it just like it be in his regular services and that way we can all have a good time too in the Lord and the presence of the Lord would be with this honor if you like turning your scriptures turn to Luke 17 and we'll begin reading about verse 20 - and through 20 well through 30 I guess we had mark 37 well we'll go all the way so do that father we thank you for this day in your grace and we thank you for your love and took each one of us we ask you now that you would just come among us in a mighty way and open our eyes to that understanding of that word that's your light and love Lord be with us we thank you for these opportunity that we have here Lord to use the internet systems and things like that to be able to steel house services and have a good time to fellowship in you so just have your way with each and every one of us that you're loving grace be with us forgive our sins in order to remember each one be a brother dict our Lord they're saying that he has just a short time to live so we know who the true liver is and the one that would take care of all the time so you just manifest yourself that's your loving grace be with him and then remember all the others father we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you mean like to go to verse 22 we'll read this because the reason is reading so much of it is because you'll see that it covers the entire Bible that was the purpose of choosing this because as we will get to it in a minute when we get to the facts we're saying like son of man son of God son of David we just remember each one of those had a position in their time and see he was son of man as in the Old Testament as Jehovah God you know that would still be counted as son of man the Prophet all right then you go to son of God in their ages and then son of David in the Millennium so keep those in mind that's reason were reading the whole thing here alright and he said unto the disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see the days of the Son of Man and ye shall not see it he is coming down he was fixing to be crucified they shall say unto you see hear or see there go not after them nor follow them see coming on down to where we're at now president lightning that light us out of the one part under heaven shina 'then to the other part under heaven so shall also the Son of Man be in his day is he all right now that's going to be back there but it's going to be in over here ok but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation had to be crucified and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all see coming down to our day now ok likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed or is he coming even to the great destruction and finishing all things of in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house that have not come down to take it away in he that is in the field that him likewise not returned back remember Lot's wife who so ever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed once you'll be taken you know to see a secret rapture come on sorry two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken the other left two men shall be in the field one shall be taken and the other left they answered and said unto him were Lord in other words not they were saying when but the word is were because it covers so much all right you know you understand why I'm reading this to show you this comes through the Old Testament through the church ages out into where we're at and finishes it all up so it doesn't say when to bring it it says were we're Lord and you sent them to them or whatever the body is there will the eagle's be gathered together you may be seated to the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word hmm you know I want to try to keep on the thought with us and trying to hold it into a yeah a part that we can understand and then we'll pick up some more things we have a couple of more messages or no to go with this coming on out and we've been talking about how the bride is part of the mystery all right go to cry so mister God revealed read that message over and over Christ is part of the mystery all right how many times as I said to you how many times his brother Brendan said all God was he ported the cross all Christ he poured into the church and to take her back see all right because it's a great mystery to wind up in the end to see the you and I are part of that mystery the indwelling are in grafton of the Gentiles I said the other day that's the great mystery that was bringing into the Gentiles it would just barely spoken all throughout the Old Testament all right and brought into view but just remember now what we're talking about here the final final lysing are bringing the this mystery to the great mystery of revelations 10 and through there then we're talking about the bride being part of the mystery alright see the Gentiles will spoke of down through the ages and we we're a lot of times just take you know the Gentiles being well that's the mystery well that's great that's that's alright we do but just remember there's plenty of Jews is into this too so remember coming down as I said we'll get to it in a minute and try to emphasize that part or you know express it to talk about how that he was son of man the Prophet Old Testament you call it Jehovah God you know or whatever you'd want to but it's really dealing with the son of man cuz he talked about those prophets then we can see there that the mystery was more than as trying to express more than just the Gentiles being brought in it was to see the complete mystery of what the whole entire Bible is about and bringing in the mystery of Christ being revealed in his church all right now and that's what we're trying to hold the point to okay all right now let me say it to you like this see we say well well you know you've emphasized the mystery you Vince massaged the point of God coming and living in his church and and all in your you'll be going in to the fullness of the Godhead bodily and talking about the Son of Man and and the things like that but let me say it to you like this why would you not agree with the word now listen why would we all of us not agree with the word if we're part of the word I see being part of the word why would we not agree with it well you know I just don't know about this about the bride being the fullness and the son of man and the things like that you know you know I just that's just making a little bit too much out of the bride were how would it be the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ in His Church and the bride we look back and we see Ruth as a Gentile that's great but just remember you got the whole story of Naomi to be put with Ruth to come forth to see that it's more than just see he was redeeming he wasn't let me say it correctly mote Boaz didn't go out and redeem Ruth he couldn't do it that away he had to redeem Naomi all right and in doing that then he could claim what was of that that Ruth would be involved so then there's the mystery see you got more room in Surrey you got more you said well the in grafton of the Jew of the Gentiles you got Ruth no right but you got Naomi the boys had to actually take Naomi not has his wife we'd say but took his her possessions her properties her things that belong to her that was granted to her you know about her husband being a Jew and and the things like that all right now you keep that thought in mind and you'll see why I'm saying why would we not agree with the word and what it's speaking of if we are that word and I thought that was what we were supposed to be all right now what's this now and if you do not agree with the word then it would be sure to show you that you're not part of the word right you're not part of it if you don't believe it well I just never have heard it before well now you hearing it now so you know now open up your ears of understanding and start trying to believe it because we're in the last days we were to the point to where this thing's and closed out any day you sold no it can't well it's already closed pretty good all it is takes is just a pen and that's it you're you hear this that or the other just put it in you know I'm not a doomsday try to scare you - nothing like that there's one thing about it we should realize we should all agree that someday I think even the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian someday it's going to come to an end well they don't know the mystery see the mystery of this already come to an end because it's being made manifest in the bride what the prophets say about how did he's that first he does it then he reveals it makes it known does it reveals it and makes it known so if he's making it known it's already here first we're concerned it's already over that's my whole point of like a brother asked me you know what was myself I think positive I think right here now this is it if not when when is that gonna get here and I'll do like brother Brown said let me keep this until that gets here let me rejoice in this let me be uplifted in you know all of this to see whether we're here or not and what the Prophet is saying I go ahead and pull up number one brothers and we'll just get a little bit of something I want you to think on because we remember the question now why would we not agree with the word if we are the word and if we are the word then set we say we don't agree with that well I just can't believe that why it's the entire Bible why why would it not me now look what the prophet has to say about it go ahead and roll it up to her the same ministry that Jesus had Jesus had is in his church tonight same sign same wonder same spirit well I just don't see that we'll see now you don't believe it I thought you supposed to believe it I wouldn't believe the see not seem to believe on look same sign same wonder saying spirit same kind of works that Jesus did here on the earth earth the church has to do the same thing if it's not if you don't agree that it's going on now read what your prophet said or tear that out all right because he said if it's not it's not the seed of Abraham it's not the Church of Jesus Christ can't be let's see no we don't like for that to be said that strong why we're at the end of all things that be number one but yet when are we gonna start believing the Bible is speaking of us I was giving the illustration our the other day how did the Prophet say we're supposed to speak about healing by His stripes Rhine is healed put your name dart well why can't you put your name in Genesis one that we just want to pick out a little bit of things from the Bible to make our own thoughts why can't we believe all of it see because believing all of it then we'll come out to see it as a finished product all right look at number two go ahead man now God is trying to find a church that he can project his word true you see God watches over his word to to vindicate it and how can he vindicate it when we deny that it's the truth if you don't believe the minister of Jesus Christ is here in the same way except for the corporal body or whatever you want take it of that if you don't believe that then how can you believe in to be Hebrews 13:8 well I don't see it well that's what I'm saying you're looking for something to try to prove it instead of believing it and letting God take care of the proof it is not up to you and I to vindicate God's Word the God had already Finnegan it's up to us to believe it is vindicated and to believe that it's talking about us talking about who we are what we're doing here the whole Bible is that way the whole Old Testament whole New Testament everything is speaking of the bride of Jesus Christ and she's part of the mystery and remember if she's part of the mystery she's got to be revealed do we believe it that strong that dogmatic or what you'd want to use the terminologies of being so stern to say this is it or are we waiting on somebody else to come along we're waiting on this to happen we're working on that to happen and then we'll believe it what if God's waiting on us to believe it where he can make it manifest if not see did we wind up denying the word if you say in a way he's the same run-run said that's enough such a sign you can't say in a way it's not in a way he's either the same or he's not well I could believe it back in when brother Branham was here thank God I could too if I'd have been there no I'd love to seen those days but I have the Bible that puts it in a more positive attitude because it's what does it say blessed are they that believe that have not seen okay they were not trying to make somebody believe something or convinced you the new birth is the only thing that can convince you of anything being right or wrong anyway we'll see it's time to stand up to the point because what if the next what if the next move is something that they say we can't come to church at all what are we gonna do I mean what if they come in and say you can't house services like you're having them what are you gonna do we better get prepared now I think this has been the 50 years a sense of going of the profit and and the things for you and I too got prepared to study this thing out to the to see and understand where we're at and what's going on and see our day in this it's messy see that way then you know I do I emphasize over and over because that's what I want it to be I want it to be to her that you and I know who we are my brother dick and I used to talk about it it's pretty good to talk about what you believe until they stick the gun to the head and said what do you believe you know can change a lot of thinking but if we're not ready now we won't be ready then do you realize that it's a very dangerous situation for someone to hang around this message without coming in and accepting it and being true it can mean their death that just hang around it at least let me believe it let me let me say it's true and believe that to be true and stand on it all right see that's that's my whole point of trying to get us to to talk about this look at number three it's taking these few and then get into a little thought in a minute go ahead and roll it on up till we get there you go said oh brother now listen to this I remember years ago quote in there some people said where'd you get that I said the Prophet said it well I mean you know a lot of times I said the Prophet said it and and I couldn't produce it Carter didn't have enough memory to be able do it and it took a while to produce it and I remember one brother one time he said something I see that ain't right he said well work the Prophet said I said I don't know but I'll find it well I did one day and I laid it down I said now read it you know not being arrogant or hateful or whatever being trying to get me not to think about what's going on hey look what he said oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year we're all theologies I guess what Vanessa failed to do in 2,000 years now listen you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes strikes home to that fateful little remnant now watch him he's putting more of a time element situation may be laying within this anointing that we should consider after the doors of the Gentiles is closed well brother Dale I thought we supposed to get out here for the door the Gentiles closed a lot of words you get that out I mean bring that to me I'd like to read it I can read this so you're not looking at it the way that the Prophet is bringing after the doors agenda on this quote Oh God would have known a church then he whose filthy let him be filthy still he who's righteous let him be righteous feel and then he who is holy let him be holy still and God will anoint the church with the power of God and things will be taken place not only that then but he's doing it now all right he's doing it now you remember how we lay down the anointing and things like that summer Jesus was anointed on the River Jordan sure he became the fullness of the Godhead bodily yes not that he wasn't God already not that he wasn't already the fullness and all but it's just a statement when that anointing came on him I've tried to emphasize to you see they couldn't kill him why light of morning was on him but now we're not anointing left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he was subject to death and died that's how much they're known here but what about you and me what about that same anointing come into you in me what do you think it was done the anointing came on him in the garden I mean came on him at the river and it left him in the garden or to be able to come back on me and you sure it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that has made us down through all of this time but now look at the Prophet how he's emphasizing it that something's gonna happen that God will unknown a church one time he was saying I hate it easy to be very short well short period of time a long time that's fine all right when the main thing is is we better be ready for the time you know and see it's not ready for the time like we we tried to do everything else try to get everything in order try to do this try to do that it's not that away that much I've emphasized to you a lot of things over the 50 years that I've been pastoring I think you ought to be sensible I think you order to work upon not being so head over heels in debt especially when you don't need it for 3 or 4 new cars you know you understand my emphasis you know there's not no problem about being in debt as long as you make your payments that's no problem all right but see get prepared I've always told the church to not to not to be a a church you know that's out there the one that stores up the year supply food ain't talking about that I'm done not just being sensible new order see how sensible that I've been who would have ever thought toilet paper would become to be a dollar a roll or more and you think that I'm just being ho he just don't trust God he don't trust God God's gonna take care of us well he might give you enough sense to buy a couple extra can of Green Bay I mean beans and put them up in the cabinet because when the power goes off no wonder like I've always told you we're done on the end of the road when the power goes off we're the last one to get it back I got a generator system I got all kind of thing but why just for surviving now you know and it's good to have you go down to baselet and get a can of beans and you know put it on and cook it now some deed that's that's where no depression we're not talking about depression er we're talking about normal everyday living it's good to how things provide it a little bit right then when you need it you got it you ain't gotta worry about it that's that's not being well you don't trust the Lord yeah I'm like all of these others and I've tried my best to be honest with people when when the brothers this message you know what I'm talking about a lot of them said I ain't gonna pay no income tax children of the King don't pay no taxes you know I ain't even played on taxes well it didn't pay any they're poor old wives wind up cleaning homes and I remember once I got in mind she's she was well over 80 years old still having to work why because her husband didn't pay no taxes you know what I told her husband and told all them of rent because they was around here and hanging about it you say well the children of the King don't pay no taxes how about the king paying taxes oh that's sarcastic and now it's true Jesus told Peter go down there and take this hook and flick it over in there and said come back and pay your taxes and mine too you said well that was a different okay you can argue different in country outcomes or whatever I ain't arguing with you about it I just made their statements back then I said you're you're failing on what you're doing but it didn't change it you know what love you know the people's personally because she was around a lot of it didn't change it well I'm not against him I didn't down them and beat him to death about it I just always said that's the sensible I think it ought to be sensible to just work that you say well I I need to do this I need to make sure and get my bills paid up he's everything to running good you know we can get by without this new car honey well we'll do that might even get better without that now but there's nothing wrong come on your prophet told us there's nothing wrong with this as long as you can make them that's nothing wrong with it it's not a problem don't you pay you - no me neither that's fine okay all right we get off of that part because see what did he say that God will anoint a church it's gonna come to a certain spot in time I don't know what that spot in time is when that spot in time is I don't know I don't believe you need to know that away I believe you just need to be prepared for that you know you've got a spare tire on your car and I dare say that any of us ever even checks to our pressure in the spare tire I have well what if I need it well the main thing that I'm trying to get you to say is exactly what I'm gonna read right here now let's go ahead with number four taken from the message oneness he's explaining the never her that kills you out yeah but we just receive enough Holy Ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants to fill every fiber of his being I mean it sure felt fiber of his church he wants to feel you're thinking he wants to feel your mind our statute of perfect man or he's fitting in water tumbler he wants to fill every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself our to Europe you're thinking just to surrender in God till his words just living right through you you don't know nothing else but God's Word just stay right with his word wants to feel every fiber of our being stature a perfect man adoption etc right talks about those things you know is it something that he's trying to be some different or something no it's expected it's expected of a Christian alright now listen I want to emphasize something but I want you to thank with me because we're gonna connect a little bit with with the Bible and bring it in to the way that it would lay out you know your prophets spoke of son of God son of man son of David that's not three gods that's God changing this form from one form to another alright and he started out in the Old Testament as Jehovah God yes Jehovah God was water a prophet talked about the prophets sons men was prophet all right and see now once he had to come in that way to die because son of god couldn't die son of david couldn't die but he had to come in that form to where he could die and the only way he could do it would be to come the son of man all right and then when it would come forth into that order then he could face everything and be crucified and give his life and things like that we just remember where you'd ever thought them that idea the son of man was was the Old Testament prophets but that was Almighty God through those prophets not them being God but God working through those prophets getting ready to come to a time that he could give his life that son of man like I said he couldn't do it a son of God he couldn't do it his son of David he had to come the son of man to be able to be crucified alright now to take that point now let's just read a little bit go ahead to the number five I guess he did the trial now watch what he's saying Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's identified himself as he promised much more can be said in these last days as son of man now he's coming to the last days because that's what I'm telling you you've got to have it and keep it in the right order to understand he's son of man in the Old Testament prophets and the thing son of man while he was walking on earth he gave his life he came back on the day of Pentecost the Son of God through the church ages the baptism with the Holy Ghost then he becomes son of David but just in between gar he comes back to fulfill Luke 17 30 in between the son of God and the son of David he has to return again as the prophet all right see the entire comes brother Branham on the scene he wasn't the Prophet no more than all of those Old Testament prophets were not the Prophet they were a prophet to make manifest the Prophet brother Branham was a prophet to bring forth the word he was not the prophet the Lord Jesus Christ his deep prophet so we got our story correctly as long we keep it right and if we don't win we'll go back and read what we started with are we gonna believe it no good now listen in these last days the son of man making himself known among his people in the form of his people and like I've always said it I know people they don't like to point but 1969 in Athens Georgia that was the first sermon ever preached and I preached on the son of man now preached on the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man I'll preach that then I still believe it today more today than I ever did before because I believe it's among the people now all right you say brother Branham was the son of Matt no for the random was a son of man the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ all right so then you put Christ will read one in just a minute here you Christ in His Church what have you got see she can be the son of man he said no no no you're not listening brother branham was a son of man the one the word came to the Lord Jesus is the Son of Man put the Lord Jesus in Bride form now what you gotta do we believe that so when I just don't I don't know that's that's just too much putting it making us the son of man brother Branham was part of the Bride of Christ right so I'm not leaving him out as I was covering our last Sunday I'm not leaving him out of the story he's a very a main player part of the story because he's the one that's letting us know who we are but he's not the son of man but put all of the bride of Jesus Christ together you got the son of man you ain't got in the last days group of people as these on a man and the others left out no all the way down through it's been son of man but that was your mystery come on now that was part of your mystery that's trying to bring out the other day he said well I can see Martin Luther with the Holy Ghost well most people can't see that within huh you know ice can't see he's son of man he's not the sort of than him that's what he's saying here he's coming back in the end time for a reason he has to go through the acts of the play he was son of man in the Old Testament bring it then he caught crucifixion all of that brought him into view then he turned as to the seven churches as son of God he changes from that and son of David in the Millennium to the Jews see then it's all laid in perfect order if we believe it but you say well I don't know see that's what I'm saying back in the old days I'm telling the other day about that tape recorder I used to turn it with a pencil to make it work where we could listen to tapes what I was doing I was only it's arising the Sun and in that message is when it finally clicked with me because I could see son of man I could see son of God but didn't go - son of David well that just blot out in my mind see because I knew there was some more connection see then here comes it and we'll read it who is this son of man in the beginning was the word he said it opened all that once Timmons was riding down the road hey he's come back in the last days as the son of man right brother branham was a son of man but he was that part that was within him with so much close to God until that part was the son of God you know son of man right but not he himself not by belief or not things are those orders you can't put him in order but the Lord Jesus Christ came back in the last days through a prophet thank God to bring us the word there's your son of man what's it as we'll go through some time and then we'll pick up then you can understand how the bride can be the fullness of the Godhead bodily then you can understand the quote always give you worth it well run said the guards not complete without you I didn't say them things you already seen it during anthems and I'm looking more than blank faces and then that's okay come on we're gonna go through it one more time one more time the random is not lease on a man he's a son of me me you by ourselves without the fullness of the Godhead being in the bride she's not the son of men either because they sparks left all but once you get the whole puzzle together and it comes together you see a beautiful picture in these life days that's a man making himself known among his people in the form of the people now see that what people was arguing with me about it and I always had argued they say he was in brother branham well praise God I believe that that's where we got the message but now he's saying he's among his people he's in his people wanna see the hour that we're living see what's one in the form of his people are the M morphe changing this form what Brad and see you'll understand then what people can't follow you you get over to revelations 10 what did it want I'm running our own Novus revelation 10 where brother Branham says revelations 1 in revelation 10 is the same revelation 1 says one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the Son of Man Girt about the paps with a golden girdle he said that's the same one that's in Revelations 10 well brother Branham wasn't alone in Revelation 10 brother Brenton wasn't one in Revelations 1 he's part of it he's part of the word right now just as we say the bride was part of the the mystery and got to be revealed brother Branham was part of the word right I agree with that I believe it could whoever always taught it he was part of the word and that's to be revealed but you don't make him thisan a man you make him what his wife see not the son of God not son of David but Son of Man the Son of God he said was a supernatural cuz that's the baptism with all the ghosts you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the supernatural what do you see what he's talking about it's to be made known in his people he amor fees to be made known okay go ahead to the next number five yeah that's it that's part of the same quote so we read it when the Son of man shall be revealed the son of man being revealed not the son of God in the church age he's put out of that now he's son of man revealing himself the word is becoming flesh among us now listen he's put out now you're gonna have to catch this and hold on for a few minutes till we do some more reading the son of man wouldn't put out the church ages because he never would hire the son of God was what was put out now you're gonna have to swallow a lot to think about brother Dale are you saying the Pentecostal people and all the rest didn't want the baptism and hold ago no you're not listening they want to shouting they want the emotional they want to think they don't want to reveal word the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the reveal word they don't want it that away they won't accept it on that basis they want it after shouting the crime that we pinned the the feelings so he's put out he's outside of his church as the son of God because he never was Darris or sort of man he has to come as son of man is he coming to that place go ahead to the next one should be sure as we would see Jesus number six Jesus was God in flesh now listen I mean you know you say I believe everything the Prophet said see if you do he was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifesting himself in the last days in the Son of man revealing himself in his church can you read if Jesus was God in flesh now he's in your flesh by the baptism of the Holy Ghost right the new birth all right then if he is then you've got the same God and made manifest again you've got the opportunity to be able to the bride to become the full word and then you've got the great opportunity to come forth as the bride being the fullness of the Godhead bodily well how can we be the fullness of the Godhead bodily ask the Prophet ain't gonna argue with you caught up reached this 45 years or maybe ain't no need of trying to never to argue than anybody about it I'm just gonna tell you what I believe and I ain't gonna are y'all help you find your quotes I'll do anything I can to try to help you but I'm just telling you what I believe I believe what the Son of Man is now revealing himself in his church look the human flesh he's in our human flesh the church making himself known you get it see God down here in his church making himself again the word the son of man being revealed in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom okay fall back now what was the days of Sodom son of man now that was Jehovah altes son of man he revealed himself in the Old Testament son of man now I'm gonna say something maybe I shouldn't but I'll say it according to the Bible the Son of Man creates his own bride bride that's according to Scripture alright that's in the Matthew Mark Luke and John or you know the word is what creates the bride okay that would it be any problem to see him standing back there in the Old Testament to say let her be and that comes forth Adam was created by the word Eve was created by the word any problem being you being it created by the word the word is creating a bridegroom that's the point I'm trying to get us to see yeah but that's too much of a for me to understand my god my little I just don't know no you don't want to understand that's the problem what is it to understand alright well I don't understand the got it what is it to understand the Prophet took it and uh more than and then they I said it the right way and in this day we had a prophet that had the understanding straight from God greater than Paul and Moses and all of them because of the opening of the seals all right but where was his emphasis always put I ask you to just do a simple thing just turn over to get your little book that shows the tape sometime and just turn over there about somewhere close 62 is the best to start off and and just start reading the titles to the sermons from 62 to finish in 65 just read the title Christ is a mystery the unveiling of God mighty God unveil who is the smell charity just read the titles ever title is related to the bride now we're gonna get to this probably a couple of weeks but you see this corn of wheat that went into the ground comes back in Luther come back in Wesley comes back in Azusa Street but in a great marvelous masterpiece falls in there and the Prophet preached two messages one called a masterpiece the other one see not error to show if you'd read them you'll see what he's talking about you'll just listen to those tapes you'll see what he told me he's talking about a bride form and he says it's so strong until you know what his point was sounds odd he said that Mary was not to seed well you said what she was a seed yeah but she wasn't the seed he's talking about he's talking about the finishing of all things the seed Jesus Mary see had Jesus within her she carried the seed but she was not to seed the seed was in her see we'll get to that because we've been through this over and over and all this keeps from unfolding more and more but it all now listen to my point it always if you'll watch the way I preach I come out here like it and I go right back to pointing to the bride right back to pointing to the bride that's the way it's always been cuz that's where it whines okay they don't wind up in Jesus standing there you know what I'm saying he winds up in bride standing there over the book of Revelation it says one lock under the son of man Girt about the paps brother and said that finish but who was that that was the Lord Jesus Christ in bride form because that's what it is now that I'm talking about now that's what I'm trying to bring alright go ahead with the next one if we get going number seven I guess okay the mighty guard unveiled Road ago and when the son of man is being revealed the son of man back in in in the church again revealed in human beings brother Brown had his part amen but he's being revealed in human beings more than one see because it takes the Bride of Christ the Son of Man back in the church again revealed in human being not son of God but the son of man again back in his church again in the last days we find that he promised that in God's promises in the church that's that's what I can't I can't understand our thinking really I'm sorry but we can believe the Godhead as the Prophet would explain that your father your son you're a human you're this we can follow that we're going on with it and thank God farther happen because that's the only way we could go along with it is to see what it is but then the minute you start talking about the bride and what she is everybody just instead of shot and glory hallelujah and getting up and running up down the aisles and all the way over and say that's right brother this is like a spellbound hitch well you know what that means to me I mean I'm sorry it means you just don't believe what's going on I'm sorry sorry to say it but it simply means that you don't know exactly what I'm talking about we've closed what greater thing could be then to realize that God's entire Bible all the word Old Testament all the way through the writings of Paul and Peter with some eight or consummate in a little bride of Jesus Christ standing there in Revelations one like unto the Son of Man Girt about the paps with a golden girdle Sarah Shourd standing out in feminist form then all the way to the book of Revelation everything is her her her she comes riding back in Revelations not seen on white horses his wife has made herself ready everything there's got to do with a relationship of wife showing how much he thinks of his wife does what he's trying to get us to see who we really are go ahead number eight in this life days there would be a ladder rain poured out upon the people in the last days I think the Greek word dire is quino's Kenosha's every pronounce which means the that he emptied himself out not in the way that we would say it like something was inside of somebody that emptied out but he poured himself out now listen he changed his m morphe was changing his form after the word it more freeform he changed from what he was to what he is he changed from the Old Testament son of man New Testament son of God now he's gonna change the son of David this is used in the Millennium alright listen he never changes his nature now that was one I like I love that point he never changes his night but on the day of pentecost he changed himself from being the son of man to the son of god he came not with the people Old Testament he was with the people right coming through and then even him him here for he was with the people now the day of Pentecost he came not with the people he came into people see the same guard to carry his ministry on through in this great age go ahead get the next one who is this Melchizedek which that would be number nine I guess got him or if he matched in the pillar of fire god and morphe in a man called Jesus God in morphe in his church now he don't seem to have any problems to dealing with Jesus to dealing with Church he seems like he could just make it all one and I thought that's what it's supposed to be God above us God with us God in us the condescending of God up there holy no one could touch him he settled upon the mountain and then if an animal touched him you got to die okay quit yeah there was God above us God with us is God in us the holy spirit not the third person the same person see I'm trying my best to get you to see if you can see I'm trying to think how brother Gary and I'm talking that day he said I see God in me try know that I got to God head straight well you know I mean I'm trying my best to get that him see it that way but it clicked I said you're wrong he's what I said you got to see him in Christ first then you see them in yourself you see them in yourself you can be all messed up see that's what I'm trying to get you to see that it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen what was the life Sunday services or the mind of Christ that if it's mind being you the mind of Christ is the baptism when the Holy Ghost coming and living in you in bride form its God in a soul the spirit not the third person the same person go ahead what we got this is number 10 God was in one person then his son Christ now he's in the entire church universal I'm gonna roll it on up a little he's in the entire church universal he's the same God now according to my understanding and I'm sorry I'm not too good on English and everything but when you're talking about something being universal it would boast to me meaning it's all over all the whole thing right so it's universal he was universal I go ahead and read it now that was the entire Church Universal go ahead to the net I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world he comes to the Apostles and then now he said and then the Holy Spirit wasn't only in one person it's in the entire Church Universal next time the Holy Spirit right cuz that's the we believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost we believe this the the Son of God the new birth is in everybody right not in every body and everybody that has received it right so look what he's saying the entire Church Universal doing the same works that Jesus did hallelujah now this is what I like I challenge the world to believe that and you're sealed revival break through this country these challenges just to believe what believing that the Holy Spirit was and only in one person it's in the entire Church Universal doing the same works that Jesus did so if it's the same as son of day son of God what about son of David I mean son of man to go with the neck go ahead to the next one because he just represented in one person there Jesus Christ but now he is among his church everywhere I love that don't you he's everywhere there's the bottom there is that same pillar of fire that same light among us burning forth the life that it did when Jesus in Christ Jesus doing the same thing in the bride church today see will you believe it he's doing the science I ain't now well I can't see you see when you you say things like that people say well brother Branham could stand up there and say and if we just had that ministry you know I mean I remember when it coming into the message and how it was the people are saying you know if we had the Ministry of brother Branham well praise God but you know what according to my Bible it was never to be that again now I'm calling like that now I'm talking about I'm talking about it was to come into its finality and the bride yeah but it was never to be one man again we're not expected to be for one man well of course you've got all of the returns and everything goes for that now that's people to me that ain't mine and you gonna argue a nobody about none of their returns or what are their do it I'm a firm believer in return I believe there's going to be an Easter next Sunday that's why I'm hoping we're gonna have the services outside because that Easter Sunrisers means a lot my whole thing okay what we got the next one there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his Godhead now look where he puts there would be a time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his Godhead now evidently he's saying there would come a time that means is to come into manifestation now watch but their time come forth when he would express himself in the fullness of his Godhead deity through his church having the preeminence in this church oh my the anointed man now the anointed people Oh mah to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by Huang accepting what Eve turned down what does he turn down who knows what Eve turned down brother Brennan said he turned down Hebrews 13:8 now this is the exact word Eve turned down Hebrews 13:8 you say well how could she turn down Hebrews 13:8 when he wasn't even back there she turned down the fact that he was the same he was the same God the whole time all right now once Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirits he anointed with a with a word what he turned down he comes back and we accept the word go ahead let's get a couple more okay so forth why but why ain't there there is nothing beyond the grain now this is laid down for later messages okay there is nothing beyond the grain it is back without an organization oh my a blind man could see that it cannot organize it so firmly against it it's the grain of wheat see if we itself the Son of Man will be made manifest the grain of wheat will come back to itself again the son of man in the life stage now that's got to be here that was brother Branham now he was a son of man he couldn't fulfill all of it he said he couldn't go ahead to the next one now he's been revealed through the church ages now watch through the church ages a son of God God be in a spirit the Holy Spirit he revealed himself in the church ages as in the congregation as in the congregation as the Holy Spirit among the people now watch him and we find in the lady of see in church age the life search aid he's put out of the church son of God put out of the church nowhere else was he ever put out in any age but in a lady of seeing age because they said he's rich we're we're rich and have need of nothing and no it not that you're miserable poor naked and blind and don't know it he was put out of the church the age and then according to Luke 17 he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man now he was reading the same Genesis that we read notice that sort of what takes place what was in Sodom they Brown coming back to the finish seat I think we've got one Lord I said go ahead is it the last one 16 no got a couple more notice now he came first as the prophet and they crucified him his own crucified already understand what I would emphasize that to start with son of man he came as a prophet you said well that was the job of the old title he was a prophet because he over the Old Testament Jesus is the new same God okay watch and now he came first as the prophet that was the Lord Jesus being spoke of by all those prophets then he came to his crucifixion his own crucified him he came as the son of man then after the Holy Spirit came he was then the Son of God Church ages God is the spirit he was the holy spirit son of God he lived through the seventh through the church ages as the son of God now watching in the Millennium he'll be son of David sitting upon the throne of David father David his father David he is the son of David now he's to you and I he's already the son of David don't you think like that he's already - son of David - me and you we're not gonna try to go through something - where we get connections huh no he's the word he's the word now what you never what I told you and remember between the son of God now you're coming over in the church ages what's it now now between the Son of God and a lady see an age they put him out and in Luke he said he would be revealed again that's not a man after he's put out the prophet fulfilling the rest of it see the scriptures type perfectly together see it's together son of man son of God son of David what was it it's the same God all the time just changing this form in morphe he just changed it it's a great drama - drama - him he is acting it out acts of a play okay we've got two more when he was on earth here the first time he was the son of man he could not be son of God then he never claimed to be he said he was son of man that's why they asked him he always takes on a man you know when anybody would have questioned him he said you see this on a man the son of man now son of man is a prophet he had to come that way because the scripture can he cannot come contrary to the scripture so he came son of man son of God son of man for a little space and son of David all right let's get to life's 100 at that part of it let's see okay so we find that in this man he had to be a prophet not son of God there he had to be son of man Jehovah himself called the prophets Jeremiah and them son of man when you see the son of man who is the son of man they kept saying then he served his office as son of man then he served his office now as son of God God is a spirit and when now he served through the Church ages and son of God now in the Millennium he'd be son of David when he sits on the throne of David he'll be heir to the throne son of David son of man son of God son of David and it's the same man all the time just like Father Son and Holy Ghost the office of God he was God the Father then he came god the son now he's God the Holy Spirit not three guards one God three manifestation three attributes or the same God all right is that clear now let's get the last one who is this son of man now you asked the question in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us now who is this son of man you remember that little statements I made a moment ago who created the world he saw what God did okay that's fine but what form was he back there he was the son of man he created the world he created all of these things he come down through the Old Testament that son of man prophet form he comes through the church ages and what's the key that it connects to now you fall back as I said to there in one of the Gospels and it shows you that the Son of man created all things he created his rod room on the day of Pentecost the baptism with the Holy Ghost and watching Luke 17:30 Malachi 4 and different scriptures that we are acquiring quaint idli that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right among us giving us life who is this son of man in the beginning what's the word the Creator God the Creator God was the son of man he still that Creator God he's still creating his bride that's what I like you know that every time a born-again person comes into the body of Christ God is creating varying part of his own being and when that's all finished now it's all finished then she'll be the fullness of the Godhead bodily we'll take that up next and when it does it'll turn out to where we take it on to the life to where that seed and you'll see why brother Branham would say cuz I remember when I first read that when retirin said Mary was not to see I thought I think they've made a mistake here I think the printers made a mistake her brother branham made a slip of the tongue but when he got through explaining it I seen I was so far wrong because I was the one who had the mess up not him he was exactly right Mary was a carrier but the seed was in her Mary gave birth sure but she gave birth to the word see that's what you and I got to do give birth to the word that has been brought to us come on come on I hope you understand I hope you'll follow the thought I'm not trying to make nothing out of anything other than one time the bride of Jesus Christ is God made manifest in another form called the bride which is supposed to be more important at your home you are you wife the way there's a minute now you got a yeah which one's supposed to be the most important you are you wife if one had to go die which would die understand you come to us partnering one had to go down who would go down to wife or the husband he treat your wife that way let her be what she is you'd like to build her up you don't have to make her up you don't have to make her no great big time she is a great big thing she's your wife you chose her with the purpose of being your wife and she chose you not by choosing she just accepted what
