Ohio so we really appreciate him coming and being with us he poured his heart out last night he's got a little bit left and he's going to let you have it tonight so just settle back pull on the gift I know one thing's for sure by the people that I've talked to online and here in this building last night he walked down your aisle several people have told us the different things that they had were going through that he had no idea that's the God we serve that's right that knows your need before you even get here and brother Wayne don't have to know it the Holy Ghost has got to know it he just yields himself and gets out of the way so the Lord can speak and speak to your heart so this thing Open the Eyes of My Heart as our brother comes the Eyes of My Heart Lord [Music] pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holies [Music] tore out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy holy holy holy You Are Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy I want to see you amen amen God bless you all tonight it's a real honor to be here and we trust that you've come to a man to Worship the Lord and to entertain the presence of the Angel of the Lord let him come by your way and amen it's certainly good to see this God family and brother and sister Tatum and God bless you folks amen there good friends and we certainly have been blessed through the years with her friendship and you know um I don't usually mention things like this but middle of that covet it a little tough on the Evangelist you know that was just almost complete traveling I hadn't heard from Brother Ed in almost a year went out to the mailbox one day and there was something from them and tell me that he was praying for us and this one to help us get through those times and and uh we certainly appreciate what they've done and say God bless you and amen to all of you and and our friends here brother uh our sister Colin someone told me we've got to be here tonight with us and we want to say God bless you sis it's been a few years since we saw you all and amen we trust the lord to bless you tonight in a special way and amen to be able to be here and be a part of the meeting see you all come out together it sure blesses our heart uh Brother Sam God bless you and thank you for the open door to be here tonight and Amen brother Wade and his family I just want to say that it's it's an honor to speak to what I believe is the cream of the crop the Bride of Jesus Christ I I think it's the greatest privilege that a man could ever be given and brother random said it he said you know he said if we had a charger of the blood of Jesus he said how we would handle it he said but God gave that blood to purchase this people so this people is more precious to God than his own blood so I think we ought to think about the preciousness and the value that God has placed into you and amen and uh so it is a tremendous time last night to speak with you and if you're first time being here tonight we say God bless you and uh and we're just going to go into a few things here that's on our heart and it would be okay if I just kind of relax and preach to you a little while and and let the Holy Spirit lead us down some paths and amen there's some things on our heart and so I just want to maybe take a few minutes in it this is a Saturday night so I don't want you to think that I'm that I'm confused on what day it is but I want to preach to you tonight a little thought that I had been on uh it's Sunday again uh for about three or four Sundays I walked in our church and said it's Sunday again and so everybody got got to laughing at me because it's Sunday again but you know I'm not actually talking about s-u-n-d-y I'm talking about s-o-n-d-a-y it's Sunday again let's go into the Bible tonight hey man we're going to go into Mark the 16th chapter uh if you have your Bibles on sometimes I like to do this and please don't think I'm superstitious but I like to open the Bible and then pray I like to pray about that open word amen let's just bow our hearts now gracious father we thank you tonight for the word that has been opened and Lord we open the pages of the Bible but Lord it would take you to open the content to break the scripture Lord to your children and Lord late in the evening on the third day you took two aside and the Bible said you broke the bread Lord and they recognized it was you and Lord when they went to tell their friends about meeting you the Bible said you appeared again among them and Lord day was left with a message that you would meet with them and Lord here we are today in this hour where a prophet has been told by the angel of the Lord I'll meet you in there and Lord we know this is the meeting place when your word begins to open to the heart of your children that's where you meet them then I ask you tonight as we invite you into this place on this Saturday evening the last evening of a calendar year Lord I ask you that your mercy would just come into this building may you take a may you take a mind of a man and may you set it aside and may you take the gift which you've deposited and use it Lord For Your Glory I ask you that the Holy Ghost would just come in this room tonight and speak to the need of your children father that Supernatural words would be spoken to your people and father as we would charge the enemy to back away from your children I pray father the Holy Spirit would come and it would bind the Brokenhearted Lord it would Open the Eyes Lord of the Blind and I asked your father that your mercy would just take the room now as we commit this meeting into thy faithful hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you and we want to look and mark the 16th chapter if we can and I want to read here uh from March 16 and verse 2. Mark 16 and verse 2. and very early in the morning the first day of the week there came under the Sepulcher at the rising of the sun now these will be the texts brother Branham used for the message the rising the Sun but if you notice it says very early in the morning the first day of the week until about 321 A.D what we call Sunday now was known as the first day of the week but then Constantine gave it the name Sunday which it was a Roman word Sunday all right now if we go to Romans the eighth chapter in the 11th verse brother Brown's going to use this in uh also he uses Revelations 1 18. we'll not go there tonight but he it's a powerful scripture but Romans 8 and verse 11. but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you Romans 8 and 11. now if we go to Luke 17 and 30. for even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and the day when the son of man is revealed God bless you you can be seated tonight we want to speak to you concerning this scripture it's Sunday again and in saying that I know that the prophet will actually speak to us the Church of the Living God from the message of rising of the son and in this rising of the sun brother Brandon was speaking to us about quickening power he's talking about what it causes to make us alive what what would what would resurrect us or make us alive and in doing so brother Branham was uh he he he's uh he's a powerful preacher and he has a way of saying things that are so simple that most of the time the average person will look over it and think well there's nothing to it but then if you go back and you just saturate it and listen to it and watch it it has something in it that is very much concerning the church now uh if you're if you're reading and and follow along with brother Brandon of course my brother by Adam will take us and uh and I'll skip the first part of the rise of the sun where he talks about uh what the power of the Sun the seeds and things but it he comes to a certain point and that he begins to read the scripture concerning the first fruits of the Book of Leviticus and brother man said I have a scripture here that I think uh he said I'd like to you to turn there and I wrote it down he said I think it might help you a little bit I found it in the Book of Leviticus if you want to turn Leviticus 23 and 9. amen uh he said now listen close in the levitical law God is speaking to Moses saying and all these things are a type now and we'll stop here for a moment in this type so brother Brahm is reading this Leviticus 23 9-11 and he's re he's reading it for a type now if let's read it together and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel saying unto them when you come into the land which I give you and you shall reap the Harvest thereof of then you shall bring a she for the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted now watch the scripture on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it so it's on the first day the priest shall wave it so he's getting into a levitical law where Moses is talking about that the children of Israel was going to come into a place or under a land and brother Branham is saying that it's a tide in other words they're going to come into a Promised Land I'm going to read paragraph 82 and brother bam says of course he says see unto the place and brother bam is going to replace the word he said unto a place or unto a position that I have given unto you now you speak to the children of Israel that when you get to this certain place that I have promised you that I take you to when you get there in that land now speaking natural here but it's typing the spiritual and you shall reap the Harvest thereof that's the scripture he said when you get to this place and you shall reap the Harvest thereof but brother random says it like this you have received what I have told you in that place in other words God said you're going to go into a place but then you're going to receive something in that place and when you get there and you receive that then you should bring a Sheaf of the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest and he shall wave it before the Lord to be accepted tomorrow after the Sabbath now of course when brother Branham speaks of this he tells us in the adoption he tells us that we are not going to a natural land but we're going to a spiritual land so the Church of the Living God like Moses brought them out of Egypt and then God LED them into a land Moses told them on the way you're going to a certain place and when you get into that place it'll be a land and there's certain things that will be there and brother random is saying now God has given the church a land and then when you get in that land there will be things in that land and when you reap the Harvest or you get the things that I told you was going to be there then you're going to give us a sheath waving and it will be on the first day of the week now this promise has been given to the church it's a spiritual promise that's why uh that you know if you think about Israel a lot of people will say well Israel is a Promised Land it was because God promised them the land that's that's why it's a Promised Land because God promised them he promised Abraham you can have this land and the reason that the spiritual land of the church is considered a promised land is because God made the promise that we could come to this place or this position in other words we have been predestinated unto a certain position that God has made us now of course in Joshua chapter 6 you see that it was God that told Joshua that he had given him this land now if you if you studied the Book of Joshua of course it came to a certain point that after the death of Moses then therefore he said arise and go over this Jordan and all of his people under the land which I did give them even to the children of Israel so there come a point in the journey where they were no longer coming out they were no longer journeying they were no longer in the wilderness they were no longer in the land of that they were they were living but what they were living in didn't belong to them they couldn't build permanent dwellings they couldn't build Vineyards they couldn't dig Wells they couldn't claim the property they were because none of it belonged to them they were only journeying through amen but then God finally told them you need to arise and go into this land that I have given thee now when God got ready for them to go in that land it was a it was this it was a certain season now I think it's powerful to acknowledge that God has seasons and in the seasons of God when he tells you to go a certain way or do a certain thing God is God enough to back that up and make a way where there just is no way for you to enter into the place that he told you could go amen when God got ready to send Joshua over brother bam said it looked like he would have seen him at a different time but he sent him in the spring of the year and when he sent him over brother says the Bible of course says that the Jordan was overflowing during that time would have looked like if he was going to cross a Jordan you would have done it at a better time but see God chooses impossible times to prove that he is a God who can rule the impossible situation and make it possible that it would take a supernatural experience to get where they were going it was because God was doing the leading and you know when they come up to the Jordan of course in the latter rains we're falling right we're talking about the harvest season we're talking about the spring of the year so the Jordan was full of the latter rain amen the rain falling and and as it falls how many ever been around the mountains when it rains in the mountains it melts the snow and the rivers run full with snow belts so you had a double thing going you had the rains falling the latter rain the Harvest rain falling on the snow and it was filling up the rivers and the and the thing was running full and that's the time God decides that Joshua was going to go over the river but see it doesn't matter whether we think it's a good idea or not but when God says get up and go over this land you can get up and go into that land and God was sending them into that land now the Bible tells us how they were going to do it of course they were getting ready to go and God told them to tell the to tell the Levites put the word on your put the word upon your shoulders and just begin to go over this land now would you get to the place that you come up to that River the Bible tells us that when the priests put their foot in the river amen that the Bible Bible says that the waters parted and it went into dry land and God was able then see to open up a place to go into something he had made a promise to them amen I hate to stop for a minute but is this my cutting in and out there or is it just in my ear it's just in my ears it's steady out there okay amen I've got a I've got an in and out in and out of whoever's on the sound it's it's clipping a lot so I don't know if you need to run the scanner or what but you see what it is is this God allows them to go through that promised land and as they as they enter in there it was in a supernatural time but God see wanted to Mark the season they were going in so he actually tells Joshua to Market in other words don't just let this happen but I want to I want to make a memorial of of the passing at this time so that he commands them to stack the stones and you know the story amen that he was able to stack the stones now if you're if you're a Bible reader there was actually two different Stacks there was a stack that was on the bank and then there was a stack in the river because he wanted them the stack Stones exactly where the priest had stood where the waters were supposed to be but they were there no longer so those stones were stones of Memorial of their Crossing so if you were walking with your son years later and you sing the top of a pile of stone somebody said what's in Stones piled in the river well that was where the priesthood how did the priest stand there well see God opened up the river right here in this part but if the river was high there was a pile of stones that was on the land over Neil gergow and the Bible tells us that they were there for a memorial so they could always see the stones now it's a powerful thing to me because I I I I you know if you read the history we actually been right there where those stones were stacked but they believed that's the very same place that John the Baptist baptized Jesus and of course when Jesus was being baptized y'all remember John sermon he said God's able these stones to rise children unto Abraham so he was there proving that the supernatural God is able to do things Amen in impossible situations he's able to raise people amen who were not people but it should make them the people of God God is able to take someone amen and raise them up to fulfill the problem promises that he has made for a certain generation of course in 12 Stones laid there in gilgal and it was a place of the crossing and the times now it's a it's a powerful uh significant thing to me to recognize the season that they crossed over and in Joshua chapter 4 and verse 19 it actually records that it was the tenth day of the first month and they encamped in gilgal I think it's powerful amen The Crossing happens in the tenth in the in the in the 10th day of the first month now if your study the Passover you know Israel's calendar amen it starts in in the in the first month but the first month is actually the Passover or the Easter time and the in the seventh month is actually September september-ish amen but it's it's a it's built off of the moons so when they say the the fifth day of the first month it's in the spring of the year and the Passover season amen now it's a powerful thing to me that that God chose this same time to bring them into the promise as when he brought them out in The Exodus under Moses remember Exodus chapter 12 when Moses went down to deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt amen if the Bible records that they was to do a Passover and when they were going to have a Passover it was to be done on the 10th day of the first month amen and so they were they were coming into Passover now you all know the word Passover amen is that God was going to pass through Egypt and he was going to execute judgment upon the gods of Egypt amen I know y'all probably all studied this out good but it's a powerful study amen that there's there's ten different major deities that was in Egypt during that time so when God began to exercise a power over Egypt that God was exercising power over every deity that they had to show he was the god that could exercise judgment over the deities of Egypt up show us that they would realize there's only one true God and that was the god of Israel this unseen God and he had great power with him and and we find out that God was going to execute judgment he said but but he sent Moses in there to tell the people amen that if you will put blood on your door y'all know that token amen you put that blood on that door that I will pass over your house but I'm going to pass through Egypt and I thank God tonight for the Passover that that was a lamb brother man said they kept it up 14 days before they could show us but he said there's your ages right there that 14 days watching that lamb but sooner or later amen you couldn't use the lamb you had to use the life of the Lamb is that right look at the mystery laying there amen when the death angel come unto the last plague which was spiritual death and brother Brown said that's the last pledge striking the church spiritual death amen but when that plague came they didn't have the lamb they had the life of the Lamb which was displayed in the blood it was the token the Corporal body was hid in the house but the life was displayed amen showing us that in the season we're living in that the Corporal body of Jesus would be in the heavens but the literal life of the blood the baptism of the spirit would be back upon the church amen that would protect us from the death plague that was falling upon Egypt during that time amen it was a beautiful time and anybody that's ever read Exodus chapter 12 if you've ever listened to a many theological ideas or you study any in the in the circular Realms everybody's always talking about New Beginnings New Beginnings well New Beginnings just pass over amen and the reason is because God spoke to Moses in Exodus 12 and he said when God began to speak to him he said let it be a beginning of months unto you in other words that God could come in the middle of the year and say the first month just started God can come whenever God speaks to a man things start over again Hey listen God can start right in the middle of situations and start things over again I know I know what I'm talking about he said well God can't take God can't change things but every time you write a check every time you you sign a name and date it the date you write down you write 2022 or now it's going to be 2023 and why is it 2022 or 23 it's after the death of Christ and it's before the death of Christ so he he is a dispensational motion that breaks up the channels of time of how you count time it's before and after Christ and you see your life amen that's it before Christ and there's an after Christ and when God comes into a life it brings a new beginning into that life and I thank God tonight that there's a memorial a new beginning of coming out and there's a beginning of going in amen look what God done to that new generation when he took him over in the Book of Joshua he recircumcised the entire generation that was born during that time I pray we get the knives out again and circumcise the children of God and the power of the Holy Ghost can return in the church and the and the reproach of Egypt will be rolled off of our young people amen that the power of God can reveal the church with anointing and Truth Amen to bring this generation to everything that God has promised them to become to I I think it's powerful there can be a new beginning I mean I I let me shock you I don't believe in second chances I don't believe in second chances somebody said well he don't believe in second chances no I don't I believe in third chances and four chances and fifth tenses and six changes and seven chains I believe no matter what chance number you're counting when God gets ready to change the matter he can change it in the moment he can change it and live in the very time you say how can God do it I'll tell you how he done it he took a lamb and if you got the lamb that I got Christ is my Passover Lamb and his blood has the power to change your life or your situation it don't matter how dirty listen I tell you what I've got I've got the Fuller soap I've got a blood that can clean the fatherless Center I've got a blood that can clean up any life I got a blood that can change any man he can clean up a dope attic he can clean up an alcoholic he can take anybody and change them listen I'm a witness tonight he can take a man that's lost and undone and fill him with the Holy Ghost and put him in a platform to preach the gospel possible of Jesus Christ as a testimony that he can raise a man up because God is able these stones to rise children under Abraham I'm talking about a real God I'm not talking about a second-handed God I'm not talking about the third God of some Trinity I'm talking about the God that created the heavens and the Earth had come right down into a life and give a man A New Beginning have you ever wanted to start over well let me tell you what a man can start over with God yes sir I believe it I believe a man can start over with God somebody said well brother Wayne hey man I don't I don't know about that stuff let me tell you why amen you all know that's barley Harvest amen scripturally that's barley Harvest amen that's barley Harvest and if you're reading your Bible that's exactly when Ruth came in Amen to Jerusalem Ruth came excuse me to Bethlehem when Ruth came into Bethlehem it was in the season of barley Harvest it was the Passover season it was a season of new beginnings she was an idolatrous she was worshiping Heathen Gods amen but her old husband died and God was going to give her a new husband to bring forth the seed of the Triumph of Judah and God had a season to bring him in and God's got a season for you and God's got a season for your children and I say this is the season God is marked the season he spoke to a prophet sent him among the church he preached a token message and he changed the dispensation oh brother let me tell you what the prophet of God said from this time and this time forward he said They Crucified the word and they're no longer a place of worship and When They Crucified the word he said from this time it's the word and the word only I do not have to humble myself to denominations I don't hear to hear what the domination thinks about me whatever a prophet said is exactly what God has for us in this hour we are under a prophetic word the dispensation of God the time of new beginnings amen we didn't even have a Roman word Sunday but we had the first day of the week brother Madam tells us this he said that Sabbath day is the seventh day he said but which we call Sunday he said but a Roman word they call it Sunday Son of God but oh how it's changed it's not s-u-n anymore it's s-o-n-d-a-y something changed now something's changed what is it brother random tells us this he said see it's a change something changed the day of the week something moved us from Saturday to Sunday my goodness I don't know about y'all but you can't find eight days on a calendar you they ain't eight days on the count of people say to me how do you put eight days you can't find it on the calendar because it ain't on the calendar it's back to the first day again it's the first day of the week amen what is the rising of the Sun the prophet of God said it's the first corn of wheat that raised from the dead it was God's first Corner Wheaton by quickening power God quickened his life and raised him from the dead of the first fruits of those that slept he was the Sheaf and that's what had to wave as the she for it was the first one to come to maturity it was waived as a memorial or Thanksgiving to God it was a sign a believing that the rest of them would come he said preacher what are you talking about when they come in that land after Joshua after they crossed after they come into land do you know the first battle they fight is the walls of Jericho and they do it down at gilgal which is so close to the crossing but if you go back and study it before they fight the Battle of Jericho they have a feast and they eat of the Corn of the new land do you know what they were feeding on come on church under the under the Wilderness Journey there was a man of falling out of heaven but the Revival changed now and they're not following they're not feasting at a Man Out Of Heaven now they're eating out of the Corn of the land now I don't know some people say brother ain't what in the world are you talking about I tell you what I'm talking about amen we're not just feeding out of the church messages anymore amen this ain't just a this ain't just a passing time but God had promised us 2 000 years ago even 2600 years ago through Malachi that they would come into Elijah Ministry in the last day and restore the word of Truth John told us that God would reveal the mysteries of the entire Bible in this in the end times amen Daniel said the book would be opened up that God would reveal the word so you and I are not just feeding from Men's ideas about this Bible I hope you hear me tonight men have held this Bible for 2 000 years and they have told you what they believe it means but in the end time and the lamb took his own word and the lamb is declared what the Bible means we are not feasting on the church ages we are feasting on the word of the son of man that is coming to this age he said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about feasting on the fruit of the message do you ever think about what Joshua ate before he met the angel of the Lord and took down the walls of Jericho something changed his attitude my goodness his diet changed into this battle changed have you ever thought about it he moved from a defensive battle to an offensive battle he moved from running from Egyptians to defeating the Jericho he it was a different battle amen amen we we had a new beginning it's a different land now we're not running because it said I'll tell a story how y'all gonna think I'm crazy me and Jewel me and Joe Farney got this in common amen I'm a security cat might as well tell you I'll just tell you up try I'm a scaredy cat when it turns dark I won't be in the house with a light on that was 40 year old before I let my wife shut the light out I was proud of myself when it finally happened I can sleep by myself in the hotel room these days you know you said preacher what are you talking about one ties in Albion Pennsylvania now now they don't believe me but it's the truth they got a haunted house up there it's haunted ain't it it's haunted people turn lights on all night dishes rattle in there stop move the last time that I was in that house the last time I was in that house I come home from a meeting and preaching for him I think it was a Wednesday night I walked in the bedroom and there's three lights about this big around swirling on the wall and I went over and I looked outside ain't nothing out there I met I looked around the room is there any reflection there ain't no reflection and I turned back and they're still there they're just swirling on the wall I've been in the presence of God a lot of times in my life that had nothing to do with my God you know what I did I told them Devils I said y'all give me five minutes I'm gonna pack my bags I'm gonna go this house don't belong to me you can have it you can have it and I packed my bags and I was in North Carolina by morning I said they can have it it don't belong to me but if I go to my house and them same Devils is on the wall it's a different thing brother I got grandbabies I got children amen it's a different attitude this is my house you gotta go amen and that's what happened to Joshua when he realized amen this is my land God gave it to me the walls have got to come down have you ever thought about why them walls came down really amen I would studying one day I thought it was powerful shirt and you don't have to take it if you don't like it but I liked it amen I was studied and found out that brother random said when the Jubilee trumpet sounded he said you had to come out of the walled cities he said because you couldn't redeem anything in the walled City it was actually a law if that walled city was built the houses couldn't be redeemed out of it so they had to come out of the walled City to be redeemed but you know when God sent Messengers into Rahab the Harlot you remember the walls were on the city so she couldn't come out under the Jubilee she couldn't come out under it but look at what God done he sent Joshua in there and walk down the walls of Jericho so God said if you can't come out of it I'll tear the wall down to get you out of it because she was the property of almighty God y'all know what y'all know why she was a property don't you she hung that red ribbon out of the wall I wonder where they got that Revelation I wonder where they figured out a token would separate amen a woman from the rest of the city they knew that God separated Israel from Egypt he could separate Israel's cattle from Egypt's cattle he could separate the firstborn from Egypt's firstborn it's God that done the separated and identified them and that same God identified Rahab and it was God's Property so God just tore the walls down let me tell you what you'll never do you'll never wall this bride up you'll never do it amen you can put her behind the wall but if she can't come out God will just tear the thing down and bring Grace into those lives hey man I tell you what God's going to come get his own and when these men come into that land and they found that corn God said I'll tell you what there's a memorial I want you to do I want you to wave a chief offering now I'm getting the chief waving tonight how many's heard the chief wavens raise your hand if you know the chief wave and see I don't have to cover it you know what I'm talking about amen that was a Sheaf waving to be waived he said that waving of that Sheaf Pro showed maturity had come put the seed in the ground the same thing come out of the ground showing God's process works God's process works death burial and Resurrection I can bury it it can die I can resurrect it and have the same thing that went down and it could come back again and when it returned in the resurrection God would make them wave it to the people what went down has come back again God has the power if you lay down the life he could raise it up again amen I'll tell you tonight that's exactly the Revelation that was laying there that when Christ went into the grave and he rose on the third day it wasn't somebody else come out of that grave it was that somebody else come out of there but Jesus was dead brother man said he was so dead remember that he said but when he come on the third day he had risen from the dead yeah that's why he had to be waived because he had returned exactly what went down had returned again I tell you it's a powerful thing but where it's real powerful is when brother Branham turns it to our day and he says now the same thing that went down in the book of Acts has got to return in the last day hey can I announce something to y'all the bride ain't coming she's here can I say something to you the alpha has become the Omega it's a declared word it's a definitive Revelation it don't need talked about and wondering whether it's true or not absolutely it's true whether you think about it whether you feel about that about yourself I tell you God said the alpha has become the Omega then I say the alpha has become the Omega so preacher what are you talking about I'll tell you wouldn't it be the master that tells you when the Masterpiece is done you'd think whatever you want to about the work but the one who designed it when he says it's finished it's finished I said preacher what are you saying brother Ram said Michelangelo hit the image he said and said speak he said that when he hollered speak it was a proof that it so matched his mind he thought it ought to talk and brother man said when the bride was smitten out of layout to see her he said see it was a sign that the church was finished come on church amen it was finished so no matter what you think about me a prophet of God says it's a perfect Masterpiece of the original image that God had in his mind God restored Michelangelo couldn't put the peace back but God put the peace back and now the Church of the Living God is exactly where it's supposed to be the word that went down is the same word that has returned brother Bynum didn't have to take one thing out of Jesus Christ to present him to you wouldn't it be something amen the same God that could cause the same Rose to return next year he's the same God that could cause Christ to return in the same form that it went down another prophet of God said when that happens it's got to be waived over the people now we know that the we know the chief waving we know that is Christ we recognize we're waving Christ over the people right it's Christ that was went down as Christ that returns we're waving Christ over the people but the thing about it is is Christ has to become flesh so people all the time asked me so well was the chief waving was it brother random or was it Christ it was both brother Brown said when I spoke them squirrels he said see he said God was using my lips see God had to have flesh God had to take on a body and show the maturity of the church before it could be a chief wave and he waved a sheep that the word again is waved over the people the Dead traditions the man is dead the Son of God is alive with the baptism of the spirit right Among Us given us life now y'all amen I just have to say this as clearly as I know how to say it William Branham was not a braggard there was a lot of things happen William Branham never told you about but why did he tell you about Hattie right why did he do it because it had to be waived over the people they had to know there was an anointing on the Earth come on Church a prophet went and told a little room about creating squirrels now I know everybody thinks they wish they could create squirrels but go ahead and tell the congregation you did it one time for me you think oh oh it'll make me a big guy no it'll make him look at you like you're crazy I've had Supernatural experiences happen and think man I can't wait to go tell somebody about it and when you start telling it you can see it in their eyes and you think I'll never mind just never mind never mind amen because all of a sudden either you're bragging on yourself or you're making it up that's the way people think that's right so can you imagine brother Branham telling the story of creating the squirrels and he said even a man was sitting there who had made something out of it he didn't he said and when he put it the way it was he said how do you write said to him brother Branham she said how did that happen he said Hattie all I can tell you is the same Jehovah Jireh that was over there with Abraham on that mountain it's the same Jehovah Jireh that produced that squirrel in those woods and she said it ain't nothing but the truth listen do you know what brother bam said about that he said there was a greater anointing came out then than when he created the squirrel I was a greater anointing when she agreed with a message than when it created the squirrel who said brother Wayne what are you trying to get out I'm saying that when this message was preached back there in the 1960s it was an anointing on it but when the Bride of the last days began to catch the revelation of this message there will be a greater anointing sweep this Earth and change our body in the moment in the twinkle of an eye the anointing of God is not for another day it's for this day it's for this hour it's for this time and when she recognized she was in The Presence of Jehovah Jireh she said it ain't nothing but the truth I tell you it's a powerful thing and brother Brown said he turned around and said to her now what do you have let's wave it hey man it can be done what will you get out of it come on what if he waved it what did it mean to you it meant you can too it meant that God has not just sent this for brother Branham he sent it for the church to be identified in the power of his word and look at what she done she claims my goodness too much too much too much amen you know what she did she claimed them children I'm gonna ask you why she did that what she'd been eating caused her to speak a certain thing brother random said she could have said give me a million dollars he said been on the table he could she could have said let my sister Edith walk and she would have got up and walked so she wasn't after a Prosperity Gospel and she wasn't just consumed with Divine Healing he said or she would have not thought it was a Revival when that Soul was saved but because she had been feeding from the Tree of Life the fruit that was in her mouth was the word of life and she said give me the life of them two boys listen I'll tell you what there's no greater Paradox there's no greater power upon the Earth and one that could change the soul of a mortal man from time element to Eternal from martial to immortality don't you water this message down just a Pentecostal idea amen this message is the power of God a Salvation that will change your life and a soul and a heart this message has power it has anointing it has truth it'll change lives it'll change bodies come on church if it will change your soul it'll change the way you live if it'll change your soul it'll change the way you dress it'll change the way you dress it'll change the way you talk it'll change the way you walk are you hearing me it didn't just Quicken the soul but it also quickened the body preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about the bride coming to Christ that's what I'm talking about in Rise of the stun the prophet of God said that Christ was the first one to raise from the prophets and so forth and type in many places he was the first fruits of them to slept and in the bride coming of Christ I've known a lot of people that don't want me to read that quote is it okay does that offend you in the bride coming of Christ I'll tell you what it don't offend that bribe but it will set that devil mad that's Satan's having a temper tantrum bubble man said let him have all the temper tantrum he wants to have he said because this bride is already glorified in the presence of God there ain't nothing the devil could tell God he didn't know about you that's why you need the blood that's why you need the power of God to answer the sin question that was upon your life but if God chose you for the job God provided a way to put you in the job to cleanse your life amen in the bride coming of Christ the coming out of the church they don't have to be a sheath wave so we've seen brother random women we've seen him wave it creation of squirrels spoken word over had his children we've seen him wave it a resurrection of a little fish the power of the spoken word to put a storm back what was he doing he was waving that the same one that had been on the earth two thousand years ago was not in Jerusalem he was back in the body of the Bride of Jesus Christ I challenge you to believe that the son of man is revealed in the form of the Bride in the last days I believe it with all my heart brother I meant I believe it with everything that's in me that there is a bride somewhere and it's been churches and churches and brides and Brides but there's got to come one that's kind of come one it's a vision that God has had of this generation you know I'm quoting a prophet I challenge you go look that one up amen what is it it's the bride coming of Christ on the last day it's the waving of a Sheaf I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and for the first time they will come forth for a bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism that will be a message the full maturity of the word has turned again into power and waved over the people my goodness to bring a resurrection in the bride this message is to resurrect the Bride come on church I'm not talking about just physical Resurrection I challenge you to listen to the rise of the sun William Branham was not talking about physical Resurrection the entire time he's talking about a spiritual Resurrection in the Church of course we believe the devil raise of course we believe there'll be immediate all believers believe that amen but a prophet was bringing the Revelation that there would be a spiritual Resurrection among the people that the same thing that was in the first of the Bible would be in the end of the Bible and the church would be restored to its original order and its original place a resurrection out of the dark nominationalism there'll be a bride hey man I'll tell you what you can preach a whole message right here a bride with a message now that's powerful I know they're trying to sit down our preachers but I say this for the first time preachers got something to preach I know it's Revival hour for the church but it's Revival for the devil too ain't it he's got new material he's trying to pervert this message but somebody's going to stay with it somebody's going to stay with it it's for a resurrection out of dark denomination you still got your Bibles with you look in John chapter 14 and read do you have it we can put it up John 14 verse 19 John 14 verse 19 put that up for us right quick John 14 and verse 19 brother about him in the rise of the sun paragraph 97 he said because I live ye live also because I live yeah look where he's quoting it from because highly of you also speaking to his wife because I live ye live also what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is and look you've got two resurrections you got a resurrection of Jesus you got a resurrection of the Bride now look at the power of this because there's two resurrections watch yet a little while the world seeth me no more but you shall see me because I live Resurrection number one ye shall live also Resurrection number two what a resurrection that was I live what a resurrection this is ye live he lives you live two resurrections Resurrection it was resurrection and it is so brother random is showing that he made us alive by the quickening power that's how we're alive we're alive by quickening power amen it changed us from denomination to the word I'm Gonna Stand rise of the Sun a minute paragraph 64 and because I live and ye live also and I live in you and the works that I do identify myself what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come alive now he's in Luke amen now he's over there in the book of Zechariah in that day Luke 17 in that day what day are we talking about Sunday in that day after the seventh the first day of the week again we'll go back to this same thing in the evening time there will come alive look it so Sunday is an evening message it's a powerful thought now the third day had a morning and an evening right in the morning was a rumor Pentecost he's alive in the evening was the proof of the Resurrection in the little room was it because I live you live also the works that I do will identify what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again there will be a resurrection in the evening time that it will be a resurrection there shall be light in the evening time you ever think about reading Zechariah in that day in the evening it shall be light in the evening it will be a resurrection see when it says shall be light y'all know that scripture's fulfilled right so you couldn't read it in the evening time scriptures will be fulfilled because God will bring a resurrection in the bride to Quicken them to the word that's supposed to be lived out in this day something has to make this word alive it is the quickening power of Jesus Christ Because He Lives amen My Redeemer Lives he's not dead that's him that's here manifesting the message in our generation William Branham proved that Jesus was not dead can I propose to you tonight that our lord Jesus is not in a grave could I propose to you that deities not even in heaven tonight but deity is in the Bride of Jesus Christ in your shoes tonight to fulfill the promised word of the hour you're living in it'll take God to do it amen what was it we was in a darkened world of unbelief we joined Methodist Baptist Pentecostals Presbyterians and there was still something wrong we just couldn't figure it out all of a sudden while we were groping in the darkness great Resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised word of God he brought light to us it brought light now the prophet of God tells us when that light comes of course what's it do amen light makes the darkness turn loose light you you plunge this room just shut all the lights off plunge it right into darkness turn the light on and the Darkness moves so light is more powerful than Darkness light has a supreme authority over Darkness this message has a supreme authority over every voice you've ever heard it has the power to cancel whatever the devil has spoke to you whatever the devil has said to your life Satan tries to claim you with the thought patterns of the denomination of the world but God said I'll bring another thing I'll bring lie to the evening time and when that light began to shine it killed every seed of denomination and it drove out the Darkness and Light began to shine and when light began to come into that place I'll tell you what it did when you come into that land you come into the on the first day when you're in that land the Sheaf will be waived it'll be back to that first day again be on brother Bradham says it in paragraph 109 powerful amen I'll read one away I quoted it to you there's been churches churches Brides brides and Brides he said but there's got to be one Hallelujah to become a real bride right so there's impersonation bride which is real bride somebody said well I a lot of people claim to be the bride I don't care what they claim to be there's a real one somewhere there's a real one because God said it would be there he said now watch this there's got to come a real bride now watch he must identify the real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics we've got to be real careful with this as message preachers as message people I personally lean to studying you're listening to me preaching you hear it don't you I I I I just saturate myself in it I I literally lay in the quotes in the scripture and how do they time which way do they go it's where my joy is it's where I it's where I really find strength and energy and I enjoy it so there's a mechanics of the word of God and how it operates and how it works but brother Adam said see but we can't only have mechanics he said but we've got to have the Dynamics of it he said see it makes the church live it makes it move and the power of the resurrection and until we come to that place until we find the place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a face law a lift or a simonized job when there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there has got to be a dynamics that will make that work think about you can prove this messages are as right ever ever service you can prove it's right every day in your life but till the Holy Ghost comes on it and makes it work in your life it does you no good come on church I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you what the word says the spirit brings life but the letter kills amen there's a lot of dead message people these days because they have went to letter letter letter letter letter and without the power of the Holy Ghost to come upon that life there's nothing to make it live it's a preacher what are you saying I'm saying if we're teaching the right thing it'll bring a power of God in the church said brother bam said it very clearly said the preaching of the mechanics is the gasoline and you try to get somewhere without gasoline come on Church crude oil made the gasoline gives you a way to go it's on the rise that's a great value in it because a lot of people ain't got it these days come on we need true word we need word preachers we must have word preachers but if it's gasoline let the spark come on it and see what happens if it's true gasoline Let the Fire come on it and see if it burns a little while but if we're just if we mixed up a bunch of ideas and we're putting water out in the church let the Holy Ghost fall and it'll just sputter out it'll just sputter a little but if it's real gasoline that's being put on the church when the fire of God begins to fall there's a spot that falls in the church and the Dynamics of God begins to move and you'll see Sons and Daughters of God moving and the power of the Holy Ghost oh hallelujah what good is it to talk about a God that used to be come on Friends brother man said we talk about God how he used to do and what he used to do and how he used to be you know what brother Graham said that was he said you're painting up a fire he said but no cold man ever got warm by a painted fire and it's amazing to me while men paint fires of yesterday they put out the fire of today they're talking about what God used to be and at the same time they'd laugh at the at the Holy Ghost they laugh at the emotional part of the spirit moving in the church they'd laugh at the prayer lines and the power of God that drops in the church but if it's a true and Spirit-filled god-cult man that's something that'll ring True by the word of God and bring life upon the generation that we have come to I don't think we ought to paint a fire I think we ought to plant the same seed they planted preach the same gospel they preach and if the gospel is preached with power it'll produce power it'll bring power now I'm sorry some people say well Wayne I've been in some of your meetings of people are just too loud and they just shouting and hollering and clapping and saying amen you excuse me this message has power I'm sorry if this message has enough power to get an amen out of somebody I thank God that this message will not allow us to delay dormant and quiet the prophet of God said the Holy Ghost is a man will amen the word of God something on the inside we're going to scream out to the outside I'll tell you why more people don't do it now because they've been intimidated by the mocking spirit of the end time that had black named the moving of the spirit of God but I believe somebody has got to be a real Pride somewhere that's the Holy Ghost and still move on the church and the power of God can still move in the power and demonstration of God in the Church of the Living God you said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about the Easter message we know the Thanksgiving message another man said the Thanksgiving message you never done it in the first place and they ain't never been one priest like that brother amen you did it in the first place but how many knows what he said the Easter message is he said the Easter message is the Dynamics and the mechanics are together and we're not waiting on it it's here we're not waiting on the Dynamics it's here the mechanics is here and so is the Dynamics that'll make that Mechanics Work in our life and it will only work as it comes together now when brother Brown preaches about it you know what he does he takes Adam and he takes out of Adam Eve he said where do you come from the rib God formed her body from the rib the same as he formed the bride from the word because the second Adam came from the word he said so he forms the second Eve from the word but where did Eve get her spirit she didn't get another Spirit she got Adam's spirit God put Adam's spirit in Eve and she lived and because he lived she lived and the Church of the Living God has been built from the material of the word and it's a perfect church it's a masterpiece bride she's built in the very image of the god of Mercy that opened the word and designed her from the higher part of his mind we did not design ourselves we did not design the church there's been a prophet Among Us that we are now the spoken word literal seed bride of Jesus Christ the designer has designed her the architect has anointed her and when that body comes to Perfection there's got to come a dynamics that makes her live this ain't a dead bride this ain't a dead word she's a living breathing manifesting Church of the Living God it's a preacher what are you talking about can we just clarify what the Dynamics are I know y'all know what the Dynamics is somebody hollered out what is the Dynamics it's a refilling of the Holy Ghost how many knows Brothers said that you you identify with me do you know it if you don't put it up the Dynamics of the church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost can we say it again the Dynamics to the church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost the mechanics is the teaching of the word the Dynamics is a refilling of the Holy Ghost how many knows brother Branham said you can only prove the resurrection by a Pentecostal blessing you can't prove it any other way he said you'll never theologically prove it you'll never prove it he said by your education he said only the Pentecostal blessing can prove the resurrection of Jesus Christ I'm on church amen the Dynamics of the Church of the Living God is a refilling of the Holy Ghost I said Mel you lost your mind no I ain't lost my mind somebody's going to have the fire of God somebody's going to have the light of God listen this is Matthew 25 I'm preaching Matthew 25 straight up to you and with ten virgins went out and they all had they all had oil and they all had lamps come on that is use of Pentecost brother Brandon said they dipped it they dipped in the Holy Ghost it wasn't it but they dipped into it and they all walked together but that was a dispensational change come y'all know that and those Azusa Street Pentecost didn't carry any oil in their lamps they had what they had but that's all they had but those other virgins carried a vessel with them and they walked with that word and they stayed with that word do you all recognize that when the Midnight Cry came and when the and when the the all the lands had gone out now but those five wise versions the Bible said they refilled the oil in their lamps they refilled the oil can you imagine that there's somebody going to refill the lamp somebody's Gonna Keep The Fire Burning come on church amen this is the end of the year the fire's been burning but we can't let it go out we can't let the fire of God go out of the church he said preacher what are you talking about that was a supernatural Fire Star art in the Bible that the priest offered God's burnt offerings on Supernatural fire and they couldn't have Strange Fire or they would die with Strange Fire right that that gives the mystery of why Elijah poured so many barrels of water on the on the fires that they tried to start with false gods he said I'll not have no Strange Fire on this Altar and the altar of this bride we don't have a Baptist fire we ain't got a Pentecostal fire we've got the fire of the supernatural God and in the beginning was God and in the end is God and he's come to refill the church to Quicken them to bring Dynamics oh Lord Jesus to bring this mortal flesh to his flesh if you ever thought about that I'm gonna quote brother random to you mortal flesh becomes his flesh amen now we're still in Rise of the sun mortal flesh becomes his flesh amen you said brother Wayne how are we supposed to do that he said accept the word and it will transform you it'll take you from what you was to what you're supposed to be it'll transform you amen it'll transform and his word brings forth Sons and Daughters of God that's what it's supposed to do I live he live also that's speaking to his wife to be quickened from the dead now you know Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1 and you who he hath quickened who were dead in sins and trespasses were in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the spirit of that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom we had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our flesh and our mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others I'd like that don't you by Nature not by seed we were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others amen but God who is rich in Mercy isn't that a powerful let me ever listen to that tape God rich and mercy 1965 but God who is rich in Mercy I'll tell you what amen there's my story right there but God I was going this way but God I I got Paul's testimony but God who is rich in Mercy this man riding this was on his way to kill Christians when God stepped into his path and he said who are you Lord who are you he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutive and look at what he done he blinded the Man's eyes so he could see [Applause] somebody shout hallelujah he blinded his eye so he could see he saw the great Pillar of Fire and it captured his vision and that's all he could think about and all that he could talk about because he had seen it with his own eyes he identified it was Jesus who was speaking to him look at what he did amen when he seen that he was only look at what he did amen when he seen that he was on his way to do something horrible and let me say something to you but God who is rich in Mercy sometimes it ain't what God Amen get you out of sometimes it's not well I was a drunkard and he got me out of this and I was a Doper and he got me out of this and he did amen but what about what God kept you from have you ever stopped for a moment somebody said well brother Wayne I don't have your testimony and I thank God you don't because the gods your servant didn't get you out he kept you out my wife heard me get my testimony one time brother wait she said she said honey I don't have that testimony I wish I had your testimony I said that's funny I wished I had yours she never drinks she never smoked she never kissed a boy she never dated the boy I was the first boy she ever dated or anything in her whole life she didn't have a clue what the world was about and she said to me one time she said well I don't really have the testimony like I was delivering from this this I said if you ever stopped and thought you got brother branham's testimony you ever thought about that maybe somebody's sitting in here tonight you was raised on church pew and you come up and said well I heard about this God's in the world and they come out and I don't have their testimony no you've got brother branham's testimony you never drink you never smoke you never dope you never committed adultery you never had fun come on church because God had a word for you so some of us are testified at the grace of God but he can bring you out of and some of you are testifying what he could keep you out of either way God be glorified tonight if that Pillar of Fire has come into the church with anointing and with power do you see what it was amen Paul was the one writing that scripture there he hath raised us up together he when he were dead in sins he hath quickened us together and by Grace you are saved it's powerful Paul's talking about a resurrection right there Paul's talking about a resurrection brother man said see what caused this change he said there was a time being dead but to Quicken means to make alive there was a change from Death to life I'm preaching to you now there's supposed to be a resurrection in the end time something brings the bride from Death to life I live ye live is that right brother bam says see there was something he said there's no other thing that could happen to a person so great is a change from Death to life if a man was dying physically he could get healed physically but it'd be a great thing but nothing so great as when a spiritually dead and God quickens that man to life nothing paragraph 38 same scripture he says yep once same message yet once in times past you were dead and many of you here tonight one time can look back and know you were dead but now you ain't dead tonight [Music] Hey listen I want the devil to know I'm alive [Applause] but no I'm alive you know amen years ago devil kept telling me when I first got saved you know you come out of the world don't devil haunt you now he'll hunt her he'll hunt right behind you and one time I heard brother random actually and discernment there was a guy come up in a prayer line brother man said I see a black shadow falling he said that's a haunt of your former days he said but listen you're covered by the blood glory to God Amen the truth will set you free amen it can it can haunt you yeah but it can't take you no devil told me one time he said I'll tell you what you've done good for a few years but I won't get you and I and I lived under that Hub just a little while and one day I was standing there and I turned around a little back to that devil and I said you know what if you could get me you would have got me you can't get me if you could get me you would have got me Ben you can't got me so you can't get me he said preacher what are you talking about I come pulpits sometimes I know people I'm gonna tell y'all so y'all know it's a secret it's a little deal I made with the Devil sometimes I come to the pulpit and I just wave a flag like it some people thinks I'm surrendering I'm not not surrendered at all what this is it's a little sign between me and the devil and when I get up in the pulpit and I'm waving a flag like this I'm telling the devil I'm still here I'm still living I'm still preaching I'm still preaching the power of God I'm still preaching the message of the hour you can throw all the disbelief a sign you want to and I'm going to Wave My Flag I'm standing on the mountain still believing the word of God because it's the truth it's the power of God in this generation it lets a man stand we're not standing by ourselves Because He Lives ye live also amen sometimes I'll tell you what y'all do but sometimes y'all just pick your hair pick your way just wave your way a little flag like this you said what are you talking about let that devil know I ain't giving up I ain't turning around [Applause] ain't doing it ain't turning around ain't going back I'm on your hands and I say I wasn't always in church I I was a little bit rougher when I was in school and I was about seventh grade I think I was four foot ten and you ain't gonna believe this but I probably weighed 130 pounds sopping wet I was a scrawny Feller but I grew up with three older brothers her two older brothers one younger brother but you know what I found out one day a big old boy big old boy come over and he told me she's gonna whip me I looked at him a minute and I said well I'll tell you what you do I think you probably can but you got it to do what you waiting on sometime or nothing you've got to tell the devil well you might do it but what you waiting on because if you're waiting on me to back up I ain't backing up if you're waiting on me to quit I ain't quitting if you're going to defeat me you're going to have to do it looking right at me because there's no retreat in me there's no backup in me there's no quitting me listen you're the Church of the Living God it's been anointed for the age we know who we are we know why we're standing here we know what we're about we know why we're here Amen brother bam said you got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life then you always were because there is only one form of eternal life and the reason we were is because we are a part of God and God is the only thing that's eternal somebody said to me one time so brother Wayne hey man how do you believe in this predestination stuff I said because I was a part of God just same as your son's a part of you as a part of him I didn't exist outside of God but as his life existed so when he manifestes his life it becomes a son through manifestation it's alive amen now now I I I just I'll just say this amen I'm going to preach the message now somebody's got a little idea or they think this way or think that way that don't that's not anything to do with me I'm just going to stay with a message that all right with y'all and the prophet of God said but one day you being a part of God you had to be a part of the word and when you heard the words you knew where you come from and you knowed it was the truth you were always see the seed was always in you the word seen the word and that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you come to it and you said preacher amen now I don't I don't understand that well let me sit let me put it in hillbilly terms now the prophet taught us a lot of stuff if you come off the farm things get simple if you'll hillbilly you catch the message quick he said it was a little duck born down in the chicken yard one time and he said that little duck was trying to fit in you talking about an ugly duck amen he didn't look like none of the other people he was with he was webbed footed and had this bill he seemed funny talk funny act funny and he was different but thank God he was different right you were different you always was different I remember in high school I was different when I was in college I was different when I was with my friends I was different they amen I was always different I didn't understand why I was different but I was different and that duck was different and brother man said things went pretty good to one day he walked around the barn and he saw a pond out there he said the first time he smelled that water he went straight to it I'll tell you what him and because he was a duck to begin with amen it didn't change what he was it only revealed what he was and the prophet of God said see we always was a son you were a son to begin with the same thing that is to believe her there's something in him when he meets God face to face he comes to himself the seed is in him and it's quickened watch it's resurrected now that's why I'm preaching this it's Resurrection it's a quickening of that seed brother man said something got to hold of us something quickerness and that seed come to life they commence filter brother man said notice the word cannot deny itself it is satisfied or it's a desire of what what made you desire it in the first place now that's the question isn't it what made you want this us to begin with that's a powerful question sister April I tell you what that if that that is the answer to our life what made you want it to begin with what made you desire it out of all the others of all the people of all the situation you desire I'll tell you what it is brother random said because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed with eternal life that was always laying there it always was in there and all the father hath given to me will come there isn't any of them going to be lost brother praise be to God you said preacher what are you talking about brother Madam says it and take a man's filter he said when I think a man begins to think who he's going to stand before and the word of God when he begins to think then he begins to draw through that there's see there's nothing can get to it but the Holy Ghost oh brother amen how can a prophet of God say you would never commit adultery that you were ordained to begin to make a stand it blew my mind one day I was listening to brother Branham he said there's a second Eve that won't fall I mean it was it was a it was a mind-blowing revelation brother man said here it is here's the secret the second Eve cannot fall I fall dear Lord how can she not fall and one day a couple years later I'm listening to another sermon and brother Branham on the tape he says she can't fall he said that first Eve she fell from the word now that's that's the secret she fell from the word he said but now that second Eve can't fall because she is the word oh brother amen she can't fall because she is the word amen and heavens and earth could pass away but my word will never fail look at that if that word Amen brother bam said what is it it's the germ the c word from the beginning that God Amen you was in God at the beginning standing there drawing see life the seed is in Your Heart by for the nation the seed is already in there by the foreknowledge of God predestinated when it draws it can't draw nothing but the word look at that God put something in you that can't receive nothing but the Holy Ghost isn't that powerful the Bible said in the last days it would begin so deceptive it would deceive the elect brother man said there's election he let if it were possible isn't that powerful that if it was possible you could be deceived if it were possible you wouldn't be able to but God has designed you in such a way that you could not receive anything but this word my my mother there's only one thing that will pass through there that's the Holy Ghost amen what is it it's God Awakening the church to bring the promises of God effective upon the church now I want you to think about this brother man said there'll be a second crucifixion of Jesus Christ right he said the church would have a second crucifixion of Jesus Christ he said but this time it won't be crucified on a Roman Tree he said it'll be crucified from the pulpits right he said what do they do he said they don't they don't crucify the flesh they crucify the effect the word has upon the church we don't want to crucify the effect of the word but the word was sent that it might manifest Christ in the church now look at what he said it'll bring an Effectiveness in the church now watch this brother man said there's three Realms there's three Realms we live in we live in a human realm we live in a divine revelation realm but the Third Realm is a vision realm and look at the church we have we have moved to the realm of vision God has had a vision of the Church of what she should be we are living in the vision of God concerning the bride in the end time look at Ezekiel 37 it said that he would cause the Israel to come out of the graves those Graves were not natural Graves they were Graves of Russia and Germany and Italy and they were grazed all over the world because they were Jews to begin with they were born in the wrong place they were placed in the wrong countries but they were Jews to begin with and God would bring them back to their Homeland o Church of the Living God and God has a message you were in the graves of baptism in the grace of Lutheran and in the graves of denomination but God said I'll bring them out of the Grave there shall be a resurrection in the end time what is it it's a resurrection God has opened the graves and called the church out of the Grave I tell you it's a powerful thing when you begin to study the resurrection I know I know when you study I know when you study here and you see them when you see Lazarus in the Bible it's a natural resurrection of course it is but it would be would it be all right if we typed into the supernatural in the spiritual Resurrection would that be okay with y'all do y'all recognize that he was raised on the fourth day do you recognize that Jesus went the other way until he was already gone and returned when it was too late for him to resurrect and it happened to be an evening time he returns and comes according to vision and you you watch you the beauty of the scriptures amen that one of the girls stayed in the house and the other goes out to meet him you know there's a lot of going on there amen but but I want to get this point that Jesus was coming for the reason to fulfill the vision of Resurrection he was going to resurrect Lazarus and Lazarus was in the grave now y'all y'all study restoration of the Bright Tree you studied Joel 2 you know that there was four bugs of death and there's four Restorations right the last one is the word and the word itself was coming for the resurrection of Lazarus and the word itself comes for the resurrection of the Bride somebody else didn't come to resurrect you but the word came to do the resurrection now and when he found was wasn't it Martha comes out I got it written down here but it but it was it was here in the scripture amen that when I believe it was Martha comes out to him and she actually says to him Lord if you would have been here my brother wouldn't have died I think it was good over she said Lord at least if you would have been here when my brother Wouldn't Die do you know brother Brown said right there she had a right to be mad at him she had a right to ball him out for going the other way when she needed he said she had a right to do it he said but if she had took her right she wouldn't have seen the supernatural he said and you've got a right to live the way you want you got a right to think the way you want but if you keep your right you will never see the supernatural that resurrects the church right but she surrendered that right and called him Lord and said if you had been here my brother wouldn't have died and Jesus and Jesus therefore amen I think it's powerful amen that's when he began to tell her listen now amen amen Jesus said to her won't you just take me to the place where the stone lay upon it and Jesus said take away the stone Martha and the sister of him that was dead saith unto him Lord and by this time he stinks he's been dead four days now what she's telling him is I appreciate you trying but this ain't going to happen now this thing's too far gone for there to be a resurrection now you should have come a couple of days ago while this thing was still revivable but you've let it go too far too long and it ain't going to happen now and Martha said to him she said unto him Lord but this time he stinketh and he said been dead four days and Jesus said unto her I say unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should see the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I think thee that thou has hurt us me and I know thou has hurt us me always but because of these people which standby I say it that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth now y'all know y'all know what that means that means a dead man four days in the grave he's done fellowshipping with Abraham he's done sitting at the table he's done talking with David and Abraham he's setting their fellowship and he hears a voice Lazarus can you imagine when he stopped and turned around and looked at all of them said hey y'all hear something y'all hear something no we don't hear a thing brother Brandon said look he said if he hadn't said the man's name the entire grave would have emptied but he called him by name I hope you're hearing me tonight amen I'm talking about a resurrection in the graveyard I'm talking about laodicea everything is dead but he called your name and there's a Revival in the middle of laodicea because a Lamb's Book of Life was opened and he called you by name I'll tell you what man he heard that voice and he was trained to that voice he was trained to that voice and he answered that voice you know what do you know what the prophet of God said about it he said Martha told him said Lord said it's too late and brother Brown says watch what she says but even now but even now brother man said there was a turning point but even now amen and he told this woman go go roll away the stone and Jesus said unto him Lazarus come forth and a man that's been dead four days comes out of the Tomb I'm talking about Resurrection a man been dead four days comes out of the Tomb because life was speaking that dead could not stay in the grave when it called his name now you may remember the service brotherhead you may remember the service when something called your name brother you remember when it was that you were sitting and something called you by name amen some of you said maybe you was in some other place but something identified you and you can't get away from it you can't shake loose of it you can't outrun it amen something has identified you in this resurrection and you come forth from out of the grave now I want you to watch something here John 14 go back to the 19th verse and let's read that verse again and let's read 19 and 20 together and uh can I share something a little Revelation here with you amen John John 14 verse 19 and 20. I want you to watch something happens here amen now I've got a bunch of quotes on it I'm not going to read them too because I don't have time but John 14-19 what he says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me now there's your two resurrections because I live ye live also what happens in the very next verse what's the next verse and at that day oh that's Sunday at that it's Sunday yo at that day ye shall know that I am in the father and you and me and I and you brother random breaks that down to this day right but he continues to say this is when Elohim becomes tangible in the bride y'all remember brother bam said it's the it's God amorphe In Bright form right amorphous speaks of the invisible becoming visible he becomes a visible tangible God in The Bride of Jesus Christ you become the hands and the feet and the body it is the bride body of Jesus Christ now if it's been resurrected now he's telling you you're going to be transformed that your mortal flesh will become his flesh so it isn't good enough for you just to be alive you've got to take on the word even the power of transformation y'all heard it y'all heard the entire take mother said now that we're saved now that we're filled with the Holy Ghost what do we do he said we're to be formed of the image of Christ so we're to take on the word that it would it would bring us into the image that God had designed us to be in in the back part of his mind and there's only one message it can get you there i i i i Alan's a good probably a good preacher Billy Graham's got some good thoughts uh I heard brother Andrew said it one time somebody said something about TD Jake said got some good points he said I got some good I got some pencils in my drawer it's got good points too we ain't talking about good points we're talking about the bride of Christ and if you want to be a good church member listen to any preacher you want to you want to be the bride of Christ you better get out of this message it's the only thing that can develop you into the image that God saw you in to begin with so he resurrects the bride and then he shows himself in the bride by the development of that word in the church it is the transforming power it's the strength in the part so watch what happens when Lazarus resurrects what's in the scripture when Lazarus resurrects Jesus don't leave him there he don't just resurrect him he turns and changes his dressing he says to them loose him yeah y'all know y'all know where brother Bram took that loose him he said let's take that word in the Book of Revelation 21 and there's a new Heaven and a new Earth coming down a new Heaven because the old Heaven and the old Earth that passed away but then said no it's not annihilated he said it's a change it's a change of the governments it's a changing of the of the of the politics it's a changing of the control brother Brian breaks it down in three worlds old world present World New World right he changes the thing he adorns it so what are we talking about that that word pass away means to loosen from the former condition it means to release from the bondage of what it has been amen that was an old Lazarus that was the present Lazarus and there was a future Lazarus the Church of the Living God Amen God wasn't going to leave him in the present State he was alive but it was bound up look at the Scripture it said loose the man and let him go blue seem and let him go I've got a vision for him I've got a purpose for his life it's the same words Jesus said to his disciples concerning the cult remember that amen Zechariah said he would enter the city right in that colt that cult was ordained to be the thing that carried the word of God now of my goodness there ain't enough time to preach I just ain't got enough time to preach y'all too good a congregation amen that that cult sitting there and I the reason I say that because I want to preach on the mule right now the cross-eyed lop-eared not need bowled back y'all remember him and he said I'm going to die at the moment the farmer sees me y'all remember that one I'm going to die the moment the farmer sees me brother Ben said but he had a scriptural taught mother and she said honey he don't sacrifice mules he sacrifices Lambs so in the morning he ain't coming to get you he's going to come and get a lamb and if he finds a lamb you can live and if it finds the lamb brother Brown that's when he said any old any you know any old man could be redeemed y'all know what I'm talking about amen anyone can be redeemed if you find the lamb and the prophet of God said when that when that when that mule got its lamb he kicked his feet up and joined it I I mean maybe it's a stretch but I kind of figured that was the cult that was tied down there for some reason they didn't write him and some reason nobody wanted I'm preaching to you for some reason the world didn't want you for some reason you were a reject everywhere you went but there was a land for you so God didn't kill you he held you to a time that he would lose you God would send the servant somewhere to untie the knot that held you that you could pack this word I'll tell you when he come off of the mountains in the Book of Matthew and he'd come off of that mountain and they began to rejoice and scream and holler and praise God Amen I tell you what's powerful I bet that I bet that colt might have felt pretty good a time or two and all them people shouting and screaming but they wasn't looking at him they were looking at that lamb okay thank God the word has chose a vessel to ride into this age take away the grave clothes that hold the man he's been in them closed four days he stinks he's he is he has transferred his stinking rotting corrupted flesh has transferred to the clothing he's wearing and he's he's not presentable and God won't leave him that way and nor will he leave his bride dressed in the rags of unrighteousness of denominational teachings he will not leave us come on Church the rejection of a prophet he said the the crowning of my ministry will be the dressing of this bride she'll be adorned in the righteousness of the word of God y'all know where I'm at don't you take the grave clothes off I love how y'all y'all ever y'all ever you ever preach on that much it's powerful point of scripture it said it was bound hand and foot he was bound by his feet was bound his hands were bound and you know you could start at the bottom just go up if you wanted to he was bound hand and foot y'all ever think about this uh years and years and years ago I preached the entire sermon titled mummified Christians [Music] y'all can just imagine how that went thank you see you're alive but you're bound see Lazarus was alive he was breathing but his feet was bound y'all don't want that you don't want that you know what I'm talking about he couldn't walk he couldn't obey the word he couldn't walk the word now I like to put it over a little bit like this he couldn't dance either isn't it something God give us all these wonderful musicians come on Church [Applause] now adopted church has good musicians it's part of the body and these musicians that was ordained of God to play so a church that's going to be positioned in place going to have musicians God's going to bless you God's going to put them there and you said well when we don't have any well you've got to send them you got to get them there but if you got him God gave them to you now you said preacher why you say that because they some people don't like to hear our musicians play don't let them play with their heart you know they want to play want them to play but not play y'all know what I'm talking about play but don't play you know play but don't put your heart in it but I think you ought to put your heart in it I don't think you're playing for American Bandstand you playing for God [Music] come on church I know there's Church of Christ Spirits right here in the message I know it is they don't want to see our musicians enjoy what they do and play their music but God does God loves music I'm in the message you know I am amen and again God loves music but if you got good music what happened that we can't dance now I'm in the Bible y'all know I'm in the Bible Psalms 150 said praise God in the dance now it's either the word or it ain't the word come on church but something has took the dance out of the church y'all tell me who took it out somebody tell me please tell me who took the dance out of the church who bound the feet of the Bride so they can't dance no more now I I you know I'm just being honest I know I know we got a mixed congregation in here and you know what I mean it's it's a powerful thing to me that people have a liberty to dance I feel a little check right there a fell a little something come in the room but let me tell you something about that I know where I'm at scripturally you don't have authority to take the dance out of the church God put it in and by what Authority do you take it out come on Church I don't believe y'all y'all have hootenannies around here huh you used to have hoot nannies I grew up and they were hoot nannies all around where I was at they'd go out and drink yeah they dust the floor with some flour and they'll help play their banjos and this and that and they'll get out there and Hoot nanny I don't think our young people ought to have to go to a hoot Nanny to enjoy dancing right I don't believe it I don't believe the first time your young person dances they ought to have to go to a hoot Nanny to do it I think we are to get an atmosphere in the church that it ain't how to order to dance [Applause] somebody worried about a kid crying here a while back and I told him I said if you was in Africa you wouldn't even hear that kid but our churches get so quiet that every little thing bothers us somebody say Amen but I'll tell you what if you get the grave clothes off bring the worship back in the church amen left the Church of the Living God worship the god of Creation with anointing him with power amen I tell you what it ought to not be a quiet place come on somebody said well I can't take all this noise brother man said this is the quietest place you will ever be y'all know what I'm talking about brother man said it clear he said if you go to hell it'll be screaming National teeth he said if you go to heaven the angels of God are going to be worshiping y'all read the book of Isaiah and Isaiah went to the temple and the Bible said that the voice of the Angel shook the temple post brother man said that was one Angel did that one Angel the voice of one Angel shook the temple post he said what's it going to be when you get in heaven and there's a million Angels worshiping God at the same time brother let me tell you what if this down here gives you a little Goosebump he said you'll freeze to death when you get to heaven amen and I'll tell you what else you're going to have you're going to have me and brother Wade up there and you're gonna have to listen to us a hooping and a Harvard and screaming and shouting he said preacher what are you talking about you get this boy in heaven and you'll see what I'm talking about give me me out of this whole world and all of its troubles and struggles and put me on the streets of Glory [Music] I know y'all think I'm crazy but I I tell you what I am I'm free I might be crazy but I am a free man I am not bound up with what somebody thinks about me I loved it when God finally delivered me amen of what everybody in the church thought about me I got to a place I really don't care somebody said well somebody's gonna think bad of you really are they really what did they think about David in the Bible then when he danced as a king before he is God Amen I tell you if a king can humble himself and dance in the presence of God and what about a preacher that's been saved by grace and the power of the Holy Ghost come down on the church I tell you what I think I think we ought to take the grave clothes off of the people and let them get the dance back from the church let him get joy back in their heart let him get joy back in their feet so preacher what are you preaching about I'll tell you what I'm talking about I'm talking about we're alive take the gray clothes off so we can live it was on their hands can we just preach about it is it okay y'all ain't no hurry are you I feel pretty good in here right now I thought about taking a run a while ago it feel pretty good you're going You're gonna run with me ain't you I was out I was at it brother uh Royal Shrewsbury is one time in Beckley West Virginia you know brother Roy and I was up here preaching my weeds having a wonderful time and uh brother Bobby was his song leader during that time and at the end of the service they was playing just a song the power God dropped in there and my goodness we got the dancing on the platform I I did it and we were just dancing on the platform we were enjoying ourselves and brother Bobby's behind me and the next thing I know he's dancing with me and he starts screaming and took off running out the door running around the parking lot run back in I said what happened brother Bobby he said I've had a knee it's been banged up for years he said I've been looking at surgery he said I've been terrible by the way and I ain't been able to work or nothing else he said when I got up to dance with you he said God healed that knee brother Wayne there ain't a thing wrong with me right now amen because see the supernatural touching he said God healed my knee now I'm gonna have to get some lungs because I can't do this running he said I'm too old running's funner when you're younger you know lose some Your Grave goes off I'm gonna get them get them off the hand we lift our hands again we lift our hands and worship God and praise God and tell that Old Devil look here I'm gonna shout I'm going to praise God Amen look at me Church you don't have to have your hands bound you can worship God you can clap you can praise God live I'm free I've had the green clothes taken off no shame to this God I serve no that you you can just go right up can't you because he had a the Bible said he had a cloth upon his face which spoke of what was coming his mouth was covered his eyes was covered he couldn't see the word he couldn't speak the word he couldn't prophesy he couldn't he couldn't rejoice in the spirit he was bound by grave clothes but God didn't leave him there he resurrected him and took the grave clothes and this message has done more than resurrect us it's done more than Quicken us it has loose the bands that would hold the church that they might have Liberty and have it with the spirit of God he said preacher what are you talking about I'll tell you what I'm talking about I'm talking about a spiritual Resurrection but not left like you were I see it in the scripture when the prodigal son come home y'all remember he left but when he got ready to come home how many knows what the Bible said he said I will arise and go back to my father's house you know what he was doing come on church he was about to eat the husk of Pentecost he was getting ready to eat hush because he was living in a famine but the only reason he was in a famine is because it wasn't his position and he was trying to be somebody else and listen somebody else probably can be that but not you you'll never make it out there brother you ain't you ain't anointed to be there and when that man got ready to go home he said I'll go home and be a servant even the Servants of my father's house eat better than this out here what I'm a fooling with and he got ready to go home and the Bible said he arose do you know when he got home the Bible says his dad said my son that was dead is alive he resurrected church he meant it was a spiritual Resurrection he was dead but he was alive it's your story you were dead but you come alive gave your life and look at what happened when that prodigal son got to coming home listen there's a lot of men come over that Hill there's a lot of men walked down that road but when that father seen that one come when he seen that one coming he didn't let him get to the house no sir he didn't let him get to the house you know what he done he ran out and met him they sang that song the only time God Ran it was powerful isn't it God got up and why he he met him out I thought about it he met him out there and said my son that was dead is alive but you know what he did when he met him out there he embraced him how he was you know brother random said the moment you said in your heart I'm sorry God accepted it look at this Amen brother Brown talks about brother man talks about this and he talks about that mother of the prodigal son do you know what he said the reason they knew he was coming home he said because she had been praying he said in the angel of the Lord was about a half hour in front of the boy and said your boy's coming home so they was expecting him that morning because something had supernaturally taken place and when he started coming over there that was their boy that was their son and he was coming home and that Dad went out to meet him you know what he said I I don't have time to preach on the best road but I'll tell you this powerful thing right here he said bring me the best robe do you all know what the best robe is in a house like that that was not a poor man he said bring me the best robe bring me the best robe we got come on now the boy was standing there and his father the father took off the dirty garments and put his own personal robe around his own son look at what he did he was identifying that boy this is my son this is not a servant and no matter what you think about yourself and no matter what the devil has said about you you cannot return to God as a servant because you never were a servant you never were an angel you always was a son and you can only come home as a son and when he got ready he put that best robe upon that boy and I tell you what man you could preach an hour on this thought right here and he took the shoes and put upon his feet he said Preacher what's that matter because back in those days slaves didn't have no shoes slaves wasn't allowed to wear shoes and it allowed them to identify a slave a long ways off but that man was trying to come home as a slave and he couldn't receive him as a slave the household couldn't receive him as a slave he was not a slave he was a son so his father put shoes on his feet put a robe upon his hand Put a Ring upon his finger you said preacher what do you get now he would not allow that boy to go home in the condition he came in he wouldn't let the rest of the house see him in that condition but he changed it before he got him home whole Church of the Living God there's a pride that's going to hold one of these mornings but we're not going home without shoes we're not going home without a robe we're not going home without a ring but the heavens will see you the way God saw you to begin with [Applause] praise the Lord preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about you're the property of God and he has a right to redeem you he has a right to unclothe you from what you've been clothed and put on you now I know some of you I know some of you spent a long time in the world I'm closing I know some of you spent I know some of you spent your time and some of the situations you're in let me say something to you I don't care how long I don't care how long the devil's had a hold of you he has no right to hold you God owns you God owns you and has a right to call for you to come out of that grave and to change the robe that you're wearing you know something something come to my attention here just a few days ago I was down at my dad's and we we grew up we grew up there in Arkansas and most of our surveying down there pretty sorry I just have to be honest back in back in the 40s and the 50s you know they used a rock in a tree and you know it was a little bit matter of fact the the road that goes in front now where my dad it did it just twists like this they ain't a straight road there you know all the property lines are straight but the roads go around because it cursed through one guy's property and back to another guy's he don't fall in the property lines you know so everything's just goofed up and him and him and his neighbor up there there was kind of an old man's land and they got in the fight when I was a little kid they got in a fight over the property in the front yard my dad he hauled a bunch of dirt and took a dozer and fixed it all and and that guy come off the hill one day after it got good and fixed you know he came off the hill and claimed it he said this this property is mine my dad said ain't your property you live in the city this is in the county get get back where you come from he got pretty rough you know we weren't Christian people and we it got rough out there and it went to fist fights and then troubles and and people got hurt and one day I asked my dad I said Dad I said yeah I've never seen you fight with nobody I've never seen you fight like this with anybody I said what in the world is going on that land matters to you that much he said Son he said if I met that man out on the street somewhere I'd have some words to get away from him he said we was out here and and he come up to me in the in the gas station I could walk off and leave him I didn't get a fight with him he said but he come to my front door he said how far do you want me to run I can't run no further he's got me in a corner he said I gotta fight he said if a man won't fight for what belongs to him he ain't no man in him I said I got you I understand that's that's good so after a little while that fight went away and my dad buys a property next to him another lot and that it's it's a nice little lot there but when they built the house on the lot they built a road right in front of the house the house was setting on that guy's property but because the road was built there it was an easement and as long as the house was there they couldn't do nothing about it so when the people that owned the house passed away my dad made an offer to buy it and the night he bought it the guy burns the house down so he now has that piece of property by law he he contains that piece of property and it cut my dad off from the road so uh here a while back and then back this spring my sister she bought her a trailer she wanted to sit on that property well she comes down my dad's driveway sets the property up but soon she sets the trailer Here Comes the Sun to the guy I mean it's a family tradition here comes the son to the guy and he says he says you can't do that and you can't be here and they put a fence up man it was well it was Katie bar in the door try to cut him off from water and ready to fight and everything else well my nephew's a state policeman so when he showed up there to say What's Happening Here everything started calming down a little bit more you know so so I heard about him all the way in Ohio and so I I I called my parents and talked to them and I come down well if you come to my dad's house when you come off the main street it's a it's a hill you come off the main street you think you'd just come straight to his house you know but you got to go around this corner and then you come down to this house so his driveway literally curves just like that well in the curve of the driveway is a big old shop building belongs to that same guy so I got a plan of the whole area because I used to survey years ago so I said we're going to fix this final if if one property line matters all the property lines matters let's just figure out what's what so I'm looking at a plant and when you look down on that plant that guy has built his shop right in the middle of my dad's driveway and I'm like this guy that's so worried about that property line has a shop setting in your driveway in the property lines literally I said dad get you a lawyer make the man move the thing and put these property lines back and let's end this fight for sure he said son I went to a lawyer the other day and asked him about that very thing he said they can't do nothing about it I said what he said yep it's been there over 20 years he said in the state of Arkansas seven years is a squatter's right uncontested it belongs to the man now seven years uncontested it I mean thing we can do about it I said nothing he said nothing I said dear Lord squatters rights and I got to think about that I thought you know brother remember said the devil was a squatter that's when you take true that's when you take trespassing too far it's one thing to walk across the man's grounds another thing say it's yours and Satan is trying to not cross your life he's trying to claim your life but brother Bradham said but by scripture there is no squatter right so there's no legal time no matter how long the devil has been plaguing you there's no time limit that says that he can stay so brother bam says Satan first of all you're a squatter remember he says you're a squatter he said then the church has a right to enforce the legal claim upon what God has given now I'm not often in a left field somewhere another man said restoration of Bright Tree when the Sun rises he said it forces the claim of life upon the seed and makes it return back no matter how long the Winter's been when the light begins to shine the flowers come out and brother mam said and Satan is a squatter in your life and has no right to stay there do you know if you've been sick even for a long time Satan is a squatter and all you have to do is notify him that he has no right to stay here and you have a right to enforce that rule upon him tonight for salvation or for healing for your body amen maybe a spirit's been plaguing you for years and Satan's saying to you you're always going to be nervous you're always going to be anxious you're always going to be depressed you're always going to have this sickness you're always going to have this trouble I've been here for 10 years and you can't make me leave he's a liar and he's a squatter on the property of almighty God he's a squatter church he said preacher what are you saying I'm saying the Bible said a woman had an issue of blood 12 years y'all ever wonder why it numbers the years but when she touched Jesus it was over if our musicians could come there was a man laid by a pool of Bethesda 38 years preacher what are you saying I'm saying he had a condition it wasn't killing him can I can I make it spiritual a besetting sin something crippled you up 30. eight years [Music] but Jesus came Jesus came by 38 years was over yeah do you ever wonder why God let congressmen up Shaw go 66 years 66 years and in one meeting the man walked right God's proven to this bride there's no time limit on your healing there's no time limit you see I've been suffering with this problem a long time brother Wayne I don't care how long it's been Satan's a squatter and he has no right it's Sunday it's Sunday it's Sunday again the resurrection has came he didn't just raise him he took the gray clothes off of them 38 years did you ever notice that Georgie Carter was nine years and some odd months nine years by the way the first time I realized why she was in that condition it broke my heart y'all know why Georgie Carter was laying there nine years her uncle was taking her to a piano lessons and raped her and it put tuberculosis in her body she wasn't laying there for her own account somebody did that to her but God said no matter what somebody done to you no matter why you're in the condition you're in even at Mid nine years and a prophet came by under vision and said thus saith the Lord rise and the woman got up and walked nine years I told this testimony down to brother Tim's meetings in the fall but last year you know brother you know Brother David Cross and Heather cross from Josh Bennett's brother Davids the cross Brothers to him and yeah every church has got his cross right Brother David and sister Heather anybody anybody know Heather no she suffered with arthritis about 15 years she it was bad enough me and her talked about it a couple years before before that meeting last year on the Saturday night they brought her in Joe Joe Adams actually said I feel led tonight sister Heather that you would come in this prayer line they brought her in the prayer line and when they did good spirit of God moved in there and after 15 years she was instantly healed in that meeting free after 15 years you know the devil's told some of y'all that it's been too long but things been it's been there too long that's the problem you know what I mean the problem's been we can't talk it out no more you know the issue is too big brother Wayne you just don't understand you don't understand the God I'm serving you don't understand what's causing the problem as a spirit and that demon has went from trespassing to squatting and he said it belongs to him but he's a liar and all you need to do tonight is to notify that devil you have no right in this place anymore you can notify that Spirit tonight you can't stay here I'm serving you papers Satan yes amen I'm serving papers any of y'all go through coven any y'all you can play Amazing Grace if you want to just real Softly I went through covet got this brain fog

know some people think that we as preachers pastors ever how you want to say it that we you know I'm gonna call Brother Wayne because I like him or because no yeah we do get suggestions but what I tell you you ask every Minister that's come to my this church in the past year and a half what do I tell them I tell them thank you for helping my people right thank you for helping my people because we labor in a different way as a pastor and as assistant pastor we labor in a certain way but then we we have brothers as a five-fold Ministry that'll touch your heart like I can't touch it touch your heart like brother Dale can't touch you we can touch your heart like brother Wayne can't touch that's why you need a five-fold Ministry and and we we enjoy bringing ministers in but it's not just we don't flip a coin we don't just we just don't you know go through a list and say well I'll bring no we know the background of our brother and I knew we needed we needed him at the end of this year I knew we needed I called him a long time ago and he said yeah I'll be there and I was pleased that he would come and all the other ones we've had and all the ones coming up brother they're award different ones it's not just that we don't do it frivolously brother Dutch coming with a wonderful wife and always been just an absolute solid I mean I love solid people I lived under one for 60 years my dad you know so I said and not wish you wash in going off on this Doctrine and off on that Doctrine well somebody say amen amen amen solid so then we bring solid people in here we bring people that can preach the word of God and they can what what brother what brother Branham say he said all a preacher does is breaks the scale that the devil has put on your eyes out there and you come in here and you say God I got I'm alive but I'm going to own grave clothes I can't praise you I can't dance because I bet you Lazarus was trying to say thank you Jesus and he was going and Jesus said listen get him out of them grave clothes well he don't need them no more and that's why we're we don't need this year anymore we don't need whatever was binding you I hope and pray that it got loose tonight if it didn't get loose tonight get it tomorrow night get it the next night you pray in your own way you say I didn't feel anything you're dead [Laughter] you're dead you need the Holy Ghost if you didn't feel something tonight you said we don't go by feelings no but it feels good when we do hey man feels good when we do I still believe in that you know we all have once in a while we ought to

to his house there you go and come into all of our houses tonight yeah okay this is mine and brother Dale's testimony sorry the Lord Jesus the name of this testimony is the Lord Jesus Christ came to our house November the 22nd 2022. brother Dale felt bad that and horrible cough on Monday November the 21st I called his primary doctor he couldn't see him so he had to see a PA that was Tuesday November the 22nd I was able to give him a bath and get his clothes on to go to the doctor we set up we were sitting on the couch and I was reaching down to put on his shoes and he fell off the couch sled off the couch into the floor I couldn't get him up Lisa come and helped me tried to help me get him up everybody else was gone so we couldn't get him up so Lisa come in and she said I'm going to call the paramedics to help us so she went outside to wait on the paramedics so brother Dale was still on the floor and I stood over him and I said Lord said we've got to get him up out of this floor well the next thing I knew I was standing over and he was about let six feet away laying on the floor and when I got to myself he was sitting on the bed six foot away out of the floor and I was standing beside of him well I did not know when I I did not walk over there he did not walk over there to the bed so the Lord had to come to our house that day amen and when you when you've went through a vision like this you'll never be the same person so the next thing that I knew that he was sitting on the bed and I was standing beside of him I don't remember any of that he doesn't remember any any of that the guy God had to move on me too because I was over there with him and I did not walk over there I did not walk over there so when Lisa come in she said with a paramedic she said well Nanny how did you get him up out of the floor I said I didn't I don't know he was on the floor when she left about 10 minutes before when she got back with a paramedic he was sitting on the bed and I was standing beside of it they checked him and and said they would take him to ER but he'd probably catch more than what he already had so then um when he got to the doctor's office he had a high temperature that was why he was out of his head they gave him an antibiotic and the next day he went back and they called him and said they wanted a covet test we took him back for a cover test and it was positive so thank God he had a mild case that time this is the third time he's had it anyway thanks I want to thank him for visiting our house that day and we asked him that night I well did you know the paramedics come he did not know anything from that morning until late that night he did not know anything that went on he didn't know he went to the doctor he didn't know anything so I just praised it with a glorious name [Applause] it's a I guess we'll just start with brother Michael and praise God foreign thank you [Music] it seems like ages are gone when I first heard that preacher one Sunday say you gotta know that you know that you know know that you know that you know he said be sure of your destination do you know where you go on that day have you heard the word of

back locked and you know when something's locked you try to see if it's going to unlock it didn't but after about two minutes I was able to straighten up and I work that flight into New York got in my car drove the two-hour commute home went to bed and the next morning I couldn't move went to you know hospital and all that stuff they said I sprained my lower back and my neck the diagnosis is degenerative disc severe spinal stenosis and nerve impingement and for you those youngins or those who are not familiar with medical jargon I'll break it down for you nerve impingement is just as it

doing their thing unless us crazy people do our thing in here hey man the world thinks we're crazy we think they're crazy one of these days we're going to prove who's crazy yeah man let's take communion let somebody stand to their feet you know I a friend of mine brother Claude weisinger his his former Pastor brother Jess tramwell you've heard me telling I'll tell you for the visitors I asked him I said he said when do y'all take communion I said well we take communion the first Sunday of every month he said really he said he said brother Justin will we uh you know we we take communion when we feel like everybody's ready I said we'd never take communion hello somebody when we felt everybody was ready but you know what at this church we get ready because we know we're going to take communion the first Sunday of every month amen so we're gonna get ready for it and you know what it does it helps that month began so much better I believe let's give our brother one more good hand man he poured his heart out we're going to take communion here at midnight it's 12 o'clock Happy New Year if we're out here another year that's okay if we're not we're gonna have this same meeting on the other side hey man we went through a lot we've had a lot of troubles heartaches and trials but you know what we've had a lot of Victories hey man let's count the victories and forget the problems amen so let's continue now let's go to St John if you want to read with me and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas this carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had what like this the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and he's going back to God when are we going to realize we came from God and we're going back to God Amen the scripture speaks of him speaks of us as I know what the prophet told us thank God for Authority on what the scripture is saying all right Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand that he was come from God and he went to God he rises from suffering laid aside His Garment and took a towel I'm reading the let me go to Corinthians I'm reading the Paul tells us in second Corinthians I thought he was going to do some foot washing but not tonight you know Paul it took Paul um but there's always told us and I don't know if you thought of this or not but Paul was not in the upper room Paul was not there Matthew was there John was there nobody wrote about it like Paul did right because Paul had Clarity Paul knew what happened he knew why it was going to happen he was already born again when he wrote that so God just took him right back into the upper room and said for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do you in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament that was an Old Testament they were living under the Old Testament but he said this is a new testament in my blood not animal blood my blood we're fixing to make a new testament that's why the New Testament didn't start Matthew Martin Luke and John Jesus lived in the Old Testament John was the one to bring us to the what to the new introduced the Messiah and then when he was crucified there was a new testament so the book of Acts is what really starts the New Testament as we know it amen after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drinking in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death until he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself thank God he give us a place he said but let a man examine himself and so letting meat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily either drinketh damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body now who's the Lord's body he was standing there in flesh but who's the Lord's body now that's me and you if you eat and drink this unworldly you're you're you're hurting the body right not the body sitting on the throne up there you're hurting the body here amen unconfessed sin brother Brown said make a congregation bitterly fail for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep let's get this right let's get this right and we won't have as much sickness we have seen people healed pop we've seen people healed taking communion I mean healed of um uh high blood pressure and sugar diabetes just by taking communion and if you're ever at home I want to tell you one thing if you're ever at home and you and you miss communion and you want communion if God will give me strength and Grace I'll bring it to you and you can take it at your house because we did that for one brother and that's why he got healed amen come up speaking in tongues right taking communion but if you need it if you can't get here on Sunday of the service you just call me and I'll try my best through all my three or four jobs I'll try my best to get over there or we'll get somebody to give you communion amen don't want you to miss it yeah because it cleans us it cleans us up it gets us to remember what God's done for us and that like I said this part of the Year this is remembrance of what God's done for us the whole year he's let us live as my brother said man he just let us get be here he's let us not just be here but being the best message in the face of the Earth the best people the best people on Earth yes why would you want to be somewhere else my word for this calls me near weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned praise God with the world pulled apart separated from the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if a man hunger let him eat at home that you come out together into condemnation and Paul says the rest will I set an order in other words when I come back to you Corinthians I'm going to set some things in order straighten some things out because remember the reason he said that is because they were having a drunken party making it to the Lord's table and he said no don't do that if you need to eat you go eat at home you go drink at home we're taking communion all right so let's tarry for just a moment the prophet of God said Terry he said pray for your pastor pray for brother Dale pray for all the the Ministries around the country that's going and preaching the gospel and and you are the ones behind pushing them or actually pulling them you pulled on the gift tonight and you got exactly what you deserve amen amen you got what you deserve tonight and I appreciate that I thank God for a man of God that'll do that so let's tarry just for a few moments before we take communion thank you Lord I pray now it should be with us and the further men of this service father Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and blessed it your father Lord this has been made with holy hands it's not been made three weeks ago two months ago or even a day ago it was fresh made Lord my holy hands Lord only a very simple menu Lord of a simple recipe father but that's the way you wanted it to be simple now I pray Lord as we break this bread that will remember that your body was broken for us father just continue to bless us now continue to to be with our brother Lord as he continues on father and just be with each one in Jesus name amen I know a lot of you got to get back home I don't say

of them languages that's right it sure did I heard it in English did you not I heard it in English like brother Ram said he it wasn't it wasn't the speaking of the tongues and the Pentecost it was the hearing right right how do we hear each other these people in our own language that was three thousand if you'll look at the uh in the scripture you'll see they came from All Parts because it was it was a piece of Pentacles they wanted to eat they were hungry they went there for the religious part of it they won't have a party they wanted to eat but boy did they get a party amen God came down filled them with the Holy Ghost yes and how do we hear you know what's going to happen when we get over there brother Ebenezer you'll be speaking English because that's what I'm going to hear you in

right and we will never have to we'll never have to say what do you say we'll all be in harmony won't be hard of hearing that's right I heard brother Ron Spencer say that uh at the Christmas message he said you know what he said this United States of America is fiction to lose some of the best taxpayers I've ever had that's right the states is fixing to lose some of the best workers they've ever had he said the divorce courts will be no more right he said we won't need a police department right where we're going we don't need none of that the world can have every bit of that think about that though think of that as bride we're bright we don't need a divorce court you need a divorce court you need God first all right we don't need a divorce court we don't need a new liquor law right right amen we don't need a new well they raised the age to 21 so we can drink no I'm like what what somebody said one time said if I never drink I don't care if they take the limit to 16 12 or 45. that's right but you know what it's a law in the book but if you never do it what brother I'm saying you never did it in the first place right the liquor law doesn't even I don't can't even read it don't
