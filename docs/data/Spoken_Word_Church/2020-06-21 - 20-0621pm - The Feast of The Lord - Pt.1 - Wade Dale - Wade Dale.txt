you the one on the fishing trip with us that's not a fishing trip anymore we're going to just call it Father's Day fellowship it used to be that we fished a lot now I think we just fellowship and eat a lot so it's going to be now Father's Day trip do it well it's kind of like y'all it's the sisters the sisters day whatever y'all had up there was a laughing fit or whatever I heard it was so but thank brother sister Dale again for she went with y'all and daddy went with us so let's don't get that swapped up let's just keep it the way instantly but from way of announcements remember a new one here brother Terrence brought this to my attention at 9:30 in the morning I know we start our Sunday School classes at 9:45 but just kind of migrate to your Sunday School classes because some people are still sitting downstairs and when they do and we're in there yakking and talking from 9:30 to 9:45 they can't watch when we turn the tape on for for the preliminary service so just about 9:30 everybody kind of migrated away from the that middle room so that some can still watch because the monitor zone for you to watch watch the services so just be mindful of that and I know would not need to don't need to start till 9:45 I didn't say start Sunday school at 9:30 on decision you need to migrate away from that middle room about 9:30 go outside or go into Sunday School class and start praying a little bit maybe if you'll pray then it'll be you know so anyway also now remember coming up July the 4th will be two Saturdays from now and we will have brother Andrew Glover brother from up north he's not from West Virginia now he's from Virginia so he will be with us on Saturday at 11 o'clock it will be a youth service we're already getting some requests for coming so we may have a crowd but there's a white board on the refrigerator downstairs and it says if you can keep someone in your room in your home please put your name down okay now we will not be able listen we will not know brother Dale may in his house but brother Andrew staying with me him and his wife but let's try to keep this for the older for the younger kids what I'm saying is that don't try to fill up with a bunch of older people when we can accommodate the kids coming and staying with us so just write your name down if you can keep someone in your home during that Saturday night a place to stay and then we need someone else June you need to put another one down there to sign up to help prepare the food because we are going to feed the people after we get with the service and then we'll just have a time of fellowship for the youth then we'll have regular service on Sunday at 10:00 and at 2:00 and brother Andrew Glover will be doing both services so keep that in your prayers so all right god bless you good to be here we're gonna start a new journey we were we were all into Abraham and all into Ruth and into Esther and now we're going to start with the children of Israel on the Feast of the Lord that's the name of it isn't it wasn't the Feast of Israel God never called it the Feast of Israel I read the scripture in just a few minutes he says those are my feast they're my feast they're not yours they're mine because he's going to bring in looks like brother Dale saying we didn't call on God and God called on us so he called these people to this feast showing representing that God calls us to a feast all right and then they kept the feast days in the Old Testament we don't keep those feast days because we know that when Jesus Christ came he gave us a rest but we still can walk through all of the seven feasts and we're not going to do them to get them today but I have more sheets if anybody wants any these are these are the cheat sheets they've got all my notes on them because I messed up and give all my stuff out and but I had to make notes so I had some notes on it so if anybody else needs a copy you can have one but we're gonna go through the feast days all seven today real quick just tell you what's going on and then we will take each day because man you can just keep going and going and going and and and digging into the Word of God because this eternal Word of God is eternal man so let's go to the Lord in prayer just before we get before we get started the Heavenly Father thank you for this day that you give us we pray that you would sanctify our lips Lord to speak and sanctify our ears to hear father because without you Lord as the active participant in the service it's just a meeting of people Lord and we'll go home and say oh boy that was good sounded good and felt good but what about tomorrow Monday when all the Devils in Hell try to come against us what are we gonna do then Lord you told us you gave us the shield of the word father and that word is coming forth today Lord to help each and every one of us to live a better life and to keep growing in grace and knowledge to the statue of a perfect man father forgive us of our sins bless this day take care of each and every one of us Lord keep us healthy and keep us alive and well father we pray that you'd be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father and bless the ones that are watching in Lourdes some of the ones Lord that are at home sick we pray that you just bless them Lord the older ones we pray that you give them supernatural strength father you ask these blessings in the name of Jesus Christ amen so these are going to be the Feast of the Lord but before we read this I forgot to read our important scripture in 1st Corinthians 10 that says now all these things happen to them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come because today when we read this this is God talking to the children of Israel but you and I are not the natural children of Israel were the spiritual children of Israel all right we are sons and daughters of God we are Gentiles the Gentiles didn't come to this feast it was for the Jews only all right so if you're born again today then you will be able to see these feasts in your life you better be able to see them in your life okay so that's why I say it's the journey of a believer if you're a believer today you'll see that when we start and talk about Passover you know what happened you know what happened in the unleavened bread and the firstfruits and all the different ones that we're fixing to go through but watch what it says in Leviticus 23 because that's what we're going to stay on if you want to keep those and make notes on your paper that'll be wonderful and the Lord capital lor D that's Jehovah God all right that's the man talked to Moses says speaking to the children of Israel and say unto them concerning the Feast of the Lord not the Feast of Israel the Feast of the Lord because he's calling them to his feast today you were called to a feast all right speaking to the children of Israel saying to them concerning the feast of the Lord which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations and we'll get into that word in a minute even these are my feast so he said it twice these are my feast but now watch we'll read the scripture again but I'm gonna read it when you sit down six days or you can stand up you can't it won't go to sleep standing up six days shall work be done but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest on holy convocation you shall do no work there Ian it is the Sabbath of the capital L Ord in all your dwellings these are the Feast of the Lord now that's the third time he said these are the Feast of the Lord not the Feast of Israel these are the Feast of the Lord even holy convocations which ye shall proclaim in their seasons you may be seated in the Lord as blessing to the reading his word now these things were given for Israel to do they were something they were required to do because and we we know one thing's for sure that that in the Old Testament that God went with Moses he went with the different prophets in the Old Testament and don't be scared when you hear that that we believe God sent a prophet in the end time because God sent prophets all the way from Moses Abraham Moses all the way down and and it's just not so it's hard for people to to fathom maybe but it's all in the Bible God had to speak through these prophets to tell us and correct us and put us on the right path because man us we people got off the track amen I mean how can God be so confused and have like 10,000 different denominations how can that happen you tell me how that ten thousand different people look at the Bible and in 9999 of them believe in in three God our believing a Trinity there is no such thing as trended even in the Bible that word was developed by man Louise did an outstanding job Wednesday night bringing that out I don't want to serve three guards I want to serve one because it's really easy to serve one when you got two or three running around you got to go find them I'm just being funny but that's not the way it is what was the first commandment we're talking about Israel what was the first commandment everybody believes in the Ten Commandments what's the first commandment behold o Israel the Lord thy God is three Oh what do you think huh what wine Jesus stand up stunning no not standing on earth he said if you've seen me you've seen the father now he's lying if there was another person somewhere else if you've seen me and he looked at him and he said I and my father or two oh three one there's just different offices of that same God in this Jehovah God that we see he was in spirit form and he moved across to the people his brother Lewis was bringing out so wonderful Wednesday night the Spirit of God moved across the face of the earth one God and he only had one name and Jesus Christ is that name God's not a name Jehovah is not a name sorry Rose of Sharon's not a name lily of the valleys not a name there's only one name and the Bible tells us the whole heaven and earth name is Jesus Christ amen Jesus Christ is what we were talking about that God came down in human flesh that same God just spoke they they even knew remember the writers they even knew in the New Testament they they said thou art the Christ the creator and there stood Jesus in human flesh but he was fulfilling John 1 verse 14 that said in the beginning was the whereas with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh so if he was the creator word in the beginning he came down and had to come into human flesh to save me in you this is the only reason a religion that our God is required to die you say God can't die no he can't die but in the forms that he took down here on earth he did that body of Jesus died but his soul was Almighty God or he was another person and then you've got two people talking to each other but anyway but Israel we only got one and that one God is talking to them and telling them that you've got these days that I have set up these feast days and if you want to go ahead and look on your sheet there we see that the Hebrew lexicon tells us that feast is melodic more what a that's how you pronounce it in that in the Hebrew but it's an appointed place an appointed time our meeting appointed time appointed time general a sacred season now that's what we're going to hone in on today as a sacred season and a set feast now listen let me tell you how accurate these feasts are they always started at an event they didn't just pop up one day and said let's have a thief no God said kill the lamb Passover unleavened bread one day after that it goes for so many days then you got what firstfruits do you know we're gonna get into this do you know that it's wonderful that Christ was the first fruit of the resurrection and do you know that no one in Israel think about this no one in Israel could eat one bite of that field I'll read it later no one eat a bite of that food until the high priest waived the first fruit over the people you're not going to get it without a fivefold ministry and we're not going to get it right unless God sent a prophet to make it right according to mouth count for he said I'll send you you not us you eat Elijah the Prophet before the Great and dreadful day of the Lord you said well that could be John the Baptist Noah couldn't Malachi 3 is John the Baptist he was one that told his people he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness and that's exactly my own country not Malachi 4 and when we get into these feast days towards the end of it we're going to re-preach the five cups of Elijah because it's kind of strange that even Israel to this date have five cups for Elijah and we have five comings of Elijah which we believe was Elijah Elijah John the Baptist William Branham and there's one more to come and there he's the one that's going to Israel to draw out the 144,000 according to the Bible's that writes amen all right that was weeks amen you believe it you want to say it thank you so now let's look at the sacred season a set feast an appointed season an appointed meeting it's an appointed place the Hebrew letter can tells us that a convocation is a calling together a sacred assembly do you know if they even remember the man in the Bible that was picking up sticks on the Sabbath day and they stoned him you didn't do anything on the Sabbath but now let's get this clear now let's start reading go to your go to your page here now the first page where it says Leviticus 23 this one kind of sums everything up because what happens is is now a Sabbath is not part of the feast days now we're going to have to draw a calendar and we'll get into all that stuff but a Sabbath is not a feast day it's the holy convocation you do no servile work you do not work that is on Saturday everybody got that Sabbath is not Sunday we worship on Sunday I'm trying to be slow so everybody in here some people say I start too fast and I'm gonna slow down a little bit so the slower ones can hear understand and I just lost my train of thought what was I thought see if I go slow I can't do that but I thank you brother Bob I was getting back to him so the Sabbath day was the seventh day of the week they had Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday did I miss one what's the first day of the week Sunday's the first day of the week money's not the first day of the week Sunday the first day look at the calendar you got a phone look at it sunday is the first day of the week Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday was the seventh day so the Sabbath to Israel was on that seventh day we worship on the eighth day are the three the first day because of what resurrection listen we as Christians should not have one day called Easter we commemorate the resurrection every week every Sunday we commemorate that Christ raised from the dead and that you and I are recipient of that resurrection slow down but listen let's watch this in Leviticus 23 verse 1 you pull it you look on your chart or look on your paper the Lord spake unto Moses saying speaking of the children of Israel and say to them concerning the Feast of the Lord which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my feast 6 days shall work be done but on the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest now this is totally separate from the seventh feast days everybody got that say Amen this is God is setting up a rest day because what's gonna happen is it's kind of real strange that the Sabbath day the day after Jesus were crucified was I they call it a High Holy Day the Passover fellow on a Sabbath that's why they had to get him off the cross before 6 o'clock oh you say 6 o'clock Israel's we've been let's do this before Israel's day begins 6 o'clock in the afternoon until the next day that's thick the hook in the afternoon everybody got that because you know where they get that from some of you know that when the curtain days of creation what did the Bible said the evening and the morning is the first day the evening in the morning is the first day so Israel their day begins their Sabbath begins on our 6 o'clock Friday and goes until 6 o'clock Saturday afternoon so on this seventh day is a holy convocation you shall not work it's the Sabbath of the Lord now Cena watch this that continually goes all the time basically back then God set up this one day that you do nothing reflect worship whatever you want to do but you do not do any servile work service work serve Allah means service no service work all right it's to be done that has nothing to these feast days but sometimes these feast days would fall on our after or before that Sabbath so that Sabbath is your that is your marker or that is your your point because what we're going to look is we're going to read on through here and see that certain things happen right after a Sabbath you mark the Sabbath and then something happened after that all right everybody got that well you know what we call it Mundi but what happens our Sabbath week into Monday and we all have to you know Satan just piles back in on top of us and here we go again you know to down the rat race but I hope we get enough on Sunday and Wednesday to get us through this thing all right these are the Feast of the Lord verse for six days show you work but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest a holy convocation you shall do no work therein is the Sabbath of the Lord and all your dwellings these are the feasts of the Lord even holy convocations which you shall proclaim in their seasons now let's go to verse 5 verse 5 we're gonna start with the Passover all right you should have that back there because all of us has got it here we don't we're on this one so y'all can watch that alright here we go okay on the fourteenth day now listen we got to establish a few things here real quick I just want you to think about this and then I'll me if I can find my chart that I did several years ago downstairs my little wheel chart when I was doing Daniels 70 weeks and we can find out what's going on but you just got to realize in your mind that their first day of their first month is not january 1st that's us okay israel's first day first month of the year is April or a bib or there's another word for it but we're gonna leave it at that for a minute in the 14th day of the first month and evening even evening is the Lord's Passover everybody got that same in on the 14th day now when we get into this I'm just gonna give you a a little bit of ten bit of information what happened on the first day of the month hmm no you put the lamb up you put the lamb up on the first day because God told Israel when we go back into Exodus when God told Israel said I'm coming through and I'm going to take your firstborn in other words the death angels coming you got to put up a lamb without blemish for 14 days so on the first day of April you're going to take your lamb and you're gonna put him up for 14 days make sure there's no blemish make sure there's no typing how Christ had no sin he took our sin he didn't have any sin he took our sin there was no broke bones you had to make sure the little lamb didn't have any broke bones and no bruises because that was the Lamb that they wanted at the time then on the 14th day you sacrificed it all right now on the 15th day of the same month now that was passed over for you those of you that's got my cheat sheet if you'll underline that that's number one Passover is number one all right so now on the fifteenth day of the same month we're in a bit now remember listen to me real quick April is the first day of the Jewish religious calendar everybody got that now if you go to if you go to an websites concerning Israel their civil calendar starts in October their civil calendar is different from their religious calendar listen we're going by the religious calendar because God said that's the day you do it because when we read the Passover God's gonna say this is exactly when you do this if I got that now I don't want this just to be a story put this in your life have you experienced to Passover what the dancing angel has passed over you if you hadn't then you're still dead miss Bexley I was the firstborn the best born sergeant the best one the first boy don't be giggling listen the first born like brother Brom said you know he's been story the little boy you know tug there's daddy's coat talents and you sure you got this thing right you got the blood over the doorpost and and we'll see how that symbolizes the cross go that went over the okay everybody got them you sure daddy you make sure you covered all that because I'm the firstborn in the fourteenth day of the first month that even as the Lord's Passover that's number one on the fifteenth day which is the next day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord seven days now this one lasts for seven days basically it's going to be an eight-day feast Passover then seven days for unleavened bread unto the Lord seven days you must eat unleavened bread how many of you when you take communion that is unleavened bread how many would y'all would like to eat that every day Monica I will raise my hand to but I like I like it but but most people like a little leaven in there it'd be hard to eat a cheeseburger with with unleavened bread so but what but what's it doing it's tell there's something it's a symbol and we'll get into that a little bit later I just want you to see the feast days today so we don't know not here so long seven days you must eat unleavened bread there's gonna be no leaven in your whole house get it out get rid of it get rid of all the problems in our house one two three Oh anyway we'll get into that speaking of the statue a perfect man see everybody says what the Passover I'm born again everything is fine you know that's great but God wants more God you just got the baby here God wants that baby to grow little Jesus and the cradle couldn't die for me he had to grow and the 14th day of the first month is the Lord's Passover right number two on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord seven days you must eat unleavened bread now watch we'll get into all this but that's number two in the first day you shall have a holy convocation you don't do any work on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread but you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord for seven days in the seventh day as a holy convocation so the first day in the seventh day you don't do anything no servile hour service work is to be done and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel saying to them when you be coming to the land which I give unto you know this is one of the feasts that's tied to harvest there's a few of them this time to harvest and I want you to think about harvest not harvesting beans and potatoes and carrots harvesting is like by yourself listen God is gonna reap a harvest and it's us because the children of Israel saying to them when you come into the land which I'll give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof watch this then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest now watch the first fruits that's the first thing that comes to maturity we have a field right now that's full of corn I got all kind of corn from knee high the way above head high the first fruits were the one that stands out the first fruit to me is the one that got the most nutrition the one that got the most a soul in light there's a lot of types here you're gonna have to dig them out yourself I can't get them all sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord look to be accepted for you on the morrow after the south after the Sabbath so there has to be a Sabbath and tomorrow after the Sabbath now what was the morrow after the Sabbath during Jesus's time remember Jesus was dead Sabbath day his body was physically dead Saturday what was the day after Saturday Sunday when did he rise when did the firstfruits come out of the ground look it's just a wonderful time and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord when Jesus Christ stepped out of that tomb and he said all power and heaven earth has been given unto me there was you preached there was your first fruits of the Resurrection and everything else behind him is depending on that resurrection so so the people look and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you my brother dev was talking this morning we were chosen listen you can be chosen by God the devil was chosen by God but you can't be chosen in Christ and not be Christ amen we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world so I put all of mine on him because it was accepted for me on the morrow after the Sabbath depreciate waybut and you shall offer that day when you wave the sheaf and he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord and the meat offering shall be two-tenths deal of fine flour mingled with oil and offering made by fire will get into all these symbols in a little while but I want you to see them all but watch this think of verse 14 you shall eat nothing you shall eat neither bread nor parts corn in our green ears until the self same day that you have brought an offering unto your God until you have come and received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and started living a life of Christ and start coming to church and listening to what's going on you ain't eating I'll just put that in plain English you ain't eatin oh you might be physically eating but all you're doing is helping this guy but when you spiritually eat you're required to wait until that first fruit comes forth and preaches you a message and then you receive from that message and what do you do you meet all right brought an offering unto your God it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations and all your dwellings so man is this not supposed to go away excuse me now watch this here's number four and you shall count in to you from tomorrow after the Sabbath now tomorrow after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering seven Sabbath's shall be complete now this is coming up to the feast of Pentecost Penta means what fifty all right so the feast of Pentecost you cease what is seven Sabbath's seven times seven is what all right but it's the day after the Sabbath is when you start that so it will be on the fiftieth day it kind of strange that the day of Pentecost 50 days after Jesus Jesus came out of the tomb on the feast of firstfruits they listened they were literally we're going to go through this Jesus was then Jesus went to church a little dizzy there Jesus went to church even the Bible says as the custom that he was used to he went his act but he would go to church he would show up on these Sabbath days and on these feast days he would show up he showed up on the feast of unleavened bread and he said I am the bread of life you don't need to eat that anymore come and partake of me Oh you either labored and heavy laden and I'll give you and you shall counter to you from the morrow after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering seven Sabbath's shall be complete so you complete forty-nine days and then on the fiftieth day even unto the morrow what is that the day after show you number fifty days now that's why they caught this is called the feast of weeks are the feast of Pentecost because it counts weeks you count seven weeks seven sevens is 49 days 49 days and then the morrow after the 7/7 Sabbath show you number fifty days and you shall offer a new meat offering unto the warden now watch this right here because like I said we're going back over this I'm just trying to stoke your mind so maybe you'll start thinking about it remember it's always been unleavened bread it's always been an affliction and sorrowing and and the Passover killing of the lamb and and all these things you know these we would say horrible things eating unleavened bread and all that but watch this this is where Israel couldn't understand when this all happened because we're fixing to put leaven into this now let me ask you a question what was the Feast of Pentecost they baked two loaves of two tents deal which is a measure all right they shall be a fine flour they shall be baking with now we take leaven that sin in the Bible right but when we look on the day of Pentecost what happened God came down into some unleavened bread and fill them and bake them 120 in the upper room that's the same way he's doing menu he's taking it putting himself inside of you yeah you're levy you got eleven yeah you got sin but you know what God decided this is the way it's gonna be so he put it right here now we'll get into all that but maybe it'll help you look you and they shall be bacon they gotta go through fire hot fire to bake these bread what is going on what what are we gonna do rise we're gonna rise and they are the firstfruits unto the Lord and you show off with the bread seven lambs without blemish will get like I said we'll get into all this later I'm just reading this so you can mark it on your paper of marketing your Bible so y'all for all these things have a burnt offering unto the Lord with their meat offering the drink offering even an offering made by fire of sweet savoring to the Lord then you shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offering and the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruit because what happened on the day of Pentecost because the baptism of the Holy Ghost God said I'm coming back in spirit form and I'm going to God not go on my people I'm going in my people I'm going in and I'm gonna make they're gonna be loaves of bread walking around well I know they're gonna have leaven you got what listen we're all sinners saved by grace maybe some of you're not and the priest shall wave them what was waived under that Pentecost 120 load Jesus's were waved to the people they said hey I'm starting something here but remember there's your four feast and they happened in the month of April May and June somewhere in there everybody got that that's four of them right Passover unleavened bread was the next day firstfruits was the Sabbath after the crop started coming in and your fourth is the day of Pentecost now the day of Pentecost it's when God came down like I said before and went into the people right and that was God that was Jesus produced Passover he was part of unleavened bread he was part of the firstfruits and he sure enough was part of the pentacle of Pentecost but then now we're going to have a long gap we're going to have two thousand years of a gap since Pentecost back in went a t30 there's been two thousand years that God has waited because the next three feast are in the fall and Jesus is not going to do those three feet oh yeah he's gonna be a part of them but he's not here to do him it's gonna be done through me and you the trumpet of the Lord shall sound in time shall be no more he shall proclaim on the self same day the priest shall wave the bread and on the South same day then it may be a holy convocation unto you she'll do no servile work therein it shall be a statute forever and all your dwellings throughout your generations and when you reap the harvest of your land thou shalt not make clean reddit's of the corners of thy field you know why because there's 144,000 it's going to have to get some of this food man don't clean your corners why because what does the corner that's what Ruth was doing Ruth was gleaning the corners it was made for it was made for the outsider it was made for the person that was still here neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of the harvest leave it get the stock get the good stuff cuz that's what I'm going to what harvest thou shalt lead them unto the poor and to the stranger I am the Lord your God and the Lord spake unto Moses saying now remember this was the first month through the second month into the fifty days of Pentecost everybody got that say man wake up right pray a little bit longer next time okay I like what brother brother um dartie he gets up and he puts him big old hands up I thought man I could just get under them wings sometimes like God raised them big old hands up so what's gonna happen is now we're going to the seventh month now you say oh the seventh month is January February March and oh you've already started wrong seven thank you it's October we know that but for the newer ones here April May June July what September October so this is a fall feast which has to do with some of harvest we'll get into the every one of these we're going to take each one but now we're in the seventh month we're in October our October in their seventh month in the first day of the month so you have a Sabbath a memorial of blowing of trumpets and holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein but you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord so there's what the Feast of Trumpets that's number five under the Feast of Trumpets what is the trumpet is they blowing now remember the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice and the trumpet god from your neck we're gonna hear it's a trumpet it's a message what does a trumpet do listen before there were cell phones when was that the kids were going wow no cell phones any of you remember not having a cell phone Adam you do not you might not have had one but your mom and daddy did but listen before communication all communication was by what you made a certain noise even in the Calvary you remember you watch some old movies they didn't John Wayne didn't pull out his Motorola and go we need to charge maybe wake you up a little bit but now what do you do he said sound the alarm charge and then they don't hear they go after the cowboys and Indians so you know running now you understand what I mean but there's a certain one for retreat there's a certain one for moving left there's a certain cuz you couldn't you can hear the what the voice of the trumpet the voice of the trumpet don't listen for [Music] listen for a voice because the trumpet tells you something the Bible tells it for trumpet makes an uncertain sound you go what what is that man talking about what is that person what do you mean yeah listen to the right trumpet and also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement now there's your there's number six day of atonement now remember watch this you shall afflict your souls it is a time that you do not kill anything but you make an atonement an offering made by fire an offering made by fire into the Lord because you're mourning not the fresh kill your morning what happened and Passover you watch the forum when we get into this the atonement you atone for your sin the priest makes an atonement sacrifice Jesus Christ made the atoning sacrifice but you're gonna but you gonna have to you gonna have to go with me because remember he's not here those feasts are done on that harvest time through a bride and this may be hard for a lot of you to understand but this world is being judged by the bride of Jesus Christ the Bible says that the Saints will judge the earth I've told you many times before you and I are the cause of a lot of things that are going on around here because when we leave you don't want to be here you don't want to be here because the mercy now the atonement is being made to this earth by the bride being here everybody got that because we're here God can't lay the plagues out he can't turn the devil loose on this world like he's gonna do when you and me leave out of this place amen so that don't make us special people but I'm special because he said I'm special amen I'm special because he said I'm special and then also on the tenth day of the seventh month that she made a man Toman it shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord and you shall do no work in that same day it looks like they never worked but they did get some work some look somewhere and you should do no work in that same day for it is a day of atonement and that's number six to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God for whatsoever now watch how important this is for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day he shall be cut off that's not the worst part read the next verse and whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day that same soul will I destroy from among his people you shall do no manner of work it shall be a statute forever I'm trying to read I'm trying thank you it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations and all your dwellings it shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest and you shall afflict your souls in the ninth day of the month that even from even to even that's what now does that mean evening to evening nobody got that for me evening to evening you shall flick your soul in the ninth day of the month that even even unto evening shall you celebrate your Sabbath and the Lord spake unto Moses saying though this is the last one same month in the fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord on the first day shall be a holy convocation you shall do no servile work there in seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire into the Lord on the eighth day now this is where brother Branham talks about the eighth day because let me give you a little background to some of the ones that are new the set of seven means complete right you got seven Church Ages you got seven messengers you got seven seals you got seven vials you got seven plagues you got seven lifts and seven 2007 the other all right so seven is a completion but remember in looking at your Bible the Millennium is still the seventh day seventh day is time if I got that seventh day is time the eighth day which there is no eighth day the Beatle thing about it it's kind of strange now that that the world picks up on religious things and then they throw it in a song the days of Aquarius over by the fifth dimension where'd that come from the fifth dimension hmm okay anyway but you see it that there was there is an eighth day but it's just the first day all over again oh we were showing downstairs in the Sunday School class there's your a door what is the sign of eternity it's an it's the number eight laid down but you have no you have no stopping place so if you're born again today you're in the eighth day your soul is in the eighth day you're born again how much more eternal can you get you're just working on this guy because he's still in the seventh day the holy convocation he's still in the seventh day because what is the Feast of Tabernacles this right here not the Feast of Tabernacles the Feast of this tabernacle because what happens is is they go and build him a booth and they go out there and sit in it for seven days you saw that didn't you dadandan when they were in Israel they saw they just put these little boost out in the yard and they go set in them well see what that will see what that symbolizes later on seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire in the Lord on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall offer an offering made by fire into the Lord let me get back to my point time runs all the way to where the Millennium is literally a thousand years of time but now when John saw this holy city coming down out of heaven the Bible says that God says time is no longer so time will blend into eternity there'll be no there'll be no time in the new home that we go to and listen folks we know one thing's for sure it's not up there this is where it's gonna be John saw the holy city coming down out of heaven and sitting on a mountain this is our witness Adam's earth before they saw the fallen this well we're going back to be restored back to that so on the eighth day should be a holy convocation into use y'all for an offering made by fire unto the Lord it is a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work therein these are the Feast of the Lord which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord a burnt offering a meat offering a sacrifice a drink offering everything upon his Day I'll just read it from here thank you besides the Sabbath of the Lord and besides your gifts and besides are your vows and besides all your freewill offerings which you give unto the Lord see this is a not just well this is all I gotta do and that's the way it is today a Christian was always gonna do come Church I read my daily devotion twice no he wants you to look at all that stuff he told you freewill offerings and all the things that you give to God it's a daily walk with the Lord so now let's finish this we'll finish it up also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month now this is the Feast of still of Tabernacles he's telling them what to do when you have gathered in the fruit of the land you shall keep a feast into the Lord seven days now this is tied to the harvest on the first day shall be a Sabbath and on the eighth day shall be a Sabbath and you shall take you on your first day the bowels of goodly trees branches of palm trees and the bowels of thick trees and willows of the brook hey where's Jonas where Jonas y'all built one of those up here at the cabin you built one of those you took boughs of trees there wasn't any palm trees I've ever take took every stick that was in the woods laying on the ground and made him a teepee right well brother Gary said three of them I think Luke was involved in all three right Luke was down there trying to saw a tree with a Leatherman little scratch knife and he's got a tree this big around he's going we're Oh Jonas did too I told him I said hey make me a toothpick but there this is what you got to do you got to bring that in and it looked good they did look good in their burger they did and I went a state under during rainstorm but they look alright and no matter of fact I couldn't have got under any of the three so a lot of me would he got wet like when we went camping one time with Aaron and he took this little bitty tent that was made for somebody like Jonas and he tried to sleep in it that was more of him outside than it was inside you got any sideways and your feet were still hanging out I'm not telling the story amen because we were trying to see if the Bears would grab ahold of us but when the bear grabbed ahold of his foot he had to be a real big bear to get him out of that thing so anyway now to wake up a little bit so they look and I love what this this types because what is Israel gonna do in the Millennium now you and I don't build houses but the Bible says that you'll build houses and you'll inhabit them telling Israel this is the time the type of the Millennium which is still the seventh day you've got to keep it in the seventh day and you shall take on the first day the bowels of goodly trees the branches the palm trees and the balance of thick trees and the Willows of the brook and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days and look they weren't they didn't put these little things in secret they put them out there where everybody could see it you put your life every day you put your tabernacle every day out there so that the world can see it so what are they looking at that's my question to you what are they looking at brothers and sisters what are they looking at this world is in a chaos they just need God and we're the only god they're gonna see if that's too strong for you just swallow and take it and you shall keep it a feast until the Lord seven days in the year shall be a statute forever in your generations you shall celebrate it in the seventh month now what is the seventh month it's harvest month you shall dwell in booths seven days all that are Israelites borne shall dwell in booth everybody that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt I am the Lord your God and Moses declared unto the children of Israel the Feast of the Lord so you got the Feast of what Passover unleavened bread firstfruits and Pentecost in the first part of the year then you have a long period of time before you have the other feast which are the Feast of Trumpets the Feast of Atonement and the Feast of Tabernacles and then the prophet of God tells us that you and I are feasting under the Feast of Tabernacles because it's God tabernacled in human flesh amen now we'll bring one more thing out keep these and I'm gonna leave these here if you don't want another one there's one more thing I want to go to them they don't have it but let's go to second let's go to Exodus 23 because there's one point I want to make before we leave and we'll get into this and this is really good but it's gonna be after we finish everything but I want to stoke your your get you kind of stirred up and say well what is that about because the God told them in chapter 23 of the book of Exodus chapter 14 there's three feast that the male's had to keep every year three feast every male had to keep three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days as I commanded thee in the I'm appointed of the month Abib which is April for in it thou camest out from Egypt and none shall appear before me empty now listen the whole underlying meaning is is the male's had to come to all three of these feasts so Jesus had to come to all three of these feast nobody got that same man so he had to go because he was a male child he had to go to these three feast which was unleavened bread let's just read it right here unleavened bread and their verse 16 is a feast of harvest which is the firstfruits he was the first one ever born like that hello I mean birds and birds do you know of okay the feast of harvest the first fruits of the labor which thou has sown in the field and the feast of ingathering which is the end of the year when thou has gathered in thy Labor's out of the field three times in the year all the males shall appear before the Lord now remember and I'll read it there's a key there it comes up again in second chronicles but we won't read that you can't come empty-handed you can't come to this feast males empty-handed you had to bring something to the feast gives you an opportunity to bring something see I want you to bring something to this feast that we're having you are the one these are the feast of the Lord but guess what where's the Lord inside you we as believers in the end time the journey of a believer is that God indwells his people now not that he just annoys people he indwells himself in us you and I the bride of Jesus Christ we go to every one of these feasts and hardly ever know it hardly ever know it but they're there in the Bible and we're gonna start through it next Sunday Lord willing and we'll take each one and show how it fit Israel how it fit the Lord Jesus when he was here and how it fits the Lord Jesus inside of you Passover I want to ask you a question today as has the Death Angel passed over you you got to take that atonement blood you got to take the killing of that lamb and you got to put that blood over your doorpost over your door post so that Satan can't enter in and that you come to a place to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost because what does the Bible tell us that the musicians go in come the Bible tells us in acts 2:38 it says repent sometimes we forget that repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because that's the only aim God ever had God's name's not father God's names not son God's names not Holy Ghost those are titles to a name there's only one name the Bible says that the whole family of God you know the family of Samuel way Dale the second to the family of Samuel Wade Dale knows he's a father he's my father literally my father right now I hope number one he's not gonna pass away but he's gotta write a will and that will says I Samuel Wade Dale gives to all his possessions to Sam your way down second but now what it but I want if it's a head I father or he writes me a hundred thousand mum would he writes me a hundred thousand dollar check and he signs it father what's the bank gonna do with that come on people let's talk about this for a man watch the Bible watch them what's the Bible what the people gonna do so - nothing zero ly why whose father hoochie daddy but I got him I got our daddy that's got a name oh I got a daddy he's got a name his name yeah we call him father we call him the son of God we call him the sweet Holy Ghost but he's only got one name and when Jesus stood up that day and he said repent go all the world preach the gospel bring good tidings and baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Father a name the son tonight as Holy goes to name what is the name what is the name of the Father what is the name of the son what is the name of the Holy Ghost Jesus said I'll send you another comforter and I'll send him in my name my name so what was Jesus telling them exactly what Peter told them on the day of Pentecost read your Bible accident at in the book of Acts acts 2:38 says repent we forget that part repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall what I promised receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for that promise isn't to you and your children and as many ER and I was as far off as you could get most of us were so he was talking to me as many as far off as me as the LORD thy God shall call so that's why the correct baptism is not father son Holy Ghost that was created by the Catholic Church hey man it's in the history look it up the Catholic Church decided today we're gonna use Father Son Holy Ghost for a baptism which that is not true like I said what family you getting baptized into ah Sam you're down ii give my possessions to joshua Rockdale and Han Elizabeth day sorry buddy you know what that takes funds and it directs them right to wear that name is so I want funds I want funds from my father to go directly to me cuz I did what he said alright let stand up we don't have to kitty son scare away BR away the new people we ought to be excited truth has come that's a baptism with promise it's a promise that you'll receive that fourth feast the Feast of Pentecost that baptism of the Holy Ghost not a day jesus said we're not in a day now well we're not in a day we're in a day of rest yes but remember the Bible talks about the day of the Lord it's not one 24-hour day this is the day of the Lord where the Lord is there is Liberty where the Lord is there is this day that we live in you and I have been caught up in Revelations for as John was caught up in that open door you and I had been caught up into something different than what the world gets that's why I took a profit to bring these things to us we Revere the Prophet as being one that brought us to Revelation but he's not God he was born a sinner just like me and you just like he lied you just like itll I should just like Jeremiah just like Isaiah we even talked about Paul well there had to be a prophet in the end time according to Malachi 4:2 straighten all these things up that man man had decided this is the way we're gonna do it but God didn't decide that because you know what I talked to a Mormon not too long well she used to work for me years ago they changed their Bible they changed it often kinda like a calendar they change it all the time this thing's never changed it never will change it is eternal the Bible tells us in Hebrews 13:8 is that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen god bless you will get into these will get into the Passover next next Sunday we just pray that the Lord will help us all like I said I'm gonna leave this right here in case anybody wants to take in with them and we will start we'll have a little calendar but remember these become rituals though to Israel they became just daddy yeah you gotta go to church today try to talk to Leo my kids like when I was to keep me in attendance with the kid my mom and daddy drugged us they drugged us they drugged us the church on Sunday and drugged us to church on Wednesday but I'm off drugs now and I come when I want a man right dad yeah you your mom and dad drugs you dude anything drug you everywhere now you offered him drug and you enjoy coming to church you enjoy coming to fellowship with people of like precious faith and man it's good to see a change in somebody's life especially young kids I I told Michael sitting around there out and out around the fire the other night singing we were singing gospel songs doesn't matter how it sounded I think it sounded good didn't you those act was playing the guitar Richard playing the bass and brother Aaron was planning to get time and we just sat around some of y'all missed a lot of good fellowship and we sang songs and the Lord just came among us and we just kept singing and kept singing kept singing to me that's fellowship that's a Father's Day fellowship but we can fellowship with that father every day we don't have to wait to a calendar day on the year see Israel had to wait to a calendar day on the year because this was there this was the way they were set up but when Jesus came he said hey I'm the bridge you need to eat now I'm the Passover lamb I'm the unleavened bread I'm all these different things amen but you know what they did Israel just kept on doing and they're still doing today trying to do Passover unleavened bread they still celebrate these things and there's different words for that but we'll talk about a little bit later on but god bless you we're going to like I said this is this is something that when we enter in it should be the same way we entered in entered in with the journey of Abram that you can say man that happened to me because the feast days how can you take them out of the Bible you can't take them out they were put there for our information for us to use and see how a natural people live by but it also became to them a ritual not a feast let's not let this that we have become a ritual and a half-two and I got to and you know it's like June's always said we we we know that what the Bible says about hair and dress about how woman should have long hair and not cut her hair and the women should not wear pants or garments according to to a man and June's of course students in law thought we brainwashed her I said no the Lord did amen so the things we did God is a sacrifice even even the men the things we do is a sacrifice very tiny sacrifice from when that man crawled up on that cross and died for me and you I told that girl the other day at the at the dentist office she was complaining because her preacher preached longer than 15 minutes oh my right y'all hope y'all know part of the story you know all of them but you know part of it my righteous indignation got up all right therefore I told her what I thought I pulled that thing out of my mouth I said lady that man that you say you worship hung for three hours on a cross nails in his hands he had a crown of thorns on his head he was beat to a pulp can't you stay 15 minutes and listen to somebody talk about that man she hate me if you want to sorry but there's a truth he had he hung three hours for me and you can't we sit for an hour hour and a half and listen to how that man saved your soul and how that you can continue to walk through this world and not have to worry about all these things and everybody else worries about God bless you let's sing a song we'll be all day that raised Jesus from the dead well in years Oh Alan you give the Sunni a spirit are they new Grainger [Music] by my spirit that dwells in you [Music] by the spirit that dwells in you she believes what you've already said yet city by your strife and spreading heal them to death and all these different people warning evil spirits and all the different things that were afflicting people left them so we pray that Jesus Christ and Lesley named additionals away from our sister Lord by the time she gets home she'll not even realize that she's healed we praise you blessed sister My lordy keep her strong and keep her safe you people let's follow in the name of Jesus we ask these ladies amen that dwells in here [Music] by his spirit that dwells in you if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead well here [Music] if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead well you believe that same spirit spirit like rounding here hey well quick nobody by the spirit that dwells in you and what a promise revelations 8 tells us if that same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead what do you mean same spirit brother that's exactly what the Bible says the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead that's what's living in you today it'll quicken your mortal body it'll make you do things crazy sometimes weeds handle by with a running fit lately but we just might you never know shout praise the Lord hey this is the quietest place you Christians are ever gonna see we're gonna be shouting on the hilltops we're gonna be shouting in the valleys listen it'd be a good shouting time if we got up in the morning and didn't hurt somewhere and the older people said hey man these young people don't know about this body change thing yet brother dartie hey what do you mean I told them the other day Leigha I told him I said the kids I said I have to get up in shifts let's get my feet on the ground and get my back straightened out and my arm get to hurtin my finger will lock up and get sore and not them the kids are going wow I hope we're gone before you get to experience that but you know what you do when your feet hit that floor ever devil in hell it's worried cuz you're a child of God and they can't touch you unless God lets them and allows them and brother Dale said this morning allow something to come on you for your benefit to guide you into what you need so god bless you mmm love you with the love of the Lord go with God have a safe a few days we'll be back brother Bob we'll be filling our bucket up again and these guys are doing a super job and we appreciate them we appreciate you yeah we just put hands together they're doing a really good job Tom short folks we either got to get in or get out leaves no playing around this thing is coming down to a close my look what's happening out in the world I mean who would have thought even a year ago that the world will be in a condition that's in now who would've thought even six months ago that the world in the condition is in now but nothing can happen without God protecting his bride nothing you think oh we're in trouble now we're not in trouble we're right where we're supposed to be we're right in that covenant that he said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you so god bless you let's bow our head Heavenly Father we pray that you touch us today Lord in all of our bodies Lord as we go out the door Lord may we feel a rejuvenation Lord from the word that we've heard today knowing that father several thousand years ago you told these people to do a certain thing and Lord they started doing it and then they they kind of got out of doing it because they thought it was a ritual father we pray Lord that no one in this building thinks that being a Christian has to be a ritual if something Lord as our as we talked about sister Jun Lord is telling their family what what what more can I do it's not what less can I do it's what more can I do for you Lord what greater things can we do with cutting out all the sin of the world and all the different things and the Bible tells us that if we look like the world and act like the world in the world's in us but if we look different and act different talk different then we know that there's a different spirit that same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead is dwelling in the hearts of individuals in the end time father go with us on the way home sanctifies for this journey we come back together on Wednesday Lord may we praise your great name thank you for all the things you've done thank you for things that you're gonna do father we pray Lord that you would just bless our pastor keep him strong and all the ministers in the building Lord the Deacons and elders the ones that have something to do with the church service Lord we pray that you just be with each one blessing musicians and the ones Lord that are sitting in the pews father we pray that you just as the wheels turn on the way home Lord that they'll be singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me father give us this day our daily bread forgive us of our sins in Jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed that's spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
