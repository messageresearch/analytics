[0:27] Sunday school lesson we just pray that
[0:29] you just come and help help us and Lord
[0:31] just bless our words and Lord just speak
[0:34] to each heart and each life those that
[0:35] are listening in Lord the ones that
[0:38] couldn't be here with us we just pray
[0:39] that you'll be with them also commit it
[0:42] to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[0:45] amen this
[0:48] morning I talk
[0:51] about a little bit about the time of
[0:54] year and uh looking at the the life of
[0:58] of Jesus and
[1:00] you know we understand this is not the
[1:04] the time that Jesus was born but we
[1:06] recognize this is the time that we
[1:09] recognize and we give thanks for the
[1:12] gift of God that came whatever time of
[1:15] the year we know the prophet said it was
[1:17] in in April but you know it should be
[1:20] that we we should be honoring and
[1:22] thanking God for that gift every single
[1:25] day and you know it it's it's kind of
[1:27] interesting you see people that you know
[1:30] um you know as brother Ram talked about
[1:33] there's a lot of people that they spend
[1:34] a lot of time and it becomes such a uh a
[1:37] worldly and uh it's more about a
[1:41] financial kind of uh holiday and
[1:44] celebration and and you know then other
[1:46] people they're they're always on the
[1:49] polar opposite of that and you know they
[1:52] they don't want to have anything to do
[1:53] with it and you know it's it's all Pagan
[1:57] and you know there there's there's no
[1:58] good there's no benefit in it and you
[2:00] know it's just like you know I can't
[2:01] believe anybody would have anything to
[2:03] do with any of it and you know but but
[2:06] you know like brother bam said you got
[2:07] to you got to look in the middle you
[2:10] know you you you got to you got to find
[2:12] that center point I mean because you can
[2:14] you can go either way too far but you
[2:16] got to find the right meaning and you
[2:19] that's that's the main thing about this
[2:20] time of year you know I I was talking to
[2:23] a a guy at work and um we were we were
[2:27] talking about um
[2:30] the holidays and we were talking about
[2:31] different things and you
[2:34] know the way the way I look at it we
[2:36] were we were talking about you know kids
[2:39] and you know raising kids and you know
[2:42] about the holidays and all kinds of
[2:44] these things and it and I said it's sad
[2:46] that people spend more time talking
[2:48] about Santa Claus and and all of these
[2:51] things than they do about
[2:53] Jesus and I said because the greatest
[2:55] gift that you're ever going to have the
[2:58] greatest gift that you're ever going to
[2:59] give your
[3:00] children is Sal is the Plan of Salvation
[3:04] to bring them to a knowledge of Jesus
[3:06] Christ it's not you know because
[3:09] everybody talks about um all of the the
[3:12] financial things and you know all the
[3:15] monetary things all that's going to pass
[3:18] away but the greatest gift that we've
[3:20] ever
[3:22] received has been Jesus Christ in our
[3:25] life he came and took on our took on
[3:31] flesh he C he came from
[3:35] glory and
[3:36] condescended to be like you and
[3:40] I and you know as
[3:44] as as brother R was talking one time you
[3:47] know you you look at this great uh
[3:50] expectation that the the great Scholars
[3:52] and the Pharisees and all had of what
[3:54] was going to take place but you know he
[3:58] came the way the word said was going to
[4:00] come he had a humble lowly
[4:04] birth he came like you and I did very
[4:08] humble and so he came to live the same
[4:11] kind of life to experience the same
[4:13] things that you and I
[4:15] experience and he and he stepped down
[4:17] into that to to be like you and I that
[4:20] we might be like
[4:21] him and you you see that you know when
[4:24] you have these your kids and you realize
[4:27] you know the free gift is a gift of
[4:30] Salvation Jesus Christ coming and living
[4:33] in you taking up residence in you but
[4:37] when he when he came and I was like
[4:39] that's the same thing about giving a
[4:40] gift and receiving a gift this time of
[4:44] year I always think about it's not what
[4:47] the gift is but in the spirit in which
[4:49] it's
[4:50] given somebody took the time to buy
[4:54] something for you whether it's little or
[4:57] not how no matter how big it is you know
[4:59] if somebody takes the time to think of
[5:02] you and take their hard-earned money and
[5:06] they go out and buy something for
[5:08] you you know I really I really honor
[5:11] that because you know that means
[5:13] something to me that somebody would do
[5:16] that and it and it's you know so it I I
[5:18] was telling the guy at work see that is
[5:21] the type of the time that in which we're
[5:23] living Christ came to take on our our
[5:27] sin he came and as just as the scripture
[5:30] said he had to be
[5:32] born to be just like us that that he
[5:36] might be able to die in our
[5:39] stead but you know you you see how but
[5:42] to understand the the time in which we
[5:44] live how how everybody misses these
[5:46] things and you know but to understand
[5:50] the scripture was spoke spoken of what
[5:52] was going to take
[5:54] place and you
[5:56] know we we we miss the the import
[5:59] importance of things and that's the
[6:01] reason why I I entitled this the
[6:04] key because many things are so locked up
[6:07] to people they're so bound they don't
[6:10] understand things but they don't realize
[6:13] that Jesus Christ is the key he's what
[6:16] will unlock these
[6:18] things because there's a lot of
[6:20] mysteries like just like in the days of
[6:22] Jesus when he came they didn't
[6:24] understand his his birth they didn't
[6:28] understand what he was fulfilling but he
[6:29] kept pointing them back to the scripture
[6:33] to tell them he said search the
[6:36] scriptures and them you think you have
[6:38] eternal life but they are they that
[6:39] testify of me he kept pointing them back
[6:41] to the word to tell them and you know
[6:46] the there in in
[6:49] Luke and Luke 4 you know when when Jesus
[6:53] comes into the
[6:54] temple that day you know he's speaking
[6:58] and he he goes to the priest and he
[7:01] takes the word takes the word of Isaiah
[7:04] and he walks up there and the priest
[7:06] hands him the scroll and he opens it up
[7:08] and he begins to
[7:10] read and so he says the spirit of the
[7:13] Lord is upon me because he hath anointed
[7:15] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[7:17] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[7:19] preach Deliverance to the captives and
[7:22] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[7:24] at Liberty them that are
[7:26] bruised so when he was reading about
[7:29] that he was telling them what he came to
[7:31] do he came to this this is what he came
[7:34] to do he's pointing them back to the
[7:36] scripture what the what the prophet had
[7:38] said and so here he is he's speaking
[7:40] because he came to bring those that were
[7:43] captive he bring to set them
[7:46] free here he come it come here's the
[7:49] Liberty that you have the freedom that
[7:52] you have is in Jesus
[7:54] Christ and so you have you have this
[7:57] Liberty and so you know because they
[8:00] they were
[8:02] bound as brother Bram talked about you
[8:05] know the the scripture uh we'll read it
[8:08] here in a minute but you know there in
[8:10] the scripture when Jesus was talking
[8:12] about he he told rebuke the lawyers and
[8:15] the FES he said because you won't go in
[8:19] and You Hinder them that would go
[8:22] in but they have the opportunity but you
[8:24] are holding them
[8:26] back and so here they are he's he's
[8:29] bringing this this message of Liberty
[8:32] and freedom and you know brother Bram
[8:34] says you know in in the message the
[8:37] patriarch Abraham he says how many of
[8:39] you feel bound feel the pressure of the
[8:42] enemy you know how how many you know
[8:45] because we all live under pressure we
[8:47] have all we all have struggles and
[8:50] problems and and all these things but
[8:52] you know we look at how all these things
[8:55] but see when you when you think about
[8:57] all these pressures and and you you you
[9:00] feel Bound by things and things hold you
[9:03] back but you know God God didn't come
[9:07] for us to live like this he came that
[9:10] that we might have Liberty and have
[9:12] freedom that we might walk in in the in
[9:15] the liberty of the word and to be
[9:19] free and you know you take you take the
[9:23] word as it as it comes and you know
[9:26] there in the in the
[9:27] scripture you know
[9:30] when when you look back at the the the
[9:32] Christmas story there and you
[9:35] know Gabriel comes to Zacharias and you
[9:38] know he's he's talking to him about
[9:42] having a
[9:43] son and you know and he's like well how
[9:46] can these things
[9:48] be but you know God still had a plan
[9:51] that was going to take place whether he
[9:53] believed it or not God was going to
[9:55] fulfill his
[9:56] word you know he said well you know what
[9:58] you're not going to be able to talk
[10:00] until your son's born but you know
[10:02] here's here's this little humble
[10:05] virgin receiving the same
[10:07] visitation and takes that word and says
[10:10] be it unto me according to Thy
[10:12] word you know she had she had that that
[10:17] belief you know brother says one of the
[10:19] keys that we
[10:21] have that unlocks these things is
[10:25] faith faith is the key to unlock these
[10:28] things
[10:30] and so if you have if you have faith to
[10:32] believe and and and you look at the
[10:34] testimony that she carried to
[10:38] Elizabeth no no no doubt she she was
[10:40] confused about all
[10:42] this who who else had ever had this
[10:45] experience take place but here come
[10:49] Mary and her faith come up there and
[10:51] told her listen the Fulfillment of
[10:54] Isaiah is
[10:56] coming the Messiah the gab Gabriel has
[10:59] come told me these
[11:02] things and here she was these six months
[11:05] without any any life of John moving or
[11:09] anything but you brother said all it
[11:12] took was her speaking that name of Jesus
[11:16] and he leaped in his mother's
[11:18] womb and that's all it takes this
[11:21] morning is the name of
[11:24] Jesus I think about that song I speak
[11:27] the name of Jesus over every situation
[11:31] every Power that comes against you I
[11:33] speak the name of
[11:34] Jesus because that's that's what would
[11:36] break every yoke every every bondage
[11:39] Every Chain every prison door that binds
[11:44] you it's faith in
[11:47] Jesus and when when we think about well
[11:50] we just think about a a baby in a Manger
[11:52] no no that was
[11:55] Deliverance just like just like when
[11:57] when amram and Joseph Ed was out praying
[12:01] for years and and praying for a
[12:03] deliverer in in Egypt they were God's
[12:06] people and they had a
[12:08] promise they and that promise was to
[12:11] them and they had to wait all those
[12:14] years but you know what it never changed
[12:16] their prayer it never changed their
[12:20] belief in what God was going to do for
[12:23] them and here and here a son was
[12:26] born under the penalty of
[12:29] death all those other young babies were
[12:33] killed but you know what God had his
[12:35] hand on Moses to bring forth a
[12:38] deliverer and you know what they acted
[12:40] in faith to carry and took care of that
[12:45] boy and sent him out in that little
[12:49] Ark but you know what he went but he
[12:51] went to the exact place that God wanted
[12:52] him to go to go through the things that
[12:55] he had to go through but you know what
[12:59] you know what their their their faith
[13:01] didn't change when Moses was born and
[13:04] they had to send him down the Nile they
[13:06] didn't change their because you know
[13:07] what he's the
[13:09] deliverer all those years because what
[13:12] happened the next thing you know we
[13:15] see Joseph bed has got Moses again and
[13:19] he's sitting on her lap and she's
[13:21] teaching him you're not the son of
[13:23] Pharaoh's daughter you're the
[13:27] deliverer you've got a calling of God on
[13:29] your
[13:31] life and it's like but you know he
[13:35] didn't he didn't stay in the plan of God
[13:37] and allow God to do the work he got to
[13:39] the point where he's like well I can do
[13:41] it in my own
[13:42] self but God wanted him to do it in the
[13:46] time frame because you know after he had
[13:49] went through all the great things of of
[13:50] Egypt and and reached such a high
[13:52] Pinnacle in his career and all the
[13:54] things that he had experienced then all
[13:56] of a sudden God had him on the backside
[13:58] of the desert herd and sheep and he
[14:00] thinks he's the lowest thing in the
[14:02] world in the
[14:03] world and he wouldn't amount to Hill of
[14:07] beans but what was it God said it took
[14:10] 40 years to put that in him it took 40
[14:12] years to get it out of him and he went
[14:15] through all of that and he got to the by
[14:17] going through all of that he got him to
[14:19] the place where God could use
[14:22] him and then God come to him and speak
[14:25] to him through a pillar of fire and
[14:27] speak to him and tell him listen
[14:30] now I want you to fulfill what you've
[14:34] always been what you've
[14:37] known now you didn't believe it you had
[14:41] your doubts you know it's like how how
[14:43] you going to be this great deliverer on
[14:44] the backside of a desert nobody knows
[14:46] you're
[14:49] there when you when you've had the
[14:50] greatest things you've experienced the
[14:52] greatest things in the
[14:53] world and it's like well I've reached
[14:55] the bottom but no God still had his hand
[14:59] on him to bring him to the place where
[15:01] God wanted to use him and it's like now
[15:05] and the first thing out of moses' mouth
[15:06] well well I I can't do this because I
[15:08] can't
[15:09] speak you know I gotta have I got you
[15:11] know I've got got my
[15:14] excuses but you know what God had
[15:16] answers for his
[15:19] excuses it's like listen who created a
[15:22] man's
[15:24] mouth it didn't change the fact that
[15:27] whatever whatever happened in your life
[15:29] gonna set you back if if God if God has
[15:31] called you to do something then you know
[15:33] what there's a path and a way for you to
[15:35] get there if God's called you to be a
[15:38] son and daughter of God and live in the
[15:40] freedom and the Liberty in which Christ
[15:42] is because if we're in Christ and we're
[15:45] we're a new creature we're a new
[15:47] creation then you know we can live in
[15:49] the liberty of the
[15:51] word and it's like well we feel Bound by
[15:53] things well you know
[15:55] what that he is here this
[15:57] morning for us to be
[16:00] free because the scripture tells us whom
[16:03] the son has set free is free indeed then
[16:07] if that if he has if he has set us free
[16:10] then we are
[16:11] free but many times the problem is is we
[16:14] lack the key that it takes to unlock
[16:17] these
[16:20] things see it it'll see brother says in
[16:24] the name of Jesus Christ see it's so
[16:27] powerful tonight and he said if we
[16:30] understood that see it ought to be among
[16:32] the people here tonight brother Ram said
[16:34] and he said ought what ought it to do to
[16:37] a sick man or a sick woman if the if the
[16:41] word is true and it's went
[16:43] forth then you can set you can be free
[16:46] from those things he's here the same
[16:49] yesterday today and forever if he's ever
[16:51] done it once then he's here to do it
[16:54] again
[16:57] says brother BR said Jesus is the door
[17:00] to all these things and faith is the key
[17:02] that unlocks the door now if Jesus is
[17:05] the door to all these promises of God
[17:07] faith in his finished work unlocks every
[17:10] door to every treasure there is inside
[17:13] the kingdom of God he said faith is the
[17:16] key that unlocks every promise he makes
[17:18] the key of Faith does not faith in his
[17:21] finished work it's these keys that we're
[17:24] speaking
[17:25] on when he's speaking of the key brother
[17:28] R says you know when you he says it was
[17:30] the
[17:31] key to the door that stopped the mouths
[17:34] of
[17:35] lions it unlocked the prison
[17:38] doors he said it quenched the violence
[17:41] of fire escaping the edge of the sword
[17:43] brought back the dead back to life again
[17:46] it was Faith the key of faith in the
[17:49] Living
[17:51] God he said that hand that man that
[17:54] woman who can take that key of Faith
[17:56] they can unlock every promise God made
[18:00] see the key is here he said any correct
[18:03] key has levers on the inside of the lock
[18:05] and it takes a certain form a certain
[18:07] shape of them keys to turn those levers
[18:10] and just one little lever out of the way
[18:12] will mess the whole thing
[18:15] up but so we have to follow
[18:18] exactly exactly the right
[18:21] way I was I've been I've been kind of
[18:23] looking at this for a little bit and I
[18:26] uh was went looking for a filing cabinet
[18:31] I want want a two drawer just a little
[18:33] one and so I looking for one that wasn't
[18:37] cost you an arm and a leg and uh so I
[18:40] I've went around some of these uh
[18:42] Liquidator places and you know
[18:44] secondhand stores and everything trying
[18:46] to find one well I found one and they
[18:50] had so I went to go look at it well by
[18:52] the time I got there they had already
[18:54] sold it but the lady said well I've got
[18:57] another one
[19:00] and because I I saw it and she saidwell
[19:02] I can't sell that one and I was likew
[19:05] why can't you sell it and she's likew
[19:06] because uh we don't have any keys to
[19:11] it
[19:12] and so I I you know we was looking
[19:16] around and I asked her I said well how
[19:17] much will you take for that
[19:19] one and I kept trying you know she was
[19:23] just w i i don't know so I you know
[19:26] finally I said well I mean really what
[19:29] what would you take for it and she said
[19:30] I'll give it to
[19:32] you she said well I can't sell it CU it
[19:35] ain't got any keys to
[19:37] it but you know I was talking to Richard
[19:41] yesterday so I took it I took it home I
[19:43] was like listen there's more than one
[19:44] way to skin a cat I mean I've I've I've
[19:48] had to drill out many locks in my
[19:49] lifetime people lose their keys or
[19:51] whatever and I've drill I've drilled out
[19:53] locks before and just put in a new lock
[19:56] with new keys but Richard went over
[19:58] looked at I showed it to him and he went
[20:00] over and took a picture of the lock and
[20:01] he looked it up he said well you can buy
[20:03] a key for it on
[20:07] Amazon you can you can get a but the the
[20:10] problem is is see when when people look
[20:12] at things they have they have it right
[20:14] in their mids but the problem is they
[20:15] say Well it it it doesn't do me any
[20:19] good but the problem is is they don't
[20:21] know what the key
[20:23] is the key to unlock
[20:25] it it was very simple
[20:29] but they miss that how many how many
[20:32] times is brother Brown all through the
[20:33] scripture we see so many people they
[20:35] miss the plan of God God right in their
[20:37] midst and here's God speaking to them
[20:40] and the problem is is they don't
[20:42] recognize what the key to their problem
[20:46] is you know brother Brown continues
[20:49] on and he was talking about and and the
[20:53] meetings and everything and he
[20:56] says when he's speaking of the the the
[20:59] meetings and all he says that's what I
[21:01] want to do to you you to do rather he's
[21:05] speaking he said it's prayer that I
[21:07] depend
[21:08] on and he's he's asked you know talking
[21:10] about people praying about the meetings
[21:12] and he said that's the secret of all the
[21:14] mysteries of God that's the key that
[21:17] opens the door to everything of God is
[21:20] prayer if you pray and
[21:23] believe when you pray then believe that
[21:26] you receive what you asked for and God
[21:29] will make it
[21:31] known he says see and the other one in
[21:35] in the message from the KE key to the
[21:37] door brother says therefore I believe in
[21:39] the Full Gospel every word of God that
[21:42] turns the power of God loose that turns
[21:45] his blessings to the people it's the key
[21:48] to the door that's unlocks
[21:52] it so what did Brother Brown tell tell
[21:55] us if you want to get closer to God what
[21:58] what did he say that you had to
[22:00] do read your Bible and
[22:03] pray so here's one quote where brother
[22:06] Bram says prayer is what's going to
[22:08] unlock these things but the other one he
[22:10] said every word of God man shall not
[22:13] live by bread alone but by every word
[22:16] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[22:19] and so we have today we have what we
[22:23] need but like brother brandom said
[22:25] there's many times we're too afraid to
[22:27] act on it we have what we have need
[22:30] of and so you see people come bound and
[22:34] you know they they're locked in certain
[22:36] situations and chains of circumstance or
[22:39] whatever and but you know what God has
[22:41] come
[22:42] here to make you
[22:44] free to free you from these things
[22:47] what's the greatest gift that you can
[22:49] have is eternal
[22:51] life and what comes with eternal life
[22:55] the blessings of God all the blessings
[22:59] that come that that are part of the of
[23:02] the the word of God that are blessings
[23:04] to
[23:05] you see all what what comes from having
[23:09] the
[23:10] word what comes from these
[23:14] things the gift of
[23:16] God the blessings of God the fruits of
[23:20] the
[23:21] spirit they belong to you you can you
[23:25] can have those
[23:29] I
[23:31] uh I want to share this I had a I don't
[23:36] I don't want to embarrass her but uh I
[23:38] had a I had a dream some just a few
[23:41] weeks ago and uh I was sitting there and
[23:46] I was on a train there was several of
[23:48] people from here in the church was on
[23:49] this train riding and I was sitting on a
[23:52] bench by
[23:53] myself and kayle Black come over there
[23:56] and my dream she come over sit down
[23:58] beside me
[23:58] and we got to talking well she gave me
[24:00] these stickers these little colorful
[24:02] stickers and everything had all these
[24:04] different things on it but we got
[24:05] talking and then she got up walked off
[24:07] well I got to looking through the
[24:09] through the stickers and I was as I was
[24:11] flipping through them you know it was
[24:13] like meekness and gentleness and
[24:17] longsuffering and peace and joy and I
[24:21] you know it just kept reading all these
[24:23] all these on these stickers had all
[24:24] these things and it was just like man
[24:26] that's that's what but when I got to the
[24:28] last one the last one was bigger that
[24:31] all the rest of them had a great big
[24:33] sticker it was great in big and boss
[24:37] gold emboss thing big fancy one and it
[24:40] had two words on it it said the
[24:43] substance and you know I I thought about
[24:46] that you know you see all of those peace
[24:49] and joy and longsuffering and meekness
[24:52] and
[24:54] gentleness and then you got virtue
[24:56] knowledge Temperance patience God
[24:59] but what is the one that that all that
[25:02] hinges on what's the most important
[25:05] one is have faith is the
[25:09] substance and if you have the substance
[25:12] this morning then you know what you can
[25:13] claim all the rest of
[25:15] them that's the main one is having that
[25:20] substance and it's a and it's a free
[25:22] gift this morning you know brother I'm
[25:24] talking about claiming your healing well
[25:27] the first thing you got to to do is
[25:28] believe it in your mental faculty you
[25:31] got to believe that God has healed you
[25:34] that the word speaks to you don't
[25:36] believe don't speak to anybody else by
[25:38] his stripes I'm
[25:40] Healed then then it's not anybody
[25:44] else that word is
[25:48] mine you know I when they took me to the
[25:51] when went to the hospital 26 months ago
[25:54] I went to the
[25:56] hospital I had a cardiac Ari me and I
[25:58] had had it for a while and nobody I had
[26:00] told anybody but I I just I just knew
[26:03] something was
[26:04] wrong and I when I went to the doctor
[26:07] because I couldn't I I just couldn't
[26:08] function anymore and I really thought I
[26:10] had a heart problem when they got me to
[26:13] Northeast Georgia they were checking me
[26:15] out and they like you don't have a heart
[26:17] problem they couldn't find anything
[26:19] wrong with me they run cholesterol
[26:21] everything they said the only problem
[26:23] that you got is your a1c's high you got
[26:25] high blood sugar which I didn't know
[26:28] that called cars cardiac arhythmia but I
[26:30] do
[26:31] now but you know when I went through all
[26:34] that and you know I told myself how long
[26:36] do I have to be on this
[26:38] medicine that's that's the one goal to
[26:40] get off the
[26:42] medicine you know because I don't I

[26:48] it you know what I mean I thank God for
[26:51] medicine I thank God for hospitals and
[26:52] doctors but you know what I got my faith
[26:55] in the great
[26:56] physician he's the one that carries you
[27:00] through because all they're going to do
[27:02] is give you a pill that's going to treat
[27:03] a symptom and they're going to give you
[27:05] another pill to treat another
[27:07] symptom but you know you know it's just
[27:09] like they put you on they put you on
[27:11] something for sugar it ain't long they
[27:13] got you on something for cholesterol the
[27:15] next one they got you a heart peel or
[27:17] blood pressure peel why because it
[27:19] starts messing with your
[27:21] body but I told him I was like listen I
[27:23] don't want to be on this thing and it's
[27:25] like well you know they they give you
[27:27] mixed signals like whether whether or
[27:29] not you can get off of this thing or
[27:32] not it's like well one of them said well
[27:35] you might be able to no well I don't
[27:37] know you may have to be on it for a
[27:38] while but you know what I I got the
[27:41] medical
[27:43] advice but I got one that's a divinely
[27:46] written medical advice that come from
[27:50] glory and it said I can be free of
[27:54] that and it's taken me 26 months and I
[27:58] knew one of the things I was going to
[27:59] have to do is I was going to have to
[28:00] learn how
[28:01] to control my
[28:05] appetite and you know what it's a it was
[28:07] a battle but you know what it's a battle
[28:10] that I won through Jesus
[28:13] Christ you know you struggle with things
[28:15] but the scripture told me I can do all
[28:18] things through Christ which
[28:20] strengtheneth
[28:21] me and I thank God that my A1C came down
[28:25] and I'm off the I'm off the medicine
[28:28] amen because God Is A
[28:32] Healer but he'll also bring you through
[28:35] the trials and and the battles that
[28:37] you've got to fight but you know what
[28:39] don't give
[28:41] up because he'll be right there with you
[28:44] when you're weak he is strong I'm so
[28:48] glad that I've got one to lean
[28:51] on and that's what I want you to know
[28:53] this morning Jesus Christ came as a free
[28:56] gift to you yes and all those Redemptive
[28:59] blessings belong to you in Christ Jesus
