woman I'm going test of that and all of you are that have that have wonderful Holy Ghost filled wives what a blessing man you sit down there you know just for a second settle everybody down just for a second uh you know you go to the airport like I said before you just got a a Melting Pot of junk everybody's got a tattoo everybody got an earring everybody's got a nose ring everybody's got a tongue ring one girl was standing there talking to somebody and just that on you got big old thing in what are people see they're marking their s yes they're marking their s the mark of the beast we know is on the inside but look at the marks that they're taking on the outside even even older people good grief older people what about the men that have the big old ring oh I know in their ears think about 30 years from now when your ears do get big and floppy and what's going happen well what I think is uh what what are you going to do when you get tired of that when you realize how stupid that is then you got big hole hanging down in your ear right you know God can look over that but it's always going to be there it's a mark yeah and and they just mark their body and that's what they're doing they're marking theirself for Destruction um some of those people don't have a clue and Deuteronomy somewhere I got got it marked in my Bible that don't put ink in your body so so it's scripturally wrong but you look and you say my Lord that group of people 20 years from now is going to be our doctors our lawyers our politicians our president and look at the mindset they have now and then take it 20 years from now that's why I hope we're not here 20 years from now tto 5 years from now 3 years from now I hope we get out of here sooner than that tattoos is in Leviticus I don't want them in power 19 lenus what 1928 lus 1928 talking about marking on your body but let's go and go into Revelations chapter 6 now we're on the second seal let's get our mind back together on what we're doing um second seal will be the this will be the third one third part so let's just kind of go over everything let's read it and then we'll go over what it is and then let's get into the Char characteristics of that seal all right chapter 6 verse excuse me verse three and when he had opened the second seal now I want you to look everybody's complaining or wondering whether the seals are open or not the Bible says they're open the Bible says they're open right the prophet of God said they're open Jesus said they were open because he preached six seals in in in the Book of Matthew so that's public domain that's something that is out there for you to see all right so let's don't uh like I said before I can't give you a revelation only God can do that that's right but you do have to hear it first right you do have to meditate on it you do have to study on it all right and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see now who's the second beast second beast is what the ox all right so it's the let's get in our mind that it's the ox this is the ox age Ox time it's that fourth Church age the Dark Ages all right sacrifice an ox is a burden Bearer an ox is a laborer all right so this church age was the longest Church age they labored for 1,500 years under Roman rule all right so it's the longest Church age and that it took that op to get them through it now what a cheetah can run faster than anything but it can only do it for a short distance right all right but an ox well who won the race the turtle of the hair right the turtle won because he was consistent same way with an ox an ox can work all day a cheetah might work for 10 minutes running 65 M hour but an ox and that's what happened that's I want you to get the spirit of that age the spirit of that age was sacrificed sacrificial burden bear and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse all right another what what power all right another power and what was that power it was a red horse power was given to him that sat thereon which is who Satan Superman right cuz remember the first church age or the first three Church ages and the first seal it was a spirit it was a saying it was a deed now it's becoming a Doctrine we're after NAA we're now where Rome home church and state comes together and the power of church and state is together in this fourth age and look what you got now I know most of you know the history but for some of you that don't Constantine was a Roman General Constantine was a Roman what you say a government official instead of he sees this religious order coming up and he sees all this political power he says man if I can get get these two together well see that's Satan M cuz we know that's not right now but they they got the religious power which had power of what listen to this the people religion all religion can't be a religion if there's no people that's right right that's right you can't have a an end time believer message without having what end time Believers that's right so he saw a group of people that had religious power they could sway the people but they had no money and we get into something here think think with me they had the spiritual power but no money Constantine saw the government of Rome being hated by the people see how Satan how but it would sound good if you were sitting in a in a meeting and saying hey we got all this money power but the people hate it us if we can make those two one we got this whole thing with so that's what happened Constantine brought Church power set them down he brought political power set them down and what they done was they put them together instead of building fine churches they took the I mean instead of building um you know all these buildings they just took the churches and done what what is the church what even even back in Luther Wesley and even up until about 100 years ago go the church was a central location it was the courthouse it was the Postmaster General it was all it was the schoolhouse the church served many purposes all right so what Constantine did he brought this and he brought this and he put them together and he said look you people got power of the people you people got power of the of the money put them together so what did they do they put them together and they said okay now it's the holy see it was Roman Empire holy church bring them together makes a Holy Roman Empire which it wasn't nothing holy about it okay but it came into the guise of a holy if we can bring something holy White Horse white righteous church still the devil had some good people in it really brother Bri said the bride went to n and got and got deceived why because they didn't have enough word to keep them brother Bown said they should have never went right and I believe some of the older ones didn't go I believe some of the newer ones maybe the little babies got caught up in it but you take that power and bring the Roman power make it a holy Roman church or Holy Roman Empire then you start taking down see the Roman Empire they believed in what gods and goddesses watch How It's come in the Roman Catholic Church Gods and Goddesses they put up their statues of of ashtor and and Cupid and um names the more Thor and Zeus and you know you can just name a whole bunch remember read back in history when we were sitting in school we were reading about all this that was going on not knowing that that had an implication to us in this end time right because they brother brand said they took down ashor and put up Peter took down Jupiter put up Paul took down this one and they didn't take it down they just said oh well now that's Peter now that's instead of ashtor now it's Easter asor eastor you ought to read read Hop's Two Babylons or get you some old Roman history and read how that and it was very subtle he brought the religious power in and the religious power said hey let's put these holy men up Pope Austine of Hippo pope then they said oh Peter was our first pope because see these people these holy people which they were holy people they said hey Peter was a great man Paul was a great man and these people said well we don't know who these people are we heard they were Heretics and whatever when you bring them together what does the Holy Roman Church do now they do the same thing they put up their statues of Mary and and uh St Christopher and and St Patrick and St so and so and right right and they pray to them right instead of praying to God M these people were praying to God these people were praying the gods right brought them together and said okay now okay you can have all you want but we're going to have a father Son and Holy Ghost three separate Gods then that they're like oh no no no no no but remember remember n see the whole program was was Jesus the substance of God or a like substance now making him a like substance made him another person like they're doing now same Roman Catholic spirit is in this message making Jesus a separate identity from God another person and then he became God see how Satan just rides right through the people and they just praise God and and and and say well boy that's exact L right well it's not it was the same thing they argued about in the fourth Church age whether Jesus was the same was the substance of God thank you are a like substance of God well they came up with a like substance why would they come up with a like substance so they could put up asor and Jupiter and say well these people are intercessors to Jesus because Jesus is an intercessor to God and Jesus is our intercessor but we know he's almighty God he don't have to turn around and talk to another person right he's the one we go to for everything all sufficient God Almighty in human flesh right and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that set there on to take from the earth that's exactly what they were doing take from the earth what look not the round ball of earth right here this guy if you got the people you got it all cuz you see and now you got political power in in our governmental system now we know America said to keep church and state separate but now in other places and coming and evolving the people were the politics and the politics got into into religion and religion got into politics and that's basically what you got now right and that's just going to get worse and worse because see like it started right it started that way it separated a little bit in the church ages but guess what it's going to do it's going to come right back down to that same holy man the Antichrist holy man standing and being the intercessor so everything you get you got to get it through this man but he's the Antichrist but he's going to be very religious he's going to be very powerful just like he was the first po all right keep those things in your mind because as we go along but look what to take s on him to take peace from the earth what happened was the people got so confused now don't get me wrong Born Again Christians can be confused that's right we're going to talk about that this afternoon just like we talked a couple weeks ago about about the the the form that we're talking in because we should be talking in a higher form than what the other the church ages are talking in because brother ran said out of the true seed will come a church out of the true seed let's just say right here we got 30 people sitting here all right let's just for an example I'm going to use myself out of all this true seed you're all going to heaven you're all born again Christian you're all doing the best you can but you can't get this guy out of the way peace can't come to this right here this Earth but peace can come to my Earth because I see what God's done for me okay so out of the true seed will come a seed not a different seed but out of that come out of her my people Brother Richard Wilson preached a message long time ago I never forget it the Bible says come out of her my people which we did we all came out of denomination but we got to come out of this message church we got to be a group separated out you say separated yes I didn't do I didn't say this the prophet said it he said out of the true seed will come a church that's right what who's going to take a body chain right these are going to die these are going to get a revelation and they're going to go up cuz somebody's got to come out of this that's right like I preached last weekend in U Oklahoma they who prophesy must die everybody that prophesies well you know what you're doing when you prophesy you're putting something to somebody else right if I prophesy and say sister Johnny uh you're going well what am I doing I'm taking the word of God and I'm giving it to her but what about me what about mean all those prophets that prophesied they died why they were looking for something to come right and unless we see something here that's been preaching it chosen in him if him is here let's stop I'll get into this afternoon sermon stop that would give you I just go do it for 30 minutes and then y'all sleep this afternoon but you see what I'm talking about to take peace from the earth we got to see that these seals is for the Redemption of the body this man right here has to be changed right being chosen in him we are changed inside that's right we're a new creation but this outside guy still lives in this earth this world right and only a small group is going to see it and that's okay all right let's go there power was given him that sat there on to take peace from the earth what did they do they started telling them listen to this they started telling them you're no good you can't get anywhere in your flesh you got to do Penance to the Catholic Church do away with your Bibles read the history read the history in that time of the fourth Church age they burnt Bibles they started preaching the gospel in Latin so nobody can understand it so they were saying you can't make it you are filthy you're dirty you believe in me though and I'll intercede for you cuz I'm the Holy One remember you get the wafer I drink the wine you get the body cuz your body is the one that needs the peace on Earth peace of the on the Earth takes PE takes peace from the earth so they took peace from the people believing that they were born again brother brandom said there was 68 million Christians killed during this Dark Age he said Untold billions spiritually this was natur that's why that horse is red cuz it rode through the blood of those Martyrs remember we'll read it next Sunday the cup of the Martyr was full of what blood remember the woman on the Scarlet horse was holding a cup full of blood Bible says which was the blood of the martyrs what right here in this Dark Age K 68 million why because see it's coming back around that old spirit is coming back around again to where you deny what you're that's what they did they brought them up to the Catholic church and said you either deny that one God that you believe that water baptism that you believe or we're going to kill you because it's better to kill you take peace from the earth it's better to kill you in other words and let us do whatever we can to to get you through purgatory and get you into heaven that it is for you to keep living and believing what you believe all right and that's exactly true sister Anna shaking her head she know the Catholic Church go back they killed 68 million Christians Born Again Believers 68 million people and then Untold billions in their Doctrine so they'd walk in and say Hey you believe one God yes we believe one God well now what about this Jesus was he God or was he like God or was he become God or and then they start what getting into people's mind yeah and they take took peace from the people why cuz now you got to come to that church to do your Penance you can't pray to God you got to pray to the Holy Roman Church who praise the God for you see it's taking power away from the people the power was in the people in the first three ages there was a white righteous church that rode through there and then there there is a red church this red blood what sanctification right we'll get a little ahead of ourselves and and that they should kill one another this man didn't do all the killing have you read that I just saw that last Sunday or two Sundays ago when I was reading this and that they should kill one another you would think that it would be the power in this Pope or in this man sitting on this horse that he would do the killing he's separating himself he's now saying I'm going to get them to believe it and let them do the killing cuz I'm one man but if I can get a 100 men to believe like me they can kill 100 people I can't kill but one they can kill 100 that 100 can kill another hundred you you see what I'm talking about just like a cancer all right see and they that they should kill one another what when you're talking it's not moving well it was a minute ago I don't know let thing how about now hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello the battery is gone you got another battery over there there might be some there I think a new one right there thank you for noticing now and not paying attention to what I saying guilty guilty I can say that to any of y'all the same not just her I'm not piing on her oh we know there we go thank you though all right it'll catch it on here anyway all right it'll go on there now but listen now that they should kill one another so what did they do a Doctrine went out you got you got sayings deed now it's a Doctrine boy when it becomes a Doctrine number one you got somebody to believe it that's right all right and when they believe that Doctrine guess what that becomes a part of them then what do they do they go try to give their Doctrine to somebody else right all right so that's what happened in this in this time that they should kill one another but see how it started though real innocent a saying a deed now it's said Doctrine brother Bown said law it's made a law so they made a law so now during this church age we got the O Spirit we're in the fourth Church age which is the Dark Ages they physically killed the people and spiritually killed the people now theyve taken peace and killed sword Doctrine so it's now a Doctrine you got a man remember they crowned a man in the first three ages they crowned a pope got him started then he began to what spew out his Doctrine his sword he had a sword then see Gabriel Michael had a sword the word of God right now you got an impostor standing there with a sword and we'll get into something a little bit later on that hold that thought but let's get let's finish this scripture and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword Now power was given I could be the most powerful man in the world but unless I got somebody to work with or through like brother randam said now watch he said you Pentecostals he said You' got the spirit right you got the spirit but you got no Doctrine in other words you got no word but you got the spirit right you fundamentals you've got the word but you don't have no spirit so you got word and spirit it he said it's like a man that's got a million dollars in the bank but he don't have no checks then you got me over there with zero in the bank and I got a stack of checks this High well you're not going to do it I can sit there and write checks all I want to but that million dollars is going to stay over here in this account but put the two together did you understand what I just said yes what did Satan do he took spiritual power and political power and put them together that's right you say oh that was wrong what does God do God takes the spirit and the word Len together so see Satan remember everything I'm telling you you remember God has already done something God's done the original Satan's doing something like that folks this is the whole if you don't get anything in this whole series get this one thing if you don't know the difference between God and the devil and the two works that they're doing you're deceived that's right now we we're I'm sure we're all deceived that's right because of this we live in a deception brother R said we live in delusion yes sir what a mirage right what does Satan do God comes over here you know for one thing for sure if God's moving you going to see what Satan does first cuz he's going to run out there and try to get ahead of God make a look better make it look prettier but remember one thing if this is already happening God has already started something right here right remember the prophet said he does it reveals it then makes it manifest he's already done it way over here does it reveals it makes it manifest now Satan he's done running he catches brother random read the other day no quot Claude was quoting to me the other day said brother random said that that God that Satan knows every time God is moving toward you remember he said if he said if I say I'm going to go do something pray for somebody he said the kids will start crying the phone will start ringing the car will tear up why Satan FS that same pull remember he is religious highly religious right let me put it one more way he's highly spiritual right yeah we say oh the devil's carnal he gives us all this car no he's highly spiritual but he leans it to the carnal that's right everybody understand that he's highly spiritual but he leans it to the carnal every time he wants to conquer this guy right here okay if you're already born again he can't get the inside so what does he want to do he want to kill the outside guy right okay so he does it reveals it makes it manifest all right so God's already started something by what taking the spirit and the word and put it together all right mechanics the word dynamics the Holy Spirit we can have Dynamics mechanics all day long which is this right here but if we don't have the spirit on that does no good it's just what dead letter Satan loves this let me hold this book up one more time Satan loves just this letters on a page but when that becomes here and he can't see this anymore he just sees this he sees the life live that's what scares him that's what scares say you quote Satan listen Satan was there when brother R said it the first time so guess what we can't find a secret book somewhere that Satan had read yet there's only one thing people that saves us from Satan taking over and that is that when you become born again you get a small portion of the mind of Christ that he can come down through there and he can talk to a little spot inside of you and get his word Quicken everybody understand that yes that's the only thing that saves us that's what saves us cuz Paul says we must have the mind of Christ if you have the mind of Christ then you have this all right cuz see they had they had uh in this well we already erased it the first three ages they didn't have a Bible they didn't have a quote book they were the Bible they were living it that's what's wrote about in the book of Acts it's the first three Church ages basically first one anyway first and second Church age you understand that but they didn't have a they didn't have a Revelations chap 6 to read in the first three ages even in the fourth age the fourth age of if you'll read read your church Agee book brother brandom said the spirit of that age was just to say you were a Christian and give your life walk right in willingly to the to the Lions and to the to the Dungeons and to the racks and to they pull them apart with with horses that was the willingness of that age cuz he didn't have any other word to to hold them but see you and I must look at this age and see that that's a part of us but not the whole part of us in this seventh Church age we get all the ages together because seven is completion right but we got to have the spirit of all those ages to get us out of here got to have it got to have the lion ox man and eagle and got to have it there in Ezekiel we're going to read maybe next Sunday we'll reading Ezekiel since we got two of the two of the animals out maybe next Sunday we'll read in Ezekiel just a little bit about those four combat beasts all right so now power was given unto him and he was given a great sword so what did he start doing he started preaching his gospel he started preaching his gospel and it it what did it do it killed 68 million physically killed them brother R said that's why that horse was blood red cuz he rode right through the blood of those martyred Saints I I started Ed reading Fox's book of Martyrs one time and I couldn't finish it the things that they did that's on record this is not just hears sa the Catholic Church admits to killing them they admit to doing this to people but you know what we're all Roman Catholics unless we have the true gospel you can be Baptist Methodist what what's the difference in a in a in a Baptist and a and a and a a um Roman Catholic just brother R said there's two things the water baptism and the uh taking of the communion well water baptism they father son Holy Ghost Roman Catholic father son Holy Ghost same one just maybe sprinkles and and the other one baptizes but that communion but brother brandham said in the end time they'll come together and the Protestants will accept why they going to accept Mama cuz she's going to bail us out look at the price of gold who holds all the gold of the world the Roman Catholic Church is getting richer while the whole world is getting poorer I'm not talking about just America Germany's in trouble France is in trouble look at all those people Ireland's in trouble all that European Union everybody is going to have to bow and then guess what then the United States is going to say hey we got enough power military power we'll be your second hand right-and guy you bail us out we'll police the world and that's your image to the Beast we are watching scripture fulfilled right before our eyes every day and the only people that's not blind are us right everybody I thought Lord when I saw those people you know going through the airport I thought Lord if they knew what was coming yeah they're just so blind they don't have a clue of what's coming not a clue all right let's go Lord bless you bless oh somebody have a question no no no question okay
