========================================

all right let's turn to Second Peter one and get back to where we were last Sunday in talking about the stature no statue statue is something that's solid and can't be moved this thing um God has always wanted to take out the Stony heart like he said in Ezekiel take the Stony heart and wine you can't take a stone once that Heart of Stone is set you can't do anything with it it's just there forever but if you take a heart of Flesh when he says I put a heart of Flesh in right see flesh is pliable so he can work with it Clay is pliable he can use it he can work with him all right second Peter 1 3. according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness because the knowledge of him that have called us the glory and virtue poor buyer giving unto us exceeding not just little exceeding great impressive promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature so there's your way in right there's your way into the divine nature of God what about 500. and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness all right if it gets hot in here turn the fans on it again to get that kind of kind of weather and there's a lot of people in here too so but now we were talking about patience patience may be enduring continuance waiting constancy steadfast see that's what I look at I look at somebody's and you know you say well you don't judge people's life well it's like dad said he does have to throw the first stone we do as ministers judge because that's what you did you took things to the priest in the Old Testament and they judged it right so it shouldn't be something that we you know have a problem with if if you um my goodness gracious hey Katie come up here sit in front so we can get your picture I hope you've been here forever how you doing girl yeah you ever see you said you were coming to see us you talked to your line okay now for those who don't know this her name is Miss Katie sister Katie she's from Brother Homer Longoria's church just a minute does anybody remember Colleen Hurst that used to come here yeah well I do this is her name look at her oh yeah yeah sure do so she comes from Brother Homer's Church coming to visit so that's wonderful good to have you with us all right now what we were talking about was what we look at as ministers we look at the consistency we look at the perseverance of a person because like we've already said taking Hank and his wife for an example I've seen people come in here and this you have two this is the greatest thing since sliced bread this is most wonderful message this is the most wonderful dish the most wonderful that six months later they're gone that's right so it really didn't caught up they got caught up in the shouting the boys they got caught up in the shouting the trumpet but they never became the shout or the trumpet right and God was maybe on them but not in them because God can anoint you God can anoint a sinner to do something right God where's my law he said ever seen bring forth of his kind well sinners sinners have kids just like we do as Christians so God has to go by his law and even when a sinner has faith when a sinner has faith they get healed and they say well I must be of God well no that just means that you entered into a law that God said if you'll believe what I said I'll heal you what's wrong with you people were healed during the Beatles campaign when the Beatles came over across to the United States well they believed they believe that those men could touch God they had a perverted way of doing it but they believe that so when you have belief in faith Hey listen this was one I can't see brother Brandon would say a prostitute a they probably last Saturday night done her business but Sunday when he was preaching and called a prayer line they walk across the prayer line and they would get healed right and a Christian come across the pulpit and lose their healing why it was based on that prostitute said I believe what that man said right and God healed him a Christian walked up and said I believe what that man said but now I probably sin today or I probably did this right I got condemned her condemnation or for him their condemnation is what kept them from getting healed The Prostitute brother Brown wasn't condemning her for being a he was trying to get her body healed and then in turn God could save her soul and he's done that many times remember I um I can't remember her name but it's that uh girl he talks about all the time she was a drunk she was a prostitute now she's out testified of course that was back in the 60s but see God can wash you up God can clean you God can you know he can do that but it's just a law that God goes by then he said if you'll just believe me I'll do it that's right all right go Christian or non-Christian but when we like we were talking about in The Book of Psalms when when that when that God resides in you because see God can't dwell in an unclean vessel you can't help God inside of you and the devil inside of you at the same time all right that resides now you can have God in you and the devil will fight you he will come and fight but he cannot reside in that front in the Bible in Matthew it says that the unclean Spirit goes out we'll see when you go through justification when you go through sanctification when you're going through your Christian Journey the unclean spirits driven out of the man seek at the rest finest none walketh and drive places what there is a demon you're possessed by a demon I don't care what your name is there's demons that possess all of us right brother random said diabetes is a demon a blood-sucking demon now whether you're Christian or not that has nothing to do with it okay it's because a lot of people will say well because you're sick because you're not of God ain't got one thing doing it that's right I ain't got one thing to do with it amen you got to have faith right but God's healed the inside of man first right so that unclean Spirit leaves you and you feel good I did I felt wonderful I felt so empty and so I did I when I come out of that water and was baptized there in 1997 in December oh it was actually January the water was cold as ice but I was as warm as I could be I didn't feel nothing but just total emptiness why something had come out of me I had wanted to show the world that I had changed or that God had changed me all right and then when you come to that though you keep going through life and that's what happens to a lot of people they come in here they go anywhere they start going to church and they feel good and everything feels all right and they do get the unclean Spirit driven out of them but remember the Bible says you've got to fill it with something or that unclean spirit is going to come back amen and he's not going to come back alone right he's going to bring seven of his buddies worse than he was you know what worse is it's not that you if you had a drunk demon cast off of you that you're going to be eight times more drunk no he's going to bring his religious buddies this time he's going to make you feel religious that's the religious ones that come he brings his religious buddy it makes you feel religious see then all of a sudden you see the people go away you see people disappear well see they never got the Holy Ghost to fill that vessel that unclean spirit is going to try to come back but if it's filled with the Holy Ghost it can't get in there that's right it can't get in that inner man it can beat your memories and conscious and affection all the pieces but it cannot get inside that man so now that we have the Holy Ghost and God is working in our life not on our life in our life then we come to that what we just read there in in second Peter is now we have a we have a mandate from God not to just lay down we have a mandate from God all over the scriptures that he wasn't going to stop giving you promises just because he'd give you the divine nature of God when he give you the divine nature of God now listen you do have not two Natures but you do have a nature that bombards you and that's your old you remember it's it sure is dead but remember right up here is where we we resurrect we bring it out of the closet we let Satan do what he can do right that's right like bro Gary Atkins said which is a good point they're in Revelation 6. it's all right Revelations 5 it says that uh this Rider had a bow with no arrows well we know that the the prophet told us that was the devil not Jesus that's the devil because he was typing after Christ right but who in the world would go hunting with just a bow and no arrows who in the world would go bear hunting with a gun and no no bullets right you won't beat the thing to death he'll kill you but what we do is is we give that dude a pile of arrows to shoot right back at us we give him the ammunition that's right the shootout because of the things we do in our human life all right so with this statue of a perfect man we're we're not just trying to live a Christian Life we're trying to live an exemplary Christian Life not perfect you'll never be perfect but the Bible says be therefore perfect that's right so we must strive to that and that word perfect means complete now complete means that you have virgin but you have knowledge that you have Temperance did you have patience godlins brotherly kindness that's what we're talking about these are the virtues that work in your life and they're required they're required in this age to get us out of here I just heard brother Brandon say the other day though that you cannot just act that way you know I mean it's good a god-given thing right every one of these virtues are from God brother Brandon said in the Statue of perfect man he says there are people that have these virtues that are not born again I mean you didn't see people with a lot of patience but it's not godly patients right because somewhere they're going to fall off somewhere you'll fall off even as a Christian yes somewhere you're going to fall off brother Brown he'll say he'll say we get we you've got this far and you fall off you get up this far and you fall well you know what that's God showing you though that if you're three rungs up on a ladder you're not gonna fall all the way to the bottom you just don't have the temperance you need so that's where you need to work on them but you know what don't just say well I'm gonna keep having Temperance until I get patience no it's all a blending that's right it's all a blending work of God it's not something see that's why I don't like those lines on that now brother round two did this he put the line but that's just reference lines right I wish they'd turn them this way that's true because you got to have faith all the way up that's right you got to have virtue all the way out you gotta have knowledge all the way up Temperance patience all the way up you can't just say well now I got knowledge I don't need it anymore now I need to work it's not it's not like a it is a classroom thing but it's not a classroom where you where you learn one plus one is two and then two plus two is four four plus four is eight and you keep going like that but you do have to keep that as a basis though because you know what there's only there's only 10 numbers right all right all right nobody's saying amen there's zero one two three four five six seven eight nine there's no other numbers besides those that's true hello that's all you combine them together to make billions and trillions but there's only nine or ten numbers and zero is a number I don't care what they tell you you put a zero on in of a ten dollar bill what you got I know Hallelujah you put a zero on the end of a hundred dollar bill what you got wow I like what he said yeah but you see what I mean there's only 10 numbers so that basis of learning those 10 numbers and then you combine them together same way with faith you have faith faith at the bottom of the pyramid that face is going to carry you all the way up to heaven you're not going to lose that Faker you're not going to come up to faith and be so full so you're running over with faith and there's no room for virtue and all you just it's just a gradual take what you got put it together and go up take what you got put it together and go up take what you got put it together and go up all right so that's what God's doing but you and I look in your patience possess you your souls right you're patient now listen the prophet of God made a statement one time and I I really think it was it was God speaking to us I know it was all God speaking to us but he said this is my eye right God give it to me so now it's mine now he wasn't making an illustration just for for filling up tape space purposes God gives you something to serve so add to your patience or in your patience when you've got patience it's yours when you get to Holy Ghost sure it come from God but whose is it it's yours because you're the one that works see God would just want you to just go all the way up to love when you get the new birth but that's not true he gives you that new birth and then you work with it that's right you got something to do with this thing that's right and then but you'll hear Brother REM say you don't have anything to do with you got to watch what he's saying what he's saying is is God saw you make a choice before the foundation of the world Amen and you're going to come to that because that's what he saw well you don't have a choice when it comes to that right that's right right but the reason you don't have a choice is because you made a choice that's right is that right is that right the reason you don't have a choice is God so you make a choice that's why he can preserve I love that scripture where he says God's preserved us you know preserved means Claude always told me this and it really stuck home you know you know you know what a cucumber is right yeah right cucumber is a cucumber but you take that cucumber put it in something you make a pickle out of it still looks like a cucumber still acts like a cucumber to a degree but it's now pickle there's no way it'll go back to a cucumber right it's always going to be a pickle because it's been put through the process well that's the same thing with you and I we go through a process we go through a pickling process so we're pickles we're just a bunch of old cucumbers that explains a lot we're just a bunch of old cucumbers being a cucumber is what you were born and that cucumber couldn't help itself be a cucumber but through a pickling process he become what he is now and he can never reverse and go back to being a cucumber again he's got to stay a pickle the the demons that come back when the Devil comes back to An Empty Soul a cleaned out Soul are they the things that God hates I've often wondered about that look all the things that God knows that's one of them yeah are they that would be closely related because it's almost the same number because religious people just be critical act like that yes they do that's true you'll think about that something else let's see you just keep it's like an onion peel you know you just keep peeling the onion peel them and they're just many layers of the message of the hour and the Bible but we're never going to get through with patience if we don't have a little patience here pickle that's right I don't I'm just not that don't mean I don't mean pickles like the world thinks pickled either laughs you always say if somebody was drunk they were pickles I want you drunk as long as you're drunk on new wine the Holy Ghost you get drunk on that see you won't have to ever drink again it's true because you get inside bro Joe Forney said he said man when I used to get drunk he said white man black man it didn't matter so we're just all friends he said when I get drunk on the Holy Ghost he said that same way we just all Brothers we're just all brothers and sisters so wine relaxes you but we're not into that wine junk either right okay all right listen let's read this right here uh Romans five and three right here and not only so but we glory in Tribulation we Glory knowing that tribulation work is patience and it's not finished and patience experience and experience hope amen so it's an ongoing process it's something that we have to go through you can't get around it people we've got to learn to have patience because in your patients possess you your souls now our soul is the most important thing yes amen amen whatever's in the soul is going to come out one other way or the other all right now let's go over let's let me skip some of this all right right here no wonder the church is so short this is Brother random and statue of a perfect man now one of the church is so short isn't that right no wonder I'd say repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and a strict trinitarian don't believe that says that oh Antichrist in Jesus name he says Jesus only Look Out Boy I don't know about your Temperance right now say why don't you come and say let's reason this together run around I like to talk I'd like to hear this explain see and come down and listen to it and then put it right before you and then you walk away well we'll get to that in just a few minutes and godlin is safe but when you fly loose you want to jump at every conclusion uh-huh that's that's not it say you haven't got Bible Temperance yet when you do that how to answer back then if you've got all this you can add this to your faith now here we're going fourthly you want to add patience to your faith if you've got faith it works as patient the Bible says see so this is patience now that's the next thing is going to build this stature you know God has got real material in his building see how short we are brother sister see see why where we're at yes sir see we have Glory we have shouts and things because we got faith but when we come down to these things here God can't build us into that stature see he can't he can't make us up to that kind of a place we got all these other things we fall slide off with it he can't build his church then he says patience with what kind of patience first thing is to have patience with God first thing patience with God all right if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith worketh patience When God says anything you believe it that's all you got a patient that's right just believe it all right because remember Abraham there's no way Abraham could produce a child at 100 years old that's right so he had to depend on God Amen so he just said God you said it so you're gonna have to do it see he tried to produce it later earlier in his life he could he could have children because because he had an Ishmael but once he got 100 years old and Sarah was 90 there was no way they were going to have kids unless God came on the scene and changed their body so Abraham can't change his body you and I can't change our body we can bring our body under subjection see that's the key you bring your body under subjection because of what's inside of you this is the control tower right inside the soul the Persona the real you all right God told Abraham 25 years later there wasn't even one sign actually it got worse that's right it's not suggested there was no sign you got worse that's right if you know what I mean yes right he was still believing he was patient with God uh-huh put him always before you let him be the next Crossing thing you can't cross him so just keep him before you he said so and it's going to happen that's right Noah had patience yep no one had real Godly patience God said I'm going to destroy the world with rain remember people it had never rained right it had never rained since the beginning of time it's been 2 000 years since Adam to Noah it has not ran one drop all the water read the Bible the water was coming up out of the ground as a Mist that kept everything water and then you had your rivers and all that but there was no clouds there was no there was atmosphere but there was no rain there was nothing to produce rain so here's Noah and he preached for 120 years the same message it's gonna rain plenty of patients the prophet said not even do fell from heaven wasn't nothing just as Dusty As It Ever Was for 120 years when he was patient then God tries your patience that's right God tries them after he told no one I know I want you to go ahead and get in the yard remember he went in the yard and God shut the door well it was still seven days he was in that art before it started raining all right I'm gonna run the animals in I want you to get in climb way upstairs now so you can look out the top window now I want you to get in there I want you to tell these people tomorrow what I've been preaching for 120 years is going to take place all right you go down there and tell them then remember what happened it didn't rain until the seventh day but when you know what it happened it happened flood came destroyed everybody but the eight people in the ark yes and for all of you information Gina and I went and watched that New Normal movie last night I wouldn't waste my time it's a good drama it's a good action movie but foreign the only thing that was really scriptural about it is is the is it didn't it started drizzling around a little bit but then The Fountains of the deep like the Bible says there was a big plumes of water come shooting up out of the ground because that's what destroyed the Earth surprise surprise 40 days of rain won't destroy the Earth right that's right no it wasn't him really really it just rained That's right The Fountains of the deep opened up the Bible says there was there was aqueducts Under the Ground full of water and God turned them thing off actually you know what happened remember what the prophet said man destroys himself always that's right so I believe it was an atomic explosion I believe because it was in the days of Noah so shall be in the days of the son of man well if if we're this Advanced now they were that advanced or more back then right I can see why that that civilizations turned upside down and all because God they destroyed their self by either an economic explosion or something went off and it caused those fountains to open up and that's what filled the world with water knocked 40 days and 40 nights of rain and and let me give you another secret they weren't in the ark just 40 days either they were in the ark a year a month and so many days they were in there 13 months in that art that's right okay so we don't read our Bible right every once in a while we read it when we hear the story of Noah and the flood in 40 days and it rained and then it quit and then it got out and then you know it ain't exactly all that went on so anyway but don't waste your time going to see it unless you just want to see an action movie and uh got some pretty good points in it sometimes but something to make you think but still it was I wouldn't go see it again ever nothing wrong with it I mean we didn't have there was no you know a little bit of violence but and and but they talked about the Creator and they talked about things you know they never called in God they always call them Creator and stuff like that so but no one had patience this guy preached for 120 years that's a long time and there was no scientific evidence that it was going to happen if they were as advanced then as we are now I just said that that's what the Bible said they were as advanced as we are here then they could shoot the Stars the moon anywhere they could see there's no moisture nowhere except in the ground right and here's Noah preaching against the whole scientific age that they were in they remember only eight people made it that's right and one of them was the devil Pam remember ham what ham did I know the scripture says so that God divided the waters between the firm Ness so he put water it's up there yeah that was just she just didn't know it right that was just what he done he just hit it all in the clouds and everything they just didn't have anything to see any moisture that was gonna I sure but they thought this ain't gonna destroy the world it never has before if it rains a little bit so what big deal but they didn't know that what was under was what was going to kill her right same way with man now what's under us is what's going to kill them that's right got it yes all right I don't know how I got off on that but brother Brandon said it would be volcanic so that's underneath that's underneath coming out yep all right remember but if you ain't got that no way don't try to add it in other words talking about nowhere it won't work it won't work on healing it won't work on nothing else it's got to blend in with the same materialist vulcanized to that's right got to add it patience with God's promise yes sir Noah believed it and he had patience with God 120 years Moses had patience with God yes sir Moses I've heard the Cry of my people seen their Affliction I'm coming down to the liver I'm going to send you down and a little contrast there between him and God God showed him his glorious and here I go when he once seen the glory of God you're saying he had Faith what's that in your hand Moses a stick throw it down turn into a serpent oh my take it up Moses if I'm able to carry the snake and turn it back ah brother Brown claps his hand three times amen if God can give me a natural life he can give me a spiritual life I believe he got a little Revelation here got a little happy if God can give you the first birth he can give you the second part amen if God can heal this by Divine Healing he can raise it up I'm sure he's pointing to this if God can heal this by Divine Healing he can raise it up again to his glory in the last days oh my oh that's right Moses said you know when I layered on that Foundation there was patience laid on there so I'll just wait and see what God will do there the old serpents was crawling around blowing hissing at one another first thing you know Moses serpent went go go go remember Janice and Jennifer's through through there sticks down and turned him in the surface yeah but Moses the snake eat their snake you know what Moses carried him around the whole time he carried him three snakes around in his or two snakes around in his Cane the whole time he was he took him to the promised land or not promised land but he took him up to the door of the Promised Land and uh wait on the Lord have patience that's right that's a sermon yep how about the Pentecostal people now he's talking about the upper room as long as they got the commission wait until wait until you're endued with power how long they didn't have no question how long will it be they just got the answer wait until they went up there and said all right boys maybe 15 minutes from now the holy spirit's going to be on us and we're going to have our ministry 15 minutes past nobody one day pass two days three four five six seven some of them might have said hey don't you think you already got it no no no that's it no that that's right you better come on out boys devil said you you know you already got what you want go in and start your minutes go and start your ministering no no no no we ain't got it yet because he said there will come what will take place in the last days stamron lips and other tongues when I speak to this people and this is the rest that I said Isaiah 28 19. this is it you'll get it when why we'll know when it comes we'll know when it comes we'll know it promise of the father there he waited nine days and then on the tenth day we were there they had patience to wait now if you've got that kind of patience after God gives you a promise and you see it in the Bible you guys see it in the Bible it's mind then wait then if you've got the kind of patience add it to your faith and see how high you're getting now you're getting way up here now all right the clock hand is getting way around too isn't it that's his two now we need to go add this to your faith we'll start right there with May finish space next Sunday we may not I'm not going to say that anymore I'm gonna say it until thanks Lord bless you patience that's right
