[26:55] his shoulder is what was operated on
[26:58] because when you when you shake his hand
[27:01] don't put your hand on his shoulder
[27:04] that's where he had the operation that
[27:07] was the worst thing I told the doctor I
[27:08] said why'd you put all this stuff down
[27:10] here I said you need to have a big old
[27:12] sign that says do not touch because this
[27:15] is the cert you're not people pat you on
[27:17] the back over there hugging that don't
[27:18] do that for at least for a little while
[27:20] just shake the right hand and say god

[28:51] be announcing it between now and then so
[28:53] Galatians 3:16 we're going to talk about
[28:55] journey of a believer and we're going to
[28:58] talk about Abram because yesterday we
[29:01] were listening to the youth and man they
[29:05] can ask some questions and still got
[29:08] some good ones for us too for brother
[29:10] Dale to answer some of them well then
[29:13] we'll have to touch on that later but
[29:16] but you hear what they say in you you
[29:18] think and you think man those mines
[29:20] they're so fresh and they're so new and
[29:22] they're there they're thinking about
[29:24] things and you know you may look over at
[29:26] your kid they're over there
[29:29] something's working somewhere even you
[29:34] know even my grandbaby Deanna you
[29:36] something will come up and she'll be way
[29:38] off in the other room and she'll go
[29:39] that's not right you know I mean you
[29:42] know she'll hear us say something you
[29:43] know about something in this alright and
[29:46] but they're listening I told you many
[29:50] times before I read a book long time ago
[29:52] and it's called wimp children are like
[29:55] wet cement whatever impression is made
[29:59] while they're while they're young and
[30:01] while it's wet that impression once it
[30:03] dries that impression stays there all
[30:06] through their life so we want to try to
[30:08] make a good impression here in the
[30:11] church where brother Dale talks about
[30:13] dedicating the children not only to the
[30:16] parents but also to hey we get them we
[30:20] get them Wednesdays and longtime
[30:21] Saturdays and and ever signed me pretty
[30:24] much so we're living before I'm almost
[30:26] as much as a regular family would so
[30:28] they
[30:30] they get to see us as much as they do
[30:32] the others and we want to make a good
[30:33] impression on the children so Galatians
[30:36] 3 verse 16
[30:39] let's pray Heavenly Father thank you for
[30:41] this day that we have set time that we
[30:44] can come and talk about you Lord and
[30:48] listen to what the Bible's already said
[30:50] about a man named Abram
[30:52] that starts a journey that now even
[30:56] several thousand years from the time he
[31:00] physically walked the earth we're still
[31:01] talking about because God said that
[31:04] Abraham would be the faith seed that
[31:09] we're looking at in the end time
[31:11] the faith that Abraham had Lord we pray
[31:15] that it will ignite us today what's
[31:17] inside of us already and for the ones
[31:20] that are just coming in and the ones
[31:22] that are just listening now maybe for
[31:23] the first time that they'll listen Lord
[31:26] to what you've already said about a man
[31:28] and a journey that just took a natural
[31:31] journey through life but Lord it had so
[31:33] much spiritual implication till we're
[31:35] still talking about it today father we
[31:38] pray that you just healed the sick all
[31:40] the ones that are there sick in body
[31:42] Lord they're sick and soul we pray that
[31:44] you would just minister to each one
[31:46] father be with the ones that are not
[31:47] here the ones that are sick brother date
[31:50] brother Al all the different ones Lord
[31:52] that we call ever service we pray that
[31:54] you'd give them supernatural strength
[31:55] father we ask your blessings on the ones
[31:58] that are in the foreign fields we pray
[31:59] that you give them fruit for their labor
[32:01] father bless us today and give us our
[32:03] daily bread and Jesus name we pray amen
[32:05] so we're going to take our time let's
[32:08] see what Paul said in Galatians 3 verse
[32:11] 16 says now to Abraham and his seed
[32:14] where the promise is made
[32:16] he saith not and to seeds as of many but
[32:20] as of one and to thy seed which is
[32:24] Christ now we got a listen now this is
[32:27] Paul we know there's a natural journey
[32:31] of a natural man but it has spiritual
[32:32] implication because the the true royal
[32:35] seed of Abraham was not Isaac it was
[32:39] Christ and then cry who at works Christ
[32:41] now crisis in us and then and there
[32:44] I say that the covenant that was
[32:46] confirmed before of God in Christ the
[32:49] law which was four hundred and thirty
[32:50] years after him because we were talking
[32:53] about last night
[32:53] there was no law in Abraham's time there
[32:55] was no law the law was Moses four
[32:57] hundred and something years later God
[32:59] brings the law into existence on Mount
[33:02] Sinai with Moses Abraham doesn't have
[33:04] anything but but but what this man is
[33:06] fishing to say get up move all right for
[33:11] the inheritance wait a minute the law
[33:13] which was four hundred and thirty years
[33:15] after cannot dissin all that it should
[33:17] make the promise of none effect for if
[33:21] the inheritance be of the law it is no
[33:25] more promise why because it's law it
[33:29] tells you what to do but God gave it to
[33:32] Abraham by promise let's read this one
[33:36] before you sit down Hebrews six verse 13
[33:39] through 15 for when God made promise to
[33:42] Abraham because he could swear by no
[33:44] greater he swear by himself saying
[33:49] surely blessings look at this I will
[33:51] bless them multiplying I will multiply
[33:54] Lee and so after he had patiently
[33:56] endured he obtained the promise you may
[33:59] be seated in the Lord at his blessing
[34:01] for the reading of the word and we look
[34:04] and we see this covenant that was made
[34:06] it was we've seen many times that
[34:09] brother Ram speaks of the Covenant but a
[34:12] covenant is made between two people and
[34:14] God in the beginning he made a covenant
[34:16] with late with Adam and he said Adam he
[34:18] said if as long as you don't eat of that
[34:20] tree you'll be fine you can eat of this
[34:24] one you can eat of all the fruit trees
[34:26] but of that one tree if you eat of that
[34:28] tree you're gonna die right so that's a
[34:32] conditional covenant that's a covenant
[34:34] with condition all right if you do this
[34:37] if you don't do that but now when God
[34:39] comes to Abraham God knows one thing for
[34:42] sure we can't keep the Covenant cuz that
[34:45] caused Adam his first son couldn't even
[34:49] keep the Covenant amen
[34:51] so what God says is he says okay I know
[34:53] you're gonna make mistakes I know you're
[34:55] going to be bad
[34:57] you're gonna have you know a carnal mind
[34:59] and I know you're gonna come the wrong
[35:01] way and I know all these things are
[35:03] gonna happen to you so I'm gonna make an
[35:05] unconditional covenant I'm gonna save
[35:07] you to spot yourself
[35:09] amen so that's what he said he could
[35:12] swear by no other he swore by himself he
[35:14] didn't swear by this or by that or by
[35:16] the don't eat the tree he said Abraham I
[35:20] promise you I'm going to make you a
[35:24] great man and many nations are gonna
[35:28] come out of you because watch now let's
[35:29] let's read this one quote and then
[35:31] you're gonna have to go brother Joe if
[35:34] he wanted to because we're gonna start
[35:35] in Genesis 12 if you got your Bibles I
[35:38] brought my new one because my other one
[35:40] this one brother just Trammell gave me
[35:41] an it's the Scofield and I really I
[35:43] haven't got all transcribed into it but
[35:46] my other Bible the book of Genesis the
[35:48] bow fell out of it so because you know
[35:51] me I like to book a Genesis so let's
[35:54] read this though and then let's start in
[35:55] Genesis 12 he's gonna try to bring it up
[35:58] on the screen so you can read it there
[35:59] but if you have your Bibles I'd rather
[36:01] you maybe look at your Bible because I
[36:03] want you to see it if they don't get it
[36:04] up here but now watch brother branham
[36:06] what he tells us and who is this
[36:08] Melchizedek in 1965 he says when Abraham
[36:11] met him he was Melchizedek he's talking
[36:13] about Jesus Christ in the form of
[36:15] Melchizedek not Jesus Christ the flesh
[36:18] man because remember Melchizedek was not
[36:21] your brother Melchizedek was not at that
[36:24] form he could not save Abraham he could
[36:29] give him the promise but he couldn't
[36:31] save him because at that point in time
[36:33] that was a body that was created he
[36:36] stepped into the body and then the body
[36:38] went out of existence that was not our
[36:40] brother okay but he was in a position
[36:43] though because watch this
[36:45] what brother Brahim says I love this
[36:47] quote because there's a promise to me
[36:49] and you when Abraham met him he was
[36:51] Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the
[36:56] attributes now what were you what are
[36:59] you you're an attribute of God amen
[37:02] so now he unfolds here what all the
[37:04] attributes will do in the
[37:06] final in every son of Abraham they you
[37:09] and I by faith seed we are the son of
[37:12] Abraham and daughters every son of the
[37:16] faith will absolutely do the same thing
[37:20] what meet Melchizedek go on this journey
[37:23] of Abram that starts as Abram and then
[37:25] he ends up as Abraham and then he
[37:27] doesn't get circumcised at the first
[37:29] because that's the type of the baptism
[37:30] of the Holy Ghost he starts his journey
[37:32] so let's take a into Genesis 12 and
[37:35] let's remember now look this is a
[37:38] covenant that cannot be broken because
[37:44] God made it Abraham didn't say okay I'm
[37:48] gonna do this enough Abraham doesn't say
[37:51] anything God made the promise with Adam
[37:55] he said I Adam if you'll do this you'll
[37:57] be fine Adam broke that so guard sitting
[37:58] up not gonna do that anymore I'm gonna
[38:01] make a covenant with myself now if you
[38:05] make a covenant with yourself and your
[38:06] almighty eternal God it can't fail a man
[38:09] so this is what we're going to look at
[38:11] this cannot fail in Genesis 12 because I
[38:14] want you to see how this starts in the
[38:17] plan of redemption and we'll read your
[38:19] quotes maybe later on this afternoon
[38:21] where brother Brown tells you that this
[38:24] truly is the walk of justification
[38:27] sanctification and a baptism of the Holy
[38:29] Ghost in one man called Abram to begin
[38:32] with and then to Abraham all right so
[38:35] let's read this passage of Scripture now
[38:39] the Lord had said unto Abram now
[38:41] remember it's Abram it's not Abraham you
[38:45] and I young people old people doesn't
[38:48] matter when you started in your journey
[38:50] you become a newborn babe in Christ you
[38:53] have to start in abraham's place where
[38:59] something's going to tell you get up
[39:02] quit doing what you're doing get out of
[39:06] the wherever you're in you got to get up
[39:08] and move all right so there's
[39:11] justification so young people old people
[39:14] that are becoming young people
[39:15] I like that don't you older people I do
[39:17] because I'm an older people out
[39:19] but watch what God says now God's not
[39:22] gonna let Abram have anything to do with
[39:24] this except make a choice you remember
[39:28] yesterday young people we were talking
[39:30] about you a free moral agent to make any
[39:32] choice you can press play you can mash
[39:35] this you can mash that you can't blame
[39:38] it on nobody but yourself what you do
[39:41] but now watch now the Lord had said unto
[39:46] Abram he's talking to Abram you and I
[39:50] all start I want you to agree with me on
[39:52] this you all start as Abram you're not
[39:55] complete Abraham's name is now Abraham
[39:58] but that was the completion in the
[40:00] journey later he's Abram so all of you
[40:03] are Abram that are beginning in your
[40:06] Christian journey you're all in this
[40:08] position now the Lord had said unto
[40:11] Abram now look at that that's past tense
[40:13] so that doesn't mean that he just come
[40:15] down and spoke to Abram
[40:17] read your Bible now the Lord had said so
[40:23] in other words he's talking to Abram and
[40:25] I agree your brother Dale this is not a
[40:27] quote just a Freda you can't find this
[40:29] in the message in the hour she was
[40:31] asking about a quote last night I said
[40:32] he was mine I don't mind that but
[40:37] there's there's nothing in there that
[40:40] tells you that God didn't speak to a
[40:42] million other people when he spoke to
[40:44] Abram because God's not a respecter of
[40:47] persons he can't just section somebody
[40:50] off and say I'm gonna just deal with
[40:52] Abram and no one else but Abram is the
[40:56] only one that did what God said how many
[41:00] billions of people in the world were in
[41:02] the world alive when God called you yeah
[41:06] how many times have you said I've set an
[41:08] airport many times thousands of people
[41:10] walking by they don't have half them
[41:12] don't even know anything about God the
[41:14] other half believe in something they
[41:16] thinks of God the other part of them I
[41:18] don't know where they're at and they
[41:19] don't either
[41:20] but I said God why did you choose me you
[41:22] know what he told me he said because you
[41:24] responded because you responded
[41:28] because you see that makes an individual
[41:30] you responded when God called you said
[41:33] huh huh talking to me that's the same
[41:37] danger labrum he may have been talking
[41:39] to thousands of people that day and
[41:41] finally he comes Abram and Abram does
[41:44] what he says because watch what he says
[41:47] right here get thee out of thy country
[41:49] okay young people that are just born
[41:52] again do you go back do you go back to
[41:54] where you used to be
[41:55] why uh-huh good boy
[42:01] Jer what he said he's not in the same
[42:04] country he used to be we might be in the
[42:08] United States of America but but I
[42:10] promise you brothers that boy is not in
[42:12] the same country that he started in he's
[42:16] in a different place because God he said
[42:19] because he was born he's born again he
[42:21] knows that now because there's something
[42:23] happened he'd come out of right
[42:27] what is redemption coming out of and
[42:29] going into this maybe simple today but I
[42:32] want everybody to say be able to say
[42:33] Amen get thee out of thy country and
[42:36] from thy kindred your friends didn't
[42:41] come with you and this journey did they
[42:42] now you may have them now but I'm
[42:43] talking about your old friends all right
[42:45] then they're not here today why cuz you
[42:48] left their country from thy kindred and
[42:52] from thy father's house now don't leave
[42:54] your daddy's house that they take your
[42:57] type so far and in stop
[42:59] I'm tool you can if you find you late
[43:03] Neverland I'm tell and that I will show
[43:06] that you will be in a different country
[43:07] than buddy until a land that look now
[43:13] watch watch all this come into nothing
[43:17] Abraham's Abraham didn't him Abram
[43:19] didn't say anything watch watch this I
[43:24] unto a land that I will show thee now
[43:27] look Abram didn't go straight to that
[43:29] country now he went to Canaan he went to
[43:36] Egypt he went to this place he went to
[43:38] her and he went he just kept why because
[43:40] it's his journey though and you and I
[43:44] have the same way of trying to find the
[43:45] will of the Lord we do that and we made
[43:47] mistakes were Abram we're just walking
[43:50] in just God just calls us out and we
[43:54] responded but when he when you respond
[43:59] watch how God just takes it all over and
[44:02] does it itself I will make of thee a
[44:06] great nation not Abram you don't have to
[44:08] go scoop you do have to go to school you
[44:10] don't have to go in other words you
[44:12] don't have to learn what I'm fixing to
[44:13] tell you and I will bless thee and make
[44:19] thy name great Abram didn't have to do
[44:21] that God's gonna do it for it and thou
[44:26] shall be a blessing I've got my notes in
[44:30] my Bible I gotta get it out over here so
[44:31] we know I mean you're gonna you gonna be
[44:35] my example than anything because you
[44:37] were Abram but look at those I will now
[44:42] look at this and I will make of thee a
[44:46] great nation and I will bless is there
[44:51] anybody else involved in this I will
[44:56] make of thee a great nation I will bless
[44:58] thee and make thy name great and thou
[45:00] shalt be a blessing now not Abram not
[45:06] Abram he's not going to make Abram a
[45:08] blessing but he's got to start somewhere
[45:10] to get to Abraham
[45:12] him because right now his name is means
[45:16] high father Abram but I've got telling
[45:21] him he's fixing to be he's going to make
[45:23] a great nation he's got to have some
[45:25] kind of change in his life to become
[45:29] Abraham the father of nations but watch
[45:35] and I will bless them that bless thee
[45:39] and curse him that curseth thee and in
[45:45] thee shall all families of the earth be
[45:49] blessed
[45:51] that's a pretty good load but you know
[45:53] what Abram didn't have to do anything
[45:55] God did it that's what I'm telling you
[45:58] about when you're starting your
[45:59] Christian journey God has laid these
[46:03] blessings out for you to just grab hold
[46:07] of because you're a babe you're a baby
[46:11] and here's Abram just for a little
[46:15] background here's Abram in there he's in
[46:18] herb child days he's over in a heathen
[46:20] country and his brother Dale said this
[46:22] morning he was not he's thought he
[46:24] didn't come from jewelry or juice the
[46:26] line of Jews he's in Hebrew because he
[46:29] came he came out of what you and I came
[46:33] out of what whatever we were in you can
[46:36] put that in there you came out of that
[46:38] to get into this place that God can talk
[46:42] to you Abram now that's not your full
[46:45] name yet but it is a start
[46:48] so here's Abram building idols with his
[46:52] father
[46:54] idol worship her and all of a sudden
[46:57] there somebody comes to him and says I
[47:00] need you to leave everything you got
[47:04] everything you got you got to leave
[47:12] whatever situation you're in you got to
[47:14] leave because we remember what does
[47:16] repent mean repent means to turn and go
[47:19] in the other direction God did not want
[47:21] Abram to continue to build idols
[47:24] he doesn't want you and I to continue to
[47:27] build idols he wanted him to get out of
[47:30] that country but remember he made a
[47:34] mistake because God didn't call what God
[47:39] called Abram so Abram departed as the
[47:45] Lord had spoken unto him and lot went
[47:48] with him that was the problem you know
[47:53] why because listen when you're justified
[47:55] you do bring some of the world in that
[47:57] journey with you
[48:00] amen
[48:02] I did you did you bring part of that
[48:06] with you but God doesn't tell you to do
[48:08] that you're doing out of your own and
[48:10] you will get in trouble for that because
[48:12] somewhere you gotta separate from that
[48:15] lot a lot separate from a lot right
[48:22] right okay everybody got that one more
[48:25] time a lot okay and a lot went with him
[48:29] and Abram was 75 years old young man
[48:33] when he departed out of Haran and Abram
[48:37] took Sarah I know that Sarah that's not
[48:42] Sarah right that woman and in here I see
[48:50] where I wrote in here is contentious
[48:53] Sarah huh huh aren't we a little
[49:00] contentious even when you come out cuz
[49:04] she brought a lot with you and you still
[49:09] married to part of the world which is
[49:10] contentious because remember you're not
[49:13] born again now this is the journey of
[49:15] Abram he's not entitle a broom and
[49:19] Abraham never got born again but he
[49:24] believed what God said cuz that makes us
[49:27] the faith seed of Abraham and as I read
[49:31] you before nuts now look Abraham Abram
[49:35] Abraham was told
[49:38] you'll produce so many children you
[49:41] can't count them look down at the sand
[49:43] look up at the sky now that's a promise
[49:46] God naturally gave Abram because you got
[49:49] to remember there's two things Abram is
[49:51] the walking a purely natural life but
[49:55] he's also walking so you and I can look
[49:57] back in the spiritual life that he's
[50:00] living and see that God was with him all
[50:02] during the journey everybody got that
[50:05] say man and Abram took Sarai
[50:08] the contentious one and lot his
[50:12] brother's son he's bringing baggage with
[50:14] him and gets you in trouble and all
[50:20] their substance that they had gathered
[50:21] and the souls that had gotten in Haran
[50:24] now look he's taking a lot of baggage
[50:26] with him God didn't tell him to do that
[50:28] God said you you separate yourself
[50:32] that's the same thing in our journey
[50:34] listen and we do when we are justified
[50:37] in our justified journey we want
[50:41] everybody to be safe so we try to get
[50:44] our drunk friends and our smoking dope
[50:46] friends and whatever whatever friends we
[50:49] try to get them to come along with us
[50:50] because we're gonna go somewhere
[50:53] different you're gonna find out real
[50:55] quick that God didn't talk to all them
[50:59] God just talked to you you'll find out
[51:03] real quick that they ain't seeing what
[51:07] you're seeing hey man right they ain't
[51:12] saying what you're seeing but you're
[51:13] warm I come on I got this new thing man
[51:15] come on the church and come on I'm gonna
[51:17] start reading my Bible and y'all come on
[51:20] oh no they not know God didn't speak to
[51:22] them now if God spoke to them they're
[51:23] right there with you but you'll find out
[51:26] real quick that God only speaks to
[51:29] people that will listen remember I don't
[51:33] remember the I love this quote from
[51:35] Dwight Moody he said God will fill those
[51:38] who are not full of theirself yeah God
[51:43] will only I think the quote is God will
[51:45] only fill those who are not fool
[51:46] ourselves cuz if you're fooling yourself
[51:48] God ain't got I ain't got it all around
[51:50] but Abram started this journey now we
[51:56] may just get the justification today but
[51:59] we got two services next Sunday we can
[52:01] deal with that but Abram took Sarah
[52:05] Abram took Sarah his wife and large
[52:09] brother than anyway they stole here they
[52:10] go they got all this baggage they're
[52:12] heading into there what were they were
[52:14] they going they went to go into the land
[52:17] of Canaan if Canaan is the Promised Land
[52:19] for the believer right and into the land
[52:22] of Canaan they came to watch and Abram
[52:27] passed through the lens of the place of
[52:28] Sikkim unto the plain of mora and the
[52:31] Canaanites was then in the land and the
[52:34] Lord appeared unto Abram now look the
[52:36] Lord didn't appear unto everybody he
[52:41] appeared to Abram not your friends he
[52:43] appeared to Abram you put your name in
[52:46] there all right and the Lord appeared in
[52:50] Abram he said well I've never had the
[52:51] Lord appear to me
[52:52] he appears to you all the time because
[52:57] when you look down the word in the world
[52:58] and you see that he appears because what
[53:03] is he he's the word hey man just a veil
[53:07] it is so nice to hear you in this in
[53:10] this service
[53:12] god bless you and the Lord appeared I
[53:16] even Scofield picks this up and then
[53:18] you're in your margin it says theophany
[53:24] I'm well King I'm just reading what's
[53:27] that and the Lord appeared unto Abram
[53:31] and said unto thy son do thy seed will I
[53:34] give this land now where's he at he's in
[53:37] Canaan but now watch he built an altar
[53:41] he went to church hello he went to
[53:47] church built an altar but now remember
[53:50] he's not gonna stay there because he's
[53:53] still Abram he's not Abraham he still
[53:57] got all this baggage and all these
[54:00] things that he's got with him
[54:03] and there builded an altar to the Lord
[54:06] who appeared unto Him
[54:08] now watch now go back down to the seven
[54:12] because he's in Canaan listen to me he's
[54:14] in Canaan right he's going to leave and
[54:17] go into other places but eventually he's
[54:20] going to come right back to where he met
[54:23] God you will come back to where you met
[54:26] God the first time if you're a true
[54:28] born-again believer even in your birth
[54:31] you're going to come by to that altar
[54:34] the first place that God appeared to you
[54:37] you're going to come back to that that's
[54:40] why this is April's journey is just
[54:42] thank God for a prophet because he could
[54:45] just think you just walk the journey
[54:47] with him and tell us all these things
[54:49] and I'm not bringing quotes you ought to
[54:51] know it by now what brother Branham said
[54:54] about Abraham and Abel and he removed
[54:57] from this until mountain is east of
[54:59] Bethel now Bethel that's Bethlehem it
[55:03] becomes Bethlehem which is the house of
[55:06] God's bread or the house of God all
[55:09] right
[55:09] now watch and he removed from thence
[55:12] into a mountain on the east of Bethel
[55:14] and pitched his tent having Bethel on
[55:16] the west and high on the east and they
[55:18] builded an altar he's going to church
[55:20] you know it does not work it's not
[55:24] written that Abram ever built an altar
[55:27] because remember he had a bunch of other
[55:28] gods but when one guy when he met one
[55:34] guy he makes an altar everywhere he goes
[55:38] he built an altar unto the Lord and
[55:40] called upon the name of the Lord and
[55:44] Abram journeyed now look folks
[55:47] Abram got up and left why he didn't do
[55:56] what God said because Abram journeyed
[55:59] going on still toward the south and we
[56:01] read this last week about the famine
[56:02] there was a famine in the land now
[56:04] remember what I told you what is a
[56:06] famine a famine makes you make a
[56:08] decision you got to move when there's a
[56:11] famine in the land you got to leave
[56:13] but now God look Abram is still Abram
[56:17] not Abraham Abraham would have stayed
[56:20] there but Abram hightails it back to the
[56:26] world if you're not born again even in
[56:32] your justified condition if you keep
[56:34] going and keep going and if you lose
[56:36] sight you going right back indeed you're
[56:41] going right back to the things you used
[56:43] to do member brother Brown said
[56:44] justification is a work of the Holy
[56:46] Ghost but it's not an inward dwelling
[56:48] it's just getting your past sins chopped
[56:51] off you still have that old root of evil
[56:53] Abram was still Abram still had a
[56:56] contentious wife still had a lot to deal
[57:00] with okay forget someone just saying
[57:03] there's a lot to deal with free to get
[57:04] it okay but he had a lot to deal with he
[57:09] deals with a lot for a long time there
[57:16] was a famine in the land and Abram went
[57:18] down into Egypt which he should have
[57:21] never done brother Brom tells us that
[57:23] was his one mistake at one of his first
[57:25] mistakes because what happened soon as
[57:27] he gets down there he starts line hello
[57:33] soon as he gets in Egypt he goes right
[57:36] up he gets back he doesn't get in the
[57:38] world do you understand what I'm saying
[57:40] but in type he's heading back to the
[57:42] world now he's having to lie to keep his
[57:45] skin so he's got his contentious wife
[57:48] and he says you tell them that we're
[57:50] sisters not to save her to save him
[57:59] we get a little selfish when we're
[58:01] justified that's that but now remember
[58:04] what does a new birth bring will look at
[58:07] later and came to pass when you come
[58:09] near to enter into Egypt that he said
[58:10] unto Sarah his wife behold now I know
[58:13] that there are a fair woman to look upon
[58:15] I've lived with you for all these years
[58:18] memory 75 therefore it shall come to
[58:21] pass when the Egyptians shall see thee
[58:23] that they shall say this is his wife and
[58:26] they'll kill me
[58:27] but they'll save you say I praise thee
[58:32] thou art my sister would you just lie
[58:34] with me for a few minutes okay just lie
[58:38] with me come on let's let's get together
[58:39] on this that it may be well with me for
[58:42] thy sake and my soul shall live because
[58:45] of thee and remember let's skip through
[58:48] the story we know what happened but look
[58:51] at verse 17 going down to 17 remember
[58:54] what happened was Pharaoh did take her
[58:57] she must've been a pretty girl at 65
[59:00] years old she must have been kind of a
[59:03] I'm pretty
[59:03] because Pharaoh said she's mine and
[59:06] Abram says you can have her really I
[59:10] mean he just but now look the Lord had
[59:15] to speak to Pharaoh verse 17 and the
[59:19] Lord plagued Pharaoh in his house with a
[59:21] great plague because of Sarah Abraham's
[59:24] wife and and Pharaoh called Abram now
[59:28] look brother Brahim tells us and I agree
[59:30] I don't think I have to agree with
[59:32] brother Branham but what he said brought
[59:33] how he brought it was he said see there
[59:36] he said God was preserving the promise
[59:40] there's no way Sarah womb was going to
[59:43] be polluted by any other man because
[59:46] naturally naturally the seed of Abraham
[59:49] that was promised is going to come
[59:52] through that woman Abram just don't know
[59:55] how it's done yet just like getting
[59:56] justification a lot of times we go god I
[59:58] don't know why how this is gonna end up
[1:00:01] but I'm just gonna trust what you said
[1:00:04] Abram is going through the same journey
[1:00:07] Sarah is just they're all wide-eyed
[1:00:09] she's like I'm just here but God
[1:00:13] protects both of them in their error
[1:00:19] listen folks listen young men young
[1:00:21] young ladies we make mistakes
[1:00:24] especially even in your first part of
[1:00:27] your journey because truly you do pull
[1:00:29] all the baggage with you because you
[1:00:32] don't know different Abram didn't know
[1:00:34] any different sir I didn't know any
[1:00:38] different now Abram just knew that
[1:00:39] somebody spoke to him and said get up
[1:00:41] and go somewhere else so he fumbles
[1:00:45] around just like we do in justification
[1:00:47] we fumble around but Pharaoh called
[1:00:51] Abram and said what is this that thou
[1:00:52] has done to me now look Abram is doing
[1:00:55] the line Sera's an accomplice but what
[1:01:00] does God say what is this that thou has
[1:01:05] done to me why did us now not tell me
[1:01:07] that she was thy wife why said it's -
[1:01:12] she is my sister so I might have taken
[1:01:14] her to me for a wife now therefore
[1:01:16] behold thy wife take her and go thy way
[1:01:19] what's this and Pharaoh commanded his
[1:01:21] men concerning him and they sent him
[1:01:23] away and his wife and all that he had
[1:01:25] said him away she's my sister I mean
[1:01:30] they lied and God let them get by with
[1:01:33] it because he knew what part of the
[1:01:36] journey they were in it's just like we
[1:01:39] were talking about downstairs and
[1:01:40] yesterday afternoon in the Bible study
[1:01:44] listen folks Moses had a commission to
[1:01:48] bring the people out of Israel and put
[1:01:52] them in the promised land his commission
[1:01:55] was not to build an ark his commission
[1:01:58] was not to have to down across his
[1:02:00] commission was not to be in the first
[1:02:01] Church age of the third church age of
[1:02:03] the tip or the seventh Church age right
[1:02:05] that was his job this is Abraham's job
[1:02:09] you and I now have come to a place that
[1:02:11] this is our job we have a job
[1:02:14] to do and we'll get to it in just a
[1:02:16] minute is to be able to tell this story
[1:02:20] and walk right through it and today I
[1:02:24] want to ask you a question
[1:02:25] when we go through this and we may not
[1:02:28] get maybe even the sanctification but
[1:02:29] anyway I want you to say be able to say
[1:02:33] that happened to me you should have
[1:02:35] already said that if not then I drew you
[1:02:39] when you start on your little journey
[1:02:41] today if God is talking to you today I
[1:02:45] want you to get up now not get up out of
[1:02:49] church and leave but when you leave this
[1:02:57] building go to another country in God
[1:03:02] not another country but you understand
[1:03:05] what I mean because God is calling you I
[1:03:07] was reading heaven oh this book he gave
[1:03:11] me a long time ago back in 2007 I really
[1:03:15] had to open up much anybody ever read
[1:03:17] this what brother Brown was talking
[1:03:18] about here he's a little testimony about
[1:03:22] how God saved him you ought to read that
[1:03:25] that's real interesting and you know
[1:03:27] what he's a prophet but he's pretty
[1:03:28] simple about how God you know even a
[1:03:33] prophet God had to call him for years
[1:03:36] years years he called him he called him
[1:03:41] when he was 6 when he was about 10 when
[1:03:46] he was 14 years old and he got shot up
[1:03:48] and he was about ready to die he thought
[1:03:50] he was going to hell remember he thought
[1:03:51] he's dying that wasn't it either he kept
[1:03:54] going on read this little book but he
[1:03:57] said God's gonna call you for you last
[1:03:58] time he's long-suffering that's what I
[1:04:01] said about Abram he may have called
[1:04:03] Abram Abram was 75 when he left he may
[1:04:06] be like some of us a little slowly man
[1:04:08] starting when he was 20 but listen God
[1:04:12] knows if you'll answer or not so if God
[1:04:16] knows and he's made the promise the end
[1:04:19] between doesn't matter that's what we
[1:04:22] love about predestination how that God
[1:04:24] knows what you'll choose
[1:04:27] and knowing what you choose he can be
[1:04:29] long-suffering because you and I don't
[1:04:32] but we've got to make a choice to get up
[1:04:36] because the Lord plagued Pharaoh because
[1:04:41] of Sarah Abraham Abraham's wife now look
[1:04:45] in chapter 13 let's start here again
[1:04:50] chapter 13 and Abram went up out of
[1:05:01] Egypt so Abram now Abram gets a
[1:05:03] revelation and he gets ready to move
[1:05:06] okay I got that okay
[1:05:09] a neighbor went up out of Egypt he and
[1:05:11] his wife and all that he had he took a
[1:05:13] lot with him and Abram was very rich
[1:05:17] somewhere in there God's blessed him
[1:05:19] Abram was very rich in cattle and silver
[1:05:22] and in gold he wasn't a dummy I'm
[1:05:26] telling you folks God don't call I'm not
[1:05:28] belittling I'm not coming
[1:05:31] human ignorant sin human not knowing
[1:05:33] things spiritually minded people God
[1:05:36] loves to deal with even when you were
[1:05:40] doing what you were doing God still knew
[1:05:44] what that man right there was gonna do
[1:05:47] therefore he kept dealing with him and
[1:05:49] kept dealing with him and kept dealer
[1:05:52] same way without he just kept dealing
[1:05:55] and kept dealing same way brother
[1:05:58] Branham started six years old he's a
[1:06:00] prophet and he's 14 years old and older
[1:06:04] before he gets born again he's up close
[1:06:07] to 18 years old I think because God
[1:06:10] keeps calling him hey listen he was six
[1:06:12] years old he was standing under a tree
[1:06:13] and he looks up and the trees swirling
[1:06:16] and he said this man's voices don't
[1:06:18] smoke don't drink her to follow your
[1:06:20] body I've got something waiting on you
[1:06:22] waiting for you in other words in your
[1:06:24] life try that out at 6 years old you 8
[1:06:29] remember he said he wouldn't even go up
[1:06:31] on that tree no more memory we walked
[1:06:33] all the way around that tree cuz they
[1:06:35] thought that man was up in there but it
[1:06:36] was God talking to him but listen God
[1:06:39] knows look
[1:06:41] God knew Abraham's journey God knows
[1:06:44] your journey everyone was very rich in
[1:06:47] cattle of silver and gold and he went on
[1:06:49] his journeys from South even to Bethel
[1:06:52] which the house of God bred unto the
[1:06:54] place of where his tent had been at the
[1:06:57] beginning brings him right back he's
[1:07:02] going to bring you right back until the
[1:07:06] place where his tent had been at the
[1:07:07] beginning between Bethel and high to the
[1:07:10] place of the altar he takes you right
[1:07:15] back to where you started and if you
[1:07:19] look folks if you built an altar there
[1:07:25] you're the one that left God okay
[1:07:29] you left God went to each of them you
[1:07:31] went to this you give you a wife away
[1:07:32] and you lied but what did God do he
[1:07:34] brought you right back to that testimony
[1:07:37] of the rock pile that you had first he
[1:07:40] brought you right back to there and he
[1:07:42] brought Abraham right back to that place
[1:07:44] right to Bethel bath l which is going to
[1:07:47] be Bethlehem which is the house of God's
[1:07:50] bread where Jesus was born right that's
[1:07:53] why you look at Abram you look at our
[1:07:57] journey he was in the promised land the
[1:07:59] whole time he's didn't know it until the
[1:08:05] place of the altar which he had made
[1:08:07] that first now look what if Avery would
[1:08:09] have just went here and got into Canaan
[1:08:12] he saw us enough for me I don't have to
[1:08:14] do that and walked off now if God
[1:08:19] brought him right back to the same place
[1:08:20] he comes back to an empty spot but he
[1:08:24] knew that God he knew that he had put
[1:08:27] that pile of rocks he had made an altar
[1:08:30] I'm saying he made a promise to God now
[1:08:35] you didn't keep it but what did God do
[1:08:39] brought Rutan God brought him right back
[1:08:41] to the same place and said hey you you
[1:08:44] told me what you were gonna write here
[1:08:46] swear you were gonna change I brought
[1:08:49] you back to this place right here and I
[1:08:52] want you to do what you said to begin
[1:08:54] with
[1:08:55] I want you to change everybody got that
[1:08:58] say man until the place of the altar now
[1:09:02] watch watch what Abram did now how did
[1:09:07] Abram know the name of the Lord how did
[1:09:17] April know what his name was
[1:09:19] oh he knows them at the time is the guy
[1:09:23] that said I will I will do this I will
[1:09:26] do that I'm I will do this and I'll give
[1:09:28] you this and I'll give you that
[1:09:30] I believe Abram got a revelation
[1:09:34] I believe when you start in your
[1:09:36] justification journey what's the first
[1:09:37] thing you get a revelation of I need to
[1:09:40] be baptized not in a title that's not a
[1:09:45] name Abram got baptized in the name of
[1:09:49] the Lord Jesus Christ now he didn't
[1:09:51] physically you listen to me didn't
[1:09:53] physically you know that but he called
[1:09:55] on something he found something out he
[1:09:59] got a revelation in that journey where
[1:10:03] he went all the way around God took him
[1:10:05] right back to the place that he promised
[1:10:07] him and Abram began to call on his name
[1:10:11] he got a revelation he needed to be
[1:10:14] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:16] Christ amen
[1:10:18] I'm talking about Abram you cuz look
[1:10:21] water baptism don't save you does not
[1:10:23] make you Abraham you're still Abram
[1:10:28] thereby alright with that let me tell
[1:10:32] y'all something real quick brother joke
[1:10:34] Canada told me something a couple of
[1:10:36] months ago and I wished you'd all try it
[1:10:40] y'all go down at 12 o'clock and you go
[1:10:42] out at nine you eat bread you eat sugar
[1:10:46] you eat carbs and about two o'clock well
[1:10:50] actually about two about 3:10 those
[1:10:56] carbs turn into sugar and you don't
[1:11:00] fight it no more
[1:11:02] but you know what I've been doing
[1:11:04] brother Joe told me he said if you'll
[1:11:06] fast in between services I didn't need a
[1:11:08] thing in between services just drink
[1:11:09] some water and drink a little bit of
[1:11:10] sprite and I feel great even though I'm
[1:11:13] up here I still feel good
[1:11:16] stop eating between service restaurants
[1:11:23] will hate me for that
[1:11:25] but that's way it goes
[1:11:28] fight it fight that sugar demon but look
[1:11:36] everyone come to a place to where you
[1:11:37] started calling on the name of the Lord
[1:11:39] you see how his revelation is
[1:11:40] progressing I didn't have a clue that
[1:11:41] the guy was really that talked to me
[1:11:43] first said hey just get up and leave now
[1:11:46] he knows he's come back to a place of an
[1:11:48] altar that he'd made and God met him
[1:11:51] there and Abram called on the name of
[1:11:55] the Lord now look he says here's flight
[1:11:59] now here's light here's all that light
[1:12:01] which went with Abram had flocks and
[1:12:03] herds and tents and the land was not
[1:12:05] able to bear them now listen what land
[1:12:09] is he talking about sure he's talking
[1:12:12] about a natural land but what land is
[1:12:15] God talking about cuz right now you're
[1:12:19] having a fight there's God in there
[1:12:22] trying to get you on in your journey and
[1:12:24] there's a devil in there saying you
[1:12:25] don't need to go nowhere the land was
[1:12:29] not able to bear them so you're gonna
[1:12:32] have to lean one way or the other you're
[1:12:34] gonna have to take one or the other in
[1:12:37] your land and the land was not able to
[1:12:42] bear them that they might dwell together
[1:12:45] because remember we have to come through
[1:12:49] this walk into sanctification of what is
[1:12:51] sanctification cleaned and set aside for
[1:12:57] service a separation we're heading
[1:12:59] toward that now but now look because
[1:13:02] both of their substance was great so
[1:13:04] this could not dwell together there was
[1:13:05] a strike between the herdsmen of Abraham
[1:13:07] Abraham's cattle let me look there was a
[1:13:10] strife between the angels of God and the
[1:13:12] angels of the devil
[1:13:16] that's what that saying if you talk
[1:13:18] about your journey nothing some of us in
[1:13:22] here have cattle but some don't but he's
[1:13:25] talking about what the herdsman there
[1:13:26] was a strife between this new spirit
[1:13:30] that's trying to come on you am i okay
[1:13:33] with that and the one that you've
[1:13:35] yielded to all along lot and it was a
[1:13:41] strife between the two and there was
[1:13:44] people in the land that it's okay and
[1:13:46] Abel said unto lot let there be no
[1:13:49] strife I pray thee between me and thee
[1:13:53] you come to church you come to church
[1:13:57] and you bring the herdsmen of lot and
[1:13:59] you bring the herdsmen of Abram and
[1:14:03] right here is where you have your strife
[1:14:05] in this land right here it's just where
[1:14:08] your strife is is right here but now
[1:14:11] what's Abram said look I pray thee
[1:14:14] there's this going on between me and
[1:14:15] then between minding of my angels and
[1:14:18] your demons for their brethren it's not
[1:14:22] the whole land before they separate
[1:14:24] thyself just let go and let God let go
[1:14:33] of that land now look he gave him a
[1:14:37] choice and Locke chose Sodom Abram went
[1:14:44] the other direction that's our problem
[1:14:46] holder talking about yesterday so you
[1:14:48] know one can I not quit you know looking
[1:14:50] at this and look at that because you're
[1:14:52] yielding to the light you're leading
[1:14:54] into that lot demon I don't say lots of
[1:14:57] demon but you understand what I mean lot
[1:14:59] was always that sticker that that Abram
[1:15:02] should have got rid of a long time ago
[1:15:03] trust the same thing with me and you
[1:15:05] should get something we should have got
[1:15:06] rid of a long time ago cuz look what
[1:15:09] what he lifted up his eyes Oh April said
[1:15:13] is not the whole land before they
[1:15:15] separate thyself I pray thee from me
[1:15:20] resist the devil and he'll free flee
[1:15:23] from you that that's a real hard
[1:15:26] Scripture
[1:15:29] if thou won't take the left hand then
[1:15:33] I'll go right if you want to right I'll
[1:15:35] go left
[1:15:35] in other words I'm gonna make a decision
[1:15:37] that I don't want to deal with you
[1:15:42] anymore I don't wanna deal with you and
[1:15:46] your herdsmen anymore if you say you
[1:15:49] gonna go that way I'm going that way
[1:15:53] it's not the whole land before thee
[1:15:56] separate thyself I pray thee from me now
[1:15:59] we'll take the left I'll take the right
[1:16:00] now I've departed the right I'll take
[1:16:01] the left and Lotte lifted up his eyes
[1:16:04] and beheld all look the plains of Jordan
[1:16:08] now that's nice that it was well watered
[1:16:13] everywhere before before the Lord
[1:16:19] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah I believe
[1:16:22] that a lot would have had a revelation
[1:16:23] like Abram a band Abram you say rebel
[1:16:27] even Abram because lot chose that and
[1:16:33] Abram said go ahead you can have all
[1:16:39] that okay what do you say brother Wade
[1:16:42] well you know what it looks like
[1:16:43] hey brother Zack for example it looks
[1:16:45] like that when you want to separate that
[1:16:48] the devil gets all the good stuff hello
[1:16:51] the devil gets all the good stuff that's
[1:16:54] real green it's real exciting it's fun
[1:17:02] it's beautiful oh I'm gonna be in Jordan
[1:17:07] okay but look what he chose Sodom and
[1:17:13] Gomorrah the two most evil places on the
[1:17:18] face of the earth that's what the devil
[1:17:21] will always choose even as the Garden of
[1:17:27] the Lord always trying to get us all
[1:17:30] back to the garden to be like the land
[1:17:33] of Egypt then Locke chose him all the
[1:17:38] plains of Jordan and lot journeyed East
[1:17:40] and they separated themselves one from
[1:17:44] the other Abraham he got Kaman how that
[1:17:50] happened that's the Promised Land he
[1:17:55] even let the devil choose it and then
[1:17:56] that will choke he's always going to
[1:17:58] choose wrong the devil's always going to
[1:18:01] choose wrong if it's guarding the devil
[1:18:04] you know the Devils I was gonna choose
[1:18:06] wrong it may be pretty alive said it may
[1:18:08] be glamorous it may look good it may
[1:18:10] smell good it may act good but it's
[1:18:14] gonna be destroyed by fire and brimstone
[1:18:18] not too far from here and like journeys
[1:18:23] they separated so that in your journey
[1:18:26] with what your journey and justification
[1:18:29] your walk of your journey is you're
[1:18:31] walking in the land and you've got all
[1:18:35] this baggage behind you you've got a lot
[1:18:37] with you and all of a sudden you're
[1:18:39] gonna turn around and say look there's a
[1:18:41] real strife in this guy right here
[1:18:43] there's a division that needs to happen
[1:18:45] that's never happened before
[1:18:48] devil I took you with me even in
[1:18:50] justification brother Brett said the old
[1:18:55] root of evil still there that root of
[1:18:56] evil is the evil one he's on that
[1:19:00] journey with you listen he's not gonna
[1:19:02] leave you I like what brother Larry says
[1:19:04] brother Larry he'll shake my hand and
[1:19:05] say I'm leaving he said that's something
[1:19:08] the devil's not gonna ever do so Locke
[1:19:13] chose all the plains of Jordan and lot
[1:19:16] journeyed East and they separated so you
[1:19:18] got to come to a place listen if God's
[1:19:20] gonna take you into sanctification
[1:19:22] somewhere along the line you've got to
[1:19:24] separate from what you used to do if not
[1:19:28] he can't clean you and set you aside for
[1:19:32] service all right and Abram dwelt in the
[1:19:35] land of Canaan and a lot dwelled in the
[1:19:38] cities of the plain and pitched his tent
[1:19:41] towards Sodom but the men of Sodom were
[1:19:43] wicked and sinners before the Lord
[1:19:45] exceedingly see the party chose how
[1:19:48] about that and the Lord said unto Abram
[1:19:52] after that life
[1:19:54] if you'll notice God hadn't said much to
[1:19:56] him there for a little while you know
[1:19:58] why because God's gonna let you make the
[1:20:00] choice he's gonna let you make the
[1:20:03] choice you're gonna have to make a
[1:20:05] choice and when Abram made a choice and
[1:20:07] he went this way
[1:20:09] and lot went that way what's the first
[1:20:11] thing happened the Lord started talking
[1:20:14] to Abram again and the Lord said unto
[1:20:17] Abram after that lot was separated from
[1:20:19] him lift up now thine eyes and look from
[1:20:23] the place where you are now look where
[1:20:29] it was locked what was in the east he
[1:20:31] just said a lot lot was in eath but now
[1:20:34] watch what he's gonna and he took that
[1:20:35] place and that's it but watch what does
[1:20:41] a real son and daughter of God get Abram
[1:20:44] look North look South look East and look
[1:20:51] left for all the land which thou seest
[1:20:55] to thee will I give it and to thy seed
[1:20:58] forever for all the land which thou
[1:21:05] sayeth the I will give it into thy seed
[1:21:09] forever and I will make thy seed as the
[1:21:11] dust of the earth and he's giving him a
[1:21:13] natural brother Branham calls this the
[1:21:16] land grant this is the land grant all
[1:21:20] right because there's three sons named
[1:21:22] son of son of God son of man son of
[1:21:25] David but brother Brown brings one more
[1:21:27] in there son of Abraham the heir to the
[1:21:29] Royal grant coach truly this seed of
[1:21:32] Abraham is going to live in that place
[1:21:35] which is here remember brother Brown
[1:21:37] said Abraham was looking for a city
[1:21:39] whose builder and maker was God he's
[1:21:40] right there under feet he just didn't
[1:21:42] have an updated revelation well you know
[1:21:46] we get updated revelation Abram got one
[1:21:49] he didn't know who in the world was
[1:21:50] talking to him at first but all of a
[1:21:52] sudden he started calling him by name
[1:21:53] he's tasted calling the name of the Lord
[1:21:57] and I will make thy seed as the dust of
[1:22:00] the earth so that if a man can number
[1:22:02] the dust of the earth then shall thy
[1:22:04] seed also be numbered arise whoa
[1:22:08] through the land brother Branham says
[1:22:12] footprints means possession that's why
[1:22:18] you going over to the New Testament and
[1:22:20] you read the scripture where Paul says
[1:22:23] how beautiful are the feet of those who
[1:22:27] bring tight and glad tidings how
[1:22:29] beautiful we're gonna have foot washing
[1:22:32] in a little while how beautiful are the
[1:22:33] feet why because listen we get a land
[1:22:36] grant - it's this right here we get a
[1:22:41] city but he's telling Abram Abram walk
[1:22:44] wherever arise walk through the land in
[1:22:48] the length of it and the breadth of it
[1:22:50] for I will give it unto thee then a bro
[1:22:55] removed his tent now remember he keeps
[1:22:57] moving and came and dwelt in the plain
[1:23:00] of Mamre which is in Hebron Hebron
[1:23:04] Meade's seat of Association and II went
[1:23:08] to church in Hebron it's important to go
[1:23:13] to church if Abram everywhere he went
[1:23:16] made an altar and made a sacrifice to
[1:23:20] God it is a sacrifice to come to church
[1:23:23] and as of right now it's really a
[1:23:26] sacrifice for some of y'all to stay
[1:23:28] awake don't eat between sir and Abram
[1:23:37] removed his tent and came and dwelt in
[1:23:39] the plain of Mamre which is in Hebron
[1:23:41] and built there an altar until the Lord
[1:23:47] everybody got that same in possession
[1:23:53] now watch let's go to chapter 14 we're
[1:23:55] just gonna get the justification we'll
[1:23:56] stop now pick up the other two next
[1:23:58] Sunday alright let's go to chapter 14
[1:24:02] now look we'll just cover a few this and
[1:24:05] then we'll then we'll have communion
[1:24:06] foot washing and you came to pass in the
[1:24:09] days of whatever king it was and over
[1:24:11] King those word and whatever king those
[1:24:12] were that least made war with bera king
[1:24:15] of Sodom and burst camp Gomorrah now who
[1:24:17] was inside who was in Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:24:19] lot was all right now listen you got
[1:24:22] watch your type here and be careful so
[1:24:24] we'll look at it real quick all these
[1:24:25] were joined together in the Vale of
[1:24:27] Sodom which is the salt sea all right 12
[1:24:30] years they served these people and they
[1:24:32] rebelled and in the fourteenth year came
[1:24:34] whatever that guy's name is and the
[1:24:36] kings that were with him in other words
[1:24:37] what they do they went down and they go
[1:24:42] to verse 12 they took lot Abrams
[1:24:44] brothers son who dwelt in Sodom and his
[1:24:47] Goods and they departed and there came
[1:24:50] one that escaped and told Abram the
[1:24:51] Hebrew free dwelt in the plain of Mamre
[1:24:54] the Amorite now watch here's the grace
[1:24:56] of God lot go your way whatever it is
[1:25:02] you name your life today go home and
[1:25:06] name your lot okay because for some of
[1:25:09] us it is a lot but remember though Lots
[1:25:15] though the grace of God because remember
[1:25:18] you got to revert to the natural story
[1:25:21] of why Abram got lot out is because 8
[1:25:24] because lot was a type of the what he
[1:25:30] was kind of the in-between believer
[1:25:32] brother Brent said the denominational
[1:25:34] guy that still is going to make it
[1:25:39] the Bible said that the sins of Sodom
[1:25:42] vexed his righteous soul brother Brent
[1:25:44] said is to see other righteous so he
[1:25:46] just didn't have the same revelation
[1:25:47] that Abraham had all right so let's
[1:25:51] revert back now to the natural part
[1:25:53] because when Abram heard that his
[1:25:54] brother was taken captive he armed his
[1:25:56] trained servants born in his own house
[1:25:58] 304 sudents and and he divided himself
[1:26:00] against in other words he went down
[1:26:02] there and he helped out a brother
[1:26:06] because remember when you separate from
[1:26:08] these people and what goes down into
[1:26:11] wherever he's going
[1:26:12] sometimes that's your friends if I got
[1:26:16] that sometimes that's your friends that
[1:26:18] go that way and you see them get in
[1:26:20] trouble what's the first thing you do
[1:26:21] those that you trying to go save them
[1:26:24] you try to help them that's what Abram
[1:26:27] did to help his brother and he brought
[1:26:29] back all the goods now look let me tell
[1:26:32] you what happened here real quick
[1:26:36] in verse 17 now he brings everything
[1:26:39] back he don't ask nothing to nobody
[1:26:43] he don't want he don't want it like to
[1:26:46] give him anything he brought back all
[1:26:49] the goods he brought he restored him
[1:26:51] back everybody and the king of Sodom
[1:26:54] went out to meet him out to return from
[1:26:56] the slaughter of that king and that king
[1:26:58] in that King which was in the Kings Dale
[1:27:00] and look what happened because of
[1:27:03] Abraham's because of Abraham's belief in
[1:27:09] Abram seeing that God had led him
[1:27:12] somewhere God shows up even in his
[1:27:18] justification God shows up now who's
[1:27:23] Melchizedek brother I'm told tells us
[1:27:25] that Melchizedek is and I read you the
[1:27:28] quote and who's this milk is it brother
[1:27:29] branham said every son of the faith will
[1:27:31] take this journey in the final end time
[1:27:33] we'll take the same journey Abram took
[1:27:35] to Abraham because truly folks we're
[1:27:40] still in justification but to go to that
[1:27:42] next step of sanctification you got to
[1:27:44] meet God in a different way than you
[1:27:45] made him back then because if you don't
[1:27:49] go forward to know more about God you
[1:27:56] know what justification is to me it's a
[1:27:58] proving ground
[1:27:59] it's a proving ground you think about
[1:28:03] that in your journey
[1:28:04] it's a proving ground because God's
[1:28:05] going to try you the devil is definitely
[1:28:08] gonna turn all his guns on you because
[1:28:10] he's lost he hey when he lost me he lost
[1:28:13] his best guy I was number one soldier
[1:28:16] man so were you right and he want to
[1:28:19] lose you so he went after you but look
[1:28:23] what happens right before now we're
[1:28:24] getting we're gonna get we're gonna stop
[1:28:25] right here
[1:28:26] it's just 3:30 chapter 15 begins to walk
[1:28:30] of sanctification for Abram look who he
[1:28:33] meets right before he transitions into
[1:28:36] that next journey part of his journey
[1:28:38] Melchizedek comes to him and gives him
[1:28:43] brother man said and offers him
[1:28:45] communion
[1:28:46] now that's natural communion and we're
[1:28:49] fixing to take natural communion but
[1:28:51] remember when we take natural communion
[1:28:53] are you thinking about bread and wine I
[1:28:55] hope you're not I hope you're thinking
[1:28:59] about the close communion that you're
[1:29:01] going to have that God said if you'll do
[1:29:03] this to like um this is communion
[1:29:07] we're communing with God now it's not
[1:29:10] the bread and the wine that's going to
[1:29:12] be turned into the body and blood of the
[1:29:14] Lord he said this is a symbol and
[1:29:17] symbolic today we're going to take the
[1:29:20] bread and wine take communion as a
[1:29:23] symbol that we've met God hello we met
[1:29:28] God if you haven't met God you don't
[1:29:31] need to thank him Union the Melchizedek
[1:29:35] king of Salem brought forth bread and
[1:29:36] wine he was the priest of the Most High
[1:29:38] God and He blessed him and he said look
[1:29:41] now wait a minute this is God
[1:29:44] pronouncing a blessing on Abram and he
[1:29:51] blessed him and said blessed be Abram of
[1:29:53] the Most High God my look he's getting
[1:29:57] closer listen God knows if your child to
[1:30:02] God or not and he thinks just as much of
[1:30:03] you in your little justification part as
[1:30:05] he does in your walk of fifty years
[1:30:08] because he knows you're gonna make it
[1:30:11] and he blessed him and said blessed be
[1:30:14] Abram of the Most High God possessor of
[1:30:17] heaven and earth remember when you first
[1:30:19] started in your journey real quick I did
[1:30:23] for six months after I come right here
[1:30:27] give my heart to God
[1:30:29] I went back in six months later walking
[1:30:32] in justification for that time I would
[1:30:35] ask God something and he would just
[1:30:37] absolutely bring it to me
[1:30:41] some of you why are you baby you had to
[1:30:47] be nurtured blessed be Abram
[1:30:55] blessed be extra the West restarting in
[1:31:00] their journey let's be whoever put you
[1:31:02] in the bless to be that part that's we
[1:31:04] said blessed be Abram possessor of what
[1:31:13] he's done given to you he's going
[1:31:19] through telling him I've already
[1:31:21] promised you this and now I'm showing up
[1:31:23] and you're probably you think it's the
[1:31:26] worst time of your life your friends
[1:31:28] don't want to have nothing to do with
[1:31:29] you and I'm gonna bless you
[1:31:35] possessor of heaven and earth and
[1:31:37] blessed be the Most High God was that
[1:31:40] delivered thine enemies into thy hand
[1:31:42] and he gave him ties of all I don't need
[1:31:48] to explain that one
[1:31:50] hey Utah now look keep going we'll
[1:31:55] finish right here and the king of Sodom
[1:31:56] said unto Abram give me the persons and
[1:31:58] take the goods and Avram said to the
[1:32:00] king of sodom i have lifted up my head
[1:32:03] in other words i didn't do this for you
[1:32:05] i did this for the lord what you do now
[1:32:11] in your Christian journey you don't do
[1:32:12] for you you don't do for the devil you
[1:32:14] do for the Lord and Abram said of the
[1:32:17] King I've lifted up my hand unto the
[1:32:20] Lord the Most High God the possessor of
[1:32:23] heaven and earth that I will not take
[1:32:26] from a thread even to shoot you listen
[1:32:30] I'm in a journey I don't need all this
[1:32:33] baggage I don't need this I'm blessed
[1:32:37] blessed be Abram you know what he was
[1:32:43] saying sorry King I know you're a king
[1:32:47] but you can't give me what God can give
[1:32:48] me
[1:32:50] you can't give me one guy and April said
[1:32:53] to the king I've lifted up my hand to
[1:32:55] the Lord the Most High God then I will
[1:32:58] not take the thread or shoelace I will
[1:32:59] not take anything that's that's done
[1:33:02] lest I should have say I have made Abram
[1:33:05] rich save only that which the young men
[1:33:08] have eaten and the portion of the men
[1:33:10] which went with him those people let
[1:33:12] them take their portion when you get
[1:33:17] into your journey your Abram and even in
[1:33:21] justification he had a pretty good run
[1:33:23] but he did make mistakes he did bring a
[1:33:27] lot with him but even in bringing all
[1:33:32] that with him God still in his journey
[1:33:34] God is in all right Abram you're blessed
[1:33:39] you're blessed listen for God to just
[1:33:42] call your name you're blessed for God to
[1:33:45] just call you into this journey you are
[1:33:48] a blessed person most of the nine
[1:33:53] billion people on this earth will never
[1:33:56] get that blessing never get a possession
[1:33:59] never get eternal life never get to come
[1:34:02] back and live on this land right here
[1:34:04] because you gave him this land first
[1:34:07] once you give him this land he says okay
[1:34:11] you're a son of Abraham I gave Abraham
[1:34:13] the land so if you're a son of Abraham
[1:34:14] you're there and you get what Abraham
[1:34:19] and we even got out of Abram yet but
[1:34:22] you're gonna get I want to read them I
[1:34:24] want to read two quotes and then we'll
[1:34:26] let's stand to our feet you want to do
[1:34:28] them okay and we'll get ready to take
[1:34:33] communion if you want to I know we'll
[1:34:36] we're just going to let the communion
[1:34:38] service be the healing service anybody's
[1:34:41] got a physical need or a spiritual need
[1:34:43] while we're taking communion we've seen
[1:34:46] people physically healed from taking
[1:34:49] communion
[1:34:52] so that's gonna be our altar call yes
[1:34:55] y'all come on up here and get ready for
[1:34:56] the community let me read these two
[1:34:58] quotes Abraham's grace covenant 1961 if
[1:35:03] you want to pull those up brothers
[1:35:04] thinking how they said no wait what's he
[1:35:06] doing he's shown to Abraham this what
[1:35:09] he's going to do to Abraham's seed now
[1:35:11] what was he on the road after Abram
[1:35:13] after that he'd been justified
[1:35:16] sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost in
[1:35:18] types and shadows because remember
[1:35:20] Abraham never received the baptism the
[1:35:21] Holy Ghost because it couldn't but he
[1:35:23] did typify all that we just now did not
[1:35:27] read you the first few chapters of Abram
[1:35:29] and there was your justification and you
[1:35:32] say that's right that happened to me
[1:35:34] that's right that happened to me that's
[1:35:36] right that happened to me if you can say
[1:35:38] that then you've truly went through
[1:35:40] justification if you had a Niger you to
[1:35:44] ask God today to start taking you
[1:35:47] through that journey and have been
[1:35:49] placed in he came he was given a sign at
[1:35:51] the end that the end was at hand
[1:35:53] he came down and destroyed Sodom but I
[1:35:55] want you to see that let's go to the
[1:35:56] next quote number three real quick
[1:35:58] this is Abraham's grace covenant 1961
[1:36:02] same same one he's doing the same thing
[1:36:07] to the seed of Abraham let's go down
[1:36:09] here now we're all seed of Abraham right
[1:36:12] we're all seed of Abraham
[1:36:15] we're not seed of Abram we're seeing a
[1:36:17] Baberaham right and they don't recognize
[1:36:20] it brethren see what I mean
[1:36:22] justification sanctification baptism the
[1:36:24] Holy Ghost placing of the son see we got
[1:36:26] to continue to get into that because you
[1:36:28] keep going on up even when when Abram
[1:36:33] comes Abraham comes to name chains and
[1:36:35] body chains and circumcision or
[1:36:37] circumcision in the body he goes on up
[1:36:40] to the air being obedient to God with
[1:36:44] Isaac and doing all these things God
[1:36:46] dwelling in his church human flesh
[1:36:48] eating drinking like man the holy spirit
[1:36:51] God Himself dwelling in the sons of
[1:36:53] Abraham manifesting the same thing that
[1:36:56] Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:36:57] Sodom chokes you up being the coming of
[1:36:59] the Son of Man that's where brother
[1:37:01] Berman gets that quote where he says
[1:37:02] that every son of the faith will take a
[1:37:04] final
[1:37:04] journey because Bible says as in the
[1:37:06] days of Sodom so shall be in the coming
[1:37:08] of the Son of Man and so we're in that
[1:37:10] coming of the Son of Man and man we're
[1:37:14] way into our journey but maybe we should
[1:37:16] revisit that and maybe you should go
[1:37:18] home today and read those first few
[1:37:21] chapters again and see what happened to
[1:37:23] Abram because if it don't type in a way
[1:37:25] how you came through your justification
[1:37:28] you didn't get it you can't come any
[1:37:32] other way because some of you were Amen
[1:37:36] cuz you know that's part of what you
[1:37:38] went through that connected with your
[1:37:40] journey some of you did not because if
[1:37:43] it's strange to you if it's strange to
[1:37:46] read the Bible and not see you in there
[1:37:48] and what God's doing during in your life
[1:37:50] you you definitely need a new birth and
[1:37:55] that's not a bad thing but at this late
[1:37:59] hour you better not dilly-dally around--
[1:38:01] make your calling and election sure
[1:38:04] let's read the scripture and go into the
[1:38:06] community
[1:38:08] first Corinthians 11 verse 23 for I've
[1:38:12] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:38:14] delivered unto you and this is Paul
[1:38:16] talking that's the same night that the
[1:38:22] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:38:23] was betrayed took bread when you're
[1:38:25] given thanks he break in and said take
[1:38:27] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:38:28] you this do in remembrance of me
[1:38:31] after the same manner also he took the
[1:38:33] cup when he had supped saying this cup
[1:38:35] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[1:38:38] ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance
[1:38:40] of me do you do that do you remember
[1:38:44] that night he's getting ready to die
[1:38:46] he's getting ready to give his life for
[1:38:47] you he's getting ready to have a they
[1:38:49] don't break his bones but his body is
[1:38:51] broke up fleshly cuts and all that just
[1:38:55] for me in you for as often as you eat
[1:38:58] this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:39:00] show the Lord's death till he comes
[1:39:01] wherefore whosoever shall eat of this
[1:39:03] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:39:05] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:39:07] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:39:09] examine himself Melchizedek came to
[1:39:14] Abram he must have examined itself he
[1:39:15] came to a place in this journey to where
[1:39:17] God was
[1:39:17] to both meet abram and feed him bread
[1:39:21] and wine okay I hope you're at that
[1:39:25] place now but let a man examine himself
[1:39:27] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:39:28] drink of that Cup for he that eateth and
[1:39:30] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:39:32] damnation to himself not discerning the
[1:39:34] Lord's body you remember when we were
[1:39:37] reading that you don't you don't see
[1:39:40] that Locke got any of that lot just got
[1:39:43] saved by his by his brother-in-law he
[1:39:47] didn't get to take communion it's not
[1:39:49] registered that he's why because this
[1:39:51] Abram is the one that God is dealing
[1:39:54] with all right not lot but let a man
[1:39:58] examine himself show him lady me to that
[1:40:00] bread and drink of that Cup for he that
[1:40:01] eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth
[1:40:02] and drinketh damnation to himself not
[1:40:04] discerning the Lord's body but this
[1:40:06] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:40:08] many sleep for if we would judge
[1:40:10] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:40:12] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:40:14] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:40:16] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:40:19] when you come together to eat tarry one
[1:40:21] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:40:23] him eat at home that you come not
[1:40:24] together unto condemnation and the rest
[1:40:26] all I said in order when I come let's
[1:40:29] take just a few moments of silent prayer
[1:40:31] reflection praying thanking God for what
[1:40:34] he has done for you and brother BAM told
[1:40:36] us one time he said while you're doing
[1:40:38] that he said pray for your pastor so
[1:40:41] takes time pray for your pastor and also
[1:40:43] pray that God will supernaturally bring
[1:40:47] something to you while you're taking
[1:40:48] this communion
[1:40:59] you
