the morning i turn my computer on and i go to voice of god i share it with mark the other day and i guess i use that thing like a horoscope in my life or whatever and i play that thing and i and i listen to it now what what has this got to do with my life today you know and it's the same thing going on this morning you know i mean this this ain't no mix up you know and so we're going to read the first and second chapter of psalms this morning and like i said we don't have a bulletin we don't know what's going to be preached but the songs that you sing and the scriptures that you read do they fit in with what's ministered and what's part of your life let's pray while we just praise you we thank you for this time set aside we actually go and be with those that can't be with us this

praying for his sake amen amen amen we're going to read this all the way through with last verse it's going to be 12 12th verse of the second chapter blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of scornful and he shall be like a tree planted by the river of water that bringeth forth his fruit in due in season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall process the shaft therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor centered in the congregation of righteousness why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things let us break their minds asunder and cast away their cords from us then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and begs them in his sore displeasure i will declare the decree the lord has said unto me thou art my son thy this day have i begotten thee thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel shall the lord with fear and rejoicing with tremble serve the lord with fear and rejoice in with trembling kiss the son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled like a little blessed are they all that put their trust in him amen and amen and amen maybe see amen be right here listening don't you we got a lot out sick today so we just pray that the lord will come and do what he said he sent his word and healed us delivered us from destruction so we believe that and we're glad to have our visitors with us we've got two or three that have never been here before and we always say to you welcome you come back you're just part of us all right so welcome to that you know uh sister anna sent canard sent a note and asked if anybody was planning to visit brother gary today please don't do it because that he and rebecca need to get some rest and also just you know don't go today if you can if you were planning on going don't try to go because they need some rest but gary's been having a lot of troubles you know he's been in the hospital three times recently they wanted to put him in yesterday but he told them no he wanted to go home and do some things you know to eat and to try to get some things balanced back up himself but just remember him he's really been having a horrible time you know with the breathing and all of the different things just keep him in your prayers all right we're glad to have brother forney with us he was planning on preaching for us this morning but he wasn't planning on preaching this afternoon so you'll have to pray for him about that because this old coughing and cold came back on me and got a lot of voice but he's going to preach this afternoon too so you know we just pray the lord would give him strength and glad for him to be here with us you know we had a good time fellowshipping together hunting didn't do much killing anything josiah he beat us all and he got him a doe and we're glad of it you know glad for him to to do that we just appreciate it all right let's just saying open the eyes and remember now this coming wednesday what's not service starting eight o'clock all right if you want to come about seven o'clock bring some food and things we generally do we have so little food beforehand and then we generally have some left over at the end that we don't have to go out into the world of all of the hoopla of the new year and we can sit down and and eat together and you know and take care of of just going into the new year all right so remember that this coming wednesday all right brother william borlavan brother sister monica's brother will be here ministering the lord willing all right let's sing open the eyes of my heart as brother forney comes to minister the word of the lord unto us right open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart foreign hallelujah jesus holy you are holy holy holy yes you're holy holy cow hallelujah praise god i want to see you lord thank the lord jesus this morning for being here uh we thank god uh that we can be down and have fellowship and service with you appreciate uh coming down and spending some time hunting and having a good time around the lord and appreciate uh spending a little time brother wade and he's he's a good cook and they gotta cook some ribs you can't meet your sons so we thank god and he we we haven't had a good time and the lord appreciate uh i was uh i actually brought sam you i was gonna do the evening yeah i was going to do the eating disorder myself i'm going to do the morning service and but we're going to say yesterday boy i said he had to be goddess i just started writing down another service another sermon i i wouldn't i just say well let me write this down and all of a sudden god got everything in control because i wasn't even thinking about it i just said i'm just gonna write this one down for a backup plan i had to use it this morning thank god but we thank the lord so this this morning i'm gonna go right to the word of god and i just trust god that we can say something to be a blessing to you this morning i'm gonna read in the scripture there's one from the book of saint matthew the 16 chapter saying matthew beginning at verse 15. actually i'll probably if he wrote it out i should have probably wrote all of it now uh i'm going to read just a little more than that i just had a few scriptures now but i'm going to read that and then we'll probably read the 17th verse as as well and maybe the 18th verse but i was i'm sorry i didn't do that you know i got my own way i write my notes down the man picked it up he said how did you use this i said because i don't matthew 16 verse 16 chapter verse 15 he says read like that he said to him but who say ye that i am and simon peter has to say thou the christ the son of the living god and then then he goes on here he said and jesus answered and said un unto him blessed are thy salmon born jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee thou are peter and up on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell uh the gate and build my church and and the gates of hell shall not be that shall not prevail against it in other words i'll give you this revelation and the gigs of hell shall not prevail against it and in other words then also it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever die shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven right and i want to read another place in the scripture revelation uh three and verse 20. amen and we ladies say behold i stand at the door and knock thank you jesus if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will suck with him and he with me let's pray oh god i just stretch you one more time to help me to yield my body my mind my spirit lord my soul to your god this morning father i give you all my script this morning i trust that you use it for your glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you this morning thank the lord there's a lot of demonic power sicknesses out there so we have to keep fighting and trying to keep ourselves under the blood and it just it's just a lot of sickness going on mine my granddaughters were said to be home this morning back down to about the myrtle beach area where the church my baby daughter live and my wife had to get up early she said she left out before six o'clock right after six and drove him all the way down so and so but you know by god grace we're still gonna get the victory i'm not gonna get my mind worried about sickness don't worry about healing i don't i'm a tight person i don't study i'm sick the people read all this stuff i want to know i don't need to know about it i need to know how to stay healed i mean you know i think god i didn't come here to study demonetia a demon power i couldn't understand the power of the holy ghost hello we thank the lord this morning so this morning i'm going to take a title this morning from that scripture right here i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice he said i would open and open the door i will come in to him and he suffered him and he with me and i took the title from now unlock god hallelujah and i reason i took this started because i realized here that god had been locked out not uh having been locked out uh people that in the church were going on and on and said we're gonna have church but to really they already god has never been in you cannot have churches have god being inside hallelujah the word so they say we gonna have a church but they have locked god out by some tradition about something that uh on something that do not give god the glory we call ourselves a religious nation but we have locked god out he's on the outside he's not in hell i was enjoying the sunday school lesson he just started using every quote i had wrote down i said man this but god if that goes to show this is not about one man hallelujah this is about the power of the holy ghost in control of his ministry how do you say brother said the bride will have the same mind saying the same thing how do god have called one man over here to have a different revelation with his one holy ghost how did that work i liked the brother wade brought it out this morning and it was real clear people said well they uh they didn't have the holy ghost and martin luther they didn't have the holy ghost and wesley by the way brothers and every age had a different holy ghost and underwear every hands had their own revival but the dividend would have lived as we begin to mature in the world the bride come to full adoption to full perfect revelation to change her body honey that's the only thing to do with her he gives us enough faith and enough revelation to change our bodies thank you lord hello begin to look at me i'm talking here he said look god out right here god been locked out and i began to take on these things i said you know we we we we're trying to find a way in the day that we we we even know that we're in the message but because you said i mean the message do not mean that god is in you all that mean that you've been around the message i need another one there was plenty of people that was in the message when moses got when moses was called on the scene to bring him out of egypt i knew that was in the message but when it was time to go across jordan they were not in the mission was not in them they come out but they didn't go in being in the message and when you come out in redemption at two points go come out and go into and they come and come out unto moses but they did not go into joshua hallelujah so we found her they would be uh they don't run so god was locked out right they had god they know what they were doing that was in the message but they never unlocked god honey that way because unlike god it's when they went into the cross over in the cave of land and took the land and eat the old corner of the land and god was in control hell they said we begin to go and look here so i begin to just think on the things i said so the job was at the crossover and our job of the day is to receive the baptism of the holy ghost honey and in the world you say i mean the full baptism oh my god and not just the anointing of the holy ghost but to live your life the literal person of jesus christ living on the inside of you the same yesterday today after amen right i begin another here i begin to realize here he said brother josie because people didn't know god and underwent people that knew god and then had had uh understanding how he uh uh uh who he was and this is jesus and everything when jesus was on earth that did not mean they were saying right come on how do you remember people saying the people that had it i had to do that i i i know god i i i i see god and i know we're here how did i know i'm saying that did not mean they would say that mean that they had a uh understanding or maybe had some knowledge of who he was but they could not be saying like brother that bloody saved him they could not be saved as long as jesus was on earth they could not be saved on the day of pentecost anyway that's the only way they could let god in so god walked with him in the bottom and he walked with him but on the day of pentecost he walked in so we begin to look here i begin to take these thoughts here and uh and uh uh beginning to look at these things here so i'll be thinking of what i'm gonna deal with because we are we are fighting the most religious they mighty they're into all ages how did that work so these engines that we fight against while people having so many problems so many battles and so many things are going wrong so many times get the holy ghost because you ain't gonna be able to handle the spirits we're dealing with the probably gonna use the quotation from future home i'm gonna use this here because we gotta understand what age we're living in so we can understand why we're going through these things that we're going through right i mean why i'm having these problems i'm having why don't you know your people trying and then somebody said brother when will i quit having evil thoughts i think when you die all right you can't stop a bird from flying over your head that's right honey but you could you can stop it for building the nest there it ain't no burning on land on my head and build a nest here if i can help it right you like walking around with a bird nest in your head i know right now right then you need to go get some mental health right right because he don't blow him on my head holy he said he goes to use his message in future home page 11 he says uh what does it mean then he said that stencils and sickness and death and politics people's politics ain't gonna fix nothing no no hell you're gonna read all your life and you're gonna try to believe all your life when i vote the right man in you when y'all i'm dead when you get the right man and he'll be in the handing hey you won't get the right man in this edge how did we go he said that sister right there is not a devil i believe that politics is sinful man and sinful women's right and evil smith will be all be yeah be uh all be gone and done away with and annihilate see it has to to be done that way because we are going to live right here we approve that by the bible right here here is where we are living where we live and notice thorns germs all sickness and things will be completely taken away all this and these are all this is it is ex let me see y'all i didn't existing that is in the earth now man-made system politics politics said kinds of evil spirits that have been that the world is terminated with and all the heaven above is above us here is terminated with evil spirits now we're going to we're going deep here then he said we're going deep here uh lord are we going deep and and long in in this sea then i dropped down a few other pages and then brandon began to say sir and he used it he used another page he was right on there he said both the heavens and the earth is terminated with devils that can't accuse her before god hallelujah before god and jesus ended up making an intercession what uh will jesus make his intercession for us see why the devil they keep pointing their fingers they did this they did that but the blood hallelujah that blood still comes anyway we are in a way we've got to fight against the power devils hallelujah i want to and something else i'm going to use another quotation hero and he uses here he he talks about the feasts of the trumpets and he began to talk about the depression that was on israel why because of those demons hitler was let loose at 200 thousand thousand dollars right they told me that the tormentor jews is here to fight the blind now and then when we and then what did he was saying here but i i demonic power is in the religious realm it's an ecclesiastical power realm ain't no supernatural devil how did we got two or two men devils to fight us every day maybe he said we would break down this attention every man might be fighting 200 devils a day extra i don't need no extra demons holy good lord but you if you're going to need extra demons you're going to be fighting against extra paddy minded power you're going to need our extra boost of revelation understanding honey that's why it took god to bring a word by to give us faith to stand against these demons i mean don't worry anyway so we got to understand here the things that we'll talk about you say what i'm going to do how can i how can i make this thing easy there's no easy way but i can say get born again how do you know you have to have a new birth to make it out of this age how did this is that nervous breakdown and every day why because demons is down accusing us right have you accusing us night and day before god holly and the point of it is if we don't realize who we are the devil gonna make us believe that we still is in that same condition right right right exactly i'm gonna take care of it now i didn't want to bring that out here before i start so i want you to realize this so we're in this uh we're in the battle so we fight it and we're going through trials and tribulations all the time and we try and people that they are giving up how they want they are giving up in the fight the reason people don't make it and hold on to the faith they're not willing to fight for it how do they want it to be easy but the problem because when we take the land and we will have to fight for every inch you got to fight against what you got to fight against depression you got to fight against demonic powers all kind of sure sign of depression you got to fight against hatred you got to fight against all these things if you want to land right back right hey you know you know the world show you nobody want to fight right in other words this is the age of layout let's see in this edge of relaxing and this red just self-living have put god kept god on the outside highly because nobody don't wanna i put forth a sacrifice i'll fight that way here hello there were you and what like he said the statue of a perfect man if you're going to get up there you got to be willing to fight right honey you got to read willing to say i'm going all the way and i'm going to receive what god got for me in the word how about people don't want to fight now honey uh second timothy two and verse four through seven how did paul say i have fought a good fight hallelujah i have fought a good fight in the world i am fight mother i am kept the faith right in other words why he had to fight he had to fight against a lot of spirits he had to fight against ray he had to fight against uh uh being bit by a beast he had to fight against hunger he had to fight but whatever he was power he had to fight against persecution he had to fight and fight against being rejected but paul did not give up right right hallelujah and in other words this is the end satan's job here is to make the people quit fighting and give up i like the way he says so something we begin to realize here as i begin to take this here right man using a quotation one time and i believe that he uh said it for a reason to show us what that we gonna have to take we're gonna have to take the left you said what brother jewel you say what do i have to fight you gotta fight to keep your hood anyway if if you know if something is not willing to fight for y'all you gotta fight for your stance right heaven to be the son of god you gotta let the world when you come down do you got to be willing to say uh i'm going to i'm going to stand for jesus and let the world go back hallelujah it's a fight to keep y'all staying in the fight to keep uh it's a fight to let the world know i'm not like the rest of the world i am a son and daughter of almighty god they might be able to disagree with you but i'm willing to fight for it right that's right hallelujah another word so we begin to look at what you know brother used a statement here and he was you it was a simple statement he says it's not the size of the dog in the fight right it's the size of the dog in the fight but it's the size of the fight that's in the dog in the world no matter how little hill but if he willing to fight to keep it the whole is a a position with christ so now we begin to go in here but i begin to think over here look how god for this age has been locked out how did i begin to think on these things here because why what is it the thing of it is that we are fighting against this day we find here that jesus said and and he i stand at the door and knock if you read on the previous said that he that was in an age that was rich and increased with goods and have needed nothing self-living hell actually smiling the peoples out right that was the day it's hard for young men to raise up and take a passing position because why it been too easy pressure come down he ready amen i can't deal with this how do you know why nobody will in the fight what are we going to do when he's older these old warriors start to die he gotta be raising them new warriors right holly we don't you say when the rapture be here now at 2 or 2 15. you say that you said that i'm not the point of a deal if god don't let it come in 215 it'll be a lot more people go drop off right they got people that are trying to make it happen according to their minds god is not concerned about time they're thinking about the people that study prophecy under moses and they probably had studied the prophecy that the israel was going to be deliberated in 400 years and they knew this should have not it didn't go 440 years right people's already said days 2 15 gonna wrap it up i don't know i'm not gonna saturday but i know one day if we go to two if we go to 3015 we ought to still be fighting all right we all still be fighting because god is gonna it's gonna happen right right but didn't put it in he people gotta be told in this world everybody's gonna totally reject god just not to be there right right you can see there's a rejection spirit here but i want you to notice here we talk about fighting for a minute why we need to fight we gotta we got to go through things and and that's what it did because of the way it is man have been given up right right if there were and to give up when you got revelation is actually when you give up when you got revelation and you say well i don't know god going to do this for me you actually have acne accepted accepting a delusion by the devil something that a spirit that makes you quit serving god is a delusion have caused you to surrender to another power that was not god hallelujah you said yeah you know he used the quotation of christ and missing god revealed failed he says and he was dealing with this we hear what because he realized a delusion is what put god on the outside right he says here if a man says he's born to get paid 34 of christ mr got revealed he said if a man says he's born again and try to place the promise of christ in the last day to some other age making him christ yesterday but not today making a different holy ghost right a different baptism of the holy ghost he ain't no good it ain't the same one how you making it if he was the holy ghost yesterday he'll be the holy ghost all the way through the book holy hell if he'd ever put forth another birth it'll be it'll bring the same baptism on the holy ghost hallelujah he says here make a new glass make him to somebody making him christ yesterday but not today that man or that person has been in a delusion by satan right satan spirits is to bring up the spirit of delusion a false idea a false a false or a false revelation a false a false seal hallel another word when satan saying you're making you think i don't got the holy ghost how did he got you under the power of delusion all right helen what are you doing he's keeping god locked out of your life because he know the holy ghost is the power of the holy ghost every video the prophet said as long as you confess i got the baptism of the holy ghost you got it right right but why so many people quit fighting oh well i don't think i got it well they look at that they're looking at the flesh they look at their mistake but they're not looking at the word the word says i got the holy ghost and i must keep my confession the same if i go through this trial if i have this problem come up i still got the holy ghost i'm going to keep fighting and i'm going to keep my confession until my body comes up into it hallelujah jesus he's a delusion by saying that if if that man says that he believed and that and it does not manifest himself through him then he quoted he if you notice here where mark 16 where he says that i'm trying to find it and jesus said in mark 16 these signs should do what hallelujah another word these signs your what you the brothers you the people said don't they talk so much intellectualism they think they're gonna fight the devil with justin cohen out there being able to quote the message you gotta be able to demonstrate the message you to know that god gave you power over a clean spirit how do you do it where are they people doing this everybody's doing but yeah they might be they might be doing this but they're not in the land right right they had crossed the majority yet but you with the baptism the only god these sides shall follow you that believe we don't have to take the devil we don't have to back up right right we back up because of delusions right right exactly right hallelujah these guys are following them that believe in my uh to all the world and to every age casting out what devils what we're dealing with whole time and the whole earth is terminated with demons sicknesses all kinds of diseases how what we gonna do go in the shell put ourselves in a capture honey like michael jackson yeah yeah they slept in a two with ah getting the perfect iron and the clean and all that that's good but i'm telling people i'm not gonna put myself on the bondage i'm not gonna walk around like well i'm never gonna walk around like scared to touch the doorknob i never walk around like with a candle i mean i do i believe we ought to take caution sure hey i believe we ought to take caution that is that and this human that just comes in but i'm not going to walk around like fear of what the only disease is coming on the world that i'm going to be one of them that gets struck with this plan when the bible says if i stay by the word i knew that none of these diseases they might try to become but they would not be able to prevail over me these are the words he said to everybody that never speak with speaking with terms all these great manifestations of gifts that would follow he said they they shall not uh they may not they may they may be they aren't you but they will and heaven and earth shall pass away but his word won't so he's telling us as long as you got the baptism of the holy ghost i don't care what the devil tried to say honey we will be able right hey you got to put it in your mind i will be able to take whatever that's come my way but we talking about here we're just talking about heroin god has been put on he's been put out he's been put out at the church right now right another word people said in the word just because everybody said lord why do i why did myself why do i have to go through so much to be a christian i'm going to tell you what like he said in the statue of a perfect man god god every man got a punch coming at him exactly you know saying you got a punch coming at you in the words and god's gonna see how you stand so now we go to the book of peter here it is he is teaching us peter was he was telling us this this word right here and this right here does not you've got to have a strong arm of faith to operate in this realm that peter's talking about uh first peter 4 verse 12. let me find that yeah first peter 4 verse 12 and verse 13 here watch what peter said first peter the fourth child he goes right here now he's telling us something that does not seem to come you know in our mind because we realize here this is what we don't want to go we don't want this to happen but it must happen holly and if it don't happen we ain't going to never get to where we want to go holy that way you said today what it is god got no grandchildren right god has no grand churches hallelujah it doesn't work you know my daughter's my daughter's is my problem i have a little problem with my daughter and because they saying dad when we was growing up we didn't get to jump on the couch we jumped on that counter we got snack down when the grandchildren's come over here they got candy on the couch they got crumbs on the count they jump on the couch and you don't do one thing about it tate scroll me right yeah paul says here beloved thinking not strange concerning what man trust oh but we this is what we don't want to do this is why god can't get in the church now hallelujah we go when a trial come in first thing you do i'm out of this church right here say ever since i got saved i'm going to do so many try people give up you know when people get baptized that is when the quickest time and one that is the most uh dangerous time of their life if you're not going to serve god don't go get baptized because once you get baptized you open yourself up you have opened yourself up for more devils to get in you all right if you're not really going to do it don't make a commitment like that come to get that time did not do it go all the way you are actually going to be worshipped right all right you know and the reason they don't go no further people don't move no because as soon as they do this they're going to get baptized like jesus you're like gonna do this you go through your you go to your desert experience and they feel like since i got baptized everything got worse i'm having worse battles than i ever had what did god do he proven do you really want it he proven that you're gonna keep your confession you know but i don't know in the word my mind seems like i'm having ever since i i i gave my heart to the lord i'm i'm going through worse of things than i ever been highly wise i'm going through this because god tried to get your wing from the boiler right honey you would not make this a rapture holy little demon or daddy you've got to meet god for yourself hallelujah amen glory ride he said thank you nothing's saying they cannot screen concerning the fiery trial is to do what try you yeah it's no way for me to get out of it there's no way for you to get out of it we're like he just preaching that we come into the statue of a man we're gonna have to come to a full adoption somewhere hell it's already been good we didn't walk through that we don't have a good we don't have that today that would have been pampered along with enough in this match when his sons of god gonna realize who they are right how did we serve you gonna realize him i'm a son of god and i let no demon power i'm letting no mind bottles i'm letting no depression i'm letting no anxiety take this out of my confession right right he says here and detroit you as though some strange thing happened unto you but this is right here i'm asking god to help me to get to this point right right i'm asking god to give me the script right hallelujah give me the script how do you know you know you know now you know it ain't nobody when trials hit you it's hard to say i want to rejoice honey so you know that could not be none of your virtues right how do you realize that is not a human virtue here this is not a human way to rejoice this has got to be something supernatural you're scared to do that and the only way you can do that you must be able to recognize who you are and why why are you going through this he's about to rejoice in so much as ye are partakers of christ's suffering right that when the but that when his he was using all this this morning i was thinking man he used the same thing as a whoa he was using these scriptures like this and it uh uh like in other words he said that some scream of christ suffered that when that when his glory shall be revealed that ye may be glad with exceedingly joy well i've got to go through this because christ is locked out until you go through this how there is a proving ground and you're going to be able to stand when the tests come how do you know it never would have been bad hallelujah got thrown in prison for something he did not do right children with the prison for a lie god should have took him out of prison why would god not stand behind it because god had a purpose and god knew that joseph had the right mental attitude toward the word of god even in prison i'm going to serve god honey even in my town i'm going to serve god but he went in prison and god bless the prison right right god in the world so now he says your brother what you tried to say i said you know what suffering do it reveals the true revelation suffering brings out you say that brother i'm preaching something in myself i mean i ain't gonna go around and pray for god to send a trial on me i ain't that dumb if it happened to me then it happened because god seen i have reached the level of maturity i could help it hallelujah but i'm not gonna go before time lord let the devil had a friend he prayed alone he he rejoiced he he was crying out to god god send the devil send the devil to me i think for you as one dumb dude he got what he acts about two months later he was holding i knew what was wrong with it he thought he wanted the devil he better let god make that decision but the point over here when you get to that place god will give you god that's the way god bring out the real you hallelujah he and he say another way to it bring that to real you that you would hey another word we got to have faith how are we going to be a faith in god if we don't go through something right and then when we go through something at the end of the day you look back and you find out that god never left you however when you way down in the valley you look back and you find out that god was standing beside you i'll be with you all the way to the end of the world hallelujah i'll never leave you i'll leave it but we begin to realize him but the problem is he said what kind of disease is in the church i said i said the disease of this age is amnesia spiritual amnesia right people that forgot people been in the message alone i never forgot what god come to do for how do god come to prove to the you that i don't care that we can beat the devil any place anywhere in the ground holly but the point of this amnesia telling us we can't do it right i forgot who i am how did i begin to realize him i'm gonna look at this agent for a minute find out what this edge is here we gotta we got a lot of we got we got by every circumstance it's as far as i'm concerned the full word have been preached until the full word have been preached holy in other words these guys that you find people that even peoples that have come in contact with the message have been able to take this message and make gain out of it because they got enough understanding in the word to preach and actually use that gift pervertedly to bring whatever they want to give look i just left a church in there's a church there's a church down in my town right now a man years ago was gavin they gave the message to this man a brother in our church gave him message books now this guy got a big church teaching them the serpent scene and the godhead right and also letting them have women preachers but what he done he would come in and realize that's that we had something and now he's using it for his glory just what brother wade was saying that a power now this important character is satanic it's not producing character it's producing knowledge and if you don't if they don't let that knowledge become life they're gonna actually condemn them right somebody they'll be going let me just say this so let's go and you look at nicodemus god was locked out when nicodemus met jesus he was locked out because nicodemus if you notice here nicodemus came he said lord he says no man can do these uh miracles except god be with him jesus went right to the new birth he went right to the new birth he's a god locked out of your life right hallelujah your understanding of what you've been taught he said actually god can't get in this he said you must be born again so he carried him to the new birth because he knew if nick and eva don't get born again it'll be impossible for him to stand against the towers that would get rid of faces but we're going to go in here looking i'm going to take another he said but i'm going to look at the excuse of the bride in a second here but the point of it is the bible says here that this suffering that we got that we got to go through this hour right is to do what to bring us to the revelation of obedience glory the bible said jesus learned he obedience by the things he suffered suffering is what teacher how to lean on god and not lean on ourselves all right in other words god if he didn't pull up he'd be don't pull the fire to the nest we're setting the messiness in this rot and all we'll say all our life i'm in the message huh and all you gotta do is believe that believe you're in the mess and you say no you gotta be willing to fight how they don't take the fight out of it but the point over there we got to fight our fighters that we we fighting against today is so uh it's so deceiving the way satan have uh and moved everything around we fight against little things and they call them little foxes little foxes is what we fight against something that seemed like there's really nothing wrong to do this but they'd been done over and over and over and over what does it do it's it's teaching us to lay down our weapons right and not fight right he said brother jewel let's look here let's look at a little fox real quick a little fox here something that was so simple but i said this is one of the strongest manifestation one of the strongest man of the station that i see amongst marriage message people i'm dealing with message people you say bro what you been talking about messing people i'm talking about missing people yeah i'm going to use one of the strongest demons that i find out domestic people use in other words you know it's a it's a it's a it's a way to cop out it's a way to not have to fight it's a way to lay down your weapon and sell them in the message hallelujah but i in other words let us see and know what we want we're going to deal with one of the strongest demons that i believe that that fight against massive people right now and i'm going to use that i'm going to use that up i'm going to use this uh a quote a scripture from the book of uh luke the 14th chapter and verse 17. i'm looking at that message people now we are we right at the time he said i stand at the door or not if any man open the door i'm gonna come in and everything so luke 17 him we finally we find this it's kind of coming to a time that never gonna we we're right at a match supper this is not this is not a this is not a morning meal this is an evening meal this is when the egg got skin on it chicken we right at that boy and then we might hear that he says that and he said unto a certain man and did he say a certain man making a great beast and being many and then he says and he sent and he and sent his servants i mean you know the morning i got up we hunting they i didn't really want no brothers i i got them got me a honey bun but last night buddy it was suppertime right man they throw them ribs on there man i was like wow man you can't be the supper man i don't wanna stop thinking about that let me show preacher i better preach myself hungry let me just leave that alone then the real just keep coming in my mind he says here and he said and it's summertime to say to them to them that that were that were ability to come for all things are what if it's ready that means that they were there the four edge of a full word be restored all things are ready so now this is when all the word is become fully word is ready the sales is open the word will be restored but the point of this the people is not ready for the fight so now we find her in in 18 verses says here and they with one consent begin to say and make what that is one of the most powerful words they've been used around the message everybody got an excuse why they don't serve god some say well i got to get a college degree i got to do this i'm saying well i ain't got time on i'm still young everybody got an excuse why they don't do what everybody got to excuse why they don't well i i would but you see this is that just it was all right you might have got by luther hitch right you might have gone by westlings but you will not get by in this edge right he says here and we make this d my this little word used used in the wrong way now there is circumstances don't get circumstances and excuses mixed up right there might be a circumstance to come up hallelujah that you cannot come and that's what circumstance but excuse me a devil doesn't put in your mind some way to get out of coming right now right don't let it be communion service he showed bring up a lot of excuses because there's a showdown find more excuses made on communion servant at any other time hallelujah but but let me leave that alone but but he says and when one can see it to make excuses the first said unto him i have brought a piece of ground and i must need to go and see it what kind of excuse you gonna do if i buy a piece of ground and i use this i might say this many times before it don't mind if i stay in church all day the ground has never got to be left right what kind of excuse it is and i'm not going to be dabbing the dumb enough to buy a piece of ground ain't seen no way somebody might be selling me a graveyard but people today you know they they buy themselves they didn't think later oh i don't know what i've been doing i'm not here with you they're done you don't actually you know the word that's illness i don't buy nothing i ain't saying i went i brought one thing i see and i brought a dog a dog on stupid dog a afghan and hound they called it and i knew when i looked at this dog he was not jumping he was not wagging his tail and this guy was i said what's wrong with him he's just tired he told me the dog was tired brother i said well i i ain't picking him up and i can't get my car whatever he do he would really die i put him in my car i said man i said i come home to my wife my wife come out there and look at it she said something wrong with that dog i said you didn't ain't nothing wrong with that dog because a man don't want that is one thing you don't want to hear a woman to say because she already thinking something wrong and i'm trying to convince myself he tired and i looked at my wife i said there ain't nothing wrong with that dog she said i think the dog is sick i said dog ain't sick and the devil kept saying you don't been tricked but anyway anyway after we i noticed i looked at his mouth and some white phone was coming out i said he must eat something bad i see he must have something got sick that's what it is so i went out there and i gave him some meat some good chicken real meat i gave it to him he might have took a couple bites he laid down i said man eat man eat i gave him some milk and all kinds of stuff he lay down the next morning i come back at the joke of a dead the dog had hormones i didn't know what hard work man showed me a dog for fifty dollars with homework hard work from that day to this day i have never brought another dog yeah excuses everybody but i just brought a piece of ground yeah and i must need to go see it brother said i ain't gonna be able to make it to church i just brought another piece of ground i ain't seen what it is but i i need to go see it how do you should have thought of that last week right right yeah but people what excuses them to keep you from hearing the word of god because they've come back here they might hear the word of god and say no to keep you from hearing the word right excuse me and then he said that no he said pray didn't help me excuse me and then another said i have brought five yolks of ox and i need to go and prove them i probably need to have me excuse so now this guy right here i see i'm sure you would accept that he is not going to buy no cows he didn't see he gonna probably go out there look at them calories before he buy them cow because he's gonna miss around let you sell him some calories with hard work i mean he get him home right soon to get home he got a bunch of infected cows and they all died overnight you all gonna be fighting the spirit of suicidal but here we are this guy right here gonna buy yoga cows or yogurt officers and he never even saw them i pray you help me execute everybody gotta excuse why they're not serving god everybody's gonna excuse not to hear the word we find today the problem you people don't wanna hear the word right that's right and another one saying the one that really need to be in church the one that really needs a prayer right and the other one says i have married a wife well you need to get injured as quick as possible cause you're gonna need it because when them test is coming she get to call you a big fat laser slob you better make sure you got tempers yeah yeah anyway because you're going everybody want marriage to be a romance oh he'd come out of the book and he brought me chocolates and and we went off on this big white chair drive and we live happily ever you better wake up it don't work that way in real life all right and she said and he said i am not a wife i'm not even gonna make no excuse i just got married man i'm not coming to church one year later he'll change that attitude right you know you know once the honeymoon right wake up once you what you really realize cause marriage is a test and if you're not willing to fight it won't work right marriage is a test right how do you say now you know what man said your brother i told the mother why i just showed them nothing like that yeah everybody wants every man want a perfect wife and they ask me what is the solution to get a perfect wife i say cut the tongue out she got her opinion she had to look at you there you go to me but the point of it is it's not that way right it's a fight to keep a marriage together it's a fight to keep yourself in the faith it's a fight for you to do whatever you do you might be willing to fight and suffer with christ to be able to do it he didn't win but excuses is the way to not suffer excuses is the way to give up all right i just can't do it myself i'm not willing i'm just gonna let down i'm just gonna i'm not even trying no more that's what kind of excuses coming up in this message and popping up they're all up here but now the danger part is once the word have been fully revealed to this edge you cannot get by with this romans 1 verse 20. want me to see we got too much light to try to use this for the excuse romans 1 verse 20. and they get that one we're gonna see why he says here this is paul speaking here in romans cause everybody got an excuse and they wanted to be excused but this is age you cannot get by with that right it might have worked it in westlings it might have worked in luther but it doesn't work today right he said for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly what and being under what by things that are made even his his what and what so that daniel went out what that is no excuse now you've got too much word you got too much revelation that try to find a way out right honey you better make sure you gotta it's something to come up that make sure you got it uh a good certain set but not an excuse in other words you know today i say you know people people get sick they get sick and when they're in their hears like this they'll get sick they won't come to church and they'll say well i was sick i would land at home and nobody come by and see me i said your problem is you ain't obeying the scripture don't get mad at brother sam if he didn't come by and see you a brother a brother brother wayne if he didn't come and see you because you ain't done your part right he don't say it for the elders of the church to come to see you it's like for you to call right if you want god if you want the man of god to come and pray for you you need to call him right so he could be in the scripture call for the elders of the church and they know what you do but people won't call right the excuse is they didn't never come and see me i'm quitting this shirt they didn't care about me yeah like the pastor got esp yeah like he know you laying home and people lay home they get a complaint then they get mad at the pastor right well i need it i've been down for months and my pastor didn't come and see me you'll be not for money and you didn't have enough faith to pick up a salvo excuses why we don't serve god right right that's what's been the biggest hindrance in this message now everybody got an excuse why they don't serve god everybody got the excuse why because nobody even willing to fight nobody willing to nobody willing to take go all the way with god and say lord i don't care what my trial is i don't care what come my way i'm not letting go of the word of god i'm going to fight forever in your ground that you gave me amen amen hallelujah i'm going to get look here will you brother way use that this morning because we're gonna have to go through these things people in other words if we can find some other way easy way it would be good and we can just wake up in the day and it was nothing everything was perfect man you never had to worry about no more trials you didn't have to worry about getting sick anymore and you know that would just be the perfect day never got gray with blue skies all the time that would be the perfect day oh brother i wish i could have that day you will in the millennia in a new earth but just it's not the day forward right heather you gonna have days they're gonna say they're gonna be days that we gotta deal with and then we and we gotta go through this this great amount of a great amount of uh pressure in that way so god got something he's trying to bring out of us hallelujah in other words it got to go through this because gold got to be trying to do fine how did the show is beauty got to go through some pressure hallelujah another word so he goes here he uses the quotation out of a uh uh uh the churchill book and brother wade read this this morning i just already had this wrote down how they said we're going to read it again saying he was dealing with suffering because suffering is not your enemy it brings you to your profession right right right see and that we didn't took suffering as an enemy yeah holly you know some people suffering so long and they they feel like well why i suffer so bad lord but down on the inside during the time you're going through your weakest time you find yourself praying more you find yourself when you're going through your greatest trial you're calling out to god and you and you and you're getting desperate with god how did what does god do he's bringing his cacti out of you right oh yeah stephanie seven i'm just gonna throw up the town i'm gonna quit the message ever since i've been in the mission all this hell is against me it folded me against you right now you're gonna take the devil anymore one group of people to death are having problem with now he hadn't brought with bribe people how they got bribed people was trying to obey the word and then he realized here like brother what he said he do not want you to get to your final death your adoption that a capstone revelation a divine love so you know he won't fight you he knows in you right but he he knew he knew as you begin to realize who you are and then you begin to mature in the word and then sooner or god got later put you up there right now honey brother said i got right here he said my god he said go back down he said god got to put you up right right man now we realize him so he goes on and says here on page 117 of church of the book he read that this morning and he was dealing about suffering i don't know what paragraph is about the miller he said unless we all we are let me read right here let me see let me find my place and then he used him yeah i didn't remember his why does it does he stand by the re why you know where to see this yeah that's it let me go i just read right here he said unless we do what right suffer a trial we all got them right your child might not be minds my eyes might not be yours but god knows what i need to perfect me and he know where they need to perfect you hallelujah in other words sometimes you say well my child what god gave me a wife and she always get on my nerves and i'm talented living with her and i'm out of here no that white might be your problem that god put there so you can learn to pray right exactly right you know what people don't do that the most time i'm out of here i'm not dealing with this stuff that's what you know why because we don't want to deal with it right you said bro you must have the perfect wife well when i first got saved i married the baptist yeah i come to the messy boy it was rough but i had to suffer that's right she got the holy ghost yes sir buddy we went through it buddy it was not only we we've been together january 33 years but we went through our trials and tribulations hallelujah because men hud did not see eyes on religion how does she feel like i'm saved don't matter i'm always safe i'll say no you ain't look at that world turning and guiding lightning and searching for tomorrow you've got some problems so she gets saved just give her a chance let her grow don't do that don't do the stupid thing i say i gotta say next week i kicked everything out those young people don't do that that was a stupid mistake right hey unless we suffer with him we cannot do what right and you have to do what how could god trust a man that didn't they hadn't been through a trial right right god prove a man in any way when god get a man you know if i'm gonna if i'm gonna deal with a doctor they're going to cut my body open i want to make sure i found a doctor that done done the surgery you ain't going around i'm not going to be searching for a man if there's going to be a real contingent service surgery he's going to do this on my heart or something like that i'm not gonna go get him he just graduated from college he ain't cutting my heart out right he's not experimenting he better be done done it you know that's the way people mind him because we want somebody that hasn't been through it somebody that's been under the operating pressure of doing this operation and been on a uh uh when they name doctors there's a lot of scratch when they don't operate and i've been under the stress of it right i want somebody to get in there and all of a sudden he said my heart landed on the table yeah i can't taste it nobody no you can't give up now that's exactly right well that would weigh people in the words so here and here in the world we have to summon the ring that's the reason the reason for this now the prophet answers the question right there's a reason for it will i be perfected oh yes by the time god gets through with you by the time you go through your trials by the time you have your test is here by the time you do it you'll be ready yeah all right he said he said for the reason the the reason for this is that character it simply is never without what right character is a what right a victory and not a gift a man without character cannot ring right because power apart from character is what we talked about there this morning everybody want to be going to church everybody want to say that in the message but when it's time to prove that in the message right why you think people walking away now because it's a time to prove or you're going to stand for jesus or you're going to go back to the world right that way we found out such a falling away today because pressure been put down and people were reading all kinds of junk off the internet and they began to make decisions do reasoning i don't know if this message right or not the point of this you ought to ask yourself did you have you received the holy ghost since you believed had god come into your life and not a book a person of jesus christ honey they're keeping you from day to day i didn't what have the message done for you i tried the baptism i tried the pentagon that didn't do nothing but when i met christ in this message i'm not basing it up on brother brandon i'm based on the goddess hallelujah abrasion upon the goddess how did that word anyway it did not it changed it did something on the inside of me how did it any any what man done it's what god has done my revelation didn't come by man and revelation come through god so this year anyway it went out without power without the suffering yeah i went to god i had to go through a lot of trials i've seen church splits i've seen this happen i see men's that i had confidence falling backslide oh yeah holy things happened in it but instead of drawing me away from god did they begin to draw me closer to god when people begin to turn the mess it down and and blaspheme the message on the internet and stuff these things did not draw me from god he they began to draw me closer to god because i realized that the word got to be crucified again right i realized that the word got to be rejected again and i'm looking at i'm looking at prophecy that people begin to turn the message down and begin to blaspheme god honestly not the man that's being the holy ghost right they deliver the word for this day i didn't realize here it's time to go home amen he said but power with character is fit to do what right and since we want to uh say we want us to show even even his throne on the same basis that he overcame overcame what overcame the principalities right jesus battle was just as much physical as they were spiritual he fighted just many spiritually with all oil for as many spiritual devils and he also fight in physical spirits right how does suffering have a lot of time we go through sickness and we go through weakness in our body but some faith on the inside keep driving us that is not you that keep coming back some people you see coming to church you'll be thinking why is he still coming because that's a power on the inside of him that has nothing to do with his human script that's the power of god that's driving him to this right side ain't no suffering going to turn him away from god hello he says jesus overcame to sit down with the father is wrong then we have overcame and sat down with him and then you know in other words these things right here that we're going through now we got we are getting ready to we are getting ready to realize here people we got to keep we cannot let excuses we got to realize here god needs to be unlocked harley i want to see god come back with the power in his holy ghost how do i want to know that god is real in my life it's so real holy without a shadow doubt hallelujah without any spiritual by any trial i go through and i know that god is still real and if you don't have that revelation something wrong with your faith we don't done all these things what have this message brought us to oh yeah oh hell we begin to throw in the towel because we realize the whole atmosphere is filled with devil demonic power people's people it's so much depression is on this edge demons of depression is strong when they ever be it's just hard to almost even have the joy so much depression right i lit half of it is the scarecrows and people got so many giants out there how do we oh oh brother you don't see what's happening here oh brother you have you read the newspaper have you seen what russia gonna do hello oh what are we gonna do well i did what i'm gonna do i'm gonna try to get myself in a channel with god so when the rapture take place i'll be ready because if i be here when russia drop a ball i can miss the rapture right that's right hallelujah if we read the message and get rid of all this garbage of the newspaper so much and believe what god said stand saying what the world's saying we got people still stuck in in the media oh yeah oh every time you turn around brother sam had you here they cannot do nothing i think the devil cannot do nothing he cannot take god man right until god you do with it and people are like oh i'm going into russia but i'm scared russian gonna drop a bomb now either one of the two it ain't no something that's a drunk sober man you either have faith believe you're going in the rapture or you ask you're just going to get blown up that means you're going through the tribulation right but i i i'm being by god grace as we begin to yield ourselves to the word of god god giving us faith and confidence that we are triggers of god that we will not go through that tribulation right i'm not fearing all this news stuff yeah that is not my battle that's about that's the world that's worried about that my mother's not i'm already sealed in christ i got the holy ghost and my holy ghost is giving me covenant that i by rapture faith we will be there but you know all these other things come up on earth and people in the message depression have literally man everywhere depression is becoming a god you know everybody just want to everywhere you go how's it wisey woo brother you just don't know what i'm going through man the devil just fight me all the time yeah join them i'm enjoying the crowd good grief every time i turn around the devil fight me and they're gonna keep fighting on me because he realized here he's gonna keep fighting he's gonna keep fighting but one day the battle is gonna be won the bible's already won but we ain't recognizing socially you know it in the word i'm trying to say if you expected things to become easy and if they easiness everywhere if we don't read been trained not to hold on to god why do you think today it's hard it's hard you you would not find uh uh uh uh uh this generation so to speak grow up to think like the old generation because you know why because we had to get up and had to hit it you had to work we had to work buddy you won't find too many young men like that yeah i'd like to hit it but you know what i'm saying you we had to get up we had to get it reading robert jack that way he probably been writing papa all his life and you know if papa's a working man i told brother i told brothers i told brother i said you know even i said one day my brother said you could tell he from an old school sickness or whatever you gonna get up and do something right hello but today what we done better i just i just looked at christmas eve it's just fun just you just you know what just thought about christmas eve go back 25 years ago on christmas morning you used to hear kids everywhere i heard by skateboards i helped it used to be packed my neighborhood would have been packed from every day what is it today hell you think about it i heard absolute i live in a big neighborhood i didn't hear one kid outside right all through the house not a preacher was stirring not even a kid and i'm thinking when's all the kids there this is christmas right i didn't see no big boxes outside full of bison and and little things like that why don't all the man need to be trash packed like this right well one people benefiting from the god man benefiting room but back satan is desensitizing the people right to softness that they won't know how to you know they don't want want to get out no more right i say you know you just think about how how weak the agent got right you think about how weak this is young god we have fell a long way right then with a man now he he won't he want his awful man helpful woman to really get married because everybody don't want to deal with it yeah right hey i date you when i ain't marrying you yeah i told a boy my son-in-law the first time he called me he told my baby daughter i said what you planning on doing about marriage he said brother i ain't ready to marry i said well brother you better not call my house no more why are you gonna date my daughter and you ain't thinking about mine that don't make sense yeah and any man that got his right mind won't let nobody date his daughter without him having a reason for it right right right yeah let me just quit by getting trouble but it's true feeling away why because it is nobody don't want to read about the responsibility i ain't feeding her you know what is your i'm seeing them lately this is my money if you're not going to do it then don't get married but the point of it is we find in the day i said there's no commitment nobody don't want to suffer nobody don't want to burn responsibility everybody say lord if if a little scratch comes into it they're ready to give up on god but it's a time for us to raise up young men young women and be daughters he out of the next generation right it's time for you to come to my life maturity i'm i'm ready to whatever you want god right i'll be willing to do and the musicians come this morning unlike god yes amen let god bring you to the revelation of maturity god wants us to be me as he wants us to be he wants us to grow he wants us to be women's we got to have a purpose my purpose is i'm going to serve god i don't care what comes to go me and my family we're going to serve god i went down to trinidad a few years ago and every boy in there was around 38 someone was 38 some of them was getting near their 40s and all these guys were talking about wait till i get my bachelor's a little art degree and this other guy would tell
