[32:29] house of the Lord if you'd like to turn
[32:30] in your scriptures turn back to where
[32:33] we've been reading Revelations 1 one of
[32:36] these days we'll quote thisen by heart
[32:38] and then we will go to Luke
[32:41] 1 Revelations one and Luke 1 there were
[32:46] actually 11 people that viewed this
[32:48] morning service and not five hallelu
[32:52] they were
[32:53] 11 Revelations 1 and Luke 1
[32:58] father we thank you for your love and
[33:00] your grace unto us we thank you for the
[33:02] day and the time that we have thank you
[33:04] for you Lord because without you there
[33:06] would be nothing here worth anything no
[33:09] matter if we owned the world whatever we
[33:11] had it wouldn't be worth anything
[33:13] whatsoever but yet Lord by you coming
[33:16] and being among us then we are the Bride
[33:19] of Jesus Christ and we thank you for
[33:22] giving us that opportunity because it is
[33:24] you that haveth made us and not we
[33:26] ourselves we we just commit everything
[33:29] now to you as we read your word you come
[33:31] and speak to our hearts that we may Lord
[33:34] be able to express what you've given
[33:37] unto us and that way then the people
[33:40] would have an opportunity to think on
[33:42] these things let your light shine Lord
[33:45] in each one because we believe truly
[33:47] that this is the hour to understand we
[33:50] love you and thank you in Jesus name
[33:52] amen amen Luke
[33:55] one
[33:58] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[34:01] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[34:03] things which must shortly come to pass
[34:05] and he sent and signified it by his
[34:07] Angel unto his servant John now remember
[34:10] what we've done all the time using this
[34:12] this is the key to understand the Bible
[34:15] cuz this is the way the Bible was
[34:16] written remember it had to be a
[34:19] revelation given to Moses to write the
[34:22] Book of Revelations I mean the Book of
[34:24] Genesis and see writing it he had to get
[34:27] that Revelation to write it so it had to
[34:29] come from an angel to Moses and then
[34:32] where' it come from the burning bush all
[34:33] right who bear record of the word of God
[34:36] and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of
[34:38] all things that he saw blessed is he
[34:40] that readeth and they that hear the
[34:42] words of this prophecy and keep those
[34:44] things which are written therein for the
[34:47] time is at hand now let's go over to
[34:50] Luke we're going to read about 11 verse
[34:53] 10 verses or something like that Luke 1
[34:56] begin beginning with verse
[35:02] 26 and in the sixth month the angel G
[35:05] was sent from God unto a city of Galilee
[35:07] named Nazareth unto a virgin espoused to
[35:10] a man whose name was Joseph of the House
[35:12] of David and the virgin's name was Mary
[35:15] and the angel came in unto her and said
[35:17] Hil th thou thou that art highly favored
[35:22] the Lord is with thee blessed art thou
[35:25] among women and when when she saw him
[35:28] she was troubled at his saying and cast
[35:30] in her mind what manner of salutation
[35:33] this should be and the angel said unto
[35:35] her fear not Mary for thou has found
[35:37] favor with God and behold Thou shalt
[35:39] conceive in thy wound and bring forth a
[35:42] son and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[35:45] now if you'll notice that's the one time
[35:48] that if you got a Scofield bible you'll
[35:50] see it totally italicize which means
[35:52] large letters you know all right and see
[35:56] then when you come on down reading
[35:57] you'll find it'll drop back down because
[36:00] this is an announcement see and call his
[36:02] name Jesus he shall be great and shall
[36:04] be called a son of the highest and the
[36:06] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[36:08] of his father David and he shall reign
[36:10] over the house of Jacob forever and of
[36:12] his kingdom there shall be no end then
[36:16] said Mary unto the angel how shall this
[36:19] be seeing I know not a man the angel
[36:22] answered and said unto her the Holy
[36:24] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[36:26] of the high shall overshadow thee and th
[36:29] therefore also th that Holy thing which
[36:32] shall be born of thee shall be called
[36:35] The Son of God you may be seated the
[36:38] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[36:41] the
[36:46] word now
[36:49] we've we've covered some things and we
[36:51] want to try to move on a little bit this
[36:55] afternoon and uh
[36:57] you know get on with the the thought
[36:59] we're trying to bring because this is
[37:02] not just to show you how smart and
[37:04] anyone is is to show you how wonderfully
[37:08] gracious God has been to you and I to
[37:10] reveal by way of a prophet Messenger to
[37:14] you and I the end time his word that he
[37:17] has sealed up from the foundation of the
[37:20] world right now we try not to back up
[37:23] very much but just a tad bit on to this
[37:25] morning we have been talking about that
[37:28] the angels of God are encamped about
[37:31] those who fear Him and that's more than
[37:34] one Angel we know that each Born Again
[37:36] believer has an angel and then uh you
[37:39] know the angels of God are encamped
[37:42] about us and they're there according to
[37:45] Hebrews 1 13 and 14 if they're they're
[37:49] to minister unto the IRS of Salvation so
[37:52] they have a job to do that's what I'm
[37:55] trying to get you to to realize and me
[37:57] to realize that uh not to just have to
[38:00] wait till we get up into heaven and be
[38:03] like the prophet said when we get there
[38:04] said angels will be uh real and we'll
[38:07] see them well why can't we see things
[38:10] here you know at least by the eye of
[38:13] faith and by understanding and and
[38:15] reading you know we can can read the
[38:18] word of God and then you'll read back
[38:20] there in the Old Testament and and it'll
[38:22] talk about the angel of God it'll talk
[38:24] about God or something who was it man
[38:26] and his wife was there at the place and
[38:29] and the angel came down and and talked
[38:32] with him and then he just went in Fire
[38:34] and and you know evidently done
[38:36] something going up and went right on out
[38:39] and they said uh you know we've been in
[38:42] the the presence of almighty god well
[38:45] see that was an angel that was sent unto
[38:47] them but they would call it almighty god
[38:50] well what's a problem with talking about
[38:52] angels and God in the relationship of
[38:55] what we're talking about or the way
[38:58] we're talking because um you know if an
[39:01] angel comes that's God sending that
[39:03] angel now there are fallen angels that
[39:06] come we sure don't want to get tied up
[39:08] into that part you know but the real
[39:10] angels come in the way you know they are
[39:12] real angels is how what they do with the
[39:15] word if a preacher preaches a message to
[39:18] you watch what he does with the word you
[39:21] know the church age Messengers we know
[39:23] that he was right because what because
[39:25] the way he brought the word right all
[39:27] right so then we've got a way to check
[39:29] it we check it out with the word well
[39:32] brother Dale I just take what brother
[39:34] Brown said amen now that's fine that's
[39:36] all right but what are you going to do
[39:39] with a lot of times when he says
[39:40] something in one place and it's
[39:41] seemingly somewhere else he says
[39:43] something
[39:44] else see are we going to just you know
[39:47] take well I believed him before the
[39:49] seals broke and I believed him after
[39:51] when when he said the white horse rider
[39:53] was the Holy Ghost I believed him and
[39:55] now I believe when he says the white
[39:57] horse rider is the Antichrist and you
[39:59] know see there's somewhere there that we
[40:01] need to get a balanced uh diet in what
[40:05] we're doing to to be able to understand
[40:09] and watch it now this when we get into
[40:13] uh you know some of the message today
[40:16] watch that point of the brother randam
[40:19] could say one thing one place and
[40:21] another thing in another place and I
[40:23] believe they will be saying the same
[40:25] thing but it will say so
[40:28] contrary one to the other until the
[40:31] human mind see gets all
[40:34] confused and we try to figure it out and
[40:36] you'll never figure it out as I said
[40:39] there was Paul a trinitarian when he
[40:41] said the God and father of our Lord
[40:45] Jesus Christ it looks like five that he
[40:48] had going on but was he a trinitarian no
[40:51] no he was talking about one person but
[40:54] that one person had many many
[40:56] manifestations of himself we believe in
[40:59] one true and living God but we believe
[41:01] that that God has many forms are the
[41:03] word in morphe you know to change in
[41:06] form see and and that way we we look at
[41:09] it so remember then the forms are
[41:11] dealing with what is necessary for the
[41:15] time that we're there that will be and
[41:18] determine how the form of God will be
[41:21] dealing with each one of us I've got a
[41:22] little talk that I want to get to uh
[41:25] eventually
[41:27] on something and uh so just you know
[41:30] bear with me in what I'm trying to bring
[41:32] cuz I'm trying to bring us up to realize
[41:34] reality right of life here amen that's
[41:39] right everybody wants to talk about life
[41:42] there I want to talk about life here
[41:44] somewhere about 30 years ago I told you
[41:46] or maybe it might have been more I told
[41:48] you that I stopped trying to get to
[41:51] heaven I was trying to believe that
[41:53] heaven's got to come here to take me
[41:55] there right so I'm not worried about
[41:58] going to heaven I'm concerned with
[42:00] getting Heaven Here If Heaven comes here
[42:03] I ain't got to worry about it I got a
[42:05] trip going right you know everything
[42:07] will be all right okay but now we
[42:11] covered now over a couple of two or
[42:12] three
[42:13] messages that I'm trying to describe
[42:16] them in things that the angels of God
[42:19] they have specific and special jobs to
[42:22] do and and they don't argue with each
[42:25] other over it and and you know they're
[42:28] all into uh Unison into the to the one
[42:32] that is in full command which would be
[42:34] almighty God himself they they would be
[42:37] underneath him even I believe even the
[42:39] Devil the angels that are you know his
[42:43] angels the Fallen ones uh I believe that
[42:46] they like I said this morning if he
[42:47] can't get you with drinking that angel
[42:49] will just step back and say okay smoking
[42:52] Angel go get
[42:53] him you say well you just made making it
[42:56] like it there's well what are you making
[43:00] it you know what are what are you making
[43:03] it to be well it's just the holy spirit
[43:07] it's just you know well all right that's
[43:10] all right that's you have your way and
[43:12] I'll just keep going my way
[43:14] right now but watch the point now that
[43:18] we're going to get on and I want to make
[43:20] this point right
[43:21] here the angel Gabriel that came to Mary
[43:27] the angel Gabriel that came to Elizabeth
[43:30] back up prior to this in the same
[43:32] chapter
[43:33] M he never planted the seed into
[43:37] Elizabeth he couldn't do it he could
[43:40] only announce
[43:43] right the angel Gabriel never placed a
[43:47] seed within
[43:48] Mary no amen he just announced it right
[43:54] had she not said be it unto me according
[43:56] according to Thy
[43:58] word it would have not have been planted
[44:00] in no form right he says but the Holy
[44:03] Ghost will overshadow
[44:05] thee and the most
[44:08] high now will come on thee and you'll
[44:11] conceive right all right but see but the
[44:14] angel can
[44:15] announce
[44:17] sure it's a choice of you and I to say
[44:20] the same thing that Mary said right be
[44:23] it unto me according to Thy word right
[44:26] amen now let me believe it right if she
[44:30] hadn't believed
[44:31] it it would have been no no child born
[44:34] from her right but now we know that it
[44:36] was all in God's predestinated plan that
[44:39] he didn't choose two or three different
[44:42] women to to do he knew exactly what she
[44:44] was going to say well now he knows
[44:46] exactly what you're going to say Amen
[44:49] right he knows before that I ever preach
[44:51] this message what some of you are going
[44:53] to say about it cuz he knows what all of
[44:56] us is going to say about it right all
[44:58] right so why can't we believe it that
[45:01] way it's all in him he knows all about
[45:04] it amen all right but we saw now talking
[45:08] this morning that each one as I said has
[45:10] a special
[45:12] job and they they stand by that job and
[45:16] like I said about wormwood just using me
[45:18] destroy destroyed the water or washed it
[45:20] over right but now all that water still
[45:23] here and all that stuff is doing you see
[45:26] ah brother Dale it's just a moon well
[45:29] who controls the moon who controls the
[45:32] stars who controls all
[45:34] things I thought it was God that the
[45:37] scripture said he ler the prophet out of
[45:39] his hand went forth this you know to
[45:41] Creation right all
[45:44] right but see Gabriel being the
[45:46] announcing
[45:48] angel of a special event like the
[45:51] children of Israel in the their you know
[45:56] time and all and he goes down and he
[45:59] appears to Daniel and he tells Daniel
[46:02] what's going to happen from there all
[46:04] the way to the consummation that's right
[46:07] so he announces that he had a message to
[46:09] bring that's right you know we we think
[46:12] about angels and wondering then you know
[46:14] don't worry about it if they come they'
[46:16] got a message to deliver right so what
[46:19] we want to do is get the message right
[46:22] you know we can spend a lot of inflence
[46:24] over on the angel
[46:27] and and and miss the message that's what
[46:29] I do and why I believe in the Book of
[46:31] Revelations that people believe you know
[46:33] that that brother Brandon was the one
[46:35] that come to John on patmas well that's
[46:36] all right if it did but I don't put that
[46:39] emphasis on that I put the emphasis on
[46:41] the fact of what
[46:43] did Brother brand say to you and I amen
[46:47] that's
[46:48] right what was said to
[46:52] him that's to
[46:54] him it's what said to me and you amen by
[46:58] way of the holy spirit cuz he cannot do
[47:01] nothing but SE a
[47:02] seed he can't make it come up in our in
[47:05] our being without us being willing okay
[47:08] but see a special
[47:10] event or the coming of a special person
[47:13] like John the Baptist
[47:16] coming all right so Gabriel comes and
[47:19] tells you know Zacharias that you'll
[47:22] have a son and look he says your'll name
[47:24] in John
[47:27] right and see that's a wonderful thing
[47:30] because we find in the very next event
[47:33] that happens he comes to Mary Y and he
[47:38] tells her what who this will be but not
[47:42] only that he tells
[47:43] her his
[47:46] name his name is
[47:48] Jesus I said you look at it and you read
[47:51] it it'll be great big capital letters in
[47:53] a few minutes you look on down and read
[47:54] somewh else pretty close and it'll it'll
[47:57] say Jesus it'll be in small letters that
[47:59] has a meaning that's not there just as a
[48:03] playy and it's not uh just that you got
[48:06] to emphasize the capitalization of a
[48:08] name why didn't they capitalize all the
[48:10] rest of them where it says Jesus like I
[48:13] said we look in the book of of Hebrews
[48:15] and Hebrews 1 it said God in Sun time
[48:19] big capital letters you see well I just
[48:21] started a sentence well why not where
[48:23] over it says in the scripture when it
[48:25] 5:24 John anyhow where he said God is a
[48:28] spirit that's the start of a sentence
[48:30] why didn't they capitalize at those
[48:32] things are there not that we're
[48:36] theologians but they're there because th
[48:40] those theologians those writers the
[48:42] translators knew that had a special
[48:44] meaning to
[48:46] it right right something real for you
[48:49] and I to think about
[48:51] right and to look at all right but now
[48:55] we were covering this morning too about
[48:58] Michael Gabriel being the announcing
[49:01] Angel all right but then Michael he
[49:04] would be the angel to come and fight he
[49:06] fights for the children of Israel and he
[49:09] takes care of that you know and do it
[49:11] but who is it then on the fourth seal
[49:14] that your Prophet talked about the
[49:15] battle of Armageddon and he talks about
[49:18] it going on now in you and I right all
[49:22] right but now we know the battle of
[49:24] Armageddon will be over in the
[49:26] tribulation period and we'll be gone
[49:28] right so what is the prophet doing
[49:31] there's a spiritual battle of Armageddon
[49:33] taking place in you and I right what
[49:35] about the Statue of a perfect man
[49:39] amen see who's helping to build all of
[49:42] that and getting it together what about
[49:44] the message the prophet preach the
[49:45] greatest battle ever fought that's in
[49:47] your human mind and he
[49:50] said God and the devil is right there
[49:53] battling that's right so who's that
[49:55] Michael right yeah cuz he's the battling
[49:58] Angel he goes over in Revelations 12 and
[50:01] all and he cast Satan out cuz he's
[50:02] already done it I ain't figured out yet
[50:05] why the devil can't this side and say
[50:07] hey look let me quit and join the other
[50:09] side but he's not going to do
[50:12] it cuz he's going to keep trying because
[50:15] he thinks the more forces he
[50:18] gets the greater power he can do and the
[50:22] greater ability to be able to one day
[50:24] whip my
[50:26] right
[50:28] well I wish he'd listen to me one time
[50:30] and just decided it ain't going to
[50:32] happen but ain't going to change you cuz
[50:35] it ain't going to change you what I say
[50:38] if God don't speak to you and tell you
[50:40] what I'm talking about today you'll have
[50:42] some concocted idea of what I'm talking
[50:44] about right and ain't nothing I can do
[50:47] about it I realized that a long time ago
[50:49] brother Reed said brother Dale remember
[50:51] there are people listening make it as
[50:54] simple as you can
[50:56] because there are people listening that
[50:58] hasn't heard what you've heard well I
[51:01] try to do that and then making it as
[51:04] simple as I can and drawing it out to
[51:06] explain it then I come to the place a
[51:09] lot of times I think well I'm just
[51:11] really goofing off cuz I want to preach
[51:14] way on down the road somewhere you know
[51:16] I want to get this underway and and
[51:19] other things but can't do it all right
[51:22] but now listen we found this morning
[51:24] that my is Christ now he's not
[51:30] Jesus you don't don't connect it
[51:32] together as Jesus being Michael that's
[51:35] right it's the
[51:36] Christ the logos the Son of God that
[51:39] went out the part of God that went out
[51:40] in the beginning the creation and you
[51:43] see it all the way down through the Old
[51:46] Testament as the Christ the angel of the
[51:51] Covenant to lead the children of Israel
[51:54] the one that spoke to Moses from the
[51:56] burning bush
[51:58] yes that is Christ that's Michael all
[52:01] right and Michael is here now in you and
[52:05] I in the form of the baptism of the Holy
[52:07] Ghost because I believe Michael to be
[52:09] God Amen right amen he was a Son of God
[52:14] and the Son of God is God made manifest
[52:16] in another form right when that Halo
[52:19] light went out in the beginning and went
[52:21] over started creating that wasn't
[52:23] another
[52:24] God that was another form for man's
[52:28] ideas or comprehension that we would be
[52:31] able to you know try to understand
[52:33] what's going
[52:36] on but now keep in mind what we're
[52:38] trying to get
[52:40] at when Gabriel came to deliver the
[52:47] message
[52:49] to
[52:54] Mary
[52:55] that was when he was it took some time
[53:00] right we just read it as he said this
[53:03] now the other but it took some time for
[53:05] that to transpire that's right you know
[53:08] it wasn't just a two-c
[53:12] conversation it it took time for that to
[53:15] transpire for Mary to say be it unto me
[53:18] according to Thy
[53:19] word all right then the Holy Spirit
[53:22] comes and plants the seed it wasn't the
[53:25] angel that planted the seed that's
[53:30] right and it wasn't Jesus that come on
[53:33] the scene right there right right right
[53:36] amen right amen it's dealing with
[53:40] getting the baby here and then you're
[53:42] going to name him Jesus now watch these
[53:44] quotes in just a minute that your
[53:46] Prophet
[53:48] said now we know the name Jesus wasn't
[53:51] used now let me quote two things all
[53:53] right brother Ram said the word the name
[53:56] Jesus was used many times before it was
[53:59] ever put Upon Jesus there was many
[54:02] jesuses right all right now but then he
[54:06] turned around and he said see that name
[54:07] was never
[54:11] pronounced and he said even though the
[54:13] angel pronounced it to
[54:18] Mary that angel told Mary that Elizabeth
[54:22] was
[54:24] pregnant
[54:26] right
[54:28] but he didn't bring life to
[54:32] John because the angel pronounced it
[54:37] right but when Mary went to
[54:40] Elizabeth and said
[54:43] Jesus CU it's got to be in the body of
[54:45] Christ you know the the the the
[54:47] Believers all right now but watch it
[54:54] now when that angel said
[54:59] Jesus brother around said those
[55:03] prophets had said Jesus
[55:11] before no no no no no well okay I'm glad
[55:15] to be able to read you know so let's
[55:19] start reading a little let's just see
[55:22] what your Prophet had to
[55:24] say
[55:28] yeah paragraph 44 number 1 a of your
[55:31] notes when you
[55:32] start God's chosen place of worship
[55:36] 6502
[55:38] 220 now we find out that Jesus said also
[55:42] I came in my father's name and you
[55:44] receive me not then the name of the
[55:47] father must be
[55:49] Jesus that's right the name of the
[55:53] father is Jesus because Jesus said to
[55:55] them I
[55:58] carry my father's
[56:01] name and somebody on tap for somebody
[56:03] here that they may like no you miss no
[56:04] that's what brother R said he said I
[56:06] carry my father's name I come in my
[56:09] father's name and you receive me not
[56:11] then his name was Jesus and Gabriel
[56:14] called him
[56:15] Jesus the prophets called him
[56:21] Jesus Now where's there any Prophet Old
[56:24] Testament
[56:26] that ever use the word
[56:28] Jesus so now don't lock your horns oh
[56:33] up the prophets called him
[56:36] Jesus and he was absolutely Jesus before
[56:40] his
[56:41] birth even the holy prophet called his
[56:44] name Emmanuel which is God With Us Now
[56:47] what is that that's
[56:51] Jesus because the word Jesus comes from
[56:54] the word Joshua Jehovah Savior and
[56:56] coming
[56:58] down but they never they couldn't
[57:00] pronounce the name because it was
[57:03] jvh and brother random at times we reuse
[57:05] JV hu but it's basically jvh V which is
[57:10] no vowel so they couldn't pronounce it
[57:11] so it added vows and they made it
[57:14] Jehovah but there's a scripture there in
[57:16] the Old Testament said by my name
[57:18] Jehovah was I never
[57:21] known because he couldn't pronounce it
[57:24] what was his name name
[57:27] Jesus boy you got a ninth grade
[57:29] education and you know more than the
[57:31] scholars well
[57:33] amen right don't you right we just read
[57:36] his name is Jesus by a prophet right yep
[57:41] see they didn't pronounce it Jesus they
[57:43] pronounced it Emmanuel they pronounced
[57:46] it Jehovah they would pronounce it maybe
[57:48] Yahweh or or Elohim or God or whatever
[57:54] but his name was Jes Jesus it didn't
[57:55] change the only name God ever had is
[57:59] Jesus all
[58:00] right so now you reading you read with
[58:03] your prophet and get what he said those
[58:05] prophets called him
[58:08] Jesus why because in that name Jesus is
[58:11] everything that we have need of
[58:15] right and surely he is
[58:20] Emmanuel look what he goes on down the
[58:23] second paragraph of the same message
[58:25] we find out then he comes the place of
[58:28] God's worship
[58:29] where that he becomes the place of God's
[58:32] worship where you worship him ever
[58:34] before he was even born his name was
[58:37] called
[58:40] Jesus it was so
[58:42] important it was given to his mother by
[58:45] the angel Gabriel that his name would be
[58:47] called Jesus Son of God what he
[58:52] was tell what I'm I'm so glad to have a
[58:55] prophet that I can go back amen right
[58:59] you know and then depend upon what he's
[59:02] saying but pray for
[59:05] Revelation well brother I don't
[59:07] understand how well you're going to
[59:09] argue with brother brandham then you're
[59:11] not arguing with me I'm just reading a
[59:15] quote read it for
[59:17] yourself but pray for a
[59:20] revelation pray that God will open our
[59:23] understanding
[59:25] okay so then what is it now not it just
[59:30] announcing the coming of a
[59:32] child but announcing that very Eternal
[59:36] Elohim self-existing almighty
[59:40] God Emmanuel is going to be
[59:43] born the angel Gabriel was chosen for
[59:47] that purpose to announce that unto Mary
[59:52] and he says you'll call his name Jesus
[59:57] right and like I said his name's been
[1:00:00] they've been spoken many times before
[1:00:02] Yus or jzo whever how you say it in
[1:00:04] Spanish and and all the others you know
[1:00:07] there was many jesuses in the days of
[1:00:11] Jesus probably a lot of people running
[1:00:13] around that their name was literally
[1:00:16] Jesus but there's never been but one
[1:00:19] God and brother R said like this he said
[1:00:22] there never been but one Lord Jesus
[1:00:23] Christ that's right
[1:00:25] now who was Gabriel telling Mary she was
[1:00:27] going to give birth
[1:00:31] to to the Lord Jesus
[1:00:37] Christ almighty God Emmanuel we can stay
[1:00:41] there for a week could we am well let's
[1:00:43] go
[1:00:44] on so Gabriel is to
[1:00:47] announce but now let me read what I got
[1:00:51] here if Michael don't come to back up up
[1:00:54] what Gabriel
[1:00:59] says then we would question
[1:01:05] Gabriel right so it's always the key to
[1:01:08] the whole Bible that God will come and
[1:01:10] back up his word right no matter where
[1:01:13] it's delivered by an Angel or what
[1:01:16] whoever or a mother to her children and
[1:01:19] and and uh I'm thinking of Moses sitting
[1:01:21] there and brother around said sitting on
[1:01:23] his mother's knee and she was telling
[1:01:25] him said you're not the son of Pharaoh's
[1:01:27] daughter right
[1:01:30] you he said well I got another quote
[1:01:33] Yeah there's another quote where he says
[1:01:34] about 16 years old before he found it
[1:01:38] out well how long did she stay there
[1:01:40] with him as a baby she might have stayed
[1:01:43] there till he was a couple of years old
[1:01:45] but after he got through nursing she was
[1:01:47] probably dismissed from the
[1:01:52] job I was 4 years old my father passed
[1:01:55] away and I cannot remember one thing
[1:01:57] about him a lot of people say I can
[1:01:59] remember this I can remember that
[1:02:00] brother brandham was something great
[1:02:01] when he said 18 years old I can remember
[1:02:03] the first thing was a vision crawling in
[1:02:06] eating I can't remember that
[1:02:09] way 18 months old okay all y'all put the
[1:02:14] dates to it I just trying to preach but
[1:02:19] listen his name was
[1:02:23] Jesus and that was what was
[1:02:27] delivered but get to
[1:02:30] Point even though Mary knew the
[1:02:33] name and knew what she was
[1:02:38] conceiving it took Christ to come on the
[1:02:42] scene speaking through
[1:02:46] her that she could go to
[1:02:49] Elizabeth and say his name is Jesus and
[1:02:51] a baby would come forth with life
[1:02:55] you might ought to write that down and
[1:02:56] think on it it's not just play and play
[1:02:59] pretty games we're here for a
[1:03:01] purpose his name is Jesus all right but
[1:03:05] now watch so let's get down to this
[1:03:07] Gabriel but let's make sure that we we
[1:03:11] uh deal it in a way that Christ will
[1:03:14] come on the scene because if he doesn't
[1:03:17] come on the scene to you know Michael
[1:03:19] Christ to vindicate what we're talking
[1:03:22] about then we've we just we're just
[1:03:24] talking that's right that's what a lot
[1:03:26] of people thinks it is they think going
[1:03:28] to church is just Ah that's your idea
[1:03:30] that's your opinion well we get there
[1:03:31] one you day you find it
[1:03:33] out you'll find out whether it was or
[1:03:35] not so I a worried about it you what is
[1:03:38] my
[1:03:40] concern you say well you know we don't
[1:03:43] know cuz brother random is not here to
[1:03:44] tell us oh my here he is right I just
[1:03:50] read you that he said his name is Jesus
[1:03:52] right what would he stand here and tell
[1:03:54] his name is
[1:03:55] Jesus all right but's see get on with it
[1:03:58] now but let's let's just go down to here
[1:04:00] on some things now and just listen to
[1:04:03] what was
[1:04:06] said brother r on the message of the
[1:04:09] Resurrection
[1:04:11] 53205 he said God always
[1:04:13] sends minor Angel well let's read the
[1:04:16] whole thing this priest standed there
[1:04:17] making his sacrifice which is was
[1:04:19] sacrifice on his right side appeared
[1:04:21] this great Angel the archangel always
[1:04:24] sends minor Angels but Gabriel announced
[1:04:27] the first coming of Christ and Gabriel
[1:04:31] will announce the second coming of
[1:04:32] Christ see the Archangel of God will
[1:04:37] announce the second coming of
[1:04:43] Christ now as I told you I know I know I
[1:04:47] got the quote so don't worry about it
[1:04:48] and get all excited Gabriel is to the
[1:04:52] Jews Messenger to the Jews that's all
[1:04:54] right cuz he does announce the first
[1:04:56] coming of Christ and he announces the
[1:04:58] second coming of Christ through through
[1:05:00] the two witnesses over there but let me
[1:05:03] ask you a simple couple of
[1:05:06] questions U the prophet would say one
[1:05:09] time he
[1:05:10] says those children of Israel will only
[1:05:14] believe their prophets you remember
[1:05:21] that well what about Elijah
[1:05:25] he was not a
[1:05:29] Jew they have no record they don't know
[1:05:31] where he come from I'm quoting brother
[1:05:33] Brandon all
[1:05:35] right he was a gentile
[1:05:39] right but Ed Israel still believed it
[1:05:43] just making a
[1:05:45] point all
[1:05:46] right
[1:05:49] now but when you come up now I wouldn't
[1:05:51] know about
[1:05:52] Elisha I would be 99% sure Elisha would
[1:05:56] be a
[1:05:57] Jew you
[1:06:00] know well we know for sure that John the
[1:06:02] Baptist
[1:06:04] was but yet he had the spirit of
[1:06:09] Elijah just making a
[1:06:13] point see we look at it and we think we
[1:06:15] got it all figured out because a lot uh
[1:06:17] the
[1:06:18] uh you know Gabriel is only to the Jews
[1:06:24] well I think the whole Bible is to the
[1:06:26] Gentile bright and for us to understand
[1:06:29] but just so you get that in your mind
[1:06:32] and you think on it you know you all
[1:06:35] right brother Brandon will call that
[1:06:37] angel that comes to him and I got him
[1:06:39] laid in my office if you want them I've
[1:06:41] given them to you he calls him a minor
[1:06:43] Angel the one that come to
[1:06:46] him but he calls him the healing
[1:06:49] Angel he calls him the angel of
[1:06:52] healing yep
[1:06:55] he didn't have no problem with making
[1:06:56] them
[1:06:57] statements ah he just done that brother
[1:06:59] Dale to confuse
[1:07:02] you well I'm just quoting
[1:07:07] him but
[1:07:09] listen Gabriel announced the first
[1:07:12] coming which was
[1:07:15] to Zacharias and then to elizabth
[1:07:20] right right but you better hold on a
[1:07:23] minute but
[1:07:26] because who
[1:07:29] then introduced
[1:07:40] Jesus B order to consider then and
[1:07:42] listen for a
[1:07:45] while all right I am the resurrection
[1:07:48] matter of fact brother Bram says this
[1:07:49] direct quote of the one who announced
[1:07:52] the first coming will announce the
[1:07:53] second second com and he used it 11
[1:07:55] times and you'll find about 20 something
[1:07:57] times or more than that if you'll just
[1:07:59] run in Gabriel and run in announcing or
[1:08:02] announcing Angel you'll find a whole lot
[1:08:04] of quotes I'll just give you a few just
[1:08:06] or that you can read it I am the
[1:08:09] resurrection 19528 a and notice this
[1:08:13] that this Angel was
[1:08:15] Gabriel now these minor Angels come and
[1:08:17] when you see or hear of Gabriel coming
[1:08:19] you get ready for something major fixing
[1:08:21] to happen Gabriel was the one who
[1:08:23] announced the first coming of Jesus
[1:08:25] Christ is that right and we're taught in
[1:08:27] the Bible that Gabriel will announce the
[1:08:28] second announce the second coming now
[1:08:31] listen to what this is he will sound The
[1:08:33] Trumpet Of God that is right the coming
[1:08:37] of the Lord the angel of God Gabriel who
[1:08:41] stands at God's right
[1:08:44] hand
[1:08:46] yeah my don't
[1:08:50] listen Ministry of Christ 53 607 he
[1:08:54] sends many angels but when you hear of
[1:08:56] Gabriel coming down from glory is not
[1:08:58] just a minor thing something major is
[1:09:01] fixing to take place Gabriel here it is
[1:09:04] now Gabriel announced the first coming
[1:09:06] of Christ and Gabriel will announce the
[1:09:07] second coming of Christ amen he's the
[1:09:10] Archangel standing at the right hand of
[1:09:12] his majesty and
[1:09:14] Glory believest thou
[1:09:20] this preached in 1953 906
[1:09:24] 6A now there's there's Angels comes
[1:09:27] perhaps the angel visits me and to visit
[1:09:30] you and so forth there might be minor
[1:09:32] Angels but when you hear this Angel
[1:09:34] Gabriel coming you take heed something's
[1:09:36] taking place Gabriel announced the first
[1:09:38] coming of Jesus Christ and Gabriel will
[1:09:40] announce the second coming of Jesus
[1:09:43] Christ he said boy I feel
[1:09:46] religious about Jesus watch this one
[1:09:51] 1955 612 and look look the whole book of
[1:09:54] Revelation was wrote sent a message by
[1:09:56] an Angel I jesus sent have sent my angel
[1:10:00] to signify these things which must
[1:10:02] shortly come to pass and now true angel
[1:10:05] you're going to throw down throw back
[1:10:07] Joseph Smith and so forth to me but
[1:10:10] watch it don't work with the scripture a
[1:10:12] real true angel will come and vindicate
[1:10:14] this scripture to the dot yes
[1:10:17] sir notice that John fell down and want
[1:10:20] to worship that angel and he said see
[1:10:21] that thou do it not for I am thy fellow
[1:10:25] I am thy fellow thy fellow servants and
[1:10:27] of the prophets worship God a true Angel
[1:10:30] won't be worshiped it's not worship of
[1:10:32] angels it's a Ministry of angels that
[1:10:35] comes from God and these minor Angels
[1:10:37] comes perhaps it's angels with our are
[1:10:40] comes to your your humble servant and
[1:10:43] that's probably a minor Angel but when
[1:10:45] Gabriel comes brother there's something
[1:10:46] really on the road something go major
[1:10:49] going to happen Gabriel announced the
[1:10:51] first coming of the Lord Jesus and G
[1:10:54] Gabriel will announce the second coming
[1:10:55] of the Lord
[1:10:58] Jesus Jehovah of Miracles 1959
[1:11:01] 1126 and she looked at this great Angel
[1:11:04] and his name is
[1:11:05] Gabriel now there is angels of the Lord
[1:11:09] many of them and they come to the Earth
[1:11:10] and bring messages but Gabriel when he
[1:11:13] comes there's something major going to
[1:11:15] happen he was the one who announced the
[1:11:16] first coming of Christ he'll be the one
[1:11:19] that'll announce the second coming of
[1:11:22] Christ
[1:11:25] just reading a few where that you'll get
[1:11:26] the
[1:11:28] point Mary's belief
[1:11:32] 6121 we're looking for he a Heavenly
[1:11:35] visitor in this
[1:11:38] day it's a promise of
[1:11:41] God put on your deep spiritual thinking
[1:11:45] quick church and remember we are now
[1:11:48] looking for a visitor and there's many
[1:11:50] claiming it the only way that we'll know
[1:11:53] this heavenly visitors because heal by a
[1:11:55] record of the word she knew that that
[1:11:58] was the angel from God when she seen his
[1:12:01] action looked at him it must be an angel
[1:12:03] he said I'm Gabriel standing at the
[1:12:05] right hand of God now when God gets
[1:12:08] ready to do something he sends a
[1:12:10] messenger always always has he always
[1:12:12] will Gabriel announce the first coming
[1:12:15] of Christ Gabriel will announce the
[1:12:16] second coming of Christ that's right
[1:12:18] something major is fixing to happen
[1:12:20] right one more and then we'll stop talk
[1:12:23] in seven Church ages preached
[1:12:28] 54512 he's reading the scripture about
[1:12:30] how that he was in the spirit on the
[1:12:31] Lord's day and he heard a great trumpet

[1:13:12] world what's the destination of this
[1:13:14] world if they reject Jesus Christ what's

[1:13:40] right so you can tie together with
[1:13:44] the
[1:13:47] trumpets announcing Angel Gabriel's got
[1:13:50] a job to do announce the coming of a
[1:13:53] special
[1:13:54] event something that's to take
[1:13:58] place something that's to
[1:14:01] happen and he announced the first coming
[1:14:03] by coming to
[1:14:06] Mary now
[1:14:09] listen he didn't announce the first
[1:14:11] coming coming to

[1:14:44] Baptist or was it the coming of the Lord
[1:14:45] Jesus Christ
[1:14:48] right he announced both of them but
[1:14:50] which is the
[1:14:52] important
[1:14:54] okay now let's read some things that
[1:14:57] this might sound to be
[1:14:59] interesting all right and see if we can
[1:15:02] take these two things and let them come
[1:15:06] together that's
[1:15:08] it to
[1:15:10] us all
[1:15:12] right so now we've read these quotes and
[1:15:15] like I said there's plenty of them I got
[1:15:18] had a stack I told them away this
[1:15:19] yesterday CU I run them off and I read
[1:15:22] them about announcing the second

[1:15:46] service on the Ohio
[1:15:49] River all right and he says D pretty
[1:15:52] close to the
[1:15:54] Middle where I got it underline says the
[1:15:56] 17th person I baptized all at once I
[1:16:00] heard something say look
[1:16:03] up now I'm going to say this before we
[1:16:05] do and that's that's all right of what

[1:16:09] explaining one time that uh mey heard
[1:16:15] this of look up and heard your message
[1:16:19] for run the second coming but now I'm

[1:16:24] it gets confusing to you it won't
[1:16:25] confuse you right but said that that it
[1:16:28] was brother brandom's
[1:16:30] voice you heard that one that it was
[1:16:34] brother Brandon's voice that said as
[1:16:37] John the Baptist for run the second
[1:16:39] coming your message well now I'm not
[1:16:42] going to argue with you I'm just going

[1:16:52] once I heard something say look up and I
[1:16:54] looked and here come that Pillar of Fire
[1:16:57] circling down out of Heaven stood right
[1:17:00] over where I was at and said
[1:17:04] it as John the Baptist was sent to forun
[1:17:07] the first coming of Christ your message
[1:17:10] will forerun the second coming of Christ
[1:17:16] amen
[1:17:19] now he calls it there the pillar of
[1:17:22] Fire next one number 10 questions and
[1:17:25] answers uh question and answers God
[1:17:27] being misunderstood
[1:17:30] 61723 and I love him let's sing that
[1:17:33] good old Baptist him
[1:17:36] baptismal baptismal song me the one we
[1:17:40] were seeing the first time that the
[1:17:43] angel of the
[1:17:46] Lord so I want you to understand that
[1:17:49] and
[1:17:50] listen he'll say the pillar of fire
[1:17:52] right
[1:17:54] you'll say the angel of the
[1:17:57] Lord he say the pillar of fire come in
[1:17:59] the cabinet cabin where he was born
[1:18:01] right and he'll say the angel of the
[1:18:05] Lord see now had I made that statement
[1:18:08] of month or two ago your mind would be
[1:18:12] juggling backwards and forth but I'm
[1:18:14] hoping by now that your mind is settled
[1:18:20] in just as if it was brother brandom's
[1:18:23] human voice right they still got to be
[1:18:26] an intelligence to make that Voice work
[1:18:29] it was not his
[1:18:32] intelligence and whether it would be
[1:18:34] called a pillar of fire or whether it
[1:18:37] would be called the angel of the Lord
[1:18:39] just remember what I've been
[1:18:41] teaching all the angels are underneath
[1:18:45] right the leadership and the
[1:18:47] direct leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:51] right so if the prophet says the angel
[1:18:54] of God was there or if he says the
[1:18:58] pillar of fire was there he'll say he
[1:19:01] met him in
[1:19:02] that cave right or the place and
[1:19:06] sometimes speaking like a home or
[1:19:08] whatever and looks like one time it's in
[1:19:10] a home looks like another one but he'll
[1:19:13] he'll talk about the angel of the Lord
[1:19:15] that's been with him all his life then
[1:19:18] he'll talk about the pillar of
[1:19:21] Fire did we get into that get all
[1:19:24] confused
[1:19:26] why
[1:19:30] why you go sometimes and you find it me
[1:19:34] and my wife was listening the other day
[1:19:36] to a
[1:19:38] message you know after you get older you
[1:19:40] just got a lot of sitting around
[1:19:43] time so we just put on tapes and
[1:19:45] sometimes we'll listen to two and three
[1:19:47] tapes you know before we
[1:19:50] quit and we listen to other day we
[1:19:53] brother around talking
[1:19:55] about where he got
[1:19:58] saved have you ever heard him talk about
[1:20:00] where he got
[1:20:03] saved you'll talk about in the building
[1:20:06] the Woodshed you'll talk about running
[1:20:08] down the railroad track you'll talk
[1:20:10] about being there maybe in a another
[1:20:13] place you'll name two or three different
[1:20:16] places well I said well you know that's
[1:20:18] kind
[1:20:19] of odd because we were talking about the
[1:20:23] the many times that he said but I told
[1:20:25] her I said what's the problem you
[1:20:28] know you know brother randoms salvation
[1:20:31] his new birth could have come to him
[1:20:34] like mine
[1:20:36] did over a period of time
[1:20:40] right I got saved in the
[1:20:47] Baptist I got born again in 60 in 69
[1:20:52] that are coming in this
[1:20:56] message is anything wrong with
[1:21:00] that brother Brown explaining one time
[1:21:03] that he saved in Wood next time
[1:21:05] he's talking
[1:21:06] about could it be that he's explaining
[1:21:09] the the development of his growth in his
[1:21:12] new birth see then it's not the prophet
[1:21:15] being confused it's you and me that's
[1:21:17] right amen we're the ones that are
[1:21:19] confused let just bring that out but
[1:21:22] here he'll talk about about the pillar
[1:21:23] of fire and then you talking about the
[1:21:24] angel of the
[1:21:25] Lord so on this one he says sing in that
[1:21:28] ear time first time and watch it old
[1:21:31] baptismal song the one we was singing
[1:21:34] questions and answers being
[1:21:36] misunderstood the first time that the
[1:21:38] angel of the Lord there ever appeared
[1:21:40] before men in his presence look at it
[1:21:45] I've seen it before myself the first
[1:21:47] time he ever come down and when he come
[1:21:50] down he
[1:21:51] said as John was sent to forerun the
[1:21:54] first coming of Christ your message will
[1:21:57] forerun the second coming of Christ you
[1:22:00] talking about hundreds and hundreds of
[1:22:01] people being
[1:22:04] there just listen to these things he
[1:22:06] says and then we'll back up and talk a
[1:22:09] minute number 11 on your notes is this

[1:23:06] speak to a lie God speaks the truth and
[1:23:08] these words are testifying that I'm
[1:23:09] telling you the
[1:23:11] truth they are the one that testify of
[1:23:14] the message that I'm
[1:23:16] preaching not only the angel down there
[1:23:18] on the river that day that said your
[1:23:22] message will forerun the second coming
[1:23:23] of Christ The Works itself if you can't
[1:23:26] believe that angel told the truth
[1:23:29] believe the works
[1:23:31] right souls in prison
[1:23:34] 63 11:10 the morning service as John was
[1:23:37] sent to to announce the first coming of
[1:23:41] Christ your message will announce the
[1:23:44] second coming right now he's using the
[1:23:47] word announce he doesn't have problems
[1:23:49] with using that instead of the word
[1:23:51] message
[1:23:53] he used it as an
[1:23:56] announce and said it's been around the
[1:23:59] world court trial
[1:24:04] 64412 he said I looked and here come
[1:24:06] talking about the River Jordan and I
[1:24:09] heard say heard it say again look up and
[1:24:11] when I looked here come that same Pillar
[1:24:13] of Fire that led Israel through the
[1:24:16] Wilderness thousands of eyes looking at
[1:24:18] it come right down to over where I was
[1:24:21] standing and said
[1:24:23] as John the Baptist was sent to forerun
[1:24:25] the second the first coming of Christ
[1:24:27] your message will shall cover the earth
[1:24:29] and forun the second coming of
[1:24:34] Christ future home 64
[1:24:38] 802 500 walking into the river y the
[1:24:41] first day of the Angel of the Lord
[1:24:43] appeared visible to vindicate like he
[1:24:46] did on Mount Shi that I'd met him
[1:24:50] okay I walked into the River and
[1:24:52] hundreds singing that same song for the
[1:24:55] baptism here he comes descending that
[1:24:57] same Pillar of Fire that you see the
[1:24:59] picture there descending down right here
[1:25:03] at the river and said as John the
[1:25:06] Baptist was sent to forerun his first
[1:25:09] coming message as the as John the
[1:25:12] Baptist was sent to forun his first
[1:25:13] coming message will forun the second
[1:25:16] coming couple more then we'll go back to
[1:25:19] preaching a
[1:25:20] little questions and answers on the
[1:25:22] image of the Beast 54
[1:25:24] 515 he's talking about the same
[1:25:26] situation taking place on the Ohio
[1:25:30] River says as John the Baptist was sent
[1:25:33] for a for for a forerunner of the first
[1:25:36] coming of Jesus Christ your message will
[1:25:39] bring the second coming of Jesus Christ
[1:25:42] notice it said your message will bring
[1:25:45] and it's done
[1:25:46] it it's he hasn't come
[1:25:50] yet listen but look what it's done it
[1:25:54] swept the world around see and today now
[1:25:57] just thinking the efforts that's went
[1:25:59] forward there's been literally millions
[1:26:01] you know what he's talking about
[1:26:02] salvation and things last one spoken
[1:26:05] words original SE 1963 318 my message
[1:26:09] that I believe that God has called me
[1:26:11] far I have to say some personal things
[1:26:14] today because that's what I told you I
[1:26:16] do see and tell the world my mission I
[1:26:20] believe to the Earth is what
[1:26:22] is to forun the coming
[1:26:26] word the coming word which is
[1:26:30] Christ and Christ in him has the
[1:26:33] Millennium and everything else right
[1:26:34] there because he's the word all right so
[1:26:40] now we read quotes that Gabriel will
[1:26:44] announce the second coming CU he
[1:26:47] announced the first
[1:26:49] coming we read quotes where
[1:26:53] brother R message will forun the second
[1:26:55] coming or announce the second
[1:26:59] coming what do you
[1:27:02] think he said well I just can't get that
[1:27:05] quite together all right let's get the
[1:27:08] background story that we had this
[1:27:15] morning Gabriel came to
[1:27:18] Mary to announce the second coming right
[1:27:23] all
[1:27:25] right but who introduced Jesus Christ to
[1:27:28] the
[1:27:32] world the message was not made
[1:27:36] there right John the Baptist
[1:27:40] right came on the River
[1:27:45] Jordan and John the Baptist
[1:27:49] message
[1:27:51] introduced Jesus Christ
[1:27:54] amen now John the Baptist
[1:27:58] message couldn't be any
[1:28:01] different than what the angel delivered
[1:28:05] to
[1:28:07] Mary cuz remember John was
[1:28:13] chosen and given the name
[1:28:17] John and given a Ministry that would be
[1:28:20] the fulfilling of Isaiah 40 is that
[1:28:24] right and 40 41 what it is there words
[1:28:27] you know
[1:28:29] you're all
[1:28:30] right so now it's a very odd incident
[1:28:33] isn't
[1:28:35] it that the prophet would speak of the
[1:28:39] one Gabriel to announce that coming and
[1:28:41] then speak of an Angel being down here
[1:28:44] to announce the second
[1:28:46] coming and it's odd how that it so
[1:28:49] perfectly
[1:28:50] matches that
[1:28:54] Mary would
[1:28:55] be the one that would receive the
[1:28:59] message
[1:29:01] first and then John would come on the
[1:29:05] scene and remember the number three
[1:29:07] statement has got to be made had Jesus
[1:29:11] not come on the scene to John what good
[1:29:13] of John's message what good would have
[1:29:15] John's message been
[1:29:20] right the message true because that's
[1:29:22] what John come to
[1:29:24] Proclaim and John was in the spirit in
[1:29:26] the power of Elias right or
[1:29:28] Elijah all
[1:29:31] right so Gabriel made those
[1:29:37] announcements what if it's true that
[1:29:41] Gabriel then on the Ohio River because
[1:29:43] now listen I wrote this down word that I
[1:29:46] wouldn't forget
[1:29:47] it the first coming of Jesus Christ is a
[1:29:50] baby right
[1:29:52] now brother Rand was not coming to give
[1:29:54] birth to a
[1:29:55] baby that's
[1:29:57] right the second coming don't deal with
[1:29:59] a baby right that's right the first
[1:30:02] coming was dealing with a baby that's
[1:30:04] right but when that baby growed up to
[1:30:07] about 30 years of age 29 and a half to
[1:30:09] be exact right then John the Baptist
[1:30:12] introduced him to the world right
[1:30:17] amen would it be a coincidence then that
[1:30:23] the second coming of
[1:30:25] Christ that on the Ohio
[1:30:29] River when a man was standing there
[1:30:33] baptizing that an angel from heaven
[1:30:36] would come down and say your message
[1:30:39] will forerun the second coming your
[1:30:43] message will announce the second
[1:30:46] coming all right is it coincidental that
[1:30:50] at that time would have been
[1:30:54] 1933 and that 30 years from that
[1:30:58] day almost 29 and a half to be exact
[1:31:02] probably brother random would go to
[1:31:04] Tucson
[1:31:08] Arizona now when people are talking
[1:31:11] about and preaching types and shadows a
[1:31:13] lot of you are shouting like
[1:31:15] everything cuz you think that makes you
[1:31:18] understand it well I'm trying to typ
[1:31:20] some Shadows right help you
[1:31:23] understand don't
[1:31:25] run you know just listen then shout I'm
[1:31:29] not throwing off on you I'm just telling
[1:31:32] it like it is
[1:31:34] right but see wouldn't it be odd then
[1:31:37] that an angel would come to brother
[1:31:43] Brandon was that angel his Angel was it
[1:31:46] the Holy Spirit he had the Holy Spirit
[1:31:48] exited
[1:31:50] you
[1:31:53] I'm not saying the angel that come to
[1:31:55] brother brandom as Gabriel don't you get
[1:31:58] me tied up in the wrong
[1:32:01] place I'm talking about the one that
[1:32:03] come to him at his
[1:32:04] birth cuz he calls the one that come to
[1:32:07] him at his birth he did I didn't he call
[1:32:09] it a minor Angel right but he said when
[1:32:12] a major Angel comes which is
[1:32:15] Gabriel so it wasn't a minor a major
[1:32:18] angel coming to brother Brandon when he
[1:32:20] was born no but when he come to the Ohio
[1:32:23] River out of the Skies came a pillar of
[1:32:26] fire an angel of the Lord to announce
[1:32:30] the second coming
[1:32:33] 1933 33 years 30 years
[1:32:36] later he's preaching the
[1:32:40] seals that's right
[1:32:43] amen true 30 years from the time that he
[1:32:47] starts now you know yourself that
[1:32:50] brother Brown's message
[1:32:52] he said it I didn't Rapture message one
[1:32:56] for sure he said not in the years of
[1:32:58] preparation right but said when he
[1:33:01] begins to sound his message right from
[1:33:04] 33 to 63 brother Brandon was restoring
[1:33:09] back the original faith of the Bible
[1:33:13] right but in the Bible they never had
[1:33:17] the message of the seal they was spoke
[1:33:19] of in Revelation don't misunderstand me
[1:33:22] but nobody know what they were that's
[1:33:24] right now that's what your Prophet said
[1:33:27] so you go do what you ought to nobody
[1:33:29] didn't know what those seals were I've
[1:33:32] heard Baptist preachers preach the six
[1:33:33] seal is the Tribulation but that didn't
[1:33:35] mean we know it right Clarence Lin
[1:33:38] probably 100 years before brother random
[1:33:41] preached that the white horse rider was
[1:33:43] the
[1:33:45] Antichrist sister ceter was talking
[1:33:47] about it a a book that she has or had
[1:33:50] read out of it about people talking
[1:33:52] about Michael and
[1:33:55] things but how did commer Lin know it
[1:33:57] when he was sitting in the Antichrist
[1:33:59] system
[1:34:01] right I'm just trying to get you to
[1:34:04] think that's my job sister Gale to get
[1:34:07] you to think right make it go home and
[1:34:11] give you something to think
[1:34:13] about in those things
[1:34:16] odd your message will
[1:34:19] announce the second coming amen
[1:34:22] what is your purpose brother Brandon we
[1:34:24] read the last one there to
[1:34:27] forun yep the coming of the word which
[1:34:30] is
[1:34:32] Christ in other words to bring the
[1:34:34] message so in 63 brother Brandon Begin
[1:34:37] his message amen that's
[1:34:41] right the seals broke it brought his
[1:34:43] message into bed amen before then he was
[1:34:46] talking about what Paul and Peter and
[1:34:48] them was bringing right then he started
[1:34:50] his message
[1:34:52] right and for three and A2 years he
[1:34:54] preached the most wonderful thing just
[1:34:56] read the title
[1:34:58] sometime if you can't get what brother R
[1:35:01] said he said when those seals broke and
[1:35:03] I've seen people come in this message
[1:35:05] read two books and say boy when them
[1:35:08] seals broke to
[1:35:10] me come a brand new book I thought my
[1:35:15] Lord he said when the seals broke the
[1:35:17] Bible became a brand new book to him he
[1:35:19] read the titles after the seals
[1:35:23] right 98% of them will deal with eternal
[1:35:29] life Christ the Myst of God reveal
[1:35:32] future home who is this
[1:35:34] mesic just read the titles of the
[1:35:36] messages right and you'll see that he
[1:35:39] did have a message amen he always
[1:35:42] preached that MCH go back to
[1:35:44] 57 in the Hebrew series he preached Mel
[1:35:48] jezdic and who he
[1:35:50] was but when he come over there after
[1:35:52] the seals broke he didn't preach who MDC
[1:35:55] was that's not the title he said who is
[1:35:58] this
[1:36:01] MDC he'd always preached one true and
[1:36:03] living God why did he preach Christ's
[1:36:08] mystery that's right because it unfolded
[1:36:12] into a deeper deeper meaning unto him
[1:36:15] amen it brought Christ on the scene
[1:36:19] amen just
[1:36:22] like it wasn't his birth that brought it
[1:36:26] the angel could appear there cuz it
[1:36:28] wasn't the birth of of John the
[1:36:31] Baptist the angel could appear and give
[1:36:33] the name and everything
[1:36:36] right and of course some of you probably
[1:36:38] don't know the whole story but brother
[1:36:39] bram's name was not
[1:36:42] brandham it was
[1:36:46] Braham his father changed the name and
[1:36:48] made it
[1:36:50] brandom it only had six letters in
[1:36:53] it his father changed it and made it
[1:36:56] brandom with the seven letters CU it had
[1:36:59] to
[1:37:00] match we already had a billy
[1:37:03] gra didn't need another one of them we
[1:37:06] needed one with seven letters William
[1:37:08] seven Mariam seven brandom seven we
[1:37:11] needed that and he's up there preaching
[1:37:13] to people and he
[1:37:15] said we' never had nothing like this and
[1:37:18] here's Billy Graham said he's only got
[1:37:20] six letters
[1:37:22] well somebody sort of been sitting there
[1:37:24] how do you spell that guy's name b r a n
[1:37:29] h he he must be talking about something
[1:37:32] by
[1:37:33] himself but instead of that and all then
[1:37:36] pray for God to send us a prophet what
[1:37:40] we need is a prophet he was right
[1:37:43] there but you
[1:37:46] understand as John the Baptist was sent
[1:37:49] to forun the first coming
[1:37:54] you had to walk out there and Proclaim
[1:37:56] what was John the Baptist
[1:37:58] message Behold the Lamb of God that's
[1:38:01] all he
[1:38:03] said he never preached months weeks
[1:38:05] years never done a
[1:38:08] sign not one miracle in the days of John
[1:38:11] the Baptist but Jesus said he never been
[1:38:13] greater or
[1:38:15] woman but he walked out there and he

[1:40:23] brother Brandon said it he said those
[1:40:25] angels are attributes of God right
[1:40:29] amen and God never gained an
[1:40:32] attribute by coming into the world he
[1:40:36] had them before he came and he's never
[1:40:38] lost one of them and don't do away with
[1:40:42] them right we get on that other side we
[1:40:45] can sit down and talk
[1:40:47] about what we seen here and what went on
