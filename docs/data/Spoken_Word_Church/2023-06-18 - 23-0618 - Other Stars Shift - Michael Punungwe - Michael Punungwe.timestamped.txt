[0:01] verse 13.
[0:06] let's pull it up
[0:14] all right all right so our heads
[0:18] for Louis thank you for all your
[0:19] presence here Lord thank you for
[0:20] allowing us to come to the house with
[0:22] Believers Lord to just join our faith
[0:25] together Lord and to Worship You Lord
[0:26] learn more about your word Lord just
[0:28] honor our faith Lord as we know you will
[0:30] as you're your good father take care of
[0:32] us Lord and reveal things to us Lord and
[0:35] help us in our daily lives Lord forgive
[0:36] us of all things Lord and pray for the
[0:38] service going forward and your
[0:39] personality Jesus Christ that prayer
[0:41] amen
[0:43] amen so downstairs I've just been
[0:45] talking about the absolute so I think
[0:47] I'll just continue to talk about that
[0:48] here
[0:50] in Matthew chapter 16 verse 13. it says
[0:53] when Jesus came into the coast of
[0:55] caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples
[0:58] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[1:00] man am
[1:02] and they said some say thou art John the
[1:04] Baptist some Elias others Jeremiah's or
[1:07] one of the prophets
[1:08] and he saith unto them but whom say ye
[1:11] that I am
[1:13] Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art
[1:15] the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:18] now he asks
[1:20] he asked them who who are people saying
[1:23] what are people saying
[1:24] and of course today we know people have
[1:26] many opinions and many things to say
[1:29] and but then he asked who do you say
[1:30] that I am and then Peter says Thou Art
[1:33] the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:35] and and that distinction is so important
[1:37] because Peter didn't just say well I
[1:39] believe everything you say Lord or I
[1:40] believe what you say or or certain thing
[1:42] because there's many people who believe
[1:44] what Jesus says even um the Muslims
[1:47] believe
[1:48] and things used as preachers they
[1:49] believe he's a prophet you know like it
[1:51] says here right here the John John the
[1:53] Baptist Elias Jeremiah is one of the
[1:54] prophets the Muslim belief he's a
[1:56] prophet the Muslim even believe in the
[1:58] miracle birth the Virgin birth but they
[2:00] do not believe that he was God in flesh
[2:02] and and that's the distinction where
[2:05] that's where all the power is lost
[2:06] they've missed that distinction they
[2:08] believe all they believe so far they
[2:10] don't have the Revelation and that's why
[2:12] in verse 17 says Jesus answered and said
[2:16] unto him blessed art thousand and
[2:18] brought join them for Flesh and Blood
[2:19] hath not revealed it unto thee but thy
[2:22] father which is in heaven and then verse
[2:24] 18 says and I say also unto thee like
[2:27] Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[2:29] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[2:31] shall not Prevail against it
[2:33] so that is why the distinction of who he
[2:35] is is so important because flesh and
[2:37] blood cannot reveal this unto us that's
[2:39] why the Muslims you know they believe
[2:40] what Jesus says but they don't believe
[2:41] he was the Christ because they they just
[2:44] look at him and they see flesh and blood
[2:45] they don't see God in flesh
[2:47] so they just need to they don't make
[2:50] that distinction and that's why Jesus is
[2:53] this is that's the rock the revelation
[2:55] of who he is is the rock that the church
[2:57] is built upon
[2:59] because that that's where all the power
[3:00] is that's how we that's where
[3:02] our healing is our Salvation every all
[3:04] the benefits that we need to get out of
[3:06] the word that's where those things are
[3:07] is knowing that he came down God himself
[3:10] came down the Flesh and died for our
[3:11] sins
[3:12] because if he's not God and he didn't
[3:14] die for our sins then we have no hope
[3:15] that's why the Muslims they believe that
[3:18] that's why they're so religious in their
[3:19] works you know Muslims they pray like
[3:21] five times five seven times a day they
[3:23] need they say you have to go to the
[3:24] mecca you have to walk around the mecca
[3:25] you have to go here you have to do this
[3:27] you have to have a prayer mat and you
[3:29] have to there's all this whole setup
[3:30] because they don't believe he was the
[3:32] Christ they don't believe there was a
[3:33] sacrifice
[3:34] and that's the problem because they
[3:36] believe he was just a man and he was a
[3:38] good prophet and a good teacher and all
[3:39] he said a lot of good things and you
[3:41] know love your neighbor don't steal be
[3:44] kind but they don't see that he was God
[3:46] and flesh and that's where the power is
[3:48] it's knowing who he is it's knowing that
[3:50] he is the Christ the son of the Living
[3:52] God as the scripture says and as the
[3:54] Revelation that Peter received and I'll
[3:57] read some quotes here from the absolute
[3:59] or brother Brandon was saying he's also
[4:02] like the North Star to a man that is
[4:04] lost
[4:05] he says now I hunt worldwide and I've
[4:08] been in the wilderness and sometimes one
[4:10] of the best if you look if you can look
[4:11] up you know the direction of the North
[4:13] Star he guide you out and the man that
[4:16] see man at Sea when he was lost and he
[4:18] can only find the North Star he can
[4:19] direct himself
[4:21] then the way he's going now that's when
[4:23] he's lost he looks for the North Star
[4:25] now other stars shift but that North
[4:27] Star sits right in the center of the
[4:29] Earth
[4:30] now I've been teaching on my Sunday
[4:31] school that you know
[4:33] we all need to have a compass and and
[4:36] even talks about here how accomplish is
[4:39] going to point to the North Star because
[4:40] the North Star is the the stable star
[4:42] the star that doesn't move other stars
[4:44] shift as brother Branham says the North
[4:47] Star stays where it is so if your
[4:48] compass is aligned to the North Star
[4:50] then you know where to go you're not
[4:52] going to be lost now the compass for us
[4:55] is our Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is our
[4:57] Compass so it's going to lead us it's
[4:59] always going to lead us to the North
[5:00] Star if you're not leading to the North
[5:01] Star then you're going to be lost your
[5:03] compass is off
[5:04] there's many people in the world who
[5:06] have very many different compasses who
[5:08] like like say a businessman his Compass
[5:09] might be how much money can you make and
[5:11] and that Compass is going to lead him to
[5:14] make a certain deal or or an athlete
[5:16] might say well how can I get better at
[5:18] the game and then the sport I'm playing
[5:19] well then their Compass is going to lead
[5:21] them to be in the gym three times a day
[5:23] or or whatever your compass is you know
[5:25] it's going to lead you that way so if
[5:27] your compass is the Holy Ghost it's
[5:28] always going to point to the North Star
[5:29] which is God's word and that's what
[5:32] you're never going to get lost you're
[5:33] not going to deviate off the path you're
[5:35] going to know where you're going
[5:37] yeah
[5:39] and the North Star the interesting thing
[5:41] about um
[5:43] the North Star is that as as a as an
[5:47] indicator
[5:48] you know it's not just that the North
[5:51] Star points to the North Star but once
[5:53] you find North
[5:55] then you can see east west south
[5:58] so you can see all the different ways
[6:00] that your life could have gone you can
[6:02] see you know you see the North Star and
[6:04] that's where you're going but you can
[6:05] see the west and you can see that path
[6:07] or that path I could have went on you
[6:09] know if I had stayed in school and maybe
[6:11] let me become this and or maybe if I you
[6:14] know got that scholarship and went to
[6:15] the league or whatever whatever uh you
[6:18] know
[6:19] whatever your path could have been
[6:20] whatever you were doing
[6:22] and see the other path and you don't
[6:23] know where you and you can see the north
[6:25] path you can see the other paths and and
[6:26] you can see kind of see where they start
[6:28] out and you don't know where they go to
[6:30] but you can see you can wonder what what
[6:32] would happen if I went down that path
[6:34] and the truth is you don't know it would
[6:35] happen but all you know is that you'd be
[6:37] lost and you wouldn't be going the right
[6:39] way
[6:40] so thankfully we have a North star
[6:42] pointing us to the right direction
[6:44] and
[6:47] and that's where the branch says other
[6:49] stars shift so we need to keep our eyes
[6:50] in the North Star because it's not going
[6:52] to shift it's not going to
[6:54] you know it's a reliable if I point
[6:56] maybe to Jupiter or to the to a
[6:58] different star or whatever the case can
[7:00] be different constellation
[7:02] you know the next night it might be it
[7:04] might be here and then the next night
[7:05] it's over here but the North Star is
[7:07] going to be there and no the next
[7:09] night's going to be there if not or
[7:10] that's going to be there and yesterday
[7:12] today forever so it's just going to be
[7:15] right there it's going to be straight
[7:16] it's going to be narrow
[7:18] it's not going to move
[7:20] and brother Brandon goes on to say no
[7:21] matter where the Earth is turning the
[7:23] North Star Remains the Same it points
[7:25] towards the north that's the only true
[7:27] star I understand that we have
[7:29] that we have is that extremely North
[7:32] Star now it gives you your direction and
[7:34] that's what Christ is is to you if you
[7:37] want to go to heaven you want to be
[7:39] saved you want to be filled with the
[7:40] spirit you want to be Christ like Christ
[7:42] is your North Star if you're lost
[7:45] don't try to take a Creed here's your
[7:48] North Star here's your way here's your
[7:50] direction then if you take him as your
[7:52] North Star then that absolutely places
[7:54] the Holy Spirit your compass amen the
[7:57] holy spirit is accomplished and the
[7:58] compass will only point to the north
[8:00] star and if you got the baptism of the
[8:01] Holy Ghost it can only point to Christ
[8:03] and Christ is the word that's the way
[8:05] you find your way back so
[8:07] new Compass if it's aligned correctly
[8:09] it'll always point to the North Star
[8:10] everything you need is in the scriptures
[8:12] you know God's word is perfect and and
[8:15] you need to know who he is and that
[8:16] Revelation is so important it's who he
[8:18] is and I even talked to a Sunday school
[8:20] about how
[8:22] you know sometimes we look for all these
[8:23] signs and wonders and speaking in
[8:25] tongues and shouting and rejoicing and
[8:27] all those things are great but truly
[8:30] what is Supernatural is the fact that
[8:32] you've come to a revelation of who Jesus
[8:34] Christ is because that's what the whole
[8:36] Bible is is based on you know because
[8:38] many people like the Muslims they have
[8:39] there you know there's plenty nice
[8:41] people and and they're very sincere and
[8:44] they worship and they do what they're
[8:45] supposed to do
[8:46] but they don't know who he is you know
[8:50] and they're doing all these works but
[8:51] it's in vain because they don't know
[8:53] they don't know who he is like there was
[8:55] a sacrifice that you know these works
[8:56] this could do this works but we had a
[8:59] sacrifice that you know if we if we fail
[9:01] to these words which we will uh you know
[9:04] we have Grace there's a sacrifice for us
[9:06] made so that you know when we we come to
[9:09] the Judgment we come to these things
[9:10] when God is looking at us he doesn't see
[9:13] us he sees the sacrifice he sees the
[9:14] lamb slain she's our sacrifice so it
[9:16] doesn't matter what we look like
[9:19] it doesn't matter what you know we do
[9:21] what we've done in our lives what we
[9:22] think but if we hold on to that
[9:24] sacrifice then everything else is in the
[9:27] clear
[9:28] and brother Brown says this is a long
[9:30] way getting around what I want to say
[9:32] but you'll understand it maybe what I'm
[9:33] trying to get to you there must be an
[9:35] absolute in your life you've got to have
[9:37] it somewhere every one of you has got
[9:38] one you can't go on without one you've
[9:40] got to have an absolute so you're
[9:42] absolute
[9:44] you know we're put on this Earth to have
[9:46] relationship with God and and to worship
[9:48] and to serve him but if your absolute is
[9:50] turned a different way then it's going
[9:51] to lead you to serve that thing or
[9:53] whatever the absolute may be and that's
[9:55] when that's why you need to have the
[9:56] compass the compass is the Holy Ghost
[9:58] and and you know
[10:00] if you have the revelation of who he is
[10:01] and then you can personally get to know
[10:03] him then that comment is always going to
[10:04] point you to the North Star you're never
[10:06] going to have to um
[10:08] you know wonder what's going on or why
[10:10] things happen but you just know that
[10:11] God's got it all in control and that you
[10:14] can just trust him and and keep
[10:15] following him in that way
[10:17] so yeah but if your absolute isn't
[10:20] Christ and that's why people sometimes
[10:22] they get caught up in these different
[10:23] denominations different ideas you know
[10:25] different principles because they don't
[10:27] have the compass in their life to tell
[10:28] them that well this brother you know
[10:30] brother Branham would say um he was
[10:32] being kind but he would he would go
[10:34] places and he knew that didn't agree
[10:36] with everything he said
[10:37] would you say you know if you don't
[10:38] agree with everything I say just sit
[10:40] listen and it's like eating a cherry pie
[10:42] you know you get to a seed you just spit
[10:43] it out but you keep eating the rest of
[10:45] the pie and uh sometimes you go to other
[10:47] churches and sometimes there's things
[10:48] they might not teach right but if you're
[10:49] the Holy Ghost you know you can you can
[10:52] have that discernment of the Holy Ghost
[10:54] and say well no this thing might be not
[10:56] be right you just you just kind of spot
[10:58] you know spit out the seed and then just
[10:59] keep eating the pie so you can you can
[11:01] have your own discernment but if you
[11:02] don't have the Holy Ghost you don't have
[11:04] that discernment you may go somewhere
[11:05] and you may be deceived and not even
[11:07] know it
[11:08] and thankfully we're elected so we have
[11:10] that promise that you know if we cannot
[11:12] be deceived that way
[11:14] and brother Brown was going to say there
[11:16] was a time
[11:17] there was a time when a woman her word
[11:19] about table manners that was the
[11:21] absolute in America I think her name was
[11:23] Emily post if I'm not mistaken and
[11:25] whatever she said about table manners if
[11:27] she said you should be with your you
[11:28] know eat with a pass or a knife or
[11:31] that was it that was it and why if she
[11:33] said to eat the chicken you just picked
[11:35] it up in your hands and eat it no matter
[11:37] how anybody looked at you you were
[11:39] exactly in line see because that was the
[11:41] absolute
[11:42] she was the absolute of table manners
[11:44] that's right whatever the woman said
[11:45] that was it
[11:47] so so the similar to God you know we
[11:50] God is our absolute so whatever our
[11:52] whatever our mannerisms are to be
[11:54] whatever our our demeanors are to be
[11:56] whatever our lives are to be
[11:58] um it is to be tailored by God it is to
[12:01] be you know checked out and filtered
[12:03] through the Holy Spirit
[12:06] so so similar like you know even if
[12:09] things itself this woman just said you
[12:10] know you know we're supposed to eat uh
[12:12] supposed to eat
[12:13] I'm a pudding with a fork then those and
[12:16] then you might seem odd to you but
[12:17] that's what she said so that that's what
[12:19] that's how what it goes and um
[12:22] not similar to God you know there might
[12:24] be things that you know when you read
[12:25] the scriptures you think man like that
[12:27] just seems so so hard for for God to do
[12:29] that or maybe it seems like oh well you
[12:32] know I wish these type of people get
[12:33] into heaven or these other people were
[12:34] like you know or whatever happens or
[12:37] even if say maybe you think oh
[12:38] drinking's not that bad or this isn't
[12:40] that bad but you have to have a a
[12:42] compass a holy spirit that will tell you
[12:44] well you know what even if I don't think
[12:46] it's that bad even if I think having a
[12:48] little fun on the weekend isn't bad
[12:49] thing the word says something
[12:50] differently so I need to follow that
[12:52] even if I disagree with the word and
[12:55] always stick to the truth no matter what
[12:58] so that's why we need to follow our
[13:00] absolute and whatever he says goes
[13:02] and the scripture is on to say but you
[13:04] see all those
[13:06] with the wrong kind of real absolutes
[13:08] they failed every one of them standing
[13:11] in Egypt not long ago I was thinking
[13:12] about the time that Pharaoh set on the
[13:14] throne and you know you have to dig down
[13:16] 20 feet in the ground to find where
[13:17] their Throne was
[13:19] oh my
[13:22] oh an absolute that would be
[13:24] it's perished and gone and the people
[13:26] that relied upon that kind of an
[13:28] absolute they're perished with it
[13:31] so where your absolute goals that's
[13:33] where you go you know if you're absolute
[13:36] is to perish then you are to perish but
[13:38] if your absolute is eternal and
[13:39] everlasting then you are to be Eternal
[13:41] and everlasting so you must follow your
[13:43] absolute
[13:45] and he says why it was man-made anything
[13:48] that's man-made will perish with man but
[13:50] there is an absolute that cannot perish
[13:52] there's the Eternal Word of God it can
[13:54] never perish and you must stay with it
[13:56] we have an absolute at a ball game you
[13:58] know that we have a ball game can
[14:00] operate without an absolute and that's
[14:01] the Umpire see now sometimes we don't
[14:03] like his decisions
[14:05] but it's absolute
[14:07] she's the absolute anyhow no matter if
[14:11] we if we want to say
[14:12] other than that you know or there was a
[14:15] strike there was a ball he says strike
[14:17] that's what it is don't argue with him
[14:18] he's there he's the absolute in the ball
[14:20] game because if he said strike you can
[14:23] fuss you can throw your hat out there
[14:24] and protest it but it's a strike anyhow
[14:27] amen now let's just take a minute what
[14:29] what if there was no umpire in the game
[14:31] what kind of a fuss it would be it would
[14:33] be chaos you couldn't play the game
[14:35] without having an absolute in it games
[14:38] have got to happen absolute so every
[14:41] every game you play has a rule book it's
[14:42] a rule set and and you could consider
[14:45] Life a game and if that's the case then
[14:47] then God has the rule book and we need
[14:49] to follow that the Bible is the rule
[14:50] book it lays out the
[14:53] the laws for us what we need to do and
[14:55] how do we we come to you know Salvation
[14:57] and New Birth and having experience
[15:00] and we can't just can't just be you know
[15:03] playing our own game and trying to play
[15:04] our own rules because then we're not
[15:07] gonna be able to play at all yeah
[15:10] he just goes on to say you know
[15:13] talk about how and that's why the the
[15:15] revelation of who he is is so important
[15:17] because
[15:19] like I said the Muslims believe but they
[15:22] don't know who he is and knowing who he
[15:24] is and knowing that okay this is this is
[15:26] real something about this is real
[15:27] because you know Flesh and Blood can't
[15:30] reveal this to us you know it's it's not
[15:32] it's not uh any man can tell you
[15:34] anything but it's it's it's the
[15:36] Revelation that you get you know it's
[15:38] it's the man being used through through
[15:40] God so you can go to Revelation even the
[15:43] Bible says you know you can't even say
[15:44] that the Lord is Christ without even you
[15:48] know the Holy Ghost being a part of that
[15:50] and truthfully believe that in your
[15:51] heart you can't even confess that out
[15:53] loud truly and truly believe it without
[15:56] it being you know the revelation of the
[15:58] Holy Ghost and that's why you know if
[15:59] he's so adamant on Jesus is so adamant
[16:02] on you know that's why you bless Simon
[16:04] because flesh and blood is not flesh and
[16:06] blood that reveal this to you my Father
[16:08] in Heaven revealed this to you and
[16:09] similar to that
[16:11] you know there's just so many things
[16:12] where
[16:14] where even
[16:15] just in our personal lives we need to
[16:18] to yield to God more because you know
[16:20] things will be will
[16:22] come out the right way even in the way
[16:24] we treat each other even the way we
[16:26] raise our kids even the way we we talk
[16:28] to people even talk to people who aren't
[16:30] Christian and people talk to people we
[16:31] disagree with you know it's just a labor
[16:34] of love and knowing that you know what
[16:36] would you like even asking the question
[16:37] what would Jesus do or what would you
[16:39] know what would my absolute do in this
[16:40] situation you know what what am I to do
[16:43] because we're supposed to model
[16:43] ourselves after him and he's perfect so
[16:46] what are we supposed to be
[16:47] right exactly and
[16:50] and just to be sincere but also to know
[16:53] that you know to go back to the word
[16:55] every time because there's many people
[16:57] who
[16:58] they'll be very sincere but they won't
[17:00] they don't have the the new birth they
[17:02] don't have the revelation of who he is
[17:04] you know and they'll have their own
[17:05] experience and they'll think oh I have
[17:07] this this gift or this that and
[17:10] they'll think they're being led of God
[17:11] but but they go in the Bible and it's
[17:13] completely contrary
[17:14] so it's like what is their absolute you
[17:16] know what what what is leading them to
[17:18] this conclusion
[17:21] so
[17:23] these types of things
[17:25] is why
[17:27] just to get to to know the person as a
[17:29] as a person and even how the Bible talks
[17:32] about just getting to know his face and
[17:33] to see his face and to truly
[17:36] you know just to get closer to him and
[17:38] then even you know David always talks
[17:40] about how he wants to
[17:43] inquiring the Temple of the Lord or
[17:44] behold his face and just to and to just
[17:47] to be in the presence of the Lord
[17:49] because that's how you see someone's
[17:50] face you know like we have to we have to
[17:52] get closer because there's no when these
[17:54] things are being explained in the Bible
[17:55] there's no face time there's no Skype we
[17:58] can't you know but so see someone's face
[18:00] you have to be in their presence you
[18:02] have to go where they are and be there
[18:04] you know and truly be in their
[18:06] atmosphere and to be in the right
[18:08] atmosphere so
[18:10] it's all those things and um as the
[18:13] musicians come
[18:16] and said there is no scripture in the
[18:19] Bible that say there's no promise that
[18:20] says the Bible said God God is in the
[18:24] word right God is in the word God the
[18:25] word is true and I've seen in there the
[18:27] Bible where it said whosoever shall add
[18:29] one word to it or take one word from it
[18:31] shall be taken his part out of The Book
[18:33] of Life
[18:35] now I know that was an absolute
[18:37] that word could not change so I accepted
[18:40] that I said now Lord let me hide let me
[18:43] hide it into my heart that it'll keep it
[18:46] and be reverent with it and whatever it
[18:48] is I'll walk with you
[18:50] guide me and that's and it's been my
[18:52] absolute so
[18:54] just to know you know for a fact that
[18:57] the word is right and that we need to
[18:59] always follow the word and be with us
[19:02] because you can't add one word or take
[19:04] take a word away because that's how we
[19:06] get in trouble so it has to be it has to
[19:07] be absolute every word every line and we
[19:10] have to you know have the Holy Spirit to
[19:12] discern these things the people can read
[19:13] the Bible and there's many people who
[19:14] have read the Bible
[19:15] more than us multiple times over and
[19:18] they still haven't caught the Revelation
[19:19] really of what it's saying they haven't
[19:21] caught the Revelation that a man came
[19:23] and God came and a man and died for us
[19:26] and to catch that Revelation and to have
[19:28] that in your life
[19:30] and then you know and they try to follow
[19:32] the word but it's it's always odd
[19:34] because they'll
[19:35] you know and even the way talks about
[19:37] the splits and the Methodist Church and
[19:39] the women preaching and homosexuals
[19:41] preaching and all those things
[19:42] and it's because they're they've taken
[19:45] they've taken the words away and they've
[19:47] added words to it and that's how we get
[19:49] off is when
[19:50] we're not just following what God has
[19:52] provided for us so let's all all of God
[19:54] provided for us and God bless you
[19:57] [Applause]

[19:59] [Applause]
