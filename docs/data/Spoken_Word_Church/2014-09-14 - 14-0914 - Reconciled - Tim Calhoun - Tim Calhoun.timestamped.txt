[0:40] going to go to several scriptures
[0:42] Genesis 3 Colossians 1 Romans 5 2
[0:47] Corinthians 5 start out at Genesis 3
[0:52] verse
[0:53] 11 I'm going to move through it quickly
[0:56] so if you have to you get lost don't
[0:58] worry about it
[1:00] and he said who told thee that thou was
[1:02] naked hast thou eaten of the tree
[1:04] whereof I commanded thee that thou
[1:06] should us not eat and the man said the
[1:08] woman whom thou gavest to be with me she
[1:10] gave me of the tree and I did eat the
[1:13] Lord God said unto the woman what is
[1:15] this that thou Hast done the woman said
[1:17] the serpent begal me and I did eat the
[1:20] Lord God said unto the serpent because
[1:22] thou Hast done this thou are cursed
[1:24] above all cattle above every beast of
[1:26] the field upon thy belly shalt thou go
[1:28] and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
[1:30] thy life and I will put enmity between
[1:33] thee and the woman and between thy seat
[1:36] and her seed it shall bruise thy head
[1:38] and thou shalt bruise his heel to the
[1:41] woman he said I will greatly multiply
[1:43] thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow
[1:46] Thou shalt bring forth children thy
[1:48] desire shall be thy husband and he shall
[1:51] rule over thee and unto Adam he said
[1:53] because thou Hast hearkened unto the
[1:55] voice of thy wife and Hast eaten of the
[1:57] tree of which I commanded thee saying
[1:59] that shall not eat of it cursed is the
[2:02] ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou
[2:05] eat of it all the days of thy life
[2:08] Thorns also and thistles shall it bring
[2:11] forth to thee and thou shalt eat the
[2:13] herb of the field in the sweat of thy
[2:16] faith shalt thou eat bread till thou
[2:18] return unto the ground for out of the
[2:21] out of it was thou taken for dust Thou
[2:23] Art and unto dust thou shal
[2:26] return Colossians chapter 2
[2:33] I'm sorry chapter one not chapter
[2:41] 2 we're going to start verse
[2:46] 16 for by him were all things created
[2:49] that are in heaven and that are in Earth
[2:52] visible and invisible whether they be
[2:54] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[2:57] or Powers all things were created by him
[3:00] and for him and he is before all things
[3:03] and by him all things consist and drop
[3:07] down to verse 20 and having made peace
[3:10] through the blood of his cross by him to
[3:13] reconcile all things unto himself by him
[3:16] I say whether they be things in Earth or
[3:19] things in
[3:20] heaven and you that were sometime
[3:23] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[3:26] Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled
[3:29] in the body of his flesh through death
[3:32] to present you holy and unblamable and
[3:36] unreprovable in his sight if ye continue
[3:40] in the faith grounded and settled and be
[3:42] not moved away from the hope of the
[3:44] Gospel which ye have heard and which was
[3:47] preached to every creature which is
[3:49] under Heaven whereof I Paul and made a
[3:52] minister now verse
[3:54] 26 even the mystery which hath been hid
[3:57] from ages and from Generations but now
[4:00] is made manifest to his Saints to whom
[4:03] God would make known what is the riches
[4:06] of the glory of this mystery among the
[4:09] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[4:12] of glory whom we preach warning every
[4:15] man and teaching every man in all wisdom
[4:18] that we may present every man perfect in
[4:21] Christ Jesus that's right Romans chapter
[4:27] 3 or I'm sorry Romans is the third thing
[4:30] Romans chapter 5 and verse
[4:35] 1 therefore being justified by faith we
[4:39] have peace with God through our Lord
[4:42] Jesus Christ by whom also we have access
[4:46] by faith into this grace wherein we
[4:49] stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory
[4:52] of God and not only so but we glory in
[4:55] tribulations also knowing that
[4:57] tribulation worketh patience
[5:00] patient experience and experience hope
[5:03] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[5:05] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[5:08] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[5:12] for when we were yet without Strength In
[5:15] Due Time Christ died for the ungodly
[5:19] verse 8 but God commendeth his love
[5:22] toward us in that while we were yet
[5:25] sinners Christ died for us much more
[5:28] then being now justified by his blood we
[5:31] shall be saved from wrath through him
[5:35] for if when we were enemies we were
[5:37] reconciled to God by the death of his
[5:40] son much more being reconciled we shall
[5:44] be saved by his
[5:47] life and not only so but we also joy in
[5:50] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[5:53] whom we have now received the atonement
[5:56] that's it all right Second Corinthians
[6:00] chapter
[6:02] 5 verse
[6:07] 14 for the love of Christ constrain us
[6:11] because we thus judge that if one died
[6:14] for all then were all dead and that he
[6:17] died for all that they which live should
[6:20] not henceforth live unto themselves but
[6:23] unto him which died for them and rose
[6:25] again wherefore henceforth know we no
[6:29] man after the flesh yay though we have
[6:32] known Christ after the flesh yet now
[6:34] henceforth know we him no more therefore
[6:38] If any man be in Christ he is a new
[6:40] creature old things are passed away
[6:43] behold all things are become new and all
[6:46] things are of God Amen who hath
[6:49] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[6:52] and hath given to us the ministry of
[6:55] reconciliation yes to Wi are to
[6:58] understand that God was in Christ
[7:00] reconcile the world unto himself not
[7:03] imputing their trespasses unto them amen
[7:05] and hath committed unto us the word of
[7:09] reconciliation now then we are
[7:12] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[7:15] bech you by us we pray you in Christ
[7:19] dead be ye reconciled to God for he has
[7:23] made him to be sin for us who knew no
[7:26] sin that we might be made the
[7:28] righteousness of God in him right so we
[7:32] started out there in Genesis and the
[7:34] reason I went to that is to show you
[7:36] where the enmity came into being prior
[7:40] to that there was no enmity but at that
[7:44] point that's when the enmity was put
[7:46] between us and God right it wasn't
[7:50] between us and Satan it was between us
[7:52] and God the enmity is the carnal mind
[7:55] the human nature because the scripture
[7:57] clearly tells us that the carnal mind is
[8:00] death so that enmity which is death was
[8:03] placed between us and it separated us
[8:06] from God in that it separated so to
[8:09] speak the soul from the spirit so we
[8:12] were born a spiritual being controlling
[8:16] us and that spirit being was born with a
[8:19] wrong nature it was born with a nature
[8:22] of a beast and that nature controlled us
[8:26] until the point of the new birth and
[8:29] once you have the new birth then you are
[8:32] no longer to be controlled by that Beast
[8:34] likee nature you now have a new nature
[8:37] that will control that spirit and cause
[8:40] you to walk in new things a new life a
[8:43] new way different from what you were
[8:46] before now we talked about Recon
[8:49] reconciled and
[8:51] Reconciliation reconcile is a financial
[8:55] or an investment type word to be
[8:58] reconciled is to make it balanced one
[9:02] thing you go through the Old Testament
[9:04] one thing that God cursed and cursed as
[9:06] an Abomination was an unequal balance he
[9:11] hated it right he absolutely hated it
[9:15] right and whenever people used an
[9:18] unequal balance what are you talking
[9:20] about when they would take like if you
[9:22] went to the man to get wheat and he said
[9:26] it was going to be a dollar and you put
[9:28] a dollar up there
[9:30] well he had his balance set up so that
[9:32] he only gave you back 90 cents worth of
[9:34] wheek so he was getting more from you
[9:39] than he was giving in return even though
[9:41] he told you it was a dollar he's only
[9:43] giving you back 90 cents but his balance
[9:46] made it look like everything was equal
[9:49] and God has hated that all down through
[9:51] time amen but until the cross came see
[9:55] we saw there in Colossians that it was
[9:58] at his cross that he made peace what
[10:01] does peace mean it means the destruction
[10:03] or the removal of the enmity right he
[10:07] removed the enmity between us and him
[10:10] amen prior to that point if you look
[10:13] down through the Old Testament there was
[10:14] only one person that could ever walk up
[10:17] face to face and talk to God himself and
[10:21] he had to do
[10:23] that physically dressed in a certain way
[10:26] physically doing certain things physic
[10:29] Bally carrying a physical blood and
[10:32] sprinkling it before him and carrying an
[10:35] incense in order for him to come into
[10:37] God's presence why because he stunk in
[10:40] God's nostrils that man had to put on
[10:44] that outer covering and carry those
[10:46] outer things in order to cover up his
[10:49] stench in God's nostrils because he was
[10:52] coming in the nature of a beast even
[10:55] though those things were given for a
[10:57] covering it did not remove that Beast
[10:59] like nature but once Christ came on the
[11:03] cross he took upon our sin our unbelief
[11:08] he became unbelief for us he took ours
[11:11] he took it down into hell and put it
[11:14] back on the shoulders of the one that it
[11:16] came from in original and so it no
[11:18] longer now rest in us it's now put back
[11:22] on Satan's there amen okay um he aen a
[11:27] lot with her hands
[11:30] so when you when you look at that
[11:32] reconcile it means to put the balance
[11:35] back in place right amen that's good now
[11:38] as as brother Wade said when he was
[11:40] explaining that earlier Adam could not
[11:42] reconcile anything he did not have
[11:46] anything that he could
[11:48] invest right but Jesus Christ in him
[11:52] dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily
[11:55] so when he died he put the investment he
[11:59] deposited into the account everything
[12:02] that is ever required for you and
[12:06] I to be balanced that's good everything
[12:10] that's ever come against us there is a
[12:12] balance sitting there that you and I can
[12:14] draw from that will cancel the debt
[12:18] that's good so at any time that we have
[12:21] a
[12:22] sin after we are born again because the
[12:26] prophet clearly told us that only
[12:28] Christians can sin so it's stumbling and
[12:32] falling there is a deposit an account
[12:36] with a full deposit that can never
[12:41] be withdrawn down to a zero right you
[12:44] can never write a check on that account
[12:46] and it come back and say insufficient
[12:49] funds it's always more than sufficient
[12:52] amen as he told the Apostle Paul Paul my
[12:55] grace is sufficient right so whatever
[12:58] you have need of whatever it is at any
[13:01] time you reach and you write that check
[13:03] and send it and the bank of Heaven sends
[13:06] back whatever you need it's extended out
[13:09] to you to clear the balance see Satan's
[13:12] always trying to attach a balance to us
[13:16] just like the prophet taught us
[13:19] whenever God purchased us and brought us
[13:22] back out of that pawn shop Satan's
[13:24] constantly trying to get us back into
[13:26] that pawn shop so every time we turn
[13:29] around we're having to repent we're
[13:32] having to do this we're having to do
[13:34] that right and so God made that
[13:38] deposit so that you and I can go free
[13:42] amen and it's free in deed there's no
[13:46] way he can put us back in that past
[13:49] house
[13:51] um Jesus the scripture says that
[13:55] whenever he came at after the River
[14:00] Jordan when the spirit of the Lord came
[14:03] upon him he walked into the synagogue he
[14:08] read the
[14:09] book and then the scripture says he
[14:12] closed the book right and he sat down so
[14:17] when he closed the book see that's what
[14:20] you do anybody that has a business or
[14:23] Works in a business and understands
[14:24] those financial things closing the book
[14:27] is reconciling every everything together
[14:30] that's right whenever the spirit of the
[14:32] Lord recognized him as being that
[14:36] perfect one the book was now being
[14:39] closed because now man and God were
[14:43] reconciled am and when he closed that
[14:47] book and sat down then he was now taking
[14:52] the full
[14:53] Authority on the cross when he said it
[14:56] is finished that's right m then the
[14:59] books were
[15:00] totally completely done for all eternity
[15:05] there was no other thing that could be
[15:08] brought that could cause the debt to be
[15:12] back in place that's right nothing could
[15:14] put that debt back in place the only
[15:17] thing that can put that debt back in
[15:18] place is when you and I have unbelief
[15:21] that's right and then that puts us back
[15:23] into the pawn shop because of our own
[15:27] unbelief and that's when we have to go
[15:30] back and say wait a
[15:33] minute I'm not that person that's not me
[15:39] and you say
[15:42] well I Stumble I fall well that's true
[15:46] we all stumble and fall because we are
[15:49] still in cursed ground right that's
[15:52] right this ground that you and I live in
[15:55] is still under the curse that's right so
[15:57] at any time that we happened us to allow
[16:01] it to take control that's when we
[16:05] stumble that's right because as long as
[16:07] we're operating from that position of
[16:09] Faith then there's no way that Satan can
[16:11] do anything with us amen he has the the
[16:14] Lord has given him access to the flesh
[16:17] to attack it that's right but he's never
[16:19] given him free control right even when
[16:23] he turned him loose and allowed him to
[16:25] do all those things to job remember he
[16:28] reserved
[16:30] you can't touch his life why God has
[16:33] that life reserved unto himself and it's
[16:35] the life that cleanses everything in the
[16:38] body right in the message invisible
[16:42] union he says well you separated from
[16:46] your first Union by spiritual death now
[16:49] you are born again or remarried again to
[16:52] the new spiritual union of not your
[16:55] natural life of the things of the world
[16:57] but of eternal Life The Germ that was in
[17:01] you at the beginning found you right now
[17:04] your old book is gone with your old
[17:06] Union so all of those things that you
[17:08] did before that point in time you know
[17:11] the scripture has from that time all
[17:15] right when when the time the day that
[17:17] you recognize that you were a son or
[17:20] daughter of God from that time you
[17:24] that's the reason the prophet said drive
[17:25] down that state right you know you drive
[17:28] down that state from that time from that
[17:30] point no matter what he brings back to
[17:32] you from that point he can't there's
[17:34] nothing he can behind that state it's
[17:36] all written that's right amen and every
[17:40] day you know the scripture says Don't
[17:42] Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath all
[17:44] right so whenever you get upset in the
[17:47] day before the sun goes
[17:49] down repent that's right make it
[17:53] right be angry and sin not so these
[17:57] things is what we do as Christians and
[18:00] it keeps us
[18:02] clean now the only way we can be clean
[18:05] is from that germ of God that Jesus
[18:08] released on the cross to come into you
[18:11] and I and brother Wade has told me that
[18:15] y'all been studying on the stature of a
[18:17] perfect man and when you look at all
[18:19] that there is nothing that there that is
[18:23] humanly possible Right everything there
[18:26] comes out of that deposit that Jesus
[18:29] Christ made that day on Calvary so that
[18:32] faith it comes out of that deposit
[18:34] because it's just like he told the
[18:36] Apostle Peter Flesh and Blood ha not
[18:38] revealed this unto you but my Father
[18:41] which in heaven has revealed it unto you
[18:43] so when you get to that point of Faith
[18:46] that's when you have recognized who he
[18:49] is and that you belong to him right so
[18:53] that's Faith because when you recognize
[18:56] that Satan can't shake that see amen he
[18:59] can shake anything else but once that
[19:02] Revelation strikes you and you know who
[19:04] God is and you know that you are part of
[19:08] him Satan becomes ineffective that's
[19:11] right now that virtue and knowledge
[19:14] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[19:17] kindness and divine love were all
[19:20] deposited that day at Calvary so it was
[19:22] all finished that
[19:24] day but
[19:26] nevertheless those are character those
[19:28] are part of your character and so the
[19:31] character has to be built it has to be
[19:34] grown everything that you needs already
[19:37] in you
[19:38] AB but it takes squeezing that's right
[19:42] to reveal what's there that's right and
[19:45] it's when that squeezing starts
[19:46] happening on us that's when it starts
[19:48] coming out see and revealing what was
[19:51] actually deposited in you because it's
[19:54] when those things in life happen that we
[19:58] re
[19:59] recognize what God really did for us and
[20:02] and
[20:03] there's that is the way God set it up
[20:05] it's not us we don't have any control
[20:08] over that's right I I would like to you
[20:10] know for me I would just like okay I'm
[20:13] I'm born again it's over with yeah yeah
[20:16] no more trials no more tribulations but
[20:19] that's not what the word says it's that
[20:22] you know tribulation worketh patience
[20:24] well there there there it is so you're
[20:27] going to have a lot of tribulation here
[20:29] to get to that point that's right and so
[20:31] that's that's what's required and it's
[20:34] it's God's way of shaping us into his
[20:38] own character because it's his character
[20:40] that he places within us absolutely but
[20:43] we have a character that tries to always
[20:46] step in Step In step
[20:50] in you know that's
[20:53] right the the easiest thing to talk
[20:55] about is the husband and wife
[20:57] relationship you know so whenever
[21:00] whenever my wife says something to me
[21:03] you
[21:04] know there's another nature that steps
[21:07] in there trying to take over see and
[21:10] what's it what's it trying to do it's
[21:12] trying to make her act the same way
[21:14] right re see re puts you back into that
[21:18] old nature and then the next thing you
[21:20] know we won't even talk to one another
[21:21] for two or three days and then the next
[21:23] thing you know there's more problems and
[21:25] more problems until finally if that
[21:27] thing's not reconciled
[21:30] you bust up and go separate ways and it
[21:32] all start over something stupid
[21:34] usually but Satan that's just how that's
[21:37] just how well he knows that nature that
[21:40] we're born of he knows how to trick you
[21:42] into doing something so that's the
[21:45] reason that the scripture tells us in
[21:48] the Le oysan address be zealous and
[21:52] repent that's right be zealous be quick
[21:55] to repent right because in this day time
[21:58] is moving so fast that in a few days a
[22:02] person can go from almost a perfect
[22:04] marriage to a total
[22:05] disaster right and it's not just
[22:08] marriage because the marriage
[22:10] relationship reflects the other
[22:12] relationships in your life relationships
[22:15] with your children with your your
[22:16] co-workers and all those different
[22:18] things it'll do the same thing to a
[22:20] church because it's that same
[22:22] relationship that's right and whenever
[22:24] things start getting out of balance you
[22:27] have to start pointing back
[22:29] to the right place and it's always back
[22:31] to the Cross because it's at the cross
[22:34] the deposit was made amen and it's at
[22:36] the cross that the human nature died not
[22:40] his dying yeah died the scripture we
[22:44] read it yeah we died with him when he
[22:48] died we died when he raised up in
[22:50] newness we raised up in so everything
[22:53] was reconciled at that point but it's us
[22:57] recognizing ing it and saying I'm not
[23:00] part of it right see it's no different
[23:03] than you having a a I mean a thought of
[23:08] curse words coming through wanting you
[23:10] to say those words sure and what do you
[23:13] do you take the word yep I don't do that
[23:17] right I don't speak like that right
[23:20] that's not me right a thought comes to
[23:23] commit fornication or adultery what do
[23:25] you do you take the word that's not me
[23:27] you separate those things from you see
[23:30] you're pointing right back to that cross
[23:32] you're crucifying that old nature every
[23:35] time you do that you're pointing it
[23:37] right back to where it
[23:39] died so it wants to come and take
[23:42] control but you point it back to where
[23:43] it died because we're not trying to
[23:47] learn to die we're already dead in
[23:50] Christ and so it's that newness of Life
[23:53] coming forth where all of these things
[23:56] have become new right anybody can have
[23:59] human love got two minutes Mr moderator
[24:02] okay anybody can have brotherly kindness
[24:05] humanly sure all of these things sure
[24:08] but those are worthless absolutely those
[24:11] are absolutely worthless if it is not
[24:13] godly that's right if it is not God's
[24:16] Own love that's right amen that's right
[24:18] it's a waste amen so that's the reason
[24:21] we have to look at that and be
[24:23] sure that we're looking at the cross and
[24:27] we're taking that man raised up
[24:29] afterwards in that perfect body that you
[24:33] and I
[24:34] have prepared for us so the Lord God
[24:38] bless you
