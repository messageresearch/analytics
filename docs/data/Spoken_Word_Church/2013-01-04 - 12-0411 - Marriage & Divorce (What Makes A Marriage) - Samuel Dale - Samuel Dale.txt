I want to see you I want to see you of your glory pour out to power and love ho you love me now shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to amen and amen and amen you want to see him amen then just look into the word find amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to Luke 1 and Matthew 1 Luke 1 Matthew 1 and take an opportunity to speak on something that was requested back a good bit ago now I've had the note L on my desk for quite a while for me to speak on and I was going to try to bring it on over and bypass it and get on over to later but it just buing on me so we'll just cover it but we're going to talk about marriage and divorce amen all right now and the main thing we're going to do is tonight is we're going to try to cover marriage you know what it takes to make a marriage Etc and then we'll go into uh later on you know what is a divorce or what can be or who can be divorced whatever can be and we'll try to cover that so uh I have it in here and I'll state it again to you that are are listening by way of Internet are live now or will some hear maybe uh the tapes then I ask you if you will to just do me one favor and that is to listen all the way to what I have to say because that way you know I can say something you you say well I don't agree with that well you you might find out that it's right so you know just uh just do the best you can and listen and and everything because we're not trying to uh beat on nobody because of a a situation or an existence uh I've done this many times before and I think it's NE necessary to do and then I I receive the question there and I I generally do this about every 3 or 4 Years anyway is to run a series and and speak on marriage and divorce because we're constantly getting new people in and and I want you to know what I believe you know that's the thing that I want you to know is what I believe and then you say well I don't agree with that's all right that's no problem just just see whether it's in the word or not you know we we just find out if it's in the Bible if it's in the prophet's message now if we preaching to the denominations and things we wouldn't be able to speak the things we do here because they wouldn't follow it or believe it but yet we can can uh speak on them here and and say this is what we believe you know and if you hear don't believe what I believe about it then that's up to you to to you know answer for your own conscience of of what is doings but let's see what the Bible says and see what the prophet has to say you know and that way we can cover it in that form okay Luke 1 Matthew 1 Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you for all things and Lord we thank you for the testimonies we've heard tonight there will being with little brother Ryan's baby Lord and stopping to bleeding and the and all of the things we thank you for all things that you've done Among Us and and we praise you Your Great Name because you are great and Lord we ask you now to just come and let us meditate upon these things speak about them and Lord just deliver our heart and soul to the people as to what we believe and why we believe it and just let your love be made manifest with each one of us we love you and we thank you bless the sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe you and Lord just have your way and Lord just let the Revival begin in me because that's what we need tonight more than anything in the world is a Revival in our hearts we know that there's not going to be a worldwide sweeping Revival but we know the bride has promised a Revival and Lord we've been in a Revival ever since we came in this message as to the opening of the word now come on the scene to make that manifest in our hearts and lives in the last days and it's not hard to pray that because you promised it you see it would be here so we believe you father just as we look out there and see all of the world and see what the Bible has said about it being then we look to Thy word to see what you said about all the other things and the promises unto each one of us we love you and we thank you Father forgive our sins cleanse us and guide each and every one of us in Jesus name amen he Luke I just shortened the the part from Luke and then we can go over to Matthew to pick up the other part as to what we we want to you know to cover but Luke 1:26 and we will read it and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell thou thou that art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women okay now we'll go over to Matthew because if we read the other part it would be basically what it will be saying in Matthew so we go to Matthew 1 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when is his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost amen and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus or he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying you go back into Isaiah Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and thou shall shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us then Joseph being raised from the sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now what I said what we're going to do is we're going to cover of what is a marriage we're going to go through the the Bible and we're going to go through uh you know the prophet's message and like I said if we was out in the denominations we would be taking the Bible and we would only be saying well I believe this well another person would take the other part of the Bible I believe this well I don't believe that I believe this and see then you know it would become up and has made a uh Masterpiece of confusion because the prophet said anytime you get to talking on Bible terminologies marriage and divorce comes up because that's everybody's idea or thought they want to know uh you know what it is well we're here in the end time and being here in the end time we ought to uh be able to believe the message of the hour and go to the message for the answer instead of saying I believe it's this or I believe it's that amen because uh misinterpreted theology brother random said which is man's ideas placed upon the word of God right has made the mass confusion well if the same thing is still here in the message of the hour with the prophet's message that has been brought Mass confusion is around the the message or the hour about marriage and divorce or whatever you know and things and and that's just normal because you're dealing with human beings long as you're dealing with human beings you got human problems I believe cuz that's what happened with Eve in the garden right she said I believe and that messed this whole thing up all right now don't don't try to go in into and you're thinking of divorces and things until we get back and speak on it okay amen because you're going to be running your mind out here and and you're you're not going to understand what's over here let me give you an example just came to me in the study there a while ago uh suppose we didn't have a prophet's message and as I said a moment ago we would have the Bible and by that Bible it has made Miss interpreted theology right amen all kind of mass confusions you're okay here you're not okay here this group here that group here and all like that and and they will none of them take all of what the Bible says all right now we will show these things as we get on into the message more and I believe every scripture is inspired of God and it is God's word all right but now we must get it lined up correctly because if we don't then we will misinterpret what is being said sensible all right now in the organized religion world and probably a lot of people in this message are believe in the same thing uh they don't believe that uh you know that an engagement is a wedding all right now I I know maybe I'm carnal and that's that's just I just like to speak carnal a lot of time if we was an organized religion and talking about an engagement and you'd say an engagement is wedding say I'm putting this in here now because it'll pop up in somebody's mind so you'll just realize that the Holy Spirit can answer something before you ask it all righten now suppose we had no message of the hour to go to and we would run it backwards and forth and try to pick up this or that or the other out of the scripture or even having the message of the hour we would just pick out what we want now to have a marriage let's see how I can State how are you going to have a divorce upon what we believe of marriage according to the world standards and denominationalism and let's say the people of the message a lot of how can you have a divorcement okay but you see if you can have an engagement oh in the correct order you can have a divorcement all right now putting this in because I know it's going to come up see in your mind so that's why somebody will somewhere see if you're engaged that's a vow right right then if you're divorced you know what that is that's breaking a v amen no it's legal paper see you can't solve the problem in Humanity's mind amen they won't even listen to you whatever grounds will constitute a marriage right to reverse that grounds would constitute a divorce you following me right now you want me to state that again whatever constitutes a marriage a reversal of that would constitute a divorce because you're going to have to deal with a lot of things see um not throwing off on the the African people or whatever but you know what I say is true there is places where you just step over a stick and you're married right well do you step back over the stick the other way and you're divorced what but there's got to be some form or or way of handling things and they have one you know they have their ways of doing you know of constituting a marriage and they have their ways of constituting the fact that it's not a marriage anymore and see a vow is a vow and a divorce is disan that vow to take it away so I'll put that in before you start then when we get into the message the then you realize that I'm cutting it off now if you don't have the much you know if you don't think on it that because you know a lot of people have the concept of weddings and a lot of things or marriages as to being this way that away whatever this is that is it's going to be here that got to be there but just remember wherever it's at whether it's stepping over a stick there has already been a vate all right that is your vow all right now that's why you know automatically then that brother Dale believes no and we will try to prove by the Bible that a marriage is not when you're given the right to go to bed together that's right if it was how you going to divorce that you see to put them up front see and I'm not picking on nobody I'm just putting up front to point so we better settle down in to see what the prophet in the Bible has to say amen all right then we can take our thoughts and ideas that's why I chose to title it for a while we'll be marriage and divorce but we will be dealing what is a marriage or what constitutes a marriage we won't be talking about a wedding because see you have your vows you have your engagements you have you know the things of that then you have a wedding supper and and then you have a wedding well then in some countries you have the vows and and the things and you you have a this and then you have a wedding supper on the other end of it or something cuz we're going to the wedding supper in the sky all right so now remember also that the thing that I've always taught you that the only way I can follow anything in the correct line up for me now is I must see by my new birth amen when anything is cuz if it don't line up in my new birth then then I can't believe it right well you just don't believe the word it's all right we'll find out whether we do or not but that's all right what do you judge it by see a lot of people in the message are still judging things by what their organizational mind was before they came in the message and that's what the hindrance is it's what grandma taught him you know what was taught by the churches they came from still makes a bearing upon our minds and our thinking and in doing that then it makes it into a a mass confusion all right but now let's just deal with what is a marriage CU there's no need to speak on a divorce until we find out what a marriage is right see then we'll be able to easily find out what a divorcement can be all right now I wrote this cuz I write my own notes to myself there's many people that believe in many different ways or thoughts about what is a marriage you know what constitutes a marriage and that's why I chose to use the word marriage and not the word wedding because if you if you talk about wedding everybody have the same thought because wedding is a terminology of the day wedding you know getting we're getting married wedding see that's what most people thinks is is when you stand before the preacher and repeat your vows that you're married right all right now some believe when you go to the bedroom you know what I'm see honeymoon that that's when you're married right but you see how would you tie that together to get it to come out to the right order and especially tight with your new birth now see let's go through and let's see that there's a process and Wade's going to cover these later so I'm not going through it uh of the dating the things like that all right he's going to get into that so I'm not going to go through that okay uh he can use the he can take the time to express those things we will mention something things as we go along but you know a man told me one time he said you can go up to courthouse and he said you can see that I've never been married at one time well what he meant was the paperwork right I mean sensible that's what he meant he only had paperwork but how many times was he engaged before them or whatever you know see we we need to get down to the to the bar facts of it and just put it down and say well this is it and let's see what we're going to do see there can't be a divorce until first there's a marriage all right now I got it wrote here quote this to you that are listening in by way of the internet or by the way of the tape systems uh please pay me enough respect to listen to All That is said about the point of what is a marriage or what makes a marriage or what will make a divorce you owe me that much because you listen to a one-sided thing you get a one-sided story all right see then you won't know what's being said all right now as I said whatever would constitute a marriage the reversal of that will constitute a divorce see we think of divorce as the paperwork at the court we think of a marriage is the paperwork at the court you know right but see that's not scriptural that's not what we read there in the Bible now we put a lot of emphasis go ahead brother um Anderson pull back up Matthew 1 those who want to even use the quotes of a spouse Etc will only mention that it says to Joseph fear not to take unto the Murray thy wife all right but look what the scripture say now the birth of Jesus Christ on this life when his mother Mary was a spoused to Joseph that's easy to con engaged the word engaged is only used one time in the Bible that's in the Old Testament so that's a modern terminology of forms of word words okay it's only used one time in the old test the word engage is is used different but listen we'll prove in the minute the spouse to gug and all will be the same word all right let's see mother Mary was spoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband see we're quick to to speak about if you're not to take unto thee marry thy wife we don't look at the other where it says in Joseph her husb husband being a just man you know and the Lord appeared unto him and and tells him you know that it's conceed then it says you know and reminds him of the scriptures that a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child all right now here's a little point that I just always try to put in on marriage and divorce had it not been that Joseph had accepted Mary what would happen to her she would have been stoned right you agree that was the law she would have been stoned all right now A Father's protection of a dog of a his daughter is one thing and we'll cover that but a husband has the greater Authority amen because he's taking her unto himself amen the father is only covering his daughter you understand so the Bible said it was her husband amen and she was his wife now they were only a spouse and before they came together now we understand terminologies we know what that means right amen right before they came together all right now in doing that let's think about it husband and wife how did they become husband and wife and I'm asking the point why was it not just a father's protection for a virgin to be able to conceive are you listening why wasn't just a father in his disallow allowing of vows etc etc as we get into Deuteronomy but it says her husband see because the husband would would be the only one who would have the perfect total legal authority of the word of God to be able to take her and we know there was no father back there in Genesis but Adam had to take Eve all right now we know that Joseph never knew Eve never knew Mary until she conceived the child but the Bible said never and knew or not he knew or not until she F the baby was born all right see because that wouldn't that would have been wrong for him to done that right but he was the only one that could protect her right so look the way God does things that's right had he sent a virgin without a protective covering they would have killed her right so he sent it to where that it would be the husband that would protect you know her all right in other words marry her not intercourse that's what everybody want to do in the message with Adam and Eve you know he had intercourse with her to save her no no no no he took her as his wife that's right the Intercourse was a secondary right but see it meant it had to be a husband and the husband part comes in on the part that they were a spouse all right now we're going to use a lot of scriptures and lot of things together so I hope you'll follow with us and in Luke 1:27 go ahead brother Anderson I want to give you the verses and the word and then the definition okay so that way you will see you know what's going on in luk we find to a virgin a spouse to a man all right what does the word espouse mean the word espouse house comes from the Greek word 3423 and don't ask me to pronounce him big old words cuz I ain't got the education forget it but it means a spouse in other words but the definition is to woo her and ask her in marriage now that's the word of spouse see to be promised in marriage be betr betro is not a new testament word it is not used in the New Testament it is only used um nine times I think that's right I'll get to it in a minute and tell you it's used in the Old Testament it's an Old Testament word but you'll find a definition for that but what's the definition of the word espoused all right we'll find in a minute it means engaged all right now we will find in a little bit when what what is an engagement now I like to cover the whole thing where you don't have no problems with what is an engagement or a spouse or a betro it means when a boy has asked a girl to marry him and she accepts that's amen now if he asked her to marry him that don't make a marriage that's right amen you understand right right cuz it did you just walk down the street and say I accept you as my wife I accept you as my wife I accept you as my that's the way the world's done it you know in a roundabout way but that would be the carnality of mankind I Know a Man one time that a lady sang a song and he told went and told her said you're my wife you know she wound up in his wife so evidently it didn't work out but that didn't make her his wife is my point because he went and told her all right so so Joseph and Mary if you want the quotes I can give them to you where brother R said they would set out on the porch after Sunday school or after going to church and and said they would talk about the Bible and the things you know right and that finally Mary told Joseph you know all right but the word espoused it means to woo her and to ask her in marriage to be promised in marriage or be betr now girls if some Boy comes along and ask you to marry and we're not talking we're not playing kids okay all kids which they shouldn't do it cuz they've heard the people do it but you know the little kids and I come in from school one day and she said that mama said so and so is going together well I mean you're 5 years old I want to know where they going I mean I'm done I said where they going you know now you know what I mean they're going together well now how many times you girls and how many times little boys have you got into discussions with things with girls and boys don't do that because it's it's improper you know and after you reach a certain age you're accountable that's right amen all right we will cover the vows and things probably in another message but you're accountable Billy Paul come to his daddy he said Daddy that I'm getting married brother brother told him to go stick his head in a bucket or something he went in and told his mother that they was getting married and said she laughed at him now brother Brown said he married some common grade school now what is a common grade school it would have to be probably 8th or ninth grade or 10th grade would be common right I don't know what the word common means when you're talking about schools anybody know what year is it I mean is it fifth grade sixth grade seventh grade what I don't know but he said some common grade but he said they got married and he said they was married he said we had to wedding an old her father and I but he refused to do his own son's wedding cuz he said he's married he so just get to point now what brother Dale believes whether you want to believe it even with all we read when a girl a boy ask a girl to marry now come on we're in a day when a girl ask the boys right right right well some of you boys say well now I never asked her she asked me well did you accept her and we would read where the Prophet said boy girl see we don't play we we try to bring it by the truth but see just don't make your vows because Matthew I got it in here somewhere by your words you be justified and by your words you be condemned that's Matthew 12:37 right all right so don't make and play games parents teach your children not to play games amen you know wedding games if we'd have been taught that way all the way down then when some boy ask a girl to marry her then you know but you see what I'm getting at a wedding what is a marriage Joseph and Mary was married right amen but they never lived together as husband and wife until after the baby was born that's right now I've looked to try to find this but I'm sure that anybody with common sense ought to realize Joseph and Mary somewhere went on and went through the fact of vows wouldn't you think so somewhere in that one year don't you think that they would because he protected her irregardless of whether you believe that or not it don't make no difference that's all right because they had already made their vows when he asked her to marry him and she accepted God counted him married and called him husband and wife called him a spoused all right now in doing that look what you turn out to be the word espoused is used the same way in Matthew 1:18 I don't have to pull that one up it is the word of spouse which comes from the 3223 which is to to woo her and ask her in marriage see that would turned out to be a wedding all right now the word espoused is used five times one time in the old Testament and four times in the New Testament all right now Paul uses the word espoused in 2 Corinthians 112 all right for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused y now when we cover in this I want you to think on it uh foreign countries a lot of lot of places they pick the husband and wife you know right especially the uh the wife for the husband and you know they go through that they they don't give them now brother per even said they do know about the things and kind of in an agreement form and know about it a lot of times but a lot of times they're just put together and maybe they might be put together when they're young as as far as counting them married some of you your African folks you know what I'm talking about in your your countries and what you do but it's still a it's still when you come together according to them it's a wedding right because that's the custom the ways and to do it so look what Paul said Paul said for I have espoused you Paul said us because that a word a spouse Paul is saying I set you to Christ to be married to him I've set you aside because that Greek word is 718 all right and watch it says to join or to fit together to betro a daughter to anyone to join to oneself in other words to marry the daughter of any one to bet TR to give one in marriage to anyone all right Paul is saying I have given you I have by the gospel I preached unto you I have espoused you to Christ see because those that received the new birth under Paul's message was espoused to Christ all right that's even you and I see we're still being espoused to Christ by Paul and his his message I'm just giving you the fact of what it means even to the word espouse I just used one time in 2 Samuel 3:14 in the Old Testament and David sent Messengers to whatever who the name is Char son saying deliver me my wife Michelle which I spouse to me for 100 forkins of the Philistines all right now that's when David goes back you remember the whole story his wife she goes off marries a guy he comes back and they send over there to get her you remember the story they go over there to get her want I mean David wants her you know to come back because you know she's his spoused really wanted her just because she was the King's Daughter and to keep his record running good you know make everything okay but beside the point I'm getting at the point what the word means David knew that she was espouse to him they had never come together as husband and wife she was spouse David gets run off and all givs her to somebody else huh well look what the word of it it means see to betr or engaged engaged to be betral all right so David had an understanding there that that is my wife we were engaged all right now then that would cover that part the word engaged the word engaged because it can mean Engage The Enemy engage the truth the enemy you know but the word engaged which is taken from Jeremiah 30 and 21 and the noble shall be of themselves and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them and I will cause him to draw near and he shall approach unto me for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me sayth the Lord now someone engaged his heart or dedicated or set his heart cuz that meaning of that word is to pledge comes from the Hebrews 6148 it means to pledge to exchange mortgage engage occupy undertake for give pledges to to become you know you read all the rest of the definition don't it's just meaning of it's the same word for engage because then we' see that engage and the spouse is the same word right all right now let's go over to the word betro the word betro is used only uh three times and it's only in the Old Testament is actually the word betro but the word betro all right is used nine times and they're all in the Old Testament form so we look at the wording now if a Downs that is a verion be betroth unto a husband and a man find her to sit in line with her now we'll get more to that and explain it after a while if we have time tonight we will get into to that point so just hang on to what I'm getting the definitions of the words okay it comes from strongs 3259 which is mean to fix a point assembly meet set betr to a point assign designate to meet in other words coming out to be something set or the point because it's the same word betroth she was betro this virgin be betro she she was engaged she was a spoused she had made her vows as to the boy they had made their vows because that's where you're married at you're married by your vows you're not married by what the law says it's not whether the law says it it's whether you say it and what you mean now I I know we live in a day when um what president was it said he he couldn't remember Reagan was it Reagan had a lapse of memory believe it's right we're in we're in the day when people want to have laps of memory you know and they'll say I really can't remember whether he asked me or I asked him but we've been married for 40 years you know or we've been living together and people in the message has got it going real good you know as long as you don't have the long as you don't make your vows and as long as you don't go down to the justice of peace and get you just live together all you want to and have 14 kids and then separate and just go somewhere else you know you want be nine names okay no we need to but it's there CU it's a garbage can right now I don't mean the truth of marriage and divorce the truth of marriage and divorce is wonderful cuz it types your new birth that's what I'm G all the go PA said I espoused you the same word for your new birth that you're espoused to Jesus Christ by that new birth is in you is the same word that Joseph and Mary was a spoused right it's the same word that we make our vows as husband and wife is a spouse see we can come up and say well I don't really remember what's the problem you can sure remember the day you've done this that and the other why can't you remember what's going on that's blunt sorry but listen right now according to the Bible if you're engaged if you make your vows you know the boy asks the girl she accepts then that's an engagement amen that's a spouse right that's betroth that's what I'm giving all those words for am CU it all turn out to be the same same thing something set to a point and even like a foreign country we covered where the mama and the daddy they pick out for their son a wife and they go through the Diaries or what those words are you know and paying for it and all this that and the other now probably there's not word there in their languages means engaged right I remember when I was in Brazil and I had made that mistake of saying meat you know the sister was a help meat and the guy interpreted help meat me8 and I'm me T all right so it got a problem so I said all right what's your word it was what I asked I said what is your word for me our our marriage and God pointed to his ring and said commitment all right that was their word they it now the word engaged and now the word betral it was commitment right now maybe they got it in their language you understand what I'm saying I'm just trying to to speak but you see we claim stupidity in our minds that we don't know that when the law even tells you that what is it you you you can't plead uh that you don't know when something what is it ignorance ignorance yeah you stand out on the side the highway and you're standing there and you walked out of your house you walk down to the front of your driveway at home and you stand there and two guys gets in the car and they drag race you're an accomplice whether you want to agree with it or not they go all get you for that right you don't have to be all of these other things all right now they might not have the words Kenya might not have the words espoused engaged betrothed Etc but they've got a word there that the couple has made their commitment in one form and the other now they can't step over the stick come on right it ain't a guy that goes gets his wife and say step over his s and you mind no they're not dumb they have to take mergency test you want to read from your Prophet they're supposed to all right the commitment is your mindset you understand that's right in the state of Georgia if you live together over 24 hours with the thoughts of getting married you are called common law marriage whether you like it or not see because they know you had some form of commitment this is not just a point of grabbing somebody's hand step over a stick and you're married I saw a a documentary on a wedding one time where this man over here was going goes over to you know and he asked the father's permission he gets all of the different things and he offers the dowy and he builds a house they ain't stepped over the stick yet and they're not living together it's just their vows but they're married when they've commit themselves I got tick with that one because the way that everything went but it they finally got married you know what they finally stepped over into his little house he built you and you know what is married but now we'll cover later what I know going have time tonight that if he found some uncleanness in her right that's right some problem righten he's automatically divorced and killed right so let's get it straight an engagement is a marriage right yes sir when you ask that girl to marry you and she accepted yep you marryed that's right now that don't give you no right to go out and start living together right right that's unclean living right the state don't even allow that you know you're not supposed to do it we'll read what the Propet is say but you see still when you ask that girl to marry you and she accepts according to the Bible the way I see it amen Joseph and Mary went through that process and they were a spouse right amen remember she goes over to see Elizabeth and tells Elizabeth she's caring a child well you and Joseph done got married now that's a word that goes up married no because the word married is interchangeable you can use the word marriage to refer you know people say when you married now if you don't agree with this just Coast it down but suppose sister brother collie you and sister Ruth went through the vows you know of your own asking that's not the wedding vows at the church now the asking is your vow all right then somebody come along and say you you and you and and James married no right that's right well because it's an engagement all right but as far as God is concerned CU it's not a drunken magistrate will read it your Prophet said joins you together he really says it this way it said what God has joined together let no man put us under he said not what a drunken magistrate he said that can be put us under anytime you know they can just divorce married whatever going on but what is a wedding now a marriage I'm just talking about you accepting you the boy asking you accept that's what I'm talking about far as God is concerned you're married right amen right and we can cover more into these other things but girls and boys amen girls and boys you have a virginity Paul speaks of both girls and boys men and women whatever man has a virginity as well as a woman we're in the day the man can like my mother used to say the the man can get out and commit adultery and run around and do all kind of things and put a suit on go to church and he called a brother make him a good Deacon yeah cuz he ain't been to the courthouse and got married cuz we don't believe it in having a deacon here that's married it's more than one time you know she said a woman do one thing she got to wear an adultery around her neck you used to do that right right but see that's not the Bible the Bible Paul tells you of the the man with his virginity as well as the woman with her virginity all right now the same way he can cover those fors when he gets to it all right does everybody understand what I'm saying not I ain't ask you never ask nobody to agree with me you know that I ask you what does the word say am right now we don't want to get into all the others we're going to get into divorce if you get into the other parts of it we're going to get into the divorce situation let's stick to the marriage all right well then according to a spouse engaged mro when you ask the girl that she accept you you're married that's in God's eyes amen right you go and marry somebody else we'll read in a minute when the prophet tells you what that turned out to be boy ask a girl to marry him and she accepts and the girl goes off and Mar somewhere outse she's committing adultery but it's the same for him if he ask her and he goes off and Mar married somebody else he's living in adultery right am that's right that's Bible that ain't our thoughts and ideas so it's straight blunt plain we can get down into really some some scriptures if you want to in the prophet's definition but we'll just try to stay with it as best we can all right let's go to what the prophet had to say about a wedding but the first quote brother which we have seen his star in the east and come to worship Him 63126 let's see what brother brand man to say you talking about the almighty God and raled Joseph in a dream and Joseph was a good man he was son of David and was espouse to Mary and I'd like to pass this on before we go further espousal in the East was the same as marriage is betral now if I pronounce that word wrong you make it right okay as soon as they as they were espoused they were married when that sacred vow between them was taken read Deuteronomy 22:23 and you will find out that when this woman and man agreed to be married yet they did not take the vows for months later you know what he's talking about they didn't go before the the the preacher and repeat the vows all right you understand it if they did not take the V for month later if they even broke that vow they were guilty of adultery that's right when they were spoused they were just the same as marriage marriage the law had not given them rights to live together as husband and wife yet but before God when they promised one another their words were sealed in God's kingdom and to break that was just committing adultery and now Joseph was a spouse to Mary if Minister Brothers you'd study that right now right good and clear you up on this marriage and divorce case that's so so hard and different among most of the people today and notice Joseph her husband being a just man see now we find out that this could not be broken so now a spousal marriage go to the next one questions and answers 1964 8:30 the evening and the morning service book three M he's talking and bringing it down so you get all of it above and what it was this was a most of you know the story this is a man he comes walks into a church and he gets into the church and when he does he's coming in and there's nobody there and all at once he hears a man and a woman down at the front of the church and they're exchanging vows so when they get through and kiss and start out you know he stops and asks them you know what was going on so here's what the answer after a while he noticed here come he heard somebody talking he slipped up there to look and looked around to see whether it was the custodian it was a man in a woman standing before the altar holding one another's hand and said I take you dear to be my lawfully weeded wife see she said I take you dear to me my lawfully wted husband well he said this is a strange thing said this Pentecostal he said this man in woman getting married without a preacher and so we just sat down so we just sat down and waited and after they made their vows to live true to one another only death would separate them they put their arms around one another kissed each other turned around and walked out smiling he said just a moment he said I'm kind of curious I'm a stranger said you all getting married said yes without a preacher he said no then we've been married 40 years he said we've got and watch it we've been married 40 years he said we got married right here at this altar 40 years ago and every year we come back and renew our vows that's a good idea but as far as married when you promised her she takes your word and that's why I covered that a while ago it's not you just ask her and then she has nothing to do with it you know don't play that part where you women you don't have anything to do with I ask you and you're married to me now is she don't accept right all right she takes your word you take her word god takes both of you so just don't promise all right don't do the promises look at the next one now this is a continuation of reading so we'll go all the way down this is questions and ansers 60 question aners book two really is what's the two on there for on the old Styles 64 823 the evening service paragraph 193 through 197 I think brother Brandon what is the meaning of enement are people free to marry or is this just another word for divorce I would like some information on this sure they're married as long as they take that vow they're married just like a boy if a boy promises a girl to marry her under good faith he's obligated to that girl he's just as good as married to her the only thing the law does is gives you a Bill of Rights to live together to keep from being common law husband and wife but when a man tells a woman I will marry you honey I will take you for my wife will you take he's married your vow is sacred that's what marries you anyhow there's not no preacher can marry you no magistrate or nothing else it's your own vow to God and to this man when you promise you are married when you promise you're married it's not some preacher look at you say brother bradam is that you say you said you only answered that by the Bible did you want the Bible on it raise your hands if you want it now we got about six or eight minutes all right Joseph her husband being a just man her spouse husband already called her husband Joseph her husband being a just man who was mindly to put her away privately on this wi but before they came together she was found with a child of the Holy Ghost and the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said Joseph thy son of David fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife already married he's already promised her and of and little lady if you promise to marry that boy you're obligated to do it if you marry another after that obligation you will from now on anyhow you see you will be living in adultery and notice the same thing the boy promising to Mar a woman don't you make your vow to anybody unless you mean to stick with it remember there's the Bible for it Joseph promised to marry Mary and God said that's that that was read the Old Testament laws on that see the old test law if you promised to marry a young married woman and you married another one you was committing adultery and it drow you out of the camp yes sir you have to keep your vows when you promise a woman that she's a sacred little vessel and that's to bring CH child life into the world again so when you promise her you must marry her and that's why when somebody comes to me I ask this question I say have either one of you been married before they'll automatically say no okay question number two has either one of you ever been engaged if you have I will not do the wi now you know what I'm saying if they were engaged and the boy got killed or the girl got killed we got scripture right we're not F talking foolish come on we're talking a straight line of what it is I ask those questions I do not see in my ability as a minister to ask a boy has he ever had a girlfriend right you may differ with me on these ministers out there go ahead show me where it's at I do not see in my Ministry or far to what I can ask the girl has she ever had a boyfriend and you know what I mean by had on the boy and the girl because I always tell them the ones of you that have PR to me and that you know what I said I said your life between you two is your responsibility that's right if you've been untrue and he marries you and you don't tell him the prophet says he can put you away I explained this to them to the point of understanding it it's not from my my point of wanting to have the itch and ear to delve into what's going on it's my point to be blunt but I tell them say if you don't straighten up your life now if you don't tell that boy what you've done or that girl what you've done you're going to have trouble down the road so get it out of the way now right amen and why did God I would do it my wife is sitting there before I would ask her to marry her and I was a sinner lost in the world I told her before we talk about marriage I want to tell you my life right I didn't know the prophets and the message or anything but I wanted that straight I said I want no problems when we get married things to come up that you don't know about I want it to be settled here then if you want to marry me okay but I want to tell you and I even told her God I didn't know I said you don't have to tell me but I got to tell you cuz that was in my heart she didn't have any problems to tell me I had a lot of problems to tell her see a lot of preachers would disqualify that okay go ahead maybe I'm not supposed to be preaching okay but you show me one preacher in this world that can stand it the test of the word that's why we better all believe in grace and marriage and divorce that's right I don't care how pure you are you better believe in it we'll get down to those things all right so where did we get to we finish that one up then okay let's go to the next one which is invisible Union the Bri of Christ now if you'll notice these these points that I've been bringing out here have all been at least from the seals on up CU a lot of people thinks he changed his mind later so we just keep it above the seals and things okay so look what he says on invisible Union on the Bri 65 11:25 paragraph 83 Joseph fear not take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost he was minded to put her away privately see after he had already engaged to her when you're engaged to her as far as God is concerned ConEd you married to her okay that's his words right going on to the next one God in his is his own interpreter 64 205 it was so unusual until a good man by the name of Joseph her husband being a just man was not willing to make her a public example that good man in those days how it must have been with Joseph when he was engaged ESP spoused to Mary she was espoused in that day to break that was just the same as committing adultery and of course to Joseph it seemed like that Mary was trying to use him for a blockade or make him a shield for her wrong see another The Shield you see what I'm talking about want to go he could Shield her cuz the law couldn't kill her he had to cast the first stone right right now because here she was found to be a mother not being married only engaged a trick like that would be stoned to death it to be by the law the presence of God unrecognized 64 618 when no man should ever kiss a woman I'm just putting this one in wait you can use this one later till he Mar till he is married to her that's male and female glands Crossing let it be wherever it may be it's wrong it's potentially a set that when male and my glance touch it's a second and it's made a man kiss a man in the mouth remember this is 65 come on remember this is 65 64 now that you got the men with ksing the man in the mouth you know that and the women ksing the women in the mouth but he was the old school right which we already be he said Mak him vom or a woman a woman even said one time he said men don't kiss on greeting he said it starts homosexuality you want that quote and we hug each other's neck say I love you but we don't kiss each other that it's a sex act that's right the Tope of Christ kissing his bride they used to never do that let's see is that the one never never kiss a woman till he he till he is married to her that's right all right now not one in year and there is another one that where he says that let that be when the veil is lifted and folks we're not throwing off on nobody we tell it like it is I asked this question in the Bible study one night I said is there any couple here they can say that they never kissed and I was referring to each other you know not who else kissed and never kissed before they married and I had one couple Bob and Monica thank God Amen there was one couple but the question is how many of you ever kissed right it means ever kissed you come on kiss he said all this slopping and kissing in all the movies and see people meet and they kiss and all he said don't do that he all this TV stuff he said that's the sex plan's Crossing he said that's potential adultery don't do it it shouldn't be done we say are you guilty I've been guilty so have you no we don't gloat we brag on Christ and pray for him to set us free right all right go to the next one this this from below the seals but 62 318 spoken word the original seat paragraph 58 a woman engaged to a fine young clean man and before they come together once she's done she is found pregnant by somebody else then her own seed which is betro and what's what he said her own seed her own body amen which is betro to her boyfriend her engaged husband is found full of seed of another man what a disgrace that's exactly what Adam found that's what Christ has found couldn't wait that's what's the matter with the people today they can't wait for the real Holy Spirit to take the church in position they got to manufacture something work up something initial evidence speaking in tongues to get more members in the church all these kind of a Tommy Rock instead of waiting upon the Lord for the real manifestation of the resurrection of Christ making himself known among the people you can't wait bringing people into the church I get tickled at people let me say this you know people leave one church and go to another they say they're leaving the word cuz they left us I've never said that about nobody that's ever left here you find it see if I ever said that somebody left a word when they left here a lot of you said they left the word when they left here I never said why because that's their own business and my Point's always been one thing CU we can use it what we want to you got people leaving your church going somewhere else you say they're leaving the word well you know what the people over there where they coming to they said they're coming to the word so whe it's EMP now are filling up everybody uses it the way they want to use it all right come into the word okay let's go to the next one that's 1962 211 I want to get this part in here we'll try to we'll use the other scriptures next time for the V now the church now is engaged to Christ listen far the wedding that's what Paul said I spous you I've engaged you you see that's like I said the start with if you get tight with your new birth what do you got when you're New Birth you accepted Jesus Christ right and he accepted you that might just be justification but it's the beginning and you know that holds because you want quotes on this that's what's wrong with the organized religion they accepted Jesus Christ he accepted them then they went out and start burying children to something else prove their an adulterous right come on now the church now is engaged to Christ for the wedding now listen before you click out there somebody listening just remember I do know how to read the prophet will talk about engaged we're only engaged and he may use the word that we're already married don't we get married here right right and what's he saying the same thing I've been trying to prove to you that when you're engaged you're married right amen amen when you engage to Jesus Christ you're married to him amen when you have a new birth you're married to Christ Paul is espoused us brother R spouses to Christ but watch it the words he used now the church now is engaged to Christ for the wedding the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the Lamb I see you spiritualize bring that all back down here it's okay but just remember we're going up there right right there is some things to take place don't spiritualize it so much until you spiritualize everything out of existence I've heard people say it ain't going to be no future on CU you're looking at it beating on the chest that's preachers in this message so just get it right we're engaged to Jesus Christ as far as God is concerned we are already married to him that's right but we are going to a wedding supper amen right and then we're going to have a honeymoon righten listen the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the Lamb do you see that the church is now engaged like a man engaged to his wife what does he do while you they're engaged he's just bestoring all kind of gifts all kind of things upon her go ahead to the next one 6 seal 63 323 paragraph 359 it's a time for The Sixth Seal pretty soon to be open and when she does oh my the end the bride has done gone forth what she's done the Queen's done went to take her place she's being married now to the king see iate that one and you got the quote for now but watch it he is being married now to the king while this was going on what six seal we're going to a wedding in the sky right but we're already married to him there just steps to go through the climax the thing look at the next one the future home paragraph 495 64802 help us Lord if there's one here that's called to this wedding supper of the Lamb this thousand years of millennial Reign and to then ENT into the city after the honeymoon is over the Millennium is merely the honeymoon then she the bride takes his bridegroom takes his bride home it's hers her bridegroom his bride oh he's gone to prepare our house amen since we've become engaged amen so what's the prophet saying well end on that do we're engaged to it now right as far as he's concerned we're married as far as we're concerned we're married to Christ right the word read spoken word Original Seed and you'll see what went wrong we were married to him already amen we haven't been to the wedding ceremony yet we haven't been to the marriage supper yet we haven't had a honeymoon yet so it's still right right the day you're engaged is the day you're married right that's the prophet's message in the Bible and we'll get to the espousal on the next on the vows we don't have time they sh want to stay till 10:30 course all we say you go outside we quit 10 at 9 you go outside and stay with 10 talking when he day going fool you preach to 10 but I won't because the mind can only comprehend what the seek can endure so back on these things what constitutes a marriage what's the word constitute or forms or makes or whatever word you want to use when are you married to Christ by the New Birth by your V that you've accepted him as your savior and he's accepted you sir you marri it when the boy asks the girl to marry him and she accepts we call that an engagement but God calls it a marriage but the r parts of the marriage is not complete because in in the spiritual there's a wedding supper for us to go to and we're going to be getting married according to the prophet while the world is getting blowed away down here you know blowed up it's going to be a beautiful thing to see our bridegroom amen you know that how many types do you want or thoughts who was it that went down and got somebody help me said her husband for Isaac Rebecca went down she'd never seen him right right right but he sent a DIY and she accepted his word through who was the eler she'd never seen Isaac that's right amen but that was her husband that's that's right when she agreed to go that was her accepting his offer amen right eler took the offer and presented it that's what Paul's talking about he presented any Christ to you and I and espoused us to Christ this prophet's message has presented Christ to you and I yes we know what our bridegroom looks like she knew so much about him till when she got close she said is that Isaac standing out in the field he said yes she just jumped right off that cam took off right that through that now they never run in the house jumped in bed that's what everybody thinks a wedding is that consummates a wedding that brings it on in to a bedroom a fire it was probably no telling how long because there were a lot of things that had to be going through getting her prepared to get married and one day her and Isaac was married but to show how p and true it was Isaac never took her to the new home he took her to his father's house is that Bible then went to her his house you see brother R says in John what is it in my house are many mansions it would not so I would have told you but R said that's so theop in other words that's right he said but that's not the future home he said when I go to prepare a place for you he said he up there right now making us a future home you were in the father's house right where Isaac and Rebecca went to to get married we're here being married to Christ yes cuz he's my husband but there's many more things to take place stand many more things that take place we'll get into the vows and the things next Wednesday and cover those if you want to read Deuteronomy 22 read Deuteronomy 22 and study it then we'll cover the vows and the things to show what a wedding really is and how strong it is meant to be if we violate that we're to be killed don't go around boys and girls asking girls to marry you you don't mean it that's cheap talk I I heard one guy say one night said that him and a girl was out together said she said well I only do that if if you ask me to marry you he said well I'll ask you to marry you right now but he didn't mean anything by it cheap talk but remember God hears our word amen by our words we'll be justified by our words we will be condemned we're married to Christ right goad 9 94 the spir you have heard of mes in the you
