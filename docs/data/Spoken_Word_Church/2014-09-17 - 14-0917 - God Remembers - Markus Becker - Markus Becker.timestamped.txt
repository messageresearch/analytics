[1:05] everything
[1:06] brother luis can help us with other
[1:08] things later and telling us about it
[1:10] because he knows a lot about it and
[1:11] things but it's kind of a
[1:14] thing showing you like when brother adam
[1:16] would speak of the squirrels then
[1:18] it relates to that area and that doings
[1:21] and the things you know

[1:27] and we have we will order some and let
[1:30] them
[1:30] you know let our brother bring him back
[1:32] to us but we just let him
[1:34] explain what he wants to to us and that
[1:37] way he can
[1:38] can bring it all out in the open and let
[1:40] us know what
[1:41] they're trying to do but we appreciate
[1:43] him and he's
[1:44] one he's living proof of one thing
[1:48] you know brother branham said east
[1:51] nation
[1:52] nation and things has a spirit and has
[1:54] this that or the other
[1:56] but you know the brother is living proof
[1:59] that the new birth
[2:01] can change you totally around
[2:05] he's a german supposed to be staunch
[2:08] and you know blunt but he you know what
[2:12] he's just like us
[2:13] i mean that's what we found out we made
[2:15] some good contact today
[2:17] while we're eating and just having a
[2:19] good time and all
[2:20] and i hope you see what i mean about it
[2:22] and i'm not throwing off on donations no
[2:24] nothing
[2:25] just being the truth about it the holy
[2:27] spirit can make us all
[2:29] be the same no matter where we're at so
[2:31] let's just sing
[2:32] open the eyes of my heart as brother
[2:34] marcus becker comes to speak unto us
[2:36] he's from germany he'll be here for a
[2:38] week or two and on and traveling
[2:40] so you pray for him but this this open
[2:43] the eyes of my heart
[2:48] open the eyes of my heart
[2:51] i want to see
[2:56] i want to see
[3:02] openly thank you very much
[3:30] in
[3:41] shining in the light of the glory
[4:12] maybe when the music is slightly playing
[4:15] uh
[4:16] that we are praying together again and
[4:17] maybe you're very slightly playing and
[4:20] while we were having our heads bowed and
[4:23] if somebody has a need on his heart that
[4:25] he may raise his hands to the lord and
[4:28] just as a little background heavenly
[4:29] father we are very thankful for this
[4:32] welcoming spirit father and my heart's
[4:35] desire is that you may speak
[4:37] to each and every one lord you made a
[4:40] certain subject on my heart and
[4:42] it seems that you want to encourage
[4:44] someone father
[4:45] on our way back home father we believe
[4:48] we came from eternity and we go back to
[4:50] eternity father
[4:52] lord on this earth lord we have a lot to
[4:54] go through
[4:56] but as david said the lord is my
[4:58] shepherd
[5:00] i shall not be in wand and may you
[5:03] especially speak to us this evening that
[5:06] have a little bit of a feebleness of a
[5:09] weakness maybe a little bit
[5:11] discouraged maybe frustrated from life
[5:14] and
[5:15] lord may you strengthen us with your
[5:18] power by the holy ghost and by the word
[5:21] we ask for this noble pastor for his
[5:23] church may you bless them and continue
[5:25] to bless them
[5:26] and may you bless every hand that's
[5:28] raised up to you
[5:30] and may you speak to us father ask it in
[5:33] jesus name
[5:35] amen hallelujah thank you very much the
[5:38] brothers god bless you richly
[5:40] and i think while we're standing we are
[5:42] starting with the opening of the word
[5:44] with the spirit with the scripture being
[5:45] read
[5:46] and i give some greetings but i think i
[5:49] don't want to let you stand that way
[5:53] and we are going to read uh the familiar
[5:56] scripture in the second book of kings
[6:00] in chapter 4 and verse
[6:03] 32 and it is the very famous
[6:06] story of elisha and the chunamide woman
[6:13] and when elisha was coming to the house
[6:16] behold the child was dead and laid upon
[6:19] the bed
[6:21] he went in there before and shut the
[6:23] door upon the twain
[6:24] and prayed unto the lord and he went up
[6:28] and lay upon the child and put his mouth
[6:30] upon his mouth and his eyes upon his
[6:33] eyes and his hands upon his hands
[6:36] and stretched himself upon the child and
[6:39] the flesh of the child waxed warm
[6:41] then he returned and walked in the house
[6:44] to and fro and went up and stretched
[6:46] himself
[6:46] upon and the child sneezed seven times
[6:50] and the child opened his eyes and he
[6:52] called gehasi and said call the
[6:54] shunamite
[6:55] so he called her and when she was coming
[6:58] unto him he said take up thy son then
[7:01] she went in and fell at his feet and
[7:03] bowed herself to the ground and took up
[7:05] her son
[7:06] and went out may the lord add his
[7:08] blessing to the reading of his word and
[7:11] we may be seated and pastor there is
[7:13] time for me to put up the jackets
[7:15] thank you very much you know i'm you
[7:17] made such nice compliments
[7:18] that i have to fulfill
[7:22] what you said and and i thank you very
[7:25] much
[7:25] for this nice invitation for me to be
[7:28] here
[7:28] and uh for the wonderful fellowship with
[7:30] the way for you yourself with the
[7:33] sisters
[7:33] for the eating and but the luis who's
[7:36] taking really care of me and
[7:38] for those who don't know me and my name
[7:40] is marcus becker i come from germany
[7:42] and i'm here for two weeks for exactly
[7:44] that project and if you
[7:46] you allow you just i just say just a
[7:48] word
[7:49] what we what we made is we were we were
[7:52] bringing
[7:53] all the events that happened in the
[7:55] later part of brother brandon we put
[7:57] them in between
[7:59] of his sermon titles so that if you
[8:02] see if you're reading a certain
[8:03] preaching of a certain message
[8:05] you understand what happened in the
[8:07] ministry of brother branham
[8:09] uh in the denominational world at that
[8:12] time we even put
[8:13] israel right into it what happened to
[8:15] israel exactly because
[8:16] i saw the israel flag we are standing so
[8:19] we are one in that thing
[8:20] i mean uh we love that country we love
[8:23] the gods people there
[8:24] so it is uh let me see while the
[8:27] supernatural books is is following
[8:29] certain let me say a certain line now
[8:31] this is a panoramic view about
[8:32] everything that happened around
[8:35] we understand that uh let me say that
[8:38] many of the young people is is they're
[8:41] not reading the message as they should
[8:43] and i understand it in that way because
[8:44] the message is a huge mountain of 1100
[8:47] books
[8:48] i mean where to start and what to end
[8:50] and so it is not
[8:52] it is so this message companion is
[8:54] explaining let me say
[8:56] uh telling the life and the and the
[8:58] events let me say like kennedy coming up
[9:00] and kennedy being murdered and all these
[9:02] things that happened especially to the
[9:03] us
[9:04] like uh uh uh uh like um
[9:07] fidel castro came up in a political
[9:09] world and then you understand when
[9:11] brother brandon makes certain stan
[9:12] statements what happened to this and so
[9:15] we want to encourage them to read it
[9:17] uh and to use it we didn't call it a
[9:19] book it's a companion
[9:21] that means we for those who love the
[9:22] message that means those who doesn't
[9:24] love the mess will not love the book
[9:25] neither
[9:27] but it's for those who are reading
[9:28] message messy books you know
[9:30] and you're to feeling to to feed on it
[9:33] and then there is a little dvd that
[9:35] means we went over there
[9:36] two years ago to arizona and we were
[9:38] filming in hd quality the places where
[9:40] the prophet was
[9:42] with a very gentle help of our noble
[9:44] brother green you know he said we always
[9:46] wanted to do this and here comes some
[9:47] some hillbillies from germany and they
[9:51] but but that's some i mean that's how it
[9:54] is but
[9:54] it i want to say like this it was a it
[9:57] was a
[9:57] friendship project of of of germany of
[10:00] south africa and of of
[10:02] of the states of the united states
[10:04] because our noble brother lonnie was
[10:06] helping a lot in that
[10:07] in that book you know with his kind of
[10:09] proofreading and so forth and
[10:11] we trust is is a blessing because it's
[10:13] not a doctrinal book of trying to defend
[10:15] or anything like this
[10:17] as we said uh we were just speaking in
[10:19] the car today
[10:20] i mean we cannot hinder
[10:23] that every revival brings false twins
[10:27] i mean that's that's that's god's law
[10:28] you know and it's no
[10:30] you know you waste your time in
[10:32] preaching against false doctrines
[10:33] because if one
[10:34] camp is destroyed the next one comes up
[10:38] i mean but but what we want to do is to
[10:41] preach the right dollar
[10:42] right and all the rest becomes clear
[10:45] right and i think that's so important
[10:46] and i believe this message it's pla
[10:48] explains itself so much
[10:51] right and so therefore we we we want to
[10:54] give this
[10:54] and and we uh yeah it is our
[10:56] contribution let me say maybe for our
[10:58] next generation if the lord is carrying
[11:00] we don't believe in
[11:00] being here too much time on this earth
[11:03] but
[11:04] but uh let me say to let the message
[11:06] explain itself
[11:07] right and then uh we sometimes we put
[11:10] certain events
[11:11] in the in in this in in the life of the
[11:13] prophet we bring it back into the bible
[11:16] i mean let me be honest with you uh
[11:19] we all we're all rejoicing that brother
[11:21] brennan went to sabino canyon here's the
[11:23] sword in his hand
[11:24] but where is the need to have a picture
[11:26] with the eagle and a sword in his hand
[11:28] if you don't understand what does it
[11:29] mean for me
[11:31] then it becomes just a cult just uh it's
[11:33] become you know
[11:34] and then you have to find the bible okay
[11:36] now here is joshua entering to the
[11:38] promised land
[11:39] that's what we believe and the first
[11:40] thing that happened is here's a mankind
[11:42] with a sword in his hand
[11:44] right and he says i'm he and he was the
[11:46] the leader of of
[11:47] of of of the princes of of the heavenly
[11:50] host
[11:51] and i mean here comes brother abraham
[11:52] and he has he has that that sword into
[11:54] his hand and it fitted exactly my hands
[11:57] i mean therefore i always said this and
[11:59] i hope you don't take it personally
[12:01] but this message that we believe doesn't
[12:03] come from america
[12:05] it comes from the presence of almighty i
[12:08] mean that's
[12:09] that's true i mean that's what the angel
[12:12] told the prophet i'm sent from the
[12:13] presence of almighty
[12:15] and and so we are very thankful for this
[12:17] and we we understand that it had to be
[12:20] an american preaching yet
[12:21] uh because we understand that the gospel
[12:23] goes from the east to the west and then
[12:26] it goes in that way you know
[12:29] and uh therefore we don't believe too
[12:31] much in an eighth messenger
[12:33] because you know because the the history
[12:35] comes at the end on sunset
[12:38] mountain on the west coast of america so
[12:40] the eighth messenger must live in the
[12:42] sea in the
[12:43] in the pacific ocean we don't believe
[12:45] too much in those things you know
[12:47] maybe we will see a picture you see at
[12:50] home i'm a plumber you know i have a
[12:52] good qualification but i'm
[12:54] i i i i i i i choose to make a simple
[12:58] job to have more time for the lord you
[13:00] know but we're simple people and we
[13:02] believe this message is for simple
[13:03] people
[13:04] you don't have to have a theological
[13:06] background but you have a heart
[13:08] right with god and then the holy spirit
[13:11] brings revelation and it has nothing to
[13:13] do
[13:13] how how high the iq is or how low the iq
[13:17] is
[13:17] sometimes a high iq stands in in in our
[13:20] own way you know
[13:22] exactly right and i think you you found
[13:24] out already that
[13:25] when i'm preaching in english you have
[13:27] to take what i want to say
[13:28] okay don't take i can really say don't
[13:32] take what i said but what i want to say
[13:34] and brother we have certain other things
[13:36] we made some interviews and we are
[13:38] continuing this week and brother louis
[13:40] is helping me and
[13:40] thank you very much for everything
[13:42] brother louise your family pastor dale
[13:44] brother wade for all of you it's a
[13:45] pleasure for me to be here around
[13:48] i always say this the the germans are
[13:50] very nice people but only those who have
[13:51] the holy ghost
[13:54] but i believe it's for the americans the
[13:56] same that
[13:57] that it has to be it has to be that way
[14:00] you know and
[14:01] but i'm i'm very happy thank you thank
[14:03] you very much for this compliment pastor
[14:04] dale
[14:05] and uh it is so that we have to break
[14:08] away from our nation
[14:09] national spirits we have to await break
[14:12] away from our cult
[14:13] you know culture is many times cult you
[14:15] know and culture
[14:17] makes you feel better than others i mean
[14:19] we are sinners safe by grace
[14:21] and the prophet said something very very
[14:23] nice he says if you want to continue
[14:25] with god
[14:26] never let an arrogant spirit come among
[14:28] you
[14:30] therefore i'm not too much uh let me say
[14:32] uh
[14:33] uh we are the super eagles and the great
[14:35] eagles and then we are those speakers
[14:37] but if you are an eagle you don't have
[14:38] to tell that you are an eagle
[14:40] people will feel that you have something
[14:42] you know you don't a real true believer
[14:44] doesn't have to defend to explain
[14:46] himself all the way
[14:47] he is what he is by god's grace you know
[14:50] exactly so and
[14:52] blessed be the name of the lord i really
[14:53] feel well and if you wouldn't mind i go
[14:55] direct in the subject because i made
[14:57] another promise that i will not take
[14:58] more time than your normal
[15:00] local service because i'm i have a lot
[15:02] of disadvantages but i have some
[15:04] advantages too
[15:05] and one of the advantages i know to
[15:07] respect people and know how to respect
[15:09] churches and how they feel and and
[15:11] and therefore even if you say take time
[15:12] i know we have children here i want to
[15:14] tell them
[15:15] i want to be i want to see them tomorrow
[15:16] at school in good condition
[15:18] in good shape uh making good marks you
[15:21] know they don't have any kind of an
[15:22] excuse mama i have a bad mark because
[15:24] the preacher
[15:25] was too long no no i take my time
[15:29] to to to finish exactly when you have
[15:31] your service finished
[15:33] again i for me it's a privilege to be
[15:35] here and brother dale again thank you
[15:37] very much the lord bless you rich i know
[15:39] he has different ministers
[15:40] here and it doesn't make me nervous but
[15:42] it makes me
[15:43] let me say uh it makes me appreciating
[15:46] that
[15:47] privilege that i have for this evening
[15:49] yeah i really really
[15:51] thank you very much for this right
[15:54] bless it be the name of the lord now the
[15:57] the text i was i'm i'm i'm a little bit
[16:00] of a praying type of a man
[16:02] to be honest i take a lot of time to be
[16:04] just uh
[16:06] alone with the lord i'm not a uh uh a
[16:09] complicated person but i find out that
[16:11] you can have a good sermon but it must
[16:13] be
[16:13] inspired by the lord and what i find out
[16:16] too is that sometimes
[16:18] the holy spirit is leaving a hundred
[16:19] people just to speak to one or two
[16:22] and maybe 89 said i mean we heard this
[16:25] already and two said now that was for me
[16:27] you know
[16:27] i mean that's what a shepherd does you
[16:29] know and so he laid something on my
[16:31] heart
[16:32] which a subject that i love a lot
[16:35] because
[16:37] it deals with god remembers
[16:41] and we find out that here is a story
[16:45] in the bible of a shunammite woman and
[16:47] the prophet elijah
[16:50] and i want to make the mixture between
[16:53] elijah and elisha because
[16:57] both both were prophets one was
[17:00] following the other right and those were
[17:03] men
[17:04] at the same time right yeah and the
[17:06] greatness
[17:07] in man in god is that god can understand
[17:10] man because you became man
[17:12] and that kind of uh we know the story of
[17:16] the prophet elij
[17:17] elijah when he went into the wilderness
[17:20] after his great victory on mount carmel
[17:24] i mean killing 400 prophets and then
[17:27] here's jesse bell
[17:28] and bringing out that threat yeah and we
[17:32] understand that when he went
[17:33] into the wilderness brother branham
[17:35] preached two times about this
[17:37] and he says what does thou hear elijah
[17:41] and what does thou hear elijah and we
[17:44] understand that brother branham preached
[17:46] about his
[17:46] own situation at that time because 1959
[17:51] 1960
[17:52] it was the time when he preached a
[17:53] rejected king
[17:55] now the denomination already left him
[17:57] because they wanted to have the gift
[17:59] of the messenger but they didn't want to
[18:01] have the message
[18:03] exactly so and we understand that he was
[18:06] in that situation
[18:08] and he says that elijah went into the
[18:10] wilderness
[18:12] and he left his servant gihasi behind
[18:14] him
[18:15] and here's brother what the prophet said
[18:18] which is gold
[18:19] to understand people because brother
[18:21] brahms says
[18:23] that if persons come in that condition
[18:25] they want to be alone
[18:26] yeah i mean i always say dears if people
[18:30] goes to
[18:31] problems they don't need bible slogans
[18:35] they don't need just a quote they don't
[18:37] need you you only believe on brother no
[18:39] no
[18:40] i mean i always tell this you have
[18:43] you have to have leadership to help a
[18:45] person going
[18:46] through a through a moment of
[18:48] difficulties
[18:50] the great pioneers by the name of arthur
[18:52] rubinstein he was
[18:54] asked the question is it difficult to
[18:56] play piano and archer rubinstein said no
[18:59] it's very simple
[19:00] you just have to press the right buttons
[19:02] at the right time
[19:05] and i mean to have a to correct a person
[19:09] is very simple too you just have to be
[19:12] the right
[19:13] person at the right time at the right sp
[19:16] place in the right spirit saying the
[19:19] right thing and the other one
[19:20] understands it in the right way in his
[19:22] right time
[19:23] it's so simple so if if you want to
[19:26] help a person comfort a person many
[19:29] times
[19:30] no word is the best words instead of
[19:33] just bringing some bible slogans
[19:35] and that prophet elijah said he wanted
[19:38] he wanted to be alone
[19:40] so when he was alone god saw the man
[19:44] yeah and he sends down an angel
[19:49] and i want to say this tie deals to
[19:52] revelation 10 for our day
[19:55] time because that angel had something to
[19:59] eat
[19:59] right and the prophet said and and you
[20:02] see the wisdom of god
[20:04] because brother branham preaches about a
[20:06] sickness
[20:08] that never exists in the 60s but it's
[20:10] existing today what we call the burn
[20:13] out system the burn out the heart attack
[20:16] the man
[20:17] the the sickness for manager completely
[20:19] and and elijah came to that point of a
[20:21] complete
[20:22] burn out it was not even invented that
[20:25] kind of a sickness and the profit speaks
[20:27] about people
[20:28] who are working too much and there are
[20:31] people who are working to less
[20:35] man so we are not believing too much in
[20:37] jobless conditions if you're in that
[20:39] condition
[20:40] i mean don't say it is god-given try to
[20:42] do something
[20:45] exactly so if if you did everything you
[20:48] don't have a job that's another thing
[20:49] but
[20:49] try to do anything with that you can do
[20:52] to serve the lord
[20:53] and and and when god came down i mean he
[20:55] didn't didn't come down just with words
[20:57] just with slogans
[20:58] but he sent an angel and that angel put
[21:02] elijah to sleep and brother blame said
[21:05] that is the problem of people today they
[21:06] are overworked they are stressed
[21:08] he said it's a problem with their nerves
[21:11] nothing with the soul but with the
[21:13] nerves of the people
[21:15] and when he when he was waking up
[21:19] then that angel had something to eat
[21:23] and he says elijah eat because by the
[21:26] strength of that
[21:27] of that of that cookies of these cakes
[21:31] you will you will go for a long way
[21:34] now when he received that that kind of
[21:37] food
[21:38] he was running unto the mountain
[21:42] of the lord the mount horeb for 40 days
[21:45] the prophet said i wanted to know which
[21:47] kind of vitamins
[21:49] were in those cakes and and
[21:52] and take our time i mean this is a dark
[21:55] age
[21:56] this is what the prophet called satan's
[21:58] eden there was
[21:59] never a time so hard to serve the lord
[22:02] than today
[22:04] i hope i can say it behind the pulpit
[22:06] but i i i will use it
[22:08] in nice words this is the complete age
[22:10] of immorality
[22:12] where people have a lot of problems
[22:14] because it's pressing upon people
[22:17] this is the age of of of of of
[22:21] network and i'm i'm i'm i i
[22:24] i see a great danger in those things
[22:27] exactly so and it seems that that you
[22:30] know that demon power is coming down but
[22:33] i want to say
[22:33] jesus is winner because he sent us a
[22:38] message
[22:39] which is not only in formation but it is
[22:42] spiritual
[22:43] food in due seasons amen
[22:46] because that angel had a book in his
[22:48] hand and the bride has to eat that book
[22:51] now tie that to what jesus said if you
[22:54] don't eat my flesh and drink my blood
[22:56] you have no part in me
[22:57] it was never fulfilled in jesus time as
[23:00] jesus of nazareth
[23:01] but we had a prophet who said you're not
[23:04] feasting from me
[23:05] but from the body word of christ
[23:08] i mean therefore this message what we
[23:11] believe is red bull
[23:16] amen can you say amen now now you don't
[23:20] see very much
[23:21] but when i was a boy i was making
[23:23] bodybuilding
[23:24] we were not believers at that time but
[23:26] and therefore we were
[23:28] we didn't know god and so i had two
[23:30] stars in my life
[23:32] one was sylvester stallone and one was
[23:34] arnold schwarzenegger
[23:37] and i i remember i saw that film by the
[23:39] name of conan
[23:41] you know and and and schwarzenegger who
[23:43] is just using his breast muscle he goes
[23:45] like
[23:47] so so so i went there to make some
[23:50] bodybuilding and i went back before the
[23:52] mirror
[23:52] and i looked but there was nothing doing
[23:57] that that's how it went but but so
[24:00] and and i always say the church is
[24:02] everything that you see here
[24:03] was here it just changed its place okay
[24:08] right therefore don't invest too much
[24:10] time in bodybuilding
[24:12] if you're a sister don't invest too much
[24:14] too much money
[24:15] in cosmetics because you are getting
[24:17] older anyhow
[24:20] i mean okay but for the brothers the
[24:24] same
[24:25] i have a nice uh we're not making to
[24:27] correct jokes but i have a nice story
[24:30] that one one a boy saw saw some wedding
[24:32] photos of his of his mama and daddy
[24:35] right and and he says mama uh i mean who
[24:38] is the man on that photo
[24:40] you know a nice nice young man and he
[24:42] says uh she said no that's daddy
[24:44] and he says and who is the fat one with
[24:47] no hair who is living now in our home
[24:55] if not only is jesus we become older but
[24:57] they have good news
[24:59] there is a theory waiting there is a
[25:02] there's a new body waiting
[25:04] therefore don't we always tell our young
[25:06] people don't make too much bodybuilding
[25:08] make
[25:08] soul building by the word of the lord
[25:12] but what i find out i was a young boy
[25:14] and i found out
[25:15] when i'm making was making bodybuilding
[25:17] if you want to have
[25:18] muscles you cannot eat mcdonald's
[25:22] my you need a you need a steak you need
[25:24] something solid to eat
[25:26] and the prophet of god said face has
[25:29] muscles on his breast hair on his breast
[25:32] i'm a face has muscle so if you want to
[25:34] have face
[25:35] muscles you cannot eat facebook
[25:38] you cannot eat harry potter you cannot
[25:41] watch television you have to have a
[25:43] spiritual stake
[25:45] that's the message of the hour something
[25:48] solid to eat you cannot live from
[25:51] facebook and all these things
[25:52] it's it's you it's nothing for your soul
[25:55] right now
[25:57] therefore we understand god understood
[25:59] the situation of that prophet and
[26:02] take this to the prophet elijah
[26:06] now when he came through those cities
[26:11] uh i i i'm sure that he hadn't have a
[26:14] a t-shirt by the name of elisha the
[26:16] prophet
[26:18] he was a man like all the rest of them
[26:20] but while he was walking to that city
[26:24] israel didn't like them at all right
[26:27] israel were they hated those prophets
[26:30] now you have to see one thing that
[26:34] 42 children were killed because of the
[26:37] respectlessness of the parents
[26:40] you see that when elijah came through
[26:43] the children made fun of the prophet
[26:45] elijah
[26:46] and he turned around and cursed them and
[26:48] two bears came
[26:50] now brother branham says it like this
[26:54] he said the children said on the streets
[26:58] what the parents said behind the
[27:00] curtains
[27:01] now be sure that the spirit that you
[27:04] have
[27:04] will fall on your children if you don't
[27:07] like a minister
[27:08] they don't like that minister neither
[27:11] because it's the anointing which
[27:13] governs your home if you speak
[27:16] critically they become
[27:17] critics amen uh we have a slogan in
[27:21] germany and i believe it
[27:22] is it is the same for here it says
[27:26] show me your company and i'll show you
[27:29] who you are
[27:30] right that means if you are in a train
[27:32] with
[27:33] five smokers and you cannot come out of
[27:36] that train and you're not a smoker
[27:38] but when you come out of that train you
[27:40] are smelling like all the rest of the
[27:42] smokers
[27:43] it is the question with whom we have
[27:46] fellowship
[27:47] with whom we have therefore we tell our
[27:49] young people to your if you want to have
[27:51] a friend
[27:52] show search somebody who is closer to
[27:55] the lord than you yourself
[27:58] and it will not work with some facebook
[27:59] friends because you don't know who's on
[28:01] the other line
[28:02] that's for sure but what happened is
[28:04] this
[28:05] i mean i i i was a sunday school teacher
[28:10] and
[28:10] i'm i want to be honest i'm leaning a
[28:12] little bit towards legalism but that's
[28:14] that is fine for you can you say amen
[28:16] i'm a little bit of a conservative type
[28:18] i'm young but i'm very conservative but
[28:21] uh you know we i was in a a
[28:25] sunday school teacher and we had two
[28:27] boys they came in like this
[28:31] and i wondered myself who the parents
[28:33] were and i was in the sanctuary and soon
[28:36] i found out who the parents were because
[28:38] they were too coming in like this
[28:42] the way we come to church they will come
[28:43] to church the way we respect the lord
[28:46] they will respect the lord
[28:48] therefore i always say and i'm happy as
[28:50] a guest minister
[28:51] you can take all the liberty because you
[28:53] don't know really but we always say it's
[28:55] home
[28:56] don't come always too late to church
[28:58] because you're teaching your children a
[28:59] lesson
[29:00] to disrespect god no
[29:03] exactly so you you can you can say it's
[29:06] the traffic but it cannot be the traffic
[29:08] every
[29:08] wednesday and every sunday okay no don't
[29:11] do this
[29:12] i mean the way you they come you come
[29:14] they will come
[29:16] therefore we believe that the parents
[29:18] should be prayed up before they come to
[29:20] church
[29:21] take their children into an atmosphere
[29:24] and really
[29:24] be really ask the lord to speak to their
[29:28] hearts
[29:29] elijah elisha lived in that country and
[29:32] those people they didn't like it and it
[29:34] kept
[29:34] and it costs the life of these children
[29:39] oh wow god help us that we understand we
[29:42] have a responsibility for our youngsters
[29:45] not only in words but by our behavior
[29:48] but our
[29:49] by our ways how we speak how we think
[29:53] i think uh american children are the
[29:55] same as germans because
[29:57] you know uh uh when when
[30:00] when they shouldn't listen to something
[30:02] they they find it out i don't know
[30:03] exactly how they make it
[30:05] but they are playing somewhere but the
[30:07] ear goes
[30:11] and and and you you're telling something
[30:13] critically after three weeks they tell
[30:15] you what you're told right
[30:16] exactly they have they have a they have
[30:19] a a heavily
[30:20] heavenly navigation system or something
[30:22] like a uh
[30:24] how do you call it nba system uh or nsa
[30:27] system right
[30:28] they have it already included by birth
[30:31] they
[30:32] listen to all things that they shouldn't
[30:33] listen to so therefore the prophet said
[30:36] even our our our thoughts should be
[30:39] sanctified before the lord
[30:42] right i mean now it caused the
[30:46] the the life of these children but we
[30:47] will find out some example of people who
[30:50] saved their household by vision
[30:53] because that woman i mean she saw that
[30:57] prophet elijah or elijah when he passed
[31:00] by
[31:01] she was just standing there and she says
[31:03] i find out that this is a holy man
[31:05] now who told her i tell you the same god
[31:09] who told hetty right to do
[31:13] the same one because jesus christ the
[31:15] same yesterday today and forever
[31:18] now let me say this as a key sentence it
[31:21] is no
[31:23] no matter how wrong you are in your
[31:25] doctrine
[31:26] i don't say i don't want to say you
[31:28] should be no no no no no but the holy
[31:30] spirit brings you on the track again
[31:32] no matter how deep you are in the
[31:33] message you are not deep in the message
[31:36] but if you can respect god there is a
[31:40] blessing
[31:40] on its way already for that other use
[31:43] absolutely so
[31:45] god it will pay off respect for god
[31:48] because that woman she had a vision that
[31:51] this man is a man of god
[31:53] and she said to her husband she said we
[31:55] are preparing a room
[31:57] for this man and whenever he comes by we
[32:00] make like
[32:01] life a little bit easier so that he may
[32:03] sit down
[32:07] we know that especially that church
[32:09] knows about that question that was asked
[32:11] to brother branham
[32:13] what is the reward of a prophet right in
[32:15] 1964 and i learned just before the
[32:18] service that
[32:18] that it was the mother of our most noble
[32:21] brother joseph
[32:22] who asked that question you know i
[32:24] didn't know before but the lord laid
[32:25] that
[32:26] subject on my heart brother brandon what
[32:28] is the reward of a prophet and brother
[32:30] branham said
[32:31] it it is to be a friend of a prophet
[32:33] remember the shunammite woman
[32:35] and i want to be honest i never
[32:36] understood it but today i understand
[32:38] because year by year passed by and the
[32:41] prophet
[32:42] and his servant went into that home
[32:44] right
[32:45] and you know she didn't say
[32:49] uh well i'm coming to church
[32:52] all these years and i'm i'm uh paying my
[32:55] tithing so i want to have some benefit
[32:59] it was not hurt talented thing for her
[33:02] it was
[33:03] normal to serve the lord
[33:06] aliyah it was not gehasi telling now we
[33:10] have to
[33:10] make a little social program uh let's
[33:13] collect some money for that woman
[33:15] because she was a knight no no
[33:16] but it was god speaking to his prophets
[33:20] i mean when brother brain speaks about
[33:22] that woman inviting the prophet elijah
[33:25] in the message be certain of god
[33:27] he said it was not her bidding and it
[33:29] was god's bidding
[33:31] it was not him going it was god coming
[33:33] into that home
[33:35] in form of a man so that woman she said
[33:38] no i have
[33:38] everything and then we find out that she
[33:41] doesn't have a boy
[33:44] and the prophet says says to her
[33:48] say whatever it is in your heart and the
[33:51] lord will grant it
[33:53] exactly so whatever you want to have on
[33:55] your husband said she doesn't have a boy
[33:57] and we know
[33:58] that uh the children at that time were
[34:00] life insurance for the family
[34:03] right right so god
[34:07] in his greatness is honoring
[34:11] a woman who knows to honor god
[34:15] and brother brahman said you can do
[34:17] nothing for god
[34:19] unless that he pays it back for you
[34:22] blessed be the name of the lord i mean
[34:24] that is a message that always
[34:26] stirs my heart because i want to say
[34:29] it matters to serve the lord
[34:32] it matters to pray it matters to pay
[34:35] tithings
[34:36] all those people who don't pay their
[34:39] tithing it's not because they
[34:41] they they are too starchy to do it
[34:44] but they have a lack of revelation what
[34:46] is behind
[34:48] because there's a blessing going with
[34:50] that kind of an
[34:52] act i mean therefore we even believe
[34:55] now uh in that way i'm speaking to the
[34:57] wrong audience
[34:59] don't stay on sunday morning home
[35:02] put your feet on the desk and watch a
[35:05] service via internet
[35:07] if there is no church that's another
[35:09] thing and then you are just having your
[35:11] cup of coffee put your shoes on the desk
[35:14] and say amen brother preaching and
[35:16] you have honey you have another coffee
[35:18] for me
[35:19] brother brandon says we have to make a
[35:21] sacrifice
[35:23] in order to be blessed exactly so
[35:27] hallelujah somebody said brother marcus
[35:29] i'm just only listening to the best
[35:31] minister that is brother branham i said
[35:32] i make it the same way and
[35:34] there's no other message that i listen
[35:36] but at least monday tuesday
[35:37] thursday friday saturday the rest i go
[35:39] to church
[35:41] there's no contradiction at all right
[35:44] now
[35:44] when that happened we are finding out
[35:49] that time means nothing for god
[35:52] you see here is a man by the name of of
[35:57] abraham
[35:59] and abraham giving tithings to
[36:01] melchizedek
[36:03] and god remember it four generations
[36:06] later
[36:07] and make contribution up to up to levy
[36:13] i'm we're simple people man we
[36:17] we don't have nothing to
[36:21] to inherit or to give to our children
[36:24] now i'm a german without a mercedes-benz
[36:26] and that that that means something
[36:28] that means something so i'm not really a
[36:30] german but we're choosing that way
[36:33] whenever when we have
[36:34] money left we give it to the mission
[36:35] because we we say we're we
[36:37] i i have a castle anyhow
[36:40] it's already paid it's there it's just
[36:42] waiting i'm just
[36:43] having some years here on this earth
[36:46] we have a strategy in our family because
[36:49] i'm a full working person
[36:50] we say one week for the family and fight
[36:52] for the law because we have six weeks in
[36:54] in germany
[36:55] right you say brother marcus if you
[36:58] don't have a car and you don't
[37:00] you can have a car nothing or a house
[37:02] whatever
[37:03] uh you can have whatever you want but
[37:05] but let me say this
[37:07] do you can you inherit something to your
[37:09] daughter
[37:11] i said yes blessings
[37:15] brother branham came to a young man
[37:17] which came later
[37:18] brother makonda who was a pastor over
[37:21] there in tucson
[37:22] and brother lonnie always told us that
[37:24] story that brother brennan went to the
[37:26] young man
[37:27] and he says he was a businessman at that
[37:29] time he said your business
[37:30] is doing fine and all is well and and
[37:33] the young brother said yes brother
[37:36] i mean everything is going fine i don't
[37:38] know exactly and then i'm
[37:40] such a success and so forth and then
[37:41] brother bryan says something which is
[37:43] gold for us
[37:44] as parents he took him by the hand he
[37:46] says
[37:47] god blesses you because you have parents
[37:50] who loyal serve the lords
[37:55] if you want to inherit something to your
[37:57] children inherit blessings
[38:00] from parents who serve the lord
[38:04] i mean let me say you have a feeling for
[38:07] an older person in the church
[38:09] and you are visiting him maybe he is a
[38:11] handicapped one
[38:13] maybe he is old maybe he needs help and
[38:16] you are just there to help that person
[38:18] and god in heaven says to his angels i
[38:21] see what brother so-and-so does
[38:23] how can we help them and maybe god can
[38:26] say i will make that his children all
[38:28] their life will never be sick
[38:30] right because we have a king who is
[38:32] almighty
[38:34] hallelujah therefore elohim said to
[38:36] sarah
[38:37] is there anything to heart for the lord
[38:42] amen touching the heart of the lord not
[38:44] only god give give
[38:46] but doing something to please him and
[38:48] god will reward it anyhow
[38:51] amen can you say amen
[38:54] i want to say this it matters to serve
[38:57] the lord
[38:58] amen it matters to because you're
[39:02] reaping in your life you you have a
[39:04] feeling for others
[39:05] you're praying for others you give a
[39:06] phone call something
[39:08] to encourage and you are depressed
[39:10] yourself and god
[39:11] will wake somebody up to him to
[39:14] encourage you
[39:16] because you reap what you thought a real
[39:19] christian is not an egoistical person
[39:22] because he understands the blessing of
[39:24] my brother is my blessing
[39:27] he understands that there is a body work
[39:29] which is going on
[39:31] and then this and i want to tell it to
[39:34] the older people among us mostly people
[39:36] say brother mark is a youth preacher i
[39:38] mostly invite for youth game but
[39:39] let me speak about the use over 80
[39:43] because your inner man is young anyhow
[39:46] we'll never become old right
[39:49] amen god remembers
[39:54] when we came to the message i mean i was
[39:56] around 20 we were
[39:58] we were we were we were unbelievers
[40:00] before
[40:01] i mean we were full of zeal
[40:04] that's true we were full of dynamics
[40:09] and we were full of naivety
[40:14] i mean whole germany comes to the
[40:18] message of the
[40:18] hour by marcus becker
[40:22] i mean and then god comes to form our
[40:25] character
[40:26] and then he goes
[40:30] and then i mean here comes the eagle
[40:36] i mean and after all these years in the
[40:38] message today we are just praying lord
[40:40] keep me
[40:41] faithful on the way
[40:44] is that true but remember you as older
[40:47] persons
[40:49] the prayers that you prayed 40 years ago
[40:54] we forgot what we prayed right
[40:57] but god did never forget
[41:01] god did not forget what you said when
[41:02] you were 40 years younger 50 years
[41:04] god for him it's present i i love i love
[41:08] that little
[41:09] illustration that brother billy paul
[41:11] made he said brother branham was there
[41:14] and here comes that little young girl
[41:16] with his shoes and she was a handicapped
[41:18] person
[41:20] and the prophet said now why do you have
[41:23] the new shoes and the young girl says
[41:25] brother bryan because when you pray for
[41:27] me i believe i'm gonna be healed
[41:29] amen and the prophet said why don't you
[41:31] sit down over there
[41:32] and so that your little faith is raising
[41:35] up a little bit
[41:36] i mean therefore we come to church right
[41:38] right amen
[41:40] preaching is not to the intellect
[41:41] preaching is to out to the inner man
[41:46] exactly is not right so
[41:49] brother brain was continuing i think two
[41:52] or three
[41:53] hours later behind the prophet was
[41:56] sitting his own brother by the name of
[41:57] donny
[41:59] and donnie was sitting behind brother
[42:00] branham and he was watching that girl
[42:03] and he thinks by himself man can you
[42:06] imagine this
[42:07] my father my brother forgot completely
[42:10] that little girl
[42:11] maybe he doesn't have faith and he wants
[42:13] to finish the service and then we are
[42:15] all dismissed and we all forget about
[42:17] that young girl
[42:19] and in that moment brother branham turns
[42:20] around he says
[42:22] no no no donny i didn't forget her
[42:27] and then he said something which is even
[42:29] greater donnie jesus didn't forget her
[42:31] neither
[42:34] i mean when we have prayed by faith
[42:38] god remembers we forget
[42:41] our own prayers but god remembers them
[42:44] he brings them up in his time hallelujah
[42:47] therefore it says
[42:48] in his time not your time not my time
[42:51] in his time he does great things
[42:55] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[42:59] therefore i always say this
[43:03] if you're you if you're new in the
[43:04] message or if you're young in the
[43:06] message
[43:06] i mean there is days when you feel saved
[43:11] and there is days where you feel very
[43:13] much saved
[43:14] and there is days where you feel the
[43:16] bride you make it you the rapture
[43:18] and then there is days you feel nothing
[43:20] right
[43:21] you you think did i make a start right
[43:26] but god is not looking about upon
[43:29] our present condition god looks on the
[43:32] inner man
[43:35] not our form our physical daily form
[43:38] god looks in eternity from eternity to
[43:41] eternity
[43:42] can you say amen therefore never put
[43:44] your christian faith on your
[43:46] feelings because your feelings will
[43:48] always deceive you
[43:50] stand on the word here i am
[43:54] therefore i always say this you must
[43:56] find your name in the bible i mean there
[43:58] is no marcus becker in the bible
[44:00] although the bible says take marcus with
[44:02] you he will be he will be
[44:04] useful for the ministry
[44:08] but i found my name
[44:12] because it says behold i will send you
[44:15] the prophet elijah and my bible says i
[44:18] sent
[44:19] marcus becker on all those who love this
[44:21] message the prophet elijah
[44:23] they are from myself blessed be the name
[44:26] of the lord
[44:28] god remembers amen right
[44:31] may it be a bomb
[44:35] mean to somebody to understand
[44:39] god knows where i am god knows who i am
[44:43] and god remembers me i always love that
[44:47] illustration you know
[44:49] about our god why we are bragging upon
[44:53] upon our lord jesus christ one day
[44:56] a young boy came to a shop to to buy
[45:00] some some some some some dogs
[45:04] and the the owner of the dogs came down
[45:06] and the boy said i want to have that dog
[45:08] and the owner said
[45:10] i mean that dog is handicapped i mean
[45:13] why don't you take another one this one
[45:14] cannot really run
[45:16] he doesn't have the value like the
[45:17] others why don't you take a a strong one
[45:20] and the boy was was putting off his his
[45:23] throws
[45:24] and from his knee down he had an
[45:26] artificial leg
[45:28] and he says i want to have this dog
[45:30] because if i'm going out with him
[45:32] he understands me and i understand
[45:36] and brother blame says this god became
[45:38] teenager
[45:40] so that he will understand the teenagers
[45:43] god became human so when you're praying
[45:45] about anything he knows what you talk
[45:48] about
[45:50] blessed be the name of the lord god
[45:52] became men
[45:53] to understand mankind and
[45:57] and that you don't have to tell stories
[45:58] oh lord you can't say lord here i
[46:00] am my my power is at the end
[46:04] but i'm counting on your energy
[46:10] i mean we cannot and we cannot see
[46:14] this message in a pentecostal
[46:18] vision i mean
[46:23] here's the prophet of god he received
[46:25] the holy ghost in the age of 20
[46:27] 21 and two times after he received the
[46:30] holy ghost he wanted to take his life
[46:33] explain this to a pentecostal i mean the
[46:36] holy ghost is
[46:37] joy it's it's it's yeah that's the holy
[46:40] ghost is
[46:41] is is many more things it's farming it's
[46:44] pressing it's it's wringling out our old
[46:47] nature
[46:49] that's how he goes to character
[46:52] farming time therefore we are not
[46:55] charismatic
[46:57] every day with jesus is better than the
[47:00] day
[47:01] is this your life it's not my life
[47:04] you say but who is happy my inside man
[47:06] he is happy all the days
[47:09] but we are going to distress to
[47:12] tensions to problems and then the
[47:14] sovereign hands of the lord comes and
[47:16] gives us
[47:17] deliverance hallelujah blessed be the
[47:20] name of the lord therefore we will make
[47:22] it
[47:22] not because of ourselves because of a
[47:24] mighty father who is taking care of us
[47:28] hallelujah i will just show you some
[47:30] examples and
[47:31] the technician helped me because i'm
[47:32] technically i'm just a hillbilly
[47:40] i mean just some example will you help
[47:42] me brother jose right
[47:44] now this is the picture i will not go
[47:47] through the text of because i will keep
[47:48] my time
[47:49] uh because brother blame said that man
[47:51] is as good as his word and that we will
[47:52] do like this but
[47:53] let it be little lessons which are not
[47:57] deep but at the same time very deep
[47:59] because we want to see people blessed
[48:02] and blessing is not
[48:03] always a question of doctrine blessing
[48:05] is a question of attitude
[48:07] amen you can be that you can be sitting
[48:10] among
[48:11] in branham tabernacle in the in the
[48:13] ministry of brother branham
[48:15] yourself or in the 60s but if your
[48:17] attitude is not right you will never get
[48:19] the full benefit
[48:20] of everything amen now this is this
[48:23] is this is congressman up show and you
[48:25] understand
[48:27] um he was he was crippled i think over
[48:30] 60 years
[48:33] before brother branham was preaching the
[48:35] holy ghost
[48:37] declared him to be healed
[48:40] nobody preached no altar call no line
[48:44] no no but the holy ghost said this in my
[48:47] words
[48:48] now his time is there right
[48:51] yeah all these 60 years
[48:54] god was just saying i have a date for
[48:57] him
[48:59] you could pull r you could pull put put
[49:01] oil on him
[49:03] you could invite ministers like you want
[49:05] to lay hands
[49:06] god has his time for everything
[49:10] and god is not nervous at all because
[49:13] god sees the end for the beginning
[49:16] you cannot push gods
[49:19] no you cannot stress god that is what
[49:22] the great evangel is trying to do in the
[49:24] kick around the bull god you have to do
[49:26] you promise god promised to heal but he
[49:29] has his time
[49:31] nobody tells god what to do and want to
[49:34] do
[49:34] glory can you say amen and he was his
[49:38] time was there and the holy spirit just
[49:40] said it's now time and brother bram said
[49:42] brought congressman absol is declared to
[49:44] be free
[49:45] to be healed next one please
[49:48] hallelujah right now this is this
[49:52] is this is a picture that we all know
[49:53] this is brother donnie wurtz
[49:57] right he is uh he is he we met him years
[50:00] ago he came with brother green
[50:02] this is brother branham and this is
[50:04] brother donnie with brother branham i
[50:05] always say my little brother donny
[50:07] i mean he was taller than brother green
[50:10] but look at this
[50:11] he said brother branham but because he
[50:13] had the cancer on his ear
[50:15] what's the matter donovan that ear he
[50:16] said brother banish
[50:18] it has been there for a long time i
[50:19] don't know i caught him by the hand
[50:22] there it was a big cancer on his ear
[50:24] never said one word just held it it was
[50:27] off my brother
[50:28] in a day or two after there wasn't even
[50:31] a scar left of it
[50:32] it was his respect to the god of heaven
[50:35] by the quickening power
[50:37] killed the cancer and spared the life of
[50:39] donovan vert back there amen
[50:41] exactly brother brahm did not say he was
[50:44] very deep in the dark we believe i'm i'm
[50:46] i like to teach a little bit but not
[50:48] this evening we don't say
[50:49] doctrine it's very important the opening
[50:51] of the word but i want to
[50:53] here god speaks about blessings by
[50:56] attitudes
[50:58] you are never you no matter
[51:01] no matter where somebody stands in the
[51:04] message
[51:05] or outside of the message you never make
[51:07] a mistake in respecting people
[51:10] you say denominational yeah we believe
[51:13] denomination they have there we know
[51:15] what the prophet said
[51:16] but when you are speaking face to face
[51:18] somebody you wish in god's blessings
[51:21] because because you are not the judge
[51:23] about this person he stands alone
[51:25] before god one day yeah all those who
[51:27] doesn't believe the message like us
[51:29] i mean we are the only eagles and all
[51:31] these chicken and the message now you
[51:33] are it's not our turn to say who is
[51:35] eagle who's chicken
[51:36] but make sure your life with god
[51:41] if nobody becomes judges and arrogant
[51:43] and you know
[51:44] no no no it is his attitude tell it to
[51:47] your children
[51:48] tell them tell them no matter what it is
[51:50] but we respect the lords
[51:54] respect for elders respect for ministers
[51:58] you're blessed already amen you have
[52:00] that attitude already your
[52:02] family is already blessed you can
[52:04] nothing to do against it
[52:05] because god loves respect god is not
[52:09] impressed by singing
[52:10] right right god is not but you know some
[52:12] some jingly swag got some
[52:14] jesus
[52:18] they call it the golden voice but i
[52:20] prefer a golden
[52:21] heart a silver voice or let me say a
[52:25] german voice but a golden heart
[52:28] you say oh my singing god was so
[52:30] impressed all the angels know how to
[52:32] sing
[52:33] i mean do you think god is impressed by
[52:35] our singing when all the hosts of heaven
[52:38] amen when they start to sing the pillars
[52:41] will start to
[52:42] will start to move but god in this
[52:45] arrogant age of loud is he a god is
[52:47] impressed by
[52:48] somebody who can show respect
[52:51] exactly so that is it was impressing god
[52:54] right now that woman
[52:57] sarah she is i think she is
[53:01] married to the pastor in the brandon
[53:02] tabernacle today sister sarah she's in
[53:04] the generation book
[53:06] now look at that look at that story
[53:10] and and and may this be again gold no
[53:13] matter
[53:14] where you're standing if you're old or
[53:15] young you're new in the message
[53:17] you're advancing the message but they
[53:20] had a photo that that they should
[53:22] do
[53:22] at the end of their uh let me see at the
[53:25] end of the school
[53:26] and on that photo a day everybody had
[53:29] had addressed a school uniform which is
[53:31] very very short
[53:33] now she refused to be on that photo and
[53:36] she got problems with her teacher and so
[53:38] forth because it was
[53:39] the final photo of the class she refused
[53:41] because it was too
[53:42] lucy for her to to wide open
[53:47] a couple of weeks later she was winning
[53:49] a sewing
[53:50] contest suing contest amen although
[53:54] that she was not very gifted a couple of
[53:57] weeks later brother branham
[53:58] phoned to that family and he was
[54:01] speaking to her father
[54:03] and then he says this can you give me uh
[54:06] rebecca i think rebecca's her name can
[54:08] you give me becky
[54:10] yes and he says and brother blame said
[54:11] this becky i heard
[54:14] that you were winning that number three
[54:17] in the suiting contest
[54:18] i think far far far far for the whole
[54:21] state of
[54:23] of indiana or kentucky and she said yes
[54:27] brother branham it was just uh
[54:28] uh was just great and then brother blame
[54:31] says this
[54:32] becky god gave you that victory
[54:35] because he saw your attitude when they
[54:39] made the photo
[54:41] amen exactly exactly
[54:45] i mean you you say brother marcus hair
[54:48] and clothing has nothing to do with
[54:50] salvation that's one thing
[54:52] but it's it shows my respect for god
[54:56] god will honor it it shows it
[54:59] blessed be the name of the lord little
[55:01] things that you can do
[55:03] just to honor hallelujah blessed be
[55:07] little little little things amen
[55:11] amen amen i could give a lot of example
[55:13] but we are going
[55:14] god remembers next one please right
[55:18] here is here is our robots
[55:22] here is the entrance to our roberts
[55:24] university
[55:26] i mean i mean look at this
[55:29] when brother branham came on the scene
[55:31] he was like david
[55:33] because nobody had feared goliath and
[55:36] nobody could
[55:37] uh win against goliath but here comes a
[55:39] little man with a little slingshot
[55:41] but with a commission from god and you
[55:44] see the bible when when
[55:45] david killed goliath the bible says all
[55:48] israel
[55:50] ran after after the philistines when the
[55:53] ministry of brother branham came up
[55:55] a lot of people saw it and made exactly
[55:58] the same thing
[55:59] right a allen
[56:02] tommy osborne tommy osborne was sitting
[56:05] in his meeting of brother branham and he
[56:06] said and the voice said
[56:07] you can do the same thing all these
[56:11] ministries come out of the ministry of
[56:12] brother branham
[56:15] but the problem is only this that loud
[56:18] this here has only one voice
[56:21] that's right exactly exactly they all
[56:23] have the sign
[56:24] but behind their signs is no voice
[56:26] because it says
[56:27] in the days of the voice singular
[56:30] and we as the fightful ministry we don't
[56:32] bring our own message
[56:34] but we are bringing to the people what
[56:36] was preached before already
[56:39] i mean because the bride has to prophesy
[56:41] again
[56:42] that means it was already prophesied we
[56:45] can
[56:45] update it a little bit but but we don't
[56:48] have a message of our own
[56:50] i'm not interested that my tapes go
[56:52] around i'm i'm i'm
[56:54] he said brother marcus why don't you why
[56:56] don't you speak so
[56:57] so little about your ministry and so big
[56:59] about brother branham's ministry because
[57:00] brother branham he
[57:02] he's already uh he passed over nearby
[57:06] i mean to be honest which minister today
[57:10] can say that the pillar of fire came
[57:12] already in the room when he was born
[57:13] right
[57:14] who can say this when i came to the
[57:18] message i wanted to ask my mother
[57:20] i mean
[57:23] when i was born did you see nothing
[57:27] no no no no the man
[57:30] therefore the bible doesn't say in the
[57:32] days of the man of the seventh century
[57:35] but in the voice and and god said martin
[57:38] luther
[57:39] and invented the press the printing
[57:40] press and god sent the seventh angel
[57:43] and we have all the tapes god god
[57:46] allowed it so that the voice is still
[57:48] living
[57:49] blessed peter but here is you understand
[57:53] what spiritual warfare is and we are
[57:56] under it and don't tell me brother
[57:57] marcus we don't tell what you're
[57:58] speaking this evening i
[57:59] know i'm because i know who where i'm
[58:02] going through
[58:02] because here is the prophet of god i
[58:06] mean
[58:06] he takes a whole audience under his
[58:09] control
[58:11] and here satan comes with thought
[58:13] because brother brain passed exactly by
[58:15] this this is the entrance
[58:16] of our robert university and he goes by
[58:19] this
[58:20] and satan says yeah you see
[58:24] look our roberts looked at university
[58:26] and you have just one typewriter
[58:29] and brother branham follows the thoughts
[58:32] which come from satan
[58:34] sometimes we follow these things too we
[58:36] have to
[58:37] exactly right huh and then brother
[58:40] builds up a complex and he says and look
[58:42] how how about satan what a liar he is
[58:46] because he said to brother yeah maybe
[58:47] god couldn't trust your money
[58:50] that's that that's exactly i mean here
[58:51] is a man who takes every spirit under
[58:54] his control right
[58:55] and satan come here maybe god couldn't
[58:56] trust you and brother ben believes that
[58:58] lie
[58:59] he says yes it may be so that god and he
[59:02] becomes a little bit depressed
[59:04] and then a voice come he says look up
[59:07] and he looks i am your portion
[59:10] blessing is not money blessing is not
[59:13] people blessing is eternally is heavenly
[59:19] we are not charismatic who believe oh
[59:21] god gave me got me
[59:22] a cadillac and you can you can have
[59:25] nothing on this world and be the most
[59:27] blessed person
[59:34] no here's the man i mean again
[59:38] the seals are open this is may 1963
[59:41] the seals are open and brother brahma
[59:43] gets the complex
[59:45] preachers standing in the gap he said
[59:47] i'll build up a complex
[59:50] and look and look
[59:54] let me say like this
[59:58] don't expect unbelievers
[1:00:01] to understand you
[1:00:04] don't if you go to school even home
[1:00:08] school but
[1:00:08] if you go to university don't expect
[1:00:10] that everybody taps on your shoulder
[1:00:13] they they cannot do this right you have
[1:00:15] to bear a reproach
[1:00:17] for the message in germany we don't have
[1:00:20] homeschooling they have to go
[1:00:22] and you have to go to the hall of
[1:00:23] critics every day with the long skirt
[1:00:25] they have to go
[1:00:26] exactly so sometimes you cannot even
[1:00:30] trust yourself
[1:00:31] right your own thoughts because here's
[1:00:35] the menu seals are open
[1:00:36] and he said many people told me that i
[1:00:39] was not qualified for the job
[1:00:44] i mean i'm happy that god is not a great
[1:00:48] democrat
[1:00:51] god ordains god doesn't ask god ordains
[1:00:55] amen i mean if god would have asked loud
[1:00:57] he's here
[1:00:58] uh my our friend from lao this year
[1:01:02] who do you want to have as a messenger i
[1:01:05] mean loud is he would have voted benny
[1:01:06] hinn
[1:01:07] oh jimmy swaggart because somebody who
[1:01:10] is mixing everything a little bit rock
[1:01:12] music a little bit you
[1:01:13] stay how you are but jesus loves you but
[1:01:15] and then he sends
[1:01:16] a man a small man yeah
[1:01:19] i mean to show a world
[1:01:24] that his my his might is is might in
[1:01:27] in in in us as small persons
[1:01:30] but he came to that point depressed
[1:01:36] discouraged
[1:01:39] now we always make a joke now i know
[1:01:41] that you are everybody's up
[1:01:44] but you have a joke i mean even even let
[1:01:46] me say
[1:01:48] we have some people in the church that
[1:01:50] are working outside as farmers that's
[1:01:52] another thing
[1:01:53] but let me speak to normal people it's
[1:01:55] so
[1:01:56] respectless to start snoring in the
[1:01:59] church
[1:02:02] if if if you want to
[1:02:07] if you really want to hurt a minister
[1:02:10] you come in with your pillow
[1:02:14] we see it sometimes in german you know
[1:02:19] and i'm a translator and then i'm
[1:02:21] standing at the outside door
[1:02:23] and people then come oh brother it
[1:02:26] was a blessing and then i thought by
[1:02:29] myself what was the did you dream of a
[1:02:30] mercedes benz or what was the blessing
[1:02:33] you see
[1:02:34] i mean can you say amen
[1:02:37] amen i always tell our young people have
[1:02:40] you ever seen a minister
[1:02:42] going to the toilet why why why while
[1:02:44] there he's preaching
[1:02:47] so don't go every i just speak to the
[1:02:49] young elder one sometimes i have their
[1:02:50] problem that is always
[1:02:51] with no pro but but we had some time a
[1:02:55] boy you know he
[1:02:56] every every so he went to this he went
[1:02:57] to the toilet you know and
[1:02:59] one thing is sure if somebody goes to
[1:03:03] the toilet el
[1:03:04] all the heads is following that person
[1:03:06] to understand now there must be a seal
[1:03:08] revealed behind that door what is what
[1:03:10] is but
[1:03:12] i believe there is no much mystery still
[1:03:14] left you know everything is revealed
[1:03:16] anyhow but you can distract the people
[1:03:20] right you're building up a service and
[1:03:23] it comes to a certain highlight
[1:03:24] and then and you see how and when it
[1:03:27] comes to the highlight
[1:03:28] then
[1:03:35] all these little things okay satan says
[1:03:38] okay
[1:03:38] next time at uh let me say on sunday at
[1:03:41] 12
[1:03:42] 30 i'm phoning again they're not for
[1:03:45] sure
[1:03:45] because we are we don't have to deal
[1:03:47] with flesh and blood but it's it's
[1:03:49] spiritual powers
[1:03:51] they say amen so these people
[1:03:54] had power on the prophet that he got
[1:03:57] discouraged therefore in one certain
[1:04:00] things let me say this
[1:04:02] don't let the opinion of people be your
[1:04:04] own opinion
[1:04:06] sometimes you go ways that nobody
[1:04:08] understands and be honest
[1:04:10] sometimes you don't understand yourself
[1:04:12] but it has to be in the world don't
[1:04:14] become odd
[1:04:15] right don't say the law told me to be
[1:04:17] divorced and marry somebody who's 30
[1:04:19] years younger
[1:04:19] and i didn't want but you know i must be
[1:04:22] obeying
[1:04:23] being and so no no no it must be in the
[1:04:25] word okay
[1:04:27] but then you have to go your way and
[1:04:28] then it's like this
[1:04:30] then the voice says to brother brahm now
[1:04:32] that's your life
[1:04:33] right and i will show you one point
[1:04:35] which makes things
[1:04:36] so simple that's your life seven peaks
[1:04:41] three pulls in between of the seven
[1:04:43] peaks right right
[1:04:44] now that makes it like this that's what
[1:04:46] the voice said to brother branham
[1:04:48] that's your life
[1:04:52] and that's your life
[1:04:56] and that's marcus becker life
[1:05:00] that's our life therefore i always say
[1:05:03] this
[1:05:05] if you are on the peak
[1:05:08] don't become arrogant don't say
[1:05:12] i don't know why this family has this
[1:05:15] promise it seems to be
[1:05:16] real and they were reaping what they
[1:05:18] were saying
[1:05:20] because don't forget the next valley is
[1:05:23] waiting for you
[1:05:25] but if you are down in the valley don't
[1:05:27] give up
[1:05:28] don't give up because god says
[1:05:31] the next mountain is waiting already
[1:05:35] that's your life after the seventh speak
[1:05:41] the prophet said that was the third pull
[1:05:43] right
[1:05:44] was eternity
[1:05:48] no one man minister comes
[1:05:51] behind the message of the prophet
[1:05:56] exactly it cannot be because that you
[1:05:58] say brother marcus how can you because
[1:06:00] after that seventh peak
[1:06:01] there was no more peak right so simple
[1:06:05] that we all understand because
[1:06:06] every doctrine which is in the messy
[1:06:08] which came after brother branham
[1:06:11] is building a camp upon a person right
[1:06:14] exactly until you came to come to that
[1:06:16] point that you have to listen to their
[1:06:18] tape and brother brandon was his
[1:06:19] forerunner
[1:06:21] exactly right so if if i would come one
[1:06:23] day here
[1:06:24] say brother friends i
[1:06:28] am humble but god spoke yesterday to me
[1:06:32] that brother branham did not tell
[1:06:34] everything
[1:06:36] and there is certain things like the
[1:06:38] seven thunders they have to be revealed
[1:06:41] and i will preach them to you yeah
[1:06:44] and if you want to be in the bride you
[1:06:46] have to all be connected
[1:06:48] to my home address so to have a further
[1:06:51] revelation of what brother branham
[1:06:53] couldn't preach
[1:06:55] so i hope that you are spiritual and
[1:06:57] mature enough to
[1:06:59] to take me yeah put your arms around me
[1:07:02] amen say brother marcus we love you we
[1:07:05] will always love you
[1:07:07] but go home come here come in
[1:07:10] go home things
[1:07:14] things that we see partly in this
[1:07:17] message coming up
[1:07:18] is demonic it's demonic don't play
[1:07:22] around with it
[1:07:23] because when the messenger left the
[1:07:26] scene
[1:07:27] he self took over yeah therefore we
[1:07:30] believe in revelation 10 that
[1:07:32] christ coming down now
[1:07:36] i mean i i had on my mind to speak about
[1:07:38] the different phases of the minister
[1:07:39] about the brain but just let me give me
[1:07:40] one clue
[1:07:42] the last the last ministry
[1:07:46] that was revealed to the prophet was the
[1:07:48] eliezer ministry and the message ashamed
[1:07:51] he said i opened my bible lord showed me
[1:07:53] one of the ministry he was the seventh
[1:07:55] and he was the angel to laodicea he had
[1:07:57] the moses man he had the joshua
[1:07:58] or he was the prophet elijah all this
[1:08:00] but they said show me a ministry that
[1:08:02] was
[1:08:02] elijah that was the the the ministry of
[1:08:06] of eliezer end of 1965.
[1:08:09] now if you see the bible when eliezer
[1:08:12] comes and he takes the bride
[1:08:15] and the bride sees isaac
[1:08:18] you see the bride falls in love with
[1:08:21] isaac
[1:08:22] and so the ministry of eliezer the best
[1:08:25] man is just
[1:08:26] going back so there where therefore we
[1:08:29] are very thankful that brother branham
[1:08:31] is not living anymore
[1:08:32] amen because if not there would be no
[1:08:34] church here
[1:08:35] we would be all connected to
[1:08:37] jeffersonville nobody would preach
[1:08:38] nobody would do anything because of
[1:08:40] so god says we had that ministry but i
[1:08:43] want the other sons to come
[1:08:45] in rightness immaturity amen
[1:08:49] but look at this how people can be
[1:08:51] good-hearted
[1:08:52] fine people but have the wrong vision
[1:08:55] right i mean
[1:08:56] because some of the people because that
[1:08:59] isaac for us it's the word
[1:09:00] brother brandon calls it the entire holy
[1:09:03] ghost we can call it a capstone we can
[1:09:04] there's a lot of things that we can call
[1:09:06] it
[1:09:06] but there's too much people they are not
[1:09:08] marrying the world
[1:09:10] but they want to marry eliezer
[1:09:14] can you say man i'm in there one day
[1:09:16] fall in love with eliezer but elijah
[1:09:18] said now that is your husband
[1:09:20] not me they want brother brent speak up
[1:09:22] all the good times when the prophet was
[1:09:24] there
[1:09:24] i want to say there there's a greater
[1:09:27] than solomon is here
[1:09:28] today
[1:09:31] therefore he will not come back because
[1:09:34] his eliezer ministry is over
[1:09:36] he will not come back right because he
[1:09:38] is here
[1:09:39] and we think it's certainly different
[1:09:41] than denominations and not going into
[1:09:42] fanaticism
[1:09:44] because we will meet him in the air at
[1:09:45] the same time we believe in balance
[1:09:47] and you say amen but look the last
[1:09:50] part of his life the third pull
[1:09:54] and then it went directly into eternity
[1:09:57] if somebody comes up brother marcus
[1:10:00] super movement in the message and you
[1:10:02] know like in the days of brother branham
[1:10:04] and we have this
[1:10:05] i mean you can stay cool you can say is
[1:10:08] it a world we rival
[1:10:09] or is it just a denominational
[1:10:11] charismatic revival upon a man
[1:10:14] you know exactly god does a word revival
[1:10:17] in our day
[1:10:18] make the next one please i'm just
[1:10:19] hurrying through right i mean
[1:10:21] next one no going back to this
[1:10:25] okay i'm just hiring in that way
[1:10:28] last one yeah now that's a prophet
[1:10:32] i mean this is 1963 the end of the year
[1:10:36] he comes the storm and comes down
[1:10:39] and here is the three deers they stood
[1:10:41] there a little while walked
[1:10:42] across to eat over my hand always turned
[1:10:45] around and looked at me like that and
[1:10:46] walked on
[1:10:47] and off and stand and looked again
[1:10:49] walked right out of the woods and i was
[1:10:50] standing i thought that's unusual for
[1:10:52] dear
[1:10:53] wonder if it's because the lord jesus is
[1:10:55] here his presence and just then a voice
[1:10:57] spoke to me
[1:10:58] you remember your promise didn't you i
[1:11:01] knew it was him
[1:11:02] i said yes lord now you understand
[1:11:05] why all these events are important to
[1:11:08] put them in a certain order
[1:11:10] because brother bram said in this
[1:11:11] message i was
[1:11:13] weary for many years
[1:11:17] i had a burden i went to the ocean i
[1:11:19] went into the
[1:11:20] and nothing satisfied me that was in
[1:11:22] october november 1963
[1:11:25] the opening of or the the message
[1:11:28] flashing red sign was in
[1:11:30] i think it was april or may 1964
[1:11:33] 63. in that service
[1:11:36] brother vay turned dead
[1:11:40] fell down dead people who were there
[1:11:43] gave their testimony
[1:11:45] that brother when brother way
[1:11:48] fell down that's just the way she's a
[1:11:50] nurse
[1:11:51] she looked at him and brother blame came
[1:11:54] from the pulp in his direction
[1:11:56] and since the weight said brother blame
[1:11:57] he's he's dead his eyes turned back
[1:12:00] and brother brain said something again
[1:12:02] which is gold god never forgets
[1:12:04] he said sister ray you are a nurse
[1:12:08] you had compassions with others now god
[1:12:10] has compassion with you
[1:12:12] you you get you you you get what you in
[1:12:15] a positive way
[1:12:17] it it matters to serve the law god god
[1:12:20] pays it back in wonderful ways
[1:12:22] but what happens here is a man
[1:12:26] raising up from the dead but the burden
[1:12:29] never left the prophet right right
[1:12:32] exactly exactly you can have every
[1:12:34] weekend signs and
[1:12:36] miracles whatever it will never solve
[1:12:38] your problem
[1:12:40] they are fine we love them we want to
[1:12:42] have more but this is not the answer
[1:12:44] on the challenge today the answer was
[1:12:46] the voice of god
[1:12:49] speaking to him he said so i do remember
[1:12:53] mine i will never leave you i will never
[1:12:55] forsake you
[1:12:56] that burden lifted christian friends it
[1:12:59] hasn't been back since
[1:13:00] that was last october i have been a
[1:13:03] different person
[1:13:04] keep your promise to god whatever you
[1:13:06] say to god you believe it
[1:13:07] separate yourself from anything contrary
[1:13:09] to the word god will hear
[1:13:11] and answer prayer let us bow our heads
[1:13:14] the raising up of the dead did not lift
[1:13:16] the burden of the prophet but when he
[1:13:18] heard his voice
[1:13:22] brother marx we need a new minister who
[1:13:24] comes up with the same gifts of the
[1:13:26] prophet
[1:13:26] the power lays in the spoken words
[1:13:30] hallelujah brother marcus
[1:13:34] uh we have to go to a certain convention
[1:13:36] one time in a year
[1:13:38] um and and in that conde convention we
[1:13:41] get
[1:13:42] rapturing faith and and and
[1:13:46] if if if you're not there you i said
[1:13:48] this is a very blessed doctrine
[1:13:50] right you know who's everybody blessed
[1:13:52] with this
[1:13:53] delta airlines
[1:13:57] american airways they love this kind
[1:14:00] of of doctrines because you have to go
[1:14:02] to a certain point to receive
[1:14:04] something but the brides
[1:14:08] she receives it from the words
[1:14:12] and then you can go from convention to
[1:14:13] convention but you understand i need to
[1:14:16] hear
[1:14:16] his voice to my heart and then you have
[1:14:19] conference with god
[1:14:22] hallelujah actually last one because i'm
[1:14:25] i'm harry and sue amen
[1:14:27] amen now israel why is god so thought
[1:14:31] and cared so much about that little
[1:14:32] place of palestine when it's just a
[1:14:34] little spot
[1:14:35] but right there is where the temple sets
[1:14:37] in that's where the new jerusalem will
[1:14:39] break right there
[1:14:40] olive mountain shall cleave part the
[1:14:42] right left shoulder when she pushes up
[1:14:44] from beneath
[1:14:45] now look at this
[1:14:48] the parallel because in the same night
[1:14:52] when israel was formed to be a nation
[1:14:53] the angel came to the prophet right
[1:14:56] look at this
[1:15:01] no civilization
[1:15:05] that was ever destroyed
[1:15:08] ever came back right right never
[1:15:11] you take the greeks
[1:15:14] you take the romans you take the meters
[1:15:19] the persians the babylonians
[1:15:23] you take the maya you take the at sticks
[1:15:26] you take the chinese you take every
[1:15:30] civilization that one time was destroyed
[1:15:33] it never came back again
[1:15:44] small dispersed
[1:15:47] but god is with them calls them after 2
[1:15:51] 000 years right on the same spot from
[1:15:53] where they belonged
[1:15:55] even theodore herzl wanted to put them
[1:15:58] to argentina
[1:15:59] or to uganda to put a place for the jews
[1:16:02] but
[1:16:02] god said i will remember
[1:16:06] my promise amen and look at this and how
[1:16:09] how wonderful that is
[1:16:12] we love the luther reformation the
[1:16:16] luther revival
[1:16:18] we love the pentecost revival in the
[1:16:20] azusa way street
[1:16:24] but one time a revival burns down
[1:16:29] according to the word of the prophet it
[1:16:31] never comes back
[1:16:32] again
[1:16:35] it never comes that's what the prophet
[1:16:37] says there is only one thing that comes
[1:16:39] back it's the word of the lord which was
[1:16:42] in the beginning comes back at the end
[1:16:45] i mean amen right god doesn't go back
[1:16:48] not even in the pentecostal move as we
[1:16:50] had a hundred years ago god goes forward
[1:16:53] god goes forward this is promised land
[1:16:55] time this is new
[1:16:57] a new dispensation of time coming
[1:17:01] i told the brother you have sometimes
[1:17:04] movements in the message and they start
[1:17:07] up and they crumble down
[1:17:10] everything that man started will be
[1:17:13] finished
[1:17:13] right at latest when the founder dies
[1:17:18] because it was his idea to collect
[1:17:20] people around his idea but when he dies
[1:17:22] everything will crop the only thing
[1:17:25] which will never die
[1:17:26] is the word of the lord because it's
[1:17:29] eternal amen
[1:17:30] therefore that sister says i prefer to
[1:17:32] be
[1:17:33] in the word than in heaven and i think
[1:17:36] even brother brain said how that
[1:17:38] and that sister said because heaven and
[1:17:39] earth will pass away
[1:17:41] but his word will never pass away i
[1:17:44] think this was the last
[1:17:46] just let me finish that story i mean
[1:17:49] can you say amen we are 35 at 45
[1:17:53] i'm through the lord is winning can you
[1:17:55] say amen according to my to my promise
[1:17:57] but it's just wonderful
[1:17:59] to share these thoughts to understand no
[1:18:01] matter where you are today
[1:18:04] you can be blessed by the right action
[1:18:07] but the right attitude
[1:18:08] and no matter how down you are today
[1:18:11] exactly
[1:18:12] god is not nervous about that condition
[1:18:15] because when he called you he saw all
[1:18:17] the way
[1:18:17] until the rapture and we have to
[1:18:21] understand
[1:18:22] that if we want to make it
[1:18:25] we have to have the right energy drink
[1:18:28] to eat the message of the hour and these
[1:18:30] cakes will bring us unto the holy
[1:18:33] mountain of the lord
[1:18:34] this time mount zion that little boy
[1:18:38] died
[1:18:41] when he was around 12 years old and that
[1:18:44] woman was settling the moon
[1:18:47] to go to the prophet elijah now
[1:18:51] the death of the little boy was
[1:18:54] hit to the prophet
[1:18:58] do you think that the prophet can be
[1:18:59] fooled
[1:19:01] it can be you know i think it was jacob
[1:19:04] he was even fooling his own father
[1:19:07] or right even brother brandon had a
[1:19:10] story where somebody says i need tires
[1:19:12] i'm a minister from stones and brother
[1:19:13] brahms says later
[1:19:14] he was a complete lie i gave him the
[1:19:15] money and then exactly so god allows
[1:19:17] many things
[1:19:18] god allows those things so he sends
[1:19:21] gehasi
[1:19:22] ask that wife what's wrong with her and
[1:19:25] she arrives and guess he said it's all
[1:19:27] well
[1:19:28] with your child all well and she said
[1:19:30] all as well
[1:19:32] brother said the little little one lays
[1:19:35] dead and she's at
[1:19:36] all as well what does it mean god is in
[1:19:39] control about everything
[1:19:41] so she came to the prophet he says uh
[1:19:44] now
[1:19:45] you promised me that son and now he's
[1:19:47] dead so you have to do something with it
[1:19:51] so god says so the prophet elijah says
[1:19:54] okay i will send a little gift some
[1:19:56] penty cost a blessing
[1:19:57] okay you have a little staff and uh
[1:20:00] gerhard you laid on the boy
[1:20:02] you know i hope i say the right thing
[1:20:06] we love gifts i wish i would have more
[1:20:09] gifts
[1:20:10] but gifts doesn't give you eternal life
[1:20:14] gifts help you that's fine but eternal
[1:20:17] life comes by the word
[1:20:18] by the spoken word exactly so
[1:20:22] sometimes you have more gifts and you
[1:20:23] have more confusion
[1:20:25] right so he sends a gift and lays it
[1:20:28] upon the dead child
[1:20:29] you know gifts are wonderful but gifts
[1:20:32] doesn't bring life
[1:20:33] not even today gifts can impress
[1:20:36] my speak life doesn't come from speaking
[1:20:38] in tongues life comes by the spoken word
[1:20:43] comes and says maya i tried everything
[1:20:44] he goes to the prophet said
[1:20:47] prophet you have to go yourself right
[1:20:52] whenever it becomes important for god
[1:20:55] he comes personally he doesn't set an
[1:20:58] angel
[1:21:00] i i just give you a little illustration
[1:21:03] here were those three boys in the fiery
[1:21:06] furnace
[1:21:08] and they went into it god is able to
[1:21:09] deliver us
[1:21:11] and god was just standing with his angel
[1:21:13] i make a little little not to be
[1:21:14] respected but just to make a little
[1:21:15] illustration
[1:21:16] and brother blame says and the first
[1:21:18] angel comes
[1:21:19] woolworths boomers let me go down
[1:21:23] i will go i was destroyed with fire
[1:21:26] and brother blame said god said i have
[1:21:29] to calm down
[1:21:30] myself because here is my children
[1:21:34] and he was the fourth man in that
[1:21:37] whenever it becomes
[1:21:38] important god comes down personally
[1:21:42] earlier take it to revelation 10 not
[1:21:45] into fanaticism but
[1:21:46] taking the time there is a time like
[1:21:48] never was before
[1:21:51] this is more than pentecost we loved it
[1:21:52] but this is more than this
[1:21:55] hallelujah now ty now that that that
[1:21:58] prophet elijah
[1:21:59] with the lord himself so he comes down
[1:22:02] personally
[1:22:05] and he goes in that room
[1:22:08] and he closes the door
[1:22:11] now this is just an illustration i might
[1:22:13] be wrong on this but just an
[1:22:14] illustration
[1:22:15] now tie this to the tent vision that the
[1:22:17] prophet had
[1:22:19] i mean to the little room right
[1:22:22] where people went in and exactly and
[1:22:25] came out
[1:22:26] amen now he was just
[1:22:30] i mean and he was there now outside the
[1:22:33] people because these people were
[1:22:35] charismatic they thought
[1:22:36] if god works it has to be loud
[1:22:40] it has to be emotional it i have to feel
[1:22:42] something but god does great things
[1:22:44] in silence so they were just telling him
[1:22:48] did you hear anything with nothing
[1:22:51] it was not in jesus name
[1:22:54] no no no no no no no no no but what he
[1:22:57] did then
[1:22:59] because brother abraham said it is
[1:23:02] the servants is so much in silence right
[1:23:06] he closed the door and laid
[1:23:09] himself upon the boy
[1:23:13] by healing in a special way right right
[1:23:17] and when he laid himself upon this look
[1:23:21] his nose became his nose his mouth
[1:23:25] became his mouth his mind became his
[1:23:28] mind
[1:23:30] and he was laying long enough upon the
[1:23:32] boy he began to sneeze seven times
[1:23:40] it was not a great healing gift that
[1:23:43] came but it was the person himself
[1:23:46] laying himself upon his bride his dead
[1:23:49] bride denominational dead bride
[1:23:51] laying it himself right i mean the rest
[1:23:56] outside did not see what happened inside
[1:23:59] but what god is doing today will not be
[1:24:02] a public show anyhow
[1:24:06] it is a platform time is over
[1:24:09] to invite somebody was especially to
[1:24:11] stir the people this is time
[1:24:13] to enter into the holy of holy with him
[1:24:16] personally so life was transmitted
[1:24:20] i mean and these were they heard nothing
[1:24:26] people say today i mean the message is
[1:24:30] silence is a little bit dead
[1:24:33] i always say it's that for you
[1:24:37] because the bride is in a revival like
[1:24:39] never before
[1:24:41] like never be this is another form than
[1:24:43] pentecostal this is
[1:24:45] hearts revive this is the word
[1:24:46] manifested in us
[1:24:48] but it's a process it takes time
[1:24:52] maybe one of them one of the servants
[1:24:54] called in
[1:24:56] elijah what are you doing
[1:25:00] we hear nothing and elijah said
[1:25:04] you cannot teach pentecost and baby
[1:25:06] supernatural things that is
[1:25:18] laying upon him and now let me finish by
[1:25:21] the last
[1:25:22] i'm going in time i'm in all right
[1:25:25] look the time that we live amen loud is
[1:25:28] here because god builds up a bride
[1:25:31] pentecostal age speaking in tongues
[1:25:33] great time
[1:25:35] we thank god i time
[1:25:38] god send the prophet the eyes now is the
[1:25:40] if if you have a head like this only
[1:25:43] till here i mean something is missing
[1:25:45] intelligence time the mind of christ
[1:25:50] let me pass something if the mind of
[1:25:52] christ that's the supernatural part
[1:25:54] today
[1:25:55] and you cannot make bodybuilding here
[1:25:56] it's silent
[1:25:58] but great things are going in these
[1:26:01] little heads
[1:26:03] there's not much in it be sure but the
[1:26:05] little brain which is in it there's many
[1:26:07] things
[1:26:08] that's going in so god is in a stage
[1:26:11] today where people think nothing happens
[1:26:14] and you could say
[1:26:15] this is the greatest time for the bride
[1:26:20] hey say amen god
[1:26:23] remembers yes hallelujah pastor dave you
[1:26:26] will pray with us
[1:26:27] hallelujah god bless you it was a
[1:26:29] pleasure to speak to you right
