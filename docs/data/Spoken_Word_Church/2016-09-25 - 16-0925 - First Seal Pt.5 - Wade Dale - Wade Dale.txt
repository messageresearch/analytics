TRANSCRIPT
========================================
three of us all right good morning again today good video today hope everybody have a good weight getting of a new one here and the floor it's been good to you I'll slide in hand squeeze in we got a full house is long and bob has gone to preach for brother Joe Robertson McCabe will so remember him I love you don't know what if you didn't know brother bud kissing down or died this morning so oh yeah he passed away this morning 89 years old went to his reward donde in the intern extra it was one then borrowed time brother anybody over seven he's living on borrowed time the Lord this gave us there in two years okay now what we were problem at last sunday is the seal and let's read it before we go back to Jane let's read revelation 6 first one I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him they went forth conquering and to conquer all right that's the opening of the first field now what you watch something that will it will help you as we flow through this right as we go through this watch the flow now he's going to get on he got on this horse at some point and Road which are horses a lot of power not a physical horse but it was it was a power but it was an evil power disguised as the white righteous church ok it was disguise because its way but I'm always went to the Bible on this one is if you're like it's a light that you think it's not like it's a light that you think you do you think it's like but it's not that's the greatest darkness and deception you can ever be in my father son Holy Ghost baptism Trinity you know if you believe that and that's part of your you're believing then you're deceived that's the biggest deception i read it to you in just a second out of the Bible and that's world remember Sunday right at the end I told you to watch this seal open up and show one true and living God ok dot 3921 true Living God because this fella is not God he's anti God and you say well how important is real important that that when when the property God said here stands a lamb with a book in this man that's not the third part or the second person of the Trinity Father Son and Holy though that's not the son standing there and the father somewhere helps and you got you know the Holy Ghost over here know Christ the Lamb the Holy Ghost one person God is one person with one personality not multiple personality that makes them let's get the phrenic come on in brother this is brother Gilbert right he is from cloverdale at brother fiscal dirty didn't have him with us today he's down for a conference where his work and he's going to be with us today we're good to have your brother god bless you come down in the south if you can't understand this just tell me you can understand on the plan you got it okay alright so we've been in the first seal now for a while and I want to come up to something because as we said before this seal was preached and broke by the Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 24 right okay we ready Matthew 24 24 you come on in come on in there and find your seat we're a little tight today so come on in we've got the we've got to steal open now I I said before some say the seals are open some set of Steel's are closed right well if they say or if they whoever they have if they say the seals are close they are cuz you close your mind off for something you have clothes what God is open all right but Matthew 24 Jesus broke the seal it was in a mystery and then what did that same Jesus in the form of the holy ghost comes back on the that must I'll Pamela's and breaks the seal and symbol form to John right all right then we had a profit come in 1963 in March and he brought the revelation of the seal right so we've had a three-fold confirmation Jesus himself reach them John wrote when he saw and then brother round took him and he give us the between the lines now let's not be so narrow-minded I like my brother round we're so narrow-minded you couldn't put a pencil between both eyes and not touch both of them that's real narrow minded when you got both eyes together alright that's going to be so narrow-minded excuse me to see that this is all there is to it brother ground it broke the seal 1963 right all seven I believe yes well why don't we take a raptor why are we 50 years down the road still teaching the same message right I thought he said it was a readiness of the bride not that the word wasn't here with the readiness of the people that are under the work that's the truth right so it's wonderful to know the symbols it's wonderful to know what they mean and the prophet of God told us what they made their right all right if he told us what they mean that we can take this this picture and put it together not by our own interpretation because remember we must read between the lines but it's got to compare with this line in this life all right when we you know many people if I brother's been in the message long enough he knows that a lot of people said that the seventh seal broke was polygamy are the seven still broke what's the seven thunders or seven voices like Joe Coleman and him up in New York you know that had to be seven people that broke the seals too it's not true that took them that didn't open to them that was man's idea that wasn't got all right just like Martin Luther preaching a trendy that what in God's idea God's never revealed a trendy colors nuts that stain God's never revealed three gods so they never won he ought to know that and if he teaches anything different he's not the real guy ok so the one that teaches that is somebody else and the proper and God said remember we've got twins so close so close Satan's not out in the barroom Saints not out in the prostitute rings in the places like that nice in church try but Nadia's in your head contrary to God's Word you shall what I'm immune to that well you're liar I was reading if you read your adoption series brother Brown said he was talking about sins he said a center I don't have since we were listening level of the night I read it again last night Center does not have sent sins I sent her as a center he's condemned because he don't even have anything of God he don't care he's just condemned but we as Christians have sins floral reading your adoption Siri we have sins around silly send every day but now the one inside was done the Holy Office thought I was never seen today in his life ya never had a bad thought never had a bad word there ain't anything right but we got to deal with the spirit realm in the flesh then really you don't be able to the flesh remember the flash is nothing with just them it's just the way you work this just holds one I am together alright because when you take this out what is this it's just a shell I'm not there anymore this is just a shell what's inside of me is that firing mechanism the property go I said that light that burns that makes your heart beat it makes all those things go together you know right and even in your spirit realm now you got to remember too that up I was think about this other day an animal doesn't help soul yeah it's a living being let's think about that so even the beast was a living being but he didn't tell salt an animal has life what that's the spiritual part of the person but a man is made in the image of God he has a soul because God is assault hey right and then now we take Satan and we see him trying to copy the reason that he is trying to copy is because God can make a soul and God he said don't worry about the one that killed the flesh he you worry about that man who can kill the soul is only one man can kill saw that's a guy thing created him killer right same can't kill yourself right no saying can't create another one so he perverts everything that God does he twists it just by one word yes I told y'all before and I'm telling you again if one word not got us out of the garden then that one word off is not going to give us back in the garden you show all that's impossible well Jesus was the sinless son of God on the earth right and human flesh right we know he wasn't born in sin but we are but you know what with the life that he has living in me it's what I told you the other day I want to tell you go don't beat yourself up if you're born again you're in rapture in condition you're already wrapped you're already sitting in heaven question their soul is actually in another dimension never that's where you get your revelation from you don't get revelation for this dimension Satan rules these first three dimension and really four and five see all them he's in and but God's got six and seven and he brings revelation from that seventh dimension and brings it to you and if it's a revelation from God it comes out of that faster dimension come then to that soul that you have and what there's that firing mechanism yeah everything's fired on the right cylinder alright everybody got that right so what are we doing we are showing the Antichrist but really this is let's go to the point to where this has got to be revealing Jesus Christ because of Revelation actually that what did he what did he do conquering and conquer he didn't go out physically kill people of course Satan is a killer destroyed but here this is spiritual he spiritually killed the people remember the first church age there was no badness Methodist Pentecostal there was no denomination to the first none so there was sure there were ideas sames don't remember those some sayings deeds to doctrines to incarnate right so the settings went out on this white horse he was saying even Paul says the greediest wolves have come among you and you'll keep reading the scripture it says that among you now so they were already there he knew that spirit of Antichrist Paul I mean dumb John when he comes back in Little John's he's talking about the spirit of Antichrist why don't each wingtip at once and saw what the thing was doing it was working through the church not through the world yes all right property gosh that if we get quite a revelation to the two spirits in the framework of the church message church not that turns out yonder this church because there is two spirits in this church if we have the pinnacle true Word of God which I believe we do we hold the truth more than anyone on the face of the earth don't you think that's the first thing they going after he's not going after he's coming right here all right he's gonna be so close and behold a white horse he's telling had a boat so we know it wasn't bluffing he had a bow but he had no arrows to shoot with the shoot and a crown was given unto him what his crown crown is recognition the recognition was given to him to go do what he's going to do remember he he who laid it will let until he be taken out the way right that's he who let it well that's Oh God let this happen to what to prove to Satan that he's God alright but watch this and I know you know this but we're going to go to everything James now watch games 19 thou believe is that there is one God that do as well I show me a Trinity in that there is none now believe is that there is one God what is the first commandment here the e 0 Israel your God is one a man and Jesus said I come in my father's name while heating we don't call him father Bill with its Jesus Jesus Christ that's the only name God ever had with your Jesus Christ that's why we have to be baptized in it name now do as well but James tell us a little more the devil's also believe and tremble see there in that dimension of close enough to God to know that there's not three people sitting up there they've never seen three people but Satan their their head honcho send out an email one dance there's no this three you just can't see the other 2 i'm one of them says sleep that is no because look Satan is the second most spiritual person ever ever ever to be that's right God's one Lucifer was right next to God so he's the second most spiritual person in the world and any any dimension yeah that was perfect in Ezekiel that was perfect until an equity was founded what would come out iniquity product of iniquity we've done by the first sale right all right what is iniquity an equally is knowing that there's one guy and believe in three or even two okay but they're Devils also believe in trouble but then they filter down into this dimension 3 right they see where I'm going with this i hope this revelation of the first seal it's not only that the Antichrist is that white horse rider is the Antichrist but when brother instead when you see to one's got to be God one going to be the devil not three or four so when he says here stands a land with a book is hand and there goes the white horse rider there's God standing there and the devil is riding away from now that's what you want you want gun resist the devil and he will flee from you all right that's kind of a very short scripture but you know what it's one of those title prescriptions in the box in the bottom resist the devil and he will flee from you that's really hard it is hard cuz you know what we do we don't do that we don't resist him that's the problem so now through the ages man has proved that this scripture trying to find out saying that this was the Christ right me me me me me me me man commentary have told this even brother Adam in 1957 and 59 priest the mighty conquer he read this scripture and called it the holy of now you say what you won't do but it was a firmament of Revelation when the seal open because he was getting ready to write the same notes I read it the other day in the steelbook page 109 I would have made a horrible mistake black he was riding the same notes he had brother mighty conference that this was the price not the Antichrist and you said we'll go that's that's horrible no it's not it's not horrible man if I find out I'm wrong but when I'm so deceived i think i'm right and i won't listen to somebody yeah that's worse cuz that light that i think i have has become the most gross darkness anyone ever had right bell grande para got 36 feet 10 i would have absolutely today and I hope people are spiritual so this is not just some goof up are happening gone planes this in this book place this in the prophets life for him to tell us about alright alright I want to win Hartley I hope that people are spirit I would have had have had a horrible mistake on that and that is capitalized in the book so they know what he was talking about the revelation of who this person was if it hadn't been about twelve o'clock when the Holy Spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that I was writing down say i was taking it from an old contact I had nothing on it so the Holy Spirit came right down and the whole thing opened up see that was the sealed opening to the Prophet what was it doing correcting error now even William Branham from the get-go he knew there was only one God he still was deceived by that one thing but when a sealed open vote Carolyn that seal open where did he see the white horse rider go he saw riding away from him yes we must see it riding away from us it'll do us no good to see that it rode away from brother Brown brother Dale or whoever you guys see it riding away from you that your error is being corrected to me that's the greatest opening on the seal what that does is that brings you up into a higher plane it brings you up into a level that I believe God can speak to you a little bit those remember God will speak to you but it will only speak to you by revelation he can't speak to you by error that's right he can't there's no way God can't do that that's my that's my brother and I will show you later when he saw that and remember that wasn't the only one if you go to the fifth seal he thought that sold under the altar was Christian people us and go ahead to correct him on that one no sold under the altar that's the Jews 26 in the half a million or 58 mary 6 & 5 millions of Jews it was killed under i'm in a Hitler and abused it had held their testimony so you see then what we look we look at me said one good that doesn't mean anything yeah it does you know what he does it drives that unclean this out if I'm not unclean yeah in your spirit realm right now you're not clean you only had my have bad thoughts a day well then your spirit round up clean ewie memory reason we reason own things we shouldn't conscious imagination oh boy don't we imagine stuff Yeah right affection that affection in that in that realm there God has to come through that figlio love to bring that agape love to you got it we think filial love is so wonderful and it is God give us enough of that love down here to love each other love her wife and all these things right but there's something brother Brown said it goes further further further when he went across the curtain time he was telling that in the adoption theory when he went across the curtain time he said it's just perfection he said it's just something that you just don't know anything about don't leave not been there but we already charl creatures inside and I think it once in a while God allows it to raise up every watch sitting in heavenly places right in Christ Jesus and let's just be real honest eighty percent of our life is spent sleeping and doing worldly things and i'm not saying worldly things like where I'm talking about work sleep work parenting husband wife family yeah I don't get with just a little bit bro yup nothing get a lot but you know what though we must focus that little bit of time that we do now right and let God have that time yes just waiting have that time because he listened staying about this elevator ah sometimes I think we don't think God knows everything and I'm not saying hiding stuff I'm just saying you know you do something you and you know you goof up for you do something you know just a Oh God forgive me and you know he's like aw he is going to do that 10 billion years ago i'm no you know what now what you gonna do that okay I know what you're going to do about but you don't know what you right right but he know he knows the whole thing well I said this Bible perfect in the prophets message is perfect we must rely on that because if we're going to go to perfection it's got to all come back to that it can't go to the denomination or an idea that's what these sales report it's driving out all that uncleanness general you remember sister Sheppard's dream you saw when I got the Holy go back on everything why does sister Sheppard have a dream that that trash was coming out of the pyramid remember the pyramid and talk about it the water was running out and it had trash in it and brother Graham said she was asking what is she was born again or not young ground said yes you're born again but the trash was still coming out right so we still have trash well if you if you don't pray for me I did trash in trash out like you computer-guided you no good in good out bad in bat out you know and I behold a white behold and I saw behold a white horse he was telling how to vote crown was given unto them went forth conquering and to conquer what was he conquering with brother Brown even goes and shows that what influence I don't you can't see this but there's third age ended at six of six right that 606 was the Nicene council that took the let me say their revelation that Jesus was a light substance of God not these systems can go so that in turn made him a Trinity then they say well obviously there's got to be a holy ghost in there somewhere so let's make it three people three persons in the Godhead father son go go right what's the next age the next day just the Catholic age the prophet of God said the Dark Ages when Catholics rude is they dragged the longest a complete something 15 20 foot cross the daughter back and kill people for not believing their doctrine who was that with that God because we're fixing to get to where he jumped on this horse when he jumps on that horse we come into this age right but this horse doesn't stop this horse keeps going the seal ends just like a stair-step we've talked about the steel ends and the National come from the second seal it's what first thing is ready all right read what happened in that age 68 million Protestants were killed blood physically brother ever said no telling how many spiritual died during that time right there when the Catholic try to call dark when the Catholics took over but let's continue with this just for a second wild horse bow and a crown and concrete when he concur with that was one thing he concurred with he split got up so we thought this was God yeah at first we thought this was God and all the glorious things is going on the devil was hit right in there in the Word of God right cuz that he right there is not God that he is the Antichrist amen and he's being revealed he can only be revealed are made known by God being revealed in you that there's only one done because that's what the worst problem they had was the one God and you say well what a quiet 11 God's real simple listen 1 God's the whole message yes because that revelation comes from one God that's the true revelation then if you get something this contrary to that it's the devil I mean it's just like black and white in any ain't no gray area it's either from God all right either comes from the belt there's no in-between that's great you're either sitting on that horse within our he's riding away from you and when he rides away brother right he's gone as far as that revelation is concerned so that's why said about one good and one god it's like runnin l said you take one gun you say well water baptism different oh no it's not the true if you get a true revelation there's only one true and living God in Jesus Christ it is named there's only one way to be baptized then that's in the name of Lord Jesus Christ rather father's not a name son's not a name whole notes is not named they're not an anger of towels to that one man Jesus Christ great that guy right there the lamb right but it's all on the radio now that said it'd be roar like a lion but he bled like a lamb and that's good then it's true he roared like a lot of everything he said was exactly the truth he said haha coaches agree he said what I told you the truth well he went right he never lied her name is life okay so that was the pure lamb that opened the seal so where has he got to be to open it he can't be out there and he can't be in brother so and so whoever you put in a brother school brother Dale pastors of the church you got me in you he got be in you you've got to see the revelation of what this seal opening produces because it's got to produce something yet listen it has not produced a rapture yet but it will that's why those seals brother Brown said I'm worked in many rounds what about a land that stood in front of in India and saw a hundred thousand people be healed a hundred thousand there's not that many hundred thousand people in the whole city of gainesville in hall county yeah that's a hundred thousand people instant healing several thousand received Christ as Savior he said I've never worked in a realm spirit around like a word with a steel flat heathens temporary salvation can mean salvation but if you don't go on then what happened to those people they went right back into the churches number got saved that's okay but they never grew because they had nothing to grow with this is why this is the growth part of your development of the Christian Right it's okay to drink milk milk is all right I like a good cold glass of milk every once in one but I don't like it every day for every meal every time I come to church I don't want to drink milk okay because from the Bible's they posted your unskillful see brother branham skillful with the word he was a prophet he knew what he was talking about now he had his own idea of this because other content but when God opened that up to him see to me that's why that spiritual he came into a great around because he knew them one thing was for sure God was right there he wasn't off somewhere else he he was right there right cuz look let me ask you this question now brother branham I just read a parent page 109 in them in the steelbook brother I've said the Holy Spirit came in the room I thought the Holy Spirit was inside up he is holy ghost filled brother now I'm telling you he had the Holy Ghost Dance old man but that was a different anointing you saw yeah that's a different anointing you get an anointing for preaching you got anointing for him you got him only for this you got an auntie for that right different anointing and like he would be he would be praying for the sick or getting ready to pray for the sick well that's good profit a man offensive Son of God standing there saying I'm waiting on him what was he waiting though he was waiting on an anointing to come that he knew what it would bring her when he came ok same way with that angel but at Angel would come into the room and talk to him show em Scripture but remember that angel that spoke to brother round never revealed one thing doing it had to ring in here first it had a ran in here yes watch because he'd say the angel came in the room and then he'd spent all day looking at skechers one out if you and I be honest we're setting up studying we're praying and work we're meditating on something and all of a sudden a man walks through the wall walks in the room and he's standing there and he said I'm an annual company night number one you'd be scared to death but number two what if he said when I want you to go out today and I want you to preach father son Holy Ghost is the correct baptism now for ninety percent of people in the world world they would net they just dead run out they'd hit the pull pin say an angel walk through the law I told me what to say to you not a holy ghost feeling person that's not somebody skillful in the word that can cut the meat right sharper than a two-edged story to divide between the soul and spirit goes remember that that that angel came to the was it so hard Martin hema st. Martin and said I'm God worship me there was something wrong Martin's holy goes there was a little tough one envelope someone offensive huh you have a crime on your head word posed to crown you when this thing's over get out of here Satan right but why did that the Holy Ghost his filter this filter came up and gave him a revelation of what that was same way brother Brennan a revelation came up in him the Holy Spirit came into room and and I don't I wasn't there but he said he corrected him what he was going to preach see the angel could have said well brother ground when he breathed what he'd been preaching all your lap one true and living God in Jesus is his name and that Holy Ghost sinful that's another person that's another person the wheels go turning into profits head well if that's another person and tool antelope of the seal and that person riding away that's two people right go right back to your foundation if this is god that's got to be a different person fellow he calls him a fellow a lot that fellow that person why they don't give him any honor he just is there somebody seems Adele hiding and brother Brown says he corrected me on what I was getting ready free so so high what I what I'm telling you is is you can have the bathroom the Holy Ghost but there is an anointing that will come and it will teach you something man the inside teacher is the inside teacher but you gotta hear it from another listen if we if we believe the way we believe that every time another vesicle brother dale bro Louise aaron any of us stand up and preach and we preach the true Word of God that is the holy ghost speaking to you all right but now remember the only thing about brother Brennan was different is it's because the Prophet answers to nobody but God see the profit that God talked to the prophet the prophet delivers it does so nobody could get between brother random and God God had to come and deliver that revelation to the Prophet himself when you know what I'm saying no preacher came in between that's it brother Ram you're wrong there's no preacher Patel brother around me was wrong God is young 1 for telling it was wrong yeah then the filter comes down to the pastors teachers evangelist and all that to give it to you and I so we get it the same way brother Ram guy we listen to the Holy up we listen to what the only those headphones man that's the same thing i mean same thing happened what's correcting in our error the Holy Ghost is speaking to us through profit Patrick T that even your sister center on top brother right then so it's not so far what I'm saying it's not so far-fetched things that happened to brother round two things that happen to us it just happens in a little different way the holy ghost came into a little brother round of corrected equine nobody else can correct the problem but now we take what the Prophet said and then you know these people that put polygamy in to sold and seven Thunderbirds users all that they didn't get that from here they didn't come with a problem right so in between their step somebody and you know what they've done they accepted it instead of rejecting it brother brown rejected that old doctrine and it went away from riding away he went forth conquering and conquer what others maybe we read Matthew behold I'm Christ it's over here let's go over here behold crisis in the desert behold Christ is he if crisis in you you don't have to go to death because you know what they're gonna they're gonna try to lead you away whose day that he and his Devils they're gonna try to lead you away from that's why i said if you don't have the Holy Ghost you will be the same and you are all ready to see you don't have the bathroom the homeless in your soul you still can be too safe oh yeah you can't y'all you know you had a little a little bit of that last way for you yes you can't be too safe brother Brad wants to see right Martin Luther was to see by this brighter not enough word to get that out but when you come to the fullness of this word that got everything out everything out in the open that's what I said to me the seals are open in plain view but if you say their clothes you shut it right up you shut the book you shut the book bank but one man can show the book and open the book when Jesus walked in that temple that Danny said this danger scripture fulfilled about the city shows the book and handed it back to the preacher he's the owner but when you come revelation 6 open then you go to revelations 10 the book is open all right why is it open its open because there's a revelation in there that Satan is the anti-christ but there's one true and living God and Jesus Christ is his name and that to me is a revelation of that first seal you got to get that foundation right first cuz everything is built on the revelation one trail in the dark because even the devil's believe it and then they feed it to you that this tree what iniquity what a deception see that to me that's the highest form of nickel be there is it's for a spiritual being to look at the Creator that created them turn around and feed it to the people that there's three and Hempstead one and you say oh that's way up Gunderson nice working in your spirit realm every day you say well I don't have a problem with one God it may not be just wondering maybe a lot of other things got it so this first feel is that rider rides off what is it doing it's made us to the part that the lamb stands here with the book in his hand now that's not baby form justification we'll talk about that next Sunday because we got to put them we got to put the redemption in the seal right so we have to put justification sans kitchen bathroom hold off into the seal all right so what's the greatest form of justification the real you didn't do it right the real you never done it and that rides off from you the louie is justified he's already going funny that's all right glory in your justification that God has justified you and if you don't have a problem sound telling you one God if you don't have a problem with that slide it over to the side and lay it down and make a foundation and build everything up for company all right we'll talk just a little bit more on the first field next sunday then we go to sexy let's go you
