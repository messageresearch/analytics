========================================

yeah got it okay just recording good okay all right well we're in the book of revelation we're in the book of revelations and we're going to go to revelation chapter four hey baby hey how you doing oh good to be danny i'm glad you i'm glad you brought in paw paw with you today yeah grand van gaal granddad's a chair huh you want something you want a chair yeah yeah come and sit right here right there you can head out that way we're just readjusting since we haven't been together in a while is that got enough power because it's not plugged in it's got enough power to orbit now we're trying to get everything back to normal maybe normal as we can get so uh god bless you we're gonna remember we went to the church ages through revelations chapter one two and three now remember the revelations chapter one two and three are or is god in the church ages god in the people in the seven stars and in the seven churches that were in each character ephesus smyrna pergamos and make sure i get them around thy torah sardis philadelphia and then laodicea and we know for a fact we're at the end of this layout of the age going heading toward the millennium because after this church age is over we take a rapture for us the church ain't to be over that church age goes all the way through that old seventh day that goes all the way to the future home so so that's in time time's going to continue on through the millennium it will be a thousand years it will be 360 days of the year not 365 and a quarter right and it'll be that time continue will go but now when time will be no longer is when that new city comes down and we're even going to still be in time when when the judgment we look in the book of revelations where the books are open and judgment is set well that's still in time because those people that come up to that judgment bar are still in time but now once that's done once the devil's destroyed and all his ants are destroyed all this the spirits and evil things are destroyed then god's going to set this thing back up the way it should have been had they're not being followed amen then there'll be eternity it will time brother brown said time will blend into eternity right and um for us it'll be a we're in an eighth day now but our bodies are in the seventh day or in the seventh church age because we're in time that's why i said time would continue on after we're gone so this is what's happening now watch revelations remember this keep it straight brother ryan will tell us revelations chapter one through three everybody got that it's showing the bride and the characteristics of what we've got to put up with from the beginning until this time right here so that's the bride on earth everybody got that say amen because it's going to be important what we're going to talk about now because brother brown says in revelations 4 1 the bride leaves the earth and is not seen until revelations 19 that's a big jump right from revelation 4 to revelations 19 because what is revelations 19 us writing back in the millennium still in time we're coming back in time but now we're eternal creatures right now you're an eternal creature inside right but you're still in the old seventh day because everybody that's born of sex is in the seventh day you can't get out of it unless you die or take a body change all right and then that releases that first birth that that second birth can take over all right and that's what's going to happen we have a question the other day about the change of the body that's that's literally what's going to happen time is going to have to blend into eternity for us and the body here is going to be that the old body is not going to die but it's going to have to move over enough for that not new body the body that's inside of you that's forming can just take over the whole thing right and that's what happened to jesus jesus didn't have to get a new body right he resurrected in the same body that he lived in so are we but he remember he turned back to 20 years old because the gardener didn't recognize who he was even mary or mary thought he was a gardener because he turned back to a 20 year old kid all right i say kid when you're 60 years old 20 years a kid when you're 20 it's saying gold are you 28 not even close 17 oh i got shoes over here [Music] when you say move over that body's going to move over can you expound that is a that is a example you're not going to come out of this body but your first body is going to yield to your second body the first body your mom and daddy made is what's killing us but i mean is this body just going to get younger and younger well it'll be a change in the moment and the twinkling of an eye just boom well that's what happened to abraham and sarah sometimes when they went to bed they were 99 they preached about that 99 and whatever she was okay 99 and 90 or 80 what else you though but when they woke up the next morning abraham thought he got the wrong bed sarah thought she got the wrong bed but that's what's gonna happen it's gonna be but i don't think we're gonna have to go to sleep for that to happen because remember that's the type they died remember they continued on and they died same way with um lazarus what am i what am i saying when we get a body change that's not going to be it changes back to young people when we get old and die again ours is permanent jesus didn't have to jesus's body was old well you know he wasn't 33 but he looked old but when he come out of that tomb he was in that 20 year old body that coincided with the theophany that's inside that was inside of him and it just took over that's what happened because that soul released and went to hell right all right preaching the souls in prison getting a little bit off the subject here but anyway we're fixing to take a change right here so when he comes back up and when he steps inside that body because remember if somebody passes away at this moment you don't have to open the door for them to get out that spirit becomes in a faster dimension of that soul boom and you're in another dimension this one has to stay here because what we're lifelike matter we're solid our spirit's not solid the soul inside of you is not solid at the moment okay but one day mortal will become immortal that's what happened to jesus when he stood up you know he said all power in him and earth again in other words when he god almighty human flesh was in a flesh it was getting older he could not change his body at the time he was coming up why because he had to be the ultimate sacrifice he was the lamb so the lamb had to be put up in flesh but when he died on the cross he said unto them your hands i commend my spirit we know what happened the body just died when the spirit leaves the body it dies right so that's what happened to has happened in the past now what's going to happen is somebody's going to break around you know makes the example that death is going to come up your sleeve it's not going to start your gut dying it's an example when death comes on you because listen it's like brother brown said i'm not afraid of death but there is a little bit of a fear there because you don't know the you don't know the unknown what is it like the very moment you pass away and once well he told us he just said you step over into another dimension and you don't want to go back to that one so now there are some people that die that would like to come back because they go to a bad place i've always said about the jihadists and all them and get 70 virgins and all that other stuff they have a real rude awakening when they die when they blow theirself up they are not they are not in the same place that they thought they were going to but now you and i if you get born again get the baptismal holy ghost in your soul we know where we're going there is no doubt that you if you were to pass away you're going to step over into that other not another body it's just this one that's inside of you it's just going to move faster so it can go through that wall and you're standing in a faster dimension the sixth dimension thank god brother brown went there told us about it he said why would you fear this see so we have a apprehension of death but you should never fear death if you're born again if you're born again free pass free pass all the way into the future home but i would not want to be hey i would not say amen say amen amen amen just knock on dude that's what a lot of y'all do up in the sanctuary anyway not smile or nod and fall asleep but we've come to a place now to where we're going to take a rapture and then things are going to take place so this is what i'm telling you to break up to make up to this is that we look and brother brown says the bride goes up in revelation 3 1 4 1 and is not saying to revelations 19 well there's a lot that goes on now he says that's to the jews now that is correct because the prophet knows what he's talking about and it's correct to us if we know what we're talking about right because revelations 4 1 is us going in the rapture but it says look after this i looked and behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet what a message talking to me now who typed the bride john type the whole ride right talking to me which said come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter so that's typing the rapture but you know what it's also typing it's also typing revelation when you come to the end of the church age in your life because we go through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and the opening of the word amen everybody got there one more time first three first three church ages type justification yes that mental church aids type sanctification right the fifth and sixth church age types the baptism of the holy ghost the man the intelligence and then the eagle age is the revealing or the coming up higher because without brother brown's message we couldn't go no higher right right we just have to keep dying waiting on somebody that's why i want to ask these people that doesn't think brother brown is the last prophet for the end time who's coming because somebody's got to do it right somebody's got to bring a message to get us in that door now who's the door christ christ is always the door but remember there's a porter that stands in the door that opens the door and tells you what's inside it preached that many times on the quarter because there was a porter came in every age pentecost was falling down paul comes on the scene opens the door lets the grip in then god doesn't shut the door man starts shutting the door when man starts shutting the door god stands irenaeus and he opens the door to the second church aid smyrna you understand what i mean so you've got porter's they're in uh john 10 i believe it is that's where it talks about the porter the porter stands at the door and if you'll notice in your very large hotels which i've never been to but one or two when somebody else paid for it was uh there's always a guy standing there with a tuxedo on and some of them even have top hats on and they have the cane and and they're i guess you may call it a concierge now it's somebody that knows everything about that building i said it right now they closed enough okay nobody else attempted nobody attempted to to uh correct me because most of the time they do june's name destiny is that right here a concierge is somebody that if you need to know where to go what time to eat where's the bathroom where's the ice machine you asked that person all the activities going on do i oh yeah all the activities in the area that's what the porter does because you know what the porter has entered in because you see what brother brown says i'm sorry we're not getting anywhere but paul god sends paul paul goes into the mind of god finds out what the people need and then he steps back out because you know he's not god right he's a representative right because the concierge usually is not the owner right and a porter is usually not the owner the owner you don't see the owner standing at the door of the hotel right he's off somewhere else okay because he built the thing he built a business model he built the plans and he had somebody build the building so he's off somewhere else that sounds like something familiar god gives you the plan builds the building puts everything there and he don't go off anywhere but he's not on the scene who's on the scene these seven starts the porter comes out stands the door paul says gives the message or somebody comes to the door and he says this is what's inside you go to the right service desk go to the left restaurant and he tell that's the same way as what hat what's happening when god sends these characters or messengers in each church age they're porters and they tell you what's the mind of god for that time period that time period not period but that time period each one of these so here we have brother branham at the end same thing porter but he's not just a porter he goes back into the mind of god and gets everything we need to take a body change okay and it does make him a little special but god's not a respectable person but i'm telling you he had a different every person every person had one message to give paul irenaeus martin columba all born martin luther wesley but when brother brown comes that's why it stumps people when he says i'm what i'm not the messenger of sia he's not right he'd be allowed or a pentecostal that's a pentecostal age because you got to look at brother brown with two things he had to do everybody else had to do just one bring your message preach to the people die go off the scene all right brother brown comes with two things he had to do number one restore just like all the other ones restore back to but he didn't just he didn't restore us back to right here the alpha and omega had to be the same so he had to restore us back to the faith of the fathers in the first church age which is the statue of a perfect man right that's why it's so ill-taught in this message but it's the very foundation of the first part of brother brown's message if you can't get you you say well this is a mystery hey paul peter they were all right here right yeah they had these virtues working in their life so this is not something new brother now look brother brown did come to bring us the pyramid and faith virtue knowledge temperance you know to draw the chart remember he was sitting in the woods squirrel hunting he said the revelation came and this is what he drew to preach the statue of a perfect man but where do you get it from first peter saint peter yeah add to your faith virtue virtual knowledge but nobody's ever done this so you can put this some of you can't see them i know they inside this can see that brother brown put all this together though he takes revelations three one through three he takes and positions all the messengers see what brother brown's doing he's restoring just like elijah did excuse me in kings when the prophets of baal beat down the altar for the altar of first thing elijah done he never said a word he went and started putting the rocks back on the altar what he was restoring worship right so he's restoring back to right here we can't get people in the message off from down here yeah baby faith because you're not born again right here you're not born again anywhere except down here below the pyramid if you're not born again this is nothing but a beautiful picture i mean really it's just a pretty picture if you're not born again because you're born again at faith justification satisfaction baptism of the holy ghost god honors your faith just like he honored abraham's faith and circumcised him he honored abraham's faith i in your faith and circumcises your heart and gives you the bible from the holy ghost according to your faith yes right right right right but brother brown says god give me this eye he said this is my eye god gave it to me so when god gives you the new birth it's not his anymore sure so then you start again as we've talked many times before you start again then in justification because what does justification do the real you did we're not going to get anywhere but revelations 4 1. down here the real you did it when you start coming up through these things and you see god knocking a lot of this stuff out of your life the trash remember in sister chapter 3 of the trash when he starts knocking that trash out you go through another stage of justification not to justify you of your past sins that's already done but you got you start seeing it again yes you do why do you think all the trash had to be burned out after you get the new birth why do you think you need all these verses after you mourning you i just got everything see that's what a lot of people say in the message to me that's a lazy christian to say that man then i got everything i needed and i'm just gonna sit at home or i'm gonna right you know that's right folks this is the fight you're fighting your old nature all the way up through here that's right that's right but god's gonna show you in this type of justification that the real you didn't do it yeah you know you did it like i've always said you drive by them places i can't do away with them places i did bad things that but you know what god doesn't sell that's why you should never ever ask god to forgive you your past sins if you've already asked him to forgive you and you believe you've been justified he's going to look at you and go what sin is you talking about but you do sin as a christian this is what brother brown's talking about you sin as a christian right here you don't sin as a christian down here because you're not a christian until you get the right hand everybody got that right trying to get a little bit slow there but we'll be um we need to get out at 10 10 so we can get upstairs just about three more minutes but then you go through look first your knowledge temperature and remember like brother dale said there are definitions human definitions or what i say the definitions that man has come up with that's not what that is virtue virtue to the world is is that you're a virgin or that you have a virtuous life but now brother well are you are you kept yourself clean you understand what i mean but brother i said this virtue was strength right power virtue went out from jesus when the woman touched his garment we get weak when things happen in the in the spirit realm and you see people get a little bit weak because of different things that's not man's knowledge right because the bible says knowledge puffed up and all these different things knowledge will run to and fro knowledge will increase that's not god's knowledge yes it is to a point because god but this is god's knowledge brother brown said to know what the bible says and know what to do about it you see what man so you go through justification again amen god keeps every day chopping off your past sins if you ask him to forgive you of that and make it right then you go do sanctification again what is sanctification oh lord is cleaning and setting a sign for service so what god's cleaning you up in here again okay because there is still unclean spirits right here because they're in your spirit realm not in your salt have i got that right then when you come up to here that was a question the other day brother talks about the holy spirit sealing this in what adoption where it's not that you're just some christian robot right you're not a christian robot amen i don't do anything wrong i don't do anything no you come to a consciousness that when something does happen you stop it real quick instead of letting it go further like you used to do all right so you've got justification thank you for baptising the holy ghost justification baptism of the holy ghost have i got that that's why they wrote holy spirit right there but now this is god himself right amen the the um founding fathers if you want to say are the first church age didn't have this this is jesus christ this is the son of man he went away but he became the cornerstone which is exactly apparent little pyramid the headstone became the cornerstone that's right built the church back up and they stopped right here because they couldn't go any further god had to send us a prophet to give us rapturing faith to get out of here okay so this rapture and faith now we're going through and we got we will realize that i am sinless because god said i'm saying this and this is what's going to take us out here we get all this together that's what we're doing now the porter has got has given us the message to get everything together so that we can go in this open door it's not a door squeezed open this thing's open and the bride's gonna go up through that door and then immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one you know i'm going to meet three right one set on the throne you see that now look that's italicized one one sitting on the throne right and it's not look it's not even a definition for that because one means one all right let's go that's right one means one
